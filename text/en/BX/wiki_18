<text>, stylised as Yokohama F·Marinos, is a Japanese professional football club based in Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture, part of the Greater Tokyo Area. The club competes in the J1 League, which is the top tier of football in the country.

Having won the J-League title five times and finishing second twice, they are one of the most successful J-League clubs. The team is based in Yokohama and was founded as the company team of Nissan Motor. The club was formed by the merger of Yokohama Marinos and Yokohama Flügels in 1999. The current name is intended to reflect both of the original names. Yokohama F. Marinos is the longest serving team in the top flight of Japanese football, having played at the top level since 1982, also making them, along with Kashima Antlers, one of only two teams to have competed in Japan&#x27;s top flight of football every year since its inception.

== History ==
=== As Nissan Motors (1972–1991) ===
The team traces its origins to 1972 as the Nissan Motors Football Club, based in Yokohama. Nissan won promotion to Division 2 Football League in 1976. Under coach Shu Kamo, the team won the Japan Soccer League in 1988 and 1989, as well as the JSL Cup in 1988, 1989 and 1990 and the Emperor&#x27;s Cup in 1983, 1985, 1988, 1989 and 1991. The 1989 team won the &quot;Triple Crown&quot; - all three major tournaments in Japan - with famous players such as Kazushi Kimura, Takashi Mizunuma and Brazilian Oscar. At the end of the 1991–92 season, the team won the Asian Cup Winners&#x27; Cup.

=== As Yokohama Marinos (1992–1998) ===
Nissan obtained registration in the newly formed J.League to acquire professional club status and changed the club&#x27;s name to Yokohama Marinos, a reference to Yokohama&#x27;s status as a major port city. In their first seasons as a professional team, Yokohama Marinos continued to win competitions: triumphant in the Emperor&#x27;s Cup, a second consecutive Asian Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, and their first J.League title in 1995. Matches between Yokohama Marinos and Verdy Kawasaki were known as the National Derby.

=== As Yokohama F. Marinos (1999–&quot;present&quot;) ===

In 1999, the club was renamed Yokohama F. Marinos after the technical and financial merger with Yokohama Flügels, which had declared bankruptcy. An F was added to the name to represent the Flügels half of the club. However, many Flügels fans have rejected the new team, feeling that their team was dissolved into the F. Marinos rather than merged with it. As a result, they refused to follow F. Marinos and instead created Yokohama FC, the new city rival of F. Marinos, with the help of public donations and an affiliation with IMG, a talent agency.

In 2000, Marinos were runner-up in the 2000 J1 League, where Shunsuke Nakamura was named the best player of the season.

On 27 October 2001, Marinos won the J.League Cup, defeating Júbilo Iwata in a 0–0 match where Marinos won the penalty shootout 3–1.

In the 2002 season, Marinos were league runners-up behind Júbilo Iwata.

==== Back-to-back league champions ====
In 2003 and 2004, Marinos became back-to-back league champions for the second time, in the professional era, with the stars of the team being South Koreans Ahn Jung-hwan, Yoo sang-chul and Japanese players Daisuke Oku, Tatsuhiko Kubo and Yuji Nakazawa (who was the best player of the year in 2004). Their coach was the Japanese Takeshi Okada, who was named the &#x27;Best Coach of the Year&#x27; in 2003 and 2004.

From 2005 to 2008, with notable players Hayuma Tanaka, Hideo Ōshima, Daisuke Sakata and Koji Yamase, Marinos didn&#x27;t achieve any single honours. The highest they reached during this period was the 2008 Emperor&#x27;s Cup semi-final where they were knockout by Gamba Osaka in extra time.

In 2010, club legend Shunsuke Nakamura returned to Yokohama F. Marinos after 8 years and stayed until the end of the 2017 J1 League season.

On August 4, 2011, a year after leaving the club, former Marinos player Naoki Matsuda collapsed during training with Matsumoto Yamaga due to cardiac arrest and died at the age of 34. As a result, his former number 3 has been retired.

And after two semi-final defeats in 2011 and 2012, Marinos won the 2013 Emperor&#x27;s Cup on 1 January 2014, the first after 21 years and in 2013, they were runner-up in the J.League for the second time in their history.

==== Owned by City Football Group ====
On 20 May 2014, it was announced that the City Football Group, a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi United Group, had invested in a minority stake in Yokohama F. Marinos, creating a partnership with the football club and the automaker Nissan.

And after consecutive defeats, such as a loss in the 2017 Emperor&#x27;s Cup Final and in the 2018 J.League Cup Final, the team managed to get a good shape thanks to the direction of the Australian coach Ange Postecoglou, which ended 15 years of drought by winning the 2019 J1 League title, with emphasis on the participation of Teruhito Nakagawa being the &#x27;Best Player of the Season&#x27; and top scorer with 15 goals together with Brazilian Marcos Júnior.

In 2020, Marinos made it out of the 2020 AFC Champions League group stage for the first time since the AFC Champions League switched to the current format. The club were drawn in Group H alongside Chinese Shanghai SIPG, South Korean Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors and Australian Sydney FC. Marinos qualified to the knockout stages as group leaders with 4 wins, 1 draw and 1 losses. However the club was bowed out from the tournament in the Round of 16 losing 3–2 to South Korean Suwon Samsung Bluewings.

In 2021, Marinos finished in second place 13 points behind league champions, Kawasaki Frontale where on 18 July 2021, Head coach Ange Postecoglou was signed by Scottish club, Celtic while Hideki Matsunaga will be the caretaker for the club until 18 July 2021, Marinos signed another Australian head coach, Kevin Muscat.

In 2022, Kevin Muscat steered the club to win their fifth J1 League title. The club also finished as group leaders in the 2022 AFC Champions League group stage being placed in Group H alongside South Korean Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors, Vietnamese Hoang Anh Gia Lai and Australian Sydney FC. Marinos qualified to the knockout stages with 4 wins, 1 draw and 1 losses where they faced another Japanese side Vissel Kobe in the Round of 16, however, the club suffered a 3–2 defeat to Vissel Kobe thus crashing out from the competition.

In 2023, Marinos than finished as league runners up with 64 points behind Vissel Kobe who got 71 points. Kevin Muscat than guided the club in the 2023–24 AFC Champions League group stage being drawn in Group G with Chinese Shandong Taishan, South Korean Incheon United and Filipino Kaya–Iloilo. Marinos finished the group tied with 12 points along with Shandong Taishan and Incheon United but qualified to the round of 16 as group leaders.

On 6 December 2023, Kevin Muscat resigned as the head coach in which Harry Kewell were appointed as the new head coach of the club on 31 December 2023 becoming the third consecutive Australian manager in the club history. Harry Kewell than guided the club in the round of 16 fixture against Thai Bangkok United, winning the match 3–2 on aggregate with Anderson Lopes scoring an injury time penalty in the 120th minute of extra time during the second leg sending the team to the quarter-finals. Marinos then faced off against Shandong Taishan again in which Marinos won 3–1 on aggregate thus seeing them to the semi-finals against South Korean Ulsan Hyundai. 
Marinos suffered a 1–0 defeat away in which the club bounced back in the second leg at home winning the match 3–2 thus seeing both club tied with 3–3 on aggregate sending the match into extra time and then penalties shootout. Marinos went on to win the penalties shootout 5–4 where vice-captain Eduardo scored the winning penalty to send the team to their first-ever Champions League final against Emirati Al Ain. They would start losing 0-1 during the first leg at home, but then came back with two goals from Asahi Uenaka and Kota Watanabe to make it 2–1 at the end of the match, but, unfortunately, they&#x27;d lose 5–1 away in the second leg (6–3 on aggregate), thus ending as runners-up of the competition.

However, her mystery as a whole had mixed reviews. In a review of the second-season premiere, Michael Slezak of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; thought that the Applewhite mystery would help reduce the show&#x27;s chances of falling into a sophomore slump. He praised Woodard&#x27;s acting as well as her character&#x27;s storyline, opining, &quot;there&#x27;s something so inherently warm and maternal in Woodard&#x27;s performance, such apple-pie wholesomeness, that it makes her touches of menace all the more chilling.&quot; However, as the season progressed, there were many complaints about Betty&#x27;s lack of interaction with the other housewives. She left the series in the second-season finale episode.
Woodard was nominated for Primetime Emmys for her roles in the television films &quot;The Water Is Wide&quot; and &quot;Pictures of Hollis Woods&quot; (2007).

If she&#x27;s not in this thing, I think it goes kaput.&quot;. In next year, she appeared in the independent drama &quot;American Violet&quot;, playing the mother of a 24-year-old African-American woman wrongfully swept up in a drug raid.

From 2010 to 2011, Woodard starred as Lt. Tanya Rice in the TNT comedy-drama series &quot;Memphis Beat&quot;, winning a Gracie Allen Award for each of its two seasons. One critic said: &quot;I originally tuned in for Jason Lee, who plays a police detective named Dwight who likes to croon the blues.

In 2010, she appeared in the third season of HBO&#x27;s &quot;True Blood&quot; as Ruby Jean Reynolds. garnering another Primetime Emmy nomination in 2011 for her recurring role.

In 2014, Woodard played the role of the first female President of the United States in the NBC political drama series &quot;State of Affairs&quot; opposite Katherine Heigl. About her role, Woodard said, &quot;It&#x27;s fun to play the President, rather than to be the President. But what drew me was how smart the script was, and this world we hadn&#x27;t seen before—this world most Americans didn&#x27;t know existed before we went after Bin Laden. And that it was being done by people who knew the world. So we&#x27;re not stepping too outside the boundaries; it&#x27;s based in realism. And I love politics. I have worked in politics for several decades, so it was a chance to live in a world that was important to me.&quot; The series premiered with generally negative reviews from critics, but most reviewers praised Woodard&#x27;s performance. Amy Amatangelo of &quot;Boston Herald&quot; gave the premiere grade &quot;C&quot;, stating that, &quot;Alfre Woodard isn&#x27;t given a lot to do as President Constance Payton in the premiere, but, unlike Heigl, she does have the gravitas for the role, and the show would be wise to use her more. The series sets up some interesting reveals in the hour&#x27;s final moments. They potentially could make the show more interesting. But for now the state of affairs is rather mediocre.&quot; The series was canceled after a single season.

<doc id="664606" wikidata="Q1014166" url="?curid=664606" title="Parkfield, California">
<text>Parkfield (formerly Russelsville) is an unincorporated community in Monterey County, California. It is located on Little Cholame Creek east of Bradley, at an elevation of . As of 2007, road signs announce the population as 18.

Parkfield is located in the Temblor Range between the San Joaquin Valley and the Central Coast, at an elevation of above sea level. Mining and homesteading used to be prosperous activities in this community, but the mines were exhausted below economic recovery levels, and the industry moved elsewhere. Today, Parkfield is a small town of about 18 people, most of whom are ranchers and farmers. There is a small tourism industry in the town based on equine-related events, hunting, a bluegrass music festival, and Parkfield&#x27;s unique earthquake history (see the Geology section below). The Parkfield motto is, &quot;Be here when it happens.&quot;

A post office operated at Parkfield from 1884 to 1954. The town&#x27;s original name of Russelsville was rejected by the post office, and Parkfield was chosen from the town&#x27;s park-like setting among oak trees.

The ZIP Code is 93451, and the community is inside area code 805.

== Geology ==
Parkfield lies along the San Andreas Fault, one of the longest and most active faults in the United States, which appears in the town as a seasonally dry creek bed. The fault marks the divide between the North American Plate and the Pacific Plate (see plate tectonics). There is a bridge across the creek with piers on either side that have shifted more than five feet relative to one another due to aseismic creep since the bridge was constructed in 1936. Google satellite images show that the bridge, which Simon Winchester described as &quot;bent&quot; and having cracked and patched pavement, has been replaced since Winchester&#x27;s book was published, and a sliding joint installed; however, the west piers of the bridge remain displaced to the north. The bridge sports signage announcing to drivers that they are crossing the plate boundary.

Since at least 1857, Parkfield has experienced a magnitude 6 or greater earthquake about every 22 years. In 1985, the US Geological Survey predicted that there would be a comparably-sized earthquake in this community by 1993, but no such event came until September 28, 2004, when a 6.0 Mw earthquake struck at 10:15 am Pacific Daylight Time.

Parkfield is the most closely observed earthquake zone in the world. Scientists constantly measure the strain in rocks, heat flow, microseismicity, and geomagnetism around Parkfield. The observations of the San Andreas fault in Parkfield are hoped to help scientists better understand the physics of earthquakes and faulting; information gathered from Parkfield may still be used someday to issue predictions for major earthquakes along the San Andreas fault and around the world.

Since 1985, the United States Geological Survey has been working on a project known as &quot;The Parkfield Experiment&quot;, a long-term research project on the San Andreas Fault. &quot;The experiment&#x27;s purpose is to better understand the physics of earthquakes — what actually happens on the fault and in the surrounding region before, during and after an earthquake.&quot;

In 2004, work began just north of Parkfield on the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD). The goal of SAFOD is to drill a hole nearly 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) into the Earth&#x27;s crust, across the San Andreas Fault. The specific target of the probe was a patch of fault known to generate sequences of repeating microearthquakes of around magnitude 1.0. The drilling was completed in the midyear of 2005, and an array of sensors was installed to capture and record earthquakes that happen near this area. It is hoped that SAFOD observations will provide insight into the source mechanisms of these small earthquakes, which can be scaled up in an effort to understand larger events. The drilling discovered a mineral called &quot;serpentinite&quot; at the site of origin of the 2004 earthquake. Serpentinite can transform into talc, a very soft mineral, thus facilitating easy slippage of plates. It has been hypothesized that aseismic creep at Hollister is also due to the presence of serpentinite. No drilling has been done at Hollister to confirm this.

<doc id="664610" wikidata="Q1076143" url="?curid=664610" title="Native Dancer">
<text>Native Dancer (March 27, 1950 – November 16, 1967), nicknamed the &quot;Gray Ghost&quot;, was one of the most celebrated and accomplished Thoroughbred racehorses in American history and was the first horse made famous through the medium of television. He was a champion in each of his three years of racing, and was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1963. In the &quot;Blood-Horse&quot; magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century, he was ranked seventh.

As a two-year-old, he was undefeated in his nine starts and was voted Horse of the Year in two of three major industry polls – One Count won the other. At age three, he suffered the sole defeat in his career in the 1953 Kentucky Derby, but rebounded to win the Preakness, Belmont and Travers Stakes. He made only three starts at age four before being retired due to injury, but was still named American Horse of the Year.

Retired to stud in 1955, he became a major sire whose offspring included champion Raise A Native and dual Classic winner Kauai King. Also an influential broodmare sire, Native Dancer is now &quot;all but universal&quot; in modern pedigrees.

==Background==
Native Dancer was bred by Alfred G. Vanderbilt Jr. and raced for him as a homebred. He was foaled at Scott Farm near Lexington, Kentucky but was raised at Vanderbilt&#x27;s Sagamore Farm in Glyndon, Maryland, and is generally considered a Maryland-bred. Native Dancer was sired by the 1945 Preakness Stakes winner, Polynesian, who was otherwise known as a sprinter. His dam Geisha won only once in her eleven starts and produced no other stakes winners, though her daughter Orientation became a multiple stakes producer. Geisha was sired by Discovery, an outstanding distance horse and weight-carrier. Discovery was also the broodmare sire of leading sire Bold Ruler.

Native Dancer inherited his gray coat, then quite rare in Thoroughbreds, through the female line to his fourth dam, La Grisette, a daughter of Roi Herode. Roi Herode was also the sire of The Tetrarch, the &quot;spotted wonder&quot;. Most modern gray Thoroughbreds can trace their coat to Roi Herode and his grandsire Le Sancy.

From his earliest days, Native Dancer was considered &quot;an extremely nice colt&quot;. Ralph Kerchaval, the manager of Sagamore Farm, said that &quot;he was playful, big and rough, but you could do anything with him.&quot; At maturity, Native Dancer stood at the withers. According to Charles Hatton of the &quot;Daily Racing Form&quot;, Native Dancer looked like a sprinter from the front and a stayer from the back. He was a massive horse with &quot;suspicious-looking ankles&quot;. His pastern bones were short and somewhat too upright, making him more vulnerable to injury. He had a notably long stride but his action was hard and pounding. Trainer Bill Winfrey said the colt was &quot;a regular Jekyll and Hyde&quot; – ordinarily quiet and tractable but with a playful streak that could make him a handful.

==Racing record==
===1952: two-year-old campaign===
In his first season of racing, Native Dancer won all nine starts. He was voted the American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt for 1952, with two of the three major polls also naming him Horse of the Year.

Native Dancer made his first start on April 19, 1952 in a maiden race at Jamaica Racetrack over five furlongs. Going off at odds of 7-5 in a field of nine, he settled into fourth place down the backstretch, then started a strong drive in the middle of the turn to win by lengths. Just four days later, he returned in the Youthful Stakes where he was made the odds-on favorite in a field of twelve. He pressed a fast early pace set by Retrouve then pulled away in the stretch to win by six lengths. The victory established the colt as the early leader of the two-year-old division.

Native Dancer was then given a layoff to recover from sore shins. He returned to racing on the opening day of Saratoga Race Course, August 4, in the Flash Stakes over furlongs. Again the odds-on favorite, he was ridden hard around the turn before drawing away in the stretch to win by lengths. On August 16, he entered the Saratoga Special, noteworthy at the time for having a winner-takes-all purse of $17,000. He won by lengths over a muddy track. He followed up by winning the Grand Union Hotel Stakes on August 23, defeating two previously undefeated colts – Tahitian King and Lafango. He won by lengths while running the fastest six furlongs at that year&#x27;s Saratoga meeting, 1:11. He completed his dominance at Saratoga by winning the Hopeful Stakes on the meeting&#x27;s closing day, August 31. Jockey Eric Guerin said, &quot;I never had a second of worry. He took off when I asked him to.&quot;

Native Dancer made his next start on September 22 at Belmont Park in a six-furlong special weight race. He broke in fifth place in the field of six, then steadily improved his position to win by lengths. Just five days later, he returned in the Belmont Futurity, then one of the most prestigious races for two-year-olds in the United States. He turned in a &quot;superlative performance&quot; to win while tying the world record for furlongs, 1:14. He had been hard pressed though – Guerin admitted that he had thought the colt was beaten with an eighth of a mile remaining when he was headed by Tahitian King. But Native Dancer responded in the final furlong to open a lead advantage. He became the first gray horse to win the race.

Native Dancer made his final start as a two-year-old in the East View Stakes at Jamaica on October 22 over a distance of miles. He won with ease, &quot;wiggling his ears and having much fun&quot; as he crossed the finish line lengths ahead of Laffango, who had earlier won the Champagne Stakes. Guerin confirmed that Native Dancer had eased himself after taking the lead at the head of the stretch. &quot;He&#x27;s not going to do any more than you make him do,&quot; he said. &quot;I never hit him with the whip.&quot;

Native Dancer finished the year with nine wins, seven of them in stakes races, and earnings of $230,245, then a record for a two-year-old. He had been the odds-on favorite in all but his first start. He was named the American Champion Two-Year-Old. The Thoroughbred Racing Association also named him the American Horse of the Year, a &quot;break with tradition&quot; as two-year-olds are not normally considered for the award since they typically only race against horses of the same age and competition is not considered as deep. The Turf and Sports Digest, polling 176 sportswriters, also awarded him Horse of the Year honors However, the Daily Racing Form voted instead for One Count, winner of the Belmont and Jockey Club Gold Cup.

He was assigned 130 pounds in the Experimental Free Handicap, seven pounds ahead of Laffango and Tahitian King.

===1953: three-year-old campaign===
In his three-year-old campaign, Native Dancer received a great deal of media attention leading up to the 1953 Kentucky Derby. He won the Gotham Stakes and the prestigious Wood Memorial, but in the 1953 Kentucky Derby, he lost for the only time in his career. Native Dancer subsequently won the Preakness, Belmont and Travers Stakes, a feat accomplished until then only by Duke of Magenta, Grenada, Man o&#x27; War and Whirlaway. Native Dancer finished the season with nine wins (all of them stakes races) from ten starts and was named Champion Three-Year-Old Colt.

====Preparing for the Triple Crown====
Native Dancer was given some time off at the end of his two-year-old campaign, then resumed training in California at Santa Anita Racetrack. He gave his connections a scare in late January when he threw his exercise rider after stumbling to his knees following a workout. He then bolted and was loose for five minutes, running into the paddock where he jumped some benches and ran through flower beds. When he tangled a leg in the reins, he finally slowed down enough to be recaptured. No serious damage was done.

He was shipped to New York in mid-March and made his first start of the year in the Gotham Stakes on April 18. As the race attracted 18 entries, it was run in two divisions, with Native Dancer the odds-on favorite is his division and Laffango the favorite in the second division. He raced in mid-pack during the early part of the race, then &quot;did a bit of hustling&quot; turning into the stretch to take the lead. He won under a hand ride by two lengths. Sportswriter George Ryall wrote, &quot;Any question in your mind about Native Dancer is easy to answer; he&#x27;s as good as you thought.&quot;

Native Dancer extended his winning streak to eleven in the Wood Memorial on April 25. Going off as the 1-10 favorite, he was restrained until the top of the stretch, then &quot;whizzed away&quot; from his rivals to win by lengths over Tahitian King.

The Gotham and Wood Memorial were both televised by NBC. Native Dancer&#x27;s gray coat helped him stand out on the black and white screens of the day, helping him to become the first TV star of the sport.

====Kentucky Derby====
The 1953 Kentucky Derby, held on May 2, was the sole loss of Native Dancer&#x27;s career. He dominated news coverage leading up to the race and was the odds-on favorite. His main rival was supposed to have been Correspondent, who had won three straight, including the Blue Grass Stakes in which he set a track record. Dark Star won the Derby Trial a few days before the Derby but was largely dismissed by the bettors at odds of 25-1.

Dark Star, starting from the next-to-outside post position, went to the early lead and moved over to the rail. Native Dancer was eighth as they went down the stretch for the first time and was then bumped by longshot Money Maker as they entered the first turn. He started to make up ground on the final turn while racing wide, then was moved to the inside as he entered the stretch in third place. Still nearly three lengths behind, Guerin went to the whip and Native Dancer gradually closed ground. Dark Star held his position on the rail so Native Dancer was swung to the outside. He continued to edge closer with each stride but fell just short, losing by a head.

In addition to Native Dancer being fouled on the first turn, Guerin commented after the race that the colt had not cared for the track. However, Guerin was given a large share of the blame for the loss because of his racing tactics. One reporter wrote, &quot;he took that colt everywhere on the track except the ladies&#x27; room.&quot; Native Dancer was farther back than usual in the early part of the race, which resulted in more traffic problems. Instead of mounting a single drive on the outside, Guerin changed position several times in the final quarter of a mile, costing the colt momentum. Guerin later explained, &quot;He just didn&#x27;t want to run early. And when he didn&#x27;t want to run, he didn&#x27;t run.&quot;

&quot;Time&quot; magazine later reported, &quot;When he lost the Kentucky Derby by a head, thousands turned from their TV screens in sorrow, a few in tears.&quot; As a measure of Native Dancer&#x27;s growing fame, &quot;Time&quot; added, &quot;Hundreds of people, old and young, have sent him letters and greeting cards. Little girls have organized fan clubs in his name.&quot;

Native Dancer made his next start in the Withers Stakes on May 16 at Belmont Park. Facing only two other horses, he went off as the 1-20 favorite (the legal minimum) with win-only betting allowed. Native Dancer stumbled when leaving the starting gate but quickly recovered. He took a narrow lead about three furlongs from the finish and opened a significant margin around the eighth pole when Guerin flicked his whip. The final margin was four lengths.

====Preakness Stakes====
On May 23, Native Dancer entered the Preakness Stakes as the 1-5 favorite. He again faced Dark Star, who set a fast early pace with Tahitian King to his outside. Native Dancer rated in fourth position on the rail, then started his move on the final turn, splitting between the two front runners. Tahitian King dropped back and eventually finished sixth. At the head of the stretch, Dark Star also gave way, leaving Native Dancer alone on the lead. However, longshot Jamie K then started to close ground rapidly. Guerin went to the whip and Native Dancer responded to win by a neck. Guerin admitted that he had been worried. &quot;When Dark Star stopped, I found myself in the lead a little sooner than I wanted,&quot; he said. It was later determined that Dark Star had bowed a tendon during the race: he never raced again.

Besides being the odds-on favorite to win, Native Dancer was so heavily bet to show that it created a minus pool. A show bet pays if the horse finishes in the top three positions, and the legal minimum payout in Maryland at the time was $2.20 for a $2 bet. In order to cover the bets plus the associated taxes, the Maryland Jockey Club had to pay $46,012 () into the pool.

The trophy for the Preakness is the Woodlawn Vase, considered the most valuable trophy in sports with a value of roughly $4 million. Before 1954, the vase itself was given to the winning owner, who kept it for the following year. In 1954 though, Vanderbilt declined to take the original trophy home and instead was given a replica. This set a new tradition where the original Woodlawn Vase is displayed at Pimlico on Preakness day but otherwise resides at the Baltimore Museum of Art. Vanderbilt&#x27;s replica trophy was sold at auction in 2018 for $100,000.

====Belmont Stakes====
Native Dancer was shipped to Belmont Park on May 24. He was walked the next two days to recover from the Preakness, then resumed galloping in the morning. He had several timed workouts in the interval leading up to the Belmont: mile in 1:04 on May 30, a mile in 1:44 on June 1, mile in 0:35 on June 4, miles in 2:07 on June 5, miles in 2:38 on June 9, and mile in 1:13 on June 12. Training practices have since changed dramatically. For example, California Chrome had only one timed workout in the three weeks between the 2014 Preakness and Belmont.

The Belmont Stakes, run on June 13, was a similar race to the Preakness. Native Dancer was again the heavy favorite, and the New York Racing Association did not allow show betting. Ram o&#x27; War set the early pace with Native Dancer biding his time in fourth place around the first turn. He was tracked closely by Jamie K and the two horses started their move together on the final turn. Jamie K briefly took the lead as they entered the stretch, but Native Dancer fought back. The two colts dueled for the final furlong, with Native Dancer again prevailing by a neck. He completed the miles in 2:28, then the third-fastest running of the race behind Count Fleet and Citation.

&quot;He doesn&#x27;t win in a flashy sort of a way,&quot; said Winfrey, &quot;but he keeps on winning. The Belmont is supposed to be &#x27;the test of the champion&#x27; and if it is, he certainly answered the question.&quot;

To date, Native Dancer is one of only two &quot;dual Classic winners&quot; to come from the state of Maryland (the other being his son Kauai King, who won the 1966 Kentucky Derby and Preakness).

====Summer campaign====
Winfrey planned a busy summer campaign to keep his &quot;lazy so-and-so&quot; active. Native Dancer responded to the challenge, winning the Dwyer, Arlington Classic, Travers and American Derby in quick succession. On July 4, he went off as the 1-20 favorite in the Dwyer Stakes. He took the lead near the head of the stretch, &quot;loafed for a while, exerted himself just a bit in the final yards,&quot; and won by lengths. Carrying 126 pounds, he conceded 10 pounds to each of his four rivals. Even though win-only betting was allowed, Native Dancer still created a small minus pool with a mandatory minimum payout of $2.10 for a $2 bet.

Native Dancer then traveled to Chicago for the Arlington Classic, run over a distance of a mile on a heavy track on July 18. His main rivals were expected to be Jamie K and Van Crosby, who had equaled the track record for seven furlongs in his previous start. Native Dancer carried 128 pounds, conceding six pounds to each of his seven rivals. As expected, Van Crosby set the pace, but was run down by Native Dancer turning into the stretch. Native Dancer continued to draw away and won by nine lengths, the biggest margin of victory of his career. Longshot Sir Mango closed late for second; Jamie K was never a factor.

On August 15, Native Dancer made his next start in the prestigious Travers Stakes at Saratoga. He conceded six pounds to Dictar and twelve to the other three entrants. In the walking ring, he was surrounded by a throng of fans looking for photographs. &quot;It&#x27;s the way people act when the president goes by in a parade,&quot; commented one man. Native Dancer maintained his calm. At the break, Fly Wheel took the early lead but soon dropped back. Guardian II then took over the lead for a few lengths before Dictar took command on the backstretch. Native Dancer bided his time until the pole, then powered away to win by lengths ahead of Dictar. Native Dancer again created minus pools in the win and place betting – show betting was not allowed.

Guerin was suspended for an incident in another race and so missed Native Dancer&#x27;s next start, the American Derby on August 22. Eddie Arcaro got the mount after the horse he had been scheduled to ride, Jamie K, was withdrawn from the race. Arcaro had previously questioned Native Dancer&#x27;s credentials, saying, &quot;All the Dancer has done is go around beating the same horses, and most of the time carrying equal weight.&quot; He had also questioned the horse&#x27;s soundness. After galloping him for the first time though, he said, &quot;He&#x27;s a big, powerful animal. He handled well and had a good disposition.&quot;

Travelling back to Chicago, Native Dancer went off as the 1-10 favorite in a field of eight in the American Derby on August 22. He settled near the back of the pack behind a fast early pace set by Sir Mango. Entering the far turn, Native Dancer moved to the outside and into fourth place. Without any urging, he surged forward rounding the far turn and won by two lengths. He completed the -mile race in 1:48, just one-fifth of a second off the track record. Arcaro believed that the colt could have broken the record if urged. &quot;But he was winning, so I didn&#x27;t see any point in pressing him,&quot; he said. &quot;I let him run his own race.&quot; Despite the easy win, Arcaro still believed that Native Dancer had something to prove. He rated Citation as the best horse he had ever ridden.

While Native Dancer was having a noteworthy campaign in the three-year-old division, Tom Fool was enjoying an equally brilliant one as a four-year-old. Racetracks began to alter stakes schedules and purses in hopes of having the two champions face off. For example, Pimlico increased the purse for the Pimlico Special to $50,000. Belmont Park followed suit by increasing the purse and changing the date of the Sysonby Stakes. The hopes for a race between the two died when several bruises were found on Native Dancer&#x27;s left forefoot after the American Derby. He missed the rest of the year.

Native Dancer was named champion three-year-old by all three major industry polls. However, in the Horse of the Year voting, he came second behind Tom Fool, who had won all ten of his starts.

===1954: four-year-old campaign===
In 1954, Native Dancer won all three races he entered, including the Metropolitan Handicap. His connections hoped to complete the New York Handicap Triple, or perhaps race in Europe on the turf. However, Native Dancer was retired as a result of a recurring foot injury with a record of 21 wins out of 22 lifetime races.

At the beginning of the 1954, Native Dancer was in Maryland where he spent the winter at Sagamore Farm. By February, he was galloping three miles a day. He was then shipped to New York in late March to resume training with Winfrey. He now faced a new challenge: as an older horse, he would be expected to carry high weight imposts in the handicap format pervasive at the time. His connections considered sending him to England to compete in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes if the weights got too high. Vanderbilt also discussed entering the colt in the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe in France.

Native Dancer made his first start of the year in a six-furlong allowance race at Belmont Park on May 7. He went off at odds of 3-20 in a seven-horse field, with Laffango the second choice at 7-1. He raced in mid-pack for the first half-mile, then &quot;took the lead in about three huge strides.&quot; After hitting the front near the top of the stretch, Native Dancer relaxed but still won by lengths.

On May 15, Native Dancer entered the Metropolitan Handicap, in which he was assigned 130 pounds – from 13 to 24 pounds more than his eight rivals. He raced further back than usual, trailing by ten lengths with a half mile remaining and still seven lengths back at the quarter pole. Down the stretch, Guerin hit him four times with the whip. Native Dancer &quot;answered the question&quot; and lengthened his stride. He closed steadily, getting his nose in front with just 30 yards remaining. He completed the mile in 1:35, then the second-fastest running of the race in its history.

Native Dancer was supposed to make his next start in the Suburban Handicap, then part of the New York Handicap Triple (consisting of the Metropolitan, Suburban and Brooklyn Handicaps). However, after a workout in late May, he showed signs of lameness. Heating was found in the coronet band on his right fore, though X-rays showed nothing. Winfrey originally gave the colt a 50% chance of being fit for the Suburban. Native Dancer worked three furlongs on May 27 but pulled up lame. His connections ruled him out of the Suburban.

Native Dancer finally returned to racing at Saratoga on August 16 in the Oneonta Handicap, run at a distance of seven furlongs over a sloppy track. He was assigned 137 pounds, conceding his rivals from 18 to 30 pounds. Even with the handicap, only two horses faced him so betting was not allowed. He won easily by nine lengths in 1:24, just seconds off the track record despite the track conditions.

His next target was the Saratoga Cup but he showed signs of lameness after a 10-furlong workout on August 22, again in the right forefoot. Veterinarian William Wright diagnosed the problem as a &quot;bruised digital cushion, with a secondary inflammation of the bursae between the navicular and coffin bone.&quot; He was retired with a record of 21 wins from 22 starts, and earnings of $785,420, then fourth all-time behind Citation, Stymie and Armed.

Native Dancer was voted the United States Horse of the Year for 1954, beating High Gun by 19 votes to 11 in the Daily Racing Form poll and winning the TRA award for the second time. He appeared on the May 31 cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. Many consider the &quot;Gray Ghost of Sagamore&quot; to have been the first Thoroughbred television star and TV Guide ranked him as a top icon of the era&quot;.

==Statistics==


==Stud record==
At stud, Native Dancer sired 43 stakes winners (or 44 according to one source) from 306 foals. His male-line descendants, particularly through his grandson Mr. Prospector, have dominated the US Triple Crown races. He is also the damsire of Northern Dancer, arguably the most influential stallion of the 20th century.

Although Native Dancer never led the American sire list, he did finish second in 1966 and sixth in 1965. He was also second in the English sire list of 1963, and seventh in the French sire list of 1963.

Among Native Dancer&#x27;s notable offspring are:
* Atan - sire of major sire Sharpen Up
* Dan Cupid – won Prix du Bois and other stakes races in France; sire of Sea-Bird (won Epsom Derby and Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe)
* Dancer&#x27;s Image - won 1968 Kentucky Derby (disqualified)
* Exclusive Dancer - stakes winner and dam of General Assembly
* Gala Performance - won Jim Dandy Stakes: sire of steeplechasers, including West Tip, the winner of the 1986 Aintree Grand National and Monksfield.
* Good Move - won Selima Stakes etc.
* Hula Dancer - raced in France and England where her wins included the 1,000 Guineas
* Kauai King - won the 1966 Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes
* Natalma - dam of Northern Dancer
* Native Charger - won the 1965 Flamingo Stakes, Florida Derby
* Native Prince – won Great American Stakes etc.
* Native Street - multiple stakes wins including the 1966 Kentucky Oaks
* Protanto - multiple stakes wins including the 1971 Whitney Stakes
* Raise a Native - co-champion two-year-old colt of 1963. important sire of Majestic Prince, Alydar and leading sire Mr. Prospector, as well as Exclusive Native, who sired Affirmed and Genuine Risk
* Secret Step – won King George Stakes and July Cup etc. in England
* Shenanigans - 1975 Kentucky Broodmare of the Year. Dam of the champion filly Ruffian and influential sire Icecapade
* Street Dancer won Santa Ana Handicap etc.

Native Dancer&#x27;s bloodline is credited with creating &quot;precocious, speedy Thoroughbreds that dominate the Derby and other Triple Crown events.&quot; By 2008, every entrant in the Kentucky Derby was a descendant. However, he is also faulted for passing on his massive build and hard-pounding stride action, rendering many of his descendants vulnerable to injury. In the mid-2000s, there had been a troubling number of high profile breakdowns, including that of Barbaro (who was distantly related to Native Dancer through his dam.) As the grandsire of both Mr. Prospector and Northern Dancer, the two most important sires of the late twentieth century, a certain degree of inbreeding to Native Dancer became inevitable, potentially exacerbating the issue. &quot;There&#x27;s a lack of durability right now,&quot; said Ric Waldman, the former head of operations for Windfields Farm. &quot;We&#x27;re dealing with the law of diminishing returns.&quot; Vanderbilt&#x27;s son Alfred G. Vanderbilt defended the stallion&#x27;s legacy. &quot;All these great horses are not descended from him because he&#x27;s fragile,&quot; he said. &quot;They&#x27;re descended because he was a champion and he was durable.&quot;

Native Dancer died on November 16, 1967, following the surgical removal of a tumor on the wall of the small intestine. He was buried at Sagamore Farm.

==Honors==

Native Dancer was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1963. He was inducted into the Maryland State Athletic Hall of Fame in 2014.

In the Blood-Horse magazine ranking of the top 100 U.S. thoroughbred champions of the 20th century, Native Dancer was ranked #7. In the Associated Press rankings of the greatest racehorses of the 20th century, he was ranked #3, tied with Citation, behind only Man o&#x27; War and Secretariat.

In August 2015, a statue of Native Dancer by Gwen Reardon was unveiled at Congress Park in Saratoga Springs. The statue was donated to the city by Marylou Whitney and John Hendrickson. Native Dancer was undefeated in his six starts at nearby Saratoga Race Course.

==Pedigree==
Native Dancer is shown as descending from (family 5-f), which traces back to the Bazajet Mare. However, the female descendants of his third-dam La Chica have a type of mitochondrial DNA that is inconsistent with other descendants of this family. As mitochondrial DNA is passed exclusively in the female line, this indicates a pedigree error occurred at some point between the Bazajet Mare&#x27;s foaling in 1754 and La Chica&#x27;s in 1930.

<text>Ian Mikardo (9 July 1908 – 6 May 1993), commonly known as Mik, was a British Labour Member of Parliament. An ardent socialist and a Zionist, he remained a backbencher throughout his four decades in the House of Commons. He was a member of National Executive Committee of the Labour Party in 1950–59 and 1960–78, and Chairman of the Labour Party in 1970–1971. He was also chairman of the International Committee of the Labour Party in 1973–78, vice-president of the Socialist International (1978–1983) and honorary president (1983–1993).

Mikardo was a Labour Member of Parliament for Reading 1945–50, Reading South 1950–55, Reading 1955–59, Poplar 1964–74, Bethnal Green and Bow 1974–83 and Bow and Poplar 1983–87. He was Chairman of the House of Commons Select Committee on Nationalised Industries, 1966–70. He issued many pamphlets, the most famous were &quot;Keep Left&quot; (1947) and &quot;Keeping Left&quot; with Dick Crossman, Michael Foot and Jo Richardson, 1950. He was also a Fabian essayist, a staunch friend of Israel, as well as friend and mentor to many in the Labour movement, where he made a great impact.

==Early life and family==
His parents were Jewish refugees from the Tsarist Empire. His mother, Bluma &#x27;Bloomah&#x27; (died 1961 in Hampshire) came from a town called Yampil, Khmelnytskyi Oblast in the Volyn region, of the Western Ukraine. His father, Moshe &#x27;Morris&#x27; (died 1940 in Hampshire) came from Kutno, a textile-manufacturing town west of Warsaw. They came to East End of London separately around 1900 and married some years later. They worked as tailors and in 1907 moved to Portsmouth where they were employed repairing uniforms for the Royal Navy. Mikardo was born there in 1908. He had two brothers, Sidney Mikardo (1915-1999) and Norman Mikardo. His brother (Neville) Norman Mikardo (1924–2004), a mechanical engineer, was a Labour Party councillor for Tokyngton Ward of Brent South, from 1978–82. His niece Barbara Tayler (1931–2011) was a publisher, writer and political activist. Mikardo became a surrogate father to her after her father died when she was two years old.

When he began school-aged three, his lack of English words made him the butt of jokes. His parents spoke Yiddish.
He attended The Old Beneficiary School known as &quot;The Old Benny&quot;, in Portsea, Portsmouth, and the Omega Street School in Portsmouth. In 1919, he came top in Portsmouth&#x27;s pass-list for the 11-plus, and went to Portsmouth Southern Grammar School for Boys. From the age of eleven he also attended Aria College, a rabbinical seminary. However the life of a cleric was not for him and he transferred to Portsmouth Grammar School. At this time he followed Portsmouth FC and he had an encyclopedic knowledge of all their matches.

Concerned by injustice and inequality from boyhood, Mikardo was influenced by the works of R. H. Tawney and George Bernard Shaw in his teens. He attended political lectures at various clubs and societies in London in the 1920s, principally amongst the Jewish community. He joined both the Labour Party and Poale Zion, the Zionist workers&#x27; movement affiliated to the Labour Party. He was already a Zionist, and had given his first public speech at a meeting of the Portsmouth Zionist Society in 1922, aged 13.

After leaving school, Mikardo settled in Stepney, where he had a variety of jobs. In 1930 he met Mary (b. 1907), the daughter of Benjamin Rosetsky. They married at Mile End and Bow District synagogue on 3 January 1932, and Mary joined the Labour Party and Poale Zion. They had two daughters by 1936. Mary suffered a heart attack in 1959 which was progressively disabling. She died in Cheshire in 1994, a few months after him.

He studied scientific management, but was sceptical and developed his own theories. He became a freelance management consultant and during the Second World War, worked on increasing efficiency in aircraft and armaments manufacturing, principally at Woodley Aerodrome in Reading. He was treasurer of the World Airways Joint Committee of National Air Communications.

==Parliament and the Labour Party==
After settling in Reading at the end of the war he was selected by the local Constituency Labour Party for the 1945 general election, beating James Callaghan and Austen Albu. On every topic, the National Health Service, education, social deprivation, nationalisation or socialism, he was seen as an inspiration to others. Mik, as he introduced himself, showed he had planned where he was going and the constituency members wanted to go with him. His integrity was obvious and beguiling, quite rare amongst professional politicians.

He was elected Member of Parliament for Reading constituency overturning a large Conservative majority. Labour&#x27;s effective get out the vote campaign used in this election was universally adopted and came to be known as the Reading system. He held Reading, which became a highly marginal seat, until the 1959 general election when he was ousted by Peter Emery of the Association of Supervisory Staffs, Executives and Technicians, later the Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs and Manufacturing Science and Finance trade union. Ian Mikardo Way, a road in Lower Caversham, Reading, commemorates his role as the town&#x27;s MP.

Mikardo was a member of the left-wing of the Labour Party throughout his political career, writing for &quot;Tribune&quot;. In the post-war period, the Fabian Society was at the heart of Labour and social democratic thinking, and Mikardo contributed to the New Fabian Essays of 1952, edited by Anthony Crosland. These helped to reinvigorate the debate on the left after the fall of the Attlee government. Other contributors included Roy Jenkins, Richard Crossman and Denis Healey.

Mikardo&#x27;s secretary at the time was Jo Richardson (1923–94) who began her political career working for him and later became a Member of Parliament herself. She co-ordinated the &#x27;Keep Left Group&#x27; and went on to become the secretary of the Tribune Group. In 1951 Richardson was elected to Hornsey Borough Council and became the full-time secretary and working partner of Mikardo in his business, which involved trade with eastern Europe. In February 1958 Mikardo joined Stephen Swingler, Richardson, Harold Davies, Konni Zilliacus, Walter Monslow and Sydney Silverman, to form Victory for Socialism (VFS), which was co-ordinated by Richardson.

Mikardo was defeated in his Reading seat in 1959 but won Poplar in the General Election of 1964, representing the area of London where his parents had first settled. As the constituencies were reorganised over time, he went on to represent Bethnal Green and Bow from 1974 until 1983 and the Bow and Poplar from 1983 until his retirement from Parliament in 1987. Mikardo served as a member of the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party from 1950–59 and 1960–78. He was also chairman of the Select Committee on Nationalised Industries 1966–70 and Chairman of the Labour Party 1970–71.

In February 1973 Mikardo joined James Callaghan, Shadow Foreign Secretary, and Tom McNally, Secretary, International Department in an official Labour Party delegation visiting the Far East. On 27 March 1974 Mikardo, having already served as Chairman of the Labour Party, was elected chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party, defeating a candidate from the right of the party, Arthur Bottomley, by 99–85 votes. A necessarily anonymous and discerning experienced clerk of the House of Commons remarked &#x27;Ian Mikardo was simply the most skillful operator in committee that any of us ever saw.&#x27; Within Parliament, he was known as the Commons&#x27; bookmaker, willing to take bets on all manner of political events.

In 1981, he was made chairman of the anti-nuclear Labour Party Defence Study Group.

==Keep Left and Keeping Left==
In early 1947 a small number of the &#x27;King&#x27;s Speech dissenters&#x27; in the Labour Party formed the &#x27;Keep Left&#x27; group and met on a regular basis during that year. Along with Richard Crossman, Michael Foot and Konni Zilliacus, Mikardo published a pamphlet of the same name in May 1947 in which the authors criticized the United States cold war policies and urged a closer relationship with Europe in order to create a &quot;Third Force&quot; in politics. This included the idea of nuclear disarmament and the formation of a European Security Treaty. During the period of office of Clement Attlee&#x27;s Labour government, the Keep Left group attempted, through discussion and pamphlets, to produce practical proposals informed by socialist values. The group survived until April 1951. After that month&#x27;s ministerial resignations it became one element within the much larger Bevanite faction.

Keep Left&#x27;s concern was with modernisation and socialist ethics. This was evident in Harold Wilson&#x27;s governments in the 1960s. Such sentiments contributed to ministerial conflicts with the trade unions over incomes policy and most thoroughly over Barbara Castle&#x27;s proposals for trade union reform. The vision of a more rational and ethical society discussed by a group of talented young politicians two decades earlier was at odds with sentiments deeply rooted in their party.

==Mikardo Committee on the Docks==

The Mikardo Committee on the docks was set up by the Labour Party. Mikardo served on it, along with Andrew Cunningham, leader of the General, Municipal, Boilermakers and Allied Trade Union (GMB) in north-east England, John Hughes, of Ruskin College, Oxford, Jack Jones, later general secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union then directly responsible for dockers, Michael Montague, later of the English Tourist Board, and Peter Shore MP.

A report in March 1965 exposed the problems of the docks industry. It recommended total restructuring of the docks under public ownership and with a system of decentralisation and workers&#x27; participation in management wider than for any other industry. The 1966 Labour Cabinet accepted the report. George Brown fought hard for it against ministerial resistance. However, the Labour government was unable to produce the Ports Bill until the last session of that parliament. The Bill when it came was a disappointment it was a long way short of implementing the proposals. Had the committee&#x27;s proposals been put into practice, the seamen&#x27;s strike and its crippling effect on the economy might have been avoided. Sourness was created in the Labour movement by suggestions of &#x27;Reds under the bed&#x27;. It created the conditions for Labour&#x27;s defeat in 1970.

==Reselection of MPs==
During the debates about reselection of MPs in the Labour Party in the late 1970s, he put forward the &quot;Mikardo position&quot;, an attempted compromise which was adopted by the Labour Party conference in 1978. However this was overturned at the 1979 conference, which adopted full mandatory reselection of MPs.

==The Belgrano Enquiry - Parliamentary Select Committee==
Mikardo outlined in the House of Commons attempts by some members of the Parliamentary Select Committee, of which he was a member, to find the truth about the sinking of &quot;General Belgrano&quot; during the Falklands War.

The Foreign Affairs Select Committee&#x27;s minority report was published in 1984. Mikardo complained that dogmatic views were being expressed. He stated that he had spent months going through all the evidence, but still could not make up his mind about the truth. He complained that other members who had not looked at all the evidence could not be so sure and dogmatic. He complained that information was being withheld and this would devalue its work and its report. Mikardo accused the government of lying to the House, to the Select Committee and to the country. This followed revelations from the trial of Clive Ponting. He also stated that a civil servant had advised Ministers to deceive the Select Committee by withholding information. Mikardo quoted one of the reasons given for withholding, namely that the rules of engagement would have to be paraphrased considerably or they would be almost incomprehensible to the layman. Mikardo stated that the rules had been given to the War Cabinet whose members were all laymen and the rules had been fully understood by them. The Secretary of State subsequently agreed that it was nonsense and he had now given the rules to the Select Committee.

Mikardo stated that a number of people had said that they could not understand why the Government had prosecuted Clive Ponting (who had been acquitted). Mikardo stated that the government&#x27;s lying to the House of Commons was in the national interest. He stated that they wanted to protect themselves against criticism from the Select Committee, and others, and to be able to say that, however reprehensible, it was done in the national interest. Mikardo stated that the acquittal of Ponting got rid of that. Twelve British citizens had dismissed the judge&#x27;s opinion, shared by the prime minister and some of her ministers, that the national interest is whatever the government of the day want to do. Mikardo stated: &quot;That is a monstrous doctrine because it confers on a Government a cachet of papal infallibility. I do not doubt that all Governments do what they judge to be in the national interest, but no Government have the right to assume that their judgment can never be wrong. No Government should assume that they can never be wrong and that what they do cannot sometimes, therefore, vary from the national interest. As has been said, that is the cherished doctrine of General Pinochet and of General Jaruzelski. It is the codex of all courts in police states. Before the time of our present Prime Minister and Mr Justice McCowan, that doctrine was unheard of in our country.&quot;

John Browne (MP for Winchester) asked: &quot;What greater test can any Government face than to fight a military campaign and have a disloyal adviser in a key area of defence? I am reminded of the betrayal of the Spartans at Thermopylae to the Persians. In what other country would the Government have to balance disclosure against national security in such a blaze of examination, comment and publicity?&quot;

Mikardo responded: &quot;The United States.&quot;

Browne: &quot;No, not the President.&quot;

Mikardo: &quot;Yes.&quot; (Sinking of the General Belgrano, Hansard, 18 February 1985) See also: ARA General Belgrano: Controversy over the sinking

==Poale Zion of Britain and the Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland==

Mikardo and his wife were immersed in Jewish causes and help for Israel, which they often visited. He worked with Mapam, the Israeli United Workers&#x27; Party, and abhorred gratuitous provocation of the Palestinian Arabs. Instances include:

* 7 March 1948: At the opening of the annual conference of the Poale Zion of Great Britain, Mikardo revealed that a vote of &quot;no-confidence&quot; would be sought against the government by some members of the British Labour Party when the bill to terminate the Palestine Mandate had its second reading in the House of Commons.
* 21 July 1950: Mikardo asked in Parliament that the British Government&#x27;s policy on providing arms to Egypt be revised. Mikardo pointed out that arms shipments to Egypt were premised on their use in collective defence and that Egypt had made it very clear that it would not join the collective effort on Korea. Kenneth Younger, the government spokesman on foreign affairs, declared that the government was not contemplating changing its policy of supplying arms to Egypt.
* 16 January 1951: Mikardo commented on an article he had written which included a suggestion for Britain to have a military base in Israel.
* 11 July 1952: Labour Party leaders praised the courage and enthusiasm of the new State of Israel and said that it would overcome the great odds which it faces. They were speaking at a reception given by Labour MPs in honour of a Histadrut delegation of 62 American and Canadian Jews en route to Israel. They stressed the close relations between the Israeli and British Labour movements. Speakers included Arthur Greenwood, treasurer of the British Labour Party, Glenville Hall, chairman of its Parliamentary caucus, Alice Bacon, former party chair and Ian Mikardo.
* 1953: Mikardo questioned Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill on anti-Jewish discrimination at the Mid Ocean Club in Bermuda.

Most species of &quot;Pheidole&quot; are dimorphic, which means that colonies contain two castes of workers, the &quot;minor&quot; workers, and the &quot;major&quot; workers, or &quot;soldiers&quot;. The latter generally have much larger heads and mandibles in comparison to their usually fairly modest body size.
In addition, as in other ant species, a colony may contain one or several queens, and also in mature colonies, alates - virgin winged females and males.
== Major workers ==

The distinctive major workers have earned the genus &quot;Pheidole&quot; the nickname of &quot;big-headed ants&quot;. The major workers of a &quot;Pheidole&quot; colony, while they may look fierce, are often quite shy and are often the first to flee on any hint of danger. Many &quot;Pheidole&quot; species are the prey of parasitoid phorid flies that lay their eggs on the major workers; the fly larvae grow mainly in the head capsules of the victims, eventually decapitating them, and probably would starve in the bodies of minor workers.

In most cases, the major workers are employed within the nest to break up large food items, or outside to carry large items, such as seeds; many &quot;Pheidole&quot; species are ecologically important seed consumers (&quot;harvesters&quot;).

<text>The Clementine literature (also referred to as the Clementine Romance or Pseudo-Clementine Writings) is a late antique third-century Christian romance or &quot;novel&quot; containing a fictitious account of the conversion of Clement of Rome to Christianity, his subsequent life and travels with the apostle Peter and an account of how they became traveling companions, Peter&#x27;s discourses, and finally Clement&#x27;s family history and eventual reunion with his family. To reflect the pseudonymous nature of the authorship, the author is sometimes referred to as Pseudo-Clement. In all likelihood, the original text went by the name of &quot;Periodoi Petrou&quot; or Circuits of Peter; sometimes historians refer to it as the &quot;Basic Writing&quot; or &quot;Grundschrift&quot;.

Though lost, the original survives in two recensions known as the &quot;Clementine Homilies&quot; and the &quot;Clementine Recognitions&quot;. The overlap between the two has been used to produce a provisional reconstruction of the Circuits of Peter. Respectively, the original titles for these two texts were the &quot;Klementia&quot; and the &quot;Recognitions of the Roman Clement&quot;. Both were composed in the fourth-century. In turn, there was plausibly a second-century document (referred to as the &quot;Kerygmata Petrou&quot; or &quot;Preaching of Peter&quot;) that was used as a source for the original Clementine literature text. The &quot;Kerygma&quot; are thought to consist of a letter from Peter to James, lectures and debates of Peter, and James&#x27;s testimony about the letters recipients.

Some believe that the original was lost due to the substantially greater popularity of its recensions in the &quot;Homilies&quot; and &quot;Recognitions&quot;. These were so popular that translations and recensions of them appeared in Syriac, Greek, Latin, Ethiopic, Arabic, Slavonic, and Georgian. Vernacular versions also appeared in Icelandic, Old Swedish, Middle High German, Early South English, and Anglo-Norman.

==Overview==
Two versions of this romance have survived:

* &quot;Clementine Homilies&quot; (&quot;H&quot;), consisting of the &quot;Epistle of Peter&quot;, the &quot;Adjuration&quot; (or &quot;Contestation&quot;) and finally the &quot;Epistle of Clement&quot;, all followed by twenty numbered books. The books are each called a &quot;Homily&quot;, but more accurately, they are theological-philosophical dialogues.
* &quot;Clementine Recognitions&quot; (&quot;R&quot;), for which the original Greek has been lost but exists in a Latin translation produced by Tyrannius Rufinus in 406.

Quotations of the original are also available from the writings of Origen, the &quot;Apostolic Constitutions&quot; of Epiphanius, the &quot;Chronicon Paschale&quot;, and possibly, the &quot;Cave of Treasures&quot; and the writings of Lactantius.

Two later epitomes of the &quot;Homilies&quot; also exist, and there is a partial Syriac translation, which includes passages from both the &quot;Recognitions&quot; (specifically books 1–3), and the &quot;Homilies&quot; (books 10–14), preserved in two Syriac British Library manuscripts, one of which was written in the year 411. Fragments of the Clementine literature are also known in Arabic, Classical Armenian, and Old Church Slavonic. Though &quot;H&quot; and &quot;R&quot; largely correspond in wording and content, and have a similar length and framework, there is material that is distinctive to both.

It is now almost universally held that &quot;H&quot; and &quot;R&quot; are two versions of an original and longer Clementine romance that largely covered the content in the extant versions.

== Law ==
Gentile and Jewish law is an important focus of the Clementine literature. It sharpens the divide between the two forms of these laws as was earlier witnessed in the canonical Acts of the Apostles. Jews need to follow all of the Law of Moses described in the Torah (though they are not discussed in detail) whereas gentiles need to follow the teachings of Jesus. However, unlike previous writings which comment on gentile and Jewish law, the Clementine literature goes further insofar as it holds the position that Jews do not need Jesus to attain salvation; in turn, gentiles do not need the Law of Moses either. Hence, the text endorses an ethnic separation between Jews and gentiles. The Homilies even say that a pagan might be saved through temperance and virtue (13.20.2). For the Clementine literature, Mosaic law has an ongoing validity despite what it believes to have been some partial level of corruption after it was composed. In addition, gentiles are subject to attacks by demons if they fail to follow gentile law as modelled off of the Decrees of the Apostles. Jesus, whose purpose was to save the gentiles, is himself said to confirm the Law, but also abrogate parts of it that were erroneously added. Beyond the stipulations of the Decree of the Apostles, it is also stipulated that one must wash after sexual intercourse and perhaps before prayer. Pigs and wine are associated with demons.

== Christology and prophetology ==
In the Homilies, all prophets are instantiations of the same pre-existent divine being, but in different bodies. Only the last one of these, Jesus, is the Messiah. The Recognitions also state that the heavenly pre-existent Jesus &quot;took a Jewish body and was born among the Jews.&quot; This idea is likely to have originated from the Book of Elchasai written in the early second century, where all prophets are incarnations of the same pre-existent Christ in different bodies, all bearing the same message, but again only the last of them being the Messiah. In turn, the Elchasaites thought that the pre-existent Christ was the first angel, created by God.

The prophets serve as an important conduit by which the Pseudo-Clementine describes its christology. In particular, seven prophets from the Torah are repeatedly mentioned as ideal figures, whose authority is accepted: Adam, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses. Other figures are not included. For example, John the Baptist (Homilies 2.23) is portrayed negatively as the teacher of Simon Magus, who in turn is the arch-villain of the novel. The view of these prophets is very high, as the sins they are described as having committed in the Old Testament are denied. More importantly, these prophets, who are called &quot;the seven pillars of the world&quot;, are actually forms by which the pre-existent Jesus himself appeared. Jesus also appeared to these prophets. The Clementine literature also describes Jesus in a way that contrasts starkly with his portrayal in other extant sources. It says little of his life, crucifixion, resurrection, or Messianism. Jesus is frequently designated as the &quot;True Prophet&quot;. And although the True Prophet is &quot;full of divinity&quot; and is the &quot;son of God&quot;, he himself is not God &quot;nor did he proclaim himself that he was God&quot;.

== Cosmology ==
The Clementine literature speaks of cosmology, including in section 1.27–71 of the Syriac version. In so doing, it primarily follows the Genesis creation narrative: God creates the heavens and the Earth; creates the firmament to divide the heavenly waters into the upper and lower waters; partitions the cosmos into one abode for angels and another abode for humans; creates a separation between dry land and the seas; then creates mountains, rivers, springs, and other structures to provide a suitable living space for humans; adorns the heavens with stars; creates the sun and moon to provide light and to follow one another; creates living things which culminates in the making of man. The firmament is said to be made of solid ice occupying the space between the Earth and the first heaven. Furthermore, the Clementine literature describes the sun and moon as &quot;indicators&quot; insofar as they constitute signs (as opposed to causes) of the events to come on Earth. This coincides with the views of the church father Origen. Furthermore, Abraham is depicted as an astrologer who teaches astrology to the Egyptian kings.

The Clementine literature occasionally describes the cosmology of pagans. Two parallel episodes occur in the Recognitions, 10:17 and 10:30, which describes a myth analogous to the cosmic egg in association with traditions attached to Orpheus: there is first a primordial chaos which, over time, solidified into an egg. As is with an egg, a creature began to grow inside, until at some point it broke open to produce a human that was both male and female (i.e. androgynous) named Phanetas. When Phanetas appeared, a light shone forth that resulted in &quot;subsance, prudence, motion, and coition,&quot; and these in turn resulted in the creation of the heavens and the earth. In the first account, the description of the myth is attributed to Clement, who finds it to be ridiculous. In the second account, it is described in a serious manner by a &quot;good pagan&quot; named Nicetas.

== Redactional history ==
A substantial part of the first book of &quot;R&quot; (chs. 27–71) differs from the form and content of the rest of the work and appears to involve the addition of at least three originally distinct works:
* A creation account and history of Israel terminating with the coming of Jesus (chs. 27–42).
* A treatise dealing with the question of whether Jesus should be understood as &quot;the eternal Christ&quot;, and discusses his priestly and salvatory role (chs. 44–52). This contains material similar to the Epistle to the Hebrews and the First Epistle to the Thessalonians.
* A section which may correspond to material in the &quot;Ascents of James&quot; according to Epiphanius of Salamis (chs. 53–71). 
It is also possible that redactions on the part of Gnostics and Ebionites may have contributed to the redactional history of the Clementine literature.

==Date==
Scholarly hypotheses have placed the date of the &quot;Clementine Recognitions&quot; and &quot;Homilies&quot; between the second and fourth centuries. The earliest manuscripts, composed in the Syriac language, are from the fifth century. In 406, Tyrannius Rufinus produced a translation of the text from Greek into Latin. For these reasons, the present consensus places these texts in the mid-fourth century, originating perhaps in Syria.

An entry on the Clementine literature in the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; provides an extensive overview of the literature on the date of these texts up until 1908, when the entry was originally written.

==Reception and influence==

The earliest witness to the Clementine literature is found in the works of Eusebius:And now some have only the other day brought forward other wordy and lengthy compositions as being Clement&#x27;s, containing dialogues of Peter and Appion, of which there is absolutely no mention in the ancients.

&quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot;, 3.38Next we find the Clementines used by Ebionites c. 360. They are quoted as the &quot;Periodi&quot; by St. Jerome in 387 and 392 (On Galatians 1:18, and &quot;Adv. Jovin.&quot;, 1:26). Around 408, Paulinus of Nola in a letter to Rufinus mentions having himself translated a part or all, perhaps as an exercise in Greek. The &quot;Opus imperfectum&quot; above mentioned has five quotations. It is apparently by an Arian of the beginning of the 5th century, possibly by a bishop called Maximus.

=== Translations ===

==== Syriac ====
The Syriac recension combines text from the Recognitions and Homilies: the first part corresponds to Recognitions 1–3, whereas the second part corresponds to Homilies 10–14, although into this second section the editor occasionally imports phrases and clauses from Recognitions 7. In addition, Homilies 12.25–33 is omitted, and instead of Homilies 13, picks up at Recognitions 7.25–32 before resuming to Homilies 13.8.1. The editor not only mixed portions of the two texts, which were both available to him, but also at times summarized the text especially when differences existed between the accounts.

The Syriac recension of the Clementine literature had already been composed in the early fifth century at the latest, as one Syriac language manuscript (Brit. Libr. Add. 12,150) containing substantial portions of the text already appears in 411. The Syriac translation of the Recognitions was also known to Ephrem the Syrian in his &quot;Commentary on the Diatessaron&quot; from 373, and so it must predate this time as well. Another Syriac manuscript (Brit. Libr. Add. 14,609) containing an entirely independent translation of it then appears again in the 6th century. The &quot;Apostolic Constitutions&quot; also found their way into the Octateuch of Clement which was translated into Syriac in the 7th century. Eastern Christian tradition was widely influenced by the Syriac version of this text. These Syriac manuscripts provide a witness to the text of the Pseudo-Clementines over half a millennium older than the oldest extant Greek manuscripts.

==== Latin ====
C. 400, the monk and theologian Rufinus also translated both texts of the Clementine literature into Latin. This translation is the primary strand by which the Recognitions have survived today.

==== Arabic and Ge&#x27;ez ====
Translations were also made into Ge&#x27;ez and Arabic.

=== Quran ===
Holger Zellentin has studied the intertextuality of the Quran vis-a-vis the Clementine literature in the field of Quranic studies. Insofar as the Judeo-Christian group as described according to the Didascalia Apostolorum can be corroborated in the Clementine literature, such practices are also found in the Quran. Nevertheless, despite the congruences, the Quran is not to be framed within a notion of a Jewish Christianity but within broader late antique Christian discourses which encapsulated these ideas.

* According to the Quran, jinn are created from fire. The Clementine literature claims that there are various classes of angels and that the lowest class of them mixed with humans; upon doing so and becoming accustomed to their sinful lifestyles, they were transformed into fire and flesh (&quot;Pseudo-Clementines&quot;, 8:13).
* Both the Clementine literature and the Quran forbid consumption of carrion (dead carcasses), animals eaten or mangled by other animals, and divided meat. The Quran appears to continue the trend found earlier in the Clementine literature of providing increasingly specific dietary restrictions.
* Both propound the notion of purification, including maintaining ritual purity by abstaining from sex with a woman until after they complete their cycle of menstruation. 
* Despite their long list of purity laws, both remain silent on the question of circumcision. In addition, both texts only consider Shabbat incumbent on Jews, but not on gentiles.

=== Modern times ===
William Gaddis&#x27;s first novel &quot;The Recognitions&quot; takes its name, and inspiration, from these works. While writing a short parody of &quot;Faust&quot; in 1948, Gaddis read James Frazer&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Bough&quot;, where he learned that Goethe&#x27;s plot for &quot;Faust&quot; was derived from the Clementine &quot;Recognitions&quot;. Gaddis noted that this first Christian novel was a work that posed as one having been written by a disciple of St. Peter. Thus it was an original work posed as something else, in some sense a fraud, became a source for the Faust legend. From this point, Gaddis began to expand his work on &quot;Faust&quot; as a full novel.

<doc id="664632" wikidata="Q1347754" url="?curid=664632" title="Pastrami">
<text>Pastrami is a type of cured meat originating from Romania usually made from beef brisket. The raw meat is brined, partially dried, seasoned with herbs and spices, then smoked and steamed. Like corned beef, pastrami was created as a way to preserve meat before the invention of refrigeration. One of the iconic meats of Eastern European cuisine as well as American Jewish cuisine and New York City cuisine, hot pastrami is typically served at delicatessen restaurants on sandwiches such as the pastrami on rye.

==Etymology and origin==

The name pastrami likely comes from the Romanian verb &quot;a păstra&quot;, meaning to preserve or to keep, referencing a traditional method of meat preservation prevalent before refrigeration. Ultimately, it was probably derived from the Turkish, Greek, and Serbo-Croatian pastirma and &quot;bastırma&quot; meaning &quot;to press&quot;.

Pastrami was introduced to the United States in a wave of Jewish immigration from Bessarabia and Romania in the second half of the 19th century, with the Yiddish &quot;pastrame&quot;. The modified &quot;pastrami&quot; spelling was probably introduced in imitation of the American English salami. Romanian Jews emigrated to New York as early as 1872. Among Jewish Romanians, goose breasts were commonly made into pastrami because they were available. Beef navel was cheaper than goose meat in America, so the Romanian Jews in America adapted their recipe and began to make the cheaper alternative beef pastrami.

New York&#x27;s Sussman Volk is generally credited with producing the first pastrami sandwich in the United States in 1887. Volk was a kosher butcher and New York immigrant from Lithuania. According to his descendant Patricia Volk, he prepared pastrami according to the recipe of a Romanian friend and served it on sandwiches out of his butcher shop. The sandwich was so popular that Volk converted the butcher shop into a restaurant to sell pastrami sandwiches.
==Preparation and serving==
 Beef plate is the traditional cut of meat for making pastrami, although it is now common in the United States to see it made from beef brisket, beef round, and turkey. New York pastrami is generally made from beef navel, which is the ventral part of the plate. It is cured in brine, coated with a mix of spices such as garlic, coriander, black pepper, paprika, cloves, allspice, and mustard seed, and then smoked. Finally, the meat is steamed until the connective tissues within the meat break down into gelatin.While pastrami is more commonly made with the fat-marbled navel or plate cut, Montreal smoked meat is made with variable-fat brisket. This is because &quot;navel is much harder to find in Canada because of its British beef cut tradition&quot;. The use of brisket means that smoked meat is &quot;not fattier throughout the cut, but it has a larger cap of fat, and it has a stringier texture, more fibrous. American-style pastrami is more marbled with fat and has a denser texture.&quot;
Greek immigrants to Salt Lake City in the early 1960s introduced a cheeseburger topped with pastrami and a special sauce. The pastrami cheeseburger has since remained a staple of local burger chains in Utah.

<doc id="664635" wikidata="Q3658753" url="?curid=664635" title="Carl Eller">
<text>Carl Eller (born January 25, 1942) is an American former professional football player who played as a defensive end in the National Football League (NFL) from 1964 through 1979. He was born in Winston-Salem, North Carolina and played college football for the Minnesota Golden Gophers. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2004.

== Early life ==
Eller was born on January 25, 1942, in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Eller&#x27;s family was poor, and his father died when Eller was young. Early in his Professional Football Hall of Fame acceptance speech, Eller acknowledges how great his parents were in his life. He attended Atkins High School, where he excelled in football, and was inspired and given direction by his high school football coaches. He got the nickname &quot;Moose&quot; while playing sandlot football around the same time. 

==College career==
He was recruited to the University of Minnesota by head coach Murrary Warmath. Eller played defensive tackle from 1961-1963, and began starting in his sophomore year (1961), playing with a broken hand that year. In 1961 and 1962, Eller played tackle alongside future NFL great and fellow North Carolinian Bobby Bell, the 1962 Outland Trophy winner.

As a sophomore, on January 1, 1962, Eller helped lead the Golden Gophers to a 21–3 Rose Bowl victory over UCLA. While Eller shared the starting position as a sophomore, he became a full-time, two-way player as a junior and senior and was voted All-America both years. As a junior in 1962, he was second team All-Big Ten, and the following year Eller was a consensus All-American and first team All-Big Ten. In 1963, he also won the school&#x27;s Bronko Nagurski Award as the team&#x27;s most valuable player. As a senior (1963), Eller was the runner-up for the Outland Trophy. 

During his freshman year in college, the 1960 Gophers were National Champions and Big Ten Champions, though he did not play on that team.

At the University of Minnesota, Eller joined the Mu chapter of the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. 

==Professional career==
In 1964, Eller was selected in the first round of the NFL draft by the Minnesota Vikings (6th overall). He was also selected in the first round of the American Football League draft by the Buffalo Bills (5th overall), who could not sign him. As the left defensive end in the Vikings front four, he was a major factor in the unit known as the &quot;Purple People Eaters&quot; (the other members being Alan Page, Jim Marshall and Gary Larsen).

Starting in 1968, Eller&#x27;s fifth campaign, Minnesota won 10 Central Division titles in the next 11 seasons. The Vikings won the NFL Championship in 1969, losing to the AFL Champion Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl IV. The Vikings also won the NFC Championships in 1973, 1974, and 1976, but lost in the Super Bowl each year. Eller was one of 11 Vikings to play in all four of their Super Bowls.

He was selected to play in six Pro Bowls (1968–1971, 1973, and 1974). After being traded with an eighth-round pick to Seattle Seahawks for defensive tackle Steve Niehaus, Eller played his final season in 1979 with the Seattle Seahawks, where he ran his career total to 225 games. In his career, &quot;Moose&quot; only missed three games and started 209 out of the 225 he played.

Eller is credited as the Vikings&#x27; all-time sack leader with 130½. He also had 3 sacks with the Seahawks in 1979 for a career total of 133½. He set a career high with 15 sacks in 1969 and matched that total in 1977; he also amassed 7 seasons with 10 or more sacks. He recovered 23 fumbles during his career.

Eller was First-team All-NFL from 1968 to 1971, and again in 1973. He was also Second-team All-Pro in 1967 and 1972 and was named first team All-NFC by the AP, UPI, and The Sporting News in 1975. Including his Pro Bowls, Eller had a nine-year consecutive streak of post-season honors which began in 1967 with his Second-team All-Pro selection and ended in 1975 with his All-NFC honors. He was named to the Pro Football Hall of Fame 1970s All-Decade Team.

He was voted the winner of the George Halas Trophy in 1971 as the NFL&#x27;s Defensive Player of the Year as awarded by the Newspaper Enterprise Association.

== Honors and awards ==
In 2004, Eller was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2006. In 2000, Eller was named to the Vikings&#x27; 40th Anniversary Team and in 2010, he was named to the Vikings&#x27; 50th Anniversary team. Beginning in 1984, following each football season, the Carl Eller Award is given to the University of Minnesota&#x27;s Defensive Player of the Year. In 1992, he was inducted into the University of Minnesota&#x27;s M Club Hall of Fame.

In 2003, he was named to the Professional Football Researchers Association Hall of Very Good in the association&#x27;s inaugural HOVG class. 

==Life after football==

As a licensed drug and alcohol counselor, Eller founded a group of substance-abuse clinics in the Twin Cities called Triumph Life Centers in 1986.
He obtained a college degree in Human Services from Metropolitan State University in 1994 and went on to work for the Minnesota Department of Human Services, addressing issues of health disparities between white people and people of color.

Eller was arrested in 2006 for driving under the influence and pleaded guilty. He was arrested in 2008 for fourth-degree assault of a police officer and second-degree refusal to submit to chemical testing, both gross misdemeanors. He was sentenced and served 60 days in the county workhouse.

Eller later served as president of the NFL Retired Players Association. In 2020, he joined the Halberd Corporation, a research-based publicly traded company that helps discover and develop medical treatments for diseases, as a consultant.

<text>The eotvos is a unit of acceleration divided by distance that was used in conjunction with the older centimetre–gram–second system of units (cgs). The eotvos is defined as 10−9 galileos per centimetre. The symbol of the eotvos unit is E.

In SI units or in cgs units, 1 eotvos = 10−9 second−2.

The gravitational gradient of the Earth, that is, the change in the gravitational acceleration vector from one point on the Earth&#x27;s surface to another, is customarily measured in units of eotvos. The Earth&#x27;s gravity gradient is dominated by the component due to Earth&#x27;s near-spherical shape, which results in a vertical tensile gravity gradient of 3,080 E (an elevation increase of 1 m gives a decrease of gravity of about 0.3 mGal), and horizontal compressive gravity gradients of one half that, or 1,540 E. Earth&#x27;s rotation perturbs this in a direction-dependent manner by about 5 E. Gravity gradient anomalies in mountainous areas can be as large as several hundred eotvos.

The eotvos unit is named for the physicist Loránd Eötvös, who made pioneering studies of the gradient of the Earth&#x27;s gravitational field.

<text>The Eagle Point Bridge was a very narrow two-lane automobile bridge that connected urban Dubuque, Iowa, and rural Grant County, Wisconsin. It was part of the US 61/US 151 route, and was a toll bridge. After the new Dubuque–Wisconsin Bridge was built in 1983, the Eagle Point Bridge was torn down. At the end, the toll was ten cents, both ways, collected on the Iowa side.

The bridge was located about south of Lock and Dam No. 11, at the northern edge of Rhomberg Avenue in Dubuque, and connected to Eagle Point Road on the opposite side of the river. It was about north of the present bridge. In 1968, the highway designation was removed from the bridge and a four-ton load limit was put in place.
The bridge was still structurally sound after the new bridge was built, leading some to ask the bridge be kept open as a pedestrian or special use bridge, but the state of Iowa still tore the bridge down.

Several years after the demolition of the bridge, a restaurant known as the Tollbridge Inn was constructed at what was the Iowa end of the bridge. The restaurant operated for a number of years, until it was torn down to make way for future development.

The bridge was extensively documented in 1982 for the Historic American Engineering Record, archived at the Library of Congress. The documentation includes 81 black-and-white photos and 39 data pages detailing construction and history of the bridge.

<text>SCISAT-1 is a Canadian satellite designed to make observations of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Its main instruments are an optical Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, the ACE-FTS Instrument, and an ultraviolet spectrophotometer, MAESTRO. These devices record spectra of the Sun, as sunlight passes through the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, making analyses of the chemical elements of the atmosphere possible.

==Design and construction==
SCISAT is a relatively small satellite weighing . It is partly drum shaped and measures about 1.5 metres by 1.5 metres. The Canadian Space Agency (CSA) coordinated its design, launch and use. The main contractors were Bristol Aerospace of Winnipeg, Manitoba, who were prime contractor for the bus, and ABB Bomem Inc. of Quebec City, Quebec who developed the ACE-FTS instrument. The total development cost of SCISAT, as estimated by the CSA in 2003, was about CDN$60M. As of years after launch, the satellite and its instruments are still operating.

===ACE-FTS===
The ACE-FTS instrument is the main payload of the SCISAT-1 spacecraft. The primary scientific goal of the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE) is to measure and understand the chemical and dynamical processes that control the distribution of ozone in the upper troposphere and stratosphere. The principle of ACE measurement is the solar occultation technique. A high inclination (74 degrees), low Earth orbit will provide ACE coverage of tropical, mid-latitudes and polar regions.

The spectrometer is an adapted version of the classical Michelson interferometer using an optimized optical layout. Its highly folded double-pass optical design results in a very high performance instrument with a compact size. A signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) better than 100 is achieved, with a field-of-view (FOV) of 1.25 mrad and an aperture diameter of 100 mm (4&quot;). A semiconductor laser is used as the metrology source of the interferometer sub-system.

The auxiliary Visible/Near-infrared Imager (VNI) monitors aerosols based on the extinction of solar radiation using two filtered detectors at 0.525 and 1.02 micrometres. The instrument also includes a Suntracker mechanism providing fine pointing toward the radiometric center of the Sun with stability better than 3 μrad. The ACE-FTS instrument was launched on August 12, 2003.

ABB was the prime contractor for the design and manufacturing of the ACE-FTS instrument.

===MAESTRO===
The Measurements of Aerosol Extinction in the Stratosphere and Troposphere Retrieved by Occultation (MAESTRO) instrument aboard SCISAT-1 measures the vertical distribution of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, water vapour, and aerosols in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. MAESTRO consists of a UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer that measures the 285-1030 nm spectral region.

==Orbit==
SCISAT passes through the Earth&#x27;s shadow 15 times per day, profiting from the occultation of the Sun to make a spectrographic analysis of the structure and chemistry of those parts of the upper atmosphere that are too high to be reached by balloons and airplanes and too low to be visited by orbiting satellites. This kind of analysis can help understand the depletion of the ozone layer and other upper atmosphere phenomena.

SCISAT was placed in low Earth orbit, or LEO, by a Pegasus rocket launched from a NASA Lockheed L-1011 carrier aircraft on August 12, 2003 from Vandenberg Air Force Base. Expected to operate for two to five years, it was still operational in 2025. Current information may be obtained from the ACE Mission Information for Public Data Release report.

The University of Waterloo, York University, the University of Toronto, and several other Canadian universities collaborated in the design of the experiments, and in several aspects of the testing of the satellite.

<text>The gal (symbol: Gal), sometimes called galileo after Galileo Galilei, is a unit of acceleration typically used in precision gravimetry. The gal is defined as 1 centimeter per second squared (1 cm/s2). The milligal (mGal) and microgal (μGal) are respectively one thousandth and one millionth of a gal.

The gal is not part of the International System of Units (known by its French-language initials &quot;SI&quot;). In 1978 the CIPM decided that it was permissible to use the gal &quot;with the SI until the CIPM considers that [its] use is no longer necessary&quot;. Use of the gal was deprecated by the standard ISO 80000-3:2006, now superseded.

The gal is a derived unit, defined in terms of the centimeter–gram–second (CGS) base unit of length, the centimeter, and the second, which is the base unit of time in both the CGS and the modern SI system. In SI base units, 1 Gal is equal to 0.01 m/s2.

The acceleration due to Earth&#x27;s gravity at its surface is 976 to 983 Gal, the variation being due mainly to differences in latitude and elevation. Standard gravity is 980.665 Gal. Mountains and masses of lesser density within the Earth&#x27;s crust typically cause variations in gravitational acceleration of tens to hundreds of milligals (mGal). The gravity gradient (variation with height) above Earth&#x27;s surface is about 3.1 μGal per centimeter of height (), resulting in a maximal difference of about 2 Gal (0.02 m/s2) from the top of Mount Everest to sea level.

Unless it is being used at the beginning of a sentence or in paragraph or section titles, the unit name gal is properly spelled with a lowercase g. As with the torr and its symbol, the unit name (gal) and its symbol (Gal) are spelled identically except that the latter is capitalized.

<text>&quot;Marder&quot; III was the name for a series of World War II German tank destroyers. They mounted either the modified ex-Soviet 76.2 mm F-22 Model 1936 divisional field gun, or the German 7.5 cm PaK 40, in an open-topped fighting compartment on top of the chassis of the Czechoslovakian Panzer 38(t). They offered little protection to the crew, but added significant firepower, which was able to destroy the thick-armored T-34s, compared to contemporary German tanks. They were in production from 1942 to 1944 with three variants, the Marder III, Marder III H, and Marder III M, and served on all fronts until the end of the war, along with the similar Marder II. The German word &quot;Marder&quot; means &quot;marten&quot; in English.

==History==
In the early stages of Operation Barbarossa, the Wehrmacht felt the need for a more mobile and more powerful anti-tank solution than the existing towed anti-tank guns, such as the &quot;3.7 cm Pak 36&quot;, or self-propelled tank destroyers, such as the (mounted with the 4.7 cm PaK (t)). This need became urgent in 1942, when anti-tank shells fired from said anti-tank guns failed to penetrate the armor of new Soviet tanks, such as the T-34 and KV-1.

As an interim solution, it was decided to use captured French vehicles, such as the Lorraine (Marder I), obsolete tanks in surplus, such as the German Panzer II (Marder II), and Czech-&quot;supplied&quot; Panzer 38(t) (&quot;Marder&quot; III) as the base for the production of makeshift tank destroyers. The result was the &quot;Marder&quot; series, which were armed with either captured Soviet 76.2mm F-22 Model 1936 divisional field guns, or German 7.5 cm PaK 40 anti-tank guns mounted in later versions. Due to weight, space, and time constraints, the &quot;Marder&quot; series had relatively thin armor when compared with other armored vehicles of the era. This thin upper armor formed a gunshield, only protecting the crew from shrapnel and small arms fire on the front and sides. All &quot;Marder&quot; series had open tops—although some were issued with canvas tops to protect the crew from the elements. In this regard, the Marder was more of a gun carriage than a proper that could exchange fire with enemy tanks.

==Development==

=== &quot;Marder&quot; III, Sd.Kfz. 139 ===
While the Panzer 38(t) had largely become obsolete as a tank in early 1942, it was still an excellent and plentiful platform for adaptation into a tank destroyer, among other roles. Since the Soviet 76.2 mm field gun was captured in large quantities, the decision was made to mate this gun to the Panzer 38(t). The mass production of the Panzer 38(t) Ausf. G was halted, and a modified superstructure was bolted onto the standard tank chassis in lieu of a gun turret. This upper structure mounted the gun and an extended gun shield, giving only limited protection for the commander, gunner, and the loader. Armor protection overall ranged from 10 to 50 mm, with no armor at all above and behind the gun compartment, which the crew occupied. It had a higher silhouette than the original Panzer 38(t), which made it more vulnerable to enemy fire.
In German service, the Soviet gun was renamed 7.62 cm PaK 36(r), and rechambered for the more powerful German PaK 40 cartridge. Thirty rounds of ammunition were stored inside the vehicle. Apart from the main gun, there was a 7.92 mm machine gun mounted in the hull. This tank destroyer was put into production as the &quot; 38(t) für 7.62 cm PaK 36(r), Sd.Kfz. 139&quot;. A total of 344 vehicles were built in three series from April to November 1942. Chassis numbers were 1360–1479, 1527–1600, and 1601–1750.

===&quot;Marder&quot; III Ausf. H, &quot;Sd.Kfz&quot;. 138===
This next variant of the &quot;Marder&quot; III fielded the standard 7.5 cm PaK 40 German anti-tank gun on a slightly modified Panzer 38(t) Ausf. H chassis. This chassis still had the engine in the rear of the vehicle, but, unlike the previous model, this vehicle utilized the fighting compartment of the Panzer 38 in the center. This allowed the crew to stay low in the center of the vehicle, lowering their exposure to small arms fire and shell fragments. However, because of the rear-mounted engine, there was only enough room for two men to stand in the center. Large side armor gave additional protection for the crew. Despite this, the thin horseshoe-shaped armor only protected the front and sides; the rear and the top were exposed. Thirty-eight rounds of ammunition for the gun were carried. As with the Sd.Kfz.139, this vehicle also carried a Czech-manufactured 7.92 mm machine gun in the hull. The full name of the Ausf. H was the &quot;7.5 cm PaK 40/3 auf Panzerkampfwagen 38(t) Ausf. H, &quot;Sd.Kfz&quot;. 138&quot;. A total of 275 vehicles were built in two series from November 1942 to April 1943. An additional 175 vehicles were converted from Panzer 38(t)&#x27;s in 1943. Chassis numbers of new vehicles were 1751–2075 and 2121–2147 (overlapping with simultaneous Grille production).

===&quot;Marder&quot; III Ausf. M, &quot;Sd.Kfz&quot;. 138===
The last Marder III variant was based on the Geschützwagen 38(t) Ausf. M, a purpose-designed vehicle for self-propelled gun use, again armed with the 75 mm PaK 40 anti-tank gun. Ausf. M was the final variant of the Marder series, and was a significant improvement over previous models, with its lower silhouette, sloped armor, and much more functional fighting compartment. In this variant, the engine was moved from the rear to the middle between driver and the rest of the crew. Because there was no engine in the rear, the gun and the crew did not have to sit on top of the engine deck as in previous models. The fighting compartment could be lowered down to the bottom floor level where the engine used to be, which decreased crew exposure and visibility. Unlike the previous two &quot;Marder&quot; III variants, the fighting compartment was closed at the rear, protecting the crew up to their midsection. It stayed open-topped. The machine gun port at the front was eliminated in the &quot;Ausf&quot;. M in favor of an MG 34 or MG 42 carried by the crew. In the previous two models, the commander served as a gunner. However, in the Ausf. M, the radio man moved to the rear, with the commander and gunner, to serve as a loader. Only 27 rounds of 7.5 cm ammunition were carried, but combat effectiveness increased because the vehicle commander was freed from manning the gun.

The full name of the Ausf. M was &quot; 38(t) mit 7.5 cm PaK 40/3 Ausf. M, Sd.Kfz. 138 &quot;. It was the variant that was produced in the largest numbers, with 942 vehicles built in two series from May 1943 to May 1944. Chassis numbers were 2166–2600 and 2601–3600 (overlapping with simultaneous Grille and Flakpanzer 38(t) production).

==Combat history==

The various &quot;Marder&quot; IIIs fought on all European fronts and in North Africa, with the Sd. Kfz. 139 being used mainly at the Eastern Front, though some also fought in Tunisia. In February 1945, some 350 Ausf. M were still in service.

The &quot;Marder&quot; IIIs were used by the &quot; Abteilungen&quot; of the Panzer divisions of both the Heer and the Waffen SS, as well as several Luftwaffe units, such as the Hermann Göring division.

The &quot;Marder&quot; IIIs were mechanically reliable, as with all vehicles based on the Czechoslovak LT-38 chassis. Their firepower was sufficient to destroy the majority of Soviet tanks on the battlefield at combat range.

The &quot;Marder&quot; III&#x27;s weaknesses were mainly related to survivability. The combination of a high silhouette and open-top armor protection made them vulnerable to indirect artillery fire. The armor was also quite thin, making them highly vulnerable to enemy tanks, and to close-range machine gun fire.

The Marders were not assault vehicles or tank substitutes; the open top meant that operations in urban areas or other close-combat situations were very risky. They were best employed in defensive or overwatch roles. Despite their mobility, they did not replace the towed antitank guns.

In March 1942, before the &quot;Marder III&quot; appeared, Germany had already started production of the &quot;StuG III&quot; assault gun, which had comparable anti-tank capability (&quot;StuG III Ausf. F&quot; and later variants). These were fully armored vehicles, with the fighting compartment fully enclosed within an armored casemate, built in much greater numbers than the vulnerable &quot;Marder III&quot;. Among the many German casemated tank destroyers, one based on the Panzer 38(t) chassis was built in numbers from 1944: the &quot;Jagdpanzer 38(t)&quot;. The weakly-armored Marder series were phased out of production in favor of the Jagdpanzer 38(t), but Marder series vehicles served until the end of the conflict.

=== Slovak National Uprising ===
In June 1944, the army of the Slovak Republic received 18 &quot;Marder&quot; III Ausf. H. Four of them saw combat during the Slovak National Uprising. Two vehicles were used by the partisan brigade &quot;Čapajev&quot;. One of them was destroyed between the towns Vranov nad Topľou and Prešov. The second Marder was used in heavy fights near Hermanovce nad Topľou. Its commander, Rajták, suffered a gunshot wound, and the vehicle was subsequently abandoned.

The remaining two Marders were used by the Slovak insurgent army near Strečno, and they played an important role in the Battle of Strečno Gorge. One of the Marders, under the command of Private Matej Buc, destroyed three German tanks and two anti-tank guns. During the German assault on 3 September, Commander Matej Buc and loader Štefan Kováč, who were sitting in an open hull, were shot. However, the driver, František Smolnický, survived and escaped from the battlefield with the vehicle. It was repaired and reused in battle, but on 8 and 9 September, both Marders were destroyed in battle—one near Vrútky, and other one near Priekopa.

<doc id="664661" wikidata="Q7261446" url="?curid=664661" title="Purple People Eaters">
<text>The Purple People Eaters was the nickname given to the defensive line of the Minnesota Vikings from 1967 to 1977, consisting mainly of Alan Page, Carl Eller, Jim Marshall, and Gary Larsen.

The term is a reference to a popular song from 1958, the efficiency of the defense, and the color of their uniforms. The motto of the Purple People Eaters was &quot;Meet at the quarterback.&quot;

The Purple People Eaters mainly consisted of:

* Defensive tackle Alan Page, 9 Pro Bowl selections (1968–1976), NFL MVP (1971), Pro Football Hall of Fame
* Defensive end Carl Eller, 6 Pro Bowl selections (1968–1971, 1973–1974), Pro Football Hall of Fame
* Defensive end Jim Marshall, 2 Pro Bowl selections (1968–1969)
* Defensive tackle Gary Larsen, 2 Pro Bowl selections (1969–1970)

Larsen was replaced in 1974 by Doug Sutherland.

Marshall said that the players disliked the name &quot;Purple People Eaters&quot; and called themselves &quot;The Purple Gang&quot;, but &quot;we&#x27;ve got to ride with it because it&#x27;s our handle&quot;. The group was a major factor in the post-season success of the Vikings from the late 1960s through the 1970s. The Purple People Eaters were one of the most identifiable front fours in National Football League history, with the &quot;Fearsome Foursome&quot; of the Los Angeles Rams during the 1960s and early 1970s, the &quot;Steel Curtain&quot; of the Pittsburgh Steelers during the 1970s, the &quot;New York Sack Exchange&quot; of the New York Jets during the 1980s, and the “Monsters of the Midway&quot; of the Chicago Bears during the 1980s.

Eller and Page were inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Many people argue that Jim Marshall should be in the Hall of Fame as well.

==Building the Purple People Eaters==
When the Minnesota Vikings first came into the NFL in 1961, they picked up Jim Marshall from the Cleveland Browns during a number of early September trades that moved six Cleveland players to the Vikings for two 1962 draft picks. In 1964, Carl Eller was drafted in the first round. In the next season, they acquired Gary Larsen from the Los Angeles Rams. Then in 1967, the Vikings drafted Alan Page in the first round.

==Late 1960s and early 1970s==
The Purple People Eaters were a key part of a Vikings team that won 10 division titles in 11 years, leading to five NFC Championships and four Super Bowl appearances. In 1968, Marshall, Eller and Page all made the Pro Bowl as the defense collected 44 sacks (11 for Page, 10 for Larsen, 10 for Marshall and 8 for Eller), ranked 6th in the league in points allowed and played a big role in the Vikings winning their first division title. In week 2 against the Green Bay Packers, Marshall sacked Packers Quarterback Bart Starr in his own end zone for a safety, giving the Vikings a 16–0 lead. The Vikings won the game 26–13.

In 1969, Marshall, Eller, Page and Larsen all made the Pro Bowl as the defense sacked the opposing quarterback 49 times and ranked number 1 in both yards allowed and points allowed, Shutting out their opponents twice. In the last 7 games of the season, the Vikings defense only allowed 2 offensive touchdowns. Carl Eller led the league with 15 sacks, and Marshall had the second most with 14 (tied with Deacon Jones). On Thanksgiving against the Detroit Lions, Marshall and Page combined for one of the most remarkable plays in NFL history. Page tipped a pass which was intercepted by Marshall, who ran for 30 yards, then as he was being tackled, he lateraled the ball to Page who then ran 15 yards for a touchdown. The Vikings won the game 27–0. In the Western Conference championship game, the Vikings hosted the Los Angeles Rams. Late in the fourth quarter, the Vikings defense needed to protect a one-point lead. Eller extended the lead by sacking Rams quarterback Roman Gabriel in the end zone for a safety. The Rams got the ball back with still some time left to win, but Page intercepted Gabriel to put the game out of reach as the Vikings won 23–20. The win allowed the Vikings to advance to their first-ever NFL Championship against the Cleveland Browns. The Vikings dominated the game defeating the Browns 27–7. The Vikings advanced to Super Bowl IV but lost to the Kansas City Chiefs in a 23–7 upset.

The Vikings opened up the 1970 season in a Super Bowl IV rematch against the Chiefs. The Vikings defense dominated the game, limiting the Chiefs to 63 yards rushing and forcing four turnovers including a second quarter fumble forced by Eller, recovered by Marshall who then lateraled the ball to Roy Winston, who went on to score a touchdown en route to a 27–10 victory. The Vikings defense recorded 49 sacks and once again gave up the fewest yards and fewest points, recorded 2 shutouts, and only gave up 2 offensive touchdowns in the first 6 weeks of the season while scoring 3 defensive touchdowns in that span. Meanwhile, Page, Eller and Larsen all made the Pro Bowl. Page also led the league with seven fumble recoveries for 77 yards and a touchdown. His touchdown came in a week 4 game against the Chicago Bears. All four down linemen got to Bears quarterback Jack Concannon, Larsen &amp; Eller forced a fumble which was recovered by Page who returned it 65 yards for a touchdown. The Vikings won the game 24–0. Page also picked off Dallas Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach and returned it 27 yards in week 5. Late in the first half in a week 6 game against the Los Angeles Rams, The Vikings defense had their backs against the wall when the Rams had the ball at the Vikings 2-yard line after a 50-yard punt return by Kermit Alexander. However, the Vikings defense executed a key goal line stand by limiting the Rams to 1 yard on three straight running plays. The Vikings went on to win the game 13–3.

In 1971, The Vikings defense ranked second in fewest yards allowed and for the third year in a row, first in fewest points allowed, including 3 shutouts. That year, Eller was voted NEA NFL Defensive Player of the Year and to his fourth straight Pro Bowl. Meanwhile, Page became the first defensive player to be voted NFL MVP, and the only defensive lineman to ever earn the honor. Page&#x27;s MVP season was highlighted by his Week 13 performance against the Detroit Lions. In the second quarter, after being called for a personal foul and for roughing the passer on consecutive plays, Page sacked QB Greg Landry on first down. On second down, Page tackled Altie Taylor for a 4-yard loss. On third down, Page tackled Landry after a gain of two yards, ending the drive. In the fourth quarter, Page blocked a Lion punt out of the end zone for a safety. Page would score 2 other safeties that year. One in week 3 when he sacked Buffalo Bills quarterback Dennis Shaw in his own end zone, and in the Divisional Playoff game against the Cowboys by sacking Staubach in his own end zone.

==Three Super Bowls in four years==

With the Vikings intimidating line leading their defense and their future Hall of Fame quarterback Fran Tarkenton leading the offense, the Vikings went on to participate in Super Bowls VIII, IX, and XI, though the Vikings lost each one. In 1973, Eller became an All Pro for the fifth time in six years. Page meanwhile was named NEA Defensive Player of the Year as the Vikings ranked second in the league in points allowed. 
In the NFC Championship, The Vikings limited Dallas to 153 yards of
total offense, sacked Staubach 3 times and forced 6 turnovers including two fumble recoveries by Gary Larsen en route to a 27–10 victory. 
The Vikings returned to the Super Bowl for the second time in five years, ultimately falling to the Miami Dolphins by a score of 24–7.

In 1974, the Vikings ranked third in points allowed. That year Doug Sutherland started in place of Larsen (who was playing his last season) and continued for the next seven years. 
A turning point in the Divisional round against the St. Louis Cardinals, came in the third quarter when Page and Eller forced a fumble which was recovered and scored by defensive back Nate Wright. From there the Vikings scored 23 unanswered points en route to winning 30–14. Then in the NFC Championship against the Rams. Two back-to-back sacks ended a crucial drive for the Rams. First Eller and Sutherland combined for a sack, then Marshall, Page and Bob Lurtsema combined for the sack as the Vikings held on to win 14-10 and advance to Super Bowl IX, a 16–6 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers and their fabled Steel Curtain defense. Larsen retired after the 1974 season, thus making Super Bowl IX his last game.

In 1975, Page made his eighth consecutive Pro Bowl as the Vikings&#x27; defense recorded 46 sacks, ranked third in the league in points allowed, and became the first defense since the 1970 merger to be ranked number one against the run and the pass en route to winning another division title.

In 1976, The Vikings defense ranked second in points allowed, won another divisional title and made it to their third Super Bowl in four years (fourth overall). But for the fourth time, they lost, this time to the Oakland Raiders by a score of 32–14. That year, Page accounted for 18 of the Vikings 45 sacks and made his 9th consecutive Pro Bowl.

In 1977, The Vikings won yet another division title and made it to their fourth NFC Championship in five years. That year, Eller accounted for 15 of the Vikings 30 sacks. Eller also recorded a safety in week 2 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers when he sacked Buccaneers quarterback Randy Hedberg in his own endzone en route to a 9–3 victory.

==Retirement==
Alan Page played for the Vikings until 1978 where six games in he was waived and then signed by the Chicago Bears, who he played for until he retired after the 1981 season. As a Bear, Page collected 40 sacks. He was voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1988. After retirement Page became an attorney until 1992, when he was elected to the Minnesota Supreme Court, the first African-American to do so. He was re-elected 3 more times until his retirement in 2015 when turned 70, reaching the mandatory retirement age. In 2018 he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

Carl Eller also played with the Vikings until 1978, and one more season with the Seattle Seahawks before retiring after the 1979 season. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2004. About a decade later Eller went on to found various substance-abuse clinics in the Twin Cities area, named Triumph Life Centers. He acquired a degree in Human Services from Metropolitan State University in 1994. In 2020 Eller partnered with Halberd Corporation in work related to impact caused brain injuries such as PTSD and CTE.

Jim Marshall retired after the 1979 season with the Vikings, completing his 20th season, only missing 5 total games (all in his rookie year). Marshall was a finalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2004. In his last home game against the Buffalo Bills, Marshall collected two sacks and was carried off the field by his teammates in celebration. The Vikings won the game 10–3.

Gary Larsen retired in 1974 after 10 seasons with the Vikings.

Doug Sutherland remained with the Vikings until 1981 when he (like Eller) spent his last season with the Seahawks before retiring.

Along with Page and Eller being inducted to the Hall of Fame, the Purple People Eaters received several franchise accolades. Marshall, Eller and Page have been inducted the Vikings Ring of Honor, The Vikings retired numbers 88 and 70 to Page and Marshall respectively, Eller, Larsen, Page and Marshall were selected to the Vikings 25th Anniversary team, Eller, Page and Marshall were selected to the Vikings 40th Anniversary team, and Eller, Larsen, Page, Marshall and Sutherland were selected to be part of the 50 Greatest Vikings.

<doc id="664664" wikidata="Q468172" url="?curid=664664" title="Charles Horton Cooley">
<text>Charles Horton Cooley (August 17, 1864 – May 7, 1929) was an American sociologist. He was the son of Michigan Supreme Court Judge Thomas M. Cooley. He studied and went on to teach economics and sociology at the University of Michigan. 

He was a founding member of the American Sociological Association in 1905 and became its eighth president in 1918. He is perhaps best known for his concept of the looking-glass self, which is the concept that a person&#x27;s self grows out of society&#x27;s interpersonal interactions and the perceptions of others. 

==Biography==
Charles Horton Cooley was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on August 17, 1864, to Mary Elizabeth Horton and Thomas M. Cooley. Thomas Cooley was the Supreme Court Judge for the state of Michigan, and he was one of the first three faculty members to found the University of Michigan Law School in 1859. He served as dean of the law school from 1859 to 1884. Cooley&#x27;s mother, Mary, took an active interest in public affairs and traveled with her husband to several cities around the United States in relation to the Interstate Commerce Commission. His father was a very successful political figure who stressed the importance of education to his six children. Nevertheless, Cooley had a difficult childhood, which exacerbated his feelings of detachment towards his father. Cooley was a daydreamer and much of his &quot;dreaming-life&quot; had a substantial influence to his sociological works. As a child, he dealt with feelings of isolation and loneliness, which led him to develop an interest in reading and writing.

===Education===

At the age of sixteen, Cooley began attending the University of Michigan. Cooley graduated from the University of Michigan in 1897, and continued with a year&#x27;s training in mechanical engineering. Cooley returned to pursue a master&#x27;s degree in political science and sociology in 1890. Following completion, he began teaching economics and sociology at UMich in the fall of 1892. Cooley went on to receive a PhD in philosophy in 1894. At this time he was interested in the subject matter of sociology, but due to the University of Michigan not having a sociology department, he had to continue the examination of his PhD through Columbia University. There, Cooley worked closely alongside American sociologist and economist, Franklin Henry Giddings and developed his doctoral thesis, &quot;The Theory of Transportation&quot; in economics.

Since his father was honored nationwide, Cooley feared the idea of failure. He lacked direction in life and contemplated science, mathematics, social science, psychology or sociology as his field of study. He wished to write and think, and after reading philosopher Herbert Spencer&#x27;s works, Cooley realized he had an interest in social problems. He shared his reflections of the works of Spencer in 1920, citing that while he brought many valuable viewpoints with the subject of Darwinian principles, he lacks sympathy and the appropriate usage of the sociological perspective.

Cooley decided that he wanted to study sociology because it gave him the ability to analyze social discrepancies. He taught the University of Michigan&#x27;s very first sociology class in 1899. He also played a prominent role in the development of symbolic interactionism, in which he worked heavily with another fellow staff member from the University of Michigan, psychologist John Dewey.

==Theory==
===Cooley&#x27;s methodology===
Cooley is noted for his displeasure at the divisions within the sociological community over methodology. He preferred an empirical, observational approach. While he appreciated the use of statistics after working as a statistician in the Interstate Commerce Commission and Census Bureau, he preferred case studies: often using his own children as the subjects on his observation. He also encouraged sociologists to use the method of sympathetic introspection when attempting to understand the consciousness of an individual. Cooley thought that the only practical method is to study the actual situation &quot;closely&quot; and &quot;kindly&quot; with other people involved, then gradually work out the evil from the mixture and replace it with good. Basically, the only way to understand a grotesque human being is to identify how and why his human nature has come to work that way. He felt it was necessary in order to truly understand the activities taken from the actor, effectively separating Cooley from a majority of sociologists who preferred more traditional, scientific techniques.

=== Theory on transportation and the shift to sociology ===
Cooley&#x27;s first major work, &quot;The Theory of Transportation&quot; &quot;(1894)&quot;, was his doctoral dissertation on economic theory. In his thesis, he discussed industrial growth and expansion during the nineteenth century. This piece was notable for its conclusion that towns and cities tend to be located at the confluence of transportation routes—the so-called &quot;break&quot; in transportation. His debt to German sociologists, particularly Albert Schäffle, has remained largely underresearched. Cooley soon shifted to a broader analysis of the interplay of individual and social processes. In &quot;Human Nature and the Social Order&quot; (1902) he foreshadowed George Herbert Mead&#x27;s discussion of the symbolic ground of the self by detailing the way in which an individual&#x27;s active participation in society affects the emergence of normal social participation. Cooley greatly extended this conception of the &quot;looking-glass self&quot; (I am, who I think you think, that I am) in his next book, &quot;Social Organization&quot; (1909), in which he sketched a comprehensive approach to society and its major processes.

=== Social organization ===
The first sixty pages of &quot;Social Organization&quot; (1909) were a sociological antidote to Sigmund Freud. In that much-quoted segment, Cooley formulated the crucial role of primary groups (family, playgroups and community of elders) as the source of one&#x27;s morals, sentiments, and ideals. Primary groups are the first groups of individuals one is introduced to and are also influenced in their ideas and beliefs. They are the result of intimate association and corporation, along with coinciding ideals and values. He argued that individuals have two different channels of life- one from heredity and the other from society. Heredity is biological and predisposed; it is the human nature that people are born with. Society is the human nature that is expressed in primary groups that we can find in all civilizations. But the impact of a primary group is so great that individuals cling to shared beliefs in more complex associations, and even create new primary groupings within formal organizations.

In the &quot;Social Organization&quot;, Cooley asks what makes up a society. He focuses on the relationship between the individual and the larger unity of the society. He viewed society and the individual as one since they cannot exist without one another: where society has a strong impact on individual behavior and vice versa. He also concluded that the more industrialized a society becomes, the more individualistic its inhabitants are. Cooley viewed society as a constant experiment in enlarging social experience and in coordinating variety. He, therefore, analyzed the operation of such complex social forms as formal institutions and social class systems and the subtle controls of public opinion. Class differences reflect different contributions to society, as well as the phenomena of aggrandizement (the increase of power or reputation of individuals and values) and exploitation.

=== Cooley and social subjectivity ===
Cooley&#x27;s theories regarding social subjectivity were described in a threefold necessity that had developed within the realm of society. The first of which was the necessity to create an understanding of social phenomena that highlighted the subjective mental processes of individuals. Yet, Cooley realized that these subjective processes were both the causes and effects of society&#x27;s processes. The second necessity examined the development of a social dynamic conception that portrayed states of chaos as natural occurrences which could provide opportunities for &quot;adaptive innovation.&quot; Finally, a need to manifest publics that were capable of exerting some form of &quot;informed moral control&quot; over current problems and future directions.

In regards to these aforementioned dilemmas, Cooley responded by stating &quot;society and individual denote not separable phenomena but different aspects of the same thing, for a separate individual is an abstraction unknown to experience, and so likewise is society when regarded as something apart from individuals.&quot; From this, he resolved to create a &quot;Mental-Social&quot; Complex of which he would term the &quot;looking-glass self.&quot;

The looking-glass self is created through the imagination of how one&#x27;s self might be viewed through the eyes of another individual. This would later be termed &quot;empathic introspection.&quot; This theory not only applied to the individual, but to the macro-level economic issues of society and macro-sociological conditions that develop over time.

To the economy, Cooley presented a divergent view from the norm, stating that &quot;...even economic institutions could [not] be understood solely as a result of impersonal market forces.&quot; With regard to the sociological perspective and its relevancy toward traditions he states that the dissolution of traditions may be positive, thus creating &quot;the sort of virtues, as well as of vices, that we find on the frontier: plain dealing, love of character and force, kindness, hope, hospitality and courage.&quot; He believed that sociology continues to contribute to the &quot;growing efficiency of the intellectual processes that would enlighten the larger public will.&quot;

=== The &quot;looking-glass self&quot; ===

The &quot;looking-glass self&quot; is undoubtedly Cooley&#x27;s most famous concept, and is widely known and accepted by psychologists and sociologists today. It expanded William James&#x27;s idea of self to include the capacity of reflection on its own behavior. Other people&#x27;s views build, change and maintain our self-image; thus, there is an interaction between how we see ourselves and how others see us. Through these interactions, human beings develop an idea of who they are. He argued that when we feel shame or pride, it is due to what we think others view us as. He also mentions that we do not always perceive someone&#x27;s impressions correctly. For example, if a student incorrectly answers a question in class, they might later question their own intelligence or capacity to prepare sufficiently. The notion of the looking-glass self applies throughout an individual&#x27;s life: interactions with new people time and again encourage self-evaluation based on a presumed impression given off. In other words, one&#x27;s self-identity can be socially constructed.

In his 1902 work, &quot;Human Nature and the Social Order&quot;, Cooley defined this concept as:

&quot;... a somewhat definite imagination of how one&#x27;s self—that is, any idea he appropriates—appears in a particular mind, and the kind of self-feeling one has is determined by the attitude toward this attributed to that other mind... So in imagination, we perceive in another&#x27;s mind some thought of our appearance, manners, aims, deeds, character, friends, and so on, and are variously affected by it.&quot;

Thus, the three stages observed in the looking-glass self are outlines as:
* You imagine how you appear to the other person.
* You imagine the judgment of the other person.
* You feel some sense of pride, happiness, guilt, or shame.

In line with William James&#x27;s thoughts, the concept of the looking glass self-contributed to an increasing abandonment of the so-called Cartesian disjunction between the human mind and the external social world. Cooley sought to break down the barrier Cartesian thought had erected between the individual and its social context.
=== Social process ===
Cooley&#x27;s &quot;Social Process&quot; (1918) emphasized the non-rational, tentative nature of social organization and the significance of social competition. &quot;Social Process&quot; was an essay-based work that expressed Cooley&#x27;s social theories. It was more philosophical than sociological. He interpreted modern difficulties as the clash of primary group values (love, ambition, loyalty) and institutional values (impersonal ideologies such as progress or Protestantism) (See also The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism). As societies try to cope with their difficulties, they adjust these two kinds of values to one another as best they can. Cooley also mentions the idea of heroes and hero worship. He believed that heroes were an aide or a servant to the internalization of social norms because they represent and serve as an example to reinforce social values. The &quot;Social Process&quot; was Cooley&#x27;s last major work, heavily influenced by Darwinian principles of natural selection and adaptation to collective (social) existence.

==Personal life==
Cooley married Elsie Jones in 1890, who was the daughter of a professor of medicine at the University of Michigan. Mrs. Cooley differed from her husband in that she was outgoing, energetic, and capable of ordering their common lives in such a manner that mundane cares were not to weigh heavily on her husband. The couple had three children, a boy and two girls, and lived quietly and fairly withdrawn in a house close to the campus. The children served Cooley as his own domestic laboratory subjects for his study of genesis and growth of the self. He would observe imitation behavior in his three children and analyzed their reactions based on age. Even when he was not engaged in the observation of his own self and wished to observe others, he did not need to leave the domestic circle. Cooley also found pleasure in amateur botany and bird-watching in spare time away from his research.

Cooley&#x27;s health began to deteriorate in 1928. He was diagnosed with an unidentified form of cancer in March 1929 and died two months later.

<text>Chronicle of a Death Foretold () is a novella by Gabriel García Márquez, published in 1981. It tells, in the form of a pseudo-journalistic reconstruction, the story of the murder of Santiago Nasar by the Vicario twins.

==Plot==
The book is a nonlinear narrative told by an anonymous narrator and begins on the morning of Santiago Nasar&#x27;s death. The reader learns that Santiago lives with his mother, Placida Linero; the cook, Victoria Guzman; and the cook&#x27;s daughter, Divina Flor. Santiago took over the successful family ranch after the death of his father Ibrahim, who was of Arab origin. He returns home in the early morning hours from an all-night celebration of a wedding between a recent newcomer, Bayardo San Román, and a long-term resident, Ángela Vicario. Two hours after the wedding, Ángela was dragged back to her mother&#x27;s home by Bayardo because she was not a virgin. After a beating from her mother, Ángela is forced to reveal the name of the man who has defiled her purity and honor. In a somewhat spurious manner, she reveals the man to be Santiago. To avenge their family honor, her twin brothers Pablo and Pedro Vicario decide to kill Santiago using knives that they&#x27;d previously used to slaughter pigs.

The brothers proceed to the meat market in the pre-dawn hours to sharpen their knives and announce to the owner and other butchers that they plan to kill Santiago. No one believes the threat because Pablo and Pedro are considered &quot;good people&quot;, and most interpret their threats as drunken rambling. Faustino Santos, a butcher friend, becomes suspicious and reports the threat to the policeman, Leandro Pornoy. The brothers proceed to Clotilde Armenta&#x27;s milk shop where they tell her about the plan to kill Santiago, and she notices the knives wrapped in rags. Meanwhile, Officer Leandro talks with Colonel Aponte who, after leisurely dressing and enjoying his breakfast, proceeds to the milk shop and confiscates the brothers&#x27; knives, sending them off to sleep and calling them &quot;a pair of big bluffers&quot;. Clotilde is still concerned that the twins will find another way to carry out their plan to murder Santiago and urges Colonel Aponte to intervene further &quot;to spare those poor boys from the horrible duty&quot;, but he does nothing more.

Gossip about the twins&#x27; publicly announced plans spreads through the town, and though Clotilde asks everyone she sees to warn Santiago, no one does. Some do not believe they should get involved, some assume that he has already been warned, some believe the twins wouldn&#x27;t really follow through, some are distracted by the arrival of the Bishop, some believe that the murder would be justified, and some secretly want Santiago dead. As the priest later confessed, &quot;I didn&#x27;t know what to do... it wasn&#x27;t any business of mine but something for the civil authorities.&quot; 

The brothers return to the milk shop wielding new knives, and this time Pedro expresses hesitation about their plan because he feels they had fulfilled their duty &quot;when the mayor disarmed them&quot;. Nevertheless, they repeat their intention to kill Santiago. Santiago wakes up after an hour&#x27;s sleep to get dressed and greet the bishop along with many of the townsfolk, who expect him to stop in their town while traveling elsewhere. As Santiago leaves, he does not notice the note that someone had left to warn him about the Vicario brothers&#x27; threats on his life. The bishop&#x27;s boat passes by the town without stopping even though people have been waiting for him with various gifts. Santiago then proceeds to his fiancée, who yells, &quot;...I hope they kill you!&quot; because she is upset about his involvement with Ángela Vicario and decides not to warn him.

The murder of Santiago Nasar is described. His friend Cristo Bedoya had frantically looked for Santiago on the morning of the murder to warn him of the plan, but Cristo Bedoya failed to find Santiago, who was actually at his fiancée Flora Miguel&#x27;s house. When Flora Miguel&#x27;s father finds out, he warns Santiago minutes before the twins reach Santiago. Santiago becomes disoriented from the news and starts to run home. His mother, who is finally told, believes he is inside the house and, therefore, bars the front door to which Santiago is running while being chased by the Vicario brothers. He is repeatedly stabbed as he attempts to enter his home, over twenty times total with seven fatal wounds, as they discovered in an ill-performed autopsy performed by the priest. The murder is brutal as Santiago carries his own entrails and enters the back door of his home. He collapses in his kitchen and dies.

After the murder, the Vicario family leaves town due to the scandal and disgrace surrounding the events of Ángela&#x27;s wedding and Santiago&#x27;s murder. Bayardo San Román leaves town as well; his family comes by boat and picks him up. The Vicario twins spend three years in prison awaiting trial but are acquitted in court, after which Pablo marries his lover and Pedro leaves for the armed forces.

Only after Bayardo rejects Ángela does she fall in love with him. After she moves away from the town with her family, Ángela writes him a letter each week for seventeen years. At the end of seventeen years, Bayardo returns to her, carrying all of her letters in bundles, all unopened.

== Inspiration ==
The novella was inspired by real-life events that occurred to García Márquez&#x27;s godbrother. García Márquez heard the story of a young couple that got married in Sucre and, on the day following their wedding, the groom rejected the bride due to her lack of virginity. The bride was determined to have had relations with her former boyfriend, who was consequently pursued and murdered by the bride&#x27;s two brothers in order to avenge the family&#x27;s honor. Though many publications speculated that García Márquez had witnessed the murder firsthand, the writer was in fact not present during the events, which took place in Sucre in 1951.

There are key differences between the action of the story and what took place in reality. For one, in the novella, it is never clear whether or not Santiago Nasar had a prior relationship with Ángela Vicario before her wedding, whereas in real life, the bride had had sexual relations with her former boyfriend. Additionally, García Márquez chose to make the two assassins in the novella twins, Pablo and Pedro Vicario. In real life, they were simply brothers. Lastly, in the book, there is a reconciliation between Ángela and the groom who rejects her, Bayardo San Roman. In real life, there was no such reconciliation.

Brief references are made to Márquez&#x27;s earlier novel &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot;, with Bayardo San Roman&#x27;s father being mentioned as having fought against Aureliano Buendía, one of that novel&#x27;s main characters.

== Key themes ==
The central question at the core of the novella is how the death of Santiago Nasar was widely foreseen — &quot;there had never been a death more foretold,&quot; as the narrator describes — yet no one was able or willing to stop it. The narrator explores the circumstances surrounding his death by asking the villagers who were present during his murder and exploring the seeming contradiction of a murder that was predicted. The book explores the morality of the village&#x27;s collective responsibility in the murder of Santiago Nasar.

Unlike the traditional detective novel, &quot;Chronicle of a Death Foretold&quot; doesn&#x27;t investigate the murder, which is made clear from the first sentence. Instead, the true mystery is why the whole town allowed the murder to occur with, at best, only half-hearted attempts to stop it or even warn the victim.

Isabel Alvarez-Borland notes the text’s &quot;conscious fictionality&quot; and how it makes the reader aware of that, with the main character commenting on the case report&#x27;s meandering literary qualities, reading old reports related to the murder in the same way as the audience reads the novella.

==Adaptations==
The book was translated into English by Gregory Rabassa and Edith Grossman. It was adapted for the big screen in the Spanish language film &quot;Chronicle of a Death Foretold&quot; (1987), an Italian-French-Colombian co-production, directed by Francesco Rosi and starring Ornella Muti, Rupert Everett and Anthony Delon. In 1990, Li Shaohong adapted the book into the Golden Montgolfiere-winning Chinese film &quot;Bloody Morning,&quot; which centers on Chinese rural society. In 1995, Graciela Daniele adapted it into the Tony Award-nominated Broadway musical of the same name, which she also directed and choreographed.

A Romanian short film by the same name was made in 2007, but relation to the novel is uncertain.

<doc id="664686" wikidata="Q1263271" url="?curid=664686" title="Dubuque–Wisconsin Bridge">
<text>The Dubuque–Wisconsin Bridge is a steel Tied-arch automobile bridge connecting Dubuque, Iowa, with still largely rural Grant County, Wisconsin, over the Mississippi River. It is one of two automobile bridges in the Dubuque area, the other being the Julien Dubuque Bridge, which is located about south.

The bridge is a four lane, limited access bridge and is part of US Highway 61/US Highway 151 (US 61/US 151). This bridge replaced the older Eagle Point Bridge that previously served as the connection between Dubuque and Wisconsin.

==History==

In the late 1970s and the early 1980s, city officials became convinced that the Eagle Point Bridge was no longer adequate for the city&#x27;s needs. They determined that a four lane bridge would be needed for the increasing traffic that was anticipated.

Several names for the bridge were considered for the new bridge. Included among the names suggested was one that honored the pioneer priest Samuel Charles Mazzuchelli.

When the Dubuque–Wisconsin Bridge opened in 1981, it ended on an island in the river called City Island, formerly known as Ham&#x27;s Island (as Mathias Ham once owned the land). From City Island, a new bridge was constructed over the Peosta Channel of the Mississippi River, along an alignment that connected with East 16th Street. City Island has since been named Chaplain Schmitt Memorial Island in honor of Father Aloysius Schmitt, who was killed in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.

In the late 1980s, a riverfront expressway for US 61 and US 151 was funded. This nearly mile-long curving bridge was designed to fill in the gap between the Dubuque–Wisconsin Bridge and the new waterfront expressway. The bridge crosses the Peosta Channel of the Mississippi River, as well as a backwater pond. Despite crossing two bodies of water, only 5 of the 20 spans of the bridge are over water.

Upon completion in 1983, traffic was shifted over from the Eagle Point Bridge to the new bridge. The Eagle Point Bridge was demolished soon afterward.

In the early 1990s, the approach to the bridge was rebuilt to accommodate the new four lane US 61/US 151 highway being built in Dubuque.

During the rebuilding of the Julien Dubuque Bridge, traffic from US 20 was detoured on to this bridge.

In 2003, the deck of the bridge was rebuilt and the bridge cleaned.

<text>The Fenian Cycle (), Fianna Cycle or Finn Cycle () is a body of early Irish literature focusing on the exploits of the mythical hero Finn or Fionn mac Cumhaill and his warrior band the Fianna. Sometimes called the Ossianic Cycle after its narrator Oisín, it is one of the four groupings of Irish mythology along with the Mythological Cycle, the Ulster Cycle, and the Kings&#x27; Cycles. Timewise, the Fenian cycle is the third, between the Ulster and Kings&#x27; cycles. The cycle also contains stories about other famous Fianna members, including Diarmuid, Caílte, Oisín&#x27;s son Oscar, and Fionn&#x27;s rival Goll mac Morna.

== Description ==

===Finn&#x27;s conception===
The Finn&#x27;s father Cumhal is discussed as the leader of the Fianna in &quot;Fotha Catha Cnucha&quot; (&quot;Cause of the Battle of Cnucha&quot;), his elopement and the conception of Finn mac Cumhal is the cause of the battle, in which Cumhal is killed by Goll mac Morna. This work lays down the theme of the rivalry between Cumhall&#x27;s Clann Baíscne and Goll&#x27;s Clann Morna, which will resurface time and again under Finn&#x27;s chieftainship over the Fianna.

The onomastics surrounding Almu, the stronghold of the Fianna is also discussed here, quoting from the Metrical Dindsenchas on this landmark. And it is stated that when Finn grew old enough, he received the estate of Almu as compensation (éraic) from his grandfather, who was partly to blame for Cumhal&#x27;s death.

===Finn&#x27;s boyhood deeds===
Finn&#x27;s conception and genealogy is also taken up in the &quot;Macgnímartha Finn&quot; (&quot;Boyhood Deeds of Finn&quot;).

;Tooth of Wisdom
Cumhal&#x27;s son is named Demne at birth, but bestowed the name &quot;Finn&quot; after gaining mystical knowledge from eating a salmon. The ability (Thumb of Knowledge, Tooth of Wisdom, &quot;dét fis&quot;) is manifested by Finn in other works, e. g., the &quot;Acallmh&quot;, the Ossianic poem about the dog from Iruaidhe, or various lays (&quot;duanaire&quot;) of the Finn cycle.

;Burner of the síd
Finn&#x27;s slaying at Holloween (Samain) of the &quot;supernatural burner&quot; Aodh son of Fidga from the síd occurs in the &quot;Macgnímartha Finn&quot;, but elaboraed in the &quot;Acallamh&quot; as well, where Aodh manifests himself under a different name, &quot;Aillen&quot;. This episode is also told in the poem by Gilla in Chomdéd,

===Fionn and Aillén===
Every Samhain, the phantom Aillén mac Midgna, or Aillén the Burner, would terrorise Tara, playing music on his harp that left every warrior helpless. Using a magic spear that rendered him immune to the music, Fionn killed the phantom. As a reward, Fionn was made the leader of the Fianna, replacing Goll, who had to swear fealty to him.

===Fionn and Sadhbh===
Fionn was hunting a fawn, but when he caught it, his hounds Bran and Sceólang wouldn&#x27;t let him kill it, and that night it turned into a beautiful woman, Sadhbh, who had been transformed into a fawn by the druid Fer Doirich. The spell had been broken by the Dun of Allen, Fionn&#x27;s base, where, as long as she remained within she was protected by the spell. They were married. Some while later, Fionn went out to repulse some invaders and Sadhbh stayed in the Dun. Fer Doirich impersonated Fionn, tempting Sadhbh out of the Dun, whereupon she immediately became a fawn again. Fionn searched for her, but all he found was a boy, whom he named Oisín, who had been raised by a fawn. Oisín became famous as a bard, but Sadhbh was never seen again.

===Fionn and Diarmuid===
One of the most famous stories of the cycle. The High King Cormac mac Airt promises the now aging Fionn his daughter Gráinne as his bride, but Gráinne falls instead for a young hero of the Fianna, Diarmuid Ua Duibhne, and the pair runs away together with Fionn in pursuit. The lovers are aided by Diarmuid&#x27;s foster-father, the god Aengus. Eventually Fionn makes his peace with the couple. Years later, however, Fionn invites Diarmuid on a boar hunt, and Diarmuid is badly gored by their quarry. Water drunk from Fionn&#x27;s hands has the power of healing, but when Fionn gathers water he deliberately lets it run through his fingers before he gets back to Diarmuid. His grandson Oscar threatens him if he does not bring water for Diarmuid, but when Fionn finally returns it is too late; Diarmuid has died.

===The Battle of Gabhra===

Between the birth of Oisin and the Battle of Gabhra is the rest of the cycle, which is very long and becomes too complicated for a short summary. Eventually, the High King Cormac dies and his son Cairbre Lifechair wants to destroy the Fianna because he does not like paying the taxes for protection that the Fianna demanded, so he raises an army with other dissatisfied chiefs and provokes the war by killing Fionn&#x27;s servant. Goll sides with the king against Clan Bascna at the battle. Some stories say five warriors murdered Fionn at the battle, while others say he died in the battle of the Ford of Brea, killed by Aichlech Mac Dubdrenn or Goll, who he killed kind. In any case, only twenty warriors survive the battle, including Oisín and Caílte.

<doc id="664704" wikidata="Q3418609" url="?curid=664704" title="Upholstery hammer">
<text>An upholstery hammer (also called a tack hammer) is a lightweight hammer used for securing upholstery fabric to furniture frames using tacks or small nails.

The head of an upholstery hammer is narrow and roughly 12-15mm in diameter. Commonly they are cast in bronze with fused steel tips. 

Many styles of upholstery hammers have two faces, one face being magnetized to aid in the placement of tacks, the other being larger to drive the tacks home. A patent existed for a magnetized tack hammer as early as 1861, by G. W. Beardslee. Sometimes, the magnetized face has a split surface to make its magnetic hold stronger. Upholstery hammers may also have one end shaped like a claw to make removing tacks easier.

To apply tacks rapidly, an upholsterer will hold tacks in the mouth and spit them, head first, onto the magnetized face of the hammer. This gave rise to the phrase &quot;spitting tacks.&quot;

Staple guns have largely replaced tacking as an upholstery technique.

<text>SpeechWorks was a company founded in Boston in 1994 by speech recognition pioneer Mike Phillips and Bill O&#x27;Farrell. The Boston-based company developed and supported speech-related computer software. Originally known as Applied Language Technologies, SpeechWorks went public in 2000 and tripled its value. It was acquired by Scansoft in 2003. ScanSoft acquired Nuance in 2005, and changed its name to Nuance Communications.

The company&#x27;s main focus was bringing speech recognition solutions to phone systems. Carriers and voice portals were able to use these speech-activated services to direct consumer calls, conduct transactions, and obtain information. SpeechWorks technology was uniquely suited for these applications because it was the first software that offered a human-sounding voice that asked callers questions which they could verbally answer, allowed callers to interrupt the software before it concluded reciting a list of options, and could learn from previous calls in order to add new vocabulary to its database.

These services were largely successful: SpeechWorks client Thrifty car rentals used this service to give pricing information to callers, and 90% of surveyed customers who interacted with it expressed that the service either met or exceeded their ease of use expectations.

SpeechWorks&#x27; clients were typically in the financial services, telecommunications, and travel industries, and included FedEx, United Airlines, Amtrak, Thrifty car rentals, and others. SpeechWorks also developed “multi-modal” and text-to-speech technology as early as 2001 that enabled people to use spoken commands to navigate cell phones.

== Speechify Solo ==
Speechify Solo was a text-to-speech software released by Speechworks in 2002. Speechify Solo featured a natural, human-sounding speaking voice that could read text-based information aloud, and personalize messages for individual users. It could be applied in the fields of hand-held computing, home entertainment, and the automotive industries.

In early 2003, the National Weather Service implemented major voice improvements using Speechify, to be heard on NOAA Weather Radio. In 2016, these were replaced by a new voice associated with a new system.

== Relationship with AOL ==
In 2000, America Online, Inc, also known as AOL, released &quot;AOL by Phone,&quot; a service that enabled AOL users to check their e-mail and access other AOL features through spoken commands from any telephone. This service was developed in partnership with Quack.com, a voice portal company owned by AOL. Quack.com utilized SpeechWorks&#x27; Speechify software to power the service&#x27;s voice recognition capabilities. Two years later, in 2002, AOL purchased $5 million of SpeechWorks stock, equivalent to 1% of the company.

== Acquisitions ==
SpeechWorks purchased Ithaca based Eloquent Technologies, Inc. in 2000 for $17 million.

<doc id="664717" wikidata="Q1587207" url="?curid=664717" title="High Point (New Jersey)">
<text>High Point is a mountain peak within High Point State Park on the border of Wantage Township and Montague Township, Sussex County in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Located in the portion of the state known as the Skylands, it is the highest elevation in the state, with a peak elevation of . The closest city is Port Jervis, New York, which lies to the northwest. Besides being the highest peak in New Jersey, High Point is also the highest peak of the Kittatinny Mountains. Three states – New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania – can be seen from the summit.

At the peak is the High Point Monument, a obelisk, built in 1930 as a war memorial.

==High Point State Park==
The mountain is in the High Point State Park. Route 23 skirts the park and carries visitors from the New Jersey suburbs and from points in New York State. The park is administered by the New Jersey Division of Parks and Forestry.

As of the 2023 season, park entry was free.

The land for High Point State Park, donated by Colonel Anthony R. and Susie Dryden Kuser of Bernardsville, New Jersey, was dedicated as a park in 1923. The pleasant landscaping was designed by the Olmsted Brothers of Boston, a prominent landscape architectural firm run by the sons of Central Park designer Frederick Law Olmsted.

To the south the Appalachian Trail follows a rocky ridge which offers many scenic views of the valleys and mountains surrounding the area. To the north, the trail drops off the ridge through hemlock gorges into former agricultural fields with a view of the surrounding countryside and the High Point Monument in the distance.

During the winter, portions of the parks trails are used for cross-country skiing.

== War veterans monument ==
The Monument on High Point was built by Kuser to honor war veterans. Master mason Michael Maddaluna began construction of the tower – which has a base which is 34 feet square – in 1928 and completed it in 1930. The outside is made of New Hampshire granite and also Shawangunk quartz. There are four small windows through which observers have a view of the ridges of the Pocono Mountains toward the west, the Catskill Mountains to the north and the Wallkill River Valley in the southeast. The Monument is an obelisk monument similar to other war monuments, such as the one on Bunker Hill in Massachusetts. The Monument has 291 steps from the base to the highest viewing platform.

Plans were made to close the park as of July 1, 2008, under Gov. Jon Corzine&#x27;s budget plan for 2009. Veterans groups, who have held an annual memorial at the site, expressed their opposition to the proposal, which was ultimately removed from the final budget.

<doc id="664725" wikidata="Q212429" url="?curid=664725" title="Metropolitan France">
<text>Metropolitan France ( or ), also known as European France, is the area of France which is geographically in Europe. This collective name for the European regions of France is used in everyday life in France but has no administrative meaning, with the exception of only Metropolitan France being part of the Schengen Area. Indeed, the overseas regions have exactly the same administrative status as the metropolitan regions. Metropolitan France comprises mainland France and Corsica, as well as nearby French islands in the Atlantic Ocean, the English Channel (), and the Mediterranean Sea. Its borders have undergone significant changes over the centuries, particularly in the east, but have remained unaltered since 1947.

In contrast, overseas France (&quot;France d&#x27;outre-mer&quot;) is the collective name for all the French departments and territories outside Europe. Metropolitan and overseas France together form the French Republic. Metropolitan France accounts for 82.0% of the land territory, 3.3% of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ), and 95.9% of the population of the French Republic. Some small parts of France (e.g. Cerdanya) are a part of the Iberian Peninsula.

In overseas France, a person from metropolitan France is often called a &quot;métro&quot;, short for &quot;métropolitain&quot;.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;metropolitan France&quot; dates from the country&#x27;s colonial period (from the 16th to the 20th centuries), when France was referred to as (literally &quot;the Metropolis&quot;), as distinguished from its colonies and protectorates, known as &quot;les colonies&quot; or &quot;l&#x27;Empire&quot;. Similar terms existed to describe other European colonial powers (e.g. &quot;metropolitan Britain&quot;, &quot;España metropolitana&quot;). This application of the words &quot;metropolis&quot; and &quot;metropolitan&quot; came from Ancient Greek &quot;&quot; (from &quot;mother&quot; and &quot;city, town&quot;), which was the name for a city-state that created colonies across the Mediterranean (e.g. Marseille was a colony of the city-state of Phocaea; therefore Phocaea was the &quot;metropolis&quot; of Marseille). By extension &quot;metropolis&quot; and &quot;metropolitan&quot; came to mean &quot;motherland&quot;, a nation or country as opposed to its colonies overseas.

Today, some people in Overseas France object to the use of the term &quot;la France métropolitaine&quot; due to its colonial history. They prefer to call it &quot;the European territory of France&quot; (le territoire européen de la France), as the Treaties of the European Union do. Likewise, they oppose treating overseas France and metropolitan France as separate entities. For example, INSEE used to calculate its statistics (demography, economy, etc.) for metropolitan France only, and to analyze separate statistics for the overseas departments and territories. People in the overseas departments have opposed this separate treatment, arguing that the then four overseas departments were fully part of France.

As a result, since the end of the 1990s INSEE has included the four overseas departments in its figures for France (such as total population or GDP). The fifth overseas department, Mayotte, has been included in the figures for France since the mid-2010s too. INSEE refers to metropolitan France and the five overseas departments as &quot;la France entière&quot; (&quot;the whole of France&quot;). &quot;The whole of France&quot; includes the five overseas departments, but does not include the other overseas collectivities and territories that have more autonomy than the departments. Other branches of the French administration may have different definitions of what &quot;la France entière&quot; is. For example, in contrast to INSEE, when the Ministry of the Interior releases election results, they use the term &quot;la France entière&quot; to refer to the entire French Republic, including all of overseas France, and not just the five overseas departments.

Since INSEE now calculates statistics for &quot;la France entière&quot;, this practice has spread to international institutions. For instance, the French GDP published by the World Bank includes metropolitan France and the five overseas departments. The World Bank refers to this total as &quot;France&quot;; it does not use the phrase &quot;the whole of France&quot;, as INSEE does.

==Statistics==
Metropolitan France covers a land area of , while overseas France covers a land area of , for a total of in the French Republic (excluding Adélie Land in Antarctica where sovereignty is suspended since the signing of the Antarctic Treaty in 1959). Thus, metropolitan France accounts for 82.0% of the French Republic&#x27;s land territory.

At sea, the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of metropolitan France covers , while the EEZ of Overseas France covers , for a total of in the French Republic (excluding Adélie Land). Thus, metropolitan France accounts for 3.3% of the French Republic&#x27;s EEZ.

According to INSEE, 66,143,000 people lived in metropolitan France as of January 2024, while 2,220,000 lived in the French Overseas Department (DOM) and another 600,000 in the Overseas Collectivities (TOM), for a total of 2,820,000 inhabitants in Oversea France. The total population of all French controlled land is 68,963,000 people. But the Overseas Collectivities are not included in the INSEE statistics. Thus, metropolitan France accounts for 95.9% of the French Republic&#x27;s population.

In the second round of the 2017 French presidential election, 35,467,327 French people cast a ballot (meaning a turnout of 74.56%). 33,883,463 of these (95.53% of the total voters) cast their ballots in metropolitan France (turnout: 76.26%), 1,003,910 (2.83% of the total voters) cast their ballots in overseas France (turnout: 53.59%), and 579,954 (1.64% of the total voters) cast their ballots in foreign countries (French people living abroad; turnout: 45.84%).

The French National Assembly is made up of 577 deputies, 539 of whom (93.4% of the total) are elected in metropolitan France, 27 (4.7% of the total) in overseas France, and 11 (1.9% of the total) by French citizens living in foreign countries.

==Hexagon==
Legislators in 2023 voted to use the name l&#x27;Hexagone (&quot;the Hexagon&quot;) to refer to what had previously been known as metropolitan France in an effort to move away from colonial language. The image of France as a hexagon first appeared in French geography texts of the 1850s.

Mainland or Continental France (French: &quot;la France continentale&quot;), or just &quot;the mainland&quot; (French: &quot;le continent&quot;), does not include the French islands in the Atlantic Ocean, English Channel, or Mediterranean Sea, the largest of which is Corsica.
In Corsica, people from mainland France are referred to as &quot;les continentaux&quot;.

<doc id="664735" wikidata="Q7659694" url="?curid=664735" title="Syd Hoff">
<text>Syd Hoff (September 4, 1912 – May 12, 2004) was an American cartoonist and children&#x27;s book author, best known for his classic early reader &quot;Danny and the Dinosaur&quot;. His cartoons appeared in a multitude of genres, including advertising commissions for such companies as Eveready Batteries, Jell-O, OK Used Cars, S.O.S Pads, Rambler, Ralston Cereal, and more.

==Biography==
Hoff was born in Bronx, New York. While he was still at high school, Milt Gross, a popular 1930s cartoonist, told him at an assembly, &quot;Kid, someday you&#x27;ll be a great cartoonist!&quot; At 16, he enrolled at the National Academy of Design in New York City. At 18, he sold his first cartoon to &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, and eventually sold a total of 571 of them to the publication from 1931 to 1975. Hoff became known for his cartoons in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; depicting tenements and lower-middle class life in the city.

His cartoons have appeared in a variety of publications including the &quot;New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, and &quot;Look&quot; magazine. He was also the host of a television show &quot;Tales of Hoff&quot;, in which he drew and told stories.

Hoff wrote and illustrated over 60 volumes in the HarperCollins &quot;I Can Read&quot; series for beginning readers, most notably &quot;Sammy the Seal&quot; and the popular &quot;Danny and the Dinosaur&quot; (1958), which sold 10 million copies and has been translated into a dozen languages.

In 1976, Hoff edited and published &quot;Editorial and Political Cartooning: From Earlier Times to the Present&quot;, which contains over 700 examples of works from the world&#x27;s editorial and political cartoons.

==Syndicated comic strips==
Hoff drew two long-running syndicated comic strips: &quot;Tuffy&quot; (1939–1949) and &quot;Laugh It Off&quot; (1958–1978). One of his recurring characters is a walrus-mustached man who eventually appeared as the father in his daily &quot;Tuffy&quot;, done for the King Features Syndicate from 1939 to 1950.

&quot;Tuffy&quot; was originally commissioned by William Randolph Hearst in 1938, and was declared &quot;essential for national morale&quot; during the American involvement in World War II. This classification kept Hoff out of active military duty during World War II, although he joined the Office of War Information and drew propaganda cartoons which were dropped behind enemy lines.

==Political cartoons as A. Redfield==
Starting in 1933, Hoff began to contribute cartoons to leftist newspapers and magazines, including &quot;The Daily Worker&quot; and &quot;New Masses&quot; as A. Redfield, the pseudonym that he adopted for his radical work. Hoff&#x27;s first published book &quot;The Ruling Clawss&quot; (&quot;Daily Worker&quot;, 1935) collects over 150 Hoff cartoons originally published in the communist daily, and his first book for children &quot;Mr. His: A Children&#x27;s Story for Anybody&quot; was published as a pamphlet by (and also within the pages of) &quot;New Masses&quot; magazine.

Hoff&#x27;s output under the A. Redfield pseudonym began to taper off by 1940, though he remained politically active. He was questioned by the FBI in 1952 about his A. Redfield work and Communist Party association, after being photographed with Marxist civil liberties advocate Corliss Lamont at a protest against the atomic bomb the previous year. Hoff was never formally charged, nor blacklisted. Nevertheless, he remained concerned for the remainder of his life about being identified as a &quot;Red&quot; and the impact that this might have on the reception of his children&#x27;s books.

<text>The National Bank of Canada () is the sixth largest commercial bank in Canada. It is headquartered in Montreal, and has branches in most Canadian provinces and 2.4 million personal clients. National Bank is the largest bank in Quebec, and the second largest financial institution in the province, after Desjardins credit union. National Bank&#x27;s Institution Number is 006 and its SWIFT code is BNDCCAMMINT.

==History==

In 1859, francophone businessmen in Ontario and Quebec were keen to establish a bank under their local control, and persuaded the provincial legislature to pass the act that created the Banque Nationale on May 4, 1859. Some members of the anglophone bourgeoisie participated in the bank&#x27;s share capital, but francophones retained exclusive control and held all seats on the board of directors with Ulric-Joseph Tessier, lawyer and Member of the Legislative Assembly serving as chairman of the bank.

The bank suffered losses during the banking crisis sparked by the financial panic of 1873 and panic of 1884 but managed to survive and continued to operate. In the 1930s, during the Great Depression, Banque Nationale again came under financial stress; this time a merger was arranged with &quot;Banque d’Hochelaga&quot; assisted by the province&#x27;s legislature to strengthen the bank. The merged bank was renamed &quot;Banque Canadienne Nationale&quot; (BCN) (English, &quot;Canadian National Bank&quot;).

In 1968, BCN, in conjunction with a number of other banks, launched Chargex, the first credit card to be issued by a Canadian bank.

During the 1970s, Quebec-based rival Provincial Bank of Canada expanded rapidly through a number of acquisitions. It merged with the People&#x27;s Bank in 1970, with the Toronto-based Unity Bank of Canada, and in 1979 it acquired Laurentide Financial Corporation of Vancouver. Provincial Bank and BCN continued to expand but continued to have a large part of their operations concentrated in Quebec. In November 1979, these two banks decided to merge under the new name &quot;National Bank of Canada&quot; in what was at the time one of the largest bank mergers.

===Post-merger===
Through the 1980s the bank continued to grow and expand its businesses through a number of acquisitions, including the brokerage firm Lévesque Beaubien and a year later Geoffrion Leclerc, which became known as Lévesque Beaubien Geoffrion. In 1993, it sold its lease financing operations to GE Capital and acquired the assets of General Trust of Canada.

In 1994, it made a small step outside Canada when it opened two branches in the United States, one in Florida and one in California. As of 2020, its Natbank subsidiary has three branches, all in Florida. In 1995 the bank opened a representative office in Cuba to assist Canadian clients doing business in the country. In 1999 it concluded its purchase of First Marathon, a Toronto-based brokerage firm. First Marathon and the Bank&#x27;s subsidiary Lévesque Beaubien Geoffrion Inc. merged their operations to form National Bank Financial (NBF), its investment banking subsidiary. In 2002 it acquired US-based investment bank Putnam Lovell and merged the operations with its NBF subsidiary which started operating through offices in New York, Toronto, and London.

In March 2006, it sold its shareholder management services to Computershare.

In 2016, it acquired 90 percent of the shares of ABA Bank of Cambodia (formerly known as the Advanced Bank of Asia). In 2019, it acquired the remaining 10 percent that had been held by a former head of the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange, Damir Karassayev.

In October 2019, National Bank of Canada was criticized by privacy experts for requiring new online customers to provide their full login credentials for accounts with other financial institutions, including password. On its website, the bank tells clients to &quot;Never tell anyone your password&quot;, yet during the process of creating an account, they say, &quot;... you will need to provide... your login credentials with another eligible Canadian financial institution&quot;.

On June 11, 2024, National Bank announced plans to acquire Canadian Western Bank by the end of 2025 for $5 billion. Canadian Western shareholders voted to approve the deal on September 3, 2024, and the merger was completed in February of 2025. 

==Operations==
In August 2021, National Bank brokerage became the second Canadian financial institution to offer free online direct brokerage after Wealthsimple introduced it first.

On October 31, 2019, National Bank had a network of 422 branches and 939 automated teller machines in Canada. It also had a representative offices, subsidiaries and partnerships in other countries, through which it serves Canadian and non-Canadian clients. It owns ABA Bank in Cambodia.

National Bank&#x27;s business is concentrated in Quebec, and it is expanding in other provinces. For the year ending October 31, 2017, 59% of its total revenues were from Quebec, 30% from other provinces, and 11% from its international operations. Its total revenue for the year were allocated across the following business segments:
* 44.8% from Personal and Commercial Banking,
* 23.5% from Wealth Management,
* 23.8% from Financial Markets, and
* 7.9% from U.S. Specialty Finance and International.

In 2011, National Bank was placed third in Bloomberg&#x27;s list of &quot;The World’s Strongest Banks&quot;. In 2018, it placed 41st on Go back Finance&#x27;s list of the 50 strongest banks.

===Management===
The management structure of the bank consists of an office of the President and a board of directors.

<doc id="664740" wikidata="Q2593" url="?curid=664740" title="Matthew Vaughn">
<text>Matthew Allard de Vere Drummond (born Matthew Allard Robert Vaughn; 7 March 1971), known professionally as Matthew Vaughn, is an English filmmaker. He has produced films including &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot; (1998) and &quot;Snatch&quot; (2000), and directed &quot;Layer Cake&quot; (2004), &quot;Stardust&quot; (2007), &quot;Kick-Ass&quot; (2010), &quot;X-Men: First Class&quot; (2011), and &quot;Argylle&quot; (2024). Vaughn also co-created the &quot;Kingsman&quot; comic book series and resulting franchise, directing, producing and co-writing the films &quot;&quot; (2014), &quot;&quot; (2017), and &quot;The King&#x27;s Man&quot; (2021).

==Early life==
Vaughn was born in Paddington, London, England. Until 2002, he had thought that he was the child of a relationship between his mother, Kathy Ceaton (died 20 July 2013), and American actor Robert Vaughn. A paternity investigation in the 1980s revealed that Robert Vaughn was not his father, but Ceaton had never revealed otherwise to Vaughn. Upon asking his mother about his true paternity, she revealed that his father was George Albert Harley de Vere Drummond, an English banker. Early in Vaughn&#x27;s life, before the paternity investigation, Robert Vaughn had asked for the child&#x27;s surname to be Vaughn, and it continues as Vaughn&#x27;s professional name, though he uses de Vere Drummond in his personal life, having changed it by deed poll in May 2002.

==Career==
Aged 25, Vaughn produced a low-budget thriller, &quot;The Innocent Sleep&quot; (1996), starring Annabella Sciorra and Michael Gambon. He continued as a producer on close friend Guy Ritchie&#x27;s film &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot;. The film was a critical, popular and financial success, earning Vaughn and Ritchie £9 million each. Vaughn would later produce Ritchie&#x27;s &quot;Snatch&quot; and &quot;Swept Away&quot;.

Vaughn made his directorial debut in 2004 with &quot;Layer Cake&quot;. The film was well received and its success led to Vaughn being tapped to direct &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot; (2006), but he dropped out only two weeks before filming began. Subsequently, he said the film was &quot;pretty good&quot; given the limited time they had to make it, but he was critical of Brett Ratner&#x27;s direction of the film. For his next project he co-wrote and directed &quot;Stardust&quot;, followed by a movie adaptation of Mark Millar&#x27;s &quot;Kick-Ass&quot; in 2010. Vaughn directed and co-wrote the first film in the prequel trilogy of the &quot;X-Men&quot; film universe titled, &quot;X-Men: First Class&quot; (2011). Vaughn was signed to return to the series as director of the sequel, &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot; (2014), but dropped out in favour of Bryan Singer who had directed the first two films in the original trilogy, &quot;X-Men&quot; and &quot;X2: X-Men United&quot;. Vaughn remained attached to the film by co-writing the script.

Vaughn&#x27;s next directorial project, was &quot;&quot; (2014), an adaptation of the comic book &quot;The Secret Service&quot; created by Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons from a concept by Millar and an initially uncredited Vaughn himself (Vaughn being credited as the comic&#x27;s co-creator on all republications since 2014). The film was scripted by Vaughn and Jane Goldman, and produced by Vaughn&#x27;s production company Marv Films. Vaughn returned to direct, produce, and co-write the &quot;Kingsman&quot; sequel, &quot;&quot;, which was released in theaters in September 2017. Vaughn also directed and provided the story for &quot;The King&#x27;s Man&quot;, the third installment in the franchise serving as a prequel to the original film. Delayed from November 2019 due to both the schedule shuffle following Disney&#x27;s acquisition of 21st Century Fox and the subsequent COVID-19 pandemic, the film was released on 22 December 2021.

In March 2017, &quot;Collider&quot; reported that Vaughn was top choice to direct &quot;Man of Steel 2&quot;; in September of that year, Vaughn confirmed that he was in negotiations with the studio to helm the project. By March 2019, Vaughn stated that discussions with Warner Bros. had ended, and he was no longer involved with development of the film.

Vaughn began working on spy film &quot;Argylle&quot; in 2021, an original story written by Jason Fuchs and starring an ensemble cast including Henry Cavill, Sam Rockwell, Bryce Dallas Howard, Samuel L. Jackson, Bryan Cranston and John Cena. 
The film premiered in January 2024, and was released by Universal Pictures and Apple Original Films.

In January 2024, Vaughn announced that he would be producing a third &quot;Kick-Ass&quot; film, titled &quot;Stuntnuts Does School Fight&quot;, directed by his longtime stunt coordinator Damien Walters in his feature film debut, which had secretly already been greenlit and had completed filming. also announcing two further films in the &quot;Hit-Girl &amp; Kick-Ass&quot; franchise to be in development, to be produced by him as a trilogy, under the working titles &quot;Vram&quot; and &quot;Kick-Ass&quot;.

==Personal life==
On 25 May 2002, Vaughn married German supermodel Claudia Schiffer in Suffolk. The couple have a son and two daughters, the youngest born in 2010. They have homes in Notting Hill, London, Northamptonshire and Coldham Hall, Stanningfield, Suffolk.

<doc id="664754" wikidata="Q213416" url="?curid=664754" title="Amílcar Cabral">
<text>Amílcar Lopes Cabral (; – ) was a Bissau-Guinean and Cape Verdean agricultural engineer, political organizer, and diplomat. He was one of Africa&#x27;s foremost anti-colonial leaders. He was also a pan-Africanist and intellectual nationalist revolutionary poet. 

Also known by the &quot;nom de guerre&quot; Abel Djassi, he led the nationalist movement of Guinea-Bissau and the Cape Verde Islands and the ensuing war of independence in Guinea-Bissau.

Cabral was shot dead on 20 January 1973, about eight months before Guinea-Bissau&#x27;s unilateral declaration of independence. He was deeply influenced by Marxism, becoming an inspiration to revolutionary socialists and national independence movements worldwide.

==Early life and education==

Amílcar Lopes Cabral was born on 12 September 1924. He was born in the town of Bafatá, Portuguese Guinea (located in modern-day Guinea-Bissau) to Cape Verdean parents, Juvenal António Lopes da Costa Cabral and Iva Pinhel Évora, both hailing from Santiago. His father came from a wealthy land-owning family. His mother was a shop owner and hotel worker who worked hard to support her family, especially after she separated from Amílcar&#x27;s father by 1929. Her family was not well off, so she was unable to pursue higher education.

Amílcar Cabral was educated at Liceu Secondary School Gil Eanes in the town of Mindelo, Cape Verde. He was later educated at the Instituto Superior de Agronomia in Lisbon, Portugal. While an agronomy student in Lisbon, he founded student movements dedicated to opposing the ruling dictatorship of Portugal and promoting the cause of independence for the Portuguese colonies in Africa.

==Career==
While back in Africa, starting in 1953, he conducted an agricultural census in Portuguese Guinea in which he would travel more than 60,000 kilometers. This allowed him to “become intimately familiar with the people and land” of Portuguese Guinea, understanding that undoubtedly was helpful in the guerrilla war he would go on to fight. He returned to Africa in the 1950s from Portugal and was instrumental in promoting the independence causes of the then Portuguese colonies. In 1956, he was the founder of the PAIGC or &quot;&quot; (African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde). He was also one of the founding members of Movimento Popular Libertação de Angola (MPLA) later in the same year, together with Agostinho Neto, whom he met in Portugal, and other Angolan nationalists. Cabral was an asset of the Czechoslovak State Security (StB), and under the codename &quot;Secretary&quot; provided intelligence information to the StB.

===Guerrilla war for independence===

From 1963 to his assassination in 1973, Cabral led the PAIGC&#x27;s guerrilla movement in Portuguese Guinea against the Portuguese government, which evolved into one of the most successful wars of independence in modern African history. The goal of the conflict was to attain independence for both Portuguese Guinea and Cape Verde. Over the course of the conflict, as the movement captured territory from the Portuguese, Cabral became the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of a large portion of what became Guinea-Bissau.

In preparation for the independence war, Cabral set up training camps in Ghana with the permission of Kwame Nkrumah. Cabral trained his lieutenants through various techniques, including mock conversations to provide them with effective communication skills to aid their efforts in mobilizing Guinean traditional leaders to support the PAIGC. Cabral realized that the war effort could only be sustained if his troops could be fed and taught to live off the land, alongside the larger populace. Being an agronomist, he trained his troops to teach local farmers better farming techniques. This was to ensure that they could increase productivity and be able to feed their own family and community, as well as the soldiers enlisted in the PAIGC&#x27;s military wing. When not fighting, PAIGC soldiers tilled and ploughed the fields alongside the local population.

Cabral and the PAIGC also set up a trade-and-barter bazaar system that moved around the country and made staple goods available to the countryside at prices lower than that of colonial store owners. During the war, Cabral also set up a roving hospital and triage station to give medical care to wounded PAIGC soldiers and quality-of-life care to the larger populace, relying on medical supplies garnered from the USSR and Sweden. The bazaars and triage stations were at first stationary, until they came under frequent attack from Portuguese regime forces.

==Assassination==
In 1972, Cabral began to form a People&#x27;s Assembly in preparation for the independence of Guinea-Bissau. On 20 January 1973, the disgruntled former PAIGC rival Inocêncio Kani, together with another member of PAIGC, shot Cabral to death in Conakry. Cabral was 48 years old.

==Aftermath==
According to some theories, Portuguese PIDE agents, whose alleged plan eventually went awry, wanted to influence Cabral&#x27;s rivals through agents operating within the PAIGC, in hope of arresting Cabral and placing him under the custody of Portuguese authorities. Another theory claims that Ahmed Sékou Touré, jealous of Cabral&#x27;s greater international prestige, among other motives, orchestrated the conspiracy; both theories remain unproven and controversial.

After the assassination, about one hundred officers and guerrilla soldiers of the PAIGC, accused of involvement in the conspiracy that resulted in the murder of Amílcar Cabral and the attempt to seize power in the movement, were summarily executed. His half-brother, Luís Cabral, became the leader of the Guinea-Bissau branch of the party and eventually became President of Guinea-Bissau.

Less than a month after the assassination, the United States concluded that then-colonial power Portugal was not directly involved in his death, according to official documents made public in 2006. Even so, the US State Department&#x27;s Information and Investigation Services also concluded that &quot;Lisbon&#x27;s complicity&quot; in the assassination of the leader of the struggle for Cape Verde&#x27;s and Guinea-Bissau&#x27;s independence &quot;cannot be ruled out.&quot;

Later on 25 April 1974, the Carnation Revolution coup was carried out in Portugal, which was followed by a cease-fire in the various battle fronts and eventually by the independence of all of Portugal&#x27;s former colonies in Africa. Cabral was assassinated prior to the independence of the Portuguese colonies in Africa and therefore died before he could see his homelands of Cape Verde and Guinea Bissau gain independence from Portugal.

==Tributes==


Cabral is considered a &quot;revolutionary theoretician as significant as Frantz Fanon and Che Guevara&quot;, one &quot;whose influence reverberated far beyond the African continent.&quot; Amílcar Cabral International Airport, Cape Verde&#x27;s principal international airport at Sal, is named in his honor. There is also a football competition, the Amílcar Cabral Cup, in zone 2, named as a tribute to him.
In addition, the only privately owned university in Guinea-Bissau – Amílcar Cabral University, in Bissau – is named after him. Jorge Peixinho composed an elegy to Cabral in 1973.

Author António Tomás wrote a biography of Amílcar Cabral, entitled &quot;O Fazedor de Utopias: Uma Biografia de Amílcar Cabral&quot;, which offers an extensive overview of Amílcar&#x27;s life in narrative form. It features a detailed account of Amílcar&#x27;s family history in Portuguese. A large number of photographs were taken of him, and the work of the independence movement in Guinea-Bissau, by the Italian photographer Bruna Polimeni. These have been exhibited in Cape Verde, Portugal and Italy.

Patrick Chabal, professor of Lusophone African studies at King&#x27;s College, London, also wrote a book about the life and biography of Amílcar Cabral, entitled &quot;Amílcar Cabral: Revolutionary Leadership And People&#x27;s War&quot; (1983 and 2003). The book tells the story of Cabral who, as head of PAIGC, Guinea-Bissau&#x27;s nationalist movement, became one of Africa&#x27;s foremost revolutionary leaders.

President William R. Tolbert (Republic of Liberia) commissioned and built a housing estate on the Old Road, Sinkor, Monrovia, Liberia, named in honor of Cabral.

There is a block of flats named Amílcar Cabral Court on Porteus Road in west London, situated in the Paddington Green area.

Angolan singer and activist David Zé composed &#x27;Quem Matou Cabral&#x27; in honor of Amílcar Cabral and performed it during the independence celebrations of Mozambique, São Tomé and Príncipe, and Guinea-Bissau.

East Germany issued a postage stamp in his honor in 1978.

A square in Veshnyaki District of Moscow was named &quot;Amílcar Cabral Square&quot; (Russian: «Площадь Амилкара Кабрала» &quot;Ploschad Amilcara Cabrala&quot;) since 16 January 1974.

He was voted the second greatest leader in the world in a poll conducted by BBC World History Magazine in March 2020.

A public library in Bologna was named &quot;Amílcar Cabral Library&quot; since 1974.

<doc id="664756" wikidata="Q1105640" url="?curid=664756" title="Postal codes in France">
<text>Postal codes were introduced in France in 1964, when &quot;La Poste&quot; introduced automated sorting. They were updated to use the current 5 digit system in 1972.

France uses five-digit numeric postal codes, the first two digits representing the département in which the city is located. The département numbers were assigned alphabetically between 1860 and 1870, but later changes (such as renaming and splitting of départements) mean that the list is no longer in strictly alphabetical order. The system extends to French overseas departments and territories, and also includes Monaco. Note that postcodes in both départements of Corsica commence with the &quot;20&quot; historically assigned to Corsica before it was split into two départements, which are now numbered 2A and 2B.

The last three digits identify a more precise location, 000 being in general reserved for the &quot;préfecture&quot;. However, in Paris, Lyon and Marseille, the last two digits indicate the &quot;arrondissement&quot;. For example, 80000 corresponds to Amiens, which is the &quot;préfecture&quot; of the Somme or département 80, while 69008 corresponds to the 8th arrondissement of Lyon.

==Format==

The postal code () consists of five digits. In metropolitan France the first two digits are the number of the &quot;département&quot; where the post office in charge of delivery to a town is located. There are some places where this is different from the department where the place is located. In the Overseas Departments and Territories, the first three digits identify the &quot;département&quot; or territory. The digits 00 are used for Military addresses. The digits &quot;20&quot; are used for all of Corsica; the split of the island into two départements was not followed by a change in the postal codes.

The next three digits identify the local postal office in charge of mail delivery. A regular postcode always ends with a 0, with the notable exception of Paris, Lyon and Marseille – see below – and the Overseas Départements and Territories. Postcodes not ending with a 0 may indicate a special code, known as CEDEX (see below), or newest postcodes.

In Paris, Lyon and Marseille, the last two digits of the postal code indicate the &quot;municipal arrondissement&quot;. Prior to 1972, an address in the eighth &quot;municipal arrondissement&quot; of Paris, would be written as:

:8 rue Chambiges
:Paris 8e

This number was incorporated into the postal code as:

:8 rue Chambiges
:75008 Paris

The 16th arrondissement of Paris has two postal codes, 75016 (south) and 75116 (north).

In each département, the &quot;préfecture&quot; (main city) has a postal code ending with &quot;000&quot;, for example Bourges in Cher:

:15 avenue du Général Leclerc
:18000 Bourges

The more important the city, the simpler the postal code. The &quot;sous-préfectures&quot; are generally recognized by using a XXX00 postcode (but a few additional XXX00 postcodes may also be allocated in the most populated &quot;préfectures&quot; to subdivide them into several postal distribution areas, XX000 being still used for the most central post office of the city). Here is for example the postal code of a small village, Lépaud in Creuse:

:16 grande rue
:23170 Lépaud

Another example with Pouillé-les-Côteaux in Loire-Atlantique:

:17 rue de la Cour
:44522 Pouillé-les-Côteaux

And the postal code of Mortagne-au-Perche, &quot;sous-préfecture&quot; of the Département de l&#x27;Orne:

:4 rue des Quinze Fusillés
:61400 Mortagne-au-Perche

It is not rare that many adjacent villages share the same postal code, which is primarily associated with a bigger post office, e.g.: 64150 can correspond to Abidos, Bésingrand, Lagor, Lahourcade, Mourenx, Noguère, Os Marsillon, Pardies, Sauvelade and Vielleségure. It may happen that a village is associated with a bigger post office in another département, thus its postcode begins with the two digits of another département. For example, Le Fresne-sur-Loire, in Loire-Atlantique, uses 49123, while its postcode should normally start with 44, because it is associated with the post office of Ingrandes, a neighbouring commune in Maine-et-Loire.

Overseas Départements and Territories use 3-digit codes starting with : 971 (Guadeloupe), 972 (Martinique), 973 (French Guiana), 974 (Réunion), 975 (Saint-Pierre and Miquelon), 976 (Mayotte), 984 (French Southern Territories), 986 (Wallis and Futuna), 987 (French Polynesia), 988 (New Caledonia). In March 2008 La Poste proposed allotting 977 to Saint Barthélemy and 978 to Saint Martin due to their new status as overseas collectivities. In this case, the last zero is dropped so as to keep the 5-digit format. This is why the regular postcodes for these do not end with 0 except for the préfecture or sous-préfecture, for example:

:Maison du Port
:97100 Basse-Terre

:4 boulevard du Général de Gaulle
:97320 Saint-Laurent du Maroni

:193 RN2
:97439 Sainte-Rose

==CEDEX==
There is also a system known as CEDEX, (&#x27;business mail with special delivery&#x27;), designed for recipients of large volumes of mail. A postal code is allocated to each large organisation or to post office box holders, ending in three unique digits, for example:
: 

CEDEX should always be written in capitals. It may be followed by a number, if the town has more than one post office, or if it is split into .

Ordinary deliveries would be addressed to:
: 

It is acceptable to include a (&#x27;post office box&#x27;) number (abbreviated as ) as well as the street address in CEDEX addresses.

==Monaco==

Although an independent country, Monaco is part of the French postal code system as if it were a French department, numbered, with codes consisting of 980 and two digits, with 00 being used for deliveries to all physical addresses in the Principality, and 01 to 99 being used for special types of delivery. However the destination country on inbound mail must be specified as &quot;Monaco&quot;, not &quot;France&quot;.

:12 avenue de la Costa
:98000 Monaco
:MONACO

:23 avenue Prince Héréditaire Albert
:98025 Monaco CEDEX
:MONACO

<doc id="664762" wikidata="Q651454" url="?curid=664762" title="TriStar Pictures">
<text>TriStar Pictures, Inc. (spelled as Tri-Star until 1991) is an American film studio and production company that is a member of the Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group, part of the multinational conglomerate Sony Group Corporation. It is a corporate sibling of fellow Sony studio, Columbia Pictures.

&quot;TriStar Pictures&quot; was established on March 2, 1982, founded by Victor Kaufman as Nova Pictures, and has ever since released some of the most iconic Hollywood movies, such as &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, &quot;Basic Instinct&quot;, &quot;&quot; and Hollywood’s first ever &quot;Godzilla&quot;. On May 16, 1983, its name was changed to Tri-Star in order to avoid confusion with the PBS series &quot;Nova&quot;.

Originally a joint venture between Columbia Pictures, CBS, and HBO, whose individual video units handled video, broadcast, and pay cable rights to its products, the company scored a number of box office hits with modestly-budgeted fare in the 1980s, as well as fortuitous distribution deals with the Producers Sales Organization, Carolco Pictures and the Taft Entertainment Group. It also expanded ambitiously throughout the decade with the acquisition of Loews Theatres and the formation of its own television arm. Among the various hits TriStar scored on its own during the decade were &quot;About Last Night&quot;, &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot;, &quot;Real Genius&quot;, &quot;Nothing in Common&quot;, &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot;, &quot;The Principal&quot;, &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking&quot; and &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot;.

On November 15, 1985, CBS dropped out of the joint venture, selling its stake to Columbia Pictures. HBO sold its shares to the same studio in 1986 in order to form HBO Pictures. On December 21, 1987, Tri-Star Pictures, Inc. was renamed Columbia Pictures Entertainment, Inc. following The Coca-Cola Company&#x27;s merger of Tri-Star and Columbia to become &quot;Columbia/Tri-Star&quot;, of which it owned 80% of its stock. In January 1988, CPE&#x27;s stocks somewhat fell, and Coca-Cola decreased its shares in CPE to 49%. On April 13, 1988, the name of the company reverted to Tri-Star Pictures, Inc. On November 8, 1989, the Sony Corporation of Japan acquired Columbia Pictures Entertainment for $3.4 billion. On August 7, 1991, under Sony Pictures Entertainment, the hyphen was officially removed from the name of the studio. TriStar became the first new American major film studio since RKO Pictures, which was founded in 1928.

During the 1990s, TriStar operated autonomously from Columbia. Although its products were mostly indistinguishable from that of its sister studio, it soon scored a string of hits at the box office with such films as &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot;, &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, &quot;The Mirror Has Two Faces&quot;, &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot;, &quot;As Good as It Gets&quot;, &quot;Bugsy&quot; and &quot;Jumanji&quot;, and it also scored a major video hit with Danny DeVito&#x27;s &quot;Matilda&quot;. However, in 1998, the company fell on hard times following the box office disappointment of an ambitious remake of the Japanese monster film &quot;Godzilla&quot;, and Sony quickly responded by merging the studio with Columbia to form the Columbia TriStar Motion Pictures Group. The TriStar name was subsequently used by Sony on a very limited basis until 2004, when the company decided to turn the studio into a genre label that specialized in acquisitions. In 2015, Sony formed TriStar Productions as a vehicle for film and television productions. TriStar Pictures is currently being used as a vehicle for distribution of products from that new entity and other items from Sony Pictures, including titles from Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions.

TriStar Pictures is a member of the Motion Picture Association (MPA).

==History==
===Early era (1982–1987)===
The concept for Tri-Star Pictures can be traced to Victor Kaufman, a senior executive of Columbia Pictures (then a subsidiary of the Coca-Cola Company), who convinced Columbia, HBO, and CBS to share resources and split the ever-growing costs of making movies, leading to the creation of a new joint venture on March 2, 1982. On May 16, 1983, it was given the name Tri-Star Pictures (when the new company was formed and did not have an official name, the press used the code-name &quot;Nova&quot;, but the name could not be obtained as it was being used as the title for the PBS science series). Tri-Star embarked on a 12 to 18 feature film slate per year, with a combined budget of $70 to $80 million and signed producer Walter Colbenz as vice president of the Tri-Star feature film studio, and signed initial development deals with director John Schlesinger and producers Jeffrey Walker and Michael Walker. Tri-Star&#x27;s first project to roll out was &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot;.

On May 11, 1984, the studio&#x27;s first produced film was released, &quot;The Natural&quot; starring Robert Redford. Tri-Star&#x27;s first release, however, was the film, &quot;Where the Boys Are &#x27;84&quot;; a 1984 remake of the 1960 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) picture, &quot;Where the Boys Are&quot; that was co-distributed on behalf of ITC Entertainment after Universal rejected it; the film was a commercial flop.

Many of Tri-Star&#x27;s productions were released on VHS by RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video, HBO/Cannon Video, or CBS/Fox Video. In addition, HBO owned exclusive cable distribution rights to the films, with broadcast television licenses going to CBS.

On May 8, 1984, Tri-Star Pictures secured North American distribution rights for the film &quot;Supergirl&quot; from Warner Bros., which enabled the film to be ready for distribution by Christmas 1984. On May 15, 1984, the studio hit big through its association with Carolco Pictures, with the release of &quot;&quot;, which eventually became a smash hit for the studio the following year. The company also partnered with Producers Sales Organization to handle theatrical distribution of the PSO titles, while both Tri-Star and Columbia struck a deal for film financing with Delphi Film Associates.

CBS dropped out of the Tri-Star venture in November 1985. HBO also dropped out of the venture and sold half of its shares to Columbia Pictures following a month. Despite the changes in majority ownership, Tri-Star continued ambition-laden expansion plans. Chief among these plans was an expansion of their successful relationship with Carolco; a new extension of their pre-existing deal included Tri-Star gaining theatrical distribution rights to various Carolco projects, including &quot;Rambo III&quot; and &quot;Air America;&quot; Carolco retained all foreign, cable, television and videocassette rights. Taft/Barish Productions, a joint venture of Taft Broadcasting and Keith Barish Productions, signed a $200 million domestic distribution deal with Tri-Star (much like Carolco, Taft/Barish retained non-theatrical and ancillary distribution rights). Of the four films to emerge from this pact, only &quot;The Running Man&quot; would become a major success.

Another avenue of expansion was acquiring the storied Loews Theaters chain of cineplexes in October 1986 for $300 million, after a deal to purchase United Artists Theaters from Tele-Communications, Inc. did not come to fruition. At the time, Loews had 260 theaters in six states.

1987 was another ambitious year for Tri-Star; plans were in place to take Tri-Star from a relatively new, untested film company into a major film studio. Components of these plans included the formation of TriStar Television, and joining forces with Stephen J. Cannell Productions and Witt/Thomas/Harris Productions to create a television distribution company known as TeleVentures; they also proposed forming their own home video label, Tri-Star Video, taking over from the trio of distributors (RCA/Columbia, CBS/Fox and HBO/Cannon). A full-on international distribution arm was also in the planning stages. Another distribution deal was signed by Tri-Star and Hemdale Film Corporation in September 1987, but only one film, &quot;High Tide&quot;, would result from that deal.

===Columbia Pictures Entertainment era (1987–1989)===
However, Tri-Star&#x27;s ambitions were curtailed by yet more change in ownership. The Coca-Cola Company boosted its stake in Tri-Star to 29.3% that September. That December, following several high-profile flops (including &quot;Ishtar&quot;), Coca-Cola began a plan to get out of the media industry; Tri-Star Pictures, Inc. was renamed as Columbia Pictures Entertainment, Inc., and Coca-Cola sold its entertainment business to Tri-Star for $3.1 billion. Coca-Cola would then gradually reduce their holdings in the new company to 49%. Both studios continued to produce and distribute films under their separate names; a new Tri-Star Pictures, Inc. entity was created in April 1988.

As a result, Tri-Star&#x27;s television division was consolidated into a single operating entity with Columbia/Embassy Television and Coca-Cola Television to form a new incarnation of Columbia Pictures Television. Merv Griffin Enterprises would continue to operate separately. Similarly, Tri-Star&#x27;s nascent video division was absorbed into RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video.

===Sony era (1989–present)===
In 1989, Columbia Pictures Entertainment, Inc. was acquired by Japanese conglomerate Sony Corporation, which merged Columbia and Tri-Star, but continued to use the separate labels. On July 11, 1990, Tri-Star Pictures dissolved and sold its venture in TeleVentures to Stephen J. Cannell Productions and TeleVentures became Cannell Distribution Co. Most of the series and the Tri-Star film packages that were distributed by TeleVentures were transferred to Columbia Pictures Television Distribution.
Sony Pictures Entertainment later revived TriStar Television as a television production banner in 1991 (by way of acquiring rights to shows from New World Television) and merged with its sister television studio Columbia Pictures Television (CPT) to form Columbia TriStar Television (CTT) on February 21, 1994. Both studios continued to operate separately under the CTT umbrella until TriStar Television folded in 1999 and CPT folded in 2001.

In addition to its own slate, TriStar Pictures was the theatrical distributor for many films produced by Carolco Pictures (the rights to only one of its films, &quot;Cliffhanger&quot;, has been retained by TriStar). TriStar Pictures also theatrically distributed some FilmDistrict films. In 1992, TriStar Pictures, along with Japan Satellite Broadcasting signed an agreement with The IndieProd Company to distribute movies produced by IndieProd in order to fill the void left by Carolco, whose deal with TriStar Pictures was on the verge of expiring amid financial troubles.

Around summer 1998, SPE merged Columbia and TriStar to form the Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Group, but just like Columbia Pictures Entertainment, both divisions continued producing and distributing films under their own names. Some of the movies slated to be released by TriStar Pictures, including &quot;Stepmom&quot; would go to its flagship label Columbia Pictures following the merger.

TriStar was relaunched on May 13, 2004, as a marketing and acquisitions unit that had a &quot;particular emphasis on genre films&quot;. Screen Gems&#x27; executive vice president Valerie Van Galder was tapped to run the revived studio after being dormant. However, the release of its 2013 film &quot;Elysium&quot; represented the label&#x27;s first big-budget release since &quot;The Mask of Zorro &quot;in 1998.

The same year, former 20th Century Fox co-chairman Tom Rothman joined Sony Pictures and created TriStar Productions as a joint venture with existing Sony Pictures executives. The new TriStar would develop, finance and produce up to four films per year, as well as television programming and acquisitions, starting on September 1. Sony&#x27;s TriStar &quot;Pictures&quot; unit is currently being retained for &quot;other product, including titles from Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions&quot;, and is distributing product from TriStar Productions.

==Logo==

TriStar&#x27;s logo features the winged horse Pegasus (either stationary or flying across the screen). The idea came from executive Victor Kaufman and his family&#x27;s interest in riding horses. The original logo was created with the assistance of Sydney Pollack, who was an adviser at Tri-Star. The horse in the original filmed logo was the same one used in Pollack&#x27;s film &quot;The Electric Horseman&quot;.

<text>Amblin&#x27; Entertainment, Inc., formerly named Amblin Productions, is an American film production company founded by director and producer Steven Spielberg, and film producers Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall in 1980. Its headquarters are located in Bungalow 477 of the Universal Studios backlot in Universal City, California. It distributes all of the films from Amblin Partners under the Amblin Entertainment banner.

==History==
Amblin is named after Steven Spielberg&#x27;s first commercially released film, &quot;Amblin&#x27;&quot; (1968), a short independent film about a man and woman hitchhiking through the desert. Costing $15,000 to produce, it was shown for Universal Studios and won Spielberg more directing roles. 

The company was established a year later, in 1969, and it was properly incorporated in 1970. On July 14, 1975, Spielberg signed a four-picture agreement with Universal Pictures to produce its feature films through his Amblin label, aiming to build upon the success of its first two theatrical pictures, &quot;The Sugarland Express&quot; and &quot;Jaws&quot;. Although Amblin is an independent production company, Universal distributes many Amblin productions, and Amblin operates out of a building on the Universal lot.

Amblin produced its first film, &quot;Continental Divide&quot;, in 1981, with Spielberg serving as executive producer. The following year, Spielberg and Marshall caught the attention of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), for which they both produced &quot;Poltergeist&quot; with Amblin, but under the name Steven Spielberg Productions. The same year, Spielberg and Kennedy produced &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; with Amblin uncredited (with Spielberg also directing it), which ended up being the highest-grossing film of the year.

In 1983, Spielberg produced &quot;Twilight Zone: The Movie&quot; with Amblin (with Marshall credited as an executive producer), but the company was uncredited. The company was reincorporated as Amblin Entertainment the following year, and the television division was formed that year. Amblin went on to produce a number of successful films throughout the 1980s, such as &quot;Gremlins&quot;, &quot;Innerspace&quot;, &quot;Batteries Not Included,&quot; &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, and the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; trilogy. &quot;Gremlins&quot; was the first film to use the company&#x27;s logo, which features the silhouette of Elliott flying in his bicycle with E.T. in the basket in front of the moon, from &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;.

In 1985, Spielberg and Don Bluth started a partnership to produce animated feature films. The only two films that were made from the Spielberg-Bluth deal were &quot;An American Tail&quot; (1986) and &quot;The Land Before Time&quot; (1988).

On November 5, 1986, Walt Disney Pictures and Amblin Entertainment teamed up to make &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, its first collaboration of such after collaborations working with Universal Pictures and Warner Bros. Pictures, which had a pre-existing joint deal. The film was directed by Robert Zemeckis, and it was slated for a G-rated feature, but it was upped to a PG-rated feature under the Touchstone Pictures label.

In 1987, Amblin Entertainment had named Brad Globe, former head of Lorimar&#x27;s marketing division, as vice president of marketing at the production company, and Globe himself would be joined by two special consultants, which were Martin J. Lewy and Gerry Lewis, and will work closely with the marketing department of the companies that released Amblin&#x27;s product.

In 1989, a dispute over film-making budgets caused Spielberg and Bluth to part ways. Amblin established their own animation unit, Amblimation, which was headquartered in London. The only three films that were released under the Amblimation banner were &quot;An American Tail: Fievel Goes West&quot; (1991), &quot;We&#x27;re Back: A Dinosaur&#x27;s Story&quot; (1993) and &quot;Balto&quot; (1995). The Amblimation label was shut down in 1997 and most of the studio staff was transferred to DreamWorks Animation, which Spielberg co-founded in 1994. Two more films were in development at the time Amblimation was shut down. The first was an animated film adaptation of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical &quot;Cats&quot; which was cancelled following the studio&#x27;s closure in 1997. The other was an animated film adaptation of a book written by William Steig, &quot;Shrek!&quot;, which was picked up by DreamWorks Animation and made into the 2001 animated film &quot;Shrek&quot;.

The same year, Amblin signed a deal with Turner Network Television to produce television films.

In 1991, founding partner Frank Marshall left the company after 10 years. The next year, Kathleen Kennedy left the company.

In 1992, Amblin launched a visual effects studio Amblin Imaging, headed by visual effects pioneer John Gross. It was later shut down in 1995.

In 1993, Walter Parkes and Laurie MacDonald joined the company.

On June 21, 2021, it was announced that Amblin Entertainment signed a deal with Netflix to release multiple new feature films for the streaming service. Under the deal, Amblin is expected to produce at least two films a year for Netflix for an unspecified number of years. It is possible that Spielberg may even direct some of the projects.

<text>The Elizabeth River is a tidal estuary forming an arm of Hampton Roads harbor at the southern end of Chesapeake Bay in southeast Virginia in the United States. It is located along the southern side of the mouth of the James River, between the cities of Portsmouth, Norfolk, and Chesapeake. Forming the core of the Hampton Roads harbor, it is heavily supported by its tributaries which depend upon it.

Through its Southern Branch and the Albemarle and Chesapeake Canal, the Elizabeth River also is a gateway to points to the south for the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, an inland path from the ocean providing a more sheltered navigable waterway to Florida for commercial and recreational boating.

== History ==
The Elizabeth River was named by the Jamestown colonists in the early 17th century for Princess Elizabeth Stuart, She was the daughter of King James I of England and a sister of the later King Charles I, and his older brother, Henry Frederick, the ill-fated heir-apparent to the throne who died of typhoid fever as a teenager.

When the settlers aboard the three tiny ships of Captain Christopher Newport&#x27;s 1607 voyage first discovered the great harbor of Hampton Roads a few days after reaching land at Cape Henry, they were seeking a pathway to the west to reach the &quot;Great Indies&quot; and soon sailed upriver along the largest and most likely westerly river, which they named the James (for their king), passing by the areas closest to the ocean as they sought a protected haven from other European forces such as the Spanish. Their settlement inland at Jamestown was flawed in many other ways, but did meet the requirement of providing protection. Settlement along the Elizabeth River came a few years later.

During the U.S. Revolutionary War, Lord Dunmore and the British Army sailed up the Elizabeth River and landed in Norfolk. The British Army and the U.S. Continental Army then engaged at the Battle of Great Bridge on December 9, 1775. Upon British defeat, Lord Dunmore and his army withdrew onto four ships of the British Royal Navy, the &quot;Dunmore&quot;, the &quot;Liverpool&quot;, the &quot;Otter&quot;, and the &quot;Kingfisher&quot;. Under the command of Lord Dunmore, these ships patrolled along Norfolk&#x27;s Elizabeth River waterfront and on New Year&#x27;s Day 1776, began shelling Norfolk in what would later become known as the Burning of Norfolk.

During the War of 1812, two harbor fortifications located on opposite banks of the Elizabeth River were occupied to prevent the British from attacking Norfolk or Portsmouth. These defensive positions were Fort Norfolk, located on the eastern bank in Norfolk, and Fort Nelson, located on the western bank in Portsmouth. Neither of these forts saw action during the War of 1812. However, the men stationed at Fort Norfolk reinforced Craney Island, located at the mouth of the Elizabeth River, and took part in the Battle of Craney Island.
== Geography ==
The main branch of the estuary is approximately long and is wide at its mouth. It is formed by three primary branches, all tidal, known as the Eastern, Southern, and Western branches of the Elizabeth River, extending into neighboring communities. The Western and Southern branches are partially fed by tributaries that originate within the Great Dismal Swamp.

== Importance and use ==
The Elizabeth River estuary and its tributaries provide significant military and commercial port facilities for Norfolk and Portsmouth, as well as a third major city, Chesapeake, which was formed by the voluntary political consolidation in 1963 of the small independent city of South Norfolk with much larger Norfolk County, which had long surrounded the other two large and expanding cities. The three cities surround the Elizabeth River and most of the area served by its three main branches. The Elizabeth River is the home of the oldest shipyard in the United States, the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. Founded as The Gosport Shipyard in 1767, the shipyard is still in use today having survived both the American Revolutionary and Civil wars and fires set to the shipyard within each conflict.

The river and its branches provide for both commerce and recreation activities. The Intracoastal Waterway connects to the greater Hampton Roads area through the Elizabeth River. They are of great importance to both commerce and the U.S. military considerations.

==Environmental concerns==
The Elizabeth River is a tributary of the Chesapeake Bay and faces significant environmental pollution challenges of its own that also hamper recovery in the Bay. The Elizabeth River&#x27;s history with various industrial sites, such as dry docks, Norfolk Naval Shipyard, processing plants, and both sewage and storm water discharge contributed over time to the declining health of the river. In 1983, the EPA mentions 
the Elizabeth River was singled out as one of the most highly polluted bodies of water in the entire Bay watershed and as of 2011 remains one of the most polluted rivers on the United States east coast. Sediment contamination has made &quot;toxic hot spots&quot; within the Elizabeth River. Notably, the Southern Branch of the river at Money Point had become a 35-acre biological dead-zone with a nearly entirely lifeless river floor. Creosote (high in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) from dumping and a major fire in 1963 played a major role in contaminating the river sediment there, which in some areas were as much as five feet thick.

The Commonwealth of Virginia entered into an agreement in 1995 after the Chesapeake Bay Program identified the Elizabeth River system as a &quot;Region of Concern&quot; in 1993. By 2003 a report entitled &quot;State of the River 2003&quot; by the Elizabeth River Project had been published, highlighting the sediment contamination in the Southern Branch along with other toxins including those causing cancer in some fish after a monitoring the river between 1999 and 2001. Efforts began in the 1990s and by 2003 bald eagles were returned to the watershed. 2008 saw the 3rd State Of The Elizabeth River report, prepared for the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, which finally provided data that most of the river was not suitable for swimming. At the same time, the report showed the most positive trends for improving levels of nutrients in Virginia compared to other areas of the Chesapeake Bay. In 2009, a pilot area was dredged at Money Point, replaced with clean sand, and restored with vegetation and artificial oyster reefs and in 2010 at least 17 species of fish and shellfish were found in the former toxic site where barely any life existed previously.
In 2011, dredging of the toxic sediment began, near Money Point as part of a larger initiative to help restore the Elizabeth River. Industries along the river are also voluntarily playing their part in restoring wetlands and oyster reefs in one of the largest restoration projects on the Chesapeake Bay.

== Crossings ==
Shipping has always been in competition with land-based transportation for crossings. Both activities are vital to the region.

Motor vehicles cross the main portion of the river using the Downtown Tunnel and the Midtown Tunnel. There are many other highway and railroad bridge crossings of the Eastern, Southern, and Western branches of the river of various ages and capacities, often with draw spans. The city of Chesapeake, with crossings of all three branches of the river by both railroads and highways of every type, and both bascule and swing-type draw spans, has the greatest number to contend with. In Chesapeake, the legal ownership and maintenance responsibilities are divided among the city, VDOT, and the railroads. In November 2012, the South Norfolk Jordan Bridge (SNJB) opened, a public-private partnership that allows the builder to toll for 50 years. The Bridge connects to Elm Avenue in Portsmouth and to Poindexter Street in Chesapeake. The bridge has no toll booths and relies on VDOT EZ-Pass transponders for payment or sends bills based on photography of license plates.

<doc id="664770" wikidata="Q1686629" url="?curid=664770" title="Ranked pairs">
<text>Ranked Pairs (RP), also known as the Tideman method, is a tournament-style system of ranked voting first proposed by Nicolaus Tideman in 1987.

If there is a candidate who is preferred over the other candidates, when compared in turn with each of the others, the ranked-pairs procedure guarantees that candidate will win. Therefore, the ranked-pairs procedure complies with the Condorcet winner criterion (and as a result is considered to be a Condorcet method).

Ranked pairs begins with a round-robin tournament, where the one-on-one margins of victory for each possible pair of candidates are compared to find a majority-preferred candidate; if such a candidate exists, they are immediately elected. Otherwise, if there is a Condorcet cycle—a rock-paper-scissors-like sequence A &gt; B &gt; C &gt; A—the cycle is broken by dropping the &quot;weakest&quot; elections in the cycle, i.e. the ones that are closest to being tied.

== Procedure ==
The ranked pairs procedure is as follows:

# Consider each pair of candidates round-robin style, and calculate the pairwise margin of victory for each in a one-on-one matchup.
# Sort the pairs by the (absolute) margin of victory, going from largest to smallest.
# Going down the list, check whether adding each matchup would create a cycle. If it would, cross out the election; this will be the election(s) in the cycle with the smallest margin of victory (near-ties).

At the end of this procedure, all cycles will be eliminated, leaving a unique winner who wins all of the remaining one-on-one matchups. The lack of cycles means that candidates can be ranked directly based on the matchups that have been left behind.

== Example ==

=== The situation ===
The results are tabulated as follows:
* [A] indicates voters who preferred the candidate listed in the column caption to the candidate listed in the row caption
* [B] indicates voters who preferred the candidate listed in the row caption to the candidate listed in the column caption

=== Tally ===
First, list every pair, and determine the winner:

The votes are then sorted. The largest majority is &quot;Chattanooga over Knoxville&quot;; 83% of the voters prefer Chattanooga. Thus, the pairs from above would be sorted this way:
=== Lock ===
The pairs are then locked in order, skipping any pairs that would create a cycle:

* Lock Chattanooga over Knoxville.
* Lock Nashville over Knoxville.
* Lock Nashville over Chattanooga.
* Lock Nashville over Memphis.
* Lock Chattanooga over Memphis.
* Lock Knoxville over Memphis.

In this case, no cycles are created by any of the pairs, so every single one is locked in.

Every &quot;lock in&quot; would add another arrow to the graph showing the relationship between the candidates. Here is the final graph (where arrows point away from the winner).

In this example, Nashville is the winner using the ranked-pairs procedure. Nashville is followed by Chattanooga, Knoxville, and Memphis in second, third, and fourth places respectively.

=== Summary ===
In the example election, the winner is Nashville. This would be true for any Condorcet method.

Under first-past-the-post and some other systems, Memphis would have won the election by having the most people, even though Nashville won every simulated pairwise election outright. Using instant-runoff voting in this example would result in Knoxville winning even though more people preferred Nashville over Knoxville.

== Criteria ==
Of the formal voting criteria, the ranked pairs method passes the majority criterion, the monotonicity criterion, the Smith criterion (which implies the Condorcet criterion), the Condorcet loser criterion, and the independence of clones criterion. Ranked pairs fails the consistency criterion and the participation criterion. While ranked pairs is not fully independent of irrelevant alternatives, it still satisfies local independence of irrelevant alternatives and independence of Smith-dominated alternatives, meaning it is likely to roughly satisfy IIA &quot;in practice.&quot;

=== Independence of irrelevant alternatives ===
Ranked pairs fails independence of irrelevant alternatives, like all other ranked voting systems. However, the method adheres to a less strict property, sometimes called independence of Smith-dominated alternatives (ISDA). It says that if one candidate (X) wins an election, and a new alternative (Y) is added, X will win the election if Y is not in the Smith set. ISDA implies the Condorcet criterion.

<doc id="664778" wikidata="Q17461" url="?curid=664778" title="Same-sex marriage in South Africa">
<text>Same-sex marriage has been legal in South Africa since the &quot;Civil Union Act, 2006&quot; came into force on 30 November 2006. The decision of the Constitutional Court in the case of &quot;Minister of Home Affairs v Fourie&quot; on 1 December 2005 extended the common-law definition of marriage to include same-sex spousesas the Constitution of South Africa guarantees equal protection before the law to all citizens regardless of sexual orientationand gave Parliament one year to rectify the inequality in the marriage statutes. On 14 November 2006, the National Assembly passed a law allowing same-sex couples to legally solemnise their union 229 to 41, which was subsequently approved by the National Council of Provinces on 28 November in a 36 to 11 vote, and the law came into effect two days later.

South Africa was the fifth country in the world to legalise same-sex marriage after the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Canada, and remains the only African country to have done so.

==History==

===Background===
South Africa was the first country in the world to safeguard sexual orientation as a human right in its Constitution. The Constitution of South Africa, which took effect on 4 February 1997, forbids discrimination on the basis of sex, gender or sexual orientation. These equality rights formed the basis for a series of court decisions granting specific rights to couples in long-term same-sex relationships:
* &quot;National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality v Minister of Justice&quot; (1998) decriminalised consensual sexual activities between men.
* &quot;Langemaat v Minister of Safety and Security&quot; (1998) recognised the reciprocal duty of support between same-sex partners, and extended health insurance benefits.
* &quot;National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality v Minister of Home Affairs&quot; (1999) extended immigration benefits to foreign partners of South African citizens.
* &quot;Satchwell v President of the Republic of South Africa&quot; (2002) extended remuneration and pension benefits.
* &quot;Du Toit v Minister of Welfare and Population Development&quot; (2002) allowed same-sex couples to adopt children jointly.
* &quot;J v Director General, Department of Home Affairs&quot; (2003) allowed both partners to be recorded as the parents of a child conceived through artificial insemination.
* &quot;Du Plessis v Road Accident Fund&quot; (2003) recognised the claim for loss of support when a same-sex partner is negligently killed.
* &quot;Gory v Kolver NO&quot; (2006) allowed inheritance of the estate of a partner who died intestate.

===The &quot;Fourie&quot; case===
In 2002, a lesbian couple, Marié Fourie and Cecelia Bonthuys, with the support of the Lesbian and Gay Equality Project, launched an application in the Pretoria High Court to have their union recognised and recorded by the Department of Home Affairs as a valid marriage. Judge Pierre Roux dismissed the application on 18 October 2002 on the technical basis that they had not properly attacked the constitutionality of the definition of marriage or the &quot;Marriage Act, 1961&quot;.

Fourie and Bonthuys requested leave to appeal to the Constitutional Court, but this was denied and the High Court instead granted leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA). They applied to the Constitutional Court for direct access, but this was denied on 31 July 2003; the court stated that the case raised complex issues of common and statutory law on which the SCA&#x27;s views should first be heard.

Fourie and Bonthuys therefore appealed the High Court judgment to the SCA, which handed down its decision on 30 November 2004. The five-judge court ruled unanimously that the common-law definition of marriage was invalid because it unconstitutionally discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation, and that it should be extended to read &quot;Marriage is the union of two persons to the exclusion of all others for life.&quot; The court further unanimously noted that because Fourie and Bonthuys had not challenged the &quot;Marriage Act&quot;, the court could not invalidate it, and, therefore, their marriage could not immediately be solemnized. The court divided, however, on whether the couple should be given an immediate remedy in implementing the new, wider common-law definition of marriage. The majority opinion, written by Judge Edwin Cameron, ruled that the new definition should apply immediately. In a dissenting opinion, Judge Ian Farlam was of the opinion that the court&#x27;s order declaring the common-law definition invalid should be suspended for two years to allow Parliament to adopt its own remedy for the situation.

The Government of South Africa appealed the SCA&#x27;s ruling to the Constitutional Court, arguing that a major alteration to the institution of marriage was for Parliament and not the courts to decide, while Fourie and Bonthuys cross-appealed, arguing that the &quot;Marriage Act&quot; should be altered as Judge Farlam had suggested. In the meanwhile, the Lesbian and Gay Equality Project had also launched a separate lawsuit directly attacking the constitutionality of the &quot;Marriage Act&quot;, which was originally to be heard in the Johannesburg High Court; the Constitutional Court granted the Project&#x27;s request to have it heard and decided simultaneously with the &quot;Fourie&quot; case.

On 1 December 2005, the Constitutional Court handed down its decision: the nine justices agreed unanimously that the common-law definition of marriage and the marriage formula in the &quot;Marriage Act&quot;, to the extent that they excluded same-sex partners from marriage, were unfairly discriminatory, unjustifiable, and therefore unconstitutional and invalid. In a widely quoted passage from the majority ruling, Justice Albie Sachs wrote:

There was some disagreement about the remedy: the majority (eight of the justices) ruled that the declaration of invalidity should be suspended for a year to allow Parliament to correct the situation, as there were different ways in which this could be done, and the Law Reform Commission had already investigated several proposals. If Parliament did not end the inequality by 1 December 2006, then words would automatically be &quot;read in&quot; to the &quot;Marriage Act&quot; to allow same-sex marriages. Justice Kate O&#x27;Regan dissented, arguing that these words should be read in immediately.

===Civil Union Act===
On 24 August 2006, the Cabinet approved the &quot;Civil Union Bill&quot; for submission to Parliament. The bill as initially introduced would only have allowed civil partnerships which would have been open only to same-sex couples and have the same legal consequences as marriage. It also included provisions to recognise domestic partnerships between unmarried partners, both same-sex and opposite-sex. The state law advisers, who screen laws for constitutionality and form, declined to certify the bill, suggesting that it failed to follow the guidelines laid down by the Constitutional Court. The Joint Working Group, a network of LGBT organisations, described the idea of a separate marriage law for same-sex couples as &quot;an apartheid way of thinking&quot;.

On 16 September, thousands of South Africans took to the streets in several cities to protest same-sex marriage. The minor opposition African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) pushed for a constitutional amendment to define marriage as between &quot;a man and a woman&quot;; this was rejected by the National Assembly&#x27;s Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs. Public hearings on the bill began on 20 September. On 7 October, the Marriage Alliance organised a march to the Union Buildings in Pretoria to hand a memorandum opposing same-sex marriage to government representatives. On 9 October, the governing African National Congress (ANC) voted to support the bill. Although the party had been split on the issue, the vote meant that ANC MPs would be obliged to support the bill in Parliament. The full party support came after members of the national executive committee reminded party members that the ANC had fought for human rights, which includes gay rights.

It was originally expected that the National Assembly would vote on the bill on 20 October in order to allow enough time for the National Council of Provinces to debate and vote on it ahead of the 1 December deadline. The vote was repeatedly delayed as the Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs was still involved in discussions. In response to the argument that &#x27;separate but equal&#x27; civil partnerships would not comply with the Constitutional Court&#x27;s ruling, the Portfolio Committee amended the bill to allow either marriages or civil partnerships, and to allow them to both same-sex and opposite-sex couples. The chapter dealing with the recognition of domestic partnerships was removed.

On 13 November, one day before the bill would be read for a final reading in the National Assembly, Defence Minister Mosiuoa Lekota said:
The amended bill was passed by the National Assembly on 14 November by 229 votes to 41, and by the National Council of Provinces on 28 November by 36 votes to 11. Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, acting for President Thabo Mbeki, signed it into law on 29 November, and it became law the following day, one day before the Constitutional Court&#x27;s order would otherwise have come into force. Minister of Home Affairs Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula said the law was only a temporary measure, noting that a fuller marriage law would be formulated to harmonise the several pieces of marriage legislation now in force.

The bill was hailed by gay and liberal activists as another step forward out of the country&#x27;s apartheid past, while at the same time some clergy and traditional leaders described it as &quot;the saddest day in our 12 years of democracy&quot;. Islamic leader Sheikh Sharif Ahmed called the bill a &quot;foreign action imposed on Africa&quot;. The law made South Africa the fifth country in the world to legalise same-sex marriage after the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Canada. The first couple to wed, Vernon Gibbs and Tony Halls, did so in George, the following day, 1 December 2006. They encountered no problems, and a second couple married later that day in the same location. In 2013, South Africa&#x27;s first traditional same-sex wedding was held for Tshepo Cameron Modisane and Thoba Calvin Sithole in KwaDukuza.

In January 2024, Jacob Zuma, who had served as president between 2009 and 2018, said his newly-formed uMkhonto we Sizwe party would overhaul laws permitting same-sex marriage if elected in the 2024 election. Zuma had previously stated in an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2012 that he opposed repealing the &quot;Civil Union Act&quot;.

=== Proposed uniform marriage bill ===

In October 2020, the Department of Home Affairs confirmed plans to introduce a new draft marriage policy in South Africa, reconciling the diverse marriage laws into a single piece of legislation &quot;that will enable South Africans of different sexual orientation, religious and cultural persuasions to conclude legal marriages&quot;, but indicated that the process had been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In January 2021, the South African Law Reform Commission issued a 300-page discussion paper, offering a number of proposals and alternatives. The commission called for public comments on its discussion paper. The proposed changes include reforms introducing a default property system, as spouses who have not entered into a formal marriage have no statutory rights to share in property which was amassed during the relationship, as well as the legalisation of polyandry. A draft bill was approved by the Cabinet, and published in the &quot;Government Gazette&quot; on 7 July 2023. The period for written submission was open until 31 August 2023. The bill was tabled in Parliament in December 2023, and was open for public comments until 17 May 2024. Some religious groups have made same-sex marriage the main focus of their opposition to the bill.

==Law==
Three laws currently provide for the status of marriage in South Africa. These are the &quot;Marriage Act&quot; (Act 25 of 1961), which provides for civil or religious opposite-sex marriages; the &quot;Recognition of Customary Marriages Act&quot; (Act 120 of 1998), which provides for the civil registration of marriages solemnised according to the traditions of indigenous groups; and the &quot;Civil Union Act&quot; (Act 17 of 2006), which provides for opposite-sex and same-sex civil marriages, religious marriages and civil partnerships. A person may only be married under one of these laws at any given time.

Couples marrying in terms of the &quot;Civil Union Act&quot; may choose whether their union is registered as a marriage or a civil partnership. In either case, the legal consequences are identical to those of a marriage under the &quot;Marriage Act&quot;, except for such changes as are required by the context. Any reference to marriage in any law, including the common law, is deemed to include a marriage or civil partnership in terms of the &quot;Civil Union Act&quot;; similarly, any reference to husband, wife or spouse in any law is deemed to include a reference to a spouse or civil partner in terms of the &quot;Civil Union Act&quot;.

===Restrictions===
The parties to a marriage or civil partnership must be 18 or older and not already married or civilly partnered. The prohibited degrees of affinity and consanguinuity that apply under the &quot;Marriage Act&quot; also apply under the &quot;Civil Union Act&quot;; thus a person may not marry his or her direct ancestor or descendant, sibling, uncle or aunt, niece or nephew, or the ancestor or descendant of an ex-spouse.

The &quot;Recognition of Customary Marriages Act, 1998&quot; allows, in limited circumstances, a man to marry multiple wives. A person married under the &quot;Civil Union Act&quot; may not enter into marriage with a second partner until the existing marriage is dissolved.

=== Solemnisation ===

Marriages and civil partnerships must be solemnised by an authorised marriage officer. Government officials (primarily magistrates and Home Affairs civil servants) who are appointed as marriage officers under the &quot;Marriage Act&quot; are also able to solemnise marriages in terms of the &quot;Civil Union Act&quot;. Religious leaders may also be appointed as marriage officers under the &quot;Civil Union Act&quot;, but religious leaders appointed under the &quot;Marriage Act&quot; are not automatically able to solemnise marriages in terms of the &quot;Civil Union Act&quot;.

Originally, government marriage officers who had an objection of conscience to solemnising same-sex marriages or civil partnerships were exempted from doing so if they noted their objection in writing to the Minister of Home Affairs. This provision did not apply to religious marriage officers because they are in any case not obliged to solemnise a marriage that would violate the doctrines of their religion. Several constitutional scholars argued that this provision was unconstitutional, calling it &quot;state-sanctioned discrimination&quot; in violation of the right to equality. In July 2017, more than a decade after same-sex marriage was legalised in South Africa, LGBT newspaper &quot;Mambaonline&quot; reported that 421 (out of 1,130) marriage officers in South Africa were exempt from performing same-sex marriages or civil partnerships, mostly in the Eastern Cape, the Free State and Mpumalanga. Media reported couples being denied marriage licenses in Pretoria, Gqeberha, Bloemfontein, East London, Alberton, oThongathi, and Richards Bay. A bill to repeal the exemption was introduced by MP Deidre Carter in January 2018. The bill was amended in Parliament to allow officials who previously did not marry same-sex couples to continue doing so for two years. This gave the Ministry of Home Affairs time to implement the new policy. New officials, however, cannot opt out at all for any time. If a branch had an official opting out for the two-year period, they had to have another official available who could perform the marriage. The measure passed the National Assembly on 6 December 2018 and the National Council of Provinces on 1 July 2020. It was signed into law by President Cyril Ramaphosa on 22 October 2020 as the &quot;Civil Union Amendment Act, 2020&quot;.

=== Discrimination ===
Discrimination against same-sex couples is prohibited (as is all discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation) by section 9 of the Constitution and by the &quot;Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act&quot;.

=== Recognition of foreign unions ===
The &quot;Civil Union Act&quot; makes no explicit provisions for the recognition of foreign same-sex unions. As a consequence of the extension of the common-law definition of marriage, and based on the principle of &quot;lex loci celebrationis&quot;, a foreign same-sex marriage is recognised as a marriage in South African law. However, the status of foreign forms of partnership other than marriage, such as civil unions or domestic partnerships, is not clear. In a 2010 divorce case, the Western Cape High Court recognised the validity of a British civil partnership as equivalent to a marriage or civil partnership in South African law.

=== Criticism of the focus on same-sex marriage ===
In a 2007 paper, constitutional scholar Pierre de Vos questioned the notion that the legalisation of same-sex marriage in South Africa represents the pinnacle of the human rights struggle of members of the LGBT community. He argued that those who are not involved in long-term monogamous relationships and those who cannot come out of the closet and get married because of the threat of victimisation may not see any benefit from the legislation.

==Historical and customary recognition==
Historically, Sotho society recognised &quot;motswalle&quot; relationships formed between women during adolescence. Often, a relationship was acknowledged publicly with a ritual feast and with the community fully aware of the women&#x27;s commitment to one another. relationships differed from a Western perspective of same-sex relationships. Women in relationships &quot;marr[ied] men and conform[ed], or appear[ed] to conform, to gender expectations&quot;, and did not have a different social identity even though they were in committed relationships with other women. Women in relationships also differed from a Western perspective of heterosexual female friends. Researcher William J. Spurlin wrote that &quot;it is important not to simply translate into English [the] use of the Sesotho word [...] as &quot;lesbian&quot;.&quot; Nevertheless, Spurlin stated that &quot;it might be possible to place relationships on the lesbian continuum to discuss, debate, and imagine them theoretically as possible sites of lesbian existence, given the close emotional and intimate bonds between the women, but with the stipulation that the relationships not be reduced to Western understandings of &quot;lesbian&quot;.&quot;

Female same-sex marriages (; ) are practiced among the Pedi and Venda peoples. However, this is not perceived as homosexual as understood from a Western perspective, but rather as a way for families without sons to keep their inheritance within the family. The couples are considered married, though are referred to as &quot;mother-in-law&quot; and &quot;daughter-in-law&quot;. The female &quot;husband&quot; (the &quot;mother-in-law&quot;) carries on the family name and property, while the female &quot;wife&quot; (the &quot;daughter-in-law&quot;) bears children, with the intention of having a son. The Rain Queen of the Lobedu was prohibited from having a male husband and was required instead to take a &quot;wife&quot;. South African anthropologist Hugh Stayt reported in 1931 that Venda women who had male husbands could acquire their own &quot;wives&quot; by paying a bride price in cattle, just as men did:
Contemporary oral evidence suggests that same-sex relationships were &quot;common&quot; and &quot;prevalent&quot; among Ndebele, Tsonga, Xhosa and Zulu miners in South Africa in the early 20th century. In 1912, Swiss-born missionary Henri-Alexandre Junod described &quot;elaborately organized homosexual relationships among miners&quot;. The younger partner, known as in the Tsonga language (which entered Zulu as ), was &quot;used to satisfy the lust&quot; of the older partner (). &quot;He received a wedding feast, and his elder brother received a bride price.&quot; Junod described a dance in which the donned wooden or cloth breasts, which they removed when paid to do so by their . A Tsonga local told Junod at the time: &quot;Each of these would propose a boy for himself, not only for the sake of washing his dishes, because in the evening the boy would have to go and join [him] on his bed. In that way he had become a wife. The husband would make love with him. The husband would penetrate his manhood between the boy&#x27;s thighs. Fidelity was expected, and jealousy on occasion led to violence.&quot; He added that male couples &quot;would quarrel just as husbands and wives do&quot;, and when asked whether the wished to become someone&#x27;s partner, he replied, &quot;Yes, for the sake of security, for the acquisition of property and for the fun itself.&quot; This practice gradually disappeared as South Africa became more modernized and exposed to Western culture and homophobia in the 20th century.

==Statistics==
According to the South African Government, over 3,000 same-sex couples had married in South Africa by mid-2010. Statistics South Africa reported that a total of 3,327 marriages and civil partnerships were registered under the &quot;Civil Union Act&quot; up to the end of 2011; however, this figure only reflects marriages in which at least one of the spouses is a South African citizen or permanent resident. Furthermore, not all marriages under the &quot;Civil Union Act&quot; are between partners of the same sex, though most opposite-sex couples continue to marry under the &quot;Marriage Act, 1961&quot;.

The Statistics South Africa data are further broken down by province and year; they show that the majority of same-sex marriages were registered in Gauteng and the Western Cape.
Lonely Planet has named Cape Town one of the world&#x27;s top 10 &quot;gay wedding destinations&quot;.

==Religious performance==
Most major religious organisations in South Africa do not perform or bless same-sex marriages in their places of worship. Religious institutions are not obliged to solemnise a marriage that would violate the doctrines of their faith. In 2007, the Department of Home Affairs confirmed that 17 religious denominations in South Africa had applied to officiate at same-sex marriages under the &quot;Civil Union Act&quot;.

In May 2009, a same-sex couple, Joe Singh, an Indian South African, and Wesley Nolan, were married in a traditional Hindu ceremony in Durban. The wedding was officiated by a Tamil priest, and was &quot;complete with embossed invitations, outfits from India and [the] tying [of] a necklace with a pendant of Lord Ganesha&quot;. Local Hindu leaders criticised the wedding ceremony. The South African Tamil Federation issued a statement that &quot;[it] do[es] not sanction such a union or the actions of the priest who sanctified it.&quot; Imam Muhsin Hendricks has performed several Muslim same-sex weddings since 1998. Some Jewish groups also perform same-sex marriages.

===Christian denominations===
The Anglican Church of Southern Africa does not permit same-sex marriages. Its marriage policies state that &quot;holy matrimony is the lifelong and exclusive union between one man and one woman&quot;. The Anglican Diocese of Cape Town passed a resolution in 2009 to give pastoral guidelines to same-sex couples who live in &quot;covenanted relationships&quot;. The resolution agreed to affirm &quot;a pastoral response to same-sex partnerships of faithful commitment in our parish families.&quot; In 2016, the synod voted against blessing same-sex unions. The decision split the church, with several dioceses deciding to nonetheless proceed with the blessing of same-sex relationships, notably the Diocese of Saldanha Bay. Archbishop Thabo Makgoba expressed disappointment with the decision not to bless same-sex unions, but added that &quot;all is not lost&quot;, expressing hope that the matter would be debated again in the future. Former Archbishop Njongonkulu Ndungane also expressed his disappointment with the decision. Former Archbishop Desmond Tutu supported the blessing of same-sex unions. His daughter, Mpho Tutu van Furth, married her partner Marceline van Furth, a Dutch professor of medicine, in the Netherlands in 2015. Shortly after the marriage, her license as a priest was withdrawn. Two Anglican pastors were also married in 2020. In early 2023, the church once again refused to allow its clergy to bless same-sex unions, but directed the synod to develop &quot;guidelines for providing pastoral ministry to those in same-sex relationships&quot;. In May 2024, Archbishop Makgoba released a document recommending prayers for same-sex couples, which the synod rejected in September.

In 2015, the General Synod of the Dutch Reformed Church voted by a 64% majority to recognise same-sex marriages, bless the relationships of same-sex couples and allow gay ministers and clergy (who are not required to be celibate). The decision applies to 9 of the 10 synods; with the Namibia Synod being excluded. The decision caused backlash and objections, resulting in it being reversed a year later. A dozen church members subsequently took the denomination to court to restore the 2015 decision. In 2019, the North Gauteng High Court reversed the decision, ruling that while religious organizations have the religious freedom to define marriage the 2016 decision was not made in accordance with the church&#x27;s own proper process. Individual pastors are free to choose whether to bless same-sex marriages; a freedom of conscience clause allows pastors with objections to opt out of performing same-sex weddings.

In 2015, the synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Southern Africa discussed same-sex unions but concluded that &quot;a marriage is understood as a union only between a man and a woman. Furthermore the valid and unchanged position of our Church is that the blessing of same sex unions is rejected.&quot; In 2020, the Methodist Church of Southern Africa voted to allow members, including ordained clergy, to enter into same-sex unions, while retaining the denomination&#x27;s teaching that marriage is a union &quot;between a man and a woman&quot;.

The Uniting Reformed Church in Southern Africa consists of seven regional synods. In October 2018, the southern synod, covering most of Gauteng and parts of Mpumalanga, voted to allow its clergy to perform same-sex marriages, polygamous marriages and ordain openly LGBT ministers.

The Catholic Church opposes same-sex marriage and does not allow its priests to officiate at such marriages. In December 2023, the Holy See published &quot;Fiducia supplicans&quot;, a declaration allowing Catholic priests to bless couples who are not considered to be married according to church teaching, including the blessing of same-sex couples. Archbishop of Cape Town Stephen Brislin issued a statement that &quot;the document states that the blessing should not be a ritual that is issued by the bishop or by the bishops&#x27; conference or any authority. It should be left to the pastor to spontaneously give a simple blessing that could be done at a shrine, on a pilgrimage, or in a prayer group.&quot; The Southern African Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference added that &quot;the document offers suggestions for when and how the blessings might be given. The Southern African Catholic Bishops Conference will guide further on how such a blessing may be requested and granted to avoid the confusion the document warns against. In the meantime, the suggestions offered by the declaration may be taken as a guide with prudence.&quot;

==Public opinion==

A 2014 survey found that voters from the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) were the most supportive of same-sex marriage, followed closely by voters from the Democratic Alliance (DA) and the African National Congress (ANC).

A 2015 Ipsos poll found that 45% of South Africans supported same-sex marriage, while a further 13% supported civil unions or another form of legal recognition. A report conducted by the Human Sciences Research Council on behalf of The Other Foundation was described by some media outlets as the first &quot;statistically sound, nationally representative data&quot; on LGBT issues in Africa. The report found that the proportion of those who &quot;strongly agree&quot; with same-sex marriage had increased tenfold from 2012 to 2015, from 1.5% to 9.9%, while the proportion of people &quot;strongly disagreeing&quot; dropped from 48.5% to 23.4%. The total of &quot;agree&quot; and &quot;strongly agree&quot; making 36.6% (13.5% in 2012), while the &quot;disagree&quot; and &quot;strongly disagree&quot; totaled 46% (78.5% in 2012), the remaining being undecided or neutral.

A September–October 2016 survey by the Varkey Foundation found that 54% of 18–21-year-olds supported same-sex marriage in South Africa.

A May 2021 Ipsos poll showed that 59% of South Africans supported same-sex marriage, 12% supported civil partnerships but not marriage, while 15% were opposed to all legal recognition for same-sex couples, and 14% were undecided. In addition, 18% of South Africans had already attended the wedding of a same-sex couple. According to a 2023 Ipsos poll, 57% of South Africans supported same-sex marriage, while 10% supported civil unions or other types of partnerships but not marriage, 14% were undecided and 19% were opposed to all recognition for same-sex couples. A Pew Research Center poll conducted between February and May 2023 showed that 38% of South Africans supported same-sex marriage, 58% were opposed and 4% did not know or had refused to answer. When divided by age, support was highest among 18–34-year-olds at 42% and lowest among those aged 35 and above at 34%. Women (45%) were also more likely to support same-sex marriage than men (30%).

<text>Frank Wilton Marshall (born September 13, 1946) is an American film producer and director. He often collaborates with his wife, film producer Kathleen Kennedy, with whom he founded the production company Amblin Entertainment, along with Steven Spielberg. In 1991, he founded, with Kennedy, The Kennedy/Marshall Company, a film production company. Since May 2012, with Kennedy taking on the role of President of Lucasfilm, Marshall has been Kennedy/Marshall&#x27;s sole principal.

Marshall has worked with directors such as Spielberg, Paul Greengrass, Peter Bogdanovich, David Fincher, M. Night Shyamalan, and Robert Zemeckis. He has also directed the films &quot;Arachnophobia&quot; (1990), &quot;Alive&quot; (1993), &quot;Congo&quot; (1995), &quot;Eight Below&quot; (2006), and the documentaries &quot;The Bee Gees: How Can You Mend a Broken Heart&quot; (2020), &quot;Jazz Fest: A New Orleans Story&quot; (2022) and &quot;The Beach Boys&quot; (2024).

Marshall has produced various successful film franchises, including &quot;Indiana Jones&quot;, &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, &quot;Bourne&quot; and &quot;Jurassic World&quot;, and has received five nominations for the Academy Award for Best Picture. His other accolades include the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award, bestowed by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to &quot;creative producers, whose bodies of work reflect a consistently high quality of motion picture production&quot;, the David O. Selznick Achievement Award in Theatrical Motion Pictures, a Grammy Award, a Sports Emmy Award, and a Tony Award. Marshall is one of the few people to have received an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony (EGOT), with one of the awards being non-competitive.

== Early life and education ==
Born in Glendale, California, Marshall is the son of guitarist, conductor and composer Jack Marshall. His early years were spent in Van Nuys, California. In 1961, his family moved to Newport Beach, where he attended Newport Harbor High School, and was active in music, drama, cross country, and track. He entered UCLA in 1964 as an engineering major, and graduated in 1968 with a degree in Political science. While at UCLA, he was initiated into Alpha Tau Omega fraternity, helped create its first NCAA soccer team, and played collegiate soccer there in 1966, 1967 and 1968.

== Career ==
In 1966, he met film director Peter Bogdanovich at a birthday party for the daughter of director John Ford, a friend of his father. Marshall volunteered to work on Bogdanovich&#x27;s first film, &quot;Targets&quot; (1968), which became his apprenticeship in film production, as he assumed various productions roles, even appearing in a bit part. Following graduation from UCLA, Marshall spent the next two years working in Aspen and Marina del Rey, as a waiter/guitar player at &quot;The Randy Tar,&quot; a steak and lobster restaurant. While traveling through Europe in March 1970, he received another call from Bogdanovich, offering him a position on &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; (1971). Three days later he arrived in Archer City, Texas, doubling as location manager and actor in this seminal film. Under Bogdanovich&#x27;s guidance, Marshall would work his way up from producer&#x27;s assistant to associate producer on five more films. He branched out to work with Martin Scorsese as a line producer on the music documentary &quot;The Last Waltz&quot; (1978) and as an associate producer on director Walter Hill&#x27;s gritty crime thriller, &quot;The Driver&quot; (1978). The following year, Marshall earned his first executive producer credit on Hill&#x27;s cult classic street gang movie, &quot;The Warriors&quot; (1979) and first producer credit on George Lucas and Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981). He continued to collaborate with Bogdanovich, completing their tenth film together, Orson Welles&#x27; unfinished &quot;The Other Side of the Wind&quot; in 2018.
In 1981, together with his future wife Kathleen Kennedy and Steven Spielberg, he co-founded Amblin Entertainment, one of the industry&#x27;s most productive and profitable production companies. As a producer, Marshall has received five Oscar nominations for Best Picture for &quot;The Curious Case of Benjamin Button&quot; (2008), &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; (2003), &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; (1999), &quot;The Color Purple&quot; (1985), and &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981).
During the 1980s and 1990s, Marshall served on the advisory board of the National Student Film Institute.

His feature film directing debut was the thriller &quot;Arachnophobia&quot; (1990), starring Jeff Daniels. In 1991, he and Kennedy created The Kennedy/Marshall Company and began producing their own films. Marshall directed the company&#x27;s first film, &quot;Alive&quot; (1993), about a rugby team struggling to survive in the snow after their plane crashes in the Andes. Next, he directed &quot;Congo&quot; (1995), based on Michael Crichton&#x27;s novel, followed by &quot;Eight Below&quot; (2006), an adventure about loyalty and the bonds of friendship set in the extreme wilderness of Antarctica. In 1998, he directed the episode &quot;Mare Tranquilitatis&quot;, for the Emmy Award-winning HBO miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;. As part of ESPN&#x27;s &quot;30 for 30&quot; series, Marshall directed a documentary about Olympian Johann Olav Koss entitled &quot;Right to Play&quot; (2012). (the name of Koss&#x27;s humanitarian organisation). Marshall stated that the documentary, broadcast in 2012, sought to capture not only Koss&#x27; sporting career and the ideals behind his nonprofit organization, but also his &quot;drive and how it has changed the world.&quot;

From 1991 to 2012, The Kennedy/Marshall Company produced many films, including &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, &quot;Signs&quot;, &quot;Seabiscuit&quot;, &quot;The Curious Case of Benjamin Button&quot;, &quot;War Horse&quot;, &quot;Lincoln&quot;, &quot;Sully&quot;, the &quot;Bourne&quot; series and the feature documentary &quot;The Armstrong Lie&quot; (2013). Since taking over as sole principal of the company, Marshall has broadened its slate beyond feature films to include television, documentaries and Broadway musicals. Those include the summer blockbuster series &quot;Jurassic World&quot;, Orson Welles&#x27;s final film, &quot;The Other Side of the Wind&quot;, and the Emmy Award-nominated documentaries &quot;&quot;, &quot;Laurel Canyon&quot;, and &quot;McCartney 3,2,1&quot;. In 2020, he directed the Hélder Guimarães virtual magic shows &quot;The Present&quot; and &quot;The Future&quot; for the Geffen Stayhouse, both which had sold-out runs and &quot;The Bee Gees: How Can You Mend a Broken Heart&quot;, which was nominated for six Emmys. In 2022, he produced the Tony-award-winning musical &quot;A Strange Loop&quot; and co-directed the Grammy-winning documentary &quot;Jazz Fest: A New Orleans Story&quot;. His 2023 productions included &quot;Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny&quot; and &quot;Good Night, Oscar&quot;, starring Tony Winner Sean Hayes. In 2024, Marshall directed &quot;The Hope Theory&quot; at Geffen Playhouse with Helder Guimarães, &quot;The Beach Boys&quot; documentary for Disney+ and produced &quot;Twisters&quot; for Universal Pictures.

== Personal life ==
Marshall is a former VP, member of the board of directors and member of the Executive Committee of the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC). He was awarded the Olympic Shield in 2005, and inducted into the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame class of 2008 for his years of service to the USOPC.

Currently, he serves on the board of Athletes for Hope, as Board Co-Chair of The Archer School for Girls, the UCLA School of Theater, Film &amp; Television Executive Board, and the BAFTA North America Board. He is a recipient of the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented alongside Kathleen Kennedy by Awards Council member George Lucas, the UCLA Alumni Professional Achievement Award and the California Mentor Initiative&#x27;s Leadership Award. In June 2004, Marshall gave the Commencement Address at the UCLA College of Letters and Science graduation ceremony in Pauley Pavilion.

Marshall enjoys magic and music and has performed under the moniker of &quot;Dr. Fantasy&quot; or &quot;DJ Master Frank&quot;. Marshall, a long distance runner, and American premiere miler Steve Scott founded the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Marathon Series, which debuted in 1998 in San Diego as the largest first-time marathon in history.

<doc id="664786" wikidata="Q72919" url="?curid=664786" title="Marie-José of Belgium">
<text>Marie-José of Belgium (Marie-José Charlotte Sophie Amélie Henriette Gabrielle; 4 August 1906 – 27 January 2001) was the last Queen of Italy. Her 34-day tenure as queen consort earned her the nickname &quot;the May Queen&quot; ().

==Early life==

Princess Marie-José was born in Ostend, the youngest child of King Albert I of the Belgians and his consort, Duchess Elisabeth in Bavaria. Through her mother she was a grandniece of Empress Elisabeth of Austria and of Maria Sophie of Bavaria, last queen consort of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. During the First World War, she was evacuated to England where she was a boarding pupil at the Brentwood Ursuline Convent High School in Brentwood, Essex. She later attended the Santissima Annunziata Boarding School in Florence, Italy, where she first met her future husband. In 1924, Marie-José attended her first court ball. For the occasion she was given an antique pearl and diamond tiara that had originally been owned by Stéphanie de Beauharnais.

During the First World War, the Princess resided mainly in Great Britain but was often escorted by the Belgian King&#x27;s Messenger, Archibald Alexander Gordon to her parents in Belgium. In 1918, the Princess reprimanded Major Gordon when he called her rabbit Marshal Soult by the name Soult. The princess explained that if she called for &quot;Gordon&quot;, no one would be able to understand who she meant. Still, if she addressed him as Major Gordon, everyone would understand her because everyone knew who Major Gordon was.

==Marriage and children==

On 8 January 1930, she married Crown Prince Umberto of Italy, from the House of Savoy, at the Quirinal Palace in Rome, and so became Princess of Piedmont (Italian: &quot;Principessa di Piemonte&quot;).

Among the wedding gifts was a turquoise and diamond parure, worn by the bride at her pre-wedding reception, and a diamond bow worn as a sash decoration at state occasions.

The couple had four children:
*Princess Maria Pia of Savoy (24 September 1934), who married Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia on 12 February 1955 and was divorced in 1967. Four children were born during the marriage. She remarried to Prince Michel of Bourbon-Parma in 2003.
*Vittorio Emanuele, Prince of Naples (12 February 1937 — 3 February 2024), who married Marina Ricolfi Doria on 7 October 1971. They had one son.
*Princess Maria Gabriella of Savoy (24 February 1940), who married Robert Zellinger de Balkany on 21 June 1969 and was divorced in November 1990. They have issue.
*Princess Maria Beatrice of Savoy (2 February 1943), who married Luis Reyna-Corvallán y Dillon on 1 April 1970, and has issue.

==Princess of Piedmont==
In October 1939, Princess Marie-José was made President of the Red Cross in Italy. The Princess and Duchess of Aosta attended the ceremony where Marie-José was installed as President of the Italian Red Cross.

During the Second World War she was one of the very few diplomatic channels between the German/Italian camp and the other European countries involved in the war, as she was the sister of Leopold III of Belgium (kept hostage by the German forces) and at the same time, as the wife of the heir to the throne, close to some of the ministers of Benito Mussolini&#x27;s cabinet. A British diplomat in Rome recorded that the Princess of Piedmont was the only member of the Italian Royal Family with good political judgment.

Mussolini&#x27;s mistress, Claretta Petacci, claimed in her diary that in 1937 the then princess and wife of the heir to the throne tried and failed to seduce the dictator at a beach resort near Rome. However, Mussolini&#x27;s son, Romano, claims that the princess and the dictator entered into a sexual relationship.

In 1943, the Crown Princess involved herself in vain attempts to arrange a separate peace treaty between Italy and the United States; her interlocutor from the Vatican was Monsignor Giovanni Battista Montini, a senior diplomat who later became Pope Paul VI. She also interceded with Adolf Hitler to ask for mercy towards the people of Belgium.

Her attempts were not sponsored by the king and Umberto was not (directly, at least) involved in them. After her failure (she never met the American agents), she was sent with her children to Sarre, in the Aosta Valley, and isolated from the political life of the Royal House.

She sympathised with the partisans, and while she was a refugee in Switzerland, smuggled weapons, money and food for them. She was nominated for appointment as chief of a partisan brigade, but declined.

==Queen for a month==

Following Italy&#x27;s defection to the Allied side in the war, her discredited father-in-law, King Victor Emmanuel III, withdrew from government. Her husband became regent under the title of Lieutenant General of the Realm. He and Marie-José toured war torn Italy, where they made a positive impression. However, King Victor Emmanuel III refused to abdicate until only weeks before the referendum.

Upon the eventual abdication on 9 May 1946 of her father-in-law, Marie-José became Queen consort of Italy, and remained such until the monarchy was abolished by referendum on 2 June 1946, effective 12 June 1946.

Umberto and Marie-José had been widely praised for their performance over the last two years, and it has been argued that had Victor Emmanuel abdicated sooner their relative popularity might have saved the monarchy. Following the monarchy&#x27;s defeat (54–46%), she and her husband left the country for exile on 13 June 1946.

==Exile==
In exile, the family gathered for a brief time on the Portuguese Riviera, but she and Umberto separated. She and their four children soon left for Switzerland, where she lived most of the time for the rest of her life, while Umberto remained in Portugal. However, the couple, both of whom were devout Catholics, never divorced. The republican constitution forbade the restoration of the monarchy and also barred all male members of the House of Savoy, as well as former queens consort, from returning to Italian soil.

==Death==
For some time, she lived in Mexico with her youngest daughter, Princess Maria Beatrice, and her grandchildren.

Queen Marie-José returned to Italy after her husband&#x27;s death in 1983. She died of lung cancer on 27 January 2001, at the age of 94, in a clinic in Thônex near Geneva. She survived her two brothers and some of her nieces and nephews, including King Baudouin of the Belgians.

The funeral was held at Hautecombe Abbey, in Savoy in the south of France, and was attended by 2,000 mourners. Among them were King Albert II of the Belgians, King Juan Carlos I of Spain and Farah Pahlavi, the last Empress of Iran. She was buried in Hautecombe Abbey alongside her husband.

==Musical foundation==
Like her mother, Duchess Elisabeth in Bavaria, Marie-José inspired a musical contest. In 1959 she established the Fondation du prix de composition Reine Marie-José. It awarded its biennial prizes for the first time the following year. The first prize at the 1960 Concours was awarded to Giorgio Ferrari for his &quot;Quatuor à cordes avec une voix chantée&quot;. Subsequent prize winners have included William Albright (1968), Georg Katzer (1978), and Javier Torres Maldonado (2000). The 2017 prize was awarded to Jaehyuck Choi.

<text>The Free Library of Philadelphia is the public library system that serves the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It is the 16th-largest public library system in the United States. The Free Library of Philadelphia is a non-Mayoral agency of the City of Philadelphia governed by an independent Board of Trustees as per the Charter of the City of Philadelphia. The Free Library of Philadelphia Foundation is a separate 501(c)(3) non-profit with its own board of directors and serves to support the mission of the Free Library of Philadelphia through philanthropic dollars.

==History==
===Founding===
The Free Library of Philadelphia was chartered in 1891 as &quot;a general library which shall be free to all&quot;, through efforts led by Dr. William Pepper, who secured initial funding through a $225,000 bequest from his wealthy uncle, George S. Pepper. However, several libraries claimed the bequest, and only after the courts decided the money was intended to found a new public library did the Free Library finally open in March 1894. Its first location was three cramped rooms in City Hall. On February 11, 1895, the library was moved to the old Concert Hall at 1217-1221 Chestnut Street.

Library officials criticized their new home as &quot;an entirely unsuitable building, where its work is done in unsafe, unsanitary and overcrowded quarters, temporary make-shifts&quot;. On December 1, 1910, the Library was moved again, to the northeast corner of 13th and Locust Streets. Today, the Free Library of Philadelphia system, comprising 54 neighborhood library locations and the Rosenbach, advances literacy, guides learning, and inspires curiosity with millions of digital and physical materials; 28,000 yearly programs and events; free public computers and Wi-Fi; and rich special collections. With more than 6 million in-person visits and millions more online annually, the Free Library and the Rosenbach are among the most widely used educational and cultural institutions in Philadelphia and boast a worldwide impact.

===Parkway Central Library===
On June 2, 1927, the Parkway Central Library opened for service at its present location at 1901 Vine Street on Logan Square. The building had been in planning since 1911; various obstacles, including World War I, held up progress. The grand Beaux-Arts building was designed by Julian Abele, chief designer in the office of prominent Philadelphia architect Horace Trumbauer, and first opened its doors in 1927. Its design, that of the adjacent Philadelphia Family Court building, and their placement on Logan Circle closely follow that of the Hôtel de Crillon and the Hôtel de la Marine on Paris&#x27;s Place de la Concorde.

===Mission===

The mission of the Free Library of Philadelphia is &quot;to advance literacy, guide learning, and inspire curiosity.&quot;

==Services==

===Programs===
The Free Library of Philadelphia hosts more than 25,000 events each year, including job-search workshops, small business programming, English as a Second Language conversation groups, and computer classes. Many of these programs and services are funded in whole or in part by The Free Library of Philadelphia Foundation, a not-for-profit which exists to supplement the funds available through the City of Philadelphia for activities at the Free Library of Philadelphia. The Free Library&#x27;s Culinary Literacy Center, which opened in the spring of 2014 at the Parkway Central Library, offers culinary classes for children, teens, families, and adults to teach literacy skills through cooking as well as math, chemistry, nutrition, and health. The Library hosts a renowned Author Events Series produced through its Foundation, which brings more than 100 writers, politicians, scientists, researchers, and musicians to the Free Library annually. The Library Foundation also supports the Library in hosting the citywide &quot;One Book, One Philadelphia&quot; program, which encourages all Philadelphians to read and discuss the same book, fostering community and connection; the Summer Reading program, which engages some 50,000 Philadelphia school children each summer; and the Literacy Enrichment After-school Program (LEAP). In addition, the Free Library hosts months-long celebrations of literary milestones, from the birthdays of influential writers like Charles Dickens and William Shakespeare to the publication anniversaries of groundbreaking titles like &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; and &quot;Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;.

The Free Library Foundation also manages READ by 4th, a citywide effort of public and private organizations aiming to significantly increase the number of students in Philadelphia entering the 4th grade at reading level by 2020. READ by 4th&#x27;s comprehensive strategy includes improving early learning, providing parents with resources to teach their children reading skills, emphasizing summer reading and other strategies to prevent learning loss, decreasing absenteeism by addressing behavioral and health concerns, and enhancing reading instruction in schools.

===Digital services===

The Free Library&#x27;s digital offerings include nearly 300,000 streaming or downloadable ebooks; 1,000 public computers; 1,700-plus author event podcasts; 150 online databases; daily homework and computer literacy classes online; Hot Spot community computer training centers; and the roving Techmobile.

====Hot Spots initiative====

In March 2011, the library launched Free Library Hot Spots, placing new computer labs and computer trainers in existing community centers in low-income areas of the city. The initiative was funded by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation and the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program. Each Hot Spot provides computers, internet access, printers, and a small selection of Free Library materials. (These are in addition to the 650 public-access computers and free WiFi throughout the Free Library&#x27;s 54 branches.)

In April 2012, the Free Library added The Techmobile, a Hot Spot on Wheels, which brings service to neighborhoods throughout Philadelphia. The Techmobile has six public laptops.

===Impact===

According to a study conducted by Penn&#x27;s Fels Institute of Government, in 2017 nearly 25,000 people learned to read or taught someone else to read solely because of the resources of the Free Library. In addition, nearly 1,000 people found jobs based on the career resources of the Free Library, and some 8,600 entrepreneurs were able to start, grow or improve their small businesses because of programs and resources available free of charge at the Library.

==Special collections==
Located at the Parkway Central Library, the Free Library&#x27;s Special Collections span genres and generations, from ancient cuneiform tablets to historic photographs of Philadelphia.

The Free Library of Philadelphia&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Literature Research Collection houses an extensive research collection of children&#x27;s literature published after 1836.

The Rare Book Department features one of the world&#x27;s most renowned Charles Dickens collections, with first editions, personal letters, and Dickens’ stuffed pet raven, Grip, as well as extensive collections of illuminated manuscripts, Americana, Beatrix Potter, early children&#x27;s books, Edgar Allan Poe, Pennsylvania German folk art, and more. The collection includes over 50 Books of Hours and numerous bibles, liturgical texts, and psalters, including the Lewis Psalter (Lewis E M 185), a masterpiece of Parisian illumination from the reign of Saint Louis.

The Free Library&#x27;s music collections include the Edwin A. Fleisher Collection of Orchestral Music, the largest lending library of orchestral performance sets in the world.

Additionally, the Rosenbach Museum &amp; Library is a subsidiary of the Free Library of Philadelphia Foundation.

==Neighborhood libraries==
In addition to the Parkway Central Library and the Rosenbach in downtown Philadelphia, the system operates 54 neighborhood and regional library locations throughout the city. Many of these locations were funded by Andrew Carnegie, who donated US$1.5 million to the library in 1903. The Parkway Central Library and twenty extant Carnegie-funded branch libraries were documented by the Historic American Buildings Survey in 2007, as noted in the HABS column of the table below.

<doc id="664792" wikidata="Q192435" url="?curid=664792" title="Tripolitania">
<text>Tripolitania (), historically known as the Tripoli region, is a historic region and former province of Libya.

The region had been settled since antiquity, first coming to prominence as part of the Carthaginian empire. Following the defeat of Carthage in the Punic Wars, Ancient Rome organized the region (along with what is now modern day Tunisia and eastern Algeria), into a province known as Africa, and placed it under the administration of a proconsul. During the Diocletian reforms of the late 3rd century, all of North Africa was placed into the newly created Diocese of Africa, of which Tripolitania was a constituent province.

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century, Tripolitania changed hands between the Vandals and the Byzantine Empire, until it was taken during the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb in the 8th century. It was part of the region known to the Islamic world as Ifriqiya, whose boundaries roughly mirrored those of the old Roman province of Africa Proconsularis. Though nominally under the suzerainty of the Abbasid Caliphate, local dynasties such as the Aghlabids and later the Fatimid Caliphate were practically independent. The native Berbers, who had inhabited the area locally for centuries before the arrival of the Arabs, established their own native Hafsid dynasty over Ifriqiya in the 13th century, and would control the region until it was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in the 15th century, who established Ottoman Tripolitania as a distinct province. Tripolitania became an Italian colony in 1911. 

After the 1934 formation of Libya, the Tripolitania province was designated as one of the three primary provinces of the country, alongside Cyrenaica province to the east and Fezzan province to the south.

== Definition ==

Historically, the name Tripoli designated a region rather than a city, just as today in Arabic the same word Tarablus (طرابلس) is used for both the city and the region. The Arabic word used alone would be understood to mean only the city; in order to designate Tripolitania in Arabic, a qualifier such as &quot;state&quot;, &quot;province&quot; or &quot;sha&#x27;biyah&quot; is required.

The region of Tripoli or Tripolitania derives from the Greek name &quot;three cities&quot;, referring to Oea, Sabratha and Leptis Magna. Oea was the only one of the three cities to survive antiquity, and became known as Tripoli. Today Tripoli is the capital city of Libya and the northwestern portion of the country.

In addition to Tripoli, the following are among the largest and most important cities of Tripolitania: Misrata, Zawiya (near ancient Sabratha), Gharyan, Khoms (near ancient Leptis Magna), Tarhuna and Sirte.

== History ==
===Antiquity===
The city of &quot;Oea&quot;, on the site of modern Tripoli, was founded by the Phoenicians in the 7th century BC. It was conquered for a short time by the Greek colonists of Cyrenaica, who were in turn displaced by the Punics of Carthage. The Roman Republic captured Tripolitania in 146 BC, and the area prospered during the Roman Empire period. The Latin name &quot;Regio Tripolitania&quot; dates to the 3rd century. The Vandals took over in 435, and were in turn supplanted by the counter offensive of the Byzantine Empire in the 530s, under the leadership of emperor Justinian the Great and his general Belisarius.

===Middle Ages===
In the 7th century, Tripolitania was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate, and its successors, the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates, inherited it.

The Fatimid Caliphate, founded by Isma&#x27;ili Muslims in 909 in Raqqada, Tunisia, ruled the area from Tunisia to Syria. In the 1140s, the Italo-Normans invaded Tripoli and created the brief Kingdom of Africa, which the Almohad Caliphate destroyed in 1156. Abu Zakariya Yahya, a vassal of the Almohads, established an independent state in Tunisia in 1229 and took control of Tripolitania shortly after. He founded the Hafsid dynasty, which controlled the region until the 16th century. During that century, wars between the Ottomans and the states ruled by the House of Habsburg repeatedly led to the region changing alliances, although the Hafsids continued to rule. Hafsid rule ended when the Ottoman Empire brought Abu Abdallah Muhammad VI ibn al-Hasan to Constantinople in 1574 and executed him.

===Modern history===

Ottoman Tripolitania () extended beyond the region of Tripolitania proper, also including Cyrenaica. Tripolitania became effectively independent under the rulers of the Karamanli dynasty in 1711 until Ottoman control was re-imposed by Mahmud II in 1835. Ottoman rule persisted until the region was captured by Italy in the 1911–1912Italo-Turkish War. Italy officially granted autonomy after the war but gradually occupied the region.
After World War I, an Arab republic, &quot;Al-Jumhuriya al-Trabulsiya&quot;, or &quot;Tripolitanian Republic&quot;, declared the independence of Tripolitania from Italian Libya. Its proclamation in autumn 1918 was followed by a formal declaration of independence at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, which drafted the Treaty of Versailles. It was the first formally declared republican form of government in the Arab world, but it gained little support from international powers and had disintegrated by 1923. Italy, under the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, had managed to re-establish full control over Libya by 1930.

Originally administered as part of a single colony, Italian Tripolitania was a separate colony from 26 June 1927 to 3 December 1934, when it was merged into Libya. The Italian fascists constructed the Marble Arch as a form of an imperial triumphal arch at the border between Tripolitani and Cyrenaica near the coast.

Tripolitania experienced a huge development in the late 1930s, when the Italian Fourth Shore was created with the Province of Tripoli, with Tripoli as a modern &quot;westernized&quot; city. The Tripoli Province (&quot;Provincia di Tripoli&quot; in Italian) was established in 1937, with the official name being &quot;Commissariato Generale Provinciale di Tripoli&quot;. It was considered a province of the Kingdom of Italy and lasted until 1943.
During World War II, several back-and-forth campaigns with mobile armour vehicles ebbed and flowed across the North African coastal deserts between first Fascist Italians and the British, soon joined by the Nazi Germans in 1941. Libya was finally occupied by the western Allies, with the British moving west from Egypt after their victory at El Alamein in October 1942 against German Field Marshall Erwin Rommel and his Afrika Korps and the Americans from the west after landings in Operation Torch in Morocco and Algeria in November 1942. From 1942 and past the end of the war in 1945 to 1951, when Libya gained independence, Tripolitania and the region of Cyrenaica were administered by the British Military Administration. Italy formally renounced its claim upon the territory in 1947.

Tripolitania retained its status as a province in the Kingdom of Libya from 1951 to 1963, when it was replaced by a new system of governorates, which divided Tripolitania into the governorates of Khoms, Zawiya, Jabal al Gharbi, Misrata, and Tarabulus.

The Modern Latin missionary jurisdiction was called the Apostolic Vicariate of Tripolitana but was later renamed after its episcopal see, Benghazi.

<text>The ashy drongo (Dicrurus leucophaeus) is a species of bird in the drongo family Dicruridae. It is found widely distributed across eastern and Southeast Asia, with several populations that vary in the shade of grey, migration patterns and in the size or presence of white patches around the eye.

==Description==
The adult ashy drongo is mainly dark grey, and the tail is long and deeply forked, There are a number of subspecies varying in the shade of the grey plumage. Some subspecies have white markings on the head. Young birds are dull brownish grey.

Subspecies &quot;longicaudatus&quot; of India (which includes &quot;beavani&quot; of the Himalayas that winters on the peninsula, with one breeding population in central India that Vaurie separates as &quot;longicaudatus&quot; in the restricted sense) is very dark and almost like the black drongo although this bird is slimmer and has a somewhat longer and less-splayed tail. It is found in more tall forest habitat, has dark grey underside lacking the sheen of black drongo. The iris is crimson and there is no white rictal spot. Subspecies &quot;leucogenis&quot; and &quot;salangensis&quot; have a white eye-patch as do several of the island forms that breed further south. The calls are a little more nasal and twangy than that of the black drongo.

==Distribution==
The ashy drongo breeds in the hills of tropical southern Asia from eastern Afghanistan east to southern China, Ryukyu Islands in southern Japan (particularly Okinawa) and Indonesia. Many populations in the northern part of its range are migratory. Charles Vaurie described subspecies &quot;beavani&quot; (after Robert Cecil Beavan) as the population that breeds along the Himalayas that wintered in peninsular India. However, later workers include this as part of &quot;longicaudatus&quot; which also has a population that breeds in central India. In winter, the species is particularly fond of hill forests. E. C. Stuart Baker described &quot;stevensi&quot; which Vaurie considered as being either &quot;beavani&quot; or &quot;hopwoodi&quot; of the eastern Himalayas. To the east of the range of &quot;hopwoodi&quot; is &quot;mouhouti&quot; of Thailand and Myanmar. To the north of this range are &quot;leucogenis&quot; and &quot;salangensis&quot; (both migratory mainly to areas further south but also known from Nagaland) while &quot;bondi&quot; is found to the south. Along the southeast Asian island chain, there are number of insular populations including &quot;periophthalmus&quot;, &quot;ryukyuensis&quot;, &quot;batakensis&quot;, &quot;phaedrus&quot;, &quot;siberu&quot; and &quot;nigrescens&quot;. The nominate form is said to be found on Simalur, Java, Bali, Lombok, Palawan, and Balabac Islands.

==Behaviour and ecology==

The ashy drongo has short legs and sits very upright while perched prominently, often high on a tree. It is insectivorous and forages by making aerial sallies but sometimes gleans from tree trunks. They are found singly, in pairs or small groups. During migration they fly in small flocks.

A common call that they make is described as &quot;drangh gip&quot; or &quot;gip-gip-drangh&quot;. They can imitate the calls of other birds and are capable of imitating the whistling notes of a common iora.

The breeding season is May to June with a clutch of three or four reddish or brown eggs laid in a loose cup nest in a tree.

<text>A writer&#x27;s block is a non-medical condition, primarily associated with writing, in which an author is either unable to produce new work or experiences a creative slowdown.

Writer&#x27;s block has various degrees of severity, from difficulty in coming up with original ideas to being unable to produce work for years. This condition is not solely measured by time passing without writing, it is measured by time passing without productivity in the task at hand. Writer&#x27;s block has been an acknowledged problem throughout recorded history.

However, not until 1947 was the term coined by the Austrian psychiatrist Edmund Bergler. All types of writers, including full-time professionals, academics, workers of creative projects, and those trying to finish written assignments, can experience writer&#x27;s block. The condition has many causes, some that are even unrelated to writing. The majority of writer&#x27;s block researchers agree that most causes of writer&#x27;s block have an affective/physiological, motivational, and cognitive component.

Studies have found effective coping strategies to deal with writer&#x27;s block. These strategies aim to remove the anxiety about writing and range from ideas such as free writing and brainstorming to talking to a professional.

==History==

The affliction now known as writer&#x27;s block has been recognized throughout history. Writers who are known to have struggled with it include authors F. Scott Fitzgerald and Joseph Mitchell, composer Sergei Rachmaninoff, and songwriter Adele. Another example is Herman Melville, who stopped writing novels a few years after writing &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;.

Early Romantic writers tended to attribute writer&#x27;s block (whether seriously or merely poetically) to a power that no longer wanted them to write. Its interpretation became less mystical during the time of the French Symbolists, which had renowned poets such as Arthur Rimbaud (who, after producing the bulk of his literary output during his late teenage years, completely stopped writing at the age of twenty) give up writing early into their careers on the ground that they were unable to find the language to convey their messages. During the Great American Novel period (mid-18th to mid-19th century), the affliction was construed as something that stopped writers and caused them emotional instability.

The condition was first clinically described in 1947 by Austrian psychoanalyst Edmund Bergler, who identified it as being caused by oral masochism, mothers that bottle fed, and an unstable private love life. The growing reputation of psychiatry in the United States made the term gain more recognition. Research concerning this topic was done in the late 1970s and 1980s. During this time, researchers were influenced by the Process and Post-Process movements and therefore focused specifically on the writer&#x27;s processes.

==Causes==
Writer&#x27;s block may have several causes. Some are creative problems that originate within an author&#x27;s work itself. A writer may run out of inspiration, or be distracted by other events. The writer Elizabeth Gilbert, reflecting on her post-bestseller prospects, proposed that such a pressure might be released by interpreting creative writers as &quot;having&quot; genius rather than &quot;being&quot; a genius.

A fictional example can be found in George Orwell&#x27;s novel &quot;Keep the Aspidistra Flying&quot;, in which the protagonist Gordon Comstock struggles in vain to complete an epic poem describing a day in London: &quot;It was too big for him, that was the truth. It had never really progressed, it had simply fallen apart into a series of fragments.&quot;

===Physiological and neurological basis===
Physiological and neurological bases of writer&#x27;s block have been suggested. Under stress, a human brain will &quot;shift control from the cerebral cortex to the limbic system&quot;. The limbic system is associated with the instinctual processes, such as &quot;fight or flight&quot; response; and behavior that is based on &quot;deeply engrained training&quot;. The limited input from the cerebral cortex hinders a person&#x27;s creative processes, which is replaced by the behaviors associated with the limbic system. The person is often unaware of the change, which may lead them to believe they are creatively &quot;blocked&quot;. 

In her 2004 book &quot;The Midnight Disease: The Drive to Write, Writer&#x27;s Block, and the Creative Brain&quot;, the writer and neurologist Alice W. Flaherty has argued that literary creativity is a function of specific areas of the brain, and that block may be the result of brain activity being disrupted in those areas. Flaherty suggested in her writing that there are many diseases that may impact one&#x27;s ability to write. One of which she refers to is hypergraphia, or the intensive desire to write. She points out that in this condition, the patient&#x27;s temporal lobe is afflicted, usually by damage, and it may be the same changes in this area of the brain that can contribute to writer&#x27;s-blocking behaviors. Not to be confused with writer&#x27;s block, agraphia is a neurological disorder caused by trauma or stroke causing difficulty in communicating through writing. Agraphia cannot be treated directly, but it is possible to relearn certain writing abilities.

===Brain trauma===
Other research identifies neurological malfunctions as a cause. Malcolm T. Cunningham showed how these malfunctions can be linked to trauma both mental and physical.

Physical damage can produce writer&#x27;s block. If a person experiences tissue damage in the brain, i.e. a stroke, it is likely to lead to other complications apart from the lesion itself. This damage causes an extreme form of writer&#x27;s block known as agraphia. With agraphia, the inability to write is due to issues with the cerebral cortex; this disables the brain&#x27;s process of translating thoughts into writing. Brain injuries are an example of a physical illness that can cause a writer to be blocked. Other brain-related disorders and neurological disorders such as epilepsy have been known to cause the problem of writer&#x27;s block and hypergraphia, the strong urge to write.

===Writer anxiety and inhibition===
Another cause of writer&#x27;s block has been due to writer&#x27;s anxiety. Writer&#x27;s anxiety is defined as being worried about one&#x27;s words or thought, thus experiencing writer&#x27;s block.

From a composition perspective, Lawrence Oliver said in his article &quot;Helping Students Overcome Writer&#x27;s Block&quot;: &quot;Students receive little or no advice on how to generate ideas or explore their thoughts, and they usually must proceed through the writing process without guidance or corrective feedback from the teacher, who withholds comments and criticism until grading the final product.&quot; He said that students &quot;learn to write by writing&quot;, and often they are insecure or paralyzed by rules.

Phyllis Koestenbaum wrote in her article &quot;The Secret Climate the Year I Stopped Writing&quot; about her trepidation toward writing, claiming it was tied directly to her instructor&#x27;s response. She said, &quot;I needed to write to feel, but without feeling I couldn&#x27;t write.&quot; In contrast to Koestenbaum&#x27;s experience, Nancy Sommers stated that papers do not end when students finish writing and that neither should instructors&#x27; comments. She urges a &quot;partnership&quot; between writers and instructors so that responses become a conversation.

===Student motivation===
Herman A. Estrin in his article &quot;Motivation in Composition Writing&quot; writes: &quot;When freshmen are assigned such topics for a research paper as ... they have no real background of the subject for an in-depth paper ... they prepare a mechanical, lifeless paper with no creativity, imagination, or originality&quot;. According to him, freshman students write well about topics they are passionate about. Moore, Marshall in his article “Articulate Walls: Writer’s Block and the Academic Creative.” thinks similarly by writing: &quot;...his or her practice is paralysingly out of sync with the syllabus; and teaching from a state of creative depletion may engender a cascade of self-doubt. This paper will look at the process by which these practitioners attempt to navigate this zone of creative disconnect.&quot;. Saying having assigned, planned out, and required papers is contributing to loss of motivation.

Aline Alves-Wold, in her article &quot;Assessing Writing Motivation: a Systematic Review of K-5 Students&#x27; Self-Reports&quot; states that there is a general lack of research on the motivation of students to write in the first few years of education, which is problematic when one considers how important initial experiences are in motivating students to write. Success generally enhances one&#x27;s belief in their efficacy, whereas failure weakens them. &quot;These mechanisms are particularly evident in early phases of skill development where failure typically occurs before a sense of efficacy has been firmly established. This implies that children in their first years in school have writer self-beliefs that are particularly malleable and dynamic&quot;. Writing development is therefore both enhanced and endangered during the first years in school.

===Negative self-beliefs and feeling of incompetence===
Mike Rose stated that writer&#x27;s block can be caused by a writer&#x27;s history in writing, rules and restrictions from the past. Writers can be hesitant of what they write based on how it will be perceived by the audience. Guangming Ling states that there is a negative correlation between self-efficacy and avoidance goals in studies on writing apprehension and writer&#x27;s block, which suggests that having hesitations about writing may lead to less effort and thus less success.

Similarly to Ling, Dana Driscoll and Jennifer Wells explain writing dispositions in their essay &quot;Beyond Knowledge and Skills&quot;. Driscoll and Wells argue that dispositions toward writing play crucial roles in determining whether writers are able to transfer their knowledge of writing into other contexts of life. Related to self-efficacy, Driscoll and Wells suggest that writers who have a positive self-belief are more likely to produce work than some with a negative self-belief. Self-efficacy is especially important for a writer when it comes to an unfamiliar learning or writing setting because it may seem overwhelming.

James Adams noted in his book &quot;Conceptual Blockbusting&quot; that various reasons blocks occur include fear of taking a risk, &quot;chaos&quot; in the pre-writing stage, judging versus generating ideas, an inability to incubate ideas, or a lack of motivation.

In &quot;Motivation in the Writing Centre: A Peer Tutor&#x27;s Experience&quot;, Leonie Kirchoff states that &quot;The concept of &#x27;amotivation&#x27; describes a lack of motivation due to an individual&#x27;s feeling of incompetence and helplessness.&quot; Demotivation is the process of reducing or diminishing motivational basis for behavior or ongoing actions through external influences. An external factor such as feedback may affect demotivation, whereas an internal factor, such as pessimistic expectations, may cause amotivation. Even so, both concepts have similar effects on writers.

For tutors to provide students with the most appropriate feedback, scholars like Jared Featherstone from James Madison University suggest that tutors should be well educated in mindfulness strategies to combat a student&#x27;s fixed mindset. He argues that tutors or instructors should be mindful enough to be grounded and focused solely on their student so they can pick up on the feelings, stress, or fixed mindsets their student might have. An unmindful tutor might accidentally reinforce a student&#x27;s negative thinking patterns.

==Coping strategies==
Irene Clark describes the following strategies for coping with writer&#x27;s block: class and group discussion, journaling, free writing and brainstorming, clustering, list making, and engaging with the text. To overcome writing blocks, Oliver suggests asking writers questions to uncover their writing process. He then recommends solutions such as systematic questioning, free writing, and encouragement. A recent study of 2,500 writers aimed to find techniques that writers themselves use to overcome writer&#x27;s block. The research discovered a range of solutions from altering the time of day to write and setting deadlines to lowering expectations and using mindfulness meditation.

Mindfulness meditation has proved to increase awareness and improve writing skills. Kate Chaterdon, an English professor at Marist College, suggests mindfulness not only improves writing skills but also allows writers to transfer their knowledge of writing into other contexts of life. Chaterdon recommends meditation as a grounding exercise to help people becoming more metacognitavely aware. Chaterdon had conducted a study in her two writing classes at Marist College and concluded that practicing mindfulness at least once a week is essential in developing higher levels of metacognition.

===Right-brain involvement===

Garbriele Lusser Rico&#x27;s concern with the mind links to brain lateralisation, also explored by Rose and Linda Flowers and John R. Hayes, among others. Rico&#x27;s book &quot;Writing the Natural Way&quot; looks into invention strategies, such as clustering, which has been noted to be an invention strategy used to help writers overcome their blocks, and further emphasizes the solutions presented in works by Rose, Oliver, and Clark. Similar to Rico, James Adams discusses &quot;right-brain&quot; involvement in writing. While Bill Downey proposes that he is basing his approach in practical concerns, his concentration on &quot;right-brain&quot; techniques speaks to cognitive theory approach similar to Rico&#x27;s and a more practical advice for writers to approach their writer&#x27;s block. Mike Rose mentions that peer tutors provide supportive feedback so that blocked writers can feel secure in sharing their problems and experimenting with new ideas about writing.

===Writing environment===
It is also important to evaluate the environment in which the writing is being produced to determine what is the best condition to work in. One must look into these different factors to determine whether it is a good or bad environment to work in. Psychologists who have studied writer&#x27;s block have concluded that it is a treatable condition once the writer finds a way to remove anxiety and build confidence in themselves. Sarah Ahmed and Dominik Güss state that solutions for coping with writer&#x27;s block include using more efficient writing strategies during the composing process, more effective goal-setting strategies, and even brainstorming ideas with others.

===Splitting the writing into smaller pieces===
Research has also shown that it is highly effective if one breaks their work into pieces rather than doing all of their writing in one sitting, in order to produce good quality work. While it can be helpful to split up the writing process into pieces, Patricia Huston suggests that starting with different sections of a paper, rather than trying to start with an introduction, can be a useful strategy to cope with writer&#x27;s block. She points out that if a person is stuck on the introduction, they can try moving onto a different section like a body paragraph. Huston states: &quot;There is no need to begin at the beginning and write an article in sequence&quot;.

===Free writing and brainstorming===

Free writing is a widely accepted technique for overcoming writer&#x27;s block. Taught by Peter Elbow, free writing is similar to brainstorming but is written in prose form without stopping. To free-write, one writes without pausing to think or edit, and one pours raw ideas onto paper. Author Benjamin Solomon described the rationale for the technique: &quot;Writer&#x27;s block is a rut, a ditch, a trap, a swampy mire, and in order to lift yourself out, you need to &quot;do&quot; something—anything!—to jog yourself into motion.&quot; Cherryl Armstrong, who worked with the South Coast Writing Project, stated that one can free-write about anything, even a completely different subject than one was going to write about: &quot;any writing will do&quot;. Oliver claims that after free writing the writer is able to analyze many ideas that might not have been generated before and develop a clearer sense of what theme is trying to be communicated throughout the writing. Lawrence J. Oliver suggests that effective method that has helped people deal with writer&#x27;s block. This method consists of writing down ideas or thoughts about a certain topic. Freewriting doesn&#x27;t focus on grammar or style. There is only one rule for this method, and that is to keep on writing. Educators should also never read students&#x27; freewriting unless asked to do so.

===Mind mapping===

Mind mapping is suggested as another potential solution to writer&#x27;s block. The technique involves writing a stream of consciousness on a horizontal piece of paper and connecting any similar or linked thoughts. This exercise is intended to help a writer suffering from writer&#x27;s block to bypass the analytical or critical functioning of their brain and access the creative functioning more directly, stimulating the flow of ideas. Other techniques similar to clustering and mind mapping are the writing of notes on cards in a card file, and nonlinear electronic writing using hypertext.

===Positive self-beliefs and encouragement===
Camacho, Alves and Boscolo wrote about enhancing students&#x27; writing motivation in the classroom. They say that to foster students&#x27; positive self-beliefs and beliefs about writing, teachers must nurture their self-beliefs, as well as their beliefs about the writing task.

===Other techniques===
Other ways to cope come from ideas such as The Brand Emotions Scale for Writers (BESW). Using the framework of the Differential Emotions Scale, the BESW works with grouping emotions into either states or traits and then classifying them as positive, negative passive, or negative active. Researchers can assess subjects, giving writers a chance to get more work done if left in the right emotional state, since data suggests that writers with positive emotions tended to express more than writers with negative passive or negative active. Scholars and researchers such as Mandy Bamber suggest practicing meditation to reduce negative moods like stress and anxiety. Bamber&#x27;s team conducted a study on 40 university students who showed signs of anxiety. After practicing mindfulness and mediation exercises, 33 out of the 40 showed significant decreases in stress and anxiety levels.

Anne Johnstone suggests a couple of strategies to help with writer&#x27;s block. When one finds oneself unable to generate content, Johnstone suggests &quot;recopying a well-liked piece&quot; of one&#x27;s own to help generate ideas. Johnstone states that individuals who are articulate orally but struggle with writing and forming their ideas into sentences on paper should try tape-recording themselves and later transcribing it onto paper.

== Relation to procrastination ==

Writer&#x27;s block and procrastination are two similar issues that people struggle with when it comes to writing. Writer&#x27;s block is an issue that can cause people to delay their goals and may prevent them from finishing writing projects. Although writer&#x27;s block and procrastination are not the exact same issue, they can end up leading up to one another. Writer&#x27;s block is not continuing to do a task, and procrastination is delaying to start the task. In her 1987 Ph.D. thesis (published in 2012), Karen E. Peterson posited two different scenarios on how procrastination and writer&#x27;s block can lead up to each other. One scenario is that a person will procrastinate due to having the fear of past experiences of getting writer&#x27;s block when doing a task. The other scenario is that a person will have writer&#x27;s block because of the feeling of being overwhelmed about needing to do a task at the last minute after procrastinating for a long period of time. 

According to some scholars like Claire Kervin, procrastination is usually a result of a negative mood and is a &quot;short-term mood regulator&quot;. Unlike previous beliefs that procrastination is poor time management, Kervin suggests procrastination is a way individuals cope with negative emotions. Kervin&#x27;s suggestion makes a connection to one of Peterson&#x27;s scenarios, specifically when someone procrastinates due to fear of past experiences and begins to feel judgmental toward themselves. Kervin recommends taking a mindful approach to combating procrastination in order to become more grounded and improve self-regulation.

<text>Webster University is a private university with its main campus in Webster Groves, Missouri. It has multiple branch locations across the United States and countries across Europe, Asia, and Africa. The university has an alumni network of around 170,000 graduates worldwide.

==History==
The college was founded in 1915 by the Sisters of Loretto as Loretto College, a Catholic women&#x27;s college, one of the first west of the Mississippi River. One of the early founders was Mother Praxedes Carty. Its name was changed to Webster College in 1924. The first male students were admitted in 1962. The sisters transferred ownership of the college to a lay Board of Directors in 1967; it was the first Catholic college in the United States to be totally under lay control. In 1983, Webster College&#x27;s name was changed to Webster University.

Webster was involved in the early racial integration battles in St. Louis. During the early 1940s, many local priests, especially the Jesuits, challenged the segregationist policies at the city&#x27;s Catholic colleges and parochial schools. The St. Louis chapter of the Midwest Clergy Conference on Negro Welfare arranged in 1943 for Webster College to admit a black female student, Mary Aloyse Foster, which would make it the city&#x27;s first Catholic college to integrate. However, in 1943 Archbishop John J. Glennon blocked that student&#x27;s enrollment by speaking privately with the Kentucky-based Superior General of the Sisters of Loretto. The &quot;Pittsburgh Courier&quot;, an African-American newspaper with national circulation, discovered Glennon&#x27;s actions and ran a front-page feature on the Webster incident in February 1944. The negative publicity toward Glennon&#x27;s segregationist policies led Saint Louis University to begin admitting African American students in summer 1944. In the fall of 1945, Webster College responded to pressure by admitting Irene Thomas, a Catholic African-American woman from St. Louis, as a music major.

In the 1960s, the school dropped its Catholic affiliation following the issuance of the Land O&#x27;Lakes Statement. The school&#x27;s then-president, Sr Jacqueline Grennan, renounced her religious vows and continued as head of what had effectively become a secular institution.

==Academics==

Colleges include:
* College of Humanities &amp; Social Sciences
* College of Health and Science
* Leigh Gerdine College of Fine Arts
* George Herbert Walker School of Business &amp; Technology
* School of Communications
* School of Education.

Webster University is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. Specific programs are accredited by specialized accreditors, including the Association of Collegiate Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP), the National Association of Schools of Music (NASM), the National League for Nursing (NLN), the Council on Accreditation (COA), the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE), the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, and the National Board for Certified Counselors.

In 2023, Webster University was ranked 22nd among regional universities (Midwest) by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

=== Partnerships ===
Webster University maintains a Confucius Institute in partnership with Beijing Language and Culture University. In 2019, US senator Josh Hawley asked Webster University to close its Confucius Institute.

==Campus==

Webster University&#x27;s home campus is located in Webster Groves, a suburb of St. Louis. Many of the domestic campuses are located near military bases; some are located in various metropolitan areas. The international campuses are located in several European countries including Switzerland, Austria, Georgia, and The Netherlands; several are also located in Asia, such as in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, Thailand, and China.

In addition to its own international campuses, Webster has also formed partnerships with a few universities that are based in their countries of interest. For example, The Webster Graduate School was until 2015 tied with Regent&#x27;s University London; and Webster maintains a relationship with Kansai University in Osaka, Japan and with The Universidad Autónoma de Guadalajara in Guadalajara, Mexico. Recently, Webster started a study abroad program in Greece.

In 2015, Webster released a report on its Thailand campus citing several issues, including badly inadequate facilities and a culture of distrust between students and the administration. The report also cited several strengths on the campus, including strong academics and financial stability, saying &quot;recruitment, marketing and admissions&quot; are an area of strength for the campus. One month after the internal report was issued, a campus ombudsman was appointed to address the communications issues and to bring the Thailand campus more in-line with the home campus&#x27; policies.

==Athletics==
Webster University&#x27;s athletic mascot is the Gorlok, named in honor of the school&#x27;s location at the corner of Gore and Lockwood Avenues in Webster Groves. Athletic teams participate in the NCAA Division III and in the St. Louis Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SLIAC).

* Men&#x27;s sports: baseball; basketball; cross country; golf; soccer; tennis; and, track and field
* Women&#x27;s sports: basketball; cross country; soccer; softball; tennis; track and field; and, volleyball
Webster&#x27;s Baseball Team has made back to back trips to the Division III World Series placing fifth in both 2012 and 2013. They also made the Division III World Series in 2015. They made it to the regional Division III championship in 2014 but were defeated in the first round. Major League pitcher Josh Fleming played for Webster.

Webster&#x27;s chess team has won more national titles than any college team in the country and has been ranked #1 continuously since 2012.

==Student life==
Webster University, in Fall 2014, enrolled 5,010 undergraduate students and 17,190 graduate students. The average SAT composite score for the undergraduate class was 1,194. The average ACT composite score was 24. Students come from 49 states and more than 122 countries.

Webster University St. Louis has a student newspaper called &quot;The Journal&quot; and a student radio station called The Galaxy. The Galaxy was re-launched online in 2007. Webster University has other e-newsletters such as Webster Today and departmental publications.

Webster University recently allowed the formation of the first Greek organization on its St. Louis campus, with the founding of the 152nd Chapter of Delta Upsilon and the founding of the Gamma Zeta chapter of Delta Phi Epsilon.

<doc id="664820" wikidata="Q334027" url="?curid=664820" title="Charles Russell, Baron Russell of Killowen">
<text>Charles Arthur Russell, Baron Russell of Killowen, (10 November 1832 – 10 August 1900) was an Irish statesman of the 19th century, and Lord Chief Justice of England. He was the first Roman Catholic to serve as Lord Chief Justice since the Reformation.

==Early life==
Russell was born at 50 Queen Street (now Dominic Street) in Newry, County Down, the elder son of Arthur Russell (d.1845) of Killowen, County Down, a brewer, of Newry and Seafield House, Killowen, County Down, by his wife Margaret Mullin of Belfast. The family was in moderate circumstances. Charles was one of five children: his three sisters all became nuns and his brother Matthew Russell was ordained as a Jesuit priest.

Although Russell believed himself to be of Irish origin, he was later granted for his coat of arms a differenced version of the arms of the Russell Dukes of Bedford, which family originated in Dorset, England, in the 16th century. No relationship between the two families is apparent. Arthur Russell having died in 1845, the care of his large family devolved upon their talented mother and their paternal uncle, Charles William Russell.

He studied at the diocesan seminary, St Malachy&#x27;s College, Belfast, at a private school in Newry, and Castleknock College, in Castleknock, Dublin. He then entered the law offices of Messrs Denvir, Newry, in 1849, and of O&#x27;Rourke, McDonald &amp; Tweed, Belfast, in 1852. Admitted a solicitor in 1854, he practised in the county courts of Down and Antrim, and became at once the champion of the Catholics who had resisted organised attempts at proselytising by Protestants in these counties. He matriculated at Trinity College, Dublin in 1856, but never graduated.

==Lawyer==
Friends urged Russell to become a barrister in London, and in 1856 he entered Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. After study under Maine, Broom, and Birkbeck, he was called to the Bar in 1859. His success on the northern circuit soon recalled him to London, where he took silk in 1872, and divided the mercantile business of the circuit with Lord Herschell. His fees averaged £3,000 a year from 1862 to 1872, £10,000 in the next decade, £16,000 in the third, and in 1893–1894, his last year of practice (while Attorney-General), reached £32,826. He was regarded as the leading advocate of his time. He was a strong supporter of Florence Maybrick, whom he believed to have been wrongly convicted.

==Home Rule advocate==

In his first years in London he had been weekly correspondent of the Dublin paper &quot;The Nation&quot;, an advanced Nationalist organ, and entered Parliament as a Liberal being elected, after two defeats, member for Dundalk in 1880. He generally acted with the Nationalists on Irish, and always on Catholic, questions, and, when he visited the United States of America in 1883, bore a flattering introduction from Charles Stewart Parnell. Elected member of parliament for Hackney South (1885–1894), he was knighted and appointed Attorney General by Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone in 1886, and again became Attorney General in 1892 on the return of the Liberals to power. He was a strenuous advocate of Irish Home Rule in Parliament and on public platforms, and was leading advocate for Parnell at the Parnell Commission hearings in 1888–89. His cross-examination of the witnesses of the &quot;Times&quot;, and especially his exposure of Richard Pigott, the author of the forgeries, made a favourable verdict inevitable. His famous eight-day speech for the defence was his greatest forensic effort.

==International arbitrations==
In 1893 he represented Britain in the Bering Sea Arbitration, his speech against the United States&#x27; contentions lasting eleven days, and was appointed to the Order of St Michael and St George as a Knight Grand Cross (GCMG) &quot;in recognition of services rendered in connection with the recent Behring Sea Arbitration&quot; that year.

== Judicial career ==
Having been sworn of the Privy Council in April 1894, he was made a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary in May and was raised to the peerage for life as Baron Russell of Killowen, of Killowen in the County of Down, from his native village of Killowen. In July that year, he was appointed to be the Lord Chief Justice of England, the first Catholic to attain that office for centuries. He won speedily the public confidence and is ranked with the most illustrious of his predecessors. Lord Russell of Killowen revisited the United States in 1896 as the guest of the American Bar Association and delivered a notable address on arbitration. In 1899 he represented Britain during the Venezuelan boundary dispute arbitration hearings which followed from the Venezuela Crisis of 1895, and displayed all his old power of separating vital points from obscuring details. The following year he was attacked while on circuit by an internal malady, and, after a few weeks&#x27; illness, died in London, after receiving the sacraments of the Catholic Church, of which he had been always a faithful and devoted member. His place of burial is a small enclosed family cemetery within Epsom Cemetery.
==Family==
He was married in 1858 to Ellen Mulholland, daughter of Dr. Mulholland, of Belfast, who succeeded him. They had five sons and four daughters, including:
*Arthur Joseph Russell (1862-1907), married his cousin Mary Florence Cumming, without issue.
*Sir Charles Russell, 1st Baronet, KCVO (1863–1928) (created a Baronet in 1916)
*Eileen Mary Russell (b.1865), married Douglas Lyon Holms
*Cyril Russell (b.1866), whose son Alec Charles Russell (1894–1938) inherited his uncle&#x27;s baronetcy, by special remainder.
*Francis Xavier Joseph Russell (1867–1946), who would in 1929 be created Baron Russell of Killowen
*Mary Gertrude Russell (b. 1874), a nun
*Lieutenant-Colonel Bertrand Joseph Russell (b. 1876), Royal Horse Artillery
*Lilian Russell (b. 1878), married Henry Olpherts Drummond
*Margaret Russell (b. 1879)

His third son Francis Xavier Joseph &quot;Frank&quot; Russell and Frank&#x27;s son Charles Ritchie Russell, were also prominent jurists ultimately appointed Lords of Appeal in Ordinary (in 1929 and 1975, respectively). Both took the title &quot;Baron Russell of Killowen&quot; on appointment, the same title as Charles Russell.

==Recognition==
The unanimous tribute paid him by the English and American Bar and by the people and journals of the most diverse political and religious views attested that, despite his masterful character as lawyer, judge, and parliamentarian, and his stalwart loyalty to his faith and country, he had attained a rare and widespread popularity. In him were blended many qualities not usually found together. With a keen and orderly mind, a resolute will, great capacity for work, and severe official dignity, he combined sensibility of temperament, a spirit of helpfulness and comradeship, and a dreamer&#x27;s devotion to ideals. He was always ready to write and speak for educational, religious, and benevolent purposes, though such action was not calculated to forward his political ambitions. Devoted to his family, he crossed the continent on his first American trip to visit Mother Mary Baptist Russell of San Francisco (who, with two others of his sisters, had entered the Order of Mercy), and found time to write for his children and send them day by day an admirable account of his experiences. In 1907 Bishop&#x27;s Road in South Hackney was renamed Killowen Road in recognition of his work as the local M.P.

<text>The white-bellied drongo (Dicrurus caerulescens) is a species of drongo found across the Indian Subcontinent. Like other members of the family Dicruridae, they are insectivorous and mainly black in colour, but with a white belly and vent. Young birds are, however, all black and may be confused with the black drongo, which is smaller and more compact in appearance. The subspecies found in Sri Lanka has white restricted to the vent.

==Taxonomy==
In 1747 the English naturalist George Edwards included an illustration and a description of the white-bellied drongo in the second volume of his &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot;. He used the English name &quot;The Fork- tail&#x27;d Indian Butcher-Bird&quot;. Edwards based his hand-coloured etching on a specimen that had been sent from Bengal to the silk-pattern designer Joseph Dandridge in London. When in 1758 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the tenth edition, he placed the white-bellied drongo with the shrikes in the genus &quot;Lanius&quot;. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Lanius caerulescens&quot; and cited Edwards&#x27; work. The specific epithet &quot;caerulescens&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;bluish&quot;. The white-bellied drongo is now placed with the other drongos in the genus &quot;Dicrurus&quot; that was introduced in 1816 by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot.

Three subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;D. c. caerulescens&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – south Nepal to west, south India
* &quot;D. c. insularis&quot; (Sharpe, 1877) – north Sri Lanka
* &quot;D. c. leucopygialis&quot; Blyth, 1846 – south Sri Lanka

==Description==
This drongo is black without any glossy feathers on the upperside and greyish on the throat and breast, while the belly and vent are entirely white in the Indian form which is the nominate subspecies. The fork of the tail is less deep than in the black drongo which is often seen in the same habitats. Young black drongo&#x27;s can have a lot of white on the underside but it is usually scaly in appearance. The Sri Lankan forms &quot;insularis&quot; of the northern dry zone and &quot;leucopygialis&quot; of the southern wet zone have the white restricted to the vent. Birds that are less than a year old lack the white on the underside but are browner above and greyish below. Males have a very slightly shorter tail on average than females.

The size of the birds varies clinally with northern birds larger. The extent of white on the underside also declines with size although there is a lot of local variation. The Sri Lankan forms &quot;leucopygialis&quot; and &quot;insularis&quot; are darker than the Indian form and there is some intergradation within the Sri Lankan forms.
The species is believed to be closely related to &quot;Dicrurus leucophaeus&quot; but has not be confirmed with molecular sequence studies.

Both the white-bellied drongo and the black drongo share a diploid chromosome number of 68.

==Distribution and habitat==
The white-bellied drongo is a resident breeder in India and Sri Lanka. This species is usually found in dry scrub or open forests. The distribution is restricted to peninsular India south of the Himalayas and to the west of the Gangetic delta bounded on the west by the Aravallis.

==Behaviour and ecology==

Birds are often seen singly or in groups of up to three individuals, sometimes joining mixed-species foraging flocks. They perch upright close to the tops of trees and capture insects in the air with short aerobatic sallies. Larger insects may be captured using their claws. The song of this drongo is a series of staccato notes interspersed with clear notes and may include mimicry of other bird calls.

The breeding season is from February to July. The cup nest is similar to that of the black drongo but is usually made up of more twigs and is well lined with grass. Two to four eggs, pale salmon coloured with reddish blotches on the broad end, are laid in the nest which may be 20 to 30 feet high in the fork of a tree. These are aggressive at the nest and will attack potential threats much larger than themselves. When mobbing they have been observed to imitate the alarm calls of squirrels or the mewing of a cat and is known to join to mixed-species foraging flocks.

Although primarily insectivorous they are opportunistic and are known to prey on small birds. Like other drongos, they use their feet while handling their prey. They have been known to take insects attracted to artificial lights late at dusk. They also visit large flowers for nectar, particularly &quot;Bombax&quot;, &quot;Erythrina&quot; and may pollinate species such as &quot;Helicteres isora&quot;. The bird louse &quot;Philopterus kalkalichi&quot; whose type host is the black drongo has also been found on white-bellied drongos.

<text>Cryptic Studios is an American video game developer specializing in massively multiplayer online role-playing games. It is headquartered in Los Gatos, California, and was a wholly owned Perfect World subsidiary, and is now owned by Embracer Group.

==History==

Established in June 2000, Michael Lewis and Rick Dakan conceived the idea for Cryptic Studios. &quot;Rick and I wanted to do an online role-playing game,&quot; Lewis told the &quot;Los Gatos Weekly Times&quot; in January 2007. &quot;We&#x27;d been role-playing gamers growing up, and thought that online would be a great way to continue that experience, while overcoming the distances involved. We decided that there were too many fantasy games in development—this was 1999, so we discussed many alternatives. Superheroes quickly rose to the top of the list. It is something people could understand and identify with quickly, versus ideas like science fiction or horror, because it provides an infinite background on which to create adventures of all kinds. And who doesn&#x27;t want to have super powers?&quot;

At a New Year&#x27;s party in 1999, Lewis and Dakan met Bruce Rogers, Matt Harvey and Cameron Petty, veterans of Atari Games, who had begun trying to found a computer game company but lacked funding. In 2000, Lewis sold his company, Stellar Semiconductor, Inc., to Broadcom Corporation. With Lewis&#x27; funding and Rogers&#x27; expertise, the group formed Cryptic Studios. Role-playing game writer Jack Emmert joined the team to work on game design. In March 2007, Cryptic Studios moved to a larger corporate headquarters in Los Gatos, California. Plans for the new headquarters include adding a state-of-the-art sound studio to be built by the Walters-Storyk Design Group. At that time the company also adopted a new corporate logo. 

On December 9, 2008, Atari, SA announced that it had acquired Cryptic Studios. In March 2010, Bill Roper was promoted to Chief Creative Officer, succeeding Emmert (who became the Chief Operations Officer), but left the studio in August that same year. In March 2011, Jack Emmert was promoted to chief executive officer when John Needham left to pursue other opportunities in the gaming industry. On May 17, 2011, Atari announced the divesting of its interest in Cryptic Studios. On May 31, 2011, it was announced that Perfect World had acquired Cryptic Studios. On April 25, 2012, Cryptic Studios announced that the security of one of its user databases was compromised as far back as December 2010. In June 2017, the company was announced to be creating a &quot;&quot; game for consoles and PC.

In December 2021, Swedish holding company Embracer Group announced that it would acquire the North American and publishing arms of Perfect World Entertainment from Perfect World Europe through its Gearbox Software subsidiary. Following the acquisition, Perfect World Entertainment was dissolved into Gearbox Publishing. Cryptic will continue operations as a subsidiary of The Gearbox Entertainment Company. Cryptic Studios now has over 100 employees.

In November 2023, restructuring efforts at Embracer Group led to layoffs at Cryptic Studios and Embracer announced that the studio will now be operating under DECA Games going forward. In March 2024, it was announced that DECA Games would be taking over direct development of Cryptic&#x27;s current titles, with Cryptic transitioning into a support role. In March 2024, Embracer sold Gearbox to an external investor but announced it would retain several related studios, including Cryptic Studios.

==Products==

===&quot;City of Heroes&quot;/&quot;Villains&quot;===

In early 2002, Cryptic signed a publishing agreement for &quot;City of Heroes&quot; with NCSoft, which wanted to expand into the United States gaming market. Cryptic Studios&#x27; first MMORPG, &quot;City of Heroes&quot;, was launched on April 28, 2004. On October 31, 2005, it launched &quot;City of Villains&quot;, a separate game that was linked with &quot;City of Heroes&quot; through player versus player combat zones. , Cryptic Studios had released ten free expansions for &quot;City of Heroes&quot; and &quot;City of Villains&quot;. On November 6, 2007, Cryptic announced that it had sold the &quot;City of Heroes&quot;/&quot;City of Villains&quot; intellectual property to NCSoft. All of the &quot;City of Heroes&quot;/&quot;City of Villains&quot; development team transitioned to work under NCSoft under the working title NCNorCal (NCNC), which later became the NCSoft-owned subsidiary, Paragon Studios, which ceased operation when NCSoft closed the game on August 31, 2012.

===&quot;Champions Online&quot;===
On September 27, 2006, Marvel Entertainment and Cryptic announced that Cryptic Studios was developing &quot;Marvel Universe Online&quot;, the Marvel universe MMO video game to be published by Microsoft Game Studios for exclusive release to Windows Vista (and Xbox 360, which was later cancelled in March 2010). On February 7, 2008, Shane Kim of Microsoft Game Studios reported that MUO was canceled. Cryptic Studios said development would continue using a new IP license of The Champions and became &quot;Champions Online&quot;. Cryptic Studios released &quot;Champions Online&quot;, loosely based on a superhero-based role-playing game, on September 1, 2009. Cryptic Studios had announced this title on February 14, 2008. It has, of February 2011, implemented a free-to-play model with optional micropayment transactions generating revenue, in addition to its traditional subscription system.

===&quot;Star Trek Online&quot;===
On July 27, 2008, Cryptic announced that they had acquired the license to continue development of a Star Trek based MMORPG previously developed by Perpetual Entertainment. Earlier, on March 13, 2008, &quot;Star Trek&quot; news site TrekMovie.com reported Cryptic Studios as the developer for &quot;Star Trek Online&quot; based on unnamed sources, confirming a several-weeks-old rumor. Star Trek Online was officially launched on February 2, 2010. The game resembles an action-oriented MMORPG, with combat and features divided between Space environments and Ground environments during play.

===&quot;Neverwinter&quot;===

In late August 2010, Atari and Cryptic announced the development of Neverwinter, a Dungeons &amp; Dragons MMORPG. Neverwinter was released on PC in 2013, Xbox One in 2015, and PlayStation 4 in 2016.

===&quot;Magic: Legends&quot;===
On June 7, 2017, Cryptic announced their new project, an MMORPG based on &quot;&quot;. It was later revealed under the name &quot;&quot;.

It was announced on June 29, 2021, that the game would shut down on October 31, 2021, before the end of its open beta.

===Other projects===
On May 9, 2007, Cryptic Studios released the Cryptic Animation Rig (Cryptic AR), a free download that gives animators the same tools used by Cryptic to animate characters in its games. Cryptic Studios&#x27; website contains several images of concept art from one or more additional games currently in development.

<doc id="664838" wikidata="Q606498" url="?curid=664838" title="Bronzed drongo">
<text>The bronzed drongo(Dicrurus aeneus) is a small Indomalayan bird belonging to the drongo group. They are resident in the forests of the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia. They capture insects flying in the shade of the forest canopy by making aerial sallies from their perches. They are very similar to the other drongos of the region but are somewhat smaller and compact with differences in the fork depth and the patterns of gloss on their feathers.

==Description==
This drongo is somewhat smaller than the black drongo and has more metallic gloss with a spangled appearance on the head, neck and breast. 
The lores are velvety and the ear coverts are duller. The tail is slender and well forked with the outer tail feathers flaring outward slightly. Immatures have their axillaries tipped in white. The young bird is duller and brownish with less spangling.

The nominate race is found in India and extending until the northern part of the Malay Peninsula. Specimens from southern India are however very similar in morphometrics to those from &quot;malayensis&quot; of Burma and the size variation may be clinal. The subspecies from China &quot;kwangsiensis&quot; is treated as synonymous with &quot;aeneus&quot;. Subspecies &quot;malayensis&quot; is found from Selangor south into, Sumatra and Borneo. Taiwan is home to &quot;braunianus&quot; in the mountains of the interior.

==Distribution==
The bronzed drongo is found in the Western Ghats and Eastern Ghats of India and the lower Himalayas from western Uttaranchal eastwards into Indochina and Hainan, the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and northern Borneo. This species is usually found in moist broadleaved forest. This species is exclusively found in forested areas.

==Behaviour and ecology==
They are found singly or in a group of two to three. They actively forage for insects under the forest canopy by making aerial sallies, often returning to their favourite perches. They sometimes join mixed-species foraging flocks. They are very good in mimicking calls of many other bird species which is a trait shared with many Drongo species. The breeding season is February to July. Three or four pinkish to brownish eggs are laid in a cup nest in a tree. The eggs are darker on the broad end and often have cloudy spots. The nest is covered in cobwebs and often appears whitish. These are aggressive and fearless birds, 24 cm in length, and will attack much larger species if their nest or young are threatened.

<text>The TN 75 is a French-built 150kt thermonuclear warhead used on France&#x27;s M45 and M51 submarine-launched ballistic missiles, carried by the last of the &quot;Redoutable&quot; class submarines, S616 &quot;Inflexible&quot;, and by the &quot;Triomphant&quot; class submarines. The French Navy has 290 TN-75 warheads. It is a miniaturized, hardened and stealthy successor to the TN 71.

Development began in 1987 and developmental testing of the warhead ended in 1991, but French president Jacques Chirac asserted in June 1995 (50 years after the Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki) that a full yield proof test was needed prior to deployment, causing an international outcry. Its first full-yield test was probably the 110 kt detonation on 1 October 1995 at Fangataufa.

It will be succeeded by the TNO, the &quot;Tête nucléaire océanique&quot;.

<text>Highway 13 is an long two-lane route through the eastern part of Langley, British Columbia. Highway 13 connects Washington state (via Washington State Route 539) to the central Fraser Valley.

==Route description==

Highway 13 begins at the Lynden–Aldergrove Border Crossing on the United States border as a continuation of Washington State Route 539, which travels south to Bellingham, Washington. The four-lane undivided highway brifely runs northwest before turning onto 264 Street, which it follows due north for through a rural area of the Fraser Valley. Highway 13 then travels through the western outskirts of Aldergrove, a residential area within Langley Township, where it intersects the Fraser Highway. The highway continues north, passing Naval Radio Section Aldergrove and the Greater Vancouver Zoo, before reaching its northern terminus at an interchange with Highway 1 (part of the Trans-Canada Highway).

==History==
Historically, segments of Highway 13 were referred to as Townline, County Line and Howes roads. In 1932, the highway was selected as a &quot;second artery&quot; to connect Yale Road to the U.S. border. and was designated an arterial highway. The official title of &quot;Aldergrove-Bellingham Highway&quot; came with the arterial designation.
In regard to the highway&#x27;s number. The number 13 was assigned around 1953 to the road between the Lynden–Aldergrove Border Crossing and the present day Fraser Highway (former Highway 1A). The designation was pushed north to Highway 401, the new freeway alignment of the Trans-Canada Highway, by 1965.

The southern section of the highway near the U.S. border crossing was widened from 2018 to 2020 at a cost of $25.5 million, with funding from the provincial and national governments. The widened highway features two northbound lanes and three southbound lanes for trucks, NEXUS users, and other vehicles.

<text>Canadian securities regulation is managed through the laws and agencies established by Canada&#x27;s 10 provincial and 3 territorial governments. Each province and territory has a securities commission or equivalent authority with its own provincial or territorial legislation.

Unlike other major federations, Canada has no securities regulatory authority at the federal government level. Nonetheless, most provincial security commissions operate under a passport system, so that approval of one commission essentially allows for registration in another province. However, concerns about the system remain. For example, Ontario (Canada&#x27;s largest capital market) does not participate in the passport regimen.

Securities regulators from each province and territory have joined to form the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA).

Concerns about the provincial system of securities regulation have led to repeated calls for a national securities system in Canada. As of June 2021, the Canadian government is working towards establishing a national securities regulatory system to provide:
* better and more consistent protection for investors across Canada;
* improved regulatory and criminal enforcement to better fight security-related crime;
* new tools to better support the stability of the Canadian financial system;
* faster policy responses to emerging market trends;
* simpler processes for businesses, resulting in lower costs for investors;
* more effective international representation and influence for Canada.

== List of securities regulators in Canada ==
Each provincial securities regulator is either a self-funded commission or an entity funded within a larger government department. Regulators (and their respective parent departments, if any) for each province include:

* Alberta Securities Commission;
* British Columbia Securities Commission;
* Manitoba Securities Commission – under the Manitoba Financial Services Agency; the Chair reports to the legislature through the Minister of Finance;
* Financial and Consumer Services Commission (New Brunswick) – arm&#x27;s length, self-funded, independent Crown Corporation established by the provincial government on 1 July 2013;
* Financial Services Regulation Division, Digital Government and Service NL (Newfoundland and Labrador);
* Office of the Superintendent of Securities (Northwest Territories) – under the Legal Registries division, Department of Justice;
* Nova Scotia Securities Commission;
* Nunavut Securities Office – under the Department of Justice;
* Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) – the largest of the provincial regulators;
* PEI Office of the Superintendent of Securities Office (Prince Edward Island) – under the Department of Justice and Public Safety/Office of the Attorney General;
* Autorité des marchés financiers (Quebec);
* Financial and Consumer Affairs Authority of Saskatchewan;
* Office of the Yukon Superintendent of Securities.

== Canadian securities regulatory system ==
Canada has no securities regulatory authority at the federal government level. Instead, each province and territory has a securities commission or equivalent authority and legislation. Provincial governments established regulatory agencies beginning with Manitoba in 1912; two decades later, the Privy Council of Canada decided in &quot;Lymburn v Mayland&quot; [1932] AC 318, that such legislation is authorized under the provincial property and civil rights power.

Each provincial securities regulator is either a self-funded commission or an entity funded within a larger government department, typically under the respective Justice department. The securities regulator administers the province&#x27;s securities legislation and, correspondingly, promulgates its own set of rules and regulations. The regulator relies on the work of the national self-regulatory organization—the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO)—for most aspects of the regulation of the organization&#x27;s member firms and their employees. Accountability for securities regulation extends from the securities regulator to the Minister responsible for securities regulation and, ultimately, the legislature in each province.

The largest of the provincial regulators is the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC). Other significant local regulators are the Alberta Securities Commission, British Columbia Securities Commission, and the Autorité des marchés financiers (Québec).

Public education on financial literacy, investment, and financial decision-making is a secondary focus of the provincial regulators. The OSC created the non-profit organization Investor Education Fund (IEF) for this sole purpose. Funded by the OSC but acting independently, IEF&#x27;s primary goal is to provide Canadians with financial tools and information to improve financial literacy.

=== Canadian Securities Administrators ===
The provincial and territorial regulators work together to coordinate and harmonize regulations, policies, and practices regarding Canadian capital markets through the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), an umbrella regulatory organization that serves Canadian markets, securities issuers, and investors. The major provincial securities regulators also participate in various international co-operative organizations and arrangements.

The CSA has focused its efforts on:
* Developing uniform rules and guidelines for securities market participants.
* Coordinating approval processes.
* Developing national electronic systems through which regulatory filings can be made with and processed by all jurisdictions.
* Coordinating compliance and enforcement activities.

The most critical CSA effort is implementing the &quot;&#x27;Passport&#x27;&quot; regulatory system. Under Passport, a market participant can obtain a decision from its principal regulator and, through a simple filing, have the same decision deemed to be issued under the legislation of all other participating jurisdictions, in essence providing a passport to undertake capital markets activity across Canada. The Passport system covers prospectus filings, registration of securities firms and individuals, and certain types of discretionary exemptions. Ontario is recognized by the other jurisdictions as a principal jurisdiction for Passport decisions, but the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) has not adopted the passport rule itself. As a result, Ontario market participants have access to other jurisdictions through the Passport system, but participants from other jurisdictions do not have access to Ontario. Instead, the OSC follows a &quot;mutual reliance&quot; policy in which it decides in each case whether to accept the decision of the principal regulator. Ontario has stated support for harmonization and improved coordination of securities regulation in Canada; however, it does not wish to participate in the passport system because it would prefer creating a national securities regulator.

== Concerns ==

On 21 February 2008, the Government of Canada appointed an Expert Panel on Securities Regulation to provide advice and recommendations on securities regulation in Canada. On 12 January 2009, the Panel released its final report, in which they highlighted several concerns with the current structure, along with a draft &quot;Securities Act&quot; to the federal Minister of Finance and the provincial and territorial ministers responsible for securities regulation.

The Panel was concerned that the fragmented structure, requiring decisions to be coordinated across up to 13 jurisdictions, made it difficult for Canadian securities regulators to react quickly and decisively to capital market events. One example of this difficulty was the adoption in September 2008 by some of Canada&#x27;s international counterparts, including the United States and the United Kingdom, of restrictions of short-selling specific stock as a temporary stability measure. The Canadian response lagged behind the coordinated efforts of the US and the UK and was not uniform across the provinces. A second example was the delay between the freezing of the non-bank asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) market in August 2007 and the release of a consultation paper by the CSA. The paper was for input on several proposals to prevent similar capital market failures in the future. The Panel found that the extant regulatory structure is prone to slow responses, making Canada vulnerable to market risks and impacting its reputation.

The Panel also expressed concern that the Canadian system of provincial mandates is not in agreement with the national response required to address developments in capital markets that are increasingly national and international in scope. They found that one of the crucial lessons from the capital markets crisis throughout 2008–2009 (the Great Recession) is that systemic risk is increasingly presenting itself in capital markets rather than confining itself to banking institutions. The Panel reported that effectively addressing systemic risk requires the joint effort of all financial sector regulators within Canada and effective coordination with international counterparts. The Panel did not believe that the multiple provincial and territorial securities regulators could work effectively as part of a national systemic risk management team, as structural challenges will likely compromise its ability to efficiently address larger capital market issues in a timely manner. A delayed response, having been poorly managed by any of the securities regulators, may have a negative impact on the integrity of Canada&#x27;s capital markets as a whole.

Additionally, the Panel reported that the current structure poorly allocates resources, causing securities regulation to be less effective. Resources are used in keeping 13 separate securities regulators operating in Canada. This is inefficient as each jurisdiction dedicates a different level of resources to securities regulation, which causes the intensity of policy development, supervision, and enforcement activities to vary across the country. Most efforts are duplicated, which results in unnecessary costs, overstaffing, and delays. Canadians, in turn, are afforded different levels of investor protection depending on the jurisdiction in which they reside or invest. At the same time, market participants will continue to be burdened with unnecessary compliance costs, even with the full implementation of the passport system. Market participants have to pay fees in up to 13 jurisdictions, deal with the general inefficiencies associated with differences between provincial statutes and regulations, the ongoing use of local rules, and variable interpretations of national rules.

== Canadian Securities Transition Office ==
The Canadian Securities Transition Office () is a federal organization that was created to assist in the establishment of a Canadian securities regulation regime and a Canadian regulatory authority. Its mandate is to help develop capital-markets regulatory capabilities falling within the jurisdiction of the Government of Canada.

Its mandate includes helping to prepare for the successful administration of the proposed federal &quot;Capital Markets Stability Act&quot;; providing support for the establishment of the Cooperative Capital Markets Regulatory System; and giving advice to the Canadian Department of Finance&#x27;s Financial Sector Policy Branch.

The Transition Office is tasked with leading all aspects of the transition towards a federal Canadian securities regulator, including developing the proposed federal &quot;Securities Act&quot; and the accompanying regulations, collaborating with provinces and territories, and developing and implementing a transition plan for organizational and administrative matters.

=== History ===

==== Background ====
Over the past 45 years, the majority of studies by independent expert and academic analysts have come out in favor of establishing a Canadian securities regulator, beginning with the Porter Report in 1964 and the Kimber Report in 1965. In the most recent decade, the push for a national regulator has been particularly strong, with reports delivered from the Wise Persons Committee, the Crawford Panel, and the Expert Panel on Securities Regulation.

In their final report in January 2009, the Expert Panel made a series of recommendations, the most important being establishing a Canadian securities regulator to administer a single &quot;Securities Act&quot; for all of Canada. The Expert Panel provided a recommended transition path to bring this about, with one key step being creating a transition and planning team to oversee the transition to a federal regulatory system.

On 22 June 2009, the Government of Canada acted on this recommendation and announced the launch of the Canadian Securities Transition Office to lead Canada&#x27;s effort to establish a Canadian securities regulator.

==== Development ====
The Canadian Securities Transition Office was implemented in July 2009 by the Government of Canada through the &quot;Canadian Securities Regulation Regime Transition Office Act&quot;.

Doug Hyndman was made the Chair and Chief Executive Officer of the Transition Office, and Bryan Davies the Vice-Chair. Hyndman had been Chair of the British Columbia Securities Commission since 1987; Davies had been Chair of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation since 2006, and previously the Chief Executive Officer and Superintendent of the Financial Services Commission of Ontario.

All Canadian jurisdictions have been invited and encouraged to join in the Government of Canada&#x27;s effort, which will build on the existing infrastructure and expertise of the provincial and territorial securities regulators. On 15 October 2009, the federal government announced the appointment of an Advisory Committee of ten Participating Provinces and Territories to the Transition Office with representatives from Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Ontario, Saskatchewan, British Columbia, Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut. The Advisory Committee provided advice to the Transition Office on the transition to a Canadian securities regulator to ensure that each of the participating governments&#x27; interests is represented in the work of establishing a Canadian securities regulator.

In its first year, the Transition Office and the Government of Canada completed two critical steps in transitioning to a Canadian securities regulator:

* On 26 May 2010, the federal government tabled for information in the House of Commons the proposed &quot;Canadian&quot; &quot;Securities Act&quot;. The proposed Act was built on provincial securities regulation and harmonized existing legislation in the form of a single statute. It benefits from the work of the Expert Panel on Securities Regulation and other reform efforts and reflects domestic and international best practices. It proposed significant improvements in terms of governance, adjudication, financial stability, regulatory and criminal enforcement, and provision for a wide scope of authority to regulate financial instruments and participants in capital markets.
* On 12 July 2010, the Transition Office delivered its Transition Plan for the Canadian Securities Regulatory Authority to the Minister of Finance and the ministers responsible for securities regulation of the participating provinces and territories.

Concurrent with releasing the proposed &quot;Canadian&quot; &quot;Securities Act&quot;, the federal government referred the proposed Act to the Supreme Court of Canada for its opinion on the following question: &quot;Is the annexed proposed &quot;Canadian&quot; &quot;Securities Act&quot; within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada?&quot; The Supreme Court heard the reference on 13 and 14 April 2011. On 22 December that year, the Supreme Court returned its decision, finding the proposed &quot;Canadian Securities Act&quot; to be beyond the constitutional authority of Parliament under the general trade and commerce power. More specifically, the proposed Act as drafted would not be valid under the general branch of the federal trade and commerce power under section 91(2) of the constitution. However, the court indicated that some aspects of the Act could be valid under that power. It also noted that it had not been asked for its opinion on the extent of Parliament&#x27;s legislative authority under other heads of federal power, including the interprovincial and international trade branch of section 91(2). The court concluded that a cooperative legislative approach through which the federal and provincial governments exercise their powers collaboratively would be possible.

Following the Supreme Court of Canada&#x27;s decision, the Government of Canada announced that it was exploring with provinces the possibility of working jointly to establish a standard securities regulator.

In 2013, the Government of Canada signed an agreement in principle with British Columbia and Ontario governments to establish a federal-provincial Cooperative Capital Markets Regulatory System. Since then, five other provinces and one territory have joined the Cooperative System.

To support the establishment of the Cooperative System, participating governments created the Capital Markets Authority Implementation Organization in 2015 to lead the work to integrate the participating regulatory organizations into the Capital Markets Regulatory Authority. Also, in 2015, the Transition Office began work to prepare for the successful administration of the proposed federal &quot;Capital Markets Stability Act,&quot; complementary federal legislation to the &quot;Canadian Securities Act.&quot;

In 2018, the Supreme Court of Canada found the proposed federal &quot;Capital Markets Stability Act&quot; within federal jurisdiction. It implemented a pan-Canadian securities regulator as contemplated within the Cooperative Capital Markets Regulatory System to permit the constitution.

=== Cooperative System ===
The Cooperative Capital Markets Regulatory System is a federal–provincial system being designed to streamline Canada&#x27;s capital markets regulatory framework to protect investors, foster efficient capital markets, and manage systemic risk while preserving strengths of the current system.

Jointly engaged in the implementation of this system are the federal Government of Canada and the governments of British Columbia, Ontario, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Yukon, under an interim body called the Capital Markets Authority Implementation Organization (CMAIO; , OMAMC).

The CMA&#x27;IOs purpose is to assist in transitioning to and implementing a single, operationally-independent&quot;&#x27; Capital Markets Regulatory Authority&#x27;&quot; (&quot;&#x27;CMRA&#x27;&quot;) contemplated for the Cooperative System. Once created, the CMRA will be the single regulator administering the proposed uniform provincial-territorial &quot;Capital Markets Act,&quot; a single set of regulations, and complementary federal &quot;Capital Markets Stability Act.&quot; These acts and the regulations would form the legislative cornerstones of the new Cooperative Capital Markets Regulatory System when passed.

The Transition Office provides office space and administrative, technical, and financial support to the CMAIO.

In 2021, the development of legislation to create the Cooperative System was put on hold as the participating governments needed to rework their plans in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. CMAIO operations were paused, effective 31 March 2021.

==== CMAIO leadership ====
The CMAIO Board of Directors is accountable to the Council of Ministers, composed of the federal Minister of Finance and the provincial and territorial Ministers responsible for capital-markets regulation in each participating jurisdiction.

The Council consists of:

* Selina Robinson, Minister of Finance (British Columbia)
* Peter Bethlenfalvy, Minister of Finance and President of the Treasury Board (Ontario)
* Gordon Wyant, Minister of Justice and Attorney General (Saskatchewan)
* Ernie Steeves, Minister of Finance (New Brunswick)
* Sarah Stoodley, Minister of Digital Government and Service NL (Newfoundland and Labrador)
* Karen Casey, Minister of Finance (Nova Scotia)
* Darlene Compton, Minister of Finance (Prince Edward Island)
* John Streicker, Minister of Community Services (Yukon)
* Chrystia Freeland, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance (Canada)

In July 2016, the Council of Ministers appointed an initial Board of Directors for CMAIO, composed of industry experts broadly representative of the regions of Canada. On 31 March 2021, CMAIO paused operations, and the following Directors remain on the Board:

* Jill Leversage, Chair
* Andrea Bolger
* Harold H. MacKay

<doc id="664861" wikidata="Q365736" url="?curid=664861" title="John Baird (Canadian politician)">
<text>John Russell Baird (born May 26, 1969) is a retired Canadian politician. He served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2011 to 2015 in the cabinet of Prime Minister Stephen Harper. He had been a member of the federal cabinet, in various positions, since 2006. Previously he was a provincial cabinet minister in Ontario during the governments of Premiers Mike Harris and Ernie Eves. Baird resigned from Harper&#x27;s cabinet on February 3, 2015, and as a Member of Parliament on March 16, 2015.

A long-time resident of the former city of Nepean, where he attended Bell High School, and a graduate of Kingston&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s University, he was the member of the House of Commons of Canada for the riding of Ottawa West—Nepean until 2015. Baird was elected there as a candidate for the Conservative Party of Canada in the 2006 federal election, when his party defeated Paul Martin&#x27;s Liberal Party and established a minority government. Baird was sworn in as Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, replacing Jay Hill, on August 6, 2010. Prior to this, Baird served as Transport Minister starting October 30, 2008, Environment Minister starting January 2007, and President of the Treasury Board during the Conservatives&#x27; first year in power.

Baird served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2005 for the riding of Nepean—Carleton (part of Nepean until 1999), and was a cabinet minister in the Progressive Conservative governments of Mike Harris and Ernie Eves. He served as the Minister for Children, Community and Social Services, Energy and Francophone Affairs in addition to being the Government&#x27;s Chief Whip. After the Conservatives&#x27; defeat by Dalton McGuinty&#x27;s Ontario Liberal Party, he was the party&#x27;s critic for key portfolios including finance, culture and health. Baird had been a member of the Conservatives since 1985, when he was the youngest delegate at that time and was also a political aide for the federal Progressive Conservative Party of Canada in the late 1980s.

During his tenure in the Harris Cabinet he supported an attempt to sell Hydro One, the publicly owned utility firm. As the federal President of the Treasury Board in the Harper Cabinet, he moved the &quot;Federal Accountability Act&quot;, which was put in place after the Gomery Commission which investigated the federal sponsorship scandal in the late 1990s and early 2000s. As Minister of the Environment, Baird signalled the Canadian government&#x27;s opposition to the Kyoto Protocol. He also served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities, and President of the Treasury Board.

==Early life and career==
Baird was born in Nepean, Ontario, the son of Marianne (née Collins) and Gerald Baird. He became involved in politics when he backed a candidate for the local federal PC nomination in 1984. The next year, aged sixteen, Baird was the youngest delegate to attend the party&#x27;s January 1985 provincial leadership convention, as a supporter of Ontario Attorney-General Roy McMurtry.

He was later president of the youth wing of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, and aligned himself with Dennis Timbrell during the latter&#x27;s abortive campaign for the PC leadership in 1989 and 1990. He backed Mike Harris when Timbrell withdrew from the contest. Baird was charged with trespassing during the 1988 federal election, after he tried to question Ontario Premier David Peterson about free trade with the United States during a Liberal Party campaign stop in a Kingston shopping mall. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Studies from Queen&#x27;s University in 1992.

Baird worked on the political staff of Perrin Beatty when Beatty was federal Minister of National Defence in the early 1990s, and followed Beatty through the subsequent cabinet shifts that culminated in his becoming Secretary of State for External Affairs in the short-lived 1993 government of Kim Campbell. After the defeat of the Progressive Conservatives in the 1993 federal election, Baird worked as a lobbyist in Ottawa.

Baird says he has been a vegetarian since 1997. However, he admits to eating fish, and he reportedly ate seal meat on a trip to the Arctic in 2009.

In June 2008, he was selected by the &quot;Ottawa Business Journal&quot; as a recipient of the &quot;Forty Under 40&quot; award.

==Provincial politics==

===Government backbencher===
While Baird had been associated with Red Tories such as McMurtry, Timbrell and Beatty, he became associated with the conservative ideology of the Mike Harris-led Ontario PC party upon entering provincial politics. He was first elected to the Ontario legislature in 1995, defeating Liberal incumbent Hans Daigeler in the Ottawa-area riding of Nepean. The youngest member of the legislature, Baird was appointed parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Labour on July 13, 1995.

He became parliamentary assistant to the Chair of the Management Board of Cabinet in April 1997, and was promoted to parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Finance in November of the same year. As a backbencher, Baird proposed a bill naming Highway 416 as the &quot;Veterans&#x27; Memorial Highway&quot; and successfully steered its passage through the legislature. He was easily re-elected in 1999, defeating longtime Ottawa councillor Gord Hunter by a margin of almost 15,000 votes.

===Community and Social Services minister===
Baird joined Premier Harris&#x27;s cabinet on June 17, 1999, as Minister of Community and Social Services, where he became responsible for implementing and expanding Ontario&#x27;s workfare program. As one of Harris&#x27;s few bilingual ministers, he was also named as Minister responsible for Francophone Affairs.

====1999====
Baird&#x27;s first press conference as a cabinet minister was held in July 1999, and was intended to highlight the Harris government&#x27;s record in reducing the provincial welfare rolls. He told reporters that 15,000 people had left the system since the introduction of workfare, and used this figure to argue that the government&#x27;s policy was a success. At the time, he lacked information on the number of workfare recipients who actually found jobs, and he also did not account for 40% of the welfare recipients who had been cut from the list. A number of media reports subsequently criticized both the principle and the implementation of workfare in Ontario.

A September 1999 report from Baird&#x27;s ministry showed that 10,600 workfare placements had been created in the first six months of 1999, a figure which the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; observed was significantly lower than that which had been predicted by the government. Baird indicated that he would continue with the workfare program, and that the proportion of welfare recipients on workfare would be increased from 15% to 30%.

Baird sparked criticism in late 1999 for refusing to cancel a five-year contract that had been signed between his department and the Bermuda-based private firm Andersen Consulting (later Accenture), worth up to $180 million. The contract, signed when Janet Ecker was Community and Social Services minister, entrusted Andersen with providing technological upgrades to the province&#x27;s welfare management system. The arrangement was criticized by Auditor General Erik Peters, who observed that there was nothing in the contract to prevent Andersen from increasing its hourly rates. A published report in early 2000 indicated that Andersen was charging an average of $257 per hour for work that had previously been done by ministry staff at $51 per hour. Another report indicated that the firm had charged a total of $55 million to find roughly $66 million worth of savings. In response to opposition questions, Baird said that he would not terminate the contract but would endeavour to negotiate a lower rate. Baird opposed the Harris government&#x27;s plan to amalgamate the city of Ottawa with neighboring municipalities, which was approved by the legislature in 1999.

====2000====
In January 2000, Baird unveiled a series of initiatives designed to reduce fraud and misuse in the welfare system. This was highlighted by the establishment of a welfare fraud hotline and a complementary conditionality three months later, in which anyone convicted of welfare fraud would run the risk of being given a lifetime ban from the program. The investigations Baird initiated during the fiscal year of 2000 uncovered $58.2 million in social assistance that people were not entitled to receive, and $16.6 million in avoided future costs, but critics of this approach, including opposition members, poverty advocates, and scholars, suggested that the Harris government was overstating the extent of fraud in order to undermine public confidence in welfare programs. In mid-year, Baird announced that workfare placements had reached departmental quotas for most of the province.

Baird revealed a $50 million program in May 2000 to help people with developmental disabilities become integrated into their communities. He later affirmed that the province was considering closing its remaining three institutions for the mentally handicapped as part of a larger strategy focusing on home care. Baird expressed concern about the physical condition of these institutions, saying that their residents &quot;deserve better&quot;. Later that same year, he stated that his department would spend $26 million on shelters and other funding for the homeless.

Baird supported mandatory drug-testing for welfare recipients and argued that those who refused such tests should be at risk of having their assistance cut off. He introduced a policy initiative to this effect at a press conference in late 2000, in which he dramatically cast a box of syringes onto the floor and said that his department planned to &quot;stop people from shooting their welfare cheque up their arm, and to help them shoot up the ladder of success&quot;. Baird acknowledged that his department did not have reliable figures on the number of welfare recipients abusing drugs, although he cited estimates of between 4% and 10%. The proposal was criticized by several people, including Ontario Human Rights Commissioner Keith Norton, a former Progressive Conservative cabinet minister, who expressed concern that it could violate Ontario&#x27;s human rights code, but officials including Baird justified the measures as, &quot;necessary in order to push people still receiving assistance toward independence.&quot;

Shortly after Baird&#x27;s announcement, a government website operated by the Ministry of Community and Social Services launched an attack against Liberal Party leader Dalton McGuinty for opposing the drug testing plan. The site claimed that McGuinty was &quot;opposed to helping welfare recipients who are addicted to drugs&quot;. Baird denied that the message was partisan and initially refused to apologize. The Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario subsequently ruled that the site content was inappropriate and it was removed by the government, with an apology.

====2001–2002====
In early 2001, Baird announced that his government&#x27;s proposed drug-testing plan would be extended to identify welfare recipients addicted to prescription drugs and alcohol. He later announced that provincial welfare applicants would be required to pass a literacy test. The Harris government&#x27;s welfare policies were put under scrutiny in August 2001 after a pregnant woman in Sudbury, Kimberly Rogers, died while serving a house arrest for welfare fraud. The woman had been confined to her apartment for three months and reports indicated that her pregnancy was &quot;exacerbated by sweltering conditions in her apartment&quot;. Responding to criticism, Baird said that he could not comment on the specifics of the case until a coroner&#x27;s inquest was completed. He defended his government&#x27;s general policy on welfare issues. A subsequent inquest did not assign blame to the government for the woman&#x27;s death, but recommended that lifetime bans for fraud be eliminated, and that adequate food, housing and medication be provided to anyone under house arrest.

Baird was given additional responsibilities as Minister responsible for Children on February 8, 2001. His department increased funding for child services early in the year, amid a significant increase in provincial demand. In November 2001, the provincial media obtained a confidential government report recommending 40–45% cuts in provincial child-care programs. Baird initially declined to comment on the document&#x27;s contents, but rejected its proposals in early 2002.

Baird was the first cabinet minister to support Jim Flaherty&#x27;s campaign to succeed Mike Harris as Progressive Conservative leader in the party&#x27;s 2002 leadership election. The election was won by Flaherty&#x27;s rival Ernie Eves, and early media reports suggested that Baird might be dropped from the new premier&#x27;s cabinet in April 2002. He was not, but was demoted to the position of Chief Government Whip while remaining associate minister for Francophone Affairs. His replacement in Social Services was Brenda Elliott, who was from the more centrist wing of the Progressive Conservative Party.

===Energy Minister and Government House Leader===
Baird was returned to a more prominent cabinet position in August 2002 after Eves separated the ministries of Environment and Energy and appointed Baird to head the latter department. Baird was given additional responsibilities as Government House Leader in June 2003 after Chris Stockwell was forced to resign following allegations that he had used government funds for a family vacation.

As Energy Minister, Baird was entrusted with implementing the government&#x27;s plan to sell off part of Ontario&#x27;s Hydro One. A few months later, he became unexpectedly involved in two major and interrelated policy reversals. The Energy ministry came under intense media scrutiny in late 2002 after hydro rates increased significantly in many parts of the province. Critics argued that the Progressive Conservative government&#x27;s price deregulation policy (implemented before Baird became Energy Minister) was responsible. Baird suggested that the rate increases resulted from an unusually hot summer. Rates remained high through the autumn, and the Eves government was forced to re-regulate the market in November by introducing a price cap. The government continued to support deregulation in principle, but maintained the cap for the remainder of its term in office. The second and more fundamental reversal occurred in late January 2003, when Premier Eves announced that Hydro One would remain under public control.

Baird was regarded as less combative as Energy Minister than he had been in Community and Social Services. The energy policies of the Eves government were controversial, but opposition criticism was often directed at the premier rather than at Baird. Eves took a prominent interest in the Energy portfolio, and sometimes relegated Baird to a secondary role in policy announcements. In November 2002, however, he was followed around the province by &quot;Hydrozilla&quot;, a man in a giant lizard suit sent by the Ontario New Democratic Party as a stunt to show that deregulating electricity rates would create an &#x27;economic monster&#x27; for consumers. In early March 2003, Baird announced that the government might be forced to implement rolling blackouts as a response to energy shortages. He encouraged conservation in late summer 2003, following a province-wide blackout caused by a generator failure in the United States.

===Opposition member===
The Ontario Liberal Party won a majority government in the 2003 election, although Baird was comfortably re-elected in his own seat. Between 2003 and 2005 he served as Official Opposition critic for Finance, Culture, Francophone Affairs, Intergovernmental Affairs and Health. He opposed the imposition of a health premium by Dalton McGuinty&#x27;s government in 2004, charging that the Liberals broke an election pledge not the raise taxes. Baird and New Democrat Peter Kormos were vocal critics of Speaker Alvin Curling for allegedly favouring his Liberal colleagues, saying that he sanctioned Conservative and NDP members for behaviour he would allow from Liberals. At one stage, Baird described Curling&#x27;s job performance as an &quot;absolute disgrace&quot;.

Baird co-chaired Jim Flaherty&#x27;s second campaign to lead the Progressive Conservative party in 2004. Flaherty was again unsuccessful, losing on the second ballot to the more centrist John Tory. Baird and Flaherty left provincial politics in 2005 to campaign for the federal House of Commons. Although Baird was generally on the right wing of the provincial Progressive Conservative Party, he expressed liberal views on some social issues. He supported same-sex marriage during the 2003 provincial election, and in 2005 helped the McGuinty government achieve quick passage of a provincial bill granting legal recognition to same-sex couples.

==Federal politics==

Baird supported a Canadian Alliance candidate in the 2000 federal election, and later endorsed Stephen Harper&#x27;s bid to lead the newly formed Conservative Party of Canada in its 2004 leadership election. He was appointed as the Conservative Party&#x27;s Ontario co-chair for the 2004 federal election. There were rumours that Baird would leave provincial politics to contest the 2004 election, but this did not happen. In 2005 he resigned his provincial seat to campaign federally for the Conservative Party.

Baird won a contested nomination battle for Ottawa West—Nepean Conservative nomination on May 5, 2005, defeating challengers Ed Mahfouz, Margret Kopala and Ade Olumide. John Pacheco later campaigned in the election as an &quot;Independent conservative&quot;, with the specific intent of being a spoiler against Baird. He argued that if his campaign caused Baird to lose, the Conservatives would &quot;get the message that social conservatives are serious about their politics.&quot; Baird chose to ignore Pacheco entirely in at least one all-candidates debate.

Baird was elected, defeating Liberal candidate Lee Farnworth by about 5,000 votes. The &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; endorsed Baird in this campaign, and argued that his political judgment had improved considerably since his tenure as a Harris cabinet minister. In December 2006 Baird was one of thirteen Conservative MPs who voted against reopening the national debate on same-sex marriage.

Baird played an aggressive role in Question Period after his appointment to cabinet, leading MP Garth Turner to describe him as Stephen Harper&#x27;s &quot;Commons pit bull&quot;.

===President of the Treasury Board===
Baird was appointed President of the Treasury Board on February 6, 2006. Following his appointment, he said that one of his priorities would be to prevent government jobs from being relocated from Ottawa to other regions for political purposes. Baird also indicated that his government was not planning to introduce job cuts or initiate a radical reduction in the size of government. In June 2006 he announced the creation of a three-member panel to advise the federal government on grant and contribution programs and accountability issues. One of the members was Frances Lankin, a former Ontario New Democratic Party cabinet minister.

====Accountability Act====
Baird introduced the Conservative government&#x27;s first piece of legislation in April 2006. The &quot;Accountability Act&quot; promised significant reform to the structure of Canadian politics and government. Prime Minister Harper said that it would &quot;put an end to the influence of money&quot; in the Canadian government. The &quot;Accountability Act&quot; restricted the ability of former politicians and bureaucrats to become lobbyists, provided protection to whistle-blowers in the civil service and gave the Auditor General of Canada new powers of oversight. It limited individual donations to political parties and candidates to $1,100 per year (down from $5,200), created nine new or revised positions to oversee the activities of public officials and placed crown corporations such as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation under access-to-information legislation.

Opposition MPs complained that several recommendations for access-to-information reform were omitted from the bill, and were instead sent to committee for further review. New Democratic Party MP Pat Martin suggested that this deferral could delay meaningful reform for the foreseeable future. Martin later made a deal with Baird to give the bill an easy passage through committee, in return for the Conservatives accepting some NDP amendments.

Information Commissioner John Reid criticized the new proposed powers for his department under the legislation, arguing that they would create unnecessary bureaucracy. Shortly after the &quot;Accountability Act&quot; was introduced to parliament, Reid issued an emergency report saying that the legislation would &quot;increase the government&#x27;s ability to cover up wrongdoing, shield itself from embarrassment and control the flow of information to Canadians&quot;. He added that no government had ever put forward &quot;a more retrograde and dangerous&quot; set of proposals for dealing with access to information laws. Baird described Reid&#x27;s criticisms as &quot;excessive&quot;, stating that most of the commissioner&#x27;s specific concerns were minor in nature. Representatives of Canada&#x27;s business community also expressed concern about changes to disclosure laws, arguing that their commercial secrets could be exposed to competitors.

The bill passed the House of Commons on division in June 2006. The Senate of Canada approved it in December 2006, with several amendments, and sent it back to the Commons for further consideration. The amended Act was approved by the Commons without debate on December 8, and was signed into law four days later.

Shortly after the bill first passed the Commons, Baird acknowledged that the Conservatives might have unintentionally broken political financing laws by failing to report convention fees collected in 2005. He told a Senate committee that $1.7 million was left unreported and that he did not realize it was an issue at the time. The matter is under review by the Chief Electoral Officer. The Conservatives quietly tabled an amendment to the &quot;Accountability Act&quot; in November 2006, stipulating that convention fees will not be counted as political contributions.

====Program cuts====
In May 2006, Baird was asked to find $1 billion in cuts for 2006 and 2007. On September 25, on the same day that the government announced a $13.2 billion surplus, Baird announced cuts to sixty-six federal programs, including Status of Women, medicinal marijuana research, Canadian museums, adult literacy, youth employment and social development and the British Columbia pine beetle program. One of the most controversial cuts was to the federal Court Challenges Program, which provided funding for Canadians to pursue rights cases in the Canadian court system. Baird argued that government funding would be redirected in a way that &quot;reflects the priorities of working families&quot; and that he &quot;just [didn&#x27;t] think it made sense for the government to subsidize lawyers to challenge the government&#x27;s own laws in court.&quot; In justifying cuts to adult literacy programs, Baird referenced his government&#x27;s support for youth literacy and said, &quot;We&#x27;ve got to fix the ground level problem and not be trying to do repair work after the fact.&quot;

====2006 Ottawa municipal election====
In early October 2006, Baird&#x27;s department reviewed a promised $200 million grant to the City of Ottawa&#x27;s light-rail expansion project for the O-Train. Baird indicated that the government would keep the funding at least until the November election, but added that the Council elected in November would have the final say on the issue. He also leaked details of the city&#x27;s contact with the German firm Siemens. As a result, the rail program became a focal issue in the 2006 Ottawa mayoral election and Baird&#x27;s opponents accused him of trying to influence the outcome. Baird and Ottawa Mayor Bob Chiarelli accused one another of lying about details of the project, and Liberal MP Navdeep Bains asked the Federal Ethics Commissioner to investigate Baird&#x27;s decision to release details of the private contract. Chiarelli was defeated in the election and the light-rail expansion was stopped by the new council.

An &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; report in January 2007 revealed that federal officials had not posed any objections to the light-rail project before Baird&#x27;s intervention, and suggested that his involvement was political in nature. Green Party leader Elizabeth May speculated that Ottawa may have been deprived of light-rail service because of an apparent &quot;personal vendetta&quot; from Baird against Chiarelli. Baird denied this charge, saying that his intervention was not political.

Opponents of the light-rail project have argued that it was undertaken without sufficient consultation with the public. In February 2008, it was reported that the House of Commons committee on government operations would be looking into his involvement over the case. MP and committee member Mark Holland voiced a concern that Baird leaked information on the contract. Baird replied that he made the right decision and dismissed the investigation saying &quot;there is no evidence of anything&quot;. Speaking to reporters he added following the announcement of the investigation: &quot;If you want to avert a billion-dollar boondoggle, you have to make some difficult decisions&quot;.

====Other responsibilities====
Baird held ministerial responsibilities for the Toronto Harbourfront Centre and the Toronto Waterfront Revitalization Corporation. He developed a working relationship with Toronto Mayor David Miller soon after his appointment, and was present for the announcement of a comprehensive new waterfront strategy in June 2006. Ontario cabinet minister David Caplan described Baird as a champion of waterfront renewal and Miller described him as an ally of the city. Baird spent Christmas 2006 meeting with Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan.

===Environment Minister 2007–08===
On January 4, 2007, Baird was appointed as Environment Minister in a cabinet shuffle, replacing Rona Ambrose. In making the appointment, Prime Minister Stephen Harper acknowledged that his government needed to do more to make the environment a priority. Some commentators remarked favourably on Baird&#x27;s appointment, describing him as a strong communicator and negotiator. Columnist Andrew Coyne, however, described Baird as &quot;the man sent to kill the issue,&quot; suggesting that Baird&#x27;s appointment was meant to neutralize the environment as an election issue rather than to initiate any meaningful reforms. Baird is a vocal opponent of the Kyoto Protocol, which he argues will bring about an &quot;economic collapse&quot;. Later in 2007, he added that any new environmental agreements must include reduction targets for major greenhouse emitters such as China, India and the United States who have not signed the Protocol or does not have any mandatory reductions set by the Protocol. Baird met with renowned Canadian environmentalist David Suzuki following his appointment. At the time Suzuki said he was encouraged by Baird&#x27;s approach, but remained skeptical of the Harper government&#x27;s environmental plans. However, when Baird unveiled the Conservative government&#x27;s plan in April 2007, Suzuki confronted him, calling the plan &quot;a disappointment&quot;.

====Approach to the Kyoto Protocol====
In February 2007, the Liberal opposition brought forward a non-binding motion for Canada to renew its commitment to the Kyoto Protocol. All Conservative MPs who were present in the House, including Baird, voted against the motion, which passed with the support of the three opposition parties. The following month, opposition members on a special Commons committee used their majority to bring forward sweeping changes to the government&#x27;s &quot;Clean Air Act&quot;. Among other things, the revised Act called for participation in international carbon markets and the fulfillment of Kyoto targets.

Baird indicated that the opposition&#x27;s changes would not be included in federal targets or regulations.

In April 2007, Baird produced a federal study supported by five independent economists to support his approach to the Kyoto Protocol. Among the five economists was Toronto-Dominion Bank chief economist Don Drummond, who also wrote a private letter to Baird arguing that the &quot;economic cost [of implementing Kyoto] would be at least as deep as the recession in the early 1980s.&quot; Opposition parliamentarians dismissed the report as a scare tactic, while Liberal Environment critic David McGuinty argued that the study was misleading, saying that it did not properly examine international emission trading and ignored jobs to be created through the &quot;green economy&quot;. The report claimed that Canada&#x27;s ability to invest in developing nations to meet emissions targets through CDM by misquoting the amount of credit to be $85 million instead of the real approximation of $3 billion. Soon afterward, a United Nations report also contradicted the study mentioning that &quot;steep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions can be accomplished at a cost of only 0.12 per cent of the world&#x27;s annual economic output&quot; but Baird responded that Canada&#x27;s gas emission levels would peak in 2012, three years before the UN&#x27;s set target of 2015.

====Environmental strategy====
Baird was the Harper government&#x27;s representative at the release of a major United Nations report on climate change in Paris in February 2007. He described the report as a &quot;turning point in the battle against climate change,&quot; while indicating his surprise that human activity was found to be a major cause of the phenomenon.

Baird released his government&#x27;s targets for greenhouse gas emissions in late April 2007. The plan calls for Canada to begin cutting its existing rate of greenhouse gas emissions by 2010 and for cuts to reach 20% by 2020. Under this plan, Canada will reach its Kyoto targets between 2020 and 2025, taking an additional eight to thirteen years longer than Kyoto. The government plan uses production intensity targets instead of hard caps. Baird said that the &quot;plan strikes a balance between the perfection some environmentalists may be seeking and the status quo that some in industry seek to protect.&quot; In December 2007, Baird revealed in a plan that over 700 big-polluter companies, including oil and gas, pulp and paper, electricity and iron and steel companies, must cut greenhouse emissions by six percent between 2008 and 2010. The companies would also have to produce an annual report every May 31 that would include data regarding the level of greenhouses emissions produced each year.
Baird&#x27;s proposal has been met with approval from Canada&#x27;s oilpatch executives, who described them as the toughest emission regulations in the world, and who feared that more stringent standards would stifle oil sands exploration. Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty had been considerably less critical than his brother, federal Liberal Member of Parliament David McGuinty, having written to Prime Minister Harper on the environmental policy. The Premier had stressed the importance of a policy that considered the North American market as a whole, due to the automotive industry&#x27;s importance to his province. McGuinty said the Conservatives&#x27; environmental plan could have gone further but described the auto emissions part of the plan as &quot;very sensible&quot;.

Members of opposition parties have criticized the government&#x27;s abandonment of the Kyoto goals, while David Suzuki described the proposal as a &quot;sham&quot; with &quot;weak targets&quot;. Former US vice president Al Gore said Baird&#x27;s plan was a &quot;complete and total fraud&quot; that was &quot;designed to mislead the Canadian people&quot;. Baird responded by defending his plan and by criticizing Gore&#x27;s environmental record, noting that no similarly stringent measures were passed during Gore&#x27;s tenure in office and that the Kyoto Treaty was never submitted to the US Senate for ratification. Liberal Party MP Pablo Rodriguez introduced to the House of Commons a private bill that would have forced Canada to comply with the Kyoto Treaty in response to the government&#x27;s plan. While the bill passed, Baird mentioned that, even though that the government wouldn&#x27;t dismiss the idea, there were no new environmental measures planned. All three opposition parties demanded that the environment become one of the main points of the government&#x27;s Throne Speech in the 2007 fall session.

====Environmental record====
Shortly after his appointment, Baird, Stephen Harper and Natural Resources Minister Gary Lunn announced $1.5 billion for clean-energy initiatives over the next decade. Baird and Lunn also announced a $230 million program for clean energy technology. Lunn said that &quot;there were literally hundreds of programs but there was no focus&quot; when the Conservatives took office. Critics argued that the new Conservative measures were similar to measures introduced by the Liberals in their 2005 budget. Former Liberal leader Stéphane Dion has argued that the Conservative Party&#x27;s strategy is too strongly focused on nuclear energy.

On February 12, 2007, Baird appeared at a press conference with Stephen Harper and Quebec Premier Jean Charest to announce a $1.5 billion environmental fund for the provinces. Journalist Frances Russell criticized that as a reduction from the $3 billion promised by the previous Liberal government.

Canada is a signatory to the Kyoto protocol which legally requires signatory countries to set up compatible carbon trading markets. In direct defiance of this international legal obligation, in March 2007, Baird indicated that he wanted Canadian companies to be banned, or at least severely restricted, from participating in the international carbon market. Several European countries had already set up a trading system to allow companies that reduce their emission levels below government targets to sell &quot;credits&quot; on an international market. Many industry leaders argued that Canada should adopt a similar policy. Then-opposition leader Stéphane Dion argued that participation will allow Canadian firms to make &quot;megatonnes of money&quot;. Baird however described some carbon markets as &quot;shaky,&quot; and argued that trade should be restricted to within Canada, or perhaps within North America. In April he indicated that Canadian businesses would soon gain the right to earn credits by investing in overseas environmental projects.

Baird defended another Conservative government decision to cut funds for climate science research, arguing that further studies are largely superfluous in light of recent United Nations reports. Gordon McBean of the Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences has disagreed, claiming that further research is the best way to adapt to a changing climate.

Baird said in a House of Commons Committee that his government would not consider the implementation of a carbon tax. He told that the government&#x27;s approach &quot;will be to provide regulation for industry to ensure we reduce both greenhouse gas emissions and reduce air pollutants&quot;

====Bali====
While participating at the United Nations Summit On Climate Changes in Bali, Indonesia, Baird announced a $86 million funding to help Canadian communities notably coping with the loss of forests due to pine beetles in the west and of infrastructures in the north due to softer soil. The four-year plan included $56 million on several projects and $29 million for research.

Baird was criticized by some parties and observers for obstructing progress on what was to become &#x27;the Bali Action Plan&#x27;. Baird showed up for the Bali Conference at which it was intended he explain Canada&#x27;s position at a meeting with non-governmental activists, but instead quickly left, with one of the activists alleging that Baird left because he &quot;probably did not want to confront young activists critical of Canada&#x27;s stand.&quot;

===Draft Baird Movement===
In late November and early December 2008, a website went online allegedly representing a movement to draft Baird for leader of the Conservative Party, in the face of Stephen Harper facing possible defeat by an opposition coalition.

The draft group allegedly comprised over 100 party members from across the country—including two MPs and one Senator (who, reportedly, had requested anonymity). In its only contact with the media, the campaign claimed it had nearly 3,000 visitors and 237 new supporters in less than ten hours.

Baird indicated afterward not only that he was loyal to Harper, but that he was uninterested in ever becoming party leader. In 2011 he told a newspaper, &quot;Some people may have when growing up, always harboured leadership ambitions. I&#x27;ve never harboured leadership ambitions. It is the honest-to-God truth.&quot;

===Minister of Transport (2008–2010)===
Baird served as Minister of Transport between October 30, 2008, and August 6, 2010.

===&#x27;Interim&#x27; Environment Minister 2010–2011===

====Cancun climate &#x27;fossil awards&#x27;====
After resuming his environment portfolio from November 2010 until January 2011, Baird was the Harper government&#x27;s main representative to the United Nations climate conference in Cancun in December 2010. On the first day, Canada &quot;won&quot; three Fossil of the Day awards, awards which, after a vote by more than 400 leading international organizations, go to countries that do the most to disrupt or undermine UN climate talks.&quot; Canada under Baird was accused of &quot;working against progressive legislation to address climate change&quot;, cited for &quot;cancelling support for clean energy and for failing to have any plan to meet its very weak target for reducing [Canada]&#x27;s greenhouse gas emissions.&quot;

===Foreign Affairs Minister 2011–2015===
Activists on board a Canadian boat taking supplies to Gaza (which had been blockaded by the Israeli government to ensure that weapons and other contraband did not enter Gaza) in November 2011 urged Baird to resign as foreign minister for &quot;failing to do his job&quot;. They said they had been roughed up and Tasered by Israeli forces and that &quot;If minister Baird wants to put the interests of a far-right Israeli government before Canadians, he should apply for the job of Israel&#x27;s ambassador&quot;.
Baird affirmed Canada&#x27;s support for Likud&#x27;s opposition to Palestinian statehood while visiting Israel in February 2012.

On September 7, 2012, he announced the sudden closure of Canada&#x27;s embassy in Tehran and the expulsion of all Iranian diplomats from Canada. Baird made the announcement at an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Russia. He said Canada&#x27;s decision was not linked to growing speculation of an imminent attack by Israel on Iran&#x27;s nuclear facilities. Baird said &quot;Canada views the government of Iran as the most significant threat to global peace and security in the world today.&quot; Canada&#x27;s actions were immediately praised by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who described them as &quot;bold leadership.&quot;

Baird signed an agreement between the Governments of the United Arab Emirates and Canada for cooperation in the field of peaceful uses of nuclear energy.

Baird&#x27;s criticism of the stance of several African countries on same-sex rights and of the Russian Federation for its ban on &quot;homosexual propaganda&quot; and other moves to suppress LGBT rights have been condemned by the social conservative lobby group REAL Women of Canada which issued a statement accusing him of &quot;abuse of office&quot; claiming that &quot;Mr. Baird&#x27;s actions are destructive to the conservative base in Canada and causing collateral damage to his party.&quot; A spokesman for Baird&#x27;s office replied stating &quot;The promotion and protection of human rights is an integral part of Canada’s foreign policy.&quot;

Baird refused to sign the world Arms Trade Treaty, with the Canadian government reportedly ordering its diplomats to play a &quot;low-key, minimal role&quot; during negotiations and protect the rights of Canadian gun owners.

===Resignation and departing public office===

Following his resignation as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Baird remained a backbench MP for several weeks. On February 19, 2015, he represented the government at the re-opening of Canada House, the home of the Canadian High Commission to the United Kingdom. Baird&#x27;s resignation from parliament took effect on March 16, 2015.

==Private sector==
Since leaving politics, Baird has accepted several private sector appointments. In June 2015 he was hired as a strategic adviser to Hatch Ltd, an international engineering and consulting firm for companies in the resource industry. In October 2015 he joined political risk consulting firm Eurasia Group as a senior adviser, where he offers strategic insight to companies on how global politics affects business. He has also been hired as an adviser to Bennett Jones, and accepted an appointment to the board of directors of Canadian Pacific Railway.

On March 27, 2015, Barrick Gold Corp. announced Mr. Baird&#x27;s appointment to its international advisory board, along with former U.S. Speaker of the House of Representatives, Newt Gingrich. No compensation details were disclosed in the filings.

In August 2018, Baird appeared on Saudi-owned TV station Al Arabiya to comment on the diplomatic dispute between Canada and Saudi Arabia and urged Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to fly to Riyadh to apologize in person to the Saudi royal family. NDP MP Charlie Angus called the appearance &quot;stunning&quot; and suggested that the Ethics Commissioner should investigate the incident.

==Later political activity==
Following the 2019 federal election, Baird was commissioned by the Conservative Party to investigate and deliver a report analyzing the party&#x27;s campaign and the reasons for its failure to win the election. When party leader Andrew Scheer resigned, Baird supported Pierre Poilievre&#x27;s prospective leadership campaign, agreeing to be its campaign chair. Poilievre unexpectedly decided not to enter the campaign, however, and Baird was encouraged to run as a &quot;true blue&quot; candidate in his place. On February 13, 2020, Baird announced he would not be a candidate in the 2020 Conservative Party of Canada leadership election. 

He endorsed Pierre Poilievre in the 2022 Conservative Party of Canada leadership election.

In 2024, Baird was listed as one of the top 25 most influential conservatives in federal politics.

<text>Fangataufa (or Fangatafoa) is an uninhabited coral atoll in the eastern part of the Tuamotu Archipelago in French Polynesia. The atoll has been fully-owned by the French state since 1964. From 1966 to 1996 it was used as a nuclear test site by the French government. In total, 4 atmospheric and 10 underground nuclear explosions were carried out on the atoll.

==Geography==
The atoll is a coral outgrowth of a seamount which rises some from the seafloor, to a depth of . The seamount was formed 33.4 - 34.7 million years ago by the Pitcairn hotspot. The island is approx. long and wide. It has a lagoon area of and a land area of . It is located south of Moruroa atoll, east of Tematangi, southwest of the Gambier Islands and southeast of Tahiti.

Access to the lagoon is through a pass lying SW of the northernmost point of the atoll; the channel has a width of about and a dredged depth of . A quay, in of water, is situated in the NE part of the lagoon; another quay, long in of water, and landing ramps, were constructed in its E part. The access channel is marked, on each side, by two beacons. There is an abandoned airfield, built to accommodate medium size transport aircraft, on the NE coast of the atoll.

==History==
The first recorded European to arrive at Fangataufa Atoll was Frederick William Beechey in 1826, who gave it the name &quot;Cockburn island&quot; in honour of George Cockburn.

===Nuclear test site===

Occasionally occupied during the 20th century, the atoll was selected by France in 1963 for use as a nuclear test site to replace Reggane and In Ecker in the Algerian Sahara. Along with Mururoa, it was formally ceded to France by the Territorial Assembly in 1964.

The first nuclear test at Fangataufa was &quot;Rigel&quot;, an atmospheric test, conducted on 24 September 1966. This was followed by three more atmospheric tests, including &quot;Canopus&quot;, France&#x27;s first two-stage thermonuclear test, on 24 August 1968. The last atmospheric test was &quot;Orion&quot;, on 2 August 1970.

Following increasing criticism from Pacific countries, France switched to underground testing. Preparations began in 1974, and the first test, &quot;Achille&quot;, was carried out on 5 June 1975. This was followed by a second test, &quot;Hector&quot;, on 30 November 1975. Testing then moved exclusively to Mururoa until 1988, when growing safety concerns around the stability of Muroroa&#x27;s atoll saw some testing move to Fangataufa. Eight further underground tests were conducted on the atoll, with the final one, &quot;Xouthos&quot; occurring on 27 January 1996.

===Since 1998===
Today, Fangataufa serves as a wildlife sanctuary for various species of birds. It is permanently uninhabited, and is classified as a Common Military Zone. The zone includes the lagoon areas enclosed by the atoll and by baselines linking the closest points emerging from the reef on both sides of the channel. Entry is prohibited without authorization. The atoll has been the subject of radiological monitoring since 1998 with an annual environmental sampling campaign carried out by Defense personnel and the Atomic Energy Commission (CEA).

In February 2006 an inquiry by the French Polynesian government found that the French government had lied to the local population about the effects of atmospheric testing. On 15 October 2006, the Assembly of French Polynesia adopted a report on the consequences of nuclear testing which concluded that &quot;nuclear testing has had a major impact on health, the environment, society and the Polynesian economy&quot;. The Economic, Social and Cultural Council at the start of this report recommends that &quot;the State recognizes the nuclear fact and assumes its full responsibility accordingly&quot;. In November 2008 the French government agreed to compensate military personnel involved in the tests.

In February 2021, the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research INSERM published a report entitled &quot;Nuclear tests and health - Consequences in French Polynesia&quot;. The objective of this study was to establish an assessment of the available international scientific knowledge on the health consequences of the atmospheric nuclear tests conducted by France in French Polynesia, on the general population and former civilian and military workers.

==Administration==
Administratively Fangataufa Atoll is part of the commune of Tureia, which includes the atolls of Tureia, Moruroa, Tematangi and Vanavana.

In January 2012 French Polynesian President Oscar Temaru called for the return of Fangataufa and Mururoa. A bill to return the atolls by Senator Richard Tuheiava passed the Senate of France in 2012, but had not yet been debated by the French National Assembly by the time it was meant to take effect in 2014.

<doc id="664864" wikidata="Q856531" url="?curid=664864" title="Greater racket-tailed drongo">
<text>The greater racket-tailed drongo (Dicrurus paradiseus) is a medium-sized Asian bird which is distinctive in having elongated outer tail feathers with webbing restricted to the tips. They are placed along with other drongos in the family Dicruridae. They are conspicuous in the forest habitats often perching in the open and by attracting attention with a wide range of loud calls that include perfect imitations of many other birds. One hypothesis suggested is that these vocal imitations may help in the formation of mixed-species foraging flocks, a feature seen in forest bird communities where many insect feeders forage together. These drongos will sometimes steal insect prey caught or disturbed by other foragers in the flock and another idea is that vocal mimicry helps them in diverting the attention of smaller birds to aid their piracy. They are diurnal but are active well before dawn and late at dusk. Owing to their widespread distribution and distinctive regional variation, they have become iconic examples of speciation by isolation and genetic drift.

==Taxonomy==
In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the greater racket-tailed drongo in his &quot;Ornithologie&quot; based on a specimen that had been collected in Thailand (Siam). He used the French name &quot;Le Coucou Verd Hupé de Siam&quot; and the Latin &quot;Cuculus Siamensis Cristatus Viridis&quot;. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the greater racket-tailed drongo. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Cuculus paradiseus&quot; and cited Brisson&#x27;s work. The current genus &quot;Dicrurus&quot; was introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1816.

There are 13 recognised subspecies:
* &quot;D. p. grandis&quot; (Gould, 1836) – north India through west and north Myanmar and south China to north Indochina
* &quot;D. p. rangoonensis&quot; (Gould, 1836) – central India through Bangladesh, central Myanmar and north Thailand to central Indochina
* &quot;D. p. paradiseus&quot; (Linnaeus, 1766) – south India to south Thailand, north Malay Peninsula and south Indochina
* &quot;D. p. johni&quot; (Hartert, 1902) – Hainan Island (off southeast China)
* &quot;D. p. ceylonicus&quot; Vaurie, 1949 – Sri Lanka
* &quot;D. p. otiosus&quot; (Richmond, 1902) – Andaman Islands
* &quot;D. p. nicobariensis&quot; (Baker, ECS, 1918) – Nicobar Islands
* &quot;D. p. hypoballus&quot; (Oberholser, 1926) – central Malay Peninsula
* &quot;D. p. platurus&quot; Vieillot, 1817 – south Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and nearby islands
* &quot;D. p. microlophus&quot; (Oberholser, 1917 – islands in the South China Sea (Tioman Island, Anambas Islands and the North Natuna Islands)
* &quot;D. p. brachyphorus&quot; (Bonaparte, 1850) – Borneo
* &quot;D. p. banguey&quot; (Chasen &amp; Kloss, 1929) – islands off north Borneo
* &quot;D. p. formosus&quot; (Cabanis, 1851) – Java

==Description==
In most of its range in Asia, this is the largest of the drongo species and is readily identifiable by the distinctive tail rackets and the crest of curled feather that begin in front of the face above the beak and along the crown to varying extents according to the subspecies. The tail with twirled rackets is distinctive and in flight it can appear as if two large bees were chasing a black bird. In the eastern Himalayas the species can be confused with the lesser racket-tailed drongo, however the latter has flat rackets with the crest nearly absent.

This widespread species includes populations that have distinct variations and several subspecies have been named. The nominate form is found in southern India, mainly in forested areas of the Western Ghats and the adjoining hill forests of peninsular India. The subspecies in Sri Lanka is &quot;ceylonicus&quot; and is similar to the nominate form but slightly smaller. The subspecies found along the Himalayas is &quot;grandis&quot; and is the largest and has long glossy neck hackles. The Andaman Islands form &quot;otiosus&quot; has shorter neck hackles and the crest is highly reduced while the Nicobars Island form &quot;nicobariensis&quot; has a longer frontal crest and with smaller neck hackles than &quot;otiosus&quot;. The Sri Lanka drongo (&quot;D. lophorinus&quot;) used to be treated as a subspecies as it was believed to form hybrids with &quot;ceylonicus&quot; but is now considered a separate species on the basis of their overlapping ranges. Specimens of the nominate form have sometimes been confused with the Sri Lanka drongo. Considerable variation in shape of the bill, extent of the crest, hackles and tail rackets exists in the island populations of Southeast Asia. The Bornean &quot;brachyphorus&quot; (=&quot;insularis&quot;), &quot;banguey&quot; of Banggai lack crests (&quot;banguey&quot; has frontal feathers that arch forwards) while very reduced crests are found in &quot;microlophus&quot; (=&quot;endomychus&quot;; Natunas, Anambas and Tiomans) and &quot;platurus&quot; (Sumatra). A number of forms are known along the Southeast Asian islands and mainland including &quot;formosus&quot; (Java), &quot;hypoballus&quot; (Thailand), &quot;rangoonensis&quot; (northern Burma, central Indian populations were earlier included in this) and &quot;johni &quot; (Hainan).

Young birds are duller, and can lack a crest while moulting birds can lack the elongate tail streamers. The racket is formed by the inner web of the vane but appears to be on the outer web since the rachis has a twist just above the &quot;spatula&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
The distribution range of this species extends from the western Himalayas to the eastern Himalayas and Mishmi Hills in the foothills below . They are found in the hills of peninsular India and the Western Ghats. Continuing into the west to the islands of Borneo and Java in the east through the mainland and islands.

==Behaviour and ecology==

Like other drongos, these feed mainly on insects but also eat fruit and visit flowering trees for nectar. Having short legs, they sit upright and are often perched on high and exposed branches. They are aggressive and will sometimes mob larger birds especially when nesting. They are often active at dusk.

 Their calls are extremely varied and include monotonously repeated whistles, metallic and nasal sounds as well as more complex notes and imitations of other birds. They begin calling from as early as 4 am in moonlight often with a metallic &quot;tunk-tunk-tunk&quot; series. They have an ability to accurately mimic alarm calls of other birds that are learnt through interactions in mixed-species flocks. This is quite unusual, as avian vocal mimicry has hitherto been believed to be ignorant of the original context of the imitated vocalization. Grey parrots are known to use imitated human speech in correct context, but do not show this behavior in nature. This drongo&#x27;s context-sensitive use of other species&#x27; alarm calls is thus analogous to a human learning useful short phrases and exclamations in a number of foreign languages. A special alarm note is raised in the presence of shikras that has been transcribed as a loud &quot;kwei-kwei-kwei...shee-cuckoo-sheecuckoo-sheecuckoo-why!&quot;. They have been said to imitate raptor calls so as to alarm other birds and steal prey from them in the ensuing panic. They are also known to imitate the calls of species (and possibly even behaviour as it was once recorded to fluff up and moving head and body like a jungle babbler when imitating its calls) that typically are members of mixed-species flocks such as babblers and it has been suggested that this has a role in the formation of mixed-species flocks. In some places they have been found to be kleptoparasitic on others in mixed-species flock, particularly laughingthrushes but they are most often involved in mutualistic and commensal relations. Several observers have found this drongo associating with foraging woodpeckers and there is a report of one following a troop of macaques.

The greater racket-tailed drongo is a resident breeder throughout its range. The breeding season in India is April to August. Their courtship display may involve hops and turns on branches with play behaviour involving dropping an object and picking it in mid air. Their cup nest is built in the fork of a tree, often a smooth-boled tree with an isolated canopy, The nesting pair may even remove bits of bark on the trunk to make it smooth. The usual clutch is three to four eggs. The eggs are creamy white with blotches of reddish brown which are more dense at the broad end.

==In culture==
The common whistle note that is made leads to its local name in many parts of India of &quot;kothwal&quot; (which means a &quot;policeman&quot; or &quot;guard&quot;, who used a whistle that produced a similar note), a name also applied to the black drongo and in other places as the &quot;Bhimraj&quot; or &quot;Bhringaraj&quot;. In Mizo language of northeast India, it is called &quot; Vakul&quot; and the Mizo people use the tail feathers in ceremonies. Prior to the 1950s it was often kept in captivity by people in parts of India. It was said to be very hardy and like a crow, accommodating a varied diet. Edward H. Schafer considered the greater racket-tailed drongo as the basis for the divine &quot;kalaviṅka&quot; birds mentioned in Chinese and Japanese Buddhist texts.

<doc id="664865" wikidata="Q2915101" url="?curid=664865" title="Kenites">
<text>According to the Hebrew Bible, the Kenites/Qenites ( or ; ) were a tribe in the ancient Levant. They settled in the towns and cities in the northeastern Negev in an area known as the &quot;Negev of the Kenites&quot; near Arad, and played an important role in the history of ancient Israel. One of the most recognized Kenites is Jethro, Moses&#x27;s father-in-law, who was a shepherd and a priest in the land of Midian (). Certain groups of Kenites settled among the Israelite population, including the descendants of Moses&#x27;s brother-in-law, although the Kenites descended from Rechab maintained a distinct, nomadic lifestyle for some time.

Other well-known Kenites were Heber, husband of Jael, the Biblical heroine who killed General Sisera and Rechab, the ancestor of the Rechabites.

== Etymology==

The word &quot;qēni&quot; () was a patronymic derived from the word &quot;qayin&quot; (). There are several competing etymologies.

According to the German Orientalist Wilhelm Gesenius, the name is derived from the name Cain, the same name as Cain, the son of Adam and Eve. However this may simply be the ancient Hebrew transliteration or phonetization of the Kenites&#x27; name in their own language.

The word &quot;qayin&quot; could also mean a spear or lance, derived from . &quot;Qonēn&quot; would also be used to mean striking a note on a musical instrument, by the later books of the Bible this word became the noun for a type of lament, dirge, or sad chant, later meaning to chant or wail at a funeral)

Other scholars have linked the name to the term &quot;smith&quot;. According to Archibald Henry Sayce, the name Kenite is identical to an Aramaic word meaning a smith, which in its turn is a cognate of Hebrew &quot;qayin&quot; &quot;lance&quot;. However, by the end of his life, Sayce was considered an amateur rather than a specialist and was criticized for his lack of intellectual penetration and outdated opposition to the work of continental orientalists.

==Historical identity==

The Kenites are a clan mentioned in the Bible as having settled on the southern border of the Kingdom of Judah. In I Samuel 30:29, in the time of David, the Kenites settled among the tribe of Judah.

In Jeremiah 35:7-8 the Rechabites are described as tent-dwellers with an absolute prohibition against practicing agriculture; however, other Kenites are described elsewhere as city-dwellers (, ).

Hippolytus of Rome in his &quot;Chronicon&quot; of 234 appears to identify the Kinaidokolpitai of central Arabia with the biblical Kenites.

In modern sources the Kenites are often depicted as technologically advanced nomadic blacksmiths who spread their culture and religion to Canaan. The suggestion that the Kenites were wandering smiths was first made by B. D. Stade in &quot;Beiträge zur Pentateuchkritik: dasKainszeichen&quot; in 1894 and has since become widespread. This view of the Kenites originated in Germany in the mid-1800s, and it is not reflected in any ancient Hebrew, Greek, Latin, or Arabic sources.

In 1988, Meindert Dijkstra argued that an ancient inscription in a metal mine in the Sinai Peninsula contained a reference to &quot;a chief of the Kenites&quot; (&quot;rb bn qn&quot;).

==In the Bible==


=== Age of the Patriarchs ===
Genesis 15:18-21 mentions the Kenites as living in or around Canaan as early as the time of Abraham.

=== During the Exodus ===
Moses&#x27;s father-in-law, Jethro, was a Kenite () and a resident in the land of Midian. At the Exodus, Jethro and his clan inhabited the vicinity of Mount Sinai and Mount Horeb. ()
In Jethro is said to have been a &quot;priest in the land of Midian&quot; and a resident of Midian (). This has led many scholars to believe that the terms &quot;Kenite&quot; and &quot;Midianite&quot; are intended (at least in parts of the Bible) to be used interchangeably, or that the Kenites formed a part of the Midianite tribal grouping.

The Kenites journeyed with the Israelites to Canaan (); and their encampment, apart from the latter&#x27;s, was noticed by Balaam.

The Kenites were closely allied with Moses, and are not mentioned to have participated in the first invasion of Canaan (, ) that was conducted against Moses&#x27;s orders.

During the second invasion of Canaan (), the Kenites would have seen the area around the town of Arad, the region of Canaan that the next generation of Kenites would later choose as their place to settle after the conquest.

When the Israelites and Kenites were camped at the foot of Mount Peor, King Balak of Moab allied himself with the five Kings of Midian, but seeing that they did not have the strength to defeat the Israelites, the leaders of Moab and Midian gathered together and paid a large fee to Balaam to put a curse on the Israelite camp from the high place (a type of religious shrine) on Mount Peor (). Balaam was unable to curse Israel, but prophesied about the Kenites, saying that they would endure, but foretold that someday they would be led away captive as slaves to Assur, (), with the question of how long their future slavery would last being unanswered.

=== War between Israel and Midian ===
While the camp was still encamped on the west side of Mount Peor, the local Moabites attempted to include the Israelites in their worship of their god Baal of Peor. During the commotion and bloodshed, Moses&#x27;s grandnephew Phinehas killed a Midianite princess, Cozbi, the daughter of King Zur, one of the five Kings of Midian (). Following this, Moses sent a strikeforce of 12,000 men (1000 from each Israelite tribe, the Kenites were not included) that succeed in killing the five kings Evi (אֱוִי), Rekem (רֶקֶם), Hur (חוּר), Reba (רֶבַע), and Zur (צַוָּר) the father of Cozbi, (, ) and burned each of the Midianite cities and all of their encampments, taking their livestock (). The Kenites were not included in the invasion of Midian, it is unclear how the Kenites reacted to the fall of the Midianite kings that they had formerly been subject to.

=== During the Conquest of Canaan ===

After the death of Moses, Joshua led the Israelite invasion of Canaan; conquering a large portion of central Canaan. Upon Joshua&#x27;s death, the Israelite tribes of Judah and Simeon took action to conquer southern Canaan, defeating the Canaanites and the Perizzites at the Battle of Bezek (now Ibziq) in . After Judah&#x27;s sieges of Jerusalem and Debir, says that Jethro&#x27;s Kenite descendants &quot;went up from the City of Palms, (which appears to be Zoar or Tamar in the upper Arabah), with the men of Judah to live among the people of the Desert of Judah in the Negev near Arad.&quot;

=== After settling in Canaan ===
Following the conquest, the Israelites began to assimilate into the larger Canaanite culture and started converting to the Canaanite religion (, ), only returning to their national religion when confronted by an 8-year invasion and occupation by the North Mesopotamians (from Aram-Naharaim) under King Cushan-Rishathaim. The Israelites rose up under the leadership of Othniel the son of Kenaz, (thus the nephew of Caleb, Judah&#x27;s previous war-leader) who was a neighbor of the Kenites and lived in the same area (). Although the text is brief, it is likely Othniel had reliable political support at-the-ready from his relatives the Calebites and Kenizzites, and probably from his Kenite neighbors as well, this likely gave him a large support base for the tribe of Judah to unite around.
Later, King Eglon of Moab allied with the Kingdom of Ammon and nation of Amalek, in order to invade the territory of Israel. () After defeating the Israelites, Moab and Amalek took the City of Palms (believed to be the later city of Zoar or Tamar), from the Kenites.

=== During the rise and fall of Hazor ===

At this point, around 180 or 190 years after Joshua&#x27;s invasion, the Canaanites in northern Canaan under King Jabin ruling from Hazor re-asserted their dominance over Canaan (). The Israelite leader Shamgar appears to have been battling with the Philistines in south Canaan at the time, and was either caught off-guard, or unable to prevent the rising Canaanite military, economic, and political power. (Non-biblical sources depict the King of Hazor affirming loyalty to the Egyptian pharaoh, and joining the cities of Qatna and Mari to create a trade route that linked Egypt to Ekallatum)

During this period, Heber the Kenite and his wife Jael separated from their Kenite brethren in the south, and went to live in northern Canaan ().

After two decades of North Canaanite dominance in the region, the prophetess Deborah, who was now leading Israel, commissioned Barak the son of Abinoam as her commander to lead the Israelites against the Canaanites. () King Jabin&#x27;s general Sisera learned that Barak was massing troops on Mount Tabor, situated between Sisera&#x27;s base at Harosheth Haggoyim (believed to now be Ahwat) and the Canaanite capital at Hazor, and set out northward to meet him with 900 chariots. The weather became unfavorable to Sisera&#x27;s army, the sky became clouded (), and the river that his chariots needed to cross was flooded. While Sisera attempted to ford his chariots through the torrential Kishon River at a river crossing close to the then-Canaanite city of Taanach (Now known as Ti&#x27;inik) near Megiddo (), Barak&#x27;s 10,000 men went down southwestward from Mount Tabor () to give battle on the plain and rivers. Sisera left his chariot behind and escaped the battle on foot, while Barak pursued the chariots that were fleeing back to the Canaanite base at Harosheth Haggoyim ()

As Sisera fled on foot near Kedesh-Naphtali, he was passing by the tent of Heber the Kenite, and Jael offered to shelter him. Accepting her offer, he asked her to stand in the doorway of the tent, and to deny his presence to anyone who was chasing him. However, once he was asleep, Jael hammered a tent peg into Sisera&#x27;s head, and he died. (, )

From that point onwards, Israel grew stronger and continued to press Hazor harder, until King Jabin&#x27;s defeat. ()

=== In the early Israelite Monarchy ===

In the time of King Saul there were Kenites living in Amalek territory. When King Saul of Israel went to war against Amalek, the kindness which the Kenites had shown to Israel in the wilderness was gratefully remembered. &quot;Ye showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt,&quot; said Saul to them (); and so not only were they spared by King Saul, but later in the war David also sent a share of the spoil that he took from the Amalekites to the civic elders of the cities of the Kenites. ()

In King Rehoboam&#x27;s fifth year the Negev, including the Negev of the Kenites, was briefly occupied by the Egyptians during Pharaoh Shishak&#x27;s (Shoshenq I) campaign into southern Palestine mentioned in and . The fortifications of Arad and &quot;Great&quot; Arad are listed on Row VIII of the Bubastite Portal as falling to Shoshenq after Shaaraim and before Yeruham. 

While the Kenite territory in the Negev had earlier been seen as a separate territory from the parts of the Negev held by Judah and the Simeonites, as the Israelites grew in power, the Negev would be mentioned in the later histories as a single region and integral part of the Kingdom of Judah.

In the northern Negev, the city of Arad served as a key administrative and military stronghold for the Kingdom of Judah. It protected the route from the Judaean Mountains to the Arabah and on to Moab and Edom. It underwent numerous renovations and extensions.

==Archeology==

The Kenites have been proposed as a reason for the appearance of Midianite pottery imported into the Negev of the Kenites during the 1200s and 1100s BC. Petrographic studies carried out on some of the Timna wares led to the conclusion that they originated in the Hejaz, most probably in the site of Qurayya in Saudi Arabia.

J. Gunneweg analyzed pottery samples with the help of The Hebrew University and the University of Bonn in 1991. The Midianite pottery found in the Negev was linked to a kiln discovered at Qurayya, Saudi Arabia, through Neutron Activation Analysis.

Excavations at the site of Horvat Uza, and in a ostraca from Arad, seem to indicate the presence of Kenite groups in the Negev in monarchic Judah. Israeli historian Nadav Na&#x27;aman argues that the absence of anthropomorphic and other figurines at the site points to the Kenite settlers practicing aniconism.

The upper and lower areas of Tel Arad were excavated during 18 seasons by Ruth Amiran and Yohanan Aharoni between 1962 and 1984. An additional 8 seasons were done on the Iron Age water system.

==Critical scholarship==

=== Kenite Hypothesis ===
According to the Kenite hypothesis proposed by the German writer Friedrich Wilhelm Ghillany, Yahweh was historically a Midian deity, and the association of Moses&#x27;s father-in-law with Midian reflects the historical adoption of the Midianite cult by the Hebrews. Moses apparently identified Jethro&#x27;s concept of a god, Yahweh, with the Israelites&#x27; god El Shaddai. 
The Kenite hypothesis supposes that the Hebrews adopted the cult of Yahweh from the Midianites via the Kenites. This view, first proposed by Friedrich Wilhelm Ghillany in 1862, afterward independently by the Dutch scholar of religion Cornelis Tiele in 1872, and more fully by the German critical scholar Bernhard Stade, has been more completely worked out by the German theologian Karl Budde; it is accepted by the German Semitic scholar Hermann Guthe, Gerrit Wildeboer, H. P. Smith, and George Aaron Barton. Another theory is that a confederation of regional tribes were connected to monotheistic ritual at Sinai.

===Links to the mythology of Cain===

Some biblical scholars postulated that the Kenites were descendants of the mythical Cain. The German orientalist Wilhelm Gesenius asserted that the name is kabbalistically (mystically) derived from the name Cain (קַיִן &quot;Qayin&quot;).

The German orientalist Walter Beltz alternatively proposed that the story of Cain and Abel was not originally about the murder of a brother, but a myth about the murder of a god&#x27;s child. In his reading of Genesis 4:1, Eve conceived Cain by Adam, and her second son Abel by another man, this being Yahweh. Eve is thus compared to the Sacred Queen of antiquity, the Mother goddess. Consequently, Yahweh pays heed to Abel&#x27;s offerings, but not to Cain&#x27;s. After Cain kills Abel, Yahweh condemns Cain, the murderer of his son, to the cruelest punishment imaginable among humans: banishment.

Beltz believed this to be the foundational myth of the Kenites, a clan settled on the southern border of Judah that eventually resettled among the tribes of Judah. It seemed clear to him that the purpose of this myth was to explain the difference between the nomadic and sedentary populations of Judah, with those living from their livestock (pastoralists, not raising crops) under the special protection of Yahweh.

Ronald Hendel believes the Israelites linked the Kenites to Cain to give them a &quot;shameful, violent ancestral origin&quot;.

===Kenites as metalworkers===
According to the critical interpretation of the Biblical data, the Kenites were a clan settled on the southern border of Judah, originally characterized by a semi-nomadic lifestyle and involved in the copper industry in the Aravah region.

In the 1899 &quot;Hastings&#x27; Dictionary of the Bible&quot;, Archibald Sayce suggested that the Kenites were a tribe of smiths. Based on the biblical references, proposed etymological linkage of the name &#x27;Kenite&#x27; to blacksmithing and other evidence, various scholars have associated the Kenites with coppersmithery and metalwork.

<text>Mor Ignatius Zakka I Iwas (; ; &#x27;, bornSanharib Iwas, 21 April 1931 – 21 March 2014) was the 122nd reigning [[Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch and All the East]] and, as such, Supreme Head of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Universal Syriac Orthodox Church]]. Also known by his traditional episcopal name,Severios, he was enthroned as patriarch on 14 September 1980 in St. George&#x27;s Patriarchal Cathedral in Damascus. He succeeded Ignatius Ya`qub III. As is traditional for the head of the church, Mor Severios adopted the name Ignatius.

Zakka was known for his involvement in ecumenical dialogue. He was a president of the World Council of Churches and also a prolific author. He was an observer at Second Vatican Council before becoming metropolitan bishop of Mosul. At the time of his election as patriarch, Mor Severios Zakka was serving as the archbishop of Baghdad and Basra. As patriarch, he established a monastic seminary, met with Pope John Paul II during the Roman Pope&#x27;s visit to Syria in 2001, and installed numerous metropolitans, including Baselios Thomas I as Catholicos of India. He celebrated his Silver Jubilee in 2005.

Iwas was admitted to a hospital in Germany for angioplasty on 20 February 2014 and died on 21 March 2014.

==Early life and education==
Sanharib Iwas was born on 21 April 1931 in Mosul, Iraq. His parents named him after Sennacherib, the father of St. Behnam. He completed his elementary studies at the school of Our Lady&#x27;s Parish and was transferred to St. Thomas Syriac Orthodox Church School, both in Mosul. In 1946, he began his theological studies in the city&#x27;s Mor Ephrem seminary. At the seminary, his birth name was replaced by the name Zakka. There, in 1948, he was ordained as a deacon with the rank of Reader. In the year 1953, he was promoted to the rank of subdeacon. The following year saw Iwas take monastic vows. He left Mosul at that time to become secretary to the patriarchs, Ignatius Aphrem I Barsoum and then Ignatius Jacob III. In 1955 he was promoted to the rank of full deacon.

On 17 November 1957, Patriarch Ya`qub III ordained Deacon Zakka a priest and, two years later, gave him the pectoral cross as rabban. In 1960, he pursued further study in New York City. There, he studied oriental languages and completed a master&#x27;s degree in English at the City University and a further master&#x27;s in pastoral theology at the General Theological Seminary.

==Metropolitan bishop==
In 1962 and 1963, Rabban Zakka was delegated by the patriarch as an observer at Second Vatican Council. On 17 November 1963, he was consecrated metropolitan bishop by Patriarch Ya&#x27;qub with the name Mor Severios Zakka. The next year, during renovation work on the sanctuary wall of the metropolitan church in Mosul, what were reputed to be the remains of the Apostle Thomas were found. In 1969, Mor Severios transferred to be archbishop of Baghdad and Basra. Nine years later, he was given additional responsibility for the new diocese of Australia.

==Patriarch of Syriac Orthodox Church==

Following the death of Patriarch Ya`qub III on 25 June 1980, Mor Severios Zakka was elected by the synod of the church to succeed him the 122nd Syriac Patriarch of Antioch. He was enthroned as patriarch on 14 September, the day of the feast of the Cross, by Mor Baselios Paulose (Paul) II, Catholicos of the East, at St. George&#x27;s Patriarchal Cathedral in Damascus, Syria. As is traditional for the head of the church, he adopted the name Ignatius at this time. Being the first patriarch to be named Zakka, his name is often written as Ignatius Zakka I Iwas. His full titulary is:
:transliteration: Qaddîšûṯeh Îgnaṭyûs Zakkay Qaḏmoyo ʿÎwaṣ, Paṭryarḵo d-Anṭyuḵya
:, Patriarch of Antioch

Patriarch Zakka, was involved in ecumenical dialogue and served as the president of the World Council of Churches. Due to his efforts, the Chalcedonian schism is not seen to have great relevance any more and, from dialogue with the Roman pope, a reconciling declaration emerged that stated, in part:

Zakka was a member of different Eastern and Western Academies and authored a number of books on Christian education, theology, history, and culture in Syriac and the Arabic and English languages. He established a monastic seminary, the Monastery of St. Ephrem The Syrian, at Marrat Saidnaya. Inaugurated on 14 September 1996, this Monastery forms part of a larger project which will include different centers and facilities. During the visit of Pope John Paul II to Syria in 2001, the Pope paid a historic visit to Patriarch Zakka in Damascus. The meeting took place on 6 May in St. George&#x27;s Patriarchal Cathedral at Bab Touma. The following year, Iwas installed Mor Dionysius Thomas, the president of the Episcopal Synod of Indian Church, as the Catholicos of India with the title Mor Baselios Thomas I. Celebrations were held for the Patriarch&#x27;s Silver Jubilee on 14 September 2005.

===Pastoral visits===
Ignatius Zakka made a number of pastoral visits outside Syria, mainly to India where the bulk of Syriac Orthodox Christians reside and Europe, home of the growing Syriac Orthodox diaspora.
His first pastoral visit was to India was to Kerala from 3 February to 27 March 1982, during which he met with Indian officials and heads of various Indian churches.
A second visit to India was in April 2000 to attend the Golden Jubilee of the Chief Metropolitan of the East Mor Cleemis Abraham, it lasted three days. The third visit to India came for the occasion of the 25th anniversary celebrations of the Patriarchal enthronement in September 2004, the third visit lasted two weeks. The fourth and last visit was in 2008 for the 80th Birthday celebration of Catholicos Mor Baselios Thomas I which also lasted two weeks.

==Episcopal succession==
During Ignatius Zakka time as Patriarch and Metropolitan, he had the duty to ordain and consecrate many Metropolitans in the Syria Orthodox church in addition to hundreds of priests, monks, and deacons. The list includes one future patriarch also.

# Cyril Aphrem Karim (1995-2014). Metropolitan of the Eastern United States. Later, he was elected as Ignatius Aphrem II, the 123rd Patriarch of Syriac Orthodox Church (2014-Present).

==Death==
Zakka was admitted to hospital in Kiel, Germany on 20 February 2014; where he died following a cardiac arrest on 21 March 2014. He was entombed at St. Peter&#x27;s and St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, Marrat Saidnayya, Damascus on 28 March.

On 29 May 2014, Mor Ignatius Aphrem II, succeeded him as Patriarch.

<doc id="664877" wikidata="Q461383" url="?curid=664877" title="Brian Talboys">
<text>Sir Brian Edward Talboys (7 June 1921 – 3 June 2012) was a New Zealand politician who served as the seventh deputy prime minister of New Zealand for the first two terms of Robert Muldoon&#x27;s premiership. If the abortive &quot;Colonels&#x27; Coup&quot; against Muldoon had been successful, Talboys would have become Prime Minister himself.

==Early life==
Talboys was born in Wanganui on 7 June 1921. He attended primary school in Wanganui and Wanganui Collegiate School, but then travelled to Canada to study at the University of Manitoba. He later returned to New Zealand and studied at Victoria University of Wellington, gaining a BA. For the next few years, he worked for a stock and station agents&#x27; company, and then gained a position as assistant editor of a farming newspaper. In World War II, Talboys served in the Royal New Zealand Air Force. After the war, Talboys settled in Southland as a farmer.

==Early political career==




In the 1957 election, Talboys contested the Wallace electorate as the National Party candidate. He was successful, defeating a Labour Party challenger to succeed retiring National MP Tom Macdonald. He held the Wallace electorate for his entire parliamentary career, usually gaining an outright majority. Talboys made a good impression early on as an opposition MP with National&#x27;s deputy leader Jack Marshall and Labour Prime Minister Walter Nash thinking of him as a future Prime Minister.

At the formation of the Second National Government Talboys was appointed as an under-secretary to the Minister of Industries and Commerce. In 1961 he was one of ten National MPs to vote with the Opposition and remove capital punishment for murder from the Crimes Bill that the National government had introduced.

In 1962, Talboys was elevated to Cabinet, becoming Minister of Agriculture following the death of Thomas Hayman. At the end of 1963, he gained the additional role of Minister of Science. In 1969, he dropped the agriculture portfolio, and became Minister of Education instead. For most of 1972, he was Minister of Industries and Commerce, and Minister of Overseas Trade. He was also briefly Minister of Trade and Industry (which replaced the Industries and Commerce portfolio) towards the end of 1972, but National&#x27;s loss of the 1972 election ended all his ministerial roles and put him into Opposition.

In 1974, Talboys was elected deputy leader of the National Party following Robert Muldoon&#x27;s challenge to Jack Marshall. Talboys replaced Muldoon who had been deputy leader. While National was in opposition he was also Shadow Minister of National Development.

When National won the 1975 election, Talboys became Deputy Prime Minister. He also became Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Overseas Trade and Minister of National Development.

During the Third National Government he negotiated New Zealand&#x27;s continued product access to the United Kingdom when it joined the European Economic Community. He was also involved in creating the Closer Economic Relations agreement with Australia to improve trans-Tasman trading cooperation. Recognising the importance of growing economies in Asia he worked to open up their markets to New Zealand producers.

==Colonels&#x27; Coup==

In 1980, unhappiness was growing in the National Party about the leadership style of Robert Muldoon, who was seen as increasingly confrontational and dictatorial. This dissatisfaction culminated in the so-called &quot;Colonels&#x27; Coup&quot;, an attempt by certain members of the party to depose Muldoon and install Talboys as leader instead. The dissidents were led by the three most prominent of Muldoon&#x27;s younger ministers: Jim McLay, Jim Bolger, and Derek Quigley. A number of people were considered as possible replacements, including George Gair and the three &quot;colonels&quot; themselves, but it was eventually decided that Talboys was the only credible challenger, each of the others having been deemed unacceptable by at least one faction of the party. Talboys had been performing well as Acting Prime Minister during Muldoon&#x27;s absence overseas, and was seen (unlike Muldoon) to be likable and diplomatic.

The largest problem for the plotters was the hesitance of Talboys himself. Talboys, while not particularly supportive of Muldoon&#x27;s leadership style, refused to actively campaign against his party&#x27;s leader, and would only make a move if it could be shown beforehand that a majority of the party supported it. While Talboys was willing to accept a leadership change if his colleagues deemed it necessary, he was not willing to actually seek Muldoon&#x27;s removal himself. Despite Talboys&#x27;s reluctance, his backers managed to gain a slim majority in caucus in favour of a leadership change. When Muldoon returned to New Zealand, however, he quickly launched a counter-attack, and managed to tip the balance of caucus opinion back towards himself. When the possibility for a leadership vote arrived, Talboys refused to challenge, believing that an open dispute would do huge damage to the party as a whole. No vote was taken, Muldoon remained leader and Talboys remained deputy leader.

Former National leader Jack Marshall, who was also critical of Muldoon&#x27;s leadership style, thought Talboys would have been a good Prime Minister if he &quot;had a little more steel in his backbone.&quot;

==Later life==
Talboys retired from Parliament at the 1981 election, a year after the abortive leadership challenge. He went on to hold a number of positions in the business world, and served as the first chairman of the Pacific Democratic Union from 1984 to 1985.

He died in 2012 at the age of 90 at his rest home in Invercargill, just a few days short of his 91st birthday. He was survived by his wife and their two children. Patricia, Lady Talboys, died in 2019.

==Honours and awards==
In 1977, Talboys was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal, and in 1990 he received the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. He was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour after he stepped down as deputy prime minister in 1981, an Honorary Companion of the Order of Australia, for service to Australia/New Zealand relations, in the 1982 Australia Day Honours, and Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, for public services, in the 1991 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours.

<text>Philips Saeco S.p.A., or short Saeco, is an Italian manufacturer of manual, super-automatic and capsule espresso machines and other electrical goods with headquarters and factories in Gaggio Montano near Bologna.

==History==
The company was founded by Sergio Zappella and Arthur Schmed in 1981 as Sergio, Arthur e Compagnia.

In 1985, they launched the first completely automatic espresso machine for domestic use, called Superautomatica and in 1999 they bought the historic espresso brand of Gaggia.

In May 2009, the company board agreed to a purchase offer from Dutch manufacturer Philips, owner of the Senseo coffee system, subject to shareholder and bank approval.

Other relevant contributions to the technology used in espresso machines include the cappuccinatore (introduced in 1996) as well as the automatic brewing pressure adaptation &quot;SBS&quot; (1999) and most recently, the announcement of the bluetooth-enabled GranBaristo Avanti (2013).

The Saeco brand belongs to the Dutch electronics company Philips since July 2009.
In 2017, Philips sold the Saeco Professional division (also with the Gaggia brand) to N&amp;W Global Vending SpA, an Italian Bergamo based company leader in vending machines for drinks and snacks, born in 2000 from the integration of Necta and Wittenberg and controlled by a US fund, Lone Star. The production of professional coffee machines is carried out in the historical site of Gaggio Montano near Bologna. The domestic coffee machine division remains in the Philips group. In November 2017 N&amp;W changed its name to Evoca Group.

<doc id="664884" wikidata="Q3901730" url="?curid=664884" title="Phyllis George">
<text>Phyllis Ann George (June 25, 1949 – May 14, 2020) was an American businesswoman, actress, and sportscaster. In 1975, George was hired as a reporter and co-host of the CBS Sports pre-show &quot;The NFL Today&quot;, becoming one of the first women to hold an on-air position in national televised sports broadcasting. She also served as the First Lady of Kentucky from 1979 to 1983.

She won Miss Texas in 1970 and was crowned Miss America 1971.

==Early life==
George was born to Diantha Louise George (née Cogdell; 1919–2003) and James Robert George (1918–1996) in Denton, Texas. She attended North Texas State University (now University of North Texas) for three years until she was crowned Miss Texas in 1970. At that time, Texas Christian University awarded scholarships to Miss Texas honorees. As a result, George left North Texas and enrolled at TCU until winning the Miss America crown later that fall. She was a member of the Zeta Tau Alpha sorority.

==Pageantry==
George first competed for Miss Texas as Miss Denton in 1969, finishing fourth. The next year she competed as Miss Dallas and was named Miss Texas 1970, then was crowned Miss America 1971 on September 12, 1970. The Women&#x27;s Liberation Front demonstrated at the event.

In August 1971, George traveled to Vietnam with Miss Iowa Cheryl Browne; Miss Nevada 1970 Vicky Jo Todd; Miss New Jersey 1970 Hela Yungst; Miss Arizona 1970 Karen Shields; Miss Arkansas 1970 Donna Connelly; and George&#x27;s replacement after she was crowned Miss America Miss Texas 1970 Belinda Myrick. They participated in a 22-day United Service Organizations tour for American troops there. During her year-long stint as Miss America, George appeared on numerous talk shows, including three interviews on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;.

==Career==

George&#x27;s television career began in 1974 as a co-host on the comedy show &quot;Candid Camera&quot;.

===CBS Sports===
CBS Sports producers approached George to become a sportscaster in 1974. The following year, she joined the cast of &quot;The NFL Today&quot;, co-hosting live pregame shows before National Football League games. She was one of the first women to have a nationally prominent role in television sports coverage. As a former beauty queen with a limited television background, she was criticized for not possessing the traditional qualifications for a sportscaster. After three seasons on &quot;The NFL Today&quot;, she was replaced by another beauty queen, Jayne Kennedy. George returned to the show in 1980 and remained until 1984. She became known for her interviews with athletes. Hannah Storm, an anchor at ESPN&#x27;s &quot;SportsCenter&quot;, called George &quot;a true trailblazer&quot; for being an inspirational role model for women who wanted to pursue careers in sportscasting. She also worked on horse racing events, including the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes.

===&quot;CBS Morning News&quot;===

In 1985, CBS settled on Phyllis George to serve as a permanent anchor for its morning news program. George was given a three-year contract following a two-week trial run. As co-anchor, she interviewed newsmakers including then–First Lady Nancy Reagan.

A low point of her eight-month stint on &quot;The CBS Morning News&quot; happened when George embarrassed herself during a May 1985 interview with Gary Dotson and Cathleen Webb. Dotson just had been freed after six years in prison on a rape charge after Webb recanted her claim that he was the assailant, admitting to making the accusation after discovering she had become pregnant through consensual sex with her boyfriend, fearful that her foster parents would kick her out of their home. Both appeared on the CBS program as part of (as George later told Tom Shales of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;) a Webb-Dotson press tour &quot;charade.&quot; Both were on or had appeared on NBC News and ABC News as well as other media outlets. As the segment began to wrap, George first suggested the two shake hands. After a brief hesitation from them and no hand shake, George then proposed they &quot;hug it out.&quot; A brief moment of awkwardness followed but no hug. The invitation to embrace was deemed highly inappropriate prompting a few phone calls from irate CBS viewers. George also was criticized in the press.

According to news reports at the time, George had been brought in to boost the ratings of the perennial third place ranked program. CBS News staffers were mystified as to why someone with little to no journalism experience was picked over a more qualified candidate from the CBS News roster of reporters and anchors. George had been a talent for the sports division, but had not worked in news. However, this experiment failed to work out, and George was ousted just a few months later. Maria Shriver, then a CBS News employee, took her place as part of another revamp of the program.

===Other Television===
George had a brief stint on a television news version of &quot;People&quot; magazine in 1978, and a job as a morning television talk show host as co-anchor of the &quot;CBS Morning News&quot; in 1985. She also hosted her own prime-time talk show on The Nashville Network, 1994&#x27;s &quot;A Phyllis George Special&quot;, on which she interviewed then-President Bill Clinton, and a 1998 talk show titled &quot;Women&#x27;s Day&quot; on the cable network PAX. George also appeared as a guest on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; in 1979.

===Business interests===

George founded two companies in the course of her business career, the first of which was &quot;Chicken by George&quot; chicken fillets. In 1988 after operating for only two years, George sold the company to Hormel Foods, which agreed to operate it as a separate division. In 1991, George received the &quot;Celebrity Women Business Owner of the Year&quot; from the National Association of Women Business Owners.

She also wrote or co-authored five books—three about crafts, one on dieting (her first book, &quot;The I Love America Diet&quot;, published in 1982), and the final one published during her lifetime, &quot;Never Say Never&quot; (2002).

George was the founder of the Kentucky Museum of Art and Craft, and was an avid folk and traditional arts collector. She was also a founding member of the Henry Clay Center for Statesmanship.

George resurfaced in 2000 when she played a minor character in &quot;Meet the Parents&quot;. It was one of her very few film roles.

==Personal life and death==

George was married twice. Her first marriage was to Hollywood producer Robert Evans (wed in 1977 and divorced in 1978), and her second to Kentucky Fried Chicken owner and governor of Kentucky John Y. Brown Jr (wed in 1979 and divorced in 1998). George served as Kentucky&#x27;s First Lady during Brown&#x27;s term in office. During her marriage to Brown, she had two children, Lincoln Tyler George Brown and Pamela Ashley Brown. Like Phyllis, Pamela would also become a journalist, even landing various anchor and correspondent positions at CNN after joining the network in 2021. She is sometimes quoted for the words &quot;Life is what you make it. My old expression is, `If you snooze, you lose; if you snore, you lose more&quot;.

George died of complications from polycythemia vera, a rare blood cancer, on May 14, 2020, aged 70, at the Albert B. Chandler Hospital in Lexington, Kentucky.

<text>The Canadian Securities Institute (CSI; formerly, CSI Global Education) is a Canadian organization that offers licensing courses, advanced certifications, continuing education and custom training for financial services professionals in Canada and internationally.

CSI provides licensing and testing to meet the regulatory requirements to work within the Canadian financial services industry. It is endorsed by the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC), and Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA).

CSI is based in Toronto and Montreal and owned by Moody&#x27;s Analytics. The credentials offered by the institute are recognized by several foreign securities regulators, including those in the U.S., France, U.K., Singapore and Hong Kong.

==Courses, programs and certificates==
The Canadian Securities Institute offers 100 courses, 11 certificate programs, specialized designations, as well as continuing education programs for Canadian financial professionals, primarily in the area of financial advice.

The Canadian Securities Course is widely viewed by Canada&#x27;s financial services sector as the de facto entry requirement for many careers of its paths. First offered in 1964, it has remained an exclusive part of the proficiency requirement to be registered as an investment advisor with an IIROC member firm. The CSC is recognized as a requirement for mutual fund representatives and exempt market dealer representatives. CSI also provides a simplified version for motivated investors who wish to increase their financial literacy/knowledge but do not plan a career as stockbrokers.

CSI offers programs and courses through a variety of formats including distance (primarily online) and in class, to make them as accessible as possible. Some courses are available through Ontario community colleges (e.g., Fanshawe College in London, Ontario and Centennial College in Toronto). The PFP may be applied to an MBA (Financial Services) at Dalhousie University.

<doc id="664889" wikidata="Q849909" url="?curid=664889" title="List of legendary kings of Britain">
<text>The following list of legendary kings of Britain () derives predominantly from Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s circa 1136 work &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; (&quot;the History of the Kings of Britain&quot;). Geoffrey constructed a largely fictional history for the Britons (ancestors of the Welsh, the Cornish and the Bretons), partly based on the work of earlier medieval historians like Gildas, Nennius and Bede, partly from Welsh genealogies and saints&#x27; lives, partly from sources now lost and unidentifiable, and partly from his own imagination (see bibliography). Several of his kings are based on genuine historical figures, but appear in unhistorical narratives. A number of Middle Welsh versions of Geoffrey&#x27;s &quot;Historia&quot; exist. All post-date Geoffrey&#x27;s text, but may give us some insight into any native traditions Geoffrey may have drawn on.

Geoffrey&#x27;s narrative begins with the exiled Trojan prince Brutus, after whom Britain is supposedly named, a tradition previously recorded in less elaborate form in the 9th century &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;. Brutus is a descendant of Aeneas, the legendary Trojan ancestor of the founders of Rome, and his story is evidently related to Roman foundation legends.

The kings before Brutus come from a document purporting to trace the travels of Noah and his offspring in Europe, and once attributed to the Chaldean historian Berossus, but now considered to have been a fabrication by the 15th-century Italian monk Annio da Viterbo, who first published it. Renaissance historians like John Bale and Raphael Holinshed took the list of kings of &quot;Celtica&quot; given by pseudo-Berossus and made them into kings of Britain as well as Gaul. John Milton records these traditions in his &quot;History of Britain&quot;, although he gives them little credence.

== Brutus of Britain (Brutus of Troy) ==

Historia Brittonum, which is a history of the Celtic Britons written in north Wales in 829–30, claims that the Celtic Britons were descended from Trojans from the ancient city of Troy, who were the first to settle on the island of Britain. It is also claimed in Historia Brittonum, as well as Historia Regum Britanniae by Geoffrey of Monmouth that the first king of the Britons was Brutus of Troy and that the island of Britain was named after him.

== Lucius of Britain ==

Lucius was a legendary 2nd-century king of the Britons traditionally credited with introducing Christianity into Britain. Lucius is first mentioned in a 6th-century version of the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, which says that he sent a letter to Pope Eleutherius asking to be made a Christian. The story became widespread after it was repeated in the 8th century by Bede in his &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;, who added the detail that after Eleutherius granted Lucius&#x27; request, the Britons followed their king in conversion and maintained the Christian faith until the Diocletianic Persecution of 303. Later writers expanded the legend, giving accounts of missionary activity under Lucius and attributing to him the foundation of certain churches.

There is no contemporary evidence for a king of this name. In 1904 Adolf von Harnack proposed that there had been a scribal error in &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot; with &#x27;Britanio&#x27; being written as an erroneous expansion for &#x27;Britio&#x27;, a citadel of Edessa, present day Şanlıurfa in Turkey. The name of the king of Edessa contemporaneous with Pope Eleutherius was Lucius Aelius Aurelius Abgar VIII.

==&quot;Des grantz geanz&quot;==
&quot;Des grantz geanz&quot; (&quot;Of the Great Giants&quot;), a 14th-century Anglo-Norman poem, contains a variant story regarding Albion, the oldest recorded name for Britain, and also contains a slightly different list of kings. The poem states that a colony of exiled Greek royals led by a queen called Albina first founded Britain but before their settlement &quot;no one dwelt there&quot;. Albina subsequently gave her name first to Britain, which was later renamed Britain after Brutus. The poem also attempts by euhemerism to rationalise the legends of giants; Albina is thus described as being &quot;very tall&quot;, but is presented as a human queen, a descendant of a Greek king, not a mythological creature.

The Albina myth is also found in some later manuscripts of Wace&#x27;s &quot;Roman de Brut&quot; (1155), attached as a prologue.

==Scota==
Scota, in Scottish mythology, and pseudohistory, is the name given to the mythological daughter of an Egyptian pharaoh to whom the Gaels and Scots traced their ancestry. Scota first appeared in literature from the 11th or 12th century and most modern scholars interpret the legends surrounding her to have emerged to rival Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s claims that the descendants of Brutus (through Albanactus) founded Scotland. However some early Irish sources also refer to the Scota legends and not all scholars regard the legends as fabrications or as political constructions. In the Scottish origin myths, Albanactus had little place and Scottish chroniclers (e.g., John of Fordun and Walter Bower) claimed that Scota was the eponymous founder of Scotland and the Scots long before Albanactus, during the time of Moses.

==Monarchs derived from Geoffrey of Monmouth==
Geoffrey synchronises some of his monarchs with figures and events from the Bible, Greek, Roman and Irish legends, and recorded history. These are given in the &quot;Synchronisation&quot; column of the table below. Geoffrey dated Brutus&#x27; arrival in Britain (and subsequent founding of the Trojan-British monarchy) to 1115 BC. Geoffrey&#x27;s book was later retold by Wace (in French) and Layamon (in Middle English); the final column represents Layamon&#x27;s version.

After the death of Cadwallader, the kings of the Brythons were reduced to such a small domain that they ceased to be kings of the whole Brythonic-speaking area. Two of his relatives, Yvor and Yni, led the exiles back from Brittany, but were unable to re-establish a united kingship. The Anglo-Saxon invaders ruled the south-eastern part of the island of Great Britain, which would become England, after that point in time under the Bretwaldas and later the kings of England. The heirs to the Celtic-British throne continued through the Welsh kings of Gwynedd until that line was forced to submit itself to the Plantagenets in the 13th century. Princes and lords of Gwynedd ruled until the reign of Dafydd III, who ruled from 1282 to 1283. His death marked the end of the house of Brutus. Owen Tudor, grandfather of Henry VII of England, was a maternal descendant of the kings of Gwynedd; Henry&#x27;s marriage with Elizabeth of York thus signified the merging of the two royal houses (as well as the feuding houses of York and Lancaster).

==Forgeries==

===Pseudo-Berossus===

Annius of Viterbo in 1498 claimed to have found ancient fragments from Berossus detailing the earliest settlement of &#x27;Celtica&#x27;, including the British Isles, by Samothes, a son of Japheth, son of Noah, after the Great Flood. These fragments were later revealed to have been forged by Annius himself, and are now known as &quot;Pseudo-Berossus&quot;. The fragments can be found in Asher (1993) and include a king list. Before being revealed as a hoax, the list found its way into John Bale&#x27;s &quot;Illustrium majoris Britanniae scriptorum&quot; (1548), John Caius&#x27; &quot;Historia Cantabrigiensis Academiae&quot; (1574), William Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Description of England&quot; (1577), &quot;Holinshed&#x27;s Chronicles&quot; (1587) and Anthony Munday&#x27;s &quot;A briefe chronicle&quot; (1611).

===Iolo Morganwg&#x27;s Welsh Kings===
Iolo Morganwg, between 1801 and 1807, published a series of Welsh Triads he claimed to have discovered in manuscript form, with the help of the antiquarian William Owen Pughe. These were later revealed to be a mixture of forgeries by Morganwg and Williams&#x27; alterations to authentic triads. Exactly how much &quot;authentic&quot; content there is of Morganwg&#x27;s published work remains disputed by scholars today. Morganwg&#x27;s triads describe the earliest occupation of Britain (Prydain) and contain a pseudo-historical reign of kings, beginning with Hu Gadarn, the &quot;Plough King&quot;.

Hu Gadarn is described by Morganwg in his triads as being the earliest inhabitant of Britain having travelled from the &quot;Summerland, called &quot;Deffrobani&quot;, where Constantinople now stands&quot; in 1788 BC. He is credited as having founded the first civilisation in Britain and introduced agriculture. Morganwg&#x27;s &quot;Barddas&quot; (1862, p. 348) further states that this king is descended from Hu, but that, after a huge flood (see Afanc), only two people, &quot;Dwyfan&quot; and &quot;Dwyfach&quot;, survived from whom the later inhabitants of Britain descended. The Welsh clergyman Edward Davies included this myth in his &quot;Celtic Researches on the Origin, Traditions and Languages of the Ancient Britons&quot; (1804):

Several 19th-century Christian authors—for example, Henry Hoyle Howorth—interpreted this myth to be evidence for the Biblical flood of Noah, yet in Morganwg&#x27;s chronology &quot;Dwyfan&quot; and &quot;Dwyfach&quot; are dated to the 18th or 17th century BC, which does not fit the Biblical estimate for the Noachian deluge.

===Tea Tephi===
Tea Tephi is a legendary princess found described in British Israelite literature from the 19th century. Revd F. R. A. Glover, M.A., of London in 1861 published &quot;England, the Remnant of Judah, and the Israel of Ephraim&quot; in which he claimed Tea Tephi was one of Zedekiah&#x27;s daughters. Since King Zedekiah of Judah had all his sons killed during the Babylonian Captivity, no male successors could continue the throne of King David, but, as Glover noted, Zedekiah had daughters who escaped death (Jeremiah 43:6). Glover believed that Tea Tephi was a surviving Judahite princess who had escaped and travelled to Ireland, and who married a local High King of Ireland in the 6th century BC who subsequently became blood linked to the British monarchy. This theory was later expanded upon by Rev. A.B. Grimaldi, who published in 1877 a successful chart entitled &quot;Pedigree of Queen Victoria from the Bible Kings&quot; and later by W.M.H. Milner in his booklet &quot;The Royal House of Britain an Enduring Dynasty&quot;&#x27; (1902, revised 1909). Charles Fox Parham also authored an article tracing Queen Victoria&#x27;s lineage back to King David (through Tea Tephi) entitled &quot;Queen Victoria: Heir to King David&#x27;s Royal Throne&quot;.

The Tea Tephi-British monarchy link is also found in J. H. Allen&#x27;s &quot;Judah&#x27;s Sceptre and Joseph&#x27;s Birthright&quot; (1902, p. 251). A central tenet of British Israelism is that the British monarchy is from the Davidic line and the legend of Tea Tephi from the 19th century attempted to legitimise this claim. Tea Tephi, however, has never been traced to an extant Irish source before the 19th century and critics assert she was purely a British Israelite invention. A collection of alleged bardic traditions and Irish manuscripts which detail Tea Tephi were published by J. A. Goodchild in 1897 as &quot;The Book of Tephi&quot;. the work is, however, considered pseudo-historical or a forgery.

There is though a queen called Tea in Irish mythology who appears in the Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland. She is described as the wife of Érimón a Míl Espáine (Milesian) and dated to 1700 BC (Geoffrey Keating: 1287 BC). These dates are inconsistent with the British Israelite literature which dates Tea Tephi to the 6th century BC, but later British Israelites, such as Herman Hoeh (&quot;Compendium of World History&quot;, 1970), claimed that the Milesian Royal House (including Tea) was from an &quot;earlier&quot; blood descendant of the Davidic Line who entered Britain around 1000 BC (citing Ruaidhrí Ó Flaithbheartaigh&#x27;s reduced chronology). Linked to Glover&#x27;s original claims of Tea Tephi, are Grimaldi and Milner&#x27;s theory that Jeremiah himself in the company of his scribe Baruch ben Neriah travelled to Ireland with Tea Tephi and that they are found described in Irish folklore and old Irish manuscripts. Some British Israelites identify Baruch ben Neriah with a figure called Simon Berac or Berak in Irish myth, while Jeremiah with Ollom Fotla (or Ollam, Ollamh Fodhla). However, like Tea Tephi, there has long been controversy about these identifications, mainly because of conflicting or inconsistent dates. In 2001, the British-Israel-World Federation wrote an article claiming they no longer subscribed to these two identifications, but still strongly stick to the belief that the British monarchy is of Judahite origin. In an earlier publication in 1982, Covenant Publishing Co. admitted that Tea Tephi could not be traced in Irish literature or myth and may have been fabricated by Glover, but they clarified they still believed in the Milesian Royal House-Davidic Line bloodline connection (popularised by Hoeh). Herbert Armstrong (1986) also took up this legendary connection.

<text>Highway 7B, known as the Mary Hill Bypass, is a long riverside east-west link between the cities of Coquitlam to the west and Port Coquitlam to the east. The Mary Hill Bypass gained its numbered designation in 1996, when it was widened from two to four lanes north of Broadway. Highway 7B meets Highway 7 at both of its ends, and also links to Highway 1 within Coquitlam at the Cape Horn Interchange.

==Route description==

The Mary Hill Bypass begins at an intersection with United Boulevard in Coquitlam. Just west of this intersection are the ramps that connect Highway 1 and Highway 7 (westbound only) within the Cape Horn Interchange. Highway 1 and Highway 7 eastbound can be accessed via United Boulevard. After crossing the Coquitlam River, the highway continues on, turning east and passing through a major intersection which provides access to downtown Port Coquitlam. Continuing northeast, the Mary Hill Bypass passes through another major intersection, then enters an industrial park and passes through another three intersections. After passing a railway underpass and one final intersection, the Mary Hill Bypass ends at Highway 7, which continues east to Pitt Meadows, Maple Ridge, and Mission.

==History==

The Mary Hill Bypass skirts around Mary Hill, which was developed in the early 1960s for residential housing. The highway itself was built in the mid-eighties and was officially opened to traffic on 19 December 1985. It cost about $26 million CAD (equivalent to $62.32 million in 2022). In the mid-1990s,the Bypass saw major improvements north of Broadway. This included four-laning the existing two lane section and a new railway overpass. The widened highway was opened by Premier Glen Clark on 24 October 1996. The intersection with Lougheed Highway was replaced by an interchange in 2009 as a part of the Pitt River Bridge replacement project.

With the discontinuation of route 7A in 1999 highway 7 is the only highway system in BC to have a &quot;B&quot; route but no official &quot;A&quot; route.

==Related routes==
===North Fraser Perimeter Road===
As part of the Ministry of Transportation&#x27;s Metro Vancouver Gateway Program, improvements to existing roads around the north side of the Fraser River between the Queensborough Bridge in New Westminster and the Golden Ears Bridge in Maple Ridge. This project was known as the North Fraser Perimeter Road, including the upgrading of intersections and possible interchanges along the Mary Hill Bypass and construction of the new, cable-stayed Pitt River Bridge. While the new Pitt River Bridge was constructed, the remainder of the North Fraser Perimeter Road was cancelled.

===United Boulevard===
United Boulevard is a major roadway in Coquitlam used as connection between Highway 7B and Highways 1 and 7. A segment is provincially maintained as part of Highway 7B; however, the section is unsigned and the western terminus of Highway 7B is signed as being at the Mary Hill Bypass / United Boulevard interchange.

==Major intersections==
From west to east; list excludes United Boulevard.

<text>Secure Communication based on Quantum Cryptography (SECOQC) is a project that aims to develop quantum cryptography (see there for further details). The European Union decided in 2004 to invest 11 million EUR in the project as a way of circumventing espionage attempts by ECHELON. Christian Monyk, the coordinator of SECOQC, said people and organizations in Austria, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Sweden, and Switzerland would participate in the project.

On October 8, 2008 SECOQC was launched in Vienna.

== Limitations of classical quantum cryptography ==
Quantum cryptography, usually known as quantum key distribution (QKD) provides powerful security. But it has some limitations. Following no-cloning theorem, QKD only can provide one-to-one connections. So the number of links will increase formula_1 as formula_2 represents the number of nodes. If a node wants to participate into the QKD network, it will cause some issues like constructing quantum communication line. To overcome these issues, SECOQC was started.

== Brief architecture of SECOQC network ==
SECOQC network architecture can be divided into two parts: trusted private networks and quantum networks connected via QBBs (quantum backbones). The private networks are conventional networks with end-nodes and a QBB. Each QBB enables quantum channel communication with another QBB and consists of a number of QKD devices that are connected with other QKD devices over one-to-one connections.

From this, SECOQC can provide easier registration of new end-nodes in a QKD network, and quick recovery from threats on quantum channel links.
