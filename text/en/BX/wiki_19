<text>Magdala (; ; ) was an ancient Jewish city on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, north of Tiberias. In the Babylonian Talmud it is known as Magdala Nunayya (), and which some historical geographers think may refer to Tarichaea (). It is believed to be the birthplace of Mary Magdalene. Until the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the Arab village of al-Majdal () stood at the site of ancient Magdala. The Israeli municipality of Migdal now extends into the area.

==History==

=== Roman period ===
Archaeological excavations on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) conducted in 2006 found that the settlement began during the Hellenistic period (between the second and first centuries BCE) and ended during the late Roman period (third century CE). Later excavations in 2009–2013 brought perhaps the most important discovery in the site: an ancient synagogue, called the &quot;Migdal Synagogue&quot;, dating from the Second Temple period. It is the oldest synagogue found in the Galilee, and one of the few synagogues from that period found in the entire country, as of the time of the excavation. They also found the Magdala stone, which has a seven-branched menorah symbol carved on it. It is the earliest menorah of that period to be discovered outside Jerusalem.

Archaeologists discovered an entire first century Jewish town lying just below the surface. The excavation revealed multiple structures and four &quot;mikvaot&quot; (plural of &quot;mikvah&quot; or &quot;mikveh&quot;). In 2021, another synagogue from the same period was discovered at Magdala.

At Magdala, two texts from the first century were discovered. The initial finding is a Greek mosaic inscription embedded in tessera, displaying the word ΚΑΙΣΥ, translated as &quot;(Welcome) also to you!&quot;. The second finding is a lead weight with Greek inscriptions from the 23rd year of Agrippa II, referencing two agoranomoi, enabling its dating to either 71/2 or 82/3 CE.

A collapse layer from the Second Temple period supports Josephus&#x27;s narrative of the Roman destruction of Magdala during the First Jewish–Roman War. Excavations show that after the destruction, during the Byzantine and Early Islamic periods, the city moved slightly to the north.

Magdala has been described as the &quot;capital of a toparchy&quot; and compared to Sepphoris and Tiberias in that it had &quot;administrative apparatus and personnel&quot; though not to the same extent.

==== Synagogues ====
The remains of a Roman-period synagogue dated to 50 BCE- 100 CE were discovered in 2009. The walls of the main hall were decorated with brightly colored frescoes and inside was a stone block carved with a seven-branched menorah.

In December 2021, a second synagogue dating to the Second Temple period was unearthed at Magdala. It is the first time two synagogues from this period have been found in a single site. The second synagogue found was not as ornate as the first, and probably served the city&#x27;s industrial zone.

The city was destroyed by the Romans during the First Jewish-Roman War.

=== Byzantine, Early Muslim, and Crusader periods ===
All four gospels refer to a follower of Jesus called Mary Magdalene, which is usually assumed to mean &quot;Mary from Magdala&quot;, although there is no biblical information to indicate whether it was her birthplace or her home. Most Christian scholars assume that she was from Magdala Nunayy. Recognition of Magdala as the birthplace of Mary Magdalene appears in texts dating back to the 6th century CE. In the 8th and 10th centuries CE, Christian sources write of a church in the village that was Mary Magdalene&#x27;s house, where Jesus is said to have exorcised her of demons. The anonymously penned &quot;Life of Constantine&quot; attributes the building of the church to Empress Helena in the 4th century CE, at the location where she found Mary Magdalene&#x27;s house. Christian pilgrims to Palestine in the 12th century mention the location of Magdala, but fail to mention the presence of any church at that time.

=== Mamluk period ===
Under the rule of the Mamluks in the 13th century, sources indicate that the church was used as a stable. In 1283, Burchard of Mount Sion records having entered the house of Mary Magdalene in the village, and about ten years later, Ricoldus of Montecroce noted his joy at having found the church and house still standing.

Al-Majdal (, &quot;tower&quot;, also transliterated Majdal, Majdil and Mejdel) was a Palestinian Arab village, located on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee ( below sea level; ), north of Tiberias and south of Khan Minyeh. destroyed by the Romans during the First Jewish-Roman War.

Christian pilgrims wrote of visiting the house and church of Mary Magdalene from the 6th century onward, but little is known about the village in the Mamluk and early Ottoman period, indicating it was likely small or uninhabited. In the 19th century, Western travellers generally describing it as a very small and poor Muslim village.

===Ottoman era===
Francesco Quaresmi writes of al-Majdal in 1626 that &quot;certain people have claimed that her house is to be seen there&quot;, but that the site was in ruins.

The small Muslim Arab village of Al-Majdal was located to the south of the land acquired by the Franciscans. Little is known about the village in the medieval or early Ottoman period, presumably because it was either small or uninhabited. Richard Pococke visited &quot;Magdol&quot; around 1740, where he noted &quot;the considerable remains of an indifferent castle&quot;, which in his opinion was not the biblical Magdala. The village appeared as El Megdel on the 1799 map of Pierre Jacotin. In the early 19th century, foreign travellers interested in the Christian traditions associated with the site visited the village. In 1807 U. Seetzen stayed overnight in &quot;the little Mahommedan village of Majdil, situated on the bank of the lake.&quot; The English traveler James Silk Buckingham observed in 1816 that a few Muslim families resided there, and in 1821, the Swiss traveler Johann Ludwig Burckhardt noted that the village was in a rather poor condition.

During his travels through Syria and Palestine in 1838, Edward Robinson described el-Mejdel, as he called it, &quot;a miserable little Muslim village, looking much like a ruin, though exhibiting no marks of antiquity.&quot; He wrote: &quot;The name Mejdel is obviously the same with the Hebrew Migdal and Greek Magdala; there is little reason to doubt that this place is the Magdala of the New Testament, chiefly known as the native town of Mary Magdalene. The ancient notices respecting its position are exceedingly indefinite; yet it seems to follow from the New Testament itself, that it lay on the west side of the lake. After the miraculous feeding of four thousand, which appears to have taken place in the country east of the lake, Jesus &#x27;took ship and came into the coast of Magdala;&#x27; for which Mark the Evangelist writes Dalmanutha. Here, the Pharisees began to question him, but he &#x27;left them, and entering into the ship again, departed to the &quot;other side&quot; [...] This view is further confirmed by the testimony of the Rabbins in the Jerusalem Talmud, compiled at Tiberias; who several times speak of Magdala as adjacent to Tiberias and Hammath or the hot springs. The Migdal-el of the Old Testament in the tribe of Naphtali was probably the same place.&quot;

In his account of an expedition to the Jordan River and the Dead Sea in 1849, William Francis Lynch reports that it was &quot;a poor village of about 40 families, all fellahin,&quot; living in houses of stone with mud roofs, similar to those in Tur&#x27;an. Arriving by boat a few years later, Bayard Taylor describes the view from path winding up from shoreline, &quot;[...] through oleanders, nebbuks, patches of hollyhock, anise-seed, fennel, and other spicy plants, while on the west, great fields of barley stand ripe for the cutting. In some places, the Fellahs, men and women, were at work, reaping and binding the sheaves.&quot;

In 1857, Solomon Caesar Malan wrote: &quot;Each house, whether separate or attached to another, consisted of one room only. The walls built of mud and of stones, were about ten or twelve feet high; and perhaps as many or more feet square. The roof which was flat, consisted of trunks of trees placed across from one wall to another, and then covered with small branches, grass and rushes; over which a thick coating of mud and gravel was laid. ... A flight of rude steps against the wall outside leads up to the roof; and thus enables those who will to reach it without entering the house.&quot;

There were two shrines in Al-Majdal: the maqam of Sheikh Muhammad al-&#x27;Ajami to the north of the village and the maqam of Sheikh Muhammad ar-Raslan (or ar-Ruslan) south of the village, as shown on PEF maps and British maps of the 1940s. The first shrine is mentioned by Victor Guérin in 1863. He writes that he arrived in the village from the north: &quot;At seven twenty minutes I crossed the fifth important stream, called Wadi al-Hammam. Behind him is a wely dedicated to the saint Sidi al-Adjemy. At seven o&#x27;clock twenty-five minutes I reach Mejdel, a village which I pass without stopping, having already visited it enough&quot;.

Isabel Burton also mentions the shrine for Muhammad al-&#x27;Ajami in her private journals published in 1875: &quot;First we came to Magdala (Mejdel) ... There is a tomb here of a Shaykh (El Ajami), the name implies a Persian Santon; there is a tomb seen on a mountain, said to be that of Dinah, Jacob&#x27;s daughter. Small boys were running in Nature&#x27;s garb on the beach, which is white, sandy, pebbly, and full of small shells.&quot; 

In 1881 the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; described al-Majdal as a stone-built village, situated on a partially arable plain, with an estimated population of about 80. Fellahin from Egypt are said to have settled in the village some time in the 19th century.

A population list from about 1887 showed &quot;el Mejdel&quot; to have about 170 inhabitants; all Muslims.

The Jewish agricultural settlement of Migdal was established in 1910–1911 on land purchased by Russian Zionists Jews, northwest of the village of Al-Majdal.

===British Mandate era===
Bellarmino Bagatti and another Franciscan friar who visited the village in 1935 were hosted by the Mukhtar Mutlaq, whose nine wives and descendants are said to have made up almost the whole of the population of the village at the time. Part of the site was acquired by the Franciscan Custody of the Holy Land sometime after 1935. During this period, Al-Majdal had a rectangular layout, with most of the houses crowded together, though a few to the north along the lakeshore were spaced further apart. Built of stone, cement, and mud, some had roofs of wood and cane covered with a layer of mud. It was the smallest village in the district of Tiberias in terms of land area. The Muslim inhabitants maintained a shrine for one Mohammad al-Ajami on the northern outskirts of the village. To the west of the village on the summit of the mountains, lay the remains of the Crusader fortress of Magdala (later known as &quot;Qal&#x27;at Na&#x27;la&quot; (&quot;the fortress of Na&#x27;la&quot;). On the lakeshore about south of the village, was a perforated black stone mentioned by Arab travellers in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Local belief held that the holes were caused by ants having eaten through it, and for this reason it was called &quot;hajar al-namla&quot;, &quot;the ant´s stone.&quot;

At the time of the 1922 census of Palestine, Majdal had a population of 210 Muslims, increasing to 284 Muslims living in 62 houses by the 1931 census. The village economy was based on agriculture, vegetables and grain.

In the 1945 statistics Al-Majdal had a population of 360 Muslims with a total land area of 103 dunams. Of this, 24 dunams were used for growing citrus and bananas, and 41 dunums devoted to cereals. Another 17 dunams were irrigated or used for orchards, while 6 dunams were classified as built-up (urban) area.

===1948 War===
During the 1947–1948 civil war in Mandatory Palestine, after the Arab quarter of Tiberias was taken by Jewish forces and its inhabitants were evacuated, the Arab villages surrounding it were also depopulated, including Al-Majdal. Benny Morris writes that the inhabitants were persuaded by the headmen of [neighbouring Jewish] Migdal and Kibbutz Ginosar to evacuate their homes; the villagers were paid P£200 for eight rifles, ammunition and a bus they handed over. They were then transported to the Jordanian border by bus. Al-Majdal was subsequently bulldozed by the Israelis in 1948.

===Migdal===
In 1910–1911, the Jewish village of Migdal was established adjacent to Al-Majdal. After 1948, Migdal expanded to include some of the village land of Al-Majdal. 

===State of Israel===
Walid Khalidi describes the village remains in 1992: &quot;The site is dotted with rubble, Christ&#x27;s-thorn, and a few palm and olive trees. The only remaining village landmark is the neglected shrine of Muhammad al-&#x27;Ajami, a low, square, stone structure topped by a formerly whitewashed dome. The land in the vicinity is cultivated by Israelis.&quot; In 1991, Petersen visited the maqam of Muhammad al-Ajami, describing it as a small square building with a shallow dome supported by squinches. The entrance was on the north side, where there also was a small window. The shrine appeared to contain two tombs, one about high, while the other marked only by a low kerb of stones. The larger tomb was covered with purple and green cloth.

Visiting in the 1980s and 1990s, Jane Schaberg reports that the site was marked by a sign that says: &quot;This was the birthplace of Mary Magdelene, a city that flourished toward the end of the Second Temple period and one of the cities fortified by Joseph ben Matityahu (Josephus) during the great revolt of the Jews against the Romans.&quot; The site contained an Islamic domed structure and an old stone house surrounded by a stone wall topped with barbed wire. Weeds had grown over the site where excavations were carried out in the 1970s but had been suspended due to water seepage from underground springs. An Arab family living in a nearby shack served as caretakers for the portion of the site owned by the Franciscans. Another small plot of land was owned by the Greek Orthodox Church, while the Jewish National Fund (JNF) owned the remainder.

==Etymology==
The Arabic name Majdal means &quot;tower&quot; and preserves the ancient place name Magdala. Magdala was also known in ancient times as Migdal (Hebrew), and the Aramaic names ascribed to it are either Magdala Nunaya (also, Migdal Nunnaya or Nunayah; &quot;Tower of Fish&quot;) or Magdala Tza&#x27;baya (also Migdal Seb&#x27;iya; &quot;Magdala of the Dyers&quot; or &quot;Tower of Dyers&quot;), although some think these to be the same identification. Whether they are one and the same place has yet to be determined, as both Aramaic names appear in the Babylonian Talmud (&quot;Pesahim&quot; 46a) and Jerusalem Talmud (&quot;Ta&#x27;anit&quot; 4:8) respectively. Others ascribe the name of the site to the Greek Magdala Taricheae (&quot;Magdala of the Fish Salters&quot;), likely due to the town&#x27;s famed fish-curing industry. The identification of Magdala with Taricheae, however, remains inconclusive. Archaeologist, Mordechai Aviam, who (like W.F. Albright) held that Tarichaea was to be recognised in the name Migdal (Magdala), admits that during the large archaeological excavations conducted at the site, no remains of fortifications or a destruction layer were found.

Mary Magdalene&#x27;s surname as transcribed in the gospels is said to be derived from Magdala as her home and place of birth. Alfred Edersheim cites the Talmud as evidence for this naming practice, which describes several Rabbis as &#x27;Magdalene&#x27; or residents of Magdala.

Majdal and Majdalani (&quot;of Majdal&quot;) are common place names and family names in the Syria-Palestine region. Examples of such place names include Al-Majdal, Askalan, Majdal Yaba, and Al-Mujaydil (depopulated Palestinian villages located in modern-day Israel), Majdal Shams (a Syrian-Druze village in the Golan Heights), Majdal Bani Fadil (in the West Bank) and Majdal Anjar (in modern-day Lebanon).

== Identification ==
Magdala&#x27;s reference in is, in some editions, given as &quot;&quot;Magadan&quot;; and in it is &quot;Dalmanutha&quot;&quot;.

In 2014, Joan Taylor argued against the identification of al-Majdal with either Magdala or Tarichaea, and questioned the association with Mary Magdelene.

=== Matthew&#x27;s &quot;Magdala&quot; or &quot;Magadan&quot; ===
The New Testament makes one disputable mention of a place called Magdala. Matthew 15:39 of the King James Version reads, &quot;And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala&quot;. However, some Greek manuscripts give the name of the place as &quot;Magadan&quot;, and more recent translations (such as the Revised Version) follow this (). Although some commentators state confidently that the two refer to the same place, others dismiss the substitution of Magdala for Magadan as simply &quot;to substitute a known for an unknown place&quot;.

=== Mark&#x27;s &quot;Dalmanutha&quot; ===
The parallel passage in Mark&#x27;s gospel () gives (in the majority of manuscripts) a quite different place name, Dalmanutha, although a handful of manuscripts give either Magdala or Magadan, presumably by assimilation to the Matthean text—believed in ancient times to be older than that of Mark, though this opinion has now been reversed.

=== The Talmud&#x27;s two Magdalas ===
The Jewish Talmud distinguishes between two Magdalas:

* Magdala Gadar—One Magdala was in the east, on the River Yarmouk near Gadara (in the Middle Ages &quot;Jadar&quot;, now Umm Qais), thus acquiring the name Magdala Gadar.
* Magdala Nunayya—There was another, better-known Magdala near Tiberias, Magdala Nunayya (&quot;Magdala of the fishes&quot;), which would locate it on the shore of the Sea of Galilee. Al-Majdal, a Palestinian Arab village depopulated in the lead up to the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, was identified as the site of this Magdala. The modern Israeli municipality of Migdal, founded in 1910 and about north-northwest of Tiberias, has expanded into the area of the former village.

=== Josephus&#x27;s &quot;Tarichaea&quot; ===
Some researchers think that Josephus refers to Magdala Nunayya by the Greek name Tarichaea (Ant. 14.20; 20. 159; J.W. 1. 180; 2. 252), derived from the Greek Τάριχος or &quot;tarichos&quot;, meaning &#x27;fish preserved by salting or drying&#x27;, although the matter remains disputed.

Josephus is the primary source for Taricheae H.H. Kitchener of the Palestine Exploration Fund suggested that Taricheae was to be identified with the nearby ruin, &quot;Khurbet Kuneitriah&quot;, between Tiberias and Migdal. Others identify Taricheae with Kerek. The Magadan mentioned in Matthew 15:39 and the Dalmanutha of Mark 8:10 are likely corrupt forms of Magdal (Magdala) and Magdal Nuna (Magdala Nunaya).

== Excavations ==

At the beginning of the 20th century, R. Lendle, a German architect purchased some land from the Arab villagers to carry out excavations, but no reports were made of the findings. The remains of a church with an apse and a stone inscribed with a cross and the date 1389 were found near Birqat Sitti Miriam (Arabic: &quot;The Pool of Our Lady Mary&quot;) on the Franciscan-owned grounds.

Between 1971 and 1977 Magdala was partially excavated by Virgilio Canio Corbo and Stanislao Loffreda of the Studium Biblicum Franciscanum in Jerusalem. However, their reports are in Italian and attracted little notice. Between 1971 and 1976, excavations also discovered the remains of what is thought to have been a Byzantine era monastery near the sea. The excavations were hindered by the water from underground springs, as well as the destruction wrought by the bulldozing of the Arab village which pushed many ancient artifacts towards the sea. The mosaic of the Byzantine monastery was badly damaged, though part of the geometric and cross design of red, white, blue and ash-coloured stones could still be seen. A Roman era paved road dating to the 1st century CE was also uncovered and identified. To the east of it, a building encompassing of closed space was revealed that is thought to be either a 1st-century CE mini-synagogue or nymphaeum. Other findings include a tower, aqueduct, and large paved court enclosed by colonnades to the south, and to the north, a large urban villa. The villa was in use between the 1st century CE and the Byzantine era; a Greek inscription at the doorstep reading &quot;kai su&quot; (&quot;and you&quot; or &quot;you too&quot;) is the only one of its kind to be found in Israel, though similar inscriptions have been found in private homes excavated in Antioch.

Other artifacts discovered in the excavations of the 1970s include a needle and lead weights for repairing and holding down fishing nets, and numerous coins. Many of the coins dated to the time of the first Jewish revolt against Rome (66 - 70 CE), four to the 3rd century CE, and in the top layer, one dated to the time of Constantine. Another cache of coins found there contained 74 from Tyre, 15 from Ptolemais, 17 from Gadara, 14 from Scythopolis, 10 from Tiberias, 9 from Hippos, 8 from Sepphoris and 2 from Gaba.

In 1991, during a period of severe drought, the waters of the Sea of Galilee receded and the remains of a tower with a base made of basalt pillars was revealed about from the shoreline. Archaeologists believe it served as a lighthouse for fishermen. It has since been submerged by the waters once again.

Excavations begun at Magdala during 2007-8 were called &quot;The Magdala Project&quot;. Salvage excavations at Magdala are being conducted under the auspices of The Zinman Institute of Archaeology at the University of Haifa. As of 2021, the dig is contracted to Y.G. Contractual Archeology Ltd.

<text>World News Now (or WNN) is an American overnight news broadcast seen on ABC and ABC News Live. Airing during the early morning hours each Monday through Friday, the program features a mix of general news and off-beat stories, along with weather forecasts, sports highlights, feature segments, and repurposed segments and story packages from other ABC News programs; its tone is often lighthearted, irreverent and humorous.

Created by David Bohrman, who also served as the original executive producer, a number of well-known news personalities have anchored &quot;WNN&quot; early in their careers, including original anchors Aaron Brown and Lisa McRee, Thalia Assuras, Kevin Newman, Alison Stewart, Liz Cho, Anderson Cooper and current &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot; anchor David Muir. The program is primarily co-anchored by ABC News correspondents Andrew Dymburt and Rhiannon Ally, who also anchor the network&#x27;s early-morning news program &quot;Good Morning America First Look&quot;. ABC News reporter Danny New also contributes to both programs.

&quot;WNN&quot; is divided into four segment blocks (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot;) that start with national and international news headlines incorporating some pre-taped reports (with some live wraparounds) from ABC NewsOne correspondents or repeated reports from the network&#x27;s evening news program &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot;. The &quot;A&quot;-block also features a national weather forecast (significant weather stories are also reported during the broadcast through analysis from meteorologists employed with AccuWeather, which provides forecasts for ABC&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations) and an often humorous &quot;kicker&quot; story that ends the block. The &quot;B,&quot; &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; blocks usually feature a mix of stories from &quot;Nightline&quot; or the BBC, or other live-to-tape or pre-taped segments produced in-studio, depending on the day of the week.

==History==
===1991–1993===

In late 1991 and early 1992, ABC, CBS and NBC each created their own overnight general news programs -- &quot;World News Now,&quot; &quot;Up to the Minute,&quot; and &quot;NBC Nightside,&quot; respectively—to compete for viewer demand that was driven originally by CNN&#x27;s 24-hour coverage of the Gulf War, and to supply local affiliates with overnight programming. Until the creation of these news programs, owned-and-operated and affiliate stations of the three networks commonly filled overnight timeslots with movies and/or syndicated programs, while some others simply signed off the air for the night. The original working title for the program was World News Overnight; ABC News executives chose to rename the program World News Now prior to the first broadcast.

The program debuted on January 6, 1992, with Aaron Brown and Lisa McRee as its original anchors. Later that year, the production staff of &quot;World News Now&quot; took over production responsibilities for the network&#x27;s early-morning news program &quot;World News This Morning&quot;, sharing anchors as a result. After McRee&#x27;s departure in January 1993, Brown anchored solo (with a cardboard cutout of McRee in her old seat) until he was joined in May of that year by Thalia Assuras, who at five years became the program&#x27;s longest-serving anchor when she left in 1998 for CBS News. Brown himself would leave a month later; from then, &quot;World News Now&quot; would experience significant turnover with its anchor staff that continues to this day.

In the tradition of &quot;NBC News Overnight&quot; (the predecessor to original rival &quot;NBC Nightside&quot;), &quot;World News Now&quot; has featured serious as well as offbeat news stories interspersed with odd features such as the &quot;World News Polka&quot; (played by comedian Barry Mitchell on the accordion), video footage of dancing camels on Wednesdays (for &quot;Hump Day&quot;), and laughter coming from off-camera. Weather predictions were made for obscure and exotic places around the world; some of the locales have had various ties to the show, while some have had popular culture significance, including Cicely, Alaska, and Twin Peaks, Washington.

The program also often replays story packages from other ABC News programs such as &quot;Nightline&quot; and &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot;. It has been an apparent training ground for new news presenters (see list below) who eventually go on to higher-profile positions with the network or local affiliates. The show is also unique for its interactive segments, some of which pioneered the email communication that is commonly used on television newscasts today. The ABC News &quot;WNN&quot; internet forum has offered viewers questions and comments from the anchors themselves, during the course of the show.

===1994–1998===
On November 23, 1995, &quot;World News Now&quot; became the first television program to be broadcast live on the Internet, using the CU-SeeMe interface. Victor Dorff, a producer of &quot;WNN&quot; at the time, arranged to have the show simulcast on the Internet daily for a six-month trial period.

&quot;World News Now&quot; was used as the prototype for &quot;Fred&quot;, ABC&#x27;s plan to operate a cable news channel. The plan was floated by network management in 1995 and was later dropped within a couple of years due to issues with cable carriage, including competition with the recently launched MSNBC and Fox News.

In the fall of 1998, ABC News entered into a labor dispute, resulting in support employees being locked out from the news division&#x27;s headquarters for several months. While &quot;World News This Morning&quot; continued to be produced in New York City with substitute production staff, production of &quot;World News Now&quot; was moved to the news division&#x27;s London news bureau. Mark Mullen returned to anchor &quot;WNN&quot; during the last month of the lockout.

===1999–2008===
Following its CU-SeeMe trial, &quot;World News Now&quot; later attempted another webcast; between 1999 and 2001, the program was streamed live for free on the ABC News website. In 2005, the free behind-the-scenes webcast returned. Among the anchors of the broadcast during this period was David Muir, who eventually became co-anchor of the newsmagazine &quot;20/20&quot; and became anchor of the weekday editions of &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot; in August 2014, who co-anchored &quot;World News Now&quot; from July 2003 to August 2004 (originally with Andrea Stassou and later with Tamala Edwards).

On June 8, 2006, ABC White House Correspondent Martha Raddatz learned of the death of terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi near Baqubah, Iraq. Upon confirmation of the tip, ABC ran a breaking news at 2:38 a.m. Eastern Time, helmed by &quot;WNN&quot; anchors Ron Corning and Tai Hernandez. The show, which is normally repeated on tape after the initial broadcast, instead went live in all time zones and into the early-morning news program &quot;World News This Morning&quot;. The on-air and behind-the-scenes staff stayed on-air until &quot;Good Morning America&quot; began and took over coverage of the story at 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

In January 2007, &quot;World News Now&quot; celebrated its 15th anniversary, with the brief resurrection of the National Temperature Index (see below) and a new version of the &quot;World News Polka&quot;. On August 2, 2007, &quot;WNN&quot; abandoned its normal format and ran nearly continuous coverage of the I-35W Mississippi River bridge collapse that occurred in Minneapolis the day before; coverage on the program was anchored by Hernández and Stephanie Sy, and continued into &quot;America This Morning&quot;.

Tai Hernandez left the show on December 18, 2007, in order to spend more time with her children, while Ryan Owens announced on February 29, 2008, that he would be leaving the show to become a full-time correspondent for ABC News. During the week of January 7, 2008, &quot;WNN&quot; celebrated its 16th anniversary on the air with retrospective segments on the early days of the broadcast and its anchors. Jeremy Hubbard was named co-anchor of &quot;World News Now&quot; on March 17, 2008, with Vinita Nair being named as Hubbard&#x27;s co-anchor on September 17 of that year.

===2009–2011===

On September 22, 2009, &quot;World News Now&quot; became the first network overnight newscast to begin broadcasting in high definition.

On July 9, 2010, Jeremy Hubbard left &quot;WNN&quot; to become a full-time correspondent for ABC News; he was replaced as Nair&#x27;s co-anchor on the program by Rob Nelson. In Hubbard&#x27;s honor, the &quot;World News Now&quot; staff looked back at his time with the program and as is tradition when an anchor leaves the show, Hubbard had a picture of his likeness raised into the ABC News rafters. There was also a polka, sung to Hubbard&#x27;s dog Jake, and Jeremy received a cutout of his likeness as a going away present while also welcoming his replacement, Rob Nelson.

On January 24, 2011, &quot;World News Now&quot; debuted new graphics for all of the program&#x27;s segments and began using a new set, a side view of the existing set of &quot;ABC World News&quot;. On February 17 of that year, Nair announced that she would be departing as co-anchor of &quot;World News Now&quot; after the next night&#x27;s broadcast; the February 18 edition paid tribute to Nair in each of its three segments, including appearances from current and former colleagues including Jeremy Hubbard. Her legacy was to treat the crew to a hot breakfast on her last day. A brief send-off by Nelson to Nair was also given at the conclusion of &quot;America This Morning&quot;. Correspondent Peggy Bunker (then a former anchor at Fox affiliate KDVR, where Jeremy Hubbard incidentally is now employed) was named as interim successor.

On March 11, 2011, the program provided live coverage (in all time zones) of the devastating Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan, featuring updates and pictures from NHK World-Japan; the coverage continued during &quot;America This Morning&quot; and &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. On July 21, 2011, Bunker announced that she would be leaving &quot;World News Now&quot; after the July 22 broadcast, which acknowledged her departure in the first and last of its three, half-hour segments during that following night. In addition, a brief send-off by Nelson to Bunker (who subsequently became morning and midday anchor at Seattle ABC affiliate KOMO-TV) was given at the conclusion of &quot;America This Morning&quot;.

Beginning on July 25, 2011, ABC News correspondents Tanya Rivero, Diana Alvear and Linsey Davis began rotating as co-anchors alongside Nelson until a permanent co-anchor was named; this lasted until Rivero was named sole co-anchor of the program on September 19, 2011. On October 14, 2011, Rivero shifted to a correspondent role on ABC&#x27;s daytime news programs and was replaced by correspondent Yunji De Nies as a substitute anchor beginning the following day. On October 27, 2011, Paula Faris was named co-anchor of &quot;World News Now&quot;, taking over the role on January 2, 2012.

===2012–2020===
On January 6, 2012, the program celebrated its 20th anniversary. Clips and outtakes of the first two decades of &quot;WNN&quot; were shown throughout that night&#x27;s broadcast. On June 11, 2012, the longtime &quot;Morning Papers&quot; segment was replaced by &quot;The Mix,&quot; which instead of featuring offbeat headlines from various national and international newspapers, focused on stories trending online.

On January 18, 2013, Paula Faris announced that she would be departing &quot;World News Now&quot; after the January 22 broadcast; on the night Faris left the program, a brief send-off by Nelson to Faris was given at the conclusion of &quot;America This Morning&quot;. Diana Perez was named as Faris&#x27;s successor. On March 12, 2013, Rob Nelson announced that he would be leaving the program effective March 15, 2013, to become a full-time correspondent for ABC News. John Muller was named as successor.

Marci Gonzalez filled in for Diana Perez while she was on maternity leave from January 6 to March 26, 2014. Perez later announced on May 29, 2014, that she was leaving &quot;World News Now&quot; to spend time with her family; John Muller and the staff celebrated her tenure in all three half-hour segments during the May 30 editions, including a visit by former co-anchor Rob Nelson, who remarked that she was the last of 16 co-anchors he had served with on &quot;WNN&quot;. On June 12, 2014, John Muller announced he was leaving the program to return to his previous employer, New York&#x27;s WPIX, to become its lead news anchor. In October 2014, T. J. Holmes and Reena Ninan were appointed as co-anchors of &quot;World News Now&quot; and &quot;America This Morning.&quot; Ninan&#x27;s appointment became official on April 8, 2015.

Around August 2015, TJ left &quot;World News Now&quot; and &quot;America This Morning&quot; to focus on his contributions to other shows on the network. He &quot;unexpectedly&quot; left the show around August 7, 2015. Kendis Gibson has since served as co-anchor of the show.

On April 4, 2016, Reena announced she was leaving the show to work dayside. Reena had a special sendoff on April 8, 2016, and left the network for an anchor position at CBSN, the CBS online streaming news service. Diane Macedo, formerly of &quot;Imus in the Morning&quot;, took over as World News Now co-anchor, alongside Kendis Gibson.

On Friday, January 6, 2017, World News Now broadcast an elaborate 25th Anniversary special. All three half hours, except top of the show news summaries, were devoted to archival show clips and reminiscences by former anchors. Predictably irreverent, WNN creator David Bohrman and original anchor Lisa McRee were live in studio to comment on the show&#x27;s history. Barry Mitchell, accordion in tow, performed a special 25th Anniversary polka (&quot;The work we do&#x27;s important here, that&#x27;s what the bosses say/We&#x27;re warming up the cameras later on for GMA&quot;). Throughout the hour and a half, Bohrman, McRee and a cardboard cutout of Aaron Brown joined then current anchors Kendis Gibson and Diane Macedo at an on-set open bar, along with past and present World News Now staffers.

===2020-Present===
As of late summer 2020, a number of stations in major markets dropped World News Now in favor of daytime talk show reruns.
These include ABC-owned stations in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Raleigh, San Francisco, and Fresno. To quell viewer complaints in affected cities, the show pointed out that the complete broadcast can still be viewed online at 2am Eastern time, five days a week, at abcnews.com, in the &quot;Live&quot; window. World News Now is also live streamed by Hulu, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube and ABC News Live. Later in 2020, the decision was made to cease production of World News Now&#x27;s third half hour, cutting it down to two separate half hours, aired back to back from 2-3am Eastern time, and rerun from 3-4am Eastern time.

* Kicker story – a selected off-beat or human interest story
* What to Watch – A summary of stories to follow throughout the day (2009–present)

* The Mix – a soft media segment features off-beat stories, viral video clips and funny photographs (2012–present)

===&quot;B,&quot; &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot;-blocks===

After the A-block, the rest of the half-hour is produced using the following segments:
* Nightline – a rebroadcast of the primary story package from the previous night (or if aired on a Monday, the previous Friday)&#x27;s edition of &quot;Nightline&quot;.
* This Week (Monday mornings only) – a broadcast of the political discussion program&#x27;s &quot;Roundtable&quot; segment, featuring a debate of pundit from both sides of politics.
* ABC News Vault – a look back at how ABC News covered a story of historical importance, which usually corresponds to the date of the broadcast.
* American Landscape – Team coverage of a major national or international story from the perspective of a local ABC owned-and-operated station or affiliate that covered it, with excerpts from that station&#x27;s newscasts (commonly the late evening newscast). The segment, which is now rarely seen, is often edited for time (this is noticeable due to sudden jumps of the time/temperature bug used by certain stations whose segments are sourced, and jumps between and during story packages).
* GizWiz – Dick DeBartolo talks about and demonstrates the newest gadgets and technology.
* Viewers&#x27; Voice – a segment in which the anchors read viewer opinions about a specific topic from the program&#x27;s Facebook page or e-mail inbox.
* Insomniac Theater – Appearing on Fridays, the segment features a &quot;World News Now&quot; staff member giving their review (from a score of 1 to 5) of a recent movie release. This segment is ad-libbed and usually contains a SOT from the movie &quot;press kit&quot;. Previously, the films were reviewed by the anchors.
* Insomniac Kitchen – &quot;WNN&quot; anchors visit a local New York City restaurant to get ideas for late-night snacks that viewers can make at home.

===Special segments===

* Friday mornings close with some version of the &quot;World News Polka&quot; – usually performed by the song&#x27;s composer, comedian Barry Mitchell (most commonly, the version recorded in 1998) – aired while the show&#x27;s production credits are scrolled.
* When a full-time anchor of &quot;World News Now&quot; finally leaves the program, a ceremony of sorts is held on their last broadcast. As the first few anchors moved on, cardboard cutouts were placed in the rafters of the studio for the &quot;Anchor Hall of Fame.&quot; Today, this is done with a graphics sequence of a head-shot of the anchor moved into a graphic of the original set&#x27;s rafters and monitors.

===Former segments===

* Randomly, throughout the broadcast, a &quot;new e-mail&quot; sound effect will be heard. This is then followed by the ABC News announcer Bill Rice reading aloud an e-mail from a viewer. The anchors then respond (sometimes humorously) to the message.
* The National Temperature Index (NTI) – &quot;WNN&quot; featured the National Temperature Index (NTI), which is the sum of the day&#x27;s forecast high temperatures for Boston, Massachusetts; Casper, Wyoming; Dallas, Texas; Denver, Colorado; Fargo, North Dakota; Las Vegas, Nevada; Miami, Florida; New Orleans, Louisiana; Raleigh, North Carolina; and Seattle, Washington. The NTI appeared during nightly weather segments until January 6, 2003. It was reintroduced on January 5, 2007, but was dropped again one month later in mid-February. The NTI was originally discontinued when staff meteorologist Gerard McNiff revealed the method used for its calculation to San Francisco Bay Area meteorologist Jan Null, who published the formula in the &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot;.
* Leah at the Movies – a movie review segment in which now-former &quot;People&quot; magazine film critic Leah Rozen gave her top picks for the week&#x27;s new feature film releases, along with box office projections.
* Their News Now – a segment in &quot;World News Now&quot; anchors would check in with news producers at local ABC affiliates around the country each night to see what stories they were working on in their local market, or broadcast the first few minutes of an affiliate&#x27;s late local newscast during a breaking story (for instance, a blizzard in Buffalo, New York would have the opening of that night&#x27;s newscast on WKBW-TV shown), or occasionally for a British story pre-BBC America, the opening of that night&#x27;s &quot;BBC News BBC News at Ten&quot;. This was usually rotated between four or five local markets, which included Seattle and Denver, and was discontinued sometime in 2005 when &quot;American Landscape&quot; was expanded to a nightly segment.
* World News Now &quot;InsomniACTS&quot; – a music performance segment featuring local jazz bands, typically from around the New York City area, that were invited into the studio to play a number on-air.
* World News Knows – featured on some nights, a quick trivial knowledge fact was flashed on-screen following the conclusion of a commercial break.
* &quot;WNN&quot; also featured a full sportscast, which became a scene of comedic fodder for many anchors on the show since many of them did not have a great deal of experience calling sports highlights. This was later replaced by a scoreboard graphic displaying sports scores coming out of a commercial break, leaving time for more general segments.
* Asia Business Now – a daily segment summarizing overnight business news headlines from Asia, provided by Sumire Sugimoto, an anchor from Japanese broadcaster NHK; this was referenced in the early versions of the &quot;World News Polka&quot; as &quot;business news from Tokyo.&quot;
* Financial News from the BBC – a business news segments featuring anchors from the BBC (regularly reported by Declan Curry), presenting an update on the European financial markets from the London Stock Exchange; the BBC presenters typically stood in front of a video wall looking out on a London intersection, and sometimes a small counter at the bottom of the screen would note the number of double-decker bus that passed by in the background.
* World News Then – a presentation of news stories and segments from the ABC News program archives that related to or contrasted with a current event; as a bonus, the feature would also often include one of two television advertisements that aired during the original broadcast.
* Morning Papers – a segment featuring several different off-beat stories or funny pictures found in newspapers around the world; it was replaced in 2012 by &quot;The Mix&quot;, which is a more modern version using online stories (some of which may come from a newspaper&#x27;s website).

==Scheduling==

The show is produced and airs in two half-hour segments from 2:00 to 3:00 a.m. Eastern Time each Monday through Friday morning, and is transmitted in a continuous 60-minute tape delayed loop until 8:00 a.m. Eastern, when &quot;Good Morning America First Look&quot; begins in certain areas of the Pacific Time Zone. &quot;Good morning America First look&quot;– which uses the same production and anchor staff as &quot;World News Now&quot;, although the program is branded as a tie-in to &quot;Good Morning America&quot; – airs live to the network at 3:30 a.m. Eastern Time and is also tape delayed for many ABC stations. Most ABC stations do not air the entire program loop of &quot;WNN&quot; and preempt portions of the program in favor of airing locally slotted programming (usually infomercials or syndicated programs) – joining the program in progress anywhere from five minutes to as much as two hours after the start of the newscast – with affiliates looping the show until Good Morning America First Look airs.

Although most ABC stations clear &quot;World News Now&quot;, a small number of affiliates do not air the program:
* Oklahoma City affiliate KOCO-TV (also owned by Hearst) has aired the program since its debut; however from November 2010 to September 2012, it preempted the Monday edition of the program to air syndicated programming and infomercials – a pre-emption that resulted from the expansion of the station&#x27;s weekday morning newscast to 4:30 a.m., which resulted in the station pushing &quot;America This Morning&quot; ahead by a half-hour (prior to November 2010, the station aired a 25-minute block of the Monday edition joined in progress in-between an infomercial and &quot;America This Morning&quot;). KOCO began airing the full 90-minute block of the Monday edition, when that broadcast rejoined its schedule in September 2012, as it dropped certain syndicated programs and infomercials from its Sunday overnight schedule.
* WAWV in Terre Haute, Indiana (owned by Mission Broadcasting) did not clear &quot;World News Now&quot; when the station rejoined ABC in September 2011, following a 16-year absence of an over-the-air ABC affiliate in the market (it was an ABC affiliate at the time the program debuted, but operated as a Fox affiliate from 1995 to 2011); WAWV had to fulfill existing syndicated programming contracts instead of carrying &quot;WNN&quot; at first, which also included the pre-emption of the network&#x27;s Saturday morning children&#x27;s program block &quot;Litton&#x27;s Weekend Adventure&quot;. In the fall of 2013, WAWV began carrying &quot;WNN&quot; and &quot;LWA&quot; with the expiration of those syndication agreements.
* KTWO-TV in Casper, Wyoming and WVII-TV in Bangor, Maine have previously preempted the program in favor of airing a simulcast of the cable home shopping network Jewelry Television. Both channels have since added World News Now, as the Jewelry Television simulcast was dropped.
* Until September 2011, three ABC stations owned by Citadel Communications – KCAU-TV in Sioux City, Iowa, KLKN in Lincoln, Nebraska and WOI-DT in Ames, Iowa (Des Moines, Iowa) – pre-empted &quot;World News Now&quot;, as they all signed off the air during the overnight hours (as such, the three were among the few television stations remaining in the United States that did not operate on a 24-hour schedule). WLNE-TV in New Bedford, Massachusetts (Providence, Rhode Island), which was acquired by Citadel in April 2011, and prior to September, was the only Citadel-owned ABC affiliate that carried both a 24-hour schedule and cleared &quot;World News Now&quot;. KCAU and WOI have since been sold to Nexstar Media Group.
* WDAY-TV in Fargo, North Dakota and its satellite WDAZ-TV in Grand Forks, North Dakota chooses to carry paid programming and its local automated weather subchannel overnights instead.
* WOAY-TV in Oak Hill, West Virginia has chosen to run &quot;America This Morning&quot; in a loop from its original 3:30 a.m. airing, until its local news starts at 6 a.m. The channel now runs the second half of World News Now. 
* Over the summer of 2020, network O&amp;Os at first WPVI-TV in Philadelphia, then in late August 2020, New York flagship station WABC-TV dropped &quot;World News Now&quot; altogether after expanding their weekday late night offerings to include a rebroadcast of &quot;Live with Kelly and Ryan&quot; along with &quot;Daytime Jeopardy!&quot;, a rebroadcast of &quot;Tamron Hall&quot;, and the rebroadcast of &quot;World News Tonight&quot;. The station replaced the early Monday airing with a rebroadcast of &quot;This Week&quot; in September 2020 to complete the move.
* WATN-TV in Memphis, Tennessee has chosen to run local programming instead until its local news starts at 5:00 a.m.

==Anchors==
===Timeline===
==Criticism==
Occasional anchor Taina Hernandez has been criticized in the national press for laughing during various segments of the program, some of them dealing with serious stories. She laughed through the story of Owen Wilson&#x27;s attempted suicide in 2007, and she and co-host Ryan Owens have giggled through segments centering on terrorism and the Iraq War.

<doc id="664905" wikidata="Q1544389" url="?curid=664905" title="Martinism">
<text>Martinism is a form of Christian mysticism and esoteric Christianity concerned with the fall of the first man, his materialistic state of being, deprived of his own, divine source, and the process of his eventual (if not inevitable) return, called &#x27;Reintegration&#x27;.

As a mystical tradition, it was first transmitted through a Masonic high-degree system established around 1740 in France by Martinez de Pasqually, and later propagated in different forms by his two students Louis Claude de Saint-Martin and Jean-Baptiste Willermoz.

The term &quot;Martinism&quot; applies to both this particular doctrine and the teachings of the reorganized &quot;Martinist Order&quot; founded in 1886 by Augustin Chaboseau and Gérard Encausse (aka Papus). It was not used at the tradition&#x27;s inception in the 18th century. This confusing disambiguation has been a problem since the late 18th century, where the term &quot;Martinism&quot; was already used interchangeably between the teachings of Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin and Martinez de Pasqually, and the works of the first being attributed to the latter.

==Three branches==
Martinism can be divided into three forms through which it has been chronologically transmitted.

The Elus-Cohens or Elus Coëns. (Cohen is the Hebrew for &quot;priest&quot; and &quot;Elus&quot; means &quot;the elect&quot; or &quot;the chosen&quot;.) This was the first, and explicitly theurgical, way that &#x27;reintegration&#x27; was to be attained. The Elus-Cohens were founded by Martinez de Pasqually, who was Saint-Martin&#x27;s teacher. The original Elus-Cohens ceased to exist sometime in the late eighteenth or early 19th century, but it was revived in the 20th century by Robert Ambelain, and lives on today in various Martinist Orders, including the branch reinstigated by Ambelain himself.

In the highest of the three degrees of the Order of the Elus-Cohen, known as the Shrine, itself consisting of three degrees of which the highest was the Master Reau-Crois, evocation of entities belonging to the Divine Plane was carried out. This makes clear that the Elus-Cohen were not merely a mystical but a magical order. The chief evocation was that of the &#x27;Mender&#x27;, Jehoshua, and the basic methods were those of the Key of Solomon, including the use of circles, names of angels, planetary hours and symbols. The magical operations of the lower degrees were intended to establish contact between the operator and the Invisible World. Lofty and beautiful prayers recalled the goal which the Order tried to attain. There were also exorcisms intended to strangle demonic influence in the universe and thwart its powers over men, and to combat black magic.

The Scottish Rectified Rite or Chevaliers Bienfaisants de la Cité-Sainte (CBCS). This was originally a Masonic rite, a reformed variant of the Rite of Strict Observance which, in its highest degrees, uses Masonic-type rituals to demonstrate the philosophy which underlies both Martinism and the practices of the Elus-Cohens. The CBCS was founded in the late 18th century by Jean-Baptiste Willermoz, who was a pupil of Martinez de Pasqually and a friend of Saint-Martin. The CBCS has managed to survive as a continually practiced rite from its founding until the present day, both as a purely masonic rite, and as a detached rite which is also open to women.

The Martinism of Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin, a mystical tradition in which emphasis is placed on meditation and inner spiritual alchemy. Saint-Martin disapproved of these teachings being called &#x27;martinism&#x27; by his contemporaries, and instead explained it as a silent &#x27;way of the heart&#x27; to attain reintegration. Saint-Martin most likely did not organize this path as an &#x27;order&#x27;, but gathered small circles of students around him, where he transmitted his teachings.

In a nutshell, the Martinism as we know it today consists of the theurgic tradition of Martinez de Pasqually (Martinezism), the Masonic Templarism of Jean-Baptiste Willermoz (Willermozism) and the Christian Theosophy of Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin. This heritage was reorganized into the &#x27;Ordre Martiniste&#x27; in 1886 by Augustin Chaboseau and Gerard Encausse (also known as Papus).

==Martinezism: Martinez de Pasqually and the Elus Cohens==
Jacques de Livron Joachim de la Tour de la Casa Martinez de Pasqually was born in c. 1727 in Grenoble, France, and died in 1774 in Saint-Domingue while dealing with profane business. Martinez de Pasqually was active in Masonic organisations throughout France from the age of 28 onwards. In 1765 he established &quot;l&#x27;Ordre des Chevaliers Maçons Élus Coëns de l&#x27;Univers&quot; (Order of Knight-Masons Elect Priests of the Universe), which functioned as a regular Masonic obedience in France.

This order had three sets of degrees: the first were analogous to the symbolic degrees of conventional Freemasonry. The second were generally Masonic, though hinting at Pasqually&#x27;s own secret doctrine. The third set were blatantly magical: for example, by using exorcisms against evil in the world generally and in the individual specifically. In the highest degree, the &quot;Reaux-Croix&quot;, the initiate was taught to use Theurgy to contact spiritual realms beyond the physical.

De Pasqually put forth the philosophy underlying the work of the Elus-Cohens in his only book, &quot;Treatise on the Reintegration of Beings&quot;, which first uses the analogy of the Garden of Eden, and refers to Christ as &quot;The Repairer&quot;. The ultimate aim of the Elus-Cohen was to attain – whilst living – the beatific vision through a series of magical invocations and complex theurgic operations.

After Martinez de Pasqually&#x27;s death, the Elus-Cohens continued to operate for some time; however, divisions started to occur between various temples, which became dormant during the first half of the 19th century. The last-known surviving Elus-Cohen from the original incarnation of the order, Destigny, died in 1868.

==Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin==
Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin was born in 1743 in Amboise, France, and died in 1803. He was originally a barrister before taking a commission in the army at Bordeaux. Saint-Martin was initiated into the Elus-Cohens in 1768 and was active in the organization for at least six years. Saint-Martin was initiated into the Reaux-Croix, the highest degree of the Order, and in 1770 became de Pasqually&#x27;s secretary.

Saint-Martin became increasingly dissatisfied with the Elus-Cohens&#x27; use of theurgic ritual, feeling that it was too sophisticated for the desired end. Instead, he favoured inward contemplation, or what he called &quot;The Way of the Heart&quot;. Nevertheless, Saint-Martin continued to acknowledge Martinez de Pasqually&#x27;s influence on his own system of thought. In addition, Saint-Martin drew much inspiration from the work of Jakob Böhme.

In 1777, after failing to convince the Elus-Cohens to adopt a more contemplative practice, he cut back his involvement in the Order. He ceased all involvement in 1790.

Saint-Martin outlined his philosophy in several books , using the pen name of &quot;The Unknown Philosopher&quot;. These include:

* Ecce Homo
* &quot;Of Errors and Truth&quot;, 1775
* The Man of Desire
* The New Man
* &quot;Man, His True Nature &amp; Ministry&quot;
* &quot;Aphorisms and Maxims&quot;
* &quot;The Spiritual Ministry of Man&quot;
* &quot;Ten Prayers&quot;
* &quot;The Red Book&quot;
* &quot;Theosophic Correspondence&quot;
* &quot;Natural Table of the Correspondences between God, Man and the Universe&quot;, 1782

Note: the books with the name Man or l&#x27;homme in French are retellings of Saint-Martin of the main teachings of Martinez de Pasqually and what he learned in Martinezism mixed with Boehme. 

There has been some controversy over whether Saint-Martin himself ever founded a formalised Order of Martinists. For example, 20th-century Martinist author Robert Ambelain initially claimed that Saint-Martin founded an order called the &quot;Society of Initiates&quot;, but within a few years he became disillusioned with the concept and stated that the Society of Initiates never existed. Others allege that Saint-Martin became involved in a pre-existing society called the &quot;Order of Unknown Philosophers&quot;.

==Willermoz and the Scottish Rectified Rite==

Jean-Baptiste Willermoz (born 1730, Lyon, France; died 1824 also at Lyon), was initiated into Masonry at the age of 20 in a lodge which operated under the auspices of the Strict Observance. He was initiated into the Elus-Cohen in 1767, eventually attaining the highest degree of the Order, and being named by de Pasqually as a &quot;Superior Judge,&quot; one of its most senior officers.

Concerned about dissent in the order after the death of de Pasqually, Willermoz in 1778, together with two other Superior Judges, formulated the idea of creating two additional degrees for the Auvergne Province of the Strict Observance, which exemplified the philosophy, though not the theurgic practices, of the Elus-Cohens, while working in the Knight Templar-oriented milieu of the masonic rite. The name of the rite was changed to &quot;Chevaliers Beneficient de la Cité-Sainte&quot; (CBCS). The degree structure of the rite was thus:

#Apprentice
#Fellowcraft
#Master

Having reformed the French branch of the order, Willermoz in 1782 succeeded in persuading the German mother branch to adopt his reforms – though not without meeting considerable opposition from other branches of the Strict Observance, such as the Bavarian Illuminati of Adam Weishaupt.

The French Revolution curtailed the activities of the CBCS in France although the rite was preserved in Switzerland. Today the CBCS, or &quot;Scottish Rectified Rite&quot; (&quot;Rite Ecossais Rectifié&quot;) has several &quot;great priories&quot; throughout the world: Switzerland, USA., France, both the Waite&#x27;s &amp; Michael Herbert&#x27;s Great Priories in England, Germany, Belgium, Spain, Portugal and Brazil, with prefectures and lodges of Saint Andrew as well as Rectified Craft lodges existing in many places from Italy to Brazil to Romania.

==Papus and Chaboseau: the founding of the Martinist Order==

The disciples of Saint-Martin spread the Doctrine of the Unknown Philosopher in France, Germany, Denmark and above all in Russia. It was through one of them, Henri Delaage, that in 1880 a brilliant young Parisian doctor, Gerard Encausse (Later to be known as Papus), became acquainted with the doctrines of Saint-Martin. Subsequently, in 1884, together with some of his associates, he established a Mystical Order which he called the Ordre Martiniste or the Martinist Order.

The founding of the Order came about when Encausse met Augustin Chaboseau in 1884. In parallel, Stanislas de Guaita, in association with Papus and Pierre-Augustin Chaboseau founded the Ordre Kabbalistique de la Rose Croix in 1888. Papus and Chaboseau discovered that they had both apparently received Martinist initiation through two different chains of succession which linked back to Saint-Martin and his original disciples. Papus claimed to have come into the possession of the original papers of de Pasqually and to have been given authority in the Rite of Saint-Martin by his friend Henri Viscount Delaage. However, Encausse realised that there was a &quot;missing link&quot; in his own chain of succession: he and Chaboseau therefore &quot;swapped initiations&quot; to consolidate their lineages.

The Martinist Order which Papus founded was organised as a Lodge system, which worked four degrees:
#Associate
#Mystic
#Unknown Superior (S::I::/Supèrieur Inconnu)
#Unknown Superior Initiator (S::I::I::/Supérieur Inconnu Initiateur)(Lodge/Heptad Master).

Of these, the first two introduce the Candidate to key Martinist concepts, while the third supposedly confers the actual Initiation which Saint-Martin gave to his original disciples. Martinists generally believe that to be an authentic initiate, one must be able to show a chain of Initiatic Succession which goes back to Saint-Martin himself. However, Restivo states that &quot;Martinist authenticity is not contingent upon acceptance or initiation into a filiation or succession of other Martinists as no personal initiation chain from Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin exists in the sacramental manner of ordination as culmination of mastery in an Initiatic order.&quot;

About the rituals themselves, the following general points may be made:

* The mystical Christianity of Martinism is emphasised by the fact that all lodges are opened by invoking &quot;Yeheshuah&quot;, (Hebrew: יהשוה) i.e. the Pentagrammaton, consisting of the Tetragrammaton, with the addition of the Hebrew letter Shin, which was first suggested by Reuchlin as a Qabalistic way of spelling Jesus.
* Despite the Lodge structure of Martinism, the rituals themselves do not bear any resemblance to the symbolic degrees of Freemasonry. The rituals have their own milieu of dramatic and esoteric content. It has been claimed however that some of the rituals derived from the Egyptian Freemasonry of Cagliostro, and the Scottish Rectified Rite of Willermoz.
* The rituals contain elements of Martinez de Pasqually&#x27;s philosophy, and passing references to the Qabalah, in addition to principles derived from Saint-Martin&#x27;s own teachings.
* The candidate at key points throughout the rituals is expected to answer on his or her own initiative. He or she is constantly encouraged to meditate on the symbolism presented.
* The rituals often rely on the element of surprise to reinforce the points they make.

During the period up to the Second World War, the I::L:: or S::I::IV degree was exceptionally added as an endorsement or rank of distinction to the S::I::I:: degree for legates in new Martinist jurisdictions who were expected to eventually become Grand Masters. Later branches of the Martinist Order worked a fifth degree, I::L:: (Free Initiator/Initiateur Libre), which conferred on the candidate the power to initiate others into all four degrees in person, not requiring Lodge or Heptad group forms, and to establish a new and independent Martinist Order, as well as to act as the legate or representative or Grand Master of that new order. For example, the Rose+Croix Martinist Order (Ontario, Canada):

#Associate
#Mystic
#Unknown Superior (S::I::/Supèrieur Inconnu)
#Unknown Superior Initiator (S::I::I::/Supèrieur Inconnu Initiateur)(Lodge/Heptad Master)
#Free Initiator (I::L::/Initiateur Libre/S.I.IV) (Grand Officer/Grand Initiator).

==Italian Martinism==
Italian Martinism, rooted in the teachings of de Pasqually, Jean-Baptiste Willermoz, and Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin, gained prominence in Italy through figures like Eduardo Frosini (initiated in 1905), Arturo Reghini (1878–1946), and Gabriele D’Annunzio (1863–1938), who were initiated into the Martinist Order founded by Gérard Encausse (Papus) in 1891. Following Papus&#x27; death in 1916, the Italian Martinist movement split into factions, with some aligning with Saint-Martin’s mystical path and others with Martinez de Pasqually’s theurgical approach.

The Italian Martinist scene intersected with other esoteric traditions, most notably the Egyptian Memphis Rite. Giustiniano Lebano was initiated into the Martinist Order through the Egyptian Rite around the late 19th century. Figures like Vincenzo Soro (1895–1949) and Francesco Brunelli (1927–1982) also played key roles in the Italian Martinist movement.

==Modern Martinism==

In 1905, Tsar Nicholas II of Russia invited Papus to Tsarskoye Selo to ask for advice on domestic difficulties that he was facing with revolutionaries. The First World War was disastrous for the Order. Papus died on the battlefield fulfilling his duties as a doctor, as did many other leaders of the Order. After the war, the Order was almost extinct and the surviving members splintered into competing factions.

René Guénon was himself initiated in the Martinist Order. In between 1906 and 1912, Guénon was a member of Martinist Lodges &quot;Humanidad&quot; and &quot;Melchissedec&quot;, and published articles in &quot;L&#x27;Initiation&quot;, &quot;Revue Indépendante des Hautes Etudes Martinistes&quot;. The Congrès Spiritualiste held in Paris on 7–10 June 1908, and organized by Papus, with the presence of Victor Blanchard, Paul Veux, Paul Chacornac, Theodor Reuss, and Charles Détré &quot;alias&quot; Teder took place at the peak of the collaboration between Guénon and Papus. However, the regularity of the Martinist Order was strongly questioned by Brother O. Pontet of the Grand Orient de France. The creation by Guénon in 1909 of an &quot;Ordre du Temple&quot; within the premises of the Martinist Order, as well as his involvement in a Gnostic Church under the name &quot;Palingenius&quot; prompted the separation between Papus and Guénon.

Many French Martinists supported Karl Wilhelm Naundorff&#x27;s claims to the French throne. They joined the Synarchy movement and formed the Ordre Martiniste et Synarchie (OM&amp;S) under the leadership of Victor Blanchard. Both Imperators of The Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis (AMORC), Ralph Maxwell Lewis and Harvey Spencer Lewis were initiated into the Martiniste et Synarchie (OM&amp;S). AMORC Imperator Harvey Spencer Lewis held the title of Grand Inspector for the Americas as well as Sovereign Grand Master Legate for the United States and was granted a charter to establish Lodges in the United States. Lewis later decided not to proceed with the OM&amp;S plan for the U.S. due to the fact that Victor Blanchard was unable to produce all the required documentation. It turned out that the activities of the OM&amp;S were limited to the transmission of various Martinist Initiations, and that the Order otherwise had no actual existence. There was no Martinist Lodge in Paris at the time and Victor Blanchard gave his initiations in the temple of the &quot;Fraternitae des Polaires&quot;.

In 1931 Augustin Chaboseau joined Victor-Emile Michelet and Lucien Chamuel (the other two surviving members of the original Supreme Council of 1891) to resuscitate the Order that they had founded with Papus. To emphasise the difference between traditional Martinism and the many new groups that had emerged, they named their movement the Ordre Martiniste Traditionnel (OMT). Victor-Emile Michelet was elected Grand Master and Augustin Chaboseau succeeded him in 1939 until his death in 1946. AMORC Imperator Ralph Maxwell Lewis was asked by the OMT in 1939 to bring Traditional Martinism to the U.S. Lewis was thus appointed Sovereign Legate and Regional Grand Master of the OMT and received the necessary charters and other documents required in order to proceed with the Order&#x27;s expansion.

The Second World War was as disastrous for the Order in Europe as the first. The Nazi regime suppressed all &#x27;occult&#x27; groups and many Martinists died in concentration camps. The OMT in Europe and its American branch, the Traditional Martinist Order (TMO) still exist. The TMO currently operates in almost every free country in the world under the protection of AMORC. Martinism is still growing in popularity, and with the advent of the Internet, many new orders and online groups expressing an interest in Martinism have emerged worldwide.

The Martinist Order (L&#x27;Ordre Martiniste) founded by Papus in 1887 continues, and grows worldwide with Groups across Europe, Africa, the United States and the Middle East.

<text>Franco-Belgian comics, together with American and British comic books and Japanese manga, are one of the three main markets. The term is broad, and can be applied to all comics made by French and Belgian comics authors, all comics originally published by French and Belgian comics publishers, or all comics in the styles appearing in the Franco-Belgian comics magazines &quot;Tintin&quot; and &quot;Spirou&quot;, possibly expanded to include later magazines like &quot;Pilote&quot;, &quot;Métal Hurlant&quot;, and &quot;A Suivre&quot;. Comics which are not created in French but in Dutch are sometimes included and sometimes excluded from the Franco-Belgian comics.
For this list, a broad definition is taken, including all notable comics series first published by a French or Belgian publisher, no matter what language or nationality the authors have. For series with many different authors (e.g. &quot;Spirou &amp; Fantasio&quot;), only the most important authors have been included.

<doc id="664910" wikidata="Q3878469" url="?curid=664910" title="Norman Lamm">
<text>Norman Lamm (December 19, 1927 – May 31, 2020) was an American Modern Orthodox rabbi, scholar, academic administrator, author, and Jewish community leader. He was the Chancellor of Yeshiva University until he announced his retirement on July 1, 2013.

Lamm served as the third President of Yeshiva University, the first to be born in the United States. He was a disciple of Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik (one of Orthodoxy&#x27;s most influential modern scholars), who ordained him at the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary, Yeshiva University&#x27;s rabbinical school in 1951.

==Early life and education==
Lamm was one of four siblings and grew up in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. His father, Samuel, had several different jobs, including as a kosher inspector for New York state. His mother, Pearl (née Baumol), was descended from a respected rabbinic family. In his youth, Lamm attended Mesivta Torah Vodaath in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. He attended Yeshiva College, the men&#x27;s undergraduate school of Yeshiva University, and obtained a degree in chemistry in 1949 before working in a clandestine laboratory in upstate New York developing munitions for the newborn State of Israel. He was the secular studies valedictorian of his graduating class. In 1951, he was ordained as a rabbi at the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary, Yeshiva University&#x27;s rabbinical school. He also took graduate courses at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn (now the New York University Tandon School of Engineering). He considered a career in medicine but was persuaded by Rabbi Dr. Samuel Belkin, the second President of Yeshiva University (successor of Rabbi Dr. Bernard Revel), to join the faculty at Yeshiva University. Lamm later earned a Ph.D. in Jewish philosophy from Yeshiva University.

Lamm&#x27;s maternal grandfather was Rabbi Yehoshua Baumol (1880–1948), who authored the responsa entitled &quot;Emek Halakha&quot;. In that work, Baumol cited several insights from the then-young Lamm and responded to his questions. It was Baumol who encouraged Lamm to leave Mesivta Torah Vodaath to attend Yeshiva College, where Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik would become his mentor.

==Career==
Lamm spent almost 25 years as a pulpit rabbi. He was the Assistant Rabbi to Rabbi Joseph Lookstein of Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun in Manhattan, New York. His first pulpit was in Springfield, Massachusetts. He was appointed rabbi of the West Side Jewish Center (Congregation Beth Israel) in 1952; became an assistant rabbi at the Jewish Center on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in 1958; and then the senior rabbi of the Jewish Center from 1959 to 1976. In 1959, he also became a professor in Jewish philosophy at Yeshiva University.

In 1958, Lamm helped founded &quot;Tradition&quot;, an academic journal of Modern Orthodox thought. He also launched the &quot;Torah U-Madda Journal&quot;.

He obtained his Ph.D. in 1966 and was elected President of Yeshiva University in August 1976—succeeding Rabbi Samuel Belkin, YU&#x27;s second president. When he took over the institution, he helped save it from looming bankruptcy, raised its endowments, and led the school to a national top-100 school ranking. Lamm also played important roles in Jewish scholarship. At a time when ArtScroll was in financial trouble, Lamm introduced the publisher to philanthropist Jerome Schottenstein. The introduction led to the financial support from Schottenstein, whose namesake was bestowed on the Schottenstein English translation of the Babylonian Talmud.

Upon the establishment of the Simon Rockower Memorial Writing Competition by the American Jewish Press Association in 1980, Lamm was named the competition&#x27;s inaugural head.

== Personal life ==
Lamm was married to Mindella, who died of COVID-19 on April 16, 2020, at the age of 88. At the time of his death in May 2020, Lamm had two sons, Shalom and Joshua, and a daughter, Chaye Warburg. He had a second daughter, Sara Lamm Dratch, who died in 2013. He was also survived by 17 grandchildren and numerous great-grandchildren.

==Theology==
As a Modern Orthodox Jew, Lamm&#x27;s theology incorporated the corpus of classical rabbinic Jewish principles of faith. The faith that he preaches and teaches is consistent with these teachings. He believed that God exists, that God can reveal his will to mankind, and that the Torah (five books of Moses) is an exact transcription of God&#x27;s revelation to Moses on Mount Sinai. He believed that Judaism&#x27;s oral law, as recorded in the Mishnah and Talmud and subsequent rabbinical interpretation, represents an accurate and authoritative understanding of how God wants mankind to understand the Hebrew Bible. And, in accordance with standard Orthodox Jewish theology, he held that halakha, loosely translated as &quot;Jewish law&quot;, is normative and binding on all Jews.

===&quot;Torah Umadda&quot;===
One of Lamm&#x27;s major contributions was as a proponent of the idea of &quot;Torah Umadda&quot; - &quot;Torah and modern culture, or more generally, the environing culture of our days&quot; - a philosophical paradigm which aims at the confrontation of Torah learning and secular knowledge. He argued that the underlying philosophy of Torah Umadda is inspired by the work of Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch in the mid 19th century in response to the Enlightenment. He states that Torah Umadda and Hirsch&#x27;s Torah im Derech Eretz are to a large extent complementary - both value the acquisition of secular knowledge and both demand adherence to halakha.

===Centrist Orthodoxy===
Lamm was a well-known voice of &quot;Modern Orthodoxy&quot; (which is also known as Centrist Orthodoxy), regarding itself as the &quot;center&quot; between the &quot;left-wing&quot; branches of Orthodox Judaism, such as Rabbi Avi Weiss&#x27;s &quot;Open Orthodoxy,&quot; and right-wing&quot; movements such as Haredi Judaism. (Some writers have suggested a difference between the two terms &quot;Modern&quot; and &quot;Centrist&quot; Judaism — something Lamm dismissed as artificial.)

===Relationship with non-Orthodox Judaism===
Lamm was a strong critic of Reform Judaism&#x27;s attempt to unilaterally redefine Jewishness. In response to their declaration that a person can be considered Jewish with only a Jewish father and not a Jewish mother (in contrast with Rabbinic Judaism&#x27;s traditional stance that Judaism is passed on matrilineally, i.e., you are born Jewish if your mother is Jewish), Lamm stated that this was &quot;The single most irresponsible act in contemporary Jewish history.&quot; Nonetheless, he has worked over the years to keep lines of communication open between Orthodox and Reform Judaism, in the hopes that Jewish unity can be maintained. Lamm was a proponent of working with Reform and Conservative Judaism in the now-defunct Synagogue Council of America.

In a lecture before Klal, a &quot;mixed&quot; group of rabbis, he maintained that non-Orthodox rabbis are &quot;valid&quot; spiritual leaders of their congregants, whereas the Orthodox are &quot;legitimate&quot; religious leaders. &quot;Valid&quot; comes from the Latin word &quot;validus&quot; which means powerful, strong–and they are certainly strong and influential Jewish leaders who should be respected for their efforts. But only Orthodox rabbis can lay claim to &quot;legitimacy,&quot; a word which derives from Latin &quot;lex&quot;, law. Only one committed fully to the halakha can be considered Jewishly legitimate as a rabbi.

While strongly disagreeing with the theology and religious practices of non-Orthodox forms of Judaism, Lamm was one of the most outspoken leaders in Orthodoxy for cooperation with Conservative Judaism and Reform Judaism.
In 1989 and 1990 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir asked Lamm to help defuse the crisis related to the &quot;Who is a Jew?&quot; issue, which had erupted when a Reform convert wanted to make aliyah (emigration to the State of Israel). Lamm devised a solution for the denominational crisis which required delicate diplomacy as well as goodwill on all sides. In response to Lamm&#x27;s suggestion, Prime Minister Shamir appointed Israeli Cabinet Secretary Elyakim Rubenstein, later a member of the Supreme Court, who negotiated secretly for many months with rabbis from Conservative, Reform and Orthodox Judaism, including faculty at Yeshiva University, with Lamm as &quot;Rosh ha-Yeshiva&quot;. The plan called for the creation of a joint panel that interviewed people who were converting to Judaism and considering making aliyah (moving) to Israel, and would refer them to a beit din (rabbinic court of Judaism) that would convert the candidate following traditional halakha.

All negotiating parties came to an agreement that: (1) Conversions must be carried out according to halakha, (2) the beit din overseeing the conversion would be Orthodox, perhaps appointed by the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, and (3) there would be a committee consisting of representatives of all three groups to interview potential converts as to their sincerity. Many Reform rabbis took offense at the notion that the beit din must be strictly halakhic and Orthodox, but they acquiesced. However, when word about this project became public, a number of leading Haredi rabbis issued a statement denouncing the project, condemning it as a &quot;travesty of halakha&quot;. Rabbi Moshe Sherer, then the Chairman of Agudath Israel World Organization, stated that &quot;Yes, we played a role in putting an end to that farce, and I&#x27;m proud we did.&quot; Lamm condemned this interference by Sherer, stating that this was &quot;the most damaging thing that he [Sherer] ever did in his brilliant forty-year career.&quot;

Lamm wanted this to be only the beginning of a solution to Jewish disunity. He stated that had this unified conversion plan not been destroyed, he wanted to extend this program to the area of halakhic Jewish divorces, thus ending the problem of mamzerut.

In 1997 the issue of &quot;Who is a Jew?&quot; again arose in the State of Israel, and Lamm publicly backed the Neeman Commission, a group of Orthodox, Conservative and Reform rabbis working to develop joint programs for conversion to Judaism. In 1997 he gave a speech at the World Council of Orthodox Leadership, in Glen Springs, New York, urging Orthodox Jews to support this effort.

:Rabbi Lamm told his listeners that they should value and encourage the efforts of non-Orthodox leaders to more seriously integrate traditional Jewish practices into the lives of their followers. They should welcome the creation of Conservative and Reform day schools and not see them as a threat to their own. In many communities, Orthodox day schools, or Orthodox-oriented community day schools, have large numbers of students from non-Orthodox families. The liberal movements should be appreciated and encouraged because they are doing something Jewish, even if it is not the way that Orthodox Jews would like them to, he said. &quot;What they are doing is something, and something is better than nothing,&quot; he said in his speech. &quot;I&#x27;m very openly attacking the notion that we sometimes find in the Orthodox community that &#x27;being a goy is better&#x27;&quot; than being a non-Orthodox Jew, he said in an interview.

In his speech &quot;Seventy Faces&quot;, Lamm warns his listeners that there will be an &quot;unbridgeable and cataclysmic rupture within the Jewish community&quot; unless Jews from all the denominations, including Orthodoxy, listen to each other and try to find a way to work together. In this speech (now an essay) he rejects maximal ideas of religious pluralism, especially relativism. He denies that non-Orthodox Jews have halakhic legitimacy, explaining that their views on halakha do not have normative status. However, he goes on to affirm a moderate form of religious pluralism, and holds that Orthodox Jews must accept that non-Orthodox rabbis are valid Jewish leaders, and possess spiritual dignity. He holds that marriages that are officiated at by non-Orthodox Jews can be halakhically-valid if conducted in accordance with Jewish law, but not so non-Orthodox divorces (which require a beit din). Orthodox and non-Orthodox Jews must find ways to work together.

===Views on abiogenesis, evolution and science===
Originally trained as a scientist, Lamm maintained an interest in the interface between science and Judaism. In his 1971 essay &quot;The religious implications of extraterrestrial life,&quot; Lamm writes about scientific developments concerning abiogenesis and evolution, the creation of life on Earth, and the then-developing scientific consensus that life could possibly evolve on other planets outside of the Solar System (i.e. extraterrestrial life). He writes:

:... the fact remains that most of the highly respected scientists of our day, eminent in their fields, do believe that intelligent life exists elsewhere in the universe...

:No religious position is loyally served by refusing to consider annoying theories which may well turn out to be facts. Torah is &quot;a Torah of truth,&quot; and to hide from the facts is to distort that truth into a myth. Of course, it must be repeated that the theories here under discussion have not (yet) been established as true. But they may be: and Judaism will then have to confront them as it has confronted what men have considered the truth throughout the generations.

:Maimonides, over eight centuries ago, was faced with the widely accepted Aristotelian theory of the eternity of the universe, which ostensibly contradicted the Biblical conception of creation in time. Maimonides demonstrated that Aristotle had not conclusively proved the eternity of matter and that since eternity and creation were philosophically equally acceptable alternatives, he preferred to accept creation since this theory was the one apparently taught in Genesis. Nevertheless, Maimonides averred, were the Aristotelian theory convincingly proven, he would have accepted it and reinterpreted the verses in Genesis to accommodate the theory of the eternity of matter.

:It is this kind of position which honest men, particularly honest believers in God and Torah, must adopt at all times, and especially in our times. Conventional dogmas, even if endowed with the authority of an Aristotle – ancient or modern – must be tested vigorously. If they are found wanting, we need not bother with them. But if they are found to be substantially correct, we may not overlook them. We must then use the newly discovered truths the better to truly understand our Torah – the &quot;Torah of truth.&quot;

Lamm&#x27;s writings on this subject are prominently featured in the &quot;What Is Out There?&quot; featurette, on disk two of the two-disc special edition of &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. This featurette offers the views of various scientists and philosophers on the possibility of extraterrestrial life.

==Writings==
Lamm was the author of 10 books, and edited or co-edited over 20 volumes.

In 1971 Lamm wrote &quot;Faith and Doubt: Studies in Traditional Jewish Thought&quot;, which was released in a second edition in 1986 and a third and up-dated edition in 2006. This book is a personal examination of his religious beliefs.

In the 1980s many in Modern Orthodox Judaism felt battered by criticism from Orthodoxy&#x27;s theological right-wing. Many Orthodox Jews, notably HaRav Nissim Cahn, began to perceive Modern Orthodoxy as less compelling, and possibly less authentic, than Haredi Judaism. As such, Lamm wrote a principled theological defense of Modern Orthodoxy in &quot;Torah Umadda: The Encounter of Religious Learning and Worldly Knowledge in the Jewish Tradition&quot; and its theology of Torah in confrontation with Madda or &quot;Western Civilization&quot;.

In 1989, his doctoral thesis examining the theological-kabbalistic differences in the Hasidic-Mitnagdic schism was published as &quot;Torah Lishmah: Torah for Torah&#x27;s Sake in the Works of Rabbi Hayyim of Volozhin and His Contemporaries&quot;. Influences on Lamm came from both camps, with Rav Soloveitchik descended from Hayim Volozhin, main Mitnagdic theorist, who is compared with Hasidism&#x27;s theorist Schneur Zalman of Liadi.

In accompaniment, in 1999 Lamm published &quot;The Religious Thought of Hasidism: Text and Commentary&quot;, which offered an in-depth development of formative Hasidic thought, the mystical teachings of the movement founded in the 18th century by the Baal Shem Tov. Through examination of primary sources, Lamm illustrates the development of Hasidic theology in the 18th and 19th centuries. The book won the National Jewish Book Award in Jewish Thought.

In 2000 Lamm wrote &quot;The Shema: Spirituality and Law in Judaism&quot; for a general audience not familiar with Jewish theology; this work focused on how a proper understanding of Judaism would lead a practitioner to spirituality. This work was a rejoinder to the viewpoint that religious, observant Judaism was dry and legal, as opposed to spiritual and meaningful.

In addition to these, Lamm has written many essays on contemporary Jewish issues which were published in the journals &quot;Tradition&quot;, founded in 1958 by Lamm, and the &quot;Journal of Halacha and Contemporary Society&quot;.

==Retirement==
Lamm stepped down as president in 2003, and was succeeded by Richard Joel, who became the fourth President of Yeshiva University and the first layman to hold the office. Joel is a former attorney who also led the Bnai Brith&#x27;s international Hillel student organization. Joel had previously been associate dean and professor at Yeshiva University&#x27;s Cardozo Law School, and was an assistant district attorney in New York City.

Upon his retirement as president, Lamm was given the position of Chancellor of Yeshiva University. He maintained his title as &quot;Rosh HaYeshiva&quot; (&quot;head of the yeshiva&quot;) of Yeshiva University&#x27;s rabbinical school, RIETS for an additional ten years.

In July 2013, Lamm announced his retirement as chancellor and &quot;Rosh HaYeshiva&quot; after more than 60 years at Yeshiva University, and apologized for not responding more assertively when students at Yeshiva University High School for Boys said that two rabbis there had sexually abused them. After retirement Lamm left the spotlight of communal life. According to a family member Lamm suffered from an illness that affected his memory. Lamm died on May 31, 2020, in Englewood, New Jersey.

<doc id="664914" wikidata="Q918871" url="?curid=664914" title="British Columbia Highway 101">
<text>British Columbia Highway 101, also known as the Sunshine Coast Highway, is a long highway that is the main north–south thoroughfare on the Sunshine Coast in British Columbia, Canada.

Highway 101, which first opened in 1962, is divided into two separate land segments, with a ferry link in between. The highway is maintained by Capilano Highway Services. Despite its location on the mainland, the highway is unique for not being connected to the rest of the British Columbia highway system. Access to the highway can only be obtained by taking ferries from Horseshoe Bay to the south end in Gibsons or Comox to Powell River. Highway 101 between Langdale and Powell River is designated as a feeder route of the Canadian National Highway System. The highway is sometimes considered by locals to be an extension of the much more famous U.S. Route 101 that runs all the way to Los Angeles, however there is a 300 km gap between the two highways and the origin of the BC-101&#x27;s number may not be related to US 101.

==Route description==

The total distance of Highway 101, including the ferry link, is approximately . The vast majority of the highway is an exceptionally curvy undivided 2 lane route with few passing opportunities. In general the highway experiences low traffic volumes due to its rural nature and lack of connection to other highways. However much of Highway 101s daily traffic comes in waves timed to when the ferries arrives as a large amount of vehicle suddenly unload onto the highway. The speed limit on the Highway is 80–60 km/h in rural areas and 50 km/h in towns.

=== South Section ===
The highway begins in the south at the BC Ferries terminal at Langdale, which connects the Sunshine Coast to Vancouver via a ferry route across Howe Sound to Horseshoe Bay. The southern land section of Highway 101 is long. Immediately after leaving the Langdale Ferry terminal Highway 101 follows the Gibson&#x27;s Bypass, a long stretch of 4 lane divided highway that forms the only improved section of Highway 101. The Gibsons Bypass was built in 1995 and was originally intended to entirely bypass the town of Gibsons but the bypass currently abruptly terminates at a T intersection where Highway 101 traffic is forced to turn left onto a 2 lane route though the narrow streets and many signal lights of Gibsons&#x27;s small commercial area. After leaving Gibsons the highway travels a busy 2 lane route for though Roberts Creek, until arriving in the Sechelt, the only other major municipality in the area. In Sechelt the highway travels on a 4 lane Main Street before turning onto several other smaller community roads. North of Sechelt traffic on the highway thins out dramatically. For the next to the Earls Cove Ferry Terminal the highway curves though granite outcrops, past lakes and patches of rainforest mixed with small farms. Towns along the way include Halfmoon Bay and Pender Harbour and many smaller hamlets located on the ocean. Near the ferry terminal a small paved side road branches off to Skookumchuck Narrows. The ferry link across the Jervis Inlet lasts between Earls Cove to the south and Saltery Bay to the north.

=== North Section ===

The northern land section of Highway 101 curves its way along the Malaspina Strait through the hamlets of Stillwater and Lang Bay. It then enters the small city of Powell River forming its main street. It then crosses a narrow bridge over Powell Lake and soon enters the Tla&#x27;amin Nation Reservation. From there the highway downgrades to nothing more than a small rural road for the last to the community of Lund, where the highway ends at a boat ramp and dock for the Savary Island water taxi.

==Fixed link proposals==

The provincial government has conducted several feasibility studies on connecting Highway 101 to the Lower Mainland, as well as replacing the Earls Cove–Saltery Bay ferry. A study launched by the BC Liberal government in 2015 identified four proposals costing between $2.1 billion and $4.4 billion:

* A extension of Highway 101 along the west shore of Howe Sound that would connect to Highway 99 near Squamish.
* A extension of Highway 101 across Howe Sound on a pair of suspension bridges via the Anvil Island, with a connection to Highway 99 near Lions Bay. The Islands Trust opposes this option.
* A new highway connecting Powell River to Squamish with a pair of tunnels under the Coast Mountains.
* A highway link between the two sections of Highway 101 eliminating the ferry between Saltery Bay and Earls Cove via a pair of suspension bridges.

All four options were considered feasible, with positive cost to benefit ratios for the two bridge options. The study was inconclusive and recommended further analysis of the four options. The NDP government announced in December 2017 that the study would not move forward due to technical and financial issues.

<text>The Biba Model or Biba Integrity Model developed by Kenneth J. Biba in 1975, is a formal state transition system of computer security policy describing a set of access control rules designed to ensure data integrity. Data and subjects are grouped into ordered levels of integrity. The model is designed so that subjects may not corrupt data in a level ranked higher than the subject, or be corrupted by data from a lower level than the subject.

In general the model was developed to address integrity as the core principle, which is the direct inverse of the Bell–LaPadula model which focuses on confidentiality.

== Features ==
In general, preservation of data &quot;integrity&quot; has three goals:

* Prevent data modification by unauthorized parties
* Prevent unauthorized data modification by authorized parties
* Maintain internal and external consistency (i.e. data reflects the real world)

This security model is directed toward data &quot;integrity&quot; (rather than &quot;confidentiality&quot;) and is characterized by the phrase: &quot;read up, write down&quot;. This is in contrast to the Bell-LaPadula model which is characterized by the phrase &quot;read down, write up&quot;.

In the Biba model, users can only &quot;create content at or below&quot; their own integrity level (a monk may write a prayer book that can be read by commoners, but not one to be read by a high priest). Conversely, users can only &quot;view content at or above&quot; their own integrity level (a monk may read a book written by the high priest, but may not read a pamphlet written by a lowly commoner). Another analogy to consider is that of the military chain of command. A General may write orders to a Colonel, who can issue these orders to a Major. In this fashion, the General&#x27;s original orders are kept intact and the mission of the military is protected (thus, &quot;read up&quot; integrity). Conversely, a Private can never issue orders to his Sergeant, who may never issue orders to a Lieutenant, also protecting the integrity of the mission (&quot;write down&quot;).

The Biba model defines a set of security rules, the first two of which are similar to the Bell–LaPadula model. These first two rules are the reverse of the Bell–LaPadula rules:

# The Simple Integrity Property states that a subject at a given level of integrity must not read data at a lower integrity level (&quot;no read down&quot;).
# The * (star) Integrity Property states that a subject at a given level of integrity must not write to data at a higher level of integrity (&quot;no write up&quot;).
# Invocation Property states that a process from below cannot request higher access; only with subjects at an equal or lower level.

== Implementations ==
* In FreeBSD, the Biba model is implemented by the mac_biba MAC policy.
* In Linux, the Biba model is implemented in the General Dynamics Mission Systems PitBull product.
* In XTS-400, the Biba model is implemented in the BAE Systems&#x27;s XTS-400 operating system.

<doc id="664927" wikidata="Q1277319" url="?curid=664927" title="Donations of Alexandria">
<text>The Donations of Alexandria (autumn 34 BC) was a political act by Cleopatra VII and Mark Antony in which they distributed lands held by Rome and Parthia among Cleopatra&#x27;s children and gave them many titles, especially for Caesarion, the son of Julius Caesar. This was the second of two such donations; a similar donation ceremony had taken place two years earlier at Antioch in 36 BC, at which time the donations enjoyed Octavian&#x27;s full approval of the Antonine strategy of dominating the East by exploiting Cleopatra&#x27;s unique royal Ptolemaic lineage in the donated territories. Ultimately, the Donations (of 34 BC) caused a fatal rupture in Antonine relations with Rome and were one of the causes of the final war of the Roman Republic.

==Background==
The donations followed the failure of Antony&#x27;s military campaign in Parthia. Antony tried to play up his military success against Armenia and downplay his defeat by Parthia by staging a festival imitating a Roman triumph to celebrate his victory over the Armenian leader Artavasdes, who was led through the city of Alexandria in captivity. Antony then held a public banquet at which he dressed up as the god Dionysus. The captured Armenian royal family were brought before Cleopatra VII to prostrate themselves, but they refused to do so, incurring her wrath.

==Donations==
For the finale of the festivities, the whole city was summoned to the gymnasium of Alexandria, where Antony and Cleopatra, dressed as Dionysus-Osiris and Isis-Aphrodite, sat on golden thrones. Caesarion was depicted as Horus, son of Isis. The children were similarly in the attire of their new kingdoms. Antony confirmed Cleopatra as queen of Egypt, Cyprus, Libya and central Syria.

The Donations themselves included:
*Alexander Helios was named king of Armenia, Media and Parthia;
*his twin Cleopatra Selene II got Cyrenaica and Libya;
*the young Ptolemy Philadelphus was awarded Syria, Phoenicia and Cilicia;
*Cleopatra was proclaimed Queen of Kings and Queen of Egypt, to rule with Caesarion (Ptolemy XV Caesar, son of Julius Caesar)
*Caesarion was proclaimed the son of the deified Julius Caesar (son of god), King of Kings and King of Egypt; Caesarion was declared the legitimate heir of Julius Caesar, despite the fact that Caesar himself had adopted Octavian (later known as Augustus) in his will and left him most of his fortune.

==Consequences==
Antony sent an announcement of the donations to Rome, hoping that the Senate would approve them, but they refused. Octavian&#x27;s political position was threatened by the recognition of Caesarion as the legitimate heir to Caesar&#x27;s name. Octavian&#x27;s base of power was his connection to Caesar through adoption, which gave him much-needed popularity and the loyalty of the legions. Octavian stepped up his personal attacks on Mark Antony and Cleopatra, and the Second Triumvirate expired on the last day of 33 BC, not to be renewed. Thus began the last war of the Roman Republic, with Octavian&#x27;s victory ushering in the Imperial era.

<doc id="664931" wikidata="Q453351" url="?curid=664931" title="Christopher Latham Sholes">
<text>Christopher Latham Sholes (February 14, 1819February 17, 1890) was an American inventor who invented the QWERTY keyboard, and, along with Samuel W. Soule, Carlos Glidden and John Pratt, has been contended to be one of the inventors of the first typewriter in the United States. He was also a newspaper publisher and Wisconsin politician. In his time, Sholes went by the names C. Latham Sholes, Latham Sholes, or C. L. Sholes, but never &quot;Christopher Sholes&quot; or &quot;Christopher L. Sholes&quot;.

== Youth and political career ==
Born in Mooresburg, in Montour County, Pennsylvania, Sholes moved to nearby Danville and worked there as an apprentice to a printer. After completing his apprenticeship, Sholes moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1837, and later to Southport, Wisconsin (present-day Kenosha). On February 4, 1841, in Green Bay, he married Mary Jane McKinney of that town.
He became a newspaper publisher and politician, serving in the Wisconsin State Senate from 1848 to 1849 as a Democrat, in the Wisconsin State Assembly from 1852 to 1853 as a Free Soiler, and again in the Senate as a Republican from 1856 to 1857. He was instrumental in the successful movement to abolish capital punishment in Wisconsin; his newspaper, &quot;The Kenosha Telegraph&quot;, reported on the trial of John McCaffary in 1851, and then in 1853 he led the campaign in the Wisconsin State Assembly. Also noteworthy was Sholes&#x27; part in the massive railroad corruption scheme which permeated the legislature in 1856. Sholes was one of a small number of legislators who actually refused the bribe.

He was the younger brother of Charles Sholes (1816–1867), who was also a newspaper publisher and politician who served in both houses of the Wisconsin State Legislature and as mayor of Kenosha.

== The &quot;Voree Record&quot; ==
In 1845, Sholes was working as editor of the &quot;Southport Telegraph&quot;, a small newspaper in Kenosha. During this time, he heard about the alleged discovery of the Voree Record, a set of three minuscule brass plates unearthed by James J. Strang, a would-be successor to Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement. Strang asserted that this proved that he was a true prophet of God, and he invited the public to call upon him and see the plates for themselves. Sholes accordingly visited Strang, examined his &quot;Voree Record,&quot; and wrote an article about their meeting. He indicated that while he could not accept Strang&#x27;s plates or his prophetic claims, Strang himself seemed to be &quot;honest and earnest&quot; and his disciples were &quot;among the most honest and intelligent men in the neighborhood.&quot; As for the &quot;record&quot; itself, Sholes indicated that he was &quot;content to have no opinion about it.&quot;

== Inventing the typewriter ==


Typewriters with various keyboards had been invented as early as 1714 by Henry Mill and have been reinvented in various forms throughout the 1800s. It is believed that Sholes drew inspiration from the inventions of others, including those of Frank Haven Hall, Samuel W. Soule, Carlos Glidden, Giuseppe Ravizza and, in particular, John Pratt, whose mention in an 1867 &quot;Scientific American&quot; article Glidden is known to have shown Sholes. Sholes&#x27; typewriter improved on both the simplicity and efficiency of previous models, which led to his successful patent and commercial success.

Sholes had moved to Milwaukee and became the editor of a newspaper. Following a strike by compositors at his printing press, he tried building a machine for typesetting, but this was a failure and he quickly abandoned the idea. He arrived at the typewriter through a different route. His initial goal was to create a machine to number pages of a book, tickets and so on. He began work on this at a machine shop in Milwaukee, together with fellow printer Samuel W. Soule. They patented a numbering machine on November 13, 1866.

Sholes and Soule showed their machine to Carlos Glidden, a lawyer and amateur inventor at the machine shop who was working on a mechanical plow. Glidden wondered if the machine could not be made to produce letters and words as well. Further inspiration came in July 1867, when Sholes came across a short note in &quot;Scientific American&quot; describing the &quot;Pterotype&quot;, a prototype typewriter that had been invented by John Pratt. From the description, Sholes decided that the Pterotype was too complex and set out to make his own machine, whose name he got from the article: the &quot;typewriting machine&quot;, or &quot;typewriter&quot;.

For this project, Soule was again enlisted and Glidden joined them as a third partner to provide funding. The &quot;Scientific American&quot; article (unillustrated) had figuratively used the phrase &quot;literary piano&quot;; the first model that the trio built had a keyboard literally resembling a piano. It had black keys and white keys, laid out in two rows. It did not contain keys for the numerals 0 or 1 because the letters O and I were deemed sufficient:

 3 5 7 9 N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
 2 4 6 8 . A B C D E F G H I J K L M
 The first row was made of ivory and the second of ebony, the rest of the framework was wooden. Despite the evident prior art by Pratt, it was in this same form that Sholes, Glidden and Soule were granted patents for their invention on June 23, 1868 and July 14. The first document to be produced on a typewriter was a contract that Sholes had written, in his capacity as the comptroller for the city of Milwaukee. Machines similar to Sholes&#x27;s had been previously used by the blind for embossing, but by Sholes&#x27;s time the inked ribbon had been invented, which made typewriting in its current form possible.
At this stage, the Sholes-Glidden-Soule typewriter was only one among dozens of similar inventions. They wrote hundreds of letters on their machine to various people, one of whom was James Densmore of Meadville, Pennsylvania. Densmore believed that the typewriter would be highly profitable, and offered to buy a share of the patent, without even having seen the machine. The trio immediately sold him one-fourth of the patent in return for his paying all their expenses so far. When Densmore eventually examined the machine in March 1867, he declared that it was good for nothing in its current form, and urged them to start improving it. Discouraged, Soule and Glidden left the project, leaving Sholes and Densmore in sole possession of the patent.

Realizing that stenographers would be among the first and most important users of the machine, and therefore best in a position to judge its suitability, they sent experimental versions to a few stenographers. The most important of them was James O. Clephane of Washington D.C., who tried the instruments as no one else had tried them, subjecting them to such unsparing tests that he destroyed them, one after another, as fast as they could be made and sent to him. His judgments were similarly caustic, causing Sholes to lose his patience and temper. But Densmore insisted that this was exactly what they needed:


Sholes took this advice and set to improve the machine at every iteration, until they were satisfied that Clephane had taught them everything he could. By this time, they had manufactured 50 machines or so, at an average cost of $250 (equivalent to almost $5,000 in 2020). They decided to have the machine examined by an expert mechanic, who directed them to E. Remington and Sons (which later became the Remington Arms Company), manufacturers of firearms, sewing machines and farm tools. In early 1873, they approached Remington, who decided to buy the patent from them. Sholes sold his half for $12,000, while Densmore, still a stronger believer in the machine, insisted on a royalty, which would eventually fetch him $1.5 million.

Sholes returned to Milwaukee and continued to work on new improvements for the typewriter throughout the 1870s, which included the QWERTY keyboard (1873). James Densmore had suggested splitting up commonly used letter combinations in order to solve a jamming problem caused by the slow method of recovering from a keystroke: weights, not springs, returned all parts to the &quot;rest&quot; position. This concept was later refined by Sholes and the resulting QWERTY layout is still used today on both typewriters and English language computer keyboards, although the jamming problem no longer exists.

Sholes died on February 17, 1890, after battling tuberculosis for nine years. He is buried at Forest Home Cemetery in Milwaukee.

<doc id="664933" wikidata="Q697690" url="?curid=664933" title="2004 Taiwanese legislative election">
<text>The 2004 Taiwanese legislative election was held on 11 December 2004. All 225 seats of the Legislative Yuan were up for election: 168 elected by single non-transferable vote, 41 elected through party-list Proportional representation, eight elected from overseas Chinese constituencies on the basis of the proportion of nationwide votes received by participating political parties, eight elected by popular vote among the aboriginal populations. Members served three-year terms beginning on 1 February 2005, and ending 31 January 2008. The next term served four years.

This was the first election following Pan-Blue coalition candidate Lien Chen&#x27;s narrow defeat in the presidential election in March. With the results of the presidential election still contested, many saw the legislative election as a referendum on Chen Shui-bian&#x27;s Government and on the Pan-Blue Coalition&#x27;s electoral viability. With the failure of the Pan-Green Coalition to win a majority, President Chen Shui-bian found it difficult, as in the past, to enact his policies.

==Campaign issues==
In the 5th Legislative Yuan (2002–2005), the opposition pan-blue coalition held a narrow majority, resulting in much of government-sponsored bills being deadlocked or heavily amended. The pan-blue coalition strongly argued that having a majority pan-green legislature would lead to a &quot;super-president&quot; while the pan-green coalition stated that a majority pan-green legislature was necessary to prevent deadlock and chaos and to finally eliminate the vestiges of the KMT&#x27;s previous authoritarian government on Taiwan.

A major issue of the election was whether to amend or replace the Constitution of the Republic of China. In his second inaugural address in May 2004, President Chen Shui-bian proposed to hold a referendum in 2006 on an entirely new constitution to be adopted in 2008. The Pan-Green Coalition argued that the current constitution, drafted by the Kuomintang in mainland China in 1947, is outdated and unfit for Taiwan as it was originally designed for all of China. Though President Chen promised not to change the sovereignty status of the Republic of China (which still officially claims all of mainland China and Mongolia), the symbols of the Republic of China, or to declare an independent Taiwan, this proposal drew intense criticism from the People&#x27;s Republic of China, which saw a new Constitution as a means to further the separation of Taiwan from the mainland. In Taiwan there is a general consensus across party lines that the Constitution needs reworking, but disagreement on the degree and type of reform. The Pan-Blue Coalition opposes enacting a new constitution, seeing the act as unnecessary, but supports amending it. In the summer of 2004, the legislature overwhelmingly passed a series of proposed constitutional amendments to halve the size of the legislature and abolish the National Assembly, among other measures. These measures will have to be approved by the National Assembly (elected &quot;ad hoc&quot; from the results of the 2004 election).

In addition, other issues were Chen&#x27;s accusations of a soft coup after his March 2004 victory, as well as legal efforts (which most consider unlikely to succeed) by the leaders of the pan-blue coalition to overturn the results of the March presidential election. In a related issue, there were concerns that the 3-19 shooting incident was staged; an investigatory committee established by the legislature (only by overriding a cabinet veto) was criticized by the pan-green coalition, which refused to appoint any of its members to the committee as mandated by law.

Another initiative that was discussed was a US$18 billion arms deal with the United States. President Chen regarded the arms deal as necessary for the defense of Taiwan against China, but the Pan-Blue Coalition has blocked the deal from passing the legislature, arguing the money should be spent on other measures.

President Chen also complained that the party emblem of the KMT is too similar to the national emblem of the Republic of China, and if the KMT does not change its emblem, a newly elected pan-green legislature will force it. (In response, the KMT noted that its emblem has existed before the ROC and challenged the government to change the national emblem instead.) Chen announced on December 5 that state-owned enterprises and foreign offices bearing the name &quot;China&quot;, such as the Chinese Petroleum Corporation, would be renamed to bear the name &quot;Taiwan&quot;. The U.S. government objected to this proposal, saying it would &quot;unilaterally change Taiwan&#x27;s status&quot;, but the DPP argued it is meant to avoid confusion and was not politically motivated. Chen reacted to the American concerns by blasting the United States. This appeared to cause a great deal of consternation among American officials with one analyst stating bluntly that President George W. Bush was &quot;more than a little irritated&quot; by Chen.

During the campaign, the KMT had been laying off workers and shedding millions of dollars&#x27; worth of assets it accumulated when it monopolized power. Analysts say the downsizing was prompted by fear that a DPP-controlled legislature might call for new investigations of the party&#x27;s finances.

==Campaign tactics==
The legislative elections were the last in Taiwan using the single non-transferable vote, as a constitutional amendment was passed in 2005 to convert the election format in the next legislative elections. The new electoral system supported by KMT and DPP, created interesting strategies such as vote allocation, as parties did not want to nominate too many candidates for a district, out of fear that it would divide party votes among too many candidates. In addition, the voting method resulted in complex negotiations between parties with similar ideological beliefs. The need to allocate votes resulted in a system in which political parties took out newspaper ads telling supporters how to vote based on their birthday.

The leaders of the KMT, PFP, and New Party, which all share similar political views, expressed concern over overcrowding. In 2001 elections, the DPP won 40% of the seats even though they only polled 36% of the vote, due in large part to the inability of the KMT, PFP, and New Party to coordinate their electoral strategies. To maintain its majority of the Pan-Blue Coalition, Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party Chairman James Soong proposed in May 2004 to merge their parties. In the election, the New Party ran seven of its eight candidates (the minimum number required to form a legislative caucus) under the KMT banner to avoid splitting the vote though their campaigns were funded and organized by the New Party. However, one candidate—Wu Cheng-tien of Kinmen, whose strongly Chinese unification-supporting district was considered safe—ran and won as a New Party candidate to signify the party&#x27;s continued existence.

Similarly, negotiations between TSU &quot;Spiritual Leader&quot; Lee Teng-hui and Chen Shui-bian occurred, presumably over calls for the TSU and DPP avoid splitting up their votes but not much occurred towards this result.

However, the dynamics of the election have permitted intra-coalition competition, either from candidates not wanting to be &quot;sacrificed&quot; to more popular candidates in another party or from party leaders seeking to increase their proportional representation. For example, the Lee Teng-hui criticized President Chen Shui-bian for equating the &quot;Republic of China&quot; with &quot;Taiwan&quot; saying &quot;If we continue to use the &quot;Republic of China&quot; as the nation&#x27;s title, China may view our nation (as a rebellion group)...Taiwan itself is a nation&quot; while campaigning for a TSU candidate in danger of losing the race to five other DPP candidates.

Faced with defections by independence supporters to the TSU accusing the DPP as being too moderate (President Chen&#x27;s senior adviser for international affairs, Lai Shin-yuan, resigned from the administration and won a seat as a TSU candidate), President Chen seemed to be moving his party&#x27;s campaign towards stronger support for Taiwan independence, calling for the renaming of state-owned enterprises. This strategy seemed to have worked in preventing defections to the TSU—the TSU, predicted to increase its presence to as many as 20 seats instead lost its membership by one seat. However, this might have alienated the center of the electorate and contributed to Pan-Green&#x27;s overall defeat.

==Results ==
The pro Republic of China conservative Pan-Blue Coalition (consisting of the Kuomintang, People First Party, and New Party) retained its majority in the legislature, winning 114 seats, compared to 101 seats won by the Taiwan independence-leaning Pan-Green Coalition (consisting of the Democratic Progressive Party and Taiwan Solidarity Union). The remaining ten seats went to independents and other groups.

A significant result was that voter participation was only 59% and was markedly lower than in previous elections (80% in the previous presidential election). Many commentators were concerned about this as it seemed to reflect public disillusionment with the tone of politics on Taiwan. The election also appeared to call into question the accuracy of public opinion polls, most of which failed to project a pan-blue victory just as they failed to predict the election of Chen Shui-bian. The DPP itself predicted that the pan-green coalition would capture 113 seats, and the TSU predicted that it would win at least 25 seats. On the other hand, the KMT underestimated itself by predicting that the pan-blue coalition altogether would win 109 seats.

Among the notable candidates elected, independent candidate Li Ao won a legislative seat, whereas former DPP chairmen turned pan-blue supporter Shi Ming-teh and Hsu Hsing-liang failed to get elected in their seats. Also of interest is a non-party legislator from Yunlin County, Chang Li-shan, the sister of the former county magistrate who was captured by the police the day before the election on corruption charges.

In their post-election speeches, all of the party spokesman called for moderation as well as unity and cooperation between the parties. Significantly, the pan-blue coalition consistently referred to the country by its legal name of the Republic of China whereas pan-green referred to the country with the term Taiwan.

==Analysis==
Although the party strengths were similar to the election of the 2001 ROC legislative election, but the results were widely seen as a major defeat for President Chen Shui-bian, who had campaigned hoping for an absolute majority for the pan green coalition. Reasons for the result included:

* tactical voting strategies – the pan-blue coalition greatly limited the number of candidates nominated while the pan-green coalition nominated a very large number of candidates. This had a major impact on the result due to the Taiwanese electoral system. In addition, the DPP nominated a large number of new unknown candidates, in part because the big names in the DPP were in the government, whereas the pan-blue coalition, being in opposition, found it easier to nominate people with a large amount of name recognition. The DPP&#x27;s strategy was to &quot;slit the throats&quot; (割喉) of the pan-blue coalition by dominating the government with many candidates, following their success in the presidential election. After the election, there was a consensus that this strategy seriously backfired. While the number of seats that the DPP and TSU gained was similar to that of 2001, many experienced and famous DPP and TSU legislators lost their seats.
* intra-coalition cooperation – many observers noted that the parts of the pan-blue coalition were much more adept at cooperating than the parts of the pan-green coalition. In particular, the NP ran seven of its candidates under the KMT banner and only ran one under NP in sure-win Kinmin county (Quemoy). Also, the PFP was willing to give up seats in order to improve the results of the overall coalition whereas the TSU was not as willing to coordinate in this way with the DPP. James Soong, leader of the PFP, was quoted earlier as stating that he was willing to have the KMT win all of the seats in the pan-blue coalition if this was necessary to keep the pan-blue in power, whereas the TSU actively campaigned for a large number of seats and in some cases sharply criticized the DPP, and Lee Teng-hui urged the husband from each household to vote for DPP, and the wife to vote for TSU so both parties would have equal representation.
* pan-green emphasis on symbolic issues of Taiwan independence – Although the pan-green coalition began the campaign focusing on good governance and reform issues, as the campaign progressed the pan-green coalition focused more on the symbolic issues of Taiwan independence such as calling for referendum, removing the name &quot;China&quot; from state owned corporations and schools, moving the history of the ROC to a section on general Chinese history in textbooks, demanding that the KMT change its party emblem, which is similar to the national emblem. While these efforts were intended to placate the voters of the TSU, most analysts feel that they did nothing to attract more moderate voters.

Although the pan-green coalition improved both their seat totals and their vote percentage over the last election, the legislative elections were widely interpreted as a major defeat for the pan-green coalition, given their goal of gaining a majority of seats in the Legislative Yuan. In the aftermath of the election, Chen Shui-bian resigned as chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party and was replaced by Su Tseng-Chang.

Some of the consequences of the election were:

* the election established the Kuomintang as senior party within the pan-blue coalition and set the stage for the merger between all of the parties within the pan-blue coalition into a new Kuomintang. Seven of the KMT candidates were actually members of the New Party, and it is expected that a merger between the New Party and the KMT will occur very soon after the election. Somewhat more difficult is the planned merger between the KMT and PFP. These mergers are widely seen as essential due to the electoral changes that will occur in the next legislative elections. In addition, the elections appeared to end speculation that the KMT was about to collapse, calls for the resignation of Lien Chan, and calls for the KMT to drop some of the &quot;China&quot;-based symbols.
* the victory of the pan-blue coalition also strained the relationship between the KMT and PFP. Although cooperating with the KMT before the election, after the election PFP Soong Chu-yu complained about his parties poor showing and began moving toward cooperation with the DPP.
* the election completely marginalized candidates outside the pan-blue and pan-green coalitions. Even candidates such as Shi Ming-teh and Hsu Hsin-liang, who both served long prison terms during the democratization movement of Taiwan and were pivotal in the Kaohsiung Incident but have since distanced away from the DPP, were defeated. Out of a total of 154 candidates from both the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union and Non-Party, only 10 were elected.
* after the election, the PRC announced that it would pass an Anti-Secession Law. Most Western observers have stated that this was intended as a harsh measure to counteract an expected pan-Green coalition victory, but that when the election results were unexpectedly favorable to the PRC, that the planning for the law had been too far advanced to stop completely.

<doc id="664946" wikidata="Q172480" url="?curid=664946" title="Isaac of Armenia">
<text>Isaac or Sahak of Armenia ( – ) was the catholicos (or patriarch) of the Armenian Church from until . He is sometimes known as &quot;Isaac the Great&quot; or &quot;Sahak the Parthian&quot; () in reference to his father&#x27;s Parthian origin. He was the last Armenian patriarch who was directly descended from Gregory the Illuminator, who converted the Kingdom of Armenia to Christianity in the early fourth century and became the first head of the Armenian Church. He supported Mesrop Mashtots in the creation of the Armenian alphabet and personally participated in the translation of the Bible into Armenian.

== Early life ==
Isaac was born to the future Catholicos Nerses I (). Through his father he was a descendant of Gregory the Illuminator, who converted the Kingdom of Armenia to Christianity in the early fourth century and became the first head of the Armenian Church. Since that time, the descendants of Gregory had held the office of catholicos of Armenia hereditarily, with some interruptions. According to the anonymous &quot;Vita&quot; of St. Nerses, Isaac&#x27;s mother was a Mamikonian princess called Sandukht, whom Nerses married in Caesarea prior to his consecration as catholicos. The &quot;Vita&quot; claims that Sandukht died after giving birth to Isaac. Another source, the &quot;Buzandaran Patmutʻiwnkʻ&quot;, neither names Nerses&#x27;s wife nor mentions his time in Caesarea, while Movses Khorenatsi writes that Nerses married the daughter of &quot;the great noble Aspion&quot; (who is not known from other sources) in Constantinople.

During his father&#x27;s patriarchate, Isaac studied for many years in Caesarea, Alexandria, and Constantinople. He learned Greek, Syriac and Persian. The Armenian historian Ghazar Parpetsi writes of him that he studied &quot;among many learned Byzantines&quot; and was &quot;fully versed in musical notation, exhortatory rhetoric, and especially philosophy. He was later consecrated as a bishop and preached with his sixty students at Etchmiadzin Cathedral. His father died in , purportedly poisoned by the Arsacid king of Armenia Pap. At some point, Isaac had a daughter named Sahakanoysh, who later married Hamazasp Mamikonian. It is assumed that his wife died before he became catholicos.

== Patriarchate ==
=== Election and first deposition ===
Isaac was elected catholicos after the death of his predecessor, Aspuraces. He supported King Khosrov IV of Armenia in his efforts to reunite the Armenian realm, which had been partitioned into Roman and Sasanian parts in 387. Khosrov was imprisoned by the Sasanian king in about 389, possibly because of his nomination of Sahak as catholicos without Persian approval. After Khosrov&#x27;s imprisonment, Isaac was deposed as catholicos, but Khosrov&#x27;s successor Vramshapuh managed to have him restored to his position. 

Through Isaac&#x27;s efforts the churches and monasteries destroyed by the Persians were rebuilt, education was cared for in a generous way, Zoroastrianism which Shah Yazdegerd I tried to set up was cast out, and three councils held to re-establish ecclesiastical discipline. The catholicos was noted for his ascetic lifestyle. 

=== Creation of the Armenian alphabet ===

Prior to the invention of the Armenian alphabet, the languages of the Armenian Church were Greek and Syriac. Armenia had been divided into Roman and Sasanian client kingdoms in 387. In the Roman part, however, the Armenians were forbidden the use of the Syriac language and used Greek instead, and the country gradually Hellenized; in the Persian part, on the other hand, Greek was absolutely prohibited, while Syriac was used. In this way the ancient culture of the Armenians was in danger of disappearing and national unity was seriously compromised.

Isaac encouraged Mesrop Mashtots to invent the Armenian alphabet and himself translated and revised parts of the Bible. According to Ghazar Parpetsi, Mashtots and the first translators frequently turned to Isaac, who had received a solid education, for assistance while making the alphabet. Their translation from the Syriac Peshitta was revised by means of the Septuagint, and even, it seems, from the Hebrew text (between 410 and 430). The liturgy also, hitherto Syrian, was translated into Armenian, drawing at the same time on the liturgy of Saint Basil of Caesarea, so as to obtain for the new service a national color. Isaac had already established schools for higher education with the aid of disciples whom he had sent to study at Edessa, Melitene, Constantinople, and elsewhere. Through them he now had the principal masterpieces of Greek and Syrian Christian literature translated, e.g., the writings of Athanasius of Alexandria, Cyril of Jerusalem, Basil, Gregory of Nazianzus, Gregory of Nyssa, John Chrysostom, Ephrem the Syrian, and others. The invention of the Armenian alphabet sped up the process of the Christianization of the Armenian population.

=== Second deposition and death ===
In 428, the last Arsacid king of Armenia Artashir was deposed by the Sasanian king with the help of most of the Armenian nobles. Isaac was against this and was himself removed from his position as Catholicos. An Armenian named Surmak was appointed in his place but was soon replaced by the Syrian bishop Brkisho. Isaac was imprisoned in Ctesiphon until 432, when he was allowed to return to Armenia and occupy certain offices within the church. Isaac refused to retake the patriarchate after the death of Catholicos Samuel, Brkisho&#x27;s Syrian successor, in 437. 

Isaac died around 438 in the village of Blur in Bagrevand. His body was taken to Taron and buried in Ashtishat. Since Isaac was the last male of the Gregorid line, his house&#x27;s territories of Taron, Bagrevand and Acilisene passed to the Mamikonians through Isaac&#x27;s daughter Sahakanoysh, who was married to the Mamikonian prince Hamazasp.

== Works ==
According to Abraham Terian, the identifiable works attributed to Isaac consist of canons and his two letters to Archbishop Proclus of Constantinople and Bishop Acacius of Melitene. The letter to Proclus is co-authored with Mashtots and concerns confessional matters. It is a reply to a letter sent by Proclus (&quot;Epistola II: Ad Armenios, de fide&quot;) to the Armenian clergy, which has been preserved in Greek and Armenian translation. The letter to Acacius is also a reply; Acacius&#x27;s letter to Isaac, and another addressed to the Armenians, have been preserved in Armenian. Some authors have doubted the authenticity of the canons attributed to Isaac, although, according to Terian, these doubts are unjustified. Movses Khorenatsi&#x27;s history quotes letters from Sahak to Eastern Roman emperor Theodosius II, the consul Anatolius, and Archbishop Atticus of Constantinople. Isaac is said to have been the author of liturgical hymns. Four sermons in the Armenian book of hours (&quot;zhamagirk&quot;) and many hymns (&quot;sharakans&quot;) are attributed to him.

== Veneration ==
Isaac is venerated as a saint in the Armenian Apostolic and Roman Catholic churches. In the Armenian Apostolic Church, his memorial day is marked twice a year: first, on the Saturday preceding the penultimate Sunday before Lent, thus falling between January 24 and February 28; second, together with Saint Mesrop Mashtots, on the Thursday following the fourth Sunday after Pentecost, thus falling between June 1 and July 16.

== Vision ==
The end of the first section of Ghazar Parpetsi&#x27;s history contains a description of a vision supposedly seen by Sahak and narrated by him after he refused the request of the Armenian nobility to return to the patriarchal throne. In the vision, Sahak saw various symbols connected with the Church and faith and saw that the Arsacids of Armenia and Gregorids would fall from power and apparently disappear; however, after a period of chaos both would be restored to their respective thrones; his daughter Sahakanoysh would give birth to &quot;powerful and pious men.&quot; The passage about Sahak&#x27;s vision is thought by some scholars to be a later interpolation into Ghazar&#x27;s sixth-century history, although Gohar Muradyan considers it possible that Ghazar himself wrote it, perhaps drawing from an existing source. Sahak&#x27;s vision was repeated in many Armenian works and was translated into Greek and thence into Georgian. Some connected it with events in their own time, even as late as the end of the seventeenth century.

<text>Noojee is a town in the Gippsland region of Victoria, Australia, north of Warragul and east of Melbourne, in the Baw Baw local government area. At the 2016 census, Noojee and the surrounding area had a population of 157. The town benefits from tourists passing through to the Mount Baw Baw Alpine Resort, 48 kilometres away, as it is the last stop with tourism services. There are also a number of walks in the area, including the Noojee Trestle Bridge, a 100m wooden rail bridge.

==History==
&quot;Noojee&quot; is an Aboriginal word meaning &quot;valley of or place of rest&quot;.

It was first settled after gold was found in the area in the 1860s. Noojee became a major timber town when the railway connected the town to Warragul in 1919. Noojee Post Office opened on 3 May 1920, though an earlier office had been open between 1902 and 1904.

The town was destroyed by bushfires in 1926 and again in the Black Friday fires of 1939. The only building left standing after both fires was the Noojee Hotel which served as community meeting point during the emergency. The hotel also served as the school after the one room school was destroyed.

==Economy==
Noojee is well known for its trout fishing. A trout farm is located on the outskirts of the town.

<text>Victor Charles Buono (February 3, 1938 – January 1, 1982) was an American actor, comic, and briefly a recording artist. He was known for playing the villain King Tut in the television series &quot;Batman&quot; (1966–1968) and musician Edwin Flagg in &quot;What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?&quot; (1962), the latter of which earned him Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations. He was a busy actor from his late teens until his death at the age of 43 and, with his large size and sonorous voice, he made a career of playing men much older than he was.

==Early life and career==
Buono was the son of Victor F. Buono. His father was a former police officer and bail bondsman who was sentenced to life imprisonment after being found guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit robbery in 1959. Released on parole after seven years but forced to serve a further sentence due to a previous conviction for bird smuggling, Victor Sr. continued to manage the affairs of his son while in prison.

Buono started appearing on local radio and television stations, and at age 18 joined the Globe Theater Players in San Diego. The director had confidence in Buono and cast him in &quot;Volpone,&quot; &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; and other Globe presentations. He received good notices for his various Shakespearean roles and in modern plays such as &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot; and &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot;.

In the summer of 1959, a talent scout from Warner Bros. saw the heavy-set Buono play &quot;Falstaff&quot; at the Globe and took him to Hollywood for a screen test. Buono made his first network TV appearance playing the bearded poet Bongo Benny in an episode of &quot;77 Sunset Strip.&quot; Over the next few years, he played menacing heavies in series on TV and appeared on &quot;The Untouchables.&quot; After appearing in a few uncredited film roles, he was cast by director Robert Aldrich in the psychological horror film &quot;What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?&quot; (1962). The film starred Bette Davis and Joan Crawford and Buono played the hapless musical accompanist Edwin Flagg, a performance for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture.

===Noteworthy film roles===
Shortly after &quot;What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?&quot;, Buono appeared in &quot;Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte&quot; (1964) as Big Sam Hollis, the father of Bette Davis, who played the title role. The film was also directed by Aldrich. In the Biblical epic &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; (1965), Buono portrayed the High Priest Sorak, and in &quot;The Strangler&quot;, a film based on the actual Boston Strangler Murders of the time, he portrayed Leo Kroll.

He also appeared in &quot;4 for Texas&quot; (1963), &quot;Robin and the 7 Hoods&quot; (1964), &quot;The Silencers&quot; (1966), &quot;Who&#x27;s Minding the Mint?&quot; (1967), &quot;&quot; (1969), &quot;Beneath the Planet of the Apes&quot; (1970), &quot;The Mad Butcher&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Evil&quot; (1978) as the Devil himself, clad in a white suit.

===Television roles===

Buono also had many television roles. He played the recurring role of Count Manzeppi in &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; and also played unrelated characters in that series&#x27; premiere episode and in the second and final &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; reunion film &quot;More Wild Wild West&quot; (1980).

Buono was cast to play villains of various ethnic origins on many television programs between 1960 and 1970. He was cast twice in 1960 in the western series &quot;The Rebel,&quot; starring Nick Adams, in the episodes &quot;Blind Marriage&quot; and &quot;The Earl of Durango&quot;. In 1962, he played Melanthos Moon in an episode of &quot;The Untouchables,&quot; titled &quot;Mr. Moon&quot;, in which he played a San Francisco art and antique dealer who hijacked a supply of the paper used for printing United States currency. In a 1963 episode of the same series, titled &quot;The Gang War&quot;, he played Pamise Surigao, a liquor smuggler competing with the Chicago mob.

In the episode &quot;Firebug&quot; (January 27, 1963) of the anthology series &quot;GE True&quot;, hosted by Jack Webb, Buono played a barber in Los Angeles who is by night a pyromaniac. In the storyline, the United States Forest Service believes one arsonist is causing a series of fires in California.

Buono appeared in four episodes of &quot;Perry Mason&quot;. In season 5, (March 17, 1962), he portrayed Alexander Glovatsky, a small-town sculptor, in &quot;The Case of the Absent Artist&quot;. In season 7, (April 2, 1964), he played John (Jack) Sylvester Fossette in &quot;The Case of the Simple Simon&quot;. In season 8 (April 29, 1965), he played Nathon Fallon in &quot;The Case of the Grinning Gorilla&quot;. In season 9, (February 27, 1966), he appeared in &quot;The Case of the Twice Told Twist&quot;, the only color episode, as Ben Huggins, the ringleader of a car-stripping ring.

Buono played the villain King Tut on the television series &quot;Batman&quot;. A Jekyll-and-Hyde character, William McElroy is a timid Yale professor of Egyptology who, after being hit in the head with a brick at a peace rally, assumes the persona of the charismatic, monomaniacal Egyptian King Tut. When he suffers another blow to the head, the villain recovers his meek academic personality. The role, which proved to be the most frequently featured original villain in the series, was one of Buono&#x27;s favorites because he was delighted at being able to overact without restraint.

He played another campy villain, &quot;Mr. Memory&quot;, in a 1967 unsold TV pilot film based on the &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; comic strip, from the same producers as &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;.

Buono also played a scientist bent on world domination in the &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot; in &quot;The Cyborg&quot;.

Buono made a guest appearance as Hannibal Day in the &quot;Get Smart&quot; episode &quot;Moonlighting Becomes You&quot;, originally airing January 2, 1970, and appeared three times as Dr. Blaine in the sitcom &quot;Harrigan and Son&quot;, starring Pat O&#x27;Brien and Roger Perry as a father-and-son team of lawyers. He appeared in a segment of &quot;Night Gallery&quot; titled &quot;Satisfaction Guaranteed&quot;. He also appeared in an episode of &quot;Hawaii Five-O, &quot;&quot;The $100,000 Nickel&quot;, in which he played the thief Eric Damien. It first aired on December 11, 1973. He made two memorable appearances on &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;, once in the episode &quot;The Exorcists&quot; and again in &quot;The Rent Strike&quot;, where he portrayed Mr. Lovelace. In 1976, he appeared in the comedy &quot;The Practice,&quot; portraying Bernard in the episode &quot;Jules and the Bum&quot;. He also made nine appearances on the 1977 series &quot;Man from Atlantis&quot; as the primary antagonist, Mr. Schubert.

===Comedy record albums and comic poetry===
In the 1970s, Buono released several comedy record albums which poked fun at his large stature, the first of which was &quot;Heavy!&quot;, as well as a book of comic poetry called &quot;It Could Be Verse&quot;. He began to style himself as &quot;the fat man from Batman&quot;. During guest appearances on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson,&quot; he frequently recited his poetry. The most popular of his poems was &quot;Fat Man&#x27;s Prayer&quot;, a work often erroneously attributed to Dom DeLuise or Jackie Gleason. It included many widely quoted couplets such as:

===Later career===
In the late 1970s and in 1980, Buono played the millionaire father of the memory-impaired Reverend Jim Ignatowski on &quot;Taxi&quot;. Christopher Lloyd, the actor portraying his son, was the same age as Buono, who died before the end of the series. One episode was made where Jim learns to cope with his father&#x27;s death.

In 1980, Buono appeared in the television film &quot;Murder Can Hurt You&quot; as Chief Ironbottom, a parody of the title character from &quot;Ironside&quot;. His later roles were more of pompous intellectuals and shady con men, although he also played straight roles. In the miniseries &quot;Backstairs at the White House&quot; (1979), he portrayed President William Howard Taft. Buono also appeared on 4 different episodes of the ABC series Vega$ with Robert Urich, playing a sage and yet also street-wise Las Vegas casino high roller named &#x27;Diamond Jim&#x27;.

==Death==
Buono died of a heart attack at his home in Apple Valley, California on New Year&#x27;s Day 1982.
He is entombed with his mother, Myrtle, in Greenwood Memorial Park in San Diego, but his name is not inscribed on the crypt.

==Personal life==
Buono attended the University of San Diego.

Buono liked to read and write, and one of his main interests was Shakespeare. &quot;The more you study him,&quot; he said, &quot;the greater he grows.&quot; He was also highly regarded as a gourmet chef.

In regard to relationships (and the implicit questioning of his sexuality), Buono is quoted as saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve heard or read about actors being asked the immortal question, &#x27;Why have you never married?&#x27; They answer with the immortal excuse, &#x27;I just haven&#x27;t found the right girl.&#x27; Because I&#x27;m on the hefty side, no one&#x27;s asked me yet. If they do, that&#x27;s the answer I&#x27;ll give. After all, if it was good enough for Monty Clift or Sal Mineo...&quot; Buono was closeted, like most gay actors at the time, but lived with boyfriends, and referred to himself as a &quot;conscientious objector&quot; in the &quot;morality revolution&quot; of the 1960s.

<text>The Black Friday bushfires of 13 January 1939, in Victoria, Australia, were part of the devastating 1938–1939 bushfire season in Australia, which saw bushfires burning for the whole summer, and ash falling as far away as New Zealand. It was calculated that three-quarters of the State of Victoria was directly or indirectly affected by the disaster, while other Australian states and the Australian Capital Territory were also badly hit by fires and extreme heat. This was the third-deadliest bushfire event in Australian history, only behind the 1983 Ash Wednesday bushfires and the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires.

Fires burned almost of land in Victoria, where 71 people were killed, and several towns were entirely obliterated. Over 1,300 homes and 69 sawmills were burned, and 3,700 buildings were destroyed or damaged. In response, the Victorian state government convened a Royal Commission that resulted in major changes in forest management. The Royal Commission noted that &quot;it appeared the whole State was alight on Friday, 13 January 1939&quot;.

New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory also faced severe fires during the 1939 season. Destructive fires burned from the NSW South Coast, across the ranges and inland to , while Sydney was ringed by fires which entered the outer suburbs, and fires raged towards the new capital at Canberra. South Australia was also struck by the Adelaide Hills bushfires.

==Conditions==

Eastern Australia is one of the most fire-prone regions of the world, with predominant eucalypt forests that have evolved to thrive on the phenomenon of bushfire. However, the 1938-9 bushfire season was exacerbated by a period of extreme heat, following several years of drought. Extreme heatwaves were accompanied by strong northerly winds, after a very dry six months. In the days preceding the fires, the Victorian state capital, Melbourne, experienced some of its hottest temperatures on record at the time: on 8 January and on 10 January. On 13 January, the day of the fires, temperatures reached , which stood as the hottest day officially recorded in Melbourne for the next 70 years. (Unofficial records show temperatures of around were reported on the Black Thursday fires of 6 February 1851).

The subsequent Victorian Royal Commission investigation of the fires recorded that Victoria had not seen such dry conditions for more than two decades, and its rich plains lay &quot;bare and baking; and the forest, from the foothills to the alpine heights, were tinder&quot;. The people who made their lives in the bush were worried by the dry conditions, but &quot;had not lived long enough&quot; to imagine what was to come: &quot; the most disastrous forest calamity the State of Victoria has known.&quot; Fires had been burning separately across Victoria through December, but reached a new intensity and &quot;joined forces in a terrible confluence of flame...&quot;.on Friday, 13 January.

==Effects in Victoria==
The most damage was felt in the mountain and alpine areas in the northeast and around the southwest coast. The Acheron, Tanjil and Thomson Valleys and the Grampians, were also hit. Five townships – Hill End, Narbethong, Nayook West, Noojee (apart from the Hotel), Woods Point – were completely destroyed and not all were rebuilt afterwards. The towns of Omeo, Pomonal, Warrandyte (though this is now a suburb of Melbourne, it was not in 1939) and Yarra Glen were also badly damaged.

The Stretton Royal Commission wrote:

An area of almost burned, 71 people killed, and whole townships wiped out, along with many sawmills and thousands of sheep, cattle and horses. According to Forest Management Victoria, during the bushfires of 13 January 1939:

===Major fires===
There were five major fire areas. Smaller fires included; East Gippsland, Mount Macedon, Mallee and the Mornington Peninsula. The major fires, listed roughly in order of size, included;

===Stretton Royal Commission and long-term consequences===

The subsequent Royal Commission, under Judge Leonard Edward Bishop Stretton (known as the Stretton Inquiry), attributed blame for the fires to careless burning, campfires, graziers, sawmillers and land clearing.

Prior to 13 January 1939, many fires were already burning. Some of the fires started as early as December 1938, but most of them started in the first week of January 1939. Some of these fires could not be extinguished. Others were left unattended or, as Judge Stretton wrote, the fires were allowed to burn &quot;under control&quot;, as it was falsely and dangerously called. Stretton declared that most of the fires were lit by the &quot;hand of man&quot;.

Stretton&#x27;s Royal Commission has been described as one of the most significant inquiries in the history of Victorian public administration.

As a consequence of Judge Stretton&#x27;s scathing report, the Forests Commission Victoria gained additional funding and took responsibility for fire protection on all public land including State forests, unoccupied Crown Lands and National Parks, plus a buffer extending one mile beyond their boundaries on to private land. Its responsibilities grew in one leap from . Stretton&#x27;s recommendations officially sanctioned and encouraged the common bush practice of controlled burning to minimise future risks.

Its recommendations led to sweeping changes, including stringent regulation of burning and fire safety measures for sawmills, grazing licensees and the general public, the compulsory construction of dugouts at forest sawmills, increasing the forest roads network and firebreaks, construction of forest dams, fire towers and RAAF aerial patrols linked by the Commissions radio network VL3AA to ground observers. The Commission&#x27;s communication systems were regarded at the time as being more technically advanced than those of the police and the military. These pioneering efforts were directed by Geoff Weste.

Victoria&#x27;s forests were devastated to an extent that was unprecedented within living memory, and the impact of the 1939 bushfires dominated management thought and action for much of the next ten years. Salvage of fire-killed timber became an urgent and dominant task that was still consuming the resources and efforts of the Forests Commission a decade and a half later.

It was estimated that over 6 million cubic meters of timber needed to be salvaged. This massive task was made more difficult by labour shortages caused by the Second World War. In fact, there was so much material that some of the logs were harvested and stockpiled in huge dumps in creek beds and covered with soil and treeferns to stop them from cracking, only to be recovered many years later.

Further major fires later in the 1943–44 Victorian bushfire season and another Royal Commission by Judge Stretton were key factors in the founding of the Country Fire Authority (CFA) for fire suppression on rural land. Prior to the creation of the CFA the Forests Commission had, to some extent, been supporting the individual volunteer brigades that had formed across rural Victoria in the preceding decades.

The environmental effects of the fires continued for many years and some of the burnt dead trees still remain today. Large areas of animal habitat were destroyed. In affected areas, the soil took decades to recover from the damage of the fires. In some areas, water supplies were contaminated for some years afterwards due to ash and debris washing into catchment areas.

==Fires in other states==

Other states also suffered severely in the extreme heat and fires. In New South Wales, suffered 37 consecutive days above and hit a record on 10 January. In mid-January, Sydney was ringed to the north, south and west by bushfires - from and Port Hacking to the Blue Mountains.

; New South Wales

Following the weekend of Black Friday, &quot;The Argus&quot; reported that on 15 January, fierce winds had also spread fire to almost every important area of New South Wales, burning in major fronts on Sydney&#x27;s suburban fringes and hitting the south coast and inland: &quot;hundreds of houses and thousands of head of stock and poultry were destroyed and thousands of acres of grazing land&quot;.

On 16 January, &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; reported that disastrous fires were burning in Victoria, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory as the climax to the terrible heatwave: Sydney faced record heat and was ringed to the north, south and west by bushfires from Palm Beach and Port Hacking to the Blue Mountains, with fires blazing at Castle Hill, Sylvania, Cronulla and French&#x27;s Forest. Disastrous fires were reported at Penrose, Wollongong, Nowra, Bathurst, Ulludulla, Mittagong, Trunkey and Nelligen.

; Australian Capital Territory

Canberra was facing the &quot;worst bushfires&quot; it had experienced, with thousands of acres burned out and a fire front was driven towards the city by a south westerly gale, destroying pine plantations and many homesteads, and threatening Mount Stromlo Observatory, Government House, and Black Mountain. Large numbers of men were sent to stand by government buildings in the line of fire. While five deaths in New South Wales were reported, in Victoria the death toll had reached more than sixty.

; South Australia

In South Australia, the Adelaide Hills bushfires also swept the state, destroying dozens of buildings.

== Comparison with other major bushfires ==
Internationally, south-eastern Australia is considered one of the three most fire-prone landscapes on Earth, along with southern California and the southern Mediterranean. Major Victorian bushfires occurred on Black Thursday in 1851, where an estimated were burnt, followed by another blaze on Red Tuesday in February 1898 in South Gippsland when about were burnt, 12 people died and more than 2,000 buildings were destroyed. The deadly pattern continued with more major fires on Black Sunday on 14 February 1926 sees the tally rise to sixty lives being lost and widespread damage to farms, homes and forests.

Considered in terms of both loss of property and loss of life the 1939 fires were one of the worst disasters, and certainly the worst bushfire event, to have occurred in Australia up to that time. Only the subsequent Ash Wednesday bushfires in 1983 and the Black Saturday bushfires in 2009 resulted in more deaths.

In terms of the total area burnt, the 1974–75 fires burned , equivalent to 15% of Australia&#x27;s land.; the Black Friday fires burned up , with the Black Thursday fires of 1851 having burnt an estimated .

<text>Góra is a town in Lower Silesian Voivodeship, in western Poland. It is the administrative seat both of Góra County and of the smaller district (gmina) called Gmina Góra.

==Geography==
The town is located within the historic Lower Silesia region, approximately north-west of the regional capital Wrocław. As at 2019, it has a population of 11,797.

==History==

The area became part of the emerging Polish state in the 10th century. Following the fragmentation of Poland into smaller provincial duchies, it initially formed part of Greater Poland before it passed to Silesia. The settlement was first mentioned as &quot;Gora&quot; in an 1155 deed by Pope Adrian IV conveying the property to the Diocese of Wrocław. The name of the town means &quot;hill&quot; or &quot;mountain&quot; in Polish. In 1256 the bishop of Wrocław Tomasz I gave the village to the Polish knight Gosław. In 1288 it became part of the Duchy of Głogów and was granted Magdeburg town rights by the Piast duke Henry III. In 1300, Henry III sold the local mint to the city council of Góra. Henry III, as well as the succeeding dukes Henry IV the Faithful and Konrad I granted new privileges to the town in 1306 and 1310. Particularly, in 1310, 33 neighboring villages were assigned to the town to create an administrative district called &quot;Weichbild&quot;. From the 14th century onwards, the town developed to a centre of cloth manufacturing, specific privileges were granted to the clothiers of Góra in 1304. The Germanized name &quot;Guhrau&quot; is first documented in 1336. In 1343, an annual fair was established. Also from that year comes the first mention of the existence of a parish school in Góra. The town remained under the rule of the Polish houses of Piast and Jagiellon as part of the duchies of Głogów, Ścinawa and Cieszyn until the 16th century.
The town &quot;Guhrau&quot; was annexed by Prussia upon the First Silesian War in 1742 and from 1816 was the administrative seat of &quot;Landkreis Guhrau&quot; within the Province of Silesia, which from 1871 to 1945 was also part of Germany. In World War II it was occupied by the Red Army during the 1945 Vistula–Oder Offensive. According to the Potsdam Agreement, the town became again part of Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which stayed in power until the 1980s, while the remaining German population was expelled. The historic name &quot;Góra&quot; was restored and the town was repopulated by Poles, expelled from former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union. Again a county seat from 1946, from 1975 to 1998 Góra belonged to Leszno Voivodeship. In 1999 Góra&#x27;s town limits were expanded by including the settlement of Sędziwojowice as its eastern district.

<doc id="664959" wikidata="Q2282686" url="?curid=664959" title="Locrinus">
<text>Locrinus was a legendary king of the Britons, as recounted by the 12th-century chronicler Geoffrey of Monmouth in his &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;. He came to power in 1125BC.

According to Geoffrey, Locrinus was the oldest son of Brutus and Innogen, and a descendant of the Trojans through Aeneas. Following Brutus&#x27;s death, Britain was divided amongst the three sons, with Locrinus receiving the portion roughly equivalent to England except for Devon and Cornwall, Albanactus receiving Scotland (Albany), and Kamber receiving Wales (Cymru). Locrinus ruled a portion of Britain called Loegria, named after him, which had roughly the boundaries of modern-day England, other than Devon and Cornwall. He reigned 10 years, most of which were peaceful.

He avenged his brother Albanactus&#x27;s death at the hands of Humber the Hun by allying with his other brother, Kamber, and fighting Humber to the banks of a river where he drowned. The river was named Humber after this battle. Locrinus divided up the spoils of war with his allies, only keeping gold and silver found on their ships for himself. He also took the daughter of the king of the Germans, Estrildis, whom the Huns had captured. This angered Corineus, an ally of his father Brutus, who had arranged a marriage between Locrinus and his own daughter, Queen Gwendolen. Locrinus submitted and married Gwendolen but still secretly loved Estrildis, whom he locked in a cave beneath Trinovantum (London) for seven years.

Locrinus became the father of a girl, Habren, by Estrildis, and a boy, Maddan, by Gwendolen. Soon after Maddan&#x27;s birth, Locrinus sent him off to Corineus, the child&#x27;s grandfather. When Corineus finally died, Locrinus left Gwendolen and took Estrildis as his queen. Gwendolen went to Cornwall and assembled an army to harass Locrinus. The two armies met near the River Stour and there Locrinus was killed. His wife, Gwendolen, ruled after his death.

==Later tradition==
In the 13th century Prose &quot;Merlin&quot;, Locrinus is called Logryn, and arrives in Britain a long time after the death of Brutus. He &quot;a-mended gretly the Citee , and made towres and stronge walles enbateiled&quot;, and then renamed it from New Troy to Logres, which it continued to be called until after the death of King Arthur.

Locrinus is the subject of the anonymous Elizabethan play &quot;Locrine&quot;, published in 1595 as &quot;Newly set forth, overseen and corrected by W.S.,&quot; on account of which it was later included in the Shakespeare Apocrypha.

<text>The Llap Region (; ) is a region located in the north-eastern part of Kosovo. Llap in the broadest sense includes the watershed of the Llapi River. The Llapi water collection begins in the mountains of Kopaonik in the north and west and its source is considered to be the village of Pollatë, and ends by joining the Sitnica river in Lumadh, municipality of Vushtrri, in the north-west of Pristina. The topographic watershed of the Llapi River covers an area of .

This area approximately corresponds to the administrative territory of the municipality of Podujevë in the current division of Kosovo. Podujevë as a city in the Llap region is the most important economic, political, administrative, educational, cultural and health center. About 120 villages gravitate to this region, although some of them administratively belong to the municipalities of Pristina, Vushtrri or Mitrovica. The municipality of Podujevë includes 78 villages.

==Etymology==
The territory of Llap is named after the hydronym Llap (Albanian name for the Llap river). Many scholars take the hydronym Lab as ancient and bring it from an alb-, from which lab-, alp- could emerge.

==Geography==
The Llap region is located on north-east part of Kosovo. The average elevation of Llap is 825m (Anonymos, 1995). Through this region pass the main road and border which connects Kosovo and Serbia. Along Llap region since Illyrian-Roman period, passed an important Balkan route Lissus-Naissus (Lezhë-Niš) or Via De Zenta, which connected the Adriatic Coast with central part of Balkan Peninsula. In north-east and east of the region are two important saddles: Përpellac Peak (813m) and Merdar Peak (647m oversea level) (Anonymos, 1995). 
Llap region as a microgeographical whole is divided into three parts:

# Llap field (also called &quot;Little Kosovo&quot;, , ), which stretches from the village of Repë in the north and south to the village of Besi-Barilevë, with a length of more than 35 km and with a width of 12–15 km on the line Batllavë-Llapashticë e Epërme.
# Llap gorge, which includes the territory from the village of Repë to the village of Murgull, with a length of about 14 km, and from Bellasica to the Cape of Uglari, which is about 14 km wide.
# Gallap of Llap, which stretches from the village of Batllavë to the village of Metergoc and from the village of Turuçicë to Keqekollë and Koliq. This territory has more hilly-mountainous areas.

==History==

=== Prehistory ===

This region was ruled by an Illyrian tribe, Dardani where the Kingdom of Dardania took place. The south part of the region, the Gallap of Llap, were inhabited by Galabri tribe. This may prove the origin of the toponym Gallap, which is thought to come from the name of this tribe. Strabo writes that they are a &quot;people of the Dardaniatae, in whose land is an ancient city&quot;. In the village of Gllamnik an ancient locality has been found, who is believed to be Vendenis. This locality belongs to the Roman period (I-IV centuries) and that of late antiquity (IV-VI centuries). Although the excavations at this site were quite modest (a total of 534 m2 or only 2% of the area was excavated), they shed light on traces of Roman antiquity where special discoveries such as the Orpheus Mosaic, unique in the Balkans and beyond.

===Medieval Period===

Abbot of Diokle from the second half of the 12th century mentions that Rashka or Serbia extended until Arberia(Albania), the region of present day Llap.

=== Ottoman Period ===
Considering the fact that Kosovo was under Ottoman Rule, also Podujevë remained under Ottoman Rule from 1455 to 1912. In the first Ottoman records of the Sanjak of Viçitrina in 1455, we encounter the Nahija of Llap which was the second largest nahija in this sanjak. Nahija had 219 settlements, which includes some villages of today&#x27;s municipalities of: Mitrovica, Vushtrri, Skenderaj, about 90% of Pristina and Podujevë as a whole. In the Defter of Jizya of 1485, Llapi had 5,952 Christian families while in 1488/89 Llapi had 7,399 households. In the Ottoman records of 1566–74, Nahija of Llap was divided into 4 smaller nahijas: Llap, Gollak, Belasnica and Trepča. After the partition, Nahija of Llap extended to the present territory of the municipality of Podujevë as a whole, and a large part of the municipality of Pristina, to the southernmost villages of this municipality.

In 1487, Albanian toponyms such as &quot;Arbanas&quot; were mentioned in the Nahija of Llapi. Ottoman writer Evliya Celebi mentioned the Llapi river as having &quot;its source in Albania&quot; and joining other rivers before flowing into the Danube, during one of his travels to Kosovo in the 1660s.

In the 18th century the Nahija of Llap was part of the Sanjak of Pristina. At this time, Llapi lost many residents due to two plagues who stroke the place. During the Austro-Ottoman war the Austrian army destroyed and robbed the city of Podujevë twice. During the First Serbian Uprising, the Serbian army got into the village of Reçica and killed 30 people of Demë Ahmeti&#x27;s house, an Albanian national hero. This happened at 28 June 1811, during the feast of Eid. The rebellion against Ottomans started when Sulltan Abdyl Mejid proclaimed “The Saint Decree of Julhane” in 1839 which increased taxes and so it brought many rebellions. The population of Llapi fought against these reforms and during 1843 the Ottomans temporary left Llapi and started to organize the reoccupation. The rebels gathered many soldiers from the surrounding region and they won the battles against Ottomans, taking Pristina and stimulating a bigger rebellion in other regions. This rebellion was extinguished in 1847. When Serbia acquired the Sanjak of Niš in 1877, many Albanians started to leave their houses and to come to the other parts of Kosovo, where Llapi was tone of their first destinations. There is not a single village in Podujevë where Muhajirs or migrants cannot be found, furthermore, they established new villages. Albanians of Llapi, since the First League of Prizren did not pay taxes to the Ottomans. Afterwards, the Ottomans built a military cantonment during 1892 and 1899 since they detected Serbian Army movements near the border. The Albanian rebellion against Ottomans during 1906 was primary organized in the Llap region. Another rebellion was that of 1910 which started in the Llap region. The relationships between the residents and the Sublime Porte were becoming very fraught and when Sulltan Mehmed V came to visit Kosovo, very few Llapi residents were present. Llapi is also known for its cooperation with Isa Boletini, who during 1911 operated around this zone. Many soldiers from around the villages of Llapi and Gallapi pledged loyalty to Boletini in 1912, in the Bradash pledge. Their goal was to initiate the general Albanian rebellion against Ottoman Rule and they were part of the rebellion until it ended.

=== Modern day ===
In 1997, the Kosovo Liberation Army was formed, resulting in a Yugoslav-led campaign against it in 1998. In response, NATO began a military campaign so it could protect the civilian population. During the Kosovo War, the town was the site of the Podujevë massacre in March 1999 in which 14 Kosovo Albanian women and children were killed by Serbian paramilitary forces. After the war, the process of establishing a Municipal Assembly began in 2002. Later, on 17 February 2008, Kosovo declared its independence.

<doc id="664969" wikidata="Q2830792" url="?curid=664969" title="Albanactus">
<text>Albanactus, according to Geoffrey of Monmouth, was the founding king of Albania or Albany. He is in effect Geoffrey&#x27;s eponym for Scotland. His territory was that north of the Humber estuary. This myth was then taken up by Giraldus Cambrensis.

==Legendary history in Geoffrey of Monmouth==
Albanactus was stated to be the youngest of three sons of Brutus and Innogen, and a descendant of Aeneas of Troy. According to legend, upon their father&#x27;s death, the eldest son Locrinus was given &quot;Loegria&quot;, Camber was given &quot;Cambria&quot; and Albanactus &quot;Albania&quot;. These names are merely reverse etymologies. Albanactus, for instance, is a reverse etymology of the Scottish word &quot;Albannach&quot; or &quot;Alvannach&quot; (Volcanic Highlands) [of Albanian Highland people called &quot;Highlanders&quot;] (Scotsman). Likewise, &quot;Locrinus&quot; represents the medieval Welsh word &quot;Loegria&quot; (England, except for Cornwall) (modern Welsh &quot;Lloegr&quot;), and Camber represents the Latin word Cambria or the Welsh word &quot;Cymru&quot; (Wales). 

It is recounted that Albanactus was killed shortly after he began his reign, by Humber, king of the Huns. Humber invaded Albany from Germany and met Albanactus&#x27;s army in battle, where Humber killed Albanactus. This forced the people of Albany to flee south to Albanactus&#x27;s brother, Locrinus.

All this was supposedly before the Picts and Scots had invaded. Later Kings of England – particularly Edward I – used the Brutus and Albanactus legend as an excuse to claim superiority over and to conquer Scotland, arguing that as Locrinus was the oldest brother, so he and hence England had superior status. The same argument, of course, extended over Wales, as Camber was also junior to Locrinus.

==Context==
In Scottish origin myths, Albanactus had little place. The Scots instead stressed descent from Gaythelos (Gael) or Gaidel Glas and his wife Scota.

<doc id="664974" wikidata="Q16867439" url="?curid=664974" title="King Camber">
<text>Camber, also Kamber, was the legendary first king of Cambria, according to the Geoffrey of Monmouth in the first part of his influential 12th-century pseudohistory &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;. According to Geoffrey, Cambria, the classical name for Wales, was named for him.
==Legendary genealogy and life==
Camber was the second son of Brutus and Innogen, and a descendant of Aeneas of Troy. Upon his father&#x27;s death he was given Cambria, while his younger brother Albanactus got Alba (the territory corresponding to modern Scotland; from Welsh &quot;Yr Alban&quot;) and his older brother Locrinus received Logres (corresponding to England except for Cornwall; from Welsh &quot;Lloegr&quot;) and the title of King of the Britons. When Albanactus was murdered by Humber, King of the Huns, Camber joined Locrinus in attacking and defeating him.
==Lack of historicity==
Like many of the characters reported by Geoffrey, Camber has no historical basis but is the product of Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s imagination, invented largely for political ends within the contemporary Anglo-Norman world.
==In the Book of Baglan==
The &quot;Book of Baglan&quot; provides a list of descendants of Camber, starting with his eldest son Gorbonian, who became duke of Cornwall and chief governor of Cambria, and his second son Albon, governor of North Cambria and earl of Ewias and Urtchingfild. Through Gorbonion, Dyfnwal Moelmud was descended, who became king of Britain, and eventually the line passes to Henry VII. It also gives attributed arms to Camber, &quot;2 lions rampant, vert.&quot;

According to Geoffrey, following the division of Britain amongst Locrinus, Kamber, and Albanactus, Humber invaded Albany (which then covered all the lands north of the Humber) and killed Albanactus in open battle. The remaining natives fled south where Locrinus allied with Kamber and defeated Humber near a river in which Humber was drowned. The river, which was thereafter known as the Humber, marked the southern border of the Kingdom of Northumbria and is one of the main rivers of England.

When Locrinus raided Humber&#x27;s ships after his death, he found Humber&#x27;s consort Estrildis, the daughter of the King of Germany there. Thus Humber&#x27;s Huns were able to settle Britain with their Queen Estrildis eventually marrying Locrinus. The River Severn was named after her daughter Hafren.

== Post-mediaeval literature ==
The war between Humber and Locrinus was retold in many histories, poems and dramas. Dramatic works include the play &quot;Locrine&quot; (1591; published 1595 under the initials W.S.). &lt;br&gt;
Poetry includes &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; (1590) by Edmund Spenser; &quot;An old Ballad of a Duke of Cornwall&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, published in a 1726 collection of old ballads; and the introduction to the poem &quot;The revenge of Guendolen&quot; (circa 1786) by J.J. Proby.&lt;br&gt;
Historical accounts include the eighteenth century works &quot;The history of Great-Britain, from the first inhabitants thereof, &#x27;till the death of Cadwalader, last king of the Britains; and of the Kings of Scotland to Eugenev&quot; (1701) by John Lewis; &quot;The naval history of Britain, from the earliest periods of which there are accounts in history, to the conclusion of the year M.DCC.LVI.&quot; (1756); and &quot;A new and complete history of England, from the first settlement of Brutus, upwards of one thousand years before Julius Cæsar, to the year 1793&quot; (1791-1794) by Charles Alfred Ashburton.

==Interpretation==
A medieval studies scholar has pointed out that medieval maps of Britain represent a conception of a land divided by the rivers Humber and Severn into three realms. The river names, she suggests, are associated with legendary figures who attempt to transgress boundaries, in this case an invading king, who are destroyed by the water that defines the limits.

==In pop culture==
Modern Ulster Scots and other Scots Protestants are still referred to as Huns by Irish Catholics.

<text>Christos Konstantinos Chelios (; born January 25, 1962) is a Greek-American former professional ice hockey defenseman. He was one of the longest-tenured players in the National Hockey League (NHL), and is a three-time Stanley Cup champion—one with the Montreal Canadiens and two with the Detroit Red Wings. 
Chelios played for the Canadiens, Blackhawks, Detroit Red Wings, and the Atlanta Thrashers. When he was called up from the AHL&#x27;s Chicago Wolves to play for the Thrashers during the 2009–10 NHL season, Chelios was the oldest active player in the NHL and the second oldest of all time. He had played the most games of any active player in the NHL, was the last player from the 1981 NHL Entry Draft still active (or any draft from 1986 and earlier), and had the most career penalty minutes of any active player. He is the former record-holder for most games played in the NHL by a defenseman, is eighth overall with 1,651 games played, holds the record for most career playoff games played with 266 and is tied with Gordie Howe for most NHL seasons played with 26. On May 1, 2009, he appeared in the playoffs for an NHL record 24th time, having missed the playoffs only once. Chelios is also the record-holder for most career postseason losses, with 117 (also the most in any professional sport in North America). However, he only lost one Game 7 in his career, a 3–2 OT loss in the 1985 Adams Division Finals against the Nordiques. In 2017, Chelios was named one of the &quot;100 Greatest NHL Players&quot; in history.

Chelios is of Greek heritage. His cousin, Nikos Tselios, also played professional hockey and is a former first round draft pick of the Carolina Hurricanes. Chelios was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame on November 8, 2013, and inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2018.

==Playing career==
===Early years===
Chelios was born in Chicago on January 25, 1962, to Gus and Susan Chelios. They lived in Evergreen Park, Illinois, just south of Chicago. Chris attended Mount Carmel High School not far from the shore of Lake Michigan until his family moved to Poway, California. Then he went to Mira Mesa High School in the north part of San Diego.

Unable to play high school hockey in Southern California, Chelios was not recruited by any U.S. colleges. His only scholarship offer came from San Diego-based United States International University, the only NCAA Division I hockey team west of the Rockies. However, when Chelios arrived on campus as a freshman in 1979, he soon realized he was in the wrong environment, facing bigger players with considerably more junior hockey experience. He was eventually cut from the team and considered quitting hockey. Instead, Chelios tried his luck in Canada, where he was twice cut by Junior B teams and hit a low point when he had to borrow money from strangers to get home to California one year. He said, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t any bigger or any better than the other guys, so they weren&#x27;t going to take a kid from the States when they could have a local guy.&quot;

Chelios returned home and grew three inches while adding 40 pounds of muscle. He was then drafted by the Montreal Canadiens in the 1981 NHL Entry Draft. Prior to that, he played for the Moose Jaw Canucks of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League, where he tallied 87 points and 175 penalty minutes in just 54 games in his final season. Chelios then enjoyed two strong years playing for the Wisconsin Badgers at the University of Wisconsin–Madison after being drafted. As one of the top collegiate players in the country, he was selected for the United States team at the 1982 World Junior Ice Hockey Championship. In 1983, he was part of the Badgers&#x27; NCAA Men&#x27;s Ice Hockey Championship team and was named to the all-tournament team and the second WCHA all-star team.

Chelios was a member of the U.S. team for the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia. Next he debuted for the Canadiens, playing 12 games in the regular season and 15 in the playoffs. That summer he joined the U.S. team at the 1984 Canada Cup.

===Montreal Canadiens (1984–1990)===
In 1984, Chelios made the Montreal Canadiens for good, distinguishing himself with his play. During his early days, he was known for his offensive abilities, and his teammates even called him &quot;Soft Hands Chelios&quot; He earned a trip to the National Hockey League All-Star Game and was named to the 1985 NHL All-Rookie Team. He scored 64 points in 74 games, a high total for a defenseman even in the high-scoring 1980s, and finished second to Mario Lemieux for the Calder Memorial Trophy. In the playoffs that year, he had 10 points in nine games, with a +17 plus/minus. Although he only played 41 games in the 1985–86 season, he won his first Stanley Cup, playing in front of Conn Smythe Trophy-winning goaltender Patrick Roy.

Following two more good seasons in Montreal, Chelios really broke out in the 1988–89 campaign. He scored 73 points in 80 games at +35, was named to the All-Star first-team, and won his first James Norris Memorial Trophy. During that year&#x27;s Wales Conference (now Eastern Conference) Finals series against the Philadelphia Flyers (which the Canadiens won in six games), Chelios became reviled by Flyer fans for a dirty hit on Brian Propp that left the Philadelphia winger with a serious concussion and forced him to miss the next game. The Flyers did not retaliate against Chelios until their fate was sealed late in Game 6; Flyers goaltender Ron Hextall memorably skated out of his net to attack Chelios, earning him a 12-game suspension.

After playing only 53 games the following season (in which he served as Canadiens&#x27; co-captain, with Guy Carbonneau, making Chelios the first non-Canadian player to captain the Canadiens), Chelios was traded to his hometown team, the Chicago Blackhawks on June 29, 1990, with a 2nd-round draft pick for Denis Savard. The trade occurred one day after Chelios was accused of fighting with two police officers as they tried to arrest him for urinating in public outside a bar in downtown Madison, Wisconsin, according to a criminal complaint.

===Chicago Blackhawks (1990–1999)===
In his first season with Chicago, Chelios continued to score at his usual rate, tallying 64 points, and earned a spot on the Second NHL All-Star team. He helped lead the Blackhawks to the Stanley Cup Finals in 1992, where they were swept by the Pittsburgh Penguins. He was in top form for the 1992–93 season, scoring 73 points and winning his second James Norris Memorial Trophy. His Norris Trophy-winning play, which some sports reporters referred to as &quot;Sweet,&quot; earned him the nickname &quot;Honey Nut;&quot; the nickname derives from his name being spelled and pronounced similarly to the famous breakfast cereal, Honey Nut Cheerios.

During the 1994–95 NHL lockout he played for EHC Biel in the Swiss National League A.

For the 1995–96 season, Chelios was named captain of the Blackhawks, a role he served in until 1999. He enjoyed another fine season, scoring 72 points and winning his third James Norris Memorial Trophy. In the summer of 1996, he helped lead the United States to its biggest international hockey win since the 1980 Winter Olympics, as the Americans defeated Canada in the 1996 World Cup of Hockey finals. Chelios was named to the All-Tournament Team.

===Detroit Red Wings (1999–2009)===
At 37, Chelios could still help teams with his veteran leadership and his largely remaining talent. On March 23, 1999, he was traded to the Detroit Red Wings for Anders Eriksson and two first-round draft picks. The move to Detroit, where he had fewer responsibilities and more skilled teammates, helped keep Chelios playing at close to his peak level. In 2002, his +40 plus/minus led the league, and he was again named to the first All-Star team. He also led the United States hockey team to a silver medal at the 2002 Winter Olympics, and was named to the Tournament&#x27;s All-Star team. His season culminated in the Red Wings&#x27; victory over the Carolina Hurricanes in the Stanley Cup Finals, giving Chelios his second Stanley Cup.
In 2004, because of the cancellation of the NHL season, Chelios, along with fellow Red Wing teammates Derian Hatcher and Kris Draper, decided to play hockey for the Motor City Mechanics, a UHL team based out of Fraser, Michigan. He was heavily criticized for this decision as the UHL has a maximum salary in place, but at the same time he was strongly against a salary cap in the NHL. In October 2004, he trained with the U.S. bobsled federation in a bid to compete for the Greek bobsled team at the 2006 Winter Olympics. While Chelios did not compete in the bobsled, he did captain the USA hockey team at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy.

On August 4, 2005, the 43-year-old re-signed with the Red Wings for a one-year contract. On May 24, 2006, Chelios re-signed a one-year contract with the Detroit Red Wings. On July 3, 2006, Chelios became the active leader for most games played upon the retirement of teammate Steve Yzerman. On April 21, 2007, he became the oldest defenseman to score a short-handed goal in the NHL in a playoff game against the Calgary Flames. Chelios was the captain of the US Olympic Hockey Team that played at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. By participating in ice hockey at the 2006 Winter Olympics, Chelios set a new standard, by becoming the first player to take part in an Olympic ice hockey tournament twenty-two years after he played in his first. The old record was set by Swiss hockey player Bibi Torriani who had played twenty years after his debut (1928 and 1948).

Chelios re-signed with the Detroit Red Wings for the 2007–08 season. On January 8, 2008, Chelios became the second oldest player in the history of the NHL, at 45 years, 348 days, passing Moe Roberts. Only Gordie Howe, who played until age 52, was older. On April 12, 2008, Chelios played in his 248th playoff game, breaking the NHL record set by Hall of Fame goaltender Patrick Roy. Later that season, Chelios also became the oldest active player to win the Stanley Cup. He signed another one-year contract with the Red Wings for the 2008–09 season. On December 5, 2008, Chelios played in his first of two games for the Grand Rapids Griffins, the American Hockey League (AHL) farm club for the Red Wings, as part of a conditioning stint. At 46 years of age, he became the oldest player in the 73-year history of the AHL. At the conclusion of the 2008–09 season, he was a finalist for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy.

===Chicago Wolves and Atlanta Thrashers===
After the Red Wings announced that they would not be re-signing Chelios, he signed a 25-game tryout contract with the Chicago Wolves of the AHL. After a second 25-game pro tryout contract with the Wolves, Chelios signed a two-way contract with the Atlanta Thrashers. Chelios remained with the Wolves until he was recalled to the Thrashers, hoping that he could provide a spark for the team&#x27;s playoff hopes. He played in seven games for the Thrashers; the first time in his career he did not play for an Original Six team, but failed to record any points. On April 7, 2010, Chelios was sent back to the Wolves.

===Retirement, transition to Wings front office, and broadcasting===
On August 31, 2010, Chelios officially retired. He was 48 years of age. The same day, Red Wings general manager Ken Holland announced that Chelios would be hired to work in the Red Wings&#x27; front office. He was named Adviser to Hockey Operations, with a role of working with Red Wings&#x27; defense prospects in Grand Rapids.

In 2013, it was announced that Chelios would become an NHL analyst on FS1, which also included covering the hockey tournament at the 2014 Winter Olympics.

In 2016, Chelios, along with former Red Wings teammate Brett Hull, was added to ESPN&#x27;s roster of analysts for their coverage of the 2016 World Cup of Hockey, which ESPN had picked up the U.S. broadcast rights to, after NBC pulled out due to scheduling conflicts.

In July 2018, Chelios announced that he was leaving the Detroit area, and the Red Wings front office, to return to Chicago to be close to his family. At the same time, the Chicago Blackhawks announced that Chelios was being brought on board to serve as an ambassador for the franchise.

In 2021, after ESPN regained the rights to broadcast the NHL, Chelios rejoined the network for their coverage. Chelios served the same studio analyst role he held for the 2016 World Cup of Hockey, and sat alongside Mark Messier and P. K. Subban, joining Steve Levy for games on ESPN, ABC, and ESPN+. On June 5, 2023, it was announced that Chelios&#x27;s contract would not be renewed as part of Disney&#x27;s $5.5billion cost cutting. Chelios later joined TNT as a guest studio analyst for their November 7 doubleheader.

The Blackhawks retired Chelios&#x27;s no. 7 before their game against the Red Wings on February 25, 2024, making him the ninth Blackhawk to receive the honor.

==Coaching career==
On June 17, 2015, USA Hockey named Chelios an assistant coach for Team USA at the 2016 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships.

On June 23, 2015, Chelios was named to the Red Wings coaching staff, where he will continue to play a role in player development, by working on-ice with the team&#x27;s defensemen during practices. His job involved evaluating in-game player performance and offering his insight and observations to Red Wings bench coaches. He would also attend all home games, and on occasion, join the club on the road.

==International play==
Chelios has participated in 11 international tournaments for the United States:
*1980 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships
*1982 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships
*1984 Winter Olympics
*1984 Canada Cup
*1987 Canada Cup
*1991 Canada Cup
*1996 World Cup of Hockey (alternate captain)
*1998 Winter Olympics (captain)
*2002 Winter Olympics (captain)
*2004 World Cup of Hockey (captain)
*2006 Winter Olympics (captain)

In 2020, Chelios was named into the IIHF All-Time USA Team.

==Personal life==
Chelios grew up in Chicago where his father, Constantine &quot;Gus&quot; Chelios, owned a chain of Greek restaurants. The family name was originally &quot;Tselios&quot;, but Gus chose to change the spelling of his surname. The family moved to Poway, California, in 1977, when Chris&#x27; father left his struggling business in Chicago to open a restaurant in the San Diego area. Chris was a Chicago Blackhawks fan during his childhood but was more focused on football, idolizing Chicago Bears linebacker Dick Butkus.

Chris Chelios attended Mount Carmel High School in Chicago before his family moved west, and then finished prep studies at Mira Mesa Senior High School in San Diego. He and his wife Tracee were married in 1987. They met while students at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. They have four children: Dean (born 1989), Jake (born 1991), Caley (born 1993), and Tara (born 1996). Dean Chelios, a forward for Cranbrook-Kingswood High School in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, scored two power play goals helping his team win the 2006 Division III Michigan state high school hockey championship. Dean played for the Chicago Steel of the USHL in Bensenville, Illinois, and last played in 2016 for the Wichita Thunder of the ECHL. In May 2009, Jake was drafted 49th overall by the Chicago Steel and joined his brother at Michigan State University in Lansing. Jake is a defenseman, like his father, and currently plays with Kunlun Red Star of the KHL. Caley graduated from Northwestern University and is a reporter for the Chicago Blackhawks.

Chris Chelios was very active in charitable causes during his playing time in Chicago, founding &quot;Cheli&#x27;s Children&quot;.&quot; He is the older brother of former minor-leaguer Steve Chelios, and cousin of former NHL player Nikos Tselios.

Through his career, Chelios has befriended many non-hockey athletes and entertainers. In 2004, he and surfer Laird Hamilton trained with the U.S. bobsled team and hoped to form the first Greek bobsled team at the 2006 Winter Olympics. Chelios and his family can be found stand-up paddle surfing with Hamilton. Chelios credits the activity with helping him maintain his long career.

On &quot;Scrubs&quot;, Dr. Perry Cox, played by Chelios&#x27;s friend John C. McGinley, often wears a Red Wings jersey with Chelios&#x27;s name and number. During the fourth season of the show, which was concurrent with the 2004–05 lockout, Cox was seen on at least one occasion wearing a No. 24 &quot;Motor City Mechanics&quot; jersey. Chelios is also close friends with actors John Cusack and D. B. Sweeney, Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder, Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan, and musician Kid Rock. Chelios was sitting courtside with Kid Rock during the Pacers-Pistons brawl at the Palace of Auburn Hills on November 19, 2004. Chelios and Sweeney are quite close, with the two having appeared together in &quot;The Cutting Edge&quot; (1992) and &quot;Two Tickets to Paradise&quot; (2007), in addition to Chelios being the godfather to Sweeney&#x27;s son, Cade.

Chelios was a regular at Michigan State University hockey games, cheering on his sons Jake and Dean.

===DUI arrest===
On December 28, 2009, in Westmont, a southwest suburb of Chicago, Chelios was arrested for driving under the influence. He was the only occupant of the vehicle that was stopped at 4 a.m. The vehicle was towed and Chelios was taken to the Westmont station, where he was charged, processed, and posted bond. In March 2010, a judge reviewed the video tape of the arrest. The case was dismissed for lack of probable cause to stop, and evidence the tape provided that Chelios was not impaired. He was, however, fined for improper lane usage and speeding.

===Malibu Mob===
Chelios has a home in Malibu, California, and is well known as a member of the group of celebrity home owners and friends called the Malibu Mob. Other members include tennis great John McEnroe, big-wave surfer Laird Hamilton and his beach volleyball professional wife Gabrielle Reece, musicians Tim Commerford and Kid Rock, and actors John C. McGinley, John Cusack, Kelsey Grammer, Tony Danza, Justin Long, and Ed O&#x27;Neill.

==Business==

Chelios has owned restaurant/bars in both the Chicago and Detroit areas with the name &quot;Cheli&#x27;s Chili Bar&quot;. The first was on West Madison Street in Chicago (near the United Center) in the 1990s, but closed after when he became a Red Wings player. A new Cheli&#x27;s opened in Dearborn in 2003, followed by a second location in Detroit in 2006, and a third in Clinton Township in 2008. All of the restaurants are closed, with the Detroit location shuttering in November 2018 when Chelios returned to the Windy City. He has talked about wanting to open a restaurant in the Chicago area.

On January 2, 2007, two employees of Cheli&#x27;s in Detroit were fatally stabbed: Megan Soroka, 49, a manager at the restaurant, and Mark Barnard, 52, a chef. Police arrested Justin Blackshere, 17, who confessed to the crime. He was a busboy at the restaurant and was fired in November 2006. Blackshere&#x27;s pregnant girlfriend had also been fired from her job as a dishwasher. Chelios took a leave of absence from the Red Wings to help the victims&#x27; families. He said, &quot;I&#x27;ll come back when I feel ready and the families feel ready. I&#x27;m just going to try to get through this day by day with everybody.&quot; On January 9, 2007, the Red Wings announced that Chelios would playing that night. Blackshere was found guilty of murder in the first degree on August 22, 2007 and was sentenced to life in prison without parole on September 7, 2007.

<text>Nangan Township () is a rural township in the Matsu Islands and the county seat of Lienchiang County, Fujian.

There is an airport in Nangan. The highest point is Yuntai Mountain, at above sea level.

==Name==
Nangan Township is named for Nangan Island (Nankan Island), the main island in the township. Nangan was also known Nangantang (; Nàng-găng-dòng). Because Lin Moniang&#x27;s (who later became the Goddess Mazu) bodily relic was claimed to be washed ashore here, Nangan was also known as Matsu Island / Ma-tsu Island / Matsu Shan / Matsu-Shan (Matsoo/ Matsoo shan) (; Mā-cū-dō̤). In Song and Ming records, Nangan Island (Matsu Island) was called &quot;Shanggantang&quot;/&quot;Shanggantangshan&quot; (//) as opposed to Beigan Island, which was called &quot;Xiagantang&quot;/&quot;Xiagantangshan&quot; (//).

==History==
In 1935, a baojia was created including Nangan Island.

In 1949, ROC forces were stationed on Nangan Island.

At 3 AM on January 9, 1966, three seamen from the PRC defected to the ROC at Nangan (Nankan) Island. They were ambushed and killed in transit to Taipei.

In 2000, as part of the Three Links, transportation between Nangan Island&#x27;s Fuao and Mawei District in Fuzhou was established.

In 2003, Nangan Airport was opened.

On the morning of May 4, 2016, Jiaonan Village (in Tailu, Lianjiang County, Fuzhou, Fujian, China (PRC)) Branch Chinese Communist Party Secretary Liu Wenjian () and Niujiao Community Assistant Manager Tsao Erh-Chang () met in Nangan Township and signed a memorandum of mutual exchange and cooperation. Others present included the Magistrate of Lienchiang County, ROC Liu Cheng-ying, Tailu Party Secretary Huang Duanming (), Nangan Township Mayor Chen Chen-Ko () and others.

==Geography==
The island of Nangan is not only the largest island of its township, but also the largest island of Matsu. Nangan Township is also the largest township in Lienchiang County, with a population of about 4,000. The highest point of the island is the Mount Yuntai peak at 248 meters. Nangan&#x27;s climate is classified as subtropical, with distinct seasons. The average year-round temperature is 20C, with July and August reaching 34C and January temperatures as low as 1.8C. There is an intense fog period during March and April which often affects the scheduled flights at Nangan Airport.

Other islets in Nangan Township include Huangguan Yu (), Xie Jiao (), Beiquan Jiao (), and Liuquan Jiao ().

==Politics and government==
=== Administrative divisions ===
There are 10 villages on Nangan. At the eastern end of the island is Jieshou (介壽村), the seat of the county government and the largest village. Following the coastal road west from Jieshou, there are Fuxing (復興村), Fuao (福澳村), Qingshui (清水村), Zhuluo (珠螺村) and Mazu (馬祖村). Following the mountain road west, there are Meishi (梅石村), Renai (仁愛村) and Jinsha (津沙聚落), before once again reaching Mazu. Located to the north of Mazu is Siwei (四維村). In addition to these, there are two smaller villages or clusters of homes. These are Furen (夫人村) and Ketiao (科蹄澳), they are located near Siwei.

Many villages on Nangan have two names. In some cases, this was the result of politics, as one is the traditional name and the second has a political connotation. These instances are paired as follows with the traditional name first: Shanlong (山隴): Jieshou (介壽), Niujiao (牛角(聚落)): Fuxing (復興), Tieban (鐵板): Renai (仁愛), and Fuao (福澳): Jingze (經澤). These names are often used interchangeably by residents, except for Jingze. Residents objected to this latter name, and so it never came into popular use. The reference to Shanlong is also important as there is a neighborhood there called Zhonglong (中隴). Mazu is also referred to as Magang (馬港) and Siwei as Xiwei (西尾). As for Mazu and Magang, Magang is the preferred name. This could be in order to distinguish the village and its harbor from Mazu (媽祖), the goddess, and Mazu (馬祖) the island chain. Xiwei was derived from the local Fuzhou dialect&#x27;s pronunciation of Siwei.

The nine rural villages of Nangan Township are:

* Jieshou (Chiehshou; ) literally, &quot;Longevity for Chiang Kai-shek &quot;
* Jinsha (Chinsha; ) &quot;Sand of Seaport&quot;
* Cingshuei / Qingshui (Chingshui; ) &quot;Pure Water&quot;

<doc id="664987" wikidata="Q2897927" url="?curid=664987" title="Estrildis">
<text>Estrildis was the beloved mistress of King Locrinus of the Britons and the mother of his daughter Habren, according to the 12th-century chronicler Geoffrey of Monmouth.

== Medieval literature ==
In Geoffrey&#x27;s pseudohistorical &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; (History of the Kings of Britain), Estrildis, the daughter of a king in Germania, was brought to Britain as a captive of Chief Humber the Hun during his invasion following the death of King Brutus. Eventually Humber&#x27;s Huns were defeated by Brutus&#x27; three sons, the eldest of whom—Locrinus—fell in love with the beautiful Germanic princess upon discovering her in one of Humber&#x27;s ships.

Locrinus was forced to honour his prior betrothal to Gwendolen, the daughter of King Corineus of Cornwall, but kept Estrildis as his mistress. For seven years he secretly visited her in a cave beneath Trinovantum (London, i.e., &quot;New Troy&quot;), where she was cared for by servants. Estrildis bore him a daughter, Habren.

When Corineus died, Locrinus deserted Gwendolen and their son Maddan and declared Estrildis his queen. Gwendolen retaliated by raising a Cornish army against Locrinus and defeating him in battle; she then had Estrildis and her daughter, Habren, drowned in a river thereafter called &quot;Hafren&quot; in Welsh and Sabrina by the Romans (which is the River Severn in English).

== Post-mediaeval literature ==
Elstridis and her story feature in &quot;Elstrild&quot; by Charles Tilney (d. 1586), &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; (1590) by Edmund Spenser, &quot;The Complaynt of Elstred&quot; (1593) by Thomas Lodge, and &quot;Locrine&quot; (1887) by Swinburne.

A variant of the story is told by Oliver Mathews, in which Estrildis is called Sŵs-wên, and Locrinus builds Caersws for her.

The story went on to inspire the folktale of Rosamund Clifford, mistress of King Henry II, being hidden in an underground labyrinth.

== Name ==
Her name is probably a Latinized form of the medieval name &quot;Estrild&quot; (), which survived in England only until the 12th century, according to the 1984 &quot;Oxford Dictionary of English Christian Names&quot;.

<text>The World Open is a professional ranking snooker tournament. Throughout its history, the tournament has undergone numerous revamps and name changes. It started out in 1982 as the Professional Players Tournament, but for most of the 1980s and 1990s it was known as the Grand Prix. It was renamed the [[LG]] Cup from 2001 to 2003 before reverting to the &quot;Grand Prix&quot; until 2010. Since then it has been known as the &quot;World Open&quot;.

During 2006 and 2007, it was played in a unique round-robin format, more similar to association football and rugby tournaments than the knock-out systems usually played in snooker. The knock-out format returned in 2008 with an FA Cup-style draw. The random draw was abandoned after the 2010 edition. Judd Trump is the reigning champion, having won the tournament the last two times it was held, in 2019 and 2024.

==History==
The tournament was created in 1982 as the Professional Players Tournament by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association, in order to provide another ranking event along with the International Open. Previously, only the World Championship carried ranking points. Ray Reardon beat Jimmy White 10–5 in the final to win the first prize of £5,000. Reardon became the oldest winner of a ranking event at the age of 50 years and 14 days. This still remains the record.

In 1984 Rothmans started sponsoring the tournament, changing its name to the Grand Prix, and moved its venue to the Hexagon Theatre in Reading. The tournament has had various sponsors and venues since. Previous sponsors include LG Electronics, who took over in 2001 and changed the tournament&#x27;s name to the LG Cup. After LG withdrew their sponsorship, the Grand Prix name was revived for 2004 and was sponsored by totesport. Between 2006 and 2008 the event was sponsored by Royal London Watches.

The tournament was played at the Preston Guild Hall in 1998, at the start of the snooker season, until 2005 (moving once to Telford in 2000). Prize money for 2005 totalled £400,000, with the winner receiving £60,000.

In its original form, the tournament had a flatter structure than most tournaments, with the top 32 players all coming in at the last 64 stage. In other tournaments there used to be only 16 players left when the players ranked 17–32 come in, and then the 16 winners of those matches face the top 16; this structure is now only used for the World Championships.

These facts made it more common to see surprise results than in most other tournaments, with players such as Dominic Dale, Marco Fu, Euan Henderson and Dave Harold all surprise finalists at the time. A player from outside the top 16 has reached the final roughly half the times the contest has been played. Few of those have become consistent stars, although Stephen Hendry and John Higgins took their first ranking titles in the event. In addition, over the years, many top 16 players were eliminated in the early stages of the contest. Taking the 1996 event as an extreme case, thirteen of the top sixteen seeds failed to reach the quarter final stages, and the semi-finals featured one match between two top 16 players (Mark Williams and John Parrott) and another between two unseeded players (Euan Henderson and Mark Bennett); with Bennett and Henderson respectively winning the first two quarter final matches, a surprise finalist was guaranteed before the quarter finals had been completed.

The event moved to Scotland at the A.E.C.C. in Aberdeen for 2006, and introduced a brand new format. Players were split into groups (8 groups of 8 in qualifying, 8 groups of 6 in the final stages) and played every other player in their group once. The top 2 players progressed; the last 16 and onwards were played as a straight knock-out.

This resulted in several surprise results. Little-known players such as Ben Woollaston, Jamie Jones and Issara Kachaiwong made it through qualifying, while stars such as Graeme Dott, Stephen Hendry and Shaun Murphy failed to clear their groups.

The format was slightly tweaked for 2007, after complaints (notably from Dennis Taylor) that the system was too random. Matches increased in length from best-of-5 to best-of-7, to give the better player more chance to win. The main tie-breaker for players level on wins was changed, with frame difference now taking precedence over results between the players who are level on points. Notably, under the 2007 format, 2006 runner-up Jamie Cope would have been eliminated in the groups, as he defeated third-placed Michael Holt but had an inferior frame-difference.

The 2007 event saw fewer surprises, although 2006 World Champion Graeme Dott, 1997 World Champion Ken Doherty, defending champion Neil Robertson, seven-time World Champion Stephen Hendry, six-time World Champion Steve Davis, twice World Champion Mark Williams and 2007 World Championship finalist Mark Selby were all eliminated in the groups. The format was not continued for 2008, due to dwindling ticket sales in the early rounds.

For 2008, the event moved to the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre (SECC) in Glasgow. It went back to a knock-out format with no round-robin. The last 16 and beyond however was played using an FA Cup-style draw, rather than automatically pitching higher ranked players (or their conquerors) against lower-ranked players. In 2009, the event was held in Glasgow, but at another venue, the Kelvin Hall.

Following Barry Hearn&#x27;s takeover of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association, the Grand Prix was reformatted and renamed to World Open. The event gave a chance for amateurs to play alongside professionals. The amateurs had to win 3 matches to qualify for the main draw. On 9 January 2012 it was announced, that the World Open would be held in the next five years in Haikou on the Hainan Island. In November 2014, it was announced that the tournament would not be held in the 2014/2015 season after the contract with the promoter was not renewed and a new venue was not found in time. The event returned in the 2016/2017 season and is now held in Yushan. Between 2020 and 2023, the event was not held due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The 2024 season marked the return of the World Open Championship after its closure during the Covid pandemic. In the final match, Judd Trump from England emerged victorious over the home player Ding Junhui with a score of 10–4, securing his reigning championship title.

==Winners==
==Records==
The 1985 final between Steve Davis and Dennis Taylor is the longest one-day final in snooker history. It lasted 10 hours and 21 minutes.

In the 2005 final, John Higgins set two records:
* His century breaks in the seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth frames marked the first time a player had ever recorded centuries in four consecutive frames in a match during a ranking tournament.
* He scored 494 points without reply, the greatest number in any professional snooker tournament at that time. Currently Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan holds the record with 556 points without reply against Ricky Walden in the 2014 Masters. Stuart Bingham now owns the unanswered points record in a ranking tournament, scoring 547 points without reply at the 2016 China Open against Sam Baird.

John Higgins, Stephen Hendry and Mark Williams are the only players to have won this tournament four times each.

==Media coverage==
The World Open is currently shown live on Eurosport. Prior to the event moving to China, it had been aired extensively on the BBC, which had first covered the tournament in 1984. ITV4 televised the event in 2013.

<doc id="664992" wikidata="Q846517" url="?curid=664992" title="Teach-In (band)">
<text>Teach-In was a Dutch band active from 1967 until 1980. After scoring several top 20 hits in their home country by the early 1970s, the band came to international attention by winning the 1975 Eurovision Song Contest with the song &quot;Ding-a-dong”. Throughout the band&#x27;s career, there were several changes in line-up.

==History==
The group was formed in 1967 in Enschede. The first lineup: Hilda Felix (vocals), Henk Westendorp (vocals, later in Superfly), John Snuverink (vocals, guitar), Frans Schaddelee (bass), leader Koos Versteeg (vocals &amp; keys) and Rudi Nijhuis (drums).

In 1971, only Koos and Rudi remained in the group, and the rest of the band comprised Getty Kaspers (vocals, in 1976 solo as &quot;Getty&quot;), John Gaasbeek (bass, already in 1964 in the Stora Combo (later known as Orkest Freddie Golden, he also left in 1976), Chris De Wolde (guitar) and Ard Weeink (also until 1976). A recording contract was signed with CNR Records and Eddy Ouwens became their producer and co-composer.

Their first single was &quot;Spoke the Lord Creator&quot; (originally a song by Focus), released in 1972, which didn&#x27;t chart.

In 1974 the band had three top 15 hits in the Netherlands: &quot;Fly Away&quot;, &quot;In the Summernight&quot; (which even did reach number 5 in a South African charts) and &quot;Tennessee Town&quot;.

In March 1975, Teach-In participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 1975 with the song &quot;Ding-a-dong&quot; (written by Will Luikinga and Eddy Ouwens) and won. Teach-In broke a Eurovision convention that favours songs performing later in the program by winning the contest despite performing first. This was a first for the competition and was repeated a year later by Brotherhood of Man in the 1976 Eurovision Contest. This feat has only been repeated by one further act; the Herreys in 1984. &quot;Ding-a-Dong&quot; had a chart entry in nearly every European country, as well as a number 22 placing in the USA on the Easy Listening chart. In the Netherlands it reached number 3 in the charts. In October 1975 &quot;Goodbye Love&quot; became another Dutch top 10-hit. &quot;Rose Valley&quot;, released in February 1976, reached just the top 20. Tensions due to the busy concert scheme made Getty Kaspers leave the band, after which she pursued a solo career. Also John Gaasbeek and Ard Weeink quit. Hans Nijland (bass, in 1977 replaced by Nick De Vos), Betty Vermeulen (vocals), Marianne Wolsink (vocals, ex-Head) were included as new members. The group&#x27;s next single &quot;Upside Down&quot; reached number 2 in the Netherlands.

In 1978 the Disco rage nearly destroyed Teach-In&#x27;s popularity. A new look and sound had to be adopted and &quot;Dear John&quot; became a top 10 hit in October. In 1979 a theme song for a Dutch TV charity show supporting Greenpeace hit the top 10. 1980&#x27;s single &quot;Regrets&quot; proved to be the group&#x27;s swan song as the group disbanded soon after.

In 1997, news came that the original line up (with Getty Kaspers) had re-recorded some of their old hits and had plans to tour again.

In June 1979, two ex-members of the group, Getty and John Gaasbeek, joined by Wilma van Diepen, formed the &quot;Balloon&quot; trio. Later on, Getty tried a new solo career, recording a couple of discs including the Getty Album (features De Eerste Liefde is Een Feest with lyrics in Dutch, originally När du tar mig i din famn/The Queen of Hearts by Agnetha Fältskog in Swedish and English). Her vocals can also be heard on Rick van der Linden&#x27;s Cum Laude album and on recordings made by Radio Veronica.

The band reunited to sing &quot;Ding-a-Dong&quot; at a show in Maastricht on 31 August 2007.

The band reunited to perform at the final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2021 as an interval act.

<text>&quot;Ding-a-dong&quot; is a song recorded by Dutch band Teach-In, with music composed by Dick Bakker and lyrics written by Will Luikinga and Eddy Ouwens. It in the Eurovision Song Contest 1975, held in Stockholm, winning the contest. It reached number 1 in both the Swiss and the Norwegian Singles Chart. Teach-In recorded the song in English, Dutch, and German.

== Background ==
=== Conception ===
&quot;Ding-a-dong&quot; was composed by Dick Bakker with lyrics by Will Luikinga and Eddy Ouwens. It is an up-tempo ode to positive thought though the song is written entirely in a minor key. It sings that one should &quot;sing a song that goes ding ding-a-dong&quot; when one is feeling unhappy, with the chorus proclaiming &quot;Ding-a-dong every hour, when you pick a flower. Even when your lover is gone, gone, gone.&quot;

In the original Dutch version the &quot;ding-a-dong&quot; describes the heartbeat of the singer remembering the separation from her lover in the past. As well as &quot;ding-a-dong&quot;, the lyrics also contain &quot;bim-bam-bom&quot; representing a fearful heartbeat and &quot;tikke-(tikke)-tak&quot; for the ticking of the clock while waiting for the lover to return.

=== Eurovision ===
On 26 February 1975, &quot;Dinge dong&quot; –the original Dutch version of &quot;Ding-a-dong&quot;– competed in the of the &quot;Nationaal Songfestival&quot;, the national final organized by Nederlandse Omroep Stichting (NOS) to select its song and performer for the of the Eurovision Song Contest. The song won the three-song competition, so it became the for Eurovision. Once selected, it was performed by the three competing acts: Albert West, Debbie, and Teach-In. Teach-In received more points than their rivals, so they became the performers for Eurovision. Teach-In then recorded the song in Dutch –as &quot;Dinge-dong&quot;–, English –as Ding-a-dong–, and German –as &quot;Ding ding-a-dong&quot;.

On 22 March 1975, the Eurovision Song Contest was held at in Stockholm hosted by Sveriges Radio (SR), and broadcast live throughout the continent. Teach-In performed in English &quot;Ding-a-dong&quot; first on the evening preceding &#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s What Friends Are For&quot; by The Swarbriggs. Harry van Hoof conducted the live orchestra in the performance of the Dutch entry.

At the close of voting, it had received 152 points, placing first in a field of nineteen, winning the contest. The song was the first winner under the current Eurovision voting system whereby each country awards scores of 1–8, 10, and 12.
&quot;Ding-a-dong&quot; was notable for being one of the Eurovision winners that had quirky or entirely nonsensical titles or lyrics, following in the footsteps of Massiel&#x27;s &quot;La, la, la&quot; in and Lulu&#x27;s &quot;Boom Bang-a-Bang&quot; in , and later followed by the Herreys&#x27; &quot;Diggi-Loo Diggi-Ley&quot; in . As the first song was performed during the evening, the victory ran contrary to the fact that success usually went to songs performed later in the broadcast. This was the first of three occasions when the first song would win the contest, the second coming the following year in , and the third in 1984.

=== Aftermath ===
Teach-In performed their song in the Eurovision twenty-fifth anniversary show &quot;Songs of Europe&quot; held on 22 August 1981 in Mysen. On 22 May 2021, the interval act &quot;Rock the Roof&quot; in the Eurovision Song Contest 2021 grand final featured &quot;Ding-a-dong&quot; performed by Teach-In.

<doc id="665005" wikidata="Q6800508" url="?curid=665005" title="McConnell v. FEC">
<text>McConnell v. Federal Election Commission, 540 U.S. 93 (2003), is a case in which the United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of most of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA), often referred to as the McCain–Feingold Act.

The case takes its name from Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, and the Federal Election Commission, the federal agency that oversees U.S. campaign finance laws.

It was partially overruled by &quot;Citizens United v. FEC&quot;, 558 U.S. 310 (2010).

==History==
The case was brought by groups such as the California Democratic Party and the National Rifle Association, and individuals including U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell, then the Senate Majority Whip, who argued that BCRA was an unconstitutional infringement on their First Amendment rights. McConnell had been a longtime opponent of BCRA in the Senate, and had led several Senate filibusters to block its passage.

In early 2002, a multi-year effort by Senators John McCain and Russell Feingold to reform the way money is raised and spent on political campaigns culminated in the passage of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (the so-called McCain-Feingold bill). Its key provisions were 1) a ban on unrestricted (&quot;soft money&quot;) donations made directly to political parties (often by corporations, unions, or wealthy individuals) and on the solicitation of those donations by elected officials; 2) limits on the advertising that unions, corporations, and non-profit organizations can engage in up to 60 days prior to an election; and 3) restrictions on political parties&#x27; use of their funds for advertising on behalf of candidates (in the form of &quot;issue ads&quot; or &quot;coordinated expenditures&quot;).

In May 2003, a three-judge panel of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia ruled three sections of the challenged provisions unconstitutional, and upheld two other sections. The District Court&#x27;s ruling was stayed during the appeal to the United States Supreme Court.

==Oral arguments==
The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a special session on September 8, 2003. On December 10, 2003, it issued a complicated decision totaling 272 pages in length, that, with a 5-4 majority, upheld the key provisions of McCain-Feingold including (1) the &quot;electioneering communication&quot; provisions (which required disclosure of and prohibited the use of corporate and union treasury funds to pay for or broadcast cable and satellite ads clearly identifying a federal candidate targeted to the candidate&#x27;s electorate within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general election); and (2) the &quot;soft money&quot; ban (which prohibited federal parties, candidates, and officeholders from raising or spending funds not in compliance with contribution restrictions, and prohibited state parties from using such &quot;soft money&quot; in connection with federal elections).

==Opinions==
Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor, David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer established the majority for two parts of the Court&#x27;s opinion:
*With respect to Titles I and II of BCRA, O&#x27;Connor and Stevens jointly wrote the opinion of the Court.
*With respect to Title V of BCRA, Breyer wrote the Court&#x27;s opinion.

Because the regulations dealt mostly with soft-money contributions that were used to register voters and increase attendance at the polls, not with campaign expenditures (which are more explicitly a statement of political values and therefore deserve more protection), the Court held that the restriction on free speech was minimal. It then found that the restriction was justified by the government&#x27;s legitimate interest in preventing &quot;both the actual corruption threatened by large financial contributions and... the appearance of corruption&quot; that might result from those contributions.

In response to challenges that the law was too broad and unnecessarily regulated conduct that had not been shown to cause corruption (such as advertisements paid for by corporations or unions), the Court found that such regulation was necessary to prevent the groups from circumventing the law. O&#x27;Connor and Stevens wrote that &quot;money, like water, will always find an outlet&quot; and that the government was therefore justified in taking steps to prevent schemes developed to get around the contribution limits.

The Court also rejected the argument that Congress had exceeded its authority to regulate elections under Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution. The Court found that the law only affected state elections in which federal candidates were involved and also that it did not prevent states from creating separate election laws for state and local elections.

Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote an opinion on titles III and IV of the BCRA, joined by O&#x27;Connor, Souter, Anthony Kennedy, Antonin Scalia, and by the other justices with respect to parts of the opinion. The Chief Justice&#x27;s opinion struck down the provision banning political contributions by minors but ruled that the appellants lacked standing with regard to the rest of the challenges to titles III and IV.

Two dissenting opinions were included in the decision:
*Stevens, joined by Ginsburg and Breyer, dissented on one section of the part of the Court&#x27;s opinion written by Rehnquist.
*Rehnquist, joined by Scalia and Kennedy, issued a 15-page dissent against the Court&#x27;s opinion with respect to Titles I and V of the BCRA.

Three other justices wrote separate opinions on the decision:
*Kennedy issued a 68-page opinion with an appendix, concurring in part and dissenting in part, noting that BCRA forces &quot;speakers to abandon their own preference for speaking through parties and organizations.&quot;
*Scalia issued a separate 19-page opinion, a &quot;few words of [his] own,&quot; because of the &quot;extraordinary importance&quot; of the cases. He argued this standard is an example of incumbents attempting to protect themselves, noting incumbents raise three-times as much hard-money.
*Justice Clarence Thomas issued a separate 25-page opinion arguing that the Court was upholding the &quot;most significant abridgment of the freedoms of speech and association since the Civil War.&quot;

== Reception ==
The holding of the case was determined to be very confusing, although many news sources accurately summarized the main holdings. The Federal District Court for the District of Columbia&#x27;s opinion is likely the longest opinion ever issued by a court in the United States: the opinion was 743 pages.

<text>Highway 11, known locally as the [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|Abbotsford]]–[[Mission, British Columbia|Mission]] Highway, is a long at-grade expressway (With the southernmost part of the highway two lanes) that figuratively cuts the Fraser Valley in half. The highway was first given the &#x27;11&#x27; designation in 1958, and it originally followed South Fraser Way through Abbotsford, being re-routed onto the four-lane Sumas Way in the mid-1980s. Highway 11 originally entered Mission over the same bridge that carries a spur of the Canadian Pacific Railway across the Fraser River, but it was re-routed onto its own bridge, the Mission Bridge, in 1973.

== Route details ==
In the south, Highway 11 begins at the Huntingdon Canada–US border crossing, where it connects with Washington State Route 9. The highway goes north for to its junction with Highway 1. North of Highway 1, the route travels north, passing through two interchanges, before arriving at an intersection with Gladys Road. Highway 11 is facing west at this point, so it turns right onto its own dedicated route. Highway 11 from this point proceeds north for . It passes through the community of Matsqui and an interchange into Matsqui&#x27;s centre, then crosses the Fraser River over the Mission Bridge into Mission, where it terminates at its junction with Highway 7.
== History ==

Highway 11 has been realigned several times since it was first designated in 1958. Until the Mission Bridge was completed in 1973, traffic crossing the Fraser River used a nearby railway bridge. Traffic continued to use Riverside Street until a new alignment and railway overhead was completed in 1979 or 1980. Once the highway crossed the Fraser, the highway turned towards Horne Street, along the present day Horne Street Connector. The current alignment opened in 1984 when a $6.7 million (equivalent to $16.42 million in 2022) route and overpass across the Canadian Pacific tracks opened. North from Abbotsford, the highway met Harris Road at a T-intersection and turned westwards, before turning north again at Riverside Street, continuing until it met the Trans-Canada Trail dyke at the Fraser River. Once over the bridge, the highway ran along Harbour Avenue and subsequently northwards along Horne Avenue towards the split Lougheed Highway.

In Abbotsford, both Gladys Avenue and Railway Avenue were both a part of the highway until the present expressway bypass was opened around late 1986 or early 1987.

The two interchanges on the north side and the CPR overhead were built after the Mission Bridge. The trumpet interchange leading to Horne Avenue was constructed before the CPR overhead, which was completed around 1984. The interchange with London Avenue was completed in November 1998. In 2013, the project of Highway 11 widening at the south end of the Sumas Border to Vye Road was announced. Construction began in June 2021 which was completed in December 2023. It includes an extension of the Nexus lane to reduce travel times and improve safety.

==Major intersections ==
For south to north.

As a player, Capello represented SPAL, Roma, AC Milan and Juventus. He played as a midfielder and won several trophies during his career which lasted over 15 years. He won the Coppa Italia with Roma in 1969, though he was most successful with Juventus, winning three Serie A titles in 1972, 1973 and 1975. With Milan, he won the Coppa Italia again in 1977 and also won another Serie A in 1979. Capello also played internationally for Italy during his career, amassing 32 caps and scoring 8 goals.

In his first five seasons as a manager, Capello won four Serie A titles with Milan, where he also won the 1993–94 UEFA Champions League, defeating Barcelona 4–0 in a memorable final. He then spent a year at Real Madrid, where he won the La Liga title at his first attempt, and in 2001 led Roma to their first league title in 18 years. Capello also won two titles at Juventus (which were later stripped after the &quot;Calciopoli&quot; scandal), and in 2006 returned to Real Madrid, where he won another La Liga title. Overall, he has won a major league championship in seven (or nine, counting the two revoked titles with Juventus) of his 16 seasons as a coach. He is regarded as one of the greatest managers of all time.

Capello was appointed as manager of the England national team in December 2007. During his time as manager, he was successful in tournament qualification, guiding the team to the 2010 FIFA World Cup, where they were knocked out in the second round, and UEFA Euro 2012, where they were knocked out in the quarter-finals under new manager Roy Hodgson. In February 2012, he resigned as manager due to a dispute with The Football Association, before being appointed coach of the Russian national team in July 2012. On 14 July 2015, he was sacked by the Russian Football Union and replaced with Leonid Slutsky. In 2017, he was appointed as the coach of Chinese club Jiangsu Suning, but was sacked the following year, after which he subsequently retired from coaching.

==Club career==
Capello was signed by Paolo Mazza, the President of SPAL, for the fee of two million lire despite interest from Milan. In his second season in the youth team, he helped the club win the Italian Youth Championship and made his first-team debut in a 3–1 away defeat against Sampdoria in Serie A on 29 March 1964. A talented and tactically intelligent holding midfielder, with a good positional sense, he could read the play well and was strong both in the air and in the tackle, in spite of his lack of notable height and unorthodox physique. He usually operated as a deep-lying playmaker in midfield, however, due to his outstanding technique and vision, which enabled him to orchestrate his team&#x27;s attacking moves or create chances for teammates, and furthermore was an excellent passer of the ball with both feet. Going forward he was also equally effective, and possessed an eye for goal from midfield, due to his powerful and accurate shot, as well as his ability at penalty kicks, but he lacked pace, and was notorious for not being particularly hard-working. With SPAL, he made four appearances for a struggling side that was relegated from Serie A. After returning to the top division at the first attempt, Capello became a key player in the 1965–66 season, taking penalties and helping them avoid a swift return to Serie B. He was also called up to the Italian under-23 side alongside teammate Edoardo Reja despite still being a teenager. However, injury to his left knee restricted him to just 16 appearances the following season.

In 1967, Capello moved to Roma where he became a key player for the club. In his first season, he helped them to first place after eight matches, including scoring the winner in a 1–0 victory over Juventus. A recurrence of the injury to his left knee, however, kept him out for the rest of the season and Roma eventually finished in tenth place, just five points away from relegation. The following season, under new manager Helenio Herrera, a fit Capello scored six goals as Roma finished eighth and won his first major trophy, the Coppa Italia. This qualified Roma to play the Anglo-Italian League Cup, where they played Swindon Town. Capello played in both legs against Swindon, Roma winning 2–1 at home in the first leg but losing 4–0 in the second leg at the County Ground. They also reached the semi-finals of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, but were knocked out by Polish side Górnik Zabrze after losing the deciding coin toss following three draws.

He was then sold to Juventus in 1970. He had a poor start to his time there, as he publicly criticised manager Armando Picchi on the same day it was revealed that Picchi had been diagnosed with cancer. Capello escaped with a fine from the club after Picchi insisted that he not receive a suspension. Capello became an influential figure under new manager Čestmír Vycpálek, despite being only 24, and was assigned the number 10 shirt; he largely decided the team&#x27;s tactics for the 1971 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final against Leeds United. Capello scored at the Stadio Olimpico di Torino, but Juventus lost the tie on away goals. Juventus went on to win the league title in the 1971–72, 1972–73 and 1974–75 seasons. They also reached the 1973 European Cup final, where they were beaten 1–0 by the dominant &quot;Total Football&quot; approach of Ajax. They missed out on the chance of winning the double after losing to Milan on penalties in the 1973 Coppa Italia final. Reaching the semi-finals of the 1974–75 UEFA Cup, Juventus were surprisingly beaten by Dutch side Twente.

Juventus were concerned with Capello&#x27;s knee injuries, and so traded him to Milan in exchange for Romeo Benetti and 100 million lire in 1976. He missed just two league starts in the 1976–77 season playing under influential manager Nils Liedholm. However, he was limited to just eight appearances in the 1978–79 title-winning season. He played just three games in the 1979–80 season, before finally accepting that he was unable to continue as a professional footballer.

==International career==
Capello played 32 times for Italy between 1972 and 1978, scoring 8 goals; he made his international debut on 13 May 1972, in a 2–1 defeat to Belgium. He is particularly remembered for a goal with which Italy beat England 1–0 at Wembley Stadium for the first time in its history (14 November 1973), which he himself regarded as the highlight of his playing career. Capello scored the lone goal for Italy against Poland during the 1974 World Cup, though Italy lost the match 2–1 and failed to qualify for the second round of the competition. He was overlooked for the 1978 World Cup even after having good club form with Milan: the manager at that time, Enzo Bearzot, preferred other defensive-minded midfielders such as Marco Tardelli over the more attacking minded Capello.

==Style of play==
Regarded as one of the best Italian players of his generation, Capello was a talented, dynamic, energetic, and tactically intelligent holding midfielder, with a good positional sense and excellent intuition. He could read the play well and was strong both in the air and in the tackle, in spite of his lack of notable height and unorthodox physique. He usually played in the centre of the pitch, however, where he operated as a deep-lying playmaker in midfield, due to his outstanding technique and vision, which enabled him to orchestrate his team&#x27;s attacking moves or create chances for teammates, and was an excellent passer of the ball with both feet. In spite of his playing role, he was an offensive-minded midfielder. Indeed, going forward he was also equally effective as he was creatively and defensively, and possessed an eye for goal from midfield, due to his powerful and accurate shot, as well as his ability at penalty kicks. His offensive movement and ability to make late runs into the area from behind also made him an offensive threat, but at the same time he lacked pace, and was notorious for not being particularly hard-working.

==After retirement==
After several years as a football pundit for Italian TV SPW and a brief spell as caretaker manager of Milan in 1987, Capello became a leading candidate to succeed Arrigo Sacchi as coach of the team, and he was formally appointed as manager of Milan in 1991.

==Managerial career==
===Early years===
As a guest of the SFA, Capello began coaching on a three-week visit to Scotland. He worked with Craig Brown and Andy Roxburgh in the early 1980s. Capello coached training sessions with Clyde at Shawfield in Glasgow and took charge of the Scotland youth team training in Paisley.

Before going into management, Capello spent the early 1980s coaching the Milan youth teams. Bringing through talent such as Paolo Maldini and Alessandro Costacurta, he led the under-19s to numerous youth tournament successes. He completed the last of his coaching badges in 1986. He was promoted to first team coach in 1987, and worked as Nils Liedholm&#x27;s assistant. His first experience as a head coach was leading Milan in the last six games of the 1986–87 season, replacing Liedholm and achieving UEFA Cup qualifications in a play-off with Sampdoria. The following season, however, Silvio Berlusconi hired Arrigo Sacchi as the new &quot;Rossoneri&quot; manager and Capello stepped aside, but still worked for the club.

A student at Coverciano, in 1984 he penned a research article entitled &quot;The Zonal Marking System&quot;. While at Coverciano, Capello acted as general manager for a variety of sports, including baseball, ice hockey, volleyball and rugby union. After standing aside as manager, Berlusconi sent him on high-level business courses.

===First spell at Milan===
Capello replaced Sacchi as Milan manager in June 1991, and was a controversial appointment as he was seen as a Berlusconi &quot;yes-man&quot; compared to the demanding (both on the club&#x27;s finances and on his players) but highly successful Sacchi. Capello largely retained the players and tactical systems put in place by Sacchi, though he replaced ageing central midfielder Carlo Ancelotti with a young Demetrio Albertini and signed goalkeeper Sebastiano Rossi. Allowing for more creative freedom from his attackers, Milan won the Serie A title undefeated in 1991–92.

He spent around £15 million on winger Gianluigi Lentini, breaking the world football transfer record. He also signed Fernando De Napoli, Stefano Eranio, Jean-Pierre Papin, Dejan Savićević and Zvonimir Boban. Already boasting talent such as Marco van Basten, Ruud Gullit, Paolo Maldini and Frank Rijkaard, Capello was one of the first managers to introduce a squad rotation approach. He played Rijkaard and Albertini as deep-lying central midfielders, allowing his wingers more license to attack. Milan dominated the league in the 1992–93 season, defending the Serie A title, and reached the 1993 UEFA Champions League final, losing 1—0 to Marseille. Milan remained unbeaten for 58 league games, between 19 May 1991 and 21 March 1993, which included an entire season in the league, a record in Italian football. They were finally defeated 1–0 by Parma after a goal from Faustino Asprilla.

Building for the 1993–94 season, Capello signed Christian Panucci, Brian Laudrup, Florin Răducioiu and Marcel Desailly. Playing the former defender Desailly as a holding midfielder allowed the rest of the midfield to push on and attack. His side lost 3–2 to São Paulo in the 1993 Intercontinental Cup and 2-1 overall to Parma in the 1993 European Super Cup, but defended the Serie A title, the club&#x27;s third consecutive &quot;Scudetto&quot;, and won the 1994 Champions League final with a 4–0 victory over Johan Cruyff&#x27;s Barcelona &quot;Dream Team&quot;. Due to injuries endured by several of the club&#x27;s attacking stars, in particular Van Basten, Milan only scored 36 goals in 34 games in the league that season, but finished with the best defence in Italy, conceding just 15 goals. The club&#x27;s back four at the time, primarily made up by Mauro Tassotti, Franco Baresi, Alessandro Costacurta and Maldini, is regarded as one of the greatest defences of all time; the club&#x27;s defensive strength under Capello helped Milan&#x27;s goalkeeper Rossi achieve the longest streak without conceding a goal in Serie A history during the 1993–94 season: in an 11-match span, from 12 December 1993 to 27 February 1994, Milan&#x27;s defence went unbeaten for 929 consecutive minutes. The record was broken by Juventus&#x27; Gianluigi Buffon during the 2015–16 season.

With Van Basten and Papin gone, Capello recalled Gullit from Sampdoria and signed winger Paolo Di Canio; Milan struggled at the start of the 1994–95 season, losing in the 1994 Intercontinental Cup to Vélez Sársfield. However, they beat Sampdoria on penalties in the 1994 Supercoppa Italiana (securing the third Supercoppa title in a row), and Arsenal in the 1994 European Super Cup, and reached their third consecutive Champions League final in 1995, where they were defeated by Ajax. They finished in fourth place in the league, however, failing to qualify for the Champions League the following season.

Building for the 1995–96 season, Milan signed strikers George Weah and Roberto Baggio, as well as winger Paulo Futre; this created a selection problem as Capello already had several forwards and wingers in his squad, including Di Canio, Lentini, Savićević, Eranio, Roberto Donadoni and Marco Simone. Capello, however, was once again able to implement a squad rotation policy successfully, and even modified Milan&#x27;s 4–4–2 formation at times, introducing an attacking trident in which the lone striker Weah was supported by Baggio and Savićević, thus allowing the two playmakers to play alongside each other. That season, Milan won the league title, the fourth in five years, by an eight-point margin.

===First spell at Real Madrid===
Capello was unveiled as the new Real Madrid coach in 1996. A major task was combining the attacking talents of Davor Šuker, Predrag Mijatović and Raúl in a single team, which Capello did by playing a three-man attack, in spite of his reputation for cautious and defensive football. A simple but effective tactic would be the long ball from defender Fernando Hierro to a sprinting Roberto Carlos, who would be supported on the left by Mijatović and Raúl; Roberto Carlos would then have the option of either going to goal or passing to Šuker, Mijatović or Raúl. He had a single season in charge of Real guiding the club to the Spanish league title in 1997. Real managed to edge out their bitter rivals Barcelona by just two points. Despite his tenure with &quot;Los Merengues&quot; lasting only a year, he was credited with bringing in a number of players such as Šuker, Mijatović, Roberto Carlos and Clarence Seedorf who helped the club establish their Champions League dominance over the next few years. Despite his success, he fell out with chairman Lorenzo Sanz and was not popular with fans or the Spanish press for &quot;demoting&quot; Raúl to the left-wing.

===Second spell at Milan===
Despite a belief by the Lazio owner Sergio Cragnotti that Capello had made a verbal agreement to coach his club, Capello instead returned to Milan for a brief and less successful spell.
Some of the previous squad had departed, and others such as Franco Baresi were coming to the end of their careers. The squad had to be extensively rebuilt, and high quality signings such as Patrick Kluivert, Leonardo, Winston Bogarde, Christian Ziege, André Cruz and Ibrahim Ba did not gel. The team managed to win just 11 games all season, with a particular low occurring in March 1998 when they lost 4–1 to Juventus and Capello was sent off for protesting a decision by the referee. This was followed by a 5–0 defeat to Roma in May.
Milan finished the 1997–98 Serie A season in tenth place, 30 points behind the champions Juventus, by which time Capello had already departed the club. Some of the players suggested that Capello had instituted a more lax training regime than he had in his previous spell. A run in the Coppa Italia ended when Milan were beaten in the final by Lazio 3–2 on aggregate, despite taking a 1–0 lead in the first leg. Capello took credit for Milan&#x27;s title win the following season claiming, as he had rebuilt the side, that it was &quot;my team&quot;.

===Roma===
Following his dismissal at Milan, Capello took a short break from coaching. He told a reporter that he &quot;sat on a beach and thought about football&quot;. He also enjoyed a spell as a colour commentator for Italian television, participating in coverage of the 1999 Copa América. In May 1999, he moved to Roma, the club he had first joined as a player 30 years prior. His arrival was hailed by Roma president Franco Sensi, who said, &quot;Capello is a winner and I believe in him.&quot; Capello was joined by Franco Baldini, who became the club&#x27;s sporting director. Capello built his side around Marco Delvecchio, sometimes leaving Vincenzo Montella on the bench. Believing his squad lacked a world-class striker, Capello made a move to sign Ruud van Nistelrooy, but the deal was wrecked following a serious injury. His first season saw Roma finish sixth, made particularly disappointing as cross-city rivals Lazio won the title, and they were knocked out of the UEFA Cup by Leeds United.

Capello&#x27;s breakthrough at the club occurred when he won the 2000–01 Serie A title, having signed Walter Samuel to strengthen his defence, and Gabriel Batistuta as a main goalscorer. Although the large fee for Batistuta was initially questioned, the Argentine striker scored a number of vital goals. With Roma, Capello switched from his trademark 4–4–2 to an aggressive 3–4–1–2 formation, which allowed the club&#x27;s star playmaker and captain Francesco Totti to function in his preferred role as an attacking midfielder, while Cafu and Vincent Candela served as attack-minded wing-backs on the flanks. The season began in difficult fashion with Roma struggling for form and an angry fans protest at the club&#x27;s Trigoria training complex which turned violent when players cars were attacked. Capello resisted calls for his resignation, and the team&#x27;s results dramatically improved helped by the performances of the Brazilian midfielder Emerson. The title was sealed with a 3–1 victory over Parma at the Stadio Olimpico on 17 June, prompting a major pitch invasion by the Roma supporters. Capello was praised for fielding Montella, a player he had had a bust-up with just days before due to the fact that he often substituted him for tactical reasons in the second half, in the final match of the season; Montella, along with Totti and Batisuta went on to score in the title-deciding victory.

That was Roma&#x27;s first major honour in a decade and only the third time ever that they had been crowned champions of Italy. Following the title win there was also a widespread belief that he had done a secret deal to succeed Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United. Ferguson had announced his decision to retire, with Capello a leading candidate to replace him allegedly going so far as to meet with the Manchester United chairman Martin Edwards. Capello did little to dispel the rumours when he remarked, &quot;I like the spirit of English football and I would like to work in English football&quot;, adding that it was an honour to be pursued by the club.

Capello&#x27;s link with United eventually came to nothing after Ferguson abandoned his decision to retire and signed a new contract, with Martin Edwards claiming that United had been three or four days away from appointing a new manager, believed to be Capello, when Ferguson changed his mind. The 2001–02 season developed into a battle between Roma and Juventus. After a heated encounter between the teams, Capello used an interview to criticise Luciano Moggi from Juventus, particularly their dealings with players agents.

Capello signed a new contract in April 2002, worth £2.37 million a season. One of the highlights of the season was a 5–1 win over rivals Lazio which saw Montella score four goals. The defence of the title, however, was dealt a major blow when the club drew with bottom-placed Venezia, as Roma finished second in the table behind Juventus by a single point. The following season Roma failed to maintain a serious challenge, and finished in eighth.

Their Champions League ambitions were also ended following a defeat and a draw against Arsenal which saw them finish bottom of their group. Once again, it had been English opposition that had thwarted Roma in Europe. Roma lost the Coppa Italia final to Milan, with Capello particularly angered by supporters who waved banners calling on him to go. Capello&#x27;s final year at Roma began well with the team playing much better football. They went on a seven-game winning streak before Christmas, including comfortable victories over Juventus and Inter Milan. This led to speculation linking him with Juventus, despite his past differences with Luciano Moggi. Capello believed he had taken Roma as far as he could, and began to seriously considered a move. In the run-in, the club&#x27;s form dipped and they ended up finishing 11 points behind champions Milan.

===Juventus===
In 2004, Capello left debt-ridden Roma to sign with Juventus. His move came as a surprise because he had kept it such a secret, and because he had been engaged in a war of words with Luciano Moggi. One of Capello&#x27;s first moves was to sign Emerson from Roma, further angering many of his critics who believed he had betrayed Roma. Capello&#x27;s Juventus reached the quarter-finals of the 2004–05 and 2005–06 Champions Leagues before being eliminated by Liverpool and Arsenal respectively. Juventus also won the 2004–05 and 2005–06 &quot;Scudetti&quot; under Capello&#x27;s leadership, but were later stripped of their trophies due to the team&#x27;s involvement in the &quot;Calciopoli&quot; scandal.

In July 2006, with Juventus in the midst of the aforementioned scandal, Capello resigned as Juventus manager. Press reports strongly linked him with a move back to Real Madrid; new club president Ramón Calderón had publicly stated his hope that Capello would return for a second stint at the club and on 5 July 2006, the official Real Madrid website announced Capello&#x27;s appointment.

===Second spell at Real Madrid===
In 2006, Capello took charge of a Real Madrid side suffering one of the longest spells without a trophy in their history. He quickly drew the disdain of Madrid&#x27;s ardent supporters because of his defensive playing style. In interviews, Capello responded to those critics by saying that the beauty of attacking plays was old. He said that results were much more important than playing beautifully. He also added that &quot;those days are over&quot;. His remit was to bring the title back to Madrid, a task that had been too much for five other coaches since 2003.

In Spain, he was commonly referred to as &quot;Don Fabio&quot;. At Real Madrid, Capello had several high-profile falling outs. He was criticised for not playing David Beckham because of his contract wranglings and Ronaldo, who struggled for fitness and form. Capello also feuded with his compatriot Antonio Cassano; the two had previously had disputes at Roma.

On 20 February 2007, Real Madrid were forced to deny rumours that Capello would be leaving after that day&#x27;s match. The next month, Madrid were again eliminated early from the Champions League by Bayern Munich, and were mired in fourth place in the league, six points behind Barcelona. Despite the unrest, Capello recalled Beckham, whose return was pivotal for the team&#x27;s recovery. A string of successful results in the latter half of the season took Madrid to the top of the table, while Barça&#x27;s results became inconsistent.

Real Madrid won their 30th league title on the final day of the season by beating Mallorca 3–1 at home. The victory was achieved after Capello substituted an injured Beckham and brought on José Antonio Reyes. Madrid had been 1–0 down prior to the substitution and Reyes turned the match scoring two goals. Despite winning La Liga, Capello was sacked on 28 June due to his pragmatic style of play at a club with recent memories of the individualistic and free-flowing, but ultimately unsuccessful, &quot;Galácticos&quot; era.

===England===
Capello was formally appointed as manager of the England national team on 14 December 2007. He began his day-to-day role on 7 January 2008 on a four-and-a-half-year deal. His annual pay was claimed to be £6 million. After being confirmed for the job, he announced it would be his last in football. Capello announced on the day of his unveiling that it was a dream come true to manage the England national team and that he hoped to learn the English language in the following month prior to his first official meeting with the players.

Capello was welcomed by many English fans and the press who hailed his appointment as a triumph, citing in particular his impressive trophy haul and his reputation as a disciplinarian in contrast to the excessive leniency perceived to have existed under his two predecessors, Sven-Göran Eriksson and Steve McClaren. His arrival generated some criticism, notably from then FIFA President Sepp Blatter, who said, &quot;I would say it is a little surprising that the motherland of football has ignored a sacrosanct law or belief that the national team manager should be from the same country as the players.&quot;

England&#x27;s first match with Capello as manager was at Wembley Stadium against Switzerland on 6 February 2008. On 31 January 2008, it was confirmed that a number of senior players including Sol Campbell and David Beckham had not been selected for Capello&#x27;s debut squad. Goalkeeper Paul Robinson was also dropped after recent erratic form. Debut call-ups were handed to two players: Curtis Davies and Gabriel Agbonlahor, both of Aston Villa. Jermaine Jenas and Shaun Wright-Phillips scored in England&#x27;s 2–1 win at Wembley. England lost their second match under Capello, an international friendly against France. England lost the game 1–0 after a Franck Ribéry penalty.

Capello&#x27;s third game in charge was against the United States on 28 May 2008. England won the game 2–0 thanks to goals from John Terry and Steven Gerrard. On 1 June 2008, England beat Trinidad and Tobago 3–0. Capello had been rotating the captaincy around several senior players during his first few matches in charge. On 19 August 2008, he announced that Terry would be named the permanent captain. On 20 August 2008, England drew 2–2 with the Czech Republic after goals from Wes Brown and Joe Cole.

====World Cup qualification====
England opened Capello&#x27;s first competitive campaign with a 2–0 victory over Andorra in Barcelona on 6 September 2008. Four days later, on 10 September, England played Croatia, the team that had already secured a spot at UEFA Euro 2008 in the final qualification matchday but won 3–2 which prevented England from qualifying as well. England won 4–1 with Theo Walcott scoring a hat-trick. The next qualification game was at Wembley just over a month later, on 11 October, against Kazakhstan. The game remained goalless at half-time, but England went on to win 5–1. A fourth-straight win on 15 October made this England&#x27;s best ever start to a World Cup qualifying campaign as they beat Belarus 3–1. England rounded off 2008 by beating Germany 2–1 on 19 November. Goals from Terry and Matthew Upson secured the victory.

In the spring of 2009, England fell to a 2–0 defeat against reigning European champions Spain and beating Slovakia 4–0. In the summer of 2009, England played another friendly against the Netherlands, coming back from 2–0 down to secure a 2–2 draw away from home. Slovenia were beaten 2–1 in Wembley in the same year. England resumed their qualification campaign by beating Ukraine 2–1, on 1 April 2009, at Wembley. On 6 June, they travelled to Almaty and beat Kazakhstan 4–0, and four days later, they returned to Wembley and to beat Andorra again 6–0, making it seven wins out of seven in the qualification campaign. A notable feature of the campaign was the goalscoring form of Wayne Rooney: eight in seven games. With two in the friendly against Slovakia in March 2009, Rooney had scored ten goals in eight England games.

On 9 September 2009, Capello successfully guided England to qualification to the 2010 World Cup following a 5–1 win at home to Croatia. England&#x27;s hopes of a 100% record in their 2010 qualifying campaign were ended with a 0–1 defeat in Ukraine in the final away match. However, a 3–0 victory over Belarus confirmed England as the top scorers in the UEFA zone with 34 goals, 6 ahead of second top scorers Spain. In November 2009, England were beaten 1–0 by Brazil in Qatar, Capello&#x27;s third defeat as England manager.

====2010 World Cup====
In March 2010, England played a friendly against Egypt and beat the African champions 3–1. Two months later, in the last home match before the World Cup, they beat Mexico by the same scoreline. In May 2010, England played a friendly against Japan at UPC-Arena, Graz, and won 2–1. The two goals conceded by Japan were both own goals by Marcus Tanaka and Yuji Nakazawa. After constant speculation linking him with the vacant managerial post at Inter Milan, on 2 June 2010, Capello committed himself to the England job until at least after Euro 2012. England&#x27;s build-up to the World Cup started badly, with John Terry being stripped of the captaincy by Capello after his involvement in a tabloid scandal in February 2010.

Terry&#x27;s successor as captain, Rio Ferdinand, was injured in a training session prior to England&#x27;s opening match, resulting in his withdrawal from the squad. England drew the first game 1–1 with the United States due to an error by goalkeeper Robert Green, after which Capello declared the tournament Adidas Jabulani ball was &quot;impossible to control&quot;. This was followed by a poor display against Algeria, leading to a 0–0 draw and widespread criticism of both Capello and the England team. On 23 June, Capello led England into the round of 16 of the World Cup after they beat Slovenia 1–0. However, they were beaten in their first knockout match 4–1 by Germany.

With Germany leading 2–1, Frank Lampard scored a 20-yard strike. However, even though the ball clearly bounced a full yard over the German goal-line, all the match officials failed to see it and did not award a goal. As England pressed forward in the second half, they conceded two counter-attack goals. Nevertheless, England&#x27;s performance led to much criticism from fans, the media, and pundits alike. After England&#x27;s elimination, Capello was criticized for imposing a strict military regime at England&#x27;s Bloemfontein training camp, and not allowing his senior players to have tactical input. His 4–4–2 formation was derided as &quot;outdated&quot; with Steven Gerrard&#x27;s positioning on the left of midfield also criticized.

Capello&#x27;s squad selection was questioned, with the selection of an unfit Ledley King and out of form Emile Heskey, as well as the surprising omission of Theo Walcott also coming under fire. Capello&#x27;s indecision over his starting goalkeeper was cited as a reason for Green&#x27;s error in England&#x27;s opening match with the United States. On 2 July 2010, The Football Association (FA) announced that Capello would remain as the manager of the England national team following speculation over his future following the World Cup.

====Euro 2012 qualification====
England kicked off their Euro 2012 qualifying campaign with two wins, 4–0 against Bulgaria and 3–1 away against Switzerland, yet could only draw 0–0 against group leaders Montenegro at Wembley. Capello made some changes afterwards, with Ferdinand and Gerrard out of the picture. John Terry was reinstated as captain to much criticism. The traditional 4–4–2 was transformed to 4–3–3, with Darren Bent as centre forward and Rooney as a left-sided forward. The result was successful, as England beat Wales 2–0 at the Millennium Stadium on 26 March 2011. England&#x27;s next game was at Wembley against Switzerland on 4 June 2011, which they recovered from a 0–2 deficit to draw 2–2 with goals from Frank Lampard and Ashley Young.

After a narrow 1–0 win against Wales at Wembley, Capello claimed that several England players were &quot;mentally fragile&quot; and suggested he intended to reinvent his squad once Euro 2012 qualification had been sealed. On 7 October 2011, England qualified for the European Championships with a 2–2 draw in Montenegro.

England completed their campaign with a record of five wins, three draws and no defeats. England completed an unbeaten 2011 with 1–0 friendly victories over Spain and Sweden in November 2011. Capello resigned on 8 February 2012 following the FA&#x27;s removal of the captaincy from John Terry.

===Russia===
On 26 July 2012, Capello became manager of the Russia national team, following the resignation of Dick Advocaat. His first game in charge was a 1–1 draw with Ivory Coast. Capello&#x27;s first competitive game in charge of Russia was the opening match of the 2014 World Cup qualification campaign, a 2–0 victory at home to Northern Ireland. He led Russia into the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification finals, finishing first in Group F. In January 2014, Capello committed his future to the Russia national team until the end of the 2018 World Cup in Russia.

At the 2014 World Cup, Russia were knocked out at the group stage, finishing third after a 1–1 draw against Algeria in their final match. During qualifying for UEFA Euro 2016, Capello had six games as the head coach of Russia with results: two wins, two draws and two losses. On 14 June 2015, Russia lost 1–0 to Austria. Thereafter, on 14 July, Capello was sacked as Russian manager.

=== Jiangsu Suning and retirement ===
On 11 June 2017, Capello signed a contract with Chinese club Jiangsu Suning. The club finished as the 12th (out of 16 teams) in 2017 Chinese Super League. On 28 March 2018, Capello was sacked after only three games into the new season. In April, later that year, he officially announced that he had retired from coaching.

==Style of management==


Considered to be one of the greatest and most successful football managers of all time, Capello has been described as being a &quot;pragmatic&quot; coach, and is known for his tactical versatility and ability to adapt his formations to tactical systems which best suit his players. He was nicknamed &quot;Don Fabio&quot; by the Spanish media during his time with Real Madrid. While he has drawn praise for his success, tactical awareness, leadership, and effectiveness as a manager, as well as for often developing several promising young players, he has also drawn criticism at times from both players and pundits for being overly strict and defensive minded as a coach, which has led to many well-publicised disagreements with several of his players, as well as other managers, including Dejan Savićević, Roberto Baggio, Antonio Cassano, Alessandro Del Piero, Ronaldo, Carlo Ancelotti and Arrigo Sacchi. However, he did like to have players with strong leadership qualities and dressing room personalities in his teams. Capello has described his own coaching philosophy as one of copying and developing. He has also occasionally been criticised by pundits for his perceived arrogance and stubbornness as a manager. In 2008, when writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, David Lacey likened Capello to Alf Ramsey for their shared belief in the importance of a solid defensive base, while also praising him for his ability to identify a problem and deal with it in a quick and successful manner, his ability to command respect in the dressing room and maintain a professional attitude with his players, and his ability to manage press conferences effectively. Capello was known for his defensive style, as well as his use of high pressing and quick counter-attacks to score goals. Due to his strong character and tough personality, Ibrahimović nicknamed Capello &quot;sergente di ferro&quot; in his autobiography (the &quot;iron sergeant,&quot; in Italian).

In his highly successful first spell with Milan, Capello retained many of the players and the 4–4–2 tactical system put in place by Sacchi, although his style of management was less demanding and rigorous than Sacchi&#x27;s, which initially gave his forwards more creative freedom to attack; he also introduced several younger players into the first team. In subsequent seasons, following injuries to several attacking players, he adopted a more conservative 4–1–4–1 formation, in which the team&#x27;s strong defensive line, further protected by Marcel Desailly, a former centre back who was converted to a holding midfielder by Capello, provided the foundation for much of the team&#x27;s success, and also gave the wingers and more creative, offensive-minded midfielders licence to attack. In the final season of his first spell at the club, Capello often rotated several of the team&#x27;s attacking players in order to get the best out of each them without offsetting the balance within the team; he also abandoned the club&#x27;s trademark 4–4–2 formation for a 4–3–2–1 formation at times, featuring an attacking trident that allowed the team&#x27;s two offensive playmakers, Baggio and Savićević, to play alongside each other, behind the club&#x27;s main striker George Weah.

In his first spell with Real Madrid, Capello once again built a title-winning side based on a strong defence and an efficient playing style, but also fielded three strikers – Davor Šuker, Predrag Mijatović, and Raúl – while promoting several other promising young players to the first team. A key component of the team&#x27;s success was the club&#x27;s new left-back Roberto Carlos, who excelled at making overlapping attacking runs to beat the opposition&#x27;s defensive line and get on the end of Fernando Hierro&#x27;s long balls from the back; the role gave him the freedom to either run on goal or look to deliver the ball to one of the team&#x27;s strikers. He was also criticised in the media, however, for using striker Raúl as a left winger at times.

During the 2000–01 title-winning season with Roma, Capello adopted a 3–4–1–2 formation, which made use of a three-man back-line and attacking wing-backs (Cafu and Vincent Candela), while Francesco Totti operated as the team&#x27;s advanced playmaker behind a main striker and a more mobile, creative forward; the offensive trio was supported by two hard-working and aggressive defensive minded midfielders, namely Emerson, and Damiano Tommasi. Following the purchase of talented youngster Cassano the next season, Capello switched to a 3–5–2 formation.

At Juventus, Capello rejected the club&#x27;s board members&#x27; requests to field a three-man front line and once again reverted to his preferred 4–4–2 formation. Capello won consecutive league titles, and put together a balanced and efficient side which was built upon a strong and highly organised back-line, which was further supported by two dynamic, defensive-minded box-to-box midfielders in the centre, such as Manuele Blasi, Stephen Appiah, Alessio Tacchinardi, Emerson, and later Patrick Vieira, who both alternated defensive and playmaking duties in midfield; the team&#x27;s attacking wingers, Pavel Nedvěd and Mauro Camoranesi, were required both to drop back defensively and also assist the strikers from an offensive standpoint. Capello usually partnered the team&#x27;s main striker David Trezeguet alongside the emerging Zlatan Ibrahimović up-front, with the latter playing in a more creative role, while the team&#x27;s captain, Alessandro Del Piero, was used mostly as a substitute. Capello also introduced several younger players into the squad, such as the Romanian striker Adrian Mutu, and left-back Giorgio Chiellini; the latter&#x27;s performances later prompted Capello to bench Jonathan Zebina and shift left-back Gianluca Zambrotta to right-back, in order to accommodate the youngster into the first team.

In his second spell with Real Madrid, Capello implemented a 4–2–3–1 formation, which made use of two defensive-minded full-backs, two defensive midfielders, and two wingers who also often tracked back; however, as a result, the club&#x27;s main striker, Ruud van Nistelrooy, was often isolated, while the team&#x27;s efficient playing style was described as being boring in the media, and Capello was frequently derided for his overly defensive tactics. Despite the criticism he endured, Capello made several bold decisions which allowed several talented players to co-exist, benching Ronaldo, and reinstating David Beckham into the starting line-up, as well as Brazilian forward Robinho, Spanish midfielder Guti, and centre-back Iván Helguera, who were initially out of favour with the manager at the start of the season. He was also able to get the best out of new signings van Nistelrooy, Emerson, Mahamadou Diarra and Fabio Cannavaro, despite their poor form at the beginning of the season. He was consequently able to create an organised, determined, and unified team environment through his disciplined and pragmatic approach; he ultimately led the club to an eight match unbeaten streak to come back from behind and claim the Liga title, although he was sacked at the end of the season.

==Personal life==

Capello was born in San Canzian d&#x27;Isonzo, near Gorizia, in north-eastern Italy, in what was then the Allied-occupied Zone A of the Julian March. His parents were Guerrino and Evelina Capello. Capello is a devout Catholic who prays twice a day, and he has expressed admiration for Pope Benedict XVI. His father, a schoolteacher, played football, and his uncle Mario Tortul was also a football player; for Triestina, Padova, Sampdoria and the Italy national team during the 1960s. Capello has spent his entire adult life working in football. He has been married to his wife Laura, whom he first met on a bus as a teenager, for over 40 years. He is represented by his son Pier Filippo, who acts as his agent. In January 2008, Italian police announced that they were launching an investigation into tax irregularities by Capello. The probe, however, has been dismissed as routine by Capello&#x27;s spokesmen, who said this was part of a wider investigation into a number of wealthy Italians. The FA revealed that they had known about the upcoming probe when they had appointed Capello, and expected no charges to be brought.

Capello is a fine art enthusiast. His art collection is estimated to be worth £10 million. His favourite artist is reportedly Wassily Kandinsky.

Capello holds right-wing political views, despite having previously been a self-described &quot;socialist&quot; in the 1960s, and subsequently a long-time supporter of the Christian Democrats; he was later a long-time supporter of Silvio Berlusconi and his centre-right party Forza Italia. He attracted controversy when he expressed admiration for Spanish dictator Francisco Franco in 2006 and the &quot;legacy of order&quot; he believed him to have left in Spain. He later distanced himself from these comments, however, stating that he did not intend to praise dictatorships. In 2002, he also admitted to having voted for the Northern Italian right-wing separatist political party La Lega once in the past, as well as the Italian Socialist Party and the Republicans in his youth. He has rejected the label of a &quot;conservative,&quot; however, noting that he supported the trade unions, stating: &quot;I have great respect for all they have done to alleviate the exploitation of workers.&quot;

<text>The rhombic triacontahedron, sometimes simply called the triacontahedron as it is the most common thirty-faced polyhedron, is a convex polyhedron with 30 rhombic faces. It has 60 edges and 32 vertices of two types. It is a Catalan solid, and the dual polyhedron of the icosidodecahedron. It is a zonohedron.

The ratio of the long diagonal to the short diagonal of each face is exactly equal to the golden ratio, , so that the acute angles on each face measure , or approximately 63.43°. A rhombus so obtained is called a &quot;golden rhombus&quot;.

Being the dual of an Archimedean solid, the rhombic triacontahedron is &quot;face-transitive&quot;, meaning the symmetry group of the solid acts transitively on the set of faces. This means that for any two faces, and , there is a rotation or reflection of the solid that leaves it occupying the same region of space while moving face to face .

The rhombic triacontahedron is somewhat special in being one of the nine edge-transitive convex polyhedra, the others being the five Platonic solids, the cuboctahedron, the icosidodecahedron, and the rhombic dodecahedron.

The rhombic triacontahedron is also interesting in that its vertices include the arrangement of four Platonic solids. It contains ten tetrahedra, five cubes, an icosahedron and a dodecahedron. The centers of the faces contain five octahedra.

It can be made from a truncated octahedron by dividing the hexagonal faces into three rhombi:
==Cartesian coordinates==

Let be the golden ratio. The 12 points given by and cyclic permutations of these coordinates are the vertices of a regular icosahedron. Its dual regular dodecahedron, whose edges intersect those of the icosahedron at right angles, has as vertices the 8 points together with the 12 points and cyclic permutations of these coordinates. All 32 points together are the vertices of a rhombic triacontahedron centered at the origin. The length of its edges is . Its faces have diagonals with lengths and .

==Dimensions==
If the edge length of a rhombic triacontahedron is , surface area, volume, the radius of an inscribed sphere (tangent to each of the rhombic triacontahedron&#x27;s faces) and midradius, which touches the middle of each edge are:

:formula_1

where is the golden ratio.

The insphere is tangent to the faces at their face centroids. Short diagonals belong only to the edges of the inscribed regular dodecahedron, while long diagonals are included only in edges of the inscribed icosahedron.

== Dissection ==
The rhombic triacontahedron can be dissected into 20 golden rhombohedra: 10 acute ones and 10 obtuse ones.
==Orthogonal projections==
The rhombic triacontahedron has four symmetry positions, two centered on vertices, one mid-face, and one mid-edge. Embedded in projection &quot;10&quot; are the &quot;fat&quot; rhombus and &quot;skinny&quot; rhombus which tile together to produce the non-periodic tessellation often referred to as Penrose tiling.
==Stellations==

The rhombic triacontahedron has 227 fully supported stellations. 
One of the stellations of the rhombic triacontahedron is the compound of five cubes. 
The total number of stellations of the rhombic triacontahedron is .

==Related polyhedra==
This polyhedron is a part of a sequence of rhombic polyhedra and tilings with Coxeter group symmetry. The cube can be seen as a rhombic hexahedron where the rhombi are also rectangles.


==Uses==

Danish designer Holger Strøm used the rhombic triacontahedron as a basis for the design of his buildable lamp IQ-light (IQ for &quot;interlocking quadrilaterals&quot;).
Woodworker Jane Kostick builds boxes in the shape of a rhombic triacontahedron. The simple construction is based on the less than obvious relationship between the rhombic triacontahedron and the cube.

Roger von Oech&#x27;s &quot;Ball of Whacks&quot; comes in the shape of a rhombic triacontahedron.

The rhombic triacontahedron is used as the &quot;d30&quot; thirty-sided die, sometimes useful in some roleplaying games or other places.

<doc id="665027" wikidata="Q840676" url="?curid=665027" title="Fourth power">
<text>In arithmetic and algebra, the fourth power of a number &quot;n&quot; is the result of multiplying four instances of &quot;n&quot; together. So:

:&quot;n&quot;4 = &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot;

Fourth powers are also formed by multiplying a number by its cube. Furthermore, they are squares of squares.

Some people refer to &quot;n&quot;4 as n &quot;tesseracted&quot;, &quot;hypercubed&quot;, &quot;zenzizenzic&quot;, &quot;biquadrate&quot; or &quot;supercubed&quot; instead of “to the power of 4”. 

The sequence of fourth powers of integers, known as biquadrates or tesseractic numbers, is:
:0, 1, 16, 81, 256, 625, 1296, 2401, 4096, 6561, 10000, 14641, 20736, 28561, 38416, 50625, 65536, 83521, 104976, 130321, 160000, 194481, 234256, 279841, 331776, 390625, 456976, 531441, 614656, 707281, 810000, ... .

==Properties==
The last digit of a fourth power in decimal can only be 0 (in fact 0000), 1, 5 (in fact 0625), or 6.

In hexadecimal the last nonzero digit of a fourth power is always 1.

Every positive integer can be expressed as the sum of at most 19 fourth powers; every integer larger than 13792 can be expressed as the sum of at most 16 fourth powers (see Waring&#x27;s problem).

Fermat knew that a fourth power cannot be the sum of two other fourth powers (the &quot;n&quot; = 4 case of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem; see Fermat&#x27;s right triangle theorem). Euler conjectured that a fourth power cannot be written as the sum of three fourth powers, but 200 years later, in 1986, this was disproven by Elkies with:

Elkies showed that there are infinitely many other counterexamples for exponent four, some of which are:

==Equations containing a fourth power==
Fourth-degree equations, which contain a fourth degree (but no higher) polynomial are, by the Abel–Ruffini theorem, the highest degree equations having a general solution using radicals.

<doc id="665030" wikidata="Q681374" url="?curid=665030" title="Monarch flycatcher">
<text>The monarchs (family Monarchidae) comprise a family of over 100 passerine birds which includes shrikebills, paradise flycatchers, and magpie-larks.

Monarchids are small insectivorous songbirds with long tails. They inhabit forest or woodland across sub-Saharan Africa, south-east Asia, Australasia, and a number of Pacific islands. Only a few species migrate. Many species decorate their cup-shaped nests with lichen.

== Taxonomy ==
Some of the one hundred or more species making up the family were previously assigned to other groups, largely on the basis of general morphology or behaviour. The magpie-lark, for example, was assigned to the same family as the white-winged chough, since both build unusual nests from mud rather than vegetable matter. That family, Grallinidae, is now considered a synonym of Monarchidae. It was formerly considered to have four species. The magpie-lark and the torrent-lark were moved into Monarchidae, into the genus &quot;Grallina&quot;, on the basis of molecular evidence. The white-winged chough and the apostlebird were assigned to the family Corcoracidae.

With the new insights generated by the DNA-DNA hybridisation studies of Sibley and his co-workers toward the end of the 20th century, however, it became clear that these apparently unrelated birds were all descended from a common ancestor: the same crow-like ancestor that gave rise to the drongos. On that basis they were previously included as a subfamily of the Dicruridae, along with the fantails, although it is now treated at familial rank as Monarchidae.

More recently, the grouping has been refined somewhat as the original concept of Corvida has proven paraphyletic. The narrower &#x27;Core corvine&#x27; group now comprises the crows and ravens, shrikes, birds of paradise, fantails, monarchs, drongos, and mud nest builders.

The monarchs are small to medium-sized insectivorous passerines, many of which hunt by flycatching.

=== Taxonomic list ===
The monarch family has fifteen genera as follows:

FAMILY MONARCHIDAE
* Subfamily Terpsiphoninae
** Genus &quot;Hypothymis&quot; (4 species)
** Genus &quot;Trochocercus&quot; (2 species)
** Genus &quot;Terpsiphone&quot; – typical paradise flycatchers (17 species)
* Subfamily Monarchinae
** Genus &quot;Chasiempis&quot; (3 species)
** Genus &quot;Pomarea&quot; (9 species of which 3 extinct)
** Genus &quot;Mayrornis&quot; (3 species)
** Genus &quot;Neolalage&quot; – buff-bellied monarch
** Genus &quot;Clytorhynchus&quot; – shrikebills (5 species)
** Genus &quot;Metabolus&quot; – Chuuk monarch
** Genus &quot;Symposiachrus&quot; (23 species)
** Genus &quot;Monarcha&quot; (9 species) 
** Genus &quot;Carterornis&quot; (4 species)
** Genus &quot;Arses&quot; (4 species)
** Genus &quot;Grallina&quot; – magpie-larks (2 species)
** Genus &quot;Myiagra&quot; – broad-billed flycatchers (20 species of which 1 extinct)

== Description ==
The monarchs are a diverse family of passerine birds that are generally arboreal (with the exception of the magpie-larks). They are mostly slim birds and possess broad bills. The bills of some species are quite large and the heavy-set bills of the shrikebills are used to probe dead wood and leaves. The plumage of the family ranges from sombre, such as the almost monochrome black monarch, to spectacular, as displayed by the golden monarch. The tails are generally long and spectacularly so in the paradise flycatchers in the genus &quot;Terpsiphone&quot;. Sexual dimorphism in plumage can be subtle, as in the paperbark flycatcher, where the female is identical to the male except for a slight buff on the throat; strikingly, in the Chuuk monarch, where the male is almost entirely white and the female entirely black; or non-existent, as in the Tahiti monarch. In some species, for example, the Malagasy paradise flycatcher, the males have two or more colour morphs.

== Distribution and habitat ==

The monarchs have a mostly Old World distribution. In the western end of their range, they are distributed through sub-Saharan Africa, Madagascar, and the islands of the tropical Indian Ocean. They also occur in South and Southeastern Asia, north to Japan, down to New Guinea, and most of Australia. The family has managed to reach many Pacific islands, and several endemic genera occur across Micronesia, Melanesia, and Polynesia as far as Hawaii and the Marquesas.

The paradise flycatchers of the genus &quot;Terpsiphone&quot; have the widest distribution of any of the monarchs, ranging across almost all of sub-Saharan Africa, Madagascar, the Mascarenes and Seychelles, southern and eastern Asia as far as Korea, Afghanistan, the Philippines, and the Lesser Sundas. The other paradise flycatcher genus, &quot;Trochocercus&quot;, is restricted to Africa. The other exclusively Asian genus is the &quot;Hypothymis&quot; monarchs. The remaining genera are predominantly found in the Austro-Papuan and Oceania regions. A few monotypic genera are restricted to Pacific islands; these include the Chuuk monarch (&quot;Metabolus&quot;) in the Micronesian island of Chuuk, the Hawaiian Elepaio (&quot;Chasiempis&quot;), and the buff-bellied monarch (&quot;Neolalage&quot;) which is restricted to the islands of Vanuatu. Other Pacific genera are the shrikebills (&quot;Clytorhynchus&quot;) and the &quot;Mayrornis&quot; monarchs, both of which are found in Melanesia and west Polynesia, and the &quot;Pomarea&quot; monarchs, which are exclusively Polynesian in origin.

The majority of the family is found in forests and woodland habitats. Species that live in more open woodlands tend to live in the higher levels of the trees but, in denser forest, live in the middle and lower levels. Other habitats used by the monarchs include savannahs and mangroves, and the terrestrial magpie-lark occurs in most Australian habitats except the driest deserts.

While the majority of monarchs are resident, a few species are partially migratory and one, the satin flycatcher, is fully migratory, although the Japanese paradise flycatcher is almost entirely migratory. The African paradise flycatcher makes a series of poorly understood intra-African migratory movements.

== Breeding ==

The monarchs are generally monogamous, with the pair bonds ranging from just a single season (as in the African paradise flycatcher) to life (the Elepaio). Only three species are known to engage in cooperative breeding, but many species are as yet unstudied. They are generally territorial, defending territories that are around 2 ha in size, but a few species may cluster their nesting sites closely together. Nesting sites may also be chosen close to aggressive species. For example, leaden flycatchers&#x27; nests may be located near the nests of the aggressive noisy friarbird. The nests are in turn often aggressively defended by monarch species. In all species, the nest is an open cup on a branch, fork, or twig. In some species, the nests can be highly conspicuous.

<doc id="665034" wikidata="Q7191839" url="?curid=665034" title="Pierce v. Society of Sisters">
<text>Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510 (1925), was a landmark decision of the United States Supreme Court striking down an Oregon statute that required all children to attend public school. The decision significantly expanded coverage of the Due Process Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution to recognize personal civil liberties. The case has been cited as a precedent in more than 100 Supreme Court cases, including &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, and in more than 70 cases in the courts of appeals.

==Background==

After World War I, some states concerned about the influence of immigrants and foreign values looked to public schools for help. The states drafted laws designed to use schools to promote a common American culture.

On November 7, 1922, under Oregon Governor Walter M. Pierce, the voters of Oregon passed an initiative amending Oregon Law Section 5259: the Compulsory Education Act. The citizens&#x27; initiative was primarily aimed at eliminating parochial schools, including Catholic schools.

The Compulsory Education Act, before amendment, had required Oregon children between eight and sixteen years of age to attend public school. There were several exceptions incorporated into this Act:
#Children who were mentally or physically unable to attend school
#Children who had graduated from eighth grade
#Children living more than a specified distance by road from the nearest school
#Children being home-schooled or tutored (subject to monitoring by the local school district)
#Children attending a state-recognized private school

The Act was amended by the 1922 initiative, which would have taken effect on September 1, 1926; this eliminated the exception for attendees of private schools. Private schools viewed this as an attack on their right to enroll students and do business in the state of Oregon. The act was promoted by groups such as the Knights of Pythias, the Federation of Patriotic Societies, and the Oregon Good Government League. Among the strongest backers of the Act were the Ku Klux Klan, the Orange Order and other anti-Catholic organizations seeking to capitalize on the wave of anti-Catholicism sweeping the nation.

Two sorts of opposition to the law emerged. One was from nonsectarian private schools, such as the Hill Military Academy, which were primarily concerned with the loss of their revenue. This loss was felt almost immediately, as parents began withdrawing their children from private schools in the belief that these would soon cease to exist. The other was from religious private schools, such as those run by the Society of Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary, which were concerned about the right of parents to send their children to parochial schools. ACLU Associate Director Roger Nash Baldwin, a personal friend of Luke E. Hart, the then–Supreme Advocate and future Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus, offered to join forces with the Knights to challenge the law. The Knights of Columbus pledged an immediate $10,000 to fight the law and any additional funds necessary to defeat it.

==Facts of the case==
The Sisters of the Holy Names and Hill Military Academy separately sued Walter Pierce, the governor of Oregon, along with Isaac H. Van Winkle, the state attorney general, and Stanley Myers, district attorney of Multnomah County (of which Portland is the county seat, and where both the Sisters and the Academy were headquartered). The two cases, heard and decided together, were slanted along slightly different lines. The Sisters&#x27; case alleged that &quot;the enactment conflicts with the right of parents to choose schools where their children will receive appropriate mental and religious training, the right of the child to influence the parents&#x27; choice of a school, the right of schools and teachers therein to engage in a useful business or profession.&quot; (268 U.S. 510, 532).

The Sisters&#x27; case rested only secondarily on the assertion that their business would suffer based on the law. That is, its primary allegation was that the State of Oregon was violating specific First Amendment rights (such as the right to freely practice one&#x27;s religion). Their case alleged only secondarily that the law infringed on Fourteenth Amendment rights regarding protection of property (namely, the school&#x27;s contracts with the families).

The Hill Military Academy, on the other hand, proposed this as their only allegation:

The schools won their case before a three-judge panel of the Oregon District Court, which granted an injunction against the Act. The defendants appealed their case directly to the Supreme Court of the United States. The Court heard the case on 16 and 17 March 1925.

==Arguments==
The appellants&#x27; lawyers, Willis S. Moore for the state and district attorneys, and George E. Chamberlain and Albert H. Putney, for the governor, argued that the state had an overriding interest to oversee and control the providers of education to the children of Oregon. One of them even went so far as to call Oregonian students &quot;the State&#x27;s children&quot;. They contended that the State&#x27;s interest in overseeing the education of citizens and future voters was so great that it overrode the parents&#x27; right to choose a provider of education for their child, and the right of the child to influence the parent in this decision. With respect to the appellees&#x27; claims that their loss of business infringed on Fourteenth Amendment rights, the appellants&#x27; lawyers countered that since appellees were corporations, not individuals, the Fourteenth Amendment did not directly apply to them. In addition, they asserted, the revenues of a corporation were not property, and thus did not fall under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Finally, they argued that since the law was not scheduled to take effect until September of the following year, the suits were brought prematurely — to protect against a possible coming danger, not to rectify a current problem.

The appellees, represented by Hall S. Lusk, replied that they were not contesting the right of the state to monitor their children&#x27;s education, only its right to absolute control of their choice of educational system:

&quot;No question is raised concerning the power of the state reasonably to regulate all schools, to inspect, supervise and examine them, their teachers and pupils; to require that all children of proper age attend some school, that teachers shall be of good moral character and patriotic disposition, that certain studies plainly essential to good citizenship must be taught, and that nothing be taught which is manifestly inimical to the public welfare.&quot; (268 U.S. 510, 534)

Further, they replied that although the state had a powerful interest in their children&#x27;s education, the interest was not so strong as to require the state&#x27;s of an educational choice of this sort. Barring a great emergency, they claimed, the state had no right to require their children to attend, or not to attend, any particular sort of school.

==Decision==
The Court deliberated for about 10 weeks before issuing its decision on June 1, 1925. The Court unanimously upheld the lower court&#x27;s decision, and the injunction against the amended Act.

Associate Justice James Clark McReynolds wrote the opinion of the Court. He stated that children were not &quot;the mere creature[s] of the state&quot; (268 U.S. 510, 535), and that, by its very nature, the traditional American understanding of the term &quot;liberty&quot; prevented the state from forcing students to accept instruction only from public schools. He stated that this responsibility belonged to the child&#x27;s parents or guardians, and that the ability to make such a choice was a &quot;liberty&quot; protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.

With respect to the discussion of whether the schools&#x27; contracts with parents constituted property protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, McReynolds agreed that since the schools were corporations, they were not technically entitled to such protections. However, he continued, &quot;they have business and property for which they claim protection. These are threatened with destruction through the unwarranted compulsion which appellants are exercising over present and prospective patrons of their schools. And this court has gone very far to protect against loss threatened by such action.&quot; (268 U.S. 510, 535)

McReynolds also agreed that businesses are not generally entitled to protection against loss of business subsequent to &quot;exercise of proper power of the state&quot; (268 U.S. 510, 535). However, citing a number of relevant business and property law cases, he concluded that the enactment of the revised Act was not &quot;proper power&quot; in this sense, and constituted unlawful interference with the freedom of both schools and families.

In response to the claims by the appellants that the suits were premature, attempting to prevent rather than to rectify a problem, Justice McReynolds simply referred them to the evidence provided by the appellees showing that the schools were already suffering falling enrollments.

==Legacy==

This decision marked the start of the Supreme Court&#x27;s recognition that due process protected individual liberties; specifically, the Court recognized that the Fourteenth Amendment applies to entities other than individuals, and recognized the scope of liberties or rights which it protected included personal civil liberties. Over the course of the next half century, that list would come to include the right to marry, to have children, or to marital privacy.

Because the statute &quot;Pierce v. Society of Sisters&quot; struck down was primarily intended to eliminate parochial schools, Justice Anthony Kennedy has suggested that the case could have been decided on First Amendment grounds. Indeed, as mentioned, that was the primary legal argument the lawyers representing the Sisters advanced. Seven days later, in &quot;Gitlow v. New York&quot;, the Supreme Court confirmed that the free Speech Clause of the First Amendment applies against the states.

The right of parents to control their children&#x27;s education without state interference became a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; following the case, and religious groups proactively defended this right from state encroachment. R. Scott Appleby wrote in the &quot;American Journal of Education&quot; that this led to a &quot;remarkably liberal&quot; education policy wherein religious schools are not subjected to state accreditation but only to &quot;minimal state health and safety&quot; laws.

<text>Police Squad! is an American crime comedy television series that was broadcast on the ABC network in 1982. It was created by David Zucker, Jim Abrahams, and Jerry Zucker, starring Leslie Nielsen as Frank Drebin. A spoof of police procedurals and many other television shows and movies, the series features Zucker, Abrahams, and Zucker&#x27;s usual sight gags, wordplay, and non sequiturs. It resembles the Lee Marvin police show &quot;M Squad&quot; (in particular the opening credits) and the late 1960s series &quot;Felony Squad&quot;. It was canceled after six episodes, and yielded &quot;The Naked Gun&quot; film series from 1988 to 1994.

==Overview==
&quot;Police Squad!&quot; was created by David Zucker, Jim Abrahams, and Jerry Zucker (ZAZ), who had previously worked on the films, &quot;The Kentucky Fried Movie&quot; (1977) and &quot;Airplane!&quot; (1980). ZAZ wanted to make another spoof film similar to &quot;Airplane!&quot;, using the television series &quot;M Squad&quot; as a basis for the spoof. Lacking an overarching plot to the concept, Paramount Pictures president Michael Eisner instead secured them a six-episode television series, despite ZAZ wanting to make it into a film.

The show aired as a mid-season replacement in March 1982, but was taken off the schedule after four episodes. The remaining two episodes were dumped onto the summer schedule in place of the usual summer reruns. Against critical acclaim, the show was canceled by ABC after just six episodes. The show gained a strong cult following through repeat broadcasts on cable channels.

Alan North played Captain Ed Hocken, and Peter Lupus co-starred as Officer Norberg. In the films, those roles were played by George Kennedy and O. J. Simpson respectively, with Norberg renamed Nordberg. The only actors who reprised their roles in the films are Leslie Nielsen, Ed Williams as scientist Ted Olson, and Ronald &quot;Tiny Ron&quot; Taylor as the very tall Al. Joyce Brothers played herself in the fourth episode and in &quot;The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!&quot;. Robert Goulet, one of the &quot;special guest stars&quot; killed during the title sequence, plays the villain Quentin Hapsburg in &quot;The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear&quot;.

==Episodes==
Each episode&#x27;s voiced title differs from that displayed on screen. In the following list, the voiced title is in parentheses.
==Cast==

*Leslie Nielsen as Frank Drebin, detective lieutenant of Police Squad. Jerry Zucker explained that the name Drebin was picked blindly from the phone book. Zucker, Abrahams, and Zucker had met Nielsen when working on &quot;Airplane!&quot; (1980) and decided that their kind of humor matched. The team said that Nielsen would be perfect as Drebin, as the character lampooned the roles that Nielsen had played in television dramas such as &quot;The Bold Ones: The Protectors&quot; and &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot;.
*Alan North as Ed Hocken, captain of Police Squad and Drebin&#x27;s superior officer. in &quot;The Naked Gun&quot; film series, the role was recast to George Kennedy.
*Peter Lupus as Norberg, a dimwitted officer who serves under Drebin. In &quot;The Naked Gun&quot; films, the character was slightly renamed to &quot;Nordberg&quot; and recast to O.J. Simpson.
*Ed Williams as Ted Olson, a lab technician at Police Squad. Prior to being cast, Williams had been a science teacher for many years and had some previous acting experience. Zucker, Abrahams, and Zucker were amazed by his performance.
*William Duell as Johnny the Snitch, a shoeshiner who acts as an informant for Drebin on multiple cases. Johnny is the only recurring character from &quot;Police Squad!&quot; to not appear in any of &quot;The Naked Gun&quot; films.
*Ronald &quot;Tiny Ron&quot; Taylor as Al, an abnormally tall officer whose head is always placed out of frame.

Rex Hamilton is also credited in every episode as &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;, with the same clip in all opening credits as his only appearance.

==Production==
===Opening sequence===

The show&#x27;s opening sequence is a satire on traditional crime-drama opening sequences, particularly those of &quot;M Squad&quot; and various Quinn Martin shows such as &quot;The Fugitive&quot; and particularly &quot;The New Breed&quot; (which also stars Nielsen). Hank Simms, who had worked as an announcer for some of Martin&#x27;s programs, announced the title of each episode, though the spoken title never matches the title caption. The sequence introduces Nielsen and North during a shootout, and Abraham Lincoln impersonator Rex Hamilton, who dramatically returns gunfire to John Wilkes Booth, as his only appearance.

Another recurring gag in the opening credits sequence is the &quot;special guest star&quot;, a celebrity who is introduced but immediately murdered. These special guest stars are Lorne Greene, Georg Stanford Brown, Florence Henderson, William Shatner, Robert Goulet, and William Conrad. John Belushi was slated as &quot;special guest star&quot; for the fifth episode and a scene with Belushi tied to blocks of concrete under water was filmed. Following Belushi&#x27;s unexpected death in March 1982, the scene was replaced with footage of Florence Henderson before the episode was broadcast the following July. Belushi&#x27;s accidental death shocked Zucker, Abrahams, and Zucker, as they had joked about it after he had nearly choked during the filming of the scene. A list of possible celebrity death shots was included in the DVD release.

===Writing===
The show was intended to mock police dramas in the same way in which &quot;Airplane!&quot; mocks disaster movies. Zucker, Abrahams, and Zucker wrote the pilot episode, in which most straight lines were directly copied from an &quot;M Squad&quot; episode. The pilot episode is a near scene-for-scene remake of &quot;More Deadly&quot;, the opening episode of the second season of &quot;M Squad&quot;. Pat Proft, who had worked with Zucker, Abrahams, and Zucker on &quot;The Kentucky Fried Movie&quot; (1977) and &quot;Airplane!&quot; (1980), wrote the third episode. Robert Wuhl was invited to join the writing staff after he had auditioned for the lead role in &quot;Airplane!&quot;. He co-wrote the show&#x27;s second and sixth episodes with Tino Insana. Both episodes contain cultural references to old movies such as &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; and &quot;The French Connection&quot;. In Wuhl&#x27;s audio commentary for the DVD, he mentioned that it was a nice opportunity, but that he did not really feel a connection with the show, especially because of its short run.

===Direction===
The first episode of &quot;Police Squad!&quot; was directed by Jim Abrahams, David Zucker, and Jerry Zucker. Two of the show&#x27;s six episodes were directed by filmmaker Joe Dante, who recalled in 2008,

I knew the Zuckers from second unit on &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll High School&quot; and &quot;Kentucky Fried Movie&quot; and had turned down &quot;Airplane!&quot; – don’t ask! When they got &quot;Police Squad!&quot; going, they asked me to do the second one. It only lasted six episodes, two of which I directed.

ABC had no idea what to do with the show, which had no laugh track and resembled a rerun of a ’60s program. The network kept changing the time slot so no one could find it, and people casually switching it on thought it really was an old TV show! Like they did in their features, the boys used real TV episodes as their template, mostly a ’50s Lee Marvin series called &quot;M Squad&quot;. It was lots of fun to do and was the first thing I ever directed on a studio lot. I prefer the TV show to the later &quot;Naked Gun&quot; movies.

==Cancellation==
ABC announced the cancellation of &quot;Police Squad!&quot; after four of its six episodes had aired in March 1982. The final two episodes were aired that summer. In an interview for the DVD release of the series, Nielsen said ABC entertainment president Tony Thomopoulos asserted &quot;Police Squad!&quot; was canceled because viewers had to pay close attention to the show in order to get much of the humor: &quot;the viewer had to watch it in order to appreciate it&quot;. Nielsen also thought the premise was more effective in the successful &quot;Naked Gun&quot; films because the much larger screen size in a cinema increases the efficacy of the visual gags. In its annual &quot;Cheers and Jeers&quot; issue, &quot;TV Guide&quot; magazine called the explanation for the cancellation &quot;the most stupid reason a network ever gave for ending a series&quot;.

==Home media==
In 1985, Paramount Home Video first released all six episodes of the show on VHS, Betamax, and LaserDisc formats as two separate volumes: &quot;Police Squad!: Help Wanted!&quot; and &quot;More! Police Squad!&quot;, each with three episodes in their production order. Paramount and CBS DVD first released the series on DVD in 2006 in a keep case on one disc. The episodes are in airing order from ABC. The DVD extras include production notes from network executives, a &quot;freeze-frame&quot; that was filmed but never used, bloopers, casting tests, and an interview with Nielsen. Zucker, Abrahams, and Zucker, producer Robert K. Weiss, and writer Robert Wuhl recorded audio commentary for the first, third, and sixth episodes. Critics universally praised how the show was still funny after more than 20 years. The series was released in Blu-ray format in the US on April 14, 2020.

==Legacy==
===&quot;Naked Gun&quot; film series===

After the cancellation of &quot;Police Squad!&quot;, ZAZ returned to films, creating the comedies &quot;Top Secret!&quot; and &quot;Ruthless People&quot;. At this point, they were able to identify a narrative to apply to the &quot;Police Squad!&quot; formula for a theatrical film by adding a romantic plotline, and the film &quot;The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!&quot; was readily greenlit by Paramount. It performed well at the box office, grossing around $78,756,177. The film lead to the &quot;Naked Gun&quot; trilogy with two sequels, &quot;The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear&quot; (1991) and &quot;Naked Gun : The Final Insult&quot; (1994), were released. &quot;The Naked Gun : The Smell of Fear&quot; was considered the most successful of the three, grossing around $86,930,411, and &quot;Naked Gun : The Final Insult&quot; grossed $51,132,598. Roger Ebert rated the first movie out of four stars and gave three stars to each of the two following films.

===Spin-offs===
A series of British advertisements for Red Rock Cider were made in the same style, with the opening titles changed to other names such as &quot;Fraud Squad&quot; or &quot;Fried Squid&quot;, and featuring Leslie Nielsen. The advertisements were shown in British cinemas as well as on television. They were directed by John Lloyd, with such apparent success that Zucker, Abrahams, and Zucker approached him to direct &quot;Naked Gun : The Final Insult&quot;, but he turned them down. During the WWE&#x27;s SummerSlam 1994 pay-per-view event, the &quot;Police Squad!&quot; characters look for The Undertaker, who had previously vanished.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Police Squad!&quot; has an aggregate score of 90% based on 28 positive and three negative critic reviews. The website’s consensus reads: &quot;Wacky, inventive, and endlessly quotable, &quot;Police Squad!&quot; is a hysterically funny leap forward for TV comedy that was tragically ahead of its time.&quot;

Upon the home video release in 1985, &quot;Washington Post&quot; critic Tom Shales commented &quot;People can rent them and laugh, and then cry that ABC was so cruel.&quot; In 2009, the DVD set was nominated for a Satellite Award for Best DVD Release of a TV Show, though it lost to the DVD set of the eighth season of Fox&#x27;s &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. In 2013, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked it #7 on its list of 60 shows that were &quot;Cancelled Too Soon&quot;.

Matt Groening, creator of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, has said, &quot;If &quot;Police Squad!&quot; had been made twenty years later, it would have been a smash. It was before its time. In 1982 your average viewer was unable to cope with its pace, its quick-fire jokes. But these days they&#x27;d have no problems keeping up, I think we&#x27;ve proved that.&quot;

<doc id="665039" wikidata="Q523865" url="?curid=665039" title="Dru Drury">
<text>Dru Drury (4 February 1725 – 15 December 1803) was a British collector of natural history specimens and an entomologist. He received specimens collected from across the world through a network of ship&#x27;s officers and collectors including Henry Smeathman. His collections were utilized by many entomologists of his time to describe and name new species and he is best known for his book &quot;Illustrations of natural history&quot; which includes the names and descriptions of many insects, published in parts from 1770 to 1782 with most of the copperplate engravings done by Moses Harris.

== Life ==
Dru Drury was born in Wood Street, London. His father, also Dru Drury, was a citizen, goldsmith and silversmith of the City of London. Drury&#x27;s great-grandfather, William, Lord of the Manor of Colne, was Sheriff of Cambridgeshire in 1676. The Drury family traced back to a Thomas Drury, of Fincham, Norfolk, who died in 1545. Descendants of Dru Drury retained the status of citizen and goldsmith of the City of London until at least 1969.

Drury apprenticed to his father in the Goldsmith&#x27;s Company in 1739 and became a liveryman in 1751. In 1748 he married Esther, the daughter of his father&#x27;s fourth wife from an earlier marriage to soapmaker John Pedley of London. Drury then inherited his father&#x27;s business and became the owner of several freehold houses in London and Essex. By 1771 he was earning nearly £2000 a year and had amassed enough wealth to buy the entire stock of a fellow silversmith, Nathaniel Jeffreys. Despite his wealth, he was forced into bankruptcy in 1777 after he was cheated by two Yorkshire cutlers, William Tate and John Wheate. Assisted by Joseph Banks, John Fothergill, and other friends, he resumed business but retired in 1789 to devote all his time to entomology. Drury and his wife had three children, Mary, born 1749; William (who became a silversmith) born 1752; and Dru, born 1767. He spent his retirement between London and Broxbourne, Hertfordshire where he collected insect specimens. Around 1797 the family moved to Turnham Green but Drury began to face ill health starting with stones in his bladder. Other complications followed and he died in the home of his son in the Strand on 15 January 1804. He was buried at St. Martin-in-the-Fields on 21 January.

==Natural history career==
Drury was keenly interested in entomology even before retiring as a silversmith and was the president of the Society of Entomologists of London from 1780 to 1782. He was also a member of the Linnean Society. Beginning in 1770, Drury corresponded with a number of entomologists from all over the world from India to Jamaica and America. He offered 6 dimes for any insect of any size from officers of merchant ships travelling afar. He also had a three-page pamphlet on instructions for collecting. It is through these connections that Drury received much of his collection. (26) To Mr. Keuchan, at Jamaica. June 13, 1774.You inquire after Mr. Smeathman, who is settled on the Coast of Africa. He, has been there almost three years but has sent nothing over except insects, a circumstance which astonishes us, for his patrons expected a great variety of subjects long before this in ye different branches of Natural History. Many of the insects that he has sent are surprisingly fine. A great number entirely new, especially among, the Coleoptera, some of which are very large. --From a collection of letters published in &quot;The Scientific Monthly&quot;.From 1770 to 1782, he published the three-part &quot;Illustrations of Natural History, Wherein are Exhibited Upwards of 240 Figures of Exotic Insects&quot;, with copperplates by Moses Harris and Peter Mazell. This was later revised and republished under the title &quot;Illustrations of Exotic Entomology&quot; in 1837. A German translation of the first volume was published by Georg W. F. Panzer. Drury&#x27;s work was self-published and many of his correspondences with various workmen in the publishing industry have survived. In the letters, detailed accounts of prices and publishing techniques are provided which shed light on Britain&#x27;s early printing industry. The original drawings for this book, by Moses Harris and Mary Gartside, were recently rediscovered in rural Virginia, USA.

One of Drury&#x27;s special hunts was for a specimen of the Goliath beetle. A specimen had been obtained by William Hunter and was lent to Emanuel Mendes da Costa. Da Costa had drawings of the beetle made by Moses Harris but before it could be published he was embroiled in an embezzlement scandal in the Royal Society which led to a prison term. The drawing however was bought by Drury and it went into Drury&#x27;s book with Westwood&#x27;s name of &quot;Goliathus druryi&quot;. Hunter was understandably angry with what he saw as &quot;theft&quot; and Drury subsequently made a special search for another specimen of the beetle. A specimen was sent by Henry Smeathman but Drury misidentified it. Drury was also interested in rocks and minerals and took a special interest in the distribution of gold around the world. He also took an interest in gardening, angling in the River Lea, and in making his own wines.

Drury&#x27;s collection comprised over 11,000 specimens. Many species were described and given their binomial names by contemporary entomologists like J.C. Fabricius, Ernest Olivier, and Kirby:
After his death, the collections were sold in a three-day auction by King and Lochee and earned £614 8s. 6d. with an additional £300 for his cabinets and books. A catalogue of the collections was published. Unfortunately, Drury&#x27;s collections, while large, lacked substantial location and other data (as it was not customary at the time). Thus, it is difficult, if not impossible, for any sound scientific data to be formed in regards to the history of its specimens. 

Drury&#x27;s illustrations, mostly by Moses Harris, were published in three volumes (1770, 1773, 1782), and the original paintings, inherited through his descendants, were sold at auction in London in March 1964. They are now in the Oak Spring Garden Library, Upperville, Virginia USA.

<text>Tamil Jains (Tamil Samaṇar, from Prakrit &quot;samaṇa&quot; &quot;wandering renunciate&quot;) are ethnic-Tamils from the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, who practice Jainism (Tamil ). The Tamil Jain is a microcommunity of around 85,000 (around 0.13% of the population of Tamil Nadu). They are predominantly scattered in northern Tamil Nadu, largely in the districts of Tiruvannamalai, Kanchipuram, Vellore, Villupuram, Ranipet and Kallakurichi.
Early Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions in Tamil Nadu date to the third century BCE and describe the livelihoods of Tamil Jains. &quot;Samaṇar&quot; wrote much Tamil literature, including the important Sangam literature, such as the &quot;Nālaṭiyār&quot;, the &quot;Cilappatikaram&quot;, the &quot;Valayapathi&quot; and the &quot;Civaka Cintamani&quot;. Three of the five great epics of Tamil literature are attributed to Jains.

==History==
===Origins===

Some scholars believe that Jain philosophy must have entered South India some time in the sixth century BCE. 

According to other scholars, Jainism must have existed in South India well before the era of Jain tirthankara Lord Mahaveer Swami. There are plenty of caves as old as fourth century with Jain inscriptions and Jain deities found around Madurai, Tiruchirāppaḷḷi, Kanyakumari and Thanjavur.

A number of Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions have been found in Tamil Nadu that date from the second century BCE. They are regarded as associated with Jain monks and lay devotees.

The exact origins of Jainism in Tamil Nadu is unclear. However, Jainism flourished in Tamil Nadu at least as early as the Sangam period. Tamil Jain tradition places their origins are much earlier. The Ramayana mentions that Rama paid homage to Jain monks living in South India on his way to Sri Lanka. Some scholars believe that the author of the oldest extant work of literature in Tamil (3rd century BCE), Tolkāppiyam, was a Jain Shraman.

Tirukkural by Thiruvalluvar is considered by many to be the work of a Jain by scholars like V. Kalyanasundarnar, Vaiyapuri Pillai, Swaminatha Iyer, and P. S. Sundaram. It emphatically supports strict vegetarianism (or veganism) (Chapter 26) and states that giving up animal sacrifice is worth more than thousand burnt offerings (verse 259).

Silappatikaram, the earliest surviving epic in Tamil literature, was written by a Samaṇa, Ilango Adigal. This epic is a major work in Tamil literature, describing the historical events of its time and also of then-prevailing religions, Jainism, Buddhism and Shaivism. The main characters of this work, Kannagi and Kovalan, who have a divine status among Tamils, Malayalees and Sinhalese were Jains.

According to George L. Hart, who holds the endowed chair in Tamil Studies by University of California, Berkeley, has written that the legend of the Tamil Sangams or &quot;literary assemblies&quot;, was based on the Jain &quot;sangham&quot; at Madurai:
There was a permanent Jain assembly called a Sangha established about 604 CE in Madurai. It seems likely that this assembly was the model upon which tradition fabricated the Sangam legend.

Jainism became dominant in Tamil Nadu in the fifth and sixth century CE, during a period known as the &quot;Kalabhra interregnum&quot;.

===Decline and survival===
Jainism began to decline around the eighth century CE, with many Tamil kings embracing Hindu religions, especially Shaivism. Still, the Chalukya, Pallava and Pandya dynasties embraced Jainism. The Shaivite legend about the impalement of the Jains in Madurai claims that 8000 Jains were impaled after they lost a contest against the Saivites, Thirugnana Sambandhar was invited by the queen of Madurai to check the atrocities against Jains and their influence on the King; however, this legend is not mentioned in any Jain text According to Paul Dundas, the story represents the abandonment of Madurai by Jains for various reasons or the gradual loss of their political influence.

Jainism survived in the region during the period of decline. The Melsithamur matha was established by a monk Shantisager who arrived from Shravanabelgola sometime during the 9-12th century period as attested by the 12th century inscriptions. A Jain center associated by Acharya Akalanka in the eighth century survives at Thiruparuttikundram near Kanchi. The Tamil Jain texts of this period include 13th-century (orlater) Aruṅkalacceppu, 14th cent. Mērumantarapūrāṇam and the 15th-century Śrīpurāṇam.

===Revival===
When India became independent in 1947, Madras Presidency became Madras State, comprising present day Tamil Nadu, coastal Andhra Pradesh, South Canara district Karnataka, and parts of Kerala. The state was subsequently split up along linguistic lines. In 1969, Madras State was renamed Tamil Nadu, meaning &quot;Tamil country&quot;.
Acharya Nirmal Sagar was the first Digambar Jain monk to reenter Tamilnadu in 1975 after a gap of several centuries. After him some of the Jain nuns have visited Tamilnadu resulting in a renaissance of Jainism among the Tamil Jains. Many abandoned and crumbling temples have been renovated as a result of renewed interaction between Tamil Jains and the Jains from the rest of India. Financial grants have been provided by Bharatiya Digambar Jain Tirth Samrakshini Mahasabha and the Dharmasthala institutions. Local Jain scholars and activists have started &quot;Ahimsa walks&quot; to bring attention to the Tamil Jain heritage.

===Archaeological evidences===
Archaeological remains in Tamilnadu are discovered time to time that attest to popularity of Jainism in Tamilnadu. Most of the rock inscriptions are related to the Jain ascetics who used to commonly reside in hill caves.
The ruins of Anandamangalam vestiges were discovered in &quot;Anandamangalam&quot;, a small hamlet near &quot;Orathi&quot; village in Kancheepuram district of Tamil Nadu. The ruins had the rock-cut sculptures of &quot;yakshini&quot; (tutelary deity) Ambika and tirthankara Neminatha and Parshvanatha.

==Population==
The total number of Jains in Tamil Nadu as per 2011 Indian census is 83,359, which forms 0.12% of the total population of Tamil Nadu (72,138,958). This include the Jains who have migrated from North India (mainly Rajasthan and Gujarat). The population of Tamil Jains is estimated to be 25,000-35,000.
The Tamil Jains are ancient natives of Tamil Nadu and belong to the Digambara sect. They generally use the title Nainar. A few in Thanjavur District, use Mudaliar and Chettiar as titles.
The former North Arcot and South Arcot (now Tiruvannamalai, Vellore, Cuddalore and Villupuram Districts) districts have a large number of Jain temples, as well as a significant population of Tamil Jains.

At present, most of the Tamil Jains are from the Vellalar social group. The present Hindu members of this sect are originally believed to have been Jain before they embraced Hinduism. The Tamil Jains refer to the Shaiva Vellalar as &quot;nīr-pūci-nayinārs&quot; or &quot;nīr-pūci-vellalars&quot; meaning the Vellalars who left Jainism by smearing the sacred ash or &quot;(tiru)-nīru&quot;. While some of the Jains assign this conversion to the period of the Bhakti movement in Tamil nadu others link it to a conflict with a ruler of the Vijayanagara empire in the 15th century. The villages and areas settled by the Shaiva Vellalar even now have a small number of Jain families and inscriptional evidence indicate that these were earlier Jain settlements as is evident by the existence of old Jain temples.

The title Nainar has been used since antiquity for Jain monks. In Cilappatikaram a Jain temple is mentioned as Nayinar Koil and the Kalugumalai inscription refers to Jain munis as Nayinar. It is akin to the term Sahu or Sadhu in North Indian Jain inscriptions.

==Religious head==
===Laxmisena===

Laxmisena of the Jina Kanchi Jain Mutt or madam at Mel-Sithamoor (near Tindivanam, Villupuram District) is one of the religious heads of the community. He performs the upadesha ceremony for Jain children. In the past, this mutt had been the centre for religious study, guiding and helping the economic activities of its members, organising religious discourses, maintenance of temples and such activities. The mutt was able to achieve such multifarious operations with the help and contributions of its members. At present the mutt is also maintaining a gousala (for cows and others).

The present finance position of the mutt is inadequate for even day-to-day maintenance. Planting of coconut and mango trees has been started to increase the revenue of the fund for the purpose of day-to-day maintenance of the mutt. The car (&#x27;ther&#x27;) in the mutt requires replacement of wooden wheels.

=== Dhavalakeerthi ===

In addition to the above, a new mutt named Arahanthgiri Jain Math located at Thirumalai near Polur, Tiruvannamalai district, has been functioning from 8 February 1998 with the name Dhavalakeerthi. Now in the mutt around 2300 students are studying from primary to higher secondary school including Jain philosophy with free boarding and lodging. Maintenance of the above is done through contributions from donors.

==Lifestyle==
The traditional occupation of the majority of the Tamil Jain families has been landowners of agricultural land. Now many are teachers. A considerable number of them are settled in urban areas, they are employed in public and private sectors. A small population has settled overseas (US, Canada, UK, Australia and other places).

=== Cuisine ===
Tamil Jains are ardent vegetarians. With the turn of the 20th century, they were a self-sustained rural-based farming community. They were landowners and used contract labourers for their agricultural activities. Their household included large tracts of land, cattle, and milch cows. They had kitchen gardens growing vegetables for their daily need. Dairy food such as milk, curd, butter and ghee were cooked in house. Daily food was very simple consisting of a brunch with rice, cooked lentils (paruppu), ghee, vegetable sambar, curd, sun-dried pickles of mango, lemon or citron, and deep-fried sun-dried &#x27;crispies&#x27; (vadavam) made from rice pie. Evening snacks of deep-fried lentil preparations and before sunset dinner consisting either idli, dosa or rice with buttermilk and lentil chutney (thogaiyal). While seniors, people undergoing religious fast and ardent followers of religious principles avoided garlic, onions and tubers in their daily food, these were occasionally used by others in the household.

===Identity===
Tamil Jains are well assimilated in Tamil society, without any outward differentiation. Their physical features are similar to Tamils. Apart from certain religious adherences, practices and vegetarianism, their culture is similar to the rest of Tamil Nadu. However, they name their children by the names of Tirthankaras and characters from Jain literature. It is also notable that the men of the Tamil Jain community also wear the sacred thread.

===Lifetime ceremony===
Ezhankaapu - on the seventh day of its birth, a new born baby is adorned with bracelets.
Kaathu Kutthal - ear piercing and adorning child with earrings. This ceremony is mostly performed in either Aarpakkam temple or Thirunarangkondai i.e.Thirunarungkundram. (Appandai Nathar is the deity).

===Other Ceremonies===

Upadesam - the formal induction into religious practices and adherences is called Upadesam. This is done to both boys and girls, at around the age of 15. After Upadesam, one is supposed to follow religious practices with vigor and seriousness.

Marriage - outwardly, Jain marriages resemble Hindu marriages. However, the mantras chanted are Jain. There is no Brahmin priest; instead there is a Samaṇar called a &quot;Koyil Vaadhiyar&quot; or temple priest, who conducts the ceremonies.

Pilgrimage - most Jains go on pilgrimage to tirthas and major Jain temples in North India - Sammed Shikharji, Pavapuri, Champapuri and Urjayanta Giri - as well as places in South India such as Shravanabelagola, Humcha or Hombuja Humbaj, Simmanagadde in Karnataka and Ponnur Malai in Tamil Nadu.

There are private amateur tour operators as well who take pilgrims to newly identified ancient Tamil Jain sites in western Tamil Nadu (kongunadu) and northern Kerala (vayanadu).

Funeral rites - the dead are placed on a pyre and incinerated. Ashes are then disbursed in water courses and ceremonies are performed on 10th or 16th day. Annual remembrance ceremonies similar to Hindu practice are not performed. But no festivities or functions are followed that year on the paternal side.

===Festivals===
*Akshaya Tritiya commemorates the first Tirthankara, Rishabha, partaking food after many long years of penance.
*Jinaratri commemorates Rishabha&#x27;s moksha.
*Mahavir Janma Kalyanak celebrates Tirthankara Mahavira&#x27;s birth.
*Diwali commemorates Mahavira&#x27;s moksha.
*Vasant Panchami honors the Jain Agamas

*Karthikai Deepam at the onset of the month of Kartika
*Puthandu and Thai Pongal are the other common festivals celebrated along with other Tamils.

===Religious practices===

Full moon days, Chaturdasi (14th day of the fortnight), Ashtami (8th day of the fortnight) are days chosen for fasting and religious observations. Women take food only after reciting the name of a tirthankara five times. People undertake such practices as a vow for certain period of time - sometimes even for years. On completion, Udhyapana festivals (special prayer services) are performed, religious books and memorabilia are distributed. People who take certain vows eat only after sunrise and before sunset.

<doc id="665048" wikidata="Q7534912" url="?curid=665048" title="Winter sports in Slovakia">
<text>Ski and winter sports in [[Slovakia]] are very prominent and popular given the mountainous topography of the region and the fact that much of the country is covered by snow for a long part of the year.

== Downhill Skiing ==
In spite of its small area, which is mostly hilly, Slovakia is densely interwoven by a net of ski-tows and ski-lifts. More than 1000 ski-tows and 40 ski-lifts are in operation and their number is growing. From the top the terminal stations there are hundreds of down-hill pistes, from the very gentle – for beginners, to the most demanding, which comply with the international criteria for master competitions.

At present, approximately 50 Slovak ski resorts make snow.

== Snowboarding ==
Snowboarding is the fastest developing winter sport in the world. Slovakia is no exception - the number of snowboarders has been increasing every year, partly due to the type of terrain available in ski resorts. Well equipped board parks at the larger resorts offer excellent jumps, ramps and rail-slides. This is especially true of Jasna which is the largest resort in Central Europe and very boarder friendly.

== Ski-Alpinism ==
Ski-alpinism is a combination of cross-country skiing, mountaineering and alpine skiing. Its fans seek new opportunities for testing own stamina and strength in the extreme conditions of winter alpine nature. The Slovak mountains provide very good conditions for pursuing this sport, and ski-alpinism fans recommend Jasenská dolina in the Veľká Fatra Mts., the area of Chopok and Ďumbier in the Low Tatras, Malá Studená dolina and Veľká Studená dolina and Skalnatá dolina in the High Tatras, Roháče and Žiarska dolina in the Western Tatras, and the well known Vrátna dolina in the Malá Fatra Mts.

== Cross-country skiing ==
Bigger ski resorts offer well kept cross-country paths, but skier made paths can be found virtually by any village or tourist centre. Slovakia is rather small, so there is not much of &quot;cross country&quot;.

== Ski jumping ==
Ski jumping is not a popular sport in Slovakia. However, some jumping hills exist.

<doc id="665067" wikidata="Q931825" url="?curid=665067" title="Carlton Club">
<text>The Carlton Club is a private members&#x27; club in the St James&#x27;s area of London, England. It was the original home of the Conservative Party before the creation of Conservative Central Office. Membership of the club is by nomination and election only.

==History==
The club was founded in 1832, by Tory peers, MPs and gentlemen, as a place to coordinate party activity after the party&#x27;s defeat over the First Reform Act. The 1st Duke of Wellington was a founding member; he opposed the 1832 Reform Act and its extension of the right to vote. The club played a major role in the transformation of the Tory party into its modern form as the Conservative Party. It lost its role as a central party office with the widening of the franchise after the Reform Act 1867, but it remained the principal venue for key political discussions between Conservative ministers, MPs and party managers.

===Formation location===
The club was formed at the Thatched House Tavern in 1832 and its first premises were in Carlton House Terrace (provided by Lord Kensington), from which it drew its name. These premises were quickly found too small. The second clubhouse was situated near the Reform Club at 94 Pall Mall, London, and was purpose-built in 1835. It was replaced by a third clubhouse on the same site in 1856.

The Caen stone used on the façade of the third building proved unsuitable in the London atmosphere and had to be completely replaced in 1923–24.

===1922 Carlton Club meeting===

The club is most famous for the Carlton Club meeting of 19 October 1922, in which backbench Conservative MPs decided to withdraw from the David Lloyd George–led coalition government. MPs voted in favour of discontinuing the coalition, after speeches from Bonar Law and Stanley Baldwin, with Baldwin saying that the fact Lloyd George was a &#x27;dynamic force&#x27; was a danger to the stability of the Conservative party. Austen Chamberlain resigned as leader and Bonar Law formed a purely Conservative government.

===Bombing by the Luftwaffe and move to current building===
The club suffered a direct hit during the Blitz on 14 October 1940. Observers, including the diarist Harold Nicolson, noted Quintin Hogg (then a young Conservative MP, later the 2nd Viscount Hailsham) carrying his elderly, disabled father (Lord Hailsham) from the building; they had been dining together prior to the former&#x27;s departure for active service in North Africa. The Chief Whip, David Margesson, who was living at the club since his recent divorce, was left homeless and had to sleep for a time on a makeshift bed in the underground Cabinet Annexe.

No one was killed in the explosion, but the building was destroyed. The Carlton immediately moved to its current premises at 69 St James&#x27;s Street, formerly the location of Arthur&#x27;s club – one of the premier gentlemen&#x27;s clubs, which had closed the same year after 150 years of operations.

The current Georgian clubhouse is architecturally important (Grade II* listed) and includes two elegant dining rooms, together with a collection of political portraits and paintings dating back to the 18th century, imported from the ruins of the old clubhouse and the former Junior Carlton Club (see below). The current clubhouse has not retained any of the furnishings belonging to the building when it was Arthur&#x27;s club, apart from the war memorial plaque in the entrance. There is a marble Arthur&#x27;s club First World War Memorial to be found on the wall by the stairs in the main vestibule of St James&#x27;s Church Piccadilly (designed by Wren). The walls of the Disraeli and Macmillan rooms and their windows at the back of the club were part of the fabric of the original White&#x27;s Club building.

===Junior Carlton Club===
The Junior Carlton Club, which was entirely separate from the Carlton itself, was established in 1864 and occupied a large purpose-built clubhouse, completed in 1869, at 30 Pall Mall, almost opposite the Carlton. This was sold early in the 1960s and part of the proceeds used to buy the site of the former Carlton Club building at 94 Pall Mall. The erection of the new clubhouse on the site of 30 Pall Mall in a modern 1960s prototype &#x27;club of the future&#x27; led to mass resignations from that club. In December 1977 it formally merged with the Carlton Club, with negotiations conducted by Harold Macmillan.

===Bombing by IRA===

At 8:39 p.m. on 25 June 1990, the Carlton Club was bombed by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), injuring more than 20 people. Lord Kaberry died the following year at age 83 from the injuries he had sustained.

===Chris Pincher scandal===

It was at the Carlton that Chris Pincher, the deputy chief whip, was alleged to have committed sexual assault on two men on 29 June 2022. The revelations following this scandal led to the government crisis and the resignation of the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson. The standards committee found Pincher&#x27;s conduct amounted to an abuse of power and recommended he be suspended for eight weeks. Pincher initially intended to appeal the suspension, however he ultimately resigned as an MP in September 2023, triggering a by-election in his Tamworth constituency which the Conservatives lost to Labour.

==Membership==
Historically and by tradition, only gentlemen could become full members after being proposed and seconded by two current members who have known the applicant and been members themselves for at least two years. From the 1970s onwards, there were female associate members, meaning they were unable to vote. On becoming Conservative leader in 1975, Margaret Thatcher was made an honorary member of the club and, as such, until 2008 was the only female member entitled to full membership. Thatcher was elected (in May 2009) to the vacancy, as the club&#x27;s second president, succeeding her only predecessor Harold Macmillan who had died in 1986.

A separate, unrelated Ladies&#x27; Carlton Club was established after the First World War as a social and political centre for Conservative women. It closed in 1958.

A full history of the club was published by historian Lord Lexden to mark its 175th anniversary in 2007.

 the club had around 1500 members and membership cost upwards of £1700 per year.

=== Opposition to membership ===

The Prime Minister Arthur Balfour was a reluctant member, complaining about the club in the early 1900s.
Then Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith refused Carlton Club membership when it was offered to him in 2001 because women, at that time, were unable to become full members.

<text>The siege of Acre of 1799 was an unsuccessful French siege of the Ottoman city of Acre (now Akko in modern Israel) and was the turning point of Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Egypt and Syria, along with the Battle of the Nile. It was Napoleon&#x27;s third tactical defeat in his career, being defeated at the Second Battle of Bassano and the Battle of Caldiero three years previously during the Italian campaign, and his first major strategic defeat, along with the last time he was defeated in battle for 10 years. As a result of the failed siege, Napoleon Bonaparte retreated two months later and withdrew to Egypt.

==Background==

Acre was a site of significant strategic importance due to its commanding position on the route between Egypt and Syria. Bonaparte wanted to capture it following his invasion of Egypt. He hoped to incite a Syrian rebellion against the Ottomans and threaten British India. After the siege of Jaffa, which was followed by two days and nights of massacre and rape by the French forces, the defenders of the citadel were even more determined to resist the French.

==Siege==
The French attempted to lay siege on 20 March using only their infantry. Napoleon believed the city would capitulate quickly to him. In correspondence with one of his subordinate officers he voiced his conviction that a mere two weeks would be necessary to capture the linchpin of his conquest of the Holy Land before marching on to Jerusalem.

However, the troops of the capable Jezzar Pasha, refusing to surrender, withstood the siege for one and a half months. Haim Farhi, al-Jazzar&#x27;s Jewish adviser and right-hand man, played a key role in the city&#x27;s defence, directly supervising the battle against the siege. After Napoleon&#x27;s earlier capture of Jaffa, rampaging French troops had savagely sacked the captured city, and thousands of Albanian prisoners of war were ordered by Napoleon to be massacred on the sea-shore, prior to the French offensive further northwards. These facts were well known to the townspeople and defending troops (many of them Albanians) in Acre, and the prospect of being massacred is likely to have stiffened their resistance.

A Royal Navy flotilla under Commodore Sidney Smith, commanding , helped to reinforce the Ottoman defences and supplied the city with additional cannon manned by sailors and marines. Smith used his command of the sea to capture the French siege artillery being sent by a flotilla of gunboats from Egypt and to bombard the coastal road from Jaffa. The captured boats were:

An artillery expert from the fleet, French &quot;émigré&quot; Antoine de Phélippeaux, then redeployed against Napoleon&#x27;s forces the artillery pieces which the British had intercepted.

Smith anchored the British ships and &quot;Theseus&quot; so their broadsides could assist the Ottoman defence. British gunboats, which were of shallower draft, could come in closer, and together they helped repel repeated French assaults.

On 16 April an Ottoman relief force was fought off at Mount Tabor. By early May, replacement French siege artillery had arrived overland and a breach was forced in the defences. At the culmination of the assault, the besieging forces managed to make a breach in the walls.
However, after suffering many casualties to open this entry-point, Napoleon&#x27;s soldiers found, on trying to penetrate the city, that Farhi and de Phélippeaux had, in the meantime, built a second wall, several feet deeper within the city where al-Jazzar&#x27;s garden was. Discovery of this new construction convinced Napoleon and his men that the probability of them taking the city was minimal. Moreover, after the assault was again repelled, Ottoman reinforcements from Rhodes were able to land.

Having underestimated the stubborn attitude of the defending forces combined with a British blockade of French supply harbours and harsh weather conditions, Napoleon&#x27;s forces were left hungry, cold and damp. Plague had struck the French camp as a result of the desperate condition of the men, and had by now led to the deaths of about 2,000 soldiers.

Throughout the siege, both Napoleon and Jezzar sought in vain the assistance of the Shihab leader, Bashir—ruler of much of present-day Lebanon. Bashir remained neutral. As things turned out, it was the French which suffered most from the attitude of Bashir, whose intervention on their side might have turned the balance of power in their favour.

Finally, the siege was raised. Napoleon Bonaparte retreated two months later on 21 May after a failed final assault on 10 May, and withdrew to Egypt.

==Significance==

In 1805, Napoleon asserted that if he had

The allusions from Classical Antiquity included in the speech are to the Sacred Band of Thebes and the Persian Immortals—elite units of, respectively, the city state of Thebes and the Achaemenid Kings of Persia; and to the Battle of Issus where Alexander the Great decisively defeated the latter. (In fact, though Acre was not conquered, Napoleon&#x27;s Imperial Guard did come to be informally called &quot;The Immortals&quot;.)

Whether or not Napoleon would have been able to carry out the above grand design, it is likely that had he taken Acre he might have remained a considerable further time in the East, would not have returned to France in 1799 and hence would not have carried out later that year the coup which established him in power as First Consul. He might have still taken power in France, later on and under different circumstances, or in his absence someone else might have overthrown the shaky rule of the Directorate. Either way, the later history of France and of Europe might have been substantially different. Also, whether or not Napoleon would have managed to make himself Emperor of the East and reach Constantinople, his energetically trying to do that would have certainly had a substantial effect on the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s history.

Some hold that a statement attributed to Napoleon during the war, according to which he promised to return the land to the Jews if he were to succeed in his conquest of Palestine, was meant to capture the attention of Farhi, a Syrian Jew, and betray his master by switching his support to the French. Whether this is true or not, Farhi defended the city with the rest of the Ottoman forces.

Napoleon showed great interest in winning over the Jews during the campaign, including the account of Las Cases in &quot;Mémorial de Sainte Hélène&quot; about Napoleon&#x27;s military campaign records that it was reported among Syrian Jews that after Napoleon took Acre, he would go to Jerusalem and restore Solomon&#x27;s temple and decrees were passed in favour of Jews (and Coptic Christians and women) in French-controlled Egypt.

==Legacy==
In present-day Acre, the hill on which Napoleon set his camp, south-east of the city walls of Acre, is still known as &quot;Napoleon&#x27;s Hill&quot; (גבעת נפוליון). Acre also has a Napoleon Bonaparte Street (רחוב נפוליון בונפרטה), the only city in Israel with such a street name.

Among the Arab population of the Old City of Acre, the knowledge of their forebears having successfully withstood the barrage of such a world-famous conqueror is a source of civic pride and local patriotism. In a folk tale circulated by Acre Arabs, Napoleon, upon lifting the siege of Acre, let a cannon shoot his hat into the city &quot;so that at least a part of him would enter into Acre&quot;.

<doc id="665082" wikidata="Q594566" url="?curid=665082" title="Studebaker Silver Hawk">
<text>The Studebaker Silver Hawk is an automobile produced in 1957, 1958 and 1959 by the Studebaker Corporation of South Bend, Indiana. Studebaker introduced the &quot;Hawk&quot; line in 1956, with four models based on the wheelbase and body of the &#x27;53 coupes and hardtops designed by Robert Bourke, as head of the design team Studebaker contracted from Raymond Loewy Associates. In 1956 the Golden Hawk, Sky Hawk and Power Hawk came with 352 cid, 289 cid and 259 cid v-8s respectively, while the Flight Hawk ran the Champion 185 cid engine. The Golden and Sky Hawks were hardtops; while the Power and Flight Hawks were pillared coupes. 
Only one of the four models in 1956 sported any fins, that being the Golden Hawk.

==1957–1958==

In 1957 the Silver Hawk was introduced as a pillared coupe, replacing both the Power Hawk and Flight Hawk. The 185 cid Champion engine was standard in the model, with the 259 Commander V-8 offered only in export models. The Sky Hawk was also dropped in 1957, resulting in only two Studebaker Hawk models offered that year, the Silver Hawk with Champion Six or standard 289 V-8 and the Golden Hawk with the supercharged President 289 V-8. A one-year-only model &#x27;58 Packard Hawk was also offered with the 289 supercharged engine.

In appearance, the Silver Hawk was plainer than the Golden Hawk. Besides being a coupe, while the Golden was always a hardtop, there was a bit less chrome, no supercharger or bulge in the hood, and a simpler two-tone paint scheme was adopted — simply one color below the chrome belt line and another above, but unlike the Golden Hawk, the lower color included the fin. Some dealers painted the fin only, and sometimes the deck lid recess and or the left and right &quot;side grills&quot; were painted in a contrasting Studebaker color. These usually matched the interior, some were Blue, Gold, Red, or Black and were better looking according to many owners than the factory two-tone paint scheme.

==1959==
For 1959, the Silver Hawk became the only Hawk model in production, largely because Studebaker dealers wanted a glamorous flagship model as a dealership draw. Those customers would more than likely walk out with Studebaker&#x27;s last-ditch hope, the new Lark compact. In fact, the Silver Hawk was the only non-Lark model kept. Studebakers were also exported and rebuilt as CKD&#x27;s (completely Knock Down) to Belgium. Prospects could order whatever model or options (with- or without fins) to suit their preference. Cars were built by D&#x27;Ieteren Frères of Belgium for European markets such as the Netherlands where Studebaker was quite popular.

Changes for 1959 included new tailfins, with the &quot;Silver Hawk&quot; script moved to the fins instead of on the trunk lid (where new individual block letters spelling out STUDEBAKER were placed), with a new Hawk badge in between the two words. The parking lights moved to the side grilles from the front fenders, chrome moldings around the windows (from the 1953–1954 models) similar to the Golden Hawk were added, and the interior was somewhere in between the two former models&#x27; levels of luxury. Two-tone paint was discontinued for all U.S. orders, though it was still available for export.

Under the hood (at least for U.S. models), buyers could choose the newly-shrunken (to pre-&#x27;55 size) 90 HP six or the V8 of 180 or 195 HP (depending on the choice of carburetor). The 289 was no longer available.

The 1959 model year was Studebaker&#x27;s first profitable year in six years, thanks mostly to the Lark, and the rising tide of sales lifted the Silver Hawk, which sold 7,788 examples.

While the Silver Hawk was the only model offered in 1959, it too was dropped for 1960, with all models called simply Hawks. Largely unchanged externally from the 1959, internally, the major change was the return of the V8 last used in 1958. This was the only engine available for U.S. orders in both 1960 and 1961, the last year of the finned Hawk. Some six-cylinder and V8 models were built for export markets.

The 1961 models saw the limited return of a second paint color, beige, in a stripe along the base of the fin between the two lower moldings. Interiors gained the option of wide, comfortable bucket seats; customers could opt to team their 289 V8 with a new four-speed Borg-Warner manual transmission, the same model used in the Chevrolet Corvette.

==1960-61==

When the 1960 model year began, U.S. automakers were in the throes of a steel strike, and the shortage of steel hit Studebaker, which was a much smaller company than AMC or the Big Three, particularly hard. The 289 V-8 returned as the standard engine in the Hawk.

Studebaker had a proven sales winner in the 1959 Lark, which was continued into 1960 with little change. With steel in short supply, the company chose to focus on building as many Larks as possible to ensure an adequate supply for the company&#x27;s dealers. This meant that Silver Hawk production for 1960, which had been scheduled to begin in November or December 1959, was delayed.

Sales of the Lark began to fall off in the closing months of 1959. By the beginning of February 1960, Hawks finally began to roll from the South Bend assembly line.

It isn&#x27;t known what might have happened had Lark sales continued at their 1959 levels, but speculation has been advanced that the company might not have produced any Hawks. The lengthy delay between new-model announcement time and the start of Hawk production in 1960 shows just how close Studebaker came to not producing a model that they had at least halfheartedly promoted in print advertising and showroom brochures.

The Hawk lived on, and later that year a stock production model won its class in the 1960 Mobil Economy Run, delivering 22.9 miles per gallon.

The Hawk was replaced for 1962 by the restyled (by Brooks Stevens) Studebaker Gran Turismo Hawk.

==Legacy==
The South Bend Silver Hawks, the former minor league baseball Single-A Arizona Diamondbacks affiliate took its name from this model. Originally the logo and lettering on the teams&#x27; uniforms mirrored the logo and lettering on the car, but this has since changed to a more cartoon-esque design. The team was renamed the South Bend Cubs, following the 2014 season.

A Studebaker Hawk was featured as the title character&#x27;s personal car in the 2012 Australian TV series &quot;Jack Irish&quot;.

A Studebaker Hawk was featured in the TV series &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;. Driven by the antagonist.

The model&#x27;s name is parodied (as the character Studebaker Hoch) in the Frank Zappa song &quot;Billy the Mountain&quot;.

In the Roxy Music song Virginia Plain there is also a reference to Studebaker in the lyric ‘Far beyond the pale horizon
Some place near the desert strand
Where my Studebaker takes me
That&#x27;s where I&#x27;ll make my stand’

<doc id="665091" wikidata="Q3760905" url="?curid=665091" title="Exponential hierarchy">
<text>In computational complexity theory, the exponential hierarchy is a hierarchy of complexity classes that is an exponential time analogue of the polynomial hierarchy. As elsewhere in complexity theory, “exponential” is used in two different meanings (linear exponential bounds formula_1 for a constant &quot;c&quot;, and full exponential bounds formula_2), leading to two versions of the exponential hierarchy. This hierarchy is sometimes also referred to as the &quot;weak&quot; exponential hierarchy, to differentiate it from the &quot;strong&quot; exponential hierarchy.

==EH==
The complexity class EH is the union of the classes formula_3 for all &quot;k&quot;, where formula_4 (i.e., languages computable in nondeterministic time formula_1 for some constant &quot;c&quot; with a formula_6 oracle) and formula_7. One also defines 

:formula_8 and formula_9

An equivalent definition is that a language &quot;L&quot; is in formula_3 if and only if it can be written in the form

:formula_11

where formula_12 is a predicate computable in time formula_13 (which implicitly bounds the length of &quot;yi&quot;). Also equivalently, EH is the class of languages computable on an alternating Turing machine in time formula_1 for some &quot;c&quot; with constantly many alternations.

==EXPH==
EXPH is the union of the classes formula_15, where formula_16 (languages computable in nondeterministic time formula_2 for some constant &quot;c&quot; with a formula_6 oracle), formula_19, and again:

:formula_20 

A language &quot;L&quot; is in formula_15 if and only if it can be written as

:formula_22

where formula_23 is computable in time formula_24 for some &quot;c&quot;, which again implicitly bounds the length of &quot;yi&quot;. Equivalently, EXPH is the class of languages computable in time formula_2 on an alternating Turing machine with constantly many alternations.

==Comparison==

<doc id="665095" wikidata="Q164765" url="?curid=665095" title="Alexander Blok">
<text>Alexander Alexandrovich Blok (; 7 August 1921) was a Russian lyrical poet, writer, publicist, playwright, translator and literary critic.

==Early life ==
Blok was born in Saint Petersburg, into an intellectual family of Alexander Lvovich Blok and Alexandra Andreevna Beketova. His father was a law professor in Warsaw, and his maternal grandfather, Andrey Beketov, was a famous botanist and the rector of Saint Petersburg State University. After his parents&#x27; separation, Blok lived with aristocratic relatives at the manor Shakhmatovo near Moscow, where he discovered the philosophy of Vladimir Solovyov, and the verse of then-obscure 19th-century poets, Fyodor Tyutchev and Afanasy Fet. These influences would affect his early publications, later collected in the book &quot;Ante Lucem&quot;.

==Career and marriage==
In 1903 he married the actress Lyubov (Lyuba) Dmitrievna Mendeleeva, daughter of the renowned chemist Dmitri Mendeleev. Later, she would involve him in a complicated love-hate relationship with his fellow Symbolist Andrei Bely. To Lyuba he dedicated a cycle of poetry that made him famous, &quot;Stikhi o Prekrasnoi Dame&quot; (&quot;Verses About the Beautiful Lady&quot;, 1904).


Blok enthusiastically greeted the 1905 Russian Revolution. During the last period of his life, Blok emphasised political themes, pondering the messianic destiny of his country (&quot;Vozmezdie,&quot; 1910–21; &quot;Rodina,&quot; 1907–16; &quot;Skify,&quot; 1918). In 1906 he wrote an encomium to Mikhail Bakunin. Influenced by Solovyov&#x27;s doctrines, he had vague apocalyptic apprehensions and often vacillated between hope and despair. &quot;I feel that a great event was coming, but what it was exactly was not revealed to me&quot;, he wrote in his diary during the summer of 1917. Quite unexpectedly for most of his admirers, he accepted the October Revolution as the final resolution of these apocalyptic yearnings.

In May 1917 Blok was appointed as a stenographer for the Extraordinary Commission to investigate illegal actions ex officio Ministers or to transcribe the (Thirteenth Section&#x27;s) interrogations of those who knew Grigori Rasputin. According to Orlando Figes he was only present at the interrogation.

In November 1917, a few days after the October Revolution, the People&#x27;s Commissar for Enlightenment, Anatoly Lunacharsky invited 120 of the leading writers and other cultural figures to a meeting, which almost all boycotted. Blok was one of five to attend, along with Vladimir Mayakovsky, Vsevolod Meyerhold and two others. When the Socialist Academy of Social Sciences was established in 1918, Blok became a participant.

His poem, &quot;The Twelve&quot;, written in 1918, describes 12 Red Guards in the violent chaos of the Russian Civil War, who are likened to the Apostles, while &quot;Ahead of them, Jesus Christ goes.&quot;

Because this early show of support, Blok continued to be honoured by the Bolsheviks, despite his pre-revolutionary religious imagery, and his later disillusionment. In 1923, Leon Trotsky devoted a whole chapter of his book &quot;Literature and Revolution&quot; to Blok, saying that &quot;Blok belonged to pre-October literature, but he overcame this, and entered into the sphere of October when he wrote &quot;The Twelve&quot;. That is why he will occupy a special place in the history of Russian literature.&quot; Given the official report on poetry to the First Congress of Soviet Writers , Nikolai Bukharin praised Blok as &quot;a poet of tremendous power (whose) verse achieves a chiselled monumentality...&quot; but added that &quot;he thought that with the sign of the Cross he could bless and at the same time exorcise the image of the unfolding revolution, and he perished without having spoke his final word.&quot;

==Decline in health==

By 1921 Blok had become disillusioned with the Russian Revolution. He had not written any poetry for three years. He complained to Maksim Gorky that his &quot;faith in the wisdom of humanity&quot; had ended, and explained to his friend Korney Chukovsky why he could not write poetry any more: &quot;All sounds have stopped. Can&#x27;t you hear that there are no longer any sounds?&quot; Within a few days Blok became sick with asthma; he had earlier developed scurvy as well. His doctors requested that he be sent abroad for medical treatment, but he was not allowed to leave the country.

Gorky pleaded for a visa on Blok&#x27;s behalf. On 29 May 1921, he wrote to Anatoly Lunacharsky: &quot;Blok is Russia&#x27;s finest poet. If you forbid him to go abroad, and he dies, you and your comrades will be guilty of his death.&quot; A resolution on departure for Blok was signed by members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee on 23 July 1921. But on 29 July Gorky asked permission for Blok&#x27;s wife to accompany him, since Blok&#x27;s health had deteriorated sharply. Permission for Liubov&#x27; Dmitrievna Blok to leave Russia was signed by Molotov on 1 August 1921, but Gorky did not receive notification until 6 August. The permission was delivered on 10 August, but Blok had already died on 7 August.

Several months earlier, Blok had delivered a celebrated lecture on Alexander Pushkin, the memory of whom he believed to be capable of uniting White and Soviet Russian factions.

==Work==

The idealized mystical images presented in his first book helped establish Blok as a major poet of the Russian Symbolism style. Blok&#x27;s early verse is musical, but he later sought to introduce daring rhythmic patterns and uneven beats into his poetry. Poetical inspiration was natural for him, often producing unforgettable, otherworldly images out of the most banal surroundings and trivial events (&quot;Fabrika&quot;, 1903). Consequently, his mature poems are often based on the conflict between the Platonic theory of ideal beauty and the disappointing reality of foul industrialism (&quot;The Puppet Show&quot;, 1906).

The description of St Petersburg he crafted for his next collection of poems, &quot;The City&quot; (1904–08), was both impressionistic and eerie. Subsequent collections, &quot;Faina&quot; and the &quot;Mask of Snow&quot;, helped augment Blok&#x27;s reputation. He was often compared with Alexander Pushkin, and is considered perhaps the most important poet of the Silver Age of Russian Poetry. During the 1910s, Blok was admired greatly by literary colleagues, and his influence on younger poets was virtually unsurpassed. Anna Akhmatova, Marina Tsvetaeva, Boris Pasternak, and Vladimir Nabokov wrote important verse tributes to Blok.

Blok expressed his opinions about the revolution by the enigmatic poem &quot;The Twelve” (1918). The long poem exhibits &quot;mood-creating sounds, polyphonic rhythms, and harsh, slangy language&quot; (as the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; termed it). It describes the march of twelve Bolshevik soldiers (likened to the Twelve Apostles of Christ) through the streets of revolutionary Petrograd, with a fierce winter blizzard raging around them. &quot;The Twelve&quot; alienated Blok from many of his intellectual readers (who accused him of lack of artistry), while the Bolsheviks scorned his former mysticism and asceticism.

Searching for modern language and new images, Blok used unusual sources for the poetry of Symbolism: urban folklore, ballads (songs of a sentimental nature) and ditties (&quot;chastushka&quot;). He was inspired by the popular chansonnier Mikhail Savoyarov, whose concerts during the years 1915–1920 were visited often by Blok. Academician Viktor Shklovsky noted that the poem is written in criminal language and in ironic style, similar to Savoyarov&#x27;s couplets, by which Blok imitated the slang of 1918 Petrograd.

<doc id="665096" wikidata="Q5323278" url="?curid=665096" title="Elementary recursive function">
<text>In recursion theory, an elementary recursive function, also called an elementary function, or a Kalmár elementary function, is a restricted form of a primitive recursive function, allowing bounded applications of exponentiation (for example, formula_1).

The name was coined by László Kalmár, in the context of recursive functions and undecidability; most elementary recursive functions are far from elementary. Not all primitive recursive problems are elementary; for example, tetration is not elementary. The corresponding class of decision problems is denoted formula_2.

==Definition==

The definitions of elementary recursive functions are the same as for primitive recursive functions, except that primitive recursion is replaced by bounded summation and bounded product. All functions work over the natural numbers. The basic functions, all of them elementary recursive, are:

# Zero function. Returns zero: &quot;f&quot;(x) = 0.
# Successor function: &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot; + 1. Often this is denoted by &quot;S&quot;, as in &quot;S&quot;(&quot;x&quot;). Via repeated application of a successor function, one can achieve addition.
# Projection functions: these are used for ignoring arguments. For example, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) = &quot;a&quot; is a projection function.
# Subtraction function: &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) = &quot;x&quot; − &quot;y&quot; if &quot;y&quot; &lt; &quot;x&quot;, or 0 if &quot;y&quot; ≥ &quot;x&quot;. This function is used to define conditionals and iteration.

From these basic functions, we can build other elementary recursive functions.

# Composition: applying values from some elementary recursive function as an argument to another elementary recursive function. In &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;n) = &quot;h&quot;(&quot;g&quot;1(&quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;n), ..., &quot;g&quot;m(&quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;n)) is elementary recursive if &quot;h&quot; is elementary recursive and each &quot;g&quot;i is elementary recursive.
# Bounded summation: formula_3 is elementary recursive if &quot;g&quot; is elementary recursive.
# Bounded product: formula_4 is elementary recursive if &quot;g&quot; is elementary recursive.

== Basis for ELEMENTARY ==

The class of elementary functions coincides with the closure with respect to composition of the projections and one of the following function sets: formula_5, formula_6, formula_7, where formula_8 is the subtraction function defined above.

== Lower elementary recursive functions ==

&quot;Lower elementary recursive&quot; functions follow the definitions as above, except that bounded product is disallowed. That is, a lower elementary recursive function must be a zero, successor, or projection function, a composition of other lower elementary recursive functions, or the bounded sum of another lower elementary recursive function.

Lower elementary recursive functions are also known as Skolem elementary functions.

Whereas elementary recursive functions have potentially more than exponential growth, the lower elementary recursive functions have polynomial growth.

The class of lower elementary functions has a description in terms of composition of simple functions analogous to that we have for elementary functions. Namely, a polynomial-bounded function is lower elementary if and only if it can be expressed using a composition of the following functions: projections, formula_9, formula_10, formula_11, formula_12, formula_13, one exponential function (formula_14 or formula_15) with the following restriction on the structure of formulas: the formula can have no more than two floors with respect to an exponent (for example, formula_16 has 1 floor, formula_17 has 2 floors, formula_18 has 3 floors). Here formula_12 is a bitwise AND of and .

== Descriptive characterization ==

In descriptive complexity, ELEMENTARY is equal to the class HO of languages that can be described by a formula of higher-order logic. This means that every language in the ELEMENTARY complexity class corresponds to as a higher-order formula that is true for, and only for, the elements on the language. More precisely, formula_20, where ⋯ indicates a tower of exponentiations and formula_21 is the class of queries that begin with existential quantifiers of th order and then a formula of th order.

<text>The Unitarian Universalist Religious Society of Spain (&quot;Sociedad religiosa Unitaria Universalista de España&quot;, SUUE) was an attempt to organize Unitarian Universalism in Spain.

Although the SUUE became a member of the International Council of Unitarians and Universalists (ICUU) in June 2001 and had fellowships, first in Barcelona (founded in 2000), and then also in Madrid (founded in 2003), it did not achieve recognition as a religious organization from the Spanish government.

In 2001, Ángel Acebes, the Spanish Ministry of Justice denied the registration of SUUE as a religious organization in Spain on the grounds that it lacked a creed. This rejection was confirmed in 2006 by Spanish Ministry of Justice Fernando López Aguilar after a second request for legalization was made that emphasized the religious nature of the organization and its historical and denominational links.

Nowadays Spanish Unitarian Universalists (gathered still in 2 congregations, Madrid and Barcelona, after an unsuccessful attempt to create a third fellowship in A Coruña (2008)) are looking for alternate ways of legalization that preclude the existence of SUUE as it had been originally conceived by its promoters.

<text>Icelander is the debut novel of Dustin Long. It is part of the Rectangulars line of McSweeney&#x27;s Books. It appeared on the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; best-seller&#x27;s list.

==Plot==
The plot primarily follows the adventures of a character known only as Our Heroine as she attempts to solve the mystery of her friend&#x27;s murder while repeated flashbacks detail her family&#x27;s past adventures in the underground Icelandic kingdom of Vanaheim.

==Style==
Though playing on the mystery genre, the book is more in line with the postmodern fiction of Vladimir Nabokov, Thomas Pynchon, Alasdair Gray, and Flann O&#x27;Brien.

The author created a real life &quot;Bean Day&quot; website, in reference to the event in the novel.

<text>Richard Brandon (died 20 June 1649) was the common executioner of London from 1639 to 1649, who inherited that role from his father Gregory Brandon and was sometimes known as Young Gregory. Richard Brandon is often named as the executioner of Charles I, though the executioner&#x27;s identity is not definitively known.

==Biography==
Brandon was born in London, at an unknown date, son to the common executioner of London, Gregory Brandon, and his wife Alice. Gregory Brandon had become executioner in 1611, and was then living with his family on Rosemary Lane, Whitechapel (now known as Royal Mint Street). Though little can be ascertained of Brandon&#x27;s early years, rumours abounded of his gruesome upbringing as the son of London&#x27;s executioner. He was rumoured to have decapitated stray cats and dogs, in training for his future position. Brandon&#x27;s father, Gregory, found himself on the wrong side of the law in January 1611, when he was convicted of the manslaughter of one Simon Morton, though he was not punished thanks to a pleading of the benefit of clergy. In 1617 Gregory was the butt of a practical joke played by the members of the London College of Arms, wherein he was granted &quot;the royal arms of Arragon, with a canton of Brabant&quot; and thereby made into a gentleman. This joke was taken up by the people of London, who elevated Gregory to esquire, a satirical title that passed down to his successors as London&#x27;s hangman. This resulted in the imprisonment of the members responsible, including the Garter Principal King of Arms, William Segar.

In his father&#x27;s later years as an executioner, Brandon worked alongside him and succeeded him around 1639, ostensibly obtaining the position through inheritance. In 1641 he was imprisoned at Newgate Prison for bigamy, though he was cleared of this charge on two occasions. At this time he was living at the same address, Rosemary Lane, with his wife Mary (whether she was the allegedly bigamous wife of Brandon&#x27;s or not is not recorded). As the common hangman of London, Brandon was responsible for several notable executions through the English Civil War, including Charles&#x27; advisor Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, on 12 May 1641 and Archbishop of Canterbury William Laud on 10 January 1645.

Brandon was the Common Hangman of London in 1649 and he is frequently cited as the executioner of Charles I. The royalist losses of the English Civil War had led to Charles I&#x27;s capture. Upon his trial, the High Court of Justice sentenced him to death for his tyrannical rule as King of England. The execution of Charles I occurred on 30 January 1649 outside the Banqueting House in Whitehall; the executioner and his assistant were hidden behind false wigs and beards, with crude masks covering their faces. Because of this, contemporary sources disagreed with each other and misidentified the executioner (one French source reported that Thomas Fairfax and Oliver Cromwell had personally executed Charles) and the precise identity of the executioner remains unknown. The execution of Charles I was carried out expertly, with a single clean cut to Charles&#x27; neck, possibly suggesting that the executioner was experienced, and pointing towards someone like Brandon who had much pride in his use of an axe. He is also reported to have received £30 around the time of the execution. He had also executed other royalists before Charles and after, including Thomas Wentworth, William Laud, and Lord Capel, indicating few moral qualms over executing political criminals. Despite this, a contemporary letter reports that he refused £200 to kill the king, and he continually denied having committed the act, even until his death in June 1649.

Richard Brandon, not to be discouraged by the death of a king, continued his job as the executioner of London. On 9 March he executed the Earl of Holland, Lord Capel, and the Duke of Hamilton, for the parliamentarians. Richard Brandon died on Wednesday 20 June 1649, and was buried the following day in the parish church of Whitechapel, St Mary Matfelon. The parish register of St Mary Matfelon records his burial: &quot;1649. Buriall. June 21st. Rich. Brandon, a man out of Rosemary Lane.&quot; Following this is added a short notice that &quot;this R. Brandon is supposed to have cut off the head of Charles I&quot;. This postscript was added in a different handwriting to the rest of the report and cannot be considered a reliable report of Brandon&#x27;s guilt.

Three pamphlets of 1649, published shortly after Brandon&#x27;s death, claimed to reveal him as the executioner of Charles I, though their authenticity is disputable. These were: &quot;The Last Will and Testament of Richard Brandon, Esquire, headsman and hangman to the Pretended Parliament&quot;; &quot;The Confession of Richard Brandon, the Hangman,&quot; 1649; and &quot;A Dialogue, or a Dispute between the Late Hangman and Death&quot;. The most notable of these tracts, &quot;The Confession of Richard Brandon&quot;, claimed to be a deathbed confession of Richard Brandon, but it is now regarded as a forgery, and apparently received little attention in its time. This tract claimed that Brandon had been paid £30 for his actions and returned home from the execution under cover of night, at 6 o&#x27;clock.

Among academic historians of the event, Philip Sidney and Basil Morgan both consider that Brandon was most likely the executioner of Charles I. Morgan claims that the &quot;weighted probability suggests that Richard Brandon was indeed the King&#x27;s executioner&quot;, considering the other attributions to be products of later &quot;Royalist rumour-mongers&quot;; similarly, Sidney, when weighing up the supporting and dissenting evidence considers &quot;the mass of evidence in support of Brandon&#x27;s identity with the headsman remains undeniably strong and suggestive&quot;, especially in comparison the mere rumours surrounding other suspects, such as William Hewlett and George Joyce. Contrastingly, other writers have been less ready to put forth the true culprit. Graham Edwards, in considering the evidence, claims that &quot;several writers have their favourite nominations, all cogently argued, equally convincing and open to counter-argument&quot;, leaving the mystery open to the reader.

Gregory Brandon was said to be the illegitimate grandson or great grandson of Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, whose
 However, an ancestry of Richard Brandon from the Duke of Suffolk&#x27;s illegitimate son Charles is highly unlikely. Charles Brandon died in 1551, eight years before Elizabeth I&#x27;s accession to the throne, and therefore cannot be identical with the Charles Brandon who was this Queen&#x27;s jeweller.

==Notoriety==
The notoriety of Gregory and the &quot;Young Gregory&quot; led to &quot;the Gregory Tree&quot; becoming a euphemism for the gallows, and was one of the reasons for the decline in popularity of the name Gregory. The name &quot;Gregory&quot; became a general nickname for executioners:

The two also appeared in satire and works of fiction at the time, like the print &quot;Portrait of Archbishop Laud and Mr. Henry Burton&quot;.

<doc id="665108" wikidata="Q536500" url="?curid=665108" title="Joseph Larmor">
<text>Sir Joseph Larmor (; 11 July 1857 – 19 May 1942) was an Irish mathematician and physicist who made breakthroughs in the understanding of electricity, dynamics, thermodynamics, and the electron theory of matter. His most influential work was &quot;Aether and Matter&quot;, a theoretical physics book published in 1900.

==Biography==
He was born in Magheragall in County Antrim, the son of Hugh Larmor, a Belfast shopkeeper and his wife, Anna Wright. The family moved to Belfast circa 1860, and he was educated at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution, and then studied mathematics and experimental science at Queen&#x27;s College, Belfast (BA 1874, MA 1875), where one of his teachers was John Purser. He subsequently studied at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where in 1880 he was Senior Wrangler (J. J. Thomson was second wrangler that year) and Smith&#x27;s Prizeman, getting his MA in 1883. After teaching physics for a few years at Queen&#x27;s College, Galway, he accepted a lectureship in mathematics at Cambridge in 1885. In 1892 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London, and he served as one of the Secretaries of the society. He was made an honorary fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1910.

In 1903 he was appointed Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge, a post he retained until his retirement in 1932. He never married. He was knighted by King Edward VII in 1909.

Motivated by his strong opposition to Home Rule for Ireland, in February 1911 Larmor ran for and was elected as Member of Parliament for Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency) with the Conservative party. He remained in parliament until the 1922 general election, at which point the Irish question had been settled. Upon his retirement from Cambridge in 1932, Larmor moved back to County Down in Northern Ireland.

He received an honorary Doctor of Laws (LLD) from the University of Glasgow in June 1901. He received an honorary Doctor in Science from Trinity College Dublin in 1903. He was elected an International Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1903, an International Member of the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1908, and an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1913. He was awarded the Poncelet Prize for 1918 by the French Academy of Sciences. Larmor was a Plenary Speaker in 1920 at the ICM at Strasbourg and an Invited Speaker at the ICM in 1924 in Toronto and at the ICM in 1928 in Bologna.

He died in Holywood, County Down on 19 May 1942.

==Work==
Larmor proposed that the aether could be represented as a homogeneous fluid medium which was perfectly incompressible and elastic. Larmor believed the aether was separate from matter. He united Lord Kelvin&#x27;s model of spinning gyrostats (see Vortex theory of the atom) with this theory. Larmor held that matter consisted of particles moving in the aether. Larmor believed the source of electric charge was a &quot;particle&quot; (which as early as 1894 he was referring to as the electron). Larmor held that the flow of charged particles constitutes the current of conduction (but was not part of the atom). Larmor calculated the rate of energy radiation from an accelerating electron. Larmor explained the splitting of the spectral lines in a magnetic field by the oscillation of electrons.Larmor also created the first solar system model of the atom in 1897. He also postulated the proton, calling it a &quot;positive electron&quot;. He said the destruction of this type of atom making up matter &quot;is an occurrence of infinitely small probability&quot;.

In 1919, Larmor proposed sunspots are self-regenerative dynamo action on the Sun&#x27;s surface.

Quotes from one of Larmor&#x27;s voluminous work include:
* &quot;while atoms of matter are in whole or in part aggregations of electrons in stable orbital motion. In particular, this scheme provides a consistent foundation for the electrodynamic laws, and agrees with the actual relations between radiation and moving matter&quot;.
* &quot;A formula for optical dispersion was obtained in § 11 of the second part of this memoir, on the simple hypothesis that the electric polarization of the molecules vibrated as a whole in unison with the electric field of the radiation&quot;.
* “…that of the transmission of radiation across a medium permeated by molecules, each consisting of a system of electrons in steady orbital motion, and each capable of free oscillations about the steady state of motion with definite free periods analogous to those of the planetary inequalities of the Solar System;”
* “&#x27;A&#x27; will be a positive electron in the medium, and &#x27;B&#x27; will be the complementary negative one...We shall thus have created two permanent conjugate electrons A and B; each of them can be moved about through the medium, but they will both persist until they are destroyed by an extraneous process the reverse of that by which they are formed&quot;.

==Discovery of Lorentz transformation==
Parallel to the development of Lorentz ether theory, Larmor published an approximation to the Lorentz transformations in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot; in 1897,
namely formula_1 for the spatial part and formula_2 for the temporal part, where formula_3 and the local time formula_4. He obtained the full Lorentz transformation in 1900 by inserting formula_5 into his expression of local time such that formula_6, and as before formula_7 and formula_8. This was done around the same time as Hendrik Lorentz (1899, 1904) and five years before Albert Einstein (1905).

Larmor however did not possess the correct velocity transformations, which include the addition of velocities law, which were later discovered by Henri Poincaré. Larmor predicted the phenomenon of time dilation, at least for orbiting electrons, by writing (Larmor 1897): &quot;... individual electrons describe corresponding parts of their orbits in times shorter for the [rest] system in the ratio (1 – &quot;v&quot;2/&quot;c&quot;2)1/2&quot;. He also verified that the FitzGerald–Lorentz contraction (length contraction) should occur for bodies whose atoms were held together by electromagnetic forces. In his book &quot;Aether and Matter&quot; (1900), he again presented the Lorentz transformations, time dilation and length contraction (treating these as dynamic rather than kinematic effects). Larmor was opposed to the spacetime interpretation of the Lorentz transformation in special relativity because he continued to believe in an absolute aether. He was also critical of the curvature of space of general relativity, to the extent that he claimed that an absolute time was essential to astronomy (Larmor 1924, 1927).

<doc id="665111" wikidata="Q323034" url="?curid=665111" title="Garderobe">
<text>Garderobe is a historic term for a room in a medieval castle. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; gives as its first meaning a store-room for valuables, but also acknowledges &quot;by extension, a private room, a bed-chamber; also a privy&quot;.

The word derives from the French , meaning &quot;robes (or clothing) protector&quot;. Its most common use now is as a term for a castle toilet.

==Store room==
 is the French word for &quot;wardrobe&quot;, a lockable place where clothes and other items are stored. According to medieval architecture scholar Frank Bottomley, garderobes were &quot;Properly, not a latrine or privy but a small room or large cupboard, usually adjoining the chamber [bedroom] or solar [living room] and providing safe-keeping for valuable clothes and other possessions of price: cloth, jewels, spices, plate and money.&quot;

==Toilet==

The term &quot;garderobe&quot; is also used to refer to a medieval or Renaissance toilet or a close stool. In a medieval castle, a garderobe was usually a simple hole discharging to the outside into a cesspit (akin to a pit latrine) or the moat (like a fish pond toilet), depending on the structure of the building. Such toilets were often placed inside a small chamber, leading by association to the use of the term garderobe to describe the rooms. Many can still be seen in Norman and medieval castles and fortifications, for example at Bürresheim Castle in Germany, where three garderobes are still visible. They became obsolete with the introduction of indoor plumbing.

A description of the garderobe at Donegal Castle indicates that while it was in use, it was believed that ammonia—a byproduct of excretion—would protect visitors&#x27; coats and cloaks from moths or fleas.

==Other languages==
In European public places, a garderobe denotes a cloakroom, wardrobe, alcove, or armoire used to temporarily store the coats and other possessions of visitors. In Danish, Dutch, Estonian, German, Norwegian, Polish, Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Ukrainian, the word can mean a cloakroom. In Latvian, it means &quot;checkroom&quot;.

<doc id="665117" wikidata="Q1280875" url="?curid=665117" title="Gróa">
<text>In Norse mythology, Gróa (possibly from Old Norse &quot;growing&quot;) is a völva (seeress) and practitioner of &quot;seiðr&quot;. She is the wife of Aurvandil the Bold. Groa was also the goddess of knowledge. 

==Attestations==
===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===

Gróa appears in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, in the context of Thor&#x27;s battle with the jötunn Hrungnir. After Thor has dispatched Hrungnir with the hammer Mjollnir, Gróa is asked to help magically remove shards of Hrungnir&#x27;s whetstone which became embedded in Thor&#x27;s head. Unfortunately while Gróa was about her work, Thor distracted her by telling her of how he had earlier helped Aurvandil cross the river Élivágar, and had saved her husband&#x27;s life by snapping off his frost-bitten toe. Gróa&#x27;s spell miscarried and the pieces of whetstone remained permanently embedded in Thor&#x27;s head.

===&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;===

Gróa is also a völva (or seeress), summoned from beyond the grave, in the Old Norse poem &quot;Grógaldr&quot;, (a section of &quot;Svipdagsmál&quot;), by her son Svipdagr. In death she has lost none of her prophetic powers, and is able to assist him in a successful conclusion of the task which he has been set by his cruel stepmother. It is possible that this second Gróa is the same as the first one, but the poem is a late 17th-century imitation of the Edda.

===&quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;===
In &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;, Gro is a woman saved from marrying a giant by King Gram. She is the daughter of Sigtrygg, King of Sweden, and the mother of Guthorm (and possibly Guthorm&#x27;s sister) by Gram.

In Viktor Rydberg&#x27;s elaborate theories on Norse mythology, this Gro is identified with the seeress described in other sources.

<text>VNET is an international computer networking system deployed in the mid-1970s and still in current, though greatly diminished, use. It was developed inside IBM and provided the main email and file-transfer backbone for the company throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Through it, a number of protocols were developed to deliver email amongst time sharing computers over alternative transmission systems.

VNET was first deployed as a private host to host network among CP/67 and VM/370 mainframes beginning before 1975. It was based on RSCS, a virtual machine–based communications program and an inter machine protocol developed in IBM&#x27;s Advanced Systems Development Division&#x27;s Remote Service System (RSS) prototype which produced some of the technology in the IBM Tivoli product. At that time, RSCS used the Binary Synchronous Communications (BSC) protocol, not Systems Network Architecture (SNA), to support file to file transfer among virtual machine users. The first several nodes included Scientific Centers and Poughkeepsie, New York lab sites.

RSCS-compatible communications code was subsequently developed for MVT/HASP, MVT/ASP and MVS mainframe operating systems. By September 1979, the network had grown to include 285 mainframe nodes in Europe, Asia, and North America. Unlike the Internet, VNET switched files among mainframes using a store and forward technique. Many of the early connections operated over dial-up phone lines at speeds of 1200 to 2400 bits per second. The addition of a 19.2 kbit/s trans-Atlantic satellite circuit in late 1977 was considered a major step forward.

End users typically sent files between 100 and 100,000 bytes in length. The user could expect delivery within one minute to several hours. File delivery was acknowledged on a hop by hop basis but there was no end to end delivery confirmation. However, by the late 1970s an email application was developed that provided delivery confirmation as well as message archiving. What began as a research activity among engineers and scientists became, by 1980, a valuable business asset for many organizations within IBM.

The first widely disruptive computer worm, &quot;Christmas Tree EXEC&quot; in December 1987, originated on BITNET and spread to this network.

<doc id="665121" wikidata="Q203479" url="?curid=665121" title="Pavlov's House">
<text>Pavlov&#x27;s House ( tr. &quot;Dom Pavlova&quot;) was an apartment building converted into a fortified position, which Red Army defenders held for around 60 days against the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; offensive during the Battle of Stalingrad. The siege lasted from 27 September to 25 November 1942 and eventually the Red Army managed to relieve it from the siege.

It gained its popular name from Sergeant Yakov Pavlov, who commanded the platoon that seized the building and defended it during the long battle.

The importance of the building has been contested. The fame of the building might be because it was not at the center of the October fighting, which had shifted to the north of Stalingrad. This allowed journalists to visit Pavlov&#x27;s house more easily than buildings nearer the main German assaults. The first article about &quot;Pavlov&#x27;s House&quot; appeared on 31 October 1942. 

== Siege ==
The house was a four-story building in the center of Stalingrad, built perpendicular to the embankment of the river Volga and overseeing the &quot;9th January Square&quot;, a large square named for Bloody Sunday. In late September 1942, between 30 and 50 soldiers of the 42nd Guards Regiment, 13th Guards Rifle Division secured the large apartment blocks from German control, following its recapture by four soldiers four days beforehand, which Yakov Pavlov led.

The position was quickly fortified under the command of Lieutenant Ivan F. Afanasiev, who ordered the men to lay landmines in all approaches to the square, barbed wire around the perimeter of the apartment block, and to position multiple machine guns in the windows as well as a PTRS anti tank rifle. The Soviets also had large amounts of artillery support from the opposite side of the Volga. Supply and communication trenches were created leading from the rear of Pavlov&#x27;s House to the river bank of the Volga, which received supply from supply vessels which were often shelled by German artillery when crossing the river.

The strategic benefit of the house was that it defended a key section of the Volga bank. The tactical benefit of the house was its position on a cross-street, giving the defenders a line of sight to the north, south and west. After several days, reinforcements and resupply arrived for Pavlov&#x27;s men, bringing the unit up to a 25-man understrength platoon and equipping the defenders with machine guns, anti-tank rifles, and mortars.
In keeping with Stalin&#x27;s Order No. 227—&quot;not one step back&quot;—Sergeant Pavlov was ordered to fortify the building and defend it to the last bullet and the last man. Taking this advice to heart, Pavlov ordered the building to be surrounded with four layers of barbed wire and landmines, and set up machine-gun posts in every available window facing the square. In the early stages of the defense, Pavlov discovered that an anti-tank rifle—a PTRS-41—he had mounted on the roof was particularly effective when used to ambush unsuspecting German tanks. Once the tanks had approached to within range of the weapon, their thin turret-roof armor was exposed to AT rifle fire from above, and they were unable to elevate their weapons enough to retaliate.

For better internal communication, Pavlov&#x27;s soldiers breached the walls in the basement and upper floors, and dug a communications trench to Soviet positions outside. Supplies were brought in via the trench or by boats crossing the river, defying German air raids and shelling. Nevertheless, food and especially water was in short supply. Lacking beds, the soldiers tried to sleep on insulation wool torn off pipes but were subjected to harassing fire every night in order to try to break their resistance.

The Germans attacked the building several times a day. Each time German infantry or tanks tried to cross the square and to close in on the house, Pavlov&#x27;s men laid down a withering barrage of machine gun and AT rifle fire from the basement, the windows and the roof. The defenders, as well as the civilians hiding in the basement, were eventually relieved by counter-attacking Soviet forces after holding out from 27 September to 25 November 1942.

It has been argued that whilst the house was heavily fortified, there were limited assaults against it. It was amongst the first buildings in Stalingrad to be restored after the war, having received comparatively limited damage. German archives do not support the claim for heavy fighting for the building, and Soviet military archives attach no particular importance to the house as a defensive structure. While the building was originally captured by Pavlov, the commander of the position was Lieutenant Afanasiev. The garrison was disbanded on the night of November 24, with troops returning to their original units. These units were then sent on the offensive with Pavlov and Afansiev. Many members of the house&#x27;s garrison were killed and wounded while assaulting the German held &quot;Milk House&quot; on 26 November 1942.

== Uncertainty on dates ==
Sources conflict on the date at which the siege began, and the date at which the Soviet reinforcements reached the building and lifted the siege.

&quot;[...] the defenders of Pavlov&#x27;s House who participated in defense from 26 September 1942 till 25 November 1942.&quot; (60 days)

&quot;One of the most famous episodes of the Stalingrad battle was the defence of &#x27;Pavlov&#x27;s house&#x27;, which lasted for fifty-eight days.&quot;

==Symbolic meaning==

Pavlov&#x27;s House became a symbol of the stubborn and dogged resistance of the Soviet forces during the Battle of Stalingrad, which eventually ended in a decisive victory for the Soviet forces after months of fighting and heavy casualties on both sides. The inability of the German blitzkrieg to make headway against such grinding and self-sacrificial attrition warfare made the failure to capture Pavlov&#x27;s House, despite numerous attempts, stand out as a symbol of resistance against a supposedly superior force.

Vasily Chuikov, commanding general of the Soviet forces in Stalingrad, later joked that the Germans lost more men trying to take Pavlov&#x27;s House than they did taking Paris.

Pavlov&#x27;s &quot;House&quot; was rebuilt after the battle and is used as an apartment building today. There is an attached memorial constructed from bricks picked up after the battle on the East side facing the Volga.

Pavlov was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union for his actions.

==Cultural references==
The symbolic significance of Pavlov&#x27;s House has been recognized in popular culture. In the video game Call of Duty (video game), a mission titled &quot;Pavlov&#x27;s House&quot; allows players to engage in a fictionalized version of the defense, highlighting the historical event&#x27;s lasting impact.

== Recent reporting ==
A Russian TV documentary in 2009, &quot;Legendary Redoubt&quot;, (Легендарный редут) on the Russian Channel One reported on Pavlov&#x27;s House.

The last member of Pavlov&#x27;s group, Kamoljon Turgunov from Turakurgan District, Namangan Region, Uzbekistan died on 16 March 2015, aged 93.

After the war Pavlov communicated little with his ex-comrades, with many of them bewildered by his fame and in disagreement with the story that had been built around Pavlov. In 1985 a memorial was erected, listing the names of the garrison.

<doc id="665129" wikidata="Q862430" url="?curid=665129" title="Bill Rowling">
<text>Sir Wallace Edward Rowling (; 15 November 1927 – 31 October 1995), commonly known as Bill Rowling, was a New Zealand politician who was the 30th prime minister of New Zealand from 1974 to 1975. He held office as the leader of the Labour Party.

Before entering politics, Rowling worked as a teacher and briefly served in the army; he became a member of Parliament (MP) in the 1962 Buller by-election. Not long after entering parliament Rowling began to rise through Labour&#x27;s internal hierarchy, and he was Party President from 1970 to 1973. He was serving as Minister of Finance (1972–1974) when he was appointed prime minister following the death of the highly popular Norman Kirk. His Labour Government&#x27;s effort to retrieve the economy ended with an upset victory by the National Party in November 1975. Rowling continued to lead the Labour Party but lost two more general elections. Upon retiring from the party&#x27;s leadership in 1983, he was knighted. He served as Ambassador to the United States from 1985 to 1988.

==Early life==
Rowling was born in a country suburb of Māriri neighbouring the town of Motueka, near Nelson. He was a member of a long-established farming family. His father, Arthur Rowling, started his own orchard and was the chairman of the Labour Representation Committee. Rowling&#x27;s father was friends with many prominent Labour Party politicians including Michael Joseph Savage, Peter Fraser, Paddy Webb and Bob Semple. They were regular visitors to the family home and made an impression on Rowling during his youth. He was educated at the local primary school and later Nelson College. He left aged 17 and attempted to enlist in the New Zealand Army to serve in J Force during the occupation of Japan. However authorities discovered he was under 18 preventing him from going. 

He attended the University of Canterbury, gaining a master&#x27;s degree in economics. He also attended the Christchurch College of Education (currently, University of Canterbury), qualifying as a teacher. After completing his education, Rowling taught at several schools around the country, including at Motueka, Christchurch, Waverley and in Northland. In 1953 he joined the Maori Education Service, teaching at a school in Whangape. He became involved in local political organising and formed a new branch of the Labour Party in the area. In 1955–56 he was awarded a Fulbright fellowship to the United States and taught at a junior sigh school in Seattle. He returned to New Zealand and taught at Hūkerenui. He resumed his role as a political organiser and was elected chairman of the Labour Representation Committee.

In 1958, Rowling left teaching and joined the New Zealand Army for four years eventually gaining the rank of captain. He became assistant director of Army Education. He spent a short time serving abroad in Malaysia and Singapore, a deployment connected with the Malayan Emergency. While assistant director he also lectured economics part-time at Canterbury University as well as studying accountancy.

==Member of Parliament==



In the 1960 election, Rowling was selected as the Labour Party&#x27;s candidate for the Fendalton electorate in Christchurch. Fendalton was regarded as a safe National seat, and Rowling was defeated by the National Party&#x27;s Harry Lake (who was appointed Minister of Finance in the new National government). Two years later, however, Rowling successfully contested the by-election for Buller, which had been caused by the death of prominent Labour MP Jerry Skinner. Rowling, with a farming background, became Labour&#x27;s spokesperson on Agriculture and Lands, portfolios previously held by Skinner. Rowling was to hold the Buller seat until the election of 1972, when the seat was dissolved – Rowling then contested successfully the new seat of Tasman, which he did travelling up and down the electorate by Commer campervan, which he lived in for the time.

Not long after entering parliament Rowling began to rise through Labour&#x27;s internal hierarchy. At the 1966, 1967 and 1968 party conferences Rowling stood for the vice-presidency of the Labour Party, but was narrowly defeated by Henry May on each occasion, however he managed to defeat May in 1969. The following year he was elevated to party presidency. He was the first person to be elected to their first term as president unopposed in Labour history. While Labour was in opposition under Labour leader Norman Kirk Rowling was spokesperson for several portfolios including Overseas Trade, Marketing, Broadcasting, Mines, Planning Development and natural resources.

In the lead up to the 1972 election Kirk tried to persuade Rowling to transfer from the more marginal Tasman seat to the safe Christchurch seat of Avon. Kirk feared Rowling (by then party president) might lose his seat and did not want to lose his economics expertise. Rowling refused on the grounds that such a self interested move would not be befitting of a party president.

===Minister of Finance===
When the Labour Party won power under Norman Kirk in the 1972 election, Rowling was appointed Minister of Finance. This could be seen as a considerable promotion for someone without prior ministerial experience, though the government was inexperienced as a whole with Labour&#x27;s deputy leader Hugh Watt the only minister with prior cabinet experience. His allocation of the finance portfolio was contrary to expectation, given Bob Tizard had been the finance spokesperson when in opposition. Both Warren Freer and Watt had favoured Tizard for the finance portfolio, but Kirk thought he was not steady enough for the role and was suspicious of him as an &quot;intellectual&quot;. Rowling was New Zealand&#x27;s first finance minister who was also a qualified economist.

As finance minister, Rowling imbued nationalistic sentiments, declaring his goal to make sure the country was developed &quot;by New Zealanders for New Zealanders&quot; and warned that New Zealanders were in danger of losing control of their own country and its industries. The Labour government enjoyed a record budget surplus in its first year and revalued the currency accordingly. However, the slowing global economy, an unprecedented rise in oil prices and a rapid rise in government expenditure led to soaring inflation by 1974.

The remainder of Rowling&#x27;s term as Minister of Finance was somewhat turbulent; from late in 1973, a series of externally generated crises, of which the &#x27;oil shocks&#x27; were the most serious, destabilised the New Zealand economy. These added to other problems, such as growing overseas debt and falling export prices. The government had spent large fulfilling its election promises and Kirk was loathe to reduce spending despite the economic conditions worsening. Rowling&#x27;s instinct was to reduce government expenditure to which Kirk would accuse him of being a tightwad.

===Prime Minister (1974–1975)===


In August 1974 Norman Kirk died unexpectedly. His deputy, Hugh Watt, took on the role of acting prime minister for several days while the Labour Party caucus chose a new leader. Rowling was one of several ministers speculated as potentially succeeding Kirk, though Watt was initially seen as the frontrunner. After several other possible candidates ruled themselves out, the field was narrowed to a two-way race between Rowling and Watt, with Rowling now being seen as the front-runner to win. However, the party&#x27;s National Executive and the Federation of Labour still preferred Watt.

A caucus vote was held on 6 September 1974 where Rowling received a surprisingly large majority, beating Watt 44 votes to 9. At age 46, he became the youngest New Zealand Prime Minister since 1887. Rowling was officially confirmed as party leader and 30th Prime Minister on 6 September 1974. In the cabinet reshuffle following Kirk&#x27;s death, Rowling took the foreign affairs portfolio. He was appointed to the Privy Council. Rowling had the option of replacing Kirk in the safe Labour seat of Sydenham but chose to remain in his (more marginal) home electorate of Tasman. Rowling considered the idea of holding a snap election under the guise of seeking a personal mandate for himself as prime minister. He was dissuaded from doing so to avoid looking opportunistic and due to Labour having trouble fundraising. Close colleagues in the cabinet were more keen on the idea, but the wider caucus (many of whom held marginal seats) were more reluctant. Agriculture minister Colin Moyle attempted, but failed, to convince Rowling to hold a snap election in October 1974 which he was convinced Labour would have won with the loss of only one or two seats.

Unlike the pro-life Kirk, Rowling was pro-choice. In June 1975, he set up the Royal Commission on Contraception, Sterilisation and Abortion; it issued a report in 1977, with recommendations that were incorporated into the Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion Act 1977.

Although Rowling also served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, his government concentrated primarily on domestic affairs. While Rowling&#x27;s deputy Bob Tizard had replaced him as Minister of Finance, the seriousness of the economic downturn required the Prime Minister&#x27;s attention. The Government defended heavy overseas borrowing as necessary to protect jobs. In August 1975, the New Zealand dollar was devalued by 15% to assist local manufacturers and exporters. The recession was the worst in 40 years and Rowling focused on ensuring mass unemployment did not ensue. His main policy approaches to do this were stimulatory spending to ensured domestic demand did not drop further and to persuade trade unions to agree to wage moderation. Overall the fiscal outlook during his premiership was overshadowed by the ongoing impacts of the 1973 oil crisis which constrained what could be done. Nevertheless, his government introduced a number of progressive measures, such as an expansion of spending on education by providing a standard bursary for all students in tertiary studies from 1975. Another major financial policy during Rowling&#x27;s premiership was a comprehensive superannuation scheme in which employees and employers each contributed a minimum of 4% of gross earnings.

====1975 general election====

During the 1975 election campaign, Rowling was attacked by the Opposition led by Robert Muldoon, and was generally characterised as being weak and ineffective. Rowling supporters responded with a &quot;Citizens for Rowling&quot; campaign which enlisted high-profile New Zealanders such as Sir Edmund Hillary to praise Rowling&#x27;s low-key consultative approach. The campaign was labelled as being elitist, and was generally regarded as having backfired on Rowling. While highlighting his strengths, the campaign did not play to them. According to biographer John Henderson, Rowling &quot;...was averse to the public image grooming process − the play-acting side of politics repelled him.&quot;

The November election resulted in a surprise defeat for the Labour Party, and Rowling was unable to retain the premiership.

Rowling himself felt that he never had the opportunity to show his leadership capabilities while prime minister. Henderson stated that had Rowling been re-elected he had every intention of initiating the economic reform that was delayed by Muldoon and eventually became Rogernomics, albeit in a more planned manner and slower pace.

===Leader of the Opposition===

After resigning as prime minister, Rowling managed to retain the party leadership, though murmurs about the effectiveness of his leadership abounded. His first test as leader of the Opposition came soon when Labour had to defend one of its seats in early 1976 at a by-election in Nelson. The by-election was seen as crucial to Rowling&#x27;s future as commentators were suggesting he could not withstand two losses in a row. Labour fought a strong campaign and not only retained the seat but increased their majority as well. The success in Nelson periodically quietened the speculation about Rowling&#x27;s leadership.

Rowling then had to deal with two scandals involving two of his MPs, his approach to which, were regarded as heavy-handed and unnecessary in many circles. In 1976 Island Bay MP and party vice-president Gerald O&#x27;Brien was charged by police for allegedly indecently inviting two boys back to his motel room for a drink. Despite the charges being thrown out, O&#x27;Brien was subsequently deselected by Labour as its Island Bay candidate. O&#x27;Brien maintained that it was nothing but an attempt by political enemies to &quot;get rid of me&quot;. He also stated that he got more sympathy from members of the National Party than from his own party.

This was followed by the &#x27;Moyle Affair&#x27;, in which Labour MP Colin Moyle was accused by Muldoon of having been &#x27;picked up&#x27; by the police the previous year on suspicion of homosexual activities. A Commission of Inquiry ensued and Moyle eventually resigned from Parliament intending to vindicate himself by winning a by-election for his seat of Mangere. Rowling met with him and persuaded his close friend Moyle not to seek the nomination for the . Large numbers protested at the 1977 Labour Party Conference; many in the LGBT community never forgave him.

Rowling gradually managed to improve public perceptions of him which were ironically assisted by the Moyle and O&#x27;Brien &#x27;affairs&#x27; where his public reputation for timidity turned around. &quot;The Evening Post&quot; reporter Mike Nicolaidi stated &quot;He [Rowling] is considered by some to be &#x27;a mouse&#x27; in public, but his roar is being increasingly heard within the party machine.&quot; At the 1978 election Rowling led a strong campaign which saw a huge turnaround in Labour&#x27;s fortunes, actually winning more votes than National. The election night result had National with more seats, but many seats had small majorities and it was conceivable that if special votes overturned enough electorates Labour could form a government. Ultimately this did not eventuate and Labour remained in opposition. Rowling&#x27;s leadership was credited with the turnaround in public opinion.

Following the 1978 election Rowling alienated some Māori after removing Matiu Rata, the party&#x27;s experienced and well-regarded Māori Affairs spokesman, from the Opposition front bench. Earlier, Rowling had replaced Rata with himself as convenor of Labour&#x27;s Māori Affairs Committee. Rata complained about the insensitivity of Labour&#x27;s Māori policy and went on to form his own Māori rights party, Mana Motuhake. Rata resigned his seat in fought a by-election for his constituency but Labour&#x27;s candidate Bruce Gregory retained the electorate for Labour.

Labour suffered ructions after Shadow Minister of Transport and Communications Roger Douglas released an &quot;Alternative Budget&quot; against Rowling&#x27;s wishes. The proposals were not official Labour policy and their publication was seen by Rowling as a challenge to his authority and Douglas was sacked from the shadow cabinet on 30 June 1980. Douglas then became an agitator against Rowling. Throughout 1980, Labour&#x27;s poll rating steadily declined eventually reaching the point where they were barely ahead of the Social Credit Party (a minor party). In response to this he was subjected to a leadership challenge at the end of the year. Rowling narrowly survived by one vote (his own). He was visibly angered by the challenge, calling his challengers (dubbed the Fish and Chip Brigade) &quot;nakedly ambitious rats&quot; to the press, a comment that he refused to retract.

At the 1981 election Labour once again secured more votes than the National Party but still failed to gain a majority of seats. Rowling (as in 1978) claimed a moral victory.

Following the election loss there were serious discussions regarding the future of affiliated trade unions in the Labour Party. Labour was frequently attacked for being the &#x27;party of unions&#x27; despite only 15% of unions being affiliated and providing just 8% of the annual party funds. In February 1982 Rowling gave a speech at a Labour regional conference in Timaru where he suggested Labour should sever formal links with trade unions, citing the party&#x27;s public perception being too closely associated with unions and that there had been a large demographic shift in members from the working class to middle-class liberals. Rowling was supported by his Shadow Minister for Labour, Fred Gerbic, and several leading union figures such as national secretary of the New Zealand Electrical and Related Trades Union Tony Neary and secretary of the Wellington Clothing Workers Union Frank Thorn who stated their belief that their affiliation fees were too high and offered little benefit in return. Others such as Jim Knox, the secretary of the New Zealand Federation of Labour and Jim Anderton, the president of the Labour Party, were opposed and argued for a continuing union presence in the party. By March the debate heated up with Rowling and Gerbic publicly expressing another concern that some affiliated unions had members of other parties, in particular the Socialist Unity Party (SUP). Anderton publicly disagreed with Rowling stating that the SUP had no influence in the Labour Party and that &quot;The entire membership of the SUP could be written on the back of a postage stamp.&quot; At Labour&#x27;s annual conference in May 1982 the conference delegates rejected Rowling&#x27;s proposal and union affiliation remained. As a result of this failure Douglas publicly questioned Rowling&#x27;s leadership qualities and lack of direction. Rowling did not respond though Anderton staunchly defended Rowling from Douglas&#x27; comments.

While Rowling had largely managed to undo his negative image, many people in the Labour Party nevertheless believed that it was time for a change and he announced his retirement from the leadership to the Labour caucus in late 1982. In February 1983 Rowling was succeeded as leader by the charismatic David Lange, who went on to defeat Muldoon in the 1984 election. After relinquishing the leadership he remained on the front bench as Shadow Minister of Foreign Affairs. Rowling retired from parliament at the 1984 election.

==Later life and death==

After leaving politics, Rowling was appointed by Lange as Ambassador to the United States, serving from 1985 to 1988. He held that position when the issue of nuclear weapons and ANZUS flared up between the United States and New Zealand, and he travelled extensively across the country explaining the policy. He later became president of the New Zealand Institute of International Affairs.

Exasperated at Labour&#x27;s free-market Rogernomics economic platform initiated by his successor, Rowling eventually let his party membership lapse, expressing dismay at policies undertaken by both the Fourth Labour and Fourth National governments. He was disappointed that the Labour government had disintegrated and led to Lange&#x27;s resignation as prime minister. He felt the caucus made a significant error in re-electing Douglas (who had been a thorn in Rowling&#x27;s side years earlier) to cabinet which caused Lange to quit. Rowling stated that the vote indicated caucus was &quot;bent on its own political destruction.&quot; He was supportive of Helen Clark replacing Mike Moore for the leadership of the Labour Party in 1993. He stated he felt Clark&#x27;s style of leadership would be better suited to working with other parties such as the Alliance.

Rowling later became highly involved in a number of community organisations, charities and trusts. He was chairman of the 1992 commemorations of Abel Tasman&#x27;s mapping of New Zealand. He also played a prominent role at the Museum of New Zealand, and is considered to have been the &quot;driving force&quot; behind the eventual establishment of Te Papa despite drastic public spending cutbacks. In 1988 the government had appointed him as chairman of the Museum Project Development Board. In 1992 he was appointed to the Museum of New Zealand board and he became chairman of the board in 1994. Rowling resigned from the board on 9 October 1995 citing ill-health. His family did not disclose the nature of the illness to media, only stating it was &quot;serious.&quot;

Later in that same month, Rowling died of cancer in Nelson on 31 October 1995.

==Personal life==
While teaching near Lake Rotoiti he met Glen Reeves. They married in 1951 at Waverley Anglican Church. They had five children. The couple&#x27;s second child died when she was five months old in 1957; another daughter, Kim, committed suicide at the age of 18. Rowling was a practising Anglican. In retirement he took up jogging and participated in several marathons.

==Honours and awards==
In the 1983 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Rowling was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George. He was conferred an honorary law doctorate by the University of Canterbury in 1987, and he was honoured by the Netherlands as a Commander in the Orde van Oranje-Nassau.

In the 1988 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Glen, Lady Rowling, was appointed a Companion of the Queen&#x27;s Service Order for community service.

<doc id="665131" wikidata="Q148652" url="?curid=665131" title="Prunella (plant)">
<text>Prunella is a genus of herbaceous plants in the family Lamiaceae, also known as self-heals, heal-all, or allheal for their use in herbal medicine.

==Habitat==
Most are native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, but &quot;Prunella vulgaris&quot; (common self-heal) is Holarctic in distribution, occurring in North America as well, and is a common lawn weed. Prunellas are low-growing plants, and thrive in moist wasteland and grass, spreading rapidly to cover the ground. They are members of the mint family and have the square stem common to mints.

==Biological descriptions==
The common name &quot;self-heal&quot; derives from the use of some species to treat a range of minor disorders. Self-heal can be grown from seed, or by dividing clumps in spring or autumn.

# &quot;Prunella × surrecta&quot; – central + southwestern Europe (&quot;P. grandiflora × P. vulgaris&quot;)
# &quot;Prunella vulgaris&quot; – widespread in Europe, North Africa, Asia, North America; naturalized in New Zealand, parts of South America

Subspecies are
* &quot;Prunella vulgaris&quot; ssp. &quot;aleutica&quot; (Fernald) Hultén – Aleutian selfheal
* &quot;Prunella vulgaris&quot; ssp. &quot;lanceolata&quot; (W. Bartram) Hultén – lance selfheal
* &quot;Prunella vulgaris&quot; ssp. &quot;vulgaris&quot; (L.) – common selfheal

==Uses==
===Traditional medicine===

In the Pacific Northwest, its juice was used by the Quinault and the Quileute on boils. They also used the whole plant to treat cuts and inflammations. Ointments can be made by fixing the plant with grease. Dried &quot;Prunella&quot; () is used to make a herbal drink. Prunella is also used for halitosis, especially when combined with other herbs (e.g. perilla, field mint, etc.). Herbal tea for treating ozostomia caused by oral local lesion

===Food uses===
The mildly bitter leaves are also good as salad greens. &quot;Prunella&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some &quot;Lepidoptera&quot; species including &quot;Coleophora albitarsella&quot;.

<text>Mark Strand (April 11, 1934 – November 29, 2014) was a Canadian-born American poet, essayist and translator. He was appointed Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress in 1990 and received the Wallace Stevens Award in 2004. Strand was a professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University from 2005 until his death in 2014.

== Biography ==
Strand was born in 1934 at Summerside, Prince Edward Island, Canada. to Robert Joseph Strand &amp; Sonia Apter. Raised in a secular Jewish family, he spent his early years in North America and much of his adolescence in South and Central America. Strand graduated from Oakwood Friends School in 1951 and in 1957 earned his B.A. from Antioch College in Ohio. He then studied painting under Josef Albers at Yale University, where he earned a B.F.A in 1959. On a U.S.-Italy Fulbright Commission scholarship, Strand studied 19th-century Italian poetry in Florence in 1960–61. He attended the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop at the University of Iowa the following year and earned a Master of Arts in 1962. In 1965 he spent a year in Brazil as a Fulbright Lecturer.

In 1981, Strand was elected a member of The American Academy of Arts and Letters. He served as Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress during the 1990–91 term. In 1997, he left Johns Hopkins University to accept the Andrew MacLeish Distinguished Service Professorship of Social Thought at the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago. From 2005 to his death, Strand taught literature and creative writing at Columbia University, in New York City.

Strand received numerous awards, including a MacArthur Fellowship in 1987 and the 1999 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, for &quot;Blizzard of One&quot;.

Strand died of liposarcoma on November 29, 2014, in Brooklyn, New York.

==Poetry==
Many of Strand&#x27;s poems are nostalgic in tone, evoking the bays, fields, boats, and pines of his Prince Edward Island childhood. He has been compared to Robert Bly in his use of surrealism, though he attributes his poems&#x27; surreal elements to an admiration of the works of Max Ernst, Giorgio de Chirico, and René Magritte. Strand&#x27;s poems use plain and concrete language, usually without rhyme or meter. In a 1971 interview, he said, &quot;I feel very much a part of a new international style that has a lot to do with plainness of diction, a certain reliance on surrealist techniques, and a strong narrative element.&quot;

<text>Drift ice, also called brash ice, is sea ice that is not attached to the shoreline or any other fixed object (shoals, grounded icebergs, etc.). Unlike fast ice, which is &quot;fastened&quot; to a fixed object, drift ice is carried along by winds and sea currents, hence its name. When drift ice is driven together into a large single mass (&gt;70% coverage), it is called pack ice. Wind and currents can pile up that ice to form ridges up to dozens of metres in thickness. These represent a challenge for icebreakers and offshore structures operating in cold oceans and seas.

Drift ice consists of ice floes, individual pieces of sea ice or more across. Floes are classified according to size: &quot;small&quot; – to ; &quot;medium&quot; – to ; &quot;big&quot; – to ; &quot;vast&quot; – to ; and &quot;giant&quot; – more than .

Drift ice affects:
* Security of navigation
* Climatic impact (see Polar ice packs)
* Geological impact
* Biosphere influence (see Ecology of sea ice)

Drift ice can exert tremendous forces when rammed against structures, and can shear off rudders and propellers from ships and strong structures anchored to the shore, such as piers. These structures must be retractable or removable to avoid damage. Similarly, ships can get stuck between drift ice floes.

The two major ice packs are the Arctic ice pack and the Antarctic ice pack. The most important areas of pack ice are the polar ice packs formed from seawater in the Earth&#x27;s polar regions: the Arctic ice pack of the Arctic Ocean and the Antarctic ice pack of the Southern Ocean. Polar packs significantly change their size during seasonal changes of the year. Because of vast amounts of water added to or removed from the oceans and atmosphere, the behavior of polar ice packs has a significant impact on global changes in climate.

Seasonal ice drift in the Sea of Okhotsk by the northern coast of Hokkaidō, Japan, has become a tourist attraction, and is one of the 100 Soundscapes of Japan. The Sea of Okhotsk is the southernmost area in the Northern Hemisphere where drift ice may be observed.

<doc id="665142" wikidata="Q236266" url="?curid=665142" title="Bat Ye'or">
<text>Gisèle Littman (; born 1933), better known by her pen name Bat Ye&#x27;or (, &quot;Daughter of the Nile&quot;), is an Egyptian-born, British-Swiss author and historian, known for her promulgation of the Eurabia conspiracy theory. She claims that Islam, and its perceived anti-Americanism, anti-Christian sentiment and antisemitism hold sway over European culture and politics.

Ye&#x27;or has also written about the history of Christian and Jewish religious minorities living under Islamic governments, as part of which Ye&#x27;or has popularised the term &quot;dhimmitude&quot; to define the treatment of religious minorities in such contexts.

==Early life and education==
Bat Ye&#x27;or was born into a middle-class Jewish family in Cairo, Kingdom of Egypt in 1933. Her father was Italian and had fled Italy during Mussolini&#x27;s rule, and her mother was from France. She and her parents fled Egypt in 1957 after the Suez Crisis of 1956, arriving in London as stateless refugees.

In 1958, she attended the UCL Institute of Archaeology and moved to Switzerland in 1960 to continue her studies at the University of Geneva, but never finished her master&#x27;s degree and has never held an academic position.

She was married to the British historian and activist David Littman from September 1959 until his death in May 2012. Many of her publications and works were in collaboration with Littman. Her British citizenship dates from her marriage. They moved to Switzerland in 1960, where she has lived since, and together had three children.

She has provided briefings to the United Nations and the United States Congress and has given talks at major universities such as Georgetown, Brown, Yale, Brandeis, and Columbia.

==Dhimmitude==

Ye&#x27;or is credited with popularising the neologism &quot;dhimmitude&quot;, which she discusses in detail in &quot;Islam and Dhimmitude: Where Civilizations Collide&quot;. Shahram Akbarzadeh and Joshua M. Roose suggest she equates it with servitude. Ye&#x27;or initially credited assassinated Lebanese president-elect and Phalangist militia leader Bachir Gemayel with coining the term. Later she said that she invented it herself and inspired him to use it through a friend. The term itself is derived from &quot;dhimmi&quot;, the adjectival form of the word &quot;dhimma&quot;, which means &quot;protection&quot; in Arabic and refers to the historical notion of an &quot;indefinitely renewed contract through which the Muslim community accords hospitality and protection to members of other revealed religions, on condition of their acknowledging the domination of Islam&quot;.

Ye&#x27;or describes dhimmitude as the &quot;specific social condition that resulted from jihad,&quot; and as the &quot;state of fear and insecurity&quot; of &quot;infidels&quot; who are required to &quot;accept a condition of humiliation.&quot; She believes that &quot;the dhimmi condition can only be understood in the context of Jihad,&quot; and studies the relationship between the theological tenets of Islam and the hardships of Christians and Jews under Islamic rule in different times and places. The cause of jihad, she argues, &quot;was fomented around the 8th century by Muslim theologians after the death of Muhammad and led to the conquest of large swathes of three continents over the course of a long history.&quot;

Bat Ye&#x27;or acknowledges that not all Muslims subscribe to so-called &quot;militant jihad theories of society,&quot; while arguing that the role of sharia in the 1990 Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam demonstrates that what she calls a perpetual war against those who won&#x27;t submit to Islam is still an &quot;operative paradigm&quot; in Islamic countries.

===Reception===
According to journalist Adi Schwartz from &quot;Haaretz&quot;, the fact that she is not an academic and has never taught at any university, but has worked as an independent researcher, has, along with her opinions, made her a controversial figure. He quotes professor Robert S. Wistrich, head of the Vidal Sassoon International Center for the Study of Antisemitism, who notes:
Lewis on another occasion, called the notion of Jewish &quot;&quot;dhimmi&quot;-tude&quot;, i.e., of their &quot;subservience and persecution and ill treatment&quot; under Islamic rule, a &quot;myth&quot;, which, just as the myth &quot;of a golden age of equality, of mutual respect and cooperation&quot;, &quot;contain[s] significant elements of truth,&quot; with the &quot;historic truth&quot; being &quot;in its usual place, somewhere in the middle between the extremes.&quot;

British historian Martin Gilbert in his book &quot;A History of the Twentieth Century&quot; has called her &quot;the acknowledged expert on the plight of Jews and Christians in Muslim lands&quot; who &quot;brought the issue of [their] continuing discrimination to a wide public.&quot;

Hans Jansen, Professor of Arabic and Islamic Studies at Utrecht University and MEP for Geert Wilders&#x27; Party for Freedom, wrote in &quot;Middle East Quarterly&quot; that &quot;In 1985, Bat Ye&#x27;or offered Islamic studies a surprise with her book, &quot;The Dhimmi: Jews and Christians Under Islam&quot;, a convincing demonstration that the notion of a traditional, lenient, liberal, and tolerant Muslim treatment of the Jewish and Christian minorities is more myth than reality.&quot;

Mark R. Cohen said that Bat Ye&#x27;or &quot;has made famous&quot; the term &quot;dhimmitude,&quot; which he says is &quot;misleading&quot;. He states that &quot;[w]e may choose to employ&quot; it keeping in mind that it &quot;connotes protection (its meaning in Arabic) and that it guaranteed communal autonomy, relatively free practice of religion, and equal economic opportunities, as much as it signified inferior legal status.&quot;

Michael Sells, John Henry Barrows Professor of Islamic History and Literature at the University of Chicago, argued that &quot;by obscuring the existence of pre-Christian and other old, non-Christian communities in Europe as well as the reason for their disappearance in other areas of Europe, Bat Ye&#x27;or constructs an invidious comparison between the allegedly humane Europe of Christian and Enlightenment values and the ever-present persecution within Islam. Whenever the possibility is raised of actually comparing circumstances of non-Christians in Europe to non-Muslims under Islamic governance in a careful, thoughtful manner, Bat Ye&#x27;or forecloses such comparison.&quot;

In a review of &quot;The Decline of Eastern Christianity Under Islam: From Jihad to Dhimmitude&quot;, the American historian Robert Brenton Betts commented that the book dealt with Judaism at least as much as with Christianity, that the title was misleading and the central premise flawed. He said: &quot;The general tone of the book is strident and anti-Muslim. This is coupled with selective scholarship designed to pick out the worst examples of anti-Christian behavior by Muslim governments, usually in time of war and threats to their own destruction (as in the case of the deplorable Armenian genocide of 1915). Add to this the attempt to demonize the so-called Islamic threat to Western civilization and the end-product is generally unedifying and frequently irritating.&quot;

Sidney Griffith, the head of the department of Semitic and Egyptian Languages and Literatures at the Catholic University of America wrote in a review of &quot;Decline of Eastern Christianity&quot; that Ye&#x27;or has &quot;raised a topic of vital interest&quot;; adding, however, that the &quot;theoretical inadequacy of the interpretive concepts of jihad and dhimmitude, as they are employed here&quot;, and the &quot;want of historical method in the deployments of the documents which serve as evidence for the conclusions reached in the study&quot; serve as dual barriers. He goes on to say &quot;[quotations] are presented out of context, with no analysis or explanation. One has the impression that in their bulk they are simply meant to undergird the contentions made in the first part of the book&quot;, concluding that thus Ye&#x27;or has &quot;written a polemical tract, not responsible historical analysis.&quot;

In a review of &quot;The Decline of Eastern Christianity Under Islam&quot;, City University of New York Distinguished Professor of History Chase F. Robinson writes,
According to the American scholar Joel Beinin, Bat Ye&#x27;or exemplifies the &quot;neo-lachrymose&quot; perspective on Egyptian Jewish history. According to Beinin, this perspective has been &quot;consecrated&quot; as &quot;the normative Zionist interpretation of the history of Jews in Egypt.&quot;

Robert Spencer, an American anti-Islamic polemicist, described her as &quot;the pioneering scholar of dhimmitude, of the institutionalized discrimination and harassment of non-Muslims under Islamic law&quot;. He argued that she had turned this area, which he believed the &quot;Middle East studies establishment&quot; has hitherto been afraid of or indifferent to, into a field of academic study.

Irshad Manji describes her as &quot;a scholar who dumps cold water on any dreamy view of how Muslims have historically dealt with the &#x27;other&#x27;.&quot;

==Eurabia conspiracy theory==
Ye&#x27;or&#x27;s books &quot;Eurabia: The Euro-Arab Axis&quot; (2005) and &quot;Europe, Globalization, and the Coming of the Universal Caliphate&quot; (2011) originated the Eurabia conspiracy theory, which alleged a relationship from the 1970s onwards between the European Union (previously the European Economic Community) and the Arab states.

===Reception===
The notion of &quot;Eurabia&quot; has been dismissed as a conspiracy theory by academics and other commentators. For example, writing in &quot;Race &amp; Class&quot; in 2006, author and freelance journalist Matt Carr states, &quot;In order to accept Ye&#x27;or&#x27;s ridiculous thesis, it is necessary to believe not only in the existence of a concerted Islamic plot to subjugate Europe, involving all Arab governments, whether &#x27;Islamic&#x27; or not, but also to credit a secret and unelected parliamentary body with the astounding ability to transform all Europe&#x27;s major political, economic and cultural institutions into subservient instruments of &#x27;jihad&#x27; without any of the continent&#x27;s press or elected institutions being aware of it.&quot;

Carr argues that Bat Ye&#x27;or is the &quot;main inspiration&quot; for many conspiracy theories current on the far-right. Furthermore, Carr notes that &quot;[s]tripped of its Islamic content, the broad contours of Ye&#x27;or&#x27;s preposterous thesis [in &quot;Eurabia: The Euro-Arab Axis&quot;] recall the anti-Semitic conspiracy theories of the first half of the twentieth century and contemporary notions of the &#x27;Zionist Occupation Government&#x27; prevalent in far-right circles in the US&quot;. He notes further that Bat Ye&#x27;or&#x27;s analysis is driven by a contempt of &quot;Islam&#x27;s celebrated cultural achievements&quot; and a view of Islam as a &quot;perennially barbaric, parasitic and oppressive religion&quot;.

In a &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; interview, referring to &quot;Eurabia: The Euro-Arab Axis&quot; the Jewish British historian Martin Gilbert stated &quot;I&#x27;ve read Bat Yeor&#x27;s book. I know her and have a great respect for her sense of anguish… I&#x27;m saying that her book – which is 100 percent accurate – is an alarm call that will ultimately prevent what she&#x27;s warning about from taking place.&quot;

Bruce Bawer, writing in &quot;The Hudson Review&quot; on &quot;Eurabia: The Euro-Arab Axis&quot;, wrote that &quot;[n]o book explains the European Muslim situation, in all its complexity, more ably,&quot; &quot;[i]t&#x27;s hard to overstate this book&#x27;s importance… Eurabia is eye-opening and required reading for anyone seriously interested in understanding Europe&#x27;s current predicament and its probable fate.&quot;

According to Daniel Pipes, &quot;Bat Ye&#x27;or has traced a nearly secret history of Europe over the past thirty years, convincingly showing how the Euro-Arab Dialogue has blossomed from a minor discussion group into the engine for the continent&#x27;s Islamization. In delineating this phenomenon, she also provides the intellectual resources with which to resist it.

According to historian Niall Ferguson, &quot;future historians will one day regard her coinage of the term &#x27;Eurabia&#x27; as prophetic. Those who wish to live in a free society must be eternally vigilant. Bat Ye&#x27;or&#x27;s vigilance is unrivalled.&quot; Jewish British writer David Pryce-Jones called her a &quot;Cassandra, a brave and far-sighted spirit.&quot;

Ye&#x27;or&#x27;s Eurabia theory gathered additional media attention when it was quoted and praised by the perpetrator of the 2011 Norway massacre Anders Behring Breivik in his manifesto released on the day of the attacks. Ye&#x27;or expressed regret that Breivik took inspiration from her writings. Breivik has later admitted that he in reality is a neo-Nazi, who only in later years exploited counter-jihad writings.

In a &quot;Haaretz&quot; profile, Adi Schwartz likened her book on Eurabia to the Protocols of the Elders of Zion.

&quot;Eurabia: The Euro Arab Axis&quot; has been cited as a probable inspiration for Renaud Camus&#x27;s Great Replacement conspiracy theory.

==Counter-jihad==

The international counter-jihad movement developed in the 2000s, influenced by Ye&#x27;or&#x27;s Eurabia thesis. In 2007, she held the keynote speech at the inaugural international counter-jihad conference in Brussels. Ye&#x27;or also sits on the board of advisors of the International Free Press Society, identified as a &quot;key organization&quot; of the counter-jihad movement.

<text>The Super Scope (), known as the Nintendo Scope in Europe and Australia, is a first party light gun peripheral for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The successor to the NES Zapper, the Super Scope was released in North America and the PAL region in 1992, followed by a limited release in Japan in 1993 due to a lack of consumer demand. The peripheral consists of two devices: the wireless light gun itself, called the &quot;Transmitter&quot;, and a &quot;Receiver&quot; that connects to the second controller port of the Super NES console. The Transmitter has two action buttons, a pause button, a power switch and is powered by six AA batteries.

==Design==

The Transmitter is a bazooka-shaped device, just under long. Located about midway on top of the barrel are two buttons, the purple &quot;Fire&quot; button (colored orange in Japanese and European models) and the gray &quot;Pause&quot; button, and a switch used to turn the Super Scope off or select regular or turbo fire. In the middle on either side are two clips for attaching the sight. On the far end of the gun, on the bottom, is a six-inch (15-cm) grip with another button labeled &quot;Cursor&quot;.

On the end is the infrared receiver lens, approximately in diameter, which picks up the light from a TV. The sight mount is shaped like a wide, very shallow &quot;U&quot;, about five inches long. The end that faces toward the shoulder mount end of the Super Scope has a round open cylinder holder, where the eyepiece goes. The other end has a short, narrow tube, which forms the sight when one looks through the eyepiece that is in-line across from it. The end of the eyepiece is very simple: it is a cylinder with the diameter of a quarter, with a removable rubber piece through which the shooter looks. The sight is designed so that the aim will be correct at a distance of . The Receiver is a small box, , with a standard Super NES controller cord attached. On the front is an oval-shaped black area, receding back from the two sides to an infra-red transmitter about the size of a dime.

All of the Super Scope games made by Nintendo have a soft-reset to the game&#x27;s main title. This is accomplished by pausing the game, then, while holding CURSOR, the FIRE button must be pressed twice.

==Hit detection==

The Super Scope makes use of the scanning process used in cathode-ray-tube monitors, as CRTs were the only widely used TV monitors until the early 2000s. In short, the screen is drawn by a scanning electron beam that travels horizontally across each line of the screen from top to bottom. A fast photodiode will see any particular area of the screen illuminated only briefly as that point is scanned, while the human eye will see a consistent image due to persistence of vision.

The Super Scope takes advantage of this in a fairly simple manner: it simply outputs a signal when it sees the television raster scan and a signal when it does not. Inside the console, this signal is delivered to the PPU, which notes which screen pixel it is outputting at the moment the signal transitions from to . At the end of the frame, the game software can retrieve this stored position to determine where on the screen the gun was aimed. Most licensed Super Scope games include a calibration mode to account for both electrical delays and maladjustment of the gunsight.

The Super Scope ignores red light, as do many guns of this type because red phosphors have a much slower rate of decay than green or blue phosphors. Since the Super Scope depends on the short persistence and scan pattern of CRT pixels, it will not function with modern displays (such as plasma screens or LCDs) that continuously light each pixel.

==Compatible games==
Per &quot;GamePro:&quot;

* &quot;Battle Clash&quot;
* &quot;Bazooka Blitzkrieg&quot;
* &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; (used for bonus games)
* &quot;Lamborghini American Challenge&quot; (features a Super Scope-exclusive mode)
* &quot;Lemmings 2: The Tribes&quot; (secret easter egg allowing the super scope to destroy lemmings)

* &quot;T2: The Arcade Game&quot;
* &quot;Tin Star&quot;
* &quot;X-Zone&quot;
* &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Safari&quot; (required for play)

== Legacy ==
The Super Scope is a recurring item in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series, appearing in every game since &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;. When picked up, it acts as a projectile weapon that fires a continuous stream of small shots when the attack button is tapped repeatedly, or fires one large shot if the attack button is held down.

The S-BLAST &#x27;92 and S-BLAST &#x27;91 weapons in the Nintendo Switch game &quot;Splatoon 3&quot; have designs heavily based on the Super Scope. The S-BLAST &#x27;92 uses the original&#x27;s gray and orange color scheme, while the S-BLAST &#x27;91 uses gray and purple colors based on the North American Super Nintendo console.

<text>This is a list of chewing gum brands in the world. Chewing gum is a type of gum made for chewing, and dates back at least 5,000 years. Modern chewing gum was originally made of chicle, a natural latex. By the 1960s, chicle was replaced by butadiene-based synthetic rubber which is cheaper to manufacture. Most chewing gums are considered polymers. This list contains both chewing gum and bubblegum.

<text>Tata Steel Limited is an Indian multinational steel-making company, is headquartered in Mumbai, Maharashtra, with its primary operations based in Jamshedpur, Jharkhand. It is a part of the Tata Group.

Formerly known as Tata Iron and Steel Company Limited (TISCO), Tata Steel is among the largest steel producers globally, with an annual crude steel capacity of 35 million tonnes. It is one of the world&#x27;s most geographically diversified steel producers, with operations and commercial presence spanning multiple regions worldwide.

The group (excluding SEA operations) recorded a consolidated turnover of US$31 billion in the financial year ending 31 March 2023. It is the largest steel company in India (measured by domestic production), with an annual capacity of 21.6 million tonnes after Steel Authority of India Ltd. (SAIL). Tata Steel, SAIL, and Jindal Steel and Power are the only three Indian steel companies that have captive iron-ore mines, which gives the three companies price advantages.

Tata Steel operates in 26 countries with key operations in India, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, and employs around 80,500 people. Its largest plant is located in Jamshedpur, Jharkhand. In 2007, Tata Steel acquired the UK-based steelmaker Corus. Tata Steel is the 486th largest company in the world by revenue. It was the seventh most valuable Indian brand of 2013, according to Brand Finance.

== History ==

Tata Iron and Steel Company (TISCO) was founded by Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata and established by Sir Dorabji Tata on 26 August 1907. TISCO started pig iron production in 1911 and began producing steel in 1912 as a branch of Jamsetji&#x27;s Tata Group. The first steel ingot was manufactured on 16 February 1912. During the First World War (1914–1918), the company made rapid progress.

In 1920, TISCO incorporated The Tinplate Company of India Ltd (TCIL), as a joint venture with then Burmah Shell to manufacture Tinplate. TCIL is now Tata Tinplate and holds 70% market share in India.

By 1939, it operated the largest steel plant in the British Empire. The company launched a major modernisation and expansion program in 1951. Later, in 1958, the program was upgraded to 2 million metric tonnes per annum (MTPA) project. By 1970, the company employed around 40,000 people at Jamshedpur, and a further 20,000 in the neighbouring coal mines.

In November 2021, Tata Steel was the most profitable company in the Tata Group. In July 2019, Tata Steel Kalinganagar (TSK) was included in the list of the World Economic Forum&#x27;s (WEF) Global Lighthouse Network.

=== Nationalisation attempts ===
There have been two attempts to nationalise Tata Steel, one in 1971 and another in 1979, both of which were unsuccessful. In 1971, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi tried to nationalise the company, but failed. In 1979, Prime Minister Morarji Desai wanted to nationalise the company, spurred by Minister for Industries George Fernandes, and Minister of Steel, Mines, and Coals Biju Patnaik. However, union protests prevented such nationalisation efforts.

In 1990, the company expanded and established a subsidiary, Tata Inc., in New York. The company changed its name from TISCO to Tata Steel Ltd. in 2005.

=== Labour welfare ===

Tata Steel was among the first Indian companies to provide various labour welfare benefits, such as eight-hour workdays since 1912, free medical care since 1915, school facilities for the children of employees since 1917, paid time off since 1920, the formation of a provident fund and accident compensation in 1920, vocational training since 1921, maternity benefits since 1928, profit sharing bonuses since 1934, and retiring gratuity since 1937.

Tata Steel was listed amongst India&#x27;s &quot;Best Workplaces in Manufacturing&quot; by Great Place to Work for the fifth time in 2022.

== Expansions ==

=== Acquisitions ===
NatSteel in 2004: Tata Steel agreed to acquire the steel-making operations of the Singapore-based NatSteel for $486.4 million in cash. NatSteel had ended 2003 with a turnover of $1.4 billion and a profit before tax of $47 million. The steel businesses of NatSteel would be run by the company through a wholly owned subsidiary called Natsteel Asia Pvt. Ltd. The acquisition was completed in February 2005. At the time of acquisition, NatSteel had a capacity of about 2 million tonnes per annum of finished steel.

Millennium Steel in 2005: Tata Steel acquired a majority stake in the Thailand-based steelmaker Millennium Steel for a total cost of $130 million. It paid US$73 million to Siam Cement for a 40% stake and offered to pay 1.13 baht per share for another 25% of the shares of other shareholders. Millennium Steel has now been renamed Tata Steel Thailand and is headquartered in Bangkok. On 31 March 2013, it held approximately 68% shares in the acquired company.

Corus in 2006: Tata Steel signed a deal with Anglo-Dutch company, Corus to buy 100% stake at £4.3 billion ($8.1 billion) at 455 pence per share. On 19 November 2006, the Brazilian steel company Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional (CSN) launched a counter offer for Corus at 475 pence per share, valuing it at £4.5 billion. On 11 December 2006, Tata pre-emptively upped its offer to 500 pence per share, which was, within hours, trumped by CSN&#x27;s offer of 515 pence per share, valuing the deal at £4.9 billion. The Corus board promptly recommended both the revised offers to its shareholders. On 31 January 2007, Tata Steel won its bid for Corus after offering 608 pence per share, valuing Corus at £6.7 billion ($12 billion). In 2005, Corus employed around 47,300 people worldwide, including 24,000 in the UK. At the time of the acquisition, Corus was four times larger than Tata Steel, in terms of annual steel production. Corus was the world&#x27;s 9th largest producer of Steel, whereas Tata Steel was in the 56th position. The acquisition made Tata Steel the world&#x27;s 5th largest producer of Steel.

Tayo Rolls in 2008, formerly Tata-Yodogawa Limited is a metal fabrication and processing company headquartered in Jamshedpur, India. It was founded in 1968 as a joint venture between Tata Steel and the Japan-based Yodogawa Steels. In 2008, the company made the rights issue which was subscribed for only about 50% of its total value – Rs 60 crore. Due to undersubscription, the promoters acquired them, and as a result, Tayo Rolls became a Tata Steel Subsidiary. Tata Steel owns 55.24% of the Tayo Rolls.

Steel Engineering and Vinausteel in 2007: Tata Steel through its wholly owned Singapore subsidiary, NatSteel Asia Pte Ltd, acquired a controlling stake in both rolling mill companies located in Vietnam: Structure Steel Engineering Pte Ltd (100% stake) and Vinausteel Ltd (70% stake).

With this acquisition, Tata Steel got hold of two rolling mills, a 250,000 tonnes per year bar/wire rod mill operated by SSE Steel Ltd. and a 180,000 tonnes per year reinforcing bar mill operated by Vinausteel Ltd.

Bhushan Steel in 2018: Tata Steel acquired the entire company in 2017–18 when Insolvency proceedings were initiated against the former company on 26 July 2017 under IBC. Tata Steel emerged as the highest bidder and took over the company through its wholly-owned subsidiary Bamnipal Steel Ltd. The company was renamed as Tata Steel BSL. Later in 2021 Tata Steel amalgamated Bamnipal Steel Ltd. and Tata Steel BSL thereby the latter became a direct subsidiary of Tata Steel (72.65%).

=== Issues in Europe ===
Since Tata Steel&#x27;s Corus acquisition in 2007, Tata Steel&#x27;s Europe unit faced issues from oversupply in the market, labor unions, inexpensive imports from Chinese steel makers, and pressure from regulators for decarbonisation (green taxes) which forced Tata Steel to consolidate its businesses in Europe.

In 2015, Tata Steel was looking to sell its facilities in Port Talbot, Hartlepool, Rotherham, and Stocksbridge, which was put on hold due to Brexit. In April 2016, Tata Steel&#x27;s Long Products Europe Division located in Scunthorpe, England was sold to Greybull Capital LLP. The unit was renamed as British Steel Limited.

In February 2017, the company decided to sell its specialty division to Liberty House Group.

In September 2017, ThyssenKrupp of Germany and Tata Steel announced plans to combine their European steel-making businesses. The deal will structure the European assets as Thyssenkrupp Tata Steel, an equal joint venture. The announcement estimated that the company would be Europe&#x27;s second-largest steelmaker, and listed future headquarters in Amsterdam. However, in 2019, antitrust regulators of EU refused to accept deals citing reduction in competition. In 2019 Tata Steel decided to sell some of its non-core business units in UK.

In June 2020, the company requested £500 million in UK government support. Later in July media houses reported that the company has proposed to give away 50% of its stake in Port Talbot Steelworks to the UK Government in return for capital injections amounting to £900 million.

On 11 September 2024, Tata Steel UK announced that 2,500 jobs would go at the Port Talbot steelworks despite a £500 million taxpayer-backed deal from the UK Government.

In October 2021, Tata Steel Europe officially split its businesses into two independent entities, Tata Steel Netherlands, and Tata Steel UK.
In April 2022, Tata Steel announced that they had to find alternative sources of coal for their steel production plants in the UK and Netherlands after European nations stopped doing business with Russia because of its invasion of Ukraine.

=== Issues in South East Asia ===
In January 2019, citing debt issues and consistent losses, Tata Steel decided to sell a 70 percent stake in its S.E. Asia business (NatSteel and Tata Steel Thailand) to China&#x27;s state-owned HBIS Group for $327 million. But the deal fell through, both companies citing regulatory issues.

Later in 2019, Tata Group signed a memorandum of understanding with the Private Equity firm, Synergy Metals and Mining Fund for divestment of 70% shareholding in Tata Steel (Thailand) Public Company Ltd. (excluding NatSteel)

In 2021, Tata Steel decided against divesting the South East Asian businesses citing improvement in financials, including reduction in total debt and increase in the cash flow. This was confirmed through its regulatory filing where Tata Steel reclassified its S.E. Asians assets from &#x27;held for sale&#x27; to &#x27;continuing operations&#x27;.

In October 2021, Tata Steel announced the sale of its subsidiary Natsteel Holdings Pte. Ltd to TopTip Holding Pte, a Singapore-based steel and iron ore trading company.

=== Tata Tinplate ===
The Tinplate Company of India Limited (TCIL) is a subsidiary of Tata Steel. Founded in 1920, TCIL is India&#x27;s oldest and current largest tinplate manufacturer. The company is described as having &quot;pioneered the tinplate industry in India&quot;. TCIL has a 70% market share in India and exports a fourth of its products outside India.

In January 1920, the Burmah Oil and The Tata Iron &amp; Steel Company (TISCO) jointly incorporated The Tinplate Company of India Limited (TCIL) to cater to the demand for tinplate that arose following World War I. Burmah contributed two-thirds of the starting capital and Tata the remainder. Burmah required a tinplate for the cans used to hold the kerosene it produced.

By November 1921, structural steel for the plant and machinery had been imported from the US and UK, and the plant was established at Golmuri, Jamshedpur near the Tata Steelworks. The design was based on an Indiana rolling plant. In December 1922, the first hot dip tinning plant started rolling out finished tinplate. By 1924, a total of six mills were in production and the company was producing almost 40 percent of India&#x27;s tinplate needs. In 1926, the level of production exceeded the country&#x27;s imports for the first time. The company&#x27;s main competition was from tinplate imported from South Wales. In its early years, the Company relied to a large extent on European &#x27;covenanted&#x27; labor for supervisory and skilled roles, but this lessened over time as the skills of Indian workers developed. Just under 3,000 workers were employed in the late 1920s, and early 1930s.

With the outbreak of World War II, TCIL diversified into the manufacturing of un-tinned black plates used in Jettison tanks for the Royal Air Force. Also, TCIL took over the processing of steel from the sheet mills of Tata Steel to augment production.

TCIL entered into an agreement with Wean United Canada to switch to the Electrolytic Tinning Process. In 1973, an Electrolytic Tinning Line was commissioned with a capacity of 90,000 tonnes per annum to produce tinplate and tin-free steel. In 1996, TCIL established its first Cold Rolling Mill Complex with a capacity of 110,000 tonnes per annum, as part of a backward integration to reduce dependency on imported uncoated sheet steel coils, known as tin mill black plate (TMBP). In 2005, a printing and lacquering line was introduced as part of a forward integration to reduce supply chain inefficiencies. In 2007, mill capacity was more than doubled to 379,000 tonnes by the commissioning of a second Tinning Line; a second Cold Rolling Mill facility was added a year later. Production and sales reached 360,000 tons in 2018–19.

In 2012, Tata Steel increased its shareholding in TCIL to 73.44% which currently stands at 74.96%

Through volumes, TCIL holds 70% market share in India and exports 25% of the production to Southeast Asia, Europe, and the Middle East.

In August 2021, announced its expansion plans, an additional capacity of 3,00,000 tons per annum.

In September 2022, it was announced that the company would be merged into Tata Steel.

== Carbon footprint ==
Tata Steel Group reported Total CO2e emissions (Direct + Indirect) for 31 March 2021 at 25,790 Kt (−1,820 /-6.6% y-o-y). There is little evidence of a consistent declining trend as yet.

== Controversies ==

* Environment protection at Dhamra Port: The Dhamra Port, a joint venture between Larsen &amp; Toubro and Tata Steel near Dhamra river in Bhadrak district of Odisha has come in for criticism from groups such as Greenpeace, Wildlife Protection Society of India and the Orissa Traditional Fishworkers&#x27; Union for environment protection. The port is being built within five kilometers of the Bhitarkanika National Park, a Ramsar wetland of international importance, home to an impressive diversity of mangrove species, saltwater crocodiles and an array of avian species. The port will also be approximately 15 km. from the turtle nesting of Gahirmatha Beach, and turtles are also found immediately adjoining the port site. Aside from potential impacts on the nesting and feeding grounds of the turtles, the mudflats of the port site itself are breeding grounds for horseshoe crabs as well as rare species of reptiles and amphibians. The port began commercial production in May 2011. In response, the company website informs that it has been working with International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) for guidance and assistance in the implementation of environmental standards and designing mitigation measures for potential hazards during construction and operation of the Port.
* Job cuts in Europe: In 2019 citing surplus capacity and high costs the company announced plans to cut 3,000 jobs in Europe, including the UK (Port Talbot Steelworks), Netherlands, and other units. The decision was made after the failed attempt to consolidate with German Steelmaker Thyssenkrupp.

<text>John Mowlem (12 October 1788 – 8 March 1868) was an English stonemason, builder and founder of the quarrying and construction company &quot;Mowlem, Burt and Freeman&quot;.

==Career==
Mowlem was born in Swanage, Dorset, the son of a quarryman. As a young man, he worked in the quarries of the Isle of Purbeck: he was reputedly one of the last people to work in the quarry at Tilly Whim and, as a stonemason, on the Isle of Wight.

He travelled to London in 1807 where he started working for Henry Westmacott, the Government mason and builder, as a general foreman: Mowlem personally worked on Nelson&#x27;s Tomb in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, Somerset House and the Royal Mews at Charing Cross.

In 1812 he married Susannah Manwell, the daughter of another Swanage man. In 1822 he set up business as a paving contractor and stone merchant, building up a large business and paving Blackfriars Bridge amongst other areas. In 1839 Mowlem moved briefly to Guernsey, which was the source of much of the granite used by his business. He left the London side of the business in the care of George Burt (his wife&#x27;s nephew), and Joseph Freeman (Burt&#x27;s brother-in-law). By 1845 the two men had joined Mowlem as partners, and the company (aided by Mowlem&#x27;s purchase and management of Guernsey quarries) had won several large contracts, including the maintenance of the masonry of all government property in the London district.

Once Burt and Freeman had been taken on as partners, Mowlem moved back to Swanage, but maintained an interest in the business as well as acting philanthropically within the town of his birth. He died in 1868, childless, and the business, which ultimately became known simply as Mowlem passed on to Burt.

<doc id="665152" wikidata="Q6617035" url="?curid=665152" title="List of districts in Northern Ireland by religion or religion brought up in">
<text>This is a list of districts in Northern Ireland by religion or religion brought up in.

In the 2001 decennial census, the Census Office for Northern Ireland (CONI) asked a new question to attempt to achieve a more accurate depiction of the balance of the mainly unionist Protestant and mainly nationalist Catholic communities across Northern Ireland.

As well as asking the traditional question of &quot;Religion?&quot; – to which over 13% of respondents gave no answer – it also asked &quot;Religion brought up in?&quot; to capture those who no longer identify with a religion. The combination of the two questions gave a community background by religion for over 97% of the population. In the 2011 census the same process could only assign a religion to 94% of the population and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency ceased to call the measure &quot;community background&quot; and instead called it &quot;religion or religion brought up in&quot;.

These figures are presented here as an approximation of the community balance, without implying any particular significance to the absolute figures. Not all Protestants are unionists, and not all Catholics are nationalist. For information on recent communal conflicts in Northern Ireland, see the Troubles. The census reports do not distinguish between Protestant and other non-Catholic Christian faiths. The number of Orthodox Christians in Northern Ireland is estimated at 3000 followers.

These figures based on the 2021 census at district level mask wide variations on smaller scales. In the Belfast City Council and Derry and Strabane District Council areas, the figures at ward level vary from 99% Protestant to 92% Catholic.

Following the reform of local government in Northern Ireland the twenty-six districts created in 1973 were replaced with eleven &quot;super districts&quot;. The first election using these districts took place on 22 May 2014, electing councillors who sat in shadow form until 1 April 2015. The breakdown of religion or religion brought up in within these new boundaries at the time of the 2021 census was as follows.

<doc id="665155" wikidata="Q1061469" url="?curid=665155" title="Château Mouton Rothschild">
<text>Château Mouton Rothschild is a wine estate located in the village of Pauillac in the Médoc region, 50 km (30 mi) north-west of the city of Bordeaux, France. Originally known as &quot;Château Brane-Mouton&quot;, its red wine was renamed by Nathaniel de Rothschild in 1853 to &quot;Château Mouton Rothschild&quot;. In the 1920s it began the practice of bottling the harvest at the estate itself, rather than shipping the wine to merchants for bottling elsewhere.

The branch of the Rothschild family owning Mouton Rothschild are members of the Primum Familiae Vini.

==History==
In 1718, Château Mouton and Château Calon-Ségur were acquired by Nicolas-Alexandre de Ségur, who already owned Château Lafite and Château Latour. With the death of Nicolas-Alexandre Ségur in 1755, his estate was divided among four daughters.

The Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855 was based entirely on recent market prices for a vineyard&#x27;s wines, with one exception: Château Mouton Rothschild. Despite the market prices for their vineyard&#x27;s wines equalling that of Château Lafite Rothschild, Château Mouton Rothschild was excluded from First Great Growth status, an act that Baron Philippe de Rothschild referred to as &quot;the monstrous injustice&quot;. It is believed that the exception was made because the vineyard had recently been purchased by an Englishman and was no longer in French ownership.

In 1973, Mouton was elevated to &quot;first growth&quot; status after decades of intense lobbying by its powerful and influential owner, the only change in the original 1855 classification (excepting the 1856 addition of Château Cantemerle). This prompted a change of motto: previously, the motto of the wine was &quot;Premier ne puis, second ne daigne, Mouton suis.&quot; (&quot;First, I cannot be. Second, I do not deign to be. Mouton I am.&quot;), and it was changed to &quot;Premier je suis, Second je fus, Mouton ne change.&quot; (&quot;First, I am. Second, I used to be. Mouton does not change.&quot;)

==Vineyards==
Château Mouton Rothschild has its vineyards on the slopes leading down to the Gironde Estuary, in the Bordeaux region, mainly producing grapes of the Cabernet Sauvignon variety. Today, Château Mouton Rothschild has of grape vines made up of Cabernet Sauvignon (81%), Merlot (15%), Cabernet Franc (3%) and Petit Verdot (1%). Their wine is fermented in oak vats (they are one of the last châteaux in the Médoc to use them) and then matured in new oak casks. It is also frequently confused with the widely distributed generic Bordeaux Mouton Cadet.

==Labels==
Baron Philippe de Rothschild came up with the idea of having each year&#x27;s label designed by a famous artist of the day. In 1946, after the success of the 1945 label, this became a permanent and significant aspect of the Mouton image with labels created by some of the world&#x27;s great painters and sculptors.

Artists such as Salvador Dalí, Francis Bacon, Picasso and Miró designed labels for bottles of Mouton Rothschild.

Few exceptions are to point:

To celebrate the hundredth anniversary of the acquisition of Château Mouton, the portrait of Baron Nathaniel de Rothschild appeared on the 1953 label.

The 1973 label was dedicated to Pablo Picasso who died 8 April the same year.

In 1977, the Queen Mother Elizabeth visited the Château and a special label was designed to commemorate the visit.

In 1978 when Montreal artist Jean-Paul Riopelle submitted two designs. Baron Philippe de Rothschild liked them equally so he split the production run and used both designs.

In 1987 Baroness Philippine de Rothschild dedicated the label to her father Baron Philippe de Rothschild died on 20 January 1988.

The 1993 Mouton label, a pencil drawing of a nude reclining nymphet by the French painter Balthus was rejected for use in the United States by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. As such, for the U.S. market the label was made with a blank space where the image should have been and both versions are sought after by collectors.

An unusual gold enamel bottle was made for the 2000 vintage.

The 2003 label marks the 150th anniversary of Mouton&#x27;s entry into the family. Baron Nathaniel is depicted on the label in a period photograph. The background shows part of the deed of sale.

The popularity of the label images results in auction prices for older and more collectible years being far out of sync with the other first growths, whose labels do not change year to year.

The 2013 vintage has the work of Korean artist Lee Ufan.

==Price==
The &quot;grand vin&quot;, Château Mouton Rothschild, is one of the world&#x27;s most expensive and highly rated wines, with the average price of a 750ml bottle reaching $604.

==Business dealings==
In 1978, the company Baron Philippe de Rothschild officially announced their joint venture with Robert Mondavi to create Opus One Winery in Oakville, California. The 1990s saw large-scale expansion in the Americas under the leadership of President Cor Dubois, with the region eventually contributing almost half of the company&#x27;s turnover. In 1998, Baron Philippe de Rothschild SA teamed up with Concha y Toro of Chile to produce a quality premium red wine in a new winery/bodega built in Chile&#x27;s Maipo Valley: Almaviva. The same year saw the launch of Escudo Rojo, a fine Chilean branded wine.

In June 2003, the vineyard hosted &quot;La Fête de la Fleur&quot; at the end of Vinexpo to coincide with their 150th anniversary.

2013 : new range of three Chilean varietal wines (Sauvignon blanc, Carmenere and Cabernet Sauvignon) was launched in 2013 under the name Anderra. In the same time, in order to secure grape supplies and ensure the development of its Chilean branded wines business, Baron Philippe de Rothschild acquired 960 hectares from Viña Villavicencio.

==Judgment of Paris==
The 1970 vintage took second place, and was the highest ranked French wine, at the historic 1976 Judgment of Paris wine competition.

==In popular culture==
In John Updike&#x27;s 1954 short story &quot;Friends from Philadelphia&quot;, first published by &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, the protagonist, John, attempts to buy a bottle of wine for his parents&#x27;s dinner party, but he is denied, being too young to purchase alcohol. His parents are college educated, though not necessarily very wealthy. He seeks the help of his friend&#x27;s parents at a nearby house as his home is about a mile up the road. His friend&#x27;s parents are not college educated, though they have a good deal of money. They agree to accompany him to the store and to purchase the wine for him. He has $2.00, which his mother gave him, with which to purchase the wine, and, after a car ride in a brand new Buick during which he becomes embarrassed when questioned about what kind of car his father drives, John gives his friend&#x27;s father the money. His friend&#x27;s father, in what seems to be an active gesture of financial superiority signifying his internal struggle with the inferiority of his own education, purchases a bottle of Château Mouton Rothschild 1937, and gives it to John along with $1.26 in change. John goes home to the dinner party somewhat dismayed, for the wrong reason, that he failed to follow his mother&#x27;s instructions to buy a bottle that is &quot;inexpensive but nice.&quot;

Château Mouton Rothschild wine plays a brief, but important part in the 1971 James Bond film &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;. After Bond (Sean Connery) tastes a glass of Mouton Rothschild 1955, he casually remarks that he had expected a claret with the grand dinner he has been served. When the villain Mr. Wint (Bruce Glover) replies that the cellars are poorly stocked with clarets, Bond exposes Wint&#x27;s ignorance, pointing out that Mouton Rothschild, in fact, &quot;is&quot; a claret.

Roald Dahl cites it as one of the world&#x27;s greatest wines in his short story &quot;The Butler&quot;, from &quot;More Tales of the Unexpected&quot;.

In the film &quot;Weekend at Bernie&#x27;s&quot;, a bottle of Mouton Rothschild 1982 is visible on the table during the scene where Bernie (Terry Kiser) proposes having his two employees killed and framed for his insurance fraud.

In Agatha Christie&#x27;s short story &quot;The Labors of Hercules&quot;, the story opens with Hercule Poirot speaking with Dr. Burton over a glass of Chateau Mouton Rothschild. Dr. Burton describes the wine as &quot;Very good wine, this. Very sound.&quot;

In &quot;The Spy (TV series)&quot; approximately 5 minutes from the start of the episode #3 &quot;Alone in Damascus&quot;, the Israeli spy Eli Cohen (Sacha Baron Cohen) orders a bottle of Mouton Rothschild 1945 during the scene in the restaurant on his marine trip from Buenos Aires: &quot;I&#x27;ll have the &#x27;45 Château Mouton Rothschild&quot;. He does so just to show off his wealth and become noticed by a wealthy Syrian businessman from Damascus, Sheikh Majid Al-Ard.

<text>CACI International Inc. (originally California Analysis Center, Inc., then Consolidated Analysis Center, Inc.) is an American multinational professional services and information technology company headquartered in Northern Virginia. CACI provides services to many branches of the US federal government including defense, homeland security, intelligence, and healthcare.

CACI has approximately 23,000 employees worldwide.

CACI is a member of the Fortune 1000 Largest Companies, the Russell 2000 index, and the S&amp;P MidCap 400 Index. 
==History==
CACI was founded by Herb Karr and Harry Markowitz, who left RAND Corporation in 1962 to commercialize the SIMSCRIPT simulation programming language. The company went public in 1968. &quot;CACI&quot;, which was originally an acronym for &quot;California Analysis Center, Incorporated&quot;, was changed to stand for &quot;Consolidated Analysis Center, Incorporated&quot; in 1967. In 1973, the acronym alone was adopted as the firm&#x27;s official name; reflecting the name customers had grown familiar 
with.

Their &quot;CACI Limited&quot; (UK) subsidiary was founded in 1975.

In February 2020, CACI announced the hiring of former White House staffer Daniel Walsh as corporate strategic adviser and senior vice president.

In April 2022, CACI announced that it had been awarded the Gold Edison Award, for its critical data dark web analysis intelligence platform DarkBlue.

===Acquisitions===
CACI&#x27;s growth has been predominantly via acquisitions of other IT companies.

===Internal growth===
CACI&#x27;s SIMSCRIPT software product line added object-oriented capability, and added a new government contracting area: Space.

==Controversies==
=== Abu Ghraib ===
On June 9, 2004, a group of 256 Iraqis sued CACI International and Titan Corporation (now L-3 Services, part of L-3 Communications) in U.S. federal court regarding CACI&#x27;s alleged involvement in the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse. Details are still, in 2019, under review by authorities, and also as of 2023, where a judge refused CACI&#x27;s 18th dismissal request.

A 2017 story in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that &quot;a group of former Iraqi detainees got to make the case before a judge ... that they were tortured and that the contractor CACI International is partly to blame.&quot;

As of April 2024, an Alexandria, Virginia federal civil jury was deliberating whether to hold CACI liable for its employees&#x27; torture of three Iraqi citizens at Abu Ghraib. In November 2024, a jury awarded a total of US$42 million to the plaintiffs.

==Competitors==
Depending on the focus (USA, International), competitors to CACI include Accenture, Booz Allen Hamilton, Capgemini, Infosys, Leidos, and Science Applications International Corporation.

<doc id="665160" wikidata="Q471494" url="?curid=665160" title="Allied Rapid Reaction Corps">
<text>The Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) is a rapid reaction force maintained by NATO. It is capable of deploying a High Readiness Force (Land) Headquarters at short notice for operations and crisis response.

==History==
The ARRC was created on 1 October 1992 in Bielefeld based on the former I (British) Corps (I (BR) Corps). It was originally created as the rapid reaction corps sized land force of the Reaction Forces Concept that emerged after the end of the Cold War, with a mission to redeploy and reinforce within Allied Command Europe (ACE) and to conduct Petersberg missions out of NATO territory. The first commander, appointed in 1992 was General Sir Jeremy Mackenzie.

From 1994 the ARRC was based in the Rheindahlen Military Complex, Germany. It commanded the Land Forces of NATO&#x27;s first ever deployment as part of the Implementation Force operation in Bosnia in 1995/6 and was again deployed as the headquarters commanding Land Forces during the Kosovo War in 1999.

In 1997 assigned forces included the 7th Panzer Division; 2nd Greek Mechanised Division; 1st Turkish Mechanised Division (9th Armoured and 28th Mechanised Brigades, plus a third brigade, as assigned); 1st Armored Division; plus other formations, including the 1st and 3rd Divisions, British Army.

Since 2002 however the headquarters has been re-roled (with five other corps HQs of other NATO nations) as a High Readiness Force (Land) HQ (HRF(L)) with a broader mission. The formation HQ is under Operational Command of Supreme Allied Commander, Europe (SACEUR). The ARRC has a national Force Pool of Combat, Combat Support and Combat Service Support units with which to train and execute its mission. However, in reality COMARRC commands no forces until he receives an Activation Order from SACEUR. On receipt of ACTORD, forces from troop contributing nations, generated through the NATO Force Generation process are passed into his Operational Command for the duration of the operational deployment.

ARRC took command of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan on 4 May 2006 and then relocated from Rheindahlen to Imjin Barracks, outside Gloucester in England, in 2010 before deploying to support the ISAF Joint Command Headquarters in Afghanistan in 2011.

ARRC is also regionally aligned with the European region as part of defence engagement.

In 2017 the ARRC was tasked with responsibility for the land component of the NATO Response Force (NRF) and played an integral part in one of NATO&#x27;s capstone exercises, Exercise NOBLE JUMP 2017. The ARRC relinquished it responsibilities as the land component of the NRF on 10 January 2018 to NATO Rapid Deployable Corps - Italy.

In October 2019, the Italian Division &quot;Acqui&quot;, the Danish Division, the 1st Canadian Division, the 3rd (United Kingdom) Division, and the U.S. 4th Infantry Division were assigned to form part of the ARRC if the corps were to be deployed.

In 2021, the United Kingdom&#x27;s 104 Theatre Sustainment Brigade was transferred under direct control of HQ ARRC. The United Kingdom&#x27;s 1st Signal Brigade joined by October 2021.

In 2024, 7th Air Defence Group and 8th Engineer Brigade of the British Army were resubordinated to the ARRC. The 1st Aviation Brigade Combat Team was also given a new warfighting role to directly support HQ ARRC.

==Structure==
The structure of the ARRC is as follows:

* Commander (UK),
* Deputy Commander (Italy),
* Chief of Staff (UK),
** Engineers and Civil Military Integration (UK),
** Training and Security Force Assistance (UK),
** Joint Fires and Influence Branch (UK),
** Operations Division (USA),
** Personnel and Logistics (UK),
** Command Information Systems (UK),
** Support Division (Spain).
* 1st Signal Brigade, at Imjin Barracks, Gloucestershire
* 104 Theatre Sustainment Brigade, at Duke of Gloucester Barracks, South Cerney.
* 7th Air Defence Group, at Baker Barracks, Thorney Island.
* 8th Engineer Brigade, at Gibraltar Barracks, Minley.

The deployable headquarters infrastructure and communications for HQ ARRC is provided by the 1st Signal Brigade.

<text>Titan Corporation was a United States–based company that started as a telecommunications defense contractor with its headquarters located in San Diego, California. It was acquired by L-3 Communications on June 3, 2005 for $2.65 billion and operated as the &quot;Titan Group&quot; of L-3 Communications thereafter. In early 2007, divisions using the Titan Group name were internally directed to discontinue use of the &quot;Titan&quot; moniker and were given new names.

== History ==

The company was founded in 1981 by Gene W. Ray, who previously worked for 11 years as an executive for the Science Applications International Corporation. Originally known as Titan Systems, Inc, the company took on its final name in May 1985 upon merging with Electronic Memories &amp; Magnetics for $26 million in stock. It went public in 1987. Titan specialized in providing information and communications products, solutions, and services for intelligence agencies and the federal government, including the Department of Homeland Security. 

In 1997, Titan had a revenue of $171 million. In 1998, Titan announced that it would buy two companies, Visicom Inc. and Delfin Systems Inc., &quot;for about $47.5 million in stock to expand its computer business.&quot;

Like other defense companies, Titan diversified through a series of acquisitions over its lifetime, starting in 1988, and engaged in 10 from 2000 until its acquisition a few years later. The acquisitions began after defense spending increases were reduced, and the company sought commercial opportunities for technologies it developed. The firm got into the linguistic business in the wake of 9/11 by acquiring Fairfax, Virginia–based BTG Inc., which had a $10 million military contract dating back to 1999. When the demand for linguists grew after the United States launched the War on Terror, so did the size of Titan&#x27;s contracts. After the sale of Titan Corporation to L-3 Communications, several Titan executives went on to head Kratos Defense and Security Solutions (formerly WFI), which has also similarly been diversifying through a series of acquisitions. Titan also diversified into medical product sterilization in 1992 and electronic pasteurization and irradiation systems for ground beef in 1999.

== Contracts received ==
Titan was hired by the US military in 2003 to provide translation services, receiving $112.1 million. This accounted for 6 percent of its total revenue for 2003, according to its annual report. The company had 12,000 employees worldwide, with annual revenues in the neighborhood of $2 billion and was traded on the NYSE as TTN.

Titan had a $54.8 million contract with the Airborne Warning and Control System to support the development of spy planes. They also had an $18 million contract to design war games for the US Navy.

Titan received a competitive contract with a potential value of $163.9 million from the US Army Space and Missile Defense Command on behalf of the U.S. Northern Command for the US Joint Task Force Civil Support on January 12, 2005. The contract is &quot;to provide a full range of planning, analysis, exercise, and information technology services for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield Explosive (CBRNE) Consequence Management operations,&quot; a Titan press release announced.

Titan announced on February 14, 2006, they had received a &quot;$350 million, five-year, multiple award, indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (ID/IQ) task-based contract&quot; from the Department of Homeland Security to support the National Exercise Program.

== Legal controversies ==

* As a public military contractor, the company employed some of the personnel who were implicated in the prisoner abuse scandal at Abu Ghraib prison in 2004. Involving mostly Titan and CACI International employees, the U.S. Army &quot;found that contractors were involved in 36 percent of the [Abu Ghraib] proven incidents and identified 6 employees as individually culpable&quot;. None of these personnel were prosecuted.

In May 2004, Titan employee Adel Nakhla, an Egyptian-born American citizen, was terminated from his job after he admitted he held down inmates that were &quot;nude, handcuffed to each other and placed in sexual positions&quot; (as described by the Taguba Report).
* The company was in the process of being acquired by the Lockheed Martin Corporation, but the attempted merger fell through on June 26, 2004:

Lockheed Martin Corporation announced that it has terminated the merger agreement with The Titan Corporation because Titan did not satisfy all the closing conditions on or before June 25, 2004. Under the terms of the amended merger agreement, either party could terminate the merger agreement if Titan either (i) had not obtained written confirmation from the Department of Justice that the investigation of alleged Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) violations was resolved as to Titan and the Department did not intend to pursue any claims against Titan; or (ii) Titan had not entered into a plea agreement on or prior to June 25, 2004, provided that the terminating party had not contributed to the failure to consummate the merger through a breach of its obligations in any material respect. Titan did not satisfy either requirement.
* On March 2, 2005, the company admitted to illegally providing $2 million to the 2001 re-election campaign of President Mathieu Kérékou of Benin, and agreed to pay $28.5 million in fines and civil penalties. Titan pleaded guilty and paid the largest penalty under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act up to that point for bribery and filing false tax returns.
* Titan Corp briefly partnered with SkyWay Communications and owned stock in several other corporations related to SkyWay. SkyWay&#x27;s former DC9 aircraft, N900SA, was captured in April 2006 with 5.5 tons of cocaine on board. Investigation of the cocaine bust by Mad Cow Morning News led to the discovery that Titan had employed Makram Chams, a Lebanese national. Chams owned a Kwik-Check convenience store in Venice, Florida, where the biggest overseas money transfer to the 9/11 terrorists ($70,000 from the UAE) was sent, according to the testimony of FBI agents during the 9/11 Commission hearings.

<text>San José del Cabo (, &quot;Saint Joseph of the Cape&quot;) is a coastal city located on the Gulf of California coast, near the southern tip of Baja California Sur (state), México. San José del Cabo is situated on the edge of a shallow bay, some northeast of Cabo San Lucas, a city with which it shares the title of &quot;Los Cabos&quot;.

San José del Cabo is the seat of the Los Cabos Municipality. The city had a population of 136,285 at the 2020 census. 

The two cities are served by Los Cabos International Airport.

== People and history ==
The 2020 census found that, at the time, 136,285 people lived in the city. Together with neighboring Cabo San Lucas, it forms a major tourist hub, with over 900,000 hotel guests in 2011.

The indigenous Pericu name for San Jose del Cabo was Añiñi. The &quot;Misión Estero de las Palmas de San José del Cabo Añuití&quot; was founded in 1730 on the west bank of the nearby Río San José, which flows into the largest body of freshwater in Baja California Sur, an estuary, after flowing largely subterraneanly for from its origin in the &quot;Sierra de la Laguna&quot; (Laguna Mountains). For centuries, the river has provided a source of freshwater for the locals and animals of this coastal desert we know today as San José del Cabo; it was once used as a source of freshwater for Spanish galleons traveling back from the Philippines. The river once flowed above-ground until the beginning of the 20th century, due to anthropogenic causes. A one-kilometer long sandbar separates the estuary from what early Spanish explorers, including Sebastián Vizcaíno, called the &quot;Bahía de San Bernabé&quot; (Bay of Saint Burnaby), now known as Bahía de San José del Cabo.

San José del Cabo is one of two places where the critically endangered rice rat &quot;Oryzomys peninsulae&quot; has survived.

==Geography==
===Climate===
San José del Cabo, like almost all of the Baja California peninsula, has a tropical desert climate (Köppen &quot;BWh&quot;). The area, however, does receive slightly more rainfall than most areas further north, mainly due to tropical cyclones occasionally approaching from the south. These storms can bring very heavy precipitation events, such as the roughly on 1 September 1998, or the on 3 November 1993. Overall, rainfall events here are some of the most spontaneous anywhere in the world due to the cyclone influence, and many years can pass without significant rain, at all.

The sea experiences lows of in winter, and highs of during the summer months.

== Demographics ==
Many people from around the world live here, mostly from the USA, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, China, Korea, Japan, Spain, the United Kingdom, and other Latin American countries, among others. Some 80% of the population, however, are originally from other parts of Latin America (Mexico, Central and South America) thus enabling one to hear and experience several dialects of Spanish being spoken.

<doc id="665169" wikidata="Q845979" url="?curid=665169" title="Peruvian pelican">
<text>The Peruvian pelican (Pelecanus thagus) is a member of the pelican family. It lives on the west coast of South America, breeding in loose colonies from about 33.5 degrees south in central Chile to Piura in northern Peru, and occurring as a visitor in southern Chile and Ecuador. It used to be considered a subspecies of the brown pelican.

==Description==
These birds are dark in colour with a white stripe from the top of the bill up to the crown and down the sides of the neck. They have long tufted feathers on the top of their heads. It was previously considered a subspecies of the brown pelican (&quot;Pelecanus occidentalis&quot;). The Peruvian pelican is considerably larger, ranging from about in weight, in length and with a wingspan of about . Compared to the brown pelican, it also has proportionally longer crest feathers, as well as differences in the colours of the gular pouch, beak, scapulars and greater wing coverts.

==Behaviour==
===Breeding===
The main breeding season occurs from September to March. Clutch size is usually two or three eggs. Eggs are incubated for approximately 4 to 5 weeks, with the rearing period lasting about 3 months.

Breeding occurs in large coastal colonies.

===Feeding===
Peruvian pelicans feed on several species of fish. Unlike the brown pelican, they never dive from a great height to catch its food, instead diving from a shallow height or feeding while swimming on the surface. On occasion they may take other food items, such as nestling of imperial shags, young Peruvian diving petrels, gray gulls and cannibalize unrelated chicks of their own species. They also feed on pelagic species such as anchovies. In fact, those in the northern Humboldt Current System feed almost exclusively on one species, the Peruvian anchoveta.

The birds feed around cold-water upwellings, being found along the Humboldt Current.

==Conservation==
Its status was first evaluated for the IUCN Red List in 2008, being listed as Near threatened. Its status was reassessed in 2018, and it was again listed as Near threatened, but with increasing population.

One factor affecting their status may be competition with fishing industries for anchovies, a primary food source for the species.
