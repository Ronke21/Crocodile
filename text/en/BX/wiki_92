<text>Cow sharks are a shark family, the Hexanchidae, characterized by an additional pair or pairs of gill slits. Its 37 species are placed within the 10 genera: &quot;Gladioserratus&quot;, &quot;Heptranchias&quot;, &quot;Hexanchus&quot;, &quot;Notidanodon&quot;, &quot;Notorynchus&quot;, &quot;Pachyhexanchus&quot;, &quot;Paraheptranchias&quot;, &quot;Pseudonotidanus&quot;, &quot;Welcommia&quot;, and &quot;Weltonia&quot;.

== Description ==
Cow sharks are considered the most primitive of all the sharks, as their skeletons resemble those of ancient extinct forms, with few modern adaptations. Their excretory and digestive systems are also unspecialized, suggesting they may resemble those of primitive shark ancestors. A possible hexanchid tooth is known from the Permian of Japan, making the family a possible extant survivor of the Permian–Triassic extinction.

Their most distinctive feature, however, is the presence of a sixth, and, in two genera, a seventh, gill slit, in contrast to the five found in all other sharks. The first pair are not connected across the throat. They range from in adult body length.

These cylindrical sharks have a ventral mouth with compressed, comb-like teeth in the lower jaw and smaller, pointed teeth in the upper jaw. They have a short, angular and spinless dorsal fin. The pelvic fins are smaller than the angular pectoral fins. The caudal fin has a notch towards the end.

== Biology ==
Cow sharks are ovoviviparous, with the mother retaining the egg cases in her body until they hatch. They feed on relatively large fish of all kinds, including other sharks, as well as on crustaceans and carrion.

== Fossil Record ==
The only fossil records of the cow shark consist of mainly only isolated teeth. Although skeletal remains for this species have been found from the Jurassic time period, these have been very rare and have only been found in the &quot;Late Jurassic lithographic limestones of South Germany, Nusplingen, Solnhofen, and late Cretaceous calcareous sediments of Lebanon.&quot; Due to these sparse records some scientists conclude that the cow shark is now a more &quot;diverse and numerous species&quot;.

<doc id="686109" wikidata="Q271382" url="?curid=686109" title="Eleanor of England, Countess of Leicester">
<text>Eleanor of England (also called Eleanor Plantagenet and Eleanor of Leicester) (1215 – 13 April 1275) was the youngest child of John, King of England and Isabella of Angoulême.

==Early life==
At the time of Eleanor&#x27;s birth at Gloucester, King John&#x27;s London was in the hands of French forces, John had been forced to sign Magna Carta and Queen Isabella was in shame. Eleanor never met her father, as he died at Newark Castle when she was barely a year old. The French, led by Prince Louis the Lion, the future Louis VIII, were marching through the south. The only lands loyal to her brother King Henry III of England were in the Midlands and southwest. The barons ruled the north, but they united with the royalists under William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke, who protected and was regent for the young king Henry, and Louis was defeated in a few battles, and was forced to sign a treaty.

William Marshal died in 1219; Eleanor was promised to his son, also named William. They were married on 23 April 1224 at New Temple Church in London. The younger William was 34 and Eleanor only nine. He died in London on 6 April 1231, days before their seventh anniversary. There were no children of this marriage.

Eleanor had brought a dowry of 10 manors and 200 pounds per year to this marriage. According to the law of the time, widows were allowed to retain one third of the estates of the marriage. However, her brother-in-law Richard took all of the estates and sold many, including her dowry, to pay William&#x27;s debts. Eleanor strove for many years to recover her lost property.

The widowed Eleanor swore a holy oath of chastity in the presence of Edmund Rich, Archbishop of Canterbury.

==Simon de Montfort==

Seven years later, she met Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester. According to Matthew Paris, Simon was attracted to Eleanor&#x27;s beauty and elegance as well as her wealth and high birth. They fell in love and married secretly on 7 January 1238 at the King&#x27;s chapel in Westminster Palace. Her brother King Henry later alleged that he only allowed the marriage because Simon had seduced Eleanor. The marriage was controversial because of the oath Eleanor had sworn several years before to remain chaste. Because of this, Simon made a pilgrimage to Rome seeking papal approval for their union. Simon and Eleanor had seven children:
#Henry de Montfort (November 1238 – 1265)
#Simon de Montfort the Younger (April 1240 – 1271)
#Amaury de Montfort (1242/1243–1300)
#Guy de Montfort, Count of Nola (1244–1288)
#Joanna, born and died in Bordeaux between 1248 and 1251
#Richard de Montfort (1252–1281)
#Eleanor de Montfort Princess of Wales (1258–1282)

During the Second Barons&#x27; War, Simon de Montfort&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Lewes in 1264 led to him becoming de facto ruler of England. He tried to set up a reformed government, including the first parliament elected by citizens of the towns, but was unable to retain the support of the other barons. Several switched sides to the royalist cause; especially after the escape of Prince Edward, future Edward I of England, from Simon&#x27;s custody. Montfort was defeated at the Battle of Evesham on 4 August 1265, where he was killed along with his son. Eleanor fled to exile in France where she became a nun at Montargis Abbey, a nunnery founded by her deceased husband&#x27;s sister Amicia, who remained there as abbess. There she died on 13 April 1275, and was buried there. She was well treated by Henry, retained her incomes, and her proctors were allowed to pursue her litigation concerning the Leicester inheritance in the English courts; her will and testament were executed without hindrance.

Eleanor&#x27;s daughter, Eleanor de Montfort, was married, at Worcester in 1278, to Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, Prince of Wales. She would die giving birth to their only child, Gwenllian of Wales. After the conquest of Wales, Gwenllian was imprisoned by Edward I of England, her mother&#x27;s first cousin, at Sempringham priory, where she died 1337.

==Fiction==
Eleanor appears as a major character in Sharon Kay Penman&#x27;s novel &quot;Falls the Shadow&quot;, where she is called Nell.

Eleanor is the main character in Virginia Henley&#x27;s historical romance &quot;The Dragon and the Jewel&quot;, which tells of her life from just before her marriage to William Marshal to right before the Battle of Lewes in 1264. Her romance and marriage to Simon de Montfort are much romanticized in this novel, especially since in real life Simon is killed the year following the Battle of Lewes and the pair had already had all 7 of their children; in the book, Eleanor and Simon have only just had their first two sons. Eleanor makes a second appearance in Henley&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage Prize&quot;. Her role in the book is that of the legal guardian to her niece, Rosamond Marshal.

Eleanor appears as a side character in James Blish&#x27;s novel &quot;Doctor Mirabilis&quot;, which is primarily about Roger Bacon. Early on, Bacon&#x27;s mentor Adam Marsh is confessor to Eleanor. He tries to withdraw as her confessor, not stating the reasons, but she deduces the truth: he is too attracted to her beauty and wishes to avoid temptation. Nearer to the end of the book, Bacon visits her after Simon&#x27;s death. He is commissioned by the Pope to write a book about human longevity and wishes to raise money to write it. Eleanor remembers him as Adam&#x27;s protege. She gives him a piece of jewelry she has had for most of her life, and when he attempts to refuse it, she insists.

<text>Blackwell UK, also known as Blackwell&#x27;s and Blackwell Group, is a British academic book retailer and library supply service owned by Waterstones. It was founded in 1879 by Benjamin Henry Blackwell, after whom the chain is named, on Broad Street, Oxford. The brand now has a chain of 18 shops, and an accounts and library supply service. It employs around 1000 staff in its divisions.

The Broad Street branches, which include speciality music and art/poster shops, remained the only ones until expansion in the early 1990s, when at peak after taking over Heffers in Cambridge in 1999 and James Thin in Scotland in 2002, the company had more than 70 outlets. Its library supply chain serves an international market, but parts were sold off in 2009, with the North American arm of Blackwell Book Services and the Australian business James Bennett sold to Baker &amp; Taylor for their academic arm YBP Library Services. The group were also publishers, under the Blackwell publishing imprint, which published more than 800 journals when it was sold to John Wiley &amp; Sons in 2007 for £572 million to form Wiley-Blackwell.

The Blackwell family ran the company until 2022, with an ownership divided between voting shares owned by the family and wealth shares owned by family and others. There was a public dispute in 2002 between Julian &quot;Toby&quot; Blackwell, the current owner of the group, and Nigel Blackwell, the former chairman of the publishing arm, about the possible sale of the publishing business. This led to an offer of £300 million from Taylor &amp; Francis and to an eventual deal with John Wiley &amp; Son in 2006, as a result of which Nigel Blackwell and Toby&#x27;s son Philip Blackwell left the business, leaving Toby Blackwell the sole family member still involved in running the company. Other family voting shares were held by a trust, which Toby&#x27;s shares would transfer on his death, eventually bringing an end to the Blackwell family involvement with the company. Toby Blackwell announced in 2009 that the wealth shares would be distributed between staff, transforming the company into an employee-partnership, similar to that of retailer John Lewis, when the company returned to profitability having spent several years experiencing losses. The company reported it was expecting to return to profit in 2012.

In February 2022, the UK book chain Waterstones, itself under the umbrella of Elliott Management Corporation, bought Blackwell&#x27;s.

==History==

The company was founded in 1879 by Benjamin Henry Blackwell, son of the first city librarian, who having finished his education at 13, was apprenticed to a local bookseller for a shilling a week. His father, Benjamin Harris Blackwell, had been heavily involved in the Temperance Society. The society promoted, as well as religion, self-education and also encouraged reading. The society provided separate rooms for non-alcoholic refreshment and silent reading. A religious family, the Blackwells had also become involved with the Temperance Society due to Benjamin&#x27;s father being teetotal, and as a protest against the government making money from the excise duty on alcohol.

The flagship shop at 48–51 Broad Street, Oxford, was originally only twelve feet square but quickly grew to incorporate the upstairs, cellar and neighbouring shops. Benjamin Henry Blackwell was well respected in Oxford and was elected the first Liberal councillor for Oxford North.

Basil Blackwell, Benjamin Henry&#x27;s son, became the first Blackwell to go to university; he was awarded a scholarship at Oxford University&#x27;s Merton College. He was expected to join the family firm, however, which he did in 1913, after a spell as an apprentice publisher in London. He was tasked with expanding his father&#x27;s publishing business. 

The first Blackwell publication, &quot;Mensæ Secundæ: verses written in Balliol College&quot; by Henry Beeching, was printed in 1897. Blackwell&#x27;s began the careers of many writers: J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s first poem, &quot;Goblin Feet&quot;, was published in 1915. To promote universal access to literature, Blackwell&#x27;s pioneered a series of cheaper books, from a one-volume Shakespeare to &quot;3-and-6 novels&quot;. The publishing company was merged into the main company in 1921, and a scientific section was added in 1939.

When Benjamin Henry died in 1924, Basil Blackwell took over from his father, and went on to head the company for decades. Basil Blackwell wanted to preserve fine printing. After rescuing the Shakespeare Head Press, he commissioned belles-lettres, including well-known classics such as the &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;, the works of the Brontës and a complete version of Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;.

In 1966, the Norrington Room was opened, named after Sir Arthur Norrington, the President of Trinity College and extending under part of Trinity College. It boasts three miles (5 km) of shelving and at merited an entry in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; as the largest single room selling books.

===Recent history===
The company has followed a determined policy since the 1990s to spread out from its established Oxford base and take on a much broader UK presence.

In 1995, Blackwell&#x27;s became the first bookshop in the UK to allow its customers to purchase online from a catalogue of over 150,000 titles, and opened a flagship shop in London the same year, at 100 Charing Cross Road, which is now one of the company&#x27;s six most prominent shops. Blackwell&#x27;s took over the Heffers bookshops in Cambridge in 1999, and in 2002 acquired the academic bookshops of James Thin in Scotland.

Both the Oxford and London flagship shops have won Bookseller of the Year at the British Book Awards.

On 29 October 2012, Blackwell&#x27;s was – with Foyles, John Lewis department stores, Waitrose, Sainsbury&#x27;s and Argos – among the retailers to launch the Nook e-reader – and, from November, the Nook HD and Nook HD+ tablet computers.

The company remained in the hands of the Blackwell family until February 2022 when it was acquired by Waterstones.

<doc id="686122" wikidata="Q465592" url="?curid=686122" title="Florentine Camerata">
<text>The Florentine Camerata, also known as the Camerata de&#x27; Bardi, were a group of humanists, musicians, poets and intellectuals in late Renaissance Florence who gathered under the patronage of Count Giovanni de&#x27; Bardi to discuss and guide trends in the arts, especially music and drama. They met at the house of Giovanni de&#x27; Bardi, and their gatherings had the reputation of having all the most famous men of Florence as frequent guests. After first meeting in 1573, the activity of the Camerata reached its height between 1577 and 1582. While propounding a revival of the Greek dramatic style, the Camerata&#x27;s musical experiments led to the development of the &quot;stile recitativo&quot;. In this way it facilitated the composition of dramatic music and the development of opera.

==Membership==
The term &quot;camerata&quot; is entirely a new construct coined by the members of Bardi&#x27;s circle, although apparently based on the Italian word for &quot;chamber&quot;, &quot;camera&quot;, a term used for a room where important meetings were held. The name for Bardi&#x27;s group comes from Giulio Caccini&#x27;s score for &quot;Euridice&quot;, wherein he dedicates the work to Count Bardi, remembering the &quot;Camerata&#x27;s good years.&quot; The earliest recorded meeting was 14 January 1573 at Count Giovanni Bardi&#x27;s house. Known members of the group besides Bardi included Giulio Caccini, Pietro Strozzi, and Vincenzo Galilei (the father of the astronomer Galileo Galilei). Girolamo Mei also participated, and at a young age, Ottavio Rinuccini (1562-1621), likely the first opera librettist, may have also participated. Less prominent members of the Camerata may have included the musicians Emilio de&#x27; Cavalieri, Francesco Cini, Cristoforo Malvezzi, and Alessandro Striggio. Literary figures included Giovanni Battista Guarini, Gabriello Chiabrera, and Giovanni Battista Strozzi the younger. The social circle of Jacopo Corsi should not be confused with the Camerata of Bardi. Though they included many of the same luminaries, the rivalry between Corsi and Bardi was fierce and constant.

Unifying the Camerata members was the belief that music had become corrupt, and by returning to the forms and style of the ancient Greeks, the art of music could be improved, and thereby society could be improved as well. Though they did not originate many of their conclusions about music, the Camerata of Bardi solidified the ideas gleaned from outside thinkers like Girolamo Mei.

==Foundation==
Prior to the Camerata&#x27;s inception, there existed a popular sentiment among the Camerata&#x27;s Renaissance contemporaries that music should mimic the ancient roots of the Greeks. The current day&#x27;s thought held that the Greeks used a style between speech and song, and this belief guided the Camerata&#x27;s discourse. They were influenced by Girolamo Mei, the foremost scholar of ancient Greece at the time, who held—among other things—that ancient Greek drama was predominantly sung rather than spoken. Foundational for this belief was the writing of the Greek thinker Aristoxenus, who proposed that speech should set the pattern for song.

Largely concerned with a revival of the Greek dramatic style, the Camerata&#x27;s musical experiments led to the development of the &quot;stile recitativo&quot;. Cavalieri was the first to employ the new recitative style, trying his creative hand at a few pastoral scenes. The style later became primarily linked with the development of opera.

The criticism of contemporary music by the Camerata centered on the overuse of polyphony at the expense of the sung text&#x27;s intelligibility. Excessive counterpoint offended so the ears of the Camerata because it muddled the &quot;affetto&quot; (&quot;affection&quot;) of the important visceral reaction in poetry. It is the job of the composer to communicate the &quot;affetto&quot; into an audible, comprehensible sound. Intrigued by ancient descriptions of the emotional and moral effect of ancient Greek tragedy and comedy, which they presumed to be sung as a single line to a simple instrumental accompaniment, the Camerata proposed creating a new kind of music. Instead of trying to make the clearest polyphony they could, the Camerata voiced an opinion recorded by a contemporary Florentine, &quot;means must be found in the attempt to bring music closer to that of classical times.&quot;

==Composition==
In his formative days, Vincenzo Galilei was trained in music theory by the famed Gioseffo Zarlino. In 1582 Vincenzo Galilei performed a setting, that he composed himself, of Ugolino&#x27;s lament from Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;. Caccini also is known to have performed several of his own songs which were more or less chanted melodically over a simple chordal accompaniment. The Camerata composers sought to recreate the style of Greek music, even though actual transcribed Greek music had been lost for centuries.

The musical style which developed from these early experiments was called monody. In the 1590s, the monody developed into a vehicle capable of extended dramatic expression through the work of composers such as Jacopo Peri, working in conjunction with poet Ottavio Rinuccini. In 1598, Peri and Rinuccini produced &quot;Dafne&quot;, an entire drama sung in monodic style: this was the first creation of a new form called &quot;opera&quot;. Though Peri&#x27;s &quot;Dafne&quot; was the first performed opera, its music has been lost to the centuries. Instead, &quot;Euridice&quot;, his second opera is most-often heralded as the history-making work. The new form of opera also borrowed, especially for the librettos, from an existing pastoral poetic form called intermedio; it was mainly the musical style that was new. The instrumentation for an opera from the Camerata composers (Caccini and Peri) was written for a handful of gambas, lutes, and harpsichord or organ for continuo.

Other composers quickly began to incorporate the ideas of the Camerata into their music, and by the first decade of the seventeenth century the new &quot;music drama&quot; was being widely composed, performed and disseminated. Instead of an immediate decline in contrapuntal vocal music, there was a time of coexistence and then an eventual synthesis of monody and polyphony. Florence, Rome, and Venice became the Italian capitals of innovation and synthesis.

The Camerata&#x27;s view on counterpoint and monody did not rise to prominence without opposition. Galilei&#x27;s famed theory teacher Zarlino countered, &quot;What has the musician to do with those who recite tragedies and comedies?&quot;

In the compositions of the Camerata members, the theory preceded the practice; the men decided how the music should sound before they set to compose it. The composers of the Camerata became so faithfully committed to the exploration of their declamatory style that often their pieces became rife with monotone sonorities.

Eventually the influence of the Bardi circle waned as Giovanni Bardi fell out of favor. Bardi publicly endorsed the marriage of Francesco I de&#x27; Medici and his mistress Bianca Cappello. This endorsement was in stark contrast to the feelings of Francesco&#x27;s brother Ferdinando I de&#x27; Medici, who was a cardinal in Rome at that time.

==Legacy==
Bardi, Galilei, and Caccini left writings expounding their ideas. Bardi wrote the &quot;Discorso&quot; (1578), a long letter to Giulio Caccini, and Galilei published the &quot;Dialogo della musica antica et della moderna&quot; (1581–1582). In 1602, long after the group had disbanded, Caccini wrote &quot;Le nuove musiche&quot;.

The members of Bardi&#x27;s circle may not have recognized the full importance of their labors, as no one named the group until Caccini&#x27;s label in 1600. Galilei once marked that Bardi aided noblemen in the study of music. Yet, through the critical efforts of men like Galilei, the Camerata gained an indirect influence on the flow of music history, as Galilei challenged artists to rethink the palette of sound they had been utilizing for decades. The greatest innovation to emerge from the Camerata was not a piece of music or aesthetic ideal, but rather a door opened for further composition of dramatic music.

<text>The Amazon Surveillance System (SIVAM, ), is a complex surveillance system used for monitoring Amazônia Legal (&quot;legal Amazon area&quot;). This area includes the Brazilian rainforest, to curb the trafficking of illegal narcotics and to curb illegal logging or burning of the forest. The system uses a mixture of fixed and mobile ground radar, as well as airborne surveillance using the Embraer ERJ 145. The combined platform is called the R-99.

The U.S. military contractor Raytheon, the Brazilian firm ATECH, the Canadian Aerospace company MacDonald Dettwiler (MDA) and Embraer won the tender to build the SIVAM system. Today, the project has delivered its equipment to the government, creating the SIPAM (Amazonian Protection System) and enhancing the Brazilian Airspace Control System. SIPAM headquarters are located in Brasília, Brazil.


==Raytheon controversy==
Allegations of bribery were made against Raytheon in 1995 in connection with its efforts to win a 1.4 billion US dollar radar contract from Brazil for the SIVAM project. SIVAM, the acronym for &quot;System for Vigilance over the Amazon,&quot; was a complex radar surveillance system planned to be used to monitor the Amazon rainforest, allegedly to curb the trafficking of narcotics and to curb illegal logging or burning of the forest. Brazilian police wiretapped a telephone conversation between a special advisor to the Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, and Raytheon&#x27;s operative in Brazil, Jose Afonso Assumpcão. According to transcripts published in the Brazilian national weekly &quot;Isto É&quot;, when Assumpcão told Gomes dos Santos that Brazilian Senator Gilberto Miranda might block the Raytheon contract, Gomes dos Santos responded, &quot;Damn, did you already pay this guy?&quot;. Gomes dos Santos and Brazil&#x27;s aviation minister resigned because of allegations that this conversation suggested that bribes were paid. Raytheon ultimately was awarded the contract after lobbying by the administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton.

<text>top (table of processes) is a task manager or system monitor program, found in many Unix-like operating systems, that displays information about CPU and memory utilization.

==Overview==
The program produces an ordered list of running processes selected by user-specified criteria, and updates it periodically. Default ordering is by CPU usage, and only the top CPU consumers are shown. top shows how much processing power and memory are being used, as well as other information about the running processes. Some versions of top allow extensive customization of the display, such as choice of columns or sorting method.
top is useful for system administrators, as it shows which users and processes are consuming the most system resources at any given time.
==Implementations==
There are several different versions of top. The traditional Unix version was written by William LeFebvre and originally copyrighted in 1984. It is hosted on SourceForge, and release 3.7 was announced in 2008.

The Linux version of top is part of the procps-ng group of tools. It was originally written by Roger Binns and released in early 1992 but shortly thereafter taken over by others.

On Solaris, the roughly equivalent program is prstat. Microsoft Windows has the tasklist command and the graphical Task Manager utility. IBM AIX has an updating running processes list as part of the topas and topas_nmon commands.

The load average numbers in Linux refers to the sum of the number of processes waiting in the run-queue plus the number currently executing. The number is absolute, not relative. And thus it can be unbounded; unlike utilization. The instant variations of the number of processes are damped with an exponential decay formula which is calculated using fixed point math.

The ps program is similar to top, but instead produces a snapshot of processes taken at the time of invocation. top&#x27;s (number of iterations) option can product a similar result, causing the program to run the specified number of iterations, then exit after printing its output.

== Example ==

The first 5 rows overview the entire system.
top - 14:21:23 up 2 days, 21:40, 44 users, load average: 14.44, 14.13, 14.64
 &lt;time&gt; &lt;system uptime&gt; &lt;user count&gt; &lt;load average for the past 1, 5, 15 minutes&gt;

Tasks: 1552 total, 8 running, 1544 sleeping, 0 stopped, 0 zombie

%Cpu(s): 9.6 us, 0.7 sy, 0.0 ni, 89.5 id, 0.0 wa, 0.0 hi, 0.2 si, 0.0 st
 &lt;user&gt; &lt;system&gt; &lt;nice&gt; &lt;idle&gt; &lt;IOWait&gt; &lt;hardware/software interrupt&gt; &lt;steal time&gt;

MiB Mem : 1031911.+total, 368915.2 free, 172285.0 used, 490711.5 buff/cache
MiB Swap: 2048.0 total, 2048.0 free, 0.0 used. 807110.1 avail Mem
codice_1 is the exponential moving average of the run-queue length over the past 1/5/15 minutes. The run-queue includes both processes being run and waiting to be run. At complete utilization with no task switching, the load average is equal to the number of CPUs.

codice_2 counts the processes their statuses.

codice_3 counts the percentage of CPU usage, broken down into categories.

codice_4: Memory usage in units of mebibyte. The codice_5 is for memory used by buffers and cache.

codice_6: Swap space usage in units of mebibyte. If the system needs more memory resources and the RAM is full, inactive pages in memory are moved to the swap space. In this snapshot, there&#x27;s a total of 2048 MiB of swap, all free, indicating that no swapping is occurring, which is good for performance.

codice_7: The amount of memory available for new applications, without swapping. This considers not just the unused RAM, but also the memory that can be reclaimed from RAM caches.

The rest of the text provides a table with each row being a process, with the following columns often used out of many possible columns (the choice and ordering of columns are configurable):
 PID USER PR NI VIRT RES SHR S %CPU %MEM TIME+ COMMAND
 1 root 20 0 2456 1612 1500 S 0.0 0.0 0:00.07 init(Ubuntu)
 4 root 20 0 2456 4 0 S 0.0 0.0 0:00.00 init
 656403 user2 20 0 80.0g 3.6g 370000 S 100.0 0.4 1594:38 python3
2024198 longnam+ 20 0 50.5g 4.7g 609200 S 1.6 0.5 204:46.85 long-name-proc
2056804 longnam+ 20 0 237.1g 31.1g 23.1g S 136.8 3.1 69:54.11 python3
* codice_8: Process ID, a unique number identifying each running process.
* codice_9: The user who started the process. If the username is too long, it is cut-off with a codice_10 at the end.
* codice_11: Real-time priority of the task, computed by the system scheduler. &quot;Lower&quot; PR numbers are considered more important by the scheduler and more likely to be scheduled, which means it tends to have more CPU-time per real-time.
* codice_12: The &quot;niceness&quot; of the task, manually set by users and administrators to influence the real-time priority. A lower nice value tends to favor the process, and a higher nice value tends to disfavor the process. It ranges from -20 (most favored) to 19 (least favored).
* codice_13: Virtual memory size of the process. This includes all memory that the process can access, including memory that is swapped out, memory that is allocated but not used, and shared memory.
* codice_14: Resident set size, the portion of a process&#x27;s memory that is held in RAM. Compared with codice_13, this excludes memory that is swapped out, not yet used, or shared.
* codice_16: Shared memory size: how much of the RAM claimed by the process is sharable with other processes.
* codice_17: Status of process. The status can be: 
** codice_18 for running
** codice_17 for sleeping
** codice_20 for idle
** codice_21 for disk sleep (uninterruptible)
** codice_22 for zombie (terminated but not reaped by its parent)
** codice_23 for stopped by a job control signal or codice_24 for stopped by debugger during tracing.
* codice_25: The percentage of the CPU time that the process is currently using.
* codice_26: The percentage of the physical RAM used by the process.
* codice_27: The total CPU time the task has used since it started. This is shown in codice_28 . The plus sign in codice_27 means that it is accurate to 0.01 second. If it shows codice_30 then it is accurate to 1 second.
* codice_31: The command line argument that started the process. Unlike codice_9 , if the command is too long, it is cut-off without a codice_10 at the end.

<doc id="686139" wikidata="Q1698720" url="?curid=686139" title="Nennius of Britain">
<text>Nennius is a mythical prince of Britain at the time of Julius Caesar&#x27;s invasions of Britain (55–54 BC). His story appears in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot; (1136), a work whose contents are now considered largely fictional. In Middle Welsh versions of Geoffrey&#x27;s &quot;Historia&quot; he was called Nynniaw.

In Geoffrey&#x27;s story, Nennius is said to have fought Caesar in personal combat and taken his sword, which he used to kill many Romans. In the Tudor and Jacobean eras he became an emblem of British patriotism.

==Geoffrey&#x27;s account==
The &quot;History&quot; gives the following account of Nennius&#x27;s life: He was the third son of Heli and brother of Lud and Cassibelanus (and according to Welsh sources, of Llefelys). He fought alongside Cassibelanus when Caesar invaded. He and his nephew Androgeus led the troops of Trinovantum (London) and Canterbury, when they encountered Caesar&#x27;s own troops and Nennius faced Caesar in single combat. Caesar struck Nennius a blow to the head, but his sword got stuck in Nennius&#x27;s shield. After they separated in the melée, Nennius threw away his own sword and attacked the Romans with Caesar&#x27;s sword, killing many, including the tribune Quintus Laberius Durus (whom Geoffrey erroneously names Labienus, confusing him with Titus Labienus).

According to Geoffrey, &quot;everyone whom Nennius struck with the sword either had his head chopped off or else was so wounded as Nennius passed that he had no hope of ever recovering&quot;. For the sword, (&quot;Yellow Death&quot;) had earned its name because no one escaped death who received a wound from it.

Fifteen days after the battle Nennius died of his head wound, and was buried at London (the &quot;City of the Trinovantes&quot;), near the North Gate. Caesar&#x27;s sword, Crocea Mors, was buried with him. 

==Later versions==
The Anglo-Norman writer Wace expands on the story of the fight in his book &quot;Roman de Brut&quot; (1155), in which there is detailed description of the combat. Caesar defeats Nennius, but his sword is stuck in Nennius&#x27; shield, and he is forced to retreat when Nennius&#x27; friends come to his aid. In this version, the loss of his sword is a humiliation that leads to Caesar&#x27;s withdrawal and inspires rebellion in France. Wace also embellished details not given by Geoffrey, adding that the name Crocea Mors was &quot;stamped with letters of gold&quot; on the upper part of the sword, next to the hilt.

The account of the event also occurs in the Middle English verse &quot;Brut&quot; (ca. 1190–1215) by Layamon, which paraphrased Wace&#x27;s work. The Anglo-Norman French chronicle &quot;Scalacronica&quot; (c. 1363) by Thomas Grey also contains an account of the Julian invasion, largely derived from Wace, though the relevant text (in the Roman History section) was never published in past extracts; the work calls the sword Crochi Amour (&quot;Crooked Love&quot;), though this may be a scribal error.

The Middle Welsh &quot;Brut y Brenhinedd&quot; (mid-13th century and later manuscripts) also translates the episode, expanded with Welsh-sourced material. Here Nennius is called Nynniaw or Nynnyau (also by various other spellings). Some versions interpolate the story of &quot;Cyfranc Lludd a Llefelys&quot; and add a fourth brother named Llefelys, as already noted.

According to the Old Norse translation &quot;Breta sögur&quot; (&quot;Hauksbók&quot; copy, early 14th cent.), Nennius dies immediately the same night, because the sword had been tainted with poison.

==Modern era==
In the Tudor period Nennius became a patriotic symbol of British independence. In the poetry collection &quot;The Mirror for Magistrates&quot; Nennius is portrayed as an &quot;inspirational lesson for future British people to defend their country from foreign invasion&quot;. In the Parts Added to &quot;The Mirror for Magistrates&quot;, Nennius gives speech accusing Caesar of cheating by poisoning the sword-tip to deal him a shallow wound (&quot;scarce he perced had the skin&quot;) whose venom nevertheless killed him (&quot;my braynes it ranckle in&quot;) in fifteen days time.

Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;Faerie Queene&quot; Book II (1590) writes that Julius Caesar in slaying Nennius lost his sword which could still be seen, i.e., the sword was being displayed for viewing during the Elizabethan era. The artifact in question plausibly refers to the alleged sword Nennius took from Caesar, kept in the Tower of London, mentioned in the &quot;Anonymi Chronicon Godstovianum&quot; (15th cent.).

Nennius also appears in plays in the Jacobean era, notably Jasper Fisher&#x27;s &quot;Fuimus Troes&quot; and John Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;Bonduca&quot; (c. 1613). In the former he embodies the fighting spirit of the Britons and is given the patriotic opening speech exhorting the people to resist invasion. His funeral games after his fight with Caesar form the climactic point of the play. In the latter he is anachronistically portrayed as a contemporary of Boudica, acting as one of her generals.

<text>The Bundesliga (; ), sometimes referred to as the Fußball-Bundesliga () or 1. Bundesliga (), is a professional association football league in Germany and the highest level of the German football league system. The Bundesliga comprises 18 teams and operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the 2. Bundesliga. Seasons run from August to May. Games are played on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, with a focus on Saturdays. All of the Bundesliga clubs take part in the DFB-Pokal cup competition. The winner of the Bundesliga qualifies for the DFL-Supercup.

Fifty-eight clubs have competed in the Bundesliga since its founding. Bayern Munich has won 32 of 61 titles, as well as eleven consecutive seasons between 2013 and 2023, which is a record for a Big Five league. The Bundesliga has also seen other champions, with Borussia Dortmund, Hamburger SV, Werder Bremen, Borussia Mönchengladbach, and VfB Stuttgart most prominent among them. The Bundesliga is one of the top national leagues, ranked fourth in Europe according to UEFA&#x27;s league coefficient ranking for the current 2024–25 season, based on performances in European competitions over the past five seasons. The Bundesliga led the UEFA ranking from 1976 to 1984 and in 1990. It has also produced the continent&#x27;s top-rated club seven times. Bundesliga clubs have won eight UEFA Champions League, seven UEFA Europa League, four European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, two UEFA Super Cup, two FIFA Club World Cup, and three Intercontinental Cup titles. Its players have accumulated nine Ballon d&#x27;Or awards, two The Best FIFA Men&#x27;s Player awards, five European Golden Shoe, and three UEFA Men&#x27;s Player of the Year awards including UEFA Club Footballer of the Year.

The Bundesliga is the number one association football league in the world in terms of average attendance, with an average of 39,512 spectators per game as of the 2023-24 season making it the second-highest attendance of any sports league in the world after the American National Football League. The Bundesliga is broadcast on television in over 200 countries.

The Bundesliga was founded in 1962 in Dortmund and the first season started in 1963–64. The structure and organisation of the Bundesliga, along with Germany&#x27;s other football leagues, have undergone frequent changes. The Bundesliga was founded by the Deutscher Fußball-Bund (English: German Football Association), but is now operated by the Deutsche Fußball Liga (English: German Football League).

==Structure==
The Bundesliga is composed of two divisions: the 1. Bundesliga (although it is rarely referred to with the &quot;First&quot; prefix), and, below that, the 2. Bundesliga (2nd Bundesliga), which has been the second tier of German football since 1974. The Bundesligen (plural) are professional leagues. Since 2008, the 3. Liga (3rd League) in Germany has also been a professional league, but may not be called Bundesliga because the league is run by the German Football Association (DFB) and not, as are the two Bundesligen, by the German Football League (DFL).

Below the level of the 3. Liga, leagues are generally subdivided on a regional basis. For example, the Regionalligen are currently made up of Nord (North), Nordost (Northeast), Süd (South), Südwest (Southwest) and West divisions. Below this are thirteen parallel divisions, most of which are called Oberligen (upper leagues) which represent federal states or large urban and geographical areas. The levels below the Oberligen differ between the local areas. The league structure has changed frequently and typically reflects the degree of participation in the sport in various parts of the country. In the early 1990s, changes were driven by the reunification of Germany and the subsequent integration of the national league of East Germany.

Every team in the two Bundesligen must have a licence to play in the league, or else they are relegated into the regional leagues. To obtain a licence, teams must be financially healthy and meet certain standards of conduct as organisations.

As in other national leagues, there are significant benefits to being in the top division:
*A greater share of television broadcast licence revenues goes to 1. Bundesliga sides.
*1. Bundesliga teams draw significantly greater levels of fan support. Average attendance in the first league is 39,512 game—approximately twice the average of the 2. Bundesliga.
*Greater exposure through television and higher attendance levels helps 1. Bundesliga teams attract the most lucrative sponsorships.
*1. Bundesliga teams develop substantial financial muscle through the combination of television and gate revenues, sponsorships and marketing of their team brands. This allows them to attract and retain skilled players from domestic and international sources and to construct first-class stadium facilities.

The 1. Bundesliga is financially strong, and the 2. Bundesliga has begun to evolve in a similar direction, becoming more stable organizationally and financially, and reflecting an increasingly higher standard of professional play.
No clubs have played continuously in the Bundesliga since its foundation; on 12 May 2018, Hamburger SV was the last founding club to be relegated for the first time.

In the 2008–09 season, the Bundesliga reinstated an earlier German system of promotion and relegation, which had been in use from 1981 until 1991:
* The bottom two finishers in the Bundesliga are automatically relegated to the 2. Bundesliga, with the top two finishers in the 2. Bundesliga taking their places.
* The third-from-bottom club in the Bundesliga will play a two-legged tie with the third-place team from the 2. Bundesliga, with the winner taking up the final place in the following season&#x27;s Bundesliga.

From 1992 until 2008, a different system was used, in which the bottom three finishers of the Bundesliga were automatically relegated, to be replaced by the top three finishers in the 2. Bundesliga. From 1963 until 1981 two, or later three, teams were relegated from the Bundesliga automatically, while promotion was decided either completely or partially in promotion play-offs.

The season starts in early August and lasts until late May, with a winter break of six weeks (mid-December through to the end of January). Starting with the 2002-03 season, opening matches were introduced to feature defending champions on Friday nights on the first match day. Defending champions have not lost the opening matches since then, winning 16 of the 21 matches (up to the 2022-23 season). Starting with the 2021–22 season, kick off times were changed with Friday matches starting at 8:30 pm, Saturdays at 3:30 pm and 6:30 pm, and Sundays at 3:30 pm, 5:30 pm and 7:30 pm.

==History==
===Origins===

Before the formation of the Bundesliga, German football was played at an amateur level in a large number of sub-regional leagues until, in 1949, part-time (semi-) professionalism was introduced and only five regional &quot;Oberligen (Premier Leagues)&quot; remained. Regional champions and runners-up played a series of playoff matches for the right to compete in a final game for the national championship. On 28 January 1900, a national association, the Deutscher Fußball Bund (DFB) had been founded in Leipzig with 86 member clubs. The first recognized national championship team was VfB Leipzig, who beat DFC Prague 7–2 in a game played at Altona on 31 May 1903.

Through the 1950s, there were continued calls for the formation of a central professional league, especially as professional leagues in other countries began to draw Germany&#x27;s best players away from the semi-professional domestic leagues. At the international level, the German game began to falter as German teams often fared poorly against professional teams from other countries. A key supporter of the central league concept was national team head coach Sepp Herberger who said, &quot;If we want to remain competitive internationally, we have to raise our expectations at the national level.&quot;

Meanwhile, in East Germany, a separate league was established with the formation of the DS-Oberliga (Deutscher Sportausschuss Oberliga) in 1950. The league was renamed the Football Oberliga DFV in 1958 and was generally referred to simply as the DDR-Liga or DDR-Oberliga. The league fielded 14 teams with two relegation spots.

===Foundation===


The defeat of the national team by Yugoslavia (0–1) in a 1962 World Cup quarter-final game in Chile was one impetus (of many) towards the formation of a national league. At the annual DFB convention under new DFB president Hermann Gösmann (elected that very day) the Bundesliga was created in Dortmund at the Westfalenhallen on 28 July 1962 to begin play starting with the 1963–64 season.

At the time, there were five &quot;Oberligen&quot; (premier leagues) in place representing West Germany&#x27;s North, South, West, Southwest, and Berlin. East Germany, behind the Iron Curtain, maintained its separate league structure. 46 clubs applied for admission to the new league. 16 teams were selected based on their success on the field, economic criteria and representation of the various Oberligen.
*From Oberliga Nord: Eintracht Braunschweig, Werder Bremen, Hamburger SV
*From Oberliga West: Borussia Dortmund, 1. FC Köln, Meidericher SV (now MSV Duisburg), Preußen Münster, Schalke 04
*From Oberliga Südwest: 1. FC Kaiserslautern, 1. FC Saarbrücken
*From Oberliga Süd: Eintracht Frankfurt, Karlsruher SC, 1. FC Nürnberg, 1860 Munich, VfB Stuttgart
*From Oberliga Berlin: Hertha BSC

The first Bundesliga games were played on 24 August 1963. Early favorite 1. FC Köln was the first Bundesliga champion with second place clubs Meidericher SV and Eintracht Frankfurt.

===Reunification===
Following German reunification in 1990, the East German leagues were merged into the West German system. Dynamo Dresden and FC Hansa Rostock were seeded into the top-tier Bundesliga division ahead of the 1991–92 Bundesliga, with other clubs being sorted into lower tiers.

===21st century===
Gazprom became a major sponsor of Bundesliga football in 2006, with Gerhard Schröder&#x27;s climb to the top of the company.

==Competition format==
The German football champion is decided strictly by play in the Bundesliga. Each club plays every other club once at home and once away, which makes a total of 34 matchdays per season. Originally, a victory was worth two points, with one point for a draw and none for a loss. Since the 1995–96 season, a victory has been worth three points, while a draw remains worth a single point, and zero points are given for a loss. The club with the most points at the end of the season becomes the German champion. Currently, the top four clubs in the table qualify automatically for the group phase of the UEFA Champions League. The two teams at the bottom of the table are relegated into the 2. Bundesliga, while the top two teams in the 2. Bundesliga are promoted. The 16th-placed team (third-last) in the 1. Bundesliga and the third-placed team in the 2. Bundesliga play a two-leg play-off match. The winner of this match plays the next season in the 1. Bundesliga, and the losing side in the 2. Bundesliga.

If teams are level on points, tie-breakers are applied in the following order:
#Goal difference for the entire season
#Total goals scored for the entire season
#Head-to-head results (total points)
#Head-to-head goals scored
#Head-to-head away goals scored
#Total away goals scored for the entire season

If two clubs are still tied after all of these tie-breakers have been applied, a single match is held at a neutral site to determine the placement. However, this has never been necessary in the history of the Bundesliga.

In terms of team selection, matchday squads must have no more than five non-EU representatives. Nine substitutes are permitted to be selected, from which five can be used in the duration of the game.

===Changes in league structure===
* Number of teams:
** 1963–64 to 1964–65: 16
** 1965–66 to 1990–91: 18
** 1991–92: 20, while the East German league was being included after German reunification
** Since 1992–93: 18
* Number of teams relegated (automatic relegation except as noted):
** 1963–64 to 1973–74: 2
** 1974–75 to 1980–81: 3
** 1981–82 to 1990–91: 2 automatic plus the 16th-place team in the First Bundesliga played a two-leg relegation match against the third-place team of the Second Bundesliga for the final spot in the First Bundesliga
** 1991–92: 4
** 1992–93 to 2007–08: 3
** Since 2008–09: 2 automatic plus the 16th-place team in the First Bundesliga playing a two-leg relegation match against the third-place team of the Second Bundesliga for the final spot in the First Bundesliga

===Qualification for European competitions===
* 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th place: Group stage of UEFA Champions League
* 5th place: Group stage of UEFA Europa League
* 6th place: Play-off round of UEFA Europa Conference League
* Until the 2016–17 season, an additional place in the Europa League could also be granted via the UEFA Fair Play mechanism. This rule was maintained from the UEFA Cup. The last Bundesliga team to gain entry to the UEFA Cup via the fair play rule was Mainz 05 in 2005–06.
* DFB-Pokal (German Cup) winner: Qualifies for the group stage of Europa League regardless of league position.
** Until 2015–16, if the Cup winner qualified for the Champions League or Europa League by more than one method, the cup winner&#x27;s place in the Europa League went to the losing cup finalist if it had not already qualified for European competition, entering the competition a stage earlier than if it had won the Cup. This rule was retained from the Europa League&#x27;s predecessor, the UEFA Cup. From 2015–16, the runners-up no longer qualified for the Europa League, and the Europa League berth reserved for the DFB-Pokal winners is transferred to the highest finisher below the european qualification places.
*** Prior to 2015–16, the team that benefited from that rule did not necessarily have to be a Bundesliga member. For example, although 2. Bundesliga sides Alemannia Aachen lost to Werder Bremen in the 2004 DFB-Pokal final, Alemannia secured an entry in the 2004–05 UEFA Cup, because Werder qualified for the Champions League as First Bundesliga champions.

The number of German clubs which may participate in UEFA competitions is determined by UEFA coefficients, which takes into account the results of a particular nation&#x27;s clubs in UEFA competitions over the preceding five years.

;History of European qualification
* European Cup/Champions League:
** Up to and including 1996–97: German champion only.
** 1997–99: Top two teams; champions automatically into group phase, runners-up entered the qualifying round.
** 1999–2008: Top two teams automatically into first group phase (only one group phase starting in 2003–04). Depending on the DFB&#x27;s UEFA coefficients standing, either one or two other clubs (most recently one) entered at the third qualifying round; winners at this level entered the group phase.
** 2008–11: Top two teams automatically into group phase. Third placed team had to play in the play-off round for the right to play in the group stage.
* UEFA Cup/Europa League:
** From 1971–72 to 1998–99, UEFA member nations could send between one and four teams to the UEFA Cup. Germany was always entitled to send at least three teams to the competition and often as many as four. From 1978–79, the number of participants was determined by the DFB&#x27;s UEFA coefficient standing, prior to this the method for deciding the number of participants is unknown. The best performing teams in the league other than the champion would qualify, although if one of these teams was also winner of the DFB-Pokal then they would enter the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup instead and their UEFA Cup place would be taken by the next highest-placed team in the league (5th or 6th place). Briefly in the mid-1970s the DFB decided to allocate the last UEFA Cup place to the DFB-Pokal runner-up instead of a third or fourth team qualified by performance in the league, meaning that at this point the DFB-Pokal qualified two teams for European competition (winners for the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, runners-up for the UEFA Cup). This policy was unique amongst UEFA member associations and was dropped after only a few seasons. Starting with the 1999–2000 season and the abolition of the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup (which was then folded into the UEFA Cup), the DFB-Pokal winner now automatically qualified for the UEFA Cup alongside, depending on the DFB&#x27;s UEFA coefficients standing, between one and three extra participants (if the DFB-Pokal winner also qualified for the Champions League, they were replaced by the DFB-Pokal runner-up; if they were also qualified for the Champions League, the UEFA Cup place went to the next best placed team in the league not otherwise qualified for European competition). Since 1999, the DFB has always been entitled to enter a minimum of three clubs in the UEFA Cup/Europa League, and at times as many as four (the maximum for any European federation). Teams that entered via UEFA&#x27;s Fair Play mechanism, or those that entered through the now-defunct Intertoto Cup, did not count against the national quota. From 2006 through the final Intertoto Cup in 2008, only one First Bundesliga side was eligible to enter the Intertoto Cup and possibly earn a UEFA Cup berth. For the 2005–06 season, the DFB earned an extra UEFA Cup place via the Fair Play draw; this place went to Mainz 05 as the highest-ranked club in the Fair Play table of the First Bundesliga not already qualified for Europe.
* Cup Winners&#x27; Cup (abolished after 1999):
** The winner of the DFB-Pokal entered the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, unless that team was also league champion and therefore competing in the European Cup/Champions League, in which case their place in the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup was taken by the DFB-Pokal runner-up. Today, the DFB-Pokal winner (if not otherwise qualified for the Champions League) enters the UEFA Europa League.

==Business model==
In the 2009–10 season the Bundesliga&#x27;s turnover was €1.7bn, broken down into match-day revenue (€424m), sponsorship receipts (€573m) and broadcast income (€594m). That year it was the only European football league where clubs collectively made a profit. Bundesliga clubs paid less than 50% of revenue in players&#x27; wages, the lowest percentage out of the European leagues. The Bundesliga has the lowest ticket prices and the highest average attendance among Europe&#x27;s five major leagues.

Bundesliga clubs tend to form close associations with local firms, several of which have since grown into big global companies; in a comparison of leading Bundesliga and Premiership clubs, Bayern Munich received 55% of its revenue from company sponsorship deals, while Manchester United got 37%.

Bundesliga clubs are required to be majority-owned by German club members (known as the to discourage control by a single entity) and operate under tight restrictions on the use of debt for acquisitions (a team only receives an operating licence if it has solid financials); as a result 11 of the 18 clubs were profitable after the 2008–09 season. By contrast, in the other major European leagues numerous high-profile teams have come under ownership of foreign billionaires and a significant number of clubs have high levels of debt.

Exceptions to the 50+1 rule allow Bayer Leverkusen, TSG 1899 Hoffenheim, and VfL Wolfsburg to be owned by corporations or individual investors. In the cases of Bayer Leverkusen and Wolfsburg, the clubs were founded by major corporations (respectively Bayer AG and Volkswagen) as sports clubs for their employees, while Hoffenheim has long received its primary support from SAP co-founder Dietmar Hopp, who played in the club&#x27;s youth system.

After 2000 the German Football Association and the Bundesliga required every club to run a youth academy with the aim of developing local talent for the club and the national team. As of 2010 the Bundesliga and second Bundesliga spend €75m a year on these youth academies, which train five thousand players aged 12–18. This increased the percentage of under-23-year-olds in the Bundesliga from 6% in 2000 to 15% in 2010. This in turn allows more money to be spent on the smaller number of players that are bought.

In the 2000s, the Bundesliga was regarded as competitive, as five teams won the league title. This contrasted with the English Premier League, then dominated by a &quot;Big Four&quot; (Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool, and Arsenal), as well as France&#x27;s Ligue 1, won seven consecutive years by Lyon. Since then, however, a resurgent Bayern Munich has won each year from 2013 to 2023.

===Financial regulations===
For a number of years, the clubs in the Bundesliga have been subject to regulations not unlike the UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations agreed upon in September 2009.

At the end of each season, clubs in the Bundesliga must apply to the German Football Federation (DFB) for a licence to participate again the following year; only when the DFB, who have access to all transfer documents and accounts, are satisfied that there is no threat of insolvency do they give approval. The DFB have a system of fines and points deductions for clubs who flout rules, and those who go into the red can only buy a player after selling one for at least the same amount. In addition, no individual is allowed to own more than 49 per cent of any Bundesliga club, the only exceptions being VfL Wolfsburg, Bayer Leverkusen and current Regionalliga Nordost member FC Carl Zeiss Jena should they ever be promoted to the Bundesliga, as they were each founded as factory teams.

Despite the good economic governance, there have still been some instances of clubs getting into difficulties. In 2004, Borussia Dortmund reported a debt of €118.8 million (£83 million). Having won the Champions League in 1997 and a number of Bundesliga titles, Dortmund had gambled on maintaining their success with an expensive group of largely foreign players but failed, narrowly escaping liquidation in 2006. In subsequent years, the club went through extensive restructuring to return to financial health, largely with young home-grown players. In 2004 Hertha BSC reported debts of £24.7 million and were able to continue in the Bundesliga only after proving they had long term credit with their bank.

The leading German club Bayern Munich made a net profit of just €2.5 million in 2008–09 season (group accounts), while Schalke 04 made a net loss of €30.4 million in 2009 financial year. Borussia Dortmund GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, made a net loss of just €2.9 million in 2008–09 season.

===Attendances===
Based on its per-game average, the Bundesliga is the best-attended association football league in the world; out of all sports, its average of 39,512 spectators per game during the 2023–24 season is the second highest of any professional sports league worldwide, behind only the National Football League of the United States. Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund has the highest average attendance of any football club in the world.

Out of Europe&#x27;s five major football leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Ligue 1, and Serie A ), the Bundesliga has the lowest ticket prices and the highest average attendance. Many club stadia have large terraced areas for standing fans. Teams limit the number of season tickets to ensure everyone has a chance to see the games live, and the away club has the right to 10% of the available capacity. Match tickets often double as free rail passes which encourages supporters to travel and celebrate in a relaxed atmosphere. According to Bundesliga chief executive Christian Seifert, tickets are inexpensive (especially for standing room) as &quot;It is not in the clubs&#x27; culture so much [to raise prices]. They are very fan orientated&quot;. Uli Hoeneß, president of Bayern Munich, was quoted as saying &quot;We do not think the fans are like cows to be milked. Football has got to be for everybody.&quot;

==Media coverage==
===Domestic===
The Bundesliga TV, radio, internet, and mobile broadcast rights are distributed by DFL Sports Enterprises, a subsidiary of the Deutsche Fußball Liga. The Bundesliga broadcast rights are sold along with the broadcast rights to the relegation playoffs, 2. Bundesliga and DFL-Supercup.

From 2017 to 2018 to 2018–19, Bundesliga matches were broadcast on TV in Germany on Sky Deutschland and Eurosport. Prior to the 2019–20 season, Eurosport sublicensed its broadcast rights to sports streaming service DAZN, which will broadcast games previously allocated to Eurosport until the conclusion of the 2020–21 season. Three Friday night matches – the openers of the first and second halves of the season, and on the final matchday before the winter break – are broadcast to all Germans on Sat. 1.

Starting with the 2018–19 season, Sky began arranging simulcasts of high-profile Saturday games on free TV to promote its coverage of the league. The April 2019 Revierderby was broadcast on Das Erste, and two additional games during the 2019–20 season were broadcast on ZDF.

Radio coverage includes the national &quot;Konferenz&quot; (whip-around coverage) on the stations of ARD and full match coverage on local radio stations.

===Global===
The Bundesliga is broadcast on TV in over 200 countries. ESPN has held rights in the United States since the beginning of the 2020–21 season. 4 matches per season are reserved for linear television with the rest appearing on ESPN+. In Canada, the Bundesliga is broadcast live on DAZN.

In the United Kingdom and in Ireland, the Bundesliga is broadcast live on Sky Sports. In Spain, the Bundesliga is broadcast live on Movistar+.

In Indonesia, Bundesliga is aired on Vision+, RCTI, and even iNews in the 2024–25 season only while it was currently unavailable on beIN Sports Asia in the country since the previous season.

Taiwan&#x27;s ELTA TV are expecting to aired Bundesliga for the 2024–25 season, marked the first time Bundesliga returned to Taiwanese television since the 2020–21 season.

In 2015, digital TV operator StarTimes acquired exclusive television rights for Sub-Saharan Africa for five years starting from 2015 to 2016 season.

==Champions==
In total, 13 clubs have won the &quot;bundesliga&quot;, not including the former German championship titles won before the Bundesliga&#x27;s inception and those in the East German Oberliga. The record champions are Bayern Munich with 32 titles.

===List of champions===
===Performance by club===
Clubs in bold currently play in the top division. The German championship winners and DDR-Oberliga winners are not included in table below.

===Honours===
In 2004, the honour of &quot;Verdiente Meistervereine&quot; (roughly &quot;distinguished champion clubs&quot;) was introduced, following a custom first practised in Italy to recognize sides that have won three or more championships since 1963 by the display of gold stars on their team badges and jerseys. Each country&#x27;s usage is unique, with the following rules applying in Germany:
*3 Bundesliga titles: 1 star
*5 Bundesliga titles: 2 stars
*10 Bundesliga titles: 3 stars
*20 Bundesliga titles: 4 stars
*30 Bundesliga titles: 5 stars

The former East German side BFC Dynamo laid claim to the three stars of a 10-time champion. The club asked for equal rights and petitioned the DFL and the DFB to have their DDR-Oberliga titles recognized. BFC Dynamo received support from SG Dynamo Dresden and 1. FC Magdeburg in its attempts to achieve recognition for East German titles. The DFL eventually answered that it was not the responsible body and pointed to the DFB, but the DFB remained silent for long time. BFC Dynamo eventually took matters into their own hands and emblazoned its jerseys with three stars, while a decision was still pending. This caused some debate because the club had been the favorite club of Erich Mielke during the East German era. There were rumours that the ten titles won by the club were also due to alleged manipulation of the game by Erich Mielke, while there is no proof that referees stood under direct instructions from the Stasi and no document has ever been found in the archives that gave the Stasi a mandate to bribe referees. Critics in the DFB environment pointed to politically influenced championships in East Germany. BFC Dynamo had been supported by the Stasi and had been advantaged. The club had enjoyed privileged access to talents and access to a permanent training camp at Uckley in Königs Wusterhausen. However, also other clubs in East Germany had enjoyed similar advantages, which put the DFB in a difficult situation. Additionally, former East German referee and CDU parliamentarian Bernd Heynemann spoke out for recognition of all East German titles. The issue of recognition for titles outside the Bundesliga also affected pre-Bundesliga champions, such as Hertha BSC. The DFB finally decided in November 2005 to allow all former champions to display a single star inscribed with the number of titles, including all German men&#x27;s titles since 1903, women&#x27;s titles since 1974 and East German titles.

The DFB format only applies to teams playing below the Bundesliga (below the top two divisions), since the DFL conventions apply in the Bundesliga. Greuther Fürth unofficially display three (silver) stars for pre-war titles in spite of being in the Bundesliga. These stars are a permanent part of their crest. However, Fürth has to leave the stars out of their jersey.

Since June 2010, the following clubs have been officially allowed to wear stars while playing in the Bundesliga. The number in parentheses is for Bundesliga titles won.

* Bayern Munich (32)
* Borussia Dortmund (5)
* Borussia Mönchengladbach (5)
* Werder Bremen (4)
* Hamburger SV (3)
* VfB Stuttgart (3)

In addition, a system of one star designation was adopted for use. This system is intended to take into account not only Bundesliga titles but also other (now defunct) national championships. As of July 2014, the following clubs are allowed to wear one star while playing outside the Bundesliga. The number in parentheses is for total league championships won over the course of German football history, and would be displayed within the star. Some teams listed here had different names while winning their respective championships, these names are also noted in parentheses.

==Logo history==
For the first time in 1996, the Bundesliga was given its own logo to distinguish itself. Six years later, the logo was revamped into a portrait orientation, which was used until 2010. A new logo was announced for the 2010–11 season in order to modernise the brand logo for all media platforms. To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Bundesliga, a special logo was developed for the 2012–13 season, featuring a &quot;50&quot; and &quot;1963–2013&quot;. Following the season, the 2010 logo was restored. In December 2016, it was announced that a new logo would be used for the 2017–18 season, modified slightly for digitisation requirements, featuring a matte look.

==Influence and criticism==
The Dutch football schools, which existed and developed the Netherlands into one of Europe and the world&#x27;s major football forces, have been strongly influenced and galvanised with German football philosophy, in particular by experiences of Dutch players and managers in Bundesliga. Former England international Owen Hargreaves hailed the Bundesliga alongside Pep Guardiola for its positive impact on nurturing young talents, noting that the Bundesliga is the best league in the world to promote young footballers. Many young English talents have sought refuge in Germany in order to regain fitness and football skills. Outside Europe, the J.League of Japan, which was founded in 1992, was strongly influenced by the philosophy of the Bundesliga. Since then, the J.League has managed to establish itself as one of the best football leagues in Asia, in which it shares a beneficial relationship with its German exemplar.

The Bundesliga has earned praise for its reputation on good financial management and the physical fitness of players.

The Bundesliga outperformed the English Premier League in 2017 in online influence in China, having been accredited for its open embrace of live-streaming and fast-forward visions.

The Bundesliga has at times been criticised for a perceived lack of competitiveness due to the continued dominance of FC Bayern Munich. The club has won a record 32 titles (of 59 available) in the modern Bundesliga era since 1963; a greater level of success than that of all their rivals combined. Indeed, the Bavarian club won 11 consecutive titles between the 2012–13 season and the 2022–23 season. Former Germany international Stefan Effenberg has suggested that the league be restructured in order to end Bayern&#x27;s dominance.

<text>Bronwen Wallace (26 May 1945 – 25 August 1989) was a Canadian poet and short story writer.

==Life and career==
Wallace was born in Kingston, Ontario. She attended Queen&#x27;s University, Kingston (B.A. 1967, M.A. 1969). In 1970, she moved to Windsor, Ontario, where she founded a women&#x27;s bookstore and became active in working class and women&#x27;s activist groups. In 1977, she returned to Kingston, where she worked at a women&#x27;s shelter and taught at St. Lawrence College and Queen&#x27;s. She wrote a weekly column for the &quot;Kingston Whig-Standard&quot;. In 1988, she was writer-in-residence at the University of Western Ontario.

Her collections testify to her social activism involving women&#x27;s rights, civil rights, and social policy. A primary focus of her work was violence against women and children.

In a series of letters published in 1994 as &quot;Two Women Talking: Correspondence 1985-1987&quot;, Wallace and poet Erín Moure discuss feminist theory. Mouré defends the language philosophers (particularly Wittgenstein) who demonstrate that our speech, and the concepts expressible in language, govern our knowledge and actions. However, Wallace disagreed that language-centred writing rescues women from the patriarchy, claiming that it can be easily co-opted by patriarchs. Society&#x27;s use of politically correct language, she notes in the book, bears this out. Wallace believed that by engaging her readers in the issues of violence, she could provoke change in the reader and hence in society.

Wallace died of cancer in 1989. Her first and only published collection of short stories, &quot;People You&#x27;d Trust Your Life To&quot;, was published posthumously by McClelland &amp; Stewart in 1990.

The RBC Bronwen Wallace Award for Emerging Writers, founded by friends of the poet and the Writers&#x27; Trust of Canada, was originally an annual prize given to a young and promising poet or fiction writer who is under the age of 35 and unpublished in book form. In 2021, in response to feedback from the publishing industry and a drafted open letter by MFA candidate and editor Jade Wallace, the RBC Bronwen Wallace for Emerging Writers opened eligibility to poetry and short-fiction submissions from writers of all ages unpublished in book form.

== Awards and honours ==
In 1984, Wallace won the Pat Lowther Memorial Award for her poetry collection, &quot;Signs of the Former Tenant&quot;.

<doc id="686148" wikidata="Q1288449" url="?curid=686148" title="Enforced disappearance">
<text>An enforced disappearance (or forced disappearance) is the secret abduction or imprisonment of a person with the support or acquiescence of a state followed by a refusal to acknowledge the person&#x27;s fate or whereabouts with the intent of placing the victim outside the protection of the law. Often, forced disappearance implies murder whereby a victim is abducted, may be illegally detained, and is often tortured during interrogation, ultimately killed, and the body disposed of secretly. The party committing the murder has plausible deniability as there is no evidence of the victim&#x27;s death. 

Enforced disappearance was first recognized as a human rights issue in the 1970s as a result of its use by military dictatorships in Latin America during the Dirty War. However, it has occurred all over the world.

According to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which came into force on July 1, 2002, when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed at any civilian population, enforced disappearance qualifies as a crime against humanity, not subject to a statute of limitations, in international criminal law. On December 20, 2006, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance.

==Human rights law==
In international human rights law, disappearances at the hands of the state has been labelled as &quot;enforced&quot; or &quot;forced disappearances&quot; since the Vienna Declaration and Program of Action. For example, the practice is specifically addressed by the OAS&#x27;s Inter-American Convention on Forced Disappearance of Persons. There is also evidence that enforced disappearances occur systematically during armed conflict, such as Nazi Germany&#x27;s Night and Fog program, which constitutes war crimes.

In February 1980, the United Nations established the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, &quot;the first United Nations human rights thematic mechanism to be established with a universal mandate.&quot; Its main task &quot;is to assist families in determining the fate or whereabouts of their family members who have reportedly disappeared.&quot; In August 2014, the working group reported 43,250 unresolved cases of disappearances in 88 different states.

The International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 20, 2006, states that the widespread or systematic practice of enforced disappearances constitutes a crime against humanity. It gives victims&#x27; families the right to seek reparations and to demand the truth about the disappearance of their loved ones. The convention provides the right not to be subjected to enforced disappearance, as well as the right for the relatives of the disappeared person to know the truth and ultimate fate of the disappeared person. 

The convention contains several provisions concerning the prevention, investigation, and sanctioning of this crime. It also contains provisions about the rights of victims and their relatives, and the wrongful removal of children born during their captivity. The convention further sets forth the obligation of international cooperation, both in the suppression of the practice and in dealing with humanitarian aspects related to the crime. 

The convention establishes a Committee on Enforced Disappearances, which will be charged with important and innovative functions of monitoring and protection at an international level. Currently, an international campaign called the International Coalition against Enforced Disappearances is working towards universal ratification of the convention.

Disappearances work on two levels: not only do they silence opponents and critics who have disappeared, but they also create uncertainty and fear in the wider community, silencing others they think would oppose and criticize. Disappearances entail the violation of many fundamental human rights declared in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). For the disappeared person, these include the right to liberty, the right to personal security and humane treatment (including freedom from torture), the right to a fair trial, to legal counsel and to equal protection under the law, and the right of presumption of innocence. Their families, who often spend the rest of their lives searching for information on the disappeared, are also victims.

== International criminal law ==

According to the Rome Statute establishing the International Criminal Court, enforced disappearances constitute a crime against humanity when committed as a part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population with the knowledge of the attack. The Rome Statute defines enforced disappearances differently than international human rights law:
== History of the legal development and international jurisprudence ==

=== General background ===
The crime of forced disappearance begins with the history of the rights stated in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, formulated on August 26, 1789, in France by the authorities that emerged from the French Revolution, where it was already stated in Articles 7 and 12:

Art. 7. No person may be charged, detained, or imprisoned except in cases determined by the law and in the manner prescribed therein. Those requesting, facilitating, executing, or executing arbitrary orders must be punished... 
Art. 12. The guarantee of the rights of man and of the citizen needs a public force. This force is therefore instituted for the benefit of all, and not for the particular utility of those who are in charge of it.

Throughout the nineteenth century, along with the technological advancements applied to wars that led to increased mortality among combatants and damage to civilian populations, movements for humanitarian awareness in Western societies resulted in the founding of the first humanitarian organizations known as the Red Cross in 1859, and the first international typification of abuses and crimes in the form of the 1864 Geneva Convention. In 1946, after the Second World War, the Nuremberg trials brought to public attention to the &quot;Nacht und Nebel&quot; decree, one of the most prominent antecedents of the crime of enforced disappearance. The trials included the testimony of 20 of those persons considered a threat to the security of Nazi Germany and whom the regime detained and condemned to death in the occupied territories of Europe. However, the executions were not carried out immediately; at one time, the people were deported to Germany and imprisoned at locations such as the Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp, where they ended up disappearing and no information about their whereabouts and fate was given as per point III of the decree:III. …In case German or foreign authorities inquire about such prisoners, they are to be told that they were arrested, but that the proceedings do not allow any further information.

German Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel was condemned in connection with his role in the application of the &quot;NN decree&quot; by Adolf Hitler, although, as it had not been accepted at the time that enforced disappearances were crimes against humanity, the International Criminal Tribunal in Nuremberg found him guilty of war crimes.

Since 1974, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the United Nations Commission on Human Rights have been the first international human rights bodies to react to the phenomenon of disappearances, following complaints made in connection with the Chilean military coup of September 11, 1973. The report of the Working Group to Investigate the Situation of Human Rights in that country, which was submitted to the United Nations Commission on February 4, 1976, illustrated such a case for the first time, when Alfonso Chanfreau, of French origin, was arrested in July 1974 at his home in Santiago de Chile.

Earlier, in February 1975, the UN Commission on Human Rights had used the terms &quot;persons unaccounted for&quot; or &quot;persons whose disappearance was not justified,&quot; in a resolution that dealt with the disappearances in Cyprus as a result of the armed conflict that resulted in the division of the island, as part of the two General Assembly resolutions adopted in December 1975 with respect to Cyprus and Chile.

=== 1977 and 1979 resolutions ===
In 1977, the General Assembly of the United Nations again discussed disappearances in its resolution 32/118. By then, the Nobel Prize winner Adolfo Pérez Esquivel had made an international appeal that, with the support of the French government, obtained the response of the General Assembly in the form of resolution 33/173 of 20 December 1978, which specifically referred to &quot;missing persons&quot; and requested the Commission on Human Rights to make appropriate recommendations.

On 6 March 1979, the Commission authorized the appointment as experts of Dr. Felix Ermacora and Waleed M. Sadi, who later resigned due to political pressure, to study the question of the fate of disappearances in Chile, issuing a report to the General Assembly on 21 November 1979. Felix Ermacora&#x27;s report became a reference point on the legal issue of crime by including a series of conclusions and recommendations which were later collected by international organizations and bodies.

Meanwhile, during the same year, the General Assembly of the Organization of American States adopted a resolution on Chile on 31 October, in which it declared that the practice of disappearances was &quot;an affront to the conscience of the hemisphere&quot;, after having sent in September a mission of the Inter-American Commission to Argentina, which confirmed the systematic practice of enforced disappearances by successive military juntas. Despite the exhortations of non-governmental organizations and family organizations of the victims, in the same resolution of 31 October 1979, the General Assembly of the OAS issued a statement, after receiving pressure from the Argentine government, in which only the states in which persons had disappeared were urged to refrain from enacting or enforcing laws that might hinder the investigation of such disappearances.

Shortly after the report by Félix Ermacora, the UN Commission on Human Rights considered one of the proposals made and decided on 29 February 1980 to set up the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, the first of the so-called thematic mechanisms of the commission and the most important body of the United Nations that has since been dealing with the problem of disappearances in cases that can be attributed to governments, as well as issuing recommendations to the commission and governments on the improvement of the protection afforded to miss persons and their families and to prevent cases of enforced disappearance. Since then, different causes began to be developed in various international legal bodies, whose sentences served to establish a specific jurisprudence on enforced disappearance.

=== 1983 OAS resolution and first convictions ===
The United Nations Human Rights Committee, established in 1977 in accordance with article 28 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to monitor compliance by states parties with their obligations, issued in March 1982 and July 1983, two sentences condemning the State of Uruguay for the cases of Eduardo Bleier, a former member of the Communist Party of Uruguay, residing in Hungary and Israel, disappeared after his arrest in 1975 in Montevideo, and Elena Quinteros Almeida, missing since her arrest at the Venezuelan Embassy in Montevideo in June 1976, in an incident that led to the suspension of diplomatic relations between the two countries. In its judgments, the Committee relied on a number of articles of the International Covenant, in particular, those relating to &quot;the right to liberty and personal security&quot;, &quot;the right of detainees to be treated humanely and with respect to the inherent dignity of the human being&quot; and &quot;the right of every human being to the recognition of his juridical personality&quot;, while in the case of Quinteros, it was solved for the first time in favor of the relatives considered equally victims.

In 1983, the Organization of American States (OAS) declared by its resolution 666 XIII-0/83 that any enforced disappearance should be described as a crime against humanity. A few years later, in 1988 and 1989, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights promulgated the first convictions declaring the State of Honduras guilty of violating its duty to respect and guarantee the rights to life, liberty, and personal integrity of the disappeared Angel Manfredo Velásquez Rodríguez. Rodríguez was a Honduran student kidnapped in September 1981 in Tegucigalpa by heavily armed civilians connected with the Honduran Armed Forces and Saúl Godínez Cruz. Since the express definition of the crime of enforced disappearance had not yet been defined, the Court had to rely on different articles of the American Convention on Human Rights of 1969. Other rulings issued by the Inter-American Court condemned Colombia, Guatemala (for several cases including the call of the &quot;street children&quot;), Peru, and Bolivia.

=== Situation in Europe and resolutions of 1993 and 1995 ===
In Europe, the European Court of Human Rights, established in 1959, in accordance with article 38 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of 1950, became a single permanent and binding court for all the Member States of the Council of Europe. Although the European Convention does not contain any express prohibition of the practice of enforced disappearance, the Court dealt with several cases of disappearance in 1993 in the context of the conflict between the Turkish security forces and members or supporters of the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) from the Kurdish region to the southeast of Turkey.

Another body providing the basis for the legal definition of the crime of enforced disappearance was the Human Rights Chamber for Bosnia and Herzegovina, a human rights tribunal established under Annex 6 of the Dayton Peace Agreement of 14 December 1995 which, although it was declared incompetent by ratione temporis to deal with the majority of the 20,000 cases reported, it issued a number of sentences against the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which compensated several families of disappeared persons.

=== Towards the 1992 International Convention ===
In parallel with the resolutions of the international organizations, several non-governmental organizations drafted projects for an international convention. In 1981, the &quot;Institute des droits de l&#x27;homme du Barreau de Paris&quot; (Institute of Human Rights of the Paris Law School) organized a high-level symposium to promote an international convention on disappearances, followed by several draft declarations and conventions proposed by the Argentine League for Human Rights, FEDEFAM at the annual congress of Peru in 1982 or the &quot;Colectivo de Abogados José Alvear Restrepo&quot; from Bogotá in 1988.

In that same year, the French expert in the then Sub-commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, Louis Joinet, prepared the draft text to be adopted in 1992 by the General Assembly with the title Declaration on the Protection of All Persons Against enforced disappearances. The definition presented was based on the one traditionally used by the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances. Although the Declaration included as the primary obligation of States to enact specific criminal legislation, unlike the Convention against Torture, the principle of universal jurisdiction was not established nor was it agreed that the provisions of the Declaration and the recommendations of the Working Group were legally binding so that only a few states took concrete steps to comply with them.

The United Nations Declaration, despite its shortcomings, served to awaken the regional project for the American continent commissioned by the OAS General Assembly in 1987, which, although drafted by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in 1988, was subjected to lengthy discussions and modifications that resulted in their stagnation. In June 1994, the OAS General Assembly finally approved the Inter-American Convention on the Forced Disappearance of Persons, which would be the first legally binding instrument on the subject, and entered into force on 28 March 1996, after its ratification by eight countries: Argentina, Panama, Uruguay, Costa Rica, Paraguay, Venezuela, Bolivia and Guatemala.

In view of the meager success of the United Nations Declaration, a non-binding instrument that could only marginally influence the practice of enforced disappearances, a number of non-governmental organizations and several experts proposed strengthening protection against disappearances, adopting a convention within the framework of the United Nations. This was followed by the deliberations of the 1981 Paris Colloquium submitted by Louis Joinet in the form of a draft subcommittee in August 1988. Several governments, international organizations and non-governmental organizations responded to the invitation of Secretary-General Kofi Annan to provide comments and observations to the project.

=== The 2006 International Convention ===
On 20 December 2006, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the text of the International Convention on the Forced Disappearance of Persons after more than 25 years of development and was signed in Paris on 6 February 2007 at a ceremony to which representatives of the 53 first signatory countries attended and in which 20 of them immediately ratified it. On 19 April 2007, the Commission on Human Rights updated the list of countries that ratified the convention, which included 59 nations.

== Report of the UN (1980–2009) ==
Since the establishment of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (CHR) in 1980, the crime of enforced disappearance has proved to be a global problem, affecting many countries on five continents. It is the subject of a special follow-up by the HRC which regularly publishes reports on its complaint and situation, as well as the response and action of the governments concerned.

The report of the 2009 Working Group recorded a total of 53,232 cases transmitted by the Working Group to Governments since their inception in 1980 and affecting 82 states. The number of cases that are still under study due to lack of clarification, closed or discontinuous cases amounts to 42,600. Since 2004 the Working Group had clarified 1,776 cases. In the previous report of 2007, the number of cases had been 51,531 and affected 79 countries. Many of the countries in the cases are affected internally by violent conflicts, while in other countries the practice of repressive policies towards political opponents is denounced. In other countries, generally in the western and European hemispheres, there are still historical cases that remain unresolved and constitute permanent crimes.

In the official UN report of 2009, of the 82 countries where the cases of missing persons were identified, the largest number (more than 1000) transmitted were: Iraq (16,544), Sri Lanka (12,226), Argentina (3,449), Guatemala (3,155), Peru (3,009), Algeria (2,939), El Salvador (2,661) and Colombia (1,235). Other countries with numerous cases under denunciation (between 1000 and 100) are: Chile (907), China (116), Congo (114), Ethiopia (119), Philippines (780), Honduras (207), India (430), Indonesia (165), Iran (532), Lebanon (320), Morocco (268), Mexico (392), Nepal (672), Nicaragua (234), Russian Federation (478), Sudan, Yemen (155) and East Timor (504).

==Examples==
===Algeria===
During the Algerian Civil War, which began in 1992 as militant Islamist guerrillas attacked the military government that had annulled an Islamic Salvation Front victory, thousands of people were forcibly disappeared. Disappearances continued up to the late 1990s, but thereafter dropped off sharply with the decline in violence in 1997. Some of the disappeared were kidnapped or killed by the guerrillas but others are presumed to have been taken by state security forces under Mohamed Mediène. This latter group has become the most controversial. Their exact numbers remain disputed, but the government has acknowledged a figure of just over 6,000 disappeared, now presumed dead. The war claimed a total toll of 150,000–200,000 lives.

In 2005 a controversial amnesty law was approved in a referendum. It granted financial compensation to families of the &quot;disappeared&quot;, but also effectively ended the police investigations into the crimes.

===Argentina===
During Argentina&#x27;s Dirty War and Operation Condor, many alleged political dissidents were abducted or illegally detained and kept in clandestine detention centers such as Navy Petty-Officers School or &quot;ESMA&quot;, where they were questioned, tortured, and almost always killed. There were about 500 clandestine detention camps, including those of Garaje Azopardo and Orletti. These places of torture, located mostly in Buenos Aires, contributed up to 30,000 desaparecidos, or disappeared persons, to the overall count in the Dirty War. The victims would be shipped to places like a garage or basement and tortured for multiple days. Many of the disappeared were people who were considered to be a political or ideological threat to the military junta.

The Argentine military justified torture to obtain intelligence and saw the disappearances as a way to curb political dissidence. Abducted pregnant women were kept captive until they gave birth, then often killed. It is estimated that 500 babies born in this way were given for informal adoption to families with close ties to the military.

Eventually, many of the captives were heavily drugged and loaded onto aircraft, from which they were thrown alive while in flight over the Atlantic Ocean in &quot;death flights&quot; (&quot;vuelos de la muerte&quot;) to leave no trace of their death. Without any bodies, the government could deny any knowledge of their whereabouts and accusations that they had been killed. The forced disappearances were the military junta&#x27;s attempt to silence the opposition and break the determination of the guerrillas. Missing people who are presumed to have been murdered in this and other ways are today referred to as &quot;the disappeared&quot; (&quot;los desaparecidos&quot;).

Activist groups Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo and Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo were formed in 1977 by mothers and grandmothers of the &quot;disappeared&quot; victims of the dictatorship to find the children born in captivity during the Dirty War, and later to determine the culprits of crimes against humanity and promote their trial and sentencing. Some 500 children are estimated to have been illegally given for adoption; 120 cases had been confirmed by DNA tests .

The term &quot;desaparecidos&quot; was used by &quot;de facto&quot; President General Jorge Rafael Videla, who said in a press conference &quot;They are just that… &quot;desaparecidos&quot;. They are not alive, neither are they dead. They are just missing&quot;. It is thought that between 1976 and 1983 in Argentina, up to 30,000 people (8,960 named cases, according to the official report by the CONADEP) were killed and in many cases disappeared. In an originally classified cable first published by John Dinges in 2004, the Argentine 601st Intelligence Battalion, which started counting victims in 1975, in mid-1978 estimated that 22,000 persons had been killed or &quot;disappeared&quot;.

===Bangladesh===

Since 2010, under the Awami League regime, at least 500 people – most of whom are opposition leaders and activists – have been declared disappeared in Bangladesh by the state security forces. According to the report of a domestic human rights organization, 82 people have disappeared from January to September 2014. After the disappearances, at least 39 of the victims were found dead while others remained missing. On 25 June 2010, an opposition leader Chowdhury Alam was arrested by the state police and remained missing since then. His abduction was later denied by the law enforcing agencies. On 17 April 2012, another prominent leader, Ilyas Ali, of the main opposition parties Bangladesh Nationalist Party disappeared by unknown armed personnel. The incident received much media coverage. Before the controversial national election of 2014, at least 19 opposition men were picked up by security forces. The incidents of enforced disappearances were condemned by both domestic and international human rights organizations. Despite the demands for the government initiatives to probe such disappearances, investigations into such cases were absent.

===Belarus===
In 1999 opposition leaders Yury Zacharanka and Viktar Hanchar, as well as his business associate Anatol Krasouski, disappeared. Hanchar and Krasouski disappeared the same day of a broadcast on state television in which President Alexander Lukashenko ordered the chiefs of his security services to crack down on &quot;opposition scum&quot;. Although the State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus (KGB) had had them under constant surveillance, the official investigation announced that the case could not be solved. The investigation of the disappearance of journalist Dzmitry Zavadski in 2000 has also yielded no results. Copies of a report by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, which linked senior Belarusian officials to the cases of disappearances, were confiscated.

In December 2019, Deutsche Welle published a documentary film in which Yury Garavski, a former member of a special unit of the Belarusian Ministry of Internal Affairs, confirmed that it was his unit which had arrested, taken away, and murdered Zecharanka and that they later did the same with Viktar Hanchar and Anatol Krassouski.

===Chile===

Almost immediately after the Chilean military&#x27;s seizure of power on 11 September 1973, the military junta led by the then commander-in-chief Augusto Pinochet banned all the leftist parties that had constituted the democratically elected president Salvador Allende&#x27;s UP coalition. All other parties were placed in &quot;indefinite recess&quot;, and later banned outright. The regime&#x27;s violence was directed not only against dissidents, but also against their families and other civilians.

The Rettig Report concluded 2,279 persons who disappeared during the military dictatorship were killed for political reasons or as a result of political violence, and approximately 31,947 were tortured according to the later Valech Report, while 1,312 were exiled. The latter were chased all over the world by the intelligence agencies. In Latin America, this was made under the auspices of Operation Condor, a combined operation between the intelligence agencies of various South American countries, assisted by a United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) communication base in Panama. Pinochet justified these operations as being necessary in order to save the country from communism.

Some political scientists have ascribed the relative bloodiness of the coup to the stability of the existing democratic system, which required extreme action to overturn. Some of the most famous cases of human rights violations occurred during the early period: in October 1973, at least 70 people were killed throughout the country by the Caravan of Death. Charles Horman, a journalist from the US, &quot;disappeared&quot;, as did Víctor Olea Alegría, a member of the Socialist Party, and many others, in 1973. Mathematician Boris Weisfeiler is thought to have disappeared near Colonia Dignidad, a German colony founded by Nazi Christian minister Paul Schäfer in Parral, which was used as a detention center by the DINA, the secret police.
Furthermore, many other important officials of Allende&#x27;s government were tracked down by the Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional (DINA) during Operation Condor. Thus, General Carlos Prats, Pinochet&#x27;s predecessor and army commander under Allende, who had resigned rather than support the moves against Allende&#x27;s government, was assassinated by a car bomb in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1974. A year later, the deaths of 119 opponents abroad were claimed as the product of infighting between Marxist factions, the DINA setting up a disinformation campaign to propagate this thesis, Operation Colombo. The campaign was legitimized and supported by the leading newspaper in Chile, &quot;El Mercurio&quot;.

Other prominent victims of Operation Condor included, among thousands of less famous persons, Juan José Torres, the former President of Bolivia, assassinated in Buenos Aires on 2 June 1976; Carmelo Soria, a UN diplomat working for the CEPAL, assassinated in July 1976; and Orlando Letelier, a former Chilean ambassador to the United States and minister in Allende&#x27;s cabinet, assassinated after his release from internment and exile in Washington D.C. by a car bomb on 21 September 1976. This led to strained relations with the US and to the extradition of Michael Townley, a US citizen who worked for the DINA and had organized Letelier&#x27;s assassination. Other targeted victims, who survived assassination attempts, included Christian-Democrat politician Bernardo Leighton, who barely escaped an assassination attempt in Rome in 1975 by the Italian neo-fascist terrorist Stefano delle Chiaie (the assassination attempt seriously injured Leighton and his wife, Anita Fresno, leaving her permanently disabled); Carlos Altamirano, the leader of the Chilean Socialist Party, targeted for murder in 1975 by Pinochet; Volodia Teitelboim, writer and member of the Communist Party; Pascal Allende, the nephew of Salvador Allende and president of the MIR, who escaped an assassination attempt in Costa Rica in March 1976; and US Congressman Edward Koch, who received death threats and was the potential assassination target by DINA and Uruguayan intelligence officers for his denunciation of Operation Condor. Furthermore, according to current investigations, Eduardo Frei Montalva, the Christian Democrat President of Chile from 1964 to 1970, may have been poisoned in 1982 by a toxin produced by DINA biochemist Eugenio Berrios. Berríos himself is reputed to having been assassinated by Chilean intelligence in Uruguay, after being spirited away to said country in the early 1990s.

Protests continued, however, during the 1980s, leading to several scandals. In March 1985, the gruesome murder of three Communist Party of Chile (PCC) members led to the resignation of César Mendoza, head of the Chilean gendarmerie the Carabineros de Chile and member of the &quot;junta&quot; since its formation. During a 1986 protest against Pinochet, 21-year-old American photographer Rodrigo Rojas DeNegri and 18-year-old student Carmen Gloria Quintana were burnt alive, killing Rojas.

In August 1989, Marcelo Barrios Andres, a 21-year-old member of the Manuel Rodríguez Patriotic Front (FPMR, the armed wing of the PCC, created in 1983, which had attempted to assassinate Pinochet on 7 September 1986), was assassinated by a group of military personnel who were supposed to arrest him on orders of Valparaíso&#x27;s public prosecutor. However, they simply summarily executed him; this case was included in the Rettig Report. Among the killed and disappeared during the military dictatorship were 440 MIR guerrillas.

===China===

On 17 May 1995 Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, along with his family, was taken into custody by the Chinese government shortly after being identified as the 11th Panchen Lama by the 14th (and current) Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso. In his place, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) appointed Gyaincain Norbu to act as the Panchen Lama, though Norbu is not recognized as the Panchen Lama in Tibet or elsewhere (beyond China). Nyima has not been seen in public since he was taken into custody, though the Chinese government claims that he is alive and well, but that he &quot;does not wish to be disturbed&quot;. Enforced disappearances of human rights lawyers and defenders have increased under CCP general secretary Xi Jinping&#x27;s rule since 2013. New laws grant the police unrestricted power to hold detainees secretly for indefinite periods.

Gao Zhisheng, a Chinese Christian human rights attorney and dissident known for defending activists and religious minorities, has been subject to enforced disappearance since August 2017. Previously, in February 2009, Chinese security agents took him into custody, and his whereabouts remained unknown until March 2010, when he resurfaced and confirmed that he had been sentenced and tortured. In April 2010, his family reported him missing again. More than a year and a half later, in December 2011, CCP media Xinhua reported that he had been sentenced to three years in prison. After his release in August 2014, he was placed under house arrest for three more years until August 13, 2017, when he disappeared again. There has been no information from the Chinese government about his whereabouts. 

====Hong Kong====

Lee Bo (李波) was a dual citizen of Hong Kong and the United Kingdom. On 30 December 2015 evening, Lee disappeared. His wife shortly received a phone call from him (with caller ID from Shenzhen) in which he explained in Mandarin (not Cantonese in which they would usually converse) he had to assist with some investigation for a while, and he could not be home nor provide more information for a while.

Lee was a co-owner of the Causeway Bay Books and the Might Current publishing house that specialized in selling books concerning the political gossip and other lurid subjects of the Chinese Communist Party leaders. These books were banned from mainland China but were popular among the tourists visiting Hong Kong. Towards the end of October 2015, four co-owners and managers of the bookstore and publisher, Gui Minhai, Lui Bo (呂波), Cheung Jiping (張志平), and Lam Wing-kei, went missing from Thailand and mainland China, believed to be detained by the Central Case Examination Group. Lee had expressed concern for his safety in various interviews after his colleagues disappeared and intentionally left all travel documents at home (confirmed by his wife after his disappearance).

Lee&#x27;s disappearance drew wide attention. The disappearance of all five men were speculated to be connected to some upcoming news releases that would have embarrassed the Chinese Communist Party. Hong Kong citizens, under one-country two-systems, are supposedly to be protected by the Basic Law in that PRC law enforcement cannot operate in the special administrative region (SAR). Lee&#x27;s disappearance was considered a threat to and most importantly the many rights, freedom, and protection promised to Hong Kong citizens often denied in mainland China.

===Colombia===

In 2009, Colombian prosecutors reported that an estimated 28,000 people have disappeared due to paramilitary and guerrilla groups during the nation&#x27;s ongoing internal conflict. In 2008, the corpses of 300 victims were identified and 600 more during the following year. According to Colombian officials, it will take many years before all the bodies that have been recovered are identified.

=== East Timor ===

During the Indonesian occupation of East Timor, the Indonesian Army commonly utilized enforced disappearances to instill fear in the East Timorese population. 

Three notable incidents of mass enforced disappearances were on 8 December 1975 in Colmera, Dili, where 13 Chinese workers disappeared after having been last seen in Indonesian custody digging on the beach, and in December 1979 at Matebian where 48 men disappeared after being falsely accused of being Fretilin members, from April to September 1999 over 15 people disappeared during the Lospalos case.

=== Egypt ===
Enforced disappearance has been employed by the Egyptian authorities under the regime of Abdel Fattah el-Sisi as a key instrument to terrify, interrogate and torture opponents of El-Sisi under the guise of counter-terrorism efforts. Hundreds of people forcibly disappeared including political activists, protesters, women and children. Around three to four people are seized per day by the heavily armed security forces led by NSA officers who usually storm their homes, detain many of them, blindfold and handcuff them for months.

Between 1 August 2016 and mid-August 2017, 378 individuals have been forcibly disappeared. 291 people have been located, while the rest are still forcibly disappeared. Of the 52 children who disappeared in 2017, three were extrajudicially killed.

In 2020, the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) released a five-year report on forced disappearances, revealing that the country documented 2,723 such cases since August 2015.

In March 2021, Amnesty International condemned Egyptian authorities for the forced disappearance of a husband and wife, Omar Abdelhamid Abu el-Naga and Manar Adel Abu el-Naga, along with their one-year-old child, al-Baraa, after being arrested on 9 March 2019. On 20 February 2021, the wife was questioned about having links to a terrorist group before the Supreme State Security Prosecution (SSSP). She was detained for 15 days pending further investigations at al-Qanater women&#x27;s prison, while her almost 3-year-old son was handed over to relatives. However, Omar continued to be subjected to enforced disappearance. Amnesty International urged Egypt to conduct an effective investigation into the disappearance of the family, saying, &quot;Seizing a young mother with her one-year-old baby and confining them in a room for 23 months outside the protection of the law and with no contact with the outside world show that Egyptian authorities&#x27; ongoing campaign to stamp out dissent and instill fear has reached a new level of brutality.&quot;

===El Salvador===
According to the UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, enforced disappearances were systematically carried out in El Salvador both prior to (starting in 1978) and during the Salvadoran Civil War. Salvadoran non-governmental organizations estimate that more than 8,000 disappearances occurred, and in the Report of the Commission on the Truth for El Salvador, it is estimated that more than 5,500 persons may have been the victims of enforced disappearance. The Office of the Procurator for the Protection of Human Rights of El Salvador claims that:
Enforced disappearances of children occurred, which is thought to have been &quot;part of a deliberate strategy within the violence institutionalized by the State during the period of conflict&quot;.

===Equatorial Guinea===
According to the UN Human Rights Council Mission to Equatorial Guinea, agents of the Equatorial Guinean Government have been responsible for abducting refugees from other countries in the region and holding them in secret detention. For example, in January 2010 four men were abducted from Benin by Equatorial Guinean security forces, held in secret detention, subjected to torture, and executed in August 2010 immediately after being convicted by a military court.

===Germany===
During World War II, Nazi Germany set up secret police forces, including branches of the Gestapo in occupied countries, to hunt down known or suspected dissidents or partisans. This tactic was given the name &quot;Nacht und Nebel&quot; (&quot;Night and Fog&quot;), to describe those who disappeared after being arrested by Nazi forces without any warning. The Nazis applied this policy against political opponents within Germany as well as against the resistance in occupied Europe. Most victims were killed on the spot, or sent to concentration camps, with the full expectation that they would then be killed.

===Guatemala===

Guatemala was one of the first countries where people were disappeared as a generalized practice of terror against a civilian population. Forced disappearances was widely practiced by the United States-backed military government of Guatemala during the 36-year Guatemalan Civil War. An estimated 40,000 to 50,000 individuals were disappeared by the Guatemalan military and security forces between 1954 and 1996. The tactic of disappearance first saw widespread use in Guatemala during the mid-1960s, as government repression became widespread when the military adopted harsher counterinsurgency measures. The first documented case of forced disappearance by the government in Guatemala occurred in March 1966, when thirty Guatemalan Party of Labour associates were kidnapped, tortured and killed by the security forces; their bodies were put in sacks and dumped at sea from helicopters. This was one of the first major instances of forced disappearance in Latin American history. When law students at the University of San Carlos used legal measures (such as &quot;habeas corpus&quot; petitions) to require the government to present the detainees at court, some of the students were &quot;disappeared&quot; in turn.

===India===
Ensaaf, a nonprofit organization working to end impunity and achieve justice for mass state crimes in India, with a focus on Punjab, released a report in January 2009, in collaboration with the Benetech Human Rights Data Analysis Group (HRDAG), claiming &quot;verifiable quantitative&quot; findings on mass disappearances and extrajudicial executions in the Indian state of Punjab. It claims that in conflict-afflicted states like Punjab, Indian security forces have perpetrated gross human rights violations with impunity. The report by Ensaaf and HRDAG, &quot;Violent Deaths and Enforced Disappearances During the Counterinsurgency in Punjab, India&quot;, presents empirical findings suggesting that the intensification of counterinsurgency operations in Punjab in the 1980s to 1990s was accompanied by a shift in state violence from targeted lethal human rights violations to systematic enforced disappearances and extrajudicial executions, accompanied by mass &quot;illegal cremations&quot;. Furthermore, there is key evidence suggesting security forces tortured, executed, and disappeared tens of thousands of people in Punjab from 1984 to 1995.

In 2011, the Jammu and Kashmir State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) recommended the identification of 2,156 people buried in unmarked graves in north Kashmir. The graves were found in dozens of villages on the Indian side of the Line of Control, the border that has divided India and Pakistan since 1972. According to a report published by the commission, many of the bodies were likely to be those of civilians who disappeared more than a decade earlier in a brutal insurgency. &quot;There is every probability that these unidentified dead bodies buried in various unmarked graves at 38 places of North Kashmir may contain the dead bodies of enforced disappearances&quot;, the report stated.

===Indonesia===

According to historian John Roosa, the first example of forced disappearances being used as a weapon of terror in Asia occurred during the Indonesian mass killings of 1965–66.

===Iraq===

At least tens of thousands of people disappeared under the regime of Saddam Hussein, many of them during Operation Anfal.

On 15 December 2019, two Iraqi activists and friends – Salman Khairallah Salman and Omar al-Amri – disappeared amidst ongoing protests in Baghdad. The family and friends of the two fear the disappearance of more people following United Nations&#x27; warning to security forces and other unnamed militia groups, of carrying out a campaign of kidnapping and &#x27;deliberate killings&#x27; in Iraq.

===Iran===
Following the Iran student riots in 1999, more than 70 students disappeared. In addition to an estimated 1,200–1,400 detained, the &quot;whereabouts and condition&quot; of five students named by Human Rights Watch remain unknown. The United Nations has also reported other disappearances. Many groups, from teacher unions to women&#x27;s rights activists, have been targeted by forced disappearances. Dissident writers have been the target of disappearances, as have members of religious minorities, such as the Baháʼí Faith following the Iranian Revolution. Examples include Muhammad Movahhed and Ali Murad Davudi.

===Mexico===

During Mexico&#x27;s Dirty War in the 1970s, thousands of suspected guerrillas, leftists, and human rights defenders disappeared, although the exact number is unclear. During the 1970s, around 470 people were disappeared in the municipality of Atoyac de Álvarez alone.

According to the National Commission of Human Rights (CNDH), between 2006 and 2011, 5,397 people have disappeared. Of these, 3,457 are men, 1,885 are women, but there is no information about the other 55. Usually, the forced disappearances occur in groups and are of people not related to the drug war which was started by President Felipe Calderón in 2006. The main difference from the kidnappings is that usually there is no ransom asked for the disappeared.

Over 73,000 people in Mexico have been reported as disappeared in 2020, according to the Secretaría de Gobernación of Mexico.

===Morocco / Western Sahara===

Several Moroccan Army personnel suspected of being implicated in the 1970s coups against King Hassan II were held in secret detention camps such as Tazmamart, where some of them died due to poor conditions or lack of medical treatment. The most famous case of forced disappearance in Morocco is that of political dissident Mehdi Ben Barka, who disappeared in obscure circumstances in France in 1965.
In February 2007, Morocco signed an international convention protecting people against forced disappearance.
In October 2007, Spanish judge Baltasar Garzón declared the competence of the Spanish jurisdiction in the Spanish-Sahrawi disappearances between 1976 and 1987 in Western Sahara (mostly controlled by Morocco). There have been charges brought against some Moroccan military heads, some of them currently in power , such as the head of Morocco&#x27;s armed forces, General Housni Benslimane, charged for the detention and disappearance campaign of Smara in 1976. Garzón&#x27;s successor, Judge Pablo Ruz, reopened the case in November 2010.

=== Myanmar ===
During the ongoing Rohingya genocide, Tatmadaw forces have systematically carried out the disappearance and torture of Rohingya people.

Following the 2021 military coup and ongoing opposition movement, thousands of people have been abducted by Myanmar security forces, including politicians, election officials, journalists, activists, and protesters. According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, thousands of people suspected of participation in anti-coup demonstrations have been disappeared through nighttime raids. According to UNICEF, there are over 1,000 cases of children who have been arbitrarily arrested and detained, many without access to lawyers or their families.

===North Korea===

In North Korea, forced disappearances of nationals are characterized by detention without contact or explanation to the families of the detained. Foreign citizens, many of whom are ethnic Koreans who were living in South Korea and Japan, have been disappeared after willfully traveling to North Korea or being abducted abroad.

=== Northern Ireland and Ireland ===

&quot;The Disappeared&quot; is the name given to eighteen people abducted and killed by the Provisional IRA, the Irish National Liberation Army, and other Irish Republican organizations during the Troubles.

The Independent Commission for the Location of Victims&#x27; Remains, established in 1999, is the body responsible for locating the disappeared.

In 1999, the IRA admitted to killing nine of the disappeared and gave information on the location of these bodies, but only three bodies were recovered on that occasion, one of which had already been exhumed and placed in a coffin. The best-known case was that of Jean McConville, a Belfast mother of 10, widowed a few months before she disappeared, who the IRA claimed was an informer. The search for her remains was abandoned in 1999, but her body was discovered in 2003, a mile from where the IRA had indicated, by a family out on a walk. Since then seven more victims have been found—one in 2008, three in 2010, one in 2014, two in 2015 and one in 2017. , three have yet to be located.

=== Qatar ===
Women&#x27;s rights activist Noof Al Maadeed who returned to Qatar in 2021 after voluntarily renouncing her asylum claim in the UK was last seen on the 13th of October 2021, weeks after arrival in Doha. Her last communication with the outside world was in March 2023 through 4 social media posts on Twitter, now deleted. Since then her whereabouts are unknown and the Qatari authorities have not been able to confirm her status, despite pressure from human rights organizations.

===Pakistan===

In Pakistan, the systematic practice of enforced disappearance in Pakistan originated in the era of military dictator General Pervez Musharraf. The extent of forced disappearances increased after the US invasion of Afghanistan in 2001.Enforced disappearances constitute a significant human rights issue in Pakistan, with the reported alleged cases exceeding 7,000 according to Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances however about 5000 of these cases have been resolved. 

=== Palestine ===
In August 2015, four members of Hamas Armed wing were abducted in Sinai, Egypt. They were abducted by unidentified gunmen according to the Egyptian security officials. The abducted men were in a bus carrying fifty of the Palestinians from Rafah, to Cairo airport.

Hamas confirmed that the four abducted Palestinians were heading to Cairo. The spokesman of the interior ministry Iyad al Bazom said &quot;We urge the Egyptian interior ministry to secure the lives of the kidnapped passengers and free them&quot;. Until the moment, no group claimed responsibility for the kidnappings.

===Philippines===
Estimates vary for the number of victims of enforced disappearances in the Philippines. The William S. Richardson School of Law Library at the University of Hawaii places the number of the victims of enforced disappearances under the rule of Ferdinand Marcos at 783. During the Marcos dictatorship, many people who went missing were allegedly tortured, abducted, and killed by policemen.

Charlie del Rosario was an activist and professor at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines, and was last seen on the night of 19 March 1971 while putting up posters for the national congress of the Movement for a Democratic Philippines (MDP), inside the PCC Lepanto compound. The family suspected the Philippine government military in his abduction. Del Rosario, who was never seen nor heard from since, is considered the first victim of enforced disappearance during the Marcos regime.

The Southern Tagalog 10 was a group of activists working in Central Luzon during Marcos&#x27; martial law in the Philippines. These 10 university students and professors were abducted and made to disappear during martial law. Three of them were later killed and &quot;surfaced&quot; by suspected agents of the state. The rest remain missing to this day.

===Romania===

During the communist regime of Nicolae Ceaușescu, it is claimed that forced disappearances occurred. For example, during the strikes of 1977 and 1987 in Romania, leading persons involved in the strikes are alleged to have been &quot;disappeared&quot;.

===Russia===
Russian rights groups estimate there have been about 5,000 forced disappearances in Chechnya since 1999. Most of them are believed to be buried in several dozen mass graves.

The Russian government failed to pursue any accountability process for human rights abuses committed during the course of the conflict in Chechnya. Unable to secure justice domestically, hundreds of victims of abuse have filed applications with the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). In March 2005 the court issued the first rulings on Chechnya, finding the Russian government guilty of violating the right to life and the prohibition of torture with respect to civilians who had died or been forcibly disappeared at the hands of Russia&#x27;s federal troops.

Since the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, Amnesty International has documented several enforced disappearances of ethnic Crimean Tatars, none of which has been effectively investigated. On 24 May 2014 Ervin Ibragimov, a former member of the Bakhchysarai Town Council and a member of the World Congress of Crimean Tatars went missing. CCTV footage from a camera at a nearby shop captured a group of men stopping Ibragimov, speaking with him briefly before forcing him into their van. According to the Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group, Russian authorities refused to investigate the disappearance of Ibragimov.

===South Korea===

Forced disappearances and extrajudicial killings were openly used by the First Republic of Korea during the Jeju uprising, during the Korea War, and as part of the Bodo league massacre during the Korean war. A taboo to speak about these incidents lasted until the end of authoritarian rule in South Korea in 1993. 

During the persecution of alleged leftist sympathizers during the war, ordinary civilians under suspicion were rounded up and grouped into four groups A, B, C and D. Groups C and D were shot immediately and buried in unmarked mass graves. A and B were drafted and/or sent on to death marches or held in Bodo League reeducation facilities.

Survivors and family members of extrajudicially killed and disappeared or re-educated persons faced death and forced disappearance if they talked about these incidences during the period of authoritarian rule.

Many of the forced disappearances and accidentally discovered mass graves during authoritarian rule were falsely blamed on North Koreans or the People&#x27;s Liberation Army of China. South Korea is currently involved in shedding light on some of these incidences using the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Some of the forced disappearance victims include high-profile politicians such as late South Korean President and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Kim Dae-jung, who was forcefully disappeared from his Tokyo hotel room. His attempted murder by throwing him with weights on his legs overboard into the open sea was coordinated by the National Intelligence Service and the Toa-kai yakuza syndicate.

===Spain===

The United Nations working group for Human Rights reported in 2013 that during the period between the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) and the end of Francisco Franco&#x27;s dictatorship (1939–1975), an estimated 114,226 people &quot;disappeared&quot; by being forcibly taken away by either official or unofficial armed groups, where they were secretly murdered and later buried in undisclosed locations. The report also mentions the systematic kidnapping and &quot;stealing&quot; of approximately 30,960 children and newborns, which continued even after the end of the dictatorship during the 1970s and 1980s.

The disappearances include whole Republican military units, such as the 221st Mixed Brigade. The families of the deceased soldiers speculate that the bodies of the disappeared members of this unit may have ended up in unknown mass graves.

It was not until 2008 that the first attempt was made to take the issue to court, with that attempt failing and with the judge in charge of the process, Baltasar Garzón, being himself impeached and subsequently disqualified. The UN&#x27;s Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances has openly stated that the Spanish Government is failing to its duties in these matters. the Spanish authorities keep actively hampering the investigation into forced disappearances that took place during and after the civil war.

==== Estimate of the &quot;Desaparecidos del franquismo&quot; ====
Identification and systematic analysis of the bones of victims in mass graves have not yet, to date, been undertaken by any government of the current Spanish democracy (since 1977).

According to &quot;La Nueva España&quot; newspaper, the data of people buried in mass graves brought before the &quot;Audiencia Nacional&quot; court on 16 October 2008 are the following:

===Sri Lanka===
Since 1980, 12,000 Sri Lankans have gone missing after being detained by security forces. More than 55,000 people have been killed in the past 27 years. The figures are still lower than the then-current Sri Lankan government&#x27;s 2009 estimate of 17,000 people missing, which was made after it came to power with a commitment to correct the human rights issues.

In 2003, the International Red Cross (ICRC) restarted investigations into the disappearance of 11,000 people during Sri Lanka&#x27;s civil war.

On 29 May 2009, the British newspaper &quot;The Times&quot; acquired confidential U.N. documents that record nearly 7,000 civilian deaths in the no-fire zone up to the end of April. The toll then surged, the paper quoted unidentified U.N. sources as saying, with an average of 1,000 civilians killed each day until 19 May, when the government declared victory over the Tamil Tiger rebels. That means the final death toll is more than 20,000, &quot;The Times&quot; said. &quot;Higher&quot;, a U.N. source told the paper. &quot;Keep going.&quot; The United Nations has previously said 7,000 civilians were killed in fighting between January and May. A top Sri Lankan official called the 20,000-figure unfounded. Gordon Weiss, a U.N. spokesman in Sri Lanka, told CNN that a large number of civilians were killed, though he did not confirm the 20,000 figure.

Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has accused Sri Lanka of &quot;causing untold suffering&quot;.

===Syria===

According to Human Rights Watch, no fewer than 17,000 people disappeared during Hafez al-Assad&#x27;s 30-year rule.

Bashar al-Assad took his father&#x27;s policy further and considered any voice questioning anything about Syria&#x27;s political, economic, social, or otherwise policies should be monitored and when needed, detained and accused of weakening national empathy. A recent case is Tal Mallohi, a 19-year-old blogger summoned for interrogation on 27 December 2009, who was released over 4 years later.

In November 2015, Amnesty International released a report accusing the Syrian government and its allied militants of kidnapping tens of thousands of people since 2011. The international organization said that such acts represent a crime against humanity. The organization called Syrian government to allow the entry of the UN&#x27;s international committee of inquiry observers in order to access information related to the detainees. Amnesty International has claimed that more than 65,000 people, mostly civilians, have been forcibly disappeared between March 2011 and August 2015. The Syrian government, on the other hand, has repeatedly denied reports accusing it of committing crimes against humanity.

===Thailand===

In 2013, the &quot;Bangkok Post&quot; reported that Police General Vasit Dejkunjorn, founder of the Thai Spring movement, told a seminar that forced disappearance is a tool which corrupt state power uses to eliminate individuals deemed a threat.

According to Amnesty Thailand, at least 59 human-rights defenders have been victims of forced disappearance between 1998 and 2018. Attorney Somchai Neelapaijit, Karen activist Pholachi &quot;Billy&quot; Rakchongcharoen, and activist Den Khamlae are among those who disappeared.

Haji Sulong, a reformist and a separatist disappeared in 1954. He sought for greater recognition of the &quot;Jawi&quot; community in Patani and Tanong Po-arn. The Thai labour union leader who disappeared following the 1991 Thai coup d&#x27;état by National Peace Keeping Council against the elected government.

On 12 March 2004, Somchai Neelapaijit, a well-known Thai Muslim activist lawyer in the kingdom&#x27;s southern region, was kidnapped by Thai police and has since disappeared. Officially listed as a disappeared person, his presumed widow, Ankhana Neelapaichit, has been seeking justice for her husband since Somchai went missing. On 11 March 2009, Mrs Neelapaichit was part of a special panel at the Foreign Correspondents&#x27; Club of Thailand to commemorate her husband&#x27;s disappearance and to keep attention focused on the case and on human rights abuses in Thailand.

According to the legal assistance group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights, at least 86 Thais left Thailand seeking asylum abroad following the military takeover in May 2014. Among them are the four members of the Thai band Fai Yen, some of whose songs mock the monarchy, a serious offense in Thailand. The band announced on social media that its members feared for their lives after &quot;many trusted people told us that the Thai military will come to kill us.&quot; All of those who disappeared in late-2018 and early-2019 were accused by Thai authorities of anti-monarchical activity.

Two Thai activists went missing while living in exile in Vientiane, Laos: Itthipol Sukpaen, who vanished in June 2016; and Wuthipong &quot;Ko Tee&quot; Kochathamakun, who disappeared from his residence in July 2017. Eyewitnesses said Wuthipong was abducted by a group of Thai-speaking men dressed in black.

In December 2018, Surachai Danwattananusorn, a Thai political exile, and two aides went missing from their home in Vientiane, Laos. The two aides were later found murdered. Some in the Thai media see the forced disappearances and murders as a warning to anti-monarchists. , Surachai remains missing. The number of &quot;disappeared&quot; Thai activists exiled in Laos may be as high as five since 2015.

Siam Theerawut, Chucheep Chivasut, and Kritsana Thapthai, three Thai anti-monarchy activists, went missing on 8 May 2019, when they are thought to have been extradited to Thailand from Vietnam after they attempted to enter the country with counterfeit Indonesian passports. The trio are wanted in Thailand for insulting the monarchy and failing to report when summoned by the junta after the 2014 Thai coup d&#x27;état. Their disappearance passed the one year mark on 8 May 2020 with still no sign of the trio.

Thai pro-democracy activist Wanchalearn Satsaksit was abducted from Phnom Penh, Cambodia on 4 June 2020, which prompted public concern and became a factor behind the 2020 Thai protests.

===Turkey===
Turkish human rights groups accuse the Turkish security forces of being responsible for the disappearance of more than 1,500 Kurdish minority civilians the 1980s and 1990s, in attempts to root out the PKK. Every week on Saturdays since 1995, Saturday Mothers hold silent vigils and sit-in protests to demand that their lost ones to be found and those responsible be brought to justice. Each year Yakay-Der, the Turkish Human Rights Association (İHD) and the International Committee Against Disappearances (ICAD), organise a series of events in Turkey to mark the &quot;Week of Disappeared People&quot;.

In April 2009, state prosecutors in Turkey ordered the excavation of several sites around Turkey believed to hold Kurdish victims of state death squads from the 1980s and 1990s, in response to calls for Turkey&#x27;s security establishment to come clean about past abuses.

In a study published in June 2017 by Sweden-based Stockholm Center for Freedom, 12 individual cases of enforced disappearances in Turkey since 2016 were documented under the emergency rule. The research titled as &quot;Enforced Disappearances in Turkey&quot; claimed that all cases were connected to clandestine elements within Turkish security forces. Turkish authorities were reluctant to investigate the cases despite pleas from family members.

===Ukraine===
During the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War, there have been many cases of forced disappearances in the territory of the disputed Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic (DPR). DPR leader Alexander Zakharchenko said that his forces detained up to five &quot;Ukrainian subversives&quot; each day. It was estimated that about 632 people were under illegal detention by separatist forces on 11 December 2014.

On 2 June 2017 freelance journalist Stanislav Aseyev was abducted. The de facto DPR government first denied knowing his whereabouts, but on 16 July, an agent of the DPR&#x27;s Ministry of State Security confirmed that Aseyev was in their custody and that he is suspected of espionage. Independent media is not allowed to report from DPR-controlled territory.

===United States===

According to Amnesty International (AI), the United States has engaged in forced disappearance of prisoners of war, all captured overseas and never taken to the US, in the course of its War on Terror. AI lists at &quot;least 39 detainees, all of whom are still missing, who are believed to have been held in secret sites run by the United States government overseas.&quot;

The United States Department of Defense kept the identity of the individuals it held in the US Guantanamo Bay Naval Base (&quot;Gitmo&quot;) in Cuba secret, from its opening on 11 January 2002 to 20 April 2006. An official list of the 558 individuals then held in the camp was published on 20 April 2006 in response to a court order from United States District Judge Jed Rakoff. Another list, stated to be of all 759 individuals who had been held in Guantanamo, was published on 20 May 2006.

In 2015, American journalist Spencer Ackerman wrote a series of articles in &quot;The Guardian&quot; on the Homan Square facility in Chicago, comparing it to a CIA black site. Ackerman asserted that the facility was the &quot;scene of secretive work by special police units,&quot; where the &quot;basic constitutional rights&quot; of &quot;poor, black and brown&quot; Chicago city residents were violated. Ackerman asserted that &quot;Chicagoans who end up inside do not appear to have a public, searchable record entered into a database indicating where they are, as happens when someone is booked at a precinct. Lawyers and relatives insist there is no way of finding their whereabouts. Those lawyers who have attempted to gain access to Homan Square are most often turned away, even as their clients remain in custody inside.&quot;

=== Venezuela ===

A report produced by Foro Penal and Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights documents that 200 cases of forced disappearances in 2018 increased to 524 in 2019, attributed to increased protests. The analysis found that the average disappearance lasted just over five days, suggesting the government sought to avoid the scrutiny that might accompany large-scale and long-term detentions.

===Former Yugoslavia===
Thousands of people were subject to forced disappearance during the Yugoslav Wars.

== Enforced disappearances within migration ==
The increasingly perilous journeys of migrants and refugees and the ever more rigid migration policies of states and transnational organizations like the European Union cause a particular risk for migrants to become victims of enforced disappearances. This has been recognized by the UN&#x27;s Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances. Also the UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances recognized the increased risk of enforced disappearances as a result of migration in the Guiding Principles for the Search of Disappeared Persons.

<text>During the Vietnam War, thousands of U.S. aircraft were lost to antiaircraft artillery (AAA), surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), and fighter interceptors (MiG)s. The great majority of U.S. combat losses in all areas of Southeast Asia were to AAA. The Royal Australian Air Force also flew combat and airlift missions in South Vietnam, as did the South Vietnamese Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF). Among fixed-wing aircraft, more F-4 Phantoms were lost than any other type in service with any nation.

The United States lost 578 Ryan Model 147 Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) (554 over Vietnam and 24 over China). More than 400 QH-50C/D UAVs were also lost.

There were about 11,846 U.S helicopters that served in the Vietnam War. The U.S records show 5,607 helicopter losses.

In total, the United States military lost in Vietnam almost 10,000 aircraft (3,744 planes, 5,607 helicopters and about 1,000 UAVs.

South Vietnam lost 1,018 aircraft and helicopters from January 1964 to September 1973. 877 Republic of Vietnam aircraft were captured at war&#x27;s end (1975) Of the 2,750 aircraft and helicopters received by South Vietnam, only about 308 survived (240 flew to Thailand or US warships and 68 returned to the United States).

In total, the US, South Vietnam and Australia, lost about 12,500 aircraft, helicopters and UAVs.

North Vietnam lost 150 to 170 aircraft and helicopters.

==United States aircraft==
===United States Air Force===
All told, the U.S. Air Force flew 5.25 million sorties over South Vietnam, North Vietnam, northern and southern Laos, and Cambodia, losing 2,251 aircraft: 1,737 to hostile action, and 514 in accidents. 2,197 of the losses were fixed-wing, and the remainder rotary-wing. The USAF sustained approximately 0.4 losses per 1,000 sorties during the conflict, which compared favorably with a 2.0 rate in Korea and a 9.7 figure during World War II.

<text>The Last DJ is the 11th studio album by American rock band Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. The title track, &quot;Money Becomes King&quot;, &quot;Joe&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop the Sun&quot; are all critical of greed in the music industry, which led to a song boycott by some radio stations.

A &quot;limited edition&quot; digipack version of the album was also released, including a DVD of music videos and other footage shot during the album&#x27;s production.

The album reached number 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, aided by the single &quot;The Last DJ&quot;, which peaked at number 22 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in 2002. As of 2010, &quot;The Last DJ&quot; had sold 353,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

The album marks the return of original Heartbreaker Ron Blair on bass guitar, replacing his own replacement, the ailing Howie Epstein. His return was late in the recording process, however, and Petty and Campbell contribute most of the bass work themselves.

The title track (which was the first single) and &quot;Dreamville&quot; were included on the compilation &quot;The Best of Everything&quot;.

<doc id="686158" wikidata="Q1160000" url="?curid=686158" title="Tug Fork">
<text>The Tug Fork is a tributary of the Big Sandy River, long, in southwestern West Virginia, southwestern Virginia, and eastern Kentucky in the United States. Via the Big Sandy and Ohio rivers, it is part of the watershed of the Mississippi River.

It is also known as the Tug Fork River or as the Tug River. The United States Board on Geographic Names settled on &quot;Tug Fork&quot; as the stream&#x27;s official name in 1975.

The Tug Fork rises in the Appalachian Mountains of extreme southwestern West Virginia, in southern McDowell County, near the Virginia state line. It flows in a meandering course through the mountains generally northwest, past Welch. Approximately northwest of Welch, it briefly forms approximately of the state line between West Virginia (northeast) and Virginia (southwest). For the remainder of its course it forms part of the boundary between West Virginia (east) and Kentucky (west), flowing northwest past Williamson, West Virginia. It joins the Levisa Fork at Louisa, Kentucky to form the Big Sandy.

The river flows through an especially remote mountainous region in its upper course. The river valley between Pike County, Kentucky and Mingo County, West Virginia was the scene of the infamous Hatfield–McCoy feud in the late 19th century.

Toponymist George R. Stewart writes about the origin of the name &quot;Tug Fork&quot;. In 1756 a small army of Virginians and Cherokees conducted the Sandy Creek Expedition against the Shawnee. At one point they killed and ate two buffaloes and hung their hides on a tree. Later they returned and, being out of provisions, took the hides and cut them into thin strips called &quot;tugs&quot;. These they roasted and ate. For this reason, the story goes, the stream was given the name &quot;Tug.&quot; Stewart also points out another possible origin. Even if the story is true, the second explanation may have reinforced the name. In the Cherokee language &quot;tugulu&quot; refers to the forks of a stream, as in the Tugaloo River and other streams in former Cherokee lands named &quot;tug&quot;.

<doc id="686164" wikidata="Q2091541" url="?curid=686164" title="Lincoln Logs">
<text>Lincoln Logs are an American construction toy for children, consisting of square-notched miniature lightweight logs used to build small forts and buildings. They were invented around 1916 by John Lloyd Wright, second son of well-known architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Lincoln Logs were inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame in 1999. They are named after U.S. president Abraham Lincoln, who once lived in a log cabin.

Starting in 2014, Lincoln Logs were manufactured by K&#x27;NEX Industries Inc. In late 2017, K&#x27;NEX was bought out by Basic Fun, Inc., of Florida. Pride Manufacturing, of Burnham, Maine, manufactures Lincoln Logs for Basic Fun, and the rights to the IP are owned by Hasbro. In 2024, Basic Fun filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company will use bankruptcy proceedings to repay its creditors while remaining in operation.

== Design ==
The logs measure three quarters of an inch (roughly two centimetres) in diameter. Like real logs used in a log cabin, Lincoln Logs are notched so that logs may be laid at right angles to each other to form rectangles resembling buildings. Additional parts of the toy set include roofs, chimneys, windows and doors, which bring a realistic appearance to the final creation. Later sets included animals and human figures the same scale as the buildings.

The toy sets were originally made of redwood, with varying colors of roof pieces. In the 1970s the company introduced sets made entirely of plastic, but soon reverted to real wood.

== History ==
Lincoln Logs were invented sometime around 1916–1917 when John Lloyd Wright was working in Japan with his father. The mold for the toy was based on the architecture of the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo, designed by the inventor&#x27;s father. The foundation of the hotel was designed with interlocking log beams, which made the structure &quot;earthquake-proof&quot; and one of the few buildings to remain standing after the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake that crumbled Tokyo.

When he returned to the U.S., John organized The Red Square Toy Company (named after his father&#x27;s famous symbol), and marketed the toy in 1918. Wright was issued U.S. patent 1,351,086 on August 31, 1920, for a &quot;Toy-Cabin Construction&quot;. Soon after, he changed the name to J. L. Wright Manufacturing. The original Lincoln Log set came with instructions on how to build Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin as well as Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s cabin. Subsequent sets were larger and more elaborate. The toy was a hit, following as it did Meccano, Tinkertoys and Erector Set introduced a few years before. Lincoln Logs are believed to be the first toy to be marketed to both boys and girls and appeal to a &quot;simple&quot; type of creativity.

In 1999, Lincoln Logs and John Lloyd Wright were entered into the National Toy Hall of Fame. In September 2014, the manufacturer announced the return of production from China to the U.S.; however, Lincoln Log sets with the Basic Fun logo and a copyright date of 2021 or later are now entirely manufactured in China again.

<doc id="686168" wikidata="Q1424124" url="?curid=686168" title="The Left Banke">
<text>The Left Banke was an American baroque pop band, formed in New York City in 1965. They are best remembered for their two U.S. hit singles, &quot;Walk Away Renée&quot; and &quot;Pretty Ballerina&quot;. The band often used what the music press referred to as &quot;baroque&quot; string arrangements, which led to their music being variously termed as &quot;Bach-rock&quot;, &quot;baroque rock&quot; or &quot;baroque pop&quot;. The band&#x27;s vocal harmonies borrowed from contemporaries such as the Beatles, the Zombies and other British Invasion groups.

In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed &quot;Walk Away Renée&quot; at number 220 in its list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;.

==History==
===1965–69: early years and disbandment===
The Left Banke was formed in 1965 and consisted of keyboard player/songwriter Michael Brown, drummer/singer George Cameron, bass guitarist/singer Tom Finn, singer Steve Martin (later known as Steve Martin Caro), and drummer Lisa (then known as Warren) David-Schierhorst.

The band formed among the world of session musicians in midtown Manhattan. Brown&#x27;s father, Harry Lookofsky, was a well-known session violinist, and he owned and operated a recording studio on 48th Street called World United. In 1965 George Cameron&#x27;s band the Morticans was recording there, and they were looking for new members. This attracted Tom Finn of the band the Magic Plants, who had previously worked at World United. Finn brought along a new acquaintance, Steve Martin (Caro), a musician he had met by chance in front of the City Squire Hotel after a Rolling Stones concert. Cameron and Martin both had songs they wanted to record, but these did not take shape until Lookofsky&#x27;s son Michael Brown, 16 at the time, worked out arrangements for them on the studio&#x27;s piano.

According to Finn:

Lookofsky realized that their music had commercial potential, and getting behind his son&#x27;s songwriting talent he acted as producer, manager and publisher for the newly formed band. After some initial recording sessions, David-Schierhorst was ousted, with Cameron switching to drums and Jeff Winfield on guitar.

One of the main reasons David-Schierhorst was kicked out of the Left Banke was because she was a closeted transgender woman and also bisexual, and Harry Lookofsky didn&#x27;t approve:

Their first live show was at a church, Our Lady Of Solace in the Bronx, to an audience of about 1000 people.

The first recording Lookofsky sent to record labels was a proposed single consisting of &quot;I&#x27;ve Got Something On My Mind&quot; backed with &quot;I Haven&#x27;t Got The Nerve&quot;. He found no takers, but tried again with &quot;Walk Away Renée&quot;. Out of about ten labels he sent it to, only one showed interest: Smash Records, a subsidiary of Mercury Records. The single was released by Smash in late 1966, and became a big hit immediately. The band&#x27;s second single, &quot;Pretty Ballerina&quot;, also written by Brown, charted in early 1967, and The Left Banke released an album entitled &quot;Walk Away Renée/Pretty Ballerina&quot;, by which time Rick Brand had replaced Winfield on guitar.

Tension between Brown and the rest of the band soon began to surface. As Finn recalled,

Thus, by the time &quot;Walk Away Renée&quot; became a hit, the original band had become inactive. However, Lookofsky tried to capitalize on the single&#x27;s success by assembling a new version of the Left Banke for touring purposes, with Bert Sommer on lead vocals, original drummer Lisa David-Schierhorst, and (future member of Spinal Tap) Michael McKean on guitar. Brown also recorded a single, &quot;Ivy, Ivy&quot; b/w &quot;And Suddenly&quot; as the Left Banke, with Sommer and a group of session musicians. The remaining members of the band hired attorneys to issue a cease and desist order and urged their fan club to boycott the record, which led to confusion among radio stations over which &quot;Left Banke&quot; to support. Radio and Smash Records ultimately removed their support from the single, which subsequently failed to make the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The &quot;New&quot; Left Banke never performed live. &quot;And Suddenly&quot; was eventually recorded by a group called The Cherry People and became a minor hit. McKean would later find fame as an actor (&quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;, &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot;, &quot;Better Call Saul&quot;).

In late 1967, the original group reunited and recorded more material, including the single &quot;Desirée&quot;. Brown left the group permanently shortly thereafter and was replaced for touring purposes by Emmett Lake. Cameron, Finn and Martin continued to record and tour, with Tom Feher replacing Lake on keyboards and writing half of the band&#x27;s new material. The songs recorded by various incarnations of the group in 1967 and 1968 were assembled into a second LP, &quot;The Left Banke Too&quot;, which was released in November 1968. This album featured backing vocals by a young Steven Tyler (who later became the lead singer of Aerosmith) on &quot;My Friend Today&quot; and &quot;Dark is the Bark&quot;. The band continued playing live in 1969, without Martin, but soon disbanded due to lack of success and financial problems. Later that same year, Brown and Martin reunited in the studio to record another single as the Left Banke, &quot;Myrah&quot; b/w &quot;Pedestal&quot;, which was their final single for Smash Records.

===1971–present: various reunions===
In 1971, Brown, Cameron, Finn and Martin reunited briefly to record two songs for the movie &quot;Hot Parts&quot;. The songs, &quot;Love Songs in the Night&quot; and &quot;Two by Two&quot;, were released as a Steve Martin solo single on Buddah Records, despite featuring contributions from four founding members of the Left Banke. In 1972, producer Les Fradkin offered to produce the group for a project on Bell Records. Although these sessions were not released at the time, one of the songs, &quot;I Could Make It Last Forever&quot;, composed by Fradkin and Diane Ellis, was released on Fradkin&#x27;s &quot;Goin&#x27; Back&quot; solo CD in 2006. It was a rare recording since it featured Caro, Finn, Cameron and Brown, along with Brown&#x27;s father, violinist Harry Lookofsky. Fradkin sang and played 12-string guitar on the sessions. In 1978, Martin, Cameron and Finn reunited as The Left Banke to record an album&#x27;s worth of material which was not released at the time. However, a single from these 1978 sessions, &quot;Queen of Paradise&quot; (b/w &quot;And One Day&quot;), was released in late 1978 with modest success. The album was eventually issued by Relix Records in 1986 under the title &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; (&quot;Voices Calling&quot; in Europe). However, the album did little to restore the popularity of the group.

After leaving the Left Banke in 1967, Michael Brown helped form the band Montage. Although Brown was never an official member of Montage, his presence is unmistakable in its music. The band released one self-titled album in 1969, which included a re-recording of The Left Banke song &quot;Desiree&quot;, before Brown left. Brown&#x27;s next project was the band Stories, featuring singer Ian Lloyd. The band had a hit in 1973 with &quot;Brother Louie&quot;, which reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 charts. However, Brown had left the group after their 2nd album &quot;About Us&quot;, but before the success of &quot;Brother Louie&quot;. Brown&#x27;s next project was with The Beckies, which released one group-titled album.

In 1992, Mercury Records released a Left Banke compilation titled &quot;There&#x27;s Gonna Be a Storm: The Complete Recordings 1966–1969&quot;. It was intended to bring together the band&#x27;s entire recorded output from the years 1966 to 1969, although a 1969 outtake titled &quot;Foggy Waterfall&quot;, which had previously appeared on two earlier compilations, was not included.

In 1994, Michael Brown and his wife Yvonne Vitale produced and released an album titled &quot;On This Moment&quot;. Between 2001 and 2006, Brown hosted a series of recording sessions at his home studio with Ian Lloyd (vocals), Tom Finn (bass guitar/vocals), Jim McAllister (guitar), and Jon Ihle (drums).

Swedish musician Jens Lekman sampled &quot;I&#x27;ve Got Something on My Mind&quot; in his 2003 song &quot;Black Cab.&quot; In 2005, Alice Cooper included a cover version of &quot;Pretty Ballerina&quot; on his album &quot;Dirty Diamonds&quot;. In 2006, ex-member of The Bangles Susanna Hoffs and Matthew Sweet, as Sid &#x27;n&#x27; Susie, covered &quot;She May Call You Up Tonight&quot; for their first album &quot;Under the Covers, Vol. 1&quot;. In addition, Stuart Murdoch of the band Belle and Sebastian has cited The Left Banke as one of the early influences on the sound of the band. Richard Thompson included a cover of &quot;She May Call You Up Tonight&quot; on his 1998 live album, Celtschmerz.

Former guitarist Jeff Winfield died of complications from pneumonia on June 13, 2009, at age 60.

====2011–13====
The previous touring version of The Left Banke featured one original member, George Cameron. Initially, Tom Finn and George Cameron reformed The Left Banke in March 2011, tapping New York City&#x27;s Mike Fornatale (already a veteran of numerous other 60s band reunions, including The Monks and Moby Grape) to sing lead vocals in Steve Martin Caro&#x27;s stead. The reunited group also featured new players: Paul Alves (lead guitar, backing vocals), Charly Cazalet (bass), Mickey Finn (keyboards), Rick Reil (drums, percussion, backing vocals) and second keyboardist/synth player Joe McGinty (replaced by John Spurney in 2012). They appeared live at Joe&#x27;s Pub in New York City on March 5, 2011, and March 6, 2011, to sold-out audiences. In April 2011, Tom Finn revealed in a Facebook posting that he had reformed the group, with two shows planned for July in New York City. Tom Finn performed with the re-formed group through 2013, after which he left due to disagreements with Cameron and due to back trouble.

In early 2011, Sundazed released reissues of the two Smash vinyl albums on CD and LP, utilizing the original running order and artwork.

In February 2012, Tom Finn notified the YouTube community that the Left Banke was in the process of creating a new record featuring contributions from co-founder Michael Brown.

On April 29, 2012, Brown joined the reunited Left Banke on stage at B.B. King&#x27;s in New York City for a version of his &quot;Pretty Ballerina.&quot; His performance was greeted with a standing ovation. Rick Brand, guitarist with the band in 1966-67 was also in attendance. Tom Finn sang a newly written song called &quot;City Life&quot; which showed a heavier rock version of the Left Banke with baroque string section intact. No new recordings begun in 2012 were ever released, and Brown died in 2015.

At the beginning of their reunion dates, the group was joined onstage by a two or three-piece string section and even a guest oboe player for one or two shows. Both Michael Brown and George Cameron were in touch with Steve Martin Caro, who wanted to rejoin the group, but was unable to tour in 2012 due to previous commitments.

On June 6, 2013, Brown joined the reunited Left Banke on stage at Joe&#x27;s Pub in NYC for his last live performance of &quot;Walk Away Renee&quot;.

===Unrealized reunions===
On March 18, 2015, the day before Mike Brown&#x27;s death, it was announced that original vocalist Steve Martin Caro officially rejoined the current touring version of The Left Banke. Photos on The Left Banke official Facebook and Twitter pages displayed Steve signing a contract. Two 2015 shows featured co-headliner Ian Lloyd of Stories and Sam Kogon as vocalist. The re-formed Cameron band played in NYC, Bearsville, NY, Sellersville, PA and Natick, MA. 

In January, 2018, it was announced on the official Facebook page operated by Steve Martin Caro and George Cameron that they were planning a tour. Several photos of Steve Martin Caro rehearsing with George Cameron and singer/guitarist Sam Kogon were posted with a message which stated &quot;it was Steve&#x27;s first time behind the microphone in over 15 years. We went through and workshopped much of the Left Banke catalog.&quot; However, Cameron died five months later, before any performances could take place under this collaboration.

===Deaths===
Michael Brown died from heart disease on March 19, 2015, at age 65. Brown had been writing new material and planned to participate in the 2015 reunion of the Left Banke with Steve Martin Caro and George Cameron. Brown&#x27;s funeral and memorial service was held on March 25, 2015, at Fort Lee Gospel Church in Fort Lee, New Jersey.

Justo George Cameron (born October 16, 1947, in New York City) died of cancer at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan on June 24, 2018, at age 70. Thomas Leo Feher died from heart failure on August 5, 2018. Steve Martin Caro died from heart disease on January 14, 2020. He was 71 years old. The last surviving member from the original lineup, Tom Finn, died on June 27, 2020, after years of declining health.

<text>Yulara is a town in the southern region of the Northern Territory, Australia. It is an unincorporated enclave within the MacDonnell Region. At the , Yulara had a permanent population of 1,099, in an area of . It is by road from the World Heritage Site of Uluru (Ayers Rock), and from Kata Tjuta (The Olgas). It is in the Northern Territory electorate of Gwoja and the federal electorate of Lingiari.

==History==
By the early 1970s, the pressure of unstructured and unregulated tourism, including motels near the base of Uluru (Ayers Rock), was having detrimental effects on the environment in the area of both Uluru and Kata Tjuta. Following the recommendation of a Senate Select Committee, which was to remove all developments near the base of the rock, and build a new resort to support tourism in the Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park, the Commonwealth Government agreed in 1973 to relocate accommodation facilities to a new site outside the park. On 10 August 1976, the Governor General proclaimed the new town of Yulara, some from Uluru.

After the Northern Territory was granted self-government in 1978, the development of the new town became a priority of the Northern Territory government. Between 1978 and 1981, basic infrastructure, such as roads and water supply, was provided via the government&#x27;s capital works program. In 1980, the government set up the Yulara Development Company Ltd to provide tourist accommodation, staff housing and a shopping centre.

Between 1982 and 1984, the first stage of the resort was constructed for the Northern Territory Government by Yulara Development Company Ltd., at a cost of A$130 million. The resort was designed by Philip Cox &amp; Associates and won the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (RAIA) Sir Zelman Cowen Award for Public Architecture in 1985. In 2019, it won the Northern Territory Award for Enduring Architecture and the National Award for Enduring Architecture.

When the new facilities became fully operational in late 1984, the Commonwealth Government terminated all the leases for the old motels near the Rock, and the area was rehabilitated by the National Park Service (now called Parks Australia). Around the same time, the national park was renamed Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa, and its ownership was transferred to the local Indigenous people, who leased it back to the Parks Australia for 99 years.

There were originally three competing hotels, but that detracted from the viability of the whole enterprise, with the company (and, indirectly, the government) incurring massive operating losses. Between 1990 and 1992, the competing hotel operators were replaced by a single operator, the government-owned Investnorth Management Pty Ltd. In 1992, the government sold, through open tender, a 40% interest in the Yulara Development Company and, therefore, the resort, to a venture capital consortium.

In 1997, the entire resort was again sold by open tender to General Property Trust, which appointed Voyages Hotels &amp; Resorts as operator. Voyages operated all aspects of the resort, with the exception of the post office. Almost all residents of the town rented their housing from Voyages, but the government leased some housing for its employees. Most residents are either workers in the resort or tour operators.

In 2011, the resort was sold once more, to the Indigenous Land Corporation, which operates the resort under its subsidiary, Voyages Indigenous Tourism Australia.

==Demographics==
The 2016 Australian census found that Yulara had a population of 1,099 people, which had the following characteristics:
* Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders made up 14.2% of the population. 
* 52.8% of people were born in Australia and 62.6% of people spoke only English at home. 
* The most common response for religion was &quot;no religion&quot; at 38.4%.

==Transport==

Ayers Rock Airport, also known as Connellan Airport, is about six kilometres north of Yulara. It makes it possible to reach Yulara from Sydney, Melbourne, Alice Springs, Cairns, Adelaide or Darwin in less time than the five-hour car journey from Alice Springs, the nearest major town, north-east.

The resort is served by one major road, the Lasseter Highway, which links it to surrounding roads and landmarks. In the early 2020s, the highway was expanded to cope with increase tourist traffic. The sealed highway runs east to meet the Stuart Highway. The roads in other directions are not well maintained or travelled. The Great Central Road heads west and south-west into Western Australia, but is generally only suitable for high-clearance four-wheel drive vehicles. Transit permits from Aboriginal Land Councils are required to travel west of Kata-Tjuta.

==Climate==
Yulara has an arid climate (&quot;BWh&quot;), with long, hot summers and short, cool winters, and scant rainfall year-round. Frost may occur on some winter mornings.

<text>Black project is an informal term used to describe a highly classified, top-secret military or defense project that is not publicly acknowledged by government, military personnel, or contractors.

==United States and black projects==

In the United States, the formal term for a black project is an &quot;unacknowledged special access program&quot; (&quot;SAP&quot;). Black projects receive their funding from the black budget. 

The US depends on private defense contractors to develop and build military equipment. The two most notable examples are Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. The R&amp;D department of Lockheed Martin is commonly referred to as Skunk Works; it is responsible for a number of aircraft designs, highly classified R&amp;D programs, and exotic aircraft platforms. 

Two well known sites for testing of black projects are the Nevada Test site and Area 51.

<text>The Levisa Fork (also known as the Levisa Fork River or the Levisa Fork of the Big Sandy River) is a tributary of the Big Sandy River, approximately long, in southwestern Virginia and eastern Kentucky in the United States.

==Overview==
It rises in the Appalachian Mountains of southwestern Virginia, in eastern Buchanan County, near Grundy. It flows west into Pike County, Kentucky, where it is impounded to form Fishtrap Lake reservoir. After collecting the Russell Fork, it flows northwest through Pikeville and Prestonsburg. The natural course of the river formed a loop surrounding downtown Pikeville, but a massive earthmoving project completed in 1987 rerouted the river to bypass the city. At Paintsville it turns to the north-northeast, flowing through Johnson and Lawrence counties. It joins the Tug Fork from the southwest at Louisa on the West Virginia state line to form the Big Sandy.

The Levisa Fork was historically an important river for log driving. The river is partly navigable for commercial purposes through a series of locks. In the early 1900s the river was navigable as far as Pikeville.

Variant names, according to the USGS, include Louisa River, Louisa Fork, Lavisa Fork, and West Fork, in addition to Levisa Fork River and Levisa Fork of the Big Sandy River. The official name according to the USGS is Levisa Fork. According to Robert F. Collins of the United States Forest Service, 18th-century explorer Dr. Thomas Walker had named the nearby Kentucky River the Louisa River, after Princess Louisa, sister of Prince William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland (Walker had just named the Cumberland River a month or two earlier). According to George R. Stewart, frontiersmen &quot;forgot&quot; who it was named for and it changed over time to Levisa. An alternate story is that one of Ephraim Vause&#x27; daughters, Levicee, was carried away by the Shawnee after the attack on Fort Vause in 1756. She had placed her name on the trunks of beech and sycamore trees as she had been carried along, thus giving her name to Levisa Fork.

On February 28, 1958, a Floyd County school bus tumbled into the Levisa Fork after a collision with a wrecker truck, leading to one of the worst bus disasters in American history.

<doc id="686192" wikidata="Q175762" url="?curid=686192" title="Handball-Bundesliga">
<text>The Handball-Bundesliga (HBL) is the top German professional handball league. From 2007 to 2012, the league was sponsored by Toyota and was officially called the &quot;Toyota Handball-Bundesliga&quot;. In 2012 the Deutsche Kreditbank AG (DKB) became the new sponsor. , the latest league sponsor is Daikin and the official name has consequently been changed to Daikin Handball-Bundesliga. The winners of the respective season are the official German handball champions.
The HBL is headquartered in Dortmund.

==History==
The Bundesliga was introduced with the 1966/67 season and initially operated with two regional sections, North and South. Since 1977 the Bundesliga has operated with a single section first division, currently composed of eighteen clubs. In 1981 a &quot;2.Bundesliga&quot; was introduced as a new second division, supplanting the &quot;Regionalliga&quot; which became the third tier. The &quot;2.Bundesliga&quot; used to consist of two (resp. three in the first two years after the German reunification) sections north and south for thirty years. Starting with the 2011/12 season the &quot;2.Bundesliga&quot; is run in a single section consisting of twenty teams.

==Season==
The season has 34 game days (or weeks) and is played as a round-robin tournament without playoffs or a final. The season starts in August or September and ends in May.

The first and second-placed teams are entitled to play in the EHF Champions League the following season. The third, fourth, fifth and sixth-placed teams additionally play in the EHF European League. The seedings are subject to change, in case a German team wins the Champions League, the EHF European League or the EHF Cup Winner&#x27;s Cup because each winner of those tournaments is granted an automatic start in the next year&#x27;s tournament without taking one of the league&#x27;s spots. It also can change if the DHB-Pokal Champion takes one of the league spots for the Champions League or the EHF European League.

==Relegation and promotion==

Until 2011, the two last placed teams would be relegated to the &quot;2. Handball-Bundesliga&quot; for the next season, either in its northern or the southern section. The sixteenth placed team used to play in a home and away decider against the winner of the decider between the two-second placed teams of the northern and the southern section of the &quot;2. Bundesliga&quot;. The champions of the second divisions received a spot for the Bundesliga automatically.

Since the 2017–18 season, the bottom two teams of the Bundesliga will directly be relegated to the &quot;2. Bundesliga&quot;, while the top two teams of the &quot;2. Bundesliga&quot; will be directly promoted to the Bundesliga.

<text>Fred Drury McMullin (October 13, 1891 – November 20, 1952) was an American Major League Baseball third baseman. He is best known for his involvement in the 1919 Black Sox scandal.

==Early life==
Fred McMullin was born to Robert and Minnie McMullin, the first of nine children. The family grew so big that eventually they migrated to Southern California, where Fred attended Los Angeles High School. McMullin played for the school&#x27;s baseball team, which boasted another future major leaguer ball player in Johnny Rawlings.

==Career==
McMullin got his first taste of playing pro ball when he signed a contract to play for the Long Beach Sand Crabs of the short lived Trolly League. The teams were often short on funds and many times, players weren&#x27;t paid. The league folded after a few months. After that McMullin bounced around from minor league to minor league until he signed with the Seattle Giants of the Northwestern League, which was at the time considered a launching point for future major league players. McMullin played for Seattle until his contract was sold to the Tacoma Tigers. His career began to blossom in Tacoma under the guidance of ex big league pitcher Joe McGinnity. McMullin replaced team captain Bill Yohe when Yohle was released to give McMullin more playing time. He began his major league career on August 27, 1914, as a shortstop for the Detroit Tigers. He spent most of 1912–1915 in the minors before making the Chicago White Sox team in 1916. In 1917, he won the World Series with Chicago, while batting .125 in six games against the New York Giants.

McMullin was only a utility infielder for the 1919 AL Champion White Sox, and as such he didn&#x27;t play enough to have much potential for throwing games (he recorded just two plate appearances in the eight-game series). However, he became a part of the conspiracy when he overheard several other players&#x27; conversations and threatened to report them unless included.

McMullin was also Chicago&#x27;s advance scout for the World Series, which may explain how and why he earned an equal share in the winnings ($5,000) from the fix. It is entirely probable that, as a means to cover himself and his co-conspirators, McMullin delivered a flawed scouting report to all the &quot;clean&quot; Sox about what to expect from Cincinnati&#x27;s pitchers. A look at the statistics shows little disparity between Black Sox and Clean Sox; for example, ringleader Chick Gandil batted .233 to future Hall of Famer Eddie Collins&#x27; .226.

For his role in the fix, McMullin was banned for life from organized baseball, along with seven other players, by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis.

==Later years and death==
McMullin never spoke publicly about his involvement in the Black Sox scandal. He went on to hold a variety of jobs throughout his life such as a carpenter, office jobs, traffic manager and Los Angeles County deputy marshal. McMullin became the deputy marshal in 1940. One of these duties involved serving as a bailiff, and the other was serving eviction notices. One of these was on a blind woman, for whom McMullin delayed service of the eviction notice when he noticed that she was struggling to pack up the belongings of her children. McMullin’s final years were plagued by ill health caused by arteriosclerosis. On November 19, 1952, just over a month after his 61st birthday, he had a fatal stroke. McMullin was buried at Inglewood Park Cemetery.

==In popular culture==
In the 1988 film &quot;Eight Men Out&quot;, McMullin was portrayed by Perry Lang.

<text>54 is a 1998 American drama film written and directed by Mark Christopher. Starring Ryan Phillippe, Salma Hayek, Neve Campbell, and Mike Myers, the film focuses on the rise and fall of Studio 54, a famous nightclub in New York City during the late 1970s and early 1980s.

Prior to its release in the United States on August 28, 1998, by Miramax Films, the film was extensively reshot and recut; it ultimately opened to poor critical reaction and box office. In 2008, a bootleg version of the director&#x27;s cut was screened at Outfest, leading to interest for its release. In 2015, Christopher and Miramax premiered a new edit of the film at the 65th Berlin International Film Festival, with 45 minutes of original material restored and 30 minutes of studio re-shoots removed.

==Plot==
===Theatrical version===
In 1979, 19-year-old Irish-American filling station attendant Shane O&#x27;Shea lives in Jersey City, New Jersey, with his widowed, conservative father Harlan and two younger sisters Grace and Kelly. Weary of his working-class existence, Shane longs for a more glamorous life across the river in New York City&#x27;s Manhattan. One night, he persuades his two friends into accompanying him to Studio 54, a disco nightclub. When he is chosen to enter upon arrival by the club&#x27;s co-owner Steve Rubell, he is exposed to the hedonistic world of 54, with unbridled alcohol, drugs, and open sex. Against Harlan&#x27;s wishes, Shane returns to 54 the next night, and Steve hires him as a busboy. After fighting with Harlan over his new job, he leaves Jersey City and moves in with fellow busboy Greg Randazzo and his coat-check girl wife Anita, an aspiring singer, in Manhattan.

After a week bussing tables, Shane is promoted to bartender following a one-night stand with club regular Billie Auster, upsetting Greg, who feels that he did not get the job because he would not let Steve perform oral sex on him. As Shane&#x27;s popularity skyrockets, he mingles with the city&#x27;s upper-class, poses for a beefcake photo shoot in &quot;Interview&quot; magazine, consumes drugs, and has sex with multiple women. After a while, Shane begins to feel used because he wants to be taken seriously and valued for more than just his good looks and sex appeal.

Shane&#x27;s rise in popularity also damages his relationships with his friends and family, especially during the Christmas holidays. On Christmas Eve, Greg, who now moonlights as a drug dealer for extra money, criticizes Shane of displaying a conceited attitude and accuses him of attempting to have sex with Anita after witnessing him attempting to begin a romantic relationship with her earlier at their apartment. Harlan, whom Shane has not seen or spoken to in months, rejects him when he returns home for a visit on Christmas Day because a female friend of the family who got into 54 one night informed him that she saw Shane doing drugs. However, he does experience some brief happiness during the holidays when he commences a short-lived romance with fellow New Jerseyan Julie Black, a soap opera starlet determined to succeed in the film industry.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve 1979, Shane&#x27;s stardom, his relationship with Julie, and 54&#x27;s life all end. He disgustedly rejects Julie after discovering her with Roland Sachs, an agent she plans to have sex with to advance her career. After elderly 54 regular Mona (aka Disco Dottie) dies of a cocaine overdose during Anita&#x27;s debut performance, Steve asks a grief-stricken Shane to ignore the incident and continue working. Shane angrily refuses and gets into a near-physical altercation with Steve, who then fires him and orders his bouncers to expel him from the club. Simultaneously, the FBI raids 54 and arrests Steve, as he has been skimming money from the club&#x27;s nightly take. As Shane leaves 54 in disgrace, Julie passes by him in a limousine, and following a heart-to-heart, they part ways but agree to remain friends.

Ultimately, Steve receives an 18-month prison sentence for tax evasion, and 54 closes; upon release, he is forced to sell 54 but remains associated with the club as a consultant under the new management. Meanwhile, Shane communicates regularly with Julie, who moves to Hollywood and lands a bit part in a film, but he, Anita and Greg drift apart. Anita releases a moderately successful album with Casablanca Records and Greg obtains a construction job after serving six months of probation for dealing drugs. Shane works nights managing a restaurant in Greenwich Village and takes business classes at NYU during the daylight hours; he also improves his relationships with his father and sisters by visiting them weekly. The trio reunite at the newly reopened 54 upon Steve&#x27;s release, for a one-night welcome-back party hosted by him for all of his old friends and employees. Eventually, 54 closes permanently in 1986, and Steve dies of AIDS in 1989 at age 45.

===Director&#x27;s cut additions===
The director&#x27;s cut opens with a new narration of the film&#x27;s original opening as Shane is seen leaving 54 after being thrown out on New Year&#x27;s Eve. Shane&#x27;s narration from the theatrical version is omitted.

In a moment of confusion, an openly bisexual Shane kisses Greg in the VIP room on Christmas Eve, before then having sexual intercourse with Anita in the ladies&#x27; room after she and Greg have an altercation. Anita, noticing Steve watching them, hits Shane in the stomach and runs out of the ladies&#x27; room in shame.

When Shane discovers that he is running low on cash due to his numerous debts, Greg introduces him to his covert drug-dealing operation. Shane steals some of Steve&#x27;s skimmed cash as capital and repays his debts on New Year&#x27;s Eve.

Greg eventually agrees to let Steve perform oral sex on him for the bartender job, but Steve disagrees, admitting that he would rather watch Greg and Anita have sex instead, as he did on Christmas Eve. Greg goes to the cloakroom to confront Anita and encounters her hugging Shane, after which the two have a fistfight. Shane freebases cocaine to ease his emotional pain.

After Greg and Anita reconcile following her interrupted debut performance, Anita leaves with Billie for a photo op. Shane discovers G-men raiding Steve&#x27;s office and retreats upstairs to warn Greg, but Greg ignores him. Greg then runs to retrieve his belongings from his locker when he sees Shane being thrown out of the club but discovers that a G-man has already beat him to it and has found his drugs.

After Shane is expelled from 54, he witnesses Greg running up behind him. Shane offers him his garbage bag cloak to keep him clothed, and Greg begrudgingly accepts. Anita runs up to them afterwards in a lavish fur coat and cloaks Greg in it with her as they both depart. Greg calls for Shane to accompany them, just as Julie pulls up Shane alongside in her limousine and offers him a ride. Shane declines Julie&#x27;s offer and instead departs with Greg and Anita, with the trio staying together as a family instead of drifting apart.

==Cast==
==Production==
Based on two short films Mark Christopher made, Miramax Films persuaded Christopher to direct the full-length feature about Studio 54. He had spent five years researching the club and the time period while working on a screenplay. Miramax Films purchased a partial screenplay in 1995 and developed the script with the filmmaker for over a year.

Christopher shot the film in Toronto over two months in the fall of 1997. However, he and studio head Harvey Weinstein differed on their respective visions of the film. Christopher intended for the film to capture Studio 54&#x27;s notoriety as &quot;the epicenter of the gay cultural explosion in New York City&quot; and wanted the story to be told from the perspective of &quot;Shane, a kid from New Jersey who sleeps his way to the top of the 54 pecking order, which means that he becomes one of the shirtless bartenders for which the club was notorious, golden boys who flexed and preened for the clientele of both sexes, occasionally deigning to grant sexual favors in return for money and drugs&quot;. Conversely, Weinstein wanted a more commercial film akin to &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; (1977), with its gay storyline removed.

Weinstein screen tested Christopher&#x27;s cut of the film on Long Island in early 1998. Audiences at this screening reacted negatively to the lead character&#x27;s bisexuality, particularly to a scene where Shane and Greg kiss, as well as the happy ending for both characters and Anita. Miramax Films subsequently requested the film remove any suggestions of bisexuality. The postproduction process was troubled, with Weinstein hiring a second writing team to flesh out new scenes that play up a romance between Shane and Julie. Christopher was not allowed in the editing room, and though he agreed to shoot the new scenes after initial resistance, he did not get to see the final cut.

==Reception and legacy==
&quot;54&quot; opened at No. 4 on its opening weekend (August 28–30, 1998) with $6.6 million, behind &quot;Blade&quot;, &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot;, and &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;.

===Studio cut===
The film grossed $16.8 million on an estimated budget of $13 million. Myers, in his first serious dramatic role, garnered some of the film&#x27;s only positive word-of-mouth. The role was Myers&#x27; only foray into drama until &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot; (released in 2009) and &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; and &quot;Terminal&quot; (both released in 2018).

Though some critics noted Christopher manages to &quot;[re-create] the club&#x27;s playfully subversive physical details: the glitter confetti and giant silver man-in-the-moon cokehead mobile, the VIP room hidden in the dank basement&quot;, many were particularly disappointed with the film&#x27;s fictional characters and storyline, believing that Studio 54&#x27;s notorious, real-life past should have been explored with better detail and more realism.

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 15% based on 66 reviews, with an average rating of 4.2/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Robbed of its integral LGBTQ themes, &quot;54&quot; is a compromised and disjointed glance at the glory days of disco.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 33 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable&quot; reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

The film was nominated for two Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Actor for Ryan Phillippe and Worst Supporting Actress for Ellen Albertini Dow. Neve Campbell was nominated for Worst Supporting Actress (also for &quot;Wild Things&quot;) at the 1998 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards.

=== Director&#x27;s cut ===
In the years after the theatrical cut&#x27;s release, a bootleg VHS version of the two-hour-long rough cut began circulating. Strong word of mouth and support led to New York LGBTQ film festival Outfest screening the rough cut to a sold-out crowd in 2008. Christopher and his co-producer Jonathan King had been lobbying Miramax for years to allow them to remaster the director&#x27;s cut for DVD. In 2014, the filmmakers received the greenlight to make &quot;54: The Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; from Zanne Devine, Miramax&#x27;s then-VP of production. They completed the film in time for a screening in the Panorama section of the 65th Berlin International Film Festival in February 2015. The 105 minute-long cut included 44 minutes of restored footage, with all but a few seconds of the studio-dictated re-shot footage jettisoned.

The director&#x27;s cut has received a much more positive critical response, and the film has a cult following among the gay community. Of &quot;54: The Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;, critic Louis Jordan wrote, &quot;Driven by character and atmosphere rather than soapy plot, Christopher&#x27;s film is permeated by a melancholy that adds depth to the ecstatic party scenes. Mike Myers nails the pathos and charm behind Rubell&#x27;s luded-out lechery, while Phillippe&#x27;s measured performance, finally given space to breathe, is vulnerable, amoral, and sexy. There are no easy heroes or villains in this &quot;54&quot;, only people looking for something they&#x27;ll likely never find.&quot;

==Home media==
A 2012 Blu-ray release features several additional and alternate scenes that were not included in the theatrical release. This extended cut runs 100 minutes, eight minutes of which are not in the studio&#x27;s 92-minute release. Miramax and Lionsgate Home Entertainment released &quot;54: The Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; in digital HD on streaming video providers on June 2, 2015. A Blu-ray version of this cut was released in 2016.

<text>Miroslav Volf (born September 25, 1956) is a Croatian Protestant theologian and public intellectual and Henry B. Wright Professor of Theology and director of the Yale Center for Faith and Culture at Yale University. He previously taught at the Evangelical Theological Seminary in his native Osijek, Croatia (1979–80, 1983–90) and Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California (1990–1998).

Having received two advanced degrees under the German theologian Jürgen Moltmann, Volf has been described as a &quot;theological bridge builder.&quot; The main thrust of his theology is to bring Christian theology to bear on various realms of public life, such as culture, politics, and economics. He often explores dialogues between different groups in the world—such as between denominations, faiths, and ethnic groups.

Volf has served as an advisor for the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships and for several years co-taught a course at Yale with former British prime minister Tony Blair on globalization. He is a frequent commentator on religious and cultural issues in popular media outlets such as CNN, NPR, and Al Jazeera. Volf won the 2002 University of Louisville and the Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary Grawemeyer Award in Religion and his 1996 book &quot;Exclusion and Embrace&quot; was named by &quot;Christianity Today&quot; as one of the 100 Most Influential Books of the Twentieth Century.

==Family and early life==
Miroslav Volf was born on September 25, 1956, in Osijek, Croatia, which was then part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. At the age of five his family moved to the multicultural city of Novi Sad, Serbia (then also part of Yugoslavia), where his father became a minister for the small Pentecostal community. Growing up as part of that community, Volf lived doubly on the margins: religiously, Osijek was predominantly Catholic and Novi Sad predominantly Serbian Orthodox; in both towns, Protestants were a small minority and Pentecostals were &quot;a minority of a minority&quot;. Politically, Yugoslavia was dominated by Marxist ideology and Christian ministers were particularly suspect and carefully monitored. Volf later recalled about his childhood that he did not have the luxury of &quot;entertaining faith merely as a set of propositions that you do or don&#x27;t assent to&quot;. In school, especially in his early teens, the faith of his parents and their community was a heavy burden; Volf&#x27;s sense of being different from his peers and from the larger culture around him caused him &quot;almost unbearable shame&quot; and he rebelled against faith. In his mid teens, however, he had a quiet conversion. As the only openly Christian student in his high school, he had to explain why and how the Christian faith makes sense intellectually.

==Early influences and education==

Volf studied philosophy and classical Greek at the University of Zagreb and theology at Zagreb&#x27;s Evangelical-Theological Seminary. He graduated summa cum laude in 1977 with a thesis on Ludwig Feuerbach. The same year he started working on his M.A. at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California, and graduated summa cum laude in 1979. During the interim year back in Yugoslavia between his masters and doctoral study, he continued studying philosophy at the University of Belgrade.

From 1980 to 1985 Volf pursued a doctorate at the University of Tübingen, Germany, under the supervision of Jürgen Moltmann (with compulsory military service back in Yugoslavia interrupting his studies from October 1983 to October 1984). For most of this time he had an ecumenical scholarship from the Diakonisches Werk and lived in the Evangelisches Stift. His dissertation was a theological engagement with Karl Marx&#x27; philosophy of labor, and pursuing this project led him to study both German idealist philosophy and English political economy. He graduated again summa cum laude, and the University of Tübingen awarded him the Leopold Lukas Nachwuchswissenschaftler Preis for his dissertation.

In 1989 he received a scholarship from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation and started working on his Habilitation (a post-doctoral degree required by many continental European universities for a call to a professorship). The Habilitation was on &quot;Trinity and Communion&quot;, a topic stimulated by Volf&#x27;s long standing involvement in the official dialogue between the Vatican&#x27;s Council for Promoting Christian Unity and the international Pentecostal movement. He was awarded this degree in 1994.

==Teaching==
In 1979, Volf began his teaching career as a lecturer in systematic theology at his alma mater in Croatia. Doctoral studies and compulsory military service interrupted his regular teaching, though he continued to offer intensive courses at the same institution. After submitting his doctoral dissertation, Volf returned to full-time teaching. From 1984 until 1991 he served as professor of systematic theology at the Evangelical-Theological Seminary, which had by then moved to his native Osijek.

In 1991, Volf took a position as an Associate Professor of Systematic Theology at Fuller, succeeding his former teacher at that institution, Paul King Jewett. He remained in this position until 1997 when Fuller appointed him to a full professorship. Throughout this time, he continued to teach in Osijek, as his contract with Fuller included provisions for teaching two courses every year in Croatia. In 1998 Volf took the position of Henry B. Wright Professor of Theology at Yale Divinity School in New Haven, Connecticut.

==Theological work==
Since Volf considers theology to be an articulation of a way of life, his theological writing is marked by a sense of the unity between systematic theology and biblical interpretation, between dogmatics and ethics, and between what is called &quot;church theology&quot; (e.g., Karl Barth and, later, Stanley Hauerwas) and &quot;political/public theology&quot; (e.g., Jürgen Moltmann and David Tracy). His contributions to theology have for the most part been topical; he wrote on human work, the nature of Christian community, the problem of otherness, violence and reconciliation, the question of memory, and the public role of faith, to name a few issues. But in all his writings, he sought to bring the integrated whole of Christian convictions to bear on the topics at hand.

The systematic contours of Volf&#x27;s theology are most clearly visible in &quot;Free of Charge&quot;. A former Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, commissioned the book as his 2006 Lent Book. Its immediate themes are giving and forgiving as two chief modes of grace, but the book is an accessible introduction and invitation to the Christian faith. In this work, the central themes of Volf&#x27;s work that receive more in depth treatment in other texts—God as unconditional love, the Trinitarian nature of God, creation as gift, Christ&#x27;s death on the cross for the ungodly, justification by faith and communal nature of Christian life, love of enemy and care for the downtrodden, reconciliation and forgiveness, and hope for a world of love—come together into a unity. Because it contains frequent reflections on concrete experiences, the book makes visible that Volf&#x27;s theology both grows out of and leads to a life of faith. Of all his books, &quot;Free of Charge&quot; bears the strongest mark of the young Martin Luther&#x27;s influence.

===Christian faith and economics===
The first phase of Volf&#x27;s academic work began with his dissertation and continued through the eighties. His concern then was the relationship between Christian faith and the economy, and in particular the nature and purpose of human everyday work. In his dissertation he engaged Karl Marx and it was published in an abbreviated form as &quot;Zukunft der Arbeit—Arbeit der Zukunft: Der Marxsche Arbeitsbegriff und seine theologische Wertung&quot; (1988), making a contribution not just to a critical theological evaluation on Marx&#x27;s philosophy, but also to Marx studies (notably with regard to the influence of Feuerbach on Marx&#x27; theory of economic alienation and affinities between the late Fichte&#x27;s ideas and Marx&#x27; conceptualization of communist society).

In the process of writing the dissertation, Volf formulated an alternative theology of work, primarily situated in ecclesiology and eschatology, rather than in the doctrine of creation or of salvation, and associated with the Third, rather than the First or Second person of the Trinity. Volf breaks with the long tradition of Protestant thinking about work as &quot;vocation&quot; (both Luther and Calvin, as well as Puritans and later theologians, including Karl Barth, advocated it), and proposes &quot;charisma&quot; as the central theological category with the help of which human work is to be understood. This line of thinking provides a flexible theological account of work, suited for dynamic contemporary societies in which people engage in multiple kinds of work over the course of a life-time, and better coordinated with the multiplicity of ministries that each person can have in the church. Volf published the new, pneumatological account of work in &quot;Work in the Spirit: Toward a Theology of Work&quot; (1991).

As a result of his academic work on faith and economics, Volf took on the task as the main drafter of the &quot;Oxford Declaration on Faith and Economics&quot; (1990). Working groups from various parts of the world sent papers to Volf&#x27;s desk, and the text he prepared on the basis of those papers was discussed, amended, and finally adopted at a conference in 1990 by a wide array of Christian leaders, theologians, philosophers, ethicists, economists, development practitioners, and political scientists (&quot;Gerechtigkeit, Geist und Schöpfung. Die Oxford-Erklärung zur Frage von Glaube und Wirtschaft&quot;, eds. Herman Sauter and Miroslav Volf, 1992; &quot;Christianity and Economics in the Post-Cold War Era: The Oxford Declaration and Beyond&quot;, ed. H. Schlossberg, 1994). His own charismatic account of work has found endorsement in that document.

===Trinity and community===
In 1985 Volf became a member of the Pentecostal side of the official Roman Catholic and Pentecostal dialogue. The theme of the dialogue for the five years that followed was communio, and, together with Peter Kuzmič, Volf wrote the first position paper. In the final year of the dialogue (1989), along with Hervé Legrand, then a professor at the Institut Catholique in Paris, on the Catholic side, he was the main drafter of the final document (&quot;Perspectives on Koinonia&quot;). This intense ecumenical engagement led Volf to explore the relation between the church as a community and the Trinity, and this topic became the subject of his &quot;Habilitationschrift&quot;.

The dissertation was published as &quot;Trinität und Gemeinschaft: Eine Ökumenische Ekklesiologie&quot; (1996; translated into English as &quot;After Our Likeness: The Church as the Image of the Triune God&quot;, 1998). Volf seeks to both show that a Free church ecclesiology is a theologically legitimate form of ecclesiology (a proposition denied by both Roman Catholic and Orthodox official teaching) and to give that typically individualistic ecclesiology focused on the lordship of Christ a more robustly communal character by tying it to the communal nature of God. Volf takes Joseph Ratzinger (Catholic, current pope emeritus Benedict XVI) and John Zizioulas (Orthodox bishop) as his dialogue partners, and critiques their anchoring of the communal and hierarchical nature of the church in hierarchical Trinitarian relations (both thinkers gives primacy to the &quot;One&quot;, though each does this in a different way). As an alternative, Volf proposes a non-hierarchical account of church as a community rooted in an egalitarian understanding of the Trinity (since hierarchy is, in his judgment, unthinkable with regard to three equally divine persons). Each member of the church has &quot;charisms&quot; for the common good of all in the church, without the strict need of the &quot;one&quot; to symbolize and guarantee unity (though the &quot;one&quot; might be needed for pragmatic rather than dogmatic reasons). Volf&#x27;s position is not, however, that hierarchical forms of ecclesiology are illegitimate. Though not ultimately ideal, in certain cultural settings hierarchical forms of the church may even be the best possible and therefore preferable ways of reflecting in the church the Trinitarian communion of the one God.

Parallel with pursuing these internal ecclesiological issues in light of ecumenical concerns, Volf explored the nature of the church&#x27;s presence and engagement in the world—partly to connect his &quot;charismatic&quot; understanding of mundane work (&quot;Work in the Spirit&quot;) with his &quot;charismatic&quot; understanding of the church (&quot;After Our Likeness&quot;). In a series of articles he developed an account of the church&#x27;s presence in the world as a &quot;soft&quot; and &quot;internal&quot; difference—roughly in contrast with either the &quot;hard&quot; difference of typically separatist (often Anabaptist) and transformationist (often Reformed) positions or the &quot;attenuated difference&quot; of those who tend to identify church and culture with each other (often Catholic and Orthodox stances) He has taken up and further developed this position in &quot;A Public Faith&quot; (2011). He sums it up as follows: &quot;Christian identity in a given culture is always a complex and flexible network of small and large refusals, divergences, subversions, and more or less radical and encompassing alternative proposals and enactments, surrounded by the acceptance of many cultural givens. There is no single way to relate to a given culture as a whole or even to its dominant thrust; there are only numerous ways of accepting, transforming, or replacing various aspects of a given culture from within&quot;.

===&quot;Exclusion and Embrace&quot;===
Volf is probably best known for &quot;Exclusion and Embrace: A Theological Exploration of Identity, Otherness, and Reconciliation&quot; (1996). It won the prestigious Grawemeyer Award for religion in 2002, and &quot;Christianity Today&quot; included it among its 100 most influential religious books of the twentieth century. The book grew out of a lecture Volf gave in Berlin in 1993, in which his task was to reflect theologically about the Yugoslav Wars, marked by ethnic cleansing, that was raging in his home country at the time.

&quot;Exclusion and Embrace&quot; deals with the challenges of reconciliation in contexts of persisting enmity in which no clear line can be drawn between victims and perpetrators and in which today&#x27;s victims become tomorrow&#x27;s perpetrators—conditions that arguably describe the majority of the world&#x27;s conflicts. The evocative &quot;embrace&quot; is the central category of the book, and Volf proposed it as an alternative to &quot;liberation&quot; (a category favored by a variety of liberation theologies). Embrace is marked by two key stances: acting with generosity toward the perpetrator and maintaining porous boundaries of flexible identities. Even though it is a modality of grace, &quot;embrace&quot; does not stand in contrast to justice; it includes justice as a dimension of grace extended toward wrongdoers. &quot;Embrace&quot; also does not stand in contrast to boundary maintenance. On the contrary, it presumes that it is essential to maintain the self&#x27;s boundaries (and therefore pass judgment), but suggests that these boundaries ought to be porous, so that the self, while not being obliterated, can make a journey with the other in reconciliation and mutual enrichment. Volf sees the father in the story of the prodigal son as an exemplar of this stance (the father forgave and accepted the change in his identity as &quot;the-father-of-the-prodigal&quot;). But supremely the stance is exemplified in the death of Christ on the cross for the ungodly (Christ, who assumed humanity, forgave and opened his arms to embrace). Central to Volf&#x27;s theology of the cross is Christ&#x27;s death as an &quot;inclusive substitute&quot; for the ungodly, which is to say Christ&#x27;s dying for them and making space &quot;in God&quot; for them. &quot;Solidarity with victims&quot;, central to his teacher Jürgen Moltmann&#x27;s &quot;theology of the cross&quot;, though dislodged from the center in Volf&#x27;s proposal, still remains a key aspect of God&#x27;s embrace of humanity.

For Volf, the practice of &quot;embrace&quot; is ultimately rooted in God&#x27;s Trinitarian nature—in God&#x27;s love, which is unconditional because it is the very being of God, and in the mutual indwelling of the divine persons (whose boundaries are therefore reciprocally porous). He succinctly articulated the Trinitarian underpinnings of his proposal in &quot;The Trinity is Our Social Program,&quot;, a text in which he both argues for a correspondence (on account of God&#x27;s indwelling presence) between God&#x27;s Trinitarian nature and human relations and stances, and underscores the ineradicable limitations of such correspondences. The primary limitation consists in the fact that, obviously, human beings are not God; the second consists in the fact that human beings are—equally obviously—sinful, which requires the human &quot;embrace&quot; to be an eschatological category. Volf&#x27;s main contribution to eschatology, partly triggered by making &quot;embrace&quot; an eschatological category, is his re-thinking of the &quot;Last Judgment.&quot; In &quot;The Final Reconciliation&quot; Volf argued that the Last Judgment ought to be understood as the final reconciliation in which judgment is not eliminated but seen as an indispensable element of reconciliation, a portal into the world of love.

===&quot;The End of Memory&quot;===
A central concern in &quot;Exclusion and Embrace&quot; is truth-telling in the context of enmity and conflict, especially truth-telling about the past. Volf&#x27;s &quot;The End Of Memory&quot; (2006) explores this theme in much greater depth. He argues that it isn’t enough that we remember the past (as Elie Wiesel, for instance, has done), but that we must remember the past rightly. There is a pragmatic and not just a cognitive dimension to memory. Memories concerned merely with the truth of what happened and oriented exclusively toward justice often become untruthful and unjust memories; the &quot;shield&quot; of memory then morphs into a &quot;sword,&quot; as can be seen in many parts of the world, including the region in which Volf grew up. The proper goal of memory should be reconciliation—&quot;embrace&quot;—which includes justice. In a novel move, Volf proposes that the sacred memory of Christ&#x27;s passion and resurrection, properly understood, should guide Christians’ remembering of wrongs committed and suffered.

The most controversial part of &quot;The End of Memory&quot; is Volf&#x27;s sustained theological argument, developed in dialogue with Sigmund Freud, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Søren Kierkegaard, that remembering wrongs suffered and committed, if done rightly, will ultimately result in non-remembrance of the wrongdoing. The world of love, which is the Christian eschatological hope, will be realized when people and their relationships are healed to such an extent that former wrongdoing would, for lack of affective fuel, no longer come to mind.

Volf traveled domestically and internationally and spoke extensively on issues of reconciliation—in China, India, Sri Lanka, Israel, South Africa, New Zealand, various European countries, and, of course, the United States. For instance, on the morning of 9/11/2001, at 8:34am when the first plane had hit the North Tower, he was finishing his keynote address at the International Prayer Breakfast at the United Nations. His topic was &quot;From Exclusion to Embrace: Reflections on Reconciliation.&quot;

===Interpretation of scripture===
An important feature of Volf&#x27;s work is the theological interpretation of the scriptures. He believes that any theology—whether it be &quot;liberal&quot; or &quot;evangelical&quot;, whether it be Roman Catholic, Orthodox, or Protestant—will wither if not nourished through Scriptural engagement and interpretation. Though the interpretation of biblical texts is not the exclusive or even primary mode of his theological work (as it is, for instance, for David F. Ford [with his &quot;scriptural reasoning&quot; project] or Michael Welker [with his &quot;realistic biblical theology&quot; project], many of his books contain sustained engagement with biblical texts. In &quot;Captive to the Word of God: Engaging the Scriptures for Contemporary Theological Reflection&quot; (2010) he has given both an account of why theological interpretation of biblical texts matters and how it should be undertaken and offered examples of such interpretations (dealing with John&#x27;s Gospel and Epistles, 1 Peter, Ecclesiastes, St. Paul&#x27;s writings). But many of his books—notably &quot;Exclusion and Embrace&quot;—contain sections with biblical interpretations.

===Interfaith engagement===
Volf has brought his theology of embrace to bear on how people of different faiths relate to each other. He participated actively in the work of The Elijah Interfaith Institute by writing Christian position papers—both on his own and with his students as co-authors—for the meetings of its Board of Religious Leaders and by participating in its meeting. For a number of years, Volf also participated in the Jewish–Christian dialogue. However, most of his interfaith efforts are directed to the relation between Christianity and Islam. He focuses on Islam partially because he comes from a region in which these two faiths have intersected for centuries (he was born in a city-fortress that the Holy Roman Emperor, Leopold I started building around 1700 to keep Ottoman Muslims at bay) and partly because he considers the relations between these two religions to be today&#x27;s most critical interfaith issue.

Since 2004 Volf has taken part in the Building Bridges Seminar, a yearly gathering of Muslim and Christian scholars chaired until 2012 by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams. His engagement with Islam intensified after the publication of &quot;A Common Word Between Us and You&quot; (2007). Occasioned by Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s speech at the University of Regensburg, but motivated by a deteriorated relationship between Christians and Muslims (especially in the wake of 9/11), the document, which was originally signed by 138 of the world&#x27;s most prominent Muslim leaders, argued that what binds Muslims and Christians (and Jews, of course) is the dual command to love God and love one&#x27;s neighbors. It proposes this common ground as a place of dialogue and cooperation between the two religions. Along with the staff at the Center for Faith and Culture (Joseph Cumming and Andrew Saperstein), Volf drafted Yale Divinity School&#x27;s response (&quot;Yale Response&quot;), which was endorsed by over 300 prominent Christian leaders (including some of the world&#x27;s most respected evangelical figures such as John Stott and Rick Warren).

&quot;Allah: A Christian Response&quot; (2011) is Volf&#x27;s major work engaging Islam. The book is an exercise in &quot;political theology&quot;; it explores the possibilities of peaceful co-existence of Muslims and Christians &quot;under the same political roof,&quot; rather than the merits of Islam and Christianity as systems of salvation (an area in which there is substantially more divergence between the two religions than in regard to moral values). The central question of the book is whether Muslims and Christians have a common God and whether, consequently, they have common or at least overlapping central values. In a dialogue with Nicholas of Cusa and Martin Luther, Volf develops his own method of assessing the issue and argues that Muslims and Christians do have a common God, even though each group understands God in different ways, at least in part. The most obvious differences concern the Christian belief that God is Love and that God is the Holy Trinity (though when it comes to the Trinity, Volf argues that Muslims objections seem directed at ideas that the great Christian teachers never actually affirmed). These differences notwithstanding, Christians and Muslims have similar accounts of the moral character of God and therefore of basic human values—the one Creator God who is different from the world is just and merciful, and God commands worshipers to do similar things (e.g., the Ten Commandments [minus the Fourth]; the Golden Rule). Love for and fear of that common God can, therefore, bring Muslims and Christians together, or at least be the basis for resolving conflicts without resorting to violence. As Volf sees it, in Allah as well as in his engagement with Islam more broadly, he is applying to interfaith relations the kind of generous engagement with the other that his theology of embrace recommends.

==Church theologian==
Volf started preaching early, before he was 18. While living in his native Croatia, he often taught in the church and served for a brief period as interim pastor of a church in Zagreb. In the United States, he continued to preach and teach in churches as well as appear on Christian radio and TV programs. True to his reputation as a &quot;theologian of the bridge,&quot; he addressed a wide variety of types of church groups, ranging from speaking to the conference of Episcopal bishops to preaching at Robert Schuller&#x27;s &quot;Hour of Power&quot;, from teaching for the Trinity Wall Street Church to giving an hour-long interview to James Kennedy Radio ministries, and much in between (such as speaking at conferences of Covenant, Adventist, Vineyard or &quot;Emergent Church&quot; pastors and church workers).

While doing his doctoral work and teaching in Croatia, Volf worked for the Croatian Christian monthly Ivori, re-designing and re-branding the magazine his father, then General Secretary of the Pentecostal Church in Yugoslavia, was publishing. As the magazine&#x27;s co-editor (1979–84) and editor (1984–89), he regularly wrote editorials and feature articles. These took up themes and staked out positions he would later develop in academic publications. Some of these texts were on issues at the intersection between faith and culture (as, for instance, those dealing with the religious dimensions of the poetry of the Serbian poet Aleksa Šantić, which were the seed for his first book, done in collaboration with the Croatian painter Marko Živković and titled I znam da sunce ne boji se tame [&quot;The Sun Doesn’t Fear Darkness&quot;]. Other texts were theological interpretations of biblical texts, notably of 1 Peter. Interest in culture broadly construed and in theological interpretation remained a significant feature of Volf&#x27;s theological work from then on, as did his commitment to writing for the church and not just for the academy.

When Volf moved to the United States, he continued to write for church audiences. He wrote occasional articles and gave interviews for Christianity Today, and for many years he wrote a regular column &quot;Faith Matters&quot; for &quot;The Christian Century&quot; (the collection of these is published as &quot;Against the Tide: Love in a Time of Petty Dreams and Great Enmities&quot; [2010]).

==Public theologian==
Volf&#x27;s theological work is predicated on the conviction that &quot;private&quot; and &quot;public&quot; spheres cannot be separated, though they must be distinguished. In recent years he has given increasing attention to the public dimensions and roles of faith.

From 2008-2011 Volf taught a course on &quot;Faith and Globalization&quot; with former British prime minister Tony Blair, an interdisciplinary course for students from all parts of Yale University. The assumption of the course was that globalization processes and faith traditions are some of the most powerful forces shaping today&#x27;s world and that the world&#x27;s future depends to a significant degree on how faiths relate to globalization and how, in the context of globalization, faiths relate to each other. Many themes of Volf&#x27;s work so far came together in this course—the relation between faith and economics, faith and reconciliation (and violence), interfaith relations, faith and politics (in particular, defense of democratic pluralism), and so on. Through this course and in his work with globalization more broadly, Volf is seeking to think through all these issues not from a generically human standpoint suspended above concrete traditions—which he believes does not exist—but from the perspective of the Christian faith.

In &quot;A Public Faith: How Followers of Christ Should Serve the Common Good&quot; (2011) Volf summed up his reflections over the years on how Christians should interact with the surrounding culture broadly conceived. He contends that with regard to the public realm Christians face two major dangers (&quot;malfunctions of faith,&quot; in his terminology): one is to withdraw from public life and to leave their faith &quot;idling&quot; in all spheres outside their private and church lives; the other is to be engaged, but to do so in a coercive way, shoving the demands of their faith down the throats of those who embrace other faiths or no faith at all. Positively, Volf argues against two extremes: against a complete separation of faith from public life, a kind of secularist exclusion of religion from public realm (and sectarian self-isolation), and against a complete saturation of public life by one dominant religion, a kind of religious totalitarianism. Against both secular exclusivists and religious totalitarians he contends that, in a world in which many faiths often live under a common roof, freedom of religion and the Golden Rule should guide how faiths relate to each other in the public space. As to the Christians’ own engagement, Volf contends that there is no single Christian way to relate to the broader culture as a whole. Instead, while remaining true to the convictions of their own faith, Christians should approach their larger cultures in an ad-hoc way, accepting or partly changing some aspects of culture, possibly completely withdrawing from still others, and cheerfully celebrating many others.

Over the years, in diverse settings Volf has brought faith to bear on a variety of more public issues. Examples include the following: He was a member of the Global Agenda Council on Faith and on Values of the World Economic Forum (2009–2011); he worked with the Advisory Council of President Obama&#x27;s Office of Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships; he gave a keynote address at the International Prayer Breakfast at the United Nations (on 9/11) and spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington (2010); he delivered a keynote address at the international Military Chief of Chaplains conference in Cape Town, South Africa (2008). He is also present in the media, giving interviews to major news organizations in this country (for instance, NPR, CNN, MSNBC) and abroad (for instance, Al Jazeera, HRT).

In 2003, Volf founded the Yale Center for Faith and Culture housed at Yale Divinity School. The goal of the center, which he still directs, is to promote the practice of faith in all spheres of life through theological research and leadership development.

<text>are traditional Japanese songs, similar to nursery rhymes. They are often sung as part of traditional children&#x27;s games. They are described as a form of min&#x27;yo: traditional Japanese songs, usually sung without accompanying instruments. 

The centuries-old lyrics are often incomprehensible to modern Japanese (especially to children who are singing it), and others can be quite sinister on close analysis. Like many children&#x27;s songs around the world, because people are used to them from an early age, they are often oblivious to the real meanings.

==Examples==
===Tōryanse===

&quot;Tōryanse&quot; is often played as an electronic tune at pedestrian crossings in Japan to signal when it is safe to cross.
Japanese:&lt;br&gt;
通りゃんせ　通りゃんせ&lt;br&gt;
ここはどこの　細通じゃ&lt;br&gt;
:天神さまの　細道じゃ
ちっと通して　下しゃんせ&lt;br&gt;
:御用のないもの　通しゃせぬ
この子の七つの　お祝いに&lt;br&gt;
お札を納めに　まいります&lt;br&gt;
:行きはよいよい　帰りはこわい
こわいながらも&lt;br&gt;
通りゃんせ　通りゃんせ&lt;br&gt;

Romaji:&lt;br&gt;
&quot; Tōryanse, tōryanse&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot; Koko wa doko no hosomichi ja?&quot;&lt;br&gt;
:&quot; Tenjin-sama no hosomichi ja&quot;
&quot; Chitto tōshite kudashanse&quot;&lt;br&gt;
:&quot; Goyō no nai mono tōshasenu&quot;
&quot; Kono ko no nanatsu no oiwai ni&quot;&lt;br&gt;

This particular warabe-uta is sung as part of a traditional game identical to &quot;London Bridge Is Falling Down&quot;. Two children facing each other link their hands to form an arch &#x27;checkpoint&#x27;, and the remaining children walk through underneath in a line (and back round again in circles). The child who happens to be under the arch when the song finishes is then &#x27;caught&#x27;.

The tune is played at Japanese pedestrian crossings by analogy with this game, i.e., it is safe to cross until the music stops.

===Teru-teru-bōzu===

A teru teru bōzu is a little traditional hand-made doll which supposedly brings sunshine. &quot;Teru&quot; is a Japanese verb which describes sunshine, and a &quot;bōzu&quot; is a Buddhist monk. Children make teru-teru-bōzu out of tissue paper and a string and hang them from a window to wish for sunny weather. There is a famous warabe uta which is about the small ghost-like dolls which people can see hanging on rainy days.
Japanese:&lt;br&gt;

&quot; but if it&#x27;s cloudy and I find you crying (i.e. it&#x27;s raining)&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot; Then I shall snip your head off&quot;&lt;br&gt;
The lyrics are allegedly about a story of a monk who promised farmers to stop rain and bring clear weather during a prolonged period of rain which was ruining crops. When the monk failed to bring sunshine, he was executed.

===Yuki===

 is a song Japanese children sing when it&#x27;s snowing and they want to play outside. &#x27;Yuki&#x27; means &#x27;Snow&#x27; in Japanese. The song is also commonly known as 雪やこんこ (Yuki ya konko) The snow falls densely.

Japanese:&lt;br&gt;
雪やこんこ 霰やこんこ&lt;br&gt;
降っては降っては ずんずん積る&lt;br&gt;
山も野原も 綿帽子かぶり&lt;br&gt;
枯木残らず 花が咲く&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
雪やこんこ 霰やこんこ&lt;br&gt;
降っても降っても まだ降りやまぬ&lt;br&gt;
犬は喜び 庭駈けまわり&lt;br&gt;
猫は火燵で 丸くなる&lt;br&gt;

Romaji:&lt;br&gt;
&quot; yuki ya konko, arare ya konko&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot; futtewa futtewa zunzun tsumoru&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot; yama mo nohara mo wataboshi kaburi&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot; kareki nokorazu hana ga saku&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot; yuki ya konko, arare ya konko&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot; futtemo, futtemo, mada furiyamanu&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot; inu wa yorokobi, niwa kakemawari&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot; neko wa kotatsu de marukunaru&quot;&lt;br&gt;

Translation:&lt;br&gt;
&quot; The snow falls densely, the hail falls densely!&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot; It&#x27;s falling and falling, collecting more and more.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot; The mountains and the fields are also wearing their cotton hats,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot; and in every tree flowers bloom.&quot; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot; The snow falls densely, the hail falls densely!&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot; It&#x27;s still falling and falling, never stopping.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot; The dog is happy, running around the garden,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot; the cat is curled up under the kotatsu.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
A kotatsu is a low, heated table. In the first stanza, flowers blooming in winter probably refers to the snow collecting on empty branches. The literal translation of the line is something like &quot;No withered trees remaining, flowers bloom&quot;.

<text>The African silverbill (Euodice cantans) is a small passerine bird formerly considered conspecific with the Asian species Indian silverbill, (&quot;Euodice malabarica&quot;). This estrildid finch is a common resident breeding bird in dry savanna habitat, south of the Sahara Desert. This species has also been introduced to other countries such as Portugal, Qatar and United States.

==Taxonomy==
The African silverbill was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin under the binomial name &quot;Loxia cantans&quot;. The specific epithet is from Latin and means &quot;singing&quot;. Gmemlin specified the locality as Africa but this was restricted to Dakar in Senegal by William Lutley Sclater and Cyril Mackworth-Praed in 1918. It is now placed with the Indian silverbill in the genus &quot;Euodice&quot; that was introduced in 1862 by the German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach.

In early literature, the African silverbill and the Indian silverbill (&quot;E. malabarica&quot;) were treated as conspecific. In 1943, Jean Théodore Delacour united both species in his revision of the Estrildinae. However, in 1964, Colin Harrison studied the two in a strictly comparative manner and concluded that they were two separate species. He discovered that although the call notes were similar, the songs are distinctly different in form, but sharing a common pattern. They are sympatric in the south of the Arabian Peninsula and there is no record of natural hybridization. From Harrison&#x27;s personal observation of birds in captivity, each of the two forms evinced a preference for its own kind. A molecular phylogenetic study of the Estrildidae published in 2020 found that the African and Indian silverbills were sister species that had diverged around one million years ago. The two species formed a clade that was basal to members of the genus &quot;Lonchura&quot;.

===Subspecies===
Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;E. c. cantans&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1789) – Mauritania, Senegal and Gambia to south Sudan
* &quot;E. c. orientalis&quot; (Lorenz von Liburnau, L &amp; Hellmayr, 1901) – south Arabian Peninsula, east Sudan to Somalia and south to Tanzania

==Description==
The African silverbill is approximately in length with a long black pointed tail. The adult has a stubby silver-blue bill, finely vermiculated light-brown upper parts, whitish underparts, black rump and black wings. The sexes are similar, but immatures lack the vermiculations. This species has a &quot;tseep&quot; call and a trilling song. The contact call of the male is a single &quot;tseep&quot; while the female is a double noted &quot;tsiptsip&quot;. Birds in flight keep up a constant &quot;tseep tseep tseep&quot;.

The subspecies &quot;E. c. orientalis&quot; is darker on the face and upperparts than the other subspecies.

==Distribution and habitat==
The species is widespread in savanna country, arid landscape with thorn bush, and grasslands with acacias or dry grassland. It may also be found in cultivated areas and dry grassland. It is by nature a bird of dry country. It is primarily a lowland species but can be found up to altitude.

==Behaviour==
The African silverbill is tame and sociable, often found perching in trees in dense flocks, touching one another. However, it is a particularly inactive bird, sitting huddled together for a long period of time. It stays in flocks all year round and usually breeds in loose colony.

===Feeding===
The African silverbill feeds mostly on grass seeds, picked from the ground but also taken from the growing plants if available. It will cling to grass stems to take seeds from the inflorescences. It seems that it feeds mainly on vegetable matter and rearing its young on seed as well. However, it has been recorded to take aphids from water mint (Meinertzhagen 1954).

===Courtship===
The male displays by grasping a stem of grass at one end, and hops or files to near the female. At once he sleeks down his feathers, stands upright with tail straight down, and jerks his head upwards a few times. He then leans forward, twists his tail towards the female and fluffs his flank and belly feathers. At this stage he usually drops the straw and begins to sing and dance. The flank and ventral feathers are not always fluffed out, and the intensity of the display probably depends on the relationship of the two birds. If the female seems receptive the male will attempt copulation. However, most displays come to an end before this final phase is reached. Successful mating is usually followed by a little bill fencing and mutual preening (Baptista and Horblit 1990).

===Breeding===
The nest of the African silverbill is usually built in the form of a roundish bundle of grasses. It is lined with soft fibres and sometimes feathers, and may be placed in a thick bush or hedge or amongst the creepers on a house. The male is recorded in the wild as collecting all the nesting material (Meinertzhagen 1954), while the female only shares in construction.

The clutch varies from three to six oval, smooth white eggs. The female incubates during the day, and though the male may relieve her when she leaves the nest to feed. It has been suggested that the male does not actually brood (Soderberg 1956). They are both at nest at night. The incubation period is about eleven to thirteen days average, and the young fledging in about twenty-one days and becoming independent within a month of fledging.

Newly hatched young are dark and have waxy-looking yellow gape swellings. The plate has a single heavy black circle inside the white mouth flange, which embraces the upper and lower parts of the gape.

==Threats==
The African silverbill is currently trapped for the cage bird trade. However, its numbers and its considerable range mean that this is unlikely to have any impact on the species&#x27; survival.

<text>The Texas A&amp;M Transportation Institute (TTI) in Bryan/College Station, Texas is a transportation research agency in the United States. The institute was created in 1950, primarily in response to the needs of the Texas Highway Department (now the Texas Department of Transportation). TTI is a state agency and a member of the Texas A&amp;M University System.

Over 100 TTI researchers publish papers and give presentations at the Transportation Research Board (TRB) annual meeting, with around 50 serving on TRB committees. Since the inception of the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) in 1962, TTI has led over 70 NCHRP projects, more than any other participant in the program.

The institute maintains a close association with the Texas A&amp;M University Dwight Look College of Engineering, the College of Architecture, and the George Bush School of Government and Public Service, as well as other academic units within the Texas A&amp;M University System and at other collaborating universities. Over 40 TTI researchers hold joint academic positions at Texas A&amp;M University. TTI also plays a role in training and educating students; one-third of the staff is students.

Headquartered on the Texas A&amp;M University System RELLIS Campus in Bryan, Texas, TTI also maintains a roadside safety proving ground facility there, and has offices in Arlington, Austin, Dallas, Doha, El Paso, Fort Worth, Galveston, Houston, Mexico City, San Antonio, Waco, and Washington, D.C.

==Notable research projects==
ET2000 – In 1991, the TTI-patented ET2000 guardrail end treatment was developed. Over 250,000 units have been shipped throughout the United States and around the world. TxDOT and TTI received the Federal Highway Administration&#x27;s (FHWA) 1991 Administrator&#x27;s Biennial Safety Award for their development of the ET2000.

Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) – GPR is a nondestructive geophysical method that &quot;sees&quot; underground and produces a record of subsurface features—without drilling, probing, digging, or coring. Since 1988, researchers at TTI have been developing, testing, and implementing GPR technology for TxDOT to use in its road repair and maintenance activities.

Roadway Congestion Index (RCI) – To evaluate mobility levels on Texas streets and freeways, TTI developed the RCI, which is now computed annually for over 85 major U.S. cities.

Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) – TTI&#x27;s ITS research has been implemented in several major Texas cities. Real-time train detection and analysis systems have expedited emergency vehicle dispatch, enhanced signal operations, and averted major accidents.

HOV Lanes and Managed Lanes – Since the 1980s, many major metropolitan areas have developed HOV or High Occupancy Vehicle lanes to help with traffic flow and provide incentives for carpooling and public transit. TTI has become known as the nation&#x27;s leader in HOV lane research. Some cities have taken the HOV lane concept one step further in the development of what&#x27;s being called Managed Lanes.

Teens in the Driver Seat – TTI has developed a peer-to-peer driving safety program. Teens in the Driver Seat relies on young drivers themselves to create safety messages and then serve as the messengers to make their peers aware of the risks of teen driving.

<doc id="686229" wikidata="Q28847333" url="?curid=686229" title="Bronze mannikin">
<text>The bronze mannikin or bronze munia (Spermestes cucullata) is a small passerine (i.e. perching) bird of the Afrotropics. This very social estrildid finch is an uncommon to locally abundant bird in much of Africa south of the Sahara Desert, where it is resident, nomadic or irruptive in mesic savanna or forest margin habitats. It has an estimated global extent of occurrence of 8,100,000 km2. It is the smallest and most widespread of four munia species on the African mainland, the other being black-and-white, red-backed and magpie mannikin. It co-occurs with the Madagascar mannikin on the Comoro Islands, and was introduced to Puerto Rico. Especially in the West Africa, it is considered a pest in grain and rice fields. It is locally trapped for the pet bird trade.

==Taxonomy==
The bronze mannikin was formally described in 1837 by the English naturalist William Swainson and given the binomial name &quot;Spermestes cucullata&quot;. The specific epithet is from Late Latin &quot;cucullatus&quot; meaning &quot;hooded&quot;. The type locality is Senegal.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;S. c. cucullata&quot; Swainson, 1837 – Senegal and Gambia to south Sudan, Uganda, west Kenya and the island of Bioko
* &quot;S. c. scutata&quot; Heuglin, 1863 – Ethiopia and east Kenya to southeast South Africa, east Angola and Comoro Islands

==Description==

The bronze mannikin is one of the smallest munia species, measuring 9–10 cm in length and weighing 7–12 grams. The adult is a compact bird with a short black tail, and stubby black and pale grey (not distinctly bluish) mandibles. It is black to brownish black on the head, chin, throat and center of the chest, with some purple-green iridescence on the face and sides of the breast. It has greyish brown upper parts and white underparts with irregular barring on the flanks and rump. A small green iridescent patch is present on the outer scapular feathers, besides, especially in the western race, the sides of the lower breast. Wing coverts and remiges are bordered in a paler or warmer tone. The sexes are similar. Immature birds are dun brown above with buff head and underpart plumage. They moult into full adult plumage by age six months, when the males also begin to sing and exhibit breeding behaviour. The race &quot;S. c. scutata&quot; has barred rather than bronzy green plumage at the junction of the lower breast and flanks. Rump and upper tail feathers only finely barred and almost uniformly dark. These characters are however somewhat variable and unpredictable.

This species has a number of calls including a &quot;&quot; in flight, a twittering when perched, consisting of various wheezy or buzzing notes. The song is a concatenated and somewhat repetitive series of notes.

==Distribution and habitat==
The bronze mannikin is native to mainland Africa and the Bioko, Pemba, Zanzibar, Mafia and Comoro islands, and has been introduced to Puerto Rico, where it is established. The two accepted races have an extensive region around the upper Nile River which is inhabited by birds with intermediate features. A proposed third race, &quot;S. c.&quot; subsp. &quot;tressellata&quot; is not generally recognized.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The bronze mannikin is a tiny gregarious bird which feeds mainly on seeds, including wild grass seeds, millet, rice and grain. Alternatively termites, nectar or strands of algae may also be eaten. Before going to roost at nightfall, they usually visit a watering hole where vegetation is hanging into the water. They roost at night in ball-shaped nests, which in the non-breeding season are built solely for this purpose. These slovenly communal roosting nests are dismantled (for reuse of material) and rebuilt almost daily at the same or a new location, in a communal effort. Each party, numbering 8 to 20 birds, seems to be dominated by a single adult male. The flock defends the immediate vicinity of a nest against intruders, but newcomers to a flock are easily accepted. They may associate with waxbill or other mannikin species, and may also use their vacated nests. Pairs often allopreen.

===Breeding===
They are incessant nest builders that may raise up to four broods a year, given favourable circumstances. The nest is a large domed grass structure in a tree, into which 4 to 8 small, white eggs are laid. Incubation takes 12 days, and chicks fledge after three weeks, and are independent in another three weeks. The chicks are reared on soft green seeds and insects.

<text>Martin Erat () (born August 29, 1981) is a Czech former professional ice hockey player. He played in the National Hockey League for the Nashville Predators, Washington Capitals and the Phoenix/Arizona Coyotes.

==Playing career==
Erat was selected in the seventh round, 191st overall, of the 1999 NHL Entry Draft by the Nashville Predators, the team&#x27;s 12th choice in the draft

Erat made a splash in his NHL rookie year in 2001–02 as a member of the &quot;vowel line&quot;, which consisted of himself on left wing, Vladimír Országh on right wing and Denis Arkhipov at centre. His first NHL point was a game-winning goal against the Calgary Flames on October 11, 2001. That year, he set a then Nashville rookie record for games played (80), assists (24) and points (33).

Erat struggled in his sophomore season in 2002–03 and spent the majority of the season with the Predators&#x27; American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Milwaukee Admirals. After changing his number from 19 to 10 in the off-season, his play improved in his third season, 2003–04. He notched then career highs with goals (16), assists (33) and points (49), also ranking second on the team with a +10 plus-minus rating. Erat&#x27;s first Stanley Cup playoff point was an assist in the 2004 Western Conference Quarterfinals in a 2–1 loss to the Detroit Red Wings on April 10, 2004.

During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Erat played for HC Zlín of the Czech Extraliga, where he finished eighth in the league in scoring with 20 goals and 23 assists in 48 games.

In 2005–06, Erat scored a career-high 20 goals in his fourth season with the Predators, tallying 49 points. He also played for the Czech national team at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, where he helped the team secure a bronze medal.

During the 2006–07 season, Erat emerged as a legitimate first-line player, tallying 57 points in 68 games. Most often, Erat teamed with Paul Kariya and David Legwand to form the team&#x27;s top unit. However, Erat missed the final five weeks of the season with a torn medial collateral ligament (MCL).

In 2007–08, Erat posted a new career-high of 23 goals and added 34 assists to once again reach the 57-point plateau. Following the 2007–08 season, he signed a seven-year, $31.5 million contract extension with the Predators. He has two career hat-tricks, the first against the Edmonton Oilers and the second against the Vancouver Canucks on December 8, 2009.

On April 3, 2013, the Predators traded Erat and Michael Latta to the Washington Capitals at the NHL trade deadline in exchange for prospect Filip Forsberg. Erat requested the trade away from Nashville and waived a no-trade clause in his contract to facilitate the deal.

On November 25, 2013, Erat requested a trade for the second time since being traded to the Capitals, just eight months prior. Erat first asked for a trade in October after being demoted to the team&#x27;s fourth line. Erat&#x27;s second request for a trade came after he was a healthy scratch for the first time in his career. Erat has said he would waive his no-trade clause, claiming it is &quot;time to move on&quot;.




On the eve of the 2013–14 NHL trade deadline, on March 4, Erat was traded (alongside John Mitchell) to the Phoenix Coyotes in exchange for Chris Brown, Rostislav Klesla and a fourth-round pick in 2015.

After 13 seasons and 881 regular season games in the NHL, Erat left North America as a free agent and signed a one-year contract with Russian club Avangard Omsk of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) on September 17, 2015. In May 2016, he returned to the Czech Extraliga and signed a contract with HC Kometa Brno. On April 19, 2017, Erat helped the team claim its 12th championship, after a 51-year drought. Erat retired on May 30, 2019.

==International play==
Erat played for the Czech Republic national team at the 2001 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, helping the team win the gold medal. In 2006, he played for the bronze medal-winning Czech team at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. That same year, Erat was also a member of the silver medal-winning team from the 2006 IIHF World Championship in Riga.

Erat was called up to replace Vladimír Sobotka on the Czech team for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Erat reprised his role on the Czech team in the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.

==Personal==
Martin has an older brother, Roman, who played for HC Kometa Brno in the Czech Extraliga.

<doc id="686240" wikidata="Q1935175" url="?curid=686240" title="Havana Conference">
<text>The Havana Conference of 1946 was a historic meeting of United States Mafia and Cosa Nostra leaders in Havana, Cuba. Supposedly arranged by Charles &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano, the conference was held to discuss important mob policies, rules, and business interests. The Havana Conference was attended by delegations representing crime families throughout the United States. The conference was held during the week of December 22, 1946, at the Hotel Nacional. The Havana Conference is considered to have been the most important mob summit since the Atlantic City Conference of 1929. Decisions made in Havana resonated throughout US crime families during the ensuing decades.

==Background==

The conference took place at the Hotel Nacional de Cuba. The reported organizer of the Havana Conference was crime boss Lucky Luciano. At the beginning of World War II, Luciano was serving a 30-to-50-year prison term for pandering. In 1942, U.S. military intelligence officers approached Joseph &quot;Socks&quot; Lanza and Meyer Lansky with a proposal for Luciano. At that time, Lanza was one of the Mafia bosses who controlled Manhattan&#x27;s Fulton Fish Market, its workers, and the docks in Lower Manhattan. Lansky had broader power in cities along the Atlantic Seaboard. Military intelligence was worried about possible Nazi sabotage of docks and other shipping facilities in New York and other East Coast ports. The government told Luciano that if his family was able to protect East Coast ports from sabotage, he would be pardoned at the end of the war and deported to Italy as a free man. Luciano agreed to the proposal and assisted the government.

After the war ended, New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey agreed to Luciano&#x27;s pardon on the condition that he never be allowed back into the U.S. In February 1946, after a lavish farewell party on the ocean liner, Luciano sailed back to Italy. He first settled in Lercara Friddi, Sicily, then moved to Palermo, Naples, and Rome. After being forced out of Rome by Italian police, he finally settled in Naples and immediately started planning a return to the United States.

In early fall 1946, Luciano received a sealed envelope from a recently deported U.S. mafioso, which contained three words, &quot;December-Hotel Nacional.&quot; In late September, Luciano obtained two Italian passports issued in his real name, Salvatore Lucania, with visas for Mexico, Cuba, and several South American nations. Luciano was now able to visit the Western Hemisphere and meet with criminal associates from the U.S.

In late October, Luciano traveled from Italy to Caracas, Venezuela, Mexico City, and finally Havana. Lansky greeted his old friend on his arrival in Cuba. Following Luciano&#x27;s orders, Lansky had organized a conference in Havana the week of December 22 of crime bosses from all over the United States. Lansky quickly suggested that Luciano purchase a $150,000 interest in the Hotel Nacional, a plush casino and hotel owned by Lansky and his silent partner, Cuban president Fulgencio Batista y Zaldívar. Luciano agreed and the Havana Conference was set.

In December 1946, the Havana Conference started as planned. To welcome Luciano back from exile and acknowledge his continued authority within the mob, all the conference invitees brought Luciano cash envelopes. These &quot;Christmas Presents&quot; totalled more than $200,000. At the first night dinner hosted by Lansky, Frank Costello, and Joe Adonis, Luciano was presented with the money. The official cover story for the Havana Conference was that the mobsters were attending a gala party with Frank Sinatra as the entertainment. Sinatra flew to Havana with Al Capone cousins, Charlie, Rocco, and Joseph Fischetti from Chicago. Joseph &quot;Joe Fish&quot; Fischetti, an old Sinatra acquaintance, acted as Sinatra&#x27;s chaperone and bodyguard. Charlie and Rocco Fischetti delivered a suitcase containing $2 million to Luciano, his share of the U.S. rackets he still controlled.

The most pressing items on the conference agenda were the leadership and authority within the New York mafia, the mob-controlled Havana casino interests, the narcotics operations, and the West Coast operations of Benjamin &quot;Bugsy&quot; Siegel, especially the new Flamingo Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. Luciano, absent from the American underworld scene for several months, was especially concerned with the situation in New York. Boss Vito Genovese had returned to New York from exile in Italy and was not content with assuming a minor role in the organization.

==The conference begins==
The Havana Conference convened on December 20, 1946. Delegates were present representing New York City, New Jersey, Buffalo, Chicago, New Orleans, and Florida. The largest delegation of bosses was from the New York-New Jersey area. Several major bosses from the Jewish Syndicate were at the conference to discuss joint La Cosa Nostra-Jewish Syndicate business. According to conference rules, the Jewish delegates could not vote on Cosa Nostra rules or policies; however, the Jewish crime bosses were allowed input on any joint business ventures, such as the Flamingo Hotel.

Luciano opened the Havana Conference by discussing a topic that would greatly affect his authority within the American Mafia; the position of &quot;capo di tutti capi&quot; (&quot;boss of all bosses&quot;). The last official boss of all bosses had been Salvatore Maranzano, who was murdered in September 1931. By the end of 1931, Luciano had eliminated this top position and re-organized the Italian mafia into &quot;Cosa Nostra&quot;, or &quot;This Thing of Ours&quot;. A board of directors, commonly called the &quot;Commission&quot;, had been formed to oversee criminal activities, control rules, and set policies. &quot;Cosa Nostra&quot; thus became the top criminal organization within the National Crime Syndicate.

Luciano could easily have declared himself as Maranzano&#x27;s heir in 1932; instead, he decided to exercise control behind the scenes. This arrangement had worked until Vito Genovese&#x27;s return from Italy. Officially, Genovese was now just a caporegime; however, he had made it clear that he intended to take control of the Luciano crime family. Since Luciano&#x27;s deportation in 1946, Luciano ally Frank Costello had been the acting boss of the Luciano family. As a result, tensions between the Costello and Genovese factions had started to fester. Luciano had no intention of stepping down as family boss; he had to do something about Genovese. Luciano also realized that Genovese threatened his overall authority and influence within the American mafia, probably with support from other crime bosses. Therefore, Luciano decided to resurrect the boss of all bosses position and claim it for himself. He hoped the other bosses would support him, either by officially affirming the title or at least by acknowledging that he was still &quot;First Amongst Equals&quot;.

At the conference, Luciano allegedly presented the motion to retain his position as the top boss in La Cosa Nostra. Then Luciano ally, Albert &quot;The Mad Hatter&quot; Anastasia seconded the motion. Anastasia voted with Luciano because he felt threatened by Genovese&#x27;s attempts to muscle in on his waterfront rackets. Checkmated by the Luciano-Costello-Anastasia alliance, Genovese was forced to swallow his ambitions and plan for the future. To further embarrass Genovese, Luciano encouraged Anastasia and Genovese to settle their differences and shake hands in front of the other bosses. This symbolic gesture was meant to prevent another bloody gang war such as the Castellammarese War of 1930–1931. With Luciano solidifying his personal position and squashing Genovese&#x27;s ambition for now, Luciano brought up discussion of the mob&#x27;s narcotics operations in the United States.

==Narcotics trade==
One of the key topics at the Havana Convention was the global narcotics trade and the mob&#x27;s operations in the United States. A longstanding myth has been the supposed refusal of Luciano and Cosa Nostra to deal in narcotics. In reality, only a few bosses such as Frank Costello and the other bosses who controlled lucrative gambling empires opposed narcotics. The anti-drug faction believed that Cosa Nostra did not need narcotics profits, that narcotics brought unwanted law enforcement and media attention, and that the general public considered it to be a very harmful activity (unlike gambling). The pro-drug faction said that narcotics were far more profitable than any other illegal activity. Furthermore, if Cosa Nostra ignored the drug trade, other criminal organizations would jump in and eventually diminish Cosa Nostra&#x27;s power and influence.

Luciano himself had a long involvement in the drug trade, starting as a small time street dealer in the late 1910s. In 1928, after the murder of Arnold &quot;The Big Bankroll&quot; Rothstein, Luciano and Louis &quot;Lepke&quot; Buchalter took over Rothstein&#x27;s large drug importation operation. Since the 1920s, Cosa Nostra had been involved in drug importation (heroin, cocaine, and marijuana) into North America. In the 1930s, the organization started transporting narcotics from the East Asia Golden Triangle and South America to Cuba and into Florida. The American mob had a longtime association with the government of Cuba concerning gambling interests such as casinos along with their legitimate business investments on the Caribbean island. This put them in a position to use their political and underworld connections to make Cuba one of their narcotics importation layovers or smuggling points where the drugs could be stored. They were then placed on sea vessels before they continued on to Canada and the United States via Montreal and Florida among the ports used by Luciano&#x27;s associates.

With Luciano&#x27;s deportation to Italy, he now had the opportunity to import heroin from North Africa via Italy and Cuba into the US and Canada. Luciano made connections with Sicily&#x27;s biggest bosses such as Don Calogero &quot;Calo&quot; Vizzini of Villalba who assisted the Allies&#x27; invasion of Sicily and had the greatest political connections of all the Sicilian bosses. Also, Don Pasquale Ania, a powerful boss in Palermo who had connections to legitimate pharmaceutical companies because large-scale heroin manufacturing in Italy was legal at the time.

During the Havana Conference, Luciano detailed the proposed drugs network to the bosses. After arriving in Cuba from North Africa, the mob would ship the narcotics to US ports that it controlled, primarily New York City, New Orleans, and Tampa. The narcotics shipped to the New York docks would be overseen by the Luciano crime family (later the Genovese) and the Mangano crime family (later the Gambino). In New Orleans, the operation would be overseen by the Marcello crime family, led by Carlos &quot;Little Man&quot; Marcello. In Tampa, the narcotics shipments would be overseen by the Trafficante crime family led by Santo Trafficante, Jr. The Havana Convention delegates voted to approve the plan.

Luciano built a massive drug organization spanning Italy and America. One of Luciano&#x27;s narcotics lieutenants in Siculiana, Sicily was his old associate from New York, Nicola &quot;Zu Cola&quot; Gentile who oversaw all drug operations in the Agrigento province for Lucky Luciano and his partner Don Giuseppe Settecasi, the capo-provincial of Agrigento. A top Luciano lieutenant in the &quot;Caneba Network&quot; of mainland Italy was Antonio Farina, who would ship the narcotics to their U.S. partners in New York&#x27;s Mangano crime family including Albert Anastasia, Frank &quot;Don Cheech&quot; Scalise, Jack Scarpulla, Peter Beddia and Matthew &quot;Matty&quot; Cuomo.

Long time Luciano ally Frank &quot;Fingers&quot; Coppola ran the Sicilian &quot;Partinico Clan&quot;. This was a satellite group affiliated with the Detroit Partnership or Zerilli crime family led by boss Joseph &quot;Joe Z.&quot; Zerilli and fellow bosses and Detroit allies, John &quot;Papa John&quot; Priziola, Angelo Meli, and Rafaelle Quasarano. The Detroit crime family then shipped the narcotics to their New York contacts, Giovanni &quot;Big John&quot; Ormento, of the Lucchese crime family, Carmine &quot;Lilo&quot; Galante and Natale &quot;Joe Diamonds&quot; Evola of the Bonanno crime family, Frank &quot;Cheech&quot; Livorsi of the Luciano crime family, and Joseph &quot;Joe Bandy&quot; Biondo of the Mangano crime family. These East Coast contacts would then distribute the drugs all along the East Coast.

Other Luciano lieutenants working mainland Italy included American deportees, Frank Barone and Giuseppe Arena in Rome, Frank Pirico, Frank Saverino and Giovanni Maugeri in Milan, Salvatore DiBella in Naples, and former Mangano crime family soldier, Joseph &quot;Joe Peachy&quot; Pici in Milan and Genoa. Other U.S. distribution groups that worked with Luciano and his allies were &quot;The Bellanca Gang&quot;, brothers Antonio, Joseph, and Sebastiano &quot;Benny Blanca&quot; Bellanca and Gaetano &quot;Tommy&quot; Martino of the Mangano crime family. Then there was the group of Settimo &quot;Big Sam&quot; Accardi, Joseph &quot;Hoboken Joe&quot; Stassi and his brothers James &quot;Jake&quot; and Anthony, Anthony Granza, Vincent Ferrara and Louis Cirillo who worked for Albert &quot;The Mad Hatter&quot; Anastasia and Carlo &quot;Carl&quot; Gambino. Even with all the growing animosity Lucky Luciano couldn&#x27;t leave out his old associate, Vito &quot;Don Vito&quot; Genovese who had his group of distributors including Anthony &quot;Tony Bender&quot; Strollo, Vincent &quot;Vinnie Bruno&quot; Mauro, Frank &quot;The Bug&quot; Caruso, Salvatore &quot;Sam&quot; Maneri, Vincent &quot;Chin&quot; Gigante and even Joseph &quot;Joe Cago&quot; Valachi who were all associated with the &quot;Papalia-Agueci Network&quot; of the Magaddino crime family of Buffalo and led by members Johnny &quot;Pops&quot; Papalia and Alberto Agueci of Hamilton and Toronto, Ontario.

At first the Mafia&#x27;s operation was one of many individual operations connected or affiliated to the French-Corsican Mob or Unione Corse&#x27;s famous &quot;French Connection&quot; heroin distribution ring. By the late 1950s the Sicilians and Americans organized a joint U.S. and Sicilian La Cosa Nostra narcotics operation that would eventually grow into one of the largest global narcotics operations ever. This famous joint U.S.-Sicilian operation came to be known as the Pizza Connection and was cemented between the two mafia organizations at the famous mafia summit held at the Grand Hotel des Palmes in Palermo, Sicily in October, 1957.

Salvatore and Ugo Caneba assisted Luciano and were the overseers of the famous heroin operation they controlled from mainland Italy to the United States, the Caneba Network which supplied high grade pharmaceutical quality heroin. Luciano&#x27;s narcotics network was big and complex and he had many of his old, deported former U.S. allies to help him run his empire throughout the late 1940s. The main drug imported by Luciano&#x27;s network at the time was heroin and the main sources were French underworld clans that made up the core of the Unione Corse Syndicate, or French Mob. The Corsican Clan was headed by powerful bosses Antoine D&#x27;Agostino, Jean Baptiste Croce, and Paul Mondolini, while the Marseilles Clan was made up of four groups. These four powerful groups included brothers Antoine and Barthelemy &quot;Meme&quot; Guerini, brothers Dominique and Jean Venturi, brothers Marcel, Xavier and Jean Francisci, and Joseph Orsini. Auguste Joseph Ricord was another boss that became part of the Unione Corse in the 1960s-70s. These two clans ruled the French underworld from the late 1940s to the late 1960s, supplying Luciano and his mafia allies with large amounts of heroin until the heroin ring known as the French Connection started to crumble in 1972 with the arrest of one of its biggest bosses, Auguste Joseph Ricord.

The Luciano narcotics empire continued to grow and prosper with the help of his U.S. associates. Many of Luciano&#x27;s partners in the narcotics empire were Havana Conference delegates such as Joseph &quot;The Old Man&quot; Profaci who was once the biggest importer of olive oil and tomato paste in the United States and quietly used his food importation business to smuggle narcotics for decades, Gaetano &quot;Tommy Brown&quot; Lucchese, a longtime Luciano ally from their days as children in the streets of New York and who, along with his Lucchese crime family&#x27;s narcotics distribution arm, the 107th St. Crew, which controlled all heroin distribution in Harlem, New York. Without a doubt one of the architects of the American heroin network and a partner of Luciano is well known and powerful New York mafia boss, Joseph &quot;Joe Bananas&quot; Bonanno, the patriarch of the Bonanno crime family, who along with the assistance of his cousin, Buffalo crime family boss Stefano &quot;The Undertaker&quot; Magaddino led the American mafia&#x27;s expansion into Canada. Bonanno&#x27;s and Magaddino&#x27;s crime families in New York and Buffalo opened up Montreal and Toronto in the 1950s as satellite groups or individual operations connected with the famous French Connection, but eventually the satellite groups would grow into their own powerful crime families and control massive narcotics distribution networks that still operate even today, all of the narcotics networks mentioned help destroy the myth that Charlie Luciano and La Cosa Nostra were against narcotics. When Cuban president Fulgencio Batista y Zaldivar was eventually overthrown by Fidel Castro in 1959, the mob had to look elsewhere for a landing and storage facility for their narcotics shipments.

==The Siegel Situation==

The next item on the agenda at the Havana Conference was what Lansky called the &quot;Siegel Situation&quot;. In the mid-1930s, the New York and Chicago crime families had been sent west to establish and oversee a race wire service, gambling activities in Los Angeles and Nevada, and supervise narcotics shipments from Mexico. In a short while, Benjamin &quot;Bugsy&quot; Siegel had become a popular and visible figure in Hollywood&#x27;s most glamorous circles.

The Flamingo Hotel was the creation of Billy Wilkerson, a Hollywood nightclub owner and one of the founders of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;. By the mid-1940s, it was still unfinished. This Flamingo Hotel project became Siegel&#x27;s obsession. Siegel persuaded his longtime friend and business associate Meyer Lansky to help him sell New York and Chicago crime bosses on investing in this project. Siegel promised the bosses that the hotel and casino would be a smart and profitable investment.

The Flamingo project immediately ran into problems. Siegel appointed his girlfriend Virginia Hill as a project overseer. As a result, contractors were stealing from Siegel. They would sell him materials one day, then steal them from the building site at night, then resell them to him the next day. The Flamingo project was also impacted by the rising cost of materials and labor from the post World War II building boom. The bottom line was that a project projected to cost $1.5 million would eventually reach $6 million.

To make matters worse, the bosses suspected Siegel and Hill of stealing project money. Lansky and the bosses had discovered that Hill was taking frequent trips to Zürich, Switzerland and depositing money in a bank account. They suspected that Siegel was skimming money and might flee the country if the Flamingo failed.

Following a discussion, the delegates voted to execute Siegel. The delegates assigned Chicago Outfit consigliere, Charles &quot;Trigger Happy&quot; Fischetti to oversee the contract. The actual hit would be given to Jack Dragna, the Los Angeles crime family boss. Dragna, who despised Siegel, then gave the contract to Mob hitman, John &quot;Frankie&quot; Carbo, a Lucchese crime family soldier.

At the last moment Siegel got a reprieve. The partly completed Flamingo was scheduled to open December 26. Longtime Siegel friend Lansky convinced the delegates to see how the hotel did in its opening. The delegates agreed, and then took a break for Christmas Day. The delegates soon learned that the Flamingo opening night was a flop. The enraged mobsters demanded Siegel&#x27;s head. Lansky again convinced them to wait. He argued that Siegel could still save the casino and make money.

After two weeks, the Flamingo closed to resume construction. The completed hotel opened a few months later. The Flamingo started making a small profit, but the Mafia investors had finally lost patience with Siegel. On June 20, 1947, Siegel was home alone at Hill&#x27;s mansion in Los Angeles reading a newspaper by a living room window. A gunman with a military M-1 carbine rose up from the bushes and fired four shots into the room. Siegel was hit twice in the head and twice in the torso and died instantly.

==Lucky and Don Vito==

At the end of the Havana Conference, the tension between Luciano and Genovese allegedly reached a boiling point, according to &quot;The Last Testament of Lucky Luciano&quot;, by Martin Gosch and Richard Hammer.

Meeting with Luciano in his room at the Hotel Nacional, Genovese told him that the U.S. government knew that Luciano was in Cuba and was pressuring the Cuban Government to expel him. Since Luciano was going to have to return to Italy, he should turn over leadership of the Luciano Family to Genovese and retire.

Positive that Genovese had tipped off the US government to his presence in Cuba, Luciano finally snapped. He proceeded to beat Genovese and eventually broke three of his ribs; it was three days before Vito could travel again. When Genovese felt better, Luciano and Anastasia put him on a plane to the States. Luciano also threatened to kill Genovese if he ever mentioned this incident to anyone.

In February 1947, the New York City papers got wind of the fact that Luciano was in Cuba. U.S. drug agent Harry Anslinger (called &quot;that S.O.B &quot;Asslinger&quot;&quot; by Luciano) demanded that Cuba deport Luciano to Italy. Anslinger claimed that Luciano was behind the recent surge of heroin into the United States. When Cuba refused to comply, Anslinger took his case to President Harry S. Truman. The U.S. government then halted all shipments of medical supplies to Cuba while Luciano was still on the island. Later in February, the Cubans caved in; they arrested Luciano and sent him back to Italy. When his plane landed there, the Italians arrested Luciano, but released him soon after.

Lucky Luciano died on January 26, 1962, of a heart attack at the Naples, Italy airport while picking up movie producer Martin Gosch.

Martin Gosch had helped Luciano write an autobiographical screenplay, but the Mafia Commission wouldn&#x27;t allow the film to be made. Gosch along with Richard Hammer used the screenplay to write the book &quot;The Last Testament of Lucky Luciano&quot; in 1975.

Luciano&#x27;s longtime associate and eventual nemesis, Vito Genovese, died a natural death in the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary in 1969. Luciano and Genovese are buried 100 feet from each other in the same cemetery in New York.

==Sidenote==

While Luciano knew that Vito Genovese had tipped off the U.S. government to his whereabouts in Cuba, he did not live to learn that it was &quot;Joe Bananas&quot; Bonanno who revealed to New York City newspapers as to Luciano&#x27;s whereabouts in Cuba in February 1947. Joseph Bonanno was a respected and feared Don, who was ruthless, ambitious and had aspired to being crowned &quot;capo di tutti capi&quot; (boss of all bosses) like his former boss and mentor Salvatore Maranzano. This information of Joseph Bonanno&#x27;s treachery was picked up by former FBI agent William Roemer, who was given the information by several of his former FBI colleagues. Bill Roemer details this on pages 132-42 in his 1990 book, &quot;War of the Godfathers&quot;.

==In popular culture==
The film &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; has an homage to the Havana Conference when Michael Corleone travels to Havana to have a meeting with several other mob bosses.

&quot;Bugsy&quot; also has the climatic debate and decision on whether to and when to execute Bugsy Siegel set at the Hotel Nacional.

<text>Nanker Phelge (also known as Nanker-Phelge) was a collective pseudonym used between 1963 and 1965 for several Rolling Stones group compositions. According to manager Andrew Loog Oldham the &#x27;Nanker Phelge&#x27; credit was mostly used for tracks where the origin lay in blues standards from the 1950s they heard when visiting the Chess studios in Chicago. It also enabled Oldham to benefit from writing credits.

Stones bassist Bill Wyman explained the origins of the name in his 2002 book, &quot;Rolling with the Stones&quot;:

Thus anything credited to Nanker Phelge refers to a Mick Jagger/Brian Jones/Keith Richards/Charlie Watts/Bill Wyman/Andrew Loog Oldham collaborative composition. The ASCAP files for the very earliest Nanker Phelge compositions also list early Rolling Stones member Ian Stewart (also known as &quot;the sixth Stone&quot;) as a co-author covered by the pseudonym.

The name resurfaced in the late 1960s on the labels of the original vinyl pressings of &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; and &quot;Let It Bleed&quot;. Manufacture of both albums was credited to Nanker Phelge, which was then acknowledged as an ABKCO company (ABKCO was manufacturing the records that still bore the London and Decca labels).

The related term &quot;press gang&quot; refers specifically to impressment practices in the United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Navy.

==Etymology==
The verb &quot;shanghai&quot; joined the lexicon with &quot;crimping&quot; and &quot;sailor thieves&quot; in the 1850s, possibly because Shanghai was a common destination of the ships with abducted crews. The term has since expanded to mean &quot;kidnapped&quot; or &quot;induced to do something by means of fraud or coercion&quot;.

==Background==

Crimps flourished in port cities like London and Liverpool in England and in San Francisco, Portland, Astoria, Seattle, Savannah, and Port Townsend in the United States. On the West Coast of the United States, Portland eventually surpassed San Francisco for shanghaiing. On the East Coast of the United States, New York had the most incidents, followed by Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore.

The role of crimps and the spread of the practice of shanghaiing resulted from a combination of laws, economic conditions, and the shortage of experienced sailors in England and on the American West Coast in the mid-19th century.

First, once an American sailor signed on board a vessel for a voyage, it was illegal for him to leave the ship before the voyage&#x27;s end. The penalty was imprisonment, the result of federal legislation enacted in 1790 (this factor was mitigated by the Maguire Act of 1895 and the White Act of 1898, and finally abolished by the Seamen&#x27;s Act of 1915).

Second, the practice was driven by a shortage of labor, particularly of skilled labor on ships on the West Coast. With crews abandoning ships en masse because of the California Gold Rush, a healthy body on board the ship was a boon.

By 1886, San Francisco surpassed New Bedford, Massachusetts as the United States&#x27; leading whaling port.

Finally, shanghaiing was made possible by the existence of boarding masters, whose job was to find crews for ships. Boarding masters were paid &quot;by the body&quot;, and thus had a strong incentive to place as many seamen on ships as possible. This pay was called &quot;blood money&quot;, and was just one of the revenue streams available. These factors set the stage for the crimp: a boarding master who uses trickery, intimidation, or violence to put a sailor on a ship.

The most straightforward method for a crimp to shanghai a sailor was to render him unconscious, forge his signature on the ship&#x27;s articles, and pick up his &quot;blood money&quot;. This approach was widely used, but there were more profitable methods.

In some situations, the boarding master could receive the first two, three, or four months of wages of a man he shipped out. Sailors were able to get an advance against their pay for an upcoming voyage to allow them to purchase clothes and equipment, but the advance wasn&#x27;t paid directly to the sailor because he could simply abscond with the money. Instead, those to whom money was owed could claim it directly from the ship&#x27;s captain. An enterprising crimp, already dealing with a seaman, could supplement his income by supplying goods and services to the seaman at an inflated price, and collecting the debt from the sailor&#x27;s captain.

Some crimps made as much as $9,500 per year ().

The crimps were well positioned politically to protect their lucrative trade. 

Some examples included Jim &quot;Shanghai&quot; Kelly and Johnny &quot;Shanghai Chicken&quot; Devine of San Francisco, and Joseph &quot;Bunko&quot; Kelly of Portland. Stories of their ruthlessness are innumerable, and some made it into print.

Another example of romanticized stories involves the &quot;birthday party&quot; Shanghai Kelly threw for himself, in order to attract enough victims to man a notorious sailing ship named the &quot;Reefer&quot; and two other ships.

==Ending the practice==
Demand for manpower to keep ships sailing to Alaska and the Klondike kept crimping a real danger into the early 20th century, but the practice was finally ended by a series of legislative reforms that spanned almost 50 years.

Before 1865, maritime labor laws primarily enforced stricter discipline on board ships. However, after 1865, this began to change. In 1868, New York State started cracking down on sailors&#x27; boardinghouses. They declined in number from 169 in 1863 to 90 in 1872. Then in 1871, Congress passed legislation to revoke the license of officers guilty of mistreating seamen.

In 1872, Congress passed the Shipping Commissioners Act of 1872 to combat crimps. Under this act, a sailor had to sign on to a ship in the presence of a federal shipping commissioner. The presence of a shipping commissioner was intended to ensure the sailor wasn&#x27;t &quot;forcibly or unknowingly signed on by a crimp&quot;.

In 1884, the Dingley Act came into effect. This law prohibited the practice of seamen taking advances on wages. It also limited the making of seamen&#x27;s allotments to only close relatives. However, the crimps fought back. In 1886, a loophole to the Dingley Act was created, allowing boardinghouse keepers to receive seamen&#x27;s allotments.
The widespread adoption of steam-powered vessels in the world&#x27;s merchant marine services in the late 19th and early 20th centuries radically altered the economics of seafaring. Without acres of canvas to be furled and unfurled, the demand for unskilled labor greatly diminished (and, by extension, crimping). The sinking of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;, followed by the onset of World War I (which made the high seas a much more dangerous place due to the threat of submarine attack), provided the final impetus to stamp out the practice. In 1915, Andrew Furuseth and Senator Robert M. La Follette pushed through the Seamen&#x27;s Act of 1915 that made crimping a federal crime, and finally put an end to it.

<doc id="686246" wikidata="Q27075729" url="?curid=686246" title="Indian silverbill">
<text>The Indian silverbill or white-throated munia (Euodice malabarica) is a small passerine bird found in the Indian Subcontinent and adjoining regions that was formerly considered to include the closely related African silverbill (&quot;Euodice cantans&quot;). This estrildid finch is a common resident breeding bird in the drier regions of the Middle East and the Indian Subcontinent. It has also been introduced into many other parts of the world and has become established in some areas. They forage in small flocks in grassland and scrub habitats.

==Taxonomy==
The Indian silverbill was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed the species with the crossbills in the genus &quot;Loxia&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Loxia malabarica&quot;.
 The specific epithet is from the Malbar region on the west coast of India. Linnaeus specified the locality as India but this was restricted to the Malabar region by E. C. Stuart Baker in 1926. The Indian silverbill is now placed with the African silverbill in the genus &quot;Euodice&quot; that was introduced by Ludwig Reichenbach in 1862. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

The Indian and Africa silverbills were formerly placed in the genus &quot;Lonchura&quot;. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2020 found that these two silverbills formed a clade that was basal to the members of &quot;Lonchura&quot;.

==Description==
The adult Indian silverbill is 11–11.5 cm long and has a conical silver-grey bill, buff-brown upperparts, white underparts, buffy flanks and dark wings. The tail is black and the wings are dark contrasting with a white rump. The sexes are similar, but immatures have buff underparts and a shorter tail. The tail appears pointed as the length of the feathers reduces from the centre outwards. It feeds mainly on seeds, but also takes insects and has been known to visit nectar bearing flowers, such as those of &quot;Erythrina&quot; trees.

==Habitat and distribution==
It frequents dry open scrub, fallow land and cultivation, sometimes near water. Although mainly found on the plains, they can be found up to about 1200 m in some sub-Himalayan regions. It occurs in Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Iran and Israel. It has been accidentally introduced into many other parts of the world and has established itself in Jordan, Israel, Kuwait, Oman, Puerto Rico, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Egypt since 2019, United States, Virgin Islands (possibly extinct) and Nice (southern France).

Although largely sedentary, some populations make seasonal movements.

==Behaviour and ecology==
These birds are gregarious and are found in flocks of as many as 60 birds. They feed on the ground or on low shrubs and grass stalks. They constantly utter a low cheeping or chirping contact call as they forage. They visit water and drink with a rapid sip and swallow action. Their feed on a wide range of grass seeds and will also make use of crop species.
The breeding season is spread out and varies with region. They nest in winter in southern India and after summer in northern India. The nest, an untidy ball of grasses with an opening on the side, is placed in low shrubs, often on thorny &quot;Acacia&quot;. They are also known to make use of the old nests of baya weaver sometimes even visiting those that are occupied by the weaver birds. They will sometimes build their nest below the platform nests of vultures or storks. Old nests are used as dormitories through the year for roosting. Females are known to lay their eggs in the nests of other pairs. The clutch varies from 4 to 8 white eggs and these are incubated by both parents for about 11 days. Helpers may be involved in breeding as more than a pair are sometimes seen at a nest.

Several parasitic protozoans and coccidia (&quot;Sivatoshella lonchurae&quot;) have been described from the species.

<text>The Kingdom of France was the first country to have diplomatic ties with the new United States in 1778. The 1778 Treaty of Alliance between the two countries and the subsequent aid provided from France proved decisive in the American victory over Britain in the American Revolutionary War. France, however, was left heavily indebted after the war, which contributed to France&#x27;s own revolution and eventual transition to a republic.

The France–United States relations has remained peaceful since, with the exceptions of the Quasi-War from 1798 to 1800 and American combat against Vichy France (while supporting Free France) from 1942 to 1944 during World War II. In 1803, the United States purchased the territory of Louisiana from France to acquire a total of and expand westwards. Tensions, however, rose during the American Civil War, as France intervened militarily in Mexico and entertained the possibility of recognizing the separatist Confederate States of America, the defeat of which was followed by the United States sending a large army to the Mexican border and forcing the withdrawal of French forces from Mexico.

Since 2000, the United States and France have continued to work together on a range of issues, such as counterterrorism, climate change, and trade. However, there was sharp disagreement over the Iraq War in 2003. Relations improved again starting in 2010. In 2024, upon appointing a new U.S. ambassador to France, President-elect Donald Trump called France &quot;our oldest ally, and one of our greatest&quot;.

== History ==
=== Colonial era ===
New France () was the area colonized by France beginning with exploration in 1534 and ending with the cession of New France to Great Britain and Spain in 1763 under the Treaty of Paris.

The vast territory of &quot;New France&quot; consisted of five colonies at its peak in 1712, each with its own administration: Canada, the most developed colony, was divided into the districts of Québec, Trois-Rivières, and Montréal; Hudson&#x27;s Bay; Acadie in the northeast; Plaisance on the island of Newfoundland; and Louisiane. It extended from Newfoundland to the Canadian Prairies and from Hudson Bay to the Gulf of Mexico, including all the Great Lakes of North America. The colony of Louisiana (New France) became part of the United States between 1776 and 1803, but outside of what is now the state of Louisiana it had a very small French population.

Population grew steadily because of high birth rates and good food supplies. In 1754 New France&#x27;s population consisted of 10,000 Acadians, 55,000 &quot;Canadiens&quot;, while the territories of upper and lower Louisiana had about 4,000 permanent French settlers, summing to 69,000 people.

The British expelled the Acadians in the Great Upheaval from 1755 to 1764. Their descendants are dispersed in modern Canada and in the U.S., in Maine and Louisiana.

==== French and Indian wars ====
Beginning in earnest after 1688, the simmering dynastic, religious and factional rivalries between the Protestant Britain and the larger power Catholic France triggered four wars in Europe that spilled over into North America. They were &quot;French and Indian Wars&quot; fought largely on American soil (King William&#x27;s War, 1689–1697; Queen Anne&#x27;s War, 1702–1713; King George&#x27;s War, 1744–1748; and, finally the Seven Years&#x27; War, 1756–1763). The French made allies of most of the Indian tribes and enabled them to attack villages in New England. Great Britain won and finally removed the French from continental North America in 1763.

In 1763, France ceded almost all of New France to Britain and Spain, at the Treaty of Paris. Britain took over Canada, Acadia, and the parts of French Louisiana which lay east of the Mississippi River, except for the Île d&#x27;Orléans. Spain was granted all the French claims to the west of the Mississippi River. In 1800, Spain returned its portion of Louisiana to France under the secret Treaty of San Ildefonso in 1800 imposed by Napoleon Bonaparte. He sold it all to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, permanently ending French colonial efforts on the American mainland. New France became absorbed within the United States and Canada. In the United States, the legacy of New France includes numerous place names as well as pockets of French-speaking communities.

=== France and the American Revolution ===

Within a decade of the French being expelled in 1763, the British colonies revolted openly. In retaliation, France, led by Luis de Unzaga y Amézaga, secretly provided troops and war materials to the independence movement.

After the Second Continental Congress declared independence in July 1776, its representatives in Paris recruited officers for the Continental Army, most notably the Marquis de Lafayette, who served with distinction as a major general. Despite lingering distrust of France, the representatives also sought a formal alliance. After preparing their fleet and witnessing the U.S. victory at the Battle of Saratoga in October 1777, the French concluded treaties of commerce and alliance on February 6, 1778, committing themselves to fight Britain until the independence of the United States was secured.

The military alliance got off to a rocky start. In 1778, French Admiral d&#x27;Estaing sailed to North America with a fleet and began a joint effort with American General John Sullivan to capture a British outpost in Newport, Rhode Island. However, d&#x27;Estaing abandoned the operation to confront a British fleet, which resulted in widespread American outrage; several sailors from the Royal French Navy were killed in anti-French riots. D&#x27;Estaing&#x27;s actions during a disastrous siege in Savannah, Georgia further damaged Franco-American relations.

The alliance improved in 1780 with the arrival of the comte de Rochambeau, who maintained a good working relationship with General Washington. French naval actions at the Battle of the Chesapeake enabled the decisive Franco–American victory at the siege of Yorktown in October 1781, effectively bringing an end to major combat in North America.

The nascent United States relied on Catholic France for military, financial, and diplomatic aid, leading to a significant decrease in anti-Catholic rhetoric. The historian Francis Cogiano argues that the king replaced the pope as the common enemy. Although anti-Catholic sentiment remained strong among Loyalists who chose to stay in the new nation, legal toleration for Catholics had been established across the United States by the 1780s, including in New England, a region historically known for its hostility towards Catholicism. Cogliano wrote: &quot;Amidst war and crisis, New Englanders relinquished not only their allegiance to Britain but also one of their deeply held prejudices.&quot;

==== Peace treaty ====
During the peace negotiations between the Americans and the British in Paris in 1782, the French played a significant role. The French Foreign Minister, the comte de Vergennes, had strategically maneuvered to ensure that the American Congress ordered its delegation to follow French advice. However, the American commissioners, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and particularly John Jay, correctly understood that France did not want a strong United States. They realized that they would receive better terms directly from Britain. 

The critical turning point came in September 1782 when Vergennes proposed a solution that strongly opposed the United States&#x27; interests, constraining the new nation&#x27;s potential for territorial expansion. In response, Jay promptly informed the British that he was willing to negotiate directly with them, thereby sidelining France and Spain. The British Prime Minister, Lord Shelburne, agreed, seeing an opportunity to separate the United States from France and establish a valuable economic partnership with the new country. The terms negotiated for the Western territories were as follows: the United States would acquire all the land east of the Mississippi River, north of Florida, and south of Canada, with the northern boundary remaining almost the same as it is today. Additionally, the United States would be granted fishing rights off Canadian coasts and agreed to allow British merchants and Loyalists to attempt to reclaim their property. This treaty was highly favorable for the United States, deliberately benefiting the British perspective. Prime Minister Shelburne foresaw highly profitable two-way trade between Britain and the rapidly growing United States, which indeed materialized. Trade with France remained on a much smaller scale.

=== The French Revolution ===

Six years later, the French Revolution overthrew the Bourbon regime. In the beginning, the United States was supportive of the changes in France, where the absolute hereditary monarchy was replaced by a constitutional republic. However, as the situation in France deteriorated, with the revolutionary government becoming more authoritarian and brutal, the United States&#x27; sympathy waned. Events such as the reign of terror diminished the warmth that the United States had for France. Unlike Thomas Jefferson, who left France in 1789, Gouverneur Morris (1752–1816) was highly critical of the French Revolution. Anne Cary Morris, describing her grandfather&#x27;s conservative beliefs, stated, &quot;He believed in tailoring the government to suit the condition, character, manners, and habits of the people. In France, this led him to favor a monarchical view, firmly believing that a republican form of government would not suit the French character.&quot;

A crisis emerged in American political circles in 1793 when France declared war on Great Britain during the War of the First Coalition, after the revolutionary government in Paris ordered the execution of Louis XVI. The young federal government in the United States was uncertain how to respond, with some arguing that the US was still obliged by the alliance of 1778 to go to war on the side of France. The treaty had been called &quot;military and economic&quot;, and as the United States had not finished paying off the French war loan, the continued validity of the military alliance was also called into question. President George Washington (responding to advice from both Alexander Hamilton and Jefferson) recognized the new French government, but did not support France in its war with Britain, as expressed in his 1793 Proclamation of Neutrality. Congress agreed and a year later passed a neutrality act forbidding U.S. citizens from participating in the war and prohibiting the use of U.S. soil as a base of operations by either side in the conflict. The French revolutionary government viewed Washington&#x27;s policy as a betrayal.

The first challenge to U.S. neutrality came from France, when its first diplomatic representative, the brash Edmond-Charles Genêt, toured the United States to organize U.S. attacks against Spanish and British interests. Washington demanded Genêt&#x27;s recall, but by then the French Revolution had taken yet another turn and the new French ministers arrived to arrest Genêt. Washington refused to extradite Genêt (knowing he would be guillotined), and Genêt later became a U.S. citizen.

France further regarded Jay&#x27;s Treaty (November 1794) between Britain and the United States as hostile to French interests; the treaty opened a decade of American trade with the British when France was at war with Britain.

Timothy Pickering (1745–1829) was the third United States Secretary of State, serving in that office from 1795 to 1800 under Washington and John Adams. Biographer Gerald Clarfield says he was a &quot;quick-tempered, self-righteous, frank, and aggressive Anglophile,&quot; who handled the French poorly. In response the French envoy Pierre Adet repeatedly provoked Pickering into embarrassing situations, then ridiculed his blunderings and blusterings to appeal to Democratic-Republican opponents of the Federalist Adams Administration.

==== Undeclared naval fighting: Quasi War (1798–1800) ====

To overcome this resentment John Adams sent a special mission to Paris in 1797 to meet the French foreign minister Talleyrand. The American delegation was shocked, however, when it was demanded that they pay monetary bribes in order to meet and secure a deal with the French government. Adams exposed the episode, known as the &quot;XYZ Affair&quot;, which greatly offended Americans even though such bribery was not uncommon among the courts of Europe.
Tensions with France escalated into an undeclared war—called the &quot;Quasi-War.&quot; It involved two years of hostilities at sea, in which both navies attacked the other&#x27;s shipping in the West Indies. The unexpected fighting ability of the U.S. Navy, which destroyed the French West Indian trade, together with the growing weaknesses and final overthrow of the ruling Directory in France in the Coup of 18 Brumaire, led Talleyrand to reopen negotiations. At the same time, President Adams feuded with Hamilton over control of the Adams&#x27; administration. Adams took sudden and unexpected action, rejecting the anti-French hawks in his own party and offering peace to France. In 1800 he sent William Vans Murray to France to negotiate peace; Federalists cried betrayal. The subsequent negotiations, embodied in the Convention of 1800 (also called the &quot;Treaty of Mortefontaine&quot;) of September 30, 1800, affirmed the rights of Americans as neutrals upon the sea and abrogated the alliance with France of 1778. The treaty failed to provide compensation for the $20,000,000 &quot;French Spoliation Claims&quot; of the United States; the U.S. government eventually paid these claims. The Convention of 1800 ensured that the United States would remain neutral toward France in the wars of Napoleon and ended the &quot;entangling&quot; French alliance with the United States. In truth, this alliance had only been viable between 1778 and 1783.

===Napoleon===

The Spanish Empire was losing money heavily on the ownership of vast Louisiana territory, and was eager to turn it over to Napoleon in 1800. He envisioned it as the base (along with Haiti) of a New World empire. Louisiana would be a granary providing food to the enslaved labor force in the West Indies. President Jefferson could tolerate weak Spain but not the powerful First French Empire in the west. He considered war to prevent French control of the Mississippi River. Jefferson sent his close friend, James Monroe, to France to buy as much of the land around New Orleans as he could. Surprisingly, Napoleon agreed to sell the entire territory. Because of an insuppressible slave rebellion in St. Domingue, modern-day Haiti, among other reasons, Bonaparte&#x27;s North American plans collapsed. To keep Louisiana out of British hands in an approaching war he sold it in April 1803 to the United States for $15 million. British bankers financed the deal, taking American government bonds and shipping gold to Paris. The size of the United States was doubled without going to war.

Britain and France resumed their war in 1803, just after the Louisiana Purchase. Both challenged American neutrality and tried to disrupt American trade with its enemy. The presupposition was that small neutral nations could benefit from the wars of the great powers. Jefferson distrusted both Napoleon and Britain, but saw the British (with its monarchy, aristocracy, powerful navy and control over Canada) as the more immediate threat to American interests. Therefore, he and Madison took a generally pro-French position and used the embargo to hurt British trade. Another point of Anglo-American contention was the desertion of thousands of British sailors to U.S. merchantmen, which led to the Royal Navy impressing approximately 6,000 alleged deserters from American merchant ships. 

This inflamed American public opinion and resulted in calls for war with Britain, which led to Jefferson signing the Embargo Act in 1807, which forbade all foreign trade, exports and imports. Though designed to hurt the British, American commerce harmed far more and was rescinded in 1809, as Jefferson left office. The new Madison administration chose a more direct approach and in 1812 declared war on Britain. Despite both nations now in open war against the British, throughout the War of 1812 there never existed either a formal or informal sense of renewed alliance between the U.S. and France and no direct effort was ever made to coordinate military activity. With the Louisiana purchase the U.S. inherited French claims to Texas and border disputes with Spain&#x27;s adjacent colonial empire. These issues were resolved by the Adams–Onís Treaty in 1819 which helped pave the way for the U.S. purchase of Florida.

===Alienation===
Catherine Hebert reports that French visitors before 1790 made highly favorable reports of American culture, influenced perhaps by the ideals of the noble savage and the American acceptance of the Enlightenment. However the Royalist exiles who came in the 1790s responded in a highly negative fashion to republicanism, and few remained permanently.

According to James Banner, conservative Americans reacted strongly against the French Revolution, with its disdain toward religion and its zest for the guillotine. American minister James Monroe managed to rescue Thomas Paine from the guillotine in Paris in 1794. Jeffersonians at first supported the French Revolution, but after Napoleon came to power in 1799 Jefferson and his followers repudiated it as the antithesis of republicanism. The result was the destruction of the 1778 alliance and indeed the friendship between the United States and France. The new hostility enhanced the conservative elements in American republicanism. The alienation increased American sensibility about being &quot;a people apart&quot; and strengthened distrust of foreign influences and rejection of alien ideologies.

=== 1815–1860 ===
Relations between the two nations were generally quiet for two decades with both trade and migration staying low. The United States, issued the &quot;Monroe Doctrine&quot; in 1823 to keep European powers, such as France, from colonizing lands in the New World. France had a strong interest in expanding commercially and imperially into Latin America as Spanish hegemony there collapsed. There was a desire among top French officials that some of the newly independent countries in Latin America might select a Bourbon king, though no actual operations ever took place. French officials ignored the American position. France and Austria, two reactionary monarchies, strenuously opposed American republicanism and wanted the United States to have no voice whatsoever in their affairs.

A treaty between the United States and France in 1831 called for France to pay 25 million francs for the spoliation claims of American shipowners against French seizures during the Napoleonic wars. France did pay European claims, but refused to pay the United States. President Andrew Jackson was livid, and in 1834 ordered the U.S. Navy to stand by and asked Congress for legislation. Jackson&#x27;s political opponents blocked any legislation. France was annoyed but finally voted the money in exchange for an apology-which Jackson refused, and diplomatic relations were broken off until December 1835 when Jackson offered some friendlier words. Eventually through British mediation, France paid the money, and cordial relations were resumed.
Modest cultural exchanges resumed, most famously intense study visits by Gustave de Beaumont and Alexis de Tocqueville, the author of &quot;Democracy in America&quot; (1835). The book was immediately a popular success in both countries, and to this day helps shape American self-understanding. American writers such as James Fenimore Cooper, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and Ralph Waldo Emerson appealed to an appreciative French audience. French utopian socialists projected an idealized American society as a model for the future. French travelers to the United States were often welcomed in the name of the Marquis de Lafayette, who despite having lost much of his influence in France, remained a popular hero in the Revolution in US and made a triumphant American tour in 1824. Numerous political exiles found refuge in New York.

In the 1840s Britain and France considered sponsoring continued independence of the Republic of Texas and blocking U.S. moves to obtain California. Balance of power considerations made Britain want to keep the western territories out of U.S. hands to limit U.S. power; in the end, France opposed such intervention in order to limit British power, the same reason for which France had sold Louisiana to the U.S. and earlier supported the American Revolution. Thus the great majority of the territorial growth of the continental United States was accepted without question by Paris.

=== Civil War: Neutrality and Mexico ===

During the American Civil War, 1861–65, France was neutral, as was every other nation. However Napoleon III favored the CSA, hoping to weaken the United States, gain a new ally in the Confederacy, safeguard the cotton trade and protect his large investment in controlling the Second Mexican Empire. France was too weak to act alone and sought the support of the British who also favored the Confederacy but were ultimately unwilling to risk war with the U.S.

Napoleon III took advantage of the war in 1863, when he installed Austrian archduke Maximilian of Habsburg on the Mexican throne. Washington protested and refused to recognize the new government. Napoleon hoped that a Confederate victory would allow French dominance over Mexico. Matías Romero, Júarez&#x27;s ambassador to the United States, gained some support in Congress for possibly intervening on Mexico&#x27;s behalf against France&#x27;s occupation. Seeking to avoid war with France, Secretary of State William Seward cautiously limited aid to the Mexican rebels until the Confederacy was near defeat.

By 1865, United States diplomatic pressure coupled with the massing of US soldiers on the border with Mexico, persuaded Napoleon III to withdraw French troops and support. The democratic Mexican government was soon restored and Maximilian executed.

After the assassination of Abraham Lincoln in April 1865, an outpouring of sympathy from French citizens proceeded. A nationwide collection for a medal, expressing the people&#x27;s sympathy for Lincoln&#x27;s death, was taken.

The Union victory, French withdrawal from Mexico, and the Russian sale of Alaska left the United States dominant in the Western Hemisphere.

=== 1867–1914 ===
The removal of Napoleon III in 1870 after the Franco-Prussian War helped improve Franco–American relations. American public opinion favored a German victory. During the German Siege of Paris, the small American population, led by the Minister to France Elihu B. Washburne, provided much medical, humanitarian, and diplomatic support to Parisians, gaining much credit to the Americans. In subsequent years the balance of power in the relationship shifted as the United States, with its very rapid growth in wealth, industry and population, came to overshadow the old powers. Trade was at a low level, France minimized the activity of American banks and insurance companies, tariffs were high, and mutual investments were uncommon.

Famous writer Mark Twain once wrote with humour, &quot;France has neither winter nor summer nor morals. Apart from these drawbacks it is a fine country. France has usually been governed by prostitutes.&quot;

All during this period, the relationship remained friendly—as symbolized by the Statue of Liberty, presented in 1884 as a gift to the United States from the French people. From 1870 until 1918, France was the only major republic in a Europe of monarchies, which endeared it to the United States. Few French people emigrated, but many held the United States in high esteem, as a land of opportunity and as a source of modern ideas. Intellectuals, however, saw the United States as a land built on crass materialism, lacking in a significant culture, and boasting of its distrust of intellectuals. Very few self-styled French intellectuals were admirers.

In 1906, when Germany challenged French influence in Morocco (&quot;see&quot; Tangier Crisis and Agadir Crisis), President Theodore Roosevelt sided with the French. Nevertheless, as the U.S. grew mightily in economic power, and forged closer ties with Britain, the French increasingly talked about an Anglo-Saxon threat to their culture.

Student exchange became an important factor, especially Americans going to France to study. The French were annoyed that so many Americans were going to Germany for post-graduate education, and discussed how to attract more Americans. After 1870, hundreds of American women traveled to France and Switzerland to obtain their medical degrees. The best American schools were closed to them and chose an expensive option superior to what they were allowed in the U.S. In the First World War, normal enrollments plunged at French universities, and the government made a deliberate decision to attract American students partially to fill the enrollment gap, and more importantly to neutralize German influences in American higher education. Thousands of American soldiers, waiting for their slow return to America after the war ended in late 1918, enrolled in university programs set up especially for them.

=== World War I (1914–19) ===

When World War I broke out the United States declared itself neutral, a status it maintained for almost 3 years until entering the conflict in April 1917 on the side of the Allies. Both before and after Washington provided much-needed money—as loans to be repaid—that purchased American food, oil and chemicals for the French effort. The first wave of initial American soldiers to arrive at the Western Front brought no heavy equipment (so that the ships could carry more soldiers). In combat they used French artillery, airplanes and tanks, such as the SPAD XIII fighter biplane and Renault FT light tank serving in the aviation and armored formations of the American Expeditionary Force on the Western Front. In 1918 the United States sent over two million combat troops under the command of General John J. Pershing, who operated on their own sector of the Western Front. They gave the Allies a decisive edge, as the Germans were unable to replace their heavy losses and virtually collapsed by September 1918.

==== The peace settlement (1919) ====
President Woodrow Wilson had become the hero of the war for Frenchmen, and his arrival in Paris was widely hailed. However, the two countries clashed over France&#x27;s policy to weaken Germany and make it pay for the huge destructions suffered by France on which soil war had almost entirely been fought. The ambition of French Premier Georges Clemenceau was to ensure the security of France in the future; his formula was not friendship with Germany but restitution, reparations, and guarantees. Clemenceau had little confidence in what he considered to be the unrealistic and utopian principles of Wilson: &quot;Even God was satisfied with Ten Commandments, but Wilson insists on fourteen&quot; (a reference to Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Fourteen Points&quot;). The two nations disagreed on debts, reparations, and restraints on Germany. President Wilson along with Clemenceau and British Prime Minister David Lloyd George led in making major decisions at the conference. Wilson made the new League of Nations his highest priority; the other two went along but had much less confidence in the value of the new League.

Clemenceau was also determined that a buffer state should be established in the Rhineland under the aegis of France. In the eyes of the U.S. and British representatives, such a crass violation of the principle of self-determination would only breed future wars, and a compromise was therefore offered Clemenceau, which he accepted. The territory in question was to be occupied by Allied troops for a period of five to fifteen years, and a zone extending fifty kilometers east of the Rhine was to be demilitarized. Wilson and Lloyd George agreed to support a treaty that would guarantee France against German aggression. Republican leaders in Washington were willing to support a security treaty with France. It never came to a Senate vote because Wilson insisted on linking it to the Versailles Treaty, which the Republicans would not accept without certain amendments Wilson refused to allow.

French historian Duroselle portrays Clemenceau as wiser than Wilson, equally compassionate and committed to justice but one who understood that world peace and order depended on the permanent suppression of the German threat. Blumenthal (1986), by contrast, says Wilson&#x27;s policies were far sounder than the harsh terms demanded by Clemenceau. Blumenthal agrees with Wilson that peace and prosperity required Germany&#x27;s integration into the world economy and political community as an equal partner.

=== Interwar years (1919–38) ===

During the interwar years, the two nations remained friendly. Beginning in the 1920s, U.S. intellectuals, painters, writers, and tourists were drawn to visit and because of their interest in French art, literature, fashion, wines, and cuisine. Tensions rose over Washington&#x27;s insistence that Paris repay war loans while in the same time supporting the unwillingness of Berlin to pay France the reconstruction cost of devastated territories in northern France as provided by the Treaty of Versailles. A deal was reached: the Dawes Plan where American banks made loans to Germany, enabling them to pay reparations to France, who in turn would cover their American war loans. This system collapsed with in the Great Depression however.

A number of American artists, such as Josephine Baker, experienced popular success in France. Paris was quite welcoming to American jazz music and black artists in particular, as France, unlike a significant part of the United States at the time, had no racial discrimination laws. Numerous writers such as William Faulkner, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, and others were deeply influenced by their experiences of French life. Known as the Lost Generation, their time in Paris was documented by Hemingway in his memoir &quot;A Moveable Feast&quot;.

However, anti-Americanism came of age in the 1920s, as many French traditionalists were alarmed at the power of Hollywood and warned that America represented modernity, which in turn threatened traditional French values, customs, and popular literature. The alarm of American influence escalated half a century later when Americans opened the $4 billion Disneyland Paris theme park in 1992; it attracted larger crowds than the Louvre, and soon it was said that the iconic American cartoon character Mickey Mouse had become more familiar than Asterix among French youth.

The J. Walter Thompson Company of New York was the leading American advertising agency of the interwar years. It established branch offices in Europe, including one in Paris in 1927. Most of these branches were soon the leading local agencies, as in Britain and Germany, JWT-Paris did poorly from the late 1920s through the early 1960s. The causes included cultural clashes between the French and Americans and subtle anti-Americanism among potential clients. Furthermore, The French market was heavily regulated and protected to repel all foreign interests, and the American admen in Paris were purportedly not good at hiding their condescension and insensitivity.

In 1928 the two nations were the chief sponsors of the Kellogg–Briand Pact. The pact, which was endorsed by most major nations, renounced the use of war, promoted peaceful settlement of disputes, and called for collective force to prevent aggression. Its provisions were incorporated into the United Nations Charter and other treaties and it became a stepping stone to a more activist American policy. Diplomatic intercourse was minimal under Franklin D. Roosevelt from 1933 to 1939.

=== World War II (1938–45) ===

In the approach to the Second World War the United States helped France arm its air force against the Nazi threat. The sudden outbreak of war had forced France to realize that Germany had a larger more advanced Air Force. President Roosevelt had long been interested in France, and was a personal friend of French Senator, Baron Amaury de La Grange. In late 1937 he told Roosevelt about the French weaknesses, and asked for military help. Roosevelt was forthcoming, and forced the War Department to secretly sell the most modern American airplanes and other equipment to France. The U.S. military opposed the sale of their latest designs, and American factories needed time to ramp up production. Fewer than 200 U.S. warplanes could be delivered before France surrendered in 1940. Paris frantically expanded its own aircraft production, but it was too little and too late. France and Britain declared war on Germany when it invaded Poland in September 1939, but there was little action until the following spring. The German blitzkrieg overwhelmed Denmark and Norway and trapped French and British forces in Belgium. France chose to accept German surrender terms and quickly transformed into a rump state and authoritarian regime under the rule of Pétain, whose informal seat was in Vichy.

==== Vichy France (1940–44) ====
The American position towards Vichy France and Charles de Gaulle was especially hesitant and inconsistent. Roosevelt disliked de Gaulle and agreed with Leahy&#x27;s view that de Gaulle was an &quot;apprentice dictator&quot;.

After war, the U.S. government asked to a Harvard professor, William Langer, to justify this policy initially very favourable to Vichy: this book was entitled &quot;Our Vichy Gamble&quot; (1947) and it almost totally whitewashed the policy.

Langer argues that Washington was shocked by the sudden collapse of France in spring 1940, and feared that Germany might gain control of the large French fleet, and exploit France&#x27;s overseas colonies. This led the Roosevelt administration to maintain diplomatic relations. FDR appointed his close associate Admiral William D. Leahy as ambassador, and the embassy—also representing the United Kingdom due to France&#x27;s rupture of relations—moved from Paris to Vichy, shortly moving to the Hôtel des Ambassadeurs and then to the &quot;Villa Ica&quot; next door. The Vichy regime was officially neutral but in practice subservient to the Axis. The United States severed diplomatic relations in late 1942 after Germany took direct control of the areas Vichy had previously governed autonomously.

Langer&#x27;s book was then used as new evidence to request a review of the trial of Pétain by his lawyer in 1950 (the case was eventually dismissed). According to one reviewer, this book should have been called &quot;Our Vichy Fumble&quot;.

According to a contemporary historian, there were numerous and obvious indications that the American public did not support its government&#x27;s Vichy policy, that it saw Vichy&#x27;s true colors, and that it even supported de Gaulle&#x27;s Free France movement. When visiting the United States in July 1944, de Gaulle received a very warm welcome from large public audiences when in the same time Roosevelt was slow to acknowledge that the Provisional Government formed around de Gaulle in Algiers was truly representing political parties and trade unions as they would take their position back after the liberation of France.

===== Free French Forces =====
The United States formally recognized and established diplomatic relations with Vichy France (until late 1942) and avoided formal relations with the exiled government of de Gaulle&#x27;s and its claim to be the one and only legitimate government of France. Relations were strained between Roosevelt and de Gaulle, the leader of the Free French. When the Free French Forces of de Gaulle occupied the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, south of Newfoundland, in December 1941, Hull lodged a very strong protest and went as far as referring to the Gaullist naval forces as &quot;the so-called Free French.&quot; His request to have the Vichy governor reinstated was met with strong criticism in the American press: newspapers mocked the &quot;so-called Secretary of State&quot;.

After the Allied invasion of French North Africa in November 1942, the relationship complicated even more. Eisenhower&#x27;s decision to recognize Admiral François Darlan as commander of all French forces in the area as well his self-nomination as High Commissioner of France in Africa (in order to put a quick end to French resistance in North Africa) was a blow to Fighting French. General de Gaulle was outraged; so were the pro-Allied conspirators who had seized Algiers. Some high American and British officials objected, and there was furious criticism by newspapers and politicians.

To the Fighting French, Admiral Darlan was a onetime Nazi collaborationist, and therefore a traitor. Roosevelt defended it (using wording suggested by Churchill) as &#x27;a temporary expedient, justified only by the stress of battle&#x27;.

After the breakout at Normandy, most on both sides thought it was only a matter of time before the Nazis lost. Eisenhower did give de Gaulle his word that Paris could be formally liberated by French forces, given the city&#x27;s heavy symbolic but lack of tactical value. It was therefore easy for Eisenhower to let de Gaulle&#x27;s French Forces of the Interior take the charge. Hitler had given the order to bomb and burn Paris to the ground; he wanted to make it a second Stalingrad. The French 2nd armored division with Maj. General Phillipe Leclerc at its helm was granted the task of liberating Paris by the Allied Supreme Command. General Leclerc was ecstatic at this thought because he wanted to wipe away the humiliation of the Vichy Government.

General Eisenhower trusted Leclerc who had a long and successful experience of war operations and Paris was not in the way of the vast overtaking trajectory of the brilliant offensive led by General George S. Patton from Falaise in Normandy to the eastern border of France but leaving Paris on the north of its left flank. Anticipating the arrival of the 2nd Armored division of Leclerc, the French Resistance then fought to liberate the center of Paris. Eisenhower had agreed with de Gaulle, that the first allied soldiers to enter a liberated Paris be French.

The U.S. government announced in July 1944 that the French provisional government was recognized as the &quot;de facto&quot; authority in liberated France before the full recognition on 23 October 1944 of the Provisional Government of the French Republic. France was presenting kind of a unique situation for the Allied Forces when they embarked on liberating western Europe. The governments of the other western countries such as Belgium, Norway or the Netherlands did not sign any armistice with nazi Germany but took refuge in the UK in 1940, they were to be simply reinstated by the liberation of their country. But the Vichy authorities could legally be considered as the French government who signed an armistice with nazi Germany, engaged into an active collaborationist policy with the enemy, and seemed to still be widely popular. What would be the reaction of this government, of the population, of the communist resistance? Would the Provisional Government of Algiers be in a position to take control of the country and run an efficient local administration without facing a fierce opposition of the population or the armed &quot;maquis&quot;?
To be in a position to directly administer the countries they were to occupy, the Allied Forces had set up a administrative corp called the Allied Military Government of Occupied Territories (AMGOT) which was planned for France as well as occupied Axis powers. After the battle of Normandy, de Gaulle proved that he was swift and efficient at restoring local administration by appointing Commissioners of the Republic in every department as soon as they were liberated and the AMGOT was never put in charge in France, unlike other liberated and occupied territories.

However the fact that the Allied Forces may have considered France as an &quot;occupied&quot; country instead of a &quot;liberated&quot; Allied country fostered some resentment among the political elites when of course the entire population was relieved and grateful. In addition, General Patton once complained about the Leclerc&#x27;s division for being weak that “I would rather have a German division in front of me than a French one behind me.”

Nonetheless, the U.S. Third Army under General Patton continued to push the German Army from the country, first sweeping across northern France before going onto liberating Lorraine alongside Leclerc 2nd Armored Division later on assisted by the 1st French army and the American 7th army who landed in provence in august 1944.

==== Roosevelt opposes French colonies in Asia ====
Roosevelt was strongly committed to terminating European colonialism in Asia, including French Indochina and placing them under international trusteeship. Roosevelt offered post-war funding and diplomatic support to the Republic of China to stabilize and if necessary police the region. This scheme included Chinese occupation of French Indochina, a proposal that was directly contrary to the plans of the French; de Gaulle had a grand vision of the French overseas empire as the base for his return to defeat Vichy France. Roosevelt would not abide de Gaulle, but Winston Churchill, a staunch supporter of colonialism himself, realized that Britain needed French help to reestablish its position in Europe after the war. Churchill and the British foreign office worked with de Gaulle against Roosevelt&#x27;s decolonization plans. By 1944, Chiang&#x27;s government was barely hanging on; despite Roosevelt&#x27;s faith in the Chinese they had proven to be weak, often unstable and strategically vulnerable ally. Moreover, Chiang continued to voice disinterest to Roosevelt in his trusteeship plan and the idea was dropped altogether by the end of the war.

== Postwar years ==
In the postwar years, both cooperation and discord persisted. The French zone of occupation in Germany was formed from the U.S. zone. After de Gaulle left office in January 1946, the logjam was broken in terms of financial aid. Lend Lease had barely restarted when it was unexpectedly ended in August 1945. The U.S. Army shipped in food, 1944–46. U.S. Treasury loans and cash grants were given in 1945–47, and especially the Marshall Plan gave large sums (1948–51). There was post-Marshall aid (1951–55) designed to help France rearm and provide massive support for its war in Indochina. 

Apart from low-interest loans, the other funds were grants that did not involve repayment. The debts left over from World War I, whose payment had been suspended since 1931, was renegotiated in the Blum-Byrnes agreement of 1946. The United States forgave all $2.8 billion in debt from the First World War, and gave France a new loan of $650 million. In return French negotiator Jean Monnet set out the French five-year plan for recovery and development. The Marshall Plan gave France $2.3 billion with no repayment. The total of all American grants and credits to France from 1946 to 1953, amounted to $4.9 billion. A central feature of the Marshall Plan was to encourage international trade, reduce tariffs, lower barriers, and modernize French management. The Marshall Plan set up intensive tours of American industry. France sent 500 missions with 4700 businessmen and experts to tour American factories, farms, stores and offices. They were especially impressed with the prosperity of American workers, and how they could purchase an inexpensive new automobile for nine months work, compared to 30 months in France. Some French businesses resisted Americanization, but the most profitable, especially chemicals, oil, electronics, and instrumentation, seized upon the opportunity to attract American investments and build a larger market. The U.S. insisted on opportunities for Hollywood films, and the French film industry responded with new life.

===Cold War===
In 1949 the two again became formal allies through the North Atlantic Treaty, which set up the NATO military alliance. Although the United States openly disapproved of French efforts to regain control of colonies in Africa and Southeast Asia, it supported the French government in fighting the Communist uprising in French Indochina. However, in 1954, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower declined French requests for aerial strikes to relieve besieged French forces at Dien Bien Phu.

France somewhat reluctantly joined the American leadership in the Cold War to contain the Soviet Union, despite a large Communist presence in French politics. The Communists were kept out of the national government. From 1950 to 1953 in the Korean War, 3,200 French soldiers assisted South Korea by taking part in the fighting. Of these, 270 were killed.

A major crisis came in 1956 when France, Britain, and Israel attacked Egypt, which had recently nationalized the Suez Canal. Eisenhower forced them to withdraw. By exposing their diminished international stature, the Suez Crisis had a profound impact on the UK and France: the UK subsequently aligned its Middle East policy to that of the United States, whereas France distanced itself from what it considered to be unreliable allies and sought its own path.

===De Gaulle===

In the 1950s France sought American help in developing nuclear weapons; Eisenhower rejected the overtures for four reasons. Before 1958, he was troubled by the political instability of the French Fourth Republic and worried that it might use nuclear weapons in its colonial wars in Vietnam and Algeria. Charles de Gaulle brought stability to the Fifth Republic starting in 1958, but Eisenhower was still hesitant to assist in the nuclearization of France. De Gaulle wanted to challenge the Anglo-Saxon monopoly on Western weapons by having his own &quot;Force de frappe.&quot; Eisenhower feared his grandiose plans to use the bombs to restore French grandeur would weaken NATO. Furthermore, Eisenhower wanted to discourage the proliferation of nuclear arms anywhere.

Charles de Gaulle also quarreled with Washington over the admission of Britain into the European Economic Community. These and other tensions led to de Gaulle&#x27;s decision in 1966 to withdraw French forces from the integrated military structure of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and forced it to move its headquarters from Paris to Brussels, Belgium. De Gaulle&#x27;s foreign policy was centered on an attempt to limit the power and influence of both superpowers, which would increase France&#x27;s international prestige in relative terms. De Gaulle hoped to move France from being a follower of the United States to a leading first-world power with a large following among certain non-aligned Third World countries. The nations de Gaulle considered potential participants in this grouping were those in France&#x27;s traditional spheres of influence, Africa and the Middle East.

The two nations differed over the waging of the Vietnam War, in part because French leaders were convinced that the United States could not win. The recent French experience with the Algerian War of Independence was that it was impossible, in the long run, for a democracy to impose by force a government over a foreign population without considerable manpower and probably the use of unacceptable methods such as torture. The French popular view of the United States worsened at the same period, as it came to be seen as an imperialist power.

===1970–1989===

Relations improved somewhat after de Gaulle lost power in 1969. Small tensions reappeared intermittently. France, more strongly than any other nation, has seen the European Union as a method of counterbalancing American power, and thus works towards such ends as having the Euro challenge the preeminent position of the United States dollar in global trade and developing a European defense initiative as an alternative to NATO. Overall, the United States had much closer relations with the other large European powers, Great Britain, Germany and Italy. In the 1980s the two nations cooperated on some international matters but disagreed sharply on others, such as Operation El Dorado Canyon and the desirability of a reunified Germany. The Reagan administration did its best efforts to prevent France and other European countries from buying natural gas from Russia, through the construction of the Siberia-Europe pipeline. The European governments, including the French, were undeterred and the pipeline was finally built.

=== Middle East conflict ===
France under President François Mitterrand supported the 1991 Persian Gulf War in Iraq as a major participant under Operation Daguet. The French Assemblee Nationale even took the &quot;unprecedented decision&quot; to place all French forces in the Gulf under United States command for the duration of the war.

====9/11====
All the left and right wing political elements in France strongly denounced the acts of the Al-Qaeda terrorists in the 9/11 attack in 2001. President Jacques Chirac —later known for his frosty relationship with President George W. Bush—ordered the French secret services to collaborate closely with U.S. intelligence, and created Alliance Base in Paris, a joint-intelligence service center charged with enacting the Bush administration&#x27;s War on Terror. However, all the political elements rejected the idea of a full-scale war against Islamic radical terrorism. Memories of the Algerian war, and its disastrous impact on French internal affairs, as well as more distant memories of its own failed Indochina/Vietnam war, played a major role. Furthermore, France had a large Islamic population of its own, which Chirac could not afford to alienate. As a consequence, France refused to support any American military efforts in the Middle East. Numerous works by French novelists and film makers criticized the American efforts to transform the 9/11 terrorist attacks into a justification for war.

====Iraq War====

In March 2003 France, along with Germany, China, and Russia, opposed the proposed UN resolution that would have authorized a U.S. invasion of Iraq. During the run-up to the war, French foreign minister Dominique de Villepin emerged as a prominent critic of the American Iraq policies. Despite the recurring rifts, the often ambivalent relationship remained formally intact. The United States did not need French help, and instead worked closely with Britain and its other allies.

Angry American talk about boycotting French products in retaliation fizzled out, having little impact beyond the short-lived renaming of French fries as &quot;Freedom fries.&quot; Nonetheless, the Iraq war, the attempted boycott, and anti-French sentiments caused a hostile negative counter reaction in Europe. By 2006, only one American in six considered France an ally of the United States.

The ire of American popular opinion toward France during the run-up to the 2003 Iraq Invasion was primarily due to the fact that France threatened to use its United Nations Security Council veto power to block U.N. resolutions favorable to authorizing military action, and decided not to intervene in Iraq itself (because the French did not believe the reasons given to go to war, such as the supposed link between Saddam Hussein and Al-Qaeda, and the purported weapons of mass destruction to be legitimate). This contributed to the perception of the French as uncooperative and unsympathetic in American popular opinion at the time. This perception was quite strong and persisted despite the fact that France was and had been for some time a major ally in the campaign in Afghanistan (see for example the French forces in Afghanistan) where both nations (among others in the US-led coalition) were dedicated to the removal of the rogue Taliban, and the subsequent stabilization of Afghanistan, a recognized training ground and safe haven for terrorists intent on carrying out attacks in the Western world.

As the Iraq War progressed, and opposition to the Iraq War amongst Americans increased, relations between the two nations began to improve, and Americans&#x27; views of France in general also steadily improved over time. In June 2006 the Pew Global Attitudes Project revealed that 52% of Americans had a positive view of France, up from 46% in 2005. Other reports indicate Americans are moving not so much toward favorable views of France as toward ambivalence, and that views toward France have stabilized roughly on par with views toward Russia and China.

Following issues like Hezbollah&#x27;s rise in Lebanon, Iran&#x27;s nuclear program and the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace process, George Bush urged Jacques Chirac and other world leaders to &quot;stand up for peace&quot; in the face of extremism during a meeting in New York on September 19, 2006.

Strong French and American diplomatic cooperation at the United Nations played an important role in the Cedar Revolution, which saw the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon. France and the United States also worked together (with some tensions) in crafting UN resolution 1701, intended to bring about a ceasefire in the 2006 Israeli–Lebanese conflict.

=== Sarkozy administration ===
Political relations between France and the United States became friendlier after Nicolas Sarkozy was elected President of France in 2007. Sarkozy, who has been called &quot;Sarko the American&quot;, has said that he &quot;love[s] America&quot; and that he is &quot;proud of his nickname&quot;.

In 2007, Sarkozy delivered a speech before Congress that was seen as a strong affirmation of French-American ties; during the visit, he also met with President George W. Bush as well as senators John McCain and Barack Obama (before they were chosen as presidential candidates). In
2008 Bucharest summit,
Bush with Canada, Poland, Romania, the Czechs and the Baltic States, strongly supported Ukraine and Georgia becoming NATO action plan members; however, Sarkozy strongly opposed with Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Belgium.

During the 2008 presidential election, Barack Obama and John McCain also met with Sarkozy in Paris after securing their respective nominations. Since 2008, France has returned to the integrated command of NATO, a decision that has been appreciated by the United States.　

In 2011 the two countries were part of the multi-state coalition which launched a military intervention in Libya where they led the alliance and conducted 35% of all NATO strikes. However, Sarkozy&#x27;s interests in Libya as being founded on a desire to gain a greater share of oil production, reservation of part of its oil and gas industry for French firms. In his Memoir &quot;A Promised Land&quot; (2020), Obama wrote that Sarkozy proved to be duplicitous and thoroughly unreliable.

=== Hollande administration ===

In 2013, France launched a major operation in Mali to free the country from an &quot;ad hoc&quot; alliance of terrorists and Azawa rebels. The United States provided France with logistical support for Operation Serval.

After president François Hollande pledged support for military action against Syria, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry referred to France as &quot;our oldest ally&quot;. On 10 February 2014, Hollande arrived in the U.S. for the first state visit by a French leader in nearly two decades. 

On September 19, 2014, it was announced that France had joined the United States in bombing Islamic State targets in Iraq as a part of the 2014 American intervention in Iraq. United States president, Barack Obama &amp; the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Martin Dempsey, praised Hollande&#x27;s decision to join the operation: &quot;As one of our oldest and closest allies, France is a strong partner in our efforts against terrorism and we are pleased that French and American service members will once again work together on behalf of our shared security and our shared values.&quot; Said Obama.

=== Macron administration ===
====First Trump presidency 2017–2021====

==== View on the U.S. as a country bordering the Atlantic Ocean ====
On 12 July 2017, President Donald Trump visited France as the guest of President Emmanuel Macron. The two leaders discussed issues that included counter-terrorism and the Syrian Civil War, but played down topics where they sharply disagreed, especially trade, immigration and climate change.

In April 2018, after Macron spoke to the United States Congress and mentioned his desire that US rejoin the Paris Climate Accords to curb climate change, US congressman Thomas Massie
said Macron was &quot;a socialist militarist globalist science-alarmist. The dark future of the American Democratic Party&quot;.

In late 2018, Trump ridiculed Macron over nationalism, tariffs, France&#x27;s World War II defeat, plans for a European army and the French leader&#x27;s approval ratings. This followed Trump&#x27;s Armistice Day visit to Paris which was heavily criticized in both France and the United States. In December, Macron criticised Trump over his decision to withdraw US troops from Syria, stating: &quot;To be allies is to fight shoulder to shoulder. It&#x27;s the most important thing for a head of state and head of the military,&quot; and &quot;An Ally Should Be Dependable.&quot;

In April 2019, the departing French ambassador to the United States Gérard Araud commented on the Trump administration and the US: &quot;Basically, this president and this administration don&#x27;t have allies, don&#x27;t have friends. It&#x27;s really [about] bilateral relationships on the basis of the balance of power and the defense of narrow American interest... we don&#x27;t have interlocutors... [When] we have people to talk to, they are acting, so they don&#x27;t have real authority or access. Basically, the consequence is that there is only one center of power: the White House.&quot; On France working with the US: &quot;...We really don&#x27;t want to enter into a childish confrontation and are trying to work with our most important ally, the most important country in the world.&quot;

In November 2019, Macron questioned the U.S. commitment to Europe, stating: &quot;What we are currently experiencing is the brain death of NATO&quot;, adding &quot;[NATO] only works if the guarantor of last resort functions as such. I&#x27;d argue that we should reassess the reality of what NATO is in the light of the commitment of the United States&quot;.

==== 2019 trade wars ====
In March 2019, at a time when China–U.S. economic relations were engaged in a trade war, Macron and Chinese leader Xi Jinping signed a series of 15 large-scale trade and business agreements totaling 40 billion euros (US$45 billion) which covered many sectors over a period of years. The centerpiece was a €30 billion purchase of airplanes from Airbus. The new trade agreements also covered French chicken exports, a French-built offshore wind farm in China, a Franco-Chinese cooperation fund, billions of Euros of co-financing between BNP Paribas and the Bank of China, billions of euros to be spent on modernizing Chinese factories, and new ship building.

In July, Trump threatened tariffs against France in retaliation for France enacting a digital services tax against multinational firms. With Trump tweeting, &quot;France just put a digital tax on our great American technology companies. If anybody taxes them, it should be their home Country, the USA. We will announce a substantial reciprocal action on Macron&#x27;s foolishness shortly. I&#x27;ve always said American wine is better than French wine!&quot;

French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire indicated France would follow through with its digital tax plans. French Agriculture Minister Didier Guillaume responded on French TV, &quot;It&#x27;s absurd, in terms of having a political and economic debate, to say that if you tax the &#x27;GAFAs&#x27;, I&#x27;ll tax wine. It&#x27;s completely moronic.&quot;

After Trump again indicated his intentions to impose taxes on French wine over France&#x27;s digital tax plans, President of the European Council Donald Tusk stated the European Union would support France and impose retaliatory tariffs on the US. In December 2019, the U.S. government stated that it might impose tariffs up to 100% on $2.4 billion in imports from France of Champagne, handbags, cheese and other products, after reaching the conclusion that France&#x27;s digital services tax would be detrimental to U.S. tech companies.

====Biden presidency 2021–2025====

On 17 September 2021, France recalled Philippe Étienne, the French ambassador to the U.S., and Jean-Pierre Thébault, the French ambassador to Australia after the formation of the AUKUS defence technology between the U.S., Australia and UK (from which France was excluded). As part of the new security agreement, the U.S. will provide nuclear-powered submarines to the Royal Australian Navy, and Australia canceled a US$66 billion deal from 2016 to purchase twelve French-built conventionally powered (diesel) submarines. The French government was furious at the cancellation of the submarine agreement and said that it had been blindsided, calling the decision a &quot;stab in the back&quot;. On 22 September, President Joe Biden and Macron pledged to improve the relationship between the two countries. Étienne returned to the United States on 30 September.

However in early 2022, France worked closely with the U.S. and NATO in helping Ukraine and punishing Russia for its invasion. During Macron&#x27;s visit to the U.S. in December 2022, he and President Biden reaffirmed the cooperation between the two countries. They also discussed the war in Ukraine and economic issues.

In April 2023, Macron argued that European countries should not get involved in US confrontation with China over Taiwan. His long-term plan of &quot;strategic autonomy&quot; angered some Republican lawmakers, who called for a re-evaluation of the US-French relationship.

In November 2023, an agreement extended the validity of E-1 and E-2 visas for French traders and investors in the United States from two to four years.

====Second Trump presidency 2025–present====

<text>Neotame, also known by the brand name Newtame, is a non-caloric artificial sweetener and aspartame analog by NutraSweet. By mass, it is 7,000 to 13,000 times sweeter than sucrose. It has no notable off-flavors when compared to sucrose. It enhances original food flavors. It can be used alone, but is often mixed with other sweeteners to increase their individual sweetness (i.e. synergistic effect) and decrease their off-flavors (&quot;e.g.&quot; saccharin). It is chemically somewhat more stable than aspartame. Its use can be cost effective in comparison to other sweeteners as smaller amounts of neotame are needed.

It is suitable for use in carbonated soft drinks, yogurts, cakes, drink powders, and bubble gums among other foods. It can be used as a table top sweetener for hot drinks like coffee. It covers bitter tastes (e.g. caffeine).

In 2002, FDA approved it as a non-nutritive sweetener and flavor enhancer within the United States in foods generally, except meat and poultry. In 2010, it was approved for use in foods within the European Union with the E number E961. It has also been approved as an additive in many other countries outside US and EU.

Its metabolism is fast and is not retained in the body. Methanol forms in its metabolism. Only trace amounts of neotame are added to foods, so the amount of methanol is insignificant for health. It is safe for type 2 diabetics and those with phenylketonuria.

French scientists Claude Nofre and Jean-Marie Tinti invented neotame. In 1992, they filed a United States patent, which was granted in 1996.

==Safety==
In US and EU, the acceptable daily intake (ADI) of neotame for humans is 0.3 and 2 mg per kg of bodyweight (mg/kg bw), respectively. NOAEL for humans is 200 mg/kg bw per day within EU. Estimated possible daily intakes from foods are well below ADI levels. Ingested neotame can form phenylalanine, but in normal use of neotame, this is not significant to those with phenylketonuria. It also has no adverse effects in type 2 diabetics. It is not considered to be carcinogenic or mutagenic. The Center for Science in the Public Interest has ranked neotame as safe.

==Sweetness==

Water solutions of neotame that are equivalent in sweetness to sucrose water solutions increase logarithmically in relative sweetness as the sucrose concentration of a comparably sweet sucrose solution increases until a plateau is reached. Maximum sweetness is reached at neotame solution concentrations that are relatively as sweet as a water solution that is 15.1 percentage sucrose by weight, i.e., at 15.1 sucrose equivalence % (SE%). For comparison, acesulfame K, cyclamate and saccharin reach their maximum sweetness at 11.6 SE%, 11.3 SE% and 9 SE%, respectively.

Neotame is a high-potency sweetener, and it is 7,000 to 13,000 times sweeter than table sugar. Neotame contains flavor-enhancing properties, and compared to sucrose or aspartame, it has a relatively lower cost per sweetness factor.

==Chemistry==
===Structure===
Neotame is formally a secondary amine of 3,3-dimethylbutanal and aspartame. The latter is a dipeptide of phenylalanine and aspartic acid. Neotame has 2 stereocenters and 4 stereoisomers. Sweetness is due to the (2&quot;S&quot;),(3&quot;S&quot;)-stereoisomer.

===Spectroscopy===
Neotame NMR spectroscopy identifies its structure with a peak at 0.84 ppm indicating the three methyl groups on the carbon chain bonded to the nitrogen.
===Synthesis===
Neotame is synthesized from aspartame through a reductive alkylation with 3,3-dimethylbutyraldehyde in a palladium catalyst with methanol. The stereochemistry of aspartame is conserved during the synthesis and therefore, neotame and aspartame have the same stereochemistry. (2&quot;S&quot;),(3&quot;S&quot;)-stereoisomer of aspartame is needed to synthesize the (2&quot;S&quot;),(3&quot;S&quot;)-stereoisomer of neotame.

===Properties and reactivity===

Neotame has similar stability as aspartame, but has greater stability especially in heated and dairy foods. Increased temperature, moisture or pH increase losses, and are the main relevant properties of a food when considering the stability of neotame. For example, about 90% of original neotame remains after 8 weeks of storage in pH 3.2 beverages. Neotame is especially stable as a dry powder at room temperature and humidity even if mixed with glucose or maltodextrin, and is relatively inert in foods with reducing sugars like fructose.

Unlike aspartame, neotame doesn&#x27;t form diketopiperazines via intra-molecular cyclization due to its N-alkyl substitution with 3,3-dimethylbutyl. This increases its heat stability.

Over 1000 g of neotame dissolves in 1 kg of ethanol at 15 °C. At 15 °C the solubility of neotame is 10.6 g/kg in water and 43.6 g/kg in ethyl acetate. At 25 °C the solubilities are 12.6 g/kg and 77.0 g/kg, respectively. At 40 °C the solubilities are 18.0 g/kg and 238 g/kg, respectively. At 50 °C the solubilities are 25.2 g/kg and 872 g/kg, respectively. Neotame is acidic and its 0.5 wt% solution has a pH of 5.80.

===Manufacture===

Industrially neotame is made from 3,3-dimethylbutanal and aspartame via reductive amination. They are dissolved in methanol, palladium on carbon catalyst is added, air is replaced with hydrogen and the reaction is carried out in room temperature under pressure for a few hours. Catalyst is filtered out. This can be aided with diatomaceous earth. Methanol is distilled followed by addition of water. The mixture is cooled for a few hours, neotame is isolated via centrifugation, washed with water and vacuum dried. Neotame is milled to suitable size.

==Metabolism==

In humans and many other animals like dogs, rats and rabbits, neotame is rapidly but incompletely absorbed. Its metabolites are not retained or concentrated in specific tissues.

In humans at oral doses of about 0.25 mg per kg of bodyweight (mg/kg bw), about 34% is absorbed into blood. Pharmacokinetics of oral doses of 0.1–0.5 mg/kg bw are somewhat linear, and at such doses, maximum neotame concentration in blood plasma is reached after about 0.5 hours with a half-life of about 0.75 hours. In blood and in body in general, non-specific esterases degrade neotame to de-esterified neotame and methanol, which is the main metabolic pathway in humans. De-esterified neotame has a plasma half-life of about 2 hours, and is the main metabolite in plasma.

In humans, over 80% of the original oral dose is excreted in feces and urine within 48 hours and the rest later. About 64% of the original dose is excreted in feces mostly as metabolites. Major metabolite in feces is the de-esterified neotame. Over 1% of the original dose is excreted in feces as &quot;N&quot;-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L-aspartyl - L - phenylalanine. Over 1% is excreted in urine as carnitine conjugate of 3,3-dimethylbutyric acid. Other minor metabolites form.

The major metabolic pathway leads to &quot;N&quot;-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L-aspartyl - L - phenylalanine with a side product of methanol, and the minor pathway happens when the &quot;N&quot;-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L-aspartyl - L - phenylalanine is oxidized into 3,3-dimethylbutyric acid. The side products for the minor pathway is methanol, aspartic acid and phenylalanine.

Methanol from neotame metabolism is insignificant at regulated levels used in foods and in comparison to methanol naturally found in foods.

==Patent==
The patent covering the neotame molecule in the US, 5,480,668, was originally set to expire 7 November 2012, but was extended for 973 days by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The patent expired on 8 July 2015.

<doc id="686260" wikidata="Q1371938" url="?curid=686260" title="Tryphiodorus">
<text>Tryphiodorus (; 3rd or 4th century AD) was an epic poet from Panopolis (today Akhmim), Egypt. His only surviving work is &quot;The Sack of Troy&quot;, an epic poem in 691 verses. Other recorded titles include &quot;Marathoniaca&quot; and &quot;The Story of Hippodamea&quot;.

During his lifetime he was known as Triphiodorus ( [a local god of Akhim]). The confusion between the two spellings occurred already in the sixth century AD due to the widespread confusion of the pronunciation of i/y. A false etymology claims spelling &quot;Tryphiodorus&quot; is based on the Greek word &quot;truphē,&quot; meaning &quot;luxury&quot; or &quot;extravagance&quot;.

== Life ==

There is little known about the life of Triphiodorus other than two entries in the Byzantine encyclopedia the &quot;Suda&quot; (T 1111 and 1112), thought to refer to the same individual. The &quot;Suda&quot; provides his place of birth, that he was a grammarian and epic poet, but not when he lived. Traditionally he was dated to the fifth century because he was thought to imitate the &quot;Dionysiaca&quot; of Nonnus of Panopolis (then dated to the fourth or fifth century), and he was in his turn imitated by Coluthus (he lived under emperor Anastasius I). However, the publication in the 1970s of a fragment of papyrus from Oxyrhynchus (&quot;P. Oxy.&quot; 41.2946), containing lines 391-402 of the Sack of Troy and dated to the third or early fourth century, has made most scholars place him in the third century (see the editions of Livrea, Gerlaud and Dubielzig).

Triphiodorus&#x27; pagan name cannot be considered a proof that he was a pagan, and nothing in his poem allows us to call him a Christian: the reference in lines 604–5 to children paying with their lives for the sins of their parents is not decisive, having classical parallels such as Homer &quot;Iliad&quot; 3.298-301.

== Writings ==

=== &quot;The Taking of Ilios&quot; ===
Triphiodorus&#x27; only extant work is &quot;The Sack of Troy&quot;, a 691-verse epic poem, narrating events from the capture of the Trojan seer Helenus to the sailing of the Greek troops after the capture of Troy.

The poem begins with an invocation to Calliope, the Muse of epic poetry (lines 1–5). The narrative is introduced with a summary of the dire situation of the troops of the Greeks and Trojans (lines 6-39): both are mined by the tiredness of years of fighting and heavy casualties. Then the Greeks capture the Trojan seer and following his advice call Neoptolemus (Achilles’ son) to join their lines and steal the Palladion from Troy (lines 40–56). The construction of the Trojan Horse follows and Triphiodorus gives a long description (lines 57–107). The Greeks have an assembly in which Odysseus convinces the most brave fighters to hide with him in the horse and the rest of the troops to pretend they are fleeing from Troy, while preparing to come back the following night (108-234). The following morning the Trojans discover the disappearance of the Achaean army, inspect their camp and admire the Wooden Horse (235-57). Sinon appears before them covered in blood and convinces Priam to take the horse into their citadel to win Athena&#x27;s attention and avoid her helping the Greeks to return (258-303). The Trojans transport the horse and break the otherwise indestructible walls of Troy to bring it into their citadel (304-57). Cassandra tries to make them come into their senses but Priam orders to lock her up (358-443). While they are celebrating the end of the war, Aphrodite tells Helen to join Menelaus (who is hiding in the horse). Helen goes to the temple of Athena where the horse is kept and calls the names of the wives of the hidden heroes, so as to tempt them to come out. One of them, Anticlus, is about to give in forcing Odysseus to strangle him, while Athena orders Helen to go to her room and light a torch to call the Greek fleet back to Troy for the final battle (454-98a). While the Trojans are overcome by a deep slumber, the gods abandon Troy and Helen and Sinon light torches to guide the return of the Greek fleet (498b-521). The fleet arrives and the hidden warriors leave the horse, giving start to a long night of fighting, full of dramatic episodes (506-663). The poet then decides to put a stop to the narrative and conclude (664-7). The poem finishes with the a brief description of how at the beginning of the new day, the victors check for survivors and booty, set Troy on fire, sacrifice Polyxena to appease the spirit of Achilles, distribute the booty and leave for good (668-91).

The &quot;Sack of Troy&quot; can be considered part of a late antique vogue for mythological epic, which includes the &quot;Posthomerica&quot; by Quintus of Smyrna (third century AD), the &quot;Dionysiaca&quot; by Nonnus of Panopolis (mid fifth c. AD), the &quot;Rape of Helen&quot; (by Colluthus) and the &quot;Description of the Statues in the Terms of Zeuxippus&quot; by Christodorus (early sixth century, transmitted as book 2 of the &quot;Palatine Anthology&quot;).

In this poem Triphiodorus shows a deep understanding of Homer and the grammatical tradition of interpretation of the Homeric poems (e.g. in lines 60-1 he shows that he knows about the editorial tradition of Homer &quot;Iliad&quot; 5.62-4). He quotes Hesiod (especially Triph. 136–8, after Hes. Op. 57–8) and Pindar (Triph. 643, after Pi. N. 7.42), Hellenistic poetry (e.g. Triph. 318–35, after AR 1.362-90). His portrayal of Cassandra is reminiscent of Aeschylus in his &quot;Agamemnon&quot; and Euripides in &quot;Trojan Women&quot;.

Regarding a possible influence of Virgil &quot;Aeneid&quot; 2, there are some glaring differences between the two accounts of the end of Troy: Virgil develops the character of Laocoön (A. 2.40-56, 199–231), and only mentions Cassandra (246-7), while Triphiodorus focuses on Cassandra (358-443) and does not mention Laocoön. On the contrary, Virgil and Triphiodorus are particularly close in the treatment of the figure of Sinon, in particular in their speeches (compare &quot;Aeneid&quot; 2.76-96, 103–4, 189–94, and Triph. 265–82, 292–303).

=== Other works ===
Besides the &quot;Sack of Troy&quot;, the entries of the Suda (T 1111 and 1112) attribute to Triphiodorus two more poems: &quot;Marathoniaca&quot; (&#x27;), probably narrating how Theseus defeated the bull of Marathon; a &quot;Story of Hippodamea&quot; (&#x27;), on one of the females of this name (e.g. the daughter of King Oenomaus, who killed all her suitors in a chariot race until Pelops defeated him). The Suda also mentions two grammatical works: the &quot;Lipogrammatic Odyssey&quot; (probably a re-writing of the &quot;Odyssey&quot; suppressing a letter in each of the books: α in book 1, β in book 2 and so on) and a &quot;Paraphrase of Homer’s Comparisons&quot; (&quot;&quot;), a study of the long comparisons in the Homeric poems (since is a long simile).

==Impact and contribution==
The influence of Triphiodorus has been detected in the &quot;Dionysiaca&quot; of Nonnus of Panopolis (e.g. Nonn. D. 25.306, after Triph. 14), Coluthus’ &quot;Rape of Helen&quot; (e.g. Colut. 195–8, after Triph. 56–61), Musaeus’ &quot;Hero and Leander&quot; (e.g. Musae. 140, after Triph. 32) and Paul the Silentiary (e.g. Descr. Soph. 283, after Triph. 631).

<doc id="686263" wikidata="Q574939" url="?curid=686263" title="White-rumped munia">
<text>The white-rumped munia (Lonchura striata) or white-rumped mannikin, sometimes called striated finch in aviculture, is a small passerine bird from the family of waxbill &quot;finches&quot; (Estrildidae). These are not close relatives of the true finches (Fringillidae) or true sparrows (Passeridae).

It is native to tropical continental Asia and some adjacent islands, and has been naturalized in some parts of Japan. Its domesticated descendant, the [[society finch]] or Bengalese finch, is found worldwide as a pet and a biological model organism.

==Taxonomy==
In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the white-rumped munia in his &quot;Ornithologie&quot; based on a specimen that he believed had been collected from the Isle de Bourbon (Réunion). The specimen is now assumed to have come from Sri Lanka. He used the French name &quot;Le gros-bec de l&#x27;Isle de Bourbon&quot; and the Latin &quot;Coccothraustes Borbonica&quot;. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the white-rumped munia. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Loxia striata&quot; and cited Brisson&#x27;s work. The specific name &quot;striata&quot; is Latin for &quot;striated &quot;. This species is now placed in the genus &quot;Lonchura&quot; that was introduced by the English naturalist William Henry Sykes in 1832.

There are six subspecies:
* &quot;L. s. acuticauda&quot; (Hodgson, 1836) – northern Indian mainland below c. 1,500 metres ASL, north through the Himalayas foothills of Bhutan and Nepal to the Dehradun region of Uttarakhand, India across to Bangladesh to northern Indochina
:Medium brown above, except on the face and remiges, buffy below
* &quot;L. s. striata&quot; (Linnaeus, 1766) – southern Indian mainland, Sri Lanka
:Dark chocolate-brown above, white below
* &quot;L. s. fumigata&quot; (Walden, 1873) – Andaman Islands
* &quot;L. s. semistriata&quot; (Hume, 1874) – Car Nicobar and Central (Nancowry) group, Nicobar Islands
* &quot;L. s. subsquamicollis&quot; (Baker, ECS, 1925) – Malay Peninsula to southern Indochina
* &quot;L. s. swinhoei&quot; (Cabanis, 1882) – east central and east China, Taiwan

A domesticated hybrid called the society finch, sometimes called &quot;Lonchura domestica&quot; is said by some sources to have &quot;L. s. striata&quot; in its ancestry, although other theories suggest contributions from the white-throated munia. The hybrid with numerous variants in plumage are thought to have been established by aviculturists in Japan.

==Description==
The white-rumped munia is approximately 10 to 11 cm in length, with a stubby grey bill and a long black pointed tail. The adults are brown above and on the breast, and lighter below; the rump is white. There is some variation between the subspecies, but the sexes are almost impossible to distinguish in all subspecies; males have a more bulky head and bill.

==Habitat and distribution==
The white-rumped munia is a common resident breeder ranging from the Indian subcontinent to southern China east to Taiwan, and through Southeast Asia south to Sumatra; it frequents open woodland, grassland and scrub, and is well able to adapt to agricultural land use. It is a gregarious bird which feeds mainly on seeds, moving through the undergrowth in groups and sometimes accompanying other birds such as puff-throated babblers (&quot;Pellorneum ruficeps&quot;). The nest is a large domed grass structure in a tree, bush or grass into which three to eight white eggs are laid. They are also known to use abandoned nests of &quot;Baya weaver&quot;. They are often found near water and have been observed feeding on algae. It has been suggested that they obtain protein from their diet of algae often in the species &quot;Spirogyra&quot;, which grows in paddy fields.

It is a common and widespread bird across its large range, and is thus not considered a threatened species by the IUCN. In fact, it may locally become a nuisance pest of millets and similar grains. Even the Nicobar Islands subspecies with its limited range seems to be able to cope well with human settlement. As it is a drab-coloured and rather reclusive bird inhabiting dense undergrowth, the white-rumped munia is not necessarily conspicuous even where it occurs in considerable numbers.

<doc id="686268" wikidata="Q4704305" url="?curid=686268" title="Al Lohman">
<text>Al Lohman (January 15, 1933, Sergeant Bluff, Iowa – October 14, 2002, Rancho Mirage, California) was a personality and comedian with a long career in American radio from the 1950s through the 1980s and into the 1990s. Among his early career stops was a stint as morning man at New York City top-40 station WABC (AM) when it first adopted a pop music format in 1960. But he&#x27;s best remembered as a Los Angeles, California radio personality who, along with Roger Barkley, had the top-rated morning drive &quot;The Lohman and Barkley Show&quot; on KFI Los Angeles through most of the 1970s and early 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;oldradio/LA/nw&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;oldradio/LA/nw2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;oldradio/LA/nw3&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;oldradio/LA/nw4&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;earthsignals/Newcomb/WALK&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Their fame extended beyond the Los Angeles area, as the duo were frequent guests on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; and were hosts of two short-lived game shows. The first was a 1969 NBC daytime series, &quot;Lohman &amp; Barkley&#x27;s Name Droppers&quot;, while the second was a syndicated 1979 entry, &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot;.

==The &quot;cast of characters&quot;==
Audiences tuned in by the thousands to hear Lohman&#x27;s quick wit and vast array of character voices play against Barkley&#x27;s straight man routine. Among Lohman’s characters were the obsequious con-man and alleged farm expert “Maynard Farmer,” whose toadying “That there’s the finest (whatever) that I’ve ever seen there, sir” won him numerous undeserved rewards; “Otis Elevator”, a good-natured handyman; &quot;Judge Roy Bean,&quot; a hanging judge, former big band leader and supposed ex-member of the Bee Gees; and human interest reporter “Ted J. Balogna” and his wife “W. Eva Schneider-Balogna”, the poetry lady who seemed never to have any poetry, who supposedly drove to the Wilshire Boulevard studio each morning on Ted’s tractor (and later, a fire engine with W. clinging precariously to the back) from their home in a tree house in Brawley, a real town in Imperial County, nearly away. These characters and others were also regular occurrences in a segment called &quot;Light Of My Life,&quot; a spoof of daytime soap operas.

One character had a more lasting impact than the others. &quot;Dominic Longo&quot; was the real name of one of the show&#x27;s sponsors, the owner of a fledgling Toyota dealership in nearby El Monte. The commercials for the dealership were live, mostly ad-libbed and might run as long as two minutes. Roger Barkley &quot;interviewed&quot; Lohman&#x27;s Mafioso-sounding Longo in the commercials. Dominic Longo didn&#x27;t simply &quot;wheel and deal.&quot; Instead, he &quot;whelt and dealt like no one ever whelt and dealt before.&quot; Longo also didn&#x27;t &quot;habla español.&quot; He &quot;hobbled spaniels,&quot; and so on. The commercials were an incredible success and played a huge part in helping make Longo Toyota the nation&#x27;s largest Toyota dealer.

Among the more outrageous spoofs given its subject matter was a series of recurring commercials for the fictitious &quot;Doc in the Box&quot; medical group with their promise of &quot;drive-thru vasectomies.&quot; The name in turn was a spoof of the American fast food chain, Jack in the Box.

==The unexpected split and post-radio contributions==

In 1986, Roger Barkley suddenly and unexpectedly quit the duo after twenty-two years, much to Lohman&#x27;s shock and surprise. Barkley left KFI for a solo stint at beautiful music format KJOI-FM 99 (now KYSR) till 1989 and in the fall of 1990 teamed with Ken Minyard on talk radio KABC to replace the just retired Bob Arthur as co-host of the morning drive show &quot;The Ken and Bob Company&quot;, a play on the station&#x27;s call letters, rechristened as &quot;The Ken and Barkley Company&quot; with his arrival. Lohman and Barkley never spoke again after that. Lohman stayed at KFI and teamed for a while with Gary Owens, a Los Angeles personality best known as the wisecracking announcer on the &quot;Laugh-In&quot; television show.

Although Lohman and Barkley&#x27;s morning KFI show was mostly talk and skits, an occasional tune was played, probably to give the guys a restroom break. In a later &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article regarding his sudden exit from KFI, Barkley was quoted as saying that he warned their program director that their constant playing of the same Eagles songs over and over was very aggravating to him. He said if he heard Hotel California one more time that he might just get up and walk out one day. He also alluded to Lohman&#x27;s increasing undisciplined ways including a growing tendency to not be at the station in time for the start of the show. Obviously Barkley was simply tiring of the situation. Years later on the Los Angeles Ken and Barkley KABC radio show, when Ken Minyard mentioned Al Lohman, Barkley remarked &quot;he says that I destroyed his career.&quot; Ironically, Barkley went through a bit of the same. The &quot;Ken and Barkley&quot; show was dropping in ratings in the very competitive LA morning market, and Barkley was dropped too, though Minyard continued on with a new format. He said that Barkley was very upset, but that the station demanded a change.

In 1989, KFI brought Lohman back and teamed him with radio legend Gary Owens. They created &quot;L.A.&#x27;s morning show&quot;. It was produced by Jeff Gehringer. The show, which featured comedy and celebrity interviews, lasted for 18 months.

In the early 1990s, Lohman semi-retired to Palm Springs where he hosted a morning show on easy listening KPLM-FM. Upon the station&#x27;s move to a contemporary country music format, Lohman moved his morning show to KCMJ AM (now KNWQ), Palm Springs&#x27; oldest radio station.

Lohman also appeared in film and was credited as simply &quot;Lohman&quot; for his parts as a film critic in the 1987 comedy &quot;Amazon Women on the Moon&quot; (Roger Barkley played alongside him and was credited as &quot;Barkley&quot;) and the narrator of the 1988 comedy, &quot;Spies, Lies &amp; Naked Thighs.&quot;

On October 28, 1999, Lohman appeared as part of an all-star panel of Los Angeles radio legends at the Museum of Television and Radio in Beverly Hills, CA. At the beginning of the event, recorded bits from each personality&#x27;s past was played to introduce them. When Lohman was introduced, a segment of the Lohman and Barkley show called &quot;Seven Second Delay&quot; was played. After Lohman was brought on stage, he stated: &quot;When you were playing the clips, that hit me, what a talented group of talented people I&#x27;m associated with. And including, in all fairness, I re-realized what an outstanding straight man Roger Barkley was&quot; (Barkley had died two years prior). The house erupted into applause.

Al Lohman died October 14, 2002, at age 69 of complications from bladder cancer. Bandleader Ray Conniff died at about the same time, and while Conniff&#x27;s obituary in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; rated an entire column, Lohman&#x27;s took up nearly three pages.

His partnership with Roger Barkley earned Lohman a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the only Palm Springs radio personality so honored.

<text>Exit English is the second album by the American melodic hardcore band Strike Anywhere, released in 2003.

==Background==
Strike Anywhere released their debut studio album &quot;Change Is a Sound&quot; in August 2001. In between various tours supporting it, the members had alternative jobs: bassist Garth Petrie was a mover; drummer Eric Kane cooked in different cafés; guitarist Matt Smith ran a recording studio in his basement; guitarist Matt Sherwood served as an electrical engineer; and vocalist Thomas Barnett worked in markets and health food stores. In March 2003, the band toured the US and Canada, with support from the Explosion, Majority Rule, and the Exit. The following month, the band began recording their next album with producer Brian McTernan at Salad Days in Maryland. Barnett said McTernan was &quot;really hard&quot; on the band, with Barnett doing his vocals for eight hours a day, &quot;and none of it was good enough&quot; for him.

==Composition==
Musically, the sound of &quot;Exit English&quot; has been described as hardcore punk, melodic hardcore, and punk rock. Barnett&#x27;s vocals were compared to Jason Shevchuk of Kid Dynamite and Ari Katz of Lifetime. Smith said the album&#x27;s title refers to &quot;thinking for yourself and not embracing American ideals worldwide&quot;. Barnett&#x27;s notebooks, which contained lyrics and song ideas, were stolen from his car shortly before recording, prompting the rest of the members to aid in the writing. Barnett said the album was based on local stories, like &quot;Change Is a Sound&quot;, the that it is &quot;at once 10 times more [about their hometown] Richmond, about secret histories, slave insurrections, women riots pointing guns at their husbands and brothers, the Confederate army burning the city. All of these ideas, stories, and histories that were hidden from our public education informed in our songs&quot;. He mentioned that it was a lot more melodic that its predecessor, saying that the others had &quot;written more harmonic guitar parts&quot;.

&quot;We Amplify&quot; acts as a prologue to &quot;Blaze&quot;, which alongside &quot;To the World&quot; were viewed as an East Coast iteration of the Offspring. &quot;Blaze&quot; features Barnett quoting lines from Percy Bysshe Shelley&#x27;s poem &quot;The Masque of Anarchy&quot;. &quot;New Architects&quot; and &quot;Aluminium Union&quot; were referred to as faster Good Riddance songs. Barnett described &quot;Lights Go Out&quot; as the &quot;most punch-you-in-the-face visceral&quot; track on the album. &quot;Fifth Estate&quot; is a hardcore punk power ballad about the control of mass media. For &quot;Modern Life&quot;, Petrie asked Barnett to write about topics such as Animal Liberation and vegetarianism. Discussing &quot;Extinguish&quot;, Barnett said it was about the &quot;fact that in the States only the story of the rich men is ever told, how they built America.&quot; It was a homage to their hometown of Richmond. The penultimate song &quot;In the Fingernails&quot;, which begins with handcalps and a tambourine, is an anti-war track.

==Release==
In April 2003, the band supported AFI for a few headlining US shows, and appeared at Friendly Fest. On June 4, 2003, &quot;Exit English&quot; was announced for release in September. On June 27, the album&#x27;s track listing was posted online. In July 2003, the band were set to go on a tour of Japan; however, they were detained at a Tokyo airport. The band explained that their Japanese promotor had failed to acquire them visas to play in the country. As a result, the shows were cancelled, and the band was placed under house arrest. After some negotiations, they were allowed to fly to Australia to begin a tour there. On July 29, 2003, &quot;Infrared&quot; and &quot;To the World&quot; were posted on the label&#x27;s website. In August 2003, the band toured the west coast with From Ashes Rise and the Disaster. &quot;Exit English&quot; was made available for streaming on August 18, before being released on September 30, 2003, through Jade Tree. Barnett explained that the title referred to English colonialism.

Between September and November 2003, the band supported the Bouncing Souls on their headlining US tour. The stint included an appearance a &quot;CMJ&quot; showcase. Following this, the band went on a European tour with New Mexican Disaster Squad, which ran into December. A music video for &quot;Infrared&quot; was posted online on November 30, 2003; Barnett said the person they made it was the &quot;Brian McTernan of film music videos&quot;, explaining that he understand the music from having a background in hardcore. He mentioned that video mainly consisted of &quot;post-production images, images from WTO police riots, and putting together these collages of visuals&quot;. In February and March 2004, the band went on an US tour with Fifth Hour Hero; F-Minus and Silverstein appeared on select dates. Following this, the band headlined the Jade Tre United Tour, which occurred in the Midwest and East Coast, and featured From Ashes Rise, Challenger, Paint It Black, and Breather Resist. The band headlined some shows in Europe, before touring the territory as part of the Deconstruction Tour in May and June. In July and August, they toured the US with New Mexican Disaster Squad and Engine Down, and appeared at that year&#x27;s Hellfest. They trekked across the US again, this time as part of the Rock Against Bush tour in September and October 2004. They closed out the year with a tour of Germany with the Donots. &quot;Two Fuses&quot;, an outtake from the album&#x27;s recording sessions, appeared on the band&#x27;s first compilation album &quot;To Live in Discontent&quot; in 2005.

==Reception==

&quot;Exit English&quot; was met with generally favorable reviews from music critics. AllMusic reviewer Charles Spano wrote that the album was &quot;as fun as it is serious -- equal parts pogo punk and agitprop anti-authoritarianism.&quot; He said that the &quot;only real drawback&quot; was that Strike Anywhere&#x27;s contemporaries were pushing their sound, while they were &quot;firmly planted in the moment during 1994&quot;, which wasn&#x27;t &quot;a bad place to be, but the members of Strike Anywhere have more in them than that.&quot; &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot; Mikael Wood noted that &quot;Exit English&quot; was rooted in a &quot;tradition of positively minded, progressively political hardcore [...] which means that what the disc lacks in musical subtlety, it makes for in well-meaning sentiment&quot;. Stuart Green of &quot;Exclaim!&quot; found that the band took &quot;a few musical chances by slowing down the tempos and revisiting the old-school punk of the late 70s&quot;, showcasing growth &quot;both musically and lyrically.&quot; &quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot; writer Sean Richardson said for a punk act with a &quot;strident anti-corporate agenda, Strike Anywhere are intent on keeping their lyrics positive and their music upbeat&quot;.

Punknews.org staff member Brian Shultz wrote that &quot;Exist English&quot; had a &quot;more complete sound&quot; than their debut, with Strike Anywhere showing that they &quot;have lit the match and have already set it ablaze.&quot; Andrew Sacher of &quot;BrooklynVegan&quot; remarked that it was &quot;more approachable record than the band&#x27;s debut, but it stays just as true to the band&#x27;s hardcore roots and political message&quot;. &quot;Ox-Fanzine&quot; reviewer Joachim Hiller called &quot;Exist English&quot; &quot;a rousing, mature album&quot;, full of &quot;rousing hardcore&quot; that &quot;extends the known old school elements here more than before with newer elements, sometimes only stopping a hand&#x27;s breadth in front of screamo colleagues like Thrice and Co.&quot; &quot;Rock Hard&quot; writer Jan Jaedike said &quot;Exist English&quot; had a handful of &quot;really fine hooks [that] fall off without neglecting the aggro portion. Good slice!&quot; &quot;Now&quot; contributor Dylan Young wrote that the album consisted of &quot;a tight blend of strident rhythms, scattershot drums, casual chatter and laryngitis-inducing wails.&quot; He mentioned that &quot;[t]one-wise, it’s a little unrealistic – you know, bleeding-heart , obstructed, transcended and anthemically hopeful.&quot;

<text>Öskjuvatn (, &quot;Askja Lake&quot;) is a lake in the Highlands of Iceland. Its surface area is about 11 km2. With a depth of , it is the second-deepest lake in Iceland after Jökulsárlón.

The lake is situated in the crater of the volcano Askja in the northeast of the glacier Vatnajökull. The name &quot;Öskjuvatn&quot; simply means &quot;Askja lake&quot;. Like the neighbouring crater Víti, it was created by an enormous volcanic eruption in 1875.

==History==
The lake was first surveyed in 1876 by Professor Johnstrup and Lieutenant Caroc. It was roughly circular with a diameter of about 4000 feet (1220 m) and below the floor of Askja caldera. Its water was light-green, and covered from recently erupted pumice, at the temperature of .

In 1878 the lake was about below the Askja caldera floor, (8 km) in circumference and at a temperature of .

In 1881 the lake temperature was down .

In 1884 the lake temperature was down , the northwestern length of the lake was and the lake was below the floor of Askja caldera.
On July 10, 1907, two German scientists, Walter von Knebel and Max Rudloff disappeared while exploring the lake in a small boat. The lake was described at the time as almost
rectangular and about and below the floor of Askja caldera. Knebel&#x27;s fiancée, Ina von Grumbkow, led an expedition in search of them with a vulcanologist Hans Reck, but no trace of them was ever found. Suppositions at the time suggested that seismic volcanic disturbances could have caused a landslip or similar occurrence, and recorded that only two days previously the telegraph cable to Iceland had been broken by deep water disturbances for the first time since it was laid, close to the Icelandic coast. Reck&#x27;s 1908 measurements were a mean lake temperature of , dimensions of , no change in surface height, and a depth of more than .

In 1917 the lake surface was found to be above sea level, with a temperature of .

Hans Reck visited again in 1932 and noted the lakes shape had changed following previous eruptions. There were other eruptions before the first full bathymetry in 1963.

The maximum depth of was possibly greater in a 2012 survey but temperature corrections precluded an accurate figure. What is known is that the lake floor has subsided since 1876.

<doc id="686953" wikidata="Q1119274" url="?curid=686953" title="Grantha script">
<text>The Grantha script (Grantha: 𑌗𑍍𑌰𑌨𑍍𑌥𑌲𑌿𑌪𑌿; ; ) is a classical South Indian Brahmic script, found particularly in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Originating from the Pallava script, the Grantha script is related to Tamil and Vatteluttu scripts. The modern Malayalam script of Kerala is a direct descendant of the Grantha script. The Southeast Asian and Indonesian scripts such as Thai and Javanese respectively, as well as South Asian Tigalari and Sinhala scripts, are derived or closely related to Grantha through the early Pallava script. The Pallava script or Pallava Grantha emerged in the 4th century CE and was used until the 7th century CE, in India. This early Grantha script was used to write Sanskrit texts, inscriptions on copper plates and stones of Hindu temples and monasteries. It was also used for classical Manipravalam – a language that is a blend of Sanskrit and Tamil. From it evolved Middle Grantha by the 7th century, and Transitional Grantha by about the 8th century, which remained in use until about the 14th century. Modern Grantha has been in use since the 14th century and into the modern era, to write classical texts in Sanskrit and Dravidian languages. It is also used to chant hymns and in traditional Vedic schools.

The Tamil purist movement of the colonial era sought to purge the Grantha script from use and use the Tamil script exclusively. According to Kailasapathy, this was a part of Tamil nationalism and amounted to regional ethnic chauvinism.

==History==
In Sanskrit, &quot;grantha&quot; is literally &#x27;a knot&#x27;. It is a word that was used for books, and the script used to write them. This stems from the practice of binding inscribed palm leaves using a length of thread held by knots. Grantha was widely used to write Sanskrit in the Tamil-speaking parts of South Asia from about the 5th century CE into modern times.
The Grantha script was also historically used for writing Manipravalam, a blend of Tamil and Sanskrit which was used in the exegesis of Manipravalam texts. This evolved into a fairly complex writing system which required that Tamil words be written in the Tamil script and Sanskrit words be written in the Grantha script. By the 15th century, this had evolved to the point that both scripts would be used within the same word – if the root was derived from Sanskrit it would be written in the Grantha script, but any Tamil suffixes which were added to it would be written using the Tamil script. This system of writing went out of use when Manipravalam declined in popularity, but it was customary to use the same convention in printed editions of texts originally written in Manipravalam until the middle of the 20th century.

In modern times, the Tamil-Grantha script is used in religious contexts by Tamil-speaking Hindus. For example, they use the script to write a child&#x27;s name for the first time during the naming ceremony, for the Sanskrit portion of traditional wedding cards, and for announcements of a person&#x27;s last rites. It is also used in many religious almanacs to print traditional formulaic summaries of the coming year.

==Types of Grantha==

===Pallava Grantha===

An archaic and ornamental variety of Grantha is sometimes referred to as Pallava Grantha. It was used by the Pallava in some inscriptions from the 4th century CE to the 7th century CE, in India. Examples are the Mamallapuram Tiruchirapalli Rock Cut Cave Inscriptions and Kailasantha Inscription.

===Middle Grantha===
Middle Grantha first appeared in the Kuram copper plates, dating from around 675 CE, and was used until the end of the 8th century CE.

===Transitional Grantha===
Transitional Grantha is traceable from the 8th or 9th century CE, until around the 14th century CE. The Tulu-Malayalam script is derivative of Transitional Grantha dating to the 8th or 9th century CE, which later split into two distinct scripts – Tigalari and Malayalam.

===Modern Grantha===
Grantha in the present form dates from the 14th century CE. The oldest modern manuscript has been dated to the end of the 16th century CE. Two varieties are found in modern era Grantha texts: the &#x27;Brahmanic&#x27; or square form used by Hindus, and the &#x27;Jain&#x27; or round form used by Jains.

==Modern Grantha==
The Grantha script has evolved over time, and shares similarities with the modern Tamil Script.

===Consonants===
As in other Brahmic scripts Grantha consonant signs have an inherent vowel, typically corresponding to , so, for example, the letter is pronounced .

===Consonant clusters===
Grantha has two ways of representing consonant clusters. Sometimes, consonants in a cluster may form ligatures.

Ligatures are normally preferred whenever they exist. If no ligatures exist, &quot;stacked&quot; forms of consonants are written, just as in Kannada and Telugu, with the lowest member of the stack being the only &quot;live&quot; consonant and the other members all being vowel-less. Note that ligatures may be used as members of stacks also.

====A few special cases====

*When , &quot;ya&quot; is the final consonant in a cluster, it is written as a ya-phala . 
*When a cluster contains a non-initial , &quot;ra&quot;, it becomes a &quot;ra-vattu&quot;, .
*When a cluster begins with a , &quot;ra&quot;, it becomes a &quot;reph&quot; and is shifted to the end of the cluster. 
*If a cluster contains both a &quot;reph&quot; and a &quot;ya-phala&quot;, the &quot;ya-phala&quot; is written last.

===Vowels and syllables===
Grantha includes five long vowels, five short vowels, two vocalic consonants, ṛ and ḷ which are treated as vowels and may be short or long, and two part-vowels, &quot;anusvara&quot; ṁ and &quot;visarga&quot;, ḥ. Independent vowel letters are used for word-initial vowels. Otherwise, vowels, vocalics, and part-vowels are written as diacritics attached to consonants. Each consonant in Grantha includes an inherent vowel &quot;a&quot;, so the letter , for example, is pronounced ka. Adding a vowel diacritic modifies the vowel sound, so plus the diacritic , gives the syllable , &quot;ko&quot;. The absence of a vowel is marked with a virāma , for example, plus creates an isolated consonant &quot;k&quot;.

There are a few ligatures of consonants with vowel diacritics and of consonants with &quot;virāma&quot;.

===Numerals===


===Sample text===
;Sanskrit in Grantha Script

;Latin script transliteration

;English
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.
(Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights)

==Comparison with other South Indian scripts==

==Unicode==

Grantha script was added to the Unicode Standard in June 2014 with the release of version 7.0.
The Unicode block for Grantha is U+11300–U+1137F:
===Unification with Tamil===
Some proposed to reunify Grantha and Tamil; however, the proposal triggered discontent by some. Considering the sensitivity involved, it was determined that the two scripts should not be unified, except for the numerals.

<text>Change Is a Sound is the debut album by the punk rock band Strike Anywhere, released in 2001. The album&#x27;s lyrics explore such themes as women&#x27;s rights (&quot;Chalkline&quot;), and police brutality (&quot;Sunset on 32nd Street&quot;). The song &quot;Refusal&quot; was also featured on the soundtrack to the skateboarding video game Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground. The band signed to Jade Tree in February 2001, and recorded their debut album in April 2001. 

== Additional information ==
The picture for the cover of this album was taken on their first European Tour. The head seen in the side of the image is that of Tony Pence, lead singer of the punk band Deep Sleep and former Reptillian Records employee.

Barnett described album as being &quot;built on a lot of local experiences, like local stories&quot;. The title of track 8, &quot;S.S.T.&quot;, is an abbreviation of the Latin phrase &quot;Sic semper tyrannis&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Change Is a Sound&quot; was released in August 2001. In September, the band appeared on the last few dates on the Plea for Peace/Take Action Tour. Between October and December 2001, the band toured across Europe with As Friends Rust and Planes Mistaken for Stars. In January and February 2002, the band supported the Mighty Mighty Bosstones on their headlining east coast US tour. Following this, the band toured with Anti-Flag until April as part of their Mobilie for Peace tour. In June and July 2002, the band supported Good Riddance on their headlining US tour. Barnett said they were offered a supporting slot for Soul Brains, &quot;but we had been out for like 9 weeks already and we had to get home and get back to work.

<text>The Milwaukee Admirals are a professional ice hockey team in the American Hockey League (AHL). They play in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States, at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee Panther Arena. They are the highest level affiliate of the National Hockey League (NHL)&#x27;s Nashville Predators.

The team has been playing since 1970, originally as an amateur team called the Milwaukee Wings, but were renamed as the Admirals after their first season. They played an independent schedule until joining the semiprofessional United States Hockey League (USHL) in 1973. In 1977, the Admirals joined the International Hockey League (IHL) when the USHL transitioned to a junior league. When the IHL ceased operations in 2001, the Admirals joined the AHL.

==History==
===Independent era===
The Admirals first took to the ice in the winter of 1970 as an amateur club known as the Milwaukee Wings. Sponsored by the Wisconsin Citizens Benefit Association, they lost their first game on January 25 when the Madison All-Stars beat them 17–7. They got their first win five days later when they defeated the Milwaukee Winter Club 10–8. They finished the season with 8 wins and 7 loses.

The next year the team was sold by the original owner Reed Fansher to a group of investors. One of the investors, Erwin J. Merar, owned an appliance store and the team was renamed the &quot;Admirals&quot; after a brand of household appliances sold in Merar&#x27;s store.

===United States Hockey League era===
Beginning with the 1973–74 season the Admirals joined the United States Hockey League. Their first season in a league was not particularly successful as they ended the season in last place in their division. They won only 11 games, lost 35, and tied two games that season.

The Admirals won the USHL league championship in 1976, winning seven straight games in the league&#x27;s playoffs. In the off-season, the team was purchased by former Chicago Blackhawks announcer Lloyd Pettit and his wife, Jane Bradley Pettit.

===International Hockey League era===
For the 1977–78 season the Admirals joined the International Hockey League as the USHL was becoming a strictly amateur league. The Admirals appeared in the IHL&#x27;s Turner Cup finals only once (1983), where they lost to Toledo in six games.

=== American Hockey League era ===
The Admirals, along with five other IHL franchises, joined the American Hockey League for the 2001–02 season when the IHL ceased operations. The team was allowed to keep their nickname despite the presence of the Norfolk Admirals in the AHL, as Milwaukee had used the nickname since 1970, well before the Norfolk team was established as the Hampton Roads Admirals in the ECHL. (In the 2015–16 season, that AHL franchise moved to the AHL&#x27;s Pacific Division as the fourth incarnation of the San Diego Gulls, and a Norfolk club was re-established in the ECHL.)

They won their first Calder Cup in 2004 when they defeated the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins. Prior to the finals, Milwaukee needed seven games to defeat the Cincinnati Mighty Ducks in the first round. Then the Admirals defeated the Chicago Wolves in six games to advance to the conference finals. The Admirals then eliminated the Rochester Americans four games to one. Milwaukee went on to sweep the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins to win the Calder Cup. The Admirals completed a rare postseason run in which they needed one fewer game to eliminate their opponents in each subsequent series.

The Admirals were purchased in June 2005 by a group of investors, led by Harris J. Turer, including Milwaukee Brewers owner Mark Attanasio, assistant general manager Gord Ash, and pitcher Ben Sheets. The Brewers subsequently became the sole uniform sponsor of the Admirals, and the Admirals wear a Brewers logo patch on their sweaters.

The Admirals won their second division title as a member of the American Hockey League in 2006, clinching the title on the last day of their schedule with a win over the Grand Rapids Griffins.

In the 2006 Calder Cup playoffs after narrowly winning a seven-game playoff series over the Iowa Stars, Milwaukee swept both the Houston Aeros and Grand Rapids Griffins to advance to their second Calder Cup final series. To their disappointment, the Admirals would lose in six games to the Hershey Bears.

On August 1, 2006, the Admirals unveiled a new logo and a change in color scheme from the traditional red-and-blue to black, white, and light blue. They used this logo until 2015, when the Admirals unveiled another new logo, keeping the Lake Michigan blue from 2006, but replaced black with navy blue. Also, the skeleton motif was kept with the hat that adorns the skeleton&#x27;s head as a callback to the Admirals logos used from 1976 to 1997. This logo received very positive reviews, resulting in it becoming SportsLogos.net&#x27;s 2015 Best New Primary Logo of the Year.

On March 16, 2016, Milwaukee Admirals owner/CEO Harris Turer along with Wisconsin Center District (WCD) announced that the Admirals signed a 10-year contract, bringing the Admirals to the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee Panther Arena for the 2016-17 AHL season. This 10-year contract also results in a $6.4 million investment to bring the arena up to AHL standards with the Admirals contributing two million and the rest being supplied by the Wisconsin Center District.

The team won its second regular season championship in the 2019–20 season, which was curtailed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the ongoing restrictions during the pandemic, the Admirals were one of three teams that opted out of the 2020–21 AHL season. After the Admirals announced their season was cancelled, team ownership also announced that all of their full-time employees would still be paid for the year.

On November 17, 2023, the Admirals made history when defenseman Luke Prokop made his AHL debut as the first openly gay player in the league&#x27;s history.

During the 2023-24 season, the Admirals set a new franchise record of 19 consecutive wins, which is also the second-longest winning streak in AHL history as of 2024. The winning streak lasted from January 5, 2024, which was also their first game of the calendar year, until February 25.

=== League membership ===
* 1970–1973: independent
*1973–1977: United States Hockey League
*1977–2001: International Hockey League
*2001–present: American Hockey League

===NHL affiliation===
The Admirals have been the top-level affiliate of the Nashville Predators since that team&#x27;s founding in 1998.
Coincidentally, the two cities&#x27; baseball franchises share a reverse affiliation, as the Nashville Sounds are the Triple-A affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers.

During the 2006–07 season, the Admirals were also part of an unusual affiliation agreement with the Edmonton Oilers, who used five partial affiliates in the AHL for the 2006–07 season. These five affiliates included the Milwaukee Admirals, the Grand Rapids Griffins, the Iowa Stars, the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, and the Hamilton Bulldogs. This arrangement lasted one season, as the Oilers announced a three-year affiliation with the Springfield Falcons on March 19, 2007.

=== Mascot ===

During the 1998 Admirals rebranding efforts, the Admirals created a new mascot, named Roscoe. Roscoe is a &quot;sea dog&quot;-like animal with bright orange fur, a hockey puck-shaped nose, and wears a bicorne admiral&#x27;s hat along with an Admirals jersey with the number 98, representing the year Roscoe joined the Admirals organization.

At times during breaks and intermission, Roscoe will also ride a zamboni modified to look like a pirate ship. When interacting with fans, Roscoe will sometimes take souvenir hockey pucks from fans and place them on his nose.

In 2014, when the Nashville Predators&#x27; mascot, Gnash, got injured, Roscoe was &quot;called up&quot; to the Predators and to the NHL, joining with other mascots to entertain fans in Nashville while Gnash recovered.

<text>Langisjór () is a lake in the western part of Vatnajökull National Park, Iceland. It is around 20 km in length and up to 2 km wide, with a total surface area of about and a depth of 75m at its deepest point.

The lake is situated rather far from civilisation at the south-western border of Vatnajökull at an altitude of 670 m above sea level. Environmental campaigners have expressed concern at government plans to site an industrial dam on the lake.

<text>Artillery are a Danish thrash metal band. They participated in the early development of the genre, and were pioneers in the Danish thrash metal scene with their highly energetic, riff-centric and often fast-paced music. After releasing three full-length albums and touring extensively throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Artillery disbanded in 1991, but reunited seven years later, only to disband once again in 2000. However, they reformed again in 2007 and are still together today.

==History==
The band formed in June 1982 in Taastrup, a suburb of Copenhagen by drummer Carsten Nielsen and guitarist Jørgen Sandau. Artillery shared a rehearsal room with Mercyful Fate and Metallica for some time, whereby Artillery&#x27;s sound also took some inspiration. The Stützer brothers had originally formed their band under the name Devil&#x27;s Symphony in 1980. Later on, they named the band Artillery based on the track &quot;Heavy Artillery&quot; from Tank&#x27;s album &quot;Filth Hounds of Hades&quot;. After trying several musicians, the line up became guitarists Jørgen Sandau and Michael Stützer, bassist Morten Stützer, drummer Carsten Nielsen and singer Carsten Lohmann . The group recorded the demos &quot;We Are the Dead&quot; (1983), &quot;Shellshock&quot; and &quot;Deeds of Darkness&quot; in 1984.

Artillery&#x27;s first commercial debut came in early 1985 with the inclusion of the song &quot;Hey Woman,&quot; on Volume One of the Speed Metal Hell compilation series which was released on New Renaissance Records. Later that year, Carsten Lohmann left and was replaced by Flemming Rönsdorf. Later the same year, Artillery recorded a fourth demo, &quot;Fear of Tomorrow&quot;, signed with Neat Records, and released their first album, also titled &quot;Fear of Tomorrow&quot;. In 1986, Carsten Nielsen was contacted by Quorthon of Bathory asking him if he was interested in drumming for Bathory. Nielsen turned down the offer since he thought Artillery would become a much bigger band than Bathory. Their second album, &quot;Terror Squad&quot;, was released in 1987.

Guitarist Jørgen Sandau Putza left the band in 1989. Bassist Morten Stützer took over his position, lending the bass to recruit Peter Thorslund. Same year Artillery traveled to Tashkent, USSR (currently the capital of Uzbekistan), where they performed at a local music festival. Their third album, &quot;By Inheritance&quot;, was released in 1990 on both LP and CD, by Roadrunner Records and included a song called &quot;7:00 from Tashkent&quot;. Artillery disbanded in 1991, some of the members pursuing musical projects of their own during the rest of the 1990s.

Following the 1998 release of an Artillery compilation CD, &quot;Deadly Relics&quot; by Mighty Music, featuring a mix of old demo recordings and two songs from the 1989 promotional tape, the band reformed to record a fourth album, &quot;B.A.C.K&quot;, which was released in 1999 by Die Hard Music. Then in 2000, Artillery decided to split up again.

In 2007, the band released a limited edition 4-CD boxset entitled &quot;Through the Years&quot;, which contains the band&#x27;s four studio albums and all their demo material.

On 6 November 2007, Michael Stützer confirmed on the official Artillery website that they were once again active. However, longtime Artillery singer Flemming Rönsdorf did not participate. On 27 November the same year, it was confirmed that singer Søren Adamsen would be the new frontman. This line-up recorded two albums – namely, &quot;When Death Comes&quot; from 2009 and &quot;My Blood&quot; from 2011.

On 12 April 2012, drummer Carsten Nielsen announced that he was leaving the band after a US/South America tour in May that year. He was replaced by Josua Madsen. On 26 September the same year, it was also announced that Søren Adamsen had left the band and was replaced by Michael Bastholm Dahl. The new Artillery lineup was working on a new album entitled &quot;Legions&quot;, which they began recording in February 2013, and which was released on Metal Blade on 26 November 2013. On 7 October 2013, Metal Blade released the first video single from &quot;Legions&quot; in the form of the track &quot;Chill My Bones (Burn My Flesh)&quot;. &quot;Legions&quot; was followed three years later by &quot;Penalty by Perception&quot;.

On 15 July 2018, Artillery announced on their Facebook page they were making a new album. This album, titled &quot;The Face of Fear&quot;, was released on 16 November 2018.

Guitarist and founding member Morten Stützer died suddenly on 2 October 2019; the surviving members of Artillery immediately announced that they would continue performing in his honor and he was replaced by Kræn Meier. The band released their first song in two years &quot;The Last Journey&quot;, digitally and on vinyl, on 16 October 2020. The song serves as a tribute dedication to Morten Stützer and includes vocals from two of Artillery&#x27;s former singers Flemming Rønsdorf and Søren Adamsen.

On 7 May 2021 Artillery released their tenth album, simply called &quot;X&quot;, produced in the Medley Studios in Copenhagen. The band toured worldwide in support of the album.

As of June 2022, Artillery has begun working on new music for their eleventh studio album.

On 8 March 2023, Artillery drummer Josua Madsen died after getting hit by a bus.

<doc id="689385" wikidata="Q232899" url="?curid=689385" title="Mary Dyer">
<text>Mary Dyer (born Marie Barrett; c. 1611 – 1 June 1660) was an English and colonial American Puritan-turned-Quaker who was hanged in Boston, Massachusetts Bay Colony, for repeatedly defying a Puritan law banning Quakers from the colony due to their theological expansion of the Puritan concept of a church of individuals regenerated by the Holy Spirit to the idea of the indwelling of the Spirit or the &quot;Light of Christ&quot;, which was deemed dangerous heresy. She is one of the four executed Quakers known as the Boston martyrs.

Dyer&#x27;s birthplace has not been established, but it is known that she was married in London in 1633 to William Dyer, a member of the Fishmongers&#x27; Company but a milliner by profession. Mary and William were Puritans who were interested in reforming the Anglican Church from within, without separating from it. As the King of England, Charles I increased pressure on the Puritans; they left England by the thousands to go to New England in the early 1630s. Mary and William arrived in Boston by 1635, joining the Boston Church in December of that year. 

Like most members of Boston&#x27;s church, they soon became involved in the Antinomian Controversy, a theological crisis lasting from 1636 to 1638. Mary and William were strong advocates of Anne Hutchinson and John Wheelwright in the controversy, and as a result, Mary&#x27;s husband was disenfranchised and disarmed for supporting these &quot;heretics&quot; and also for harboring his own heretical views. Subsequently, they left Massachusetts with many others to establish a new colony on Aquidneck Island (later Rhode Island) in Narraganset Bay.

Before leaving Boston, Mary had given birth to a severely deformed infant that was stillborn. Because of the religious superstitions of the time regarding such a birth, the baby was buried secretly. When the Massachusetts authorities learned of this birth, the ordeal became public, and in the minds of the colony&#x27;s ministers and magistrates, the monstrous birth was clearly a result of Mary&#x27;s &quot;monstrous&quot; religious opinions. More than a decade later, in late 1651, Mary Dyer boarded a ship for England, and stayed there for over five years, during which time she converted to Quakerism. Because Quakers were considered among the most dangerous of heretics by the Puritans, Massachusetts enacted several laws against them. When Dyer returned to Boston from England, she was immediately imprisoned and then banished. Defying her order of banishment, she was again banished, this time upon pain of death. Deciding that she would die as a martyr if the anti-Quaker laws were not repealed, Dyer once again returned to Boston and was sent to the gallows in 1659, having the rope around her neck when a reprieve was announced. She returned once more to Boston the following year and was then hangedthe third of four Quaker martyrs.

== Early life ==
Details of the life of Mary Dyer in England are scarce; only her marriage record and a short probate record for her brother have been found. In both of these English records, her name is given as Marie Barret. A belief that Dyer was the daughter of Lady Arbella Stuart and Sir William Seymour was debunked by genealogist G. Andrews Moriarty in 1950. However, Moriarty correctly predicted that despite his work the legend would persist, and in 1994 the tradition was included as being plausible in a published biography of Dyer.

While the parents of Mary Dyer have not been identified, Johan Winsser made a significant discovery concerning a brother of Dyer, which he published in 2004. On 18 January 1634 ,&lt;ref name=&quot;OS/NS&quot;&gt;England, and Great Britain from 1708, used the Julian calendar until 1752. The new year in that calendar fell on Lady Day, 25 March, so dates between 1 January and 25 March are written with both years to avoid confusion.&lt;/ref&gt; a probate administration was recorded in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury for a William Barret. The instrument granted administration of Barret&#x27;s estate &quot;jointly to William Dyer of St Martin-in-the-Fields, fishmonger, and his wife Marie Dyer, otherwise Barret.&quot; The fact that the estate of a brother of Mary Dyer would be left in the hands of Mary and her husband strongly suggests that William (and therefore Mary) had no living parents and no living brothers at the time, and also suggests that Mary was either William Barrett&#x27;s only living sister, or his oldest living sister. The other facts that could be drawn from the instrument are that William Barrett was unmarried and that he died somewhere &quot;beyond the seas&quot; from England.

That Mary was well educated is apparent from the two surviving letters that she wrote. Quaker chronicler George Bishop described her as a &quot;Comely Grave Woman, and of a goodly Personage ... and one of a good Report, having a husband of an Estate, fearing the Lord, and a Mother of Children.&quot; The Dutch writer Gerard Croese wrote that she was reputed to be a &quot;person of no mean extract and parentage, of an estate pretty plentiful, of a comely stature and countenance, of a piercing knowledge in many things, of a wonderful sweet and pleasant discourse, so fit for great affairs&quot;. Massachusetts Governor John Winthrop described her as being &quot;a very proper and fair woman ... of a very proud spirit, and much addicted to revelations&quot;.

Mary was married to William Dyer, a fishmonger and milliner, on 27 October 1633 at the parish church of St Martin-in-the-Fields, in Westminster, Middlesex, now a part of Central London. Mary&#x27;s husband was baptized in Lincolnshire, England. Settlers from Lincolnshire contributed a disproportionately large percentage of members of the Boston Church in New England, and a disproportionately large part of the leadership during the founding of Rhode Island.

Mary and William Dyer were Puritans, as evidenced by their acceptance into the membership of the Boston church in New England. The Puritans wanted to purify the Church of England from what they considered to be vestiges of Roman Catholicism that were retained after the English Reformation. The conformists in England accepted the Elizabethan via media and English monarch as the titular supreme governor of the state church. The Puritans, as non-conformists, wanted to observe a much simpler form of worship. Some of the non-conformists, such as the Pilgrims, wanted to separate completely from the Church of England. Most Puritans wished to reform the church from within. As exploration of the North American continent was then leading to settlement, many Puritans opted to avoid state sanctions by emigrating to New England to practice their form of religion.

== Massachusetts ==
In 1635, Mary and William Dyer sailed from England to New England. Mary was likely pregnant or gave birth during the voyage because on 20 December 1635 their son Samuel was baptized at the Boston church, exactly one week after the Dyers joined the church. William Dyer became a freeman of Boston on 3 March the following year.

=== Antinomian Controversy ===
During the earliest days of the Boston Church, before the arrival of Mary and William Dyer, there was a single minister, the Reverend John Wilson. In 1633, one of England&#x27;s most noted Puritan clergymen, John Cotton, arrived in Boston and quickly became the second minister (called &quot;teacher&quot;) in Boston&#x27;s church. In time, the Boston parishioners could sense a theological difference between Wilson and Cotton. Anne Hutchinson, a theologically astute midwife who had the ear of many of the colony&#x27;s women, became outspoken in support of Cotton, and condemned the theology of Wilson and most of the other ministers in the colony during gatherings, or conventicles, held at her house.

Differing religious opinions within the colony eventually became public debates and erupted into what has traditionally been called the Antinomian Controversy. Many members of Boston&#x27;s church found Wilson&#x27;s emphasis on morality, and his doctrine of &quot;evidencing justification by sanctification&quot; (a covenant of works) to be disagreeable. Hutchinson told her followers that Wilson lacked &quot;the seal of the Spirit&quot;. Wilson&#x27;s theological views conformed with those of all of the other ministers in the colony except for Cotton, who instead stressed &quot;the inevitability of God&#x27;s will&quot; (a covenant of grace). The Boston parishioners had become accustomed to Cotton&#x27;s doctrines, and some of them began disrupting Wilson&#x27;s sermons, even finding excuses to leave when Wilson got up to preach or pray.

Both William and Mary Dyer sided strongly with Hutchinson and the free-grace advocates, and it is highly likely that Mary attended the periodic theological gatherings at the Hutchinson&#x27;s home. In May 1636, the Bostonians received a new ally when the Reverend John Wheelwright arrived from England, and immediately aligned himself with Cotton, Hutchinson and the other free-grace supporters. Yet another boost for those advocating the free-grace theology came during the same month, when the young aristocrat Henry Vane was elected as the governor of the colony. Vane was a strong supporter of Hutchinson, but also had his own unorthodox ideas about theology that were considered radical.

By late 1636, the theological schism had become great enough that the General Court called for a day of fasting to help ease the colony&#x27;s difficulties. The appointed fasting day, in January, included church services, and Cotton preached during the morning, but with Wilson away in England, John Wheelwright was invited to preach during the afternoon. Though his sermon may have seemed benign to the average listener in the congregation, most of the colony&#x27;s ministers found Wheelwright&#x27;s words to be objectionable. Instead of bringing peace, the sermon fanned the flames of controversy, and in Winthrop&#x27;s words, Wheelwright &quot;inveighed against all that walked in a covenant of works, ... and called them antichrists, and stirred up the people against them with much bitterness and vehemency.&quot; In contrast, the followers of Hutchinson were encouraged by the sermon, and intensified their crusade against the &quot;legalists&quot; among the clergy. During church services and lectures, they publicly questioned the ministers about their doctrines which disagreed with their own beliefs.

When the General Court next met on 9 March, Wheelwright was called upon to answer for his sermon. He was judged guilty of &quot;contempt &amp; sedition&quot; for having &quot;purposely set himself to kindle and increase&quot; bitterness within the colony. The vote did not pass without a fight, however, and Wheelwright&#x27;s friends protested formally. Most members of the Boston church, favoring Wheelwright in the conflict, drafted a petition justifying Wheelwright&#x27;s sermon, and 60 people signed this remonstrance protesting the conviction. William Dyer was among those who signed the petition which accused the General Court of condemning the truth of Christ. Dyer&#x27;s signature in support of Wheelwright soon proved to be fateful to the Dyer family.

Anne Hutchinson faced trial in early November 1637 for &quot;traducing&quot; (slandering) the ministers, and was sentenced to banishment on her second day in court. Within a week of her sentencing, many supporters of hers, including William Dyer, were called into court and were disenfranchised. Fearing an armed insurrection, the constables were then sent from door to door throughout the colony&#x27;s towns to disarm those who signed the Wheelwright petition. Within ten days these individuals were ordered to deliver &quot;all such guns, pistols, swords, powder, shot, &amp; match as they shall be owners of, or have in their custody, upon paine of ten pound[s] for every default&quot;. A great number of those who signed the petition, faced with losing their protection and in some cases livelihood, recanted under the pressure, and &quot;acknowledged their error&quot; in signing the petition. Those who refused to recant suffered hardships and many decided to leave the colony. Being both disenfranchised and disarmed, William Dyer was among those who could no longer justify remaining in Massachusetts.

=== &quot;Monstrous birth&quot; ===
While William Dyer appeared in the Boston records on several occasions, Mary Dyer had not caught the attention of the Massachusetts authorities until March 1638 as the Antinomian controversy came to an end. Following Hutchinson&#x27;s civil trial, she was kept as a prisoner in the home of a brother of one of the colony&#x27;s ministers. Though she had been banished from the colony, this did not mean she was removed as a member of the Boston church. In March 1638 she was forced to face a church trial to get at the root of her heresies and determine if her relationship with the Puritan church would continue. While William Dyer was likely with other men finding a new home away from Massachusetts, Mary Dyer was still in Boston and in attendance at this church trial. At the conclusion of the trial, Hutchinson was excommunicated, and as she was leaving the Boston Church, Mary stood and walked hand in hand with her out of the building. As the two women were leaving the church, a member of the congregation asked another person about the identity of the woman leaving the church with Hutchinson. A reply was made that it was the woman who had had the &quot;monstrous birth&quot;. Governor Winthrop soon became aware of this verbal exchange and began conducting an investigation.

Dyer had given birth five months earlier, on 11 October 1637, to a stillborn baby with dysmorphic features. Winthrop wrote that while many women had gathered for the occasion, that &quot;none were left at the time of the birth but the midwife and two others, whereof one fell asleep&quot;. Actually, two women presents were midwives—Anne Hutchinson and Jane Hawkins, but the third woman was never identified. Hutchinson fully understood the serious theological implications of such a birth and immediately sought the counsel of the Reverend John Cotton. Thinking about how he would react if this were his child, Cotton instructed Hutchinson to conceal the circumstances of the birth. The infant was then buried secretly.

Once Winthrop had learned of the so-called &quot;monstrous birth&quot;, he confronted Jane Hawkins and armed with new information then confronted Cotton. As the news spread among the colony&#x27;s leaders, it was determined that the infant would be exhumed and examined. According to Winthrop, a group of &quot;above a hundred persons&quot; including Winthrop, Cotton, Wilson, and the Reverend Thomas Weld &quot;went to the place of bury all &amp; commanded to dig it up to [behold] it, &amp; they saw it, a most hideous creature, a woman, a fish, a bird, &amp; a beast all woven together&quot;. In his journal, Winthrop provided a more complete description as follows:

While some of the descriptions may have been accurate, many puritanical embellishments were added to better fit the moral story being portrayed by the authorities. The modern medical condition that best fits the description of the infant is anencephaly, meaning partial or complete absence of a brain. This episode was just the beginning of the attention emanating from Dyer&#x27;s personal tragedy. The religion of the Puritans demanded a close look at all aspects of one&#x27;s life for signs of God&#x27;s approval or disapproval. Even becoming a member of the Puritan church in New England required a public confession of faith, and any behavior that was viewed by the clergy as being unorthodox required a theological examination by the church, followed by a public confession and repentance by the offender. Such microscopic inspection caused even private matters to become looked at publicly for the purpose of instruction, and Dyer&#x27;s tragedy was widely examined for signs of God&#x27;s judgment. This led to a highly subjective form of justice, an example of which was the 1656 hanging of Ann Hibbins whose offense was simply being resented by her neighbor. In Winthrop&#x27;s eyes, Dyer&#x27;s case was unequivocal, and he was convinced that her &quot;monstrous birth&quot; was a clear signal of God&#x27;s displeasure with the antinomian heretics. Winthrop felt that it was quite providential that the discovery of the &quot;monstrous birth&quot; occurred exactly when Anne Hutchinson was excommunicated from the local body of believers, and exactly one week before Dyer&#x27;s husband was questioned in the Boston church for his heretic opinions.

To further fuel Winthrop&#x27;s beliefs, Anne Hutchinson suffered from a miscarriage later in the same year when she aborted a strange mass of tissue that appeared like a handful of transparent grapes (a rare condition, mostly in woman over 45, called a hydatidiform mole). Winthrop was convinced of divine influence in these events, and made sure that every leader in New England received his own account of the &quot;monster&quot; birth, and he even sent a deposition to England. Soon, the story took on a life of its own, and in 1642 it was printed in London under the title &quot;Newes from New-England of a Most Strange and Prodigious Birth, brought to Boston in New-England&quot;. Though the author of this work was not named, it may have been the New England minister Thomas Weld who was in England at the time to support New England&#x27;s ecclesiastical independence. In 1644 Weld, who was still in England, took Winthrop&#x27;s account of the Antinomian Controversy, and published it under one title, and then added a preface of his own and republished it under the title &quot;A Short story of the Rise, reign and ruine of the Antinomians, Familists &amp; Libertines&quot;, usually just called &quot;Short Story&quot;. In 1648 Samuel Rutherford, a Scottish Presbyterian, included Winthrop&#x27;s account of the monster in his anti-sectarian treatise &quot;A Survey of the Spirituall Antichrist, Opening the Secrets of Familisme and Antinomianisme&quot;. Even the English writer, Samuel Danforth, included the birth in his 1648 &quot;Almanack&quot; as a &quot;memorable occurrence&quot; from 1637. The only minister who wrote without sensationalism about Dyer&#x27;s deformed infant was the Reverend John Wheelwright, Anne Hutchinson&#x27;s ally during the Antinomian Controversy. In his 1645 response to Winthrop&#x27;s &quot;Short Story&quot;, entitled , he wrote that Dyer&#x27;s and Hutchinson&#x27;s monsters described by Winthrop were nothing but &quot;a monstrous conception of his [Winthrop&#x27;s] brain, a spurious issue of his intellect&quot;.

Twenty years after the tragic birth, when Mary Dyer returned to the public spotlight for her Quaker evangelism, she continued to be remembered for the birth of her dysmorphic child, this time in the diary of John Hull. Also, in 1660, an exchange of letters took place between England and New England when the two eminent English clergymen, Richard Baxter and Thomas Brooks, sought information about the &quot;monstrous birth&quot; from 1637. A New Englander, whose identity was not included, sent back information about the event to the English divines. The New Englander, who used Winthrop&#x27;s original description of the &quot;monster&quot; almost verbatim, has subsequently been identified as yet another well-known clergyman, John Eliot who preached at the church in Roxbury, not far from Boston.

The most outrageous accounting of Dyer&#x27;s infant occurred in 1667 when a memorandum of the Englishman Sir Joseph Williamson quoted a Major Scott about the event. Scott was a country lawyer with a notorious reputation, and his detractors included the famous diarist Samuel Pepys. Scott&#x27;s outlandish assertion was that the young Massachusetts governor, Henry Vane, fathered the &quot;monstrous births&quot; of both Mary Dyer and Anne Hutchinson; that he &quot;debauched both, and both were delivered of monsters&quot;. After this, the accounts became less frequent, and the last historical account of Dyer&#x27;s &quot;monstrous birth&quot; was in 1702 when the New England minister Cotton Mather mentioned it in passing in his .

== Rhode Island ==
Several of those affected by the events of the Antinomian controversy went north with John Wheelwright in November 1637 to found the town of Exeter in what would become New Hampshire. A larger group, uncertain where to go, contacted Roger Williams, who suggested they purchase land from the natives along the Narraganset Bay, near his settlement in Providence. On 7 March 1638, just as Anne Hutchinson&#x27;s church trial was getting underway, a group of men gathered at the home of William Coddington and drafted a compact for a new government. This group included several of the strongest supporters of Hutchinson who had either been disenfranchised, disarmed, excommunicated, or banished, including William Dyer. Altogether, 23 individuals signed the instrument which was intended to form a &quot;Bodie Politick&quot; based on Christian principles, and Coddington was chosen as the leader of the group. Following through with Roger Williams&#x27; proposed land purchase, these exiles established their colony on Aquidneck Island (later named Rhode Island), naming the settlement Pocasset.

William and Mary Dyer joined William and Anne Hutchinson and many others in building the new settlement on Aquidneck Island. Within a year of the founding of this settlement, however, there was dissension among the leaders, and the Dyers joined Coddington, with several other inhabitants, in moving to the south end of the island, establishing the town of Newport. The Hutchinsons remained in Pocasset, whose inhabitants renamed the town Portsmouth, and William Hutchinson became its chief magistrate. William Dyer immediately became the recording secretary of Newport, and he and three others were tasked in June 1639 to proportion the new lands. In 1640 the two towns of Portsmouth and Newport united, and Coddington was elected governor, while Dyer was chosen as Secretary, and held this position from 1640 to 1647. Roger Williams, who envisioned a union of all four settlements on the Narragansett Bay (Providence, Warwick, Portsmouth, and Newport), wanted royal recognition of these settlements for their protection, and went to England where he obtained a patent bringing the four towns under one government. Coddington was opposed to the Williams patent and managed to resist union with Providence and Warwick until 1647 when representatives of the four towns ultimately met and united under the patent. With all four of the Narragansett settlements now under one government, William Dyer was elected the General Recorder for the entire colony in 1648.

Coddington continued to be unhappy with the consolidated government, and wanted colonial independence for the two island towns. He sailed to England to present his case, and in April 1651, the Council of State of England gave him the commission he sought, making him governor-for-life of the island. Criticism of Coddington arose as soon as he returned with his commission. Three men were then directed to go to England to get Coddington&#x27;s commission revoked: Roger Williams, representing the mainland towns, and John Clarke and William Dyer representing the two island towns. In November 1651 the three men left for England, where Dyer would meet his wife. Mary Dyer had sailed to England before the three men departed, as Coddington wrote in a letter to Winthrop that Mr. Dyer &quot;sent his wife over in the first ship with Mr. Travice, and is now gone himself for England&quot;. It remains a mystery as to why Mary Dyer would leave six children behind, one an infant, to travel abroad. Biographer Ruth Plimpton hinted that Mary had some royal connection, and suggested that the news of the execution of King Charles I compelled her to go. However, no record has been found to satisfactorily explain this mystery.

Because of recent hostilities between the English and the Dutch, the three men, once in England, did not meet with the Council of State on New England until April 1652. After the men explained their case, Coddington&#x27;s commission for the island government was revoked in October 1652. William Dyer was the messenger who returned to Rhode Island the following February, bringing the news of the return of the colony to the Williams Patent of 1643. Mary, however, would remain in England for the next four years.

== Quaker conversion ==
=== England ===

Mary Dyer&#x27;s time in England lasted for over five years, and during her stay she had become deeply interested in Quakerism. Formally known as the Society of Friends, the Quakers do not practise water baptism or the Lord&#x27;s Supper, nor do they believe in an ordained ministry. Both women and men can preach and exercise spiritual authority. In addition to denouncing the clergy, and refusing to support the established church by paying tithes, Quakers emphasize liberty of conscience and demand the separation of church and state. Their worship is based in silence, with spontaneous Spirit-inspired preaching or prayer by any participant. They reject various customs that emphasised class distinctions (such as men bowing or doffing their hats to social superiors); they do not take oaths, and they do not fight in wars. The Puritans in Massachusetts viewed Quakers as being among the most reprehensible of heretics, and they enacted several laws against them.

It is commonly asserted that while in England, Dyer became a Quaker and received a gift in the ministry. Details are provided by Plimpton, but these are fabrications completely without documentation. Altogether, no contemporary record has been found that addresses Dyer&#x27;s time in England. Moreover, when Dyer and Anne Burden arrived in Barbados on their return to New England, the Quaker Missionary Henry Fell described Dyer to Margaret Fell, while not doing the same for Burden, whose Quaker ministry in England is documented. Margaret Fell was the administrative heart of early Quakerism, raising funds for missionary efforts and receiving and forwarding voluminous correspondence. That Fell had to describe Dyer to the woman who knew the most about Quaker missions and ministry suggests that Dyer was not well known among Quakers prior to leaving England. It is likely that Dyer came to her Quaker beliefs only late in her stay in England and that she did not exercise her ministry until her return to New England.

=== Quakers in Massachusetts ===
Of all the New England colonies, Massachusetts was the most active in persecuting the Quakers, but the Plymouth, Connecticut and New Haven colonies also shared in their persecution. When the first Quakers arrived in Boston in 1656 there were no laws yet enacted against them, but this quickly changed, and punishments were meted out with or without the law. It was primarily the ministers and the magistrates who opposed the Quakers and their evangelistic efforts. A particularly vehement persecutor, the Reverend John Norton of the Boston church, clamored for the law of banishment upon pain of death. He is the one who later wrote the vindication to England, justifying the execution of the first two Quakers in 1659.

The punishments doled out to the Quakers intensified as their perceived threat to the Puritan religious order increased. Dyer&#x27;s Newport neighbor, Herodias Gardiner who had made a perilous journey through a 60-mile wilderness to get to Weymouth in the Massachusetts colony was punished by being whipped ten times. She had made the arduous trek with another woman and with her &quot;Babe sucking at her Breast&quot; to give her Quaker testimony to friends in Weymouth. Similarly, Katherine Marbury Scott, the wife of Richard Scott, and a younger sister of Anne Hutchinson, had received ten lashes for petitioning for the release of future son-in-law, Christopher Holder, who was imprisoned. This was the setting into which Mary Dyer stepped, upon her return from England.

=== Dyer&#x27;s return to New England ===
In early 1657 Dyer returned to New England with the widow Ann Burden, who came to Boston to settle the estate of her late husband. Dyer was immediately recognized as a Quaker and imprisoned. Dyer&#x27;s husband had to come to Boston to get her out of jail, and he was bound and sworn not to allow her to lodge in any Massachusetts town, or to speak to any person while traversing the colony to return home. Dyer nevertheless continued to travel in New England to preach her Quaker message, and in early 1658 was arrested in the New Haven Colony, and then expelled for preaching her &quot;inner light&quot; belief, and the notion that women and men stood on equal ground in church worship and organization. In addition to sharing her Quaker message, she had come to New Haven with two others to visit Humphrey Norton who had been imprisoned for three weeks. Anti-Quaker laws had been enacted there, and after Dyer was arrested, she was &quot;set on a horse&quot;, and forced to leave.

In June 1658 two Quaker activists, Christopher Holder and John Copeland came to Boston. They had already been evicted from other parts of the colony, and were exasperating the magistrates. Being joined by John Rous from Barbadoes, the three men were sentenced to having their right ears cut off, and the sentence was carried out in July. As biographer Plimpton wrote, the men &quot;were so stalwart while their ears were removed&quot; that additional punishments in the form of whippings were carried out for the next nine weeks. Word of this cruelty reached Dyer while she was visiting Richard and Katherine Scott in Providence. Richard and Katherine Scott were considered to be the first Quakers in Providence. The Scotts had two daughters, Mary, the older, who was engaged to Christopher Holder, and Patience, the younger, aged 11. Mrs. Scott and her two daughters, along with Mary Dyer and her friend Hope Clifton, were all compelled to go to Boston to visit with Holder and the other men in jail. The four women and child were all imprisoned. Three other people who had also come to visit Holder and were then imprisoned were Nicholas Davis from Plymouth, the London merchant William Robinson and a Yorkshire farmer named Marmaduke Stephenson, the latter two on a Quaker mission from England.

The Quaker situation was becoming highly problematical for the magistrates. Their response to the increasing presence of these people was to enact tougher laws, and on 19 October 1658, a new law was passed in the Massachusetts colony that introduced capital punishment. Quakers would be banished from the colony upon pain of death, meaning they would be hanged if they defied the law. Dyer, Davis, Robinson, and Stephenson were then brought to court, and then sentenced to &quot;banishment upon pain of death&quot; under the new law. Davis returned to Plymouth, Dyer went home to Newport, but Robinson and Stephenson remained in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, spending time in Salem.

In June 1659 Robinson and Stephenson were once again apprehended and brought back to the Boston jail. When Dyer heard of these arrests, she once again left her home in Newport, and returned to Boston to support her Quaker brethren, ignoring her order of banishment, and once again being incarcerated. Her husband had already come to Boston two years earlier to retrieve her from the authorities, signing an oath that she would not return. He would not come back to Boston again, but on 30 August 1659 he wrote a long and impassioned letter to the magistrates, questioning the legality of the actions taken by the Massachusetts authorities.

On 19 October Dyer, Robinson and Stephenson were brought before Governor Endicott, where they explained their mission for the Lord. The next day, the same group was brought before the governor, who directed the prison keeper to remove the men&#x27;s hats. He then addressed the group, &quot;We have made many laws and endeavored in several ways to keep you from among us, but neither whipping nor imprisonment, nor cutting off ears, nor banishment upon pain of death will keep you from among us. We desire not your death.&quot; Having met his obligation to present the position of the colony&#x27;s authorities, he then pronounced, &quot;Hearken now to your sentence of death.&quot; William Robinson then wanted to read a prepared statement about being called by the Lord to Boston, but the governor would not allow it to be read, and Robinson was sent back to prison. Marmaduke Stephenson, being less vociferous than Robinson, was allowed to speak, and though initially declining, he ultimately spoke his mind, and then was also sent back to jail.

When Dyer was brought forth, the governor pronounced her sentence, &quot;Mary Dyer, you shall go from hence to the place from whence you came, and from thence to the place of execution, and there be hanged till you be dead.&quot; She replied, &quot;The will of the Lord be done.&quot; When Endicott directed the marshall to take her away, she said, &quot;Yea, and joyfully I go.&quot;

== First Quaker executions ==
The date set for the executions of the three Quaker evangelists, William Robinson, Marmaduke Stephenson and Mary Dyer, was 27 October 1659. Captain James Oliver of the Boston military company was directed to provide a force of armed soldiers to escort the prisoners to the place of execution. Dyer walked hand-in-hand with the two men, and between them. When she was publicly asked about this inappropriate closeness, she responded instead to her sense of the event: &quot;It is an hour of the greatest joy I can enjoy in this world. No eye can see, no ear can hear, no tongue can speak, no heart can understand the sweet incomes and refreshings of the spirit of the Lord which now I enjoy.&quot; The prisoners attempted to speak to the gathered crowd as they proceeded to the gallows, but their voices were drowned out by constant drum beats.

The place of execution was not the Boston Common, as expressed by many writers over the years, but instead about a mile south of there on Boston Neck, near the current intersection of West Dedham Street and Washington Street. Boston Neck was at one time a narrow spit of land providing the only land access to the Shawmut Peninsula where Boston is located. Over time, the water on both sides of the isthmus was filled in, so that the narrow neck no longer exists. A possible reason for the confusion may be because the land immediately south of Boston Neck was not privately owned and considered &quot;common lands&quot;, leading some writers to misinterpret this as being the Boston Common.

William Robinson was the first of the three to mount the gallows ladder, and from there made a statement to the crowd, then died when the ladder was removed. Marmaduke Stephenson was the next to hang, and then it was Dyer&#x27;s turn after she witnessed the execution of her two friends. Dyer&#x27;s arms and legs were bound and her face was covered with a handkerchief provided by Reverend John Wilson who had been one of her pastors in the Boston church many years earlier. She stood calmly on the ladder, prepared for her death, but as she waited, an order of a reprieve was announced. A petition from her son, William, had given the authorities an excuse to avoid her execution. It had been a pre-arranged scheme, in an attempt to unnerve and dissuade Dyer from her mission. This was made clear from the wording of the reprieve, though Dyer&#x27;s only expectation was to die as a martyr.

The day after Dyer was pulled from the gallows she wrote a letter to the General Court, refusing to accept the provision of the reprieve. In this letter she wrote, &quot;My life is not accepted, neither availeth me, in comparison with the lives and liberty of the Truth and Servants of the living God for which in the Bowels of Love and Meekness I sought you; yet nevertheless with wicked Hands have you put two of them to Death, which makes me to feel that the Mercies of the Wicked is cruelty; I rather chuse to Dye than to live, as from you, as Guilty of their Innocent Blood.&quot;

The courage of the martyrs led to a popular sentiment against the authorities who now felt it necessary to draft a vindication of their actions. The wording of this petition suggested that the reprieve of Mary Dyer should soften the reality of the martyrdom of the two men. The Massachusetts General Court sent this document to the newly restored king in England, and in answer to it, the Quaker historian, Edward Burrough wrote a short book in 1661. In this book, Burrough refuted the claims of Massachusetts, point by point, provided a list of the atrocities committed against Quakers, and also provided a narrative of the three Quaker executions that had transpired prior to the book&#x27;s publication.

After going home to Rhode Island, Dyer spent most of the following winter on Shelter Island, sitting between the north and south forks of Long Island. Though sheltered from storms, the island&#x27;s owner, Nathaniel Sylvester, used it as a refuge for Quakers seeking shelter from the Puritans, thus providing its name. Here Dyer was able to commune with her fellow Quakers, including her Newport neighbors, William Coddington and his wife Anne Brinley, who had recently converted. Dyer used her time here to mull over the vindication prepared by the Puritan authorities to send to England, concerning their actions against the Quakers. This document was an affront to Dyer, and she viewed it as merely a means to soften public outrage. She was determined to return to Boston to force the authorities to either change their laws or to hang a woman, and she left Shelter Island in April 1660 focused on this mission.

== Dyer&#x27;s martyrdom ==
Dyer returned to Boston on 21 May 1660 and ten days later she was once again brought before the governor. The exchange of words between Dyer and Governor Endicott was recorded as follows:

Following this exchange, the governor asked if she was a prophetess, and she answered that she spoke the words that the Lord spoke to her. When she began to speak again, the governor called, &quot;Away with her! Away with her!&quot; She was returned to jail. Though her husband had written a letter to Endicott requesting his wife&#x27;s freedom, another reprieve was not granted.

=== Execution ===
On 1 June 1660, at 9 A.M., Dyer once again departed the jail and was escorted to the gallows. Once she was on the ladder, under the elm tree, she was given the opportunity to save her life. Her response was, &quot;Nay, I cannot; for in obedience to the will of the Lord God I came, and in his will I abide faithful to the death.&quot; The military commander, Captain John Webb, recited the charges against her and said she &quot;was guilty of her own blood&quot;. Dyer&#x27;s response was:

Her former pastor, John Wilson, urged her to repent and to not be &quot;so deluded and carried away by the deceit of the devil&quot;. To this she answered, &quot;Nay, man, I am not now to repent.&quot; Asked if she would have the elders pray for her, she replied, &quot;I know never an Elder here.&quot; Another short exchange followed, and then, in the words of her biographer, Horatio Rogers, &quot;she was swung off, and the crown of martyrdom descended upon her head&quot;.

=== Burial ===
The Friends&#x27; records of Portsmouth, Rhode Island, contain the following entry: &quot;Mary Dyer the wife of William Dyer of Newport in Rhode Island: she was put to death at the Town of Boston with ye like cruil hand as the martyrs were in Queen Mary&#x27;s time, and there buried upon ye 31 day of ye 3d mo. 1660.&quot; In the calendar used at the time, May was the third month of the year, but the date in the record is incorrect by a day, as the actual date of death was 1 June. Also, this entry states that Mary was buried there in Boston where she was hanged, and biographer Rogers echoed this, but this is not likely. Johan Winsser presents evidence that Mary was buried on the Dyer family farm, located north of Newport where the Navy base is now situated in the current town of Middletown. The strongest evidence found is the 1839 journal entry given by Daniel Wheeler, who wrote, &quot;Before reaching Providence [coming from Newport], the site of the dwelling, and burying place of Mary Dyer was shown me.&quot; Winsser provides other items of evidence lending credence to this notion; it is unlikely that Dyer&#x27;s remains would have been left in Boston since she had a husband, many children, and friends living in Newport, Rhode Island.

=== Aftermath ===
In his &quot;History of Boston&quot;, Caleb Snow wrote that one of the officers attending the hanging, Edward Wanton, was so overcome by the execution that he became a Quaker convert. The Wantons later became one of the leading Quaker families in Rhode Island, and two of Wanton&#x27;s sons, William and John, and two of his grandsons, Gideon and Joseph Wanton, became governors of the Rhode Island Colony.

Humphrey Atherton, a prominent Massachusetts official and one of Dyer&#x27;s persecutors, wrote, &quot;Mary Dyer did hang as a flag for others to take example by.&quot; Atherton died on 16 September 1661 following a fall from a horse, and many Quakers viewed this as God&#x27;s wrath sent upon him for his harshness towards their sect.

A strong reaction from a contemporary woman and friend of Mary Dyer came from Anne Brinley Coddington, with whom Dyer spent her final winter on Shelter Island. Anne Coddington sent a scathing letter to the Massachusetts magistrates, singling out Governor Endicott&#x27;s role in the execution. In addition, her husband, William Coddington sent several letters to the Connecticut governor, John Winthrop, Jr., condemning the execution.

While news of Dyer&#x27;s hanging was quick to spread through the American colonies and England, there was no immediate response from London because of the political turbulence, resulting in the restoration of the king to power in 1660. One more Quaker was martyred at the hands of the Puritans, William Leddra of the Barbadoes, who was hanged in March 1661. A few months later, however, the English Quaker activist Edward Burrough was able to get an appointment with the king. In a document dated 9 September 1661 and addressed to Endicott and all other governors in New England, the king directed that executions and imprisonments of Quakers cease, and that any offending Quaker be sent to England for trial under the existing English law.

While the royal response put an end to executions, the Puritans continued to find ways to abuse the Quakers who came to Massachusetts. In 1661 they passed the &quot;Cart and Tail Law&quot;, having Quakers tied to carts, stripped to the waist, and dragged through various towns behind the cart, being whipped en route, until they were taken out of the colony. At about the time that Endicott died in 1665, a royal commission directed that all legal actions taken against Quakers would cease. Nevertheless, whippings and imprisonments continued into the 1670s, after which popular sentiment, coupled with the royal directives, finally put an end to the Quaker persecution.

== Modern view ==
According to literary scholar Anne Myles, the life of Mary Dyer &quot;functions as a powerful, almost allegorical example of a woman returning, over and over, to the same power-infused site of legal and discursive control&quot;. The only first-hand evidence available as to the thoughts and motives of Dyer lie in the letters that she wrote. But Myles sees her behavior as &quot;a richly legible text of female agency, affiliation, and dissent&quot;. Looking at Burrough&#x27;s account of the conversation between Dyer and Governor Endicott, Myles views the two most important dimensions as being agency and affiliation. The first is that Dyer&#x27;s actions &quot;can be read as staging a public drama of agency&quot;, a means for women, including female prophets, to act under the power and will of God. While Quaker women were allowed to preach, they were not being assertive when doing so because they were actually &quot;preaching against their own wills and minds&quot;.

Dyer possessed a &quot;vigorous intentionality&quot; in engaging with the magistrates and ministers, both in her speech and in her behavior. Even though those who chronicled her actions and life, such as Burrough and Rogers, looked at her as being submissive to the will of God, she was nevertheless the active participant in her fate, voluntarily choosing to become a martyr. She took full responsibility for her actions, while imploring the Puritan authorities to assume their moral responsibility for her death. This provides a distinguishing feature between Dyer and Anne Hutchinson, the latter of whom may not have fully comprehended the consequences of her behavior. While Dyer&#x27;s husband and those unsympathetic to her labelled her as having a &quot;madness&quot;, it is clear from her letters and her spoken words that her purpose and intentions were displayed with the utmost clarity of mind.

During her dialogues, while walking to the gallows, or standing on the ladder under the hanging tree, Dyer exchanged a series of &quot;yeas&quot; and &quot;nays&quot; with her detractors. With these affirmations and negations, she was refusing to allow others to construct her meaning. She refuted the image of her as a sinner in need of repentance, and contested the authority of the elders of the church. Just like Hutchinson&#x27;s befuddling of her accusers during her civil trial, Dyer did not allow her interrogators to feel assured in how they framed her meaning.

While agency is the first of two dimensions of Dyer&#x27;s story, the second is allegiance. Dyer became known in the public eye on the day when Anne Hutchinson was excommunicated, and Dyer took her hand while they walked out of the meeting house together. Dyer had a strong affiliation and allegiance to this older woman who shared the secret of her unfortunate birth. Likewise, two decades later she framed her acts as a means to stand by her friends and share in their fate. In the first of two letters of Dyer&#x27;s that have been preserved, she wrote to the General Court, &quot;if my Life were freely granted by you, it would not avail me, nor could I expect it of you, so long as I should daily hear or see the Sufferings of these People, my dear Brethren and Seed, with whom my Life is bound up, as I have done these two years&quot;. Traditional bonds for females were to spouses and children, yet in the Quaker community there were strong spiritual bonds that transcended gender boundaries. Thus the Puritan public found it very unusual that Dyer walked to the gallows hand-in-hand between two male friends, and she was asked if she was not ashamed of doing so. This spiritual closeness of the Quakers was very threatening to the Puritan mindset where allegiance was controlled by the male church members. The Quakers allowed their personal bonds to transgress not only gender lines but also the boundaries of age and class.

In her first letter to the General Court, Dyer used the themes of agency and allegiance in creating an analogy between her witnessing in Massachusetts with the Book of Esther. Esther, a Jew, was called upon to save her people after the evil Haman urged the king to enact a law to have all Jews put to death. It was Esther&#x27;s intercession with the king that saved her people, and the parallels are that Dyer is the beautiful Esther, with wicked Haman representing the Massachusetts authorities, and the Jews of the Bible being the Quakers of Dyer&#x27;s time. Ultimately, Dyer&#x27;s martyrdom did have the desired effect. Unlike the story of Anne Hutchinson, that was narrated for more than a century by only her enemies, the orthodox Puritans, Dyer&#x27;s story became the story of the Quakers, and it was quickly shared in England, and eventually made its way before King Charles II. The king ordered an end to the capital punishments, though the severe treatment continued for several more years.

According to Myles, Dyer&#x27;s life journey during her time in New England transformed her from &quot;a silenced object to a speaking subject; from an Antinomian monster to a Quaker martyr&quot;. The evidence from a personal standpoint and from the standpoint of all Quakers, suggests that Dyer&#x27;s ending was as much a spiritual triumph as it was a tragic injustice.

A statue was dedicated to Mary Dyer in June 1959 and is located outside the Massachusetts State House.

A bronze statue of Dyer by Quaker sculptor Sylvia Shaw Judson stands in front of the Massachusetts State House in Boston, and is featured on the Boston Women&#x27;s Heritage Trail; a copy stands in front of the Friends Center in central Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and another in front of Stout Meetinghouse at Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana.

In Portsmouth, Rhode Island, Mary Dyer and her friend Anne Hutchinson have been remembered at Founders Brook Park with the Anne Hutchinson/Mary Dyer Memorial Herb Garden, a medicinal botanical garden, set by a scenic waterfall with a historical marker for the early settlement of Portsmouth. The garden was created by artist and herbalist Michael Steven Ford, who is a descendant of both women. The memorial was a grass roots effort by a local Newport organization, the Anne Hutchinson Memorial Committee headed by Newport artist, Valerie Debrule. The organization, called Friends of Anne Hutchinson, meets annually at the memorial in Portsmouth, on the Sunday nearest to 20 July, the date of Anne&#x27;s baptism, to celebrate her life and the local colonial history of the women of Aquidneck Island.

Dyer was inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame in 1997 and into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2000.

== Published works ==
Three adult biographies of Mary Dyer have been published, the first being &quot;Mary Dyer of Rhode Island, the Quaker Martyr That Was Hanged on Boston Common, June 1, 1660&quot; by Horatio Rogers (1896); the second being &quot;Mary Dyer: Biography of a Rebel Quaker&quot; by Ruth Plimpton (1994); and the third, &quot;Mary and William Dyer: Quaker Light and Puritan Ambition in Early New England&quot; by Johan Winsser (2017). A biography for middle-school students, &quot;Mary Dyer, Friend of Freedom&quot; by John Briggs, was published in 2014. While Dyer published no works herself, she did write two letters which have been preserved, both of them focal to her martyrdom, and both of them published in her biographies.

A play titled &quot;Heretic,&quot; by Jeanmarie Simpson, about the life of Mary Dyer, was first published in 2016 under the title &quot;The Joy&quot;, by the Fellowship of Quakers in the Arts. She was also featured in &quot;Rachel Dyer&quot;, an 1828 novel by John Neal that connects her martyrdom with the Salem witch trials. The title character is Dyer&#x27;s fictional granddaughter, who is the last victim of the hysteria in 1692.

== Children and descendants ==
Mary Dyer had eight known children, six of whom grew to adulthood. Following her martyrdom, her husband remarried and had one more known child, and possibly others. Her oldest child, William, was baptized at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on 24 October 1634 and was buried there three days later. After sailing to New England, her second child, Samuel, was baptized at the Boston church on 20 December 1635 and married by 1663 to Anne Hutchinson, the daughter of Edward Hutchinson and the granddaughter of William and Anne Hutchinson. Her third child was the premature stillborn female, born 17 October 1637, discussed earlier. Henry, born roughly 1640, was the fourth child, and he married Elizabeth Sanford, the daughter of John Sanford, Jr., and the granddaughter of Governor John Sanford.

The fifth child was a second William, born about 1642, who married Mary, possibly a daughter of Richard Walker of Lynn, Massachusetts, but no evidence supports this. Child number six was a male and given the Biblical name Mahershallalhashbaz. He was married to Martha Pearce, the daughter of Richard Pearce. Mary was the seventh child, born roughly 1647, and married by about 1675 Henry Ward; they were living in Cecil County, Maryland, in January 1679. Mary Dyer&#x27;s youngest child was Charles, born roughly 1650, whose first wife was named Mary; there are unsupported claims that she was a daughter of John Lippett. Charles married second after 1690 Martha (Brownell) Wait, who survived him.

There is no evidence that Mary&#x27;s husband, William Dyer, ever became a Quaker. There was a lot of litigation concerning the estate of William Dyer, Sr; his widow, Katherine, took both the widow of his son Samuel and later his son Charles to court over the estate, likely feeling that more of his estate belonged to his children with her.

Notable descendants of Mary Dyer include Rhode Island Governors Elisha Dyer and Elisha Dyer, Jr., and U.S. Senator from Rhode Island, Jonathan Chace.

<text>Lennie Gallant, CM is a Canadian singer-songwriter and instrumentalist from Prince Edward Island. His music crosses into the folk rock and country music genres, while celebrating the musical heritage of his home province. He has been presented with many awards for his performances and songwriting.

==Early life==
Gallant was born in Rustico, Prince Edward Island.

His nephews Rowen and Caleb Gallant, the sons of his brother Mark, are also musicians associated with the folk band Ten Strings and a Goat Skin.

==Career==
Lennie Gallant began at an early age by playing guitar, harmonica and mandolin in local bands. Gallant has released fifteen albums (11 in English and 4 in French) of original songs which have won him a host of awards and nominations from the JUNOs, Les Prix Éloizes, and 19 East Coast Music Awards, including 2017 ECMA Entertainer of the Year. His double CD from his multimedia hit production, &quot;Searching For Abegweit&quot;, which ran for over 200 shows, also won him an ECMA. In 2019, his song &quot;Peter&#x27;s Dream&quot; was inducted into the Canadian Songwriter&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

His album, &quot;When We Get There&quot; was nominated for a 2007 Juno Award and went into space aboard Space Shuttle Endeavour in July 2009. Canadian astronaut Julie Payette chose the album for the astronaut crew on their 16-day mission. In a special ceremony, Payette presented Gallant with his CD, which orbited Earth with her on the International Space Station 248 times.

He performed at the Vancouver Winter Olympic Games, including a performance at BC Place during the medal ceremonies. He represented the East Coast of Canada at &quot;Canada Day in London&quot; in Trafalgar Square on 1 July 2011 in the largest Canada Day celebration outside Canada&#x27;s borders.

He is an international touring artist and his songs have been covered by many artists. He has shared the stage with several orchestras and with performers such as Jimmy Buffett and David Foster and his band. Lennie struck up a friendship with Jimmy and has two co-writes on Jimmy&#x27;s last album, and was invited to sing on it as a featured artist.

A number of musicians have recorded his songs internationally, including Jimmy Buffett, who recorded Lennie Gallant&#x27;s song &quot;Mademoiselle Voulez Vous Danser.&quot; Artists who have performed his songs include Tara MacLean, Matt Minglewood, Roy Bailey, Sabia, Priscilla Herdman, Delvina Bernard – Four The Moment, and Measha Brueggergosman. He and partner Patricia Richard also record and perform as the popular Francophone duo, Sirène et Matelot (sireneetmatelot.com).

His songs have also appeared in feature films: &quot;Canvas&quot; included &quot;Mademoiselle Voulez Vous Danser&quot;, recorded by Jimmy Buffett, The theme song for &quot;Conquest&quot;, a feature in &quot;Sigh and a Wish: Helen Creighton&#x27;s Maritimes&quot; and the sound track for &quot;The Bellinger&quot; are all Gallant&#x27;s compositions. His songs have also been used in television series, including &quot;Dawson’s Creek&quot; (&quot;Northern Lights&quot;) and &quot;Joan of Arcadia&quot; (&quot;Something Unspoken&quot;), and in various theatrical productions.

He also wrote the OXFAM Song, &quot;Land of the Maya&quot;, and Halifax&#x27;s 250th Birthday Theme Song &quot;History is Happening Now&quot;, which was then performed with a choir of 2000 voices on one of the two bridges spanning the harbour. He co-wrote, directed and produced the Pier 21 (Canada’s immigration gateway) National Theme Song and the theme song for Acadian World Conference/Congres Mondial Acadien (Acadie de nos coeur).

Gallant played an acting role in an episode of the feature film &quot;Emily of New Moon&quot;. He wrote the theme song and acted in &quot;The Trial of Minnie MacGee&quot; and acted in the short film, A Blessing From the Sea.

Lennie Gallant has been involved in numerous charity events, and he recently received the PEI Red Cross Humanitarian of the Year Award for his collaboration with and support of many worthwhile causes. His work with the Mikinduri Children of Hope (for impoverished children in Kenya) is particularly close to his heart, and has raised money through his concerts for this PEI based organization.

Lennie Gallant wrote and performed a song, &quot;On the Minnehaha&quot;, for Kirsten Neuschäfer, a South African sailor who won the 2022 Golden Globe Race. Neuschäfer spent a year in Prince Edward Islands (PEI) while refitting her boat in preparation of the race. Some of the islanders who took part in refitting of Neuschäfer&#x27;s boat Minnehaha, including shipwright Eddie Arsenault, appear in the music video. Gallant&#x27;s song was played upon Neuschäfer&#x27;s arrival in Les Sables D&#x27;olonne, the finish line of the race, as the leading skipper.

==Awards and accomplishments==

===Order of Canada===
He was inducted into the Order of Canada where it was said, &quot;Gallant has garnered much respect for his hard hitting songs chronicling the lives of people dealing with tremendous adversity and serious issues. Songs like &quot;Peter&#x27;s Dream,&quot; &quot;Island Clay,&quot; &quot;Man of Steel&quot; and &quot;The Hope for Next Year,&quot; articulate the feelings of many caught up in desperate situations beyond their control, and at the same time celebrate the beauty of lifestyle and landscape with their strong poetry and stirring narratives.&quot; – From the induction ceremony in Ottawa, Canada.

===Other awards===
Gallant has been presented with 19 East Coast Music Awards, three Juno Nominations, two Canadian Folk Music Awards, four Music PEI awards and a Prix Éloizes Award.

In 2022, he received The Queen’s Platinum Jubilee Medal for his valuable contribution to the province of Nova Scotia during his time spent there.

In 2015, he received a UPEI honorary degree.

In 2013, he received the PEI Red Cross Humanitarian of the Year Award.

===Television===
Gallant&#x27;s television appearances include CTV Morning Live, CBC, CTV Breakfast Television, East Coast Barenaked East Coast Music!, East Coast Music Awards National Broadcasts, The Vicki Gabereau Show, La Fête en Acadie, Brio, Good Morning Canada, Canada AM, @ The End, En Spectacle au Festival Acadien, Gala des prix Éloizes, Gala des prix Étoiles de l&#x27;ARCANB, Much More Music/Much Music/CMT, Tout simplement country, Pour l&#x27;amour du country, CTV Christmas Daddies, En direct de l&#x27;univers and La grande veillée.

<text>Sedang is an Austro-Asiatic language spoken in eastern Laos and Kon Tum Province in south central Vietnam. The Sedang language has the most speakers of any of the languages of the North Bahnaric language group, a group of languages known for their range of vowel phonations.

==Phonology==

===Consonants===
===Vowels===
Sedang itself has 24 pure vowels: 7 vowel qualities, all of which may be plain ([a]), nasalized ([ã]), and creaky ([a̰]) and three of which /i a o/ may be both nasal and creaky ([ã̰]). While it does not have the length distinctions of other North Bahnaric languages, it has more diphthongs, between 33 and 55 vowel sounds all together. (The above set yields 50.) Sedang is thus sometimes claimed to have the largest vowel inventory in the world. However, other Bahnaric languages have more vowel qualities (Bahnar, for example, has 9) in addition to phonemic vowel length so the language with the record depends closely on how the languages are described and distinct vowels are defined.

<doc id="689398" wikidata="Q5419358" url="?curid=689398" title="Excalibur (video game)">
<text>Excalibur is a resource management strategy video game for Atari 8-bit computers published in 1983. It was designed by Chris Crawford and developed with the help of Larry Summers and Valerie Atkinson. Like Crawford&#x27;s earlier &quot;Eastern Front (1941)&quot;, &quot;Excalibur&quot; was released through the Atari Program Exchange.

==Gameplay==
The object of the game is to unite all of Britain under the rule of King Arthur. The players can invade kingdoms, set tithes for their vassals, send plagues and pestilences (with the help of Merlin) and manage the loyalty of their own Round Table by rewarding their knights or, if they grow too disloyal, by banishing them.

==Reception==
&quot;Electronic Games&quot; stated that &quot;&quot;Excalibur&quot; is a grand effort&quot;. &quot;Antic&quot; stated that the game &quot;easily ranks as the finest programming achievement to date by Chris Crawford ... one of the richest gaming experiences ever&quot;. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in 1984 called &quot;Excalibur&quot; &quot;a magnificent piece of software&quot;. It praised the documentation and novella, and concluded by asking, &quot;When will Chris Crawford&#x27;s next game be published?&quot; In 1990, &quot;CGW&quot; gave the game four out of five stars, stating that &quot;even on an obsolete machine&quot; &quot;Excalibur&quot; was still worthwhile. In 1993, the magazine gave it three-plus stars out of five.

&quot;The Addison-Wesley Book of Atari Software 1984&quot; gave &quot;Excalibur&quot; an overall A rating and stated that &quot;those who persevere will find an ample reward in the game&#x27;s incredible depth&quot;. The book predicted, however, that it was &quot;destined to become a cult game ... appeal[ing] mainly to the seasoned wargamer or fantasy role-player&quot; because of the slow pace and difficulty.

Crawford in 1984 wrote &quot;My greatest regret, though, is that Excalibur has not won the attention that I think it deserves. This game is my magnum opus, much grander in scale than anything else I have done. It is a shame that so few people are even aware of its existence.&quot;

==Legacy==
In 1987, Crawford stated that &quot;Excalibur&quot; was one of the three games he was proud of, with &quot;Eastern Front&quot; and &quot;Balance of Power&quot;. In 2013, Crawford publicly released source code for several of his games, including &quot;Excalibur&quot;.

<doc id="689404" wikidata="Q739540" url="?curid=689404" title="Robert Paul Wolff">
<text>Robert Paul Wolff (December 27, 1933 – January 6, 2025) was an American political philosopher and professor emeritus at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Wolff wrote widely on topics in political philosophy, including Marxism, tolerance (against liberalism and in favor of anarchism), political justification, and democracy.

== Early life and career ==
Robert Wolff was born in New York City on December 27, 1933, to Walter Harold and Charlotte (Ornstein) Wolff. He graduated from Harvard University with a B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. in philosophy in 1953, 1954, and 1957 respectively.

Wolff was an instructor in philosophy and general education at Harvard University from 1958 to 1961, an assistant professor of philosophy at the University of Chicago from 1961 to 1964, associate professor and then professor of philosophy at Columbia University from 1964 to 1971, and then, at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, professor of philosophy from 1971 to 1992, professor of Afro-American studies from 1992 to 2008, and professor emeritus since 2008.

== Scholarship ==
After interest in normative political philosophy resurged in the Anglo-American world upon the publication of John Rawls&#x27;s &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot;, Wolff made pointed criticisms of it from a roughly Marxist perspective. In 1977, he published &quot;Understanding Rawls: A Critique and Reconstruction of A Theory of Justice,&quot; which takes aim at the extent to which Rawls&#x27;s theory is cued to existing practice, convention, and status quo social science. Insofar as &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot; forecloses critiques of capitalist social relations, private property and the market economy, Wolff concluded that Rawls&#x27;s project amounted to a form of apology for the &quot;status quo&quot;, since, according to Wolff, markets and capitalist social relations are founded on exploitation and injustice, and Rawls did not defend his theory against these charges.

In &quot;The Poverty of Liberalism&quot;, Wolff pointed out inconsistencies in 20th-century liberal and conservative doctrines, taking as his starting points John Stuart Mill&#x27;s &quot;On Liberty&quot; and &quot;Principles of Political Economy&quot;.

Wolff&#x27;s 1970 book &quot;In Defense of Anarchism&quot; is widely read, and the first two editions sold more than 200,000 copies. It argues that if we accept a robust conception of individual autonomy, then there can be no &quot;de jure&quot; legitimate state. Wolff was praised for this work, including, to his surprise, by many on the political right, such as right-wing libertarians and anarcho-capitalists.

Wolff extended his advocacy of radical participatory democracy to university governance in &quot;The Ideal of the University&quot;, in which he argues against rising marketization and external encroachment and that universities should be governed primarily by faculty and students.

Within his profession, Wolff was better known for his work on Kant, particularly his books &quot;Kant&#x27;s Theory of Mental Activity: A Commentary on the Transcendental Analytic of the Critique of Pure Reason&quot; and &quot;The Autonomy of Reason: A Commentary on Kant&#x27;s Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals&quot;. He was also a noted commentator on the works of Karl Marx. His works include &quot;Understanding Marx: A Reconstruction and Critique of Capital&quot; and &quot;Moneybags Must Be So Lucky: On the Structure of Capital&quot;, an analysis of Marx&#x27;s rhetorical and literary techniques in &quot;Das Kapital&quot;. His textbook &quot;About Philosophy&quot; is used widely in introductory college philosophy courses.

Wolff was also distinguished as a white man who transitioned from the philosophy department to the department of Afro-American studies of the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, as chronicled in his book &quot;Autobiography of an Ex-White Man: Learning a New Master Narrative for America&quot;.

In 1990, Wolff founded University Scholarships for South African Students, an organization devoted to promoting opportunities in higher education within South Africa for disadvantaged South African students. Since its creation, USSAS has assisted in providing funding and educational opportunities for thousands of students in South Africa.

== Personal life and death ==
Wolff was married to literary historian Cynthia Griffin Wolff from 1962 until their divorce in 1986. He had two children from this marriage, Patrick Gideon Wolff, an international chess grandmaster, and Tobias Barrington Wolff, a gay rights legal activist who is Jefferson Barnes Fordham Professor of Law at the University of Pennsylvania. Wolff&#x27;s second wife was his childhood sweetheart, Susan Gould. They lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

Wolff split his time between Chapel Hill and Paris, France. He maintained a blog, &quot;The Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, where he discussed philosophy and political issues and wrote an online autobiography in a series of posts. 

Wolff died on January 6, 2025, at the age of 91.

<text>Frederick Thomas Zugibe (; May 28, 1928 – September 6, 2013) was the chief medical examiner of Rockland County, New York from 1969 to 2002. Zugibe was known for his research and books on forensic medicine as well as his crucifixion and Shroud of Turin studies.

==Life==
Zugibe was born in Garnerville, New York on May 28, 1928. He graduated from Haverstraw High School in 1946 and obtained a Bachelor of Science from St. Francis College. Zugibe earned a Master of Science degree (Anatomy/Electron Microscopy) from Columbia University, and a PhD in Anatomy and Histochemistry from the University of Chicago. 

In 1968, Zugibe received a Doctor of Medicine degree (M.D.) from West Virginia University. He was a diplomate of the American Board of Pathology in anatomic pathology and forensic pathology, and a diplomate of the American Board of Family Practice. Zugibe was an adjunct Associate Professor of Pathology at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and a Fellow of the College of American Pathologists, a Fellow of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences, Forensic Pathology Section, and a member of the National Association of Medical Examiners.

He was formerly Director of Cardiovascular Research with the Veteran&#x27;s Hospital in Pittsburgh. Well known in the field of cardiovascular research, Zugibe was a Fellow of the American College of Cardiology, Fellow of the Council on Arteriosclerosis of the American Heart Association, Fellow of the New York Cardiological Society, and Member of the International Atherosclerosis Society.
Zugibe spent most of his career as the chief medical examiner of Rockland County, New York, appointed on August 15, 1969, to his retirement on December 31, 2002, and continuing as Acting Medical Examiner to March 31, 2003, until his successor was confirmed. On his retirement he estimated his office had done 10,000 autopsies during his tenure.

Zugibe is well known for his research into crucifixion and the Shroud of Turin, which modifies the theories of Pierre Barbet regarding crucifixion, and the Catholic Church regarding the Shroud of Turin. He made numerous television appearances on these subjects, including &quot;How Jesus Died - the Final 18 Hours&quot; (Learning Channel and History Channel), &quot;The Shroud of Turin&quot; (CBC), &quot;Jesus, the Man&quot; (Discovery Channel), &quot;Son of God&quot; (BBC), &quot;Stigmata and the Shroud&quot; (In Search of...), &quot;The Stigmata&quot; (Learning Channel), &quot;The Shroud of Turin&quot; (60 Minutes, Australia), &quot;DaVinci and the Shroud&quot; (National Geographic), The Mystery of Jesus (CNN) and &quot;The Naked Archaeologist&quot;.

Zugibe was one of the people investigating the Eucharistic miracle of Buenos Aires.

In 2003 Rockland County dedicated the Rockland County Medical Examiner&#x27;s Office as the Dr. Frederick T. Zugibe Forensic Unit. A new disease, Glycoprotein Storage Disease, first described in the &quot;American Journal of Medicine&quot; by Zugibe and co-author Dr. Enid Gilbert, has been named the Zugibe-Gilbert Syndrome.

Frederick Zugibe died on Friday, September 6, 2013 at the age of 85.

<text>The Flint River is a river in the U.S. state of Georgia. The river drains of western Georgia, flowing south from the upper Piedmont region south of Atlanta to the wetlands of the Gulf Coastal Plain in the southwestern corner of the state. Along with the Apalachicola and the Chattahoochee rivers, it forms part of the ACF basin. In its upper course through the red hills of the Piedmont, it is considered especially scenic, flowing unimpeded for over . Historically, it was also called the Thronateeska River.

==Description==
The Flint River rises in west central Georgia in the city of East Point in southern Fulton County on the southern outskirts of the Atlanta metropolitan area as ground seepage. The exact start can be traced to the field located between Plant Street, Willingham Drive, Elm Street, and Vesta Avenue. It travels under the runways of the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. Flowing generally south through rural western Georgia, the river is fed by Line Creek, and Whitewater Creek in Fayette County. The river passes through Sprewell Bluff State Park, approximately west of Thomaston. Farther south, it comes within of Andersonville, the site of the Andersonville prison during the Civil War.

In southwestern Georgia, the river flows through downtown Albany, the largest city on the river. At Bainbridge it joins Lake Seminole, formed at its confluence with the Chattahoochee River upstream from the Jim Woodruff Dam, very near the Florida state line. From this confluence, the Apalachicola River flows south from the reservoir through Florida to the Gulf of Mexico.

The Flint River is fed by Kinchafoonee Creek just north of Albany, and by Ichawaynochaway Creek in southwestern Mitchell County, approximately northeast of Bainbridge.

In addition to Lake Seminole, the Flint River is impounded approximately upstream from Albany to form the Lake Blackshear reservoir.

The Flint River is one of only 40 rivers in the nation to flow more than unimpeded by dams or other manmade systems, and is increasingly valued for that. In the 1970s, a plan by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to build a dam at Sprewell Bluff in Upson County was defeated by Jimmy Carter, then the Governor of Georgia, and other supporters. Carter&#x27;s hometown of Plains is located near the Flint River.

==Natural history==
The river is considered to have three distinct sections as it flows southward through western Georgia. In its upper reaches in the red hills of the Piedmont, it flows through a deeply incised channel etched into crystalline rocks. South of its fall line near Culloden, the channel transforms to a broad, forested swampy flood plain. South of Lake Blackshear, it transforms again, flowing through a channel in limestone rock above the Upper Floridan Aquifer below southwestern Georgia and northwestern Florida .

The river has been prone to floods throughout its history. In 1994, during flooding from Tropical Storm Alberto, the river crested at in Albany, resulting in the emergency evacuation of over 23,000 residents. It caused one of the worst natural disasters in the state&#x27;s history. Interstate 75 was closed in Macon, and Albany State University was also seriously flooded, as the river became a few miles or several kilometers wide in some places. The water lifted caskets from cemeteries and left them, along with drowned cattle and other livestock, stuck in trees and other places.

Montezuma, Georgia was completely inundated after the Flint River topped the 29-foot levee protecting the town from floodwater. The official depth of the river at the height of the flood was estimated at 34 feet. The nearby gauge was underwater, making it impossible to get an accurate reading. Cleanup and restoration of Albany took months to complete. In 1998 another serious flood occurred in Albany, but it was not as damaging as the one of 1994. Bainbridge also flooded in 1998. Other significant floods occurred in 1841 and 1925.

In January 2002, a winter storm blew through Atlanta the day after New Year&#x27;s Day. The airport&#x27;s drainage system overflowed, resulting in deicing fluid leaking into the river. Although the antifreeze entered the drinking water of some residents, no one became seriously ill. The airport changed its drainage system to prevent the problem in the future. No problems were reported after an unusually heavy of rain officially fell at the airport at the beginning of March 2009.

In May 2009, the National Fish Habitat Action Plan named the Lower Flint River one of its &quot;10 Waters to Watch&quot; for 2009 for its habitat restoration work. In October 2009, American Rivers placed the Flint on its list of America&#x27;s Most Endangered Rivers, mainly due to new plans to put a dam on it.

The Flint is one of four rivers in the southeast with significant remaining populations of &quot;Hymenocallis coronaria&quot;, the Shoals spider-lily. Four separate stands of the plant have been studied and documented in the river, ranging from Yellow Jacket Shoals to Hightower Shoals.

==In popular culture==
In &quot;Gone With the Wind,&quot; author Margaret Mitchell describes the Flint River as bordering the fictional plantation Tara.

American country music singer Luke Bryan, a native of Georgia, references the river in his songs &quot;That&#x27;s My Kind of Night&quot;; &quot;Huntin&#x27;, Fishin&#x27; &amp; Lovin&#x27; Every Day&quot;; and &quot;We Rode in Trucks&quot;.

<text>The Duluth MN–WI Metropolitan Area, commonly called the Twin Ports, is a small metropolitan area centered around the cities of Duluth, Minnesota and Superior, Wisconsin. The Twin Ports are located at the western part of Lake Superior (the westernmost part of North America&#x27;s Great Lakes) and together are considered one of the larger cargo ports in the United States. The Twin Ports are close to many natural attractions such as the North Shore, the Apostle Islands, and the Superior National Forest. 
The area is home to two long bridges: the Richard I. Bong Memorial Bridge (carrying U.S. Route 2) and the John Blatnik Bridge (carrying Interstate 535 and U.S. Route 53). Each bridge reaches across more than 1.5 miles (2.5 km) across the mouth of the Saint Louis River. The Aerial Lift Bridge was constructed in 1905 and is on the National Register of Historic Places. It must be raised each time a vessel enters or leaves Duluth&#x27;s harbor; the inlet on the Wisconsin side is not similarly obstructed.

Together, the cities rank as the 19th-busiest port in the country overall (44.2 million short tons [40.1 million tonnes] per year) as of 2002, though the area is the 7th-busiest port (13.8 million short tons [12.5 million tonnes] per year) when measured on foreign exports alone.

The census bureau&#x27;s Twin Ports metropolitan statistical area, an area much larger than the Duluth metropolitan area includes all of Wisconsin&#x27;s Douglas County, and Minnesota&#x27;s Carlton and Saint Louis counties. With a 2020 census population of 291,638, the Duluth MSA ranked as the 170th largest metropolitan area in the United States. A tourist location that boasts many scenic natural amenities, approximately 6.7 million tourists visit The City of Duluth each year.
