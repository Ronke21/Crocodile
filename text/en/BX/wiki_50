<doc id="673438" wikidata="Q6052753" url="?curid=673438" title="Local government in the Bahamas">
<text>Local government in the Bahamas exists at two levels: 32 districts and 41 towns. The boundaries of districts are defined by the First Schedule of The Bahamas Local Government Act 1996 (as amended by law and declarations of the Minister responsible for Family Island Affairs), defined with reference to parliamentary constituency boundaries. The Second Schedule lists 13 districts which are divided into town areas. Towns are governed by directly elected town committees. Second Schedule districts are governed by nine-person district councils composed of the chairs of the town committees, and if numerically required, additional people elected by the town committees. The 19 Third Schedule districts are unitary authorities which cannot be divided into towns. They are governed by nine-person district councils which are directly elected by voters. The powers of Second Schedule and Third Schedule councils are slightly different, and the Third Schedule district known as the City of Freeport has a slightly different list of enumerated powers.

At the national level, local government policy is formulated and administered by the Department of Lands and Local Government through the Office of the Prime Minister. The day-to-day policy handling of the portfolio falls to the Minister of Local Government who also is empowered to modify the list and boundaries of districts. Administrative and financial management of local government is overseen by the ministry&#x27;s permanent secretary.

==History==
Local government previously existed in the Bahamas in the form of appointed &quot;Board of Works&quot;. Here towns and villages held their influence over these Board of Works, but almost all final decisions were made by the central government through that islands&#x27; Commissioner. The modern system of local government that is in use today was created by the 8 March 1996. The Out Islands of the country could now enjoy a somewhat greater degree of autonomy, but New Providence Island, in which the capital city Nassau is located, was to be directly governed by the central government. The Act defines the form of government in each district by listing it on either its Second Schedule or its Third Schedule.

==Districts==
The Districts of the Bahamas provide a system of local government everywhere in the Bahamas except New Providence (where Nassau the capital is located, whose affairs are handled directly by the central government). The current system dates from 1996 when 23 districts were created by The Bahamas Local Government Act of 1996; a further 9 have been added since 1999.

Since the creation of the system, the question of local government for New Providence has been debated. The Minister responsible for Family Island Affairs has the power to create one or more districts for all or part of New Providence by decree.

As of the 1999 updates, the Second Schedule districts are:
* Cat Island
* Central Abaco
* Central Andros
* Central Eleuthera
* East Grand Bahama
* Exuma
* Long Island
* North Abaco
* North Andros
* South Abaco
* South Andros
* South Eleuthera
* West Grand Bahama

As of the 1999 updates, the Third Schedule districts are:
* Acklins
* Berry Islands
* Bimini
* Black Point
* City of Freeport
* Crooked Island
* Grand Cay
* Harbour Island
* Hope Town
* Inagua
* Long Cay
* Mangrove Cay
* Mayaguana
* Moore&#x27;s Island
* North Eleuthera
* Ragged Island
* Rum Cay
* San Salvador
* Spanish Wells

==Types of councils==

Every district in the Bahamas, with the exception of New Providence, has a district council. A district council is a corporate body with perpetual succession; capable of entering into contracts, of suing and being sued, of acquiring, holding, leasing and disposing of property of any description, and of doing all such things and entering into such transactions that are within the scope of the &quot;Local Government Act.&quot; District Councillors are elected by the population of that district in accordance with Local Government Act. As stated in The Bahamas Local Government Act 1996, Districts councillors shall within two weeks of their election, elect from among themselves a Chief Councillor. The Chief Councillor is the representative of a Districts Council for all affairs and presides over all meetings and also themselves co-ordinate these meetings.

All districts councils are classed as first-schedule councils. The first-schedule is further sub-divided into two types of councils: two tier second-schedule district councils that have town committees within their jurisdiction, and unitary third-tier district councils. Second-schedule districts have the following statutory boards and committees:

* Road Traffic Licensing Authority
* Port and Harbour Authority
* Hotel Licensing Board
* Liquor and Shop Licensing
* Town Planning Committee

Town committees are sub-structures of the second-schedule district councils, but are also corporate bodies themselves. They share responsibility with second-schedule district councils for a number of the schedule local government functions. They also have statutory responsibility for local regulation and licensing within their jurisdiction. Third-schedule districts councils are unique within the Bahamas because they combine the responsibilities of the second-schedule districts and of the town committees. Both second- and third-schedule district councils carry out a building control function.

==Elections==

Local government elections take place once every three years in the Bahamas with the most recent elections taking place on 27 January 2022. The 2020 elections were postponed due to COVID-19 until Emergency Power Orders were lifted. The voting system used in local government elections is the first-past-the-post system. Both councillors of third-schedule district councils and members of town committees are directly elected, while members of second-schedule councils are indirectly elected from town committees. Third schedule district councils have between five and nine members, whereas the size of councils in both second-schedule councils and town committees varies according to population size. By elections are held whenever the need arises. A councillor is deemed to have resigned if they are absent for three consecutive meetings.

For both types of district councils the Chief Councillors and their deputies are indirectly elected from amongst the elected officials. They serve for the lifetime of the council and the Minister of Local Government determines their stipend. Second-schedule district councils&#x27; statutory boards also elect chairpersons and their deputies from amongst their members.

<text>The African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (, PAIGC) is a political party in Guinea-Bissau. Originally formed to peacefully campaign for independence from Portugal, the party turned to armed conflict in the 1960s and was one of the belligerents in the Guinea-Bissau War of Independence. Towards the end of the war, the party established a socialist one-party state, which remained intact until multi-party democracy was introduced in the early 1990s. Although the party won the first multi-party elections in 1994, it was removed from power in the 1999–2000 elections. However, it returned to office after winning parliamentary elections in 2004 and presidential elections in 2005, since which it has remained the largest party in the National People&#x27;s Assembly.

The PAIGC also governed Cape Verde, from its independence in 1975 to 1980. After the 1980 coup d&#x27;état in Guinea-Bissau, the Cape Verdean branch of the PAIGC was converted into a separate party, the African Party for the Independence of Cape Verde.

==History==

===Pre-independence===
The party was established in Bissau on 19 September 1956 as the African Party of Independence (&quot;Partido Africano da Independência&quot;), and was based on the Movement for the National Independence of Portuguese Guinea (&quot;Movimento para Independência Nacional da Guiné Portuguesa&quot;) founded in 1954 by Henri Labéry and Amílcar Cabral. The party had six founding members; Cabral, his brother Luís, Aristides Pereira, Fernando Fortes, Júlio Almeida and Elisée Turpin. Rafael Paula Barbosa became its first president, whilst Amílcar Cabral was appointed secretary-general.

The Pidjiguiti massacre in 1959 saw Portuguese soldiers open fire on protesting dockworkers, killing 50. The massacre caused a large segment of the population to swing towards the PAIGC&#x27;s push for independence, although the Portuguese authorities still considered the movement to be irrelevant, and took no serious action in trying to suppress it. However, the massacre convinced the PAIGC leadership to resort to armed struggle against the Portuguese, and in September 1959 the party established a new headquarters in Conakry in neighbouring Guinea. In 1961, the PAIGC combined with the Mozambican FRELIMO and Angolan MPLA to establish the Conference of Nationalist Organizations of the Portuguese Colonies (CONCP), a common party to coordinate the struggles for independence of Portuguese colonies across Africa. The three groups were often represented at international events by the CONCP.

Armed struggle against the Portuguese began in March 1962 with an abortive attack by PAIGC guerrillas on Praia. Guerrilla warfare was largely concentrated to the mainland Guinea, however, as logistical reasons prevented an armed struggle on the Cape Verde islands. On the Cape Verde islands PAIGC worked in a clandestine manner. After being nearly crippled militarily, Amílcar Cabral ordered that sabotage be the PAIGC&#x27;s main weapon until military strength could be regained. On 23 January 1963 the PAIGC started the Guinea-Bissau War of Independence by attacking a Portuguese garrison in Tite. Frequent attacks in the north also took place. In that same month, attacks on police stations in Fulacunda and Buba were carried out not only by the PAIGC but also by the FLING.

In January 1966, Amílcar Cabral attended the Tricontinental Conference 1966 in Havana and made a great impression on Fidel Castro. As a result of this, Cuba agreed to supply artillery experts, doctors and technicians to assist in the independence struggle. The head of the Cuban Military Mission was Víctor Dreke. In the context of the ongoing Cold War, PAIGC guerrillas also received Kalashnikovs from the USSR and recoilless rifles from the People&#x27;s Republic of China, with all three countries helping train guerrilla troops. SFR Yugoslavia sent a small cache of weapons to PAIGC in 1966.

The first party congress took place at liberated Cassaca in February 1964, in which both the political and military arms of the PAIGC were assessed and reorganized, with a regular army (Revolutionary Armed Forces of the People, FARP) to supplement the guerrilla forces (The People&#x27;s Guerrillas).

The party also founded a Pilot School in Conakry in this period, led by Lilica Boal from 1969 onward, with the goal of educating young fighters and war orphans.

Como Island was the site of a major battle between PAIGC and Portuguese forces, in which the PAIGC took control of the island and resisted fierce counterattacks by the Portuguese, including airstrikes by FAP (Portuguese: &quot;Força Aérea Portuguesa&quot;; Portuguese Air Force) F-86 Sabres. Following the loss of Como Island, the Portuguese army, navy and the air force (FAP) began the Operation Trident, a combined arms operation to retake the island. The PAIGC fought fiercely, and the Portuguese took heavy casualties and gained ground slowly. Finally, after 71 days of fighting and 851 FAP combat sorties, the island was taken back by the Portuguese. However, less than two months later, the PAIGC would retake the island, as the Portuguese operation to capture it had depleted much of their invasion force, leaving the island vulnerable. However, Como Island ceased to be of strategic importance to Portugal following establishment of new PAIGC positions in the south, especially on the Cantanhez and Quitafine Peninsulas. Large numbers of Portuguese troops on these peninsulas were encircled and besieged by guerrillas.

Throughout the war, the Portuguese handled themselves poorly. It took them a long time to finally take the PAIGC seriously, diverting aircraft and troops based in Guinea to the conflicts in Mozambique and Angola, and by the time that the Portuguese government began to realise that the PAIGC was a significant threat to their continued rule over Guinea, it was too late. Very little was done to curtail the guerrilla operations; the Portuguese didn&#x27;t try to sever the link between the populace and the PAIGC until very late in the war, and as a result, it became very dangerous for Portuguese troops to operate far from their fortresses.

By 1967, the PAIGC had carried out 147 attacks on Portuguese barracks and army encampments, and effectively controlled two-thirds of Portuguese Guinea. The following year, Portugal began a new campaign against the guerrillas with the arrival of the new governor of the colony, António de Spínola. Spínola began a massive construction campaign, building schools, hospitals, new housing and improving telecommunications and the road system, in an attempt to gain public favour in Guinea. PAIGC was the first African party to establish a comprehensive cooperative program with Sweden.

However, in 1970, the FAP began to use similar weapons to those the US was using in the Vietnam War: napalm and defoliants, the former to destroy guerrillas when they could find them, the latter to decrease the number of ambushes that occurred when they could not. Spínola&#x27;s tenure as governor marked a turning point in the war: Portugal began to win battles, and in the Operation Green Sea, a Portuguese raid on Conakry, in the neighbouring Republic of Guinea, 400 amphibious troops attacked the city and freed 26 Portuguese prisoners of war kept there by the PAIGC. The USSR and Cuba began to send more weapons to Portuguese Guinea via Nigeria, notably several Ilyushin Il-14 aircraft to use as bombers.

Between August and November 1972 the party held elections to regional councils, whose members then elected a National Assembly. Whilst previous elections held by the Portuguese authorities saw suffrage limited to a few thousand people meeting tax and literacy requirements, these were arguably the first elections held in the territory under universal suffrage. Voters were presented with a list of PAIGC candidates, and had the choice to vote for or against. Around 78,000 people took part in the election, with 97% voting for the lists.

On 20 January 1973 Amílcar Cabral, was assassinated by naval commander Inocêncio Kani as part of a plan within the PAIGC to overthrow the leadership. However, despite Cabral&#x27;s death, the plot failed to topple the leadership, and 94 people were subsequently found guilty of involvement, complicity or suspected complicity. Kani and at least ten others were executed in March. Later in the year independence was unilaterally declared on 24 September 1973 and was recognized by a 93–7 UN General Assembly vote in November, unprecedented as it denounced the Portuguese colonial rule as aggression and occupation. The UN recognition was prior to Portuguese recognition. The conflict had seen 1,875 Portuguese soldiers (out of 35,000 stationed in Portuguese Guinea) and some 6,000 (out of 10,000) PAIGC troops killed by the end of the eleven-year war.

===Post-independence===

After achieving independence, the PAIGC was instituted as the sole legal political party of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde, with Luís Cabral becoming President of Guinea-Bissau. A second set of one-party elections were held in 1976 and 1977. Although the PAIGC strove for a union between Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde, the union finally broke down following a military coup led by João Bernardo Vieira against the Cape Verdean Cabral in November 1980. The Cape Verdean branch of PAIGC was subsequently converted into a separate party, the African Party for the Independence of Cape Verde (PAICV).

Under Vieira, the party continued to govern the country in the 1980s and 1990s. One-party elections were held in 1984 and 1989, and Vieira was re-elected as PAIGC Secretary-General at the party&#x27;s fourth congress in November 1986. Following the introduction of multi-party politics in May 1991, the first multi-party elections were held in 1994. The general elections also saw the introduction of the direct election of the president. Vieira beat Kumba Ialá of the Party for Social Renewal (PRS) in the run-off, while the PAIGC won 62 out of 100 seats in the National People&#x27;s Assembly with 46% of the vote.

Vieira was re-elected for another four-year term as President of PAIGC in mid-May 1998 at the party&#x27;s sixth congress, with 438 votes in favor, eight opposed, and four abstaining; the post of Secretary-General was abolished at this congress. An outbreak of civil war in June 1998 eventually led to the ousting of Vieira in May 1999. A few days later, former Prime Minister Manuel Saturnino da Costa was named acting President of the PAIGC on 12 May 1999. Vieira was expelled from PAIGC at a party congress in September 1999 for &quot;treasonable offences, support and incitement to warfare, and practices incompatible with the statutes of the party&quot;. Francisco Benante, the leader of reformists within the party and the only civilian in the transitional military junta, was elected as the President of PAIGC at the end of the congress on 9 September 1999. Benante&#x27;s candidacy was supported by the junta, and he received 174 votes against 133 votes for the only opposing candidate.

General elections were held in November 1999, with a presidential runoff on 16 January 2000. The elections saw the PAIGC lose power for the first time as PAIGC candidate Malam Bacai Sanhá lost to PRS leader Ialá in the presidential elections, whilst the PAIGC were reduced to being the third-largest party in the National People&#x27;s Assembly after being beaten by the PRS and the Resistance of Guinea-Bissau-Bafatá Movement.

The 2004 legislative elections saw the PAIGC regain its position as the largest party, winning 45 of 100 seats. In May 2004 it formed a government with party leader, Carlos Gomes Júnior becoming prime minister. In the 2005 presidential election, PAIGC candidate Malam Bacai Sanhá was defeated in the second round by Vieira, who had returned from exile and ran as an independent. A few weeks after taking office, Vieira dismissed Carlos Gomes Júnior as prime minister and appointed Aristides Gomes, who had formerly been a high-ranking member of PAIGC but had left the party to support Vieira.

In March 2007, the PAIGC formed a three-party alliance with the PRS and the United Social Democratic Party as the three parties sought to form a new government. This led to a successful no-confidence vote against Aristides Gomes and his resignation late in the month; on 9 April Martinho Ndafa Kabi, the choice of the three parties, was appointed prime minister by Vieira, and on 17 April a new government was named, composed of ministers from the three parties. PAIGC withdrew its backing for Kabi on 29 February 2008, stating that this was done &quot;to avoid acts of indiscipline threatening cohesion and unity in the party&quot;.

The PAIGC&#x27;s seventh Ordinary Congress was held in Gabú in June 2008. Malam Bacai Sanhá, the party&#x27;s presidential candidate in 2000 and 2005, challenged Gomes for the party leadership, but Gomes was re-elected for a five-year term as President of PAIGC by a vote of 578–355. Kabi, Cipriano Cassama (considered a dissident within the party and associated with Aristides Gomes), and Baciro Dja also contested the leadership election, but attracted comparatively little support.

After Kabi dismissed the directors of customs, taxes and the treasury on 25 July 2008 without notifying the party, the PAIGC decided to withdraw from the three-party stability pact that was signed in March 2007. Vieira then dismissed Kabi and appointed Carlos Correia as prime minister on 5 August. Parliamentary elections were subsequently held in November 2008, with the PAIGC winning two-thirds of the seats. In presidential elections the following year, Sanhá defeated Kumba Ialá in the run-off.

After Sanhá&#x27;s death in January 2012, early presidential elections were held. Carlos Gomes Júnior was nominated as the PAIGC candidate, and advanced to the runoff alongside Iála, but a military coup in April prevented it taking place. General elections were eventually held in 2014, and saw PAIGC candidate José Mário Vaz elected president, whilst the party also retained its majority in the National People&#x27;s Assembly, winning 57 of the 102 seats.

The party contested the 2023 legislative election as part of a broad coalition, the Inclusive Alliance Platform – Terra Ranka, that included UM, PCD, PSD and MDG and won a majority of the seats.

<text>Ali Germaine Landry (born July 21, 1973) is an American actress, model and beauty pageant titleholder who won Miss USA 1996. She played Rita Lefleur on the UPN sitcom &quot;Eve&quot; and was the Doritos Girl in a 1998 Super Bowl commercial. In 1998, she was named by &quot;People&quot; magazine as one of 50 most beautiful people in the world.

== Early life ==
Landry was named after Ali MacGraw after her mother had seen the 1970 film &quot;Love Story&quot;. Landry grew up in Cecilia, Louisiana, the daughter of Renella (Ray) and Gene Allen Landry. Landry is of French (Cajun) descent. She attended Cecilia High School, graduating in 1991. In high school, she was captain of the cheerleaders. She attended the University of Southwestern Louisiana, now University of Louisiana at Lafayette, and majored in mass communication. She is a member of Kappa Delta sorority.

==Pageantry==
Her first foray into pageantry came in 1990 when she was crowned Miss Louisiana Teen USA. She represented Louisiana in the 1990 Miss Teen USA pageant held in Biloxi, Mississippi in July 1990, where she placed first in the preliminary swimsuit and evening gown competitions, but was ranked seventh during the final competition.

In 1995, Landry won the 1996 Miss Louisiana USA title, becoming the first former Miss Louisiana Teen USA to win Miss Louisiana USA. She went on to compete in the 1996 Miss USA pageant, which was broadcast live from South Padre Island, Texas in February 1996 – she placed third highest after the preliminary competition and second highest on average during the final Top 10 competition. She was the highest placed of the Top 6 finalists and eventually went on to win the 1996 title.

She is the first former Miss Teen USA delegate to win the Miss USA crown outright (her predecessor Shanna Moakler, previously Miss Rhode Island Teen USA, Miss New York USA and first runner-up to Miss USA Chelsi Smith, only inherited the title after Smith became Miss Universe).

Landry competed in the 1996 Miss Universe pageant held in Las Vegas in May that year. She placed first in the preliminary competition and was ranked second in the evening gown and interview events during the final competition. She was second going into the next round of six delegates, but she was eliminated after the judges&#x27; questions.

Until 1999, Landry was the only former Miss Teen USA delegate to compete at Miss Universe. Her record at all three pageants was not surpassed until 2000 when Miss USA 2000, Lynnette Cole made the top 5 at all three pageants.

==Post-pageants==
Landry has done much modeling for photographers and magazines. As a spokeswoman for the Doritos chips brand, she appeared in celebrated TV commercials airing during the 1998, 1999 and 2000 Super Bowl football games. She was named by &quot;People&quot; magazine as one of the 50 most beautiful people in the world in 1998. Her house was featured on E!&#x27;s celebrity homes and on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Cribs&quot;. She has been listed as one of &quot;FHM&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100 Sexiest Women in the World numerous times. She was twice named on &quot;Stuff Magazine&quot;&#x27;s 100 Sexiest Women list. Askmen.com has named her one of the 50 Most Beautiful Women and 99 Most Desirable Women in the World.

In 2002, she hosted the second season of the hidden-camera series &quot;Spy TV&quot;. From 2003 to 2006, she was a regular cast member of the UPN sitcom &quot;Eve&quot;.

Landry has participated in the show &quot;Fear Factor&quot; and was runner-up. She is an avid athlete and also participated in the Boston Marathon.

She has hosted the English and Spanish-language versions of &quot;Spotlight to Nightlight&quot;, an interview show on Yahoo! where she talks with celebrity mothers about parenting issues. She also launched a lifestyle line, Belle Parish in 2009. Belle Parish launched with a children&#x27;s clothing line in September 2009, to be in stores spring 2010. The line is inspired by her Southern upbringing and the keepsake items her mother saved from her childhood.

Landry starred in (and was the executive producer of) TV Guide Network&#x27;s show, &quot;Hollywood Moms&#x27; Club&quot;, in November 2011. For the year 2012 she was the new face and spokesmodel of &quot;Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula&quot;, following in the footsteps of celeb moms Samantha Harris and Laila Ali who previously posed for Palmer&#x27;s.

==Personal life==
Landry met actor and TV personality Mario Lopez when he presented the Miss Teen USA 1998 pageant and she was a commentator. They were engaged during the summer of 2003 and married on April 24, 2004, in a Catholic ceremony in front of 50 guests at the exclusive Las Alamandas resort outside Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Two weeks later, she had the marriage annulled after learning that Lopez was unfaithful during his bachelor party before the wedding.

She married film director Alejandro Gómez Monteverde on April 8, 2006, in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico. They have three children: a daughter born in July 2007, and sons born in October 2011 and July 2013. Their son Valentin&#x27;s middle name was inspired by Pope Francis, as Landry and Monteverde met him while she was pregnant and he blessed the baby.

Her father-in-law, Juan Manuel Gómez Fernández, and brother-in-law, Juan Manuel Gómez Monteverde, were found dead with fatal head wounds in Pueblo Viejo, in the Mexican state of Veracruz, on September 19, 2015, approximately two weeks after they were kidnapped from their home in nearby Tamaulipas. On November 9, 2015, six people were arrested for the kidnapping and murder of Gómez Fernández and Gómez Monteverde. The suspects were allegedly holding six Central American nationals hostage at the time of their arrest, according to the Chief of the Mexican Federal Police.

==Filmography==

Landry and her husband Alejandro Monteverde made the film &quot;Bella&quot; together. &quot;Bella&quot; was directed by Monteverde and was produced by their business partners Sean Wolfington, Eduardo Verástegui, Leo Severino, and Denise Pinckley. Monteverde and the filmmakers received honors for &quot;Bella&quot; from the Toronto Film Festival, the Smithsonian and the White House. The Smithsonian Latino Center honored Monteverde with their &quot;Legacy Award&quot;. Monteverde was also given the &quot;Outstanding American by Choice&quot; award for &quot;Bella&quot;&#x27;s positive contribution to Latino art and culture in the U.S.

US President George W. Bush and First Lady Laura Bush saw the film and invited Monteverde to sit with Laura Bush in her private box during the annual State of the Union speech in 2007.

<text>Ex parte Bollman, 8 U.S. (4 Cranch) 75 (1807), was a case brought before the United States Supreme Court. &quot;Bollman&quot; held that the constitutional definition of treason excluded mere conspiracy to levy war against the United States.

Erick Bollman and Samuel Swartwout were civilians who became implicated in the Burr-Wilkinson Plot. This plot supposedly consisted of Aaron Burr and James Wilkinson attempting to create an empire in the United States, ruled by Burr. In 1806, Wilkinson informed President Thomas Jefferson of the plot, ending whatever may have actually been planned. Bollman and Swartwout attempted to recruit others into the plot, but these individuals informed the military, which promptly arrested them.

The Supreme Court decided that &quot;To constitute a levying of war, there must be an assemblage of persons for the purpose of effecting by force a treasonable purpose. Enlistments of men to serve against government is not sufficient.&quot;

Vinculum usage
A vinculum () is a horizontal line used in mathematical notation for various purposes. It may be placed as an &quot;overline&quot; or &quot;underline&quot; above or below a mathematical expression to group the expression&#x27;s elements. Historically, vincula were extensively used to group items together, especially in written mathematics, but in modern mathematics its use for this purpose has almost entirely been replaced by the use of parentheses. It was also used to mark Roman numerals whose values are multiplied by 1,000. Today, however, the common usage of a vinculum to indicate the repetend of a repeating decimal is a significant exception and reflects the original usage.

==History==
The vinculum, in its general use, was introduced by Frans van Schooten in 1646 as he edited the works of François Viète (who had himself not used this notation). However, earlier versions, such as using an underline as Chuquet did in 1484, or in limited form as Descartes did in 1637, using it only in relation to the radical sign, were common.

==Usage==
===Modern===
A vinculum can indicate a line segment where &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are the endpoints:
* formula_6

A vinculum can indicate the repetend of a repeating decimal value:
* = 0. = 0.1428571428571428571...

A vinculum can indicate the complex conjugate of a complex number:
* formula_7

Logarithm of a number less than 1 can conveniently be represented using vinculum:
* formula_8

In Boolean algebra, a vinculum may be used to represent the operation of inversion (also known as the NOT function):
* formula_9
meaning that Y is false only when both A and B are both true - or by extension, Y is true when either A or B is false.

Similarly, it is used to show the repeating terms in a periodic continued fraction. Quadratic irrational numbers are the only numbers that have these.

===Historical===
Formerly its main use was as a notation to indicate a group (a bracketing device serving the same function as parentheses):

:formula_10

meaning to add &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; first and then subtract the result from &quot;a&quot;, which would be written more commonly today as . Parentheses, used for grouping, are only rarely found in the mathematical literature before the eighteenth century. The vinculum was used extensively, usually as an overline, but Chuquet in 1484 used the underline version.

In India, the use of this notation is still tested in primary school.

===As a part of a radical===
The vinculum is used as part of the notation of a radical to indicate the radicand whose root is being indicated. In the following, the quantity formula_11 is the whole radicand, and thus has a vinculum over it:

:formula_12

In 1637 Descartes was the first to unite the German radical sign √ with the vinculum to create the radical symbol in common use today.

The symbol used to indicate a vinculum need not be a line segment (overline or underline); sometimes braces can be used (pointing either up or down).

==Encodings==
===Unicode===

===TeX===
In LaTeX, a text &lt;text&gt; can be overlined with codice_1. The inner codice_2 is necessary to
override the math-mode (here invoked by the dollar signs) which the codice_3 demands.

<text>Bill Kurtis (born William Horton Kuretich; September 21, 1940) is an American television journalist, television producer, narrator, and news anchor.

Kurtis was studying to become a lawyer in the 1960s, when he was asked to fill in on a temporary news assignment at WIBW-TV in Topeka, Kansas. His reporting on a devastating tornado outbreak led to a position as on-air news reporter and, later, a successful career as a news anchor in Chicago. He has been noted for his sonorous voice throughout his career. In the early 1980s, he anchored &quot;The CBS Morning News&quot; in New York City and became especially interested in investigative in-depth reports and documentaries. When he returned to Chicago and for a time resumed his anchor duties, he also founded a production company, Kurtis Productions.

Kurtis hosted or produced a number of crime and news documentary shows, including &quot;Investigative Reports&quot;, &quot;American Justice&quot;, and &quot;Cold Case Files&quot;. Kurtis is currently the scorekeeper/announcer for National Public Radio (NPR)&#x27;s news comedy/quiz show &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot; and the host of &quot;Through the Decades&quot;, a documentary-style news magazine on Decades (now Catchy Comedy).

== Early life ==
William Horton Kuretich was born on September 21, 1940, in Pensacola, Florida, to Wilma Mary Horton (1911–2002) and William A. Kuretich (Croatian: Kuretić), of Croatian origin (1914–2001), a United States Marine Corps brigadier general and decorated veteran of World War II. His father&#x27;s military career included extensive travel for his family. Upon his retirement, the family settled in Independence, Kansas.

Kurtis&#x27; sister is former Kansas state Senate Majority Whip Jean Schodorf, of Wichita, Kansas.

At age 16, Kurtis began working as an announcer for KIND, a radio station in Independence. He graduated from Independence High School in 1958, the University of Kansas with a Bachelor of Science degree in journalism in 1962 and he earned a Juris Doctor degree from Washburn University School of Law in 1966. While in law school, Kurtis worked part-time at WIBW-TV in Topeka, Kansas. After passing the Kansas bar examination and accepting a job with a Wichita law firm, Kurtis discussed his options with Harry Colmery and Bob McClure of Colmery and Russell and decided not to pursue a career in law.

Kurtis served as an enlisted man in the United States Marine Corps Reserve (Topeka, Kansas 1962–1966). He was commissioned a lieutenant (j.g.) in the United States Navy Reserve (Chicago, 1966–1969).

== Career ==

=== Television career ===
On the evening of June 8, 1966, Kurtis left a bar review class at Washburn to fill in for a friend at WIBW-TV to anchor the 6 o&#x27;clock news. Severe weather was approaching Topeka, so Kurtis stayed to update some weather reports. At 7:00 p.m., while on the air, a tornado was sighted by WIBW cameraman Ed Rutherford southwest of the city. Within 15 seconds another sighting came in: &quot;It&#x27;s wiped out an apartment complex.&quot; Kurtis&#x27;s warning – &quot;For God&#x27;s sake, take cover&quot; – became synonymous with the Tornado outbreak sequence of June 1966 that left 18 dead and injured hundreds more. Kurtis and the WIBW broadcast team remained on the air for 24 straight hours to cover the initial tornado and its aftermath. As the only television station in town and one of the few radio stations left undamaged, WIBW became a communications hub for emergency operations. The experience changed Kurtis&#x27;s career path from law to broadcast news. Within three months, after seeing his work covering the tornado, WBBM-TV in Chicago hired Kurtis and set the stage for a 30-year career with CBS.

The year 1966 in Chicago was the beginning of a tumultuous four years, and as a reporter and anchor Kurtis was in the middle of historic events. He covered the neighborhood fires that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and again when Robert F. Kennedy was shot. Protests against the Vietnam War dominated the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, which Kurtis covered. In 1969, Kurtis produced a documentary about Iva Toguri D&#x27;Aquino, &quot;Tokyo Rose&quot;, the first interview since her conviction for treason in 1949. His reporting, along with that of Ron Yates of the Chicago Tribune, helped persuade President Gerald Ford to pardon her in 1977. His legal education came into play when he covered the Chicago Seven conspiracy trial in 1969, which led to a job with CBS News in Los Angeles as correspondent. One of his first assignments was covering the Charles Manson murder trial for 10 months. He also covered the murder trials of Angela Davis and Juan Corona and the Pentagon Papers trial of Daniel Ellsberg.

In 1973, Kurtis returned to Chicago to co-anchor the 10 p.m. newscast with Walter Jacobson at WBBM-TV. In 1978, his investigative focus unit broke the story of Agent Orange, a defoliant sprayed on U.S. soldiers in Vietnam. After a dramatic screening of the documentary in Washington, D.C., the Veterans Administration issued guidelines to diagnose and compensate those veterans affected by Agent Orange. Kurtis returned to Vietnam in 1980 to cover the Vietnamese side of the story and, while there, discovered some 15,000 Vietnamese children conceived and left behind by Americans when the U.S. left in 1975. A story Kurtis wrote for &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; was instrumental in obtaining special status for the children to enter the United States, where they live today.

In 1982, Kurtis joined Diane Sawyer on &quot;The CBS Morning News&quot;, the network broadcast from New York City. The two were also on the &quot;CBS Early Morning News&quot;, which aired an hour earlier on most CBS stations. He also anchored three &quot;CBS Reports&quot;: &quot;The Plane That Fell from the Sky&quot;, &quot;The Golden Leaf&quot;, and &quot;The Gift of Life&quot;.

He returned to WBBM-TV in 1985. In 1986, Kurtis hosted a four-part science series on PBS called &quot;The Miracle Planet&quot; as well as a four-part series in 1987 on the Central Intelligence Agency. He formed his own documentary production company, Kurtis Productions, in 1988, the same year he produced &quot;Back to Chernobyl&quot; for the PBS series &quot;Nova&quot;. Kurtis narrated nearly 1,000 documentaries, and Kurtis Productions produced nearly 500 documentaries for series such as &quot;The New Explorers&quot; on PBS; &quot;Investigative Reports&quot; and &quot;Cold Case Files&quot; for A&amp;E; and Investigating History for the History Channel. He also hosted &quot;American Justice&quot;, produced by Towers Productions. For CNBC, the company has produced over 200 episodes of &quot;American Greed&quot;.

In 1994, Kurtis obtained a videotape showing Richard Speck, convicted of murdering eight student nurses in Chicago in 1966, having jailhouse sex and using drugs within the maximum security facility known as Stateville Correctional Center in Joliet, Illinois. He aired a report on WBBM-TV and produced a documentary for A&amp;E Network, resulting in the most sweeping changes to the Illinois penal system in its history.

Kurtis re-teamed with Walter Jacobson in 2010 to host WBBM-TV&#x27;s 6 p.m. newscast; they had co-hosted the station&#x27;s ratings-dominant 10 p.m. newscast from 1973 to Kurtis&#x27;s move in 1982 to The CBS Morning News. Having achieved the hoped-for ratings boost for the newscast, Kurtis and Jacobson retired as news anchors in 2013.

Kurtis has received two Peabody Awards, numerous Emmy Awards, awards from the Overseas Press Club, and a DuPont Award. He has been inducted into the Illinois and Kansas Halls of Fame. In 1998, he was awarded the University of Kansas William Allen White citation.

He is the narrator of a multimedia book by Joe Garner, &quot;We Interrupt This Broadcast&quot;, with a foreword by Walter Cronkite and an epilogue by Brian Williams, which was a sequel to the Edward R. Murrow record album &quot;I Can Hear It Now&quot;. Kurtis has authored three books: &quot;On Assignment&quot; (1984), &quot;Death Penalty on Trial&quot; (2004), and &quot;Prairie Table Cookbook&quot; (2008).

In June 2015, Kurtis commenced lead hosting duties of &quot;Through the Decades&quot;, a daily news magazine that covers historical events from that particular day since the advent of television. His co-hosts are reporters Kerry Sayers and Ellee Pai Hong. The program ended when Decades was rebranded to Catchy Comedy in February 2023.

=== Film work ===
Kurtis narrated the 2010 documentary film &quot;Carbon Nation&quot; by Peter Byck and was the narrator in the 2004 film starring Will Ferrell, &quot;&quot; and its sequel &quot;Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues&quot; (2013).

On July 8, 2013, Kurtis was named the Voice of Illinois Tourism.

=== &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot; ===
On several occasions starting in 2009, Kurtis appeared on NPR&#x27;s news quiz show &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot;, filling in for regular announcer Carl Kasell. He replaced Kasell on a permanent basis on May 24, 2014. One segment of the show has Kurtis reading out three news-related limericks with the last word or phrase missing for contestants to fill in.

== In popular culture ==
Author Randy Shilts decided to write his seminal 1987 book &quot;And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and The AIDS Epidemic&quot; after attending an awards ceremony in 1983. As described in the book, Kurtis gave the keynote address and told a joke: &quot;What&#x27;s the hardest part about having AIDS? Trying to convince your wife that you&#x27;re Haitian.&quot; Shilts believed the joke exemplified the &quot;business as usual&quot; treatment of AIDS in government and media.

In the animated series &quot;South Park&quot;, Eric Cartman owns a board game called &quot;Investigative Reports with Bill Kurtis&quot;, featuring a talking Bill Kurtis bust. The boys can be seen playing the game in South Park&#x27;s season four episode &quot;Cartman Joins NAMBLA&quot; (2000) and season eight episode &quot;Up the Down Steroid&quot; (2004). The game can also be seen on the shelf of a hobby store in the episode &quot;Cock Magic&quot; (2014).

Kurtis also contributed a spoken-word introduction to The Dandy Warhols&#x27; 2005 album &quot;Odditorium or Warlords of Mars&quot;.

The Shrine of Christ&#x27;s Passion, an interactive half-mile winding pathway of 40 life-size bronze statues depicting the Stations of the Cross that opened in June 2008, features a description of each scene and a short meditation recorded by Kurtis.

== Personal life ==
Kurtis and his wife, Helen, had two children, a daughter and a son. Mary Kristen was born in 1966, and Scott in 1970.
Kurtis&#x27;s wife Helen died at age 36 of breast cancer on June 11, 1977, in Omaha, Nebraska. He married his partner of 40 years, former Chicago TV news producer Donna La Pietra, on December 13, 2017. La Pietra was a partner with Kurtis in his Kurtis Productions company. Kurtis has homes in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago and in Mettawa, Illinois.

Kurtis and his sister, Jean Schodorf, inherited the historic site of the &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; as designated by the State of Kansas. It is now a not-for-profit museum with their grandmother&#x27;s one-room schoolhouse, a tiny post office from Wayside, Kansas, a homesteader&#x27;s farmhouse, and attendant farm buildings.

Kurtis&#x27;s father was a cousin of Frank Kurtis, who is in the Indianapolis 500 Hall of Fame.

Kurtis&#x27; son, Scott, died on July 20, 2009, at age 38 at the Kansas cattle ranch owned by his father. Scott Kurtis was known to have suffered from paranoid schizophrenia since his mid-teens.

In 2005, Kurtis founded Tallgrass Beef Company, which raised and distributed grass-fed, hormone-free organic beef. Some of the beef sold came from cattle raised on Kurtis&#x27;s ranch in Sedan, Kansas. On July 15, 2013, Tallgrass Beef Company, LLC forfeited its registration with the Kansas Secretary of State to do business in the state of Kansas.

<text>Flatliners is a 1990 American science fiction psychological horror film directed by Joel Schumacher, produced by Michael Douglas and Rick Bieber, and written by Peter Filardi. It stars Kiefer Sutherland, Julia Roberts, William Baldwin, Oliver Platt, and Kevin Bacon. The film is about five medical students who attempt to find out what lies beyond death by conducting clandestine experiments that produce near-death experiences. The film was shot on the campus of Loyola University Chicago between October 1989 and January 1990, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Sound Editing in 1990 (Charles L. Campbell and Richard C. Franklin). The film was theatrically released on August 10, 1990, by Columbia Pictures. It grossed $61 million at the box office.

A follow-up film directed by Danish filmmaker Niels Arden Oplev was released in September 2017, also featuring Sutherland in a starring role.

==Plot==

Medical student Nelson Wright convinces classmates Joe Hurley, David Labraccio, Rachel Manus, and Randy Steckle to help him discover what lies beyond death. Nelson flatlines for one minute before his classmates resuscitate him. While &quot;dead&quot;, he sees a boy he bullied as a child, Billy Mahoney. He merely tells his friends that he cannot describe what he saw, but something is there. The others follow Nelson&#x27;s feat.

Joe flatlines next and experiences an erotic sequence linked to his promiscuous lifestyle. After arguing with Rachel and out-bidding her of the length of time that they are willing to remain “dead”, David is third to flatline on Halloween and sees a girl, Winnie Hicks, whom he bullied in grade school.

The three men later start to experience hallucinations related to their visions. Nelson gets physically assaulted by Billy Mahoney twice. Joe, engaged to be married, is haunted by the women that he secretly videotaped during his sexual dalliances, who taunt him with the same false promises he used on them. On a train, David is confronted by the 8-year-old Winnie, who taunts him the way he taunted her.

Rachel decides to flatline next. David rushes in, intending to stop the others from giving her their same fate, but arrives too late. Rachel nearly dies when the power goes out and the men cannot shock her with defibrillator paddles. She survives, but she too is haunted by the memory of her father dying by suicide when she was young.

The three men reveal their harrowing experiences to one another, and David decides to put his visions to a stop. Meanwhile, Joe&#x27;s fiancée, Anne, comes to his apartment and, having discovered his videos, ends their relationship. Joe&#x27;s visions cease after Anne leaves him.

David goes to visit a now adult Winnie and apologizes. She accepts his apology and thanks him, who feels a weight lifted off his shoulders. David then finds Nelson, who accompanied him to visit Winnie, beating himself with an axe. In Nelson&#x27;s mind, Billy is again attempting to beat him to death. David stops him, and they return to town, where Rachel confronts Nelson about withholding the supernatural nature of the experiments from the rest of them, then storms off. David later instructs Joe and Randy to help Nelson find Billy.

Having an idea of what Rachel has experienced, David offers to let her stay with him and they fall asleep together. Meanwhile, Nelson takes Randy and Joe to a graveyard. He killed Billy as a kid by throwing rocks until he fell out of a tree. They try to convince Nelson that what he did was accidental, but he does not listen. They are eventually stranded when Nelson storms off in Joe&#x27;s Mustang.

David leaves Rachel to rescue Joe and Randy at the cemetery. While alone, she goes to the bathroom and finds her father. He apologizes to Rachel, whose guilt over his death is lifted after he reveals he was addicted to morphine and his suicide was related to post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from his tour in Vietnam. Nelson calls David&#x27;s house, and when Rachel answers he tells her he needs to flatline again to make amends. He apologizes for involving her and their friends in his reckless plan.

The three men realize what he intends and race to stop Nelson, who has been dead for nine minutes when they arrive. Together with Rachel, the four friends work to save him. In the afterlife, the boy Nelson is in the tree being stoned by Billy from the ground and dies from the subsequent fall. When almost all his friends are about to give up on reviving Nelson, Billy forgives him. David gives Nelson one last shock, which brings him back.

==Release==
Columbia Pictures released &quot;Flatliners&quot; theatrically on August 10, 1990. The film debuted at number 1 at the US box office, grossing $10 million on its opening weekend. It grossed $61.5 million total in the United States.

==Reception==
The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 50% of critics give the film a positive review based on 54 reviews, with the critical consensus &quot;While it boasts an impressive cast, striking visuals, and an effective mood, &quot;Flatliners&quot; never quite jolts its story to life.&quot; On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating to reviews, the film has a score 55 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

In her review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Caryn James wrote, &quot;when taken on its own stylish terms, &quot;Flatliners&quot; is greatly entertaining. Viewers are likely to go along with this film instantly or else ridicule it to death. Its atmospheric approach doesn&#x27;t admit much middle ground.&quot; Critic Roger Ebert praised the film as &quot;an original, intelligent thriller, well-directed by Joel Schumacher&quot; and called the cast &quot;talented young actors, [who] inhabit the shadows with the right mixture of intensity, fear and cockiness&quot;. But Ebert criticized &quot;Flatliners&quot; for &quot;plot manipulation that is unworthy of the brilliance of its theme. I only wish it had been restructured so we didn&#x27;t need to go through the same crisis so many times.&quot; Similarly, Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine praised the film&#x27;s young stars, but complained that &quot;by dodging the questions it raises about life after death, &quot;Flatliners&quot; ends up tripping on timidity. It&#x27;s a movie about daring that dares nothing.&quot;

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a &quot;D&quot; rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, &quot;What isn&#x27;t in evidence is the sort of overheated lunacy that made the William Hurt speed-freak trip movie &quot;Altered States&quot; (1980) such delectable trash. &quot;Flatliners&quot; is camp, but of a very low order. Schumacher is too intent on pandering to the youth market to take the mad risks and plunges that make for a scintillating bad movie.&quot; In contrast, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Rita Kempley loved the film, calling it: &quot;a heart-stopping, breathtakingly sumptuous haunted house of a movie&quot;. The film has become a cult film.

==Soundtrack==
* &quot;Party Town&quot; – Written and performed by Dave Stewart and the Spiritual Cowboys
* &quot;The Clapping Song&quot; – Written by Lincoln Chase

==Follow-up==

On October 5, 2015, a follow-up starring Elliot Page and Diego Luna was announced, following the casting of Nina Dobrev, James Norton and Kiersey Clemons. Kiefer Sutherland also appears in the remake. Sutherland had originally announced that he was reprising his role as Nelson Wright, revealing that the new film would actually be a sequel rather than a remake. However, upon release, Sutherland&#x27;s character is identified as Barry Wolfson; a deleted scene indicates Sutherland is in fact playing the same character, living under a new identity. Directed by Danish filmmaker Niels Arden Oplev, it was released on September 29, 2017.

<doc id="673472" wikidata="Q506403" url="?curid=673472" title="The Lost Boys">
<text>The Lost Boys is a 1987 American comedy horror film directed by Joel Schumacher, produced by Harvey Bernhard with a screenplay written by Jeffrey Boam, Janice Fischer and James Jeremias, from a story by Fischer and Jeremias. The film&#x27;s ensemble cast includes Corey Feldman, Jami Gertz, Corey Haim, Edward Herrmann, Barnard Hughes, Jason Patric, Kiefer Sutherland, Jamison Newlander and Dianne Wiest.

The film follows two teenage brothers who move with their divorced mother to the fictional town of Santa Carla, California, only to discover that the town is a haven for vampires. The title is a reference to the Lost Boys in J. M. Barrie&#x27;s stories about Peter Pan and Neverland, who, like vampires, never grow up. Most of the film was shot in Santa Cruz, California.

&quot;The Lost Boys&quot; was released by Warner Bros. Pictures on July 31, 1987, and was a critical and commercial success, grossing over $32 million against a production budget of $8.5 million. It has since then been described as a cult classic. The success of the film spawned a franchise with two sequels (&quot;Lost Boys: The Tribe&quot; and &quot;Lost Boys: The Thirst&quot;), and two comic book series.

==Plot==
The Emerson family—teenager Michael, his younger brother Sam, and their recently divorced mother Lucy—move to the seaside town of Santa Carla, California, to live with Lucy&#x27;s eccentric father (&quot;Grandpa&quot;). Lucy takes a job at a video store owned by Max, who takes a romantic interest in her. At the local comic book store, Sam meets the Frog brothers, Edgar and Alan, self-proclaimed vampire hunters, who claim the undead have infested the town.

Meanwhile, Michael becomes drawn to Star, a beautiful girl he meets on the boardwalk. He notices Star spending time with David, the charismatic leader of a local gang that includes Paul, Dwayne, and Marko. Sensing Michael&#x27;s interest in Star, David challenges him to keep up with them on their motorcycles, leading him to their hideout in a former luxury hotel buried during the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. There, David seems to manipulate Michael&#x27;s perception, making his food appear as maggots or worms, before offering him a bottle filled with red liquid. Although Star warns him that it contains blood, Michael drinks. David&#x27;s gang then leads him to a railway bridge, where they hang suspended over a vast drop, each member eventually letting go and disappearing into the fog. Michael, unable to hold on, falls—but he suddenly awakens in his bed.

Michael begins to change: he becomes sensitive to light, finds normal food revolting, and notices his reflection fading. He develops a craving for blood and nearly attacks Sam, but Sam&#x27;s dog, Nanook, intervenes and stops him. Though terrified, Sam agrees to help Michael and deduces that he is turning into a vampire. However, his transformation will only be complete if he feeds on human blood—and it may be reversible if they kill the head vampire. Sam, Edgar, and Alan suspect Max is the head vampire, but after Max is invited to dinner at Lucy&#x27;s house, they notice he has a reflection.

David and his gang attempt to push Michael into killing by revealing their true monstrous faces and demonstrating their ability to fly as they murder a group of partygoers. Michael resists the temptation to feed. Later, Star confides in Michael that she and Laddie, a young member of the gang, are also only partly transformed, as they, too, have refused to kill. She admits that David wanted her to kill Michael to complete her transformation. Determined to save her, Michael leads Sam and the Frog brothers to the gang&#x27;s lair during the day while the vampires are sleeping. They stake and kill Marko, whose pained screams awaken the others. The boys narrowly escape with Star and Laddie as David vows to hunt them down that night.

Michael, Sam, and the Frog brothers prepare for the gang&#x27;s impending assault, arming themselves with holy water, a longbow, and stakes. As night falls, David&#x27;s gang breaks into the Emerson home. In the ensuing fight, Sam, Nanook, and the Frog brothers kill Paul and Dwayne, while Michael takes on David. Michael resists David&#x27;s temptation to accept his transformation, ultimately impaling him on Grandpa&#x27;s collection of antlers. Despite David&#x27;s death, Michael&#x27;s transformation remains incomplete, leading the group to suspect that David was not the head vampire.

Lucy and Max return home from their date. Spotting David&#x27;s lifeless body, Max confesses he is the head vampire. He reveals he passed the boys&#x27; earlier vampire tests because he had been invited into their home, making him immune to those vulnerabilities. Max explains that he sought a disciplined family and ordered David to turn Michael and Sam to compel Lucy into becoming a willing mother to his lost boys. To save Michael, Lucy reluctantly agrees to Max&#x27;s offer. However, before Max can act, Grandpa crashes his truck through the wall, impaling Max with a large wooden fence post and causing him to explode. With Max&#x27;s death, Michael, Star, and Laddie revert to normal. Grandpa then quips, &quot;One thing about living in Santa Carla I never could stomach: all the damn vampires.&quot;

==Cast==
==Production==
===Background===
A March 5, 1985 &quot;Variety&quot; news item announced that the independent production company Producers Sales Organization (PSO) bought first-time screenwriters Janice Fischer and James Jeremias&#x27; &quot;Lost Boys&quot; script for $400,000 on February 20, 1985. PSO announced their acquisition of the project at the American Film Market in 1985. Warner Bros. later joined the project, taking over domestic distribution and some foreign territories.

The film&#x27;s title is a reference to the characters featured in J. M. Barrie&#x27;s &quot;Peter Pan&quot; stories, who—like vampires—never grow old. Jeremias said, &quot;I had read Anne Rice&#x27;s &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot;, and in that there was a 200-year-old vampire trapped in the body of a 12-year-old girl. Since Peter Pan had been one of my all-time favourite stories, I thought, &#x27;What if the reason Peter Pan came out at night and never grew up and could fly was because he was a vampire?&#x27;&quot; According to academic William Patrick Day, the central theme of &quot;The Lost Boys&quot;, &quot;organized around loose allusions to &quot;Peter Pan&quot;&quot;, is the tension surrounding the Emerson family and the world of contemporary adolescence. The film was originally set to be directed by Richard Donner, and Fischer and Jeremias&#x27; screenplay was modeled on Donner&#x27;s recent film &quot;The Goonies&quot; (1985). In this way the film was envisioned as more of a juvenile vampire adventure with 13 or 14-year-old vampires, while the Frog brothers were &quot;chubby 8 year-old Cub Scouts&quot; and the character of Star was a young boy. When Donner committed to other projects, Joel Schumacher was approached to direct the film although Donner eventually received credit as an executive producer. He came up with the idea of making the film sexier and more adult, bringing on screenwriter Jeffrey Boam to retool the script and raise the ages of the characters.

===Casting===
Schumacher said he had &quot;one of the greatest [casts] in the world. They are what make the film.&quot; Most of the younger cast members were relatively unknown. Schumacher and Marion Dougherty met with many candidates. Jason Patric was approached early on by Schumacher to play Michael Emerson, but Patric had no interest in doing a vampire film and turned it down &quot;many times&quot;. Eventually he was won over by Schumacher&#x27;s vision and his promise to allow the cast a lot of &quot;creative input&quot; in making the film. According to Kiefer Sutherland, Patric &quot;was really instrumental&quot; in adapting the script with Schumacher and shaping the film.

Schumacher envisioned the character of Star as being a waifish blonde, similar to Meg Ryan, but he was convinced by Jason Patric to consider Jami Gertz, who had just worked with Patric in &quot;Solarbabies&quot; (1986). Schumacher was impressed, but only at Patric&#x27;s insistence did he finally cast Gertz. Schumacher was surprised when his first choice for the role of Lucy, Dianne Wiest, accepted the role, as she had just recently won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; (1986) at the 59th Academy Awards.

After seeing Kiefer Sutherland&#x27;s portrayal of Tim in &quot;At Close Range&quot;, Schumacher arranged a reading with him at which they got on very well. Sutherland had just completed work on &quot;Stand by Me&quot; when he was offered the role of David. Schumacher said Sutherland &quot;can do almost anything. He&#x27;s a born character actor. You can see it in &quot;The Lost Boys&quot;. He has the least amount of dialogue in the movie, but his presence is extraordinary.&quot;

===Principal photography===
Most of the film was shot in Santa Cruz, California, starting on June 2, 1986, and ending on June 23, 1986 after 21 days of filming. Locations include the Santa Cruz Boardwalk, the Pogonip open space preserve, and the surrounding Santa Cruz Mountains. Other locations included a cliffside on the Palos Verdes Peninsula in Los Angeles County, used for the entrance to the vampire cave, and a valley in Santa Clarita near Magic Mountain where introductory shots were filmed for the scene where Michael and the Lost Boys hang from a railway bridge. Stage sets included the vampire cave, built on Stage 12 of the Warner Bros. lot, and a recreation of the interior and exterior of the Pogonip clubhouse on Stage 15, which stood in for Grandpa&#x27;s house.

Sutherland broke his right wrist while doing a wheelie on his motorcycle and had to wear gloves on set to conceal the cast. His motorcycle for the movie was adapted so he could operate it with his left hand only.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;The Lost Boys&quot; opened at number two during its opening weekend, with a domestic gross of over $5.2 million. It went on to gross a domestic total of over $32.2 million against an $8.5 million budget.

===Critical response===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 77% based on 77 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Flawed but eminently watchable, Joel Schumacher&#x27;s teen vampire thriller blends horror, humor, and plenty of visual style with standout performances from a cast full of young 1980s stars.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 63 out of 100 based on 16 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film two-and-a-half out of four stars, praising the cinematography and &quot;a cast that&#x27;s good right down the line&quot;, but ultimately describing &quot;Lost Boys&quot; as a triumph of style over substance and &quot;an ambitious entertainment that starts out well but ends up selling its soul.&quot; Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Dianne Wiest&#x27;s character a &quot;dopey mom&quot; and Barnard Hughes&#x27;s character &quot;a caricature of a feisty old Grandpa.&quot; She found the film more of a comedy than a horror and the finale &quot;funny&quot;. Elaine Showalter commented that &quot;the film brilliantly portrays vampirism as a metaphor for the kind of mythic male bonding that resists growing up, commitment, especially marriage.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; panned the film, calling it &quot;a horrifically dreadful vampire teensploitation entry that daringly advances the theory that all those missing children pictured on garbage bags and milk cartons are actually the victims of bloodsucking bikers.&quot;

The film won a Saturn Award for Best Horror Film at the 15th Saturn Awards in 1987.

===Cultural influence===
&quot;The Lost Boys&quot; has been credited with helping shift depictions of vampires in popular culture and bringing a more youthful, sexier appeal to the vampire genre. This inspired subsequent films like &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (1992). The scene in which David transforms noodles into worms was directly referenced in the 2014 vampire mockumentary film &quot;What We Do in the Shadows&quot;. The film inspired the song of the same name by the Finnish gothic rock band the 69 Eyes from their 2004 album &quot;Devils&quot;. Gunship&#x27;s 2018 &quot;Dark All Day&quot; music video and lyrics reference the themes and practical effects, on top of collaborating with Tim Cappello, who appears on the soundtrack and in the film as the beach concert performer.

The music video for &quot;Into the Summer&quot;, a song released by American rock band Incubus on August 23, 2019, pays homage to the film.

Event organizers Monopoly Events created &quot;the biggest &quot;Lost Boys&quot; reunion ever&quot; in 2019 at their annual horror fan convention, For the Love of Horror, which included Kiefer Sutherland, Jason Patric, Alex Winter, Jamison Newlander, and Billy Wirth along with musicians from the film, G Tom Mac, and Tim Cappello, who were reunited for the first time in over 30 years. G Tom Mac and Tim Cappello performed separate live music sets on the event stage to a vast crowd of fans on both days of the event, while Cappello performed a third time at the event after-party. All of the celebrities posed together for photographs in a purpose-built &quot;cave&quot; set modeled on the vampire cave seen in &quot;The Lost Boys&quot; original movie which was complete with a poster of Jim Morrison, a bottle of fake blood and David the vampire&#x27;s wheelchair. The group reunited once again at the 2023 event and this time Jason Patric gave a live commentary during a closed screening of the film in the venue.

The Frog brothers make a (non-canonical) cameo in Jenny Colgan&#x27;s 2001 novel &quot;Looking for Andrew McCarthy&quot;, in which they are now police officers and make brief, ominous reference to their past work with &quot;the supernatural&quot;.

== Home media ==
The film was released on DVD on January 28, 1998. On August 10, 2004, the film received a special edition two-disc release, which contained an audio commentary from Schumacher, deleted scenes, and making-of featurettes. The film was issued on Blu-ray on July 29, 2008. For the film&#x27;s 35th anniversary on September 20, 2022, it was released as a 4K Blu-ray SteelBook, in tandem with &quot;Poltergeist&quot; (1982). The release includes special features ported from the 2008 edition.

==Adaptations==
===Novelization===
Due to his past fantasy novels and horror short stories, Craig Shaw Gardner was given a copy of the script and asked to write a novelization to accompany the film&#x27;s release. At the time, Gardner was, like the Frog brothers, managing a comic book store as well as writing.

The novelization was released in paperback by Berkley Publishing and is 220 pages long. It includes several scenes later dropped from the film, such as Michael working as a trash collector for money to buy his leather jacket. It expands the roles of the opposing gang, the Surf Nazis, who were seen as nameless victims of the vampires in the film. It also includes several tidbits of vampire lore, such as not being able to cross running water and salt sticking to their forms.

===Comic books===
David makes a reappearance in the 2008 comic book series &quot;Lost Boys: Reign of Frogs&quot;, which serves as a sequel to the first film and a prequel to &quot;Lost Boys: The Tribe&quot;.

In October 2016, Vertigo released a comic book miniseries, &quot;The Lost Boys&quot;, where Michael, Sam, and the Frog brothers must protect Star from her sisters, the Blood Belles.

===Stage musical===
In December 2023, a musical adaptation was reported to be in development, directed by Michael Arden with music by the Rescues. It was announced on January 27, 2025 that the musical will arrive on Broadway in Spring 2026 at the Palace Theater.

==Sequels==
Kiefer Sutherland&#x27;s character, David, was impaled on antlers but does not explode or dissolve as do the other vampires. He was intended to have survived, which would be picked up in a sequel, &quot;The Lost Girls&quot;. Scripts for this and other sequels circulated over the years; Joel Schumacher made several attempts at a sequel during the 1990s, but nothing came to fruition.

A direct-to-DVD sequel, &quot;Lost Boys: The Tribe&quot;, was released in 2008. Corey Feldman returned as Edgar Frog, with a cameo by Corey Haim as Sam Emerson. Kiefer Sutherland&#x27;s half-brother Angus Sutherland played the lead vampire, Shane Powers.

A third film, &quot;Lost Boys: The Thirst&quot;, was released on DVD on October 12, 2010. Feldman served as an executive producer in addition to playing Edgar Frog, and Newlander returned as Alan Frog. Haim, who was not slated to be part of the cast, died in March 2010. A fourth film was discussed as well as a Frog brothers television series, but with the dissolution of Warner Premiere, the projects never materialized.

In September 2021, a new film was announced, to be directed by Jonathan Entwistle, from a script by Randy McKinnon, starring Noah Jupe and Jaeden Martell.

==Music==
Thomas Newman wrote the original score as an eerie blend of orchestra and organ arrangements.

The music soundtrack contains a number of notable songs and several covers, including &quot;Good Times&quot;, a duet between INXS and former Cold Chisel lead singer Jimmy Barnes which reached No. 2 on the Australian charts. This cover version of a 1960s Australian song by the Easybeats was originally recorded to promote the Australian Made tour of Australia in early 1987, headlined by INXS and Barnes.

Tim Cappello&#x27;s cover of the Call&#x27;s &quot;I Still Believe&quot; was featured in the film as well as on the soundtrack. Cappello makes a cameo appearance in the film playing the song at the Santa Cruz boardwalk, with his saxophone and bodybuilder muscles on display. Cappello frequently appears at fan conventions to perform the song.

The soundtrack features a cover version of the Doors&#x27; song &quot;People Are Strange&quot; by Echo &amp; the Bunnymen. The song as featured in the film is an alternate, shortened version with a slightly different music arrangement.

Lou Gramm, lead singer of Foreigner, recorded &quot;Lost in the Shadows&quot; for the soundtrack, along with a video which featured clips from the film.

The theme song, &quot;Cry Little Sister&quot;, was originally recorded by Gerard McMahon (under his pseudonym Gerard McMann) for the soundtrack, and later re-released on his album &quot;G Tom Mac&quot; in 2000. In the film&#x27;s sequel &quot;Lost Boys: The Tribe&quot;, &quot;Cry Little Sister&quot; was covered by a Seattle-based rock band, Aiden and appeared again in the closing credits of &quot;Lost Boys: The Thirst&quot;.

<text>Crossroads School for Arts &amp; Sciences is a private/independent, college preparatory school in Santa Monica, California, United States. The school is a former member of the G20 Schools Group.

==History==
The school was founded in 1971 as a secular institution affiliated with St. Augustine By-the-Sea Episcopal Church in Santa Monica. Although the founders, and many of the school&#x27;s original students, came from the former St. Augustine By-the-Sea Episcopal Day School in Santa Monica, Crossroads School has always been a secular institution. Crossroads started with three rooms in a Baptist church offering grades seven and eight, and an initial enrollment of just over 30 students. The name Crossroads was suggested by Robert Frost&#x27;s poem, &quot;The Road Not Taken&quot;, in which Frost writes:

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, and I,
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.

As St. Augustine&#x27;s grew to junior and senior high school, the founders started Crossroads with a separate board of directors and separate campus, which eventually merged in the 1980s under the name Crossroads. Co-founder Paul Cummins became the first headmaster and served until 1995.

==In the media==
The 2004 book &quot;Hollywood, Interrupted&quot;, by Andrew Breitbart and Mark Ebner, dedicated a large section to Crossroads; it depicted the school (and the celebrities who send their children there) in a negative light, focusing mainly on a handful of high-profile parents and &quot;drug problems&quot; stemming from the 1980s. The school was also featured in a May 2005 issue of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;; like Breitbart&#x27;s book, it also focused on the school&#x27;s celebrity clientele.

Elon Musk alleges that Crossroads teaches “full-on communism,” and blames his daughter&#x27;s transition, alleged communist ideology, and decision to cut him out of her life on Crossroads in his upcoming biography.

<text>Belus or Belos (Ancient Greek: Βῆλος, &quot;Belos&quot;) in classical Greek or classical Latin texts (and later material based on them) in a Babylonian context refers to the Babylonian god Bel Marduk. Though often identified with Greek Zeus and Latin Jupiter as Zeus Belos or Jupiter Belus, in other cases Belus is euhemerized as an ancient king who founded Babylon and built the ziggurat. He is recognized and worshipped as the god of war.

Eusebius of Caesarea (&quot;Praeparatio Evangelica&quot; 9.18) cites Artabanus as stating in his &quot;Jewish History&quot; that Artabanus found in anonymous works that giants who had been dwelling in Babylonia were destroyed by the gods for impiety, but one of them named Belus escaped and settled in Babylon and lived in the tower which he built and named the Tower of Belus. A little later Eusebius (9.41) cites Abydenus&#x27; &quot;Concerning the Assyrians&quot; for the information that the site of Babylon:... was originally water, and called a sea. But Belus put an end to this, and assigned a district to each, and surrounded Babylon with a wall; and at the appointed time he disappeared.This seems to be a rationalized version of Marduk&#x27;s defeat of Tiamat in the &quot;Enuma Elish&quot; followed here by Belus becoming a god. A little earlier in the same section, in a supposed prophecy by King Nebuchadnezzar, King Nebuchadnezzar claims to be descended from Belus.

Diodorus Siculus (6.1.10) cites Euhemerus as relating that Zeus (a euhemerized Zeus) went to Babylon and was entertained by Belus. Diodorus also relates (17.112.3) how the Chaldean of Babylon requested Alexander the Great to restore the &quot;Tomb of Belus&quot; which had been demolished by the Persians. Strabo (16.1.5) likewise refers to the ziggurat as the &quot;Tomb of Belus&quot; which had been demolished by Xerxes.

See Belus (Egyptian) for statements that &quot;Belus&quot; in reference to the Babylonian Zeus Belus actually refers to the Belus of Greek mythology, son of Poseidon by Libya.

It is likely the Babylonian Belus was not clearly distinguished from vague, ancient Assyrian figures named Belus though some chronographers make the distinction (see Belus (Assyrian)).

<text>Ahuntsic was a federal electoral district in Quebec, Canada, that was represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1968 to 1979 and from 1988 to 2015.

==Geography==
The district included the neighbourhoods of Ahuntsic and Bordeaux-Cartierville and the western part of the neighbourhood of Sault-au-Recollet in the Borough of Ahuntsic-Cartierville.

Prior to being abolished, its neighbouring ridings were Papineau, Mount Royal, Saint-Laurent—Cartierville, Laval, Alfred-Pellan, Bourassa, and Saint-Léonard—Saint-Michel.

==History==
The electoral district of Ahuntsic was created in 1966 from Saint-Denis and Laval ridings. In 1976, it was abolished when it was redistributed into Saint-Michel riding.

In 1987, the new district of Ahuntsic was created from Saint-Michel—Ahuntsic and Saint-Denis.

From 1993 to 2008 Ahuntsic was usually a competitive seat between Bloc Québécois and the Liberals. However, in 2011 Bloc Québécois incumbent Maria Mourani narrowly won reelection against a New Democratic surge that swept through Montreal and Quebec in general. Ahuntsic was the sole seat retained by Bloc Québécois in the Montreal area and one of only four won by the party overall at the 2011 federal election.

===Members of Parliament===

This riding has elected the following members of Parliament:

<text>Ahuntsic (; , ) is a district in the northern part of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Originally an independent village, Ahuntsic was first annexed by Montreal in 1910, then merged into the borough of Ahuntsic-Cartierville in 2002.

It is home to Collège Ahuntsic and .

==Name==

The district is named after a person of the same name, a man from the Huron nation, who was an understudy and associate of the French Recollet missionary to the Hurons, Nicolas Viel, in the 1620s in the colony of Quebec.

Viel had been one of the first missionaries in the country of the Hurons since 1923. In May 1625, Viel decided to return to Quebec city in the company of a band of Hurons, including Ahuntsic, with the intention of making a few days&#x27; retreat and then returning to his missions. It is known that both Viel and Ahuntsic drowned in the last chute of the Riviere des Prairies, which from that time bears the name of Sault-au-Récollet. This district is adjacent to the aforementioned chute, and has thus been named in honour of Ahuntsic.

==History==
The municipality of the Village of Ahuntsic was founded on January 21, 1897, by a proclamation of the Quebec provincial government. The council of the new village operated until 1910, when the province passed laws creating the charter of the City of Montreal. It was then annexed and later combined with Nouveau-Bordeaux, forming the district of Ahuntsic-Bordeaux. The city of Cartierville and Sault-au-Récollet were added in 1918.

In 1952, following a land exchange, Ahuntsic took over part of Saint-Laurent. During the municipal merger-demerger under Bernard Landry administration, the Ahuntsic-Cartierville borough was created on January 1, 2002 together with the district of Cartierville.

==Education==

The &quot;Collège Ahuntsic&quot; is a CEGEP in Ahuntsic.

The &quot;Commission scolaire de Montréal&quot; (CSDM) operates French-language public schools in Ahuntsic.
* École primaire Ahuntsic

The English Montreal School Board (EMSB) operates English-language schools.

The Montreal Public Libraries Network operates the Ahuntsic library.

<doc id="673520" wikidata="Q617807" url="?curid=673520" title="Departments of Ivory Coast">
<text>Departments of Ivory Coast () are currently the third-level administrative subdivision of the country. Each of the 31 second-level regions of Ivory Coast is divided into two or more departments. (The autonomous districts are containing departments, but have a specific status.) Each department is divided into two or more sub-prefectures. Since 2020, there are 109 departments of Ivory Coast.

Departments were first created in 1959. During their existence, they have been first-, second-, and third-level administrative subdivisions.

==Current departments==

There are currently 111 departments of Ivory Coast. The departments are as follows:
==History==

===1961–69===
Departments were established in 1961 and were the original first-level administrative subdivision of independent Ivory Coast. Initially, there were just four departments: Centre, Nord, Sud-Est, and Sud-Ouest. In 1963, two more departments were created: Est was created by dividing Sud-Est, and Centre-Ouest) was created by dividing Sud-Ouest. As a result of the divisions, Sud-Est was renamed Sud and Sud-Ouest was renamed Ouest.

===1969: 24 new departments===
In 1969, the six departments were abolished and in their place 24 new departments were created. The following table illustrates how the old departments were divided into the new departments:

Due to a lack of government resources, the 1969 changes were not fully implemented until 1974.

===Subsequent divisions and relegation to second-level===
From 1974 onward, new departments were occasionally created through division of pre-existing departments. New departments were created in 1974 (2), 1980 (8), 1988 (15), and 1995 (1). In 1997, when there were 50 departments, regions were created, which supplanted departments as the first-level administrative subdivision. As a result, the 50 departments became second-level divisions.

More departments were created in 1998 (8), 2005 (12), 2008 (11), and 2009 (9). By the time of the late-2011 reorganisation of the subdivisions of Ivory Coast, there were 90 departments in 19 regions.

===2011 subdivision reorganisation===
In the 2011 reorganisation of the subdivisions of Ivory Coast, five new departments were created, bringing the total to 95. More significantly, however, districts were created as a new first-level division. As a result, regions became second-level subdivisions and the 95 departments became third-level subdivisions.

===Post-2011 changes===
Since the 2011 reorganisation, 14 more departments have been created, bringing the total number to 109. Twelve departments were created in 2012, one in 2013, and one was created in 2020.

==Names and governance==
Departments are named after the city or town that serves as the seat of the department. In most cases, this is the most populous settlement in the department.

Each department is headed by a prefect, who is appointed by the council of ministers (cabinet) of the national government. For departments that house regional capitals, the prefect of the department is the same individual as the prefect of the region, though the two offices of prefect remain distinct.

Each department is divided into two or more sub-prefectures, which serve as fourth-level administrative subdivisions. There are currently 510 sub-prefectures in the country.

==Current departments by district and region==
Below are the departments divided by district and region with the establishment year of the departments in parentheses.

<text>David Porter Nixon (29 December 1919 – 1 December 1978) was an English magician and television personality. At the height of his career, Nixon was among the best-known magicians in the UK.

==Early life==
Born in Muswell Hill, London, Nixon attended the Westcliff High School for Boys in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex. His father was a lawyer whose hobby was magic and who took Nixon to watch performers such as Nevil Maskelyne and David Devant. One magician who made an early impression on the young boy was Stanley Collins, who had a gentlemanly image which influenced Nixon&#x27;s later performing style. Nixon started performing magic himself after an aunt bought him an Ernest Sewell Magic Box for Christmas. On leaving school he gained a job with the &quot;Henley Telegraph&quot;, the in-house magazine of the W. T. Henley Telegraph company, a publication which had been founded by Alfred Hitchcock. In 1938 he joined The Magic Circle. He also became an accomplished double bass player and performed with a local band.

==Entertainment career==
With the advent of the Second World War, Nixon joined ENSA, the organisation that was set up to provide entertainment for British troops. He had been prevented from serving in a front line role as a result of suffering from pneumonia when he was a teenager. In summer 1946, after leaving ENSA, he joined the Fol de Rols, a touring variety troupe based in Scarborough and in addition to his conjuring act he acted as compere in their shows. In July 1948, he was in the cast of the &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; revue at the Spa Theatre, Scarborough and he was joined on stage by the actor and comedian Norman Wisdom, who wreaked havoc with his act. The partnership was a success and the two men subsequently appeared at the London Casino in September 1948.

In addition to his magic act, Nixon sang, danced and worked front of house. In 1947, he married a singer named Margaret Burton. The same year he gained his first opportunity on television in a show called &quot;Café Continental&quot;. Nixon&#x27;s big break came in 1954 when he was invited to be a panelist on the British version of the television quiz show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, appearing in 150 editions between 1954 and 1963. He presented series such as the British version of &quot;Candid Camera&quot;, &quot;Comedy Bandbox&quot; (1962) (later &quot;David Nixon&#x27;s Comedy Bandbox&quot; (1966) and was Basil Brush&#x27;s first partner.

Nixon was in demand for private society parties and frequently performed at the soirees of Mayfair hostess, Dorothy Hartman, owner of Lendrum &amp; Hartman Limited, in Berkeley House, Hay Hill in the 1950s. His magic shows included &quot;Trix n Nixon&quot; (1962) &quot;Tonight with David Nixon&quot; (1969), &quot;David Nixon&#x27;s Magic Box&quot; (1970-71) and &quot;The David Nixon Show&quot; (1972-77) as well as &quot;David Nixon&#x27;s Christmas Magic&quot; (1974) that featured a classic magic trick where Lynsey de Paul appeared to disappear from a glass casket while leaving behind a still warm dress. He also appeared as a panelist in the BBC radio comedy panel game, &quot;Many a Slip&quot;.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1973 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the Magic Circle Headquarters in London. He then presented an episode of the programme the following year, in which the subject was the series&#x27; regular British host, Eamonn Andrews. A keen chess player, Nixon presented &quot;Checkmate&quot;, an ATV series teaching the basics of the game.

Alongside his skills as a magician, Nixon liked to use television technology for humour and entertainment. In the 1970s, when the technology of colour separation overlay became available, he developed a way to interact with a recording of himself apparently on the other side of a mirror. Not only was the conversation perfectly coordinated, he also used sleight-of-hand to appear to pass objects back and forth to himself.

David Nixon has been recognised as an influence on future UK magicians as diverse as Wayne Dobson and Jerry Sadowitz.

With a rich and mellow speaking voice, Nixon was in demand as a compere and narrator; he was a narrator in the show &quot;Emil and the Detectives&quot;, at the Mermaid Theatre, London.

David Nixon made his final television appearances posthumously, as a guest on &quot;Basil Brush&#x27;s Magical Christmas&quot;, broadcast on BBC1 on 23 December 1978, &quot;Celebrity Squares&quot;, broadcast on ITV on 24 February 1979 and on &quot;Give Us a Clue&quot;, also broadcast on ITV on 27 March 1979.

==Mellotron==
Among Nixon&#x27;s lesser known activities was his involvement in backing the development and manufacture of the Mellotron, an electro-mechanical musical instrument, and the company Mellotronics. He appeared in a 1965 Pathé newsreel feature to demonstrate the instrument.

==Death==

Nixon died of lung cancer in Surrey in 1978. He was a heavy smoker and was first found to have cancer in 1976. He underwent treatment, which appeared to have been successful, but the disease returned a couple of years later and he died just short of his 59th birthday.

==Private life==
Nixon married Margaret Burton in 1947; the couple divorced in 1952. Later the same year, Nixon married his second wife, Paula Marshall (Pauline E. Youngs), who worked with him in his act. Paula died aged 28 in a car crash in 1956, the year after the birth of their son Nicholas. Nixon remarried in 1961 to Vivienne Nichols, the step-daughter of the bandleader Eric Robinson. The couple had a daughter, Mandy (Amanda E Nixon), in 1961.

<doc id="673526" wikidata="Q810903" url="?curid=673526" title="Batting (cricket)">
<text>In cricket, batting is the act or skill of hitting the ball with a bat to score runs and prevent the loss of one&#x27;s wicket. Any player who is currently batting is, since September 2021, officially referred to as a batter regardless of whether batting is their particular area of expertise. Historically, &quot;batsman&quot; and &quot;batswoman&quot; were used, and these terms remain in widespread use. Batters have to adapt to various conditions when playing on different cricket pitches, especially in different countries; therefore, as well as having outstanding physical batting skills, top-level batters will have quick reflexes, excellent decision-making skills, and be good strategists.

During an innings two members of the batting side are on the pitch at any time: the one facing the current delivery from the bowler is called the striker, while the other is the non-striker. When a batter is out, they are replaced by a teammate. This continues until the end of the innings, which in most cases is when 10 of the team members are out, whereupon the other team gets a turn to bat.

Batting tactics and strategy vary depending on the type of match being played as well as the current state of play. The main concerns for the batters are not to lose their wicket and to score as many runs as quickly as possible. These objectives generally conflict—to score quickly, risky shots must be played, increasing the chance that the batter will be dismissed, while the batter&#x27;s safest choice with a careful wicket-guarding stroke may be not to attempt any runs at all. Depending on the situation, batters may abandon attempts at run-scoring in an effort to preserve their wicket, or may attempt to score runs as quickly as possible with scant concern for the possibility of being dismissed. Unlike various other bat-and-ball sports, cricket batters may hit the ball in any direction to score runs, and can use creative shots to do so.

As with all other cricket statistics, batting statistics and records are given much attention and provide a measure of a player&#x27;s effectiveness. The main statistic for batting is a player&#x27;s batting average. This is calculated by dividing the number of runs they have scored by the number of times they have been dismissed (not by the number of innings they have played).

Don Bradman is widely regarded as the greatest batter of all time, and he set many batting records during his career in the 1930s and 1940s which remain unbeaten. He achieved a career Test average of 99.94, 38 more than any other batter. Sachin Tendulkar set many modern-day batting records, including being the first player to score 100 international centuries across all three formats of the game. Brian Lara holds the record for the highest individual score in a first-class match (501 not out), and in a Test innings, with 400 not out. Mithali Raj is widely regarded as the greatest batter of all time in women&#x27;s cricket. She set many modern-day records, including being the highest run-scorer in women&#x27;s international cricket.

==Terminology==
Any player, regardless of their area of special skill, is referred to as a &quot;batter&quot; (historically as a &quot;batsman&quot; or &quot;batswoman&quot;) while they are batting. The batter&#x27;s act of hitting the ball is called a &quot;shot&quot; or &quot;stroke&quot;. A player who is selected for the team mainly for their batting skill is often referred to as simply a batter, regardless of whether they are currently batting, or sometimes as a specialist batter. A specialist bowler or wicket-keeper, on the other hand, would only be referred to as a batter when they are actually batting.

In 2021 the Laws of Cricket were amended to officially use the term &quot;batter&quot; for gender neutrality, and this is increasingly the preferred term in some media outlets.

==Orthodox technique and stroke play==
Over time a standard batting technique has been developed which is used by most batters. Technique refers to the batter&#x27;s stance before the ball is bowled as well as the movement of the hands, feet, head, and body in the execution of a cricket stroke. Good technique is characterized by quickly getting into the correct position to play the shot, especially getting one&#x27;s head and body in line with the ball, one&#x27;s feet placed next to where the ball would bounce and then swinging the bat at the ball to make contact at the precise moment required for the particular stroke being played.

The movement of the batter for a particular delivery depends on the shot being attempted. Front-foot shots are played with the weight on the front foot (left foot for a right-hander) and are usually played when the ball is pitched up to the batter, while back-foot shots are played putting the weight onto the back foot, usually to bowling that is pitched short. Shots may also be referred to as vertical or straight-bat shots, in which the bat is swung vertically at the ball (e.g. when playing a drive or leg glance), or horizontal or cross-bat shots, in which the bat is swung horizontally at the ball (e.g. when playing the pull or cut shot).

While a batter is not limited in where or how they may hit the ball, the development of good technique has gone hand in hand with the development of a standard or orthodox cricket shots played to specific types of deliveries. These &quot;textbook&quot; shots are standard material found in many coaching manuals.

The advent of limited overs cricket, with its emphasis on rapid run-scoring, has led to increasing use of unorthodox shots to hit the ball into gaps where there are no fielders. Unorthodox shots are typically—but not always—more high-risk than orthodox shots due to some aspects of good batting technique being abandoned.
===Stance===
The stance is the position in which a batter stands to have the ball bowled to them. An ideal stance is &quot;comfortable, relaxed and balanced&quot;, with the feet apart, parallel and astride the crease. Additionally, the front shoulder should be pointing down the wicket, the head facing the bowler, the weight equally balanced and the bat near the back toe. A slight crouch is adopted in order to be in a more effective striking posture whilst also isometrically preloading the muscles; this allows the stroke to be played more dynamically. As the ball is about to be released, the batter will lift their bat up behind in anticipation of playing a stroke and will shift their weight onto the balls of their feet. By doing this they are ready to move swiftly into position to address the ball once they see its path out of the bowler&#x27;s hand.

Although the textbook, side-on stance is the most common, a few international players, such as Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Steve Smith, use an &quot;open&quot; or &quot;square on&quot; stance.

===Backlift===

Backlift is how a batter lifts his bat in preparation for hitting the ball. While the bat should be raised as vertically as possible, coaching manuals often suggest that correct technique is for the bat to be slightly angled from the perpendicular; a common instruction is to point the face of the bat in the direction of first or second slip. Some players (notably, in recent times, Brian Lara, Virender Sehwag) have employed an exaggerated backlift. Others, who have employed the more unorthodox open stance, such as Peter Willey, had a more abbreviated backlift.

===Forward and back===
Depending upon the path of the ball, the batter will either move forward or back in his attempt to intercept it. A forward movement is designated a front foot shot, whereas a backward movement is designated a back foot shot. A front foot shot is typically used to address a ball arriving at between ankle and thigh height. The batter will step forward towards the ball, bending their front knee to bring the bat down to the anticipated height of the ball. By moving forward, the batter is also able to intercept the ball immediately after it has pitched, thus nullifying any potentially dangerous lateral movement. A back foot shot is typically used to address a ball arriving at between thigh and head height. The batter will step back and, if necessary, stand on their tiptoes to raise the bat to the height of the ball. By stepping back towards the wicket, the batter also receives the advantage of having an extra small amount of time to react to any unexpected lateral movement or variation in bounce.

==Cricket shots==

===Vertical-bat strokes===

Vertical-bat or straight-bat shots can be played off either the front foot or the back foot depending upon the anticipated height of the ball at the moment it reaches the batter. The characteristic position of the bat is a vertical alignment at the point of contact. Vertical-bat shots are typically played with the batter&#x27;s head directly above the point of contact so he is able to accurately judge the line of the ball. At this point, the bat can either be stationary and facing straight back down the wicket – known as a block or defensive shot; angled to one side – known as a glance or deflection; or travelling forwards towards the bowler – known as a drive.

====Defensive shot====
A block stroke is usually a purely defensive stroke designed to stop the ball from hitting the wicket or the batter&#x27;s body. This shot has no strength behind it and is usually played with a light or &quot;soft&quot; grip (commentators often refer to &quot;soft hands&quot;) and merely stops the ball moving towards the wicket. A block played on the front foot is known as a forward defensive, while that played on the back foot is known as a backward defensive. These strokes may be used to score runs, by manipulating the block to move the ball into vacant portions of the infield, in which case a block becomes a &quot;push&quot;. Pushing the ball is one of the more common ways batters manipulate the strike.

Leaving and blocking are employed much more often in first-class cricket (including Test matches), as there is no requirement to score runs as quickly as possible, thus allowing the batter to choose which deliveries to play.
A leg glance is a delicate straight-batted shot played at a ball aimed slightly on the leg side, using the bat to flick the ball as it passes the batter, and requiring some wrist work as well, deflecting towards the square leg or fine leg area. The stroke involves deflecting the bat-face towards the leg side at the last moment, head and body moving inside the line of the ball. This shot is played &quot;off the toes, shins or hip&quot;. It is played off the front foot if the ball is pitched up at the toes or shin of the batter, or off the back foot if the ball bounces at waist/hip height to the batter. Although the opposite term off glance is not employed within cricket, the concept of angling the bat face towards the offside to deflect the ball away from the wicket for the purpose of scoring runs through the off side is a commonly used technique. This would commonly be described instead as &quot;running (or steering) the ball down to the third man&quot;.

=====Leave=====

The leave is sometimes considered a cricket shot, even though the batter physically does not play at or interfere with the ball as it passes him. The leave is often used by a batter during the first few balls he receives, to give himself time to judge the conditions of the pitch and the bowling before attempting to play a shot. Leaving a delivery is a matter of judgement and technique. The batter still has to watch the ball closely to ensure that it will not hit him or the wicket; he also has to ensure that his bat and hands are kept out of the path of the ball so that it cannot make accidental contact and possibly lead to him being out caught. Batters only leave the ball when they are certain that it will not hit the stumps.

====Straight Drive====

A drive is a straight-batted shot, played by swinging the bat in a vertical arc through the line of the ball, hitting the ball in front of the batter along the ground. It is one of the most common shots in a batter&#x27;s armory and often the first shot taught to junior cricketers. Depending on the direction the ball travels, a drive can be a cover drive (struck towards the cover fielding position), an off drive (towards mid-off), straight drive (straight past the bowler), on drive (between stumps and mid-on) or square drive (towards point). A drive can also be played towards midwicket, although the phrase &quot;midwicket drive&quot; is not in common usage. Drives can be played both off the front and the back foot, but back-foot drives are harder to force through the line of the ball. Although most drives are deliberately struck along the ground to reduce the risk of being dismissed caught, a batter may decide to play a lofted drive to hit the ball over the infielders and potentially even over the boundary for six.

====Flick====

A flick shot is a straight-batted shot played on the leg side by flicking a full-length delivery using the wrists. It is often also called the clip off the legs. The shot is played with the bat coming through straight as for the on drive, but the bat face is angled towards the leg side. It can be played both off the front foot or the back foot, either off the toes or from the hips. The shot is played between the mid-on and square leg region. Typically played along the ground, the flick can also be played by lofting the ball over the infield.

===Horizontal-bat shots===

The second class of cricket stroke comprises the horizontal-bat shots, also known as cross-bat shots: the cut, the square drive, the pull, the hook, and the sweep. Typically, horizontal bat shots have a greater probability of failing to make contact with the ball than vertical bat shots and therefore are restricted to deliveries that are not threatening to hit the stumps, either by dint of being too wide or too short. The bat is swung in a horizontal arc, with the batter&#x27;s head typically not being perfectly in line with the ball at the point of contact.

====Cut====
A cut is a cross-batted shot played at a short-pitched ball, placing it wide on the off side. The batter makes contact with the ball as it draws alongside or passes him and therefore requires virtually no effort on his part as he uses the bowler&#x27;s pace to divert the ball. A square cut is a shot hit into the off side at near to 90 degrees from the wicket (towards point). A late cut is played as or after the ball passes the batter&#x27;s body and is hit towards the third man position. The cut shot is typically played off the back foot but is also sometimes played off the front foot against slower bowling. The cut should be played with the face of the bat rolling over the ball to face the ground thus pushing the ball downwards. A mistimed cut with an open-faced bat (with the face of the bat facing the bowler) will generally lead to the ball rising in the air, giving a chance for the batter to be caught.

====Square drive====
Although confusingly named a drive, the square drive is actually a horizontal bat shot, with identical arm mechanics to that of the square cut. The difference between the cut and the square drive is the height of the ball at contact: the cut is played to a ball bouncing waist high or above with the batting batter standing tall, whereas the square drive is played to a wide ball of shin height with the batter bending his knees and crouching low to make contact.

====Pull and hook====

A pull is a cross-batted shot played to a ball bouncing around waist height by swinging the bat in a horizontal arc in front of the body, &quot;pulling&quot; it around to the leg side towards mid-wicket or square leg. The term hook shot is used when the shot is played against a ball bouncing at or above chest high to the batter, the batter thus &quot;hooking&quot; the ball around behind square leg, either along the ground or in the air. Pull and hook shots can be played off the front or back foot, with the back foot being more typical.

====Sweep====

A sweep is a cross-batted front foot shot played to a low bouncing ball, usually from a slow bowler (However, players like Mal Loye also play the sweep against fast bowlers), by kneeling on one knee, bringing the head down in line with the ball and swinging the bat around in a horizontal arc near the pitch as the ball arrives, &quot;sweeping&quot; it around to the leg side, typically towards square leg or fine leg. A paddle sweep shot is a sweep shot in which the ball is deflected towards fine leg with a stationary or near-stationary bat extended horizontally towards the bowler, whereas the hard sweep shot is played towards square leg with the bat swung firmly in a horizontal arc. Typically the sweep shot will be played to a legside delivery, but it is also possible for a batter to sweep the ball to the leg side from outside off stump. Attempting to sweep a full straight delivery on the stumps is generally not recommended because of the risk of lbw.

===Unorthodox strokeplay===
Since a batter is free to play any shot to any type of delivery as he wishes, the above list is by no means a complete list of the strokes that batters choose to play. Many unorthodox, typically high-risk, shots have been used throughout the history of the game. The advent of limited overs cricket has seen the increased use of unorthodox shots to hit the ball into gaps where there are no fielders placed. Unorthodox shots are rarely used in first-class cricket as the pace of the game is slower and it is relatively more important to keep one&#x27;s wicket than to try to score runs off every ball.

A few unorthodox shots have gained enough popularity or notoriety to have been given their own names and entered common usage.

==== Reverse sweep ====
A reverse sweep is a cross-batted sweep shot played in the opposite direction to the standard sweep, thus instead of sweeping the ball to the leg side, it is swept to the off side, towards a &quot;backward point&quot; or &quot;third man&quot;. The batter may also swap his hands on the bat handle to make the stroke easier to execute. The batter may also bring his back foot to the front, therefore, turning the shot into a switch-hit and making it more like a traditional sweep. The advantage of a reverse sweep is that it effectively reverses the fielding positions and thus is very difficult to set a field to. It is also a risky shot for the batter as it increases the chance of lbw and also is quite easy to &quot;top edge&quot; to a fielder.

It was first regularly played in the 1970s by the Pakistani batter Mushtaq Mohammad, though Mushtaq&#x27;s brother Hanif Mohammad is sometimes credited as the inventor. Cricket coach Bob Woolmer has been credited with popularising the stroke. The most famous example of a reverse sweep backfiring was in the case of Mike Gatting of England against Allan Border of Australia in the 1987 Cricket World Cup Final. With England on course for victory, Gatting attempted a reverse sweep off the first delivery bowled by Border, top-edged the ball and was caught by wicketkeeper Greg Dyer. England subsequently lost momentum and eventually lost the match.

Because of the unorthodox nature of hand and body position, it is often difficult to get a lot of power behind a reverse sweep; in many situations, the intention is to glance or cut the ball to the back leg area. However, on rare occasions, players have been able to execute reverse sweeps for a six. Kevin Pietersen, who pioneered switch-hitting, is adept at this, but one could argue that the resulting shot is basically a sweep rather than a reverse sweep. A more classic example of such a shot would be Yusuf Pathan&#x27;s six off Robin Peterson. South Africa&#x27;s AB de Villiers is well known for his ability to hit sixes with the reverse sweep at ease and Glenn Maxwell also often plays the reverse sweep.

====Slog and slog sweep====
A slog is a powerful pull shot played over mid-wicket, usually, hit in the air in an attempt to score a six. A shot would be referred to as a slog when it is typically played at a delivery that would not ordinarily be pulled. A slog can also be described as hitting the ball to &quot;cow corner&quot;. This phrase is designed to imply that the batter is unsophisticated in their stroke play and technique by suggesting they would be more at home playing on more rudimentary cricket fields in which there may be cows grazing along the boundary edge. The slog can be an effective shot because all the batter&#x27;s power and body weight can be put into swinging the bat at the ball.

A slog sweep is a slog played from the kneeling position used to sweep. Slog sweeps are usually directed over square-leg rather than to mid-wicket. It is almost exclusively used against reasonably full-pitched balls from slow bowlers, as only then does the batter have time to sight the length and adopt the kneeling position required for the slog sweep. The front leg of the shot is usually placed wider outside leg stump to allow for a full swing of the bat.

====Upper cut====
An upper cut is a shot played towards &quot;third man&quot;, usually hit when the ball is pitched outside the &quot;off stump&quot; with an extra bounce. It is a dangerous shot which can &quot;edge&quot; the ball to keeper or slips if not executed correctly. The shot is widely used in modern cricket. The shot is advantageous in fast bouncy tracks and is seen commonly in Twenty20 cricket. Notable players to hit upper cut include Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag and Brendan Taylor.

====Switch hit====

A switch hit is a shot where a batter changes their handedness and posture to adopt a stance the mirror image of their traditional handedness while the bowler is running in to bowl. As a fielding team cannot manoeuvre fielders while the bowler is in their run-up, the fielding side is effectively wrong-footed with the fielders out of position. The shot was pioneered by Kevin Pietersen, first performed off the bowling of Muttiah Muralitharan in England&#x27;s 2006 home series against Sri Lanka. It was subsequently used in the New Zealand series in England in 2008 when Pietersen performed the shot twice in the same over against Scott Styris on his way to making an unbeaten century. David Warner, the Australian opener, is also a frequent user of the switch hit and used it to great effect against the Indian off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin in the first Twenty20 of the Indian cricket team&#x27;s tour to Australia 2012. Glenn Maxwell and Ben Stokes also play the switch hit.

The legality of the switch hit was questioned when first introduced but cleared by the International Cricket Council as legal. The shot is risky because a batter is less proficient in the other handedness and is more likely to make a mistake in the execution of the shot.

====Scoop / ramp====

A scoop shot has been used by a number of first-class players. It is played to short-pitched straight balls that would traditionally be defended or, more aggressively, pulled to the leg side. To play a scoop shot, the batter is on the front foot and aims to get beneath the bounce of the ball and hit it directly behind the stumps, up and over the wicket-keeper.

This shot, though risky in the execution, has the advantage of being aimed at a section of the field where a fielder is rarely placed – particularly in Twenty20 and One Day International cricket where the number of outfielders is limited. However, the Marillier shot is played over the batter&#x27;s shoulder to fine leg, but the basis of the scoop stroke is for the batter to go down on one knee to a good length or slightly short-of-length delivery off a fast or medium paced bowler and scoop the ball over the head of the wicket-keeper. The scoop shot is a risky shot to play as the improper execution of this shot may lead to a catch being offered. A version of the scoop stroke called the &quot;Dilscoop&quot; was developed by Sri Lankan right-handed batter Tillakaratne Dilshan during the 2009 ICC World Twenty20.

====Helicopter shot====

The helicopter shot is the act of hitting the ball by means of a wristy flick, using the bottom-hand as the dominant force. The shot gets its name from the flourish completing the stroke, with the bat being circled overhead. It has been considered an unconventional and innovative stroke which, when hit executed effectively, can be used to score boundaries, even against good yorkers or fuller-length deliveries, which have traditionally been used by faster bowlers towards the end of limited-overs matches because it is difficult to hit such balls to the boundary. The shot got its fame through MS Dhoni, who played it on a regular basis as a way to score boundaries against full and yorker length deliveries.

====French cut====
The French cut is a stroke where the ball is hit with the inside edge of the bat, meaning it is directed between the batter and the stumps, and moves away in the direction of the fine leg fielding position. The stroke is very difficult to play intentionally, and is more often a mistake by the batter. It is a risky stroke, and can easily result in the batter playing on to their stumps, resulting in the batter being dismissed as bowled.

==Strategy of batting==

The fundamental aim of each batter is to find a means of safely scoring runs against each bowler he faces. To do this, the batter must take into consideration the bowler&#x27;s strategy, the position of the fielders, the pitch conditions, and his own strengths and weaknesses. The strategy he will decide on will incorporate a number of preconceived attacking responses to the various deliveries he may anticipate receiving, designed specifically to score runs with minimal risk of being dismissed. The success of this strategy will be dependent upon both the accuracy of its conception and the technical ability with which it is carried out. A key aspect of the strategy of batting is the trade-off between the level of aggression (trying to score) and the risk involved of being dismissed. An optimal batting strategy balances several considerations: the number of wickets left, the target that has been set (if batting last) and how the risk of losing a wicket increase when increasing the strike rate. These strategies depend on the match situation and on the match format. Strategies therefore vary greatly between the three forms of international cricket: Test, One Day International and T20 cricket.

===Test cricket===
In Test cricket, the usual aim is to score as high a total as possible. As the overs are unlimited, a batter can take his time to score runs. In general, 90 overs have to be bowled per day in Test match cricket. The openers or the starting players in Test cricket are often chosen for their sound technique and ability to defend their wicket, because the first 1–2 hours of an innings, especially if it begins in the morning, are usually characterized by good conditions for bowling, specifically in terms of the pace and bounce of the pitch and the lateral movement of the ball in the air.

The first-drop batter is usually also chosen for his sound technique, so as to stabilize his end in case an opener gets out. The middle order of a batting team in Test matches usually includes its most skilled batters in terms of shot-playing ability, because during the middle overs of a day batting is relatively easier than in the initial stages of the innings. If the batting innings of a team begins after the last half-hour of the day, the team might employ a nightwatchman to bat after a dismissal.

The &quot;nightwatchman&quot; is usually a lower-order player, able to protect his wicket primarily by defending dangerous balls and leaving non-dangerous ones rather than looking to produce a large number of runs for his team, but not a complete rabbit, liable to expose other players late in a day. This move prevents a regular players from having to face the last few overs left in the day or bat early the following morning; however, some teams do not employ &quot;nightwatchmen&quot; for various reasons, including a belief that middle-order player should be able to protect their wicket in poor conditions as well as good, or a lack of defensively minded lower-order batters.

In the third innings, the batting team may score quickly to set a large target to the opposition. This scenario usually occurs on the fourth day&#x27;s play. The batting captain decides how many overs he is prepared to allow the opposition to chase the batting team&#x27;s total in their fourth innings. The captain usually declares his team&#x27;s innings at a predetermined time on the fourth day so they can bowl at least 20 overs on that day and 90 overs on the last day. A good number of overs to bowl at the opposition team in the fourth innings is essential because usually on the fourth and fifth days of a Test match conditions are good for bowling (especially slow bowling), with the pitch having experienced a fair degree of wear and tear. Thus, to make the target as difficult as possible, the batting side speeds up the run rate (runs per over) until the captain declares.

If, however, a batting team is significantly behind the opposition in terms of runs going into the fourth day of a Test match, a typical strategy by the batting team involves playing defensively to avoid losing their wickets. This ensures that they occupy the most time until the match draws to a close on the fifth day, because if a team&#x27;s innings does not end on the fifth day then the match is &quot;drawn&quot;, or a stalemate is reached. However, in trying to do so, if the batting team manages to overhaul its deficit and gain a substantial &quot;lead&quot; (an excess of runs) over the opposition, the captain may consider declaring the innings so they can &quot;force&quot; a victory on the final day, depending on the size of the lead, the readiness of the bowlers, and the state of the pitch.

===One-Day International cricket===
As One Day International matches have a limited set of overs, batters try to score quickly. Doing so, batters should aim for a higher run rate than the one which would maximize their expected personal score. It is optimal for batters to take the risk of being dismissed and being replaced by another teammate. This higher risk strategy makes the best of the limited number of overs. Scoring quickly typically means trying to score at least one run per ball bowled. Most batter manage to score at an average of four runs an over (i.e. four runs in the six ball over). 
The optimal level of risk should vary depending on different factors. It should be higher when the team has more wickets left as they provide of a cushion of security (against the risk of ending all out). It should be higher when the pitch provides good conditions for batting, making it easier to score without great risk of being dismissed. It should increase towards the end of the innings when the number of overs left is small (there is not much to lose in taking the risk of ending all out). Research has shown that teams broadly follow these principles. A noticeable exception is when batters face the possibility of scoring a personal milestone (e.g. century), in that case, they tend to decrease their risk-taking below what is optimal for the team in order to increase their chance of reaching the milestone.

When a team goes out to bat, the best players bat first. The first three batters (number 1, 2, 3) are known as the &quot;top order&quot;; the next four (numbers 4, 5, 6 and possibly 7) form the &quot;middle order&quot;, and the last four (numbers 8, 9, 10 and 11) are the &quot;lower order&quot; or &quot;tail&quot;.

The specialist batters of a team usually bat near the top of the order, so as to score more runs. The &quot;openers&quot; or opening batter are the first two players to take the crease. They are not necessarily the best batters, but are expected to negotiate the new ball and not lose wickets until the shine on the ball is considerably diminished (a hard and shiny ball bounces and swings more and is more difficult for the batter to face). In addition, they are supposed to play quick innings (more runs in fewer balls), reflecting the fact that the fielding side is subject to restrictions on the placement of fielders in the first 15 overs which makes it easier to score runs. In a recent amendment to the rules of ODI cricket, fielding captains are given mandatory fielding restrictions for the first 10 overs and then two chunks of 5 overs each, also known as &quot;power-play&quot; overs, which they may impose at any stage of their choice within the stipulated 50 overs.

Following the openers is the No. 3 or &quot;first-drop&quot; batter. Their job is to take over from the openers and typically play a careful and prolonged innings, effectively tying up one end of the batting. This brings in some stability in the batting, as new batters find it difficult to settle down and it helps to have a settled player at the other end. The best batter of the team is usually put at number 3 or 4, to protect them from the difficulties of batting against the best bowlers on a fresh pitch and to allow them to play long innings.

The middle order is often considered the most valuable asset of a batting line-up in One-Day Internationals because its members are responsible for consolidating the batting team&#x27;s position through the middle part of the 50 overs. Characteristic of middle-order batting is the practice of taking many &quot;singles&quot; (or &quot;ones&quot;) and &#x27;twos&#x27;, with only the occasional &quot;boundary&quot; (a four or a six), as opposed to the more flamboyant openers who score primarily in boundaries. This is because the fielding restrictions on the opposition are lifted in the middle overs so that the percentage of boundaries scored decreases. Middle-order players are often chosen for the ability to run hard and fast between the wickets (to maximize the number of runs not scored from boundaries) and for their endurance and patience. 
The middle order typically sets the stage for an aggressive assault on the bowling in the final 10 overs of the match. 
To achieve this assault, two things are necessary – a number of hard-hitting players yet to bat or not out and a number of wickets in hand (since aggression means a greater likelihood of losing wickets). The last 10 overs of a one-day cricket match innings is often the most exciting part of the innings, because of a large number of boundaries scored and wickets taken. During the last ten overs of an ODI, batters often use shots that are riskier than shots played at the beginning of the innings.

Examples of risky shots include the reverse sweep and the paddle-scoop. These shots are used to achieve a boundary which would not be possible when playing a safer, more orthodox shot. Finally, the lower order consists of the bowlers of the team, who are not known for their batting prowess and so bat as low down the order as possible.

However, there are no real restrictions to the batting positions. Captains have been known to experiment with the batting line-up to gain specific advantages. For example, a lower-order player is sometimes sent in at number 3 with instructions to &quot;pinch-hit&quot; (playing aggressively in an attempt to score more runs in fewer balls – a term borrowed from baseball) to score quick runs and shield better players, as their wicket (as a less accomplished, lower-order, player) is less valuable anyway.

== Running between the wickets ==
When batting, a batter has to balance opportunities to score runs by running between the popping creases with the risk of being run out (or even stumped, if batting outside his crease). Batting partners must agree on each run they take, or else one of them is likely to be out of their ground and thus run out.

Sometimes batters take risks by running even when the fielder has the ball in hand, and is in a position to throw the ball at the wicket; this is known as &quot;taking on the arm of the fielder&quot;. This can occasionally lead to overthrows.

Batters often slide headfirst with their bat outstretched to make their ground. Being able to run faster to score more runs, as well as improve endurance so as to not be fatigued by running a lot throughout a long innings (which could disrupt the concentration or strength needed for batting), is part of the athletic training for batters.

<text>Balto ( – March 14, 1933) was an Alaskan husky and sled dog belonging to musher and breeder Leonhard Seppala. He achieved fame when he led a team of sled dogs driven by Gunnar Kaasen on the final leg of the 1925 serum run to Nome, in which diphtheria antitoxin was transported from Anchorage, Alaska, to Nenana, Alaska, by train and then to Nome by dog sled to combat an outbreak of the disease. Balto&#x27;s celebrity status, and that of Kaasen&#x27;s, resulted in a two-reel motion picture, a statue in Central Park, and a nationwide tour on the vaudeville circuit.

A falling out between Seppala and Kaasen resulted in Balto and his teammates being sold under disputed circumstances to a traveling circus operator and ultimately housed in squalor at a dime museum in Los Angeles. When news stories emerged in February 1927 about his poor living conditions, a two-week fundraising effort in Cleveland, Ohio, led to the successful purchase of Balto and his team by the citizenry of Cleveland. Balto lived in ease at the Brookside Zoo until his death on March 14, 1933, at the age of 14; his body was subsequently mounted and displayed in the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, where it remains to this day. While the subject of numerous cultural depictions and homages, including a 1995 animated film, Balto&#x27;s role in the serum run remains controversial as contemporary media coverage focused almost entirely on him over the efforts of the other mushers and dogs—most notably, Seppala and his lead dog Togo—and has more recently undergone historical reappraisals.

== Life ==
=== Early years ===
Little is known about Balto&#x27;s early years. Balto&#x27;s birth year is commonly recognized as 1919, in Nome, Alaska, at the kennels of Leonhard Seppala, a native Norwegian, sled dog breeder, musher and competitive racer. He was named after Samuel Balto, a Sámi who was part of Fridtjof Nansen&#x27;s exploration of Greenland in 1888, and whom Seppala admired. No birth records were kept for Balto or his litter as his body type did not align with other racing huskies that Seppala was breeding. The only evidence of Balto&#x27;s birth year came from later interviews with Seppala. With a largely black fur coat, Balto had a small, stocky build, unique for a Siberian husky.

Believing Balto to be &quot;second rate&quot; and not holding much potential, Seppala neutered him at six months of age. He considered him a &quot;scrub dog&quot;, unable to run as fast as his other dogs, who were derisively called &quot;Siberian rats&quot; by mushers against whom Seppala competed. Seppala claimed in his memoir to have &quot;given [Balto] every chance&quot; to ride with his primary sled dog team &quot;but could not qualify&quot;; thus, Balto was relegated to haul freight and large cargo for short runs and was part of a team that pulled railcars with miners over a disused railroad. Gunnar Kaasen, another native Norwegian and a close family friend of Seppala with 21 years&#x27; dog sledding experience, came to know Balto through his work at Seppala&#x27;s mining company. Kaasen believed Seppala misjudged Balto&#x27;s potential and that the dog&#x27;s short stature could allow him to be more strong and steady.

=== The serum run ===
In January 1925, doctors realized that a potentially deadly diphtheria epidemic was poised to sweep through the young people of Nome, Alaska, placing the city under quarantine. Dr. Curtis Welch, the primary physician in Nome, transmitted via Morse code that the town&#x27;s existing serum, which was over six years old, was being depleted. Additional serum was made available in Anchorage, but the territory&#x27;s only two usable aircraft had open cockpits and were thus grounded for the winter. After considering all the alternatives, officials decided to have the serum ferried via multiple dog sled teams over the &quot;Seward-to-Nome Trail&quot;. The serum was transported by train from Anchorage to Nenana, where the first musher embarked as part of a relay. More than 20 mushers took part, facing a blizzard with temperatures and strong winds. Originally projected to arrive in Nome by February 6, the date was moved up several times as the teams repeatedly broke land speed records. News coverage of the event, in particular the hazards posed to the dogs and the leaders, was relayed worldwide; newspaper headlines read; &quot;Relief Nears Nome!&quot;, &quot;Dog Teams in Race with Death in Far North&quot; and &quot;Seppalla ... May Save Diphtheria Victims&quot;.

As the serum run progressed, additional teams were recruited as Alaskan governor Scott Cordelle Bone worried about Seppala&#x27;s team experiencing fatigue. Kaasen was appointed to drive a team of Seppala&#x27;s dogs originally set aside for company business during the run, with Fox chosen by Seppala as the leader. Kaasen, however, chose Balto to co-lead alongside Fox, a move Seppala later disagreed with as he felt Balto was not worthy to be a lead dog. Balto had been largely untried as a sled dog prior to the run, but Kaasen expressed confidence in Balto&#x27;s abilities and likely identified with him. The serum package was handed to Kaasen by Charlie Olson in Bluff at 10:00 p.m. on February 1. The blizzard quickly began to bear down on the team, causing them to become lost and confused. This prompted Kaasen to move Balto to the lead, yelling at him, &quot;Go home, Balto.&quot; Balto&#x27;s ability to pull heavy freight allowed him to steadily navigate the team through the storm; at one point, Balto stopped in front of a patch of ice on the Topkok River that broke underneath him, saving Kaasen&#x27;s life along with the entire team. Kaasen suffered frostbite after his sled flipped and the serum package fell into the snow, forcing him to search bare-handed for it.

Kaasen and his team arrived in Point Safety ahead of schedule, but found the last team of the run was not ready and the roadhouse they lodged in was dark. Ed Rohn, the leader of this final team, was asleep at the time under the impression Kaasen had been halted in nearby Solomon, a settlement Kaasen rode past without visibly recognizing due to the poor weather. Kaasen decided not to wake him up and continue on, knowing it would take time for Rohn to prepare and risk putting additional dogs in harm&#x27;s way. Despite suffering from exposure and exhaustion, Kaasen and Balto traveled the remaining to Nome, and arrived at Front Street on February 2, 1925, at 5:30 a.m. While frozen solid, all 300,000 units of the antitoxin were intact, and Kaasen handed them over to be thawed for use by midday. Four of Kaasen&#x27;s dogs were partially frozen when they arrived; one newspaper dispatch erroneously stated Balto and the majority of the team died several days later from frozen lungs, and was immediately retracted shortly after publication. Seppala reached Nome two days later and praised Kaasen for having continued on through blizzard conditions.

Kaasen gave all credit to Balto, telling a United Press reporter, &quot;I gave Balto, my lead dog, his head and trusted to him. He never once faltered ... [i]t was Balto who led the way, the credit is his.&quot; After reaching Dr. Welch&#x27;s office to deliver the serum, Kaasen tended to Balto, hugging him and purportedly repeating, &quot;Damn fine dog ... damn fine dog.&quot; On the U.S. Senate chamber floor several days later, Washington Senator Clarence Dill recognized the efforts of everyone who helped with the serum run but cited Balto in particular, saying, &quot;[t]his black Siberian dog, through the darkness and storm, crossed this icy desert and kept the trail when no human being could possibly have found the way.&quot; The H. K. Mulford Company, one of the manufacturers of the serum units, awarded Kaasen a $1,000 prize () alongside inscribed medals which were given to all the mushers.

=== Post-race fame: movies, statues, vaudeville and sale to a sideshow ===
Newspapers were heralding the feats achieved during the serum run almost exclusively to Balto, eclipsing the efforts of the 18 other mushers and 150 sled dogs who participated. The death toll in Nome was seven people—not counting Alaskan Natives who were not recorded—adding further to the media sensation as the diphtheria epidemic was seemingly averted. When the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; published exclusive photos of Kaasen&#x27;s arrival in Nome, Balto was pictured directly in the foreground of the entire team; these photos were later revealed to be staged recreations hours after Kaasen arrived. The recent adoption of radio in the contiguous United States also meant dispatches from Nome had been relayed to radio stations throughout the country. As 1925 ended, Balto was credited in news coverage as having accomplished the entire serum run by himself, a misconception that persisted long after his death.

Film producer Sol Lesser promptly signed Kaasen, Balto and the team of &quot;thirteen half wolves&quot; to a contract with Educational Pictures for a movie based on the serum run. Film production began in April 1925 in Los Angeles. Upon arriving in the city, Balto was the recipient of the &quot;bone of the city&quot; by the mayor of Los Angeles, along with other dignitaries including actress Mary Pickford. The two-reel movie, &quot;Balto&#x27;s Race to Nome&quot;, debuted the following month to positive reviews; it is now considered a lost film. Shortly after the film&#x27;s release, Kaasen sued Lesser for unpaid wages; Lesser then sold the existing contract to the vaudeville circuit. Kaasen and Balto soon traveled across the country, making public appearances and being bestowed gifts from the cities visited. In one instance, while visiting Cleveland, Ohio, Kaasen was awarded a subscription to &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; as a gift from an existing subscriber, to be delivered to his home in Nome.

A statue of Balto, sculpted by Frederick Roth, was erected in New York City&#x27;s Central Park on December 17, 1925, ten months after Balto&#x27;s arrival in Nome. Balto modeled in front of Roth and was present for the monument&#x27;s unveiling. The statue is located on the main path leading north from the Tisch Children&#x27;s Zoo. In front of the statue, a low-relief slate plaque depicts Balto&#x27;s sled team and bears the inscription, &quot;[d]edicated to the indomitable spirit of the sled dogs that relayed antitoxin six hundred miles over rough ice, across treacherous waters, through Arctic blizzards from Nenana to the relief of stricken Nome in the winter of 1925: endurance, fidelity, intelligence&quot;.

Seppala had been &quot;amazed and vastly amused&quot; at Balto and Kaasen&#x27;s celebrity statuses, but was displeased as it overlooked his lead dog Togo, who went through the run&#x27;s longest and most dangerous part. Seppala made a similar cross-country tour with Togo and his teammates in 1926, including a gala ice-rink appearance at Madison Square Garden, believing that Togo had been deprived of fame and acclaim. Before relocating to Poland Spring, Maine, in March 1927, Seppala claimed Fox was the actual leader of Kaasen&#x27;s team and failed to get any proper credit due to Fox&#x27;s name being more common and would not stand out in newspaper headlines like Balto. A February 1932 interview Seppala had with Henry McLemore furthered this, claiming a newspaper reporter simply chose Balto as &quot;the lead dog ... that brought the serum in&quot; after multiple names were offered by Seppala; as he was still riding to Nome with Togo at the time, this is likely anachronistic. The &quot;Vaccine Research Association&quot; unsuccessfully called for the Central Park statue&#x27;s removal in 1931, citing a 1929 interview where Seppala claimed all the dramatic events surrounding the run were fabricated to sell newspapers. Unwilling to show disrespect to a sled dog, Seppala partly backtracked from these claims in his memoir:

After the dispute with Lesser was resolved, Balto and his teammates were sold to Sam Houston, owner of a traveling circus. The exact circumstances for the sale are unclear: some accounts, including Houston himself, claimed Kaasen sold the dogs after tiring of the constant traveling and moved back to Alaska. Other accounts claimed Seppala made the deal with Houston and ordered Kaasen—who was still under his employ at the Pioneer Mining Company—back to Alaska. Seppala claimed in his memoir that he sold the dogs to Lesser, with Balto selling for much more &quot;on account of the publicity given to his &#x27;glorious achievements&#x27;&quot;. Kaasen and Seppala never spoke to each other again. Kaasen&#x27;s departure occurred after the Central Park statue unveiling; upon returning to Nome one year after the run, he found himself alienated by residents of Nome over his fame, with some expressing resentment over the bypassing of Ed Rohn. By May 1947, Seppala dismissed the serum run as little more than &quot;just an ordinary hard run&quot; and Balto&#x27;s fame as &quot;a product of modern publicity rather than of outstanding merit ... Balto was just a good average dog&quot;.

=== Cleveland fundraising effort and purchase ===
Balto and his team continued on tour throughout much of 1926 under the ownership of Sam Houston in both his circus and theatre circuits. By February 1927, stories emerged of Balto and six teammates living in the back room of a &quot;for men only&quot; dime museum in Los Angeles, also described as a freak show. After leaving the vaudeville circuit, Balto and his team briefly resided at a farm, only to be taken back to the city after misbehaving and entering a chicken coop. Balto and his teammates were displayed chained to a sled, with their only exercise consisting of brief trips in the museum&#x27;s back alley. They were malnourished, with their ribs showing. Jack Wooldridge of the &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; wrote about the mistreatment, &quot;[t]here probably was never a more dejected, sorrowful looking lot of malamutes than these as they now appear. Balto will never see the snow again. He&#x27;s simply an exhibit in a museum.&quot;
Cleveland businessman George Kimble visited the dime museum while in Los Angeles after noticing a sign outside advertising &quot;Balto the wonder dog&quot;. Outraged at seeing Balto and his teammates in poor health, Kimble offered to buy the dogs from Sam Houston, who was willing to sell, but demanded $2,000 (), more than Kimble could personally afford. Kimble reached out to area businessmen and elected officials, along with &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot;, and assembled the Cleveland Balto Committee led by Common Pleas Judge James B. Ruhl, which negotiated with Houston. After Houston agreed to sell the dogs for $1,500, a fund raising campaign was formally announced in the March 1, 1927, &quot;Plain Dealer&quot;, and the Brookside Zoo promised to create lodging for the dogs. Raising $200 on the campaign&#x27;s first day, a ten-day option was obtained, and the dogs were temporarily relocated to a ranch as a foster home. The &quot;Plain Dealer&quot; carried daily tallies of donations to the campaign. Donations came from all over the city, with Cleveland schoolchildren dropping loose change in buckets and offering their milk money; along with children, bank employees, offices and nonprofit institutions all making donations. Within four days, the committee grew from seven members to seventeen. Area kennel clubs, shops and hotels also made contributions.

Appeals to donate were broadcast over radio stations WDBK, WHK and WTAM, along with stations in Detroit and elsewhere; one response came from Japan after a listener there heard an appeal over WJZ in New York by long-distance reception. Three models for the William Taylor &amp; Son department store were driven around downtown Cleveland promoting the campaign. The Los Angeles Alaskan Society subsequently offered to buy the team if the $2,000 could not be raised in time by the Cleveland effort, as the ten-day option had been publicized in the &quot;Los Angeles Daily Times&quot;. By the evening of March 8, $1,517 had been raised, prompting one last-minute appeal by the &quot;Plain Dealer&quot;; the following morning, the fund surpassed the $2,000 goal, totaling $2,245.88 () and securing the purchase of the entire seven-dog team. The effort won the praise of Roald Amundsen, who compared it to the city of Oslo adopting the lone surviving dog from his expedition to the South Pole. A &quot;Plain Dealer&quot; editorial on the campaign&#x27;s success read, &quot;[t]he city which honors a worthy dumb animal honors itself. Cleveland looks forward to welcoming its Alaskan guests a few days hence and hopes their life here may be long and pleasant.&quot;
Balto and his six teammates—Alaska Slim, Fox, Tillie, Billie, Old Moctoc and Sye—were transported by train from Los Angeles to Cleveland along with identification papers; arriving March 16, the dogs were escorted to temporary quarters at Brookside Zoo. A grand parade took place at the Public Square on March 19, 1927, which the city designated as &quot;Balto Day&quot;. Despite rainy conditions, thousands of people were present as the team pulled a sled modified with iron wheels making it navigable on cobblestone streets and streetcar tracks; two local Boy Scout troops carried signs announcing Balto&#x27;s arrival and a map of the serum run, while five local people were &quot;sourdough&quot; escorts. In the rotunda of Cleveland City Hall, Judge Ruhl read a deed of gift that transferred ownership of Balto and his team to the city &quot;forever&quot;. After the parade, the dogs were all transported to a more permanent housing at the zoo.

=== Later years ===
Balto and his teammates made their formal debut at the Brookside Zoo on March 20, 1927, with estimates of up to 15,000 people visiting the zoo that day. Even with his permanent residence at the zoo, Balto occasionally made public appearances, including at an exhibition hosted by the Western Reserve Kennel Club in which Balto won &quot;best of show&quot; honors. Balto also made an appearance at a parade for the 1929 National Air Races.

Owing to the Brookside Zoo&#x27;s location in a valley, the team would pull sleds during winter weather conditions; one snowfall in early January 1928, turned the zoo&#x27;s boulevard into an icy trail, with Balto and Fox alternating lead. The &quot;Plain Dealer&quot; occasionally anthropomorphized their depictions of Balto at the zoo, including an encounter with a visiting husky and his owner from Manitoba. Another 1929 story centered around his &quot;daydreaming&quot; of Richard E. Byrd&#x27;s expedition of Antarctica; this resulted in multiple letters to the editor that criticized the enclosure and were concerned about the welfare of the dogs. One letter expressed regret for contributing to &quot;Balto to Cleveland&quot; fund as &quot;one of the most inhuman acts we could have performed&quot;. One letter written decades later recalled visiting the zoo on a hot day, with Balto tied to a tree in front of a water pan &quot;with a few drops of water in it&quot;. Even with these criticisms, the conditions at the zoo were generally seen as &quot;excellent&quot;. Zoo staff frequently sprayed the dogs to discourage fleas, their steam-heated kennel had a purpose-built shower for nightly cleaning, and the dogs had a respectable diet of meat in the morning, nightly dog biscuits and plentiful access to water. Zoo superintendent John Kramer defended their treatment of the dogs, particularly with Fox, saying &quot;people don&#x27;t understand why we do certain things here... you can&#x27;t please them all.&quot;

Another enclosure meant for the summer months was built for the dogs in 1930. This enclosure included a bronze tablet on top of a granite monument located in front of Balto&#x27;s cage. Bearing the names of the entire seven-dog team, the monument was intended as a shrine for all animal lovers of Greater Cleveland. The dogs lived out the remainders of their lives at the zoo: Billie was the first to die, followed by Fox. Between 1930 and 1933, Alaska Slim, Tillie and Old Moctoc all died, with Balto and Sye the only members in the team remaining.

=== Death, mounting and display ===
Balto died on March 14, 1933, at the age of 14. News of Balto&#x27;s declining health was published four days earlier, having lost his sight and suffering decreased mobility and paralysis. Because of his advanced age, the city&#x27;s veterinarian and zoo personnel estimated he would not be able to survive the week. Balto&#x27;s death was attributed to both an enlarged heart and bladder, the former as a result of stress incurred from the serum run. The following day, the Cleveland Museum of Natural History (CMNH) agreed to display Balto in taxidermy form. Balto&#x27;s mounting cost $50 () and was again raised through a fund-raising campaign; the process included the placement of Balto&#x27;s skin and fur over a lifelike form as an effigy, a process that was finished by that May. Balto&#x27;s thyroid and adrenal glands were preserved at the Cleveland Clinic in George Washington Crile&#x27;s organ collection.

Sye, the last of the seven dogs, was reportedly crestfallen over Balto&#x27;s death, moaning, howling, and refusing to eat. Sye died on March 25, 1934, one year after Balto, and was the only dog of the group to sire offspring. As was the case with Balto, Sye&#x27;s remains were mounted for display by the zoo, initially displayed over the zoo&#x27;s tiger enclosure. By 1965, neither the zoo or CMNH could locate the remains of Sye, which are now presumed lost. Sye, Balto and Togo were the only three dogs that participated in the serum run to have had their remains mounted. The monument that was erected at the zoo for the dogs, retroactively regarded as a gravestone, was taken out of public display after Balto died. As other zoo buildings were subsequently erected on the site of the former enclosure for Balto&#x27;s team, the exact site of the graves for Billie, Fox, Moctoc, Slim and Tillie are now unknown.

Initially displayed, then placed in storage for several years, Balto was again put on public display in March 1940, coinciding with a dog show taking place at the Public Auditorium. Displays of Balto were intermittent in the years since, with his remains placed in cold storage at all other times. CMNH had so many animals in their collection that it became difficult to display Balto with greater frequency; in 1975, the &quot;Plain Dealer&quot; noted Balto&#x27;s absence as the 50th anniversary of the serum run approached, prompting CMNH to arrange an exhibition. By 2000, CMNH centered Balto around exhibits about the serum run and Inuit people, making his visibility permanent; wildlife resources director Harvey Webster said, &quot;he&#x27;s an icon ... [the serum run is] a story about the remarkable confluences of men and dogs who did the seemingly impossible in short order.&quot;

As part of a larger $150 million renovation project, Balto&#x27;s remains were refurbished and reinstalled in CMNH&#x27;s new Visitor Hall, which opened on October 15, 2023. Balto is among the museum&#x27;s eight most iconic specimens that are represented in the Hall.

=== Return visits to Alaska ===
In early 1998, 22 second and third-grade students at Butte Elementary School in Palmer, Alaska, began a letter and petition drive to return Balto to Alaska after student Cody McGinn did a book report and discovered his remains were in Cleveland. Teacher Dwight Homstad viewed Balto&#x27;s custody as a two-sided issue and that the students wanted to show the emotional attachment Alaskans still had toward Balto. Alaskan governor Tony Knowles endorsed the effort, writing to Homstad&#x27;s class, &quot;During a time of great need in Alaska&#x27;s history, Balto persevered through treacherous and perilous conditions to save the lives of many Alaskans.&quot; Homstad also contracted for a shipping crate to be transported to CMNH containing the petitions and a video made of the students writing the petitions. By July 1998, the Alaska State Legislature passed a formal proclamation supporting Balto&#x27;s return to Alaska. Homstad also offered the idea of a trade or barter with CMNH for Balto.

CMNH declined both the requests for a permanent return or of shared custody (the latter McGinn advocated for) citing Balto&#x27;s purchase by the people of Cleveland, that Balto spent 60 percent of his life in Cleveland, and the fragile condition of his remains; one taxidermist estimated that, if properly cared for, a mounted specimen like Balto&#x27;s can last for up to two lifetimes. Despite the initial refusal, the effort was soon publicized internationally with coverage in both &quot;People&quot; and CNN; one museum trustee learned of the dispute while on vacation in Indonesia. CMNH announced in August 1998 that Balto would be loaned to the Anchorage Museum of History and Art, who paid substantial money to insure his mount, for six months. The Anchorage Museum previously sought to have Balto displayed in an exhibit tied to the 1988 Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race and were in negotiations with CMNH earlier in the year about a loan. Balto was placed in a special crate for the trip to Anchorage with the label &quot;Contents: One Hero Dog&quot;, and a CMNH curator was present at the museum for the exhibition&#x27;s duration.

A second exhibition of Balto took place at the Anchorage Museum between March and May 2017; again, a CMNH registrar accompanied Balto, who was placed in a climate-controlled crate on the flight to Alaska. Balto and Togo were displayed side-by-side as part of the 2017 exhibit.

=== Controversy, rivalries and reevaluation ===

Controversy continues to surround Balto&#x27;s celebrity status. Mushers have placed doubt on claims Balto truly led Kaasen&#x27;s team, based primarily on his prior track record. No records exist of Seppala ever having used him as a leader in runs or races prior to 1925, and Seppala himself stated Balto &quot;was never in a winning team&quot; and was a &quot;scrub dog&quot;. The pictures and film of Kaasen and Balto in Nome were recreated hours after their arrival once the sun had risen. Speculation still exists as to whether Balto&#x27;s position as lead was genuine or staged for media purposes due to Balto being a more newsworthy and appealing name than Fox. One 1927 newspaper editorial published after Seppala&#x27;s claim that Fox actually led Kaasen&#x27;s team read, &quot;[w]hether &#x27;Balto&#x27; or &#x27;Fox&#x27; matters little. The performance stands and the nation-wide emotion which it aroused is recorded in history. Somebody else wrote the works of Shakespeare, Homer was not the author of the &quot;Iliad&quot;. The lead dog on that historic trip to Nome was not Balto. What does it matter?&quot; Balto remains more famous to the general public due to the long-held misconceptions about his role. While some historians note it is possible Balto led Kaasen&#x27;s team, he at most likely ran co-lead with Fox rather than running single-lead by himself.

The aftermath of the serum run and the fame awarded to Balto and Kaasen initiated a feud between Seppala, Kaasen and Ed Rohn that lasted for the rest of their lives and has continued to the present day. Decorated mushers and others in the surrounding area—including Rohn, based on conversations the two men had before leaving Nome—believed that Kaasen&#x27;s decision to not wake Rohn at Point Safety was motivated by a desire to grab the glory for himself. Conversely, supporters of Kaasen argue Rohn was inexperienced with mushing in severe weather. Despite being the subject of widespread fame alongside Balto, Kaasen rarely spoke about the run in later years and was reluctant to make public appearances. Other mushers and residents also died without providing a full account of their respective roles, making it unlikely for the facts to ever be known. The contribution of Alaska Natives, whose teams traveled the majority of the run, is also heavily obscured: while contributing to the area economy and the absence of language barriers, reporters and filmmakers were disinterested in their feats. Many of them died prior to the 1970s, when efforts were made to better preserve Alaskan history, and surviving mushers were given honorary &quot;number one&quot; designations in the early years of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

=== Balto vs. Togo ===
The overlooking of Togo in popular culture has come to the displeasure of mushers, some of whom have reared dogs with bloodlines traced directly to Seppala&#x27;s dogs and Togo specifically, something Balto could not do due to being neutered. Historian Jeff Dinsdale viewed the narrative around Balto as &quot;heavily dependent on fantasy [that] evolved&quot; to usurp Togo&#x27;s feats and called Togo &quot;the greatest sled dog of all time, sort of the Gordie Howe of dog sledding&quot;. Writer Kenneth Ungermann argued Balto&#x27;s outsized fame was more a symbol of the feats achieved during the run, writing, &quot;[t]o the American public, the glorified husky was representative of Jack, Dixie, Togo, and every other leader and dog that helped carry the antitoxin and hope to the people of Nome.&quot;

In a 2020 op-ed for the &quot;Anchorage Daily News&quot;, historian David Reamer criticized Balto Seppala Park in Anchorage for fostering &quot;the misconception of Balto as the singular hero dog of Nome&quot; and &quot;[a]ny opportunity is a good opportunity to spread the worthy truth of Togo&quot;; Reamer praised the movie &quot;Togo&quot; for remedying &quot;a historical misjustice&quot;. In ranking the top 10 heroic animals for &quot;Time&quot;, Katy Steinmetz placed Togo at number one, writing, &quot;the dog that often gets credit ... is Balto, but he just happened to run the last ... leg in the race. The sled dog who did the lion&#x27;s share of the work was Togo.&quot; The National Park Service credits Togo for having &quot;led his team across the most dangerous leg of the journey... though Balto received the credit for saving the town, to those who know more than , Balto is considered the backup dog&quot;. CMNH has recognized Togo as &quot;a superb leader... courageous and strong, smart and possessing an exceptional ability to find the trail and sense danger&quot;.

The Cleveland Metroparks Zoo (successor to the Brookside Zoo) unveiled companion statues of Balto and Togo in 1997. In 2001, a statue of Togo was unveiled at Seward Park in New York City&#x27;s Lower East Side, and later moved to a prominent position in the park by 2019; a change.org petition was also launched in late 2019 calling for the removal of Balto&#x27;s Central Park statue in favor of a statue for Togo.

=== Cultural depictions ===
==== Books ====
* Alistair MacLean&#x27;s 1959 novel &quot;Night Without End&quot; includes a sled dog named Balto, a fictional descendant and namesake of the original Balto.
* The 1966 Uncle Scrooge comic book &quot;North of the Yukon&quot; centered around the dog &quot;Barko&quot;, created by Carl Barks as a direct homage to Balto.
* In January 1977, Margaret Davidson wrote &quot;Balto: The Dog Who Saved Nome&quot;, a children&#x27;s book containing a telling of Balto&#x27;s deeds.

==== Film ====
* The 1995 animated feature film &quot;Balto&quot; is loosely based on Balto and the serum run, but is notable for multiple inaccuracies, including depicting Balto as a wolfdog and ending the movie with the Central Park statue unveiling. After Steven Spielberg announced the film was in development through his Amblimation studio, CMNH extended an invitation to him to meet Balto&#x27;s mount, but this request was declined. Two direct-to-video sequels, &quot;Balto II: Wolf Quest&quot; and &quot;Balto III: Wings of Change&quot;, were later released but contained no historical references.
* The 2019 movie &quot;Togo&quot; centers around Leonhard Seppala and Togo, with Balto getting a brief appearance. Unlike past depictions, Togo&#x27;s contributions, including completing the serum run&#x27;s longest and most perilous stretch, are highlighted, and it is made clear Balto got most of the credit.
* &quot;The Great Alaskan Race&quot;, also released in 2019 and written/directed by Brian Presley, focuses primarily on Seppala&#x27;s role but also depicts the heroics of both teams, along with Balto and Togo individually. During production, the film&#x27;s cast and crew visited Balto&#x27;s Central Park statue.

==== Television ====
* The episode &quot;Welcome Home, Balto&quot; of the PBS Kids series &quot;Molly of Denali&quot; centers around protagonist Molly Mabray learning about Balto&#x27;s story and being inspired to create a statue of him.

== Genome sequencing ==

Balto&#x27;s DNA was analyzed and sequenced as part of the Zoonomia Project, an international collaboration that has mapped the genomes of over 240 mammals. After being approached by Cornell University associate professor Heather Huson about including Balto in Zoonomia, CMNH agreed and sent a skin sample to University of California, Santa Cruz professor Katherine Moon. CMNH chief science officer Gavin Svenson was enthusiastic about the project and noted advancements in technology have since made it easier to map out genomes from 100-year old DNA. Compared with the genomes of 682 modern-day dogs and wolves, in addition to the 240 mammals in Zoonomia, Balto&#x27;s genome was found to be more diverse with fewer unhealthy variants than modern purebred dogs and more similar to today&#x27;s Alaskan huskies often outcrossed to promote better fitness and health.

Balto shared part of his ancestry with modern Siberian huskies (39 percent) as well as Greenland dogs (18 percent), Chinese village dogs (17 percent), Samoyeds (6 percent) and Alaskan malamutes (4 percent). Balto had several DNA adaptations that promoted Arctic survival, including a thick double coat, the ability to digest starch, and bone and tissue development. Researchers were also able to accurately predict how Balto would have looked—fur coat color, eyes and fur thickness—from his surviving DNA, which was cross-referenced with historical photos and his remains. Testing also disproved the urban legend that Balto had grey wolf genetics; Moon said, &quot;[h]e was not a wolf, he was just a good boy.&quot;

<text>PS 184M Shuang Wen School (), a public school in New York City also known as PS 184 (), is a Dual Language elementary and middle school located in Lower Manhattan. The school teaches students from Pre-Kindergarten to 8th grade. It is a part of the New York City Department of Education and located in Manhattan District 1 which includes the Lower East Side and East Village. A major $1.7 million renovation of the school playground and soccer field was completed in 2019 by the Trust for Public Land and DEP. In the elementary school, the school teaches in Traditional Chinese and utilizes the zhuyin phonetic system popular in Taiwan. During the typical school day, one day is taught in English and other day is in Mandarin. As a Dual Language school, classes in both languages are a mandatory part of the curriculum.

== History ==
Upon opening in 1998, the school was described as a new type of school, and one of the first English-Mandarin bilingual schools in the country. Because this school defies some stereotypes about race, wealth, and educational achievement, this school has been written about in the newspaper and television media. While up to 70% of students have family incomes low enough to qualify for free lunch, many receive support from parents and school to excel on citywide tests and maintain near-perfect school attendance. While the school has consistently high test scores, until around 2011 the school was embroiled in scandals regarding fees, admissions and the integrity of parent reviews.

The eighth graders of 2007 were the first graduating class of Shuang Wen. The first graduating class consisted of two eighth grade class (about 40-50 students in total). In prior years, the graduating classes took a graduation trip to China, but the last class to go was the graduating class of 2010. The second graduating class trip caused some controversy and was reported on China&#x27;s television channel, CCTV.

==Afterschool==
After dismissal from public school, students may choose to enroll in either free or fee-based on-site after-school programs provided by a number of different non-profit organizations, or to participate in programs offered elsewhere. Afterschool programs include debate club, chess club, soccer, volleyball, and community service club. In some after-school programs, students may continue to learn how to speak, write, and read Mandarin Chinese for extra-curricular enrichment.

=== Shuang Wen Academy Network ===
For many years, from 1996 until 2018, the after-school and summer dual language English-Chinese program was run by the Shuang Wen Academy Network (SWAN), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization whose mission is the &quot;development of proficiency in Mandarin Chinese, and a greater understanding of Chinese culture, so participants can become better global citizens in an increasingly competitive and demanding international environment.&quot; During the period that SWAN provided the after-school program, the program earned a Federal Blue Ribbon Award, demonstrating program excellence and positive impacts as assessed by the No Child Left Behind Act. Over 70% of the students served by SWAN&#x27;s programming came from economically disadvantaged families. SWAN was founded by Jacob Wong, a retired principal and Chairperson of the New York Chinese Educators Committee, and other members of Chinatown. SWAN began its first after-school Chinese Immersion Program with a class of 40 students in 1998. Initially, the SWAN after-school program was mandatory for all PS184 Shuang Wen students and free of charge, funded initially by grants. This changed in 2009, when parents were charged $600 and the program was made optional. However, the school sent a letter threatening to leave children unsupervised in the cafeteria if they didn&#x27;t pay. The fee was later refunded once funding to the program became available. In 2010, the program raised the fee to $1,000. Beginning in 2011, SWAN&#x27;s summer program began to enroll students from a number of different schools. Despite the school&#x27;s claim that the program was no longer mandatory, parents complained that students couldn&#x27;t succeed in the regular school hours without the after school program due to the lack of Mandarin education during the regular school day. Parents complained that the school constantly asked for more money. This, among other issues, prompted an investigation by New York City schools as to whether these afterschool tuition fees were legal. In 2018, SWAN&#x27;s afterschool and summer programs moved out of the PS184m Shuang Wen School building to a number of different locations.

== Admissions ==
In prior years, admission was by lottery to the dual language Chinese program. Admissions priority was given to the school&#x27;s local area, known as District 1. Despite high numbers of black and Hispanic students in this district, the school consistently had an 80% Asian make-up. In addition, the black portion of the student body dropped from 10% in 2002 to 5% in 2009. Critics claimed the school was admitting Asian students outside the proper process while discouraging black and Hispanic students from attending. In addition, reports stated that blacks and Hispanics left the school due to widespread racism.

Nowadays, as with all NYC public schools, applications are handled by a centralized process at NYC DOE. As part of a school diversity initiative that started in 2018, admissions priority for elementary school students at PS184m goes to &quot;applicants living in temporary housing, who are English Language Learners, and/or eligible for Free and Reduced Lunch (based on family income) for a percentage of seats based on the applicant pool. Students who do not fall into any of these groups will get a priority for the remaining percentage of offers.&quot;

Over the last ten years, the PS184 population of Asian students has decreased from around 80% to 69%, and the second largest ethnic group among students is Hispanic or Latino (11%). There are more than thirty public schools in District 1, where the overall student demographic is: 42% Hispanic or Latino, 22% Asian, 18% white, 15% Black or African-American, 3% Multi-Racial, 1% Native American (2018).

==Statistics==

In 2008 the US Department of Education awarded Shuang Wen the Blue Ribbon Award of Excellence. The city received straight As on its city report card in 2010. Contributing to the school&#x27;s reputation for dual language and academic excellence, SWAN provided after-school programming to PS184 Shuang Wen for many years during which time the school was ranked one of the highest performing public schools in New York City, so in 2011:

*Reading scores: 83.5%
*Math scores: 97.7%
*Enrollment: 683
*Attendance: 99%
*Free lunch: 78%
*Overcrowding: 64%
*Admissions: unzoned; priority to District 1
*Ethnicity: 8% White, 5% Black, 5% Hispanic, 80% Asian (2011)
From 2012 through 2019, PS184 Shuang Wen school continued to rank consistently among the top schools in New York State, while continuing to serve a majority low-income population.

In 2019, in the midst of a controversial proposal by Mayor de Blasio to implement a &quot;top 7%&quot; quota system to distribute seats for selective SHSAT highschools more widely across New York city, among those PS184 Shuang Wen students who participated in the competitive NYC SHSAT entrance exam, 40% received an offer to one of the specialized highschools. One of the most popular high school choices for Shuang Wen school graduates is Brooklyn Technical High School.

He also appeared in the films &quot;Gerald&#x27;s Game&quot; (2017) and &quot;Doctor Sleep&quot; (2019).

==Early life==
Struycken was born on 30 July 1948 in The Hague. When he was 4 years old, his family moved to Curaçao in the Netherlands Antilles. There, at age 15, he composed several Caribbean waltzes. At 16, he returned to his home country, where he finished secondary school. He graduated from the directing program at the film school in Amsterdam. After that, he spent a year at the American Film Institute, in Los Angeles.

== Career ==

In 1978, Struycken was discovered as an actor at the corner of Hollywood and Vine in Los Angeles by a woman who had abandoned her car in the middle of the street, calling after him: &quot;We need you for a movie!&quot;. The film was &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;.

Struycken played Terak in the 1985 TV film &quot;&quot;, a spin-off to the original Star Wars trilogy.

Struycken appeared as Fidel, Jack Nicholson&#x27;s manservant, in the 1987 film &quot;The Witches of Eastwick&quot;. That same year, he appeared as Mr. Homn in &quot;Haven&quot;, an episode of the television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, a role he would reprise in four more episodes until 1992.

In 1991, he starred as butler Lurch in the feature film &quot;The Addams Family&quot;. He reprised the role in the 1993 sequel, &quot;Addams Family Values&quot;, and the TV film &quot;Addams Family Reunion&quot;.

Struycken collaborated on several projects with writer and director Rene Daalder, including the 1986 punk rock musical &quot;&quot;, which featured Tomata du Plenty, of The Screamers, and which was released on DVD in October 2008.

== Personal life ==

At age 20, he was diagnosed with acromegaly, which explains his tall height of 2.13 m (7 feet) and distinctive facial features.

His next regular role in a series came as Steve Hale on the sitcom &quot;Full House&quot; from 1991 to 1995 after he had guest-starred on one episode during its fifth season as the similarly named Steve Peters. During the run of &quot;Full House&quot;, Weinger made his motion-picture debut as the voice of Aladdin in Disney&#x27;s 1992 animated feature of the same name.

Weinger went on to several small roles in television programs, starred in a horror comedy film, 2003&#x27;s &quot;Shredder&quot;, and provided his voice for Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s &quot;Metropolis&quot; and the 3D Disney film &quot;Mickey&#x27;s PhilharMagic&quot;. He had a guest appearance on the NBC&#x27;s &quot;Scrubs&quot; for the season 6 episode &quot;My Coffee&quot; as Dr. Kershnar. He played Officer Rubin on &quot;What I Like About You&quot;. From 2016 until 2020, Weinger reprised his role of Steve Hale on the &quot;Full House&quot; spin-off series &quot;Fuller House&quot;.

Weinger was cast as Aladdin, the street urchin in Walt Disney Pictures&#x27; animated feature film of the same name. He reprised his role multiple times off the big screen including the CBS television series and direct-to-video sequels &quot;The Return of Jafar&quot; and &quot;Aladdin and the King of Thieves&quot;. His voice would also be used for several video games including the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series, &quot;Kinect Disneyland Adventures&quot;, and Disney Infinity series.

Weinger has written and produced for television, receiving his first writing credit on the WB television show &quot;Like Family&quot;. Other writing credits include &quot;What I Like About You&quot; and &quot;Privileged&quot;. From 2009 to 2013, he was a writer-producer for &quot;90210&quot;, penning the series&#x27; 100th episode. After the series ended, he returned to comedy, becoming a writer-producer for &quot;The Neighbors&quot;, &quot;Galavant&quot;, &quot;Black-ish&quot;, and &quot;The Muppets&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Weinger has been married to television writer and producer Rina Mimoun since 2008; together they have a son who was born in 2009.

<doc id="673548" wikidata="Q7644868" url="?curid=673548" title="Supreme Court cases of the American Civil War">
<text>A number of cases were tried before the Supreme Court of the United States during the period of the American Civil War. These cases focused on wartime civil liberties, and the ability of the various branches of the government to alter them. The following cases were among the most significant.

==Pre-war==
* &quot;Ex parte Bollman&quot; (1807) was an early case that made many important arguments about the power of the Supreme Court, as well as the constitutional definition of treason.
* &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot; (1857) Dred Scott, a slave owned by a Dr. Emerson, was taken from Missouri to a free state and then back to Missouri again. Scott sued, claiming that his residence in a free territory granted him freedom. In a 7–2 vote, the Supreme Court decided that Congress did not have the power to prohibit slavery in the territories, making the already repealed Missouri Compromise of 1820 unconstitutional. Furthermore, the Court went on to state that blacks were not citizens of the United States and could not become citizens and therefore they could not sue in a court.

==During the war==
* &quot;Ex parte Merryman&quot; (1861) was actually not a Supreme Court case, although it was heard by then-Chief Justice Roger Taney (see circuit riding). Taney protested Lincoln&#x27;s secret notice granting military personnel the power to suspend the writ of habeas corpus. This case is an example of a U.S. President ignoring a court&#x27;s ruling on the grounds of necessity.
* In &quot;Ex parte Vallandigham&quot; (1863), a former congressman was tried before a military tribunal by General Ambrose Burnside for treason after he delivered an incendiary speech at Mount Vernon. A writ of certiorari brought the case to the Supreme Court under Chief Justice Roger Taney. The court avoided disagreement with the President or military by arguing that since the extra-legal tribunals were, unsurprisingly, not listed in any documents enumerating courts over which the Supreme Court had authority, Vallandigham had no grounds for appeal. &quot;Ex parte Metzger&quot; was used as precedent.

==Post-war==
* In &quot;Ex parte Milligan&quot; (1866), the Supreme Court led by Chase ruled that, so long as local civilian courts are open, citizens may not be tried by military tribunals. It further observed that, during the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, citizens may only be &quot;held&quot; without charges, not &quot;tried&quot;, and certainly may not be executed by military tribunals.
* In &quot;Texas v. White&quot; (1869), the Court held in a 5–3 decision that Texas had remained a state of the United States ever since it first joined the Union, despite its joining the Confederate States of America and its being under military rule at the time of the decision in the case. It further held that the Constitution did not permit states to secede from the United States, and that the ordinances of secession, and all the acts of the legislatures within seceding states intended to give effect to such ordinances, were &quot;absolutely null.&quot; However, this decision did allow some possibility of divisibility &quot;through revolution, or through consent of the States.&quot;

<doc id="673555" wikidata="Q685594" url="?curid=673555" title="Second-degree atrioventricular block">
<text>Second-degree atrioventricular block (AV block) is a disease of the electrical conduction system of the heart. It is a conduction block between the atria and ventricles. The presence of second-degree AV block is diagnosed when one or more (but not all) of the atrial impulses fail to conduct to the ventricles due to impaired conduction. It is classified as a block of the AV node, falling between first-degree (slowed conduction) and third degree blocks (complete block).

== Signs and symptoms ==
Most people with Wenckebach (Type I Mobitz) do not show symptoms. However, those that do usually display one or more of the following:
* Light-headedness
* Dizziness
* Syncope (fainting)

==Types==
There are two non-distinct types of second-degree AV block, called &quot;Type 1&quot; and &quot;Type 2&quot;. In both types, a P wave is blocked from initiating a QRS complex; but, in Type 1, there are increasing delays in each cycle before the omission, whereas, in Type 2, there is no such pattern.

Type 1 second-degree heart block is considered more benign than type 2 second-degree heart block. The type 1 does not have structural changes found on histology.

Both types are named after Woldemar Mobitz. Type I is also named after Karel Frederik Wenckebach, and type II is also named after John Hay.

===Type 1 (Mobitz I/Wenckebach)===
Type 1 Second-degree AV block, also known as Mobitz I or Wenckebach periodicity, is almost always a disease of the AV node. Wenckebach published a paper in 1906 on progressively lengthening PR intervals that was later classified as Type I in Mobitz&#x27;s 1924 paper. Thus, both &quot;Mobitz type I&quot; and &quot;Wenckebach block&quot; refer to the same pattern and pathophysiology.

In Wenckebach&#x27;s 1906 paper, his original observations were of increasing delay in contraction of the atria and ventricles that shortened after a brief pause. He later observed this in the electrocardiogram (ECG) after Einthoven&#x27;s 1901 invention. In modern practice, Mobitz I heart block is characterized by progressive prolongation of the PR interval on consecutive beats followed by a blocked P wave (i.e., a dropped QRS complex). After the dropped QRS complex, the PR interval resets and the cycle repeats. This grouped beating was described as &quot;Luciani periods&quot; after Luigi Luciani&#x27;s work in 1873. The result is a lengthening of the R-R intervals as each subsequent P-wave reaches an increasingly refractory AV node until the impulse fails to conduct, which ultimately results in a blocked QRS complex. A blocked P-wave may not be present under some circumstances, such as coexisting sinoatrial block.

One of the baseline assumptions when determining if an individual has Mobitz I heart block is that the atrial rhythm has to be regular. If the atrial rhythm is not regular, there could be alternative explanations as to why certain P waves do not conduct to the ventricles.

Mobitz I heart block is almost always a benign condition for which no specific treatment is needed for the rhythm itself. It can be seen in myocardial ischemia, propranolol use, digitalis use, rheumatic fever, and chronically in ischemic heart disease and other structural diseases (amyloidosis, mitral valve prolapse, aortic valve disease, and atrial septal defect). In symptomatic cases, intravenous atropine or isoproterenol may transiently improve conduction.

===Type 2 (Mobitz II/Hay)===
Type 2 Second-degree AV block, also known as Mobitz II, is almost always a disease of the distal conduction system (His-Purkinje System).

Mobitz II heart block is characterized on a surface ECG by intermittently non-conducted P waves not preceded by PR prolongation and not followed by PR shortening. There is usually a fixed number of non-conducted P waves for every successfully conducted QRS complex, and this ratio is often specified in describing Mobitz II blocks. For example, Mobitz II block in which there are two P waves for every one QRS complex may be referred to as 2:1 Mobitz II block.:181

The medical significance of this type of AV block is that it may progress rapidly to complete heart block, in which no escape rhythm may emerge. In this case, the person may experience a Stokes-Adams attack, cardiac arrest, or sudden cardiac death. The definitive treatment for this form of AV Block is an implanted pacemaker.

The impairment is usually below the AV node. Although the terms infranodal block or infrahisian block are often applied to this disorder, they refer to the &quot;anatomic location&quot; of the block, whereas Mobitz II refers to an &quot;electrocardiographic pattern&quot;.

===P:QRS ratios===

Because type I Mobitz block occurs in regular cycles, there is always a fixed ratio between the number of P waves and the number of QRS complexes per cycle. This ratio is often specified when describing the block. For example, a Mobitz type I block which has 4 P waves and 3 QRS complexes per cycle may be referred to as 4:3 Mobitz Type I block.:179

Type II Mobitz block also usually occurs with a fixed P:QRS ratio, with a set number of P waves for every successfully elicited QRS.:179 This ratio is also frequently specified in referring to 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, or higher Mobitz type II block. Higher numbers of P waves for every QRS indicate more severe block:181 and ratios of 3:1 and above are also referred to as &quot;High Grade&quot; AV Blocke60. Of course, because type II Mobitz block is unstable by nature, it is common for the P:QRS ratio in Mobitz type II block to change over time.

The P:QRS ratio is always of the form &quot;X&quot;:(&quot;X&quot; − 1) in type I Mobitz block.

===2:1 AV block===

In the case of 2:1 block (2 P waves for every QRS complex) it is impossible to differentiate type I from type II Mobitz block-based solely on the P:QRS ratio or on a pattern of lengthening PR intervals.:182 In this case, a lengthened PR interval with a normal QRS width is most likely indicative of a type I-like pathology, and a normal PR interval with a widened QRS is most likely indicative of a type II-like pathology.:182

==History==
The electoral district of Bourassa was created in 1966 from Mercier and Laval ridings. The name comes from a street running through the three neighbourhoods which is named after Henri Bourassa.

The name of the riding was changed to &quot;Montreal—Bourassa&quot; in 1971.

In 1976, Montreal—Bourassa was abolished when it was redistributed into a new &quot;Bourassa&quot; riding and Saint-Michel riding. The new Bourassa riding was created from parts of Montreal—Bourassa, Ahuntsic and Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies ridings.

This riding lost territory to Honoré-Mercier and gained territory from Ahuntsic during the 2012 electoral redistribution.

<text>This is a list of named geological features on [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]], a moon that orbits the planet Saturn. Mimantean features are named after people and places in Arthurian legend or the legends of the Titans. The sole exception to this is Herschel Crater, named after William Herschel, the astronomer who discovered Mimas in 1789. That name was chosen before the International Astronomical Union set a guideline for naming geological features on Mimas.

==Chasms==

Mimas&#x27; chasmata are named after locations in Arthurian legend and the legends of the Titans.

==Craters==

With the exception of Herschel, the craters of Mimas are named after characters in Arthurian legend.

==Crater chains==

Mimas&#x27;s sole named catena is named after a location in Arthurian legend.

<text>General Sir George Brown, (3 July 1790 – 27 August 1865) was a British officer notable for commands in the Peninsular War and the Crimean War.

==Background==
Brown was born the son of George Brown, Provost of Elgin, at Linkwood, near Elgin, Scotland, and educated in Elgin.

==Military career==
He obtained a commission in the 43rd (Monmouthshire) Regiment of Foot (Light Infantry) (later the 1st Battalion, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry) in 1806, and he was promoted to lieutenant a few months later. He saw active service for the first time in the Mediterranean and at Copenhagen, in 1806 and 1807 respectively. The 43rd was one of the earliest arrivals in Spain when the Peninsular War broke out, and Brown was with his regiment at Vimeiro, and in the Corunna retreat. Later in 1809 the famous Light Division was formed, and with Craufurd he was present at all the actions of 1810–1811, being severely wounded at Talavera; he was then promoted captain and attended the Staff College at Great Marlow until (late in 1812) he returned to the Peninsula as a captain in the 85th. With this regiment he served under Major-General Lord Aylmer at the Nivelle and Nive, his conduct winning for him the rank of major.

The 85th was next employed under General Robert Ross in America, and Brown, who received a severe wound at the action of Bladensburg, was promoted to a lieutenant colonelcy. At the age of twenty-five, with a brilliant war record, he received an appointment at the Royal Horse Guards, and remained in London for over twenty-five years in various staff positions. He was made a colonel and Knight of the Royal Guelphic Order in 1831, and by 1852 had arrived at the rank of lieutenant general and the dignity of Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath In 1850 he was appointed Adjutant-General to the Forces, but following the appointment of Lord Hardinge to the post of commander-in-chief, Brown left the Horse Guards in 1853.

In 1854, on the despatch of a British force to the East, Sir George Brown was appointed to command the Light Division. This he led in action, and administered in camp, on Peninsular principles, and, whilst preserving the strictest discipline to a degree which came in for criticism, he made himself beloved by his men. At Alma he had a horse shot under him. At Inkerman he was wounded whilst leading the French Zouaves into action. In the following year, when an expedition against Kertch and the Russian communications was decided upon, Brown went in command of the British contingent. He was invalided home on the day of Lord Raglan&#x27;s death (29 June 1855). He was later promoted general, backdated to 7 September 1855. From March 1860 to March 1865 he was appointed Commander-in-Chief, Ireland and was the colonel-commandant of the 2nd Battalion Rifle Brigade from 1855 to 1863.

Honours included CB in 1838, a KCB in 1852, a GCB in 1855, and a Knight of the Royal Guelphic Order (KH).

He died at his birthplace of Linkwood in 1865.

==Honorary appointments==
*Colonel of the 77th (East Middlesex) Regiment of Foot (1851–1854)
*Colonel of the 7th (Derbyshire) Regiment of Foot (1854–1855)
*Colonel of the 32nd (The Cornwall) Regiment of Foot (Light Infantry) (1863–1865)
*Colonel-in-Chief of The Prince Consort&#x27;s Own Rifle Brigade (1863–1865)

Mount Baxter is on the boundary between Kings Canyon National Park and the John Muir Wilderness just north of Baxter Pass and to the northeast of the Rae Lakes, a popular backpacking destination along the John Muir Trail.

Mount Baxter is named for John Baxter, who was a rancher in the Owens Valley.

The mountain provides habitat for the endangered Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep and was closed to entry in the recent past.

<doc id="673575" wikidata="Q2533936" url="?curid=673575" title="Angular defect">
<text>In geometry, the angular defect or simply defect (also called deficit or deficiency) is the failure of some angles to add up to the expected amount of 360° or 180°, when such angles in the Euclidean plane would. The opposite notion is the &quot;excess&quot;.

Classically the defect arises in two contexts: in the Euclidean plane, angles about a point add up to 360°, while interior angles in a triangle add up to 180°. However, on a convex polyhedron, the angles of the faces meeting at a vertex add up to &quot;less&quot; than 360° (a defect), while the angles at some vertices of a nonconvex polyhedron may add up to &quot;more&quot; than 360° (an excess). Also the angles in a hyperbolic triangle add up to &quot;less&quot; than 180° (a defect), while those on a spherical triangle add up to &quot;more&quot; than 180° (an excess).

In modern terms, the defect at a vertex is a discrete version of the curvature of the polyhedral surface concentrated at that point. Negative defect indicates that the vertex resembles a saddle point (negative curvature), whereas positive defect indicates that the vertex resembles a local maximum or minimum (positive curvature). The Gauss–Bonnet theorem gives the total curvature as formula_1 times the Euler characteristic formula_2, so for a convex polyhedron the sum of the defects is formula_3, while a toroidal polyhedron has formula_4 and total defect zero.

== Defect of a vertex ==
For a polyhedron, the defect at a vertex equals 2π minus the sum of all the angles at the vertex (all the faces at the vertex are included). If a polyhedron is convex, then the defect of each vertex is always positive. If the sum of the angles exceeds a full turn, as occurs in some vertices of many non-convex polyhedra, then the defect is negative.

The concept of defect extends to higher dimensions as the amount by which the sum of the dihedral angles of the cells at a peak falls short of a full circle.

==Examples==

The defect of any of the vertices of a regular dodecahedron (in which three regular pentagons meet at each vertex) is 36°, or π/5 radians, or 1/10 of a circle. Each of the angles measures 108°; three of these meet at each vertex, so the defect is 360° − (108° + 108° + 108°) = 36°.

The same procedure can be followed for the other Platonic solids:
==Descartes&#x27;s theorem==
Descartes&#x27;s theorem on the &quot;total defect&quot; of a polyhedron states that if the polyhedron is homeomorphic to a sphere (i.e. topologically equivalent to a sphere, so that it may be deformed into a sphere by stretching without tearing), the &quot;total defect&quot;, i.e. the sum of the defects of all of the vertices, is two full circles (or 720° or 4 radians). The polyhedron need not be convex.

A generalization says the number of circles in the total defect equals the Euler characteristic of the polyhedron. This is a special case of the Gauss–Bonnet theorem which relates the integral of the Gaussian curvature to the Euler characteristic. Here the Gaussian curvature is concentrated at the vertices: on the faces and edges the curvature is zero (the surface is locally isometric to a Euclidean plane) and the integral of curvature at a vertex is equal to the defect there (by definition).

This can be used to calculate the number &quot;V&quot; of vertices of a polyhedron by totaling the angles of all the faces, and adding the total defect (which is formula_1 times the Euler characteristic). This total will have one complete circle for every vertex in the polyhedron. 

A converse to Descartes&#x27; theorem is given by Alexandrov&#x27;s uniqueness theorem, according to which a metric space that is locally Euclidean (hence zero curvature) except for a finite number of points of positive angular defect, adding to formula_3, can be realized in a unique way as the surface of a convex polyhedron.

==Positive defects on non-convex figures==
It is tempting to think that every non-convex polyhedron must have some vertices whose defect is negative, but this need not be the case if the Euler characteristic is positive (a topological sphere). 

A counterexample is provided by a cube where one face is replaced by a square pyramid: this elongated square pyramid is convex and the defects at each vertex are each positive. Now consider the same cube where the square pyramid goes into the cube: this is concave, but the defects remain the same and so are all positive. 

Two counterexamples which are self-intersecting polyhedra are the small stellated dodecahedron and the great stellated dodecahedron, with twelve and twenty convex points respectively, all with positive defects.

<doc id="673581" wikidata="Q1065187" url="?curid=673581" title="Kenan &amp; Kel">
<text>Kenan &amp; Kel is an American sitcom created by Kim Bass that originally aired on Nickelodeon from August 17, 1996, to May 3, 2000. Set in Chicago, the series follows mischievous Kenan Rockmore (Kenan Thompson) and his happy-go-lucky best friend Kel Kimble (Kel Mitchell), who get involved with zany hijinks on a number of misadventures. The show was one of three spin-offs from &quot;All That&quot;, in which Thompson and Mitchell had co-starred for several years.

The show features Kenan&#x27;s family, which consists of his father Roger (Ken Foree), mother Sheryl (Teal Marchande), and younger sister Kyra (Vanessa Baden). The show also features Kenan&#x27;s boss Chris Potter (Dan Frischman). &quot;Kenan &amp; Kel&quot; features appearances from a number of guest stars, including game show host/radio disc jockey Bob Eubanks, basketball player Ron Harper, and singer Britney Spears.

The series won the &quot;Favorite TV Show&quot; award at the 1998 Kids&#x27; Choice Awards.

The first two seasons were taped at Nickelodeon Studios at Universal Studios Florida. The last two seasons were taped at the now closed theater Nickelodeon on Sunset in Los Angeles, California.

==Premise==
Set in Chicago, Illinois, &quot;Kenan &amp; Kel&quot; follows Kenan Rockmore and Kel Kimble, a pair of high school students who go on various misadventures, which usually occur as a result of Kenan devising a scheme to get rich quick or avoid trouble with his elders. These schemes are often foiled as a result of Kel&#x27;s aloof nature and clumsiness.

The show employs a number of running gags. Episodes open and close with Kenan and Kel breaking the fourth wall by interacting with a studio audience, standing in front of a red curtain that is placed in front of the main set while they are still in character. Usually, they do stuff that relates to the episode itself, for example, in the opening of &quot;The Tainting of the Screw&quot;, Kel is seen wearing fishing gear and showing off a tuna he caught, and the episode is about Kenan choking on a screw that was in his tuna sandwich. A running gag of the openings is Kel never knowing what the night&#x27;s episode would be about and Kenan refusing to tell him, while the closings frequently feature Kenan coming up with a new scheme, often asking Kel to get various assorted items and meet him somewhere. Frazzled both times, Kel exclaims his catchphrase, &quot;Aww, here it goes!&quot; (which both opens and closes the show).

==Production==
&quot;Kenan &amp; Kel&quot; was created by Kim Bass, and stars Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell as the title characters. The actors previously starred in the Nickelodeon series &quot;All That&quot;. Mitchell and Thompson would frequently joke around on the set of &quot;All That&quot;, which caught the attention of producers, including Bass, who wished to package Thompson and Mitchell in a series. During a hiatus of &quot;All That&quot;, the producers kept Thompson and Mitchell so they could tape the pilot for &quot;Kenan &amp; Kel&quot;. Mitchell later expressed fondness working with Thompson on the series. &quot;Kenan &amp; Kel&quot; was Mitchell&#x27;s second professional acting performance, having only worked on &quot;All That&quot; and in amateur theater productions in Chicago beforehand. Thompson&#x27;s previous experience included a role in &quot;D2: The Mighty Ducks&quot; (1994). Kenan is the series&#x27; straight man, and Kel is his comedic foil. The series theme song, &quot;Aw, Here It Goes&quot;, is performed by rapper Coolio.

The first season contains 14 episodes, taped between April and August 9, 1996. The season was taped in front of a studio audience at Nickelodeon Studios in Universal Studios Florida. The characters of Kenan and Kel also make a crossover appearance on the Nickelodeon series &quot;Cousin Skeeter&quot;.

==Broadcast==
In the midst of the series&#x27; initial run, reruns of the series briefly aired on Nickelodeon&#x27;s sister channel, Nick GAS in 1999. After the series finished its run in 2001, reruns continued to air on Nickelodeon from January 21, 2001, to February 15, 2004.

The series then reran daily on The N as part of the &quot;TEENick on The N&quot; block from October 13, 2007, to August 2, 2009. Reruns started airing on the successor channel TeenNick from July 25, 2011, to February 3, 2013, and again from March 4, 2013, to May 31, 2014, as part of its The &#x27;90s Are All That programming block (later called &quot;The Splat&quot;, &quot;NickSplat&quot;, and &quot;NickRewind&quot;). The series airs reruns frequently on Nickelodeon&#x27;s Pluto TV channel and streams on Paramount+ and Netflix.

In the United Kingdom, the series aired on Nickelodeon from 1997 to 2012, and on both BBC One and BBC Two for several years in the late 1990s and early 2000s, as part of the CBBC programming block. The series now reruns on Trace Vault.

==Episodes==

==Home media==
&quot;Kenan &amp; Kel&quot; has been released on DVD in the compilations &quot;Best of Seasons 1 &amp; 2&quot; and &quot;Best of Season 3 &amp; 4&quot;. Both are manufacture-on-demand releases through Amazon.com. Individual seasons are not available. The &quot;Best of Seasons 1 &amp; 2&quot; DVD is missing 3 episodes (&quot;In the Line of Kenan&quot;, &quot;Baggin&#x27; Saggin Kel&quot;, and &quot;&quot;Safe and Sorry&quot;; all from season 1) to complete the set, but season 2 is complete. The &quot;Best of Seasons 3 &amp; 4&quot; DVD is also missing 3 episodes (&quot;The Chicago Witch Trials&quot;, &quot;Freezer Burned&quot;, and &quot;Who Love Who-ooh?&quot;; all from Season 3), but season 4 is complete. These DVD releases are absent of any bonus features.

On July 28, 2011, the first season of &quot;Kenan &amp; Kel&quot; was released on the iTunes Store.
On November 29, 2011, the second season was released. On February 13, 2012, the third season was released. On August 13, 2012, the fourth season was released. Seasons 1 and 2 were released on the UK iTunes store in September 2013. As of 2021, most of the series is available to watch on Paramount+. Seasons 1 and 2 can be found on Netflix, except for &quot;Baggin&#x27; Saggin&#x27; Kel&quot;, &quot;Safe and Sorry&quot;, &quot;Bye Bye, Kenan: Part 1&quot; and &quot;Bye Bye, Kenan: Part 2&quot;.

==Legacy==
In a December 3, 2022, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; comedy sketch, Kenan Thompson, a longtime SNL cast member, appears in a spoof of &quot;Kenan &amp; Kel&quot; called &quot;Kenan &amp; Kelly&quot; with guest host Keke Palmer. In the skit, Palmer explains her desire to reboot &quot;Kenan &amp; Kel&quot; after meeting Thompson and expressing her fondness of him during his Nickelodeon years. The skit is intercut between pseudo-interviews and recreations of the Rigby&#x27;s grocery store set from the original series featuring Thompson, Palmer, and Mitchell. The addition of elements such as Palmer&#x27;s disapproval of the word &quot;idiot&quot; to describe her, her pregnancy reveal, the robbery of Rigby&#x27;s, and the subsequent shooting death of Kel are played for dramatic effect, which Thompson concludes as a reason why the &quot;reboot&quot; failed.

<text>Honoré-Mercier (; formerly Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies) is a federal electoral district in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1988.

Its most recent Member of Parliament was Pablo Rodriguez of the Liberal Party of Canada, who resigned the seat on January 20, 2025.

==Geography==
The district includes the entire Borough of Anjou, the eastern part of the Borough of Rivière-des-Prairies–Pointe-aux-Trembles, and the northern part of the Borough of Mercier—Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.

The neighbouring ridings are Hochelaga, Saint-Léonard—Saint-Michel, Bourassa, Alfred-Pellan, Montcalm, and La Pointe-de-l&#x27;Île.

===Political geography===
While the other eastern Montreal ridings have traditionally been Bloc Québécois strongholds, Honoré-Mercier is politically a very divided riding. Rivière-des-Prairies is very Liberal leaning, while Anjou supports the Bloc for the most part, but has some Liberal pockets.

However, the NDP&#x27;s &quot;orange wave&quot; in the 2011 election overwhelmed previous distinctions, with the New Democrats winning 149 of 218 polling divisions in the district.

==Demographics==
:&quot;According to the 2016 Canadian census&quot;

* Languages: (2016) 51.1% French, 16.2% Italian, 8.1% English, 6.2% Creole, 4.9% Spanish, 4.1% Arabic, 1.4% Portuguese, 1.2% Romanian, 1.0% Kabyle, 0.9% Vietnamese, 0.6% Khmer

==History==
The district was created in 1987 under the name Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies from parts of Gamelin, Montreal—Mercier and Saint-Léonard—Anjou ridings.

It consisted of:
* the Borough of Anjou;
* the parts of the Town of Montréal bounded by:
# Sherbrooke Street East, Duquesne Street, Rosemont Boulevard and Lacordaire Boulevard; and
# Autoroute de la Rive Nord, Henri-Bourassa Boulevard East; the limits of the towns of Montréal-Est, Anjou and Montréal-Nord to the point of commencement.

In 2003, its name was changed to Honoré-Mercier and its boundaries were adjusted slightly such that 95.5% of the riding came from the original Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies, while 4.5% came from Hochelaga—Maisonneuve.

This riding lost territory to La Pointe-de-l&#x27;Île and Hochelaga, and gained territory from Bourassa during the 2012 electoral redistribution.

===Member of Parliament===
This riding has elected the following members of Parliament:

<doc id="673586" wikidata="Q4752653" url="?curid=673586" title="Anchor (brand)">
<text>Anchor is a brand of dairy products that was founded in New Zealand in 1886, and is one of the key brands owned by the New Zealand–based international exporter Fonterra Co-operative Group. In Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan, Fonterra uses the Fernleaf brand instead of Anchor.

== Anchor by Fonterra ==

Historically, the Anchor brand of milk products in New Zealand was owned by the New Zealand Dairy Group, which merged with Kiwi Co Operative in 2001 to form Fonterra. 

As the merger would leave New Zealand with virtually no competition in the domestic dairy sector, government legislation was required for Fonterra to be formed. One of the requirements was that Fonterra must divest its strongest domestic brand, Anchor, in the New Zealand market. This did not affect the brand internationally. The brand was sold to what is currently Goodman Fielder. 

Between 2001 and 2005, Fonterra grew one of their smaller milk brands which was originally only available in the South Island of New Zealand, &#x27;Meadow Fresh Milk&#x27; into a nationwide brand which provided good competition to the Anchor Brand of milk products. In 2005, Fonterra did a brand swap with what is now Goodman Fielder, swapping Meadow Fresh for Anchor, allowing Fonterra to again align its international and domestic dairy brands.

On 11 November 2024, Fonterra confirmed that it would be selling several of its consumer brands including Anchor.

=== Anchor Milk ===
Fresh Anchor Milk products available in New Zealand are manufactured and marketed by Fonterra Brands, a division of Fonterra. The main plant that processes Anchor milk in New Zealand is in Takanini, Auckland.

In addition to the common varieties with differing percentages of milk fat, they also offer &quot;Anchor-Xtra&quot;, with extra calcium (marketed to &quot;extra active&quot; parents), and &quot;Mega Milk&quot;, with extra vitamins, as well as extra calcium, marketed for children. In 2013, the Anchor brand was released in China.

=== Anchor Milk Powder ===
Anchor Milk Powder is the major Anchor product available in some developing countries, such as Guyana and Ethiopia.

=== Anchor Butter and Anchor Cheese ===
Anchor Butter and Anchor Cheese are sold in New Zealand, but the brand for these products in New Zealand is still owned by a Goodman Fielder subsidiary. For butter and cheese the brand was not returned to Fonterra in the brand swap so not all Anchor branded products are Fonterra products in New Zealand.

However, like most dairy products in New Zealand, the milk is still sourced from Fonterra suppliers and for butter and cheese, it is also likely that Fonterra manufactured the products with Goodman Fielder simply packaging the products.

== Outside New Zealand ==
Internationally the Anchor brand is 100% owned by the Fonterra Co-Op Group. It is available in (and manufactured in) many areas including:

* Australia
* Barbados
* China
* Chile
* Ethiopia
* Fiji
* Indonesia
* Malaysia
* Mauritius
* Middle East
* Pacific Islands
* Peru
* Philippines
* Russia
* Singapore
* Sri Lanka
* Taiwan
* United Kingdom
In Britain, Anchor block butter was imported from New Zealand until August 2012 when Arla Foods UK, transferred production to a local factory at Westbury, Wiltshire, using English cream.

== Anchor Spreadable ==
Anchor Spreadable is one of the brand&#x27;s specialised products. This butter based spread is softened with canola oil and spreads easily, but marketing claims of its being spreadable direct from the fridge have been questioned. A campaign in 2003 for Anchor Spreadable, created by Jonti Picking, of Weebl and Bob fame, included television ads featuring wobbly cows.

Anchor Spreadable, as well as other New Zealand butter products, were banned from import into the EU for a short time. This came after a complaint made to the European Commissioner for Trade, Peter Mandelson, by the German dairy trader, Egenberger.

<doc id="673599" wikidata="Q156597" url="?curid=673599" title="Men in Black II">
<text>Men in Black II (stylized as MIIB) is a 2002 American science fiction action comedy film based on the Marvel Comics series of a similar name based on the conspiracy theory. Produced by Columbia Pictures and Amblin Entertainment in association with MacDonald Parkes Productions, and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing, it is the sequel to &quot;Men in Black&quot; (1997) and the second installment in the &quot;Men in Black&quot; film series. The film was directed by Barry Sonnenfeld from a screenplay by Robert Gordon and Barry Fanaro, and it stars Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith, with Lara Flynn Boyle, Johnny Knoxville, Rosario Dawson, Tony Shalhoub, and Rip Torn in supporting roles. It featured Michael Jackson&#x27;s last theatrical film appearance before his death in 2009. In the film, the emergence of an alien threat reunites Kevin Brown / Agent K (Jones) and James Darrell Edwards III / Agent J (Smith).

Development for a sequel film began following the box office success of the original; Jones, Smith, and Sonnenfeld&#x27;s returns were confirmed by 2001, and David Koepp was initially hired to write the screenplay. Koepp then left production to work on &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (2002) and was replaced with Gordon, who developed the script and story further. Fanaro was later brought in to perform some final rewrites to Gordon&#x27;s treatment. Principal photography began on June 11, 2001 and lasted until that September, taking place primarily in New York City; filming was delayed and several scenes were reworked following the September 11 attacks that month. The film&#x27;s soundtrack contained the theme song &quot;Black Suits Comin&#x27; (Nod Ya Head)&quot;, performed by Smith. Aside from this song, composer Danny Elfman, who scored the first film, returned to compose its sequel.

&quot;Men in Black II&quot; premiered at Mann Village Theater in Westwood, Los Angeles on June 26, 2002, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 3 of that same year. It received generally mixed reviews from critics, who deemed it inferior to its predecessor, but praised Jones&#x27;s and Smith&#x27;s performances and action sequences. Nonetheless, it was a financial success, grossing $445.1 million worldwide and becoming the fifth-highest grossing film of 2002. Its sequel, &quot;Men in Black 3&quot;, was released in 2012 to an improved critical and commercial response.

==Plot==
In flashbacks, a group of aliens called Zarthans, led by Princess Lauranna, travel to Earth and beg the Men in Black (MiB) organization for help in guarding a powerful item called the Light of Zartha before a shapeshifting alien called Serleena gets it. Due to their neutral status, the MiB refuse before Agent K seemingly sends the Light off-world in a rocket. An angered Serleena leaves to pursue it.

In 2002, five years after joining the MiB, Agent J has become one its best agents while developing a reputation for neuralyzing partners he feels are emotionally unfit to cope with the work. Serleena returns to Earth after being informed by a two-headed alien named Scrad and Charlie that the Light is still on Earth. She forces Scrad and Charlie to help her find it. Serlena kills a Zarthan pizzeria owner named Ben, who refuses to tell her where the Light is. While investigating Ben&#x27;s murder, J develops an attraction towards a witness named Laura. J breaks MiB protocol and chooses not to neuralyze her. Investigating further, J later discovers that K did not send the Light away but hid it on Earth.

Due to K having been neuralyzed five years ago, before retiring, no one knows where the Light is. J goes to where K is now, serving as postmaster of a small town, and eventually convinces him to come back. J brings K to MiB&#x27;s headquarters to use the deneuralyzer machine to restore his memories. However, Serleena, Scrad and Charlie attack MiB headquarters, forcing the pair to escape and find Jack Jeebs, an alien pawnbroker who built an illegal deneuralyzer. Although the machine works, K fails to remember the Light as he had neuralyzed himself and those memories have not returned. Nonetheless, he left himself a series of clues. After locating a locker key at the pizzeria and leaving Laura with a group of alien worms for her safety, the pair head to Grand Central Terminal, where they find a locker containing a society of tiny aliens who worship K as their deity and developed a religion around a video store membership card.

Visiting the store, the owner shows them a fictionalized version of the MiB&#x27;s previous encounter with the Light and Serleena. K remembers what really happened, including that Serleena had killed Princess Lauranna, but only tells J that the Light must leave Earth within one hour or else Earth will be destroyed. J believes the Light is Laura&#x27;s bracelet, which is now glowing. The pair head back to the worms, only to learn Serleena attacked them and kidnapped Laura. Joined by the worms, the agents infiltrate and retake MiB headquarters and rescue Laura before escaping to return the Light. Serleena chases them across Manhattan until J tricks her into being eaten by Jeff, a gigantic worm-like alien living in the subway. Guided by Laura&#x27;s bracelet, the agents locate a Zarthan transport ship, where K reveals Laura is the Light and Lauranna&#x27;s daughter before convincing J to let her go so she can save Earth and Zartha. As Laura is about to leave, Serleena makes another attempt at seizing her, having assimilated Jeff, but K and J kill Serleena before K uses a neuralyzer hidden in the Statue of Liberty&#x27;s torch to erase New York&#x27;s memories of Serleena&#x27;s actions.

==Production==
Despite some initial involvement from David Koepp (who left to work on&quot; Panic Room&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man&quot;), the script was written by Robert Gordon and later revised by Barry Fanaro, who added pop culture references, something which Gordon had deliberately avoided. Barry Sonnenfeld took issue with the producers&#x27; focus on the love story between Will Smith&#x27;s and Rosario Dawson&#x27;s characters, saying that &quot;I learned on &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; that audiences didn&#x27;t want to see Will as the straight man. And until Tommy comes back into the movie, by definition Will&#x27;s the straight man.&quot; Fanaro condensed the first part of the film and brought Agent K in earlier. Famke Janssen was originally cast as Serlenna, but dropped out due to personal issues, Lara Flynn Boyle was hired to replace her.

Principal photography began on June 11, 2001 and ended on September 23, 2001. The climax of the story was originally filmed against a backdrop of the twin towers of the original World Trade Center; but after the September 11 attacks, the climactic scene was completely redone to being at the Statue of Liberty. Other scenes incorporating views of the twin towers likewise were edited, or reshot. Filming for &quot;Men in Black II&quot; was also suspended due to the attacks.

Supervising sound editor Skip Lievsay used a Synclavier to recreate and improve the original recording of the neuralyzer sound effect from the first film (which was the sound of a strobe flash as it recycles) by removing some distortion. For some of the scenes with the Serleena creature, the sound crew &quot;took tree branches, put them inside a rubber membrane and pushed that around and added some water.&quot; For the special effects scene where the subway train is attacked by Jeff the Worm, a specially designed vise was used to crush a subway car and make it look as if it had been bitten in half.

Unlike the first film and the 1997 animated series, &quot;Men in Black II&quot; did not feature Agent L who was played by Linda Fiorentino, even though the character had a prominent role in the latter. It was briefly mentioned in the film that Agent J had her neuralyzed because she wanted to go back to working at the morgue. According to producer Laurie MacDonald, the studio did not consider her a permanent character in the franchise and decided to remove her from the sequel. There were also reports suggesting that Fiorentino was difficult to work with and supposedly Jones&#x27; refusal to work with her.

==Music==

The motion picture soundtrack to &quot;Men In Black II&quot; was released on June 25, 2002 by Columbia Records.

==Release==
===Marketing===
In October 2001, the first photos for &quot;Men in Black II&quot; were revealed. A teaser trailer premiered in December 2001, which was attached to the screenings of &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and &quot;Ali&quot;. Just four months later in April 2002, a new trailer was released online. It made its debut in theaters on May 3 with the release of &quot;Spider-Man&quot;.

Burger King began selling a variety of kids meal toys themed to the film at their restaurants. Several action figures were also released by Hasbro at the North American International Toy Fair event.

A video game partly based on the film was released in 2002, titled &quot;Men in Black II: Alien Escape&quot;.

===Home media===
&quot;Men In Black II&quot; was released on DVD and VHS on November 26, 2002, and on Blu-ray on May 1, 2012. It came with an alternate ending where J is sent to the homeworld of the aliens from Grand Central Station.

In the United Kingdom, the film was watched by 710,000 viewers on subscription television channel Sky Movies 1 in 2004, making it the year&#x27;s eighth most-watched film on subscription television.

The entire &quot;Men in Black&quot; series was released on 4K UHD Blu-ray on December 5, 2017.

==Reception==
===Box office===
Released theatrically on July 3, 2002, &quot;Men in Black II&quot; earned $18.5 million on its opening day, making it the third-highest Wednesday opening, behind &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; and &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot;. The film would go on to make $52,148,751 during its opening weekend, becoming the highest Fourth of July three-day opening weekend, surpassing its predecessor &quot;Men in Black&quot;. Within five days, it grossed $87.1 million, breaking &quot;Independence Day&quot;″s record for having the biggest five-day Fourth of July Wednesday opening. &quot;Men in Black II&quot; would hold the record for having the largest Fourth of July opening weekend until it was surpassed by &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; in 2004. That same year, &quot;I, Robot&quot; tied the record for having the highest opening weekend for a Will Smith film. Both films remained so until 2007 when they were taken by &quot;I Am Legend&quot;. The film was ranked number one at the box office upon opening, beating out &quot;The Powerpuff Girls Movie&quot;. It would go on to compete against other summer films, such as &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot;, &quot;Mr. Deeds&quot; and &quot;Minority Report&quot;. The film held the number one position in its second weekend with revenue of $24,410,311, a 53.2% decrease from the previous weekend. The third weekend saw a 40.4% decrease, with box office of $14,552,335, coming in at number three.

In its fourth weekend, the film was at fourth place, with revenue of $8,477,202. &quot;Men in Black II&quot; fell out of the top ten after five weekends. After sixty-two days of release in North America, &quot;Men in Black II&quot; had grossed $190,418,803. 43.1% of the film&#x27;s worldwide revenue of $445,135,288 came from North America.

Grossing $1.2 million, &quot;Men in Black II&quot; had the second-highest opening weekend in Taiwan, behind &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot;. In France, the film made $10 million during its opening weekend, which was the country&#x27;s second-highest of all time, after &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#x27;s Stone&quot;. Then, it collected $3.1 million in Mexico, making it the fifth-highest opening weekend in the country, trailing the latter film, &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;Ice Age&quot; and &quot;Dinosaur&quot;.

===Critical response===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Men in Black II&quot; holds an approval rating of 38% based on 198 reviews, with an average score of 5.30/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Lacking the freshness of the first movie, &quot;MIB 2&quot; recycles elements from its predecessor with mixed results.&quot; On Metacritic, the film received a score of 49 based on 37 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said, &quot;Within the trivial, ingratiating scope of its ambition... the sequel is pleasant enough&quot; and, noting the vast array of aliens designed by Rick Baker, said that the film &quot;really belongs to Mr. Baker.&quot; A review in &quot;The Hindu&quot; called the film &quot;worth viewing once.&quot; A review from &quot;Digital Media FX&quot; magazine praised the spaceships as looking realistic, but criticized many of the simpler visual effects, such as the moving backgrounds composited behind the car windows using blue-screen (which it called a throwback to the special effects of earlier decades). In August 2002, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; placed the Worm Guys among their list of the best CG characters, and said that enlarging the roles of Frank the Pug and the Worm Guys in &quot;Men in Black II&quot; was beneficial for the &quot;tiring franchise.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
The film was nominated for both Best Science Fiction Film at the Saturn Awards and &quot;Best Visual Effects in a Visual Effects Driven Motion Picture&quot; at the Visual Effects Society Award but lost to both &quot;Minority Report&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; respectively. The film also earned a Razzie Award nomination for Lara Flynn Boyle as Worst Supporting Actress.

==Sequels==

<text>Daniel Kipngetich Komen (born 17 May 1976) is a Kenyan middle- and long-distance runner. Remembered for his rivalry with Haile Gebrselassie, his most notable achievements came in a two-year period between 1996 and 1998, during which he broke a string of world records.

Komen held the world record in the 3000 metres for nearly 28 years, with a time of 7:20.67 set in 1996. Komen also held the world best in the two mile run for nearly 26 years. With his time of 7:58.61 set in 1997, he, along with Jakob Ingebrigtsen, are the only two men in history to average two miles at a sub-four-minute mile pace. Komen&#x27;s splits were 3:59.4 on both the first and second half of the race. He is also the Kenyan record holder for the 5000 metres both outdoors and indoors.

Komen was the second man, after Saïd Aouita, to break the 3-minute mark for the 1500 m, the 7-minute mark for 3000 m, and the 13-minute mark for the 5000 m.

==Early life==
Komen was born in Elgeyo Marakwet District. He is from the Keiyo sub-tribe of Kalenjin people and grew up in a rural area of Kenya&#x27;s Rift Valley Province. One of fourteen children, Komen began running at the age of seven as a means of getting to and from school. His running abilities were discovered and at the age of 14 he travelled to Australia. Komen had an exceptional junior career: at age 17, he placed second at the World Junior Cross Country Championships, and in 1994, he became the World Junior Champion in the 5,000 meters and 10,000 meters.

==Career==
Komen first appeared in the senior ranks in 1994 when he won a place on Kenya&#x27;s 10,000 m team for the 1994 Commonwealth Games, placing ninth. The next year, at the Golden Gala meet in Rome, Komen set the world junior record in the 5,000m with a time of 12:56.15, helping pace Moses Kiptanui to a world record in the process.

In 1996, Komen began to dominate the 5,000 m. On 1 September 1996 in Rieti, Italy, Komen ran a spectacular world record time of 7:20.67 in the 3000 metres, breaking Noureddine Morceli&#x27;s former record by 4.44 seconds. Komen&#x27;s record stood untouched for nearly 28 years, with Hicham El Guerrouj&#x27;s 1999 time of 7:23.09 being over two seconds behind Komen. Jakob Ingebrigtsen would break the record on 25 August 2024, clocking 7:17.55 to become the first man under 7:20. 

A year later, on 19 July 1997, Komen made history again. In Hechtel, Belgium, he became the first man to run two miles in under eight minutes, clocking a world best of 7:58.61. His first mile was faster than Roger Bannister&#x27;s first-ever sub-four, while his second equalled it. Just seven months later, at an Australian athletics meet in Sydney, Komen ran 7:58.91, missing his world best by 0.30 seconds. This performance makes Komen the only man in history to break 8 minutes in the two mile more than once. His 7:58.61 world best in the two mile stood for nearly 26 years, until 9 June 2023 when Jakob Ingebrigtsen ran 7:54.10.

In August 1997 he broke the 5000 m world record and took two seconds off of Haile Gebrselassie&#x27;s best to bring it to 12:39.74.

Only twelve days after the previous world record of 7:26.15 was set by Haile Gebrselassie, Komen broke the indoor 3,000-metre record with a time of 7:24.90, set in Budapest on 6 February 1998. This mark was referred to as &quot;Mount Everest&quot; in athletics circles and had been bettered only twice outdoors, one of them being Komen&#x27;s own world record. Kenenisa Bekele believed that breaking Komen&#x27;s record was only &quot;possible on a special day if the pace is good and if everything else also is perfect.&quot; This mark, having stood for more than 25 years, was bettered on February 15, 2023 by Ethiopia&#x27;s Lamecha Girma with a time of 7:23.81 in the Meeting Hauts-de-France Pas-de-Calais in Lievin. Spain&#x27;s Mohamed Katir also went under Komen&#x27;s previous record with a time of 7:24.68.

Other accolades include being the 1997 World Championships in Athletics and 1998 Commonwealth Games 5,000-meter champion. He won the 5000 metres race at the 1998 IAAF World Cup.

Out of the limelight since the late 1990s, Komen now serves as chairman of the Keiyo North Rift Athletics Association and as co-director of a private school with his wife, Joyce.

<text>La Pointe-de-l&#x27;Île () is a federal electoral district in Quebec, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 2004. Its population in 2001 was 98,878.

The riding was created in 2003 from parts of Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies, Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, and Mercier ridings.

==Geography==
The district includes the City of Montréal-Est, the neighbourhood of Pointe-aux-Trembles in the Borough of Rivière-des-Prairies–Pointe-aux-Trembles, and the eastern part of the neighbourhood of Longue-Pointe and the southern part of the neighbourhood of Mercier-Est in the Borough of Mercier–Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.

The neighbouring ridings are Hochelaga, Honoré-Mercier, Montcalm, Repentigny, Verchères—Les Patriotes, and Longueuil—Pierre-Boucher.

==Demographics==
:&quot;According to the 2016 Canadian census&quot;

* Languages: (2016) 83.0% French, 3.5% Spanish, 2.6% English, 2.0% Creole, 1.9% Arabic, 1.3% Italian, 0.6% Portuguese, 0.6% Romanian, 0.5% Vietnamese, 0.5% Kabyle

==History==
The riding is located in Eastern Montreal, traditionally the power base of the Quebec sovereignty movement. It had long been reckoned as the Bloc Québécois&#x27; safest riding. However, in 2011, after the retirement of longtime MP Francine Lalonde, it fell to the New Democratic Party along with all of the other ridings in Eastern Montreal.

This riding lost territory to Hochelaga and gained territory from Honoré-Mercier during the 2012 electoral redistribution.

<text>The Kerikeri River rises in the Puketi Forest inland from Kerikeri and flows into the western extremity of the Bay of Islands in northern New Zealand. A long stream flowing into Raglan Harbour in Waikato also has the same name but it is unofficial.

Slightly less than long, the Northland river is hardly a significant waterway, but because it terminates at one of the most important historic sites in the country, the Kerikeri Basin, adjacent to the Stone Store.

The freshwater river falls over a ford into the Kerikeri Basin, the upper extremity of Kerikeri Inlet, a northwestern arm of the Bay. The ford replaced a bridge which crossed at that point for decades, but which needed to be demolished to protect Kerikeri&#x27;s historic buildings in the basin.

A replacement bypass bridge was constructed several hundred metres upstream and opened in 2008. A pedestrian bridge was constructed around 2010, upstream from the ford.

The area is one of the most visited tourist destinations in the country, because of its history and photogenic buildings. The Stone Store was built in 1832 and is the oldest stone building extant in New Zealand. Adjacent is the Mission House, previously known as &quot;Kemp House&quot;, which was built in 1822 and is the oldest surviving wooden house in Australia and New Zealand. Behind, up a hill, is St James&#x27; Church which has been on the site since 1829 (although in its current form only since 1878).

Part of the history of the river is that it was used by chief Hongi Hika whose Kororipo Pa is about across the basin from the ford. Hongi used the river and tracks beside it to commute to Kororipo, his coastal pā, which played a significant part in the historic Musket Wars.

A popular walking track from the basin leads about five kilometres to the river’s spectacular Rainbow Falls. One of the first hydroelectric power stations in New Zealand was constructed on the river, and remains of it can be seen from the track.

<text>Bad Boys is a 1995 American action comedy film directed by Michael Bay in his feature directorial debut and produced by Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer. The film stars Martin Lawrence and Will Smith as Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowrey, two Miami narcotics detectives who are investigating $100 million worth of stolen packs of heroin and must also protect a woman from an international drug dealer after she witnessed a key murder.

The film was released on April 7, 1995 by Columbia Pictures. It received mixed reviews from critics, but was commercially successful, grossing $141 million worldwide, and spawned three sequels: &quot;Bad Boys II&quot; (2003), &quot;Bad Boys for Life&quot; (2020), and &quot;Bad Boys: Ride or Die&quot; (2024).

==Plot==
Lifelong friends Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett are devoted Miami Police narcotics detectives investigating $100 million of seized Mafia heroin, their biggest career bust which was stolen from a secure police vault. Internal Affairs suspects that it was an inside job and threatens to shut down the entire department unless they recover the drugs within 72 hours.

Mike asks one of his informants and ex-girlfriend Maxine &quot;Max&quot; Logan to look for people who are newly rich and therefore suspects. She gets herself and her best friend Julie Mott hired as escorts by Eddie Dominguez, a crooked former cop.

The party is soon interrupted by Dominguez&#x27;s French drug kingpin boss Fouchet and his henchmen Casper, Ferguson, and Noah. To further cover his tracks because of this slip up, one of Fouchet&#x27;s henchmen kill Dominguez and Fouchet kills Max, while Julie manages to escape. The madam who hired Julie and Max is disposed of by Noah, who then knocks out Mike as he investigates Max&#x27;s death.

Frantically calling the police, Julie insists on talking only to Mike, who is following up on a lead with the Madam. Knowing she never met Mike, captain Conrad Howard forces Marcus to impersonate him to talk to her. At her apartment, Marcus and Julie are attacked by some of Fouchet&#x27;s henchmen, one of whom Marcus kills.

When they rendezvous with Mike, Marcus and Mike have to impersonate each other, with Mike living at the Burnett residence while Marcus stays with Julie at Mike&#x27;s. They struggle to keep up the charade in Julie&#x27;s presence, and she soon begins to suspect the truth.

Looking through mugshots, Julie identifies Noah as one of the henchmen. The partners go to Club Hell, one of Noah&#x27;s known hangouts, and she follows unbeknownst to them. After being spotted, Marcus knocks Casper unconscious during a bathroom fight. Julie tries to kill Fouchet, but Marcus stops her.

In the ensuing car chase, Mike kills Noah. The three manage to get away, but are caught on camera by a news helicopter. The ensuing report is later seen by Marcus&#x27;s family, who were told that he was temporarily reassigned to Cleveland.

Mike and Marcus meet their old informant Jojo and learn about the location of the chemist who is cutting the stolen drugs. The three return to Mike&#x27;s apartment, where Marcus&#x27;s wife Theresa confronts them and confirms Julie&#x27;s suspicion they have been impersonating each other. Fouchet and his gang show up and kidnap Julie.

Mike and Marcus&#x27;s department is shut down by Internal Affairs. Despite being reassigned, Howard delays the order, giving Mike and Marcus more time to solve the case. They access Dominguez&#x27;s private police database profile and learn that the police secretary Francine is his former girlfriend. She was being blackmailed by Fouchet and Dominguez after they took nude photos of her, threatening to post them at her kids&#x27; school.

Mike, Marcus, and detectives Sanchez and Ruiz, head to the Miami-Opa Locka Executive Airport. During a fierce shootout, they kill Fouchet&#x27;s remaining henchmen, including Casper and Ferguson, and rescue Julie. They chase a fleeing Fouchet and force his car into a concrete barrier. As he tries to flee, Mike shoots him in the leg and attempts to arrest him at gunpoint while Marcus tells Mike that Fouchet is not worth killing, but Fouchet starts to egg Mike on to make Mike shoot and kill him instead, but Marcus asks Mike to stand down and Mike does so. Then Marcus tells Mike that Fouchet is a joke.

After a tense conversation with Marcus while chasing Fouchet, Fouchet surreptitiously draws a gun but is shot to death by Mike before he can kill Marcus, avenging Max&#x27;s death. An exhausted Marcus leaves Julie with Mike handcuffing them to each other and heads home, eager to be reunited with his family.

==Cast==
==Production==
Principal photography began on June 27, 1994, at the Dade Tire company near downtown Miami, the city chosen to replace the original New York locale. Filming continued throughout the area, including South Beach&#x27;s Tides Hotel, the Mediterranean Biltmore Hotel, the Dade County Courthouse and a multimillion-dollar estate on a private island. The second floor of downtown Miami&#x27;s Alfred DuPont building was converted into a police station; a freighter on the Miami River into a drug lab. &quot;Bad Boys&quot;&#x27; climactic scenes were filmed at the Opa-Locka Airport. Filming was quick due to the television schedules of the stars with production wrapping on August 31. The opening sequence was written and shot during post-production. In the film&#x27;s early stages of development, Simpson and Bruckheimer initially envisioned Dana Carvey and Jon Lovitz in the roles. When the film was written for Carvey and Lovitz, the original title for &quot;Bad Boys&quot; was &quot;Bulletproof Hearts&quot;. The film was initially set up at Hollywood Pictures, a Walt Disney Studios subsidiary, but it was placed into turnaround by management and sold the project to Columbia Pictures. Arsenio Hall turned down the role of Lowrey and cites that choice as the worst mistake he has ever made. The role eventually went to Smith. Both Lawrence and Smith were starring in their own hit television shows, &quot;Martin&quot; and &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;, when filming &quot;Bad Boys&quot;. &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; even references the film in an episode. In the season 6, episode 20, called &quot;I Stank Horse&quot;, Nicholas &quot;Nicky&quot; Banks tells Will that his parents will not let him watch &quot;Bad Boys&quot;, to which Will replies, &quot;&quot;Bad Boys&quot;, huh? What&#x27;cha gonna do?&quot;

===Improvisation===
Director Bay did not like the script and often engaged Smith and Lawrence in discussions about how the dialogue and scenes could improve. He often allowed them to improvise while the cameras were rolling. He secretly told Smith to call Lawrence a bitch before the car scene. The whole &quot;two bitches in the sea&quot; was improvised, as was Lawrence&#x27;s comment when Leoni called him gay. The scene in the convenience store, when the clerk puts a gun to Burnett and Lowrey&#x27;s heads and yells, telling them to &quot;Freeze, mother bitches!&quot;, is also improvised. They came up with: &quot;No, &quot;you&quot; freeze, bitch! Now back up, put the gun down and get me a pack of Tropical Fruit Bubbalicious&quot;. &quot;And some Skittles.&quot; According to Bay in the DVD commentary, at the end of the film when Mike and Marcus are recuperating, Mike says &quot;I love you, man.&quot; Bay claims that Smith refused to say the line, causing the director and actor to argue back and forth over the line. Bay wanted Smith to say the line as he felt it summed up the friendship between the cops. After their argument had lasted for half of the day&#x27;s shoot and much of the crew was ready to pack up, a fed up Bay told Smith to do whatever he wanted, after which Smith changed his mind and agreed to say the line.

==Music==
==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Bad Boys&quot; generated a total of $15.5 million during its opening weekend, beating out &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; and &quot;Tommy Boy&quot; to reach the number one spot. For its second weekend, it remained at the top spot with $11 million. Despite being dethroned by &quot;While You Were Sleeping&quot;, the film still made $7 million in its third weekend, while also outgrossing &quot;Kiss of Death&quot;. &quot;Bad Boys&quot; was commercially successful, grossing $141,407,024 worldwide — $65,807,024 in North America and $75,600,000 internationally.

===Critical reception===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Bad Boys&quot; holds an approval rating of 43% based on 69 reviews, with an average rating of 5.3/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Bad Boys&quot; stars Will Smith and Martin Lawrence have enjoyable chemistry; unfortunately, director Michael Bay too often drowns it out with set pieces and explosions in place of an actual story.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 41 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Most of the criticisms focused on the fact that despite the production of the film and the ability of the stars, the script did not diverge from the generic plot of a buddy-cop genre film, instead opting for repeated use of formulaic scenes.

Roger Ebert in his video review of the film on &quot;At the Movies&quot; noted that despite the highly energetic approach of the two lead actors and the visual style of the film, their acting talents were mostly &quot;new wine in old bottles&quot;. He illustrated that many of the elements featured in the film including both the plot and characters had been recycled from other films, particularly those from the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; and &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; series—recurrent stock-characters, police detective clichés and over-long action scenes. In describing the archetypal cop-buddy genre action scene adhered to by the film, Ebert noted &quot;Whenever a movie like this starts to drag, there&#x27;s always one infallible solution; have a car-chase and then blow something up real good.&quot; Ebert gave the film 2 out of 4 stars.

Gene Siskel in his appraisal of the film said that he had lost interest in the film after its introduction due to the very formulaic approach, and repeated Roger Ebert&#x27;s criticism that the talents of the lead actors were wasted; suggesting that the production company did not spend significant time producing a script which would be suitable for their talents. Siskel gave the film 2 out of 4.

<doc id="673618" wikidata="Q559548" url="?curid=673618" title="Michael Scot">
<text>Michael Scot (Latin: Michael Scotus; 1175 – ) was a Scottish mathematician and scholar in the Middle Ages. He was educated at Oxford and Paris, and worked in Bologna and Toledo, where he learned Arabic. His patron was Frederick II of the Holy Roman Empire and Scot served as science adviser and court astrologer to him. Scot translated Averroes and was the greatest public intellectual of his day.

==Early life and education==
Scot was born somewhere in the border regions of Scotland. He studied first at the cathedral school of Durham and then at Oxford and Paris, devoting himself to philosophy, mathematics, and astrology. It appears that he had also studied theology and become an ordained priest, as Pope Honorius III wrote to Stephen Langton on 16 January 1223/4, urging him to confer an English benefice on Scot, and nominated Scot as archbishop of Cashel in Ireland. Scot declined this appointment, but he seems to have held benefices in Italy. 

From Paris, Scot went to Bologna, and then after a stay at Palermo, to Toledo. There he learnt Arabic well enough to study the Arabic versions of Aristotle and the many commentaries of the Arabs upon these. In addition, he studied the original works of Avicenna and Averroes, and translated them into Latin.

==Career==
Scot was a typical example of the polyglot wandering scholar of the Middle Ages—a churchman who knew Latin, Greek, Arabic and Hebrew. When he was about 50, Frederick II attracted him to his court in the Kingdom of Sicily. At the instigation of the emperor, Scot supervised (along with Hermannus Alemannus) a fresh translation of Aristotle and the Arabian commentaries from Arabic into Latin. Translations by Scot survive of the &quot;Historia animalium&quot;, &quot;De anima&quot;, and &quot;De caelo&quot;, along with the commentaries of Averroes upon them.

The second version of Fibonacci&#x27;s famous book on mathematics, &quot;Liber Abaci&quot;, was dedicated to Scot in 1227. It has been suggested that Scot played a part in Fibonacci&#x27;s presentation of the Fibonacci sequence. A recent study of a passage written by Michael Scot on multiple rainbows, a phenomenon understood only by modern physics and recent observations, suggests that Michael Scot may have had contact with the Tuareg people in the Sahara desert.

In a letter of 1227, recorded by Scot in his &quot;Liber particularis&quot;, Emperor Frederick questioned him concerning the foundations of the earth, the geography and rulership of the heavens, what is beyond the last heaven, in which heaven God sits, and the precise locations of hell, purgatory and heavenly paradise. He also asked about the soul; and about volcanoes, rivers, and seas. According to the chronicler Fra Salimbene, Frederick attempted to catch Scot out in his calculations of the distance to heaven by scaling from the height of a church tower (by having it secretly lowered). Scot replied by saying that either the moon had gotten further away or the tower had gotten shorter.

Scot was a pioneer in the study of physiognomy. His manuscripts dealt with astrology, alchemy and the occult sciences generally, and account for his popular reputation. 

These works include:
* &quot;Super auctorem spherae&quot;, printed at Bologna in 1495 and at Venice in 1631.
* &quot;De sole et luna&quot;, printed at Strassburg (1622), in the &quot;Theatrum chimicum&quot;, and containing more alchemy than astronomy, the sun and moon appearing as the images of gold and silver.
* &quot;De chiromantia&quot;, an opuscule concerning chiromancy
* A divination-centered trilogy of books collectively titled the &quot;Liber introductorius&quot; (&quot;The Introductory Book&quot;) which includes: the &quot;Liber quatuor distinctionum&quot;, the &quot;Liber particularis&quot;, and the &quot;Liber physiognomiae&quot;

The &quot;Liber physiognomiae&quot; (which also exists in an Italian translation) and the &quot;Super auctorem spherae&quot; expressly state that the author undertook the works at the request of the Emperor Frederick II.

&quot;Every astrologer is worthy of praise and honour,&quot; Scot wrote, &quot;since by such a doctrine as astrology he probably knows many secrets of God, and things which few know.&quot;

He was offered in 1223 the role of being the Archbishop of Cashel in Ireland by Pope Honorius III; then that of Canterbury in 1227 by Pope Gregory IX.

Some sources report that Emperor Frederick used scholars like Michael Scot as messengers to Arab rulers like Al-Kamil 
for diplomatic and scholarly exchanges because of his knowledge of Arabic, and, that he even brought Michael Scot to the Holy Land during the Sixth Crusade in 1228-29.

==Death==
The date of Scot&#x27;s death remains uncertain. The efforts of Walter Scott and others to identify him with the Sir Michael Scot of Balwearie, sent in 1290 on a special embassy to Norway, have not convinced historians; though the two may have had family connections.

A legend popular in the late 13th and early 14th centuries said that Scot foresaw that a small stone would strike him in the head and kill him, so he wore an iron skullcap to avoid his death. However, he removed the cap in church, only to be struck by a stone and die.

==In legend==
The legendary Michael Scot used to feast his friends with dishes brought by spirits from the royal kitchens of France and Spain and other lands.

He is said to have turned a coven of witches to stone, which have become the stone circle of Long Meg and Her Daughters in Cumbria.

Scot&#x27;s reputation as a magician had already become fixed in the age immediately following his own. He appears in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, the only Scot to do so, in the fourth bolgia located in the Eighth Circle of Hell, reserved for sorcerers, astrologers, and false prophets who claimed they could see the future when they, in fact, could not. He is described by Dante as being &quot;spare in the flank&quot; (&quot;ne&#x27; fianchi è cosi poco&quot;). While some argue that this is the &quot;sole extant description of his physical appearance&quot;, others contend that the description is more poetic. Richard Kay argues that because &quot;the shades in the Dantesque afterworld create surrogate aerial bodies for themselves that are a projection of [their] soul[s]&quot;, this description is in reference to &quot;some internal character trait to which [Dante] wished to draw our attention.&quot; Kay argues that Dante was referencing a physiognomic description taken from Scot&#x27;s own &quot;Liber physiognomiae&quot; – namely, that thin and small ribs signify an individual &quot;who is weak, who does little labour, who is sagacious, [and] bad&quot; (the original Latin, found in chapter 88 of the &quot;Liber physiognomiae&quot;, reads: […] &quot;significat hominem debilem, pauci laboris, sagacem&quot; [&quot;et&quot;] &quot;malum&quot;).

Scot also had a particular reputation for his ability to predict the future. Fra Salimbene makes a comparison between Asdente of Parma, a cobbler who predicted the death of Nicholas III and election of Martin IV, and the &quot; Abbot Joachim, Merlin, Methodius, the Sibyls, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Hosea, Daniel, the Apocalypse, and Michael the Scot.&quot;

Giovanni Boccaccio represents him in the same character, and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola arraigns him severely in his work against astrology, while Gabriel Naudé finds it necessary to defend his good name in his &quot;Apologie pour tous les grands personages faussement soupçonnez de magie&quot;.

In John Leyden&#x27;s ballad &quot;Lord Soulis&quot;, Michael Scot is credited with teaching magic to the protagonist, the evil sorcerer William II de Soules, who ends up being boiled alive.

Sir Walter Scott deploys Michael Scott (sic) in his &quot;The Lay of the Last Minstrel&quot;. In Footnotes 12/13, he credits him with conquering an indefatigable demon, after it had succeeded in splitting Eildon Hill into its three distinctive cones, by challenging it to weave ropes from sea-salt. He records that in the Scottish Borders any work of great labour or antiquity is ascribed either to Auld Michael, or Sir William Wallace, or the Devil.

He is the title character in the play &quot;The Warld&#x27;s Wonder&quot; by Alexander Reid.

<doc id="673624" wikidata="Q1285625" url="?curid=673624" title="Australian Aboriginal flag">
<text>The Australian Aboriginal flag is an official flag of Australia that represents Aboriginal Australians. It was granted official status in 1995 under the &quot;Flags Act 1953&quot;, together with the Torres Strait Islander flag, in order to advance reconciliation and in recognition of the importance and acceptance of the flag by the Australian community. The two flags are often flown together with the Australian national flag.

The Australian Aboriginal flag was designed by Aboriginal artist Harold Thomas in 1971, and it was first flown in Adelaide in July of that year. Thomas held the intellectual property rights to the flag&#x27;s design until January 2022, when he transferred the copyright to the Commonwealth government. The flag was designed for the land rights movement and became a symbol of Aboriginal people of Australia.

The flag is horizontally and equally divided into a black region (above) and a red region (below); a yellow disc is superimposed over the centre of the flag. The overall proportions of the flag, as proclaimed and in its original design, are 2:3; however, the flag is often reproduced in the proportions 1:2 as with the Australian national flag.

==Status==
On 14 July 1995, the Keating government advised the proclamation of the Aboriginal flag as &quot;the flag of the Aboriginal peoples of Australia and to be known as the Australian Aboriginal flag&quot;, under section five of the &quot;Flags Act 1953&quot;. The proclamation noted that the flag was &quot;recognised as the flag of the Aboriginal peoples of Australia and a flag of significance to the Australian nation generally&quot;. Due to an administrative oversight, the 1995 proclamation was not lodged so that it would continue in force indefinitely; hence it automatically expired on 1 January 2008. It was therefore almost identically replaced, on 25 January 2008, with effect as from 1 January.

==Design==
===Symbolic meaning===
The symbolic meaning of the flag colours (as stated by Harold Thomas) are:

* Black – &quot;represents the Aboriginal people of Australia&quot;
* Yellow circle – &quot;represents the Sun, the giver of life and protector&quot;
* Red – &quot;represents the red earth, the red ochre used in ceremonies and Aboriginal peoples&#x27; spiritual relation to the land&quot;

Discussing the process of designing the flag in a copyright trial, Thomas also elaborated that the black represented &quot;black consciousness, black awareness, black power [and] be[ing] proud of your blackness&quot;. The other colours of yellow and red were sourced from the predominant colours used to decorate pukamani poles. Thomas also explained why the black was placed above the red stripe:

Others, including Nova Perris and social worker Tileah Drahm-Butler, have also interpreted the red as representing the blood shed by Aboriginal people.

===Colours===

The official colour specifications of the Australian Aboriginal flag are:

In most cases, on-screen or digital reproductions of the flag should use the RGB colours as in the table above. When displaying in physical fabric formats, it is much preferred to use the Pantone specifications. When printing on paper, the CMYK colours are superior.

===Shape===
The original design was in the proportion 2:3, rather than 1:2, to make the flag more &quot;squared up&quot;, as Thomas felt that the Australian Flag, at 1:2, was too long.

==History==

The flag was first flown on National Aborigines Day in Victoria Square in Adelaide on 9 July 1971. It was also used in Canberra at the Aboriginal Tent Embassy from late 1972. In the early months of the embassy—which was established in February that year—other designs were used, including flags with the black, red and green colours of the Pan-African flag as a symbol of black consciousness, and a flag with a red-black field containing a spear and four crescents in yellow.
Cathy Freeman caused controversy at the 1994 Commonwealth Games by carrying the Aboriginal flag as well as the Australian national flag during her victory lap of the arena, after winning the 200 metres sprint; only the national flag is meant to be displayed. Despite strong criticism from both Games officials and Australian team president Arthur Tunstall, Freeman carried both flags again after winning the 400 metres.
In 1995, the Keating government advised the governor-general to give the flag official status as a flag of Australia, through a proclamation under the &quot;Flags Act&quot;. In a statement, the minister for Administrative Services argued this reflected the government&#x27;s support for Aboriginal pride and reconciliation. However, the decision was criticised at the time by Liberal opposition leader John Howard. He stated that the recognition &quot;would rightly be seen by many in the community not as an act of reconciliation but as a divisive gesture&quot; and that &quot;No matter how these flags bulk large in the affections of our indigenous people, they can only ever be symbols for one section of the Australian community.&quot; The move was also criticised by the designer of the flag, Harold Thomas, arguing that the flag &quot;doesn&#x27;t need any more recognition&quot; and that &quot;This move will mean that the flag has been taken over by the white man and will lose its potency as a symbol.&quot;

The National Indigenous Advisory Committee campaigned for the Aboriginal flag to be flown at Stadium Australia during the 2000 Summer Olympics. The Olympics organisers announced that the Aboriginal flag would be flown at Olympic venues. The flag has been flown over the Sydney Harbour Bridge during the march for of 2000 and many other events, including Australia Day. On 4 February 2022, the New South Wales government announced that the flag would be flown from the Harbour Bridge permanently.

On the 30th anniversary of the flag in 2001, thousands of people were involved in a ceremony where the flag was carried from the Parliament of South Australia to Victoria Square.

==Use==
===Public buildings and locations===
The first city council to fly the Aboriginal flag was Newcastle City Council in 1977.

On 8 July 2002 the Adelaide City Council endorsed the permanent flying of the Aboriginal flag close to the location of its first raising at Victoria Square in 1971 (now dual-named Tarntanyangga), which now flies adjacent to the Australian flag. It has also been flown in front of Adelaide Town Hall since the same date.

Various councils in Australian towns fly the Aboriginal flag from the town halls, such as Bendigo (adopted in 2005). The flag is also flown at many other public buildings such as a number of the state Parliament Houses including that of Victoria.

In April 2021 Regional NSW Police Deputy Commissioner Gary Worboys said that he would like to see the flag flown at every New South Wales Police regional police station in the state, expanding from the 12 of the 89 then flying it.

The Australian Aboriginal flag has been hoisted alongside the Australian national flag as a permanent feature of the Australian Embassy in Dublin, Ireland, since 5 March 2021.
Following the 2022 Australian federal election on 21 May 2022, the incoming Anthony Albanese led Labor government started displaying the Aboriginal flag and the Torres Strait Islander flag alongside the national flag at ministerial press conferences. Upon the opening of the new Parliament, both flags began to be displayed in the House of Representatives and Senate chambers.

From 27 May 2022, at the start of National Reconciliation Week, both the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags were hoisted on the front lawn of Government House, Adelaide, to be permanently flown alongside the national flag and the South Australian flag.

===Other authorised uses===
The sale of condoms in the colours of the Aboriginal flag won a public health award in 2005 for the initiative&#x27;s success in improving safe sex practices among young Indigenous people.

Aboriginal-designed emojis titled Indigemojis and including the flag on several designs, were released in December 2019 via an app, with the permission of Harold Thomas.

===Proposed, unauthorised and other uses===

The Aboriginal flag is often included in various proposed designs to replace the current Australian Flag. One proposal has been to substitute the Union Flag, located in the canton of the Australian Flag, with the Aboriginal flag. Harold Thomas said of this idea: &quot;I wouldn′t reject it out of hand, but I could make a decision to say no. Our flag is not a secondary thing. It stands on its own, not to be placed as an adjunct to any other thing. It shouldn&#x27;t be treated that way.&quot;

In the science fiction film &quot;Event Horizon&quot;, actor Sam Neill, himself a New Zealander, designed a flag for use on his sleeve as the way he thought the Australian flag should look in 2047, which incorporated the Aboriginal flag.

The Australian Aboriginal flag is celebrated in the painting &quot;The First Supper&quot; (1988) by Susan Dorothea White where the central figure is an Aboriginal woman who displays the flag on her T-shirt.

The flag was to be part of the logo on Google Australia&#x27;s home page on Australia Day 2010, but the company was forced to modify the design due to its creator Harold Thomas demanding payment if Google were to use it.

The anti-Islamic group Reclaim Australia used the flag at their protests in 2015, which was condemned by the flag&#x27;s creator, Harold Thomas, who called it &quot;idiotic&quot;.

==Copyright==

Copyright in the flag has been subject to controversy, as to original and ongoing ownership of the copyright.

===1997: copyright granted to Thomas===
In 1997, in the case of &quot;Thomas v Brown and Tennant&quot;, the Federal Court of Australia declared that Harold Thomas was the owner of copyright in the design of the Australian Aboriginal flag, and thus the flag has protection under copyright law of Australia. Thomas had sought legal recognition of his ownership and compensation following the Federal Government&#x27;s 1995 proclamation of the design, and his claim was contested by two others, George Brown and James Tennant. After winning copyright, Thomas awarded rights solely to Carroll &amp; Richardson – Flagworld Pty Ltd and Birubi Art Pty Ltd for the manufacture and marketing of the flag and of products featuring the flag&#x27;s image.

In November 2018, Thomas granted WAM Clothing (which is co-owned by Birubi Art owner Ben Wooster) a licence for the use of the flag on clothing. In June 2019, it was reported that WAM Clothing had demanded that Aboriginal-owned businesses stop selling clothing that featured the flag. They also sent notices to the NRL and AFL about their use of the flag on Indigenous round jerseys. In June 2020, after a prominent Aboriginal footballer began selling WAM-licensed teeshirts bearing the flag through his own website, Aboriginal former senator Nova Peris, a leader of a &quot;free the flag&quot; campaign, wrote to the Governor-General, requesting his support for divesting WAM of the copyright.

After consultation with its Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Advisory Council, the AFL did not enter into a commercial agreement with WAM in 2020, in line with general Aboriginal sentiment on the issue. In August 2020, Ken Wyatt, Minister for Indigenous Australians, said that he would love to see the flag freely used across Australia, and former AFL player Michael Long said its absence would have a negative effect on the players in the Sir Doug Nicholls Indigenous Round. Wyatt encouraged spectators to bring flags to the games, beginning in Darwin on 22 August 2020.

===2022: copyright transfer to Commonwealth===
On 24 January 2022, the Commonwealth government announced, after more than three years of confidential negotiations, that Thomas had transferred the copyright in the flag to the Commonwealth. The federal government paid $20.05m to Thomas and licence holders (including WAM Clothing and Carroll and Richardson Flagworld) to extinguish existing licences and secure copyright. As part of the copyright transfer, Thomas retained moral rights over the flag (which include the right to be identified as its creator). Following the copyright transfer, Carroll and Richardson Flagworld continued to be the exclusive manufacturer, although individuals may make copies for personal use.

The Commonwealth agreed to fund a scholarship in Thomas&#x27;s name for Indigenous students to further the development of Indigenous governance and leadership and an online education portal on the flag&#x27;s history. An original painting by Thomas detailing the transfer of copyright would be &quot;displayed in a prominent location&quot; by the Commonwealth. All royalties from the copyright are to be transferred to the National Aborigines and Islanders Day Observance Committee, and $2m would be devoted to establishing a not-for-profit organisation that will make periodic payments for activities related to the flag.

About the use of the flag, the government statement reads:

Many Aboriginal people celebrated the freeing of the flag; however, Bronwyn Carlson, Professor of Indigenous Studies and Director of the Centre for Global Indigenous Futures at Macquarie University, expressed a contrary opinion, suggesting that to &quot;free&quot; the flag for all and sundry may demean it as a symbol of Aboriginal identity and history. She wrote in &quot;The Conversation&quot;: &quot;the Aboriginal flag has always been our flag. We didn&#x27;t need an act of parliament to recognise its significance.&quot; Some Indigenous people are not happy to see the federal government have control of the flag, rather than an Indigenous organisation, and law professor Isabella Alexander said that some legal questions remained, for as long as details of the agreement were still commercial-in-confidence. Upon the release by the Australian government of the Assignment Deed following an FOI application, David J. Brennan has identified a likelihood that the Australian copyright in the 1971 flag as an artistic work expired upon transfer to the Commonwealth.

The flag&#x27;s current legal status was debated in an Australian Senate estimates committee in mid‑February 2022, when it was also revealed that the Morrison government had paid $13.75m to Thomas to assume copyright, and also paid $6.3m to two non-Indigenous businesses which held licences to use the flag. These companies are WAM Clothing, which received $5.2m, and Wooster Holdings, which was paid $1.1m. Interests in both companies are held by Gold Coast businessman Ben Wooster, former director of Birubi Art (which was fined $2.3m in 2018 for selling fake Aboriginal art).

<text>The Travers Stakes is an American Grade I Thoroughbred horse race held at Saratoga Race Course in Saratoga Springs, New York. It is nicknamed the &quot;Midsummer Derby&quot; and is the third-ranked race for American three-year-olds according to international classifications, behind only the Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes. First held in 1864, it is the oldest stakes race in the United States specifically for 3-year-olds, and was named for William R. Travers, the president of the old Saratoga Racing Association. His horse, Kentucky, won the first running of the Travers. The race was not run in 1896, 1898, 1899, 1900, 1911, and 1912. From 1943-5, it was run at Belmont Park instead of Saratoga due to the war.
The race is the highlight of the summer race meeting at Saratoga, just as the Belmont Stakes is the highlight of the spring meeting at Belmont Park. The purse was increased to $1,000,000 in 1999 and then to $1,250,000 in 2014. The purse for the 2015 renewal was increased to $1,600,000 due to the presence of Triple Crown winner American Pharoah.

From 2018 until 2022 the Travers Stakes was sponsored by Jim McIngvale under the name of retired stallion Runhappy. 

The 155th Travers Stakes will be run on Saturday, August 24, 2024.

==Overview==

The Travers is run at scale weights: colts and geldings carry and fillies carry .

The Travers has been run at four different distances:

*: 1864 to 1889
*: 1890 to 1892
*: 1893, 1894, 1897 and 1904 to present
*: 1895 and 1901 to 1903

== Awards for winner ==
The winner&#x27;s trophy, known as the Man o&#x27; War Cup, was designed by Tiffany &amp; Co. Its namesake, Man o&#x27; War, won this race in 1920. The trophy was won by Man o&#x27; War in a special match race in 1920 against Sir Barton, the 1919 American Triple Crown winner. The wife of owner Samuel Riddle donated the trophy in 1936 as the permanent award for winning the race. Each year, the name of the winner is inscribed on the Cup. A gold-plated replica is presented to the winner each year by a member of the Riddle family.

The winner of the race is presented with a blanket of carnations, which is approximately 10 feet long and requires about 1,500 flowers and is draped over the withers of the winner. The blanket is red in color outlined with a fringe of white carnation and a large &quot;T&quot; also in white. The carnations are red and white, which are the colors of Saratoga Race Track. The blanket is prepared the night before the race by a Saratoga florist. 

Winning connections are also given a lawn jockey statue custom-painted in the silk colors of the winning owner to be displayed at the racecourse entrance for the next year. 

Since 1961, the colors of the Travers winner have been painted onto a canoe which sits on a pond in the infield. The canoe itself has been a fixture at the track since 1926.

==Notable moments==
The 1921 Travers Stakes is known for a betting scandal. In those days, bookmaking rather than parimutuel wagering was the primary method of taking bets on horse races.

The original field was fairly light with the favorite, the filly Prudery, owned by Harry Payne Whitney, facing no serious competition. Then Arnold Rothstein entered his colt, Sporting Blood, ostensibly to pick up second place. A few days before the race, however, Rothstein had learned that Prudery was off her feed. He knew he might have a real chance to win. Initially, the odds on the filly were 1-4, while Rothstein&#x27;s colt was 5–2. On the day of the race, however, a leading three-year-old, Grey Lag, was entered by trainer Sam Hildreth. Grey Lag immediately became the favorite, with Prudery the second choice, driving the odds on Sporting Blood up to 3–1. Rothstein bet $150,000 on his horse. Just before post time, Grey Lag was scratched with no explanation. During the race, Sporting Blood overtook the ailing Prudery, gaining his owner nearly half a million dollars, including wagers and the purse.

Although many smelled foul play, it was never proven that Hildreth received any payoff or that there was a conspiracy between him and Rothstein.

In 1941, Whirlaway became the only horse ever to win both the American Triple Crown and the Travers Stakes, sometimes referred to as a &quot;superfecta&quot;.

In 1962, Jaipur won by a nose-bob in track record time over the arguably more talented Ridan after a long, head-to-head battle over the entire mile and a quarter. Still written and talked about today, the race is listed in the 2006 book Horse Racing&#x27;s Top 100 Moments written by the staff of Blood-Horse Publications. The race result determined which colt would be named the 1962 U.S. Champion 3-Year-Old Horse.

In 1978, Affirmed finished the Travers ahead of rival Alydar but was disqualified for crowding Alydar off the rail. Alydar was awarded the win. It was the last of 10 times the two would race each other in one of the sport&#x27;s greatest rivalries.

In 1982, Runaway Groom, the Champion Canadian Three year old arrived at Saratoga after competing in the Canadian Triple Crown, having won the Prince of Wales Stakes and Breeders&#x27; Stakes, and finishing second in the Queen&#x27;s Plate. At the Travers that year, Runaway Groom became the second horse in racing history to beat the three winners of the Triple Crown series in the same race, defeating Kentucky Derby winner Gato Del Sol, Preakness Stakes winner Aloma&#x27;s Ruler, and Belmont Stakes winner Conquistador Cielo. Sun Briar was the first to do so in the 1918 Travers Stakes.
The 1997 Travers saw U.S. Racing Hall of Fame jockeys Jerry Bailey and Chris McCarron (aboard Behrens and Deputy Commander respectively) in a home-stretch duel wherein Deputy Commander prevailed. Adding to the drama was a thunderstorm which produced hail 24 hours before the race, and the uncertainty around whether or not McCarron would be present after the recent death of his mother.
In 2001, Point Given won the Travers before a record Travers Stakes day attendance of 60,486. The total betting handle was $34,529,273, which was a Saratoga record at that time.

On August 25, 2012, Alpha and Golden Ticket finished in a dead heat for first place – meaning they could not be separated in the photo finish. Following the race, two canoes were put in the infield pond to commemorate the winners. It was the first official tie in the race&#x27;s history and the winning owners split the $800,000 first-place prize money. In 1874, Attila and Acrobat dead heated but were forced to run off to break the tie. 

On August 29, 2015, the 146th Travers Stakes saw Triple Crown winner American Pharoah race in front of a NYRA capped crowd of 50,000, making the event a sellout for the first time ever. In addition, the purse was raised to $1.6 million. The race reaffirmed Saratoga&#x27;s reputation as the &quot;graveyard of champions&quot; when Keen Ice defeated American Pharoah.

In 2016, The 147th Travers was equally notable as Arrogate rolled home to win by 13 1/2 lengths and set a new stakes record, finishing the race in 1:59:36. Arrogate&#x27;s victory helped Bob Baffert to avenge his loss the previous year with American Pharoah.

In 2023, Arcangelo by Arrogate won the 154th Travers trained by Jena Antonucci, the first woman to have a horse she trained win one of the three races in American horse racing&#x27;s triple crown. The horse was ridden in the 2023 Belmont Stakes by jockey Javier Castellano, winner aboard Mage in the 2023 Kentucky Derby. Arcangelo was shipped to the Saratoga Race Course where he won the Travers. by one length in a time of 2:02.23 over a muddy track making Antonucci the second female to win the race in its 154-year history. The horse was ridden by jockey Javier Castellano who set a record of seven winnings in the race.

In 2024, Thorpedo Anna competed in the 155th Travers looking to become the first filly to win this race since 1915. Despite a late challenge down the home stretch, Fierceness ended up winning the race, defeating her by a nose at the wire.

<text>Segni (, ) is an Italian town and &quot;comune&quot; located in Lazio. The city is situated on a hilltop in the Lepini Mountains and overlooks the valley of the Sacco River.

==History==

===Early history===

According to ancient Roman sources, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the seventh king of Rome, established a Roman colony at the town, then known as &quot;Signia&quot;. Additional colonists were reportedly sent there in 495 BC.

The ancient architectural remains include a circuit of fortification walls built using polygonal masonry. The walls incorporated a system of gates, including the &quot;Porta Saracena&quot; which is covered by a large monolithic architrave. Atop the ancient acropolis of Segni sits the podium of the temple of Juno Moneta, which now supports a Medieval church of Saint Peter (tenth century).

===Later history===

Segni was a refuge for various popes with Pope Eugene III erecting a palace in the middle of the twelfth century. The Counts of Marsi, hereditary enemies of the Orsini, obtained Segni in the twelfth century. The family called de&#x27; Conti produced several popes (Innocent III, Gregory IX and Alexander IV) and many cardinals. In 1558 Segni was sacked by the forces of the Duke of Alba in the war against Pope Paul IV; immense booty was captured, as the inhabitants of the other towns of the Campagna had fled thither.

==Main sights==

* Co-cathedral of &quot;Santa Maria Assunta&quot;, built in the early 17th century on the former temple of St. Bruno. The bell tower is from the 11th century. The interior has a painting by Francesco Cozza.
* The polygonal masonry fortification walls of the settlement are well preserved.

* The former site of the Juno Moneta temple marks the ancient Segni acropolis. The acropolis has recently been the site of renewed fieldwork undertaken by the British School at Rome.

<text>William Booth Gardner (August 21, 1936 – March 15, 2013) was an American politician who served as the 19th governor of Washington from 1985 to 1993. He also served as the ambassador of the GATT. A member of the Democratic Party, Gardner previously served as a state senator, representing the 26th district from 1971 to 1973, and was the Pierce County Executive prior to his tenure as governor. His service was notable for advancing standards-based education and environmental protection.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Born in Tacoma, Gardner attended Clover Park Junior High in Lakewood before graduating from Lakeside School in Seattle. His parents divorced when he was very young; through his mother&#x27;s remarriage he became an heir to the Weyerhaeuser fortune. His mother and younger sister, his only sibling, died in a plane crash when he was 14.

Gardner was a graduate of the University of Washington and Harvard Business School. His stepfather was Norton Clapp, one of the original owners of the Seattle Space Needle. Booth co-owned the Tacoma Tides, who played for one year in the American Soccer League in 1976. He was also a part-time soccer coach for various teams, including the Tacoma Cozars. In 1978, he co-owned the Colorado Caribous franchise in the NASL with Jim Guercio.

==Governor of Washington (1985–1993)==
In the Democratic primary for governor in 1984, Gardner defeated Jim McDermott. In the general election, he unseated one-term Republican incumbent John Spellman. Gardner was easily elected to a second term in 1988 over state representative Bob Williams, and chose not to seek a third term in 1992.

While governor, Gardner signed into law a health care program that provided state medical insurance for the working poor. He helped develop land-use and growth-management policies that made Washington an early environmental leader, steered hundreds of millions of dollars of increased spending toward state universities, increased standardized testing in public education, and improved legal protections for gay people.

On March 21, 1992, Gardner signed a measure that outlawed selling &quot;obscene&quot; music to minors in the state of Washington. The law went into effect on June 11 of that year, and make record store retailers and their employees criminally liable for selling such music to anyone under the age of 18.

==Later years==
A year after leaving office, Gardner was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. In 2006, he announced his support for assisted suicide. In 2008, he filed and successfully spearheaded the campaign for Initiative 1000, Washington&#x27;s Death With Dignity Act, which was closely modeled on Oregon&#x27;s assisted dying law; he remained involved in implementing the Act. Gardner said that he supported going even further than the current Washington and Oregon laws, to eventually permit lethal prescriptions for people whose suffering is unbearable without the requirement that the sufferer have a terminal condition.

In 2009, &quot;The Last Campaign of Governor Booth Gardner&quot;, a short documentary film, was produced by Just Media and HBO, chronicling the Initiative 1000 campaign. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Short.

Gardner supported eliminating Washington&#x27;s WASL test, a standardized test that was required to graduate high school. It was replaced in 2009 by the MSP for grades three through eight and the HSPE for grades eight through twelve.

Gardner died of Parkinson&#x27;s disease at age 76 at his Tacoma home on March 15, 2013.

<doc id="673658" wikidata="Q6404490" url="?curid=673658" title="Kid Gleason">
<text>William Jethro&quot;Kid&quot;Gleason (October 26, 1866 – January 2, 1933) was an American Major League Baseball (MLB) player and manager. Gleason managed the Chicago White Sox from 1919 through 1923. His first season as a big league manager was notable for his team&#x27;s appearance in the World Series and the ensuing Black Sox Scandal, although Gleason was not involved in the scandal. After leaving the White Sox, Gleason was on the coaching staff for the Philadelphia Athletics, until 1931.

==Early life==
Gleason was born in Camden, New Jersey. He acquired the nickname &quot;Kid&quot; early in life, not only because of his short stature (growing to only 5-foot-7, 155 pounds) but also because of his quite energetic, youthful nature. His family later moved to the Pocono Mountains in northeast Pennsylvania, where his father worked as a coal miner.

==Playing career==
Gleason played two seasons in the minor leagues of northern Pennsylvania. In 1886, with Williamsport of the Pennsylvania State League, he batted .355 and stole 20 bases in 36 games. Gleason debuted as a pitcher with the Philadelphia Quakers on April 20, 1888, after impressing Hall of Fame manager Harry Wright during an exhibition game against the University of Pennsylvania. After enjoying mixed success as a pitcher in 1888 and 1889, Gleason opted to stay in the National League under Wright instead of moving to the Players&#x27; League set up in 1890. His 1890 season was his best as a pitcher, with 38 wins, a 2.63 ERA, 54 complete games, and 506 innings pitched.

Gleason was sold to the St. Louis Browns for the 1892 season, where he played for two and a half seasons as a starting pitcher and reserve fielder. With St. Louis, he made appearances as an outfielder, first baseman, second baseman, and shortstop, and hit .235.

After being shipped to the Baltimore Orioles partway through the 1894 season, Gleason pitched effectively in 20 starts and also batted .349, helping Baltimore to a National League pennant. Early in the 1895 season, manager Ned Hanlon moved Gleason to second base full time, where he hit well but fielded poorly that year. Baltimore repeated as NL champions, but Hanlon traded Gleason in the offseason to the New York Giants.

In New York, Gleason played five seasons as the regular second baseman, hitting a respectable .271 overall but with little power. He served as a team captain, and in that capacity may have invented the intentional walk during an 1897 game by advising his pitcher to walk a strong hitter to face a weaker one. Gleason also earned local fame on April 26, 1900, for helping New York firemen rescue residents from an apartment fire.

Gleason joined the new American League in 1901, starting at second base for two years with the Detroit Tigers. From 1903 to 1908, he returned to Philadelphia and hit .250 over the period; he led the NL in sacrifice bunts in 1904 and 1905.

Gleason compiled a .261 career batting average. He retired as a player after the 1908 season at the age of 42, having appeared as a player in just two games for the Phillies that year. However, four years later, Gleason would make an unlikely return to the big leagues as a player, with his two at-bats in one game at second base for the White Sox in 1912 making Gleason one of only 29 MLB players to have played in four different decades.

Gleason led the league in putouts and assists three times each, though he also led in errors four times. He ranks seventh all-time in errors as a second baseman.

==Coaching career==
Gleason began his coaching career in 1908 with the Phillies as a player-coach. The Phillies unconditionally released Gleason on April 12, 1910, prior to Opening Day. At the time, the &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; called Gleason &quot;one of the most popular players who ever donned a Philadelphia uniform.&quot;

After sitting out 1910 and 1911, Gleason joined the Chicago White Sox in 1912, where he made one appearance as a player and became a coach under manager Jimmy Callahan.

Gleason became manager of the White Sox on December 31, 1918, following the dismissal of Pants Rowland. In his first season, the team won the pennant but lost the World Series to the Cincinnati Reds, resulting in allegations the White Sox had been paid by gamblers to &quot;throw&quot; the Series. The ensuing scandal resulted in lifetime bans from baseball for eight White Sox players. Gleason, however, was not involved in the gambling, and some sources noted he was among those who alerted White Sox owner Charles Comiskey of the fix. Although he felt betrayed and disappointed by his 1919 team, he continued to manage the White Sox through the 1923 season.

After leaving in 1923, Gleason went on in 1926 to coach under manager Connie Mack with the Philadelphia Athletics until retiring after the 1931 season. As a coach, Gleason won two World Series championships with the Athletics, in 1929 and 1930.

==Death==
Gleason died due to a heart ailment in 1933, at the age of 66, in Philadelphia. His funeral was attended by an estimated 5,000 people, including baseball luminaries such as Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis and Hall of Fame manager John McGraw. He is buried in Philadelphia&#x27;s Northwood Cemetery.

==In popular culture==
Gleason has been referenced in pop culture in several books, and is a prominent supporting character in Ring Lardner&#x27;s 1916 novel &quot;You Know Me Al&quot;. He is portrayed by actor John Mahoney in the 1988 film &quot;Eight Men Out&quot;, based on Eliot Asinof&#x27;s book of the same name.

<text>John Dennis Spellman (December 29, 1926 – January 16, 2018) was an American politician who served as the 18th governor of Washington U.S. state from 1981 to 1985 and as the first King County executive from 1969 to 1981.

Spellman was elected governor in 1980 amid large gains for Republicans across the country. During his tenure, the Washington State economy suffered due to the early 1980s recession. Spellman was defeated in his reelection campaign in 1984. To date, he is the last Republican to have held the office of Governor of Washington.

==Early life and education==
Spellman was born in Seattle, to insurance executive Sterling Bartholomew &quot;Bart&quot; Spellman and teacher Lela A. Spellman (née Cushman). He was of Irish and English Puritan descent. His paternal grandfather, Dennis Bartholomew &quot;Denny&quot; Spellman, arrived in Seattle from Ireland just before the great fire of 1889 and became a successful plumbing contractor. His maternal grandmother was one of the first white children born in Oregon Territory and settled in the town of Brownsville. His father, Bart, was a standout guard for the University of Oregon in its 1917 Rose Bowl victory over the heavily favored University of Pennsylvania and later was an assistant coach at both Oregon and the University of Washington.

Spellman was raised in the Eastside suburbs of Hunts Point and Bellevue with his sister Mary; his older brother David Bartholomew was killed during the Korean War. He completed his high school education at Seattle Preparatory School, graduating in 1944. The same year, he left high school midway through his senior year studies to enroll in the Merchant Marine cadet program during World War II and served in the United States Navy. Under the G.I. Bill, he was a 1949 BBS graduate of Seattle University in history and political science, and a 1953 graduate of the Georgetown University Law Center. Spellman met his wife Lois Elizabeth Murphy (1927–2018), who was from Havre, Montana, in a Spanish class while attending Seattle University; the two were married in 1954 and had six children together, Margo, Bart, David, Jeffrey, Teresa and Kat.

==Early political career==

Spellman entered politics after joining a group of progressive Republicans who sought to reform the party. He became a member of the Municipal Civic Service Commission while practicing as an attorney in the early 1960s. Spellman ran for mayor of Seattle in 1964, but did not advance past the primary. He campaigned for Dan Evans in his successful bid to become governor later that year. Spellman was elected to the three-member King County Commission in 1967. Following a voter-approved plan to implement a new Home Rule Charter in 1968, the office of County Executive was established and Spellman was elected the county&#x27;s first chief executive over former governor Albert Rosellini in 1969.

Spellman played the lead role in establishing the county&#x27;s new governmental structure under the Charter. He consolidated previously independent departments and replaced the old patronage system with a merit system. Spellman supervised the controversial process of siting and building the Kingdome, the domed stadium that provided the first home for the Seattle Seahawks and Seattle Mariners, and initiated early efforts to deal with uncontrolled growth. He was twice re-elected to the office in 1973 and 1977.

==Governor of Washington (1981–1985)==
Spellman first ran for governor in 1976 and was the top Republican in the state&#x27;s blanket primary, but lost the general election to Democrat Dixy Lee Ray. Spellman again ran for governor in 1980, narrowly defeating representative Duane Berentson in the primary. Jim McDermott was the Democratic nominee, having defeated Ray in the primary, but was defeated by Spellman by a lopsided margin in the general election in a year Republicans made big political gains across the country.

During Spellman&#x27;s four-year term of office, Washington&#x27;s economy suffered a serious recession marked by rising unemployment and disappointing tax revenues. The State Legislature was deeply divided over how to address an alarming revenue shortfall, but did agree to an increase in Washington&#x27;s statewide sales tax rate from 5.5% to 6.5%. Despite campaign promises to oppose new taxes, Spellman pushed for $2.5 billion in new taxes to address funding shortfalls.

One of Spellman&#x27;s memorable policy stands was his strong commitment to environmental protection. Against pressure from business groups and many legislators, he vetoed a bill permitting for an environmentally-risky development project by Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron in a sensitive shoreline area of Whatcom County. The veto was overridden by a vote of the state senate. He successfully blocked a proposed oil pipeline that would have crossed under the Puget Sound over potential endangerment of the waterway&#x27;s ecology and refused to back down amidst public support of the project.

In September 1983, upon the death of U.S. Senator Henry M. Jackson, Spellman appointed former Republican governor Daniel J. Evans to fill the vacant U.S. Senate seat. While the Democratic party protested the appointment of a Republican to fill the seat vacated by a Democrat, Spellman&#x27;s appointment was considered lawful under the then-current statutes. As state law required an immediate primary and general election for the remaining U.S. Senate seat term, a primary election was held just three weeks after Evans&#x27; interim appointment.

In 1984, Spellman ran for a second term of office. After a Democratic primary between then-State Senator Jim McDermott, former state Representative John Jovanovich, and then-Pierce County Executive Booth Gardner, Spellman faced a difficult battle in the general election against Democratic nominee Gardner. In the November 1984 general election, Spellman was defeated by Booth Gardner, and no Republican has served as governor of Washington since.

==Post-governorship career==
After leaving office in January 1985, Spellman returned to private law practice. In 1990 he ran for election as a justice of the Washington Supreme Court against Richard P. Guy, but was not elected. Spellman was a partner at the Seattle-based law firm, Carney Badley Spellman.

Spellman was awarded the James R. Ellis Regional Leadership Award from the Municipal League of King County in 2006.

==Death==
Spellman suffered a fall on December 27, 2017, which resulted in a broken hip. He was admitted to Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle for treatment and died of pneumonia on the morning of January 16, 2018, at the age of 91.

<text>The New York Racing Association, Inc.(NYRA) is the not-for-profit corporation that operates the three largest thoroughbred horse racing tracks in the state of New York, United States: Aqueduct Racetrack in South Ozone Park, Queens; Belmont Park in Elmont; and Saratoga Race Course in Saratoga Springs.

Racing at NYRA tracks is year-round, operating at Belmont Park from May to mid-July and from September through October; at Saratoga Race Course from mid-July through Labor Day; and at Aqueduct from November through April.

The New York Racing Association is the successor to the Greater New York Association, a non-profit racing association created in 1955. NYRA is separate from the governing body that oversees racing in New York, currently the New York State Gaming Commission.

==History==
In 1913, racing returned to New York after a hiatus due to the Hart–Agnew Law. Only four tracks had survived the hiatus. These were Aqueduct Racetrack, Belmont Park, Jamaica Racetrack and Saratoga Race Course. The tracks came under common ownership with the creation of a non-profit association known as the Greater New York Association in 1955.

The association remodeled Aqueduct Racetrack, Belmont Park, and Saratoga Race Course and demolished Jamaica, which is now the Rochdale Village housing development. The partnership became the New York Racing Association on April 10, 1958. Later, Belmont Park was closed from 1963 to 1968 in order to construct a new grandstand.

Off-track betting in New York was established in 1970, being offered by regional, government-owned corporations. OTB parlors began showing live video feeds of races, referred to as simulcasting, in 1984. In 1995, NYRA launched a cable television channel and a telephone advance-deposit wagering service.

From December 2003 through September 2005, NYRA operated under a deferred prosecution agreement following a 2003 federal indictment. The charges related alleged income tax evasion and money laundering by mutuel clerks between 1980 and 1999 with the knowledge of NYRA middle managers. Under the agreement, NYRA paid $3 million to the government and its implementation of new cash-handling procedures designed to eliminate corruption and mismanagement was monitored by a New York law firm. After receiving a report from the monitor which concluded that NYRA was in compliance with the new guidelines, the Justice Department moved to dismiss the indictment and its motion was allowed by a federal judge.

NYRA, claiming that the state lottery division&#x27;s failure to approve the installation of video-lottery terminal (VLT) machines at Aqueduct Racetrack pushed it to insolvency, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on November 2, 2006. The association emerged from bankruptcy protection September 12, 2008 with incorporation of a successor corporation, New York Racing Association Inc. New York City&#x27;s OTB Corporation shut down permanently in 2010.

In 2016, NYRA launched an online advance-deposit wagering platform under the brand NYRA Bets, which offers live bets and live simulcasts, and is available on multiple states.

===Restructuring===
NYRA was reorganized and its franchise to operate the three racetracks was extended through 2033 under legislation approved by the New York state legislature on February 13, 2008. The new authorization provided $105 million in direct state aid and forgave millions more in state loans to NYRA. The association also gave up its claim to ownership of the land on which the three racetracks are situated. In return, the state gained expanded oversight responsibility. The state comptroller won the power to audit NYRA&#x27;s books. The conversion of NYRA from a non-profit association to a not-for-profit corporation also gave the state attorney general enhanced oversight authority. In addition, the state now appoints 11 of the corporation&#x27;s 25 directors. By changing from non-profit to not-for-profit status, NYRA also gained flexibility in its financial management.

==Law Enforcement==

NYRA maintains its own law enforcement force comprising over 300 sworn employees, including plain clothed investigators and inspectors as well as fire marshals. These officers must be licensed with the New York State Gaming Commission as well as meet requirements set forth by the Division of Criminal Justice Services.

===Peace Officers===
The force consists of uniformed officers &amp; supervisors, fire marshals, plain clothed investigators and inspectors, all of whom are New York State Peace Officer. Special police officers from the New York Racing Association must be authorized and have the appropriate firearm license pursuant to section 400.00 of the penal law in order to carry a firearm. NYRA peace officers have the authority to make arrest and issue summonses on NYRA property only, they carry defensive weapons such as a baton, pepper spray, and handcuffs. Uniformed members wear navy blue style uniforms with gold on white NYRA patches on their left side and an American flag patch on the right side. NYRA Peace Officers wear eagle-top shields, typically gold in color regardless of rank. NYRA Inspectors wear gold shields, similar in design to that other law enforcement Detectives, but do not wear uniforms or logos thereof.

NYRA Peace Officers go through an in-house training academy. Officers can get assigned to either the Patrol or Backstretch divisions. Patrol division officers are the everyday face of the department to the general public, conducting patrols and enforcing the law during meets and events at all three of NYRA&#x27;s facilities. Backstretch officers conduct patrols and enforce the law in the backstretch areas of all three locations such as the on-property residences NYRA staff and some riders live and work in. Each division&#x27;s officers are covered by its own union representation derived from two completely separate union organizations.

====Hiring Process====
NYRA hires Peace Officers for both divisions through their online application system. Once an applicant is interviewed by the Corporate HR Department, they do a panel interview with a Lieutenant or higher ranking sworn employee. During this panel interview, a written examination is administered based on summarized information sheets provided in the moment at the time of interview. If the applicant interviews successfully, passes the written exam and accepts the extended job offer then they are sworn as Peace Officers and sent to the New York State Gaming Commission office. All three NYRA properties have NY State Gaming Commission officers on property. There they take fingerprints and conduct licensing as commissioned peace officers.

All NYRA Peace Officers and Sergeants are paid hourly rates. Investigators, Lieutenants and higher-ranking members are paid annual salaries.

====Non-Sworn Members====
NYRA also seasonally employs New York State licensed security officers at Saratoga Racecourse during its racing meets, as well as subcontracts private security guard companies to assist with large details downstate such as Belmont Stakes. NYRA&#x27;s Security Officers wear light blue or white shirts with security patches on both arms. Contractors wear their security company&#x27;s patches and logos while working. NYRA Security Officers and contractors derive their powers from the New York State Law&#x27;s citizen&#x27;s arrest procedures as well as report to assist and make arrests on the orders of a sworn NYRA peace officer. Security Officers are registered with the NY Department of State and as such have no power above that of a normal citizen&#x27;s rights.

<doc id="673671" wikidata="Q778218" url="?curid=673671" title="1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens">
<text>On March27, 1980, a series of volcanic explosions and pyroclastic flows began at Mount St. Helens in Skamania County, Washington, United States. A series of phreatic blasts occurred from the summit and escalated until a major explosive eruption took place on May18, 1980, at 8:32am. The eruption, which had a volcanic explosivity index of 5, was the first to occur in the contiguous United States since the much smaller 1915 eruption of Lassen Peak in California. It has often been considered the most disastrous volcanic eruption in U.S. history.

The eruption was preceded by a two-month series of earthquakes and steam-venting episodes caused by an injection of magma at shallow depth below the volcano that created a large bulge and a fracture system on the mountain&#x27;s north slope. An earthquake at 8:32:11 am PDT (UTC−7) on May 18, 1980, caused the entire weakened north face to slide away, a sector collapse which was the largest subaerial landslide in recorded history. This allowed the partly molten rock, rich in high-pressure gas and steam, to suddenly explode northward toward Spirit Lake in a hot mix of lava and pulverized older rock, overtaking the landslide. An eruption column rose into the atmosphere and deposited ash in 11 U.S. states and various Canadian provinces. At the same time, snow, ice, and several entire glaciers on the volcano melted, forming a series of large lahars (volcanic mudslides) that reached as far as the Columbia River, nearly to the southwest. Less severe outbursts continued into the next day, only to be followed by other large, but not as destructive, eruptions later that year. The thermal energy released during the eruption was equal to 26 megatons of TNT.

About 57 people were killed, including innkeeper and World War I veteran Harry R. Truman, photographers Reid Blackburn and Robert Landsburg, and volcanologist David A. Johnston. Hundreds of square miles were reduced to wasteland, causing over $1 billion in damage (equivalent to $ billion in ), thousands of animals were killed, and Mount St. Helens was left with a crater on its north side. At the time of the eruption, the summit of the volcano was owned by the Burlington Northern Railroad, but afterward, the railroad donated the land to the United States Forest Service. The area was later preserved in the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument and due to the eruption, the state recognized the month of May as &quot;Volcano Awareness Month&quot; and events are held at Mt. St. Helens, or within the region, to discuss the eruption, safety concerns, and to commemorate lives lost during the natural disaster.

== Build-up to the eruption ==
Mount St. Helens remained dormant from its last period of activity in the 1840s and 1850s until March 1980. Several small earthquakes, beginning on March 15, indicated that magma might have begun moving below the volcano. On March 20, at 3:45 pm Pacific Standard Time, a shallow, magnitude-4.2 earthquake centered below the volcano&#x27;s north flank, signaled the volcano&#x27;s return from 123 years of hibernation. A gradually building earthquake swarm saturated area seismographs and started to climax at about noon on March 25, reaching peak levels in the next two days, including an earthquake registering 5.1 on the Richter scale. A total of 174 shocks of magnitude 2.6 or greater was recorded during those two days.

Shocks of magnitude 3.2 or greater occurred at a slightly increasing rate during April and May, with five earthquakes of magnitude 4 or above per day in early April, and eight per day the week before May 18. Initially, no direct sign of eruption was seen, but small earthquake-induced avalanches of snow and ice were reported from aerial observations.

At 12:36 pm on March 27, phreatic eruptions (explosions of steam caused by magma suddenly heating groundwater) ejected and smashed rock from within the old summit crater, excavating a new crater and sending an ash column about into the air. By this date, a eastward-trending fracture system had also developed across the summit area. This was followed by more earthquake swarms and a series of steam explosions that sent ash above their vent. Most of this ash fell between from its vent, but some was carried south to Bend, Oregon, or east to Spokane, Washington.


A second, new crater and a blue flame were observed on March 29. The flame was visibly emitted from both craters and was probably created by burning gases. Static electricity generated from ash clouds rolling down the volcano sent out lightning bolts that were up to long. Ninety-three separate outbursts were reported on March 30, and increasingly strong harmonic tremors were first detected on April 1, alarming geologists and prompting Governor Dixy Lee Ray to declare a state of emergency on April 3. Governor Ray issued an executive order on April 30 creating a &quot;red zone&quot; around the volcano; anyone caught in this zone without a pass faced a $500 fine () or six months in jail. This precluded many cabin owners from visiting their property.

By April 7, the combined crater was and deep. A USGS team determined in the last week of April that a section of St. Helens&#x27;s north face was displaced outward by at least . For the rest of April and early May, this bulge grew by per day, and by mid-May, it extended more than north. As the bulge moved northward, the summit area behind it progressively sank, forming a complex, down-dropped block called a graben. Geologists announced on April 30 that sliding of the bulge area was the greatest immediate danger and that such a landslide might spark an eruption. These changes in the volcano&#x27;s shape were related to the overall deformation that increased the volume of the volcano by by mid-May. This volume increase presumably corresponded to the volume of magma that pushed into the volcano and deformed its surface. Because the intruding magma remained below ground and was not directly visible, it was called a cryptodome, in contrast to a true lava dome exposed at the surface.

On May 7, eruptions similar to those in March and April resumed, and over the following days, the bulge approached its maximum size. All activity had been confined to the 350-year-old summit dome and did not involve any new magma. About 10,000 earthquakes were recorded before the May 18 event, with most concentrated in a small zone less than directly below the bulge. Visible eruptions ceased on May 16, reducing public interest and consequently the number of spectators in the area. Mounting public pressure then forced officials to allow 50 carloads of property owners to enter the danger zone on Saturday, May 17, to gather whatever property they could carry. Another trip was scheduled for 10 am the next day, and because that was Sunday, more than 300 loggers who would normally be working in the area were not there. By the time of the climactic eruption, dacite magma intruding into the volcano had forced the north flank outward nearly and heated the volcano&#x27;s groundwater system, causing many steam-driven explosions (phreatic eruptions).

== Landslide and climactic phase ==

As May 18 dawned, Mount St. Helens&#x27;s activity did not show any change from the pattern of the preceding month. The rates of bulge movement and sulfur dioxide emission, and ground temperature readings did not reveal any changes indicating a catastrophic eruption. USGS volcanologist David A. Johnston was on duty at an observation post around north of the volcano: as of 6:00 am, Johnston&#x27;s measurements did not indicate any unusual activity.

At 8:32 am, a magnitude-5.1 earthquake centered directly below the north slope triggered that part of the volcano to slide, approximately 7–20 seconds after the shock, followed a few seconds later by the main volcanic blast. The landslide, the largest subaerial landslide in recorded history, traveled at and moved across Spirit Lake&#x27;s west arm. Part of it hit a ridge about north. Some of the slide spilled over the ridge, but most of it moved down the North Fork Toutle River, filling its valley up to deep with avalanche debris. An area of about was covered, and the total volume of the deposit was about .

Scientists were able to reconstruct the motion of the landslide from a series of rapid photographs by Gary Rosenquist, who was camping away from the blast . Rosenquist, his party, and his photographs survived because the blast was deflected by local topography short of his location.

Most of St. Helens&#x27;s former north side became a rubble deposit long, averaging thick; the slide was thickest at below Spirit Lake and thinnest at its western margin. The landslide temporarily displaced the waters of Spirit Lake to the ridge north of the lake, in a giant wave about high. This, in turn, created a avalanche of debris consisting of the returning waters and thousands of uprooted trees and stumps. Some of these remained intact with roots, but most had been sheared off at the stump seconds earlier by the blast of superheated volcanic gas and ash that had immediately followed and overtaken the initial landslide. The debris was transported along with the water as it returned to its basin, raising the surface level of Spirit Lake by about .

Four decades after the eruption, floating log mats persist on Spirit Lake and nearby St. Helens Lake, changing position with the wind. The rest of the trees, especially those that were not completely detached from their roots, were turned upright by their own weight and became waterlogged, sinking into the muddy sediments at the bottom where they are in the process of becoming petrified in the anaerobic and mineral-rich waters. This provides insight into other sites with a similar fossil record.

== Pyroclastic flows ==
=== Initial lateral blast ===
The landslide exposed the dacite magma in St. Helens&#x27;s neck to much lower pressure, causing the gas-charged, partially molten rock and high-pressure steam above it to explode a few seconds after the landslide started. Explosions burst through the trailing part of the landslide, blasting rock debris northward. The resulting blast directed the pyroclastic flow laterally. It consisted of very hot volcanic gases, ash, and pumice formed from new lava, as well as pulverized old rock, which hugged the ground. Initially moving about , the blast quickly accelerated to around , and it may have briefly passed the speed of sound.

Pyroclastic flow material passed over the moving avalanche and spread outward, devastating a fan-shaped area 23 miles across by 19 miles long (37 km × 31 km). In total, about of forest were knocked down, and extreme heat killed trees miles beyond the blow-down zone. At its vent, the lateral blast probably did not last longer than about 30 seconds, but the northward-radiating and expanding blast cloud continued for about another minute.

Superheated flow material flashed water in Spirit Lake and North Fork Toutle River to steam, creating a larger, secondary explosion that was heard as far away as British Columbia, Montana, Idaho, and Northern California, yet many areas closer to the eruption (Portland, Oregon, for example) did not hear the blast. This so-called &quot;quiet zone&quot; extended radially a few tens of miles from the volcano and was created by the complex response of the eruption&#x27;s sound waves to differences in temperature and air motion of the atmospheric layers, and to a lesser extent, local topography.

Later studies indicated that one-third of the of material in the flow was new lava, and the rest was fragmented, older rock.

=== Lateral blast result ===

The huge ensuing ash cloud sent skyward from St. Helens&#x27;s northern foot was visible throughout the quiet zone. The near-supersonic lateral blast, loaded with volcanic debris, caused devastation as far as from the volcano. The area affected by the blast can be subdivided into roughly concentric zones:
# Direct blast zone, the innermost zone, averaged about in radius, an area in which virtually everything, natural or artificial, was obliterated or carried away. For this reason, this zone also has been called the &quot;tree-removal zone&quot;. The flow of the material carried by the blast was not deflected by topographic features in this zone. The blast released energy equal to .
# Channelized blast zone, an intermediate zone, extended out to distances as far as from the volcano, an area in which the flow flattened everything in its path and was channeled to some extent by topography. In this zone, the forces and direction of the blast are strikingly demonstrated by the parallel alignment of toppled large trees, broken off at the base of the trunk as if they were blades of grass mown by a scythe. This zone was also known as the &quot;tree-down zone&quot;. Channeling and deflection of the blast caused strikingly varied local effects that still remained conspicuous after some decades. Where the blast struck open land directly, it scoured it, breaking trees off short and stripping vegetation and even topsoil, thereby delaying revegetation for many years. Where the blast was deflected so as to pass overhead by several metres, it left the topsoil and the seeds it contained, permitting faster revegetation with scrub and herbaceous plants, and later with saplings. Trees in the path of such higher-level blasts were broken off wholesale at various heights, whereas nearby stands in more sheltered positions recovered comparatively rapidly without conspicuous long-term harm. 
# Seared zone, also called the &quot;standing dead&quot; zone, the outermost fringe of the impacted area, is a zone in which trees remained standing, but were singed brown by the hot gases of the blast.


By the time this pyroclastic flow hit its first human victims, it was still as hot as and filled with suffocating gas and flying debris. Most of the 57 people known to have died in that day&#x27;s eruption succumbed to asphyxiation, while several died from burns. Lodge owner Harry R. Truman was buried under hundreds of feet of avalanche material . Volcanologist David A. Johnston, who was stationed at Observation post Coldwater II , located just 6 miles (10 km) north of the mountain, was one of those killed , as was Reid Blackburn , a Vancouver Columbian and &quot;National Geographic&quot; photographer who was situated near Coldwater Creek , from the volcano, on the day of the eruption. Robert Landsburg, another photographer, who was within a few miles of the summit , was killed by the ash cloud. He was able to protect his film with his body, and the surviving photos provided geologists with valuable documentation of the historic eruption. Another eruption victim, amateur radio operator Gerry Martin, located near the Coldwater peak and farther north of Johnston&#x27;s position , reporting his sighting of the eruption enveloping the Coldwater II observation post. As the blast overwhelmed Johnston&#x27;s post, Martin declared solemnly: &quot;Gentlemen, the camper and car that&#x27;s sitting over to the south of me is covered. It&#x27;s going to hit me, too.&quot; before his radio went silent.

=== Later flows ===
Subsequent outpourings of pyroclastic material from the breach left by the landslide consisted mainly of new magmatic debris rather than fragments of pre-existing volcanic rocks. The resulting deposits formed a fan-like pattern of overlapping sheets, tongues, and lobes. At least 17 separate pyroclastic flows occurred during the May 18 eruption, and their aggregate volume was about .

The flow deposits were still at about two weeks after they erupted. Secondary steam-blast eruptions fed by this heat created pits on the northern margin of the pyroclastic-flow deposits, at the south shore of Spirit Lake, and along the upper part of the North Fork Toutle River. These steam-blast explosions continued sporadically for weeks or months after the emplacement of pyroclastic flows, and at least one occurred a year later, on May 16, 1981.

== Ash column ==

As the avalanche and initial pyroclastic flow were still advancing, a huge ash column grew to a height of above the expanding crater in less than 10 minutes and spread tephra into the stratosphere for 10 straight hours. Near the volcano, the swirling ash particles in the atmosphere generated lightning, which in turn started many forest fires. During this time, parts of the mushroom-shaped ash-cloud column collapsed, and fell back upon the earth. This fallout, mixed with magma, mud, and steam, sent additional pyroclastic flows speeding down St. Helens&#x27;s flanks. Later, slower flows came directly from the new north-facing crater and consisted of glowing pumice bombs and very hot pumiceous ash. Some of these hot flows covered ice or water, which flashed to steam, creating craters up to in diameter and sending ash as much as into the air.

Strong, high-altitude wind carried much of this material east-northeasterly from the volcano at an average speed around . By 9:45 am, it had reached Yakima, Washington, away, and by 11:45 am, it was over Spokane, Washington. A total of of ash fell on Yakima, and areas as far east as Spokane were plunged into darkness by noon, where visibility was reduced to and of ash fell. Continuing eastward, St. Helens&#x27;s ash fell in the western part of Yellowstone National Park by 10:15 pm, and was seen on the ground in Denver the next day. In time, ash fall from this eruption was reported as far away as Minnesota and Oklahoma, and some of the ash drifted around the globe within about 2 weeks.

During the nine hours of vigorous eruptive activity, about 540,000,000 tons () of ash fell over an area of more than . The total volume of the ash before its compaction by rainfall was about . The volume of the uncompacted ash is equivalent to about of solid rock, or about 7% of the amount of material that slid off in the debris avalanche. By around 5:30 pm on May 18, the vertical ash column declined in stature, but less severe outbursts continued through the next several days.

==Ash properties==
Generally, given that the way airborne ash is deposited after an eruption is strongly influenced by the meteorological conditions, a certain variation of the ash type will occur, as a function of distance to the volcano or time elapsed from eruption. The ash from Mount St. Helens is no exception, hence the ash properties have large variations.

===Chemical composition===
The bulk chemical composition of the ash has been found to be about 65% silicon dioxide, 18% aluminum oxide, 5% ferric oxide, 4% each calcium oxide and sodium oxide, and 2% magnesium oxide. Trace elements were also detected, their concentrations varying as 0.05–0.09% chlorine, 0.02–0.03% fluorine, and 0.09–0.3% sulfur.

=== Index of refraction ===
The index of refraction, a measure used in physics to describe how light propagates through a particular substance, is an important property of volcanic ash. This number is &quot;complex&quot;, having both &quot;real&quot; and &quot;imaginary&quot; parts, the real part indicating how light disperses and the imaginary part indicating how light is absorbed by the substance.

The silicate particles are known to have a real index of refraction ranging between 1.5 and 1.6 for visible light. However, a spectrum of colors is associated with samples of volcanic ash, from very light to dark gray. This makes for variations in the measured imaginary refractive index under visible light.

In the case of Mount St. Helens, the ash settled in three main layers on the ground: 
* The bottom layer was dark gray and was found to be abundant in older rocks and crystal fragments.
* The middle layer consisted of a mixture of glass shards and pumice.
* The top layer was ash consisting of very fine particles.

For example, when comparing the imaginary part of the refractive index &quot;k&quot; of stratospheric ash from from the volcano, they have similar values around 700 nm (around 0.009), while they differ significantly around 300 nm. Here, the sample (&quot;k&quot; was found to be around 0.009) was much more absorbent than the sample (&quot;k&quot; was found to be around 0.002).

== Mudslides flow downstream ==
The hot, exploding material also broke apart and melted nearly all of the mountain&#x27;s glaciers, along with most of the overlying snow. As in many previous St. Helens eruptions, this created huge lahars (volcanic mudflows) and muddy floods that affected three of the four stream drainage systems on the mountain, and which started to move as early as 8:50 am. Lahars travelled as fast as while still high on the volcano, but progressively slowed to about on the flatter and wider parts of rivers. Mudflows from the southern and eastern flanks had the consistency of wet concrete as they raced down Muddy River, Pine Creek, and Smith Creek to their confluence at the Lewis River. Bridges were taken out at the mouth of Pine Creek and the head of Swift Reservoir, which rose by noon to accommodate the nearly of additional water, mud, and debris.

Glacier and snowmelt mixed with tephra on the volcano&#x27;s northeast slope to create much larger lahars. These mudflows traveled down the north and south forks of the Toutle River and joined at the confluence of the Toutle forks and the Cowlitz River near Castle Rock, Washington, at 1:00 pm. Ninety minutes after the eruption, the first mudflow had moved upstream, where observers at Weyerhaeuser&#x27;s Camp Baker saw a wall of muddy water and debris pass. Near the confluence of the Toutle&#x27;s north and south forks at Silver Lake, a record flood stage of was recorded.

A large but slower-moving mudflow with a mortar-like consistency was mobilized in early afternoon at the head of the Toutle River north fork. By 2:30 pm, the massive mudflow had destroyed Camp Baker, and in the following hours, seven bridges were carried away. Part of the flow backed up for soon after entering the Cowlitz River, but most continued downstream. After traveling further, an estimated of material were injected into the Columbia River, reducing the river&#x27;s depth by for a stretch. The resulting river depth temporarily closed the busy channel to ocean-going freighters, costing Portland, Oregon, an estimated $5 million (equivalent to $ million ). Ultimately, more than of sediment were dumped along the lower Cowlitz and Columbia Rivers.

== Aftermath ==

=== Direct results ===
The May 18, 1980, event was the most deadly and economically destructive volcanic eruption in the history of the contiguous United States. About 57 people were killed directly from the blast, and 200 houses, 47 bridges, of railways, and of highway were destroyed; two people were killed indirectly in accidents that resulted from poor visibility, and two more suffered fatal heart attacks from shoveling ash. U.S. President Jimmy Carter surveyed the damage, and said it looked more desolate than a moonscape.

A film crew was dropped by helicopter on Mount St. Helens on May 23 to document the destruction, but their compasses spun in circles and they quickly became lost. A second eruption occurred the next day (see below), but the crew survived and was rescued two days after that. The eruption ejected more than of material. A quarter of that volume was fresh lava in the form of ash, pumice, and volcanic bombs, while the rest was fragmented, older rock. The removal of the north side of the mountain (13% of the cone&#x27;s volume) reduced Mount St. Helens&#x27;s height by about and left a crater wide and deep with its north end open in a huge breach.

More than of timber were damaged or destroyed, mainly by the lateral blast. At least 25% of the destroyed timber was salvaged after September 1980. Downwind of the volcano, in areas of thick ash accumulation, many agricultural crops, such as wheat, apples, potatoes, and alfalfa, were destroyed. As many as 1,500 elk and 5,000 deer were killed, and an estimated 12 million Chinook and Coho salmon fingerlings died when their hatcheries were destroyed. Another estimated 40,000 young salmon were killed when they swam through turbine blades of hydroelectric generators after reservoir levels were lowered along the Lewis River to accommodate possible mudflows and flood waters.

In total, Mount St. Helens released 24 megatons TNT of thermal energy, seven of which were a direct result of the blast. This is equivalent to 1,600 times the size of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.

====Uncertain death toll====
The death toll most commonly cited is 57, but two points of uncertainty remain.

The first point regards two officially listed victims, Paul Hiatt and Dale Thayer. They were reported missing after the explosion. In the aftermath, investigators were able to locate individuals named Paul Hiatt and Dale Thayer who were alive and well. However, they were unable to determine who reported Hiatt missing, and the person who was listed as reporting Thayer missing claimed she was not the one who had done so. Since the investigators could not thus verify that they were the same Hiatt and Thayer who were reported missing, the names remain listed among the presumed dead.

The second point regards three missing people who are not officially listed as victims: Robert Ruffle, Steven Whitsett, and Mark Melanson. Cowlitz County Emergency Services Management lists them as &quot;Possibly Missing — Not on [the official] List&quot;. According to Melanson&#x27;s brother, in October 1983, Cowlitz County officials told his family that Melanson &quot;is believed [...] a victim of the May 18, 1980, eruption&quot; and that after years of searching, the family eventually decided &quot;he&#x27;s buried in the ash&quot;.

Taking these two points of uncertainty into consideration, the direct death toll could be as low as 55 or as high as 60. When combined with the four indirect victims (two dying from vehicle accidents due to poor visibility, and two dying from heart attacks triggered by shovelling ash) those numbers range from 59 to 64.

A year and a half after the eruption, the bodies of two young women, Marsha Anne Weatter and Katherine Jean Allen, 18 and 20 years old respectively, were discovered. They were believed to have been murdered six weeks before the eruption, rather than being killed by the events. Backpacks belonging to them had been found in July 1980, but a layer of ash deposited by the eruption may have hid the bodies, also preventing animals disturbing the remains. An autopsy showed they had each been shot once.

=== Ash damage and removal ===

The ash fall created some temporary major problems with transportation, sewage disposal, and water treatment systems. Visibility was greatly decreased during the ash fall, closing many highways and roads. Interstate 90 from Seattle to Spokane was closed for a week and a half. Air travel was disrupted for between a few days and two weeks, as several airports in eastern Washington shut down because of ash accumulation and poor visibility. Over a thousand commercial flights were cancelled following airport closures. Fine-grained, gritty ash caused substantial problems for internal combustion engines and other mechanical and electrical equipment. The ash contaminated oil systems, clogged air filters, and scratched moving surfaces. Fine ash caused short circuits in electrical transformers, which in turn caused power blackouts.

Removing and disposing of the ash was a monumental task for some Eastern Washington communities. State and federal agencies estimated that over of ash, equivalent to about 900,000 tons in weight, were removed from highways and airports in Washington. The ash removal cost $2.2 million and took 10 weeks in Yakima. The need to remove ash quickly from transport routes and civil works dictated the selection of some disposal sites. Some cities used old quarries and existing sanitary landfills; others created dump sites wherever expedient. To minimize wind reworking of ash dumps, the surfaces of some disposal sites were covered with topsoil and seeded with grass. In Portland, the mayor eventually threatened businesses with fines if they failed to remove the ash from their parking lots.

=== Cost ===
A refined estimate of $1.1 billion ($ billion in ) was determined in a study by the International Trade Commission at the request of the United States Congress. A supplemental appropriation of $951 million for disaster relief was voted by Congress, of which the largest share went to the Small Business Administration, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Also, indirect and intangible costs of the eruption were incurred. Unemployment in the immediate region of Mount St. Helens rose 10-fold in the weeks immediately following the eruption, and then returned to near-normal levels once timber-salvaging and ash-cleanup operations were underway. Only a small percentage of residents left the region because of lost jobs owing to the eruption. Several months after May 18, a few residents reported suffering stress and emotional problems, though they had coped successfully during the crisis. Counties in the region requested funding for mental-health programs to assist such people.

Initial public reaction to the May 18 eruption dealt a nearly crippling blow to tourism, an important industry in Washington. Not only was tourism down in the Mount St. Helens–Gifford Pinchot National Forest area, but conventions, meetings and social gatherings also were cancelled or postponed at cities and resorts elsewhere in Washington and neighboring Oregon not affected by the eruption. The adverse effect on tourism and conventioneering, however, proved only temporary. Mount St. Helens, perhaps because of its reawakening, has regained its appeal for tourists. The U.S. Forest Service and the State of Washington opened visitor centers and provided access for people to view the volcano&#x27;s devastation.

== Later eruptions ==
St. Helens produced an additional five explosive eruptions between May and October 1980. Through early 1990, at least 21 periods of eruptive activity had occurred. The volcano remains active, with smaller, dome-building eruptions continuing into 2008.

===1980–1991===

An eruption occurred on May 25, 1980, at 2:30 am that sent an ash column into the atmosphere. The eruption was preceded by a sudden increase in earthquake activity, and occurred during a rainstorm. Erratic wind from the storm carried ash from the eruption to the south and west, lightly dusting large parts of western Washington and Oregon. Pyroclastic flows exited the northern breach and covered avalanche debris, lahars, and other pyroclastic flows deposited by the May 18 eruption.

At 7:05 pm on June 12, a plume of ash billowed above the volcano. At 9:09 pm, a much stronger explosion sent an ash column about skyward. This event caused the Portland area, previously spared by wind direction, to be thinly coated with ash in the middle of the annual Rose Festival.
A dacite dome then oozed into existence on the crater floor, growing to a height of and a width of within a week.

A series of large explosions on July 22 broke more than a month of relative quiet. The July eruptive episode was preceded by several days of measurable expansion of the summit area, heightened earthquake activity, and changed emission rates of sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide. The first hit at 5:14 pm as an ash column shot and was followed by a faster blast at 6:25 pm that pushed the ash column above its previous maximum height in just 7.5 minutes. The final explosion started at 7:01 pm, and continued over two hours. When the relatively small amount of ash settled over eastern Washington, the dome built in June was gone.

Seismic activity and gas emission steadily increased in early August, and on August 7 at 4:26 pm, an ash cloud slowly expanded into the sky. Small pyroclastic flows came through the northern breach and a weaker outpouring of ash rose from the crater. This continued until 10:32 pm, when a second large blast sent ash high into the air, proceeding due north. A second dacite dome filled this vent a few days later.

Two months of repose were ended by an eruption lasting from October 16 to 18. This event obliterated the second dome, sent ash 10 mi in the air and created small, red-hot pyroclastic flows. A third dome began to form within 30 minutes after the final explosion on October 18, and within a few days, it was about wide and high. In spite of the dome growth next to it, a new glacier formed rapidly inside the crater.

All of the post-1980 eruptions were quiet dome-building events, beginning with the December 27, 1980, to January 3, 1981, episode. By 1987, the third dome had grown to be more than wide and high.

Further eruptions occurred over a few months between 1989 and 1991.

===2004–2008===
The 2004–2008 volcanic activity of Mount St. Helens has been documented as a continuous eruption with a gradual extrusion of magma at the Mount St. Helens volcano. Starting in October 2004, a gradual building of a new lava dome happened. The new dome did not rise above the crater created by the 1980 eruption. This activity lasted until January 2008.

<text>Clement Calhoun Young (April 28, 1869 – December 24, 1947) was an American educator and politician who was affiliated with the original Progressive Party and later the Republican Party. He was elected to five consecutive terms in the California State Assembly, serving from 1909 to 1919, then as the 28th lieutenant governor of California, holding that office from 1919 to 1927. In the 1926 general election, he was elected in a landslide victory as the 26th governor of California and served from 1927 to 1931. Young is considered to have been one of the last governors from the Progressive movement.

==Biography==

Born in Lisbon, New Hampshire, Young moved to California at an early age, and graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 1892. After his graduation, Young embarked on a career as a high school teacher, teaching in Santa Rosa from 1892 to 1893 and then at Lowell High School in San Francisco from 1893 to 1906, heading the school&#x27;s English department. While at Lowell, Young actively participated in the National Education Association, attending and speaking at its conferences, including giving a speech entitled &quot;The Use of a Library&quot; at the association&#x27;s conference in Los Angeles in 1899, arguing for greater cooperation between public schools and public libraries. Students at Lowell popularly nicknamed Young &quot;C-Square,&quot; due to his initializing of his first and middle names, Clement Calhoun. In 1904, Young, along with Charles Mills Gayley, published &quot;The Principles and Progress of English Poetry&quot;. published and distributed by the Macmillan Company.

While teaching, he established his home in Berkeley, where he lived until his death, except for the years he served as governor.

Young was a close friend of realtor and conservationist Duncan McDuffie, and worked for Mason-McDuffie, a real estate general partnership based in Berkeley. Young would work or consult for Mason-McDuffie until 1944. He also helped McDuffie, who had served as president of the Save the Redwoods League and Sierra Club, establish the State Parks system upon his election as governor.

After his departure from Lowell in 1906, Young became involved in state politics. In 1908, he was elected to the California State Assembly for the district that included Berkeley. In the Assembly, Young became a political ally of governor Hiram Johnson and quickly rose through the chamber&#x27;s ranks, becoming Assembly Speaker in 1913. In the following year&#x27;s legislative elections, Young was elected as a member of the Progressive Party. His flirtation with the party lasted for a single term before its dissolution in 1916 and he quickly returned to Republican ranks, though he remained sympathetic to the Progressive movement for much of the rest of his political career.

In the 1918 general elections, Young won the race for Lieutenant Governor of California, a position to which he was re-elected in 1922. In the 1920 U.S. presidential election, Young was a member of the Electoral College.

By 1926, frustration within inner Republican ranks with the fiscally conservative governorship of Friend Richardson had reached its zenith. In the gubernatorial primary election, Progressive Republicans overcame conservative and corporate opposition to win the nomination for Young, knocking Richardson out of the general election. In the 1926 general election campaign, Young earned vocal support from former governor Hiram Johnson and prominent banker Amadeo Giannini. Young won in a landslide, garnering 71.3 percent of the vote and crushing his rivals, who included Democrat Justus S. Wardell and Socialist author Upton Sinclair.

==Governor==
Beginning his governorship on January 4, 1927, Young&#x27;s agenda included reorganizing the state&#x27;s various commissions and departments into his cabinet to better coordinate state governmental affairs. &quot;Some system like this would, I believe, be far more businesslike and effective than such haphazard and infrequent consultations as must otherwise normally take place between a Governor and our numerous unrelated boards and commissions,&quot; Young said.

Among his other priorities were: the financing of the state highway system through a fuel tax rather than by state bonds; more clearly defined roles for the State Board of Education and the California State Superintendent of Public Instruction to eliminate conflicting duties; upholding the direct primary; and the creation of penal facilities specifically for convicted females, believing that &quot;San Quentin is no place for our women prisoners.&quot;

In his first year of office, Young signed a bill passed by the California State Legislature authorizing the creation of a California State Parks Commission. Headed by Frederick Law Olmsted Jr., the survey commission investigated lands across the state suitable for state protection and developed plans for their future financing. A year later in a voter initiative supported by Young, state voters approved the creation of the California State Park system.

In late June 1927, Young personally intervened for Charlotte Anita Whitney, a member of the Communist Party of the United States, who had been convicted under the 1919 Criminal Syndicalism Act passed under Governor William Stephens. In 1919, Whitney had been arrested in Oakland after defying civic authorities in making a speech in behalf of John McHugh, a member of the Industrial Workers of the World. The anti-syndicalism law used to prosecute her had recently been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court which held that threats of violence against the state and individuals did not constitute free speech and was not protected by the First Amendment. Following the high court&#x27;s decision, Young granted Whitney an unconditional pardon, believing that putting her into a cell was &quot;unthinkable.&quot; Young added that the law under which she was convicted was undoubtedly constitutional, but that &quot;abnormal conditions attending the trial&quot; greatly influenced the jury and that &quot;under ordinary circumstances&quot; the case never would have been prosecuted.

On November 23, 1927, inmates at Folsom Prison rioted, taking control of a majority of the interior facilities, and took several prison guards as hostages. Young responded by mobilizing the California Army National Guard, ordering commanders to encircle the prison with their units, supported by heavy machine guns and two tanks shipped by train from Salinas. The heavy show of military force in full view of the rioters forced the revolting prisoners to capitulate peacefully.

In 1928, starring alongside British actor Ronald Colman, Young appeared in the film short &quot;Governor C.C. Young Hails Greater Talkie Season&quot;, appealing to early talking picture audiences to attend family-friendly movies and to ignore films that depicted negative images of society.

In 1929, Young signed the law creating the California Highway Patrol.

In October 1929, Young, along with President Herbert Hoover, established the Hoover-Young San Francisco Bay Bridge Commission to investigate the feasibility of a bridge linking the East Bay to San Francisco, supported by his Director of Public Works, Bert Meek, an engineer and surveyor. The commission submitted its report in August 1930, concluding that not only was the bridge necessary to the development of the area, but that it was &quot;entirely feasible from economic and construction viewpoints.&quot; The San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge eventually was completed and opened to traffic in late 1936.

Following a strike by Mexican agricultural laborers in the Imperial Valley in 1928, Young commissioned an investigation on the status of working conditions for Mexicans. The investigation&#x27;s findings, presented to Young in 1930, concluded that Mexican immigrants made up a majority of farm labor, had supplanted other immigrant groups and were now doing the work white European Americans would not do. The report also outlined that many labor contracting practices, including the withholding of 25 percent of immigrant farm labor salaries, were likely to be illegal.

Despite Young&#x27;s Progressive credentials, Progressive attitudes towards the governor soured in 1929 after Young&#x27;s appointee as state Superintendent of Banks, Will C. Wood, approved the merger between Amadeo Giannini&#x27;s Bank of Italy with Orra E. Monnette&#x27;s Bank of America. While Young denied that Giannini&#x27;s support of his gubernatorial candidacy in 1926 was the reason for his support of the merger, his decision did not sit well with Progressives, who viewed economic conglomerations with suspicion. In 1930, constitutional restrictions on corporations were repealed.

The loss of support for Young among Progressives, along with the beginning of the Great Depression, severely hurt his chances of being re-nominated for a second term as governor. Despite campaign slogans that included &quot;Re-Elect C.C. Young - He Left $31 Million in the Treasury,&quot; Young was defeated by James Rolph, the charismatic Mayor of San Francisco, in the Republican party&#x27;s primary election in 1930.

Following Rolph&#x27;s death shortly before the 1934 gubernatorial election, Young again sought the Republican nomination, but lost the primary election to Rolph&#x27;s successor, Frank Merriam.

==Post-governorship==
Young attended the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, where he met and congratulated several of the athletes. Following his 1934 defeat, Young retired from politics. He served as the president of the Commonwealth Club of California between 1939 and 1940, and returned to writing, publishing &quot;The Legislature of California&quot;, a study of California legislative politics, in 1943. Until 1944, he devoted much of his working time to Mason-McDuffie, serving as its vice president.

He died on Christmas Eve (December 24), 1947 in Berkeley at the age of 78. His remains are interred at Sunset View Cemetery in El Cerrito.

==Family==
Young was married to Lyla Jeannette Vincent and had two daughters.

<text>William Richard Mueller ( ; born March 17, 1971) is an American former professional baseball third baseman who played in Major League Baseball (MLB). Mueller&#x27;s MLB playing career was spent with the San Francisco Giants (1996–2000, 2002), Chicago Cubs (2001–2002), Boston Red Sox (2003–2005), and Los Angeles Dodgers (2006).

Many of Mueller&#x27;s accolades came during the 2003 season, when he won the American League batting title and a Silver Slugger Award. A switch hitter, he became the only player in major league history to hit one grand slam from both sides of the plate in the same game on July 29, 2003. Mueller was the starting third baseman for the Red Sox&#x27; 2004 World Series championship team that beat the St. Louis Cardinals. Since his playing career, he has served in MLB as a front office assistant and hitting coach.

==Playing career==
Mueller was born in Maryland Heights, Missouri, and attended De Smet Jesuit High School. He attended Southwest Missouri State University, was a four-year starter for the Bears baseball team, and in 2004 inducted into the school&#x27;s athletics hall of fame. He was named the MVC Player of the Year in 1993, and inducted into their hall of fame in 2020.

In 1992, Mueller played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Bourne Braves and was named a league all-star. He was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the 15th round of the 1993 MLB draft.

Mueller made his professional debut with the Giants low A team, the Everett Giants, in 1993 and quickly rose through the Giants farm system, with stops in San Jose, Shreveport, and Phoenix before making his major league debut with the Giants as a pinch hitter on April 18, 1996, against the Chicago Cubs. He got his first career hit the following day, also as a pinch hitter, against Terry Adams.

Mueller played third base for the Giants fairly regularly for five seasons, until he was traded to the Chicago Cubs before the 2001 season for pitcher Tim Worrell. (Given that Mueller had by then settled into the Bay Area year-round, the Giants, out of respect for Mueller, delayed the trade several days so that Mueller could attend the Cal-Stanford football game one last time as a local star.) He returned to San Francisco in September 2002 in a trade for minor league pitcher Jeff Verplancke. Before the 2003 season, Mueller was signed by the Boston Red Sox as a free agent. In his first year in Boston, he won the American League batting title with a .326 average. He also set career highs with 45 doubles and 19 home runs. Before 2003, he had never hit more than 10 home runs or 29 doubles in any season.

He contributed nearly half of his career home runs during his three years with the Red Sox. Mueller developed a reputation for consistency throughout the major leagues. For five of his ten years in the major leagues, his batting average was between .290 and .295. His minor league numbers were very much the same, consistently between .290 and .310.

Mueller joined the Los Angeles Dodgers for the 2006 season and was reunited with former Boston teammate Nomar Garciaparra, but played only 32 games before undergoing his third knee surgery, which would prove to be career-ending. Doctors ruled out all known procedures to repair the deteriorating condition in his right knee.

In 1,216 games over 11 seasons, Mueller posted a .291 batting average (1229-for-4223) with 663 runs, 265 doubles, 22 triples, 85 home runs, 493 RBI, 543 bases on balls, .373 on-base percentage and .425 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .958 fielding percentage playing at third and second base. In 36 postseason games, he hit .234 (34-for-145) with 14 runs, eight doubles, one home run, four RBI and 13 walks.

==Coaching career==
On November 17, 2006, the Dodgers announced that Mueller was retiring as a baseball player, and had been hired as a special assistant to the general manager.

On June 15, 2007, Mueller was named Los Angeles Dodgers interim hitting coach when Eddie Murray was fired. After a month on the job, manager Grady Little announced that the Dodgers would be removing the &quot;interim&quot; tag and that Mueller would remain the teams&#x27;s hitting coach through the end of the season.

After the season, it was announced that Mueller would be giving up his role as hitting coach to return to a front office position.

Mueller served as a special assistant to General Manager Ned Colletti through the 2012 season, when he left that position to become a full-time scout.

On November 22, 2013, Mueller was named hitting coach of the Chicago Cubs under new manager Rick Renteria. On October 7, 2014, he subsequently resigned that position, a week after his assistant, Mike Brumley, was dismissed by the Cubs.

On November 17, 2014, Cardinals GM John Mozeliak announced &quot;We have an upcoming deal with Billy Mueller.&quot; on the hiring of a Cardinals new assistant hitting coach.

Mueller was named the first-base coach after third-base coach Jose Oquendo was placed on medical leave of absence on March 27, 2016. After being named assistant hitting coach for the 2017 season, he missed part of the first half after taking a personal leave of absence, but returned on June 27. Mueller was fired by the Cardinals along with manager Mike Matheny on July 14, 2018.

On January 17, 2022, Mueller was hired by the Washington Nationals as part of the team&#x27;s player development staff.

On January 19, 2024, Mueller was hired as the assistant hitting coach for the Miami Marlins. On October 2, 2024, Mueller was fired alongside the entirety of the Marlins coaching staff.

==Personal life==
Mueller became an evangelical Christian in 2000.

==Highlights==
*Was the American League batting champion in 2003 with a batting average of .326, mostly batting eighth.
*Won the American League Silver Slugger Award for third basemen in 2003.
*On July 29, 2003, visiting the Texas Rangers, he hit three home runs in one game, two of which were grand slams. Mueller became the twelfth player in major league history to hit two grand slams in a single game, but the first ever to hit one from each side of the plate, which has never been repeated. The grand slams also came in consecutive at-bats.
*Hit a dramatic game-winning walk-off home run on July 24, 2004, against the New York Yankees. The game had been a seesaw battle featuring a bench-clearing brawl in which Boston catcher Jason Varitek and Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez famously clashed after Bronson Arroyo hit Rodríguez with a curveball. The game appeared to be another devastating loss for the then stagnant Red Sox, but in the bottom of the ninth, with the Red Sox down a run and Yankees closer Mariano Rivera on the mound, Mueller hit a 3–1 pitch into the Red Sox bullpen in right field, winning the game for the Red Sox. Many baseball analysts considered this game to be the turning point in the Red Sox 2004 season, in which they went on to win the World Series.
*Made a significant number of contributions to the Red Sox&#x27;s World Series win in 2004. The most notable was his critical RBI single in the ninth inning of Game 4 against the Yankees in the American League Championship Series. Down 4–3 in the ninth inning and facing elimination, Kevin Millar drew a walk from closer Mariano Rivera. Dave Roberts came in to pinch run for Millar and stole second base. Mueller singled him home and the Red Sox went on to win in 12 innings, beginning their run of eight straight wins, culminating in the title.
*With his former team, the Boston Red Sox, down three games to two in the 2007 American League Championship Series, Bill Mueller was brought in to throw out the ceremonial first pitch of game six to bring back a little of the magic that his hit against the Yankees in 2004 had brought. The Red Sox went on to win the game 12–2, the ALCS 4–3, and the World Series.
*Held a .455 career batting average against Mariano Rivera. Was nicknamed &quot;The Rivera Slayer&quot;.

<text>Angel Heart is a 1987 neo-noir supernatural psychological horror film, an adaptation of William Hjortsberg&#x27;s 1978 novel &quot;Falling Angel&quot;. The film was written and directed by Alan Parker, and stars Mickey Rourke, Robert De Niro, Lisa Bonet, and Charlotte Rampling. It is an international co-production film between the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada. Harry Angel (Rourke), a New York City private investigator, is hired to solve the disappearance of a man known as Johnny Favorite. His investigation takes him to New Orleans, where he becomes embroiled in a series of brutal murders.

Following publication of the novel, Hjortsberg began developing the screenplay for a film adaptation, but found that no major studio was willing to produce his script. The project resurfaced in 1985, when producer Elliott Kastner brought the book to Parker&#x27;s attention. Parker began work on a new script and in doing so made several changes from Hjortsberg&#x27;s novel. He also met with Mario Kassar and Andrew G. Vajna, who agreed to finance the $18 million production through their independent film studio Carolco Pictures. Filming took place on location in New York City and New Orleans, with principal photography lasting from March 1986 to June of that year.

Weeks before its theatrical release, &quot;Angel Heart&quot; faced censorship issues from the Motion Picture Association of America for one scene of sexual content. Parker was forced to remove ten seconds of footage to avoid an X rating and secure the R rating that the film&#x27;s distributor Tri-Star Pictures wanted. An unrated version featuring the removed footage was later released on home video.

&quot;Angel Heart&quot; received a mixed reaction from reviewers, who praised the performances of Rourke and Bonet, as well as the production design, score, and cinematography, but criticized Parker&#x27;s screenwriting. The film underperformed at the North American box office, grossing $17.2 million during its theatrical run, but has since been regarded as underappreciated and influential.

==Plot==
In 1955, New York City private investigator Harry Angel is contacted by a man named Louis Cyphre to track down John Liebling, a crooner known professionally as Johnny Favorite who suffered neurological trauma, resulting from injuries received in World War II. Favorite&#x27;s incapacity disrupted a contract with Cyphre regarding unspecified collateral. Cyphre believes that a private hospital where Favorite was receiving radical psychiatric treatment for shell shock has falsified records.

At the hospital, Harry discovers that the records showing Favorite&#x27;s transfer were indeed falsified by physician Albert Fowler. After Harry breaks into his home, Fowler admits that years before he was bribed by a man and woman so that the two could abscond with the disfigured Favorite. Believing that Fowler is withholding information, Harry locks him in his bedroom, forcing him to suffer withdrawal from a morphine addiction. Hours later, he finds that Fowler has apparently killed himself.

Harry tries to break his contract with Cyphre but agrees to continue the search when Cyphre offers him more money. He discovers that Favorite had a wealthy fiancée named Margaret Krusemark but had also begun a secret affair with a woman named Evangeline Proudfoot. Harry travels to New Orleans and meets with Margaret, who says that Favorite is dead, or at least dead to her. Evangeline died years before but is survived by her 17-year-old daughter, Epiphany, who was conceived during her mother&#x27;s affair with Favorite.

When Epiphany is reluctant to speak, Harry tracks down Toots Sweet, a guitarist and former Favorite bandmate. After Harry uses force to try to extract details of Favorite&#x27;s last known whereabouts, Toots refers him back to Margaret. The following morning, police detectives inform Harry that Toots has been murdered. Harry returns to Margaret&#x27;s home and finds her murdered, her heart removed with a ceremonial knife. He is later attacked by enforcers of Ethan Krusemark — a powerful Louisiana patriarch and Margaret&#x27;s father — who tell him to leave town.

At his hotel, Harry finds Epiphany. He invites her into his room, where they have sex during which Harry has visions of blood dripping from the ceiling and splashing around the room. He later confronts Krusemark in a gumbo hut, where the latter reveals that he and Margaret were the ones who took Favorite from the hospital. Favorite was actually a powerful occultist who sold his soul to Satan in exchange for stardom. He got his stardom but then sought to renege on the bargain. To do so, he kidnapped a young soldier from Times Square, who was of his exact same age and strongly resembled him, and performed a Satanic ritual on the boy, murdering him and eating his still-beating heart to steal his soul. Favorite planned to assume the identity of the murdered soldier but was drafted and then injured overseas. Suffering severe facial trauma and amnesia, he was sent to the hospital for treatment.

After Krusemark and his daughter took him from the hospital, they left him at Times Square on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1943 (the date on the falsified hospital records). While hearing Krusemark&#x27;s story, Harry runs into the bathroom, vomits and continually asks the identity of the soldier. He returns to find Krusemark drowned in a cauldron of boiling gumbo.

At Margaret&#x27;s home, Harry finds a vase containing the soldier&#x27;s dog tag — stamped with the name &quot;Angel, Harold&quot;. Harry realizes that he and Johnny Favorite are actually the same person. Louis Cyphre, whose name is a homophone for Lucifer, appears. His true nature revealed, Cyphre proclaims that he can now claim what is his: Favorite&#x27;s soul. Harry insists that he knows who he is and has never killed anyone, but as he looks at his reflection in a mirror, his repressed memories showing him killing Fowler, Toots, the Krusemarks, and Epiphany come flooding back.

A frantic Harry returns to his hotel room, where the police have found Epiphany murdered. Harry&#x27;s dog tags are on her body. A police officer enters the room carrying Epiphany&#x27;s young son, who Harry realizes is his grandchild. Harry sees the child&#x27;s eyes glow, just as Cyphre&#x27;s had at their last meeting, implying that Satan is the mysterious entity that impregnated Epiphany. Harry later stands inside an elevator that is interminably descending, presumably to Hell. Cyphre whispers, &quot;Harry&quot; and &quot;Johnny&quot;, asserting dominion over both their souls.

==Production==

===Development===

Following publication of his 1978 novel &quot;Falling Angel&quot;, William Hjortsberg began work on a film adaptation. His friend, production designer Richard Sylbert, took the book&#x27;s manuscript to producer Robert Evans. The film rights to the novel had been optioned by Paramount Pictures, with Evans slated to produce the film, John Frankenheimer hired to direct, and Hjortsberg acting as screenwriter. Frankenheimer was later replaced by Dick Richards, and Dustin Hoffman was being considered for the lead role. After Paramount&#x27;s option expired, Hjortsberg discussed the project with Robert Redford and wrote two drafts. Hjortsberg, however, felt that no film studio was willing to produce his script. He reflected, &quot;Even with [Redford] behind the script, studio executives weren&#x27;t interested. &#x27;Why can&#x27;t it have a happy ending?&#x27; every bigshot demanded.&quot;

In 1985, producer Elliott Kastner met with Alan Parker at Pinewood Studios to discuss a film adaptation of the novel. Parker, who had read the book following its publication, agreed to write the screenplay. He met with Hjortsberg in London before moving to New York City, where he wrote most of the script. After completing the first draft in September 1985, Parker traveled to Rome, Italy, where he brought the script to Mario Kassar and Andrew G. Vajna. The two producers agreed to finance the film through their independent film studio, Carolco Pictures, and Parker was given creative control. Pre-production work on &quot;Angel Heart&quot; began in January 1986 in New York, where Parker selected the creative team, reuniting with several of his past collaborators, including producer Alan Marshall, director of photography Michael Seresin, camera operator Michael Roberts, production designer Brian Morris and editor Gerry Hambling.

===Writing===
Parker made several changes from the novel. He titled his script &quot;Angel Heart&quot; as he wanted to distance his film adaptation from the source material. While &quot;Falling Angel&quot; is set entirely in New York City, Parker had the second half of his script take place in New Orleans, based on the novel&#x27;s perpetual allusions to voodoo and the occult. He discussed the story-setting change to Hjortsberg, who approved of the decision; the author revealed to Parker that he had also thought of setting his novel in New Orleans. &quot;Angel Heart&quot; is set in the year 1955, whereas in the book the events take place in 1959. He explained, &quot;The book is set in 1959 and I moved it to 1955 for a small but selfish reason. 1959 was on the way to the 1960s with its changing attitudes as well as environments. 1955 for me still belonged to the 1940s—and, because of the historical pause button of World War II, conceivably the 1930s—so quite simply, setting it in this year allowed me to give an older look to the film.&quot;

Other script changes from the novel involved characterization and dialogue. Parker sought to make Harry Angel a character that evoked sympathy. He said, &quot;In the tradition of the down-at-heel gumshoe, his phlegmatic surface disguised an intelligence capable of unraveling a complicated, larger-than-life story with a degree of belief and conciseness. Also he had to be attractive to audiences while enlightening them, little by little, along the way.&quot; Parker also established Angel as being born on February 14—Valentine&#x27;s Day—the same date as his own birthday. He explained that it was &quot;for no particular reason other than Valentine&#x27;s Day might be easy to remember in a labyrinthine script and the heart reference seemed to have some resonance&quot;. Parker also wanted to create a realistic depiction of Louis Cyphre, as opposed to the character&#x27;s &quot;larger-than-life&quot; personality in the novel. Another script change involved the ending and the identity of the killer. While Angel is framed for the murders (presumably by Cyphre) in the novel, Parker established the character as the killer for the film&#x27;s ending.

===Casting===

Parker originally wanted Robert De Niro to play the role of Harry Angel, but the actor expressed interest in making a cameo appearance as mysterious benefactor Louis Cyphre. De Niro, however, did not fully commit to the role until after frequent discussions with Parker. The director reflected, &quot;I had been courting [De Niro] to play [Cyphre] in &quot;Angel Heart&quot; for some months and we had met a few times—and he had continued to bombard me with questions examining every dot and comma of my script. I had walked him through the locations we had found, read through the screenplay sitting on the floor of a dank, disused church in Harlem and finally he said ‘yes’.&quot;

Jack Nicholson and Mickey Rourke were also considered for the role of Angel. Parker met with Nicholson in Los Angeles to discuss the project. Nicholson ultimately passed on the role. Parker said, &quot;I did my pitch and he was most gracious, although, to be honest, he was quite distracted at the time... my movie and the possibility of him taking part seemed to slip from his immediate area of concentration and interest.&quot; Parker then met with Rourke, who expressed a strong interest in playing Angel and secured the leading role after a meeting with Parker in New York.

Various actresses auditioned for the role of Epiphany Proudfoot before Lisa Bonet secured the part. Bonet was then known for her role on the family-oriented sitcom &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, and her casting in &quot;Angel Heart&quot; sparked significant controversy. Before securing the role, Bonet discussed it with Bill Cosby, who encouraged her decision to appear in the film. Parker cast Bonet based on the strength of her audition and was unaware of her role on &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;. &quot;I didn&#x27;t hire [Bonet] because of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;&quot;, he said. &quot;I have never even seen the show. I hired her because she was right for the role.&quot; On preparing for the role, Bonet said, &quot;I did a lot of meditation and a lot of self-inquiry. I did some research on voodoo. My earnest endeavor was really to let go of all my inhibitions. It was really necessary for me to be able to let go of Lisa and let Epiphany take over.&quot;

Parker had difficulty finding an actress for the role of Margaret Krusemark. &quot;Although it&#x27;s a small part in the film, the character is omnipresent in the dialogue and [the actress] had to have the right balance of class and eccentricity&quot;, he said. &quot;I read many actresses for the part without much success.&quot; Rourke then suggested English actress Charlotte Rampling, who secured the role after Parker contacted her to discuss the part.

In January 1986, Parker held an open casting call at a New York nightclub known as The Kamikaze, with more than 1,400 people auditioning for various roles. &quot;I managed to read a short scene with 600 of them as they were filtered through to me&quot;, he said. Actress Elizabeth Whitcraft, who had a small role in Parker&#x27;s previous film &quot;Birdy&quot; was cast as Connie, a journalist who aids Angel in his investigation. Parker held another casting call in New Orleans, where he requested that local musicians audition for possible roles in the film. Clarence &quot;Gatemouth&quot; Brown and Deacon John Moore were among the many musicians who auditioned for roles. Moore was cast as Toots Sweet&#x27;s bandmate. Parker then returned to New York, where he auditioned other musicians, including Bo Diddley and Dizzy Gillespie. Blues guitarist Brownie McGhee, who plays Toots Sweet, was cast during the film&#x27;s principal photography.

===Filming===

During the casting process, Parker and producer Alan Marshall began scouting locations in New York City. The director looked at Harlem, believing that the neighborhood was &quot;as un-photographed as other parts of New York are over-used.&quot; On January 20, 1986, he travelled to New Orleans, where he continued writing the script. Parker looked at unused buildings located on Royal Street that would act as a hotel and an abandoned house on Magazine Street that would serve as the home of Margaret Krusemark (Rampling). He returned to New York City, where he looked at Staten Island and Coney Island. Parker&#x27;s script for &quot;Angel Heart&quot; required that a total of 78 locations be used for filming between New York and New Orleans.

Principal photography for &quot;Angel Heart&quot; began on March 31, 1986, and concluded on June 20, 1986, on a budget of $18 million. Filming began in Eldridge Street, Manhattan, New York City, which acted as Harry Angel&#x27;s neighbourhood. Production designer Brian Morris and the set-decorating team spent two months designing the set prior to filming, hoping to recreate 1950s New York. Because of the warm weather conditions, ice trucks were used to create fake snow. Filming then moved to Alphabet City in Manhattan, where several bar scenes and Angel&#x27;s intimate bedroom scene with Connie (Whitcraft) were filmed.

The production then moved to Harlem to film a chase scene set during a procession before moving to Coney Island, where the cast and crew underwent severely cold weather conditions. The location was used to film a scene in which Angel questions a man, Izzy (George Buck), about the whereabouts of Johnny Favorite while Izzy&#x27;s wife Bo (Judith Drake) stands waist deep in the ocean. The original actress who was cast as Bo was injured when she was knocked off her feet by a wave while delivering her first line. The actress refused to reshoot the scene, which led to her being replaced by her stand-in, Drake, whom Parker found to be a better actress for the role.

Production returned to Manhattan to film the opening credits sequence. Filming then moved to Harlem, New York, where a hospice was used to film a scene involving the character Spider Simpson (Charles Gordone), and many of the hospice&#x27;s elderly residents acted as extras for the scene. On April 17, 1986, the production team moved to Staten Island to film exterior and interior scenes involving the character Dr. Fowler (Michael Higgins). Filming then moved to Hoboken, New Jersey, which doubled for a scene set in a New Orleans train station. From April 28 to April 29, 1986, the &quot;Angel Heart&quot; production team returned to Harlem, where Parker filmed Rourke and De Niro&#x27;s scene in a Harlem mission. The two actors next filmed a scene at Lanza&#x27;s, an Italian restaurant located on the Lower East Side.

By May 3, 1986, production had moved to New Orleans. In the town of Thibodaux, Louisiana, Parker and his crew discovered an entire plantation workers&#x27; village that would serve as a graveyard. He said, &quot;We had the good fortune to find an entire plantation workers’ village almost intact and, with careful dressing, this became Epiphany&#x27;s world. The graveyard was a dressed set, but much of what we filmed was already there.&quot; An unused Louisiana field was used to create a racetrack where Angel meets the wealthy patriarch Ethan Krusemark (Fontelieu). On May 13, the crew encountered some difficulty filming a chase scene involving Angel, as they had to deal with shying horses, trained dogs, gunshots, two hundred chickens, and a horse specially trained to fall on top of Rourke&#x27;s stuntman.

Production then moved to Magazine Street, where production designer Brian Morris and the art department attempted to recreate 1950s New Orleans. Parker said of the set, &quot;As in New York, we had dressed and clad every single storefront as far as the eye could see in order to be authentic to the period, and drained everything of all primary colours for our monochromatic look.&quot; Filming then moved to Jackson Square where the crew filmed one of the final scenes, in which Angel runs from Margaret&#x27;s home. The production then filmed a voodoo ceremony scene choreographed by Louis Falco. Falco, who had previously choreographed Parker&#x27;s 1980 film &quot;Fame&quot;, based the scene on an actual Haitian ceremony.

The sex scene involving Rourke and Bonet was filmed in one of the unused buildings located on Royal Street and took four hours to shoot. Parker limited the crew to himself, cinematographer Michael Seresin, camera operator Michael Roberts, and the camera assistant. To make the actors more comfortable, Parker played music during the shoot. Production then moved to a corner of New Orleans, which doubled for flashback sequences set in 1943 Times Square, New York. The crew then discovered an unused bus depot, which was used to film scenes set in Ethan Krusemark&#x27;s gumbo hut. Filming then moved to the St. Alphonsus Church, where the crew filmed a dialogue scene between Angel and Cyphre. Production returned to Royal Street in the French Quarter, where the final confrontation between Angel and Cyphre and the film&#x27;s ending were shot.

===Editing and censorship===
After filming concluded in June 1986, Parker spent four months editing the film in Europe, with 400,000 feet of film and 1,100 different shots. The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) gave the original cut of &quot;Angel Heart&quot; an X rating, which is widely associated with pornographic films. The board, composed of industry executives and theater owners, expressed concerns over several seconds of the sex scene involving Rourke and Bonet in which Rourke&#x27;s buttocks are seen thrusting in a sexual motion. Parker appealed the rating but did not receive the two-thirds vote required to reclassify the film to an R rating.

The film&#x27;s distributor Tri-Star Pictures refused to release it with an X rating, as the film would have fewer theaters willing to book it and fewer venues for advertising; Steve Randall, executive vice president of marketing for Tri-Star, stated that it was the studio&#x27;s &quot;firm policy not to release an X-rated film.&quot; With only a few weeks before the film&#x27;s release, the studio was desperate for the less-restrictive R rating, but Parker was reluctant to alter the film. He filed another appeal, on which the board voted 8 to 6 in favor of the X rating. Parker then removed ten seconds of sexual content from the scene. &quot;That scene was very complex, very intricate, and the cutting quite rapid, involving 60 to 80 cuts in the space of about two minutes&quot;, he said. &quot;Eventually, I cut only 10 seconds from the scene, or about 14 feet of film.&quot; On February 24, 1987, the film was granted an R rating. Parker later stated that the MPAA&#x27;s concerns led to &quot;a wasteful, pointless and expensive exercise&quot;.

===Music===
The score was produced and composed by Trevor Jones, with saxophone solos by British jazz musician Courtney Pine. Parker hired Jones based on his work for the 1986 film &quot;Runaway Train&quot;. After meeting with the director, Jones viewed a rough cut version of the film. He stated, &quot;When I sat in the screening room all by myself and began to see those images, I was shaking like a puppy when the movie ended and when I got out of the room I told [Parker] that it was a great picture, but that I didn’t understand what exactly he wanted from me. He told me that he expected me to deliver something special to the picture and… to approach the movie from whenever I chose.&quot;

For the score, Jones wanted to explore the concept of evil, explaining, &quot;Evil is the greatest of human fears… I tried to give that feeling to the score using daily ordinary music that would bridge the world of [Harry Angel] to that which he&#x27;s getting into, the black magic, his search. It was like a psychological journey for me always trying to relate to the fears and emotions of the audience.&quot; He composed the score electronically on a Synclavier. Parker chose Glen Gray&#x27;s 1937 song &quot;Girl of My Dreams&quot; as a recurring song performed by the unseen character Johnny Favorite. He wanted the song to act as a motif that would haunt viewers as it had haunted Harry Angel. Jones incorporated elements of the song into his score.

In addition to Jones&#x27;s compositions, the soundtrack features a number of blues and R&amp;B performances, including &quot;Honeyman Blues&quot; by Bessie Smith, and &quot;Soul on Fire&quot; by LaVern Baker. Brownie McGhee performed the songs &quot;The Right Key, but the Wrong Keyhole&quot; and &quot;Rainy Rainy Day&quot; for the film, with Lilian Boutte acting as a vocalist. Jones stated, &quot;…the main bulk of the score was worked on with a Synclavier. Basically there were two types of music, one was the electronic stuff from the Synclavier that [Parker] wanted, and the real jazz musicians. The two work very well together in view of the film&#x27;s intent.&quot;

During post-production, Jones mixed the music tracks at Angel Recording Studios, a recording studio built in an abandoned church in Islington, North London, with final mixing taking place at Warner Hollywood Studios in Los Angeles. Parker said, &quot;One of the great advantages of working with contemporary recording techniques is that we can mix onto film in a recording studio with all of the various components and options of modern, multi-track recordings. I’ve always been very mistrustful of conventional scoring, whereby a hundred musicians sit in front of the projected film and the conductor strikes up the orchestra.&quot; A motion picture soundtrack album was released by the recording labels Antilles Records and Island Records.

==Release==

In North America, &quot;Angel Heart&quot; opened in wide release on March 6, 1987, distributed by Tri-Star Pictures. The film debuted at number four at the weekend box office, garnering ticket sales of $3,688,721 from 815 screens, with an average of $4,526 per theatre. The film&#x27;s overall domestic gross was $17.2 million, against a production budget of $18 million.

==Reception==
The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gave &quot;Angel Heart&quot; a score of 82% based on a sample of 33 reviews, with an average score of 7.4/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Angel Heart&quot; lures viewers into its disturbing, brutal mystery with authentic noir flair and a palpably hypnotic mood&quot;. William Hjortsberg, author of &quot;Falling Angel&quot;, voiced his support of the film adaptation, stating, &quot;[Alan] Parker wrote an excellent script and went on to make a memorable film. Casting Robert De Niro as Cyphre was a brilliant touch.&quot; Although initially supportive of Bonet&#x27;s decision to appear in the film, Bill Cosby dismissed &quot;Angel Heart&quot; as &quot;a movie made by white America that cast a black girl, gave her voodoo things to do and have sex&quot;.

Initial reactions among film critics were mixed; &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; indicated that reviewers generally praised Rourke&#x27;s performance, as well as the score, cinematography, and production design, while criticism was aimed at Parker&#x27;s screenwriting for being convoluted and exposition-heavy. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the cinematography and production design, but criticized Rourke&#x27;s performance as being &quot;suitably intense, but to such little effect&quot;. Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that &quot;Angel Heart&quot; &quot;is over-stylized, and we&#x27;re over-stimulated when the soundtrack goes berserk, from a few thumpity-thumps to a visceral, ventricles a-pumping score&quot;. Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; criticized Parker&#x27;s direction: &quot;There&#x27;s no way to separate the occult from the incomprehensible... Parker simply doesn&#x27;t have the gift of making evil seductive, and he edits like a flasher.&quot; Kael also criticized De Niro&#x27;s cameo appearance, writing, &quot;It&#x27;s the sort of guest appearance that lazy big actors delight in—they can show up the local talent.&quot;

On the syndicated television program &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert &amp; the Movies&quot;, Gene Siskel gave &quot;Angel Heart&quot; a &quot;thumbs down&quot;, while his colleague Roger Ebert praised the film and gave it a &quot;thumbs up&quot;. In his review for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Siskel wrote that &quot;Parker seems more concerned with style and with hiding the film&#x27;s big mystery than with pacing.&quot; Siskel also criticized the film&#x27;s controversial sex scene for not being &quot;as shocking as the rating board would have you believe.&quot;

Ebert, writing for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, gave the film three and a half stars out of four, writing that &quot;&quot;Angel Heart&quot; is a thriller and a horror movie, but most of all it&#x27;s an exuberant exercise in style, in which Parker and his actors have fun taking it to the limit&quot;. Ian Nathan of &quot;Empire&quot; called the film &quot;A diabolical treat with Rourke and De Niro in top form.&quot; Almar Haflidason of the BBC wrote, &quot;The movie maintains intrigue at every turn and Rourke is spellbinding. Robert De Niro, Charlotte Rampling, and the assembled cast are all excellent. But this is Mickey Rourke&#x27;s movie, and he puts in a mesmerising performance.&quot; Richard Luck, writing for Film4, concluded in his review, &quot;The book&#x27;s so good it deserves a better movie, but Rourke&#x27;s performance is such that &quot;Angel Heart&quot; stands out from the necromancy movie crowd.&quot;

Filmmaker Christopher Nolan stated the film was a major influence on his 2000 film &quot;Memento&quot;: &quot;In terms of &quot;Memento&quot;, Alan Parker films such as &quot;Angel Heart&quot; and &quot;The Wall&quot;, which use very interesting editing techniques such as a fractured narrative, were a big influence.&quot;

The plot and atmosphere of Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers was inspired by the film. 

In 2010, &quot;Wired&quot; magazine ranked the film at number 22 on their list of &quot;The 25 Best Horror Films of All Time&quot;, and in 2012, Mark Hughes, writing for &quot;Forbes&quot;, ranked &quot;Angel Heart&quot; at number nine on his list of the &quot;Top 10 Best Cult Classic Horror Movies of All Time&quot;. &quot;Den of Geek&quot; writer Ryan Lambie ranked the film at number six on his list of &quot;The Top 20 Underappreciated Films of 1987&quot;, writing that &quot;Parker brings a wonderfully shadowy quality to his noir thriller, which takes in New York and New Orleans. Some viewers may be able to predict where this twisty, murky thriller&#x27;s going to take them, but the ride remains one worth taking thanks to the quality of the acting and direction.&quot; Film critic Tim Dirks of the film-review website Filmsite.org added the film to his list of films featuring the &quot;Greatest Film Plot Twists, Film Spoilers and Surprise Endings&quot;, based on two of the film&#x27;s major plot twists—Harry Angel being revealed as Johnny Favorite, and Louis Cyphre revealing himself as Lucifer. &quot;Screen Rant&quot; writer Tim Butters rated Robert De Niro&#x27;s performance &quot;One of the 10 Best Movie Depictions of the Devil&quot;.

===Accolades===
&quot;Angel Heart&quot; received several awards and nominations following its release. At the 10th Jupiter Awards, Mickey Rourke won a Jupiter Award for Best International Actor for his performances in both &quot;Angel Heart&quot; and &quot;A Prayer for the Dying&quot; (1987). At the 9th Youth in Film Awards, Lisa Bonet won the Young Artist Award for Best Young Female Superstar in Motion Pictures. At the 15th Saturn Awards, &quot;Angel Heart&quot; received three Saturn Award nominations, though it failed to win any.
===Home video===
&quot;Angel Heart&quot; was released on VHS on September 24, 1987, by International Video Entertainment (IVE). The releases included the R-rated theatrical cut and an uncut version which restored the ten seconds of sexual content that was removed to satisfy the MPAA. Ralph King, senior vice president of IVE, said, &quot;The scene cut from &quot;Angel Heart&quot; is both provocative and shocking, but it is by no means pornographic. We&#x27;re pleased to give the public the opportunity to see the film as Alan Parker originally meant the film to be viewed.&quot;

The film was first released on DVD on June 23, 1998, by Artisan Entertainment. Special features on the DVD included a theatrical trailer, production notes, a making-of featurette, and information on the cast and crew. The DVD release received criticism for its poor video transfer and shortage of special features. Artisan later released the film on laserdisc on August 18, 1998. Lionsgate Home Entertainment re-released &quot;Angel Heart&quot; with a &quot;Special Edition&quot; DVD on May 18, 2004. The Special Edition features additional material, including an introduction and audio commentary by Parker, a scene-specific commentary by Rourke, a video interview with the actor, and the theatrical trailer. Lionsgate released the film on Blu-ray on November 24, 2009. The Blu-ray presents the film in 1080p high definition and contains all the additional materials found on the Special Edition DVD.

On July 12, 2022, Lionsgate released the film on 4K Ultra HD for the first time in the United States.

==TV version==
An edited TV version was produced which removed the more graphic elements of the sex scenes. In particular the sex scene between Mickey Rourke and Lisa Bonet was completely re-edited and featured additional footage that was not included in either the R or Unrated versions. The additional footage features flashbacks of a drunken party with several scantily clad women at the barracks where Johnny Favorite was stationed just prior to it being hit by a series of explosions. The sequence ends with a brief shot of Epiphany Proudfoot&#x27;s (presumably dead) body burning amongst a pile of charred rubble.

==Deleted scenes==

*A graphic sequence in which Herman Winesap is decapitated by the blades of a rotary fan was shot but not used in the final cut.
*When Harry murders Toots Sweet there was additional footage of Harry writing the words &quot;TELOCA&quot; on the wall in the victims blood. The word is taken from the Enochian book of magic, meaning &quot;Damned&quot;.
*Harry&#x27;s girlfriend, the &quot;New York Times&quot; secretary Connie, was originally revealed to have also been murdered, presumably by Harry shortly after their brief encounter, with her corpse being found burned to death.

==Remake==
In 2008, it was announced that producers Michael De Luca, Alison Rosenzweig and Michael Gaeta were developing a planned remake of &quot;Angel Heart&quot; that would be produced by De Luca&#x27;s production banner, Michael De Luca Productions. The producers had optioned the rights to both the film and the novel &quot;Falling Angel&quot;. De Luca expressed that he was a fan of the novel, stating, &quot;It’s a great blend of genres with a great Faustian bargain, compelling, universal themes and a rare combination of literary and commercial appeal.&quot; However, nothing has been heard of this project since a brief Filmstalker article in May 2009.

<doc id="673683" wikidata="Q734643" url="?curid=673683" title="Jim Edgar">
<text>James Robert Edgar (born July 22, 1946) is an American politician who served as the 38th governor of Illinois from 1991 to 1999. A moderate Republican, he previously served in the Illinois House of Representatives from 1977 to 1979 and as the 35th Secretary of State of Illinois from 1981 to 1991.

Edgar was born in Vinita, Oklahoma and raised in Charleston, a city in Central Illinois. Beginning his political career as a legislative aide, he was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives in 1976 and reelected in 1978. In 1979, while still in his second term, Edgar would be appointed as the director of legislative affairs for Illinois Governor Jim Thompson. 

Following Secretary of State Alan J. Dixon&#x27;s election to the U.S. Senate in 1980, Thompson appointed Edgar to serve the remainder of Dixon&#x27;s term. Edgar would go on to win a full term in 1982 and was reelected by a significant margin in 1986 in a race complicated by a LaRouchian candidate on the Democratic ticket. 

Edgar ran successfully for Governor of Illinois in the competitive 1990 election, narrowly defeating incumbent Attorney General Neil Hartigan. During the Republican Revolution of &#x27;94, he won reelection in a landslide over the Democratic Illinois Comptroller Dawn Clark Netsch—winning 101 of the state&#x27;s 102 counties. He declined to run for a third term in 1998 and subsequently retired from public office.

== Early life and education ==
Edgar was born on July 22nd, 1946 in Vinita, Oklahoma to Cecil and Betty Edgar. Cecil, a small-businessman from Charleston, Illinois, died in an automobile accident in 1953, leaving Jim and his two older brothers to be raised by their mother.

To support her children, Betty Edgar worked as a clerk at Eastern Illinois University, where Jim would later attend. While at Eastern, Jim met his future wife Brenda Smith and served as student body president. He graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history in 1968.

Edgar developed an interest in politics at a young age. Though his parents were both Democrats, Edgar became a Republican while in elementary school after following the 1952 campaign of Dwight D. Eisenhower.

A young Rockefeller Republican, Edgar briefly volunteered for the Presidential campaign of Pennsylvania Governor William Scranton in the 1964 Republican Primaries and supported New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller in 1968.

==Early political career==

=== Work in the Illinois General Assembly ===
Following his graduation from college, Edgar served as a legislative intern and then personal assistant to Illinois Senate Republican leader W. Russell Arrington despite his mother&#x27;s wish for him to attend law school. Edgar would later regard the moderate Arrington as his role model.

Following his time with Arrington, Edgar would also work briefly under Illinois House Speaker W. Robert Blair.

===Illinois House of Representatives===

In 1974, Edgar ran unsuccessfully in the Republican nomination for state representative from the 53rd district, coming in third place. After the campaign, Edgar worked as an insurance and cosmetics salesperson before briefly serving the National Conference of State Legislatures in Denver.

He ran for the same seat again two years later in 1976 and won. He was re-elected in 1978.

While in the House, Edgar served on the Appropriations II, Human Resources, and Revenue committees as well as the Illinois Commission on Intergovernmental Cooperation. Due to his moderate policy positions, Edgar was often considered a swing vote, especially on the Human Resources committee.

In April 1979, shortly after winning re-election, Edgar resigned his state House seat to accept an appointment from Governor Jim Thompson to be the governor&#x27;s legislative liaison. Though reluctant at first, Edgar accepted Thompson&#x27;s offer with an unwritten promise that it would lead to Edgar getting a spot on a statewide ticket later on.

== Illinois Secretary of State ==
In January 1981, Governor Thompson announced Edgar&#x27;s appointment as Illinois Secretary of State to fill the vacancy left by incumbent Secretary of State Alan Dixon following his 1980 election to the U.S. Senate. He won re-election twice in 1982 and 1986 with his 1986 re-election against the Illinois Solidarity Party nominee Jane N. Spirgel and the Lyndon LaRouche-backed Democratic nominee Janice A. Hart being the largest statewide margin of victory in Illinois history until the election of Barack Obama to the U.S. Senate in 2004.

During his first term as Secretary of State, Edgar diverged from past practices in the office by keeping many of the Democratic employees hired by his predecessor. He would later comment on his decision by saying &quot;to me, the best politics is good government&quot; and that in his view, as long as the employees did their jobs, he had no interest in firing them regardless of political affiliation.

On policy, Edgar&#x27;s partial term and first full term were largely defined by his work to toughen Illinois&#x27;s drunk driving penalties. This included strengthening breathalyzer requirements for individuals pulled over for possibly driving under the influence and reforming the state&#x27;s legal view of driver&#x27;s licenses to be a &quot;privilege, not a right,&quot; thereby allowing licenses to be administratively suspended pending a court date for potentially driving drunk as opposed to the prior system where drivers retained their licenses until their court date. Edgar also voiced support for a national 21-year-old legal drinking age and was appointed to U.S. President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s Presidential Commission on Drunk Driving in 1982. 

During his second term, Edgar spearheaded a successful legislative battle to pass a bill instituting mandatory automobile insurance for Illinois motorists. Prior to Edgar&#x27;s intervention, the bill had been routinely defeated by the state&#x27;s insurance lobby. Edgar would later pick the Senate sponsor on the bill, Bob Kustra, to serve as his Lieutenant Governor. Edgar also pushed forward an effort to construct a new Illinois State Library as its own building and his efforts to support the State Library during his tenure earned Edgar the nickname of &quot;The Reader&quot; from State Library employees.

=== 1990 Illinois gubernatorial election ===
On August 8th, 1989, Edgar announced his candidacy for Governor of Illinois following incumbent Governor Jim Thompson&#x27;s decision not to run for a fifth term. Despite instantly becoming the Republican Party&#x27;s frontrunner and Thompson&#x27;s heir-apparent, Edgar was challenged in the 1990 primary by perennial candidate Robert Marshall and conservative political activist Steve Baer. Baer, the former executive director of the Illinois Republican Fund, opposed Edgar&#x27;s pro-choice stance on abortion and his support of making permanent a then-temporary 20% income tax in support of the state&#x27;s education system. Edgar won the Republican nomination with a little under 63% of the primary vote.

In the general election, Edgar faced Democrat Neil Hartigan, the incumbent Illinois Attorney General and former Illinois Lieutenant Governor under the state&#x27;s last Democratic Governor Dan Walker. Hartigan, like Baer, opposed making permanent the state&#x27;s 20% education-focused income tax and attacked Edgar as a tax-and-spend politician. In addition to being fiscally conservative, Hartigan was a noted social liberal. He supported abortion rights and other socially liberal causes throughout his time in public life.

Edgar, meanwhile, campaigned on fiscal responsibility for the state and on his character as a consistent leader while attacking Hartigan as being an indecisive policy maker who changed his opinions on issues when it became politically convenient, a perspective that had hurt Hartigan in the past. At one rally towards the end of the campaign, Edgar held up a waffle and joked that it would become the state seal if Hartigan were elected.

Edgar&#x27;s campaign was hindered by a poor national environment for Republicans and a desire amongst the Illinois public for a change in leadership following the previous four terms of Jim Thompson. 

In the two weeks prior to the election, those hindrances paired with poor polling led Edgar to believe he was going to lose, but despite trailing Hartigan for most of election night, Edgar narrowly won the election by a little over 2% of the vote. Edgar&#x27;s close victory occurred alongside the re-election of incumbent U.S. Senator Paul Simon in a Democratic landslide and made Edgar one of only two Republicans to win statewide office in Illinois that year. 

In the election&#x27;s aftermath, a few factors were given credit for Edgar&#x27;s success: first was his successful effort to market himself as a candidate representing change for the state despite being a Republican, second was the Edgar campaign&#x27;s strong get-out-the-vote effort on election day, and third was Edgar&#x27;s unique appeal to groups that were not traditionally a part of the state&#x27;s Republican coalition. 

Despite being attacked for it for most of the campaign, Edgar&#x27;s position on the state income tax benefitted him with Chicago-area Black voters, a number of whom already felt disrespected by Hartigan due to his endorsement of third party candidate Thomas Hynes, a longtime ally of his, in the 1987 Chicago Mayoral election against incumbent Democratic mayor Harold Washington, the city&#x27;s first black mayor. Hartigan worked to regain support in the African American community throughout the race, even bringing in former professional boxer Muhammad Ali to campaign alongside him.

During the campaign, Edgar openly opposed U.S. President George H.W. Bush&#x27;s vetoing of the Civil Rights Act of 1990 and courted the support of prominent Black leaders, especially those involved with the recently-formed Harold Washington Party, gaining endorsements from several including Lu Palmer.

As a result of Hartigan&#x27;s shortcomings and Edgar&#x27;s overtures to these longtime Democratic constituencies, Edgar ran stronger in the Black community than any Republican had in decades, earning a quarter of the black vote in Cook County. Edgar also performed better than Republicans traditionally did amongst Chicago&#x27;s Latino voters, many of whom were already familiar with him thanks to Edgar&#x27;s library and literacy programs while Secretary of State. Edgar&#x27;s gains amongst these traditionally Democratic groups helped negate his losses to Hartigan in more traditionally Republican areas of the state that would have otherwise resulted in a loss.

== Governor of Illinois ==

=== First term (1991–1995) ===

On January 14th, 1991, Edgar took the oath of office as Governor of Illinois and gave a speech focused on fiscal responsibility. During the gubernatorial transition between the 1990 election and his inauguration, Edgar and his staff were made aware of a nearly billion-dollar deficit in state spending that he would have to deal with upon assuming office and though the exact size of the deficit was downplayed by the Illinois State Bureau of the Budget to the public and to the news-media of the time, it was still recognized to be the largest budget deficit in state history up to that point. Then, three weeks following Edgar&#x27;s inauguration, the state began to feel stronger effects of the early 1990s recession, worsening the state&#x27;s financial standing further.

To try and correct the state&#x27;s finances, Edgar&#x27;s first proposed budget for the fiscal year 1992 included no tax increases and extensive cuts to state spending totaling in the millions of dollars—with the exception of education, which received a slight increase. This budget ran into conflict with the Democrat-controlled Illinois General Assembly and a months-long budget fight ensued between Edgar and Illinois House Speaker Mike Madigan over his proposals. After months of negotiations, the two reached a compromise in mid-July that included most of Edgar&#x27;s initial spending cuts, made permanent the temporary income tax increase that had dominated the 1990 campaign, and established property tax caps in all counties except Cook. Edgar would have two more significant budget fights in 1992 and 1993 and the state&#x27;s financial troubles would dominate much of Edgar&#x27;s first term.

In between budget fights, Edgar also sought to reform the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, which had been put under court supervision following an ACLU lawsuit three years prior to Edgar taking office. Policy changes enacted by Edgar included reorienting the department&#x27;s priorities around focusing on the best interests of the children they were dealing with as opposed to keeping families together, toughening standards for private agencies and organizations overseeing child-care, and passing a bipartisan package of welfare reforms in 1994 focused on increasing scrutiny in abuse-related death investigations, establishing methods of stopping child abuse before it occurs, and requiring the department to draft standardized training procedures and guidelines for caseworkers.

On April 24th, 1993, Edgar declared Kane, Lake, and McHenry counties disaster areas due to flooding. This would be the first of many actions Edgar would take to curb the devastation of the Great Flood of 1993, later be regarded as one of the worst natural disasters in Illinois history. Edgar would mobilize over 7,000 members of the Illinois National Guard to flood duty over the course of the disaster and organize hundreds of inmates from the Illinois Department of Corrections to help with sandbagging and levee-reinforcement. Edgar would also help with sandbagging efforts himself throughout the summer.

==== The &quot;Edgar ramp&quot; ====
In 1994, Edgar signed into law Public Act 88-593, a bipartisan compromise bill between Edgar and Illinois House Speaker Mike Madigan to address the state&#x27;s developing pension crisis. Prior to 1981, the State of Illinois funded pensions on an &quot;as-you-go&quot; basis, making benefit payouts as they came due, with employee contributions and investment income funding a reserve to cover future payouts. This approach was stopped in 1982 due to strains on the Illinois budget and state contributions remained flat between 1982 and 1995, resulting in an underfunding of pensions by approximately $20 billion. Public Act 88-593 set out a schedule to raise the state&#x27;s pension funding ratio from the flat then-52% liability to 90% by 2045 with mandatory yearly payments and a 15 year &quot;ramp&quot; period at the start where the state&#x27;s payments would begin low and increase at an escalating rate yearly. It would be from this &quot;ramp&quot; period that the funding plan would gain the colloquial name &quot;the Edgar ramp.&quot; Despite being heralded as a bipartisan success at the time, the &quot;ramp approach&quot; was imperfect at correcting the state&#x27;s pension issues long-term and the Illinois pension crisis continues into the present day, with Illinois&#x27; public pensions being the worst-funded in the nation as of 2023.

=== 1994 Illinois gubernatorial election ===
In 1994, Edgar easily defeated the Democratic nominee, incumbent state comptroller Dawn Clark Netsch, to win re-election in a landslide. He won 101 of the state&#x27;s 102 counties, including the historically Democratic stronghold of Cook County.

=== Second term (1995–1999) ===
During his second term, the relationship between his re-election campaign and Management Systems of Illinois (MSI) came under federal scrutiny. MSI, Edgar&#x27;s largest campaign contributor, was granted a contract that cost an estimated $20 million in overcharges. Edgar was never accused of wrongdoing, but he testified twice, once in court and once by videotape, becoming the first sitting Illinois governor to take the witness stand in a criminal case in 75 years. In those appearances, the governor insisted political donations played no role in who received state contracts. Convictions were obtained against Management Services of Illinois; Michael Martin, who had been a partner of Management Services of Illinois; and Ronald Lowder, who had been a state welfare administrator and later worked for Management Services of Illinois.

While pro-choice, Edgar signed into law the Parental Notification of Abortion Act during his second term.

On August 20, 1997, Edgar announced he would retire from politics at the end of his second term. If he sought a third term, he was seen by his supporters as likely to win it. He was also encouraged by Republican officials to run for U.S. Senate that year, which he also declined to do.

Edgar supported Secretary of State George Ryan to succeed him. Ryan was elected governor in 1998.
==Post-governorship==
Edgar is a distinguished fellow of the Institute of Government &amp; Public Affairs at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

In 1999, Edgar was elected a fellow of the National Academy of Public Administration.

Edgar was named the honorary chairman of the Ronald Reagan Centennial Celebration at Eureka College, President Reagan&#x27;s alma mater. To open the Reagan Centennial year in January 2011, Governor Edgar delivered the keynote speech at the concluding dinner of the &quot;Reagan and the Midwest&quot; academic conference held at Eureka College. In September 2011, Edgar helped dedicate the Mark R. Shenkman Reagan Research Center housed in the Eureka College library.

As former chairman of the board of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library Foundation, Edgar underwrote the costs of the traveling trophy for the annual Lincoln Bowl tradition started in 2012. The Lincoln Bowl celebrates the Lincoln connection with Knox College and Eureka College, two Illinois colleges where Lincoln spoke, and is awarded to the winning team each time the two schools play each other in football.

In July 2016, the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; reported that Illinois Financing Partners, a firm for which Edgar served as chairman, won approval by the state to advance money to state vendors who had been waiting for payments by the state. In turn, the firm would get to keep late payment fees when Illinois finally pays.

Edgar was inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State&#x27;s highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois in 1999 in the area of Government.

He is a resident fellow at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.

=== Political opinions ===
A moderate Republican, Edgar supports abortion rights.

In February 2008, Edgar endorsed Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona for President of the United States.

Edgar supported Mitt Romney in 2012. When Donald Trump won the Republican nomination in 2016, Edgar publicly announced that he would not be voting for him. After the President&#x27;s second nomination, Edgar, along with other Illinois GOP moderates, announced their support of former United States Vice President and Democratic challenger Joe Biden. Edgar told Peoria-area newspaper Peoria Journal Star, &quot;I have been very disappointed. We’ve had chaos for four years we didn’t need to have. I mean, there’s always going to be some turmoil, but he stirs it up. He bullies. You can’t believe what he says because he’ll do the different thing the next day. ... He’s bungled the virus, there’s no doubt about that. He continued to stir up division in the country, (when) a president should be trying to bring people together. I mean, the list goes on and on.&quot;

In the spring of 2016, Edgar said that he believed Governor Bruce Rauner should sign the Democratic budget and support the Democratic pension plan. Edgar pushed for a pension bill to save $15 billion back in 1994. &quot;We had a time bomb in our retirement system that was going to go off in the first part of the 21st century,&quot; Edgar told &quot;The State Journal-Register&quot; in 1994. &quot;This legislation defuses that time bomb.&quot; The legislature passed Edgar&#x27;s bill unanimously.

== Personal life ==
Edgar is married to Brenda Smith Edgar. They have two children, Brad and Elizabeth. Edgar is Baptist.

In 1994, Edgar underwent emergency quadruple bypass surgery, and was hospitalized in 1998 for chest pains. In February 2025, Edgar announced that he had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.

<doc id="673690" wikidata="Q783243" url="?curid=673690" title="Australian hip-hop">
<text>Australian hip-hop traces its origins to the early 1980s and was initially largely inspired by hip-hop and other urban musical genres from the United States. As the form matured, Australian hip hop has become a commercially viable style of music that is no longer restricted to the creative underground, with artists such as Onefour, Hilltop Hoods, Kerser and Bliss n Eso and having achieved notable fame. Australian Hip-Hop is still primarily released through independent record labels, which are often owned and operated by the artists themselves. Despite its genesis as an offshoot of American hip-hop, Australian hip hop has developed a distinct personality that reflects its evolution as an Australian musical style. Since the inception of the Australian hip-hop scene, Australian Aboriginals have played a prominent role.

==History==

===Early years (1980s)===
In 1982, the music video for Malcolm McLaren&#x27;s track, &quot;Buffalo Gals&quot;, was shown on the Australian television music show &quot;Sound Unlimited&quot;. The music show was broadcast on Network Seven. The clip was staged in a Manhattan basketball court and featured images of graffiti and break dancers. The video left an impression on Australian teenagers, who began to copy the dancers&#x27; moves.

The first Australian hip hop record released was &quot;16 Tons&quot; / &quot;Humber Mania Time&quot; by Mighty Big Crime via Virgin Records and Criteria Productions in 1987 (Catalogue number VOZC 026). The Melbourne-based duo (Gumpy Phillips and Tricky J a.k.a. Justin Lodge) soon disbanded. In 1991, both were members of flower power group, Freaked Out Flower Children.

Gerry Bloustein wrote in the book &quot;Musical Visions&quot; that Blaze claimed the first &quot;true hip hop&quot; release was, &quot;Combined Talent&quot; / &quot;My Destiny&quot; in 1988 by Just Us (consisting of Maltese DJ Case and Mentor).

In 1988, the first compilation of Australian rap, &quot;Down Under by Law&quot; (Virgin), was released. It included tracks by Westside Posse, Mighty Big Crime, Swoop, Sharline and Fly Girl 3.

Two Western Australian hip hop bands, Def Threat and Gangstarr, both released recordings in 1987. The Def Threat&#x27;s EP, &quot;Girls Never learn&quot;, reached No. 4 in the WA Independent music charts. Def Threat played a number of gigs over the next 12 months, and then disbanded. Gangstarr survived for a few more years.

===Major label releases (1990s)===
In the late 1980s, Sound Unlimited Posse signed with Sony Music, thereby becoming the first Australian hip hop group signed on to a major record label. In 1992, they released the first major-label Australian hip hop album titled &quot;A Postcard from the Edge of the Under-side&quot;.

In 1991, a 16-year-old Sydney-based solo artist named KIC was signed to Columbia/SME Records. His first single, &quot;Bring Me On&quot;, was popular in Australia, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Also in 1992, independent label company Random Records released Def Wish Cast&#x27;s album &quot;Knights of the Underground Table&quot;. After 1992, independent CDs and tapes were released by various artists, primarily from the western suburbs of Sydney, a largely immigrant-populated area largely known as a working class, underprivileged, and crime-ridden area.

MC Opi (a.k.a. Opi Nelson) was an underground hip hop and dancehall artist who rose to national success after her performance on Christine Anu and Paul Kelly&#x27;s 1994 ARIA-nominated single &quot;Last Train&quot;, released by Mushroom/EMI (White Label). Prior to this, MC Opi co-produced &quot;Women on the Rhyme&quot;, the first national radio documentary about Australian female hip hop artists, created at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).

MC Opi contributed to Anu&#x27;s debut album &quot;Stylin&#x27; Up&quot;, which attained platinum status in Australia and won the ARIA Award for Best Indigenous Album. Following the winning of the award, Anu invited MC Opi to perform with her on the first &quot;Australian Jail Tour&quot; as part of NAIDOC (National Aborigines and Islanders Day Observance Committee) Week in 1993 in order to raise awareness about indigenous deaths in custody.

===Millennial era (2000s)===
The Melbourne hip hop group 1200 Techniques was formed in 1997 by &quot;old-school&quot; 1980s B-boy/aerosol artist DJ Peril (founding member of Melbourne hip hop crew Island Boys).The group consisted of DJ Peril on production, turntables, and percussion; his brother Kem(Kemstar) on guitar; and N&#x27;fa on vocals. They released an EP in 2001 called &quot;Infinite Styles&quot; with the independent label company Rubber Records. 1200 Techniques later released one of the first hip hop crossover hits, a track called &quot;Karma&quot; (from the album &quot;Choose One&quot;). The song spawned the first ARIA Award for a hip hop act in Australia even before there was a hip hop category. Additionally &quot;Karma&quot; won Michael Gracey an ARIA in the same year for Best Video. In 2003, the band released the first Australian hip hop DVD titled &quot;One Time Live&quot;, which featured the band&#x27;s music videos, live footage and two short documentaries. Their second album, &quot;Consistency Theory&quot;, was released in 2004.

Two of the first major Australian hip hop labels were founded during this era; Obese Records in Melbourne, founded by Pegz (whose first release was Reason&#x27;s &quot;Solid&quot; in 200), and Elefant Traks in Sydney, founded by Kenny Sabir (p.k.a. Traksewt). The core members of the Elefant Traks label would go on to form their own hip-hop group, The Herd in 2001. Their self-titled debut album featured their first hit, &quot;Scallops&quot;, which gained significant airplay on Triple J and has even been hailed as an &quot;Aussie backyard anthem&quot;
By the early 2000s, the Australian Record Industry Association (ARIA) began to recognise the growing interest in hip-hop in Australia. In 2004, ARIA introduced a new category in its annual awards: Best Urban Album (R&amp;B, hip-hop, soul, funk, reggae and dancehall). The inaugural award was won by Koolism for their album, &quot;Random Thoughts&quot;. Koolism DJ Danielsan dedicated the award to the &quot;Australian hip-hop community&quot; and exclaimed: &quot;Be yourselves, keep it real, enough of that American wannabe trash&quot;. For the ARIA Music Awards of 2019, new categories of awards were created for Best Hip Hop Release and Best Soul/R&amp;B Release, which were previously combined in the Best Urban Release category.

At the 2006 and 2007 ARIA Awards, the Urban award was won by Hilltop Hoods for its albums &quot;The Hard Road&quot; and &quot;The Hard Road: Restrung&quot;, respectively. The &quot;Hard Road&quot; also became the first Australian hip hop album to rank number 1 on the ARIA Charts in 2006. Other artists who have won the award include Bliss n Eso, for their album &quot;Flying Colours&quot;, and Melbourne artist Illy, for his album &quot;Bring it Back&quot;, released on the Obese Records label.

Australian hip-hop artists have also received international recognition. Australians have been featured on albums by artists from the US and Europe. Hilltop Hoods appeared on US hip-hop group CunninLynguists&#x27; 2009 album, &quot;Strange Journey Volume One&quot;. In October 2014, Australian artist K21 appeared on a song, titled &quot;Pas rentable&quot;, by French hip hop artist LinkRust.

There are very few women in the Australian hip-hop scene, with Layla and A-Love being the most notable. However, underground artists such as Sampa the Great are on the rise.

==Style and influences==
Australian hip hop artists are strongly influenced by African American and Latino rappers from the US, and continue to incorporate such influences into their music. Australian artists, however, still utilise an authentic and unique style in their own music. Like many hip hop scenes outside the US, some Australian hip hop artists have also been influenced by funk, jazz and dembow. Indigenous Australian culture is also a strong influence for many hip hop artists.

While hip hop artists in the US are predominantly African American, many Australian hip hop artists are of Anglo heritage. Numerous Australian hip hop artists, including N&#x27;fa, Remi, Sampa the Great, Diafrix, Tkay Maidza, Miracle, Vida Sunshyne, KillaQueenz, are of African descent, which has influenced their music.

===Indigenous Australian Hip-Hop===

Since the early 1980s, many indigenous crews have used hip hop as an outlet to vent their frustration against racial injustice and discrimination. Though not at the forefront of the Australian hip hop scene, Aboriginal rappers such as Brothablack, the South West Syndicate, Local Knowledge, Lez Beckett and the Native Ryme Syndicate produce songs that address the cultural situation of Indigenous Australians. One of their musical influences is the American hip hop group, Public Enemy.

Munkimuk works on community-based educational hip hop projects around Australia, such as 1999&#x27;s Desert Rap, conducted with Brothablack from South West Syndicate and Morganics. The Desert Rap project was organised with Tony Collins from Triple J, which made an ABC TV documentary. Munkimuk also hosts a nationally syndicated weekly radio program called &quot;Indij Hip Hop Show&quot;, which is produced by Koori Radio in Sydney.

Briggs, a Yorta Yorta man from the rural location of Shepparton, became a prominent feature of the Australian hip hop scene since he began his career as an independent artist in 2005. In August 2014, he released his sophomore studio album, &quot;Sheplife&quot;, on the Golden Era Records label, owned by Hilltop Hoods. As of 2012, Briggs has been the recipient of two Deadly Awards nominations and received the &quot;Best New Talent&quot; award at the 2014 National Indigenous Music Awards (NIMA).

Indigenous producer and MC Daniel Rankine (Trials), of the Adelaide trio Funkoars and Golden Era Records, also releases his own work, including occasional solo work. Rankine&#x27;s production credits include Drapht, Vents, Reason, Cross Bred Mongrels and K21, while he has provided guest verses for Purpose, Hilltop Hoods, and the Golden Era mixtapes. Trials and Briggs performed together at the &quot;Beat The Drum&quot; event for the Triple J Radio station on 16 January 2015, and released their debut album as the group A.B. Original, titled &quot;Reclaim Australia&quot;, in 2016.

===American influence===
U.S. artists cited as key inspirations of Australian hip-hop artists include Public Enemy, A Tribe Called Quest, and Nas. Following the release of &quot;Drinking From The Sun&quot; in 2012, Hilltop Hoods included Organized Konfusion, Kraz, and De La Soul in its ideal festival line-up.

In Australia, dance moves associated with hip hop, such as krumping, footworking, locking, and popping, have drawn public interest to hip hop, and contributed to its dynamic popularity. However, these dance moves have been criticised as not being original and a sign that Australia suffers from a lack of its own hip hop identity.

===United Kingdom influence===
In more recent years (2000s onwards), Australian Hip Hop has seen a strong emergence of UK genres such as Grime and Afrobeats. Although these genres have been around for years, their worldwide popularity and acceptance in the mainstream is relatively new. The genre of &quot;Australian grime&quot; has been marked by viral artists like HAZRD. Adelaide-based producer Strict Face hosted his own show on the now-defunct London&#x27;s Radar Radio.

===Drill music===
An off-shoot of the drill music scene developed in Australia in the late 2010s, but didn&#x27;t catch &#x27;mainstream&#x27; attention until 2017-2018. Inspired by UK drill, Onefour quickly rose in prominence in 2019 after a series of singles, The Samoan Australian group from Mount Druitt was recognised as the first Drill group in Australia according to &quot;Vice&quot;.

===Gutter rap===
Completely distinguishing itself from most Australian hip-hop at the time, which rapped about middle-class lifestyle and issues (such as breakups, skating, going to the RSL), a new scene originating from Australia&#x27;s infamous Housing Commission estates began emerging in the late 2000s called Gutter rap (sometimes known as Lad rap). Gutter rap artists such as Campbelltown&#x27;s Kerser, Hurstville&#x27;s Skeamo and Nter, and Blacktown&#x27;s Fortay, primarily rap about Australian Lower-class lifestyle and issues (such as crime, drug addictions, financial struggles), similar to traditional American Gangsta rap, which resulted it in being branded an Australian version of the American music genre. Unlike most other Australian hip-hop scenes, which have proper mainstream presence and support, gutter rap remains underground on the internet, but that didn&#x27;t stop artists from the genre gaining mainstream recognition and success, an example being Kerser&#x27;s second album &quot;No Rest for the Sickest&quot; reaching No. 15 on the ARIA albums chart.

===Australian identity===
Although hip hop originated in the US, some Australian rappers see their hip hop scene as having its own unique character. Dialectrix has described it as a &quot;mongrel mutation&quot; of Afrocentric and Australian culture. According to the lyrics of Def Wish Cast, it is &quot;down under, comin&#x27; up&quot;.

Australian hip hop has been localised with the introduction of aspects such as the Australian accent, Australian slang, political views, and references to localities and matters of Australian cultural identity. The lyrics of early Western Sydney artists like 046, Def Wish Cast, and the White Boys represent the process of localising Australian hip hop. Additionally, the non-Anglo immigrants of these areas were attracted to hip hop because it tackles the theme of racial opposition, as in African American and Chicano hip hop. Australian hip hop has been described as rich with Australian character, but also as inspirational for immigrants, providing &quot;a voice and a purpose for those making their home anew in Australia&quot;. For example, Diafrix use migrant experiences in some of their songs, although this is not their main focus.

Numerous Australian hip-hop artists have expressed concern that sections of Australia&#x27;s hip hop fan base seem to espouse a &quot;redneck&quot; mentality that is ignorant of the culture&#x27;s international influences. In a 2009 interview, Cross Bred Mongrels member Flak explained: &quot;I don&#x27;t go for that. [Only listening to Australian hip hop] I think that is a little narrow-minded. If it is dope hip hop, it is dope hip hop. If it is from Germany, Japan or Compton, and it is dope, I go for it.&quot; Over time, Australian hip hop diversified, absorbing influences from New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the Caribbean. For example, Def Wish described his style as influenced by reggae from London, rather than North American rap, while also acknowledging Afro-Caribbean roots of that scene.

Kamaludeen Mohamed Nasir&#x27;s book, &quot;Globalized Muslim Youth in the Asia Pacific: Popular Culture in Singapore and Sydney&quot; discusses how Muslim hip-hoppers like Matuse and The Brothahood have added their voices to what it means to be Australian. In their songs, The Brothahood talks about &quot;their piety in the face of everyday life in Australia post-September 11&quot;, while in Matuse&#x27;s track, &quot;Sydney vs Everybody&quot;, he raps about &quot;being singled out by a section of white Australia for his ethnic background rather than his lyrical skills&quot;.

===Television===
The first appearance of an Australian hip hop act on Australian television was in November 1988, when Skippy The Butcher performed live on the ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Factory&quot; during the Run DMC tour. The first Australian hip hop documentary, &quot;Basic Equipment&quot;, was made in 1996 and released in 1997. Narrated by Paul Westgate (a.k.a. Sereck) from Def Wish Cast, the documentary examined the Sydney hip hop culture. It was created by Paul Fenech (creator of SBS&#x27; &quot;Pizza&quot; series) and featured artists such as MC Trey, Def Wish Cast, DJ Bonez, DJ Ask.

During the 1990s, SBS TV&#x27;s &quot;MC Tee Vee,&quot; the first Australian dance music show became a hit. In 1992, following an invitation from Annette Shun Wah from the alternative arts show, &quot;The Noise&quot;, MC Opi became the first hip hop artist to become a reporter and assistant producer for &quot;MC Tee Vee&quot;. &quot;MC Tee Vee&quot; is notable for being the first national Australian music program dedicated to dance, rap and house music.

In August 2006, the ABC program &quot;Compass&quot; showed a documentary entitled &quot;The Mistery of Hip Hop&quot;, which explored the cultural movement and popularity of hip hop in Australia. The film followed one of the &quot;founding fathers&quot; of the Sydney hip hop scene Matthew &quot;Mistery&quot; Peet. Mistery works full-time as graffiti artist and is also emcee/rapper in the group Brethren. The 28-minute documentary looked at the &quot;four elements of hip hop&quot;: breakdancing, DJing, rapping, and graffiti. It features interviews with the then-host of Triple J&#x27;s hip hop show Maya Jupiter, and the other half of Brethren: Wizdm and DJ Kool Herc.

In December 2007, ABC Television aired the documentary &quot;Words from the City&quot;, which includes interviews with a number of high-profile Australian hip hop artists, including: Hilltop Hoods, Koolism, Downsyde, TZU, MC Layla, Bliss n Eso, MC Trey, Wire MC, and Jupiter.

Starting in 2018 &quot;The Lesson TV&quot; or &quot;LSN TV&quot; was an Australian Hip-Hop music TV show akin to MTV, that aired on C44, C31 &amp; WTV. The show was derived from The Lesson 92.7 Radio show, Aiming to showcase Australia&#x27;s diversity and cultural significance. With its mix of interviews, performances and discussions. The show provided insight into various aspects of hip-hop, from established artists to emerging talents. While it may no longer be on the air, The Lesson TV left a lasting impact on the Australian Hip-Hop community at its ground level.

==Rap in Australian politics==

The earliest political discussion of hip hop in Australia questioned whether controversial rappers from overseas should be permitted to enter and perform in the country, as was the case with Eminem in 2001. Australian hip hop artists have since used their platform to make political statements and drive political change; Urthboy (and the hip-hop collective that he is a founding member of, The Herd) and Thundamentals are among those whose lyrics often highlight and denounce inequality. Criticism of John Howard and his government were reoccurring themes in Australian hip-hop songs until Labour MP Kevin Rudd won the 2007 federal election. The Herd made a song celebrating this outcome the following year in their song &quot;The King Is Dead&quot;, which was the lead single for their fourth studio album, &quot;Summerland&quot;. Other notable critiques of Howard&#x27;s government include TZU&#x27;s &quot;Recoil&quot; and Quro&#x27;s &quot;Goodnight Mr. Howard&quot;. The latter release also featured the then Prime Minister on the cover.

A.B. Original, the collaboration between Indigenous rappers Briggs and Trials, was crucial to initiating debate on changing the date of Australia Day, particularly with their critical 2016 single &quot;26 January&quot;. 

While professional musicians have gone on to enter Australian politics, most notably Midnight Oil frontman Peter Garrett, no hip hop artist has done so, although Briggs appeared to launch a campaign to enter Parliament in 2018, and has been since referred to himself as Senator Briggs in jest. In a notable event that stirred headlines, rapper Snoop Dogg faced a significant setback upon his planned visit to Australia. The incident which unfolded in 2007, Attracted widespread attention and sparked debates within both the entertainment industry and public sphere, with opinions divided on whether the decision was fair or not. Kevin Andrews is quoted as saying, “He doesn&#x27;t seem the sort of bloke we want in this country”. However Snoop was granted a full visa in 2008.

Elected politicians in Australia have also attempted to utilise rapping to reach a younger audience. In 2012, two Labor Party cabinet members in the Gillard government briefly delivered original policy-related lyrics backed by music: Trade Minister Craig Emerson commented on the carbon tax by performing an adapted version of the chorus of rock song &quot;Horror Movie&quot;, referred to by some as the &quot;No Whyalla Wipeout&quot; rap; while Arts Minister Simon Crean marked a visit to a Parramatta arts centre by recording rhyming lines in a duet with sound artist Tokyo Love-In over the beat of &quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot;. Greens Senator Scott Ludlam appeared in the 2014 G20 Brisbane summit episode of &quot;Juice Rap News&quot;, rapping ten lines criticising the Abbott government&#x27;s mandatory data retention law.

The performance of American rapper Macklemore at the October 2017 NRL Grand Final became a topic of political discussion, due to its inclusion of &quot;Same Love&quot; at a time when Australians were voting on whether same-sex marriage should be legalised. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was interviewed on &quot;The Project&quot; several days before the performance. When asked about his favourite hip hop artist, Prime Minister Turnbull initially claimed that he was &quot;still grieving for Tupac&quot;, later confessing that he finds much of hip hop music to sound the same. He then surprised the hosts by offering to rap, reciting two sport-related lines without backing music: &quot;Waleed, you&#x27;re the man, you&#x27;re the Tigers fan / You can talk, the Crows can squawk&quot;. A few days later, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten appeared on &quot;Fitzy and Wippa&quot; in a rap battle segment, rapping twelve lines over the instrumental of 50 Cent&#x27;s &quot;In da Club&quot; and concluding his verse by dabbing. While Shorten&#x27;s opponents at the rap battle were radio hosts Ryan Fitzgerald and Ray Hadley, several of his lines were directed at Turnbull, such as &quot;Our economy&#x27;s in debt but Malcolm&#x27;s just chillin&#x27; / Hey Malcolm, can you lend us a couple of million?&quot;.

In the 2018 South Australian state election campaign, former Senator Nick Xenophon released a two-minute musical advertisement for his newly formed SA-Best party, centred upon himself rapping his party&#x27;s concerns and policies for South Australia.

In 2021, Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack briefly accepted an invitation to rap by David Koch on &quot;Sunrise&quot;. Having been made aware of a hip-hop music video promoting COVID-19 vaccines in Sichuan, McCormack stated &quot;You know, you know, make sure you get the jab, you know&quot; whilst dancing awkwardly.

<text>Eliyahu Rips (; ; ; 12 December 1948 – 19 July 2024) was an Israeli mathematician of Latvian origin known for his research in geometric group theory. He became known to the general public following his co-authoring a paper on what is popularly known as Bible code, the supposed coded messaging in the Hebrew text of the Torah.

==Biography==
Ilya (Eliyahu) Rips grew up in Latvia (then part of the Soviet Union). His mother was Jewish and from Riga, the only of nine siblings that survived the war; the others were killed in Rumbula and other places. His father Aaron was a Jewish mathematician from Belarus; his first wife, children, and all of his relatives were killed during the Holocaust.

Rips was the first high school student from Latvia to participate in the International Mathematical Olympiad. In January 1969, he learnt from listening to Western radio broadcast — then illegal in the USSR — of the self-immolation of Czechoslovak student Jan Palach. On 13 April 1969, Rips, then a graduate student at the University of Latvia, attempted self-immolation in a protest against the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. After unwrapping a self-made slogan condemning the occupation of Czechoslovakia he lit a candle and set his gasoline-soaked clothes ablaze. A group of bystanders was able to quickly put the fire out, resulting only in burns to Rips&#x27; neck and hands. Though injured, he was first taken to the local KGB office and interrogated. He was incarcerated by the Soviet government for two years. After his story spread among Western mathematical circles and a wave of petitions, Rips was freed in 1971. The following year, he was allowed to immigrate to Israel.

Rips joined the Department of Mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and in 1975 completed his Ph.D. in mathematics there. His topic was the dimensional subgroup problem. He was awarded the Aharon Katzir Prize. In 1979, Rips received the Erdős Prize from the Israel Mathematical Society, and was a sectional speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1994.

Rips died on 19 July 2024, at the age of 75.

==Academic career==

Rips was a professor in the Department of Mathematics at Hebrew University. His research interests were geometric and combinatorial methods in infinite group theory. This includes small cancellation theory and its generalizations, (Gromov) hyperbolic group theory, Bass-Serre theory and the actions of groups on formula_1-trees.

Rips&#x27; work on group actions on formula_1-trees is mostly unpublished. The Rips machine, in the hands of Rips and his student Zlil Sela, has proven to be effective in obtaining classification results such as a solution to the isomorphism problem for hyperbolic groups.

==&quot;The Bible Code&quot; controversy==

In the late 1970s, Rips began looking with the help of a computer for codes in the Torah. In 1994, Rips, together with Doron Witztum and Yoav Rosenberg, published in the journal &quot;Statistical Science&quot; an article, &quot;Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis&quot;, which claimed the discovery of encoded messages in the Hebrew text of the Book of Genesis. This, in turn, was the inspiration for the 1997 book &quot;The Bible Code&quot; by journalist Michael Drosnin. While Rips originally claimed that he agreed with Drosnin&#x27;s findings, in 1997 Rips described Drosnin&#x27;s book as &quot;on very shaky ground&quot; and &quot;of no value.&quot; Since Drosnin&#x27;s book, Bible codes have been a subject of controversy, with the claims being criticized by Brendan McKay and others. An early supporter of Rips&#x27; theories was Robert Aumann, Nobel Prize Laureate in Economics 2005, who headed a commission overseeing Rips&#x27; experiments attempting to prove the existence of a secret code from God in the Torah. Eventually, Aumann abandoned the idea and withdrew his support from Rips.

&quot;The Bible Code&quot; treats the text of the Bible as a word search puzzle: for example, a word may be spelled diagonally moving in a north west direction, or perhaps left-to-right taking every second letter. The more patterns that are allowed, the more words that can be found. Elementary statistics can be used to estimate the probabilities of finding certain hidden messages. The statistician Jeffrey S. Rosenthal shows in his book &quot;Struck by Lightning: The Curious World of Probabilities&quot; that &quot;hidden messages&quot; are statistically expected and hence should not be seen as divine messages, much less as predictions of the future. Mathematician Brendan McKay illustrated this point by finding messages in the English text of &quot;Moby Dick&quot; that supposedly &quot;predicted&quot; famous assassinations of the past, such as the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the assassination of Indira Gandhi.

The 1997 &quot;Ig Nobel Prize for Literature&quot; was awarded to Eliyahu Rips, Doron Witztum, Yoav Rosenberg, and Michael Drosnin, for their work on Bible codes.
