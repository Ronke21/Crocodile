<text>S/KEY is a one-time password system developed for authentication to Unix-like operating systems, especially from dumb terminals or untrusted public computers on which one does not want to type a long-term password. A user&#x27;s real password is combined in an offline device with a short set of characters and a decrementing counter to form a single-use password. Because each password is only used once, they are useless to password sniffers.

Because the short set of characters does not change until the counter reaches zero, it is possible to prepare a list of single-use passwords, in order, that can be carried by the user. Alternatively, the user can present the password, characters, and desired counter value to a local calculator to generate the appropriate one-time password that can then be transmitted over the network in the clear. The latter form is more common and practically amounts to challenge–response authentication.

S/KEY is supported in Linux (via pluggable authentication modules), OpenBSD, NetBSD, and FreeBSD, and a generic open-source implementation can be used to enable its use on other systems. OpenSSH also implements S/KEY since version OpenSSH 1.2.2 was released on December 1, 1999. One common implementation is called OPIE. S/KEY is a trademark of Telcordia Technologies, formerly known as Bell Communications Research (Bellcore).

S/KEY is also sometimes referred to as Lamport&#x27;s scheme, after its author, Leslie Lamport. It was developed by Neil Haller, Phil Karn and John Walden at Bellcore in the late 1980s. With the expiration of the basic patents on
public-key cryptography and the widespread use of laptop computers running SSH and
other cryptographic protocols that can secure an entire session, not just the password, S/KEY is falling
into disuse. Schemes that implement two-factor authentication, by comparison, are growing in use.

==Password generation==
The &quot;server&quot; is the computer that will perform the authentication.
# This step begins with a secret key &quot;W&quot;. This secret can either be provided by the user, or can be generated by a computer. Either way, if this secret is disclosed, then the security of S/KEY is compromised.
# A cryptographic hash function &quot;H&quot; is applied &quot;n&quot; times to &quot;W&quot;, thereby producing a hash chain of &quot;n&quot; one-time passwords. The passwords are the results of the application of the cryptographic hash function: 
#:&quot;H&quot;(&quot;W&quot;), &quot;H&quot;(&quot;H&quot;(&quot;W&quot;)), ..., &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;W&quot;).
# The initial secret &quot;W&quot; is discarded.
# The user is provided with the &quot;n&quot; passwords, printed out in reverse order:
#:&quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;W&quot;), &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1(&quot;W&quot;), ..., &quot;H&quot;(&quot;H&quot;(&quot;W&quot;)), &quot;H&quot;(&quot;W&quot;).
# The passwords &quot;H&quot;(&quot;W&quot;), &quot;H&quot;(&quot;H&quot;(&quot;W&quot;)), ..., &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1(&quot;W&quot;) are discarded from the server. Only the password &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;W&quot;), the one at the top of the user&#x27;s list, is stored on the server.

==Authentication==

After password generation, the user has a sheet of paper with &quot;n&quot; passwords on it. If &quot;n&quot; is very large, either storing all &quot;n&quot; passwords or calculate the given password from &quot;H&quot;(&quot;W&quot;) become inefficient. There are methods to efficiently calculate the passwords in the required order, using only formula_1 hash calculations per step and storing formula_2 passwords.

More ideally, though perhaps less commonly in practice, the user may carry a small, portable, secure, non-networked computing device capable of regenerating any needed password given the secret passphrase, the salt, and the number of iterations of the hash required, the latter two of which are conveniently provided by the server requesting authentication for login.

In any case, the first password will be the same password that the server has stored. This first password will not be used for authentication (the user should scratch this password on the sheet of paper), the second one will be used instead:
* The user provides the server with the second password on the list and scratches that password.
* The server attempts to compute &quot;H&quot;(), where is the password supplied. If &quot;H&quot;() produces the password the server has stored, then the authentication is successful. The server will then store as the current reference.

For subsequent authentications, the user will provide &quot;i&quot;. (The last password on the printed list, &quot;n&quot;, is the first password generated by the server, &quot;H&quot;(&quot;W&quot;), where &quot;W&quot; is the initial secret).
The server will compute &quot;H&quot;(&quot;i&quot;) and will compare the result to &quot;i&quot;−1, which is stored as reference on the server.

==Security==
The security of S/KEY relies on the difficulty of reversing cryptographic hash functions. Assume an attacker manages to get hold of a password that was used for a successful authentication. Supposing this is &quot;i&quot;, this password is already useless for subsequent authentications, because each password can only be used once. It would be interesting for the attacker to find out &quot;i&quot;−1, because this password is the one that will be used for the next authentication.

However, this would require inverting the hash function that produced &quot;i&quot;−1 using &quot;i&quot; (&quot;H&quot;(&quot;i&quot;−1) = &quot;i&quot;), which is extremely difficult to do with current cryptographic hash functions.

Nevertheless, S/KEY is vulnerable to a man in the middle attack if used by itself. It is also vulnerable to certain race conditions, such as where an attacker&#x27;s software sniffs the network to learn the first &quot;N&quot; − 1 characters in the password (where &quot;N&quot; equals the password length), establishes its own TCP session to the server, and in rapid succession tries all valid characters in the &quot;N&quot;-th position until one succeeds. These types of vulnerabilities can be avoided by using ssh, SSL, SPKM, or other encrypted transport layer.

Since each iteration of S/KEY doesn&#x27;t include the salt or count, it is feasible to find collisions directly without breaking the initial password. This has a complexity of 264, which can be pre-calculated with the same amount of space. The space complexity can be optimized by storing chains of values, although collisions might reduce the coverage of this method, especially for long chains.

Someone with access to an S/KEY database can break all of them in parallel with a complexity of 264. While they wouldn&#x27;t get the original password, they would be able to find valid credentials for each user. In this regard, it is similar to storing unsalted 64-bit hashes of strong, unique passwords.

The S/KEY protocol can loop. If such a loop were created in the S/KEY chain, an attacker could use user&#x27;s key without finding the original value, and possibly without tipping off the valid user. The pathological case of this would be an OTP that hashes to itself.

==Usability==
Internally, S/KEY uses 64-bit numbers. For human usability purposes, each number is mapped to six short words, of one to four characters each, from a publicly accessible 2048-word dictionary. For example, one 64-bit number maps to &quot;ROY HURT SKI FAIL GRIM KNEE&quot;.

<text>POG, or Passion Orange Guava, is a tropical juice drink created in 1971 by a food product consultant named Mary Soon, who worked for Haleakala Dairy on Maui, Hawaii. The name &quot;POG&quot; is an acronym for three fruits from which it is made: passionfruit, orange, and guava.

POG is produced by Meadow Gold Dairy, a subsidiary of Dean Foods. Similar blends of passionfruit, orange and guava juices are also produced by other companies.

==The game of milk caps==
The caps used to seal milk bottles inspired the fad game Pogs (or &quot;milk caps&quot;), which became popular during the early- to mid-1990s. The game of pogs possibly originated in Maui, Hawaii, in the 1920s or 1930s.

Although POG juice was never sold in bottles with cardboard milk caps, the two became associated after Haleakala Dairy gave away caps printed with the POG logo as a marketing promotion in the 1970s. The 1990s craze using these milk caps was initiated by Blossom Galbiso, a teacher in Hawaii in 1991. She started using the milk caps in her classroom and told her students about an old game she used to play: flipping milk caps to be the first one to get the cream off the bottom of the cap. Her students began flipping the milk caps and the resurgence of the game called Pogs began.

==Mascot==
The POG drink features its mascot on the juice carton cover, known as a &quot;Poglodyte&quot;. Poglodytes are fuzzy yellow creatures who were often depicted with surfboards. The side of the juice carton describes them as the creatures from the magical village that makes POG juice.

<text>Marcel Proulx (; born 6 March 1946 in L&#x27;Orignal, Ontario) is a retired Canadian politician.

Proulx is a former member of the Liberal Party of Canada in the House of Commons of Canada, having represented the riding of Hull—Aylmer from 1999 to 2011. Proulx is a former administrator, businessman, claim adjuster, and executive assistant. He is a former Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport and is the current Chair of the Sub-Committee on Private Members&#x27; Business of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs and Deputy Chair of Committees of the Whole, frequently being the Acting Speaker.

Proulx ran for Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada in the 39th Canadian Parliament. Fellow Liberal Peter Milliken won on the first ballot.

Marcel Proulx was a supporter of Michael Ignatieff during the last leadership campaign of the Liberal Party of Canada. However, he served as Quebec lieutenant for Stéphane Dion in 2007. On 16 October 2007, after much speculation, Proulx announced his resignation as Quebec lieutenant. The position of Quebec Lieutenant was offered to Pablo Rodriguez and Denis Coderre but both refused. The position was later given to Senator Céline Hervieux-Payette.

He was defeated by NDP candidate Nycole Turmel in the 2011 Canadian election in a landslide. Turmel would also succeed him as the Chief Opposition Whip in the 41st Canadian Parliament.

He is the first Liberal candidate ever defeated in Hull-Aylmer&#x27;s 94-year history. Proulx became a real estate agent a few months after his defeat.

<doc id="661683" wikidata="Q51796021" url="?curid=661683" title="Grilled cheese">
<text>A grilled cheese, sometimes known as a toasted sandwich, cheese toastie (UK), or jaffle (AU), is a hot cheese sandwich typically prepared by heating slices of cheese between slices of bread with a cooking fat such as butter or mayonnaise on a frying pan, griddle, or sandwich toaster, until the bread browns and the cheese melts. Despite its name, the sandwich is rarely prepared through grilling; it is most often pan-fried.

==History==
The 1861 English recipe book &quot;Mrs. Beeton&#x27;s Book of Household Management&quot; includes a recipe for placing sandwiches of brown bread and butter with slices of &quot;a nice fat Cheshire or any good rich cheese&quot; into an oven, and serving when the bread becomes toasted.

The cheese dream, an open-faced grilled cheese sandwich, became popular in the U.S. during the Great Depression. U.S. government cookbooks describe Navy cooks broiling &quot;American cheese filling sandwiches&quot; during World War II.

== Preparation ==

A grilled cheese sandwich is made by placing a cheese filling, often cheddar or American cheese, between two slices of bread, which is then put on a pan to heat until the bread browns and the cheese melts. A layer of butter or mayonnaise is usually added to the outside of the bread for additional flavor and texture. Alternatives may include additional ingredients such as peppers, tomatoes, or onions.

A grilled cheese may also be made in a sandwich toaster, particularly in the United Kingdom where the dish is normally called a toasted cheese sandwich or cheese toastie.

==Retail==
Some restaurants, food carts, and food trucks in the United States specialize in the grilled cheese sandwich. The Grilled Cheese Grill restaurants were a combination of reclaimed vehicle and food cart restaurants that focused on gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches in Portland, Oregon. The Grilled Cheese Truck is an American food truck company serving gourmet &quot;chef driven&quot; grilled cheese sandwiches.

Microwavable frozen toasted sandwiches are available in supermarkets in a variety of locations. One example is the McCain Micro Toastie, which was launched in supermarkets in the UK in 2002.

<text>The Catholic Theological Society of America (CTSA) is a professional association of Catholic theologians founded in 1946 to promote studies and research in theology within the Catholic tradition. Its members are primarily in the United States and Canada.

==Role and activities==
The CTSA provides a forum for the exchange of ideas relating to theology, problems, and how to develop a more effective educational approach. The society also tries to foster within the Christian community a better understanding of their faith. It advances its work through annual June conventions, scholarly publications and committees that work throughout the year. The John Courtney Murray Award is the highest honour bestowed by the Catholic Theological Society of America, named after a theologian known for his work on religious liberty.

Several members of the society have been criticized by the Holy See&#x27;s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith or US Bishops&#x27; Conference Committee on Doctrine, including Roger Haight, Richard McBrien, Elizabeth Johnson, Peter Phan, Margaret Farley. and Charles Curran.

An internal report of the society, dated May 15, 2013, and released in October of that year, stated:

=== Women&#x27;s ordination ===
In response to &quot;Ordinatio sacerdotalis&quot;, the Catholic Theological Society of America set up a task force to study the question. The task force produced a report, &quot;Tradition and the Ordination of Women&quot;, which said that &quot;Ordinatio sacerdotalis&quot; is mistaken with regard to its claims on the authority of this teaching and its grounds in Tradition.

<doc id="661695" wikidata="Q7182631" url="?curid=661695" title="Philadelphia Bell">
<text>The Philadelphia Bell was a franchise in the World Football League, which operated in 1974 and a portion of a season in 1975. The Bell played their home games in 1974 at JFK Stadium in South Philadelphia. The team logo was a representation of the Liberty Bell. In 1975 the team decided to stop playing at JFK and moved its games to Franklin Field.

==Formation==

The Bell was one of just two WFL teams that maintained the same ownership in both 1974 and 1975 (the other being Canadian millionaire John Bassett&#x27;s Memphis Southmen). The group was headed by John B. Kelly Jr., a respected business and sportsman in Philadelphia and part of the well-known Kelly family, which included his sister Grace Kelly, movie star-turned-Princess of Monaco. The major money contributor behind the ownership group was John Bosacco, who came forward during the first season and took over the operations of the franchise. Bosacco believed that the WFL could survive and was instrumental in the removal of Gary Davidson as commissioner following the 1974 season.

==1974 season==
Led by head coach Ron Waller, the Bell appeared to be the most popular team in the fledgling league, announcing crowds of 55,534 for the home opener and 64,719 for the second home game (which was nationally televised as syndicated programming by TVS). These figures meant that, at least on the surface, the Bell were outdrawing the NFL&#x27;s Eagles, who averaged 59,206 fans for their seven home games the previous autumn.

However, when the Bell paid city taxes on the ticket sales two weeks later, it emerged that they had inflated the gate on a scale previously unprecedented in professional sports. The story was broken in the &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; on August 4, 1974, by columnist Frank Dolson. In an apparent attempt to pique interest, the Bell had sold block tickets to several area businesses at a discount, and in turn, many of these businesses had given away the tickets for free or at reduced prices. The &quot;actual&quot; paid attendance for the home opener had been only 13,855 (rather than 55,534); and for the second game a mere 6,200 (less than 10% of the announced &quot;64,719&quot;). Even worse, the WFL&#x27;s administrative vice president. Ted Palmquist, admitted to the &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot; that the league was aware of the inflating of attendance. &quot;Papergate&quot; (as it was dubbed by the press) made both the Bell and the WFL look foolish, and proved to be a debacle from which neither recovered.

After the scandal broke, attendance fell through the floor and never recovered. The Bell drew a total of only 62,126 fans— less than the supposed crowd for their second home game— for their last seven home games &quot;combined&quot;; if only paid fans for their first two games are included, the Bell drew a paltry average of 9,131 fans per game for the season. The nadir came on October 16, 1974, when only 750 fans found their way to JFK for a Wednesday night game played in a torrential downpour.

On the field, the Bell were mediocre: they were led by flashy quarterback King Corcoran, who had spent most of his career in the minor leagues due to his refusal to accept a backup QB slot (Corcoran had even played under Coach Waller with the Pottstown Firebirds of the recently closed Atlantic Coast Football League). Philadelphia managed only a 9–11 mark in 1974, one game behind the Charlotte Hornets for the final playoff spot - the Bell were actually 8–11 on the field, but were awarded a win by forfeit when the Chicago Fire dissolved before they could travel to Philadelphia for the season finale.

However, at the request of WFL officials, they advanced to the playoffs anyway in place of Charlotte as the Florida Blazers could sell only 1,000 advance tickets for the first round matchup in Orlando, which was nowhere near enough for the financially troubled Hornets (who had moved from New York City in mid-season) to cover their hotel and travel expenses. The Bell, in contrast, were somewhat better financed, and could cover these expenses. They traveled to Orlando, where they lost to the Blazers, 18-3, in front of less than 10,000 fans.

==1975 season==
Despite the Papergate fiasco, the Bell were reckoned as one of the WFL&#x27;s stronger franchises and at least had the potential to have been successful had the league been better run. Bosacco was one of only three owners, along with the Memphis Southmen&#x27;s John F. Bassett and The Hawaiians&#x27; Sam Battisone, thought to be capable of fielding a team in 1975; those three teams had been the only ones to meet payroll every week of the 1974 season.

As the 1975 season got underway, Coach Waller was replaced during training camp at Glassboro State University by future NFL Hall of Famer Willie Wood, making him the first African-American head coach of a modern pro football team.

Even on TV, the Bell couldn&#x27;t get any respect. On August 29, 1975, WTAF aired a sports doubleheader, featuring a Philadelphia Wings lacrosse match followed by the Bell&#x27;s game against the Southern California Sun in Anaheim. The football game was scheduled for 10:30 pm EDT, but since the Wings game ran long, viewers missed the beginning. Bell fans would miss the end of the contest, too: WTAF abruptly cut the broadcast off with six minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, pleading a &quot;prior commitment&quot;. The station then signed off for the night at 1:30 am; the game (won by the Sun, 58-39) didn&#x27;t end until 2:06 am. (According to a &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot; story, &quot;keeping the final six minutes of the game on TV could have cost the Bell an estimated $5,000 in telephone line charges,&quot; so the broadcast, which the club was evidently paying for, was cut off at the three-hour mark.)

The Bell had a record of 4–7 in 1975 at the time of the league&#x27;s dissolution. Attendance remained anemic, with the team&#x27;s &quot;best-&quot;attended game at Franklin Field drawing barely 5,000 fans. After only 1,293 fans attended the Bell&#x27;s October 18 contest, both the team and the WFL folded for good.

Vince Papale, the inspiration for the 2006 film &quot;Invincible&quot;, played wide receiver for the Bell for two seasons prior to his three years with the Philadelphia Eagles. Both Papale and King Corcoran had recently played in the Seaboard Football League, the minor league that was active at the time in the area.

<text>Business Dynamics is a book by John Sterman that applies system dynamics to business.

The book introduces systems dynamics modeling for the analysis of policy and strategy, with an emphasis on business and public policy applications. System dynamics is both a conceptual tool and a powerful modeling method. This allows the building of computer simulations of complex systems. These simulations can then be used to test the effectiveness of different policies on business outcomes.

<text>In computer science, a mobile agent is a piece of software agent combined with data that is able to migrate from one computer to another autonomously and continue its execution on the destination with the ability to interact with other agents there. Rather than a client requesting data and performing actions, a mobile agent is sent to a server to perform those tasks. This paradigm delegates the work from the client and onto the server.

==Definition and overview==

A &quot;mobile agent&quot; is a type of software agent, with the feature of &quot;autonomy&quot;, &quot;social ability&quot;, &quot;learning&quot;, and most significantly, &quot;mobility&quot;.

More specifically, a mobile agent is a process that can transport its state from one environment to another, with its data intact, and be capable of performing appropriately in the new environment. Mobile agents decide when and where to move. Movement is often evolved from RPC methods. Just as a user directs a web browser to &quot;visit&quot; a website (the browser merely downloads a copy of the site, or one version of it in the case of dynamic web sites), a mobile agent accomplishes a move through data duplication. When a mobile agent decides to move, it saves its own state (process image), transports this saved state to the new host and resumes execution from the saved state.

A mobile agent is a specific form of mobile code, within the field of code mobility. However, in contrast to the remote evaluation and code on demand programming paradigms, mobile agents are active in that they can &quot;choose&quot; to migrate between computers at any time during their execution. This makes them a powerful tool for implementing distributed applications in a computer network.

There are two types of mobile agents. The classification is based on their migration path.

# Mobile agents with predefined path: these have a static migration path.
# Free roaming mobile agent: these have a dynamic migration path. Depending on the present network condition, the mobile agent chooses its path.

An open multi-agent system (MAS) is a system in which agents, that are owned by a variety of stakeholders, continuously enter and leave the system.

==History and Evolution==
In the early 1990s, General Magic created the Telescript language and environment for writing and executing mobile agents, and described it with the now-popular &quot;cloud&quot; metaphor; as described by Andy Hertzfeld:

The company was unsuccessful, however.

==Advantages==
Some advantages which mobile agents have over conventional agents are:
* Computation bundles - converts computational client/server round trips to relocatable data bundles, reducing network load.
* Parallel processing -asynchronous execution on multiple heterogeneous network hosts
* Dynamic adaptation - actions are dependent on the state of the host environment
* Tolerant to network faults - able to operate without an active connection between client and server
* Flexible maintenance - to change an agent&#x27;s actions, only the source (rather than the computation hosts) must be updated
*Bandwidth conversion which is conversion the bandwidth one host to another host. 
*Reduces compilation time.
One particular advantage for remote deployment of software includes increased portability thereby making system requirements less influential.

<doc id="661703" wikidata="Q681705" url="?curid=661703" title="Jacques Lemaire">
<text>Jacques Gérard Lemaire (born September 7, 1945) is a Canadian former ice hockey forward and head coach who was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1984. He spent his entire twelve-year National Hockey League (NHL) playing career with the Montreal Canadiens (1967–1979) and was a part of eight Stanley Cup championship teams in 1968, 1969, 1971, 1973, 1976, 1977, 1978 and 1979. In 2017, Lemaire was named one of the &quot;100 Greatest NHL Players&quot;.

Lemaire was an NHL head coach for seventeen seasons with the Canadiens (1983–1985), New Jersey Devils (1993–1998, 2009–2011) and Minnesota Wild (2000–2009). One of 22 coaches with 600 wins, Lemaire led the Devils to their first Stanley Cup in the 1994–95 season.

After retiring at the end of the 2010–11 NHL season, Lemaire accepted a position as special assignment coach for the Devils. He currently works as a special assignment coach for the New York Islanders, a position he previously held with the Toronto Maple Leafs.

==Career==
===Playing career===
Lemaire is one of only six NHL players to have scored two Stanley Cup-winning goals, achieving the feat in both 1977 and 1979 (The five other players are Mike Bossy in 1982 and 1983, Bobby Orr in 1970 and 1972, Henri Richard in 1966 and 1971, Jean Béliveau in 1960 and 1965 and Toe Blake in 1944 and 1946). One of the two Cup-winners scored by Lemaire came at the 4:32 mark of the first overtime of Game Four in the 1977 Stanley Cup Finals. A model of consistency, Lemaire scored at least 20 goals in each of his 12 seasons. He retired from the NHL after the 1978–79 season to become a playing coach in Switzerland. In 853 career NHL games, he recorded 366 goals and 469 assists for a total of 835 points. Lemaire learned to execute his slapshot when he was young using a heavy steel puck, making his shot second only to that of Bobby Hull for speed and accuracy. In his bestselling book &quot;The Game&quot; former Montreal goalie Ken Dryden described a magical relationship on ice that was developing between Lemaire and Guy Lafleur, who complemented each other&#x27;s speed and shooting ability.

Lemaire&#x27;s NHL playing career ended following the 1978–79 season when he surprisingly rejected the Canadiens&#x27; contract extension offer of $225,000 for each of five years.

===Coaching career===
Lemaire signed a three-year contract as player, coach and general manager of HC Sierre on June 15, 1979. He was paid $75,000 tax-free annually and had absolute control over his contract. &quot;I always wanted to do something reckless, have an adventure, see how other people live, discover something new. Well, that time is now. I&#x27;ve always been interested in coaching, and when this opportunity presented itself, it seemed like the perfect thing,&quot; he explained.

He made his North American coaching debut in 1981, serving as an assistant coach at SUNY Plattsburgh to future NHL scout Herb Hammond at the NCAA Division III level. Lemaire was head coach of the Canadiens from 1983–1985 and the New Jersey Devils from 1993 to 1998, winning the Stanley Cup in 1995 for the 11th time, and the Jack Adams Award in 1994 and 2003. Lemaire was head coach of the Minnesota Wild from June 19, 2000 until April 11, 2009, the first head coach of the organization. He also won two more Stanley Cups as assistant general manager with Montreal in 1986 and 1993.

Lemaire is known for his unorthodox coaching style for several reasons: first, he prefers a defensive-minded system, often using a strategy called the &quot;neutral zone trap&quot;. Second, Lemaire rarely uses permanent lines preferring to use mixed line combinations during games. Third, Lemaire never employed a permanent team captain during his tenure with the Wild, opting to rotate it on a monthly basis amongst the players. Lemaire is also regarded as one of the best teaching coaches – developing young players while working well with veterans. However his emphasis on &quot;defense first&quot; has often been controversial, both inside and outside the dressing room. This, perhaps, has led to some conflict with star players like Marian Gaborik (formerly with the Wild) and media criticism. An example was provided by Terry Frei of ESPN.com in an article posted on August 4, 2008:

He [Lemaire] helped drag down the entertainment quotient in this league, and despite all the talk about the Wild being a skating team that uses speed and pounces on turnovers, not all the elements of the trap have disappeared from Minnesota&#x27;s game. You&#x27;d think the State of Hockey is going to tire of that at some point, especially if the Wild slide this season and it drives Marian Gaborik away next summer.

On one occasion, Lemaire&#x27;s team was among the top two scoring teams in the NHL. In 1993–1994, the New Jersey Devils team scored the second most goals in the league (306).

In June 2009, Lemaire was named assistant coach of Team Canada for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia. He joined Lindy Ruff and Ken Hitchcock as assistants to head coach Mike Babcock and helped Team Canada to the gold medal.

On July 13, 2009, exactly two years after Brent Sutter had been introduced as coach of the Devils, Lemaire returned to the head coaching position for the Devils.

On October 8, 2009, Lemaire got his 200th win with the New Jersey Devils and first of the 2009–10 NHL season.

Lemaire announced his retirement as a head coach in the NHL on April 26, 2010. However, on December 23, 2010, after Devils head coach John MacLean was fired after 33 games, Lemaire came out of retirement to coach once again for the Devils and led a charge that took the team from the bottom of league standings into contention for a playoff position before fading in the final few weeks.

On February 10, 2011, Lemaire achieved his 600th regular-season win after Ilya Kovalchuk scored in overtime to win the game for New Jersey against Toronto 2 – 1. Lemaire became only the eighth coach in NHL history to achieve this feat.

On April 10, 2011 Lemaire announced his permanent retirement from the Devils.

On August 14, 2015, the Toronto Maple Leafs announced they had hired Lemaire as a special assignment coach.

On September 14, 2018, Lemaire would follow Lou Lamoriello to the New York Islanders, assuming the role of Special Assignment Coach. Lemaire was inducted into the New Jersey Devils Ring of Honor on January 22, 2025.

===Trivia===
Lemaire is the uncle of former Stars, Wild, and Bruins goaltender Manny Fernandez.

There is a hockey arena in LaSalle, Quebec named after Lemaire.

<text>Cross Generation Comics or CrossGen Comics was an American comic book publisher and entertainment company that operated from 1998 to 2004. The company&#x27;s assets were acquired by The Walt Disney Company in 2004, and designated to Disney Publishing Worldwide. In July 2010, Disney re-established the brand through Marvel Comics, who announced plans to revive CrossGen titles.

==History==
CrossGen Comics, Inc., was founded in 1998, in Tampa, Florida, by entrepreneur Mark Alessi.

In 1999, the company acquired the Orlando-based multi-genre fan convention MegaCon, from founder James Breitbiel. Breitbiel became CrossGen&#x27;s Marketing and Distribution Director.

In January 2000, CrossGen Comics, Inc. debuted with &quot;CrossGenesis&quot;, a sneak-peek at the CrossGen universe. It provided an outline of the universe, worlds, and characters of CrossGen&#x27;s flagship titles that would be released six months later. Gina M. Villa, head of creative departments, and Mark Alessi wrote a history of the Sigilverse before any comics were written. The head creative team consisted of Barbara Kesel, Mark Waid and Ron Marz. Unlike other comics publishers such as DC Comics and Marvel Comics, which rely mainly on freelance writers and artists, most of CrossGen&#x27;s talent were salaried employees of the company and worked out of its headquarters in Oldsmar, Florida. Later creators such as J.M. DeMatteis worked freelance, with CrossGen publishing finished properties. The company&#x27;s publications covered a variety of genres with characters inhabiting a single shared universe.

===First wave===
The first wave of CrossGen titles included: &quot;Sigil&quot;, a military science fiction space opera; &quot;Mystic&quot;, a magical fantasy; &quot;Meridian&quot;, flavored by traditional folklore;
&quot;&quot;Scion&quot;&quot;, an adventure series inspired by tales of King Arthur; and &quot;CrossGen Chronicles&quot;, a series detailing the &quot;untold&quot; history of the CrossGen universe.

The protagonists of the first wave of CrossGen comics were linked in commonality by the Sigil each character had received. It was a branding on their body, a marking that granted them unusual powers. The Sigil, and the story of the Sigil-Bearers, was a prominent aspect of the narrative.

===Following titles===
In November 2000, the Homeric myth &quot;The First&quot; was released and, steadily over the next three years, CrossGen released many more titles.

The following were released in 2001: &quot;Crux&quot; (based on the Atlantean myth); &quot;Sojourn&quot; (an epic fantasy in the style of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;); &quot;Ruse&quot; (a Victorian detective story); and &quot;Negation&quot;.

In the following year, these titles were released: the horror story &quot;Route 666&quot;; the wuxia comedy &quot;Way of the Rat&quot;; and the samurai drama &quot;The Path&quot;.

The company enjoyed great initial success, with fifteen Harvey Award nominations in 2002.

In 2003, other titles were released expanding the fictional universe: the sword and sorcery epic &quot;Brath&quot;;
&quot;Chimera&quot;, a limited series about a Sigil-bearer on the far reaches of the Universe; the pirate adventure &quot;El Cazador&quot;; and two other titles that explain the origin of the Sigil-bearers, &quot;Solus&quot; and &quot;Mark of Charon&quot;.

Titles such as &quot;Negation&quot; and &quot;Crux&quot; blended genres. Although most CrossGen titles shared common elements (such as a Sigil, the presence of a Mentor and a member of the god-like First), the titles rarely crossed over with each other. The major example of crossing over was Sam of &quot;Sigil&quot;, who spent four issues in the world of &quot;Brath&quot; and part of one issue in the world of &quot;Meridan&quot;, with the latter period also being told from Sephie&#x27;s perspective in issue #20 of &quot;Meridan&quot;. There was one company-crossover event, the &quot;Negation War&quot;, but was never concluded.

===CrossGen Entertainment, Inc. (CGE)===

In 2003, CrossGen Comics, Inc. changed its name to CrossGen Entertainment, Inc. (CGE), and formed eleven wholly owned subsidiary companies, which represented its broad-based entertainment products and offerings. These companies were to act independently of CGE, functioning as interior business units while all working towards CGE&#x27;s overall goals. With this arrangement, all current and future projects would be managed and guided by Crossgen&#x27;s founding principles. These projects consisted of:

* CrossGen Intellectual Property, LLC: CGIP held all CGE content intellectual property (IP).
* CrossGen Technologies, LLC: CGT held all CGE technology IP and managed technology IP creation, development, production, and application.
* CrossGen Publishing, LLC: CGPub published all print projects, including CGE Ancillary, Code 6, CrossGen Universe, and foreign publishing.
* Code 6 Comics, LLC: A subsidiary of CGPub, C6C published Code 6 publications.
** CrossGen Comics, LLC: A subsidiary of CGPub, CGC published CGU print publications.
* CrossGen Media, LLC: CGM was responsible for feature films, television programs, video games, websites, merchandise, and additional interactive products.
* CrossGen Productions, LLC: A subsidiary of CGM, CGP was to produce feature films and television programs.
* CrossGen Interactive, LLC: A subsidiary of CGM, CGI was responsible for interactive publishing, video games, and role-playing games.
* MegaCon, LLC: MGC managed the MegaCon convention.
* CrossGen Education, LLC: CGEd published educational materials.
* Comics On The Web, LLC: COW was responsible for Internet publishing, including Comics On The Web.

CrossGen Comics Entertainment, Inc.(CGE) was set up to take over the publishing of all existing comics properties. Its logo would appear on anything that came from CrossGen. CGE acted as a publisher for affiliated companies that would retain full ownership and control of their property and would reap the benefits of joining with a larger company.

====Code6====

Code6 was another imprint of CrossGen Entertainment created to publish titles set outside of the &quot;Sigilverse&quot;, such as &quot;The Red Star&quot;, &quot;Demonwars&quot;, and &quot;The Crossovers&quot;. All titles published with the Code6 logo would be owned by both the creator and CrossGen Entertainment, Inc. with the majority of ownership resting with CGE. CrossGen would pay an upfront page rate and then split all rights and revenues 75%-25%.

Code6 is the Florida Police signal code for an escaped prisoner. It was used to describe the attitude of the creators working at Code6.

====Comics on the Web (COW)====
One of Crossgen&#x27;s innovations was the sale of comic subscriptions via the Internet. Subscribers could view all of Crossgen&#x27;s titles through a web browser. The web comics reproduced the fine color of the original, but the lettering was sometimes not quite legible; hovering over the word or thought bubble caused it to enlarge to a readable size, a feature developed in Flash by Gabo Mendoza of Gabocorp Studios. The online library was estimated to contain 160 issues and 4,400 pages by the end of 2002. CrossGen was among the first comics companies to publish online.

===Bankruptcy===
In 2003, CrossGen found itself in a scandal over freelancer payments, exposing systemic financial problems. As the news reached comics fans, sales were affected and creative staff, such as Gina Villa, Brandon Peterson, and Ron Marz, began to abandon the company.

Some industry observers noted that the company&#x27;s difficulties became apparent shortly after the Borders and Barnes &amp; Noble bookstore chains discontinued stocking CrossGen&#x27;s trade paperback collections, and returned huge numbers of unsold books for credit/refund, more than wiping out the publisher&#x27;s optimistically low reserves against returns. In an interview with Marc Alessi on the &quot;Dollar Bin&quot; podcast, the root cause of CrossGen&#x27;s financial collapse was said to be the result of a large decrease in the value of Perot Systems stock that was largely backing the company&#x27;s financing. The financial plan was to lose money in the first six years before earning profits in the seventh year through movie and television deals.

In late 2003 the company restructured, selling MegaCon to show organizer Elizabeth Widera.

CrossGen filed for bankruptcy in June 2004 and ceased publishing, leaving titles such as &quot;Sojourn&quot;, &quot;Negation War&quot;, &quot;Brath&quot;, and many others cancelled mid-story.

In July 2004, Disney Publishing was interested in licensing CrossGen content but, upon discovering the company&#x27;s bankruptcy, began seeking to acquire its assets instead. Founder Alessi loaned the company $75,000, but was unable to prevent the company&#x27;s takeover. On November 15, Disney purchased CrossGen&#x27;s assets for $1 million with plans to publish four prose hardcover novels based on writer J.M. DeMatteis and artist Mike Ploog&#x27;s &quot;Abadazad&quot;.

CGCreators.net was created to attempt to track the subsequent doings of various staff associated with the company. It has since ceased operations.

As of 2008, various CrossGen domain names and URLs were held by cybersquatters.

===Checker Books===
In 2006, Checker Books obtained the rights to publish trade collections of various CrossGen series, starting with &quot;Sojourn&quot;. A total of nine collected editions were part of the agreement: two each for &quot;Sojourn&quot;, &quot;Negation&quot;, and &quot;Scion&quot;, and single volumes for &quot;The Way of the Rat&quot;, &quot;Sigil&quot;, and &quot;The Path&quot;. There are no plans by Checker Books for more traveler-sized collections.

Mark Thompson, the publisher of Checker Books, traveled to New York in 2007 and spoke with Disney representatives about reprinting further collections. No agreement has been made at the time, but according to Mark Thompson, he indicated that this would happen. In a quick follow-up interview he expanded on things, explaining how difficult it has been to pin down what is considered &#x27;full distributed&#x27; and to solve this they are: &quot;planning to propose to Disney that we &#x27;catch up&#x27; by putting out omnibus collections&quot;.

In 2008, Checker Books published three CrossGen titles. These were:

* &quot;Negation Hounded, Vol. 3&quot; (writer Tony Bedard, illustrator Paul Pelletier, , 172 pages)
* &quot;Sigil V. 6 Planetary Union&quot; (writer Chuck Dixon illustrator Scott Eaton, , 172 pages)
* &quot;Sojourn Volume 6 - The Berzerker&#x27;s Tale&quot; (writer Ian Edginton, illustrator Greg Land, , 172 pages)

===Revival===
In July 2010, Marvel Comics&#x27; editor-in-chief Joe Quesada announced at San Diego Comic-Con that Marvel (also a Disney-owned company) would revive a number of CrossGen titles.

Marvel began to publish &quot;Ruse&quot; and &quot;Sigil&quot; in March 2011 as four-issue miniseries. Both completed their run, and a third Crossgen title, &quot;Mystic&quot;, premiered in August 2011. Two more books, &quot;Route 666&quot; and &quot;Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&quot;, were announced during Fan Expo Canada in late August, and were set to start in February 2012, but were never published due to low interest in the previously released series.

In August 2022, Marvel Comics announced &quot;CrossGen Tales&quot; #1, a trade paperback collection that contains the reprinted original first issues of &quot;Mystic&quot;, &quot;Sigil&quot;, &quot;Ruse&quot;, and &quot;Soujourn&quot;. This was the first time that CrossGen titles would be available in a digital format. An omnibus collection of the original &quot;Sigil&quot; series was released in 2023.

In September 2024, every issue of &quot;Mystic&quot; appeared within the Marvel Unlimited app. Each issue displays the Marvel logo in the place where the CrossGen logo used to be.

==Titles==
===Sigilverse===
The majority of CrossGen&#x27;s titles took place within a shared universe, informally dubbed &quot;the Sigilverse&quot; by CrossGen fans. CrossGen published the following titles in the Sigilverse. Most titles are listed in order of appearance. Mini-series and one-shots associated with an ongoing title are listed thereunder.
CrossGen collected several of the above titles in trade paperback format.

===Compendia===
CrossGen published two monthly anthologies, referred to as compendia, that reprinted several titles from the main shared continuity. Each issue contained between 6 and 11 issues.
* &quot;Forge&quot; (13 issues, reprints of &quot;Crux&quot;, &quot;Meridian&quot;, &quot;Negation&quot;, &quot;Sojourn&quot;, &quot;The Path&quot;, &quot;Route 666&quot;)
* &quot;Edge/Vector&quot; (13 issues, reprints of &quot;The First&quot;, &quot;Mystic&quot;, &quot;Ruse&quot;, &quot;Scion&quot;, &quot;Sigil&quot;, &quot;Way of the Rat&quot;, and &quot;Solus&quot;)
After 12 issues, &quot;Edge&quot; was renamed &quot;Vector&quot; due to a trademark conflict with another company. A third compendium called &quot;Caravan&quot; was never released.

Roughly halfway through the run of the compendia, their format changed from standard comic size to a half-page sized digest format, usually with a higher page count. CrossGen later used this compendium format to collect runs of single titles, such as &quot;Meridian&quot; and &quot;The Path&quot;, to reported success.

===Promotional and related titles===
* &quot;CrossGen Sampler&quot; (a free promotional comic which included several pages from each of CrossGen&#x27;s first five titles)
* &quot;CrossGen Primer&quot; (a promotional comic bundled with an issue of &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine)
* &quot;Wizard CrossGen Special&quot; (a later promotional comic bundled with &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine)
* &quot;CrossGen Illustrated&quot; (softcover book with art and information on several Sigilverse titles)
* Pre-release &quot;Reader review copies&quot; of the first issue of several series, some in black and white.

===Additional titles===
In addition to its Sigilverse comics, CrossGen published a number of additional titles:

<text>Roller Hockey International was a professional inline hockey league that operated in North America from 1993 to 1999. It was the first major professional league for inline hockey.

== History ==
League president Dennis Murphy had been involved in the establishment of the American Basketball Association, World Hockey Association and World TeamTennis. RHI hoped to capitalize on the inline skating boom of the early 1990s. Key parts of its success were its stance on no guaranteed contracts, instead teams would all split prize money.

Teams were generally made up of minor league ice hockey players playing on inline skates during the summer months between ice seasons.

Murphy saw big potential for the sport and believed that inline hockey could become the number one hockey sport in the US. The league had plans to expand to up to 24 teams, including some from Europe, by 1997. However, RHI became known for its unstable franchises, instability in the league&#x27;s front office itself, little media coverage and many teams struggling to attract crowds - while the Anaheim Bullfrogs led in attendance with an average of 9,800 per game, seven teams attracted less than 4,000 per game on average, while the whole league&#x27;s attendance averaged around 5,000 by 1996.

Ultimately, after five seasons of play and a fading in the inline skating boom, RHI folded in 1998 with two of its franchises joining Major League Roller Hockey: the Buffalo Wings and its premier club, the Anaheim Bullfrogs. RHI was revived in 1999, with a 10-team roster that included five holdovers that had played in RHI in 1997: the Anaheim Bullfrogs, Buffalo Wings, Minnesota Blue Ox, San Jose Rhinos and St. Louis Vipers.

The league cancelled the 2000 season and the league finally ceased operations in 2001 when their sites were limited to arenas in California.

The St. Louis Vipers were resurrected in 2020 as an expansion team of the National Roller Hockey League.

==Rules==
The rules in the RHI were similar to but not identical to those of ice hockey. Besides the obvious difference of playing on a floor instead of ice, the RHI had four players and a goalie at a time on the playing surface opposed to ice hockey&#x27;s five and a goalie. Minor penalties were only a minute and a half as opposed to two minutes and major penalties were four minutes instead of five.

There were no blue lines and therefore no offside; however, there was still illegal clearing (icing) and a different version of offside—a player could skate over the red line before the puck; however, the player couldn&#x27;t receive a pass over the line. The puck itself was lighter, at 3 oz. and made of red plastic as opposed to a 5 oz. black rubber ice hockey puck. There were four 12-minute quarters opposed to the NHL&#x27;s three 20-minute periods. A tied score at the end of regulation time in the regular season would go straight to a shootout instead of overtime.

The playoffs followed a best-of-three series format; however, the third game was not a full 48 minute game. Instead it was just a regular 12-minute quarter called &quot;the mini game&quot;. If the teams were tied at the end of the quarter a sudden-death overtime period would follow.

==Expansion==
==Conferences==
The Eastern Conference and Western Conference were created when RHI doubled in size to 24 teams in 1994 after its first series of expansion and realigned its teams into two conferences and four divisions. Prior to the 1994 realignment, Roller Hockey International divided its teams into only three divisions and no conferences.

From 1994 through 1996, the Eastern Conference was divided into the Atlantic Division and the Central Division, which were both successors to the Murphy Division. Starting in 1997, the conferences had no divisions.

From 1994 through 1996, the Western Conference comprised teams divided into two divisions: Northwest Division and Pacific Division. Starting in 1997 the conferences had no divisions.

== Licensing ==
The league inspired at least one video game, Super Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;RHI Roller Hockey &#x27;95,&quot; although the game was never released.

There was also a call-in style stats, scores and interview hotline where fans could call in following games. The phone number was 1-800-741-4RHI. This line was updated nightly following each game.

==Media coverage==

In the 1994 and &#x27;95 seasons, there was a regular schedule of games on ESPN2. Craig Minervini was the lead play-by-play man for ESPN2 coverage and also hosted the recap show &quot;RHI Rewind&quot; on the network.

In addition, several teams had their own radio or TV contracts. For example, a number of Blades home games were seen on Prime Sports and the Bullfrogs had radio broadcasts from 1994 to &#x27;96.

<text>Pep Boys is an American automotive aftermarket service chain. Originally named Pep Auto Supply, the company was founded in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1921 by Emanuel &quot;Manny&quot; Rosenfeld, Maurice &quot;Moe&quot; Strauss, W. Graham &quot;Jack&quot; Jackson, and Moe Radavitz. Pep Boys is headquartered in the Philadelphia suburb of Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania.

Pep Boys provides name-brand tires, automotive maintenance and repair, and fleet maintenance and repair to customers across the United States. As of 2016, Pep Boys operated more than 9,000 service bays in 35 states and Puerto Rico. They also offer the Pep Boys Mobile Crew service trailer, which offers automotive maintenance on location.

==History==

===Early history===
The original &quot;Pep Boys&quot; were Emmanuel &quot;Manny&quot; Rosenfeld, Maurice &quot;Moe&quot; Strauss, Graham &quot;Jack&quot; Jackson, and Moe Radavitz, four friends who, in August 1921, chipped in $200 apiece to open a single auto parts store. They dubbed it Pep Auto Supply Company after noticing a shipment of Pep Valve grinding compound on the shelves.

The name of the company emerged in pieces. &quot;The Pep Boys&quot; came from a policeman who worked near the store: Every time the officer stopped a car for driving without lights during nighttime hours, he would tell the driver, &quot;Go see the boys at Pep&quot; for a replacement oil wick, which was what was used as automotive headlights before the switch to electrical headlamps.

A few years later, while on a trip to California, Moe Strauss noticed that many successful West Coast businesses used their owners&#x27; first names. One he particularly liked was a dress shop called &quot;Minnie, Maude and Mabel&#x27;s&quot;. As soon as Strauss returned to Philadelphia, the company&#x27;s name was officially changed to &quot;The Pep Boys – Manny, Moe &amp; Jack&quot;. Radavitz had cashed out the previous year and was no longer a partner.

Shortly after, the partners commissioned the Manny, Moe and Jack caricatures that still serve as the company&#x27;s logo. When Jackson left in 1927, his caricature was replaced with that of Moe&#x27;s brother, Isadore (Izzy) Strauss. In 1929, Izzy Strauss left to form his own auto supply business in Brooklyn, Strauss Stores, which later merged with Roth &amp; Schlenger Home and Auto to form R&amp;S Strauss, the predecessor of Strauss Discount Auto, later known as Strauss Auto, which closed its doors on June 4, 2012. The company name&#x27;s reference to &quot;Jack&quot; remained unchanged. No further changes were made to the logo until 1990, when Manny&#x27;s cigar was removed.

The Great Depression struck in 1929, but Manny and Moe had not incurred business debts other than reasonable mortgages on store properties. Pep Boys was thereby insulated from the severe downturn that destroyed so many other businesses. Although unemployment rates reached 40 percent in some areas, Manny and Moe did not lay off employees or cut salaries during the Depression. In 1933, Manny&#x27;s brother, Murray Rosenfeld, opened the first West Coast Pep Boys store as part of a separate company named The Pep Boys - Manny, Moe &amp; Jack of California and managed the Western operations. Within three years, Pep Boys of California had opened 11 stores.

In 1945, Pep Boys went public, and Manny Rosenfeld became the company&#x27;s first corporate president, a position he held until his death in 1959. Shortly after Manny&#x27;s death, Moe Strauss took over and served as president from 1960 to 1966 and remained chairman of the board of directors until his death in 1982. In 1986, Mitch Leibovitz became the first non-founding family member to be named company president. Manny&#x27;s grandson, Stuart Rosenfeld, Pep Boys&#x27; vice president of distribution, is the only founding family member currently in company management. The Strauss and Rosenfeld families continued to control approximately one-fifth of the company&#x27;s stock until the early 1990s.

By 1969, the number of Pep Boys stores grew to 1249 Service bays and service managers were added to each store. In the 1970s, all stores had self-serviced merchandising and a computerized inventory system was in use.

In the 1980s, came aggressive growth. Pep Boys moved to the New York Stock Exchange and enjoyed rapid expansion with the introduction of the &quot;supercenter.&quot; The store count grew to more than 7009 and the company had more than 3,000 service bays. It generated more than $2 billion in annual sales.

In the 1990s, growth continued with the opening of stores in Puerto Rico.

===2000-present===
In January 2003, Mitch Leibovitz announced his retirement. Larry Stevenson, from the Canadian book retailer Chapters, was named CEO later that year and served until pressured by the company&#x27;s two largest shareholders to resign in July 2006. In March 2007, Jeffrey C. Rachor was named CEO.

The following year, Pep Boys Chief Operating Officer Michael &quot;Mike&quot; R. Odell became Interim CEO with the resignation of Jeff Rachor. In September 2008, Odell was named CEO.

In October 2009, Pep Boys acquired tire retailer Florida Tire. The acquisition gave Pep Boys ten service and tire centers in the Orlando market.

In March 2011, Pep Boys acquired seven stores from tire retailer Big O Tires. The acquisition gave Pep Boys service and tire centers in Washington state, in the Pacific Northwest. In May 2011, Pep Boys acquired tire retailer Big 10 Tires. The acquisition gave Pep Boys an additional 84 service and tire centers in Alabama, Florida, and Georgia, including concentrations around Atlanta and Orlando. In June 2011, Pep Boys acquired seven locations from automotive repair company My Mechanic. The acquisition gave Pep Boys additional locations in the Houston, Texas metropolitan area.

In January 2012, Pep Boys announced that it had agreed to be acquired by The Gores Group, a Los Angeles-based private equity investment company, for $15 per share, or approximately $1 billion. But four months later, in May 2012, it was announced that the deal had fallen through. In September 2013, Pep Boys acquired 18 Discount Tire Centers in Southern California, enabling the company to boast, &quot;Seventy-five percent of Los Angeles-area residents now live within three miles of Pep Boys.&quot; In September 2014, Mike Odell resigned as president and CEO and John Sweetwood became Interim CEO.

In June 2015, Scott P. Sider, group president of Hertz Corporation&#x27;s Rent A Car Americas, became the company&#x27;s new CEO. In October 2015, Bridgestone Retail Operations, a wholly owned subsidiary of Bridgestone Americas, Inc., agreed to purchase the company for $835,000,000.

However, in December 2015, Pep Boys terminated the previously announced acquisition deal with Bridgestone and signed a merger agreement with Icahn Automotive Group, a subsidiary of Icahn Enterprises. In February 2016, Icahn announced that it completed its acquisition of Pep Boys in an all-cash transaction for $18.50 per share or approximately $1.03 billion.

In January 2017, Pep Boys acquired Just Brakes, a 134-store automotive repair and maintenance chain, which became a wholly owned subsidiary of Pep Boys. In March 2017, Dan A. Ninivaggi, Co-Chief Executive Officer and Co-Chairman of the Board of Directors of Federal-Mogul LLC and Chief Executive Officer of Federal-Mogul Motorparts, became the company&#x27;s new CEO.

In April 2019, Icahn Enterprises, which owns and operates Pep Boys, announced new fleet-specific Pep Boys Mobile Crew vehicles to provide on-location maintenance and repair. The move adds smaller-format fleet vans to the Pep Boys Mobile Crew equipped with repair supplies and staffed by trained technicians to complete common fleet maintenance and repair needs on-location.

In September 2019, Pep Boys agreed to pay $3.7 million to settle a lawsuit alleging the company violated California laws by illegally dumping hazardous waste. Inspectors from the Alameda County District Attorney&#x27;s office allegedly found numerous instances of unlawful disposal of hazardous waste by the company, including automotive fluids, batteries, aerosol cans, electronic devices, used oil, and other regulated wastes.

Beginning in early 2021, Pep Boys began to split parts and service into two separate companies. While service would remain with Pep Boys, parts would be operated by Auto Plus Auto Parts. Each company would operate under separate leadership. Auto Plus operated multiple independent and branded building, but also operates parts inside of Pep Boys locations. As of 2022, all buildings remain branded Pep Boys despite Auto Plus operating inside. Auto Plus is led by President Joe Ferrer. On January 31, 2023, Auto Plus filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and Pep Boys would be spun off by the bankruptcy into its own separate company.

In February 2023, Scott Collette was appointed as the new CEO of Pep Boys. In December 2023, Pep Boys announced the company had completed its transition away from retail operations to focus exclusively on automotive services, including its locations in Puerto Rico. 

In February 2024, David Willetts was appointed as CEO of Pep Boys, with Scott Collette transitioning to Chief Operating Officer, marking a leadership shift during a period of significant organizational change. In September 2024, Joe Auriemma, who was Chief Marketing Officer, was named interim CEO of the chain.

<text>Max Neuhaus (August 9, 1939 – February 3, 2009) was an American musician, composer and artist who was a noted interpreter of contemporary and experimental percussion music in the 1960s. He went on to create numerous permanent and short-term sound installations in the four decades that followed.

==Biography==
Neuhaus was born on August 9, 1939, in Beaumont, Texas, and attended high school in Houston. He studied percussion with Paul Price at the Manhattan School of Music, graduating with a master of music degree in 1962. He performed as a percussion soloist on concert tours throughout the United States with Pierre Boulez (1962-1963) and Karlheinz Stockhausen (1963-1964). In 1964 and 1965, he presented solo recitals in Carnegie Hall in New York City and in fifteen major European cities. In 1966, he published on Mass Art Inc. four live realizations of John Cage&#x27;s &quot;Fontana Mix&quot; (1958), an indeterminate graphic score originally intended for a tape piece, with or without additional instruments. Entitled &quot;Fontana Mix-Feed&quot;, Neuhaus&#x27; realizations employed controlled feedback generated by placing contact microphones on percussive instruments and hooking the microphones up to loudspeakers positioned directly opposite the instruments.

His work as a percussionist culminated in an album of contemporary solo percussion work, &quot;Electronics &amp; Percussion - Five Realizations By Max Neuhaus&quot;, which he recorded for Columbia Masterworks in 1968, and was produced by David Behrman.

In 1968, he pursued a career as a contemporary artist by developing sound installations, using electronic or electroacoustic sounds which would emanate from a source within a particular space or location. He coined the term &quot;sound installation&quot; to describe his sound works which were neither music nor events. 

Neuhaus&#x27; first work as an independent artist was a series of walks called Listen (1966-1976). He invited audiences to walk with him through the streets of New York City, with the word listen stamped on their hand. As the work progressed, Neuhaus stopped leading the walks, instead sending postcards/stickers to audience members, that they can leave in their city.

Neuhaus&#x27; first permanent installation was &quot;Times Square&quot; in New York City. It is situated beneath a grate on a traffic island in Manhattan pedestrians are &quot;enveloped by a deeply resonant and mildly undulating drone, its tone suggestive of low-pitched chimes or church bells.&quot; Originally installed from 1977 to 1992, it was restored in 2002 by the Dia Art Foundation.

Other works included penny whistles heard underwater in swimming pools, electronic sounds within an arboretum and the modified sounds of listeners whistling tunes over public radio. Neuhaus&#x27; permanent sound installations are found in these locations:
*The Menil Collection, Houston, US
*Synagogue Stommeln, Stommeln, Germany
*Promenade du Pin, Geneva, Switzerland

*AOK Hessen – Beratungscenter Kassel-City, Kassel, Germany
*Castello di Rivoli, Torino, Italy
*Kunsthaus Graz, Graz, Austria

==Personal life==
Neuhaus was married with Silvia Cecere in 1996. Together they had a daughter named Claudia. Neuhaus died of cancer in his home of Maratea, Italy on February 3, 2009.

<doc id="661719" wikidata="Q4659417" url="?curid=661719" title="A Separate Peace">
<text>A Separate Peace is a coming-of-age novel by John Knowles, published in 1959. Based on his earlier short story &quot;Phineas&quot;, published in the May 1956 issue of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, it was Knowles&#x27;s first published novel and became his best-known work. Set against the backdrop of World War II, &quot;A Separate Peace&quot; explores morality, patriotism, and loss of innocence through its narrator, Gene Forrester, in his relationship with classmate and friend Phineas.

== Plot summary ==
Gene Forrester returns to his old prep school, Devon (a potential reflection of Knowles&#x27;s real life alma mater, Phillips Exeter Academy), 15 years after he graduated, to visit two places he regards as &quot;fearful sites&quot;: a flight of marble stairs, and a big tree by the river. He first examines the stairs, noticing they are made of marble. When he examines the tree, he begins to reflect upon memories of his time as a student at Devon. This exposition opens the reader into the rest of the novel, which follows Gene&#x27;s life from the summer of 1942 to the summer of 1943. In 1942, he is 16 and living at Devon with his best friend and roommate, Phineas (nicknamed Finny). World War II is raging and has a prominent effect on the story&#x27;s plot and characters.

Despite being opposites in personality, Gene and Finny are surprisingly close friends. Gene&#x27;s quiet, introverted, intellectual personality is a character foil for Finny&#x27;s extroverted, carefree athleticism. One of Finny&#x27;s ideas during their &quot;gypsy summer&quot; of 1942 is to create a &quot;Super Suicide Society of the Summer Session,&quot; with Gene and himself as charter members. Finny creates a rite of initiation by having members jump into the Devon River from a large tall tree. At one point, both Gene and Finny are in the tree, and Gene nearly falls, but Finny grabs him, thus saving his life, and creating resentment. Gene is even more resentful of how Finny frequently breaks rules and gets off easy, because of his charm and the school staff being too occupied with the war effort to notice or care.

Gene and Finny&#x27;s friendship goes through a period of one-sided rivalry during which Gene strives to outdo Finny scholastically as he believes that Finny is trying to outdo him athletically. The rivalry begins with Gene&#x27;s envy toward Finny. It climaxes and ends when as Finny and Gene are about to jump off the tree, Gene impulsively jounces the limb that they&#x27;re on, causing Finny to fall and shatter his leg, which permanently cripples him. Because of his accident, Finny learns that he will never again be able to compete in sports, which are most dear to him.

Finny&#x27;s &quot;accident&quot; inspires Gene to think more like his friend to become a better person, free of envy. The remainder of the story revolves around Gene&#x27;s attempts to come to grips with who he is, why he shook the branch, and how he will proceed. Gene feels so guilty that he eventually tells Finny that he caused the fall. At first, Finny does not believe him, but then comes to feel extremely hurt.

World War II soon occupies the boys&#x27; time, with fellow student Brinker Hadley rallying the boys to help the war effort and Gene&#x27;s quiet friend Leper Lepellier joining the Ski Troops, which leads to him getting discharged from the military under Section 8 due to being unable to sleep during basic training.

During a meeting of the Golden Fleece Debating Society, Brinker sets up a show trial of sorts and, based upon his shaking of the branch, accuses Gene of trying to kill Finny. Faced with the evidence, Finny leaves shamefully before Gene&#x27;s deed is confirmed. On his way out, Finny falls down a flight of stairs, the same ones that Gene visited at the beginning of the novel, and again breaks the leg that he had shattered before. Finny at first dismisses Gene&#x27;s attempts to apologize, but he soon realizes that the &quot;accident&quot; was impulsive and not premeditated or based on anger. The two forgive each other.

The next day, Finny dies during the operation to set the bone when bone marrow enters his bloodstream during the surgery.

After they graduate, Gene and Brinker enlist in the Navy and the Coast Guard. Gene observes that many people lash out at others to protect themselves from their own insecurities. The only person he knew who did not do that was Finny, the only person Gene knew to be truly honest, and the only person he knew never to have an internal war to fight. Back in the present, an older Gene muses on peace, war, and enemies.

== Characters ==
* Gene Forrester: &quot;A Separate Peace&quot; is told from Gene&#x27;s point of view. He focuses on and succeeds at academics. He envies his roommate and best friend Finny&#x27;s graceful, easy athleticism and social prowess but also admires these very features. Gene is from &quot;three states from Texas;” being somewhat unaccustomed to Northeastern culture, he is an outsider of sorts at Devon. Gene shakes a branch which causes his best friend, Finny, to fall from a tree and break his leg, but it is ambiguous whether the move is deliberate or not. 
* Phineas (Finny): Gene&#x27;s friend and roommate; an incorrigible, good-natured, carefree, athletic, daredevil type. In Gene&#x27;s opinion, Finny can never leave anything well enough alone and can always get away with anything. He always sees the best in others, seeks internal fulfilment free of accolades, and shapes the world around himself to fit his desires. He is a prodigious athlete, who succeeds in every sport until his leg is shattered in his fall from the tree.
* Brinker Hadley: Brinker is a classmate and friend of Gene and Finny. He ceaselessly strives for order during the Winter Session at Devon. Brinker wants to get to the bottom of Finny&#x27;s accident, but it is unclear if he intended for the investigation to be a practical joke. He organizes the &quot;midnight trial&quot; to confront and to accuse Gene of causing Finny&#x27;s accident. During the questioning of Finny by Brinker, Finny changes the story to make Gene appear innocent of his actions in the tree. Finny cites Lepellier as an unreachable witness. Brinker ultimately reconciles with Gene, who appears to forgive him both for his part in Finny&#x27;s injury and for the trial. Brinker was based on Knowles&#x27; Phillips Exeter Academy classmate and friend Gore Vidal.
* Elwin &quot;Leper&quot; Lepellier: Leper is Finny and Gene&#x27;s friend and a key member of the Super Suicide Society of the Summer Session. He is the first student in his class to enlist in the military. Late in the novel, Leper enlists in the Ski Troops, but is discharged due to being unable to sleep during basic training. He is a witness at Gene&#x27;s &quot;trial&quot; and testifies that he saw someone jounce the limb when Finny fell but does not state who did it because he hates Brinker and thinks it is a trap.

== Themes, motifs and symbols ==
&quot;A Separate Peace&quot; contains many themes, motifs and symbols, which occur throughout the book. Some of them are present throughout the book, like the tree Finny falls off and the presence and significance of sport. Other themes exist as part of Gene&#x27;s consciousness and his relationship with Finny, such as the threat of codependency and the creation of inner enemies. In addition, there are many ambiguous factors that remain unresolved, such as the reliability of Gene as a narrator and whether Gene was responsible for the fall.

=== Co-dependency and identity ===
The central relationship between Gene and Finny is a model of codependency. After the fall, the two become reliant on each other for fulfilment. Gene&#x27;s submissive nature leads to his lacking a strong identity without Finny. Finny, with his free, sport-loving spirit, can only be fulfilled by experiencing the sport through Gene after the fall. That is furthered by the characters&#x27; notion that World War II is merely a conspiracy, which creates a private illusion in which both Finny and Gene can exist together. Towards the end of the book, after Finny&#x27;s death, Gene notes that he feels Finny&#x27;s funeral is his own, as so much of his identity rests upon Finny.

=== Athletics and blitzball ===
Athletics comprise a key part of Finny&#x27;s personality. He views them as an expression of achievement and believes there are no winners or losers. That is epitomized by Finny&#x27;s breaking of the school swimming record, which he does not feel the need to publicise, and Blitzball, a game that Finny spontaneously invents that has no winners or losers, which Finny excels at as it requires pure athleticism rather than focusing on defeat of opponents.

=== Summer and Winter Sessions ===
The Summer Session at Devon School is defined by freedom, lack of rules and little academic study. This symbolises innocence and youth, which is &quot;lost&quot; when Finny falls from the tree, giving lead to the Winter Session. The Winter Session is defined as the polar opposite of the Summer Session: tight rules, rigorous study, little freedom and a cold and unforgiving atmosphere. The Sessions represent the shift from carefree youth to adulthood and maturity, which occurs throughout the novel.

=== Finny&#x27;s fall ===
Finny&#x27;s fall from the tree marks the climax of the novel. It is both a literal and a symbolic fall. The literal fall has a knock-on effect of no sports for Finny, which leads to a loss of independence and identity. The symbolic fall represents a fall from innocence and from youth, and the beginning of the end of Finny and Gene&#x27;s friendship. The fall can be interpreted as having biblical allusions; like Adam and Eve, Finny and Gene existed in a carefree, idyllic setting, epitomized by innocence (like Eden), which is tainted by a force of darkness (the snake or Gene&#x27;s growing resentment) and then is shattered by a fall from innocence (the fall from the tree).

=== Implied homoerotic undertones ===
Various parties have asserted that the novel implies homoeroticism between Gene and Finny, including those who endorse a queer reading of the novel and those who condemn homosexuality as immoral. For example, the book was challenged in the Vernon-Verona-Sherill, NY School District (1980) as a &quot;filthy, trashy sex novel&quot; despite having no substantial female characters and describing no sexual activity.

Though frequently taught in US high schools, curricula related to &quot;A Separate Peace&quot; typically ignore a possible homoerotic reading in favor of engaging with the book as a historical novel or coming-of-age story. Knowles denied any such intentions, stating in a 1987 newspaper interview:Freud said any strong relationship between two men contains a homoerotic element... If so, in this case, both characters are totally unaware of it. It would have changed everything, it wouldn&#x27;t have been the same story. In that time and place, my characters would have behaved totally differently... If there had been homoeroticism between Phineas and Gene, I would have put it in the book, I assure you. It simply wasn&#x27;t there.

== Adaptations ==

The novel has been adapted into two films of the same name. The first, starring Parker Stevenson as Gene and John Heyl as Finny, with a screenplay by Fred Segal and John Knowles, was released in 1972. The second, directed by Peter Yates, with a screenplay by Wendy Kesselman, was released in 2004.

<text>Change of Habit is a 1969 American crime drama musical film directed by William A. Graham, and starring Elvis Presley and Mary Tyler Moore. Written by James Lee, S.S. Schweitzer, and Eric Bercovici, based on a story by John Joseph and Richard Morris, the film is about three Catholic nuns, preparing for their final vows, who are sent to a rough inner city neighborhood dressed as lay missionaries to work at a clinic run by a young doctor. Their lives become complicated by the realities they face in the inner city, and by the doctor who falls in love with one of the nuns.

The film was produced by Joe Connelly for NBC Productions and distributed by Universal Pictures. Filmed on location in the Los Angeles area and at Universal Studios during March and April 1969, &quot;Change of Habit&quot; was released in the United States on November 10, 1969. It spent four weeks on the &quot;Variety&quot; Box Office Survey and peaked at #17 among the year&#x27;s highest grossing films.

&quot;Change of Habit&quot; was Elvis Presley&#x27;s 31st and final film acting role and stars as a professional man for the only time in his career. There was interest in this film being a major Oscar contender, but Elvis manager Colonel Tom Parker knew the Academy&#x27;s bias against Elvis ensured it was not considered. He famously said &quot;Don&#x27;t go buying no tuxedoes.&quot;

Change of Habit is considered to be among Elvis&#x27; best films and it has been praised for how it dealt with inner city problems in ways that had never been seen in a Hollywood film. This film was also important in Hollywood history because it was the first film to deal with autism.

Elvis&#x27; remaining film appearances were in concert documentaries, which were very successful, although he turned down the leading role in &quot;A Star is Born&quot; and was working on the karate film, &quot;The New Gladiators (film)&quot; at the time of his death. Elvis regretted turning down A Star is Born but Change of Habit is said to be the best final film of any singer-turned-actor

This film was Mary Tyler Moore&#x27;s fourth and final film under her Universal Pictures contract; she did not appear in another theatrical movie until &quot;Ordinary People&quot; in 1980. Moore and Edward Asner, who also appears in the film playing a police officer, went on to star in &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, which premiered in September of the following year. In this film, however, Moore and Asner shared no scenes together.

==Plot==
Dr. John Carpenter is a physician in a ghetto clinic who falls for a co-worker, Michelle Gallagher, unaware that she is a nun.

Dr. Carpenter heads a clinic serving an underprivileged community in a major metropolis with an ethnic Puerto Rican population. He is surprised to be offered assistance by three women. Unknown to him, the three are nuns in street clothing who want to aid the community but are afraid the local residents might be reluctant to seek help if their true identities were known. The nuns are also facing opposition from the rude and arrogant priest from the local parish. Dr. Carpenter and the nuns are shown dealing with a non-verbal autistic girl named Amanda, a boy with a severe speech impediment, and a man beaten by loan shark enforcers. The nuns at times are sexually harassed by loiterers as well as an attempted rape scene.

Carpenter falls for Sister Michelle Gallagher, played by wholesome Mary Tyler Moore, but Sister Michelle&#x27;s true vocation remains unknown to Dr. Carpenter. She also has feelings for the doctor but is reluctant to leave the order. The film concludes with Sister Michelle and Sister Irene entering a church where Dr. Carpenter is singing to pray for guidance to make her choice.

==Notable plot points==

===Autism===
In the film, the character of Amanda, a young autistic child, is believed to be the first portrayal of autism in a film by name. It accurately portrays the common misdiagnosis of deafness and once Amanda&#x27;s autism is defined, she is treated with a therapy that was then quite common: Rage Reduction therapy, also known as Attachment therapy. This treatment has since fallen out of favor, now considered pseudoscientific. Indeed, the scene was supervised by Robert Zaslow, known as the father of rage reduction therapy. Zaslow is credited as an additional member of the film&#x27;s crew as &quot;(supervisor: rage reduction scene - as Dr. Robert W. Zaslow)&quot;

===Folk music at Mass===
In an era when Folk Mass was just catching on, Elvis&#x27; character is seen playing guitar and singing &quot;Let Us Pray&quot; in an early depiction of folk music at Mass.

==Production==
By 1969, Presley&#x27;s future in Hollywood was under threat. Although still financially successful, mainly due to the &quot;make &#x27;em quick, make &#x27;em cheap&quot; attitude of Presley&#x27;s manager Colonel Tom Parker, Presley&#x27;s films had been making less profit in recent years. When Parker had struggled to find any studio willing to pay Presley&#x27;s usual $1 million fee, he struck a deal with NBC to produce one feature film, and a TV special entitled &quot;Elvis&quot;. NBC would pay Presley $1.25 million for both features, and Parker was happy in the knowledge that he was still able to earn $1 million for his client.

The film &quot;Change of Habit&quot; had been announced in 1967, with Mary Tyler Moore signing up in October 1968. It was considered a Moore vehicle until January 1969 when Presley signed on to take the lead role.

Although set in New York City, the film was shot in the Los Angeles area and at the Universal Studios lot during March and April 1969. It was released nationwide in the United States on November 10, 1969.

Mary Tyler Moore and Edward Asner would soon become co-stars of her self-named &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, one of television&#x27;s enduring hits from 1970 to 77. In &quot;Change of Habit&quot;, however, they shared no scenes.

In 1973, four years after &quot;Change of Habit&quot;, the issue of mass with guitar and off duty nuns without habits would again be brought up in &quot;All In The Family&quot; episode &quot;Edith&#x27;s Conversion.&quot;

As of October 2024, Jane Elliot, who played Sister Barbara, is the last surviving main cast member still living.

By the time Change of Habit was on release, Elvis was experiencing one of the greatest years of any singer-turned-actor in music and film history. Between December 1968 and December 1969 Elvis starred in three hit films at the box office, he starred in the top rated television special of the year &quot;Elvis: The 1968 Comeback Special&quot;, he scored three top-ten singles including the number one &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot; and &quot;In the Ghetto&quot;, had three hit albums including the legendary &quot;From Elvis in Memphis&quot; and became the number one live act in Las Vegas. In 1969 alone Elvis made more than $7,000,000 from films, records, television and personal appearances, which equates to over $59,000,000 adjusted for inflation.

After Change of Habit, Elvis next wrote and produced his own film, &quot;New Gladiators&quot;, which was unfinished at the time of his death. This dream project would have featured Elvis starring as a karate cop in a role that showed off his skills as a martial artist. He was also asked by &quot;Barbra Streisand&quot; to star in her remake of &quot;A Star is Born&quot; but the Colonel wanted to ensure Elvis got top billing and a million dollar salary before agreeing. No agreement happened.

==Reception==
A. H. Weiler of &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewed the film on a double bill with &quot;House of Cards&quot; and noted that both were &quot;merely exemplary of professional technique and dialogue rather than memorable characterization and emotion.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that &quot;its intriguing idea has a well-enough-constructed plotline to flesh out its premise for good family fare ... Presley displays his customary easy presence.&quot; Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Today we&#x27;re simply too much aware how agonizing social injustices can be for them to be treated with the breezy, jaunty touch of simple-minded light comedy ... to watch all this frantically bouncy, thoroughly bogus business is as discomforting as listening to chalk screech across a blackboard.&quot;

&quot;Change of Habit&quot; holds a 10% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on ten reviews, making it Presley&#x27;s worst-received film on the site.

==Soundtrack==
When Presley entered Decca Universal Studio on March 5, 1969, for two days to record his final dramatic motion picture soundtrack, what would come to be known as the comeback television special had already been broadcast, its attendant album had been his first top ten LP in four years, and he had just finished the sessions at American Sound Studio yielding &quot;From Elvis in Memphis&quot; and the top ten singles &quot;In the Ghetto&quot; and &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot; that would cement his resurgence as a force in American popular music. He had a month-long engagement at the International Hotel in Paradise, Nevada lined up in August, his first live performances in eight years, and clearly now had turned his career around.

A song recorded at American, &quot;Rubberneckin&#x27;&quot;, would be used in the film and subsequently issued as the b-side of RCA single 47-9768 &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry Daddy&quot; in conjunction with the movie premiere. Four songs would be recorded at the soundtrack sessions, of which &quot;Let&#x27;s Be Friends&quot; would not be used in the film. The four songs would be released commercially on budget albums, &quot;Let&#x27;s Be Friends&quot;, the title track &quot;Change of Habit&quot;, and &quot;Have A Happy&quot; on &quot;Let&#x27;s Be Friends&quot; the following year, with &quot;Let Us Pray&quot; issued on the 1971 album &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot;.

Some reference sources erroneously list an outtake from the earlier Presley film, &quot;Charro!&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Forget About the Stars&quot; (a song also released on the &quot;Let&#x27;s Be Friends&quot; album), as being a song recorded for &quot;Change of Habit&quot;.

<text>In distributed computing, code on demand is any technology that sends executable software code from a server computer to a client computer upon request from the client&#x27;s software. Some well-known examples of the code on demand paradigm on the web are Java applets, Adobe&#x27;s ActionScript language for the Flash Player, and JavaScript.

The program code lies inactive on a web server until a user (client) requests a web page that contains a link to the code using the client&#x27;s web browser. Upon this request, the web page and the program are transported to the user&#x27;s machine using HTTP. When the page is displayed, the code is started in the browser and executes locally, inside the user&#x27;s computer until it is stopped (e.g., by the user leaving the web page).

Code on demand is a specific use of mobile code, within the field of code mobility.

== Constraints ==
=== Client-server ===
The first constraint is that the system must be made up of clients and servers.

Servers have resources that clients want to use. For example, a server has a list of stock prices (i.e. a resource) and the client would like to display these prices in some nice graphs.

There is a clear separation of concerns between the two. The server takes care of the back-end stuff (data storage, business rules, etc.) and the client handles the front-end stuff (user interfaces).

=== Stateless ===
To further simplify interactions between clients and servers, the second constraint is that the communication between them must be stateless.

This means that all information about the client’s session is kept on the client, and the server is completely unaware. The consequence is that each request must contain all information necessary to perform the request (i.e. it cannot rely on any context information).

=== Cache ===
The last constraint on the client-server communication is that responses from servers must be marked as cacheable or non-cacheable.

An effective cache can reduce the number of client-server interactions, which contributes positively to the performance of the system. At least, from a user’s point of view.

=== Code on demand ===
Code on demand (COD) is the only optional constraint in REST. It allows clients to improve their flexibility because it is the server which decides how certain things will be done. For instance, with code on demand, a client can download a Javascript, Java applet or even a Flash application in order to encrypt communication so servers are not aware of any encryption routines / keys used in this process.

However, using COD reduces visibility, hence the optionality. Also, not every API needs this kind of flexibility.

<doc id="661731" wikidata="Q6530166" url="?curid=661731" title="Les insolences du Frère Untel">
<text>Les insolences du Frère Untel is a book first published in Montreal by &quot;Les Éditions de l&#x27;Homme&quot; in 1960. In a very short time it sold more than 100,000 copies, in a society where a book with a 10,000 copy print run was considered a best seller. The anonymous author was Jean-Paul Desbiens, a Marist Brother, who attacked the church-controlled education system in Quebec.

The book had an important impact on the Quiet Revolution in Quebec and on the educational reforms that eventually shaped the present Quebec education system.

Desbiens was scathing in his attack of the existing system of classical colleges, where Latin reigned supreme. He also criticized the poor quality of the French language in Quebec, which he called &quot;joual&quot;. He called for massive reforms in all aspects of the system. Later, he was also very critical of the way the reforms were carried out.

The book was translated as The Impertinences of Brother Anonymous and published by the Montreal-based publisher Harvest House in 1962.

There is a more recent French edition which is still kept in print by les Editions de l&#x27;homme and dated 1988. ()

<text>Richard Diamond, Private Detective is an American detective drama, created by Blake Edwards, which aired on radio from 1949 to 1953, and on television from 1957 to 1960.

==Radio==
Dick Powell starred in the &quot;Richard Diamond, Private Detective&quot; radio series as a wisecracking former police officer turned private detective. Episodes typically open with a client visiting or calling cash-strapped Diamond&#x27;s office and agreeing to his fee of $100 a day plus expenses, or Diamond taking on a case at the behest of his friend and former partner, Lt. Walter Levinson. Diamond often suffers a blow to the head in his sleuthing pursuits. Most episodes end with Diamond at the piano, singing a standard, popular song, or showtune from Powell&#x27;s repertoire to Helen Asher (his girlfriend) in her penthouse at 975 Park Avenue.

Levinson was played variously by Ed Begley, Arthur Q. Bryan, Ted DeCorsia and Alan Reed. Helen was played by Virginia Gregg and others. Another regular cast member was Wilms Herbert as Walt&#x27;s bumbling sergeant, Otis, who also &quot;doubled&quot; on the show as Helen&#x27;s butler, Francis.

Many of the shows were either written or directed by Edwards. Its theme, &quot;Leave It to Love&quot;, was whistled by Powell at the beginning of each episode.

It began airing on NBC Radio on April 24, 1949, picked up Rexall as a sponsor on April 5, 1950, and continued until December 6, 1950. With Camel cigarettes as a sponsor, it moved to ABC from January 5, 1951, to June 29, 1951, with Rexall returning for a run from October 5, 1951, until June 27, 1952. Substituting for &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot;, it aired Sunday evenings on CBS (again, for Rexall) from May 31, 1953 until September 20, 1953.

==Television series==

General Foods bought the program from Powell as a summer replacement for &quot;December Bride&quot; in 1957.

The television debut of Richard Diamond occurred on November 22, 1956, when Don Taylor portrayed the character in the &quot;Double Cross&quot; episode on &quot;Chevron Hall of Stars&quot;.

Powell&#x27;s company, Four Star Television, produced the television version of &quot;Richard Diamond, Private Detective&quot;, which premiered in the summer of 1957 on CBS. It returned to CBS in January 1958 for the second season and in February 1959 for the third season, again on CBS. In the fall of 1959, the fourth and final season aired on NBC. 

David Janssen, before &quot;The Fugitive,&quot; starred as Diamond, a former officer of the New York Police Department and a hard-boiled private detective in the film noir tradition. Don Taylor played the title role in a 1956 television pilot, broadcast as an episode of the anthology series &quot;Chevron Hall of Stars&quot;. The first two television seasons followed radio&#x27;s characterization the most closely (several episodes were adapted from the radio series). Diamond, known for his charm and wisecracks as much as his virility, was still based in New York, though Janssen never sat at a piano and sang, as Powell had typically ended most of the radio episodes. In the &quot;noirish&quot; opening sequence, clad in hat, suit, and tie, he walks down a dimly lit street toward the camera and lights up a cigarette, the light revealing his face. After the first season when the sponsor was Maxwell House, the show was sponsored by Kent cigarettes, and Frank DeVol’s playfully mysterious theme was heard underneath an announcer hawking either &quot;Maxwell House – Good to the Last Drop&quot; or “Kent with the Micronite filter.” In syndicated rebroadcasts of the series, the revised title, &quot;Call Mr. D.&quot;, flashes on the screen, and DeVol&#x27;s music is replaced by Pete Rugolo’s far more recognizable theme—although that did not appear until Season 3. 

Following the second season, the setting was switched from New York City to Los Angeles, and the production was entirely redesigned. The 18 episodes comprising Season 3 aired from February to mid-June of 1959, and Diamond’s character now bore only slight resemblance to his California-based &quot;noirish&quot; predecessors Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe. By the late 1950s, the glamour of Hollywood was becoming an irresistible fantasy for millions of viewers, and the popularity of Warner Brothers’ &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;—which involved a good deal of location shooting and began airing four months before Diamond&#x27;s third season—undoubtedly influenced a newer P. I. image that often seemed more inspired by Hugh Hefner than by Dashiell Hammett. Diamond no longer occupied a low-rent, cloistered office, but now operated from a modern, beautifully appointed ranch house—complete with a swimming pool—in the Hollywood Hills. With panoramic sliding glass doors providing views of the mountains and the city, his sunken living room featured a bar and a loveseat, where he could be found many evenings entertaining young women before a fire. Following the lead of the &quot;Sunset Strip&quot; private eyes, he also drove a convertible—in this case a 1959 DeSoto Fireflite. The Hefner-like fantasy was enhanced by gadgets, especially Diamond&#x27;s car phone, which connected him directly to an answering service overseen by the shapely, enigmatic “Sam.” Season 3&#x27;s modern, more youthful ambience was complemented by a jazz score by composer/arranger Pete Rugolo, who created a set of big-band, Stan Kenton-esque cues for each of the episodes. In the highly stylized opening sequence, Rugolo&#x27;s robust theme is preceded by tense melodic fragments underscoring a series of frenetic, silhouette images of Diamond running, before walking forward—again in hat, suit, and tie—to light a cigarette, suggesting a re-boot of the original &quot;noirish&quot; conception. (Rugolo&#x27;s score soon became so popular that in 1959 a full album of his &quot;Diamond&quot; cues, &quot;The Music from Richard Diamond&quot;, was released on the Mercury label.) 

In the fourth season, which aired on NBC, the writers retained Los Angeles as the setting, but the Hefner-esque fantasy elements were considerably toned down. Now Diamond again operated from an office reminiscent of what he had known in New York, and his beautiful ranch house was replaced by an attractive—though more conventional—apartment. His car phone still connected him to Sam, but he now drove a 1959 Ford Galaxie convertible—absent the impressive tail fins of his DeSoto. Though the opening titles remained, Rugolo&#x27;s score was replaced by a more sedate theme, &quot;Nervous&quot; by Richard Shores, later to be used during the highlight sequence that began every episode of &quot;The Dick Powell Show&quot;. The CBS Season 3 re-boot had aired on Sunday nights at 10 pm, but NBC moved the time slot to 7:30 pm Monday, and Season 4 began airing on October 5, 1959, with a 17-episode run that concluded late in January. Because its numbers were no longer strong, the season&#x27;s nine additional episodes were delayed, resuming only as a summer replacement on Tuesday, July 5, 1960, and concluding in early September. Though the old &quot;noirish&quot; elements were more prominent, the final season&#x27;s look seems inspired more by cost-cutting than aesthetics, and the production values appear far less glamorous than Season 3. 

In addition to Janssen, the series had other recurring characters. Mirroring Diamond&#x27;s history with the New York Police Department, the radio version featured his friend, police Lt. Walt Levinson (often played by Ed Begley, Sr.), and on TV, veteran actor Regis Toomey, portraying Diamond&#x27;s former superior, Lt. Dennis &quot;Mac&quot; McGough, came aboard in the first episode, which aired in July 1957. Toomey then appeared intermittently in seven more, including “Snow Queen,” the final episode of Season 2, which aired on June 26, 1958. Radio&#x27;s version also gave Diamond a steady girl friend, wealthy socialite Helen Asher (played by Virginia Gregg), a story arc that was neglected by television until the first episode of Season 3, when Diamond meets fashion designer Karen Wells, played by Barbara Bain. But this may have created a conundrum for the producers, since radio&#x27;s Diamond was also an unrestrained flirt, and Powell&#x27;s character often shamelessly ogled his beautiful clients before returning to Helen each week. In one TV episode, “Soft Touch,” Karen catches Diamond about to two-time her, and after five episodes, the “steady-girl-friend” arc had disappeared, with Diamond once again playing the field. When he first reached Los Angeles, Diamond had no history with the local police, and his encounters with them are often contentious. In Season 4, Russ Conway was cast as Lieutenant Pete Kile for five episodes, and their relationship soon turns to one of mutual respect, if not always warmth. The omnipresent Sam entered the picture (at least partially—viewers never saw much of her face) in Season 3 and remained for the duration of the series. She was played for most of Season 3 by Mary Tyler Moore in her first regular series role, and later replaced by Roxane Brooks.

<doc id="661735" wikidata="Q2936318" url="?curid=661735" title="Candy Crowley">
<text>Candy Alt Crowley (born December 26, 1948) is an American news anchor who was employed as CNN&#x27;s chief political correspondent, specializing in American national and state elections. She was based in CNN&#x27;s Washington, D.C. bureau and was the anchor of its Sunday morning talk show &quot;State of the Union with Candy Crowley&quot;. She has covered elections for over two decades.

==Early life and education==
Crowley was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan, where her family had moved briefly from St. Louis, Missouri. Her family moved back to St. Louis when she was a toddler and she grew up in the St. Louis County suburb of Creve Coeur, Missouri. She attended kindergarten through high school at The Principia School, a private school for children of Christian Scientists in St. Louis County, where she graduated in 1966. After high school she attended Randolph-Macon Woman&#x27;s College in Lynchburg, Virginia, where she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English.

==Career==
Crowley started her career as a newsroom assistant with the Washington, D.C.–based radio station WASH-FM. She was an anchor for Mutual Broadcasting and the White House correspondent for the Associated Press. She moved from NBC to CNN in 1987. She hosted &quot;Inside Politics&quot; in place of Judy Woodruff before the show was replaced with &quot;The Situation Room&quot;. In February 2010, Crowley succeeded John King as an anchor of the Sunday morning political talk show &quot;State of the Union&quot;.

Crowley has been characterized by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; as a &quot;straight shooter&quot;, her career as &quot;sophisticated political observation, graceful writing, and determined fairness,&quot; and her style as &quot;no-nonsense&quot;. The &quot;L.A. Times&quot; article says that because of this criticism of her reporting is equally distributed between the Democratic and Republican parties.

Crowley has won several awards, including the Broadcasters&#x27; Award from the Associated Press, the 2003 and 1998 Dirksen Awards from the National Press Foundation, the 1997 and 2005 Joan Shorenstein Barone Award, a 2003 Emmy Award for her work on CNN Presents Enemy Within, the 2004 Gracie Allen Award for her war coverage, a National Headliner and a Cine award, the 2005 Edward R. Murrow Award, and the 2012 William Allen White Foundation National Citation from the school of journalism at the University of Kansas for her expertise on &quot;politics, politicians, and the events that have changed the world.&quot;

Crowley served as the moderator October 16, 2012, for the second presidential election debate between President Barack Obama and his Republican opponent Mitt Romney. She received criticism for her contradicting Romney and seemingly confirming Obama&#x27;s statement during an exchange with Romney over the language the President used regarding the attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi. CNN noted that &quot;conservative critics have launched an attack Crowley&quot;...but &quot;Crowley was right.&quot; Crowley later stated that Romney &quot;was right in the main, I just think that he picked the wrong word.&quot;
On March 17, 2013, following their CNN report on the guilty verdict of two Steubenville high school football players for the rape of an unconscious sixteen-year-old, Crowley and fellow journalist Poppy Harlow were criticized for giving too much coverage to how the verdict would affect the defendants&#x27; lives.

CNN announced on December 5, 2014, Crowley&#x27;s decision to leave the network after 27 years. CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker said Crowley &quot;has made the decision to move on, so she can embark on the next chapter of her already prolific career. As difficult as it is for us to imagine CNN without Candy, we know that she comes to this decision thoughtfully, and she has our full support.&quot; Her last broadcast was on &quot;State of the Union&quot; on December 21, 2014.
On August 17, 2015, Politico reported that CNN correspondent Dana Bash would replace Crowley as chief political correspondent.

In fall 2015, Crowley became a fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics. She has retired from daily work and is serving as a paid guest speaker.

==Personal life==
Crowley is a vegetarian and practices Transcendental Meditation. She is divorced, and has two children, two stepchildren and four grandchildren. Her elder child is a neurosurgeon and her younger son a musician.

<text>The Social Christian Reformist Party (, PRSC) is a Christian democratic right-wing political party in the Dominican Republic. It was established on July 24, 1984, by the union of Joaquín Balaguer&#x27;s &quot;Partido Reformista&quot; and the &quot;Partido Revolucionario Social Cristiano&quot;. Some of the PRSC&#x27;s founders and leaders were originally business leaders and Roman Catholics who opposed the communist, socialist, and social democratic tendencies of Juan Bosch, the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) and the Dominican Liberation Party (PLD).

The PRSC is strongly associated with Balaguer, who was the presidential candidate of the PRSC and its predecessor party in all but one election between 1966 and 2000. The party was often in power during this period, but declined rapidly following Balaguer&#x27;s death in 2002. After the mid-2000s the party was relegated to being a junior partner of the PRD or PLD, and ceased running a presidential candidate in 2012.

The PRSC was in an alliance with the People&#x27;s Force party in the 2020 presidential elections, and won six seats in the senate and six in the chamber of deputies.

==Background and formation==

Long-time politician Joaquín Balaguer was the last figurehead president of Rafael Trujillo&#x27;s dictatorship (1930–1961) in the Dominican Republic. Following Trujillo&#x27;s assassination, Balaguer struggled to enact reforms and repair international relations while preventing the country from sliding into civil war between the communists and the &quot;trujillistas&quot;. Balaguer headed an internationally recognized caretaker Council of State in 1962 but resigned when the military opened fire upon demonstrators. A military coup d&#x27;état followed and Balaguer went into exile.

Juan Bosch became the first freely elected president in 1962, but was overthrown several months later in a military coup, and by 1965 the country fell into civil war. Balaguer created the Reformist Party () and returned with the backing of the United States (which occupied the country) for the 1966 general election.

The Reformist Party&#x27;s ideology and doctrine was largely undefined, following Balaguer&#x27;s orders. Balaguer campaigned as a moderate conservative, advocating gradual reforms. The party remained in power through three presidential terms (1966–1978) known domestically as &quot;The Twelve Years&quot;.

After falling from power in the 1978 elections, Balaguer sought to integrate christian democratic theory into the party, and consulted with the Venezuelan Social Christian Party. In 1985, the Reformists merged with the Social Christian Revolutionary Party (&quot;Partido Revolucionario Social Cristiano&quot;, PRSC), which had lost official party eligibility due to poor performance in the 1978 elections. The PRSC had been founded in 1962 by a group of exiles that included Alfonso Moreno Martinez, Mario Read Vittini, and Caonabo Javier Castillo.

==History and policies==

The new party was named the Social Christian Reformist Party (&quot;Partido Reformista Social Cristiano&quot;, also PRSC). It was dominated by Balaguer&#x27;s personality and lacked a coherent strategy or philosophy other than his conservative tendencies.

The party won the presidency and both houses of Congress in 1986, and more modest victories in 1990 and 1994.

The PRSC declined rapidly following Balaguer&#x27;s death in 2002. After the mid-2000s the party was relegated to being a junior partner of the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) or the Dominican Liberation Party (PLD).

The party formed an alliance with the Modern Revolutionary Party, the Grand National Alliance and others for the 2006 elections, taking a distant third place. The party supported the Dominican Municipal League candidate in the 2008 presidential election, who came in a distant third place with less than 5% of the votes.

In the 2010 legislative elections, the party had a partial alliance with the PLD in almost all provinces and won 4 senators (3 within the alliance) and 8 deputies (5 within the alliance). The PRSC supported the PLD candidate in the 2012 presidential elections, which was the first time the party did not run its own candidate.

The party allied with the People&#x27;s Force party in the 2020 elections.

The PRSC has attempted to reorganize itself with internal party discipline, reforming its management bodies, recruiting younger people, and attempting to expand its direct enrolment. They have had strong internal struggles, but they have proven to be an organization that achieves consensus, integration and the unity of the members who follow internal party discipline.

==List of party presidents==

# Quique Antún (2005–2009, 2014–present)
# Carlos Morales Troncoso (2009–2014)

<doc id="661747" wikidata="Q3075531" url="?curid=661747" title="Sentimental Hygiene">
<text>Sentimental Hygiene is the sixth studio album by rock singer-songwriter Warren Zevon and his first &quot;sober&quot; one. The album was released on August 29, 1987, by Virgin Records. The release of &quot;Sentimental Hygiene&quot; marked the first studio album for Zevon in five years. It produced the single &quot;Reconsider Me&quot;, as well as the dance single &quot;Leave My Monkey Alone&quot;. The band on the album includes guitarist Peter Buck, bassist Mike Mills and drummer Bill Berry (all of R.E.M.), who also recorded an album of covers with Zevon (under the name “Hindu Love Gods”) at this time.

The single version of &quot;Leave My Monkey Alone&quot; was extended to 10:34 minutes and included a remix by the Latin Rascals (Albert Cabrera and Tony Moran) and the non-album track, &quot;Nocturne&quot;.

&quot;Even a Dog Can Shake Hands&quot; was used as the opening theme music for the short-lived Fox comedy series &quot;Action&quot;. The song was co-written by Buck, Berry and Mills. Michael Stipe, lead singer of R.E.M., appears on the song &quot;Bad Karma&quot;. The album also features contributions by Bob Dylan, playing harmonica on “The Factory”, and Neil Young playing lead guitar on “Sentimental Hygiene”.

The song &quot;Boom Boom Mancini&quot; was inspired by boxer Ray Mancini and his contest against Bobby Chacon.

<text>&quot;Legal Thrillers; where the courtroom is the arena.&quot; 
The legal thriller genre is a type of crime fiction genre that focuses on the proceedings of the investigation, with particular reference to the impacts on courtroom proceedings and the lives of characters.

The legal thriller genre&#x27;s courtroom proceedings and legal authorship are ubiquitous characteristics. The genre features lawyers as legal professionals as the supreme hero. Their actions in the courtroom affect the quality of character&#x27;s lives, as they determine innocence prevailing against injustice.

Many legal professionals such as judges and lawyers constitute the primary authorship of the genre, providing their own relevant experiences The legal authorship experience is certified through the novel, &quot;Presumed Innocent&quot; written by the lawyer and author, Scott Turow. American writers such as Harper Lee experienced her father&#x27;s dealings as a lawyer. As a lawyer, the author, John Grisham, also contributes to developing the legal thriller genre by notably casting light on the connections it draws between legal proceedings and crime displayed in novels .

Legal language is also another characteristic of the legal thriller in that it employs real life lawyer terminology, courtroom, and police procedures to convey their message across television, novel, and film mediums. The television shows &quot;Suits&quot; and &quot;How to Get Away with Murder&quot; embody the legal thriller, characterized by episodes based on scenarios of legal proceedings similar to actual court scenarios.

The earliest legal drama began with the 1955 premiere of the popular American television show, &quot;Perry Mason.&quot; Much like the storylines carried out in legal thrillers today, this series follows the career of a criminal defense lawyer by the name of Perry Mason who deals with clients that had been wrongfully accused of murder. While Mason works on his defense of the client who is accused, detective Arthur Tragg and prosecuter, Hamilton Burger work together to build a case against Mason&#x27;s client. During trial, Mason conducts his own investigation alongside the detective and prosecuter where he goes on to uncover illegal or morally incorrect behavior of those accusing the client. The show was central in introducing the theme of &quot;moral ambiguity&quot; that carried into the complex plot of various hit legal thrillers that followed. 

Following Perry Mason&#x27;s show, arrived another hit television show in the 1960s known as The Defenders. This show showcased a father and son lawyer duo who took on controversial cases including abortion, capital punishment, insanity defense, and more.When interviewed by &quot;The View Magazine&quot; regarding the themes covered by the show, screenwriter, Reginald Rose stated that &quot;We&#x27;re committed to controversy.&quot; When confronted with controversial cases, the protagonist would take a liberal stance in the courtroom, straying away from easy answers in the courtroom the way they were presented in the Perry Mason series. In their most controversial episode titled, &quot;The Benefactor,&quot; duo: Lawrence Preston and Kenneth Preston are seen to defend an abortionist, resulting in a case that worked in favor of legalized abortion. By depicting the courtroom as an arena for drama and challenging traditional endings, the show supported the development numerous dramas that covered the same material to follow.

=== Contemporary American Legal Thrillers ===
Australia, Denmark, and Poland import 62% of law and justice shows from the United States. Legal thriller television is mostly sourced from the American jurisdiction.

As American shows dominate the legal thriller genre, the characteristic of legal language has emerged. In the American legal drama &quot;Suits&quot;, the character Harvey mentions the term &quot;subpoena&quot; consistently. The legal language, commonly French and Latin expressions is central to courtroom proceedings in legal thriller television. Additional legal language used in the show includes terminology such as &quot;affidavit&quot;, &quot;plaintiff&quot;, &quot;defendant&quot;, &quot;malfeasance&quot;, and &quot;in lieu&quot;.

&quot;How To Get Away with Murder&quot; is an American television series categorized as a legal thriller. In the courtroom proceedings of Episode 1: Pilot, legal language such as the term &quot;mens rea&quot; is utilized. The television series features a legal professional as the leading teacher and a group of law students who devise tactics to combat various criminal cases and murder mysteries. There is a difficulty for characters to balance personal life and professional success as women, people of color and marginalized individuals in legal thriller television shows.Other legal thriller television in America also consisted of the show &quot;The Defenders&quot;. Social justice themes were prevalent within this show and police procedural elements in subsequent shows such as &quot;Arrest and Trial&quot;. The development of these television shows led to the creation of the most famous TV shows of the 1990s, &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;. Different categories of legal thriller shows also developed, such as courtroom drama, ensemble shows, and police detective dramas. The characters in these shows displayed ardent personality traits when investigating and dealing with complex legal issues of the justice system.

=== Global Legal Thrillers ===
Australian legal thriller shows developed in the 1980s and 1990s covered both adjudication and punishment. The television shows concerning adjudication and punishment consist of the soap opera, &quot;Carson&#x27;s Law&quot; and &quot;SeaChange&quot;. Both shows feature female lawyers who experience prejudice from males in their legal careers.

Thematic ideas of justice and equality are associated with the female lawyer protagonist&#x27;s fight for change to break the glass ceiling. The inequality of men and women prevalent in the set time of the 1920s contribute to these themes present.

==Books==

=== Earliest Authors and Novels ===

The earliest written version of legal thrillers in the form of plays and stories printed in the newspaper date back to the mid-1550s. One of the first authors to bring into existence the legal thriller as a genre in the 1850s was Wilkie Collins. Collins learned from another writer who took an interest in the genre known as Charles Dickens. Among the first books Collins produced included &quot;The Woman in White&quot; and &quot;The Moonstone&quot; which was among the first novels to display the storyline of a legal thriller by incorporating the testimonies of various characters to show the storyline of a detective investigating a crime, finding a suspect innocent, and generating a storyline of suspense. In the 20th Century, one of the most popular authors in legal fiction came to be Melville Davisson Post. His style of plots were notoriously fast-paced yet easy to follow as seen in his novel &quot;Corpus Delicti&quot; where he showcases a calm, collected, intelligent lawyer who advises his clients to go to extreme lengths to defend his case.

Between the 1930s-1940s, author and active lawyer, Elre Stanley Gardner, wrote a series of novels that carried out the same proceedings of a legal thrillers as those in previous novels. In 1933, he wrote &quot;The Case of the Velvet Claws&quot; starring fictional lawyer, Perry Mason, who embarks on a journey of investigating the case of a client who claims he is innocent only to discover who the real culprit is later on.

In 1958, author and former American judge, John D. Voelker wrote &quot;Anatomy of a Murder&quot;. The novel featured a lawyer named Paul Biegler who is in charge of defending a man accused of murdering someone for his wife. It became known for being one of the most realistic legal thrillers for its thorough investigation and use of evidence to find the truth and defend an unlikable character.

=== Narrative Components ===
The process of writing legal thrillers produces a distinct form of fiction that requires a degree of technicality that can convince its readers of its reality but not distract from its fictional nature. The three elements that make up legal thrillers include &quot;Trial in Courtroom Fiction&quot; and &quot;The Lawyer as a Hero.&quot; &quot;The Trial in Courtroom&quot; aspect establishes the courtroom as being the scene where the climax should take place. The format the scene carries out is consistent: the case will take its course; the lawyer will face an obstacle, and in the end, they come out victorious. This is to maintain the equilibrium objective that courtrooms strive for as opposed to the culpability of whodunit narratives. &quot;The Lawyer as a Hero&quot; storyline depicts the lawyer as a knowledgeable figure in his field in the legal and academic realm. He is then depicted as overcoming all obstacles toward making him a good lawyer and resulting victorious in the end.

<text>The Micronauts are comic books featuring a group of characters based on the Mego Micronauts toy line. The first title was published by American company Marvel Comics in 1979, with both original characters and characters based on the toys. Marvel published two &quot;Micronauts&quot; series, mostly written by Bill Mantlo, until 1986, well after the toy line was cancelled in 1980. In the 2000s, Image Comics and Devil&#x27;s Due Publishing each briefly published their own &quot;Micronauts&quot; series. Byron Preiss Visual Publications also published three paperback novels based on the Micronauts. In 2016, IDW Publishing published a new comic book series. A live-action film version of the Micronauts was in development by Hasbro Studios and Paramount in 2015. In May 2023, Marvel re-acquired the licensing rights to publish &quot;The Micronauts&quot;.

In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the Microverse of &quot;The Micronauts&quot; is adapted as the Quantum Realm.

==Publication history==
=== Marvel Comics (1979–1986) ===
The Micronauts began life as comic book characters thanks to a fortuitous accident on Christmas 1977. Marvel Comics writer Bill Mantlo&#x27;s son Adam opened a new present, a line of the Mego Corporation&#x27;s Micronauts action figures. Seeing the toys, Mantlo was instantly struck by inspiration to write their adventures. Convincing then Editor-in-chief Jim Shooter to get the comics license for these toys, Mantlo was hired to script their series. The Micronauts were integrated into the wider Marvel Universe and often met heroes and villains from other Marvel properties.

The first series of the &quot;Micronauts&quot; ran from January 1979 to August 1984 and included 59 issues and two Annuals. The series was written by Bill Mantlo and featured art by Michael Golden. Other artists on the series included Howard Chaykin, Steve Ditko, Rich Buckler, Pat Broderick, Val Mayerik, Keith Giffen, Greg LaRocque, Gil Kane, Luke McDonnell, Mike Vosburg, Butch Guice, and Kelley Jones. &quot;Micronauts&quot;, along with &quot;Moon Knight&quot; and &quot;Ka-Zar the Savage&quot;, became one of Marvel&#x27;s first ongoing series to be distributed exclusively to comic book stores beginning with issue #38 (Feb. 1982).

In the United Kingdom, &quot;The Micronauts&quot; was first included as a supporting strip in Marvel UK&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars Weekly&quot; comic in January 1979 for several months and then in the first nine issues of &quot;Star Heroes Pocketbook&quot;, alongside &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, before joining the new &quot;Future Tense&quot; reprint anthology. Unlike the U.S. version, these strips were printed in black and white.

The &quot;Micronauts Special Edition&quot; five-issue limited series (December 1983-April 1984) reprinted issues #1–12 and a back-up feature from #25. The &quot;X-Men and the Micronauts&quot; four-issue limited series (January 1984–April 1984) was co-written by Mantlo and Chris Claremont and drawn by Butch Guice.

The second volume of &quot;Micronauts&quot;, subtitled &quot;The New Voyages&quot;, was published from October 1984 to May 1986 and ran 20 issues. The series was written by Peter B. Gillis and featured early-career artwork by Kelley Jones. After this series the Marvel-owned license lapsed.

From the late 1990s the characters Marionette, Arcturus Rann and Bug (all Marvel properties) have appeared in various Marvel titles (without referencing the &quot;Micronauts&quot; label). Bug has appeared in a solo one-shot and together with cosmic hero Star-Lord, as part of a new incarnation of the Guardians of the Galaxy.

===Image Comics===
In June 2002, a new series by Image Comics was published for eleven issues before its cancellation in September 2003. The same year saw a four-issue limited series featuring Baron Karza&#x27;s origin and his relationship with the Time Traveler entity.

===Devil&#x27;s Due Publishing===
In March 2004, a new series was launched by Devil&#x27;s Due Publishing, mixing new characters with those based on the toy line. The series ran for three issues and featured art by former &quot;Micronauts&quot; artist Pat Broderick. More issues were solicited, but never appeared on shelves despite some cover art being released.

===IDW Publishing===
In 2015, IDW Publishing acquired publishing rights from Hasbro to produce new comic books for the Micronauts and Rom the Space Knight, both formerly popularized by Marvel as licensed properties. IDW released the first issue of their Micronauts series in April 2016, with scripts by Cullen Bunn and art by David Baldeon. The comic ran for eleven issues from 2016 to 2017. It was followed by two five-issue miniseries &quot;Micronauts: Wrath of Karza&quot; and &quot;Rom &amp; the Micronauts&quot; which were released between 2017 and 2018.

IDW also featured Micronauts prominently in their crossover epic - &quot;Revolution&quot;. Released from September to November 2016, the crossover featured characters from various licensed toy lines IDW held the right to such as Transformers and GI Joe. The main line featured a preview issue and five regular issues, plus eight one shot tie-in issues across the various lines, one of which was &quot;Micronauts: Revolution&quot;.

===Marvel Comics (2023–present)===

In May 2023, Marvel renewed their license with Hasbro. In May 2024, a Marvel Omnibus was released that collected the original &quot;Micronauts&quot; series.

==Fictional team history==
===Marvel Comics version===
The Micronauts originate in the Microverse, a microscopic universe full of strange planets like the human-inhabited Homeworld which is made up of diverse spherical habitats that are linked together in the fashion of a molecular chain. The original team comes together in response to the threat posed by Baron Karza, former bearded and balding academic turned murderous immortal black-armored dictator, who gained control of Homeworld through the creation of the Body Banks, where life-extending brain transplants are performed on the rich and inhuman genetic alterations on the poor.

Commander Arcturus Rann returned from a thousand-year deep space voyage in suspended animation with Biotron, his robot co-pilot on the &quot;HMS&quot; (Homeworld Micro Ship) &quot;Endeavor&quot;, to discover Karza has slain the royal family, descendants of Rann&#x27;s parents Dallan and Sepsis who are now worshiped as virtual gods. What follows is an epic war across the Microverse pitting Rann and his allies against Karza.

In addition to Biotron, Rann&#x27;s team of &quot;Micronauts&quot; includes Princess Mari of Homeworld, who, with her brother Prince Argon, are the only survivors of the slaughtered royal family of Homeworld. Known to the team as Marionette, she falls in love with Rann and leads the team on occasion. The alien gladiators Acroyear and Bug also join Rann&#x27;s cause, and although completely different - one a noble armor-clad warrior prince and the other a wisecracking insectoid thief - the two become best friends and staunch allies of all Micronauts. The last member of the original team is Microtron, Mari&#x27;s robot tutor. Although small, Microtron is a resourceful R2-D2-style character and very supportive of all team members.

Warping through the Spacewall, an energy barrier between the Microverse and our much larger universe, and becoming trapped for a time on Earth where they enlarge to the size of action figures, the team encounter the to-them giant-sized Florida teenager Steve Coffin, his ex-astronaut father Ray (who is briefly transformed into the first Captain Universe), the Man-Thing and the evil cyborg scientist Professor Prometheus before returning to the Microverse.

After a series of battles against Karza (who, among his many other powers, can turn into a centaur and fire his fists like rockets) and his genetically-engineered army of vicious and obedient Dog Soldiers, the Micronauts triumph and Karza is apparently killed. Rann is able to claim victory due to the possession of the Enigma Force - a semi-sentient power source that bonded with him during his period of suspended animation and appeared in the form of floating, glowing green entities known as the Time Travelers - which enables him to perform incredible feats. The team then encounters the superhero team the Fantastic Four, who have traveled to a different region of the Microverse to battle the villain Psycho-Man. Bug&#x27;s love, Jasmine, is killed during the climax of the battle. It is shortly after this encounter that the Micronauts again become trapped on Earth, at a greatly reduced size.

After encounters with the villains Plantman and Molecule Man, the team battle Mentallo and the Fixer, who have allied themselves with the organization HYDRA. Joined by one of Acroyear&#x27;s people - Dagon - the team discovers that the villains and HYDRA are secretly under the control of Baron Karza, who is able to resurrect himself by placing his mind in Prince Argon&#x27;s body. Argon was also converted to a cyborg centaur by the Body Banks, which combined him with his horse Oberon. Although the organization S.H.I.E.L.D. and several representatives of the races of the Microverse help the Micronauts finally defeat Karza, the battle is costly. Biotron is destroyed by Dagon, who is revealed to be an agent of Karza; the Queen of Kaliklak, Bug&#x27;s home planet, dies in battle; Rann is rendered comatose and Acroyear&#x27;s traitorous albino brother Prince Shaitan dies summoning the Worldmind - the parallel power to the Enigma Force that sustains their own home planet of Spartak. In desperation, Acroyear bonds with the Worldmind to defeat Karza, but in doing so destroys his world.

While trying to awaken Rann, the remnants of the team have an encounter with the demon Nightmare and accidentally discover that the Microverse is unraveling. A warning left in Rann&#x27;s mind reveals that three keys will restore balance to the Microverse. The team embarks on a new quest across three new regions of the Microverse: Oceania, Polaria, and the Dead Zone. The Micronauts are eventually successful, and also acquire several teammates, including the bestial Devil and his companion Fireflyte and the robot Nanotron.

A new problem arises when Prince Argon, turning tyrant after donning the sacred white armor of the legendary Force Commander, begins displaying paranoia regarding the Micronauts, and eventually sends a special alien Death Squad to kill them. The Micronauts defeat the unit, and then encounter the mutant Nightcrawler and battle a new foe called Huntarr. Huntarr had been genetically engineered into a virtually indestructible living weapon by Argon to destroy the Micronauts, but Marionette makes him see that Argon is simply using him.

A war against Argon and his forces follows, with several beings from various locations in the Microverse - including Argon&#x27;s ex-fiancee, the beautiful lowborn rebel leader Slug, and Prince Pharoid of Aegypta and his faithful lieutenant Margrave - joining the team in a bid to stop Argon. After several more encounters with beings such as Doctor Doom, Wasp, and Arcade, Microtron and Nanotron sacrifice themselves to reanimate Biotron&#x27;s consciousness in the Micronauts&#x27; new vessel, the Bioship. Argon is finally revealed to be controlled by the spirit of Baron Karza, who returns once more.

Karza kills Argon and deals the Micronauts a crushing defeat by killing Devil, Pharoid, Slug and Margrave. After regrouping and a series of skirmishes, the remaining Micronauts confront and defeat Karza once and for all.

====&quot;The Micronauts: The New Voyages&quot;====
Weary of war, the surviving Micronauts leave behind the known Microverse (which they discover looking back resembles a galaxy shaped like a DNA Helix) and embark on a journey of exploration. They eventually discover the true nature of the Microverse and, in a final act that restores their ruined world, sacrifice themselves in order to repopulate the planets.

== Team members ==
* Acroyear - The former ruler of the armor-clad Acroyears of the harsh and rocky planet Spartak. He possesses superhuman strength and wields an energy sword.
* Biotron - The first of the part machine, part organic roboids who accompanied Arcturus Rann on his 1,000 year mission. The loyal and dependable co-pilot of the &quot;H.M.S. Endeavor&quot; was destroyed and later resurrected in giant form as a sentient starcraft known as the Bioship.
* Bug - An insect-like thief from the planet Kaliklak. He is highly agile and wields a rocket-lance.
* Cilicia - The mother of Acroyear&#x27;s child and his former betrothed who turned against him when he was forced to destroy Spartak in order to keep it out of enemy hands.
* Devil - A highly intelligent, animalistic alien from the jungles of Tropica on Homeworld.
* Fireflyte - A sprite who is part of a fairy-like race linked to the Enigma Force and the life cycle of Devil&#x27;s species.
* Huntarr - A rebellious slum who was transformed into a mallable, monstrous form and brainwashed into attacking the Micronauts. After being freed from Argon&#x27;s control, he joins the Micronauts to get revenge.
* Marionette - The daughter of the slain rulers of Homeworld and sister of Prince Argon.
* Microtron - Marionette&#x27;s loyal little personal roboid whose clever computer brain and extendable pincer arms always come in handy.
* Nanotron - A small golden, one-eyed female roboid who served as Microtron&#x27;s loving assistant.
*Pharoid: Prince of Aegyptia (also known as Sand Zone) and keeper of the &quot;star scepter&quot;. Loyal to the Micronauts&#x27; cause, he joins the fight to free all of the zones of the Homeworld.
* Arcturus Rann - A heroic explorer and rotor-winged Space Glider who returned from a 1,000 year mission only to find his world taken over by his former teacher, Karza, who had become a Darth Vader-style despot while he was away.
* Scion - A metallic-skinned descendant of the mysterious Makers and Savior of the Microverse. Originally found as an egg which radiated enough energy to power a spaceship, he hatched into a grotesque big-brained scorpion-like creature before first evolving into a handsome, winged humanoid and then into a powerful Prime Being whose every molecule would be reborn as an individual living being.
* Solitaire - A highly manipulative Prime Being with both metamorphic and healing powers, she first took the form of a green-skinned Insectivorid version of the lovely blond Marionette to seduce Bug so that he would help her get on the team. Solitaire then turned herself into a sexy, scantily-clad version of Rann&#x27;s dark-haired mother Sepsis.

==The Microns==
Years later Arcturus, Marionette and Bug (both Marvel properties) reappear as a team called the Microns. They aid the mutant Cable when the scientist Psycho-Man abducts the shape-changing Copycat. They battle Microverse inhabitant Baron Zebek of Aegyptus alongside the visiting super-team Alpha Flight and later assist Rick Jones and Captain Marvel during their adventures in the Microverse. In another largely untold tale, they also reteam with the X-Men against Baron Karza, who had recently been reborn, and his ally Thanos who seek to merge several of the sub-atomic universes. Arcturus Rann and Princess Mari became involved in the Psyklop invasion of K&#x27;ai, Jarella&#x27;s homeworld.

==Other versions==
* In 1997, Marvel accepted a proposed reboot of &quot;Micronauts&quot; as a new series written by Shon C. Bury, penciled by Cary Nord and inked by Dan Green, using new character designs based on the original characters. Scripts were written for five issues and three issues were penciled, though Marvel was not granted the Micronauts license by the copyright holder, Abrams/Gentile Entertainment, forcing the series to be canceled.
* The Micronauts play a role in Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Earth X&quot; series.

==Collected editions==
The first five-issue story arc of the Image series have been collected into a trade paperback:
* &quot;Micronauts Vol. 1: Revolution&quot; (112 pages, Image Publishing, June 2003, )

In May 2023 Marvel renewed the licensing with Hasbro in order to be able to publish Micronauts again. To commemorate the announcement a Volume 1 Marvel Omnibus, containing the first 29 issues, two annuals &amp; material from Micronauts Special Edition featuring restored artwork, letter pages, house ads &amp; bonus material, was revealed for a May 2024 release:
* &quot;The Micronauts: The Original Marvel Years Omnibus Vol.1&quot;
Marvel Comics, May 2024

==In other media==
===Action figures===
From 2005, AGE gave permission for SOTA (State of the Art) Toys to produce redesigned Micronauts action figures as &quot;Micronauts Evolution&quot;, with concept art by Randy Queen. SOTA president Jerry Macaluso expressed interest in a new comic based on the figures.

===Animated television series===
In 1998, AGE, Annex Entertainment, Gribouille and Kaleidoscope Media Group planned to produce a Micronauts animated series starting with a five-part miniseries to air on the Sci Fi Channel in Fall of 1998, followed by a syndicated 26 episode Micronauts animated series for 1999, with action figures and a Marvel tie-in comic announced. The project appears to be shelved or canceled.

Boulder Media (then-subsidiary of Hasbro) planned to develop a new &quot;Micronauts&quot; animated series, but the project was delayed indefinitely as Hasbro sold Boulder Media to Australian media company Princess Pictures in 2022. According to writer Eric Rogers, 52 episodes of the series were produced, and confirmed the series received a tax write-off.

===Films===

* The Microverse, referred to as the Quantum Realm, appears in media set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).

* After Hasbro acquired the rights to the Micronauts toyline, Paramount Pictures in conjunction with J. J. Abrams was in negotiations to develop a movie version of the franchise in 2009. The planned project made little progress, though in November 2015, Paramount said that it was still planning a &quot;Micronauts&quot; film adaptation. Later in December, both Hasbro and Paramount were planning a cinematic universe combining Micronauts with &quot;G.I. Joe&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;M.A.S.K.&quot; and &quot;Rom&quot;. Several writers, such as Michael Chabon, Brian K. Vaughan, Nicole Perlman, Lindsey Beer, Cheo Coker, John Francis Daley, Jonathan Goldstein, Joe Robert Cole, Jeff Pinkner, Nicole Riegel and Geneva Robertson-Dworet joined to the writers&#x27; room in April 2016. In 2019, Dean DeBlois was attached to write and direct the film. By November 2020, Paramount removed the film from its release schedule.

===Novels===
The 2002 Image Comics relaunch was followed the same year by &quot;Micronauts: The Time Traveler Trilogy&quot;, a collection of three paperback novels published by Byron Preiss Visual Publications and written by Steve Lyons.

<doc id="661754" wikidata="Q2195794" url="?curid=661754" title="Postal codes in South Africa">
<text>Postal codes were introduced in South Africa on 8 October 1973, with the introduction of automated sorting.

==Format==

South African postal codes consist of four digits. Mail may be delivered either to the physical address or to a PO Box, particularly in rural areas where no street delivery is available. In addition, many large organisations may use Private Bag addresses, with mail dispatched to the holder by a mail contractor.

In the case of cities and large towns, however, the last two digits of the postal code indicate the mode of delivery. The digits &quot;01&quot; indicate a street address and &quot;00&quot; a PO Box or Private Bag address, with addresses in Port Elizabeth, for example, using the following format:

 300 Kempston Road
 Port Elizabeth 
 6001 

 PO Box 1840
 Port Elizabeth 
 6000

In Pretoria, however, a different format is used, with &quot;02&quot; indicating a street address, and &quot;01&quot; indicating a PO Box or Private Bag address.

 370 Church Street
 Pretoria 
 0002

 PO Box 427
 Pretoria 
 0001

A feature of South African postal addresses, also common to Australia, is that it is only necessary to include the suburb, not the city, for example, in the case of Yeoville in Johannesburg:

 43 Cavendish Road
 Yeoville
 2198

== Former postal codes ==
The South African postal code system was previously used in Namibia, then &quot;South West Africa&quot;, including the enclave of Walvis Bay, which remained part of South Africa until 1994. It was allocated the number range 9000–9299. 

Following independence, use of the South African postal code system was discontinued.

<text>The Institute of Public Enterprise (IPE) was established in 1964 for the study of issues and policies relating to public enterprise (PEs). S S Khera, ICS, the Cabinet Secretary, Government of India, had conceived the idea of a research institution that would undertake a systematic and sustained study of issues relevant to the formulation of policies towards public enterprises. In the early sixties, when PEs were designed as the principal instrument to serve the social and economic objectives of development, Khera felt a need for an institute that would collect information on PEs, study issues, and undertake consultancy and training for PEs.

V.V. Ramanadham, professor and head of the Department of Commerce, Osmania University, translated Khera&#x27;s concept into IPE, with support and guidance from D. S Reddy, Vice-Chancellor, Osmania University as an autonomous, non-profit society.

Management education started in 1980 with the start of a three-year part-time MBA(PE) programme. In 1995, the institute started a two-year full-time Post Graduate Diploma in Business Management (PGDBM). Currently, the institute offers various 2 year PGP courses, namely Post Graduation Diploma in Management(PGDM), PGDM – Marketing, PGDM – Banking, Insurance &amp; Finance, PGDM – Human Resource Management, and PGDM – International Business, the courses are recognized by AICTE

==Recognition==
The Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR) has recognized IPE as a &quot;Centre of Excellence&quot; in management sciences for doctoral studies. Seven universities have recognized the institute for the guidance of Ph.D. students in the field of Commerce, Economics, Management &amp; Public Administration. IPE is a training centre for the IAS and other senior officers of central and state governments, public sector enterprises, and the private corporate sector.

==Awards==
1.has been awarded for its outstanding partnership in the delivery of the IICA Certificate Programme (ICP) in CSR by the Indian Institute of Corporate Affairs, IICA, Manesar Gurgaon.

2.Dr. R K Mishra was conferred with &quot;CSR Eminent Directors of Leading Institutes Award&quot; for the year 2016.

3.Institute of Public Enterprise (IPE) has been awarded the Five Star category recognition by Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment (GRIHA) in its convention on February2016, in New Delhi.

<text>In computer science, remote evaluation is a general term for any technology that involves transmitting executable software code from a client computer to a server computer for subsequent executing at the server. After the code has finished executing, the results of its execution are sent back to the client.

Remote evaluation belongs to the family of mobile code, within the field of code mobility. An example for remote evaluation is grid computing: An executable task may be sent to a specific computer in the grid. After the execution has terminated, the result is sent back to the client. The client in turn may have to reassemble the different results of multiple concurrently calculated subtasks into one single result.

<doc id="661769" wikidata="Q1640093" url="?curid=661769" title="Parietal cell">
<text>Parietal cells (also known as oxyntic cells) are epithelial cells in the stomach that secrete hydrochloric acid (HCl) and intrinsic factor. These cells are located in the gastric glands found in the lining of the fundus and body regions of the stomach. They contain an extensive secretory network of canaliculi from which the HCl is secreted by active transport into the stomach. The enzyme hydrogen potassium ATPase (H+/K+ ATPase) is unique to the parietal cells and transports the H+ against a concentration gradient of about 3 million to 1, which is the steepest ion gradient formed in the human body. Parietal cells are primarily regulated via histamine, acetylcholine and gastrin signalling from both central and local modulators.

==Structure==
===Canaliculus===
A canaliculus is an adaptation found on gastric parietal cells. It is a deep infolding, or little channel, which serves to increase the surface area, e.g. for secretion. The parietal cell membrane is dynamic; the numbers of canaliculi rise and fall according to secretory need. This is accomplished by the fusion of canalicular precursors, or tubulovesicles, with the membrane to increase surface area, and the reciprocal endocytosis of the canaliculi (reforming the tubulovesicles) to decrease it.

==Function==
===Hydrochloric acid secretion===
Hydrochloric acid is formed in the following manner:
* Hydrogen ions are formed from the dissociation of carbonic acid. Water is a very minor source of hydrogen ions in comparison to carbonic acid. Carbonic acid is formed from carbon dioxide and water by carbonic anhydrase.
* The bicarbonate ion (HCO3−) is exchanged for a chloride ion (Cl−) on the basal side of the cell and the bicarbonate diffuses into the venous blood, leading to an alkaline tide phenomenon.
* Potassium (K+) and chloride (Cl−) ions diffuse into the canaliculi.
* Hydrogen ions are pumped out of the cell into the canaliculi in exchange for potassium ions, via the H+/K+-ATPase. These pumps are increased in number on luminal side by fusion of tubulovesicles during activation of parietal cells and removed during deactivation. This pump maintains a million-fold difference in proton concentration. ATP is provided by the numerous mitochondria.
As a result of the cellular export of hydrogen ions, the gastric lumen is maintained as a highly acidic environment. The acidity aids in digestion of food by promoting the unfolding (or denaturing) of ingested proteins. As proteins unfold, the peptide bonds linking component amino acids are exposed. Gastric HCl simultaneously cleaves pepsinogen, a zymogen, into active pepsin, an endopeptidase that advances the digestive process by breaking the now-exposed peptide bonds, a process known as proteolysis.

===Regulation===

Parietal cells secrete acid in response to three types of stimuli:
* Histamine, stimulating H2 histamine receptors (most significant contribution).
* Acetylcholine (ACh), from parasympathetic activity via the vagus nerve and enteric nervous system, stimulating M3 receptors.
* Gastrin, stimulating CCK2 receptors (least significant contribution, but also causes histamine secretion by local ECL cells).
Activation of histamine through H2 receptor causes increases in the intracellular cAMP level, while ACh through M3 receptor and gastrin through CCK2 receptor increases intracellular calcium level. These receptors are present on basolateral side of membrane.

Increased cAMP level results in increased protein kinase A. Protein kinase A phosphorylates proteins involved in the transport of H+/K+-ATPase from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane. This causes resorption of K+ ions and secretion of H+ ions. The pH of the secreted fluid can fall by 0.8.

Gastrin primarily induces acid-secretion indirectly, increasing histamine synthesis in ECL cells, which in turn signal parietal cells via histamine release and H2 stimulation. Gastrin itself has no effect on the maximum histamine-stimulated gastric acid secretion.

The effect of histamine, acetylcholine and gastrin is synergistic, that is, effect of two simultaneously is more than additive of effect of the two individually. It helps in non-linear increase of secretion with stimuli physiologically.

===Intrinsic factor secretion===
Parietal cells also produce a glycoprotein known as intrinsic factor. Intrinsic factor is required for the absorption of vitamin B in the diet. A long-term deficiency in vitamin B12 can lead to megaloblastic anemia, characterized by large fragile red blood cells. Pernicious anaemia results from autoimmune destruction of gastric parietal cells, precluding the synthesis of intrinsic factor and, by extension, absorption of vitamin B12. Pernicious anemia also leads to megaloblastic anemia. Atrophic gastritis, particularly in the elderly, will cause an inability to absorb B12 and can lead to deficiencies such as decreased DNA synthesis and nucleotide metabolism in the bone marrow.

==Clinical significance==
* &quot;Peptic ulcers&quot; can result from over-acidity in the stomach. Antacids can be used to enhance the natural tolerance of the gastric lining. Antimuscarinic drugs such as pirenzepine or H2 antihistamines can reduce acid secretion. Proton pump inhibitors are more potent at reducing gastric acid production since that is the final common pathway of all stimulation of acid production.
* In &quot;pernicious anemia&quot;, autoantibodies directed against parietal cells or intrinsic factor cause a reduction in vitamin B12 absorption. It can be treated with injections of replacement vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin, hydroxocobalamin or cyanocobalamin).
* &quot;Achlorhydria&quot; is another autoimmune disease of the parietal cells. The damaged parietal cells are unable to produce the required amount of gastric acid. This leads to an increase in gastric pH, impaired digestion of food and increased risk of gastroenteritis.

<text>Jessica Beatrice &quot;J. B.&quot; Fletcher () is a fictional detective and writer and the main character and protagonist of the American television series &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;. Portrayed by award-winning actress Angela Lansbury, Fletcher is a best-selling author of mystery novels, an English teacher, amateur detective, criminology professor, and (briefly) congresswoman. In 2004, Fletcher was listed in Bravo&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest TV Characters&quot;. AOL named her one of the &quot;100 Most Memorable Female TV Characters&quot;. The same website listed her among &quot;TV&#x27;s Smartest Detectives&quot;. She was ranked at number six on Sleuth Channel&#x27;s poll of &quot;America&#x27;s Top Sleuths&quot;. &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; called her the &quot;most prolific amateur sleuth&quot;.

==Background==
Jessica Beatrice Fletcher&#x27;s ancestors hailed mainly from Kilcleer, County Cork, Ireland, with one grandmother being English. Some episodes of the series feature Jessica&#x27;s distant relations who still live in England or Ireland. She has two sisters and two brothers, Martin and Marshall (Jason Evers), a doctor. Jessica&#x27;s maiden name was MacGill, inspired by the real-life maiden name of Angela Lansbury&#x27;s mother: Moyna MacGill. Before she met her husband Frank, Jessica went to Harrison College in Green Falls, New Hampshire, to become a journalist. In the episode &quot;Alma Murder&quot;, she mentions being a member of Delta Alpha Chi sorority.

Jessica is introduced as a widow in the first episode, her beloved husband Frank having died a couple of years before the start of the series. They had no children—she says she and Frank &quot;weren&#x27;t blessed that way&quot;—but spent some years raising their nephew Grady (Michael Horton) after the death of his parents, an unnamed brother of Frank and his wife. For this reason, Jessica is very close with Grady. In the show&#x27;s first episode, it is Grady who launches Jessica&#x27;s career as an author when he secretly sends her book &quot;The Corpse Danced at Midnight&quot; to an agent after she said she had no intention of doing so herself. Grady is a recurring character throughout the first six seasons, then makes one more appearance in season 11. Grady has several relationships that end in disappointment in some way until the introduction of girlfriend Donna Mayberry (played by Horton&#x27;s wife, Debbie Zipp) in the season 4 episode &quot;Just Another Fish Story&quot;. The two marry in the season 5 episode &quot;Something Borrowed, Someone Blue&quot;. Grady and Donna later have a son, Frankie, named after Jessica&#x27;s late husband.

Fletcher lives at 698 Candlewood Lane in the town of Cabot Cove, Maine, 03041. Cabot Cove is a town of 3,560 inhabitants near the ocean. Based on the number of murders that occur in a given season of the series, the town seems to have probably one of the highest murder rates of any town or city. This has even been remarked on in the series by the town sheriff, Mort Metzger (Ron Masak), who notes to Jessica Fletcher that in his first year in Cabot Cove, he had to deal with five murders and nicknames the town the “death capital of Maine”. 

Along with being a fiction author, Fletcher has other occupations during the series. It is mentioned that she was a substitute English teacher while raising Grady. After the sudden death of a congressman for Maine, she is asked to temporarily assume the position as congresswoman until another politician can step in; she also teaches a creative writing class at a women&#x27;s prison at one time. In the eighth-season premiere, Jessica accepts a job as a criminology instructor at Manhattan University. During this time, she keeps an apartment in Manhattan at the Penfield House Apartments, located at 941 West 61st Street. On the weekends, she still regularly returns to Cabot Cove.

It is established early in the series that Jessica cannot drive. This was written into the program to facilitate the character&#x27;s questioning of suspects and fellow investigators while having them drive her somewhere. Jessica&#x27;s travels as an author frequently take her to places around much of the world, giving the show writers freedom to explore characters and situations beyond rural New England. One trip takes her to Hawaii, where she shares a crossover case with private investigator Thomas Magnum (the titular star of &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;).

==Relatives==
Throughout the series, it is shown that Jessica has a sizeable family, both by blood and by marriage. Although Grady and Donna featured prominently, there were also numerous other nieces, nephews, and cousins who found themselves in need of Jessica&#x27;s help after becoming involved in murder cases. After Grady, the most notable recurring relative was Jessica&#x27;s niece Victoria Brandon (Genie Francis), who was married to hapless actor Howard Griffin (Jeff Conaway); both found one or the other of themselves accused of murder on no less than three occasions.

Jessica was also close with the family of Frank&#x27;s brother Neil (Jackie Cooper), who had died some years before Frank had. In the third-season premiere, while attending the wedding of Neil&#x27;s granddaughter Carol Bannister (Courteney Cox), Carol convinces Jessica that Neil is not dead, having received a silver leprechaun from an unknown sender as a wedding present—the same present Neil has promised to send her since childhood. Despite her own skepticism, Jessica investigates and discovers that Neil faked his death, changed his name to Carl Schulman, and ran away to join the circus. When found, he confesses to Jessica that he could no longer face living out a loveless marriage to his domineering wife Constance (Laraine Day), nor could he tolerate his materialistic daughter Audrey (Susan Brown); he does express regret for not saying goodbye to Carol or her father, Audrey&#x27;s genial but henpecked husband Howard (Dennis Howard). Soon after their reunion, Neil finds himself chief suspect for the murder of the circus&#x27;s abusive ringmaster. After solving the case and clearing Neil&#x27;s name, Jessica brings him back to reunite with Carol before her wedding.

Other relatives who appeared in the series for one-time appearances include niece Carol Donovan (Anne Kerry Ford), her detective husband Bert (James Stephens) and their children, Billy and Cindy (sibling actors Summer and Joaquin Phoenix); her brother Marshall&#x27;s widowed daughter, Pamela Crane (Belinda Montgomery); nieces Nita Cochran (Alice Krige), Jill Morton (Kristy McNichol) and Carrie Palmer (Kate McNeil); nephew Johnny Eaton (Todd Bryant); cousins Abby Benton Freestone (Lynn Redgrave), Ann Owens Arden (Shirley Jones), Helen Owens (Doris Roberts) and George Owens (Robert Walker Jr); and Frank&#x27;s distant cousin, Calhoun Fletcher (Peter Bonerz).

==Career and life as a best-selling author==
Fletcher began her career writing on an old Royal typewriter, but as her career progresses, she eventually purchases a computer running Windows 3.1. Among her friends she can count multi-millionaires who own Beech Starships as well as down-on-their-luck homeless people, moving effortlessly between the social strata. The format of the show usually has Jessica solving the mysteries within five minutes of the end of each program, unless the producers felt they could prolong the suspense across two episodes. Perhaps her most notable experience was encountering a Mr. Potts, who preferred to be called Mr. Bond—he did at least have an Aston Martin DB6, in which Jessica herself ended up racing to the rescue.

Fletcher&#x27;s relationship with law-enforcement officials varies from place to place. Both the sheriffs of Cabot Cove are used to, or have resigned themselves to, having her meddle in their cases. However, most detectives and police officers do not want her anywhere near their crime scenes, until her accurate deductions persuade them to listen to what she has to say. Others are fans of her books and give her free rein. With time, she makes friends in many police departments across the United States, as well as a British police officer attached to Scotland Yard.

==Solving crimes==
Fletcher is a retired teacher-turned-author of detective fiction under the name J.B. Fletcher, but constantly finds that her work and personal life overlap. In every episode, she is introduced into a situation where someone is killed shortly after her arrival. She is generally forced to solve every mystery herself in the style of one of the characters from her book, as the police prove to be incapable of doing so without her help. In fact, on at least one occasion, a law enforcement officer is actually unmasked as the killer, when John Astin appears as the villainous Sheriff Harry Pierce.

Episodes usually follow a formula. The episode opens as Fletcher arrives, either in her fictitious town of residence (Cabot Cove, Maine), or visiting elsewhere (typically in New York City or Boston) and meets several characters. These characters are usually Mrs. Fletcher&#x27;s friends, family, relations, or business associates (in connection with her role as a successful author). Several of these characters are shown to have motive with respect to the potential demise of (either themselves or) one of their associates (typically an unlikeable individual). Often at least one of them is heard to make a threat against this individual, upon which the character will become the principal suspect. About a third of the way through the episode, if not earlier, the likely victim is found dead. After a brief investigation, the authorities arrest the most obvious suspect, but Jessica believes that the arrested suspect (who is an amiable person, often a friend, or relative of Jessica) is innocent, and sets out to prove it.

An unrelated conversation will often suggest to Jessica the solution to the mystery, at which point she will rush off to confirm her suspicion (without telling the viewers what she has in mind and sometimes even says she thinks she knows the culprit but must still figure out how to prove it before she reveals who). The next scene will present Jessica at the place where the crime was committed, where Jessica will find one of the characters, usually alone. She enters into a conversation with this character and in a few minutes accuses him or her of being the killer, explaining how and why this person did it. The murderer first denies guilt, but Jessica describes a few clues which she observed and which the episode viewers may or may not have had an opportunity to see. Sometimes Fletcher will make up evidence which was not actually found, but the discovery of which will seem plausible to the killer. At this point, the murderer admits guilt and confesses, whereupon Jessica shakes her head sadly. Sometimes the killer will draw a weapon and attempt to kill Jessica but will be thwarted by timely police appearance from a hiding place to arrest the true killer.

The episode concludes with a final scene in which the innocent former suspects say goodbye to Jessica and thank her for the happy ending. Almost every episode then ends with a freeze frame shot of Jessica laughing or smiling. Of course, the above is only a formula and there were some unusual shows, such as the one episode where the supposedly framed suspect actually was the murderer. Then, there is another episode in which, while Grady and his heavily pregnant wife were house-sitting for Jessica who was visiting London, someone was murdered in the lounge. Fortunately Jessica, who had been blissfully unaware of the murder for half the episode, solved the crime over the phone.

<doc id="661804" wikidata="Q3922567" url="?curid=661804" title="Professional Basketball League of America">
<text>The Professional Basketball League of America was a basketball league in the United States that existed for less than one month in 1947. It was launched in response to the tremendous upsurge in interest in basketball in the era immediately following World War II and based on the success of the Chicago Gears and its star center, George Mikan. The organization was underfunded compared to its competitors, the Basketball Association of America, the National Basketball League, and even the American Basketball League; there was simply not enough room in the marketplace for four major professional basketball leagues. The PBLA folded on November 13, 1947 after playing only 54 games among its 16 teams.

Today the league is best known for George Mikan, the star center for the Chicago Gears. After the PBLA&#x27;s collapse, rights to its players were distributed among NBL teams via a dispersal draft. The first pick belonged to the new Minneapolis Lakers, the successor to the Detroit Gems, which had finished the previous season 4–40. The Lakers selected Mikan with the first pick, launching what would become the first dynasty in the NBA&#x27;s history.

Five people associated with the PBLA have been inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame:

* George Mikan, center for the Chicago Gears
* Bobby McDermott, player/coach for the Chicago Gears

<text>In geometry and crystallography, a Bravais lattice, named after , is an infinite array of discrete points generated by a set of discrete translation operations described in three dimensional space by

: formula_1

where the &quot;ni&quot; are any integers, and a&quot;i&quot; are &quot;primitive translation vectors&quot;, or &quot;primitive vectors&quot;, which lie in different directions (not necessarily mutually perpendicular) and span the lattice. The choice of primitive vectors for a given Bravais lattice is not unique. A fundamental aspect of any Bravais lattice is that, for any choice of direction, the lattice appears exactly the same from each of the discrete lattice points when looking in that chosen direction.

The Bravais lattice concept is used to formally define a &quot;crystalline arrangement&quot; and its (finite) frontiers. A crystal is made up of one or more atoms, called the &quot;basis&quot; or &quot;motif&quot;, at each lattice point. The &quot;basis&quot; may consist of atoms, molecules, or polymer strings of solid matter, and the lattice provides the locations of the basis. 

Two Bravais lattices are often considered equivalent if they have isomorphic symmetry groups. In this sense, there are 5 possible Bravais lattices in 2-dimensional space and 14 possible Bravais lattices in 3-dimensional space. The 14 possible symmetry groups of Bravais lattices are 14 of the 230 space groups. In the context of the space group classification, the Bravais lattices are also called Bravais classes, Bravais arithmetic classes, or Bravais flocks.

==Unit cell==

In crystallography, there is the concept of a unit cell which comprises the space between adjacent lattice points as well as any atoms in that space. A unit cell is defined as a space that, when translated through a subset of all vectors described by formula_2, fills the lattice space without overlapping or voids. (I.e., a lattice space is a multiple of a unit cell.) 

There are mainly two types of unit cells: primitive unit cells and conventional unit cells. A primitive cell is the very smallest component of a lattice (or crystal) which, when stacked together with lattice translation operations, reproduces the whole lattice (or crystal). Note that the translations must be lattice translation operations that cause the lattice to appear unchanged after the translation. If arbitrary translations were allowed, one could make a primitive cell half the size of the true one, and translate twice as often, as an example. 

Another way of defining the size of a primitive cell that avoids invoking lattice translation operations, is to say that the primitive cell is the smallest possible component of a lattice (or crystal) that can be repeated to reproduce the whole lattice (or crystal), &quot;and&quot; that contains exactly one lattice point. In either definition, the primitive cell is characterized by its small size. 

There are clearly many choices of cell that can reproduce the whole lattice when stacked (two lattice halves, for instance), and the minimum size requirement distinguishes the primitive cell from all these other valid repeating units. If the lattice or crystal is 2-dimensional, the primitive cell has a minimum area; likewise in 3 dimensions the primitive cell has a minimum volume. 

Despite this rigid minimum-size requirement, there is not one unique choice of primitive unit cell. In fact, all cells whose borders are primitive translation vectors will be primitive unit cells. The fact that there is not a unique choice of primitive translation vectors for a given lattice leads to the multiplicity of possible primitive unit cells. Conventional unit cells, on the other hand, are not necessarily minimum-size cells. They are chosen purely for convenience and are often used for illustration purposes. They are loosely defined.

===Primitive unit cell===
Primitive unit cells are defined as unit cells with the smallest volume for a given crystal. (A crystal is a lattice and a basis at every lattice point.) To have the smallest cell volume, a primitive unit cell must contain (1) only one lattice point and (2) the minimum amount of basis constituents (e.g., the minimum number of atoms in a basis). For the former requirement, counting the number of lattice points in a unit cell is such that, if a lattice point is shared by &quot;m&quot; adjacent unit cells around that lattice point, then the point is counted as 1/&quot;m&quot;. The latter requirement is necessary since there are crystals that can be described by more than one combination of a lattice and a basis. For example, a crystal, viewed as a lattice with a single kind of atom located at every lattice point (the simplest basis form), may also be viewed as a lattice with a basis of two atoms. In this case, a primitive unit cell is a unit cell having only one lattice point in the first way of describing the crystal in order to ensure the smallest unit cell volume.

There can be more than one way to choose a primitive cell for a given crystal and each choice will have a different primitive cell shape, but the primitive cell volume is the same for every choice and each choice will have the property that a one-to-one correspondence can be established between primitive unit cells and discrete lattice points over the associated lattice. All primitive unit cells with different shapes for a given crystal have the same volume by definition; For a given crystal, if &quot;n&quot; is the density of lattice points in a lattice ensuring the minimum amount of basis constituents and &quot;v&quot; is the volume of a chosen primitive cell, then &quot;nv&quot; = 1 resulting in &quot;v&quot; = 1/&quot;n&quot;, so every primitive cell has the same volume of 1/&quot;n&quot;.

Among all possible primitive cells for a given crystal, an obvious primitive cell may be the parallelepiped formed by a chosen set of primitive translation vectors. (Again, these vectors must make a lattice with the minimum amount of basis constituents.) That is, the set of all points formula_3 where formula_4 and formula_5 is the chosen primitive vector. This primitive cell does not always show the clear symmetry of a given crystal. In this case, a conventional unit cell easily displaying the crystal symmetry is often used. The conventional unit cell volume will be an integer-multiple of the primitive unit cell volume.

== Origin of concept ==

In two dimensions, any lattice can be specified by the length of its two primitive translation vectors and the angle between them. There are an infinite number of possible lattices one can describe in this way. Some way to categorize different types of lattices is desired. One way to do so is to recognize that some lattices have inherent symmetry. One can impose conditions on the length of the primitive translation vectors and on the angle between them to produce various symmetric lattices. These symmetries themselves are categorized into different types, such as point groups (which includes mirror symmetries, inversion symmetries and rotation symmetries) and translational symmetries. Thus, lattices can be categorized based on what point group or translational symmetry applies to them.

In two dimensions, the most basic point group corresponds to rotational invariance under 2π and π, or 1- and 2-fold rotational symmetry. This actually applies automatically to all 2D lattices, and is the most general point group. Lattices contained in this group (technically all lattices, but conventionally all lattices that don&#x27;t fall into any of the other point groups) are called oblique lattices. From there, there are 4 further combinations of point groups with translational elements (or equivalently, 4 types of restriction on the lengths/angles of the primitive translation vectors) that correspond to the 4 remaining lattice categories: square, hexagonal, rectangular, and centered rectangular. Thus altogether there are 5 Bravais lattices in 2 dimensions.

Likewise, in 3 dimensions, there are 14 Bravais lattices: 1 general &quot;wastebasket&quot; category (triclinic) and 13 more categories. These 14 lattice types are classified by their point groups into 7 lattice systems (triclinic, monoclinic, orthorhombic, tetragonal, cubic, rhombohedral, and hexagonal).

==In 2 dimensions==

In two-dimensional space there are 5 Bravais lattices, grouped into four lattice systems, shown in the table below. Below each diagram is the Pearson symbol for that Bravais lattice.

Note: In the unit cell diagrams in the following table the lattice points are depicted using black circles and the unit cells are depicted using parallelograms (which may be squares or rectangles) outlined in black. Although each of the four corners of each parallelogram connects to a lattice point, only one of the four lattice points technically belongs to a given unit cell and each of the other three lattice points belongs to one of the adjacent unit cells. This can be seen by imagining moving the unit cell parallelogram slightly left and slightly down while leaving all the black circles of the lattice points fixed.


The unit cells are specified according to the relative lengths of the cell edges (&quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;) and the angle between them (&quot;θ&quot;). The area of the unit cell can be calculated by evaluating the norm , where a and b are the lattice vectors. The properties of the lattice systems are given below:


==In 3 dimensions==

In three-dimensional space there are 14 Bravais lattices. These are obtained by combining one of the seven lattice systems with one of the centering types. The centering types identify the locations of the lattice points in the unit cell as follows:

*Primitive (P): lattice points on the cell corners only (sometimes called simple)
*Base-centered (S: A, B, or C): lattice points on the cell corners with one additional point at the center of each face of one pair of parallel faces of the cell (sometimes called end-centered)
*Body-centered (I): lattice points on the cell corners, with one additional point at the center of the cell
*Face-centered (F): lattice points on the cell corners, with one additional point at the center of each of the faces of the cell

Not all combinations of lattice systems and centering types are needed to describe all of the possible lattices, as it can be shown that several of these are in fact equivalent to each other. For example, the monoclinic I lattice can be described by a monoclinic C lattice by different choice of crystal axes. Similarly, all A- or B-centred lattices can be described either by a C- or P-centering. This reduces the number of combinations to 14 conventional Bravais lattices, shown in the table below. Below each diagram is the Pearson symbol for that Bravais lattice.

Note: In the unit cell diagrams in the following table all the lattice points on the cell boundary (corners and faces) are shown; however, not all of these lattice points technically belong to the given unit cell. This can be seen by imagining moving the unit cell slightly in the negative direction of each axis while keeping the lattice points fixed. Roughly speaking, this can be thought of as moving the unit cell slightly left, slightly down, and slightly out of the screen. This shows that only one of the eight corner lattice points (specifically the front, left, bottom one) belongs to the given unit cell (the other seven lattice points belong to adjacent unit cells). In addition, only one of the two lattice points shown on the top and bottom face in the &quot;Base-centered&quot; column belongs to the given unit cell. Finally, only three of the six lattice points on the faces in the &quot;Face-centered&quot; column belong to the given unit cell.


The unit cells are specified according to six lattice parameters which are the relative lengths of the cell edges (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) and the angles between them (&quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot;, &quot;γ&quot;), where &quot;α&quot; is the angle between &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot;, &quot;β&quot; is the angle between &quot;a&quot; and &quot;c&quot;, and &quot;γ&quot; is the angle between &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;. The volume of the unit cell can be calculated by evaluating the triple product , where a, b, and c are the lattice vectors. The properties of the lattice systems are given below:


Some basic information for the lattice systems and Bravais lattices in three dimensions is summarized in the diagram at the beginning of this page. The seven sided polygon (heptagon) and the number 7 at the centre indicate the seven lattice systems. The inner heptagons indicate the lattice angles, lattice parameters, Bravais lattices and Schöenflies notations for the respective lattice systems.

==In 4 dimensions==

In four dimensions, there are 64 Bravais lattices. Of these, 23 are primitive and 41 are centered. Ten Bravais lattices split into enantiomorphic pairs.

<doc id="661811" wikidata="Q4103224" url="?curid=661811" title="Theodore Van Kirk">
<text>Theodore Jerome &quot;Dutch&quot; Van Kirk (February 27, 1921 – July 28, 2014) was a navigator in the United States Army Air Forces, best known as the navigator of the &quot;Enola Gay&quot; when it dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima. Upon the death of fellow crewman Morris Jeppson on March 30, 2010, Van Kirk became the last surviving member of the &quot;Enola Gay&quot; crew.

==Career==
Van Kirk was born in Northumberland, Pennsylvania, to Frederick and Grace (Snyder) Van Kirk. He joined the Army Air Force Aviation Cadet Program in October 1941. On 1 April 1942, he received both his commission and navigator wings and transferred to the 97th Bomb Group, the first operational Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress unit in England. The crew of the &quot;Red Gremlin&quot; also included pilot Paul Tibbets and bombardier Tom Ferebee. Van Kirk would later fly with these men on the Hiroshima mission.

From August to October 1942, the crew flew 11 missions out of England. They were the lead aircraft, responsible for group navigation and bombing. In October 1942, they flew General Mark Clark to Gibraltar for his secret North African rendezvous with the French prior to Operation Torch. In November, they ferried General Eisenhower to Gibraltar to command the North African invasion forces. After German reinforcements began pouring into the port of Bizerte, Tunisia, posing a serious threat to Allied strategy, a new mission emerged. On 16 November 1942, the crew led their group in an attack that took the Germans by surprise at Sidi Ahmed Air Base at Bizerte.

===Atomic bombing of Japan===

Van Kirk returned to the U.S. in June 1943 after flying a total of 58 missions overseas. He served as an instructor navigator until reuniting with Tibbets and Ferebee in the 509th Composite Group at Wendover Field, Utah, in late 1944. The group flew the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, with Tibbets as commander and Van Kirk as the group navigator. From November 1944 to June 1945 they trained continually for the first atomic bomb drop, which occurred 6 August 1945.

The thirteen-hour mission to Hiroshima began at 02:45 hrs in the morning Tinian time. By the time they rendezvoused with their accompanying B-29s at 0607 hrs over Iwo Jima, the group was three hours from the target area. As they approached the target Van Kirk worked closely with the bombardier, Tom Ferebee, to confirm the winds and aimpoint. The bomb fell away from the aircraft at 09:15:17 Tinian time. Van Kirk later participated in Operation Crossroads, the first Bikini Atoll atomic bomb tests.
According to the 1995 &quot;New York Times&quot; interview by Gustav Niebuhr Mr. Van Kirk said he was often asked, &quot;given a choice about his role in the Hiroshima bombing, would he do it again?&quot;:
Under the same circumstancesand the key words are &quot;the same circumstances&quot;  yes, I would do it again. We were in a war for five years. We were fighting an enemy that had a reputation for never surrendering, never accepting defeat. It&#x27;s really hard to talk about morality and war in the same sentence. In a war, there are so many questionable things done. Where was the morality in the bombing of Coventry, or the bombing of Dresden, or the Bataan Death March, or the Rape of Nanking, or the bombing of Pearl Harbor? I believe that when you&#x27;re in a war, a nation must have the courage to do what it must to win the war with a minimum loss of lives.
In October 2007, Van Kirk auctioned off the flight log he kept on board the Enola Gay during the atomic bombing of Hiroshima for US$358,500 in a public auction. Van Kirk stated he decided to sell the log, because he wanted it to be kept at a museum. The auction house did not reveal the name of the successful bidder, although it said it was a U.S. citizen.

<text>The National Professional Basketball League (NPBL) was a professional basketball league in the United States from 1950–51, serving as a successor league to the National Basketball League that operated from 1937 to 1949.

==History==
The National Basketball Association contracted after the 1949–1950 season, losing six teams: The Anderson Packers, Sheboygan Red Skins and Waterloo Hawks jumped to the NPBL, while the Chicago Stags, Denver Nuggets and St. Louis Bombers folded. The league went from 17 teams to 11 before the 1950–1951 season started. Midway through the 1950–1951 season, the Washington Capitols folded as well, bringing the number of teams in the league down to ten.

The National Professional Basketball League was formed around the former NBA teams, with teams added in new larger markets. The charter teams were the East Division: Sheboygan Redskins (Former NBA), Anderson Packers (Former NBA), Louisville Alumnites and Grand Rapids Hornets. West Division: Denver Refiners/Evansville Agogans, Saint Paul Lights, Kansas City Hi-Spots and Waterloo Hawks (Former NBA).

The league played just one season, with no championship finals ever being staged. Doxie Moore served as commissioner. The Grand Rapids Hornets, Kansas City Hi-Spots, Louisville Alumnites and Saint Paul Lights franchised folded during the season and the Denver Refiners relocated to Evansville, Indiana to become the Evansville Agogans.

The Sheboygan Red Skins and Waterloo Hawks both claimed the championship because they were each in first in their divisions at the end of the season, but they never met in a playoff series.

<doc id="661824" wikidata="Q7423370" url="?curid=661824" title="Saratoga Race Course">
<text>Saratoga Race Course is a Thoroughbred horse racing track located on Union Avenue in Saratoga Springs, New York, United States. Opened in 1863, it is often considered to be the oldest major sporting venue of any kind in the U.S. It is the fourth oldest racetrack after Pleasanton Fairgrounds Racetrack (1858), Freehold Raceway (1854) and Fair Grounds Race Course (1852).

The racetrack is operated by the New York Racing Assocation. 

The Saratoga meet originally lasted only four days. The meet has been lengthened gradually since that time. From 1962 to 1990, the meet lasted four weeks and began in late July or early August. In 2010, the meet expanded to 40 racing days, with races held five days per week. It lasts from mid-July through Labor Day in early September.

==History==
Saratoga Springs was the site of &quot;trials of speed and exhibition of horses&quot; at county fairs as early as 1822. In 1847, in anticipation of the New York State Fair being held in Saratoga that September, the Saratoga Trotting Course was built, and hosted its first harness race on August 14. The old harness racing track was located just south of the current Oklahoma Track, and today the area is called Horse Haven.

In 1857 the Empire Race Course was opened on an island in the Hudson River near Albany, but was in operation only a short time.

On August 3, 1863, casino operator and future congressman John Morrissey organized the first thoroughbred race card on the Oklahoma Track. After the successful meet ended, Morrissey purchased 125 acres of land across the street from the old standardbred track, built a new grandstand, and dubbed the venue Saratoga Race Course. Among those instrumental to the creation of the new course were John Hunter (later the first chairman of The Jockey Club), William R. Travers, John Morrissey, and Leonard Jerome.

Saratoga Race Course has been in use almost every year since 1864, with only a handful of exceptions. The course was closed in 1896 due to increasing competition among thoroughbred tracks, making the meet at Saratoga not viable that season. Anti-gambling legislation, which had passed in New York, resulted in a cessation in all thoroughbred racing in that state during 1911 and 1912. From 1943 to 1945, racing was curtailed at Saratoga due to travel restrictions during World War II. During those years, the stakes races usually held at Saratoga Race Course were instead contested at Belmont Park.

The late 1800s were a period of decline for the Race Course. In 1892 it was purchased by notorious gambler Gottfried &quot;Dutch Fred&quot; Waldbaum, the operator of the notorious Guttenberg racetrack in North Bergen, New Jersey. In 1901, it was purchased by a group of investors led by William Collins Whitney, who made major improvements and restored its reputation.

The track&#x27;s first parimutuel betting machines were installed in 1940. 

In the 1960s, the grandstand was extended, doubling the track&#x27;s seating capacity.

In 1999, Saratoga Race Course was rated as &quot;Sports Illustrated&#x27;s&quot; #10 sports venue of the 20th century.

On Saturday, June 8, 2024, the 156th running of the Belmont Stakes was held at Saratoga Race Course, due to construction at Belmont Park.

=== Graveyard of Champions ===
Saratoga Race Course has several nicknames: &quot;The Spa&quot; (for the nearby mineral springs), the &quot;House of Upsets&quot;, and the &quot;Graveyard of Champions&quot;. Famous race horses to lose at the track:
* Man o&#x27; War suffered his only defeat in twenty-one starts while racing at Saratoga Race Course, losing to Upset in the 1919 Sanford Stakes 
* Gallant Fox, the 1930 Triple Crown winner, was beaten by the 100-1 longshot Jim Dandy in the 1930 Travers Stakes
* Secretariat, the 1973 Triple Crown winner, was defeated by Onion in the 1973 Whitney Handicap
* Rachel Alexandra, the 2009 Horse of the Year, was beaten in the 2010 Personal Ensign Stakes by Persistently, who closed a length and a half in the final 1/16 mile;
* American Pharoah, the 2015 Triple Crown winner and a 1-5 favorite, was upset in the 2015 Travers Stakes by Keen Ice for his second career loss

==Course==

As is the case with the other two tracks operated by the New York Racing Association – Aqueduct and Belmont Park  – there are three separate tracks in the main course at Saratoga Race Course:
* a main (dirt) track, which, like that at Aqueduct, has a -mile (9-furlong or 1,811 m) circumference;
** chute for 7-furlong events near the end of the first turn
** chute for 1 mile events at the start of the first turn known as the Wilson Chute. Originally was in use until 1972 when an additional parking lot was created. The chute was used in 1992 for one season. The Wilson Chute was later resurrected in 2022 as has been used since.
* a 1-mile (8-furlong) turf track, known officially as the Mellon Turf Course in honor of the Mellon family, whose members include prominent thoroughbred owner/breeder Paul Mellon and his father Andrew Mellon, a former United States Treasury Secretary; and
* an inner turf track, the circumference of which is 7 furlongs (1,408 m).
Steeplechase races are also run at Saratoga Race Course and take place on the inner turf course.

The Oklahoma Training Track, which is across Union Avenue from the main course (was originally named Horse Haven), is used for warmups and training. The Oklahoma Training Track site was the location of the track used for racing at the inaugural meet in 1863; the main grandstand was opened at the current site the following year. On August 3, 2013, the new Whitney Viewing Stand opened at the Oklahoma Track. It allows public viewing of workouts at the track, replicating a former stand from the 19th century.

A distinctive feature of Saratoga Race Course&#x27;s dirt track was the Wilson Mile chute, which branched off from the clubhouse (first) turn at a 90-degree angle. The chute was dismantled after the 1972 season to make room for additional parking, although in 1992 some one-mile dirt races were brought back at approximately the same location. NYRA announced in January 2022 that the Wilson Mile chute would be rebuilt for the 2022 racing season.

The grounds at Saratoga Race Course contain several unique features. Prior to each race, a bell is hand rung at exactly 17 minutes prior to scheduled post time for each race to call the jockeys to the paddock. Patrons can get close up views of the horses being led to the paddock as the path from the stables runs through the picnic grounds. There is a mineral spring called the Big Red Spring in the picnic grounds where patrons can partake of the water that made Saratoga Springs famous. A gazebo is a prominent feature of the infield, and a stylized version of the gazebo is part of the Saratoga Race Course logo.

Saratoga Race Course is home to several of the most important races in North America. Since 1864, the track has been the site of the Travers Stakes, the oldest major thoroughbred horse race in the United States. Like the Kentucky Derby, the Travers Stakes is contested on dirt and is open only to three-year-olds, with a purse of $1,250,000. Several other major stakes races are held at Saratoga each year as well, including the Alabama Stakes (for three-year-old fillies), the Hopeful Stakes for two-year-olds, and the Whitney Stakes for three-year-olds and up (a Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic &quot;Win and You&#x27;re In&quot; qualifier).

A new addition in recent years has been &quot;twilight racing&quot;, where the first race post time is at 2:30 pm on some days, previously 2:45 PM.

==Races==
The 2022 racing season includes 77 stakes races worth $22.6 million in total purses. This represents a $1.1 million increase over the 2021 season.

The following are Graded stakes races run at Saratoga:

Grade I Stakes races:

Grade II Stakes races:

Grade III Stakes races:

Ungraded stakes

Discontinued Stakes races:

Steeplechase:

*New York Turf Writers Cup Handicap (Grade I)
*A. P. Smithwick Memorial Handicap (Grade I)

==Burials==
Buried at Clare Court Jogging Track are Fourstardave, Mourjane (IRE), Quick Call and A Phenomenon. Champion filly Go For Wand, who suffered a fatal injury during the stretch run of the 1990 Breeders Cup Distaff, is buried in the Saratoga Race Course infield.

== Economy ==
The Saratoga Race Course is a significant contributor to the Saratoga Springs economy. A 2011 economic analysis of the Saratoga Race Course found that visitors of the race track yielded between $39 million and $55 million annually in direct spending, and a total (a sum of the direct effects and the indirect and induced effects of visitor spending) of $67 million and $94 million annually. This spending was a result of expenditures for lodging, meals, entertainment, retail, and transportation in Saratoga County.

In August 2021, the President of the Saratoga County Chamber of Commerce, Todd Shimkus, estimated that the race track had a $240 million annual regional economic impact. The COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on small business owners in the city of Saratoga Springs, as the 2020 meet did not allow in-person spectators at the venue.

<doc id="661829" wikidata="Q1087040" url="?curid=661829" title="Christopher Tye">
<text>Christopher Tye (before 1573) was an English Renaissance composer and organist. Probably born in Cambridgeshire, he trained at the University of Cambridge and became the master of the choir at Ely Cathedral. He is noted as the music teacher of Edward VI and was held in high esteem for his choral music, as well as chamber works such as his 24 polyphonic &quot;In nomines&quot;. It is likely that only a small percentage of his compositional output survives, often only as fragments; his &quot;Acts of the Apostles&quot; was the only work to be published in his lifetime.

He ceased composing when he was ordained, returning to Ely Cathedral and later becoming rector of Doddington, Cambridgeshire. Today, he is perhaps best known for the hymn &quot;Winchester Old&quot;, based on a theme from &quot;Acts of the Apostles&quot;, which forms the basis of the most commonly performed version in the United Kingdom of &quot;While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks&quot;.

==Beginnings==

Little is known about Tye&#x27;s origins. Cambridge University records for the academic year 1536–37 indicate that he received the degree of Bachelor of Music after &quot;a study of ten years in the musical art&quot;; from this it is supposed that Tye was born around 1505 (making him a direct contemporary of Thomas Tallis), probably in Cambridgeshire, where the family name was common and where Tye would go on to spend much of his career. For two terms in 1537 Tye is recorded among the lay clerks of the Choir of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge; it was in 1536–37 that the so called &quot;temporary&quot; chapel (in use since the 1440s) collapsed, so Tye may well have been part of the first generation of lay clerks to sing in regular worship in the iconic King&#x27;s College Chapel known today.

By 1543 Tye had taken up the position of &quot;Magister Choristarum&quot; (choirmaster) at Ely Cathedral. In 1545 the University of Cambridge awarded him the degree of Doctor of Music, and three years later the same honour was bestowed on him by the University of Oxford.

==Work with the Royal Court==

The composer&#x27;s career shows that he had a strong connection to Richard Cox, who was a passionate church reformer and a tutor of King Edward (then Prince Edward). This affiliation would prove to have a strong influence on him for the rest of his life. Cox was also the person who very probably introduced Tye to the royal court. It is believed that this led to Christopher Tye being a kind of musical adviser of the court who worked closely with Edward. In 1605, Samuel Rowley (believed to be Tye&#x27;s grandson) wrote a play entitled &quot;When You See Me You Know Me&quot;. In the play, Tye and King Edward play important roles and exchange dialogue where Edward identifies &#x27;Doctor Tye&#x27; as &#x27;Our music&#x27;s lecturer.&#x27;

Later, in 1553, Tye published his rhymed scriptural paraphrase, &quot;The Actes of the Apostles&quot;. In it he takes the ideas set forth in the book of &#x27;Acts&#x27; in the Bible and sets them to meter. Although it was met with divided reviews (even today), the work is hugely important because it is dedicated to Edward. In the preface he goes into some detail that implies a kind of friendship between the two. Although it is never mentioned explicitly, it is generally assumed that Tye held a position in the Chapel Royal staff during the 1550s at some point.

==Religious posts==

In 1558, Tye took up his posting again at Ely Cathedral, probably at the request of his old friend, Richard Cox. Soon, thereafter, Tye took it upon himself to take up a place in the ministry and thus ceased to compose music. Cox, who was Bishop of Ely during this time, ordained the composer as deacon in 1560 and later in the year as priest. Tye resigned from the post at Ely and was appointed to Doddington, Cambridgeshire, the richest benefice in England.

Tye is believed to have died at Doddington before March 1573 when his successor as rector was appointed, although no record is found of his death.

==Works==

As a pre-eminent court musician with strong Protestant leanings, Tye is generally considered to be one of the most influential English composers of his day. Even after his appointment in the ministry when his composing ceased, his reputation as a musician continued to spread. However, only one of Tye&#x27;s works, &quot;Actes of the Apostles&quot; of 1553, a verse translation of the Acts of the Apostles into four-part harmony, was published during his lifetime. Compared to his polyphonic works, this work is not well regarded, although it is from this collection that his most familiar piece is derived; the most common tune of &quot;While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks&quot;.

His surviving Latin polyphonic choral works, most likely dating from the reign of Henry VIII include three full masses - the &quot;Peterhouse&quot; mass, a &quot;Westron Wynde&quot; mass and a six-voice &quot;Missa Euge bone&quot;. Other surviving movements from psalms include &quot;Quaesumus omnipotens et misericors Deus&quot;, &quot;Miserere mei, Deus&quot;, &quot;Omnes gentes, plaudite manibus&quot;, &quot;Peccavimus cum patribus nostris&quot;.

Some works only exist in parts or excerpts. For example, it was only after laboriously reconstructing a supposedly missing bass voice part of the anthem &quot;To Father, Son and Holy Ghost&quot; that the editor Vladimir Fedorov discovered the &#x27;missing&#x27; part. Works such as &quot;O God, be merciful unto us&quot; have been revived.

His &quot;In Nomine&quot;s and other instrumental for four or five works survive, some of the earliest examples of chamber music. Nigel Davison, writing in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; suggests that given his reputation as an organist, it would be inconceivable that he composed no keyboard works and concludes that these must have also been lost.

<text>Tathra () is a seaside town on the Sapphire Coast found on the South Coast, New South Wales, Australia. As of the , Tathra had a population of 1,675.

Nearby points of interest are the Old Tathra Wharf, Mimosa Rocks National Park and Bournda National Park. Mimosa Rocks National Park starts at the northern end of Tathra Beach and runs north for about 16 km. It has five access roads from the Tathra-Bermagui main road. Bournda National Park starts at Kianinny Bay, at the southern end of Tathra, and runs south for about . There is a walking track near the coast, along most of its length.

The Bega River flows into the sea at the northern end of Tathra Beach, which is about long.

Tathra is said to mean &quot;beautiful country&quot; or &quot;place of wild cats&quot; in a local Aboriginal dialect.

==History==
The Tathra area lies within the traditional lands of the Djiringanj people, a group of the Yuin. The headland at Tathra is the site of a shell midden, which indicates it was a place favoured by the original inhabitants and a source of food.

Tathra was first settled by Europeans in the 1820s and 1830s, although it was outside the limits of a legal settlement, the Nineteen Counties. After a period of dispossession from much of their lands and coexistence with the settlers in the Bega Valley, the Aboriginal population was removed to the Wallaga Lake Aboriginal Reserve, under the control of the Aborigines Protection Board of New South Wales.

A small jetty was built at Tathra in the early 19th century. In 1861–62, a larger wharf was built from funds donated by farmers and the Illawarra Steam Navigation Company. Regular shipping commenced in 1862. The wharf, built on turpentine supports set into solid rock, was restored by the National Trust, Department of Planning, and local residents. It is the only remaining coastal steamer wharf in NSW.

In 1945, a local Volunteer Fire Brigade was established. In 2011 the Commissioner of the NSW Rural Fire Service opened a new station next to the older Station which had been in place since the early 1970s. In December 2020 the town&#x27;s Fire Station received a major upgrade including the addition of a dedicated training and meeting room which featured the latest in modern technology including video conferencing. Tathra Fire Brigade is now one of the most well-equipped brigades on the Far South Coast and with weekly training, it has also come to be one of the most active brigades.

As with the Fire Brigade, the town also has a Surf Life Saving Club.

In 2008 two children fell from the wharf. Their father jumped in to attempt their rescue, but all three drowned.

On the morning of 3 April 2014, Christine Armstrong, a member of the Tathra Surf Life Saving Club was taken by a shark believed to be approximately long. Armstrong was swimming between Tathra Wharf and the Tathra Beach with a group of friends and her husband Rob. The shark was never located. This attack is believed to be the first attack in around 100 years and is extremely odd as Tathra rarely sees Sharks close to the Bay.

In September 2019, significant repairs were undertaken on the Tathra Wharf in following extensive damage caused by rough ocean conditions

=== 2018 bushfires ===

On 18 March 2018, a bushfire began in the locality of Reedy Swamp, near Tarraganda, which spread east towards Tathra. By the evening the fire had reached the town, destroying homes and blocking one of only two roads out of the town. Around 130 homes were either destroyed or damaged. An emergency evacuation centre for people affected by the fire was set up at the Bega Showgrounds. On 19 March (Monday), multiple schools in the area were closed due to students and staff being affected by the fire, namely Bega High School, Tathra Public School, Tanja Public School and the Bournda Environmental Education Centre. As of 10:40pm on the 18th 1,000 hectares had been burnt. By the morning of 19 March up to 70 buildings were believed to have been lost, and more than 200 people sought shelter at the Bega evacuation centre. On the afternoon of the 19th, the New South Wales Rural Fire Service (RFS) confirmed that 69 homes were destroyed and 39 were damaged, and 398 houses were saved or untouched. The RFS has stated that the total number of buildings destroyed is most likely &#x27;seventy-plus&#x27;. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian, Bega state MP Andrew Constance, federal MP Mike Kelly and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull visited Tathra soon after the fire and met with evacuated people at the Bega Showgrounds.

== Heritage listings ==
Tathra has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Wharf Road: Tathra Wharf

== Transport ==
Tathra Road connects the regional centre of Bega 18 km to the west. Until the early 21st century, Tathra Road was known as the Snowy Mountains Highway, which now runs between Bega and the Hume Highway via Cooma and Tumut.

The Sapphire Coast Drive connects Tathra with Merimbula 25 km to the south and Tathra-Bermagui Road connects to the fishing port of Bermagui 44 km to the north.

Tathra is served by the local Bus Company Sapphire Coast Bus Lines. Sapphire Coast Bus Lines purchased the runs from the Daly family early 2013. The Daly Family operated the Bus Services from 1982 under the name of Tathra Bus Service.

<doc id="661842" wikidata="Q17032519" url="?curid=661842" title="List of Major League Baseball single-game strikeout leaders">
<text>In baseball, a strikeout occurs when a pitcher throws three strikes to a batter during his time at bat. Twenty different pitchers have struck out at least 18 batters in a single nine-inning Major League Baseball (MLB) game, the most recent being Max Scherzer of the Washington Nationals on May 11, 2016. Four players have accomplished the feat more than once in their career; no player has ever struck out more than 20 batters in a nine-inning game. Charlie Sweeney was the first player to strike out 18 batters in a single game, doing so for the Providence Grays against the Boston Beaneaters on June 7, 1884. In spite of this, Bob Feller is viewed as the first pitcher to accomplish the feat, since his then-record 18 strikeouts was the first to occur during the 20th century and the live-ball era.

Out of the twenty pitchers who have accomplished the feat, fifteen were right-handed and five pitched left-handed. Five of these players have played for only one major league team. Six pitchers—Steve Carlton, Roger Clemens, Randy Johnson, Nolan Ryan, Tom Seaver, and Max Scherzer—are also members of the 3,000 strikeout club. Sweeney has the fewest career strikeouts in the group with 505, while Nolan Ryan, with 5,714, struck out more batters than any other pitcher in major league history. Bill Gullickson and Kerry Wood are the only rookies to have achieved the feat. Tom Seaver concluded his milestone game by striking out the final ten batters he faced, setting a new major league record for most consecutive strikeouts.

Of the eleven players eligible for the Baseball Hall of Fame who have struck out 18 batters in a game, six have been elected; all six were elected on the first ballot. Players are eligible for the Hall of Fame if they have played in at least 10 major league seasons, and have either been retired for five seasons or deceased for at least six months.

==Players==


=== MLB pitchers with 18 strikeouts in a nine-inning game ===
===18 strikeouts in extra-inning games===
Eight different pitchers have struck out at least 18 batters in an extra-inning Major League Baseball (MLB) game to date. Only Nolan Ryan accomplished the feat more than once in his career and no player has ever struck out more than 21 batters in a game.

The following list is kept separate from the above list of pitchers who have struck out 18 or more batters in a nine-inning game. This is due to the differing number of innings pitched during an extra-inning game, the lack of a definitive endpoint to the game that would otherwise allow for a fair comparison to be made, and the advantage of having more opportunities to strike out players during an extra-inning game as opposed to one lasting nine innings.

<doc id="661847" wikidata="Q3087900" url="?curid=661847" title="Frisket">
<text>A frisket is any material that protects areas of a work from unintended change.

==Letterpress==
On a sheet-fed letterpress printing machine, a frisket is a sheet of oiled paper that covers the space between the type or &quot;cuts&quot; (illustrations) and the edge of the paper that is to be printed. When the press operator uses a brayer to coat the surface of the type with ink, the ink brayer will often coat the &quot;furniture&quot; and &quot;slugs&quot; (wood and metal spacers) between the columns and around the type. To keep this ink from touching the target sheet, the frisket covers the area that is not desired to print. The frisket is set in a frame, often hinged to the tympan that holds the paper in place.

A new frisket has to be cut for each different page or form; a well-made frisket lasts for hundreds or thousands of impressions.

==Airbrushing==
In airbrushing, a frisket is a plastic sheet with an adhesive backing used to mask off specific areas of an image so that only the exposed area is covered with paint. The frisket is vital to airbrushing, because it allows the artist to control excess paint spray, create special effects, achieve extreme precision, control edge attributes and expedite the airbrushing process.

A frisket differs from other masks in that it is a single sheet that covers the entire work, parts of which are removed by cutting into the sheet. Friskets are available in matté and glossy finishes. Some friskets are also solvent-proof, manufactured for use with solvent-reduced and -based urethanes.

The frisket is fixed to the painting surface and then the appropriate shapes are cut out of the material using a razor or scalpel. The cut piece is lifted, the exposed area painted, and the process repeated using the cut pieces to mask their matching finished areas. When all painting is finished, the resulting work contains precise shapes with no overspray.

==Watercolour==
In watercolor painting, frisket, also sometimes called masking fluid, is a removable liquid masking fluid based on latex and ammonia, often available in various colours to make its presence more obvious, which is applied to the surface in order to mask off the areas that are not to be coloured by a given application of paint. Frisket is usually used when the unmasked areas are desired to be the same colour and a rapid wash is being applied, or for negative painting effects.

Watercolouring frisket is applied using a brush, allowed to dry, and then the watercolour paints are applied and also allowed to dry. Once the paper is completely dry, the frisket can be easily removed by gentle rubbing with a natural crepe rubber pickup, the same as those used for removal of rubber cement. The paper must be completely dry before removing the frisket as the friction can otherwise damage the paper if still damp.

A subsequent application of frisket can be applied to mask other areas—usually those with the intention of applying a different colour or to darken some areas whilst not affecting others—and removed with the natural rubber pickup. This process can be repeated several times without damaging artist-grade watercolour papers, so long as the paper is completely dry after each application of watercolours. Some lesser grades of paper, often used for practice and academic purposes, may be more prone to damage after repeated masking and painting cycles, however. Although watercolour frisket can be removed by rubbing with the fingers, doing so has the disadvantage of potentially transferring skin oils which can discolour the artwork, or otherwise affect subsequent applications of watercolours or other media such as chalk or ink.

<doc id="661849" wikidata="Q382463" url="?curid=661849" title="Government Communications Security Bureau">
<text>The Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) () is the public-service department of New Zealand charged with promoting New Zealand&#x27;s national security by collecting and analysing information of an intelligence nature. The GCSB is considered to be New Zealand&#x27;s most powerful intelligence agency, and has been alleged to have conducted more espionage and data collection than the country&#x27;s primary intelligence agency, the less funded NZSIS. This has at times proven controversial, although the GCSB does not have the baggage of criticism attached to it for a perceived failure to be effective like the NZSIS does. The GCSB is considered an equivalent of GCHQ in the United Kingdom or the NSA in the United States.

According to the Bureau&#x27;s official website, it has a mission of contributing to the national security of New Zealand by providing information assurance and cybersecurity, foreign intelligence, and assistance to other New Zealand government agencies.

==History==
The Government Communications Security Bureau was created in 1977 on the instructions of Robert Muldoon, the Prime Minister. 
Prior to this, the functions now handled by the GCSB were split between three organisations:
*Communications security was the responsibility of the Communications Security Committee, based around the Prime Minister&#x27;s office and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
*Signals intelligence was the responsibility of the Combined Signals Organisation, run by the military.
*Anti-bugging measures were the responsibility of the Security Intelligence Service.

Upon its establishment, the GCSB assumed responsibility for these three roles. Officially, the new organisation was part of the Ministry of Defence, and its functions and activities were highly secreteven Cabinet was not informed. In the 1980s, however, information was gradually released, first about the GCSB&#x27;s security role, and then about its signals intelligence operations.

Also in the 1980s, the GCSB was split away from the Ministry of Defence, becoming a separate organisation. It was not until 2000, however, that it was decided to make the GCSB a government department in its own right. This decision was implemented through the Government Communications Security Bureau Act 2003.

In 2001, the Centre for Critical Infrastructure Protection was formed within the GCSB with a mandate to assist in the protection of national critical infrastructure from information-borne threats. The National Cyber Security Centre was established within the GCSB in September 2011, and it absorbed the functions of the Centre for Critical Infrastructure Protection.

==Staff and budget==
The GCSB is considered to be a government department in its own right with its head office in Pipitea St, Wellington. Through its director, the GCSB reports to the minister holding the Intelligence portfolio, who, by convention, is always the Prime Minister. Its main functions are: the collection and processing of intelligence, the distribution of intelligence, IT security, technology and administration. It has slightly over 400 employees with a range of disciplines including foreign language experts, communications and cryptography specialists, engineers, technicians and support staff.

In 2015/16 the budget for the GCSB was $89.6 million. Former Green MP Keith Locke says that despite the attention the GCSB received as a result of its illegal surveillance of Kim Dotcom, there has been little public discussion about its value. Locke questions GCSB&#x27;s suitability for the task of protecting government computers given its security failures. Cabinet Secretary Rebecca Kitteridge&#x27;s report noted the Bureau&#x27;s problems included &quot;under-resourcing and a lack of legal staff&quot;.

== Oversight ==
An Inspector-General has oversight of the GCSB (and other intelligence organisations). The current Inspector-General is Brendan Horsley, who began his three year term in June 2020. The office of the Inspector-General also consists of Deputy Inspector-General Graeme Speden, and a number of investigating staff. A statutory advisory panel of two members also provides advice to the Inspector-General.

The Prime Minister appoints both the director of the GCSB and the Inspector General. Associate Professor of law at Auckland University, Bill Hodge, says the watchdog should be appointed by Parliament rather than by the Prime Minister. Former prime minister, Sir Geoffrey Palmer agrees: &quot;There needs to be some separation between the inspector and the agency he oversees.&quot;

==Operations==
The functions of the GCSB include signals intelligence, communications security, anti-bugging measures, and computer security. The GCSB does not publicly disclose the nature of the communications which it intercepts. It is frequently described by some authors, such as Nicky Hager, as part of ECHELON. In 2006, after the death of former Prime Minister David Lange, a 1985–86 report given to Lange was found among his papers, having been mistakenly released. The report listed a number of countries as targets of GCSB efforts, including Japan, the Philippines, Argentina, France, Vietnam, and many small Pacific island states. It also mentioned United Nations diplomatic traffic. In his book on the GCSB, Nicky Hager says that during the Cold War, the locations and activities of Soviet ships (including civilian craft such as fishing trawlers) were a major focus of the organisation&#x27;s activities.

For the purposes of its signals intelligence activities, the GCSB maintains two &quot;listening stations&quot;: a satellite communications interception station at GCSB Waihopai near Blenheim and a radio communications interception station at GCSB Tangimoana near Palmerston North. On 16 March 2015, the former National Security Agency contractor and whistleblower Edward Snowden disclosed that New Zealand&#x27;s GCSB agency had a secret listening post, codenamed &quot;Caprica&quot;, at the New Zealand High Commission in Honiara, the capital of the Solomon Islands. The &quot;Caprica&quot; outpost was reportedly modeled after the American National Security Agency&#x27;s Stateroom outposts at selected United States Embassies across the world.

The GCSB is characterised by its focus on foreign intelligence gathering and is unable to collect intelligence on New Zealand citizens. Because of this, the agency is reliant on the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service for domestic intelligence gathering. If the GCSB were to collect data on New Zealanders, this would be in violation of the GCSB Amendment Bill.

=== GCSB strategic plan; 2016–2020 ===
The 2016 - 2020 strategic plan entails what the GCSB is aiming to achieve in the years until 2020. Its two main focuses are; &quot;impenetrable infrastructure&quot; and &quot;indispensable intelligence.&quot; &quot;New Zealand&#x27;s most important information infrastructures are impenetrable to technology-borne compromise. We call this aim impenetrable infrastructure, and New Zealand&#x27;s intelligence generates unique policy and operational impacts for New Zealand. We call this aim indispensable intelligence.&quot; They plan to do this through the set up of eight priority objectives, including recruiting and retaining the best employees, replacing high grade infrastructure and continuing to modernise the GCSB&#x27;s access and tradecraft.

===Waihopai station===
The Waihopai Station has been operating since 1989. It is described as a satellite communications monitoring facility in the Waihopai Valley, near Blenheim. The facility has been identified by MP Keith Locke as part of ECHELON. Few details of the facility are known, but it is believed that it intercepts and processes all phone calls, faxes, e-mails and computer data communications. The site is a regular target for protesters and activists who are attempting to have the base closed down. The Anti-Bases Campaign have had regular yearly protests at the base.

In October 2021, the GCSB announced that Waihopai Station&#x27;s two dishes and radomes would be decommissioned as the technology is obsolete. However, other data collection and information gathering will continue at the station.

===Tangimoana station===
The Tangimoana Station was opened in 1982, replacing an earlier facility at Irirangi, near Waiouru. According to the Federation of American Scientists (FAS), the facility is part of ECHELON; its role in this capacity was first identified publicly by peace researcher Owen Wilkes in 1984, and investigated in detail by peace activist and independent journalist Nicky Hager.

== Notable activities and controversies ==

=== Appointment of Ian Fletcher ===
Ian Fletcher was appointed as director of the GCSB in February 2012. Fletcher is a former diplomat who was interviewed by the appointment panel after an earlier short-list of four candidates had been rejected by the Prime Minister on the recommendation of the State Services Commissioner. In March 2013, John Key admitted he had known Fletcher since they were in school, but denied they were friends.

Answering questions in parliament about Mr Fletcher&#x27;s appointment, Key said he hadn&#x27;t &quot;seen the guy in a long time&quot; and hadn&#x27;t mentioned he had made a phone call to Mr Fletcher when the question first came up in parliament because he had &quot;forgotten&quot; about it. Former GCSB director Sir Bruce Ferguson said the way Key had intervened in the selection process was &quot;disturbing&quot;. The Labour Party called for an inquiry into the matter.

=== Illegal spying ===
Shortly before Fletcher was appointed, the GCSB was found to have illegally spied on Kim Dotcom, a German national but New Zealand resident. By law, the agency cannot spy on New Zealand residents. The GCSB admitted that Hugh Wolfensohn, acting director at the time, knew the organisation was spying on Dotcom. It is believed Mr Wolfensohn was placed on &quot;gardening leave&quot; after it became clear the GCSB had made a mistake in spying on Dotcom. In December, the High Court of New Zealand ruled Kim Dotcom could sue the GCSB for damages. The attorney-general appealed the ruling but was unsuccessful. In March 2013, &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; reported that Wolfensohn &quot;no longer works for the GCSB intelligence agency as it braces for fresh exposure of its failings&quot;.

=== Kitteridge report ===
As a result of the Dotcom saga, a review of the bureau&#x27;s compliance with legislation and its internal systems and processes was conducted by Cabinet Secretary Rebecca Kitteridge. In April 2013, Kitteridge&#x27;s report was leaked to the media. It contradicted GCSB head Ian Fletcher&#x27;s comments that the bureau had not unlawfully spied on anyone other than Dotcom showing that the GCSB may have unlawfully spied on up to 85 people between April 2003 and September 2012.

Fairfax reported &quot;The review noted a series of failings had led to the illegal spying, including under-resourcing and a lack of legal staff.&quot; It found &quot;the GCSB structure was overly complex and top heavy, while staff who performed poorly were tolerated, rather than dismissed or disciplined, so they would not pose a security risk upon leaving the bureau.&quot; The Green Party asked police to investigate the illegal spying.

Kitteridge also said she had trouble accessing a number of &quot;basic files&quot;. Prime Minister John Key said there was no &quot;cover-up&quot;, and the files were probably either misfiled or never existed in the first place.

=== GCSB Amendment Bill ===
On 8 May 2013, the National Prime Minister John Key introduced the Government Communications Security Bureau and Related Legislation Amendment Bill, which would extend the powers of the GCSB to enable it to collect information from all New Zealanders for the use of other government departments including the New Zealand Police, Defence Force and the Security Intelligence Service. Under the bill, the GCSB will have three main functions. Firstly, it will continue to collect foreign intelligence but it will not be allowed to spy on New Zealanders. Secondly, it will give the GCSB a legal mandate to assist the police, Defence Force and the Security Intelligence Service. Thirdly, it will extend the GCSB&#x27;s cyber-security functions to encompass protecting private-sector cyber systems.

While this Bill was supported by the ruling National Party and its coalition partners ACT New Zealand and the United Future MP Peter Dunne, it was opposed by the opposition Labour and the Green parties, several left-wing groups, and the internet millionaire Kim Dotcom, the NZ Law Society, and the Human Rights Tribunal. On 27 July, opponents of the GCSB Amendment Bill staged nationwide protests in eleven major towns and cities, and thousands attended. Critics of the GCSB Amendment Bill claimed that the Bill would turn New Zealand into a police state like the former German Democratic Republic and made references to George Orwell&#x27;s novel &quot;1984&quot; and the ongoing Edward Snowden NSA Leaks scandal. In response, Prime Minister Key acknowledged that the protests were part of a &quot;healthy democracy&quot; with people being &quot;allowed&quot; to make their voices heard for the moment.

On 14 August 2013, the Prime Minister of New Zealand John Key addressed what he identified as &quot;misinformation&quot; surrounding the GCSB Amendment Bill, claiming that the actions of the Government Communications Security Bureau were analogous to Norton AntiVirus. On 21 August, the House of Representatives voted to pass the GCSB Amendment Bill by 61 to 59. The bill passed its third reading despite protests from the opposition parties, human rights groups, legal advocates, and technology groups. John Key defended the GCSB Amendment Bill by arguing that it did not authorise &quot;wholesale spying&quot; on New Zealanders and that its opponents were misinformed.

=== Southern Cross Cable mass surveillance ===
In 2013 the &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot; reported that the owners of the Southern Cross Cable, New Zealand&#x27;s majority (≈95%) international internet access point, had asked the United States National Security Agency (NSA) to pay them for mass surveillance of New Zealand internet activity through the cable. In May 2014, John Minto, vice-president of the New Zealand Mana Party, alleged that the NSA was carrying out mass surveillance on all meta-data and content that went out of New Zealand through the cable.

In August 2014, New Zealand Green Party co-leader Russel Norman stated that an interception point was being established on the Southern Cross Cable. Norman said that as the cable is the only point of telecommunications access from New Zealand, this would allow the Government to spy on all phone calls and internet traffic from New Zealand. Norman&#x27;s claims followed the revelation that an engineer from the NSA had visited New Zealand earlier in the year to discuss how to intercept traffic on the Southern Cross cable. The office of National Party New Zealand Prime Minister John Key denied the claims, but admitted that they were negotiating a &quot;cable access programme&quot; with the NSA, while refusing to clarify what that was or why the NSA was involved.

===2015 Edward Snowden surveillance disclosures===
On 5 March 2015, The Intercept website and &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; newspaper disclosed that the Government Communications Security Bureau had been spying on New Zealand&#x27;s South Pacific neighbours including Tuvalu, Nauru, Kiribati, Samoa, Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, Fiji, Tonga, and the French overseas departments of New Caledonia and French Polynesia. The Intercept provided documents supplied by the US whistleblower Edward Snowden, who had earlier released leaked documents relating to the surveillance activities of other Five Eyes partners including the United States, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. The Snowden documents show that information collected by the GCSB is sent to the American National Security Agency to plug holes in the global intelligence network. Most of the surveillance was carried out from the GCSB&#x27;s Waihopai Station in the South Island. Under the premiership of Prime Minister John Key, the GCSB had expanded its intelligence-gathering activities in support of the Five Eyes.

According to investigative journalist and peace activist Nicky Hager, the GCSB had gone from selective targeting of South Pacific targets to collecting a wide breadth of email messages and telephone calls. He added that the spy agency had upgraded its Waihopai spy base in 2009 to collect both the content and meta-data of all communications, rather than specific individuals and agencies. According to leaked documents supplied by Snowden, the GCSB collected a wide trove of electronic information including emails, mobile and fixed line phone calls, and social media messages from various South Pacific countries. In addition, Snowden alleged that a GCSB officer had also worked with the Australian Signals Directorate to spy on the Indonesian cellphone company Telkomsel.

The GCSB&#x27;s mass surveillance programme was criticised by opposition parties including the Green Party co-leader Russel Norman and the Labour Party leader Andrew Little, who told the press that New Zealand risked damaging its relationship with the South Pacific and that the GCSB&#x27;s actions amounted to an invasion of people&#x27;s privacy. In 2014, New Zealand secured a seat on the United Nations Security Council with the support of the entire Pacific region on the platform that &quot;New Zealand stands up for small states.&quot; The Green Party also laid a complaint with the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, alleging that the GCSB had broken the law by spying on New Zealanders who were holidaying in the South Pacific. In response, Brian Fergurson, a former director of the GCSB, acknowledged that the spy agency did collect emails and other electronic communications but that it did not use material about New Zealanders captured inadvertently.

The Tongan Prime Minister ʻAkilisi Pohiva has denounced New Zealand&#x27;s espionage activities as a &quot;breach of trust.&quot; He also expressed concerns about similar surveillance activities carried out by China. The Samoan Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sa&#x27;ilele has by contrast dismissed allegations of New Zealand espionage against Samoa, commenting that &quot;it would be far fetched to think that a spy agency in any country would waste their resources doing that kind of thing to Samoa.&quot; In response to these disclosures, Prime Minister John Key issued a statement on 5 March 2015 saying that he would &quot;neither confirm nor deny&quot; whether New Zealand&#x27;s spy agencies were spying on the South Pacific. Key had earlier acknowledged that New Zealand was a member of the Five Eyes club, which included the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, during a speech calling for New Zealand to deploy troops to Iraq to combat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.

On 11 March 2015, Edward Snowden disclosed that the Government Communications Security Bureau was also using the Waihopai Station to intercept transmissions from several Pacific Rim and Asian countries including Vietnam, China, India, Pakistan, and several unspecified South American nations. He added that the GCSB was helping the National Security Agency to fill gaps in its world surveillance data collection. In response to Snowden&#x27;s disclosures, Una Jagose, the Acting-Director of the GCSB issued a statement that the spy agency was collecting less information than it was seven years ago during a session of the New Zealand Parliament&#x27;s Intelligence and Security Committee. According to the GCSB&#x27;s latest annual report, the volume of phone and electronic surveillance carried out on New Zealanders surged throughout 2014. On 13 March 2015, the Fijian military commander Brigadier-General Mosese Tikoitoga confirmed that the Fijian Military Forces were aware of the GCSB&#x27;s intelligence-gathering activities in Fiji.

On 15 March 2015, the journalists Nicky Hager and Ryan Gallagher reported in the &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot; that the GCSB was using the NSA&#x27;s internet mass surveillance system XKeyscore to intercept email communications from several leading Solomon Islands government ministers, the Solomons Islands Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and the Solomons anti-corruption campaigner Benjamin Afuga. In response, the New Zealand Minister of Foreign Affairs Murray McCully downplayed reports of the spying disclosures by asserting that Pacific Islands ministers &quot;were smart enough not to believe what they read in New Zealand newspapers.&quot; He also offered to discuss their concerns about the mass surveillance programme in private. The Solomons Chief of Staff, Robert Iroga, has condemned the New Zealand Government&#x27;s actions for damaging New Zealand&#x27;s image as a &quot;friendly government&quot; in the South Pacific. He added that communications within the inner circle of the Solomons Government was &quot;highly secret information&quot; that rightfully belong to the Solomon Islanders.

On 16 March 2015, Snowden released more documents which revealed that the GCSB had a secret listening post, codenamed &quot;Caprica&quot;, at the New Zealand High Commission in the Solomon Islands capital of Honiara. The &quot;Caprica&quot; outpost was reportedly modeled after the NSA&#x27;s Stateroom outposts at selected United States Embassies across the world. On 22 March 2015, The Intercept released a new document which showed that the GCSB had monitored the email and internet communications of several foreign diplomats vying for the position of Director-General of the World Trade Organization. This surveillance was carried out on behalf of the New Zealand Trade Minister Tim Groser, who was also competing for that position. Known targets included candidates from Brazil, Costa Rica, Ghana, Jordan, Indonesia, Kenya, Mexico, and South Korea. Ultimately, Groser&#x27;s candidature was unsuccessful and the Brazilian diplomat Roberto Azevêdo was elected as the Director General of the WTO in May 2013. In response to these disclosures, Sergio Danese, the Secretary-General of the Brazilian Ministry of External Relations summoned the New Zealand Ambassador Caroline Bilkey to explain the actions of her government.

On 26 March 2015, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Cheryl Gywn announced that she would lead an inquiry into the allegations that the GCSB had spied on New Zealanders working in the Pacific. Prime Minister John Key has welcomed this inquiry. On 16 April 2015, The Intercept and &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot; disclosed that the GCSB had been both spying on and sharing intelligence with the Bangladesh government, using a leaked National Security Agency document entitled &quot;NSA Intelligence Relationship with New Zealand.&quot; The Bangladeshi security forces have been implicated in various human rights abuses including extrajudicial killings and torture. The New Zealand Government has refused to respond to these disclosures but opposition parties have criticised the GCSB for cooperating with Bangladeshi security forces.

On 19 April 2015, The Intercept and the &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot; revealed that the GCSB and the National Security Agency had worked together to tap into a data link between the Chinese Consulate-General and the Chinese Visa Office in Auckland, New Zealand&#x27;s largest city. According to a leaked secret report entitled &quot;NSA activities in progress 2013&quot;, the GCSB was providing additional technical data on the data link to the NSA&#x27;s &quot;Tailored Accessed Operations&quot;, a powerful system that hacks into computer systems and networks to intercept communications. Other leaked documents also indicated that the GCSB codenamed their Auckland tapping operation &quot;Frostbite&quot; while their American counterparts called it &quot;Basilhayden&quot;, after a Kentucky bourbon that was once regarded as the fictional spy James Bond&#x27;s favourite alcoholic beverage. In response, a Chinese Embassy spokesman told the &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot; that China was concerned about the report and attached great importance to the cybersecurity issue.

On 5 May 2015, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet acknowledged that Snowden&#x27;s leaked documents on the GCSB and NSA were authentic but accused Snowden&#x27;s associates, particularly the journalist Glenn Greenwald, of &quot;misrepresenting, misinterpreting, and misunderstanding&quot; the leaked information.

===2018–2019 Huawei ban===
In late November 2018, the Government Communications Security Bureau prevented national telecommunications provider Spark New Zealand from using Chinese telecommunication giant Huawei&#x27;s equipment in its 5G mobile tower expansion, with the agency&#x27;s Director-General Andrew Hampton citing &quot;a significant network security risk.&quot; New Zealand&#x27;s decision to ban Huawei from its 5G expansion programme accompanied moves by several Western governments including the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia to exclude Huawei from participating in their 5G mobile network expansion programs as well as the ongoing China-United States trade war.

===2019 Christchurch mosque shootings===
Following the Christchurch mosque shootings in March 2019, the GCSB assembled a 24-hour operation response team which worked with domestic agencies and foreign partners to support the New Zealand Police and its domestic intelligence counterpart, the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service. In December 2020, a Royal Commission of Inquiry into the mosque shootings criticised the GCSB and other security services and intelligence agencies for focusing on Islamic extremism at the expense of other threats including White supremacy.

In response to the Royal Commission, the GCSB&#x27;s Director-General Andrew Hampton stated that the agency was committed to making its role and capabilities &quot;more widely understood and utilised by domestic partner agencies&quot;. Hampton also claimed that the GCSB did not distinguish between different forms of violent extremism &quot;before and after&quot; the Christchurch attacks and vowed to support national and global efforts against the &quot;full spectrum of violent extremism.&quot;

===2021 Chinese cyber attacks===
On 20 July 2021, the Minister in charge of GCSB Andrew Little confirmed that the spy agency had established links between Chinese state-sponsored actors known as &quot;Advanced Persistent Threat 40&quot; (APT40) and malicious cyber activity in New Zealand. In addition, Little confirmed that New Zealand was joining other Western governments including the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and the European Union in condemning the Chinese Ministry of State Security and other Chinese state-sponsored actors for their involvement in the 2021 Microsoft Exchange Server data breach. In response, the Chinese Embassy in New Zealand described the New Zealand Government&#x27;s statement as &quot;groundless and irresponsible&quot; and lodged a &quot;solemn representation&quot; with the New Zealand Government. The Embassy claimed that China was a staunch defender of cybersecurity and firmly opposed all forms of cyber attacks and crimes.

On 21 July, Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta confirmed that New Zealand Foreign Ministry officials had met with Chinese Embassy officials at the request of the Chinese Embassy in response to the cyber attack allegations. The Embassy urged the New Zealand Government to abandon its so-called &quot;Cold War mentality.&quot; New Zealand exporters have expressed concerns that an escalation of diplomatic tensions could affect Sino-New Zealand trade.

In late March 2024 the GCSB&#x27;s Director-General Andrew Clark confirmed that the Chinese-sponsored hacker group APT40 had attempted to breach the New Zealand Parliamentary Service and the Parliamentary Council Office&#x27;s computer systems in 2021. In response, GCSB Minister Judith Collins, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Foreign Minister Winston Peters issued statements criticising the attempted cyber attacks. In response, a Chinese Embassy spokesperson dismissed the complaint as &quot;groundless and irresponsible accusations&quot; and confirmed it would lodge a complaint with New Zealand officials. Reports of the data hack accompanied reports that the United States, British and Australian governments had sanctioned APT40 for similar activities in their countries.

===Counterterrorism===
On 27 March 2023, Director-General Andrew Hampton confirmed during a meeting of Parliament&#x27;s Intelligence and Security Committee that the GCSB in cooperation with other agencies had foiled three potential terror attacks. These incidents included a person making bomb threats in 2022 with &quot;an implied ideological motivation&quot;, a New Zealand White identity adherent&#x27;s concerning online behaviour, and another White identity extremist making threats to use firearms and explosives at a public event.

===Hosting of foreign agency intelligence capabilities===
On 21 March 2024, the Inspector-General released a report detailing how the GCSB hosted a foreign agency&#x27;s signal intelligence capability that could be used to support &quot;military operations by foreign partners&quot; during the years 2013 to 2020, without advising any government ministers. The report found fault with the initial process of agreeing to host the capability, as well as a lack of operational oversight during the period of its operation. Former prime minister – and former minister for the GCSB in the years 2003 to 2008 – Helen Clark, suggested that disciplinary action would be appropriate for GCSB staff that signed off on the capability

<doc id="661863" wikidata="Q1724007" url="?curid=661863" title="Kantianism">
<text>Kantianism () is the philosophy of Immanuel Kant, a German philosopher born in Königsberg, Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia). The term &quot;Kantianism&quot; or &quot;Kantian&quot; is sometimes also used to describe contemporary positions in philosophy of mind, epistemology, and ethics.

== Ethics ==

Kantian ethics is deontological, revolving entirely around duty rather than emotions or end goals. All actions are performed in accordance with some underlying maxim or principle, which are vastly different from each other; it is according to this that the moral worth of any action is judged. Kant&#x27;s ethics are founded on his view of rationality as the ultimate good and his belief that all people are fundamentally rational beings. This led to the most important part of Kant&#x27;s ethics, the formulation of the categorical imperative, which is the criterion for whether a maxim is good or bad.

Simply put, this criterion amounts to a thought experiment: to attempt to universalize the maxim (by imagining a world where all people necessarily acted in this way in the relevant circumstances) and then see if the maxim and its associated action would still be conceivable in such a world. For instance, holding the maxim &quot;kill anyone who annoys you&quot; and applying it universally would result in self termination. Thus holding this maxim is irrational as it ends up being impossible to hold it.

Universalizing a maxim (statement) leads to it being valid, or to one of two contradictions—a contradiction in conception (where the maxim, when universalized, is no longer a viable means to the end) or a contradiction in will (where the will of a person contradicts what the universalisation of the maxim implies). The first type leads to a &quot;perfect duty&quot;, and the second leads to an &quot;imperfect duty&quot;.

Kant&#x27;s ethics focus, then, only on the maxim that underlies actions, and judges these to be good or bad solely on how they conform to reason. Kant showed that many of our common sense views of what is good or bad conform to his system, but denied that any action performed for reasons other than rational actions can be good (saving someone who is drowning simply out of a great pity for them is not a morally good act). Kant also denied that the consequences of an act in any way contribute to the moral worth of that act—his reasoning being (highly simplified for brevity) that the physical world is outside our full control, and thus we cannot be held accountable for the events that occur in it.

The formulations of the categorical imperative:

# Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.
# Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end.
#Therefore, every rational being must so act as if he were, through his maxim, always a legislating member in the universal kingdom of ends.

==Political philosophy==

In political philosophy, Kant has had wide and increasing influence with major political philosophers of the late twentieth century. For example, John Rawls drew heavily on his inspiration in setting out the basis for a liberal view of political institutions. The nature of Rawls&#x27; use of Kant has engendered serious controversy but has demonstrated the vitality of Kantian considerations across a wider range of questions than was once thought plausible.

<doc id="661864" wikidata="Q7388176" url="?curid=661864" title="S11 (protest)">
<text>S11 refers to a series of protests against meetings of the World Economic Forum on 11, 12 and 13 September 2000 in Melbourne, Australia, where approximately 10,000 people of many ages and a wide cross section of the community were involved. One of the groups involved in the protests called itself the S11 Alliance. This group was dominated by various socialist parties. The success of the protest led them to the creation of the M1 Alliance on 1 November 2000 in preparation for the next year&#x27;s May Day events and the S26 Alliance, in solidarity with protest against the International Monetary Fund/World Bank meetings in Prague (26 September 2000). The other main organising network for the protest was the autonomist &amp; anarchist s11 AWOL.

The protest was part of the anti-globalisation movement, and closely modeled after the 1999 WTO protests in Seattle (known as the battle for Seattle.) This movement has been motivated by a number of concerns about globalization, including loss of national sovereignty, environmental impact, and the impact of foreign debt and multi-national corporations on third world countries.

The protest was notable as the first major anti-globalization action to take place in Australia. As with previous events in other parts of the world, the event was characterized by civil disobedience and often festive direct action, and by an aggressive police response. Protesters linked arms and some chained themselves together in an effort to prevent delegates from getting into the meetings. The police reportedly responded with pepper spray (which in Victoria is not permitted to be used by police at demonstrations), and Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand MP Nándor Tánczos reported that he and other protesters were victims of police brutality.

==Police response==

During the S11 protests there was a significant media presence, and some reporters and photographers were attacked by police during their attempts to break up the protest. This resulted in a higher degree of reporting than that which normally occurs at similar protests, and a large amount of photographic and video evidence of the event was available. In a report regarding the police response, the Ombudsman&#x27;s Report stated &quot;It was obvious that the event had been one of the most photographed events in recent memory and there was likely to be a great deal of video footage.&quot;

* The majority of the police removed their name tags, a contravention of Victoria Police Operating Procedures. This prevented individual police from being identified in later hearings regarding police actions.
* Video footage showed punches and overhead baton strikes being used against the demonstrators, and several were stomped or kicked while upon the ground and/or dragged by their hair. Several demonstrators were struck without warning while not engaged in violent activity. These were all violations of police procedures.
* During a &quot;baton charge&quot;, police struck camera operators from the Seven Network and SBS while they were filming. This footage was shown on the respective stations. Photographers from &quot;The Age&quot; and &quot;Herald Sun&quot; newspapers claimed that their camera equipment was removed from them and smashed by police during the charge.
* A woman was run over by an unmarked police car with uniformed officers inside. The protesters claimed that the car was stationary until it suddenly accelerated over the woman and sped off. Police claimed that the protesters surrounded a moving car and were rocking and damaging it. However, the footage taken by a nearby camera crew clearly bore out the protesters&#x27; version of events.

The 40 person Legal Observer Team present over the three days made two conclusions in its report published after the event:

1) It is the conclusion of the Pt&#x27;chang Legal Observer Team, that, in the almost complete absence of police attempts to arrest individual protesters who broke the law, individual police officers were taking opportunities afforded by the chaotic nature of the event, crowd numbers, isolation or the lack of accountability to senior police, and effectively meting out their own &quot;summary&quot;, extra judicial punishment to individual protestors. Buoyed by, and perhaps made fearful by the media generated myths of &quot;violent S11 protestors&quot; and briefed by their commanding officers of much the same, some police officers were able to take full advantage of every opportunity to assault, intimidate and harass individual protesters whilst on duty.

2) The Legal Observer Team strongly asserts that the Victorian Police command decisions to deploy the level of force observed during these attempts to clear access points was both entirely unjustified and unprovoked and poorly and dangerously executed. The decision to use the fully equipped Force Response Unit, with full body and face protection, and lines of mounted police to
carry out a simple objective of clearing an access point stands out as particularly unjustified when a procedure of arresting people engaged in unlawful obstruction could have been implemented with no injuries to people and nor threat towards individual police. It is the conclusion of the Legal Observer Team that the use of batons, surprise formation charges and the use of containment lines of mounted police a) was potentially lethal and resulted in an incredibly high level of serious personal injuries amongst protestors present at these incidents; and b) served to create a highly emotive, dangerous and provocative climate during and immediately after each manoeuvre.

<text>Hof () is a town on the banks of the Saale in the northeastern corner of the German state of Bavaria, in the Franconian region, at the Czech border and the forested Fichtel Mountains and Franconian Forest upland regions.
The town has 47,296 inhabitants, the surrounding district an additional 95,000.

The town of Hof is enclosed by, but does not belong to the Bavarian district of Hof; it is nonetheless the district&#x27;s administrative seat.

The town&#x27;s most important work of art, the Hofer altar, dates from about 1465 and is exhibited in the Alte Pinakothek in Munich today. The Heidenreich organ in the parish church of St. Michaelis, completed in 1834, is considered one of Bavaria&#x27;s finest.

Hof is known for two local &quot;delicacies&quot;, namely , a kind of hotpot, and sausages boiled in a portable, coal-fired brass cauldron, which are sold in the streets by the &quot;sausage man&quot; ( in the local dialect). There is also a particularly strong beer (), which is available only on the first Monday after Trinity Sunday (&quot;Schlappentag&quot;). This tradition dates back to the establishment of the town militia which forced all shooters to take part in a special shooting training each year. To avoid penalties, a lot of shooters rushed out to the training area in the morning of the last possible day, without even enough time to get dressed and thus still wearing their clogs ().

The Hof Theatre (Theater Hof) is a multi-purpose theatre whose construction was completed in 1994. It serves as an opera house and drama theatre, and hosts the city&#x27;s ballet company and a youth theatre. The Hofer Symphoniker, Hof&#x27;s symphony orchestra, plays as opera orchestra at the theatre and gives concerts at the Freiheitshalle Hof.

== History ==
=== Roman period ===
Hof in the Middle Ages was located in the Provincia Variscorum and was known in Latin as or meaning &quot;Court of the Varisci/Narisci.&quot; It is assumed then that Hof was the place where the chief(s) of the Varisci (or Narisci) tribe of the Suebi people held court (and/or perhaps a pagan temple or hall). The Varisci appear briefly in Tacitus&#x27; Germania (Chapter 42) as participants in the Marcomannic Wars. Their chief, Valao, was killed during battle around 167 AD and it is possible that these ancient peoples were then transplanted to Italy by Marcus Aurelius and lost their identity. A few centuries later (4th or 5th century) the obscure Armalausi peoples appear where the Varisci once lived, however the Latin name of stuck to the region. This is evidenced by nearby Plauen being called Plavia Variscorum and Hof: Curia Variscorum. The name has been used to denote the city of Hof in numerous documents and publications throughout the years. This legacy remains even to this day as the word is German for &#x27;court&#x27;, just as is Latin for &#x27;court&#x27;.

=== Sorbish-Frankish Conflicts (c. 600 – 1080) ===
Sometime around the 6th century AD the Slavic Sorbs began arriving near the Saale River which runs through Hof. They are first mentioned in 631 A.D., when Fredegar’s Chronicle described them as &quot;Surbi&quot; and as under the rule of a Dervan, an ally of Samo. The Frankish Kingdom of Charlemagne and his descendants were determined to Christianize the pagan Slavs and various campaigns were waged against them. The Annales Regni Francorum state that in 806 A.D. Sorbian Duke Miliduch fought against the Franks and was killed by Charles the Younger the son of Charlemagne around nearby modern-day Weißenfels.

The region where Hof is located first came under the ecclesiastic control of the Dioceses of Würzburg during this time period. Then in 1007 the region which contains Hof came under the Bishopric of Bamberg which was established out of the Dioceses of Würzburg to further spread Christianity throughout this area.

While the area around Hof remained terra incognita during this time period it was not isolated from the rest of the world. Although not home to a king or prince, Hof was on located on a somewhat protected, and very important trade route; the Via Imperii. This route led from Italy to the Baltic Sea and Hof was well situated to be a place of rest for travelers and traders as the flourishing markets of Leipzig, Zwickau, and Nuremberg began to develop. The budding mining industry of silver and tin from the nearby Ore Mountains would also contribute to the development of trade in this region.

=== Andechs-Merania and Vögte of Weida (1080–1373) ===
It appears that the missionary efforts of Bamberg were fairly successful in Hof as sometime around 1080 a group of farmers (possibly Sorbish) settled parts of modern-day Hof had built a chapel on Klausenberg an der Saale. They called their settlement &quot;Rekkenze&quot; which appears to be derived from the Western Slavic word meaning &quot;river.&quot; Rekkenze was first mentioned in a document written by one Pastor Albertus of St. Lorenzkirche in 1214 to the Bishop of Bamberg.

The Slavic language has left many marks on the geography of this region and to this day there are two waterways known as &quot;Regnitz&quot; near Hof: the Upper/Southern Regnitz (which flows in the south of Hof on the east side of the Saale River) and the Lower/Northern Regnitz (which flows in the north and east side of the Saale). Also of note, the area around Hof, the southern Bavarian-Bohemian part of the Vogtland, was known as the Regnitzland.

====Rekkenze and other historic names of Hof====
This Rekkenze settlement, which later became Hof, went by this and many other names through the years. For example, Hof is also called &quot;curia Reckenize&quot; (court of Reckenize) and &quot;schlosz Reckenitz&quot; (Castle Reckenitz) in a document of the in the year 1276. It has been suggested that the name &quot;Hof&quot; is the shortened form of meaning &quot;City on the Court at the Regnitz&quot;. Other names for Hof have included: (Variscorum), , , , , , , , and to name but a few.

==== House of Andechs-Merania ====
In 1098 Count Berthold II of Andechs inherited his father&#x27;s lands including those in modern-day Upper Franconia. In the 1130s he built Plassenburg Castle in Kulmbach and from 1137 he styled himself as &#x27;Count of Plassenburg&quot;. He thus strengthened his influence in and around the nearby Regnitzland.

Around 1230, Count Berthold&#x27;s great-grandson, the Crusader Duke Otto I von Andechs-Merania fortified the area north of the Rekkenze farming settlement () at the area downstream now known as (New City).

==== Vögte of Weida ====

By 1248 the royal house of Andechs-Merania dies out with Duke Otto II. Soon after the Vögte of Weida acquired the Regnitzland including Hof. Vogt Henry VIII of Weida (1258–1279) earned the city of Hof and Regnitzland. He was married to Sophie, daughter of Count Hermann II of Orlamünde and Beatrix of Andechs-Merania (daughter of Count Otto I).

Under the guidance of the Vögte of Weida the first city wall and the foundation of the poor hospital (Armenspitals) were built (). Also, in 1270 there is the first mention of a castle at Hof and in 1278 the beginnings of the Klarissenkloster was established under the aid of the Vogt. The convent was blessed by the first Franciscan Pope Nicholas IV in 1291 and came under the Franciscan Monastery of the Holy Cross in 1292.

In 1299 75% of the city (both Old and New Hof) was destroyed by a fire and the population was left destitute. It took over 30 years to rebuild Hof, however during the rebuilding process (1319) the Vogt Heinrich XII the Younger (der Jüngere) of Weida (1302–1324) confirmed traditional rights and privileges upon the City of Hof. These rights officially made Hof a city.

In 1373, Vogt Heinrich XVI of Weida sold the Regnitzland to Burgrave Friedrich V of Nürnberg. However, due to this early history with the Vögte of Weida, Hof is still considered part of the geographical region known as the Vogtland. To this day the (Shield) of Hof has the lion of the Vögte emblazoned in remembrance of the fact it was once owned by the Vögte. The name of the Museum Bayerisches Vogtland in Hof today also pays homage to this history.

=== Brandenburg period (1373–1792) ===
Burgrave Friedrich V died on January 21, 1398, and his lands were split between his two sons, Johann III and Friedrich IV, thus creating what has been called the Principality of Bayreuth. Hof was under this Hohenzollern Principality until December 2, 1791, and during this time was known as the (the &quot;Princely Brandenburg capital city of Hof in the Vogtland&quot;).

==== Hussite Wars (1419–1434) ====
Close to the end of the Hussite Wars (between the 4th and 5th Crusade against them) Hof was sacked by the Hussite followers of Jan Hus. In 1430, during the period the Hussites called the Spanilé jízdy (or &quot;beautiful rides&quot;) they raided and devastated the city of Hof. on 25 January they burnt Plauen and then turned their attention to Hof. From the end of January into February they attacked and finally broke through killing many Hofers and looted and burned Hof. They also took away inhabitants of Hof as booty.

==== Rebuilding of Hof ====
In 1432 a militia was organized to defend Hof. The organization of this Shooter&#x27;s Guild is still celebrated in Hof annually in festival called Schlappentag [see description above].

in 1464 the Hospital and Hospital Church (Hospitalkirche) were rebuilt.

1487 a foundation in Niclaskirche for pilgrims on the Jacobsweg was built near the modern day St. Marienkirche. Jacobsweg is part of the famous Camino de Santiago which ends in at Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in Galicia, Spain. There is a plaque on the wall of Marienkirche that commemorates this pilgrim inn that is now lost.

In 1498 a watch tower was constructed to add to the defenses of Hof.

==== Reformation ====

While 1517 brought the 95 Theses, the spark that ignited the Protestant Reformation, in Hof 1517 sparked a terrible fire that destroyed some 50 homes around the Orlaplatz and St. Michaeliskirche, severely damaging the rectory. The various churches and chapels in Hof at this time were all under the head pastor () of Hof, Margrave Friedrich von Brandenburg of the Hohenzollern family. This family often fought amongst themselves during the reformation using religion to gain political power. Friedrich tended to side with the Catholic Church against his brother George &quot;the Pious&quot; who used the new Protestant religion to his advantage.

In 1524, a reforming priest named Kaspar Löhner was reassigned from his preaching position at Kloster Birkenfeld, after complaints from the Abbess, and brought to Hof under Head Pastor Friedrich v. Brandenburg. Löhner had been performing Mass in German and singing German songs during the Mass. He arrived in Hof where his preaching continued to carry a certain reformation flavor. This is understandable given that he was a friend of Martin Luther who had accompanied him from Wittenberg and Augsburg in 1518.

Soon after Löhner arrived in Hof the radical lay-preacher from Zwickau, Nikolaus Storch, also arrived in Hof. According to the Hof chronicler Enoch Widmann, Storch was in Hof at the end of 1524 working as a weaver, but still preaching and gaining followers. Previously a co-worker with Thomas Müntzer, Storch is also considered a forerunner of the Anabaptist movement, because Widmann recorded him as having preached and practiced adult baptism in Hof. This was opposed by Löhner and others in Hof and towards the end of January in 1525 he applied to the mayor of Zwickau to be allowed to return there. This was refused and according to Philip Melancthon (letter to Joachim Camerarius, 17 April 1525) Storch played a leading role in the Peasants War of 1525.

Löhner&#x27;s first stay in Hof was also short-lived and Head Pastor Friedrich von Brandenburg had him removed the year after he arrived (1525) and he was replaced by the Catholic priest Wolfgang Thech. On Easter of 1527 Thech had his beard and hair purposely set on fire by young men while he was impersonating Christ in a Harrowing of Hell re-enactment. Believing they had been taught to disrespect the priesthood by men like Löhner, Thech left Hof for Halle an der Saale.
After time in Wittenberg (1526) and then Oelzntiz (1527) Löhner was then reinstated in 1528 in Hof by Friedrich&#x27;s Lutheran brother the Margrave George the Pious. Löhner then returned to Hof in league with the Hof born theologian, mathematician, and school master Nikolaus Medler (who was also a student of Luther&#x27;s). Together they more boldly introduced the Reformation. The first Evangelical (Lutheran) communion service in Hof was held by Löhner at St. Michaeliskirche on September 5, 1529. This public act marks a major turning point in which Hof began to assert itself as openly Lutheran against the jurisdiction of the Catholic Church. However, Löhner and Medler continued to face stiff opposition to these changes as their subsequent removal from Hof reveals.

Pastor Kaspar Löhner was a leading theologian and writer in his day and he wrote a church liturgy (), catechism, and a hymnal among other writings. While in Hof he married Margarethe Felitscher, daughter of the Mayor (Bürgermeister) of Hof Konrad Felitscher, and by which he became the father of John Joshua Löner and the great-grandfather of the famous Lutheran theologian and hymn writer Joshua Stegmann.

Löhner and Medler both continued to receive opposition from powerful individuals including the regional governor () Christoph von Beulwitz who was a supporter of the Bishop of Bamberg. Being acquainted with Martin Luther, both Pastor Löhner and Schoolmaster Medler asked him for advice concerning this opposition and received a letter from Luther addressed from Wittenberg on June 7, 1531, which encouraged them to stay. The letter begins:

However, the next month (13 July 1531) both Löhner and Medler were ousted from Hof. This is due to the fact that even though George the Pious was actively trying to introduce Protestantism into his lands, he was constantly opposed by his brother Friedrich who held numerous benefices in Hof. Also still holding great influence and power in and around Hof was the Bishop of Bamberg Weigand von Redwitz. These two were able to somewhat curb the influence of Margrave George the Pious and the reformers.

However, the next year, in 1532, George the Pious was able to obtain the famous theologian and reformer Stephan Agricola and assign him to St. Michaeliskirche in Hof. Also during the year 1532 there was public shock throughout Hof as a local noblewoman who had become a nun (Veronika von Zedtwitz) left the Poor Clares&#x27; cloister in Hof and broke her vows to marry the rector of the Gymnasium in Hof, Conrad Meyer. Pastor Agricola continued his influential ministry in Hof until 1542 and during his time as Hof&#x27;s pastor he was present at the meeting of Lutheran theologians at Schmalkalden in 1537 and was a signer of the Schmalkaldic Articles written by Martin Luther.

It was during this time period that the Catholic population in Hof became severely limited, although it held on for a few more decades. In 1538 the Sigmundskirche was demolished and the St. Gangolf church was sold (and was later burned down and turned into barns). After the Franciscan monastery was abolished in Hof in 1564, Catholicism did not really regain ground in the city again until after Catholic Bavaria purchased Franconia in 1810. It wasn&#x27;t until 1837 that the Catholic population of Hof received their own priest and 1844 until a small church was built (Marienkirche).

==== Margrave Albert Alcibiades ====

In 1546, Margrave Albert Alcibiades of Brandenburg-Kulmbach founded a Grammar School in Hof, which is today known as the Jean-Paul Gymnasium, in honor of the most famous student that attended there: Jean Paul Friedrich Richter. Jean-Paul Gymnasium is one of the oldest schools in Upper Franconia.

===== Siege of Hof =====
On August 7, 1553, Hof came under a 7-week siege known as the Siege of Hof. The siege was one of the major battles of the Second Margrave War and Hof was finally taken from Margrave Albert Alcibiades by Heinrich IV of Plauen on September 28, 1553. Albert was able to briefly retake Hof on October 11, but it fell back into the hands of those allied against Margrave Albert on November 27. Some 18,236 stone cannonballs are said to have been shot into Hof during this siege with some cannonballs still visible today lodged in walls throughout Hof. For example, from the Saale River looking back one can still see a cannonball lodged in one of the towers of St. Michaeliskirche from the siege of 1553.

Aftermath: St. Lorenzkirche was looted and burned during the siege and the old Watch Tower was also burned out. The Hospitalkirche, which was used as a war camp by the attackers, was attacked and destroyed by the city&#x27;s defenders. Also, the end of the last Roman Catholic stronghold in Hof; occurred during this siege as Abbess Amalie of Hirschberg escaped with her nuns to Cheb (Eger). The Cloister was looted and later turned into a school. After the siege, Henry IV briefly put Georg Wolf of Kotzau (who had once served Margrave Albert) in charge of the governance of Hof. Finally, Albert&#x27;s cousin, Margrave Jürgen Friedrich of Brandenburg-Ansbach (reign of 1557–1603) took power and ruled over Hof and rebuilt it along with much of his Margraviate which had been ransacked during the war.

The noted artist Hans Glaser made a woodcut of the siege of Hof which is located in today in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nürnberg.

==== Thirty Years War (1618–1648) ====
===== Regional Prelude: Brandenburg-Ansbach to Brandenburg-Bayreuth =====
After the death of the childless Margrave Jürgen Friedrich of Brandenburg-Ansbach in 1603, his margraviate was given to Karsten, the son of Elector Johann Jürgen of Brandenburg. This was done in accordance with House Treaty of Gera set in place in 1599 to provide for a peaceful transition of power to the heirless Jürgen Friedrich.
Margrave Karsten took power over Brandenburg-Ansbach after Jürgen Friedrich’s death in 1603. In 1604, he moved his capital from Kulmbach to Bayreuth, thus changing the name of the margraviate to Brandenburg-Bayreuth. This Margraviate had been a member of the Franconian Circle since 1500 and Margrave Karsten was elected Colonel () of the Franconian Circle in 1606. He was also one of the founding members of the Protestant Union founded in 1608 as a way of giving teeth to the Peace of Augsburg (1555). Karsten was Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth which oversaw the governance of Hof when the 30 Years War broke out ten years later in 1618.

===== Fire of 1625 =====
On November 6 a fire broke out in Hof that destroyed 174 houses. Hof was again left destitute and it took 40 years before widespread re-construction could be financed. During this time period Hof was left vulnerable, especially to the pillaging of the mercenary Heinrich Holk&#x27;s notorious cavalry unit, &quot;Holk&#x27;s Horse&quot; (see below).
===== Heinrich Holk&#x27;s Raids =====
In 1632 and 33 Heinrich Holk&#x27;s cavalry unit of Croatian and Polish forces ravaged the surrounding region (especially the neighboring Electorate of Saxony). On 23 Jan 1633, 8 companies of Holk&#x27;s Horse plundered Hof. The raiding, raping, looting, and destruction continued also in later raids on June 13 and August 11 of the same year. Fortunately for the distraught citizens of Hof Heinrich Holk&#x27;s forces were politically stymied after the Battle of Lützen on November 16.

===== Margrave Karsten in the war and aftermath =====
During the war, Margrave Karsten formed an alliance with Sweden, although the Swedes sacked Hof on 29 May 1640. Emperor Ferdinand II tried to depose him as ruler of Bayreuth in 1635; however, he continued in office. All of Europe was deeply affected by these wars. Disease, starvation, and warfare took a terrible toll on infrastructure, livestock, farmlands, and human dignity. After the 30 Years War it is estimated that one half of the population of Brandenburg was lost and in some areas as many as two-thirds. One can only imagine the joy when the wars ended and Margrave Karsten called a general festival of thanksgiving for peace which was celebrated throughout his Principality in February 1639. Hof seems to have recovered quickly under Margrave Karsten and it became a refuge for displaced Protestants, especially from Austria and Bohemia.

==== Postal link ====
In 1683 Hof became a link in the postal service between Leipzig and Nuremberg. The post came through twice a week. Postal links to Regensburg (1692) and to Dresden (1693) followed.

==== Fire of 1743 ====
In 1743 the Hof Castle burned down and was not rebuilt, although several walls of the castle are still visible in modern-day Hof.

=== Prussian rule (1791–1805) ===
Hof came under Prussian rule on December 2, 1791, when Margrave Karl Alexander, the last Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach and Brandenburg-Bayreuth, sold it to King Friedrich Wilhelm II of Prussia, a fellow member of the House Hohenzollern.

=== Napoleonic Conflicts (1805–1810) ===
On 3 November 1805 the Prussians had signed the Treaty of Potsdam, agreeing to enter the War of the Third Coalition against Napoleon if he didn&#x27;t agree to peace within four weeks. This treaty came to nothing after the Battle of Austerlitz on 2 December 1805, when Napoleon decisively crushed the Third Coalition. This forced the Prussian envoy, Count Karsten of Haugwitz, to negotiate a treaty of friendship called the Convention of Schönbrunn (15 December 1805) proclaiming an alliance between Prussia and France. As part of this treaty Prussia was forced to give up Brandenburg-Ansbach.

In February 1806 Haugwitz went to Paris to ratify this Treaty of Schönbrunn and to attempt to secure some modifications in favour of Prussia. He was received with a storm of abuse by Napoleon, who insisted on tearing up the treaty and drawing up a fresh one, which doubled the amount of territory to be ceded by Prussia and forced her to a breach with Great Britain by binding her to close the Hanoverian ports to British commerce. The treaty, signed on 15 February, left Prussia wholly isolated in Europe and led Prussia into war with Napoleon later that year.

In the War of the Fourth Coalition (1806–1807) Hof was then briefly held by General Bogislav Friedrich Emanuel von Tauentzien of the Prussian Army. Tauentzein more or less abandoned Hof on 8 October 1806 and Hof was easily taken by light cavalry from Napoleon&#x27;s Marshal General Jean-de-Dieu Soult&#x27;s IV Corps that same day. Hof&#x27;s geographic position made it an ideal &#x27;jumping off&#x27; point of Napoleon&#x27;s Campaign in Saxony which quickly resulted in the French-won Battle of Schleiz the next day and soon thereafter the famous Napoleon victory at the Battle of Jena.

Napoleon sold Hof to the Kingdom of Bavaria on 30 June 1810.

=== Bavarian rule (1810–1918) ===
==== Fire of 1823 ====
On 4 September 1823, the town was virtually destroyed by a fire as 9 out of 10 buildings were destroyed.

=== World War II ===
In 1945, Hof suffered minor destruction due to aerial attacks but by the end of 1945 housed twice its previous population, receiving German-speaking refugees from neighbouring Bohemia, where extensive ethnic cleansing of Czechoslovakia&#x27;s German-speaking population was taking place.

=== Modern era ===
From 1945 to 1990 Hof was very close to the border between East Germany and West Germany.
In 1989 thousands of East German citizens, who had demanded the right to travel or emigrate to West Germany and had been allowed to do so, first arrived on western soil at Hof&#x27;s railway station, having been placed on a special train and officially &quot;expelled&quot; by the East German government. Hof is located near the old Berlin-Munich autobahn, which was thought to be a possible invasion route by Warsaw Pact forces had the Cold War ever escalated into armed conflict (see Fulda Gap).

The festival occupies a big amusement park with a wide variety of attractions and all kinds of local food and beer specialties, and partly occupies a big beer tent area. Most of the latter takes place in a big concert hall but the atmosphere is similar to that of a beer tent. Every night, different local bands play mostly traditional Bavarian music.

==Weather and geography==
Hof is also known as &quot;Bavarian Siberia&quot; because temperatures are usually a few degrees lower than in most other parts of Bavaria, particularly in winter, but summers are warm.

The coat-of-arms of Hof is a red shield with two white towers against which leans a black shield with a gold lion. 322 miles away the town of Heimbach where Hengebach castle is located (former capital of the Duchy of Jülich) the coat-of-arms is almost the reverse: a black shield with a red roof on a white tower against which leans a gold shield with a black lion. Although Hof is 322 miles away from Heimbach, the two cities have some association. The castle of Hengebach in Heimbach is located in the section that was the former village of Schmidt and there lived a branch of the baronial dynasty of von Schmidt auf Altenstadt until they emigrated in 1749 and the seat of the barons von Altenstadt was very near Hof, in a part of the municipality of Gattendorf known as Kirchgattendorf, where the ruins of the von Altenstadt castles can still be seen. But the coincidences do not stop there: the family arms of the von Schmidts auf Altenstadt were a swan and the arms of Gattendorf are a swan.

The barons von Schmidt auf Altenstadt, as barons of the village Gattendorf in the environs of Hof were a significant part of social and aristocratic life in the town. In the nineteenth century, Christoph August von Schmidt, after having served as a Provost at the University of Saint Petersburg, Russia where he was ennobled by the Tsar and awarded the orders of St Stanislaus and Sts Ann-and-Vladimir, erected a monument describing his adventure and bearing the simplified, swan version of his coat-of-arms which today has been adopted by the village of Gattendorf as its municipal arms.

Hof provided Anthony Hope (author of &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot;) with his inspiration for Strelsau, capital of his fictitious kingdom of Ruritania. Although the book locates Ruritania along the railway line between Dresden in Sachsen (Saxony) and Prague, capital of Bohemia (modern day Czech Republic), one can see Hof in the descriptions of Strelsau. Among the clues there is the name &quot;Altstadt&quot; for the &quot;old town&quot;, similar to , the older part of Strelsau where &quot;Black Michael&quot;, the Duke of Strelsau, was popular.

=== Climate ===
Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cfb&quot; (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).

== Education ==
Hof is also home to the University of Applied Sciences Hof which has around 3,700 students and the University of Applied Sciences for Administration and Legal Affairs in Bavaria which has around 1,800 students.
== Media ==
In Hof is the headquarters of the Frankenpost, the regional newspaper.

There are two radio stations Radio Euroherz and Extra Radio.

Furthermore are the studios of the regional television channel (TV Upper-Franconia) in Hof.

== Military ==
Hof was of special interest during the Cold War as it was near the border with Czechoslovakia and the GDR. On Hohe Saas, there was a radar site. A border camp of the American 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment was near the town. The 511th Military Intelligence Battalion also maintained a border resident office in Hof*. Between 1949 and 1993, Hof was also the site of an RIAS transmitting station.

== Transport ==
Hof central station is on the Regensburg–Hof, Bamberg–Hof and Leipzig–Hof main lines and the Hof–Bad Steben branch line.

Buses are run by HofBus, which operates 12 routes in the town.

From 2015 to 2019, he starred as Double G on the Nickelodeon sitcom &quot;Game Shakers&quot;.

== Early life ==
Mitchell was born August 25, 1978, in Chicago, Illinois, and is from the South Side. He attended Chicago Vocational High School and took drama classes at the ETA Creative Arts Foundation. He has two sisters, Kenyatta and Kyra.

==Career==

Mitchell started his acting career alongside Kenan Thompson at the age of 15, in the Nickelodeon comedy sketch series &quot;All That&quot;, from 1994 to 1999. He and Thompson worked on the series &quot;Kenan &amp; Kel&quot; from 1996 to 2000. They starred in the 1997 film &quot;Good Burger&quot;, which grew out of one of Mitchell&#x27;s sketches from &quot;All That&quot;. The duo appeared together in an episode of &quot;Sister, Sister&quot; with Tia and Tamera Mowry, four episodes of &quot;The Steve Harvey Show&quot;, and in a special two-part episode of &quot;Cousin Skeeter&quot;. They were also featured in an episode of &quot;Sabrina, the Teenage Witch&quot;.

Outside of his ventures with Kenan Thompson, Mitchell provided the voice of a mild-mannered and playful dog named T-Bone in the children&#x27;s cartoon series &quot;Clifford the Big Red Dog&quot;, alongside John Ritter, from 2000 to 2003. Additionally, he made an appearance in the 2004 Kanye West music video &quot;All Falls Down&quot; as a valet. Mitchell co-hosted &quot;Dance 360&quot; with Fredro Starr; the show lasted for only one season. From 2005 until 2006, Mitchell portrayed Manny Sellers in the sitcom &quot;One on One&quot;, and in 2007 Mitchell starred in BET&#x27;s &quot;Take the Cake&quot;. Some of his other credits include &quot;Honeydripper&quot; and &quot;Mystery Men&quot;. In 2003, both Mitchell and his &quot;Kenan &amp; Kel&quot; co-star Kenan Thompson auditioned for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, but only Thompson made the cut. In 2006, Mitchell was the subject of a death hoax, when a rumor was spread around Myspace.

In March 2008, he filmed his writing and producing debut, &quot;Dance Fu&quot;, in which he also starred as the lead role. Also in 2008, Mitchell appeared in two Detroit-based stage productions, &quot;Affairs&quot; and &quot;Laundromat&quot;, the latter written by Carlos Faison and also starred comedian Buddy Lewis, Leanne &quot;Lelee&quot; Lyons of R&amp;B group SWV, celebrity impersonator/stage actor Matt Macis, and vocalist and performer Lauren &quot;Lexxi&quot; Alexis. Mitchell was a part of G4&#x27;s &quot;Attack of the Show!&quot;, playing various characters. He also has a recurring role on the PBS Kids show &quot;Curious George&quot;.

Mitchell appeared at the 2011 Comikaze Expo with several of his &quot;All That&quot; cast members, and has appeared in numerous panels of the same kind since, including at New York Comic Con in 2015, and filmed segments with them for the show&#x27;s 22nd anniversary celebration on The Splat in April 2016. Mitchell guest starred on &quot;Sam &amp; Cat&quot; as rapper Peezy B, in the episode &quot;#PeezyB&quot;.

Mitchell was a cast member on Dan Schneider&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Game Shakers&quot;, which premiered on Nickelodeon on September 12, 2015. Mitchell played the role of Double G, a rap superstar and business partner of the Game Shakers company. Mitchell also starred in the Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;Loiter Squad&quot; in 2015, and TV One&#x27;s &quot;Love That Girl!&quot;, as well as writing and directing the inspirational film &quot;She Is Not My Sister&quot; and several music videos.

On September 23, 2015, Mitchell appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot; in a skit featuring his iconic role as Ed from &quot;Good Burger&quot;. Mitchell was also reunited with his former &quot;Kenan &amp; Kel&quot; costar Kenan Thompson, who reprised his role as &quot;Lester Oakes, Construction Worker&quot;. They later competed against one another in an episode of the revived Nickelodeon game show &quot;Double Dare&quot; that aired in November 2018. They also teamed as executive producers for the reboot of &quot;All That&quot; which premiered in June 2019 and ran until 2020. Mitchell also returned as a recurring cast member.

Mitchell hosted the TV series &quot;Tails of Valor&quot;, which focused on true stories of service animals whose work has changed people&#x27;s lives. Also in 2019, Mitchell competed as a celebrity contestant on the 28th season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, with his partner Witney Carson and finished in second place. Starting in December 2020, Mitchell appeared as a panelists for MTV&#x27;s &quot;Ridiculousness&quot; spinoff, &quot;Deliciousness&quot;.

In 2022, Mitchell released a book entitled &quot;Blessed Mode: 90 Days to Level Up Your Faith&quot;, available physically, digitally, and as an audiobook. A song titled &quot;Blessed Mode&quot; was later released to streaming services like Spotify and iTunes. He and wife Asia also competed in an episode of &quot;Guy&#x27;s Grocery Games&quot; against Ross Mathews. Later that year he released the children&#x27;s book, &quot;Prank Day&quot;.

The same year, Mitchell would team up with Thompson once more on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; for the &quot;Kenan and Kelly&quot; sketch in the December 3, 2022, episode hosted by Keke Palmer. He also starred in the VH1 television movie &quot;All I Didn&#x27;t Want For Christmas&quot; with Gabourey Sidibe, which premiered on December 7.

<text>Danitra Vance (July 13, 1954 – August 21, 1994) was an American comedian and actress who was a cast member on the NBC sketch comedy show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (SNL) during its eleventh season in 1985.

Raised in Chicago&#x27;s South Side, Vance performed for The Second City, was an &quot;Off-Broadway favorite,&quot; and was the first Black woman of the primary &quot;SNL&quot; cast and, following Denny Dillon and along with Terry Sweeney, one of the first LGBT members, though she was not out to the public during her lifetime. Her comedy and theater work featured themes of social issues, including that of being consistently stereotyped during casting. Throughout her career, she received an Obie Award and an NAACP Image Award. She also appeared in feature films like &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot;, &quot;Limit Up&quot;, and &quot;Jumpin&#x27; at the Boneyard&quot;.

In 1990, Vance was diagnosed with breast cancer, and performed several works through remission and recurrence until her death in 1994. In the final years of her life, she requested that her family host her services at an amusement park.

==Early life and early career==
Raised in the South Side, Chicago, Vance grew up with her mother, younger sister, and maternal grandparents in a household where telling stories was the main form of entertainment, and graduated from nearby Thornton Township High School in 1972. In high school she was active in theater and was a member of the debate team. She later attended National College of Education before transferring to Roosevelt University in 1975, where she studied playwriting and acting, and graduated with honors. She then moved to London to study at Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art, where she was classically trained in Shakespeare and earned a MFA.

Vance started her career performing with The Second City improv group before moving to New York City in 1981 with goals of performing only to face direct discrimination and return to the Midwest to teach high school in Gary, Indiana, where her students helped inspire characters in her next show. She initially performed the characters in Old Town, Chicago.

From November 30 – December 11, 1984, Vance mounted the show, &quot;Danitra Vance and the Mell-o White Boys,&quot; at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club. In a review of the piece that ran in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, theater critic Alisa Solomon wrote that Vance&#x27;s comedy &quot;stabs while it entertains, actually causing a physical catch in your laughter, as she undercuts every pose she takes... Beginning with and then undermining stereotypes, Vance creates an unsettling tension among stereotypes, reality, and the conditions that create stereotypes.&quot; Among the characters she performed in the show were several that she later developed on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; – including teenaged mother Cabrini Green Jackson and Flotilla Williams (who performs a version of Romeo and Juliet&#x27;s balcony scene from her fire escape), described as a &quot;ghetto Shakespearean actress.&quot;

== &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; ==
Vance was the first Black woman to become an &quot;SNL&quot; repertory player in 1985; and the second lesbian cast member hired after Denny Dillon, though Vance&#x27;s sexual orientation was not public knowledge until her death. Her casting alongside Terry Sweeney (the show&#x27;s first openly gay male cast member) was also the first time that &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; had two gay cast members.

Vance joined the &quot;SNL&quot; cast during a time of great transition and turbulence for the show, and she became frustrated over repeatedly having characters stereotypical of young Black women written for her. She was ultimately let go by &quot;SNL&quot; at the end of the 1986 season, along with many other cast members, including Sweeney, Joan Cusack, Robert Downey Jr., Randy Quaid, and Anthony Michael Hall.

===Recurring characters on &quot;SNL&quot;===
*&quot;That Black Girl&quot;, a Black actress looking to hit the big time, despite being passed up because of her race (a parody of Marlo Thomas&#x27;s &quot;That Girl&quot;)
*Cabrini Green Jackson, a professional teenage mother and motivational speaker who gives advice on teen pregnancy

====Celebrity impersonations====
*Diahann Carroll (as Dominique Deveraux on &quot;Dynasty&quot;)
*Lola Falana
*Cicely Tyson
*Leslie Uggams

==Late career==
She was awarded an NAACP Image Award in 1986 and later won an Obie Award for Distinguished Performance by an Actress for her performance in the theatrical adaptation of &quot;Spunk&quot;, a collection of short stories written by Zora Neale Hurston. That same year, Vance was also in the original cast of George C. Wolfe&#x27;s &quot;The Colored Museum&quot;; she would go on to reprise some of her performances therein for a 1991 Great Performances restaging of the play.

Vance was the second female lead, opposite Nancy Allen, in &quot;Limit Up&quot;, in which she played a guardian angel on assignment for God (played by Ray Charles). She had small roles in &quot;The War of the Roses&quot; and &quot;Little Man Tate&quot; and a more significant role in &quot;Jumpin&#x27; at the Boneyard&quot;, for which she was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award.

==Death==
Diagnosed with breast cancer in 1990, Vance underwent a single mastectomy and incorporated the experience into a solo skit, &quot;The Radical Girl&#x27;s Guide to Radical Mastectomy&quot;. She expanded on her experiences in a second autobiographical show, titled &quot;Pre-Shrunk&quot;, which was to be performed at The Public Theater. However, she was unable to perform as her cancer recurred in 1993. She died of the disease the following year in Markham, Illinois, with her age incorrectly cited as 35. She had shaved five years off. She requested her funeral be held at an amusement park, and her family threw her a &quot;going-away party&quot; with apple bobbing and bean bag tossing to respect her wishes. She was survived by her partner, Jones Miller.

<text>Tangimoana is a community in the Manawatū-Whanganui Region of the North Island of New Zealand. It had a population of 303 permanent residents in 2018. It is located 15 kilometres southwest of Bulls, and 30 kilometres west of Palmerston North.

The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of &quot;weeping sea&quot; for .

The settlement lies on the southern bank of the Rangitīkei River near the mouth. It was developed in 1920 as a holiday place for people from Palmerston North and other inland towns and sections sold from 1921. 

The Boating Club has a licensed facility for members and their guests. A small corner store is open daily, it sells basic supplies as well as takeaway food.

Tangimoana is popular with those seeking an alternative lifestyle. Many residents are artists and once a year they hold an Art Festival to showcase their works along with Art and Craft Markets during the year in the McKelvie Hall.

On Saturday morning the McKelvie Hall is open to access the community library. The library consists of many donated books as well as books from the Feilding Library which are regularly changed.

Tangimoana has limited facilities and very few employment opportunities. Most residents travel to Palmerston North, Feilding or Levin for employment. The main attraction is the river and beach which are both peaceful and natural. It is a popular beach for horses and dogs. A four-wheel drive vehicle is needed to drive directly to the ocean.

<text>Patrick John Joseph Burns (April 4, 1952 – November 19, 2010) was a National Hockey League head coach. Over 14 seasons between 1988 and 2004, he coached in 1,019 games with the Montreal Canadiens, Toronto Maple Leafs, Boston Bruins, and New Jersey Devils. Burns retired in 2005 after being diagnosed with recurring cancer, which eventually claimed his life five years later.

In 2014, he was posthumously inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.

==Professional career==
As a child, Burns had always wanted to play on an NHL team, and win the Stanley Cup. Realizing he didn&#x27;t possess the skill set to make it professionally, Burns became a police officer. He had also worked part-time as a scout for the Hull Olympiques of the QMJHL. He became an assistant coach with Hull in 1984, and worked his way through the ranks, becoming the team&#x27;s head coach after owner Wayne Gretzky and general manager Charles Henry decided he&#x27;d be the best fit. During his time with the Olympiques, he coached future Hockey Hall of Fame member Luc Robitaille. Before the start of the 1987–88 NHL season, Montreal Canadiens general manager Serge Savard offered Burns the head coach position for the Sherbrooke Canadiens of the American Hockey League. Burns held the position for one year before being promoted to head coach of Montreal.

In Burns first year as an NHL coach, the Canadiens finished the 1988–89 NHL season with a division-winning 53-18-9, ultimately losing the Stanley Cup finals in six games to the Calgary Flames. Burns won the Jack Adams Award for coach of the year, his first of three wins. A defensive-minded coach, Burns would lead Montreal to the second round of the playoffs in every year as head coach, before making a shocking resignation at the end of the 1992 season where they were swept by the Boston Bruins, citing his frustration with the media.

Following his departure from Montreal, Burns was hired as head coach of the Toronto Maple Leafs. He had also received an offer from the Los Angeles Kings, but he cited the Leafs&#x27; history as a factor in his decision, and added &quot;I find myself fortunate to coach two of the greatest franchises in NHL history.&quot; He led Toronto in their best playoff run since 1967, making it to the conference finals, losing in seven games to the Kings. At the NHL Awards, Burns won his second Jack Adams trophy. He followed that performance with another trip to the conference finals in 1994, losing in five to the Vancouver Canucks. The Leafs again made the playoffs in 1995, but following a disappointing losing streak during the 1996 season, Burns was let go.

Burns took a year off from hockey before being hired to coach the Boston Bruins in 1997. He won the Jack Adams at the end of the season, making him the only coach in history to win the award three separate times. All three of his wins came in his introductory season with the team. The Bruins continued to have success until the 1999-2000 season, when they missed the playoffs, the first time in Burns&#x27;s career where his team missed the playoffs. Burns was fired eight games into the 2000-01 season, following a disappointing 3-4-1 record.

Burns finished his head coaching career with the New Jersey Devils, leading them to the Stanley Cup in 2003 while winning over 40 games in both seasons as coach of the team. He resigned in 2005 in an effort to focus on his health and treatment following a cancer diagnosis in 2004, though he remained with the organisation as a special assignment coach.

==Personal life==
Burns was born in Montreal in 1952 to Geralda &quot;Louise&quot; Girardeau and Alfred Burns. Pat was the youngest of 6 children, he has 4 older sisters and 1 older brother (Violet, Alfred &quot;Sonny&quot;, Lillian, Phyllis and Diane). 

The Burns family moved to Gatineau, Quebec, following the death of Alfred in an industrial incident, when Pat was 4 years old.

Before his career in hockey, he was a police officer in Gatineau. Burns originally studied to be a welder, but became a police officer after hearing they were in need for positions. Burns had lied about his age to get the job, stating he was 18 when in actuality, he was 17. He would hold the position for sixteen years.

Burns survived colon cancer in 2004 and liver cancer in 2005, retiring from coaching after the second diagnosis. In 2009 Burns announced that his colon cancer had returned and metastasized to his lungs, was thus inoperable, and therefore he decided to forgo further treatment. During an April 2010 interview Burns stated &quot;I know my life is nearing its end and I accept that.&quot; Gesturing to a group of local minor hockey players, he said: &quot;A young player could come from Stanstead who plays in an arena named after me. I probably won&#x27;t see the project to the end, but let&#x27;s hope I&#x27;m looking down on it and see a young Wayne Gretzky or Mario Lemieux.&quot;

He was married to Line Burns. He had two children, a son from a long-term relationship and a daughter from a previous marriage.

He was the cousin of Robin Burns.

==Death==
It was reported on September 16, 2010, that Burns&#x27;s health had suddenly deteriorated and that he had returned to his home in Magog, Quebec, to be with his family. Reports surfaced the following day that Burns had died that morning, but Burns&#x27;s son denied news reports that his father had died. That same day, an online report by the Toronto Sun also incorrectly reported Burns&#x27;s death, but was quickly revealed to be erroneous. Burns himself talked to both English and French media about the incident, denying that he had died and asked that his status be clarified immediately.

He died on November 19, 2010, in Sherbrooke, Quebec, at the Maison Aube-Lumière, of colon cancer at age 58, which had eventually spread to his lungs.

Shortly after his funeral, thieves broke into Burns&#x27;s widow&#x27;s car, stealing personal belongings, credit cards and numerous pieces of hockey memorabilia, including 30 autographed NHL jerseys that were to be auctioned for charity. Some of the items were later recovered. One day after his death, prior to a game between the Toronto Maple Leafs and Montreal Canadiens (two of the teams he coached) at the Bell Centre, there was a special tribute video highlighting the great moments of his coaching career, followed by a moment of silence.

==Legacy==
Burns has been frequently mentioned as one of the best coaches in the history of the National Hockey League, often appearing in lists and discussions between fans and sports websites.

Burns is the only coach in history to win the Jack Adams Award three separate times, with all three of his wins came in his introductory season with that respective NHL team. He led two teams to the Stanley Cup Finals in inaugural seasons with two teams, losing in 1989 and winning in 2003. He coached four total teams and led each to the playoffs at least twice.

In 2011, an arena bearing Burns&#x27;s name was built at Stanstead College, a private boarding school in the Eastern Townships.

On March 26, 2010, a Facebook group was launched by three Canadian hockey fans calling for Burns to be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame before he succumbed to cancer. The &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Pat Burns into the Hockey Hall of Fame – NOW!&quot; group attracted over 39,000 members in its first week. In its second week the group&#x27;s membership had grown to over 54,000, and surpassed 80,000 at its conclusion. Burns was not selected for the 2010 class of inductees, and was posthumously announced as an inductee on June 23, 2014.

<text>Duke of Magenta (1875–1899) was one of the most successful racehorses in the United States in the 19th century.

==Background==
Foaled in 1875 at the Woodburn Stud near Lexington, Kentucky, he was owned by New York City tobacco tycoon George L. Lorillard and trained by Hall of Famer R. Wyndham Walden. Duke of Magenta was one of the last sons of the Thoroughbred sire Lexington.

==Racing career==
In 1878, Duke of Magenta won the Preakness Stakes, the Withers Stakes, the Belmont Stakes, and the Travers Stakes, a feat accomplished since by only two other colts: Man o&#x27; War and Native Dancer. Excluding the Withers, he is also one of only seven horses to have won the Preakness, Belmont, and Travers.

In Duke of Magenta&#x27;s day, the Derby was a recently established race not yet considered important by East Coast breeders. Duke of Magenta died on September 20, 1899, at the farm of J. McCloud in Brookline, Massachusetts.

==Honors==
In 2011, Duke of Magenta was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.

<text>Gunnedah () is a town in north-central New South Wales, Australia and is the seat of the Gunnedah Shire local government area. In the the town recorded a population of 8,338. Gunnedah is situated within the Liverpool Plains, a fertile agricultural region, with 80% of the surrounding shire area devoted to farming. The Namoi River flows west then north-west through the town providing water beneficial to agricultural operations in the area.

The Gunnedah area is a significant producer of cotton, coal, beef, lamb and pork, and cereal and oilseed grains. Gunnedah is also home to AgQuip, Australia&#x27;s largest annual agricultural field day.

Gunnedah is located on the Oxley and Kamilaroi Highways providing convenient road links to much of the northern sector of the state including to the regional centre Tamworth, distant. The town has a station on the Mungindi railway line and is served by the daily NSW TrainLink Xplorer passenger service to and from Sydney and Moree.

It claims the titles &quot;Koala Capital of World&quot; and &quot;Rudest town in New South Wales&quot;.

In recent years the local shire council has moved away from this promotional tagline and there are concerns over the health of the local koala population and the impacts of climate change and local Environmentalists developments on koala habitat.

== History ==
Gunnedah and the surrounding areas were originally inhabited by Aboriginal Australians speaking the Kamilaroi (Gamilaraay) language. The name of the town in Kamilaroi means &quot;Place of White Stones&quot;. In 1818, English surveyor general John Oxley traversed the district, for which a monument pays tribute to him at the base of Mullaley Mountain. The area now occupied by the town was settled by European sheep farmers in 1833 or 1834. With settlement in the area focused on wool production, Gunnedah was initially known as &#x27;The Woolshed&#x27; until taking its name from the local Indigenous people who called themselves the &quot;Gunn-e-darr&quot;, the most famous of whom was Cumbo Gunnerah.

Coal was discovered on Black Jack Hill in 1877. By 1891, 6,000 tons of coal had been raised from shafts. The Gunnedah Colliery Company was registered in May 1899 and by 22 June a private railway some in length had been completed from the railway station to their mine. In September 1957, the Government Railway took over the working of the line.

Dorothea Mackellar wrote her famous poem &quot;My Country&quot; (popularly known as &quot;I Love a Sunburnt Country&quot;) about her family&#x27;s farm near Gunnedah. This is remembered by the annual Dorothea Mackellar Poetry Awards for school students held in Gunnedah.

In early 2012, Gunnedah experienced a mining boom resulting in rental properties being leased by mining companies for up to $1,350 per week.

== Heritage listings ==
Gunnedah has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Werris Creek-Moree railway: Gunnedah railway station
* Gunnedah Leather Processors

==Population==
According to the 2016 census of Population, there are 9,726 people in Gunnedah.
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 13.7% of the population. 
* 86.2% of people were born in Australia and 90.2% of people only spoke English at home. 
* The most common responses for religion were Anglican 28.8%, Catholic 27.3% and No Religion 20.3%.

==Sports==
The most popular sport in Gunnedah by a wide margin is Rugby league. The local team, the Gunnedah Bulldogs, play out of Kitchener Park. They compete in the Group 4 Rugby League competition, in which they have won seven premierships.

Other sports teams include the Gunnedah AFL Bulldogs competing in AFL North West NSW, Gunnedah Red Devils RUFC competing in the Central Northern Rugby Union and Gunnedah FC competing in the Northern Inland Football.

== Geography ==
Gunnedah Shire is situated above sea level on the Liverpool Plains in the Namoi River valley. It is very flat; the tallest hills are above sea level. The climate is hot in summer, mild in winter and dry, although rainstorms in catchment areas occasionally cause flooding of the Namoi River. Major floods cut transport links to the town, briefly isolating it from the outside world. The town is located on a rich coal seam and within the northern New South Wales wheat belt.

The Gunnedah area is noted for its abundance of native wildlife, including kangaroos, echidnas and koalas. Koalas can often be found in trees within the town, as well as in the surrounding countryside with the help of signs placed by the local tourist centre. The koala population is considered to be the largest koala colony in the state, west of the Great Dividing Range.

==Climate==
Gunnedah has a textbook subtropical climate with temperatures regularly exceeding 40 °C in summer and dropping below 0 °C in winter. This is due to the town&#x27;s far inland location on the North West Slopes. Its average annual rainfall is , which is spread throughout the year, however severe thunderstorms in the summer months often cause heavy downpours which boost rainfall totals.

The highest daily maximum temperature recorded was , on 24 January 1882; the lowest daily maximum temperature recorded was , on 4 August 1921. Snow is very rare, with the most recent occurrence in 1984.



== Education ==
Gunnedah has three secondary schools: Gunnedah High School, Carinya Christian school and St Mary&#x27;s College. There are three government (Gunnedah Public School, Gunnedah South Public School, and G.S. Kidd Memorial School) and two non-government (St Xavier&#x27;s Catholic School and Carinya Christian School) primary schools. A campus of the New England Institute of TAFE is also located within the town.

== Media ==
Local media include the &quot;Gunnedah Times&quot; and &quot;Namoi Valley Independent&quot; newspapers and the radio stations 2MO and 2GGG. The &quot;Namoi Valley Independent&quot;, published by Australian Community Media, switched to a digital-only newspaper model in 2020. The &quot;Gunnedah Times&quot; started as a print newspaper in November 2020 and is published by the Dunnet family, of Narrabri, who also publishes the bi-weekly &quot;The Courier&quot; newspaper in Narrabri. 2MO began broadcasting in 1930 and was only the fourth Radio Licence issued in Australia, being the first station established in Australia outside a capital city.

==Transport==
The Oxley Highway and the Kamilaroi Highway both pass through Gunnedah, for a short distance, concurrently. The Oxley Highway leads to Tamworth in the east and Coonabarabran to the west. The Kamilaroi Highway leads to Quirindi to the south-east and Boggabri to the north-west.

=== Railway station ===
Gunnedah railway station is situated on the Mungindi railway line, from Sydney. The station, opened in 1879, consists of a substantial station building on a single side platform, a passing loop and small goods yard. There are also sidings serving an adjacent flour mill. To the west of the station there are extensive sidings serving grain silos and loop sidings serving coal loading facilities. For a brief three-year period after the railway arrived in Gunnedah it was the railhead until construction was completed to Boggabri and then to Narrabri South Junction in 1882. Currently a single daily Xplorer diesel railmotor operating between Sydney and Moree serves the station.

<doc id="661892" wikidata="Q2417902" url="?curid=661892" title="Fosbury flop">
<text>The Fosbury flop is a jumping style used in the track and field sport of high jump. It was popularized and perfected by American athlete Dick Fosbury, whose gold medal in the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City brought it to the world&#x27;s attention. The flop became the dominant style of the event; before Fosbury, most elite jumpers used the straddle technique, Western roll, Eastern cut-off, or scissors jump to clear the bar. Though the backwards flop technique had been known for years before Fosbury, landing surfaces had been sandpits or low piles of matting and high jumpers had to land on their feet or at least land carefully to prevent injury. With the advent of deep foam matting, high jumpers were able to be more adventurous in their landing styles and hence more experimental with jumping styles.

==Technique==

The approach (or run-up) in the Fosbury flop is characterized by (at least) the final four or five steps being run in a curve, allowing the athlete to lean in to the turn, away from the bar. This allows the center of gravity to be lowered even before knee flexion, giving a longer time period for the take-off thrust. Additionally, on take-off, the sudden move from inward lean to outwards produces a rotation of the jumper&#x27;s body along the bar&#x27;s axis, aiding clearance.

Combined with the rotation around the jumper&#x27;s vertical axis (center around the waist, which rotates) produced by the drive leg (similar to an ice skater spinning around on one spot), the resulting body position on bar clearance is laid out supine with the body at ninety degrees to the bar with the head and shoulders crossing the bar before the trunk and legs. This gives the Flop its characteristic &quot;backward over the bar&quot; appearance, with the athlete landing on the mat on their shoulders and back.

While in flight, the athlete can progressively arch shoulders, back, and legs in a rolling motion, keeping as much of the body as possible below the bar. It is theoretically possible for the center of mass to pass under the bar.

While the straddle style required strength in the takeoff knee and could be used by relatively burly athletes (e g. Valeriy Brumel), the flop allowed athletes of a slender build to use their co-ordination to greater effect and not risk knee injuries, which they had previously suffered from other styles.

Predominantly, athletes using the flop use a &quot;J&quot; shaped approach, where the first three-to-five strides head in a straight line at ninety degrees to the bar, with the final four-to-five being run in a curve (noted above).

Fosbury himself cleared the bar with his hands by his sides, whereas some athletes cross the bar with their arms held out to the side or even above their heads, optimizing their mass-distribution. Studies show that variations in approach, arm technique, and other factors can be adjusted to achieve each athlete&#x27;s best performance.

For reasons similar to those noted as drawbacks to the &quot;J&quot; shaped approach, the flop&#x27;s optimal speed of approach is not a full-out sprint. Similarly, increasing the number of strides beyond eight or ten is not recommended unless the athlete has achieved high consistency in the approach and can handle the increased speed. The angle of take-off towards the bar is usually somewhere between fifteen and thirty degrees. The angle must not be too shallow, or the jumper jumps too far along the bar, landing on it. If the angle is too wide, there is not enough time to &quot;layout&quot; in the air.

The &quot;broken&quot; leg (which is thrust into the air first at take-off) is always the nearer leg to the bar. Thus someone who uses a left foot take-off (where the left foot transmits the jump force and is the latter to leave the ground) will approach the bar from its right-hand side, curving to their left to approach their right shoulder. The right leg will drive into the air, and the jumper&#x27;s body rotates anti-clockwise around the vertical axis to present their back to the bar in flight.

As well as driving the leg and hips at take-off, the athlete should drive or even swing one or both arms into the air, contributing to the upwards momentum.

<doc id="661894" wikidata="Q3138923" url="?curid=661894" title="Hochelaga-Maisonneuve">
<text>Hochelaga-Maisonneuve () is a neighbourhood in Montreal, Canada, situated in the east end of the island, generally to the south of the city&#x27;s Olympic Stadium and east of downtown.

Historically a poor neighbourhood, it has experienced significant change and gentrification in recent years.

== History ==
===Early history===
Hochelaga was named after the Iroquois village of the same name, first visited by explorer Jacques Cartier in 1534. The neighbourhood was at one time believed to be the location of the historic village, but modern historians and anthropologists have not reached agreement on the exact location. 
Present-day Hochelaga was founded as a suburban village in 1863. Industry soon started moving in, including the Hudon and Sainte-Anne cotton mills and in 1876 the terminal and railway shops of the Quebec, Montreal, Ottawa and Occidental Railway.

In December 1883, Hochelaga was annexed to the city of Montreal against the demands of some of its landowners to the east. In response, they separated their territory to found the village of Maisonneuve.

Maisonneuve grew rapidly between 1896 and 1915 and became of one Canada&#x27;s largest industrial suburbs, marketed as a model industrial city and the &quot;Pittsburgh of Canada&quot; during the first two decades of the 20th century. These factories hired many workers, including immigrants and people from the surrounding countryside. They worked in the shoe, textile, tanning, slaughterhouse, tobacco, food, and shipbuilding industries.

In 1918, $18 million in debt, Maisonneuve was forced to annex to Montreal, consolidated the neighbourhood as Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.

The Montreal Botanical Garden was opened in 1931.

=== Decline ===
The construction of major transportation infrastructures such as Highway 25 in 1967, required the demolition of some 2,000 homes and institutional buildings. These changes, combined with the movement of capital and production to Toronto, hurt the neighbourhood&#x27;s economy and vitality. Many factories left the area, along with numerous residents.

In 1976 the Olympic Stadium was opened, in time for the Summer Olympics.

Beginning in the 1980s, factories started shutting down at an alarming rate, leaving the neighborhood ridden with poverty and a high concentration of welfare, especially in Hochelaga. This has led to a population exodus, relatively high crime rates, and a generally unfavorable view of the area.

The district became particularly notorious for prostitution, a contentious issue for many years.

During the Quebec Biker War, the Hells Angels had their clubhouse in Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, which worsened its reputation for criminality.

In the most notorious incident of the &quot;guerre des motards&quot;, on 9 August 1995, a drug dealer was killed by a bomb planted in his jeep while the shrapnel badly injured an 11-year boy, Daniel Desrochers, who died of his wounds four days later.

=== Present day ===
The 2010s were marked by increased gentrification, the arrival of students and professionals, and condo development leading to protests and some cases of vandalism of commerce. Notable areas that developed include the &quot;Promenade Ontario&quot; shopping street and the &quot;Place Simon Valois&quot; revitalized in 2017.

Despite this, areas continue to struggle with poverty, prostitution and drug trafficking, particularly in the south-western corner of Hochelaga on Rue Sainte-Catherine Est.

In summer 2020, in the same area, a significant number
of homeless people began camping along Rue Notre-Dame, creating something akin to a tent city. This was attributed in part to the ongoing housing crisis in Montreal, significantly heightened by unemployment due to the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as overcrowding of existing shelters.

In December 2020, the camp was shut down by the police, following a fire a few days earlier and hygiene concerns. This occurred despite promises from the mayor that they would not be forcibly relocated.

However, by the summer of 2022, many of the occupants had gradually returned, and were again removed by the SPVM in June, leading to an outcry from homeless advocates and certain opposition politicians.

== Features ==
A notable attraction is the Olympic Park, which contains the Stadium, Olympic Tower, Saputo Stadium, Biodome, Olympic Pool and Maurice Richard Arena. The Biodome was renovated between 2018 and 2020. It reopened to the public on August 31, 2020.

<text>Javier Sotomayor Sanabria (; born 13 October 1967) is a Cuban former track and field athlete who specialized in the high jump and is the current world record holder. The 1992 Olympic gold medalist, he was the dominant high jumper of the 1990s; his personal best of makes him the only person ever to have cleared eight feet (2.44 m). He cleared eight feet twice, the first time with 2.44 m in 1989.

Sotomayor is a two-time gold medalist at the IAAF World Championships in Athletics, and also won two silver medals at the competition. At the IAAF World Indoor Championships he won four gold medals between 1989 and 1999. In addition, he won three straight titles at the Pan American Games from 1987 to 1995. He is regarded as the best high jumper of all time. After Cuban boycotts of the Olympics in 1984 and 1988 and an injury in 1996 cost him chances at additional Olympic medals, he won the silver medal at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. He retired in 2001.

==Personal life==
Sotomayor was born in Limonar, Matanzas Province on 13 October 1967. The son of a day-care worker and a sugar factory maintenance man, Sotomayor was first sent to a Cuban sports school as a prospective basketball player because of his height. At age 14, coaches made him a high jumper and by 19, he was ranked No. 5 in the world.

Sotomayor is engaged to Amaya González, sharing private and professional life. He has four sons. One of his sons, Javier Sotomayor García, has also competed in the high jump.

==Early career==
===World junior record in 1984===
Sotomayor was only 14 when he first cleared 2 metres and by the end of 1983 he had a best of . He then set the junior world record on 19 May 1984 by clearing at a meet held in Havana. He was not able to go to Los Angeles for the 1984 Olympics due to the boycott by Cuba (and most communist nations). In 1985 he took silver in the World Indoor Championships in Paris, with a best jump of on 19 January, and then improved his personal best two months later outdoors in Havana, with a jump of on 20 March 1985. He continued to improve the following year with a best jump of at a meet in Santiago de Cuba on 23 February 1986. He won his first international title in 1987, at the Pan American Games, and established a new personal best of at a meet in Athens, Greece on 20 June 1987.

==Career==
===First world record 1988===
On 8 September 1988, at a meet held in Salamanca, Spain – just four days before the opening ceremonies of the 1988 Summer Olympics – he set a world record of . However, Sotomayor was again denied the chance to compete in the Olympics in Seoul due to another Cuban boycott of the Olympics. Sotomayor&#x27;s leap of broke, by one centimeter, the record of set the previous summer (30 June 1987) by Sweden&#x27;s Patrik Sjöberg in Stockholm.

===Raises record in 1989 and again in 1993===
Sotomayor twice increased the world record, to on 29 July 1989, in the Central American and Caribbean Championships, held in San Juan, Puerto Rico and to the current record of in Salamanca, Spain on 27 July 1993. The July 1989 record of 2.44 m, which he cleared on his second attempt, was a historic jump for Imperial-measure fans, as that was the first jump over 8 feet.

After setting the record at in July 1989, Sotomayor became inconsistent the following year. He missed much of the 1990 outdoor season after surgery to remove scar tissue in his knee and heel. Competing before an adoring Cuban public at the Pan American Games in Havana on Saturday 10 August 1991, Sotomayor defeated his principal rival, American Hollis Conway, with a jump of . He then thrilled the crowd by having the bar raised 10 cm to a new world record of , but in each of his three attempts he jumped into the bar, striking it with his shoulders on the way up each time. Afterwards he said, &quot;My physical condition is better, but psychologically I am not well prepared.&quot;

The 1993 record set at the Salamanca Invitational track meet was remarkable in that Sotomayor required only four jumps: he took his first jump at , passed at , cleared on his first attempt, then had the bar raised to a record height of , which he missed on his first attempt and then succeeded on his second attempt, lightly brushing the bar. Videos of his record-setting leap show his unique, galloping approach with two elongated strides in the middle of his 14-step run, and a powerful left leg take-off as he pumps both of his arms: he begins his approach with three short steps, builds up speed, then takes exaggerated strides on steps 8 and 9, and then re-accelerates over his last five strides.

After setting the record in Salamanca, Sotomayor told reporters, &quot;I wanted to set the record here because it is a small city in which I feel like I am in Cuba. The people recognize me in the street and ask how I&#x27;m doing, the children surround me and I find myself in a good mental state.&quot;

===World indoor record in 1989===
Sotomayor set the current world indoor record of in Budapest on 4 March 1989.

He broke the record during the 1989 IAAF World Indoor Championships, clearing on his first attempt (and fifth jump overall). At this competition, Sotomayor was one of four men to clear , at which point he stood in third place, trailing Dietmar Mögenburg (Germany) and Dalton Grant (Great Britain) who each succeeded on their first attempts, while Sotomayor and Patrik Sjöberg (Sweden) each needed two tries. In Budapest, he took his first jump of the competition at , passed at , missed his initial try at then cleared on his second attempt; made a huge first attempt clearance at ; passed at ; then had the bar raised for a record attempt at , clearing on his first try, just brushing the bar with the back of his thighs on the way down. Germany&#x27;s Carlo Thränhardt, who had set the indoor record of one year earlier (26 February 1988) in Berlin, finished fifth at Budapest with a jump of .

===Olympic champion in 1992===
When he was finally able to compete in the Summer Olympics, in 1992, he won the gold medal, and later the silver medal at the 2000 Olympics (after the reversal of a drug suspension for drug usage). Between the Olympic games he won the 1993 and 1997 World Championships.

At the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, Sotomayor won the high jump on the basis of his ability to jump &quot;clean&quot; (no misses) at the highest height. Five men cleared the winning height of , but Sotomayor was the only one to clear the bar on his first attempt. All five competitors then failed at the next height, . Jumping last in the round, Sotomayor failed on his first two attempts at . When everyone else missed on their third attempts, Sotomayor was assured of the gold medal and therefore passed up his third attempt, opting for one try at a record height of , which he missed. Sotomayor was declared the victor on the basis of the tie-breaker: Patrik Sjöberg (Sweden) won the silver medal having cleared 2.34 on his second attempt, while Artur Partyka (Poland), Tim Forsyth (Australia) and Hollis Conway (USA) tied for the bronze medal.

===Indoor and outdoor world champion in 1993===
Less than one month after setting the world record of at Salamanca (on 27 July), Sotomayor won the 1993 World Championships held at Stuttgart, Germany on 22 August. He outjumped the competition, establishing a new World Championships record of : the second-place jumper, Artur Partyka (Poland) jumped 2.37.

The last time he would clear was on 25 March 1995 at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, Argentina. A healthy Sotomayor attempted to defend his title at the 1995 World Championships, held in Gothenburg, Sweden. He cleared the winning height of on 8 August, but finished second to Troy Kemp (Bahamas) on the basis of missed jumps. Partyka finished third, at 2.35.

At the 1997 World Championships in Athens, Greece, Sotomayor again won the gold medal on 6 August, defeating Partyka with a 1997 world-leading jump of (on his second attempt), to the Partyka&#x27;s (his best of the season to that date.)

===1996 outdoor season===
Sotomayor had a good start to 1996 during the indoor season, but was plagued by injury during the outdoor season. At the 1996 Summer Olympics he attempted to defend his Olympic title in Atlanta. He qualified for the finals with a jump of on Friday, but in the finals on Sunday July 28, he could manage only his opening jump of , clearing on his first attempt. He then &quot;passed&quot; at the next height , and then failed in all three of his attempts at . His clearance left him in equal 11th position. This was a full 10 cm (4 inches) short of what was required to medal at Atlanta: American Charles Austin won the gold medal, breaking the Olympic record with a leap of .

Sotomayor underwent treatment for knee and heel injuries after his poor showing in the Atlanta Olympics and skipped the 1997 indoor season. He began training in Puerto Rico in spring 1997 for the outdoor season, but Cuban sports officials announced on 30 May 1997 that although Sotomayor was &quot;in good form&quot;, he was withdrawing from the season&#x27;s first big meet in Toronto and would instead make his season debut the following week at a track meet in France.

===1999 Pan American Games===
Sotomayor won the gold medal at the 1999 Pan American Games, held in Winnipeg. Just a few days after his victory, Games officials announced that his urine test tested positive for an illegal drug, cocaine (a stimulant), and on 4 August he was stripped of his medal and was sent home to Cuba in disgrace. At the time, this was widely regarded as the biggest drug scandal in the sport of track and field in over a decade (since Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson was stripped of his gold medal at the 1988 Seoul Olympics). In 1999 Sotomayor was a national celebrity, a well-known anti-drug crusader and the pride of Cuba&#x27;s sports system. Mario Granda, Cuba&#x27;s chief of sports medicine, reacted to the shocking news by saying the 31-year-old Sotomayor had &quot;passed more than 60 drug tests&quot; in his career and suggested that Sotomayor was the victim of sabotage.

===2000 Olympics in Sydney===
Sotomayor was allowed to participate in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney despite his two-year drug suspension from 1999. His suspension was upheld in June 2000, but in August the IAAF cut the penalty in half – effectively to time served – and allowed him to compete at Sydney at the age of 32. The finals of the men&#x27;s high jump were held on Sunday September 24, in rainy, windy conditions which worsened as the event progressed. The wet surface greatly impacted the results. Seven men cleared before the light rain began to worsen, and Russian Sergey Klyugin was the only jumper able to clear the next height, , doing so before the rain and wind peaked. Sotomayor was awarded silver on the count-back, having taken only two jumps with no misses (at and ): all other competitors had at least one failed attempt. The favorite to win the competition, Vyacheslav Voronin (Russia) managed to clear only in the rain, after having cleared one month before. Another medal favorite, Stefan Holm (Sweden), finished fourth and complained that the IAAF should not have reduced Sotomayor&#x27;s two-year suspension.

===Dominating career===
Sotomayor has a rare dominance in the history of this event. At the time he retired, he had 17 of the top 20 jumps of all time. Only 13 men in history have jumped 2.40 metres or higher, and only 5 have done it more than once. Sotomayor did it 24 times (in 21 different competitions between September 1988 – March 1995). He is the only person to have cleared (which he did twice). Following his world record in September 1993, he had his greatest year in 1994, when he (again) was the only jumper to scale 2.40 metres or better, doing so ten times that year: two during the indoor season in February, and seven times outdoors, starting at Seville on 5 June 1994, where he cleared 2.40 metres before recording the year&#x27;s best jump of . Besides dominating the event on the Grand Prix circuit, Sotomayor recorded wins at the Goodwill Games in St Petersburg on 29 July, and at the World Cup in London on 11 September, where his best jump of 2.40 m was a record 12 centimeters above the next-best performance. The last time he would clear 2.40 meters was on March 25, 1995, at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, Argentina. Only Bohdan Bondarenko and Mutaz Essa Barshim have jumped higher outdoors since, although four men equaled the mark.

During his career, Sotomayor was ranked by &quot;Track &amp; Field News&quot; in the &quot;Top 10&quot; in the men&#x27;s high jump in ten different years, and was ranked #1 eight of those ten years: in 1988, 89, 1992, 93, 94, 95, 97 and 1998. By comparison, the jumper with second-most #1 rankings over a career is Russian Valeriy Brumel in five consecutive years (1961–65). For his career Sotomayor accumulated 123 ranking points, while the jumper with the second-most career points, American Dwight Stones has 90 points and four consecutive #1 rankings (1973–76.)

==Drug tests==
Sotomayor tested positive for cocaine at the 1999 Pan American Games, which Cuban president Fidel Castro claimed was a set-up by the Cuban-American Mafia. Sotomayor claimed his innocence. After months of hearings, an IAAF arbitration panel upheld the two-year ban on June 27, 2000. The Cuban federation continued to appeal his case, citing a clause in the IAAF rulebook that allows drug bans to be modified under &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;. In a controversial decision announced on August 2, the IAAF shortened the suspension to one year – which had elapsed on July 30 – thereby allowing him to compete in the 2000 Summer Olympics. IAAF&#x27;s motivation for this action was that Sotomayor had done a great deal for the sport, had passed hundreds of drug tests during his long career, and acted exemplarily throughout. Two weeks after his suspension was lifted, Sotomayor returned to competition at a small track meet in Montauban, France, which he won with a jump of . Four days later he won a Golden League meet held in Monaco by clearing . Interviewed on French television immediately after his victory, Sotomayor said: &quot;I was not fantastic today. I was very tired because I have been practicing a lot, and I also have a new baby since July, which is another reason why I&#x27;m a little tired. But I should be able to clear 2.36 or 2.37 at the Olympics. I just hope nobody else does 2.40.&quot; Sotomayor cleared 2.32 m, good for the silver medal.

==End of career==
In September 2001, Sotomayor announced that he would end his career, following another positive drug test during a training camp in June, this time for the anabolic steroid nandrolone. He avoided a lifetime ban that would normally follow a second positive test. This second test disqualified his fourth-place finish in his last World Championship. Once again, Sotomayor claimed he was innocent and that mistakes had been made during the handling of his doping test.

These allegations never gained strong support in his home country Cuba, although former IAAF Vice President and Doping Commission Chairman Arne Ljungqvist asserted these were both &quot;crystal clear cases&quot; in a Swedish interview. In a February 2004 interview for Cuban news, Sotomayor said that injury had forced his retirement, not the doping scandal. An Achilles tendon problem hampered his performance, he said, and reduced his run-up from nine steps to seven and then just five.

<text>The Audi A4 is a line of luxury compact executive cars produced since 1994 by the German car manufacturer Audi, a subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group. The A4 has been built in five generations and is based on the Volkswagen Group B platform. The first generation A4 succeeded the Audi 80. The automaker&#x27;s internal numbering treats the A4 as a continuation of the Audi 80 lineage, with the initial A4 designated as the B5-series, followed by the B6, B7, B8, and the B9.

The B8 and B9 versions of the A4 are built on the Volkswagen Group MLB platform shared with several models and brands across the Volkswagen Group. The Audi A4 automobile layout consists of a front-engine design, with transaxle-type transmissions mounted at the rear of the engine. The cars are front-wheel drive, or on some models, &quot;quattro&quot; all-wheel drive. The A4 is available as a sedan and station wagon. Historically, the second (B6) and third generations (B7) of the A4 also included a convertible version. For the B8 and B9 versions, the convertible, along with a new coupé and 5-door liftback variant, was spun-off by Audi into a new nameplate called the Audi A5.

The B9 generation A4 and A5 will be replaced by B10 version of A5, as part of Audi&#x27;s new naming convention.


==B5 (&quot;Typ&quot; 8D; 1994)==


The first generation Audi A4 (known internally as the &quot;Typ&quot; 8D) debuted in October 1994, with production starting November 1994 and European sales commencing in January 1995 for the 1995 model year. North American sales later began in September 1995 for the 1996 model year. It was built on the Volkswagen Group B5 (PL45) platform, which it shared with the fourth generation Volkswagen Passat (B5, &quot;Typ&quot; 3B). It had a front-mounted longitudinal engine and front-wheel drive. Many variations of the A4 were also available with Audi&#x27;s quattro four-wheel drive system. The A4 was initially introduced as a four-door saloon/sedan; the Avant (estate/wagon) was introduced in November 1995 and went on sale in February 1996.

Development began in 1988, with the first design sketches being created later that year. By 1991, an exterior design by Imre Hasanic was chosen and frozen for November 1994 production by 1992. The interior design was later finalized in 1992, with pilot production commencing in the first half of 1994. Development concluded in the third quarter of 1994, preceding November 1994 start of production.

A wide range of engines were available in European markets, between 1.6 and 2.8 litres for petrol engines; and a 1.9-litre diesel engine available with Volkswagen Group&#x27;s VE technology, capable of achieving a or . The 2.6 and 2.8-litre V6 engines which had been carried over from the old 80/90 proved popular, although in North America, the 2.8-litre engine was the only V6 that was available there until 1997. A 2.4-liter version was developed especially for the Thai market, where import duty jumped from 60 to 100 percent on cars of over 2,400 cc displacement.

The Audi A4 was the first model in the Volkswagen Group to feature the new 1.8-litre 20v engine with five valves per cylinder, based on the unit Audi Sport had developed for their Supertouring race car. A turbocharged 1.8T version produced and torque. Moreover, a quattro GmbH special edition of the B5 1.8T was later available in Germany and Europe, for which the engine&#x27;s power output was raised to and . Five-valve technology was also added to a reengineered V6 family of engines in 1997, starting with the 2.8-litre V6 30v, which now produced , followed by a 2.4-litre V6 which was a downsize from the previous 2.6 litre, engine, but with a power increase to .

Audi also debuted their new tiptronic automatic transmission on the B5 platform, based on the unit Porsche developed for their 964-generation 911. The transmission is a conventional automatic gearbox with a torque converter offering the driver a fully-automatic operation or manual selection of the gear ratios.

The B5 marked Audi&#x27;s continued move into the midsize luxury car segment, having started this trajectory notably with later model years of the preceding Audi 80/90 B4. Despite initial mechanical problems, overall build and assembly quality were lauded both by the automotive press and within Audi and Volkswagen, and at the time, parent company Volkswagen declared the B5 the company-wide build quality benchmark for all its other models.

===Facelift (1999–2001)===

The Audi A4 B5 saw nearly constant minor changes and alterations throughout its seven-year run. Moreover, a significant facelift was introduced for the 1998 B5 model year at the 1997 Frankfurt Motor Show, with sales beginning in Europe in early 1998. The 2.8-litre 30-valve V6 engine replaced the 2.8-litre 12-valve. A 2.5-litre V6 Turbocharged Direct Injection diesel engine with was standard on the Quattro. A six-speed manual gearbox was available, as well as the new high-performance Audi S4, now part of the A4 lineup (the previous S4 had been an Audi 100). Cosmetic updates included new rear lights, headlights, door handles, and another minor exterior/interior changes.

In mid-1998, the 1.8 20vT engine available outside Europe had its power output raised to . The previous KKK K03 turbocharger, although fundamentally unchanged, received revisions on the turbine side to prevent cracking due to heat. The 12-valve V6 was replaced by the 30-valve unit which had been available in Europe for two years.

A further facelift took place across the A4 and S4 platform in February 1999 as a 1999.5 model; changes were largely cosmetic but affected many components, such as both front and rear bumpers, the front and rear lights, the center console, and door handles. While outer body shell changes from the pre-facelift model were superficially subtle, it meant that no two body panels were directly interchangeable between each other. This facelift was known at Audi as a &quot;Grosse Produktaufwertung&quot; (&quot;Major Product Upgrade&quot;), as was also signified by facelift cars now carrying the denomination &quot;8D2&quot;.

In 1999 Audi also debuted an even higher performance &quot;RennSport&quot; model (rennsport literally translates as &quot;racing sport&quot;), the RS4 Avant, like its predecessor RS2, available only in the Avant bodystyle.

===Engines===
The following engines were available:

===Safety===
In the Euro NCAP safety and crash tests, the Audi B5 A4 received 3 stars for front- and side-impact protection, but the last star is flagged to indicate that the driver may be subjected to a high risk of chest injury in the side impact.
*Adult occupant = 
*Pedestrian = (pre 2002 rating)

===Derived hybrid version===
In 1997, Audi was the first European car manufacturer to put a hybrid vehicle into mass production, the third generation Audi duo, then based on the A4 Avant.

==B6 (&quot;Typ&quot; 8E/8H; 2000)== 


The next A4, internally designated &quot;Typ&quot; 8E, debuted on 10 October 2000, now riding on the Volkswagen Group B6 (PL46) platform. The car&#x27;s new styling was developed under Peter Schreyer between 1996 and 1998, inspired by the Bauhaus design language of the C5 (second-generation) Audi A6 introduced in 1997. The 1.6-litre base model powerplant remained unchanged, but most other petrol/gasoline engines received either displacement increases, or power upgrades. The 1.8-litre 20-valve Turbo was now available in two additional versions, with or , this one with a standard six-speed manual gearbox, while the naturally aspirated 1.6-litre straight-four engine and 2.8-litre V6 were replaced by 2.0-litre, and all-aluminium alloy 3.0-litre units, still with five valves per cylinder, the most powerful of which was capable of and of torque. The 1.9 Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) engine was upgraded to , with Pumpe Düse (Unit Injector) (PD) technology, and was now available with quattro permanent four-wheel drive, while the 2.5 V6 TDI high-end model was introduced with and standard quattro. This generation of quattro consisted of default of 50:50 front to rear dynamic torque distribution. A Bosch ESP 5.7 Electronic Stability Programme (ESP) system, with anti-lock braking system (ABS), brake assist, and electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD) were standard across the range.

The Avant was introduced in June 2001 and arrived in European showrooms in September 2001.

For 2002, Audi increased power in the 1.8 Turbo engines to and – the 190 PS variant designated by a red &#x27;T&#x27; on the boot lid. Available with four wheel drive and in the 2.5 TDI intermediate version to . A 2.0 engine with Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) was also available. A year later, Audi reintroduced the S4, now powered by a 4.2 L V8 engine, as well as an A4 Cabriolet convertible variant (&quot;Typ&quot; 8H), finally replacing the 80-based Audi Cabriolet which had been discontinued in 2000. It included an electro-hydraulic operated roof, which lowered in under 30 seconds and incorporated some styling changes, such as body-coloured lower bumper and sill panels, which later found their way to the saloon version. The Audi A4 Cabriolet version was co-developed and manufactured by Karmann.

Audi introduced a continuously variable transmission developed by LuK, named multitronic, which replaced the dated conventional automatic transmission on front-wheel drive models. There have been widespread complaints from consumers around the world that the transmission box is prone to electronic glitches as well as mechanical problems.

Borrowing from the Audi A6, the boot was redesigned to remove the extension of the top edge with a smoother fold line. The rear light assemblies now formed part of the top line, these styling cues were eventually borrowed by other European as well as Asian manufacturers.

A sport package named &#x27;Ultra Sport&#x27; was introduced in the North American market shortly before the B6 was replaced by the B7. It included aluminium interior trim and door sills, &quot;S line&quot; steering wheel, front and rear spoilers, side skirts, and quattro GmbH designed 18-inch RS4 alloy wheels.

===Engines===
The following engines were available:
===Safety===
The Audi A4 (B6 &amp; B7) passed the Euro NCAP safety and crash tests, and was awarded the following car safety ratings:&lt;ref name=&quot;euroncap.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*Adult occupant = 
*Pedestrian = (pre 2002 rating)
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) awarded both the B6 &amp; B7 a &quot;Good&quot; rating in the frontal crash test; the B7 was not retested since the front portion is structurally the same.

== B7 (&quot;Typ&quot; 8E/8H; 2004)==


Audi introduced a heavily facelifted A4 in late 2004, with the internal designation of B7. Although given a new platform designation, the B7 was essentially a heavily facelifted and revised version of the B6, with revised steering settings, suspension geometry, new internal combustion engine ranges, navigation systems and chassis electronics (including a new advanced Bosch ESP 8.0 Electronic Stability Programme (ESP) system). The front grille assembly changed to a tall trapezoidal shape in the same manner as the C6 (third-generation) Audi A6; however, the dashboard and interior were virtually unchanged from the B6 aside from minor detailing.

Audi&#x27;s internal platform nomenclature uses PL46 (passenger car longitudinal platform, size 4, generation 6) for both B6 and B7 chassis. The Typ&quot; 8E and Typ&quot; 8H internal designations are also carried over from the B6 A4 range, but now have an additional identifying suffix – 8EC for the saloon, 8ED for the Avant, and 8HE for the Cabriolet.

The engine lineup received many additions. The 2005 introduction of Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) on the 2.0 TFSI and 3.2 V6 FSI petrol/gasoline engines, as well as other refinements, increased power output to and , respectively. These engines both use a four-valve per cylinder configuration. The prior 5-valve design was incompatible with the FSI direct injection system (due to the siting of the fuel injector, now discharging directly into the combustion chamber). The 2.0 Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) diesel engine now combined Pumpe Düse (Unit Injector) (PD) technology with 16 valves, while the larger 2.5 TDI V6 diesel was superseded by a 3.0 V6 TDI, offering a model during the year 2005 which was upgraded to a model in 2006. A 2.7 V6 TDI was added later.

Torsen T-2 based quattro permanent four-wheel drive remained as an option on most A4 models. Audi retained the 5 speed manual transmission with the 1.9 TDI and 2.0 non turbo petrol engines while introducing the 6 speed manual for all higher output variants. As before, multitronic continuously variable transmission (CVT), now with selectable &#x27;seven-speeds&#x27;, was an option on front-wheel drive models, whilst a conventional ZF 6HP 6-speed tiptronic automatic transmission was an option on the quattro four-wheel drive models.

In addition to the Audi S4, which carried over the powertrain from the B6 S4 – Audi reintroduced the quattro GmbH developed Audi RS4 (RS for &quot;RennSport&quot;) to the lineup, for the first time on the saloon/sedan and Cabriolet body, and with a naturally aspirated, but high-revving 4.2-litre V8 FSI engine. Another inclusion on the RS4 was the latest generation Torsen T-3 Quattro 4WD system, which uses a &#x27;default&#x27; asymmetric 40:60 front-rear dynamic torque distribution bias. This new asymmetric center differential was initially only available on the RS4 but was added a year later on the S4. The remainder of the B7 A4 range still used the T-2 50:50 default dynamic split center diff.

A variant, developed by quattro GmbH, was first introduced in May 2005, named &quot;Audi A4 DTM Edition&quot;. It was inspired by Audi&#x27;s race cars of the 2004 Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters and was reintroduced in 2006 as a regular option. The 2.0T FSI engine received revised software mapping to the ECU, which increased the output to and of torque. It was available with front-wheel drive, or Quattro four-wheel drive.

The B7 Cabriolet model arrived later than the other two body variants, being first shown in late 2005 and with sales beginning in February 2006. New on the Cabriolet was an entry-level 2.0 TDI version, which was not offered with the Multitronic CVT gearbox. The Cabriolet version was produced by Karmann until February 2009.

In 2007 Audi introduced a version of the B7 named the &#x27;Special Edition&#x27;, which built on the S-Line specification and also included the black optics pack, the RS4 style 8J X 18 &#x27;7-arm double-spoke&#x27; design alloy wheels, Two-tone Graphite/Black Volterra leather, 3-spoke sports leather/Alcantara multi-function steering wheel with gear knob and hand brake handle in Alcantara with silver stitching, ventilated cross-drilled front disc-brakes, black tailpipes and black roof rails (Avant model only). It also had a power increase of 20 PS, giving an output of 220 PS on the 2.0T model.

According to 2007 Swedish vehicle inspection data, the Audi A4 Avant with diesel engine is the most reliable vehicle available on the market, with vehicle inspection rejection rate of 0.0% in three-year-old category.

=== SEAT Exeo ===
When the successor B8 A4 range was introduced, the B7 series A4 was restyled and rebadged as the SEAT Exeo in 2008 with changes to the front and rear plus interior trim from the A4 Cabriolet. The entire Audi B7 A4 production line from Audi&#x27;s Ingolstadt plant was dismantled and sent to Volkswagen Group&#x27;s SEAT factory in Martorell, Spain.

===Engines===
The following engines were available:

===Safety===
The Audi A4 offers many standard safety features, including Bosch ESP 8.0 Electronic Stability Programme (ESP) with anti-lock braking system (ABS), side airbags in the seats, &#x27;sideguard&#x27; curtain airbags, and its optional quattro four-wheel drive system. It also received the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) &quot;Top Safety Pick For 2007&quot;. EuroNCAP crash test results from the B6 apply to the B7 model. 
==B8 (&quot;Typ&quot; 8K; 2007)==


Audi released the first official pictures of the B8 series A4 in August 2007 and unveiled the car to the public at the September 2007 Frankfurt Motor Show. Saloon/sedan and Avant (estate/wagon) models are offered. The Avant was unveiled to the public at the March 2008 Geneva Motor Show. For North America&#x27;s destined models, the B8 continued in production for the 2016 model year, while Europe began deliveries on the 2016 B9 model.

The B8 A4 is built on a variant of the Audi Modular Longitudinal Platform, a platform that is also used in the Audi A5 coupé. While prior A4 chassis were limited in wheelbase due to the relationship between the engine, transmission and front axle, the MLP allows for a reduced front overhang, resulting in a greater wheelbase length without the same increase in overall length. This effectively redistributes the centre of gravity slightly rearwards, improving handling by better balancing vehicle mass between the front and rear axles. The estimated static front:rear weight ratio of the B8 A4 is approximately 55:45, depending on body style and engine. The relocation of the steering rack in front of the axle also improves handling over previous A4 platforms. Key to the implementation of MLP is the novel mounting of the differential in front of the clutch. This is achieved by driving the flywheel/clutch remotely by means of a &#x27;top hat&#x27; shaped drive plate, between which the differential lay shaft passes, whilst power transmission to the final drive is via an inclined transfer shaft which runs the length of the transmission unit. Whilst the platform retains Audi&#x27;s &quot;overhung&quot; engine mounting position, the front axle is now 152mm further forward than the previous B6/B7 generation platform. The transfer shaft, however, has the effect of creating a large &quot;bulge&quot; on one side of the transmission tunnel, which on right-hand drive versions forces the pedals to be badly offset, which has attracted criticism from the British motoring press in particular.

The B8 A4 has increased in wheelbase by and in length by over the prior B7, which has allowed for increased rear seating legroom. Although the overall dimensions have increased, the curb weight has dropped some 10%. The boot (trunk) has also increased to for the saloon (sedan) version. The A4 Avant will have a maximum capacity of with the rear seats folded down.

Reception has been mixed, with praise for the Audi A4&#x27;s increased size, giving it best-in-class rear legroom and trunk space in the compact executive car segment. Its inline-4 2.0 TFSI engine, while efficient providing plenty of torque, was considered lacking and less refined compared to 6-cylinder engines of lighter rivals who posted faster acceleration times. However, the Audi S4 sports sedan has been well-received for its V6 3.0 TFSI engine&#x27;s power and efficiency.

The B8 A4 was facelifted in early 2012. During a model, cycle changes are made to integrate new technologies and to keep the model competitive. These changes are referenced based on the model year (MY) of the car. In Australia, the B8 has undergone 2 revisions leading to three variants, the B8, B8 MY10 and B8 MY11.

===Body types===
==== Saloon / Sedan ====
Audi released the first official pictures of the B8 series A4 in August 2007 and unveiled the car to the public at the September 2007 Frankfurt Motor Show. Saloon/sedan and Avant (estate/wagon) models are offered.

====Avant====
The Avant station wagon/estate was presented at the March 2008 Geneva Motor Show.

====A4 allroad quattro====
The A4 Allroad Quattro is based upon the Avant but features a wider track, increased ground clearance, Quattro permanent four-wheel drive, a distinctive radiator grille, stainless steel underbody guards and roof rails.

The A4 allroad quattro was made available in early summer 2009. The car was unveiled in 2009 Geneva Motor Show.

====A4L====
The A4L is a long-wheelbase version of the sedan/saloon for the Chinese market, with a longer wheelbase and length. The vehicle was presented at the 2008 Guangzhou Motor Show. The production version then went on sale in January 2009. Launch models included a 2.0 TFSI with and the 3.2 FSI with .

===Specifications===

====Body styles====
The A4-based convertible models were replaced by the A5/S5 Cabriolet.

===Engines===
The B8 powertrain options are the following: engines, transmissions and drivelines: 


The quattro permanent four-wheel drive system uses the latest Torsen T-3 centre differential, with a default 40:60 front to rear asymmetric torque distribution ratio (used first on the B7 RS4) as standard. (Previous A4 Quattro models split torque with a default front:rear 50:50). The additional torque bias applied to the rear wheels helps mimic the driving dynamics of rear-wheel drive cars.

Audi was reported to stop offering 3.2L V6 models in 2010 model year, but still offers them as of August 2011 (Germany).

All petrol engines use Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI), and all diesel engines use the common rail fuel delivery (with a pressure of ), with piezo injectors of their Turbocharged Direct Injection engines.

With the 2012 facelift (the B8.5) came additional 163ps TDIe and TDI Ultra engines, the latter requiring the addition of adblue allowing for cleaner running, both of which fell into the lower emissions tax bracket for the UK, yet presenting a significant performance improvement over the base 136ps and mid-range 143ps models.

====Transmissions====
In 2009, Audi announced the seven-speed S-Tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission as an option for A4 in the UK and European markets.

All A4L models include Speed 8 multitronic continuously variable/manual transmission, except for A4L 3.2 FSI quattro, which includes Tiptronic automatic transmission.

Volkswagen settled a class-action lawsuit in 2013 involving the failures of the CVT transmission in its Audi A4 and A6 automobiles for model years 2002–2006.

===Facelift (2012–2015)===

The facelift model of the Audi A4 was released in 2012 for the 2013 model year. It features redesigned LED headlamps and taillights, front air dam with fog lamps, and closely set twin exhausts. Interior changes include Bluetooth connectivity for audio streaming (nav equipped models only) and a redesigned ignition key. Controls for air-conditioning, infotainment, and power windows gain chrome clasps. Other detail interior changes include larger steering column stalk switches first seen in the D4-series Audi A8 and a simplified layout for the HVAC control panel – for example the temperature setting for the heated seats is now directly set by a single button and is no longer controlled using the MMI dial. The A4 includes a radio with eight speakers as standard, while the MMI navigation system with voice dialogue is optional. A new &quot;Drive Select System&quot; allows drivers to choose comfort, dynamic, individual, or efficiency modes for fuel-efficiency. The power output of the 1.8 TFSI engine is 170 BHP and 320 Nm of torque – up 10 BHP and 70 Nm from the previous versions. Electromechanical power steering is standard.

In Europe, the wide range of Audi A4 saloon and Avant estate are available with the 1.8 TFSI, 2.0 TFSI, and 3.0 TFSI gasoline engines (same 7-speed S tronic and 3.0 TFSI supercharged V6 as the Audi S4 but detuned to 272bhp and 292lb ft of torque in the A4 3.0 TFSI) Twin Test: BMW 335i Vs Audi A4 3.0 TFSI…, as well as 2.0 TDI, 2.0 TDIe, and 3.0 TDI diesel motors. Trim levels are Attraction, Ambition, and Ambiente. In the UK, the A4 range is offered in SE, SE Technik, Technik, S line, and Black Edition model grades. All-wheel-drive Quattro is offered in most engine and grade combinations.

For North America, the facelift model Audi A4 sedan is only offered with a 2.0 TFSI turbocharged inline-4 gasoline engine, while the performance upgrade remains the Audi S4 with a 3.0 TFSI supercharged V6 gasoline engine, and no diesel engines were offered. Model grades are Premium, Premium Plus, and Prestige. The Avant was discontinued, leaving the Allroad Quattro as the only station wagon body style. For the 2016 model year, the A4 and S4 continued in B8 production. The B9 A4 would not reach the North American market until the 2017 model year, while the S4 variant would not be available until the 2018 model year.

==B9 (&quot;Typ&quot; 8W; 2015)==
The fifth-generation of the A4 was revealed in June 2015 when pre-production versions were released to the motoring press, with the official launch occurring at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 2015. This generation of the A4 is the fifth to carry the A4 badge and is commonly referred to as the B9, representing the ninth generation of the Audi 80/A4 series, which were originally (but no longer) based on the B platform. The B9 is slightly larger than the outgoing B8, but Audi claims the new A4 is around lighter than its predecessor due to the use of its new lightweight aluminum-hybrid construction. The B9 also comes with a number of A4 firsts such as virtual cockpit, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, full-color head-up display, and Audi pre-sense.

=== Trims ===
The Audi A4 launched with three petrol, and four diesel engines. US models received only the gasoline versions which consisted of the base 2.0L turbo found in the ultra model, the standard 2.0L turbo in the standard grades, and the V6 engines offered in the S4 and RS4 (3.0L and 2.9L respectively). The Ultra introduced Audi&#x27;s new high efficiency variant of the EA888 that achieves best in class fuel economy through the use of an increased compression ratio engine (9.6:1 to 11.7:1) with shorter compression and longer-expansion phases. It sends this power through a 7-Speed dual-clutch powering the front wheels only. This allows the A4 to achieve an EPA rating of 27 city/37 highway/31 combined. This variant was only offered until 2020 at which point it was rebranded to the 40 TFSI. Performance figures are shown under the engine variants below.

Available model grades are Premium, Premium Plus, Ultra Premium, Ultra Premium Plus and Prestige. Ultra models featured improved fuel efficiency and reduced emissions, and were only available in the FWD configuration. Every other model was available in either FWD or Quattro. The S Line and Black Optic packages were also made available. The S Line package uses skirts, bumpers, seats and wheels from the Audi S4, and adds an aluminum inlay to the interior consoles. The Black Optic package, or Black Edition, also uses the S4&#x27;s body kit, but replaces the exterior&#x27;s chrome trim with black counterparts.

A slight facelift was introduced in 2019, featuring new front and rear bumpers inspired by the Audi RS 4. Additionally, the Titanium model grade was introduced to replace the Ultra Premium and Ultra Premium Plus models.

==== US Launch Editions and Prices ====
=== Facelift (2020-2025) ===
The facelift model, also known as the B9.5, was made available in 2020. It brought the A4&#x27;s aesthetic in line with the S4, A6, A7 and A8. In addition to redesigned headlights and taillights, almost every body panel on the A4 was altered, with only the hood, trunk and roof remaining untouched. Notably, the character line that ran the length of the A4 was removed, with creases added to the front and rear fenders in its place. While the interior was largely untouched, the mechanical controls for the infotainment center were replaced with a touchscreen and larger display. Following the facelift, the A4 and S4 now share their body panels, with their grilles and badges being the only external distinctions between the models.

Post-facelift, the Titanium model was removed from production, leaving only the Premium, Premium Plus and Prestige model grades. Additionally, US delivered Post-facelift A4&#x27;s are only available in the Quattro configuration. Whereas front wheel drive continued to be available for the rest of the world. Noting that the B9.5 introduced Quattro-Ultra technology, a system which can disconnect the all wheel drive to save fuel during specific driving conditions, thus negating the disadvantage of Quattro&#x27;s additional fuel consumption. The Black Optic and S Line packages also return for select models. The Black Optic package can be equipped on any Premium Plus or Prestige Model, while the S Line model can be applied to any Premium Plus or Prestige Model with a 45 TFSI engine. The S Line package makes no changes to the exterior beyond its badging, as the A4 and S4 now share their body kits. It instead provides an aluminum inlay for the interior, improved seats, and stainless steel pedals.

In addition to the above packages, Audi also manufactures aftermarket accessories for the A4, including decals, spoilers, mirror caps and tail pipes.

===Engines===

Seven engines are available from launch, three petrol, and four diesel. All are available in both the A4 Saloon and A4 Avant. The figures below are for the saloon only.

<text>Ciudad Guzmán (also known as simply Guzmán) is a city in the Mexican state of Jalisco. 
It is located south of Guadalajara, at a height of above sea level. Its population totaled 97,750 in the 2010 census, ranking as the eighth-largest city in the state.

Ciudad Guzmán is the municipal seat of Zapotlán el Grande municipality, which has an area of 295.29 km2 (114.0 sq.mi). The municipality&#x27;s population was 115,141 in the 2020 census.

==History==
Prior to the arrival of the European Spanish Conquistadors, this area was part of the pre-Columbian kingdom of Zapotlán and was at different times under the domain of the nearby kingdoms of Colima and Michoacán.

Zapotlán el Grande was conquered in 1526. Many treasures and weapons are said to be buried throughout the town&#x27;s old colonial homes, buildings, and farms.

In the mid-19th century, the name of the town was changed from Zapotlán el Grande to Ciudad Guzmán, after the Mexican federalist insurgent Gordiano de Guzmán.

The town has been nicknamed the &quot;Athens of Jalisco&quot; because it&#x27;s the birthplace of several well-known intellectuals and artists, including the muralist José Clemente Orozco, the composer Consuelo Velázquez, the scientist José María Arreola and the journalist and historian Juan José Arreola.

The oldest part of the city, in the downtown area, holds a major stone Cathedral (Catedral de San José) that local folklore says is haunted. Ciudad Guzmán is located in an area of high seismic activity. The cathedral&#x27;s towers have tumbled down several times due to earthquakes, sometimes killing people, and their souls are said to guard the place.

The last time the towers collapsed was on September 19, 1985, during the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, an earthquake of magnitude 8.1 that has come to be considered one of the most devastating natural disasters of the 20th century. In Guzmán City, it left more than 50 people dead and about 1,000 injured. The cathedral towers were never rebuilt to their majestic height.

==Geography==
The city is located south of Guadalajara, at a height of above sea level.

In 1894, Carlisle and Finch purchased the shop from General Electric, intending to continue the repair business and branch out into manufacturing. The new company was incorporated on April 17, 1897, with Carlisle serving as president. The same year, they introduced their first new products, a searchlight based on the carbon arc principle, and a toy train, which also used a carbon arc for its headlight. As the company grew, they added gasoline engines.

Carlisle sold his share of the business to Finch on August 4, 1926. Brent S. Finch, Robert&#x27;s son, was named president, and the company started concentrating entirely on its searchlight business. After World War II, Brent R. Finch (son of Brent S.) was hired, at which point three generations of Finches were simultaneously employed by the company. , a fourth-generation leads the company, with brothers Kurtis B. Finch and Garth S. Finch serving as president and senior vice president, respectively.

A subsidiary company, C&amp;F Polishing, provides metal polishing and restoration services.

== Toy trains ==

One of Carlisle &amp; Finch&#x27;s earliest products was electric toy trains, and they were the first company to manufacture them in America. The wood and metal trains entered the marketplace . They were approximately tall and ran on metal track with rails apart, known as 2 gauge.

Other American companies made toy trains before Carlisle &amp; Finch. Edward Ives, for example, had a factory in Plymouth, Connecticut, in 1896. These other makers used wind-up clockworks, steam, electric batteries, or overhead wires to power the cars. Carlisle &amp; Finch&#x27;s innovation was to use the two rails as electrical conductors although this technology had been demonstrated as early as 1851 by Thomas Hall.

In 1897, they made a train set with a 4-wheel coal mining locomotive, three coal cars, two zinc-carbon elements, and a can of chromite. The locomotive included a switch for starting and reversing, and was powerful enough to pull the three loaded cars up a grade. That same year, they also made an &quot;electric railway with double truck car&quot; set, with a car running on two 4-wheel trucks. It was long, high, and wide, and made of polished brass with iron wheels. It had two motors and could run at . Both sets included of gauge track.

== Searchlights ==

When World War I started, production was shifted entirely to searchlights, to aid the war effort. The U.S. Government was a major purchaser, with additional large orders from Greece, Spain, Norway, and Russia. By 1917, it was one of the few companies worldwide producing searchlights, and had supplied a large proportion of the searchlights then in use by the United States and other countries. They produced a line of commercial searchlights, and also specialized in navy and military designs. Units were built with diameters, and ranges. Current draw was 10 to 200 amps.

The earliest models used a carbon arc for the light source. Other companies had previously built carbon arc searchlights, but Carlisle &amp; Finch added the innovation of mounting the carbon electrodes horizontally on the beam axis. The tip of the positive carbon faced the reflector, maximizing the amount of light reflected, and spacing of the carbons was adjusted by motorized screw-feed mechanisms. A manually-activated screw moved the entire mechanism forward and backward, positioning the arc at the mirror&#x27;s focal point. A pair of carbons had a lifetime of about seven hours.

The company introduced Xenon arc searchlights in the 1960s. LED models followed in 2019.

==Navigation beacons==
Distinct from searchlights, Carlisle &amp; Finch also produced rotating beacons in the DCB (Directional Code Beacon) series starting around 1950. These project a narrow light beam. The light rotates, causing it to appear to flash from the viewpoint of a distant observer. These were originally used as aerodrome beacons, but in the 1990s, the U.S. Coast Guard adopted them for use in lighthouses, replacing existing Fresnel lenses. Models included DCB-24 with a diameter, DCB-224 with two such lights, and DCB-36 with a diameter.

 the DCB-24 and DCB-224 were the standard optics used in landfall lights (the first lights seen when approaching the coast from the open sea). They have a nominal range of depending on the rotation speed and whether a colored cover was installed. They could operate in winds up to , and included an automatic lamp changer.

== Other products ==

In 1897, Carlisle &amp; Finch offered a hand-powered dynamo, capable of lighting a ten candle power, ten volt incandescent bulb, or to run several electrical toys simultaneously. They also offered a water-powered version, which produced a similar amount of electrical power from a water faucet supplying of pressure and could be used with as low as .

In 1912, they introduced a dynamo driven by a directly connected gasoline motor. The engine was , and the dynamo produced 42 volts at 15 amps. A belt pulley was included for driving an external load. The entire assembly weighed .

In 1923, a clothes dryer was introduced. The device used a wire mesh drum rotated by an electric motor. Air heated by either gas or steam was forced through the drum, with the temperature controlled by a thermostat. The machine was deep, wide, tall, and weighed .

<text>James Steven Stirling (born November 19, 1949) is a scout with the Ottawa Senators of the National Hockey League. He is the former head coach of the American Hockey League&#x27;s Norfolk Admirals, Bridgeport Sound Tigers, the Springfield Falcons and the National Hockey League&#x27;s New York Islanders.

==Career==
Before coaching the Norfolk Admirals to their worst finish in franchise history, Stirling spent a season and a half as coach of the New York Islanders before his dismissal in January 2006, though he led the Islanders to an impressive record of 38–29–11–4 in his first season as an NHL head coach. In the NHL playoffs, the Islanders were beaten by the eventual Stanley Cup-winning Tampa Bay Lightning in five games.

Stirling has also played centre for various teams in the NCAA, AHL and NAHL. He was the firsthead coach of the Bridgeport Sound Tigers, where he led Bridgeport to a Regular Season title in his first season. He also coached the Springfield Falcons, Babson College and Providence College and as assistant coach of the Islanders and the Lowell Lock Monsters. While in college, Stirling never had a losing season. He is also one of the few people to coach at three different levels of NCAA hockey.

After the disappointing season with the Admirals, general manager Jay Feaster announced that Stirling would not be the coach heading into the 2008–09 AHL season. Stirling was given a job as a scout for the team. On June 16, 2008, the German DEL club Iserlohn Roosters announced that Stirling had signed a two-year contract as its head coach. After 44 games and an 0–6 series, he was dismissed by the Roosters on February 5, 2009.

Stirling was signed as an assistant coach of the Binghamton Senators (the Ottawa Senators&#x27; farm team) in 2009. The Binghamton Senators won the AHL&#x27;s Calder Cup one season later.

==Personal==
Stirling is the father of former minor-league goaltender Scott Stirling and former Professional Head Coach Todd Stirling, who coached the Danbury Trashers.

<doc id="661947" wikidata="Q168572" url="?curid=661947" title="Project A119">
<text>Project A119, also known as A Study of Lunar Research Flights, was a top-secret plan developed in 1958 by the United States Air Force. The aim of the project was to detonate a nuclear bomb on the Moon, which would help in answering some of the mysteries in planetary astronomy and astrogeology. If the explosive device detonated on the surface, and not in a lunar crater, the flash of explosive light would have been faintly visible to people on Earth with their naked eye. This was meant as a show of force resulting in a possible boosting of domestic morale in the capabilities of the United States, a boost that was needed after the Soviet Union took an early lead in the Space Race.

The project was never carried out, being cancelled after &quot;Air Force officials decided its risks outweighed its benefits&quot;, and because a Moon landing would undoubtedly be a more popular achievement in the eyes of the American and international public alike. If executed, the plan might have led to a potential militarization of space. An identical project by the Soviet Union (Project E-4) also never came to fruition due to fears of the warhead falling back on Soviet territory, and the potential for an international incident.

The existence of the US project was revealed in 2000 by a former executive at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Leonard Reiffel, who had led the project in 1958. A young Carl Sagan was part of the team responsible for predicting the effects of a nuclear explosion in vacuum and low gravity, and evaluating the scientific value of the project. The relevant documents remained secret for nearly 45 years and, despite Reiffel&#x27;s revelations, the United States government has never officially acknowledged its involvement in the study.

==Background==
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union took the lead in the Space Race with the launch of Sputnik 1 on 4October 1957. &quot;Sputnik&quot; was the first artificial satellite in orbit around the Earth, and the surprise of its successful launch, compounded by the resounding failure of Project Vanguard to launch an American satellite after two attempts, had been dubbed the &quot;Sputnik crisis&quot; by the media and was the impetus for the beginning of the Space Race. Trying to reclaim lost ground, the United States embarked on a series of new studies and projects, which eventually included the launch of Explorer 1, the creation of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and NASA.

==Project==
In 1949, the Armour Research Foundation (ARF), based at the Illinois Institute of Technology, began studying the effects of nuclear explosions on the environment. Those studies continued until 1962. In May 1958, ARF began covertly researching the potential consequences of a nuclear explosion on the Moon. The main objective of the program, running under the auspices of the United States Air Force which had initially proposed it, was to cause a nuclear explosion that would be visible from Earth. It was hoped that such a display would boost the morale of the American people.

At the time of the project&#x27;s conception, newspapers were reporting a rumor that the Soviet Union was planning to detonate a hydrogen bomb on the Moon. According to press reports in late 1957, an anonymous source had divulged to a United States Secret Service agent that the Soviets planned to commemorate the anniversary of the October Revolution by causing a nuclear explosion on the Moon to coincide with a lunar eclipse on 7 November. News reports of the rumored launch included mention of targeting the dark side of the terminator—Project A119 would also consider this boundary as the target for an explosion. It was also reported that a failure to hit the Moon would likely result in the missile returning to Earth.

A similar idea had been put forward by Edward Teller, the &quot;father of the H-bomb&quot;, who, in February 1957, proposed the detonation of nuclear devices both on and some distance from the lunar surface to analyze the effects of the explosion.

===Research===
A ten-member team, led by Leonard Reiffel, was assembled at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago to study the potential visibility of the explosion, the benefits to science, and the implications for the lunar surface. Among the members of the research team were astronomer Gerard Kuiper and his doctoral student Carl Sagan. Sagan was responsible for the mathematical projection of the expansion of a dust cloud in space around the Moon, an essential element in determining its visibility from Earth.

Scientists initially considered using a hydrogen bomb for the project, but the United States Air Force vetoed that idea due to the weight of such a device, because it would be too heavy to be propelled by the missile which would have been used. It was then decided to use a W25 warhead, a small, lightweight warhead with a relatively low 1.7 kiloton yield. By contrast, the Little Boy bomb dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima in 1945 had a yield of 13–18 kilotons. The W25 would be carried by a rocket toward the shadowed side of the Moon where it would detonate on impact. The dust cloud resulting from the explosion would be lit by the Sun and therefore visible from Earth. According to Reiffel, the Air Force&#x27;s progress in the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles would have made such a launch feasible by 1959.

===Cancellation===
The project was canceled by the Air Force in January 1959, seemingly out of fear of the risk to the population if anything went wrong with the launch. Another factor, cited by project leader Leonard Reiffel, was the possible problem of nuclear fallout which would affect future lunar research projects and Moon colonization.

==Evidence of the Soviet project==
Later reports in the 2010s showed that a corresponding Soviet project did indeed exist, although the only official documents on the project found so far began in 1958, not the 1957 date of the &quot;anonymous&quot; source whose rumors initiated the US project. The official Soviet plan also differs from the scenario reported in the press. Started in January 1958, it was part of a series of proposals under the codename &quot;E&quot;. Project E-1 entailed plans to reach the Moon, while projects E-2 and E-3 involved sending a probe around the far side of the Moon to take a series of photographs of its surface. The final stage of the project, E-4, was to be a nuclear strike on the Moon, as a display of force. As with the American plan, the E series of projects was canceled while still in its planning stages, due to concerns regarding the safety and reliability of the launch vehicle.

==Consequences==
The signing of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963 and the Outer Space Treaty in 1967 prevented future investigation of the concept of detonating a nuclear device on the Moon. By that time, both the United States and the Soviet Union had performed several high-altitude nuclear explosions, including the American Operation Hardtack I, Operation Argus, Operation Fishbowl, and the Soviet Project K.

By 1969, the United States had succeeded in being the first nation to land a man on the moon with the success of the Apollo 11 Moon mission. In December of that year, Apollo scientist Gary Latham suggested detonating a &quot;smallish&quot; nuclear device on the Moon in order to facilitate research into its geological make-up. The idea was dismissed because it would interfere with plans to measure the Moon&#x27;s natural background radiation.

The existence of Project A119 remained largely secret until the mid-1990s, when writer Keay Davidson discovered the story while researching the life of Carl Sagan for a biography. Sagan&#x27;s involvement with the project was apparent from his application for an academic scholarship at the Miller Institute of the University of California, Berkeley, in 1959. In the application, Sagan gave details of the project research, which Davidson felt constituted a violation of national security. The leak consisted of Sagan revealing the titles of two classified papers from the A119 project — the 1958 paper &quot;Possible Contribution of Lunar Nuclear Weapons Detonations to the Solution of Some Problems in Planetary Astronomy&quot;, and the 1959 paper &quot;Radiological Contamination of the Moon by Nuclear Weapons Detonations&quot;. A 1958 paper titled &quot;Cosmic Radiation and Lunar Radioactivity&quot;, credited to I. Filosofo, was also named by Sagan in a 1961 paper written for the United States National Research Council. These were among the eight reports created by the project, all of which were destroyed in 1987.

The resulting biography, &quot;Carl Sagan: A Life&quot;, was published in 1999. Shortly after, a review published in &quot;Nature&quot; highlighted the discovery of the leaked information. That led Reiffel to break his anonymity and write a letter to the journal confirming that Sagan&#x27;s activity had at the time been considered a breach of the confidentiality of the project. Reiffel took the opportunity to reveal details of the studies, and his statements were widely reported in the media. Reiffel&#x27;s revelation of the project was accompanied by his denunciation of the work carried out, with the scientist noting that he was &quot;horrified that such a gesture to sway public opinion was ever considered&quot;.

As a result of the publicity the correspondence created, a freedom of information request was lodged concerning Project A119. It was only then that &quot;A Study of Lunar Research Flights – Volume I&quot; was made public, over 40 years after its inception. A search for the other volumes of documentation revealed that other reports were destroyed in the 1980s by the Illinois Institute of Technology.

David Lowry, a nuclear historian from the United Kingdom, has called the project&#x27;s proposals &quot;obscene&quot;, adding, &quot;had they gone ahead, we would never have had the romantic image of Neil Armstrong taking &#x27;one giant leap for mankind.

<doc id="661952" wikidata="Q5382132" url="?curid=661952" title="Ephebic oath">
<text>The ephebic oath was an oath sworn by young men of Classical Athens, typically eighteen-year-old sons of Athenian citizens, upon induction into the military academy, the Ephebic College, graduation from which was required to attain status as citizens. The applicant would have been dressed in full armour, shield and spear in his left hand, his right hand raised and touching the right hand of the moderator. The oath was quoted by the Attic orator Lycurgus, in his work &quot;Against Leocrates&quot; (4th century BC), though it is certainly archaic (5th century BC). The &quot;Ephebate&quot;, an organization for training the young men of Athens, chiefly in military matters, had existed since the 5th century but was reorganized by Lycurgus. The oath was taken in the temple of Aglaurus, daughter of Cecrops, probably at the age of eighteen when the youth underwent an examination (Greek: δοκιμασία) and had his name entered on the deme register. He was then an ephebos until the age of twenty.

==The oath==
The ephebic oath is preserved on an inscription from Acharnae, which was written in the mid-fourth century BC. Other versions of the oath are preserved in the works of Stobaeus and Pollux.

=== Greek text ===
This is the oath, as preserved by Stobaeus.

=== English translation ===
I will never bring reproach upon my hallowed arms, nor will I desert the comrade at whose side I stand, but I will defend our altars and our hearths, single-handed or supported by many. My native land I will not leave a diminished heritage but greater and better than when I received it. I will obey whoever is in authority and submit to the established laws and all others which the people shall harmoniously enact. If anyone tries to overthrow the constitution or disobeys it, I will not permit him, but will come to its defense, single-handed or with the support of all. I will honor the religion of my fathers. Let the gods be my witness, Agraulus, Enyalius, Ares, Zeus, Thallo, Auxo, Hegemone.

==Modern use==
The oath has been revived for use in educational institutions worldwide as a statement of civic virtue.

<doc id="661970" wikidata="Q1272707" url="?curid=661970" title="Doujin">
<text>In Japan, a is a group of people who share an interest, activity, or hobby. The word is sometimes translated into English as &quot;clique&quot;, &quot;fandom&quot;, &quot;coterie&quot;, &quot;society&quot;, or &quot;circle&quot; (as in &quot;sewing circle&quot;). Self-published creative works produced by these groups are also called &quot;doujin&quot;, including manga, magazines, novels, music (&quot;doujin&quot; music), anime, merch, and video games (&quot;doujin&quot; soft). Print &quot;doujin&quot; works are collectively called &quot;doujinshi&quot;.

&quot;Doujin&quot; works are typically amateur and derivative in nature, though some professional artists participate in &quot;doujin&quot; culture as a way to publish material outside the regular publishing industry.

Annual research by the research agency Media Create indicated that, of the 186¥ billion (US$1.66 billion) in revenue seen by the otaku industry in 2007, &quot;doujin&quot; sales made up 14.9% (US$274 million).

== Literary societies ==
Literary circles first appeared in the Meiji period when groups of like-minded &quot;waka&quot; writers, poets and novelists met and published literary magazines (many of which are still publishing today). Many modern writers in Japan came from these literary circles. One famous example is Ozaki Koyo, who led the Kenyusha society of literary writers that first published collected works in magazine form in 1885.

== Manga circles ==
After World War II, manga &quot;doujin&quot; started to appear in Japan. Manga artists like Shotaro Ishinomori (&quot;Kamen Rider&quot;, &quot;Cyborg 009&quot;) and Fujio Fujiko (&quot;Doraemon&quot;) formed &quot;doujin&quot; groups such as Fujiko&#x27;s . At this time, &quot;doujin&quot; groups were used by artists to make a professional debut. This changed in the coming decades with &quot;doujin&quot; groups forming as school clubs and the like. This culminated in 1975 with Comiket in Tokyo.

== Today ==
Avid fans of &quot;doujin&quot; attend regular &quot;doujin&quot; conventions, the largest of which is called Comiket (a portmanteau of &quot;Comic Market&quot;) held in the summer and winter at Tokyo Big Sight. Here, over of &quot;doujin&quot; materials are bought, sold, and traded by attendees. &quot;Doujin&quot; creators who base their materials on other creators&#x27; works normally publish in small numbers to maintain a low profile from litigation. This makes a talented creator&#x27;s or circle&#x27;s products a coveted commodity as only the fast or the lucky will be able to get them before they sell out.

Over the last decade, the practice of creating &quot;doujin&quot; has expanded significantly, attracting thousands of creators and fans alike. Advances in personal publishing technology have also fueled this expansion by making it easier for &quot;doujin&quot; creators to write, draw, promote, publish, and distribute their works.

== Western perception ==
In Western cultures, &quot;doujin&quot; are often perceived to be derivative of existing work, analogous to fan fiction. To an extent, this is true: many &quot;doujin&quot; are based on popular manga, anime, or video game series. However, many &quot;doujin&quot; consisting of original content also exist. Among the numerous &quot;doujin&quot; categories, are the ones getting the most exposure outside Japan, as well as within Japan, where &quot;doujinshi&quot; are by tradition the most popular and numerous &quot;doujin&quot; products.

== Types ==
* &quot;Doujinshi&quot;: Printed works such as comics, novels, and magazines.
* : games, software
* : music
* : goods
* , is a form of &quot;doujin&quot; which is sexually explicit in nature and even pornographic (hentai).

<doc id="661982" wikidata="Q358613" url="?curid=661982" title="Tom Renney">
<text>Thomas Renney (born March 1, 1955) is a Canadian former ice hockey coach and executive. He served as the chief executive officer of Hockey Canada from 2014 to 2022, and was previously an associate coach with the National Hockey League&#x27;s Detroit Red Wings and also served as head coach of the Vancouver Canucks, New York Rangers, and Edmonton Oilers.

Renney began his coaching career in the Western Hockey League (WHL), capturing a Memorial Cup in his two-year stint with the Kamloops Blazers. In addition to the Rangers, he has also previously coached the Vancouver Canucks for two seasons. He has participated in the coaching staff for Canada&#x27;s national teams on numerous occasions, capturing a silver medal as the head coach at the 1994 Winter Olympics.

==Coaching career==
===Kamloops Blazers===
Renney began his career behind the bench in the major junior ranks with the Kamloops Blazers of the Western Hockey League (WHL) in 1990–91. He immediately established success at the junior level, leading the club to consecutive President&#x27;s Cup championships as WHL champions and a Memorial Cup as Canadian Hockey League (CHL) champions. In his two seasons with the Blazers, Renney compiled a 101-37-6 record for a .714 winning percentage, which ranks as the all-time highest winning mark in CHL history.

===Vancouver Canucks===
Renney earned his first National Hockey League (NHL) coaching stint in 1996–97 with the Vancouver Canucks. He replaced Pat Quinn, who had himself taken over coaching duties from Rick Ley for the final six games of the previous season before returning to his general manager duties. He finished with a 35-40-7 record in his only full season with the Canucks, before being fired 19 games into the 1997–98 season. He was replaced by Mike Keenan.

===New York Rangers===
Renney began his tenure in the New York Rangers organization as Director of Player Personnel, where he oversaw all facets of the team&#x27;s amateur scouting operation, while assisting with the professional scouting department. He was promoted to Vice President of Player Development on June 21, 2002. He was instrumental in establishing an off-season conditioning and skills camp for several Rangers prospects in Calgary, Alberta, and then in New York City at the Madison Square Garden Training Center.

Renney was appointed the Rangers&#x27; head coach with twenty games left in the 2003–04 regular season, succeeding Glen Sather who wanted to concentrate on his general manager duties. He led the team into the postseason in each of the three campaigns after the 2004–05 NHL lockout. The farthest the Rangers advanced in the playoffs was the Eastern Conference Semifinals (2nd round) in 2007 and 2008.

In 2009, Renney was the subject of an Internet parody, The Ranger Line Generator, that focused on the coaches&#x27; strategic shuffling of player line combinations. The website allowed users to create random line combinations based on the 2008–09 Ranger roster. The Line Generator also points out Renney&#x27;s perceived misuse of Petr Průcha.

With the underachieving Rangers stuck in a 2–7–3 slump and in danger of missing the postseason for the first time since prior to the lockout, Renney was fired from his duties on February 23, 2009, and replaced by TSN analyst and former Tampa Bay Lightning head coach John Tortorella, who served as the interim head coach for the last 4 games of the 1999-2000 season. The club also dismissed assistant coach Perry Pearn, but retained fellow assistant coach Mike Pelino and goaltending coach Benoit Allaire. The move came immediately after the Rangers dropped a 3-2 overtime decision to the Toronto Maple Leafs at Madison Square Garden on February 22 (Howell-Bathgate Night). Renney left the Rangers fourth overall on the club&#x27;s all-time wins list for head coaches with 164.

===Edmonton Oilers===

Renney was named associate coach of the Edmonton Oilers on May 26, 2009, and was named head coach of the Oilers on June 22, 2010, once again replacing Pat Quinn. On May 17, 2012, the Edmonton Oilers Management announced that his contract would not be renewed for the 2012–2013 season.

===Detroit Red Wings===
Renney was named associate coach of the Detroit Red Wings on July 5, 2012 under Mike Babcock.

===International career===
Renney served as head coach of the Canada men&#x27;s national team that won a silver medal at the 1994 Winter Olympics. He was an assistant coach of the national team that won a gold medal at the 1994 World Championships. As head coach of the national team, he won bronze at the 1995 World Championships, and silver at the 1996 World Championships. At the 1999 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, he won a silver medal as head coach of the Canada men&#x27;s national junior team. He later served as an assistant coach for the Canada men&#x27;s national team which won silver medals at the 2004 IIHF World Championship, and the 2005 IIHF World Championship.

Renney served as chairman of the International Ice Hockey Federation coaching committee from 2015 to 2022.

==Hockey Canada executive==
Renney served as vice-president of hockey operations for Hockey Canada from 1998 to 2000, then became president and chief executive officer (CEO) in July 2014. In July 2017, he appointed Scott Smith as president and remained as CEO. Renney retired as CEO on July 1, 2022, and was succeeded by Scott Smith.

During his tenure as CEO, Renney helped guide the Canada men&#x27;s national team, Canada women&#x27;s national team, and national para team to 28 medals in international competition, including nine gold, fifteen silver and four bronze medals.

==Personal life==
Renney attended the University of North Dakota and received a degree in physical education. He married Glenda Gare, the sister of former NHL player Danny Gare. They first met when Tom owned a clothing store in Trail, British Columbia. Renney and his wife have two daughters. His other brother-in-law, Morey Gare, was the Edmonton Oilers head pro scout until 2015.

<text>A piano sextet is a composition for piano and five other musical instruments, or a group of six musicians who perform such works. There is no standard grouping of instruments with that name, and compared to the string quartet or piano quintet literature, relatively few such compositions exist. The best-known piano sextet is probably the &quot;Sextet&quot; by Poulenc, one of the pinnacles of the wind and piano repertoire. Chausson&#x27;s &quot;Concert&quot; is widely regarded as one of the masterpieces of French strings and piano chamber music literature (for example, the critic Jean Gallois describes it as &quot;superb&quot;).

The following is an incomplete list of piano sextet composers and their works in this genre:

* Theodor Blumer (1881-1964), Sextet, Op. 45, composed 1921, for piano and wind quintet
* Philippe Boesmans (1936–2022), Sextuor à clavier, composed 2005, for piano and string quintet
* Ernest Chausson (1855–1899), &quot;Concert&quot; in D major, Op. 21, composed 1891, for piano, violin, and string quartet
* Aaron Copland (1900–1990), Sextet, composed 1938, for piano, clarinet, and string quartet
* Ernst von Dohnányi (1877–1960), Sextet for string trio, clarinet, horn, and piano
* Louise Farrenc (1804–1875), Sextet in C minor, op. 40, composed 1852, for piano and wind quintet
* Mikhail Glinka (1804–1857)
**Grand Sextet (&quot;Sestetto originale&quot;) in E-flat major, composed 1832, for piano, string quartet, and double bass
**Serenade (&quot;Divertimento brillante&quot;) on Themes from Bellini&#x27;s &quot;La Sonnambula&quot; in A-flat major, composed 1832, for piano, string quartet, and double bass
* Hans Huber (1852-1921) Sextet in B-flat major, composed 1898, for piano and wind quintet
* Vincent d&#x27;Indy (1851-1931), Sarabande et Menuet, Op. 72 for piano and wind quintet, arranged 1918 by the composer from his earlier Suite dans le style ancien, Op. 24 (1886) for 2 flutes, trumpet and string quartet
* Gordon Jacob (1895–1984), Sextet in B-flat major, composed 1956, for piano and wind quintet
* Joseph Jongen (1873–1953), Rapsodie, Op. 70, composed 1922, for piano and wind quintet
* Paul Juon (1872-1940), Divertimento, Op. 51, composed 1913, for piano and wind quintet
* Sergei Lyapunov (1859–1924), Sextet in B-flat minor, Op. 63, composed 1916/1921, for piano, string quartet, and double bass
* Bohuslav Martinů (1890–1959)
** ballet, &quot;La revue de cuisine&quot;, composed 1927, for piano, violin, cello, clarinet, bassoon, and trumpet
**Piano Sextet, composed 1929, for piano, flute, oboe, clarinet, and two bassoons
* Felix Mendelssohn (1809–1847), Sextet in D major, Op. 110, composed 1824, for piano, violin, two violas, cello, and double bass
* Krzysztof Penderecki (born 1933), Sextet for string trio, clarinet, horn, and piano
* Francis Poulenc (1899–1963), Sextet, composed 1939, for piano and wind quintet
* Sergei Prokofiev (1891–1953), &quot;Overture on Hebrew Themes&quot; in C minor, Op. 34, for piano, clarinet, and string quartet
* Albert Roussel (1869-1937), Divertissement, Op. 6, composed 1906, for piano and wind quintet
* Ludwig Thuille (1861–1907), Sextet in B-flat, Op. 6, composed 1886, for piano and wind quintet
* Felix Weingartner (1863–1942), Sextet Op.33; for piano, two violins, viola, violoncello and double bass

<text>Pay television, also known as subscription television, premium television or, when referring to an individual service, a premium channel, refers to subscription-based television services, usually provided by multichannel television providers, but also increasingly via digital terrestrial and streaming television. In the United States, subscription television began in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the form of encrypted analog over-the-air broadcast television which could be decrypted with special equipment. The concept rapidly expanded through the multi-channel transition and into the post-network era. Other parts of the world beyond the United States, such as France and Latin America have also offered encrypted analog terrestrial signals available for subscription.

The term is most synonymous with premium entertainment services focused on films or general entertainment programming such as, in the United States, Cinemax, HBO, MGM+, Showtime, and Starz, but such services can also include those devoted to sports, as well as adult entertainment.

==Business model==
In contrast to most other multichannel television broadcasters, which depend on advertising and carriage fees as their sources of revenue, the majority of pay television services rely almost solely on monthly subscription fees paid by individual customers. As a result, pay television outlets are most concerned with offering content that can justify the cost of the service, which helps to attract new subscribers, and retain existing subscribers.

Many pay television services consist of multiple individual channels, referred to as &quot;multiplex&quot; services (in reference to multiplex cinemas), where a main flagship channel is accompanied by secondary services with distinct schedules focusing on specific genres and audiences (such as multiplexes focusing more on &quot;classic&quot; films, or family-oriented programming), time shifting, or brand licensing deals (such as channels focusing specifically on Disney films, or content from U.S. pay television brands if they do not specifically run their own network in a specific market). Typically, these services are bundled together with the main channel at no additional charge, and cannot be purchased separately.

Depending on local regulations, pay television services generally have more lenient content standards because of their relatively narrower distribution, and not being subject to pressure from sponsors to tone down content. As a result, programming is typically aired with limited to no edits for time or, where applicable, mature content such as graphic violence, profanity, nudity, and sexual activity.

As premium television services are commonly devoid of traditional commercial advertising, breaks between programming typically include promotions for upcoming programs, and interstitial segments (such as behind-the-scenes content, interviews, and other feature segments). Some sports-based pay services, however, may feature some commercial advertising, particularly if they simulcast sporting events that are broadcast by advertiser-supported television networks.

In addition, most general interest or movie-based pay services do not adhere to the common top and bottom of the hour scheduling of other cable channels and terrestrial broadcasters. As such, programs often air using either conventional scheduling or have airtimes in five-minute increments (for example, 7:05 a.m. or 4:40 p.m.); since such channels broadcast content without in-program break interruptions, this sometimes leads to extended or abbreviated breaks between programs, depending on when the previous program concludes and when the start time of the next program is. The only universal variation to this is prime time, where the main channel in each pay service&#x27;s suite usually schedules films to start on the hour.

=== Programming ===
Films comprise much of the content seen on most pay television services, particularly those with a general entertainment format and those that focus exclusively on films. Services often obtain rights to films through exclusive agreements with film distributors. Films acquired during the original term of license agreements with a distributor may also be broadcast as &quot;sub-runs&quot;, in which a service holds rights to film long after the conclusion of a distribution agreement (under this arrangement, the pay service that originally licensed the rights to a particular film title, or one other than that which had held rights, may hold the broadcast rights through a library content deal).

Many general interest premium channels also produce original television series. Due to the aforementioned leniency in content standards, they too can contain content that is more mature than those of other cable channels or television networks. These series also tend to be high-budget and aim for critical success in order to attract subscribers: notable premium series, such as Cinemax&#x27;s &quot;Banshee,&quot; &quot;The Knick&quot;, &quot;Strike Back&quot;, &quot;Jett&quot;, HBO&#x27;s &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, and &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, and Showtime&#x27;s &quot;Dexter&quot;, &quot;Homeland&quot;, and &quot;Weeds&quot;, have achieved critical acclaim and have won various television awards. Some premium channels also broadcast television specials, which most commonly consist of concerts and concert films, documentaries, stand-up comedy, and in the past, theatrical plays.

Sports programming is also featured on some premium services; HBO was historically known for its broadcasts of boxing, while Showtime and Epix also carry mixed martial arts events. Some general interest premium channels have aired other professional sporting events in the past: HBO for example, carried games from the National Hockey League (NHL), National Basketball Association (NBA) and American Basketball Association (ABA) in its early years, and from 1975 to 1999 aired the Wimbledon tennis tournament. Specialty pay sports channels also exist—often focusing on international sports considered niche to domestic audiences (such as, in the United States, cricket), and are typically sold at a higher expense than traditional premium services. Out-of-market sports packages in North America are multi-channel pay services carrying professional or collegiate sporting events which are sold in a seasonal package. They are typically the most expensive type of pay services, generally running in the range of $35 to $50 per month.

Some pay services also offer pornographic films; Cinemax was, initially, well known for carrying a late-night block of softcore films and series known as &quot;Max After Dark&quot;—a reputation that led to the network often being nicknamed &quot;Skinemax&quot; by viewers. This reputation, however, largely died out by the beginning of the mid-90s, as Cinemax had already established a reputation for popular movies and shows, such as &quot;GoodFellas&quot; being an exclusive premiere on the network in the early 90s. Cinemax eventually phased out the programming completely in the 2010s, citing that it did not align with its current focus on action programming, and that internet porn and the amount of sexual content in other mainstream premium series (such as &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;) made a specific block for such content redundant. Specialized channels dedicated to pornographic films also exist, that carry either softcore adult programs (such as Playboy TV), or more hardcore content (such as The Erotic Network and Hustler TV).

==Pricing and packaging==
Pay television channels come in different price ranges. Many channels carrying advertising combine this income with a lower subscription fee. These are called &quot;mini-pay&quot; channels (a term also used for smaller scale commercial-free pay television services) and are often sold as a part of a package with numerous similarly priced channels. Usually, however, the regular pricing for premium channels ranges from just under $10 to near $25 per month per suite, with lower prices available via bundling options with cable or satellite providers, or special limited offers which are available during free preview periods or before the launch of a network&#x27;s prestige series. However, some other channels, such as sports and adult networks may ask for monthly pricing that may go as high as near $50 a month. There are also premium television services which are priced significantly higher than the mini-pay channels, but they compensate for their higher price by carrying little or no advertising and also providing a higher quality program output. As advertising sales are sensitive to the business cycle, some broadcasters try to balance them with more stable income from subscriptions.

Some providers offer services owned by the same company in a single package. For example, American satellite provider DirecTV offers the Encore channels along with the Starz multiplex (both owned by Starz Inc.) in its &quot;Starz Super Pack&quot;; and The Movie Channel, Flix (owned by Paramount, and the latter of which continues to be sold in the DirecTV package despite Showtime Networks no longer owning Sundance TV, that channel is now owned by AMC Networks) along with Showtime in its &quot;Showtime Unlimited&quot; package; Cinemax and its multiplex networks, in turn, are almost always packaged with HBO (both owned by Warner Bros. Discovery).

Though selling premium services that are related by ownership as a package is common, that may not always be the situation: for example, in the United States, Cinemax and Encore are optionally sold separately from or in a single package with their respective parent networks HBO and Starz, depending on the service provider. The Movie Channel and Flix meanwhile, are usually sold together with Showtime (all three channels are owned by Paramount Global); though subscribers are required to purchase Showtime in order to receive Flix, The Movie Channel does not have such a restriction as a few providers optionally sell that service without requiring a Showtime subscription.

Unlike other cable networks, premium services are almost always subscribed to &quot;a la carte&quot;, meaning that one can, for example, subscribe to HBO without subscribing to Showtime (in Canada, there are slight modifications, as most providers include U.S. superstations – such as WAPA-TV – with their main premium package by default). However, subscribing to an &quot;individual&quot; service automatically includes access to all of that service&#x27;s available multiplex channels and, in some cases, access to content via video-on-demand (in the form of a conventional VOD television service, and in some cases, a companion on-demand streaming service as well). Most pay television providers also offer a selection of premium services (for example, the HBO, Showtime and Starz packages) in one bundle at a greatly reduced price than it would cost to purchase each service separately, as an inducement for subscribers to remain with their service provider or for others to induce subscribers into using their service. Similarly, many television providers offer general interest or movie-based premium channels at no additional charge for a trial period, often one to three months, though there have been rare instances of free trials for pay services that last up to one year for newer subscribers to that provider&#x27;s television service.

==Distribution==
Pay television has become popular with cable and satellite television. Pay television services often, at least two to three times per year, provide free previews of their services, in order to court potential subscribers by allowing this wider audience to sample the service for a period of days or weeks; these are typically scheduled to showcase major special event programming, such as the pay cable premiere of a blockbuster feature film, the premiere (either a series or season premiere) of a widely anticipated or critically acclaimed original series or occasionally, a high-profile special (such as a concert).

Subscription services transmitted via analogue terrestrial television have also existed, to varying degrees of success. The most known example of such service in Europe is Canal+ and its scrambled services, which operated in France from 1984 to the 2011 closedown of analogue television, Spain from 1990 to 2005 and Poland from 1995 to 2001. Some U.S. television stations launched pay services (known simply as &quot;subscription television&quot; services) such as SuperTV, Wometco Home Theater, PRISM (which principally operated as a cable service, only being simultaneously carried over-the-air for a short time during the 1980s, and unlike other general-interest pay services accepted outside advertising for broadcast during its sports telecasts), Preview, SelecTV and ON TV in the late 1970s, but those services disappeared as competition from cable television expanded during the 1980s.

In Australia, Foxtel, Optus Television and TransACT are the major pay television distributors, all of which provide cable services in some metropolitan areas, with Foxtel providing satellite service for all other areas where cable is not available. Austar formerly operated as a satellite pay service, until it merged with Foxtel and SelecTV. The major distributors of pay television in New Zealand are Sky Network Television on satellite and Vodafone on cable.

In the 2010s, over-the-top subscription video on demand (SVOD) services distributed via internet video emerged as a major competitor to traditional pay television, with services such as Amazon Video, Hulu, and Netflix gaining prominence. Similarly to pay television services, their libraries include acquired content (which can not only include films, but acquired television series as well), and a mix of original series, films, and specials. The shift towards SVOD has resulted in increasing competition within the sector, with media conglomerates having launched their own services (such as Disney+, Paramount+, Peacock, and Disney&#x27;s acquisition of the majority of Hulu) to compete, and existing premium networks such as HBO (HBO Now) and Showtime launching direct-to-consumer versions of their existing services to appeal to cord cutters. HBO and Showtime later absorbed their DTC offerings into wider services with a focus on their parent companies&#x27; libraries, with HBO Now replaced by HBO Max (now Max) in 2020 (which adds content from other Warner Bros. properties and third-parties, and would also be included with existing HBO subscriptions via television providers), and Showtime formally merging with Paramount+ in 2023. Canadian premium service The Movie Network similarly merged with the CraveTV service owned by parent company Bell Media in 2018.

==Ambiguities==
===Pay-per-view===
Pay-per-view (PPV) services are similar to subscription-based pay television services in that customers must pay to have the broadcast decrypted for viewing, but usually only entail a one-time payment for a single or time-limited viewing. Programs offered via pay-per-view are most often movies or sporting events, but may also include other events, such as concerts and even softcore adult programs. In the U.S., the initial concept and technology for pay-per-view for broadcast television was first developed in the early 1950s, including a crude decrypting of the over-the-air television signal and a decoding box, but never caught on for use at that time. It took another four decades when cable broadcasters started using pay-per-view on a widespread basis.

===Free-to-view===
&quot;Free&quot; variants are free-to-air (FTA) and free-to-view (FTV); however, FTV services are normally encrypted and decryption cards either come as part of an initial subscription to a pay television bouquet – in other words, an offer of pay-TV channels – or can be purchased for a one-time cost. FTA and FTV systems may still have selective access. ABC Australia is one example, as much of its programming content is free-to-air except for National Rugby League (NRL) games, which are encrypted.

<doc id="661994" wikidata="Q5367962" url="?curid=661994" title="Elusive Quality">
<text>Elusive Quality (January 27, 1993 – March 14, 2018) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse who was a record-setting sprinter on the racetrack and the leading sire in North America of 2004. He sired the 2004 Kentucky Derby winner Smarty Jones. 

==Background==
Elusive Quality was bred in Kentucky by Silver Springs Stud Farm and Marie Costelloe. He was owned by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, who put him into training with Bill Mott. Elusive Quality was sired by Gone West, a stakes winning son of Mr. Prospector. Elusive Quality&#x27;s dam, Touch of Greatness, was an unraced daughter of Hero&#x27;s Honor. She was a granddaughter of 1981 Kentucky Broodmare of the Year Natashka.

==Racing career==
Elusive Quality raced twenty times and won nine times, including two stakes races, on both turf and dirt. He made his first start as a three-year-old on May 3, 1996 in a maiden special weight race at Belmont Park, which he won in front-running fashion by lengths. His time for miles over the sloppy main track was a solid 1:41.20. He was second in his next start, then won his third start, an allowance race at Belmont. Stepped up in class, he finished second in the King&#x27;s Bishop Stakes at Saratota, nosed out at the wire by Honour and Glory. He was then eighth in the Vosburgh Stakes before being returned to allowance company, in which he finished second and first in his last two starts of the year.

Elusive Quality began his four-year-old campaign on February 21, 1997 in an allowance race at Gulfstream Park. He set a fast pace and continued to open up ground on the rest of the field to win by five lengths. His time of 1:20.17 for seven furlongs set a track record, and earned him the highest Beyer Speed Figure of the year for a sprinter. He was winless in his other four starts that year, with the highlight being a third place finish in the Tom Fool Handicap.

Elusive Quality won four of seven starts at age five. He started the year with an allowance race win on February 5, 1998 at Gulfstream Park, then another allowance win on April 29 at Churchill Downs. Stepped up in class for the Metropolitan Handicap on May 25, he finished eighth. Just six days later though, Mott decided to switch Elusive Quality from dirt to turf. He responded by earning his first graded stakes win in the Jaipur Handicap, prevailing by a head in a time of 1:20.99 for seven furlongs over turf. On July 4 in the Poker Handicap, he went straight to the lead and won by six lengths while setting what was then a world record of 1:31.63 for one mile on the turf. &quot;With this horse,&quot; said jockey Jerry Bailey, &quot;you just break and hang on. If he feels like it, he wins. It seems he&#x27;s more comfortable now that he runs on turf.&quot;

He finished his career with a fourth place finish in the Woodbine Mile and a sixth in the Kelso Handicap. His career earnings were $413,284.

==Stud career==
Elusive Quality retired to stud in 1999 for an initial fee of $10,000. He initially stood at Gainsborough Farm in Versailles, Kentucky before being relocated in 2007 to Darley America&#x27;s Jonabell Farm in Lexington, Kentucky. During the South American breeding season, he was shuttled to Darley Australia or Stud TNT in Brazil. By 2005, his stud fee had increased to $100,000. At the time of his death in 2018, he had sired 51 graded stakes winners including eight champions. He was also the broodmare sire of 73 black-type winners.

<doc id="662011" wikidata="Q919039" url="?curid=662011" title="British Columbia Highway 99">
<text>Highway 99 is a provincial highway in British Columbia that runs from the U.S. border to near Cache Creek, serving Greater Vancouver and the Squamish–Lillooet corridor. It is a major north–south artery within Vancouver and connects the city to several suburbs as well as the U.S. border, where it continues south as Interstate 5. The central section of the route, also known as the Sea to Sky Highway, serves the communities of Squamish, Whistler, and Pemberton. Highway 99 continues through Lillooet and ends at a junction with Highway 97 near Cache Creek.

The highway&#x27;s number, assigned in 1940, was derived from former U.S. Route 99, the predecessor to Interstate 5 and a major route for the U.S. West Coast. Highway 99 originally comprised the King George Highway in Surrey, portions of Kingsway from New Westminster to Vancouver, and local streets. It was extended across the Lions Gate Bridge and to Horseshoe Bay in the 1950s along a new highway that would later be incorporated into Highway 1 (the Trans-Canada Highway), which has a concurrency with Highway 99 in West Vancouver.

Highway 99 was later moved to freeway sections in southern Surrey, Delta, and Richmond that opened beginning in the late 1950s. These sections, which included the George Massey Tunnel under the Fraser River, were numbered as Highway 499 until 1973. The highway&#x27;s northern section was extended several times between 1959 and 1992 with the opening of routes beyond Whistler and Pemberton. For the 2010 Winter Olympics hosted by Vancouver and Whistler, the Sea to Sky Highway was rebuilt to increase safety and capacity—both of which had been longstanding issues with the highway as recreational and commercial traffic increased in the late 20th century. In 2006, &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper from the United Kingdom listed the Sea to Sky as the fifth best road trip worldwide.

==Route description==

===South Surrey to Richmond===
The southern terminus of Highway 99 is at the Peace Arch Border Crossing on the international border between the Canadian province of British Columbia and the U.S. state of Washington. It is a continuation of Interstate 5, a freeway that continues south towards Seattle and major cities on the U.S. West Coast, ultimately ending near Tijuana, Mexico. The highway passes the Peace Arch monument in the international park of the same name and travels north through a 24-hour customs facility operated by the Canada Border Services Agency in Douglas, part of southern Surrey on Boundary Bay. The freeway travels northwest with four lanes around the city of White Rock and through residential neighbourhoods in Surrey on the south side of the Nicomekl River. Beyond the river, Highway 99 gains a northbound bus lane on its shoulder and traverses farmland as it turns west along the shoreline of Boundary Bay.

The freeway follows Boundary Bay into the city of Delta and intersects Highway 91, which connects to New Westminster and provides an alternative route to Richmond. Highway 99 continues west through a junction with Ladner Trunk Road (formerly Highway 10) to reach an interchange with Highway 17, which travels to Tsawwassen and its major ferry terminal and freight hub. The freeway turns northwest and passes through a junction with Highway 17A before it enters the George Massey Tunnel, which travels under the South Arm of the Fraser River from Deas Island to Richmond. The tunnel has four lanes, of which one is able to reverse on a set schedule to provide a third lane in the peak direction of travel.

Within Richmond, Highway 99 travels north with six lanes and bus shoulders through an interchange with the Steveston Highway and a rural area. It then reaches a second junction with Highway 91 that bisects the Richmond Nature Park and includes ramps to Alderbridge Way and Knight Street. The freeway turns northwest and passes through a residential neighbourhood to reach an interchange with Sea Island Way, which provides a connection to Vancouver International Airport, Sea Island, and the Bridgeport transit hub. Highway 99 then crosses over the Canada Line and Fraser River on the Oak Street Bridge, which carries four lanes into the city of Vancouver.

===Vancouver===
The freeway section of Highway 99 ends at an interchange with Marine Drive on the north end of the Oak Street Bridge in Vancouver&#x27;s Marpole neighbourhood. Within Vancouver, the highway travels for on various city streets that are maintained by the city government and are also served by TransLink buses. The highway briefly travels north on Oak Street and turns west onto West 70th Avenue through several residential blocks. Highway 99 then turns north onto Granville Street, which it follows for through residential neighbourhoods and a commercial district near its junction with Broadway, which carries the westernmost section of Highway 7.

The highway travels onto the Granville Bridge, which carries eight lanes of traffic over False Creek and Granville Island into Downtown Vancouver. The bridge includes ramps on its south side to West 4th Avenue and other streets, as well as an interchange on its north side with loop ramps that connect to Pacific Boulevard and Pacific Street. Highway 99 passes over the University Canada West campus and splits into a pair of one-way streets: Seymour Street for northbound traffic and Howe Street for southbound traffic; the two streets are split by Granville Street, which continues as a transit mall for TransLink buses.

Seymour and Howe streets pass through residential and commercial areas in Downtown Vancouver, which include department stores, the Vancouver Art Gallery, Robson Square, the CF Pacific Centre, and several SkyTrain stations. Highway 99 turns west onto Georgia Street and returns to bi-directional traffic as it traverses the West End near the city&#x27;s central waterfront. The street carries four lanes for general purpose traffic and two lanes shared by buses and bicycles during daytime hours; beyond Pender Street, it gains a center reversible lane that is controlled with traffic signals. The highway then travels through Stanley Park with three lanes–one per direction and a center reversible lane—and crosses the Lions Gate Bridge over the First Narrows as it leaves Vancouver.

===West Vancouver and Sea to Sky Highway===
The Lions Gate Bridge continues into West Vancouver and bisects X̱wemelch&#x27;stn, an Indian reserve managed by the Squamish Nation. Highway 99 briefly travels west onto Marine Drive after an interchange and crosses the Capilano River to the Park Royal Shopping Centre, where it turns north onto Taylor Way. The highway then passes through a residential neighbourhood and reaches an interchange with Highway 1, part of the Trans-Canada Highway system. Highway 99 joins Highway 1 on the Upper Levels Highway, a four-lane freeway that travels west through residential neighbourhoods on the south side of Cypress Mountain. The freeway makes several gradual turns as it ascends the foothills of Cypress Mountain; Highway 1 splits from the highway to serve the Horseshoe Bay ferry terminal, a major hub for BC Ferries, as it continues onward to Vancouver Island.

The &quot;Sea to Sky Highway&quot; is the name given to the section of Highway 99 from Horseshoe Bay to Pemberton, a province-designated scenic highway and tourist attraction. From Horseshoe Bay, the four-lane divided highway travels along the eastern coast of Howe Sound and the foothills of the North Shore Mountains. Highway 99 follows the BC Rail mainline, which runs below along the coastline, and narrows to a two-lane undivided highway at Tunnel Point north of Lions Bay; the point also marks the boundary between Greater Vancouver and the Squamish-Lillooet Regional District. The highway then continues north with occasional passing lanes and divided sections, as well as scenic viewpoints and rest areas, and later reverts to a limited access roadway as it descends into Britannia Beach, home to the Britannia Mine Museum.

Highway 99 travels northeast through Murrin Provincial Park as it ascends a hill to bypass Watts Point, an extinct volcanic centre on Howe Sound. The highway then descends along the coast towards Squamish at the head of Howe Sound. It passes a ferry terminal at Darrell Bay and the viewpoint for Shannon Falls, the third-highest waterfall in the province at . Highway 99 passes under Stawamus Chief, a large mountain immediately outside of Squamish, and travels through the city&#x27;s residential neighbourhoods. It bypasses downtown to serve a commercial and industrial area on the north side of the city and briefly turns northeast to cross the Mamquam River. The highway continues north along the Squamish River through Cheakamus Canyon towards Whistler and then onward to Pemberton. The corridor is also home to the Sea to Sky Trail, a multi-use trail for hiking and cycling that runs from Squamish to D&#x27;Arcy north of Pemberton.

===Duffey Lake Road===

Highway 99 continues on Duffey Lake Road from Pemberton to Lillooet. This section of road parallels several rivers and water bodies, including the Squamish River, the Cheakamus River, and Daisy Lake, which flow south toward Howe Sound. In Whistler, near Alta Lake, the road crosses a watershed, and north of this point, the road follows the Green River and Lillooet River which flow north and east toward Lillooet Lake, and ultimately towards the Fraser River. The speed limit of the Sea to Sky Highway ranges from with sections in Lions Bay, Britannia Beach and parts of Squamish.

After passing Lillooet Lake, the highway climbs a steep grade to Joffre Lakes Provincial Park, and shortly after passes through Cayoosh Pass, the highest point on the highway at . East of the pass the road follows the course of Cayoosh Creek as it traverses the southern base of Mount Rohr and skirts Duffey Lake Provincial Park. As Duffey Lake Road, after winding almost northeast in very steep mountains where sometimes the advisory speed limit is , and is legally posted as throughout. Highway 99 reaches the junction with Highway 12 at Lillooet, and then goes northeast for another to its northern terminus at its junction with Highway 97, just north of Cache Creek and just south of Clinton.

==History==

===King George Highway===
The modern-day highways between the Peace Arch Border Crossing and New Westminster generally follow the Semiahmoo Trail, an overland route used by indigenous Coast Salish peoples that was later adopted by fur traders and early non-indigenous Fraser Valley settlers in the 1860s. The trail was replaced with a wagon road that was completed by the provincial government in 1879. The Pacific Highway was later built in the 1910s to connect Vancouver to Seattle and the rest of the U.S. West Coast and marked by the Peace Arch, a monument dedicated in 1921 to commemorate the Treaty of Ghent. The highway was later given number designations: U.S. Route 99 in Washington was created as part of the United States Numbered Highway System in 1926; and &quot;Route R&quot; in British Columbia was created in the 1930s.

Construction of a modern highway to link Vancouver with the U.S. border, initially named the Peace Arch Highway, began in 1931 with the establishment of a work camp in Surrey. The new highway would bypass a hilly section of the Pacific Highway south of Kingsway in Cloverdale and be built with future expansion to four lanes. The city of Burnaby later began planning for a new corridor to parallel Kingsway in lieu of widening the existing street, which was followed by a plan by New Westminster to improve its section of the highway; local officials in Delta requested the construction of a new highway to link the Peace Arch to Ladner and Lulu Island (modern-day Richmond). By July 1938, construction on all sections of the highway between the Peace Arch and the Pattullo Bridge into New Westminster was underway. The first sections of the unpaved highway were opened in June 1939 and the gravel surfacing was completed from the Nicomekl River to New Westminster in October.

The new roadway was renamed for King George VI and numbered Highway 99 by the provincial government to match U.S. Route 99 to the south; a special purple-and-gold highway shield with the letters &quot;G.R.&quot; was designed for Highway 99. The King George VI Highway was dedicated by the provincial government at the Peace Arch on October 16, 1940, and cost $800,000 to construct. It had two fully paved lanes and featured a maximum grade of 4 percent between the U.S. border and the Pattullo Bridge. Highway 99 continued northwest on Kingsway, which it shared with Highway 1, through New Westminster to Downtown Vancouver and ended at the edge of Stanley Park.

===Vancouver–Squamish Highway===

Highway 99 was extended to West Vancouver in 1956, crossing the existing Lions Gate Bridge across the First Narrows of the Burrard Inlet, and continued along Marine Drive and Taylor Drive for to the new Upper Levels Highway. The Lions Gate Bridge opened in 1938 and was operated by the Guinness family until it was purchased by the provincial government in 1955; it was tolled until 1963. The , two-lane Upper Levels Highway opened on September 14, 1957, between Taylor Way in West Vancouver and Horseshoe Bay. It cost $1.3 million to construct and replaced a winding coastal section of Marine Drive, but initially lacked guardrails and other safety features due to a rushed opening. Taylor Way was later widened to four lanes in early 1958 to handle increased traffic to the Upper Levels Highway, which was extended east to the Second Narrows Bridge in 1961 and signed as part of the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1).

The bridge acquisition and Upper Levels Highway construction were part of the provincial government&#x27;s plan to complete the Vancouver–Squamish Highway, which would open vehicular access beyond Horseshoe Bay. The new highway was built alongside the government-owned Pacific Great Eastern Railway (now BC Rail), which completed an extension along Howe Sound to Squamish on August 27, 1956, to connect with an existing route to Prince George. Both corridors were preceded by the Lillooet Cattle Trail, a wagon trail established in 1877 and used for a decade until it was replaced by inland railroads. Surveyors began work in 1949 to find a suitable route along Howe Sound to link existing roads that ended at Whytecliff (overlooking Horseshoe Bay) and Britannia Beach.

Two competing routes emerged in the early 1950s: one following the Howe Sound coastline at a cost of approximately $6 million; and another that would travel north along the Capilano River from West Vancouver for and cross over a pass at to follow Furry Creek to Britannia at an initial cost of $3.5 million. The Howe Sound route had been criticised for its higher cost and complexity due to the rugged terrain and parallel railroad; at the time, an unpaved road along the Capilano–Furry route was passable for some traffic but a full highway would require steeper grades that would not be accessible during parts of the winter. Planning was delayed for several years by the provincial government to negotiate with the Greater Vancouver Water District, who opposed the Capilano–Furry route due to its potential effects on the protected drinking water source for the city. The water district also cited the need for a filtration plant to prevent highway debris and pollutants from contaminating the basin, which would cost up to $12 million. On May 18, 1954, the provincial cabinet announced that the Vancouver–Squamish Highway would be constructed along the Howe Sound route to a width of at an unspecified cost.

The section between Britannia and Squamish had already been built by 1950 and improved later that year with $15,000 in funding to bypass a steep segment with 10–15 percent grades. Construction of a section north of Horseshoe Bay began in early 1955 under the same contractor as a parallel section of the Pacific Great Eastern Railway. The provincial government also announced plans to build a highway extension to serve Garibaldi Provincial Park north of Squamish, the site of planned tourist development and a potential national park, in early 1956. Two more contracts were awarded by the end of the year and construction on all of the highway was underway by March 1956. Work on the highway began with clearing and explosive blasting of rock faces above the railway, which was protected by wooden boards laid over the tracks. An estimated of material was blasted or excavated for the highway project, which was delayed by a year due to the reassignment of labour to finish the Pacific Great Eastern Railway.

The Vancouver–Squamish Highway, officially named the Seaview Highway, was dedicated and opened to traffic on August 7, 1958, with 600 cars queued to drive the completed route from Horseshoe Bay to Squamish. The majority of the two-lane highway was paved in July through a rush order from the provincial government to complete a preliminary surface, while between Britannia and Squamish remained a gravel road with steeper grades and narrower turns. The project cost a total of $11 million to construct and was expected to attract investment in a planned ski resort at the base of Garibaldi Mountain. The new highway was later furnished with guard rails, curbs, and culverts within a few weeks of opening; the paved and gravelled sections developed large potholes within a month of opening, which required additional construction.

The provincial government announced plans pave the Britannia–Squamish section and extend the highway to Pemberton and Lillooet by 1965 following requests from local business leaders. The existing route from Squamish to Lillooet was long and mostly unpaved, with some sections that required vehicles with four-wheel drive to negotiate the terrain. Construction of an all-season gravel road to Alta Lake at the base of Whistler Mountain was announced in March 1962 as part of a larger development plan for a ski area that could host the Winter Olympics. By the following June, four-wheel drive vehicles were able to access Alta Lake via the rudimentary gravel road, but it remained closed to the public. The Alta Lake extension was completed in time for the opening of the Whistler Blackcomb ski area on January 15, 1966, which brought more traffic to the highway. A bypass of Squamish opened in March 1966 and the section to Alta Lake was paved by the end of the year. A resort town on the highway, named Whistler, was developed in the late 1970s and 1980s at the base of the mountain near Alta Lake.

An unpaved extension to Pemberton was opened in 1965 and described as being of a &quot;reasonable driving standard&quot; by the Minister of Recreation. In 1969, the rebuilt and paved Britannia–Squamish section of Highway 99 opened at a cost of $2.5 million. The highway was occasionally closed during winters due to washouts, floods, and rockslides that required explosives to clear. The paved highway was extended to Pemberton and Mount Currie by 1975.

===Vancouver–Blaine Freeway construction===

In 1953, Minister of Public Works Phil Gaglardi proposed a four-lane freeway that would connect the U.S. border to Vancouver via Richmond&#x27;s Lulu Island with a connection to Vancouver International Airport. The proposal would extend Highway 99 and incorporate the Oak Street Bridge, a new road crossing of the Fraser River&#x27;s North Arm that replaced the aging Marpole Bridge in 1957. Specific routing plans were kept a &quot;closely-guarded secret&quot; by the provincial government to prevent land speculation from increasing costs; Gaglardi also proposed financing the new highway as a limited-access tollway that would eventually continue through Vancouver to the Lions Gate Bridge and Upper Levels Highway. A survey team was dispatched to find a location for the envisioned freeway to cross the Fraser River&#x27;s South Arm and four candidate sites were identified in early 1955: Port Mann in Surrey, Annacis Island near New Westminster, Deas Island near Ladner, and Tilbury Island.

A tunnel at the Deas Island site, which would replace an existing ferry and cost up to $17 million, was announced as the winning option in February 1956 following a recommendation from a contracted engineering firm. Construction began with a ceremonial cement pouring overseen by premier W. A. C. Bennett in May 1957 and was conducted using a set of six concrete immersed tubes that were constructed on the shore. The Deas Island Tunnel and its approaches on Lulu Island and near Ladner were opened for a preview weekend beginning May 23, 1959, where it attracted 133,000 vehicles. The tunnel was formally dedicated by Queen Elizabeth II on July 15, 1959, and later renamed the George Massey Tunnel. Tolls were collected at both the four-lane tunnel and the Oak Street Bridge until March 31, 1964.

A regional freeway network for Greater Vancouver was proposed by a provincial government report in April 1959 and included a six-lane freeway that followed Arbutus Street from the Oak Street Bridge to a loop around Downtown Vancouver that connected to the Lions Gate Bridge. The freeway alignment of Highway 99 between 8th Avenue in South Surrey and the North Arm of the Fraser River opened in 1962 and was originally named the Deas (Island) Throughway. Between 1964 and 1973, the freeway alignment of Highway 99 was designated Highway 499; the old alignment was redesignated as Highway 99A. The four-lane, freeway between the Deas Island Tunnel and the U.S. border was opened on May 29, 1962, by premier Bennett and Washington Governor Albert D. Rosellini. It cost $57 million to construct and was funded by the provincial government.

===Lillooet extension and other projects===

An unpaved logging road from Pemberton Valley to Lillooet, later named Duffey Lake Road, was built in the 1960s and opened to limited recreational use in 1972. The road was widened to a width of and opened to the public on weekends and outside of logging periods to access recreational areas and bypass the congested Fraser Canyon highways. The provincial government provided funding for maintenance for several years before formally taking control on April 1, 1979. Early concepts for an extension of Highway 99 to Lillooet in the 1960s included a ferry to cross Anderson and Seton lakes.

Paving of Duffey Lake Road began in 1990 and was mostly completed by the end of the following year at a cost of $22.5 million. During construction, a group from the Lil&#x27;wat First Nation blockaded the road at Mount Currie during a conflict with Lillooet residents and authorities; the section through the community was left unpaved for several years. The paved section was incorporated into an extension of Highway 99 in 1992. A section of Highway 12 between Lillooet and Highway 97 was also re-numbered 99. The portion of the highway between Lillooet and Pavilion was part of the route of the Old Cariboo Road, which was developed in the 1850s and 1860s during the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush.

===Olympics upgrades and later history===

The Horseshoe Bay–Pemberton section of Highway 99 was renamed the Sea to Sky Highway in the 1980s and remained a two-lane undivided highway with various safety issues. It had no outside barrier to prevent vehicles from falling off the steep cliff overlooking Howe Sound or to prevent rocks from overhead bluffs from hitting the highway. Fatalities on the section were attributed to inclement weather conditions that changed rapidly, poor visibility, excessive speed, drunk drivers, and difficulty in passing slower vehicles. From 1998 to 2004, the highway had an annual average of 574 collisions or accidents with eight fatalities per year—far higher than a comparable highway in the province.

A major reconstruction of the highway, including widening sections to four lanes between Horseshoe Bay and Squamish, was proposed by political leaders in 1981 following the death of nine people who had driven off a washed out wooden bridge over M Creek. At the time, the Sea to Sky Highway had five wooden bridges that had yet to be replaced. The provincial government announced a $110 million plan to improve the highway, which was outfitted with passing lanes and new bridges by the end of the decade.

As part of the Vancouver–Whistler bid for the 2010 Winter Olympics, the provincial government authorized an upgrade of the highway to accommodate greater traffic loads, widening the highway and adding a concrete divider. The bid also considered a new highway to bypass parts of the corridor, including a tunnel under Grouse Mountain or a toll road through Indian Arm, but they were not advanced for further planning. A large section had already been upgraded between Squamish and Whistler in 2002, prior to the Olympics being awarded, to improve upon work done during the 1980s. The Sea to Sky is a freeway from the interchange with Highway 1 to the at-grade intersection with Lawrence Way. After that, there are sporadic interchanges and at-grade intersections. It is mostly a divided highway all the way to Lions Bay and through Squamish. The project cost $600 million and included the construction of large retaining walls, wider bridges able to withstand earthquakes, and mesh screens for rockfalls. The section was added to the National Highway System in 2004. Several bilingual signs with place names in the Squamish language (Sḵwx̱wú7mesh) and special highway markers shaped like paddles were also installed on Highway 99 by April 2009 as part of the project.

On-site protests delayed part of the construction, especially near wildlife habitats in the Eagleridge Bluffs of West Vancouver. Protesters claimed that a tunnel was a safer and environmentally friendlier alternative. A court injunction and police were used to remove the protestors, one of whom, Harriet Nahanee, a respected Squamish elder, died soon after in the Surrey Pre-Trial Centre from health complications alleged to be related to her arrest and incarceration. Plans to build a new highway through West Vancouver to directly connect the Lions Gate Bridge to the Upper Levels Freeway were rejected by the provincial government following a study that determined it would not be cost-effective. As a result of the highway reconstruction, crashes on the section dropped by 66 percent; communities along the corridor also saw significant population growth, in part because the highway made longer commutes more viable.

During the Olympic Games, a checkpoint was installed on Highway 99 near Squamish to inspect travellers to Whistler, who were required to present a valid permit for parking provided by their hotel or issued to residents and workers. Shuttle buses ran between Vancouver and Whistler for spectators and other visitors during the Olympics.

===Future plans===

In 2006, the provincial government announced the Gateway Program, a major regional transportation plan that would include a replacement for the George Massey Tunnel. Under the plan, the tunnel would be tolled and twinned to add an additional lane in each direction, but it was given a lower priority due to its potential effects of moving traffic bottlenecks to the Oak Street and Knight Street bridges. The twinning proposal was one of several options considered during a public consultation in 2012, which resulted in a new proposal from Liberal premier Christy Clark to build a ten-lane toll bridge that would cost $3.5 billion to construct. Following the 2017 election, the New Democratic Party announced the cancellation of the bridge proposal and commissioned an independent review with alternative plans. A plan to build an eight-lane immersed tube tunnel with dedicated transit, bicycle, and pedestrian access was announced in August 2021. It is planned to be completed in 2030 at a cost of $4.15 billion.

Proposals to build an alternative Burrard Inlet road crossing to replace the Lions Gate Bridge have been announced by various business groups and political leaders since the 1930s, with more serious studies undertaken in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The NDP government in the mid-1990s also considered a tunnel, but chose instead to re-deck the Lions Gate Bridge with work completed in 2001. The project also included widening of the Stanley Park Causeway and the removal of trees in the park, which caused protests from environmental groups. The Vancouver Park Board approved of an agreement with TransLink, the city and provincial governments, and ICBC in 2000 to allow the widening on the condition that private vehicular traffic on the causeway and Lions Gate Bridge would be banned in 2030 if a new crossing were built. The agreement was not included in the final contract, but a closure of the bridge to vehicular traffic is listed in the City of Vancouver&#x27;s 2040 plan.
