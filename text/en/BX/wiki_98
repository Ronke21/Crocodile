<text>In Buddhist philosophy and soteriology, Buddha-nature (Chinese: , Japanese: , , Sanskrit: ) is the innate potential for all sentient beings to become a Buddha or the fact that all sentient beings already have a pure Buddha-essence within themselves. &quot;Buddha-nature&quot; is the common English translation for several related Mahāyāna Buddhist terms, most notably tathāgatagarbha and buddhadhātu, but also &quot;sugatagarbha,&quot; and &quot;buddhagarbha&quot;. &quot;Tathāgatagarbha&quot; can mean &quot;the womb&quot; or &quot;embryo&quot; (&quot;garbha&quot;) of the &quot;thus-gone one&quot; (&quot;tathāgata&quot;), and can also mean &quot;containing a &quot;tathāgata&quot;&quot;&quot;. Buddhadhātu&quot; can mean &quot;buddha-element&quot;, &quot;buddha-realm&quot;, or &quot;buddha-substrate&quot;.

Buddha-nature has a wide range of (sometimes conflicting) meanings in Indian Buddhism and later in East Asian and Tibetan Buddhist literature. Broadly speaking, it refers to the belief that the luminous mind, &quot;the natural and true state of the mind&quot;, which is pure (&quot;visuddhi&quot;) mind undefiled by afflictions, is inherently present in every sentient being, and is eternal and unchanging. It will shine forth when it is cleansed of the defilements, that is, when the nature of mind is recognized for what it is.

The &quot;Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot; (2nd century CE), which was very influential in the Chinese reception of these teachings, linked the concept of &quot;tathāgatagārbha&quot; with the &quot;buddhadhātu&quot;. The term &quot;buddhadhātu&quot; originally referred to the relics of Gautama Buddha. In the &quot;Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot;, it came to be used in place of the concept of &quot;tathāgatagārbha&quot;, reshaping the worship of physical relics of the historical Buddha into worship of the inner Buddha as a principle of salvation.

The primordial or undefiled mind, the &quot;tathāgatagārbha&quot;, is also often equated with the Buddhist philosophical concept of emptiness (&quot;śūnyatā&quot;, a Mādhyamaka concept); with the storehouse-consciousness (&quot;ālāyavijñāna&quot;, a Yogācāra concept); and with the interpenetration of all dharmas (in East Asian traditions like Huayan). The belief in Buddha-nature is central to East Asian Buddhism, which relies on key Buddha-nature sources like the &quot;Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot;. In Tibetan Buddhism, the concept of Buddha-nature is equally important and often studied through the key Indian treatise on Buddha-nature, the &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot; (3rd–5th century CE).

==Etymology==
===&quot;Tathāgatagarbha&quot;===
The term &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; may mean &quot;embryonic tathāgata&quot;, &quot;womb of the tathāgata&quot;, or &quot;containing a tathagata&quot;. Various meanings may all be brought into mind when the term &quot;tathagatagarbha&quot; is being used.

====Compound====
The Sanskrit term &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; is a compound of two terms, &quot;tathāgata&quot; and &quot;garbha&quot;:
* &quot;tathāgata&quot; means &quot;the one thus gone&quot;, referring to the Buddha. It is composed of &quot;&quot;tathā&quot; and &quot;āgata&quot;, &quot;thus come&quot;&quot;, or &quot;tathā&quot; and &quot;gata&quot;, &quot;thus gone&quot;. The term refers to a Buddha, who has &quot;thus gone&quot; from samsara into nirvana, and &quot;thus come&quot; from nirvana into samsara to work for the salvation of all sentient beings.
* &quot;garbha&quot;, &quot;womb&quot;, &quot;embryo&quot;, &quot;center&quot;, &quot;essence&quot;.

====Asian translations====
The Chinese translated the term &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; as &quot;rúláizàng&quot; (如来藏), or &quot;Tathāgata&#x27;s (&quot;rúlái&quot;) storehouse&quot; (&quot;zàng&quot;). According to Brown, &quot;storehouse&quot; may indicate both &quot;that which enfolds or contains something&quot;, or &quot;that which is itself enfolded, hidden or contained by another.&quot; The Tibetan translation is &quot;de bzhin gshegs pa&#x27;i snying po&quot;, which cannot be translated as &quot;womb&quot; (&quot;mngal&quot; or &quot;lhums&quot;), but as &quot;embryonic essence&quot;, &quot;kernel&quot; or &quot;heart&quot;. The term &quot;heart&quot; was also used by Mongolian translators.

The Tibetan scholar Go Lotsawa outlined four meanings of the term &quot;Tathāgatagarbha&quot; as used by Indian Buddhist scholars generally: (1) As an emptiness that is a nonimplicative negation, (2) the luminous nature of the mind, (3) alaya-vijñana (store-consciousness), (4) all bodhisattvas and sentient beings.

====Western translations====
The term &quot;tathagatagarbha&quot; first appears in the &quot;Tathāgatagarbha sūtras&quot;, which date to the 2nd and third centuries CE. It is translated and interpreted in various ways by western translators and scholars:
* According to Sally King, the term &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; may be understood in two ways:
# &quot;embryonic tathāgata&quot;, the incipient Buddha, the &quot;cause&quot; of the Tathāgata,
# &quot;womb of the tathāgata&quot;, the &quot;fruit&quot; of Tathāgata. 
:According to King, the Chinese &quot;rúláizàng&quot; was taken in its meaning as &quot;womb&quot; or &quot;fruit&quot;. 
* Wayman &amp; Hideko also point out that the Chinese regularly takes &quot;garbha&quot; as &quot;womb&quot;, but prefer to use the term &quot;embryo&quot;.
* According to Brown, following Wayman &amp; Hideko, &quot;embryo&quot; is the best fitting translation, since it preserves &quot;the dynamic, self-transformative nature of the &quot;tathagatagarbha&quot;.&quot;
* According to Zimmermann, &quot;garbha&quot; may also mean the interior or center of something, and its essence or central part. As a &quot;tatpuruṣa&quot; it may refer to a person &quot;being&quot; a &quot;womb&quot; for or &quot;container&quot; of the tathagata. As a &quot;bahuvrihi&quot; it may refer to a person as &quot;having&quot; an embryonic tathagata inside. In both cases, this embryonic tathagata still has to be developed. Zimmermann concludes that &quot;tathagatagarbha&quot; is a &quot;bahuvrihi&quot;, meaning &quot;containing a tathagata&quot;, but notes the variety of meanings of &quot;garbha&quot;, such as &quot;containing&quot;, &quot;born from&quot;, &quot;embryo&quot;, &quot;(embracing/concealing) womb&quot;, &quot;calyx&quot;, &quot;child&quot;, &quot;member of a clan&quot;, &quot;core&quot;, which may all be brought into mind when the term &quot;tathagatagarbha&quot; is being used.
* In addition to Zimmerman&#x27;s statement that &quot;tathagatagarbha&quot; most natural means &quot;containing a Tathagata,&quot; Paul Williams notes that &quot;garbha&quot; also means &quot;womb/matrix&quot; and &quot;seed/embryo,&quot; and &quot;the innermost part of something.&quot; The term &quot;tathagatagarbha&quot; can thus also imply &quot;that sentient beings have a tathāgata within them in seed or embryo, that sentient beings are the wombs or matrices of the tathāgata, or that they have a tathāgata as their essence, core, or essential inner nature.&quot; According to Williams, the term &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; &quot;may also have been intended simply to answer the question how it is possible that all sentient beings can attain the state of a Buddha.

===&quot;Buddhadhātu&quot;===
The term &quot;buddha-nature&quot; (, ) is closely related in meaning to the term &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot;, but is not an exact translation of this term. It refers to what is essential in the human being.

The corresponding Sanskrit term is &quot;buddhadhātu&quot;. It has two meanings, namely the nature of the Buddha, equivalent to the term dharmakāya, and the cause of the Buddha. The link between the cause and the result is the nature (&quot;dhātu&quot;, see also Svabhava, Mahābhūta, and Eighteen dhātus) which is common to both, namely the dharmadhātu.

Matsumoto Shirō also points out that &quot;buddha-nature&quot; translates the Sanskrit-term buddhadhātu, a &quot;place to put something,&quot; a &quot;foundation,&quot; a &quot;locus.&quot; According to Shirō, it does not mean &quot;original nature&quot; or &quot;essence,&quot; nor does it mean the &quot;possibility of the attainment of Buddhahood,&quot; &quot;the original nature of the Buddha,&quot; or &quot;the essence of the Buddha.&quot;

In the Vajrayana, the term for buddha-nature is &quot;sugatagarbha&quot;.

==Indian Sutra sources==
=== Historical precursors ===
According to Alex Wayman, the idea of the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; is grounded on sayings by the Buddha that there is something called the luminous mind (&quot;prabhasvaracitta&quot;), &quot;which is only adventitiously covered over by defilements (agantuka klesha).&quot; The luminous mind is mentioned in a passage from the &quot;Anguttara Nikaya&quot; (which has various parallels) which states that the mind is luminous but &quot;is defiled by incoming defilements.&quot; The Mahāsāṃghika school coupled this idea with the idea of the &quot;root consciousness&quot; (mulavijñana) which serves as the basic layer of the mind and which is held to have a self-nature (&quot;cittasvabhāva&quot;) which is pure (&quot;visuddhi&quot;) and undefiled. In some of the tathagatagarbha-sutras a consciousness which is naturally pure (&quot;prakṛti-pariśuddha&quot;) is regarded to be the seed from which Buddhahood grows. Wayman thus argues that the pure luminous mind doctrine formed the basis for the classic buddha-nature doctrine.

Karl Brunnholzl writes that the first probable mention of the term &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; is in the &quot;Ekottarika Agama&quot; (though here it is used in a different way than in later texts). The passage states:

This tathāgatagarbha idea was the result of an interplay between various strands of Buddhist thought, on the nature of human consciousness and the means of awakening. Gregory sees this doctrine as implying that enlightenment is the natural state of the mind.

==== &quot;Avatamsaka&quot; and &quot;Lotus Sutras&quot; ====
According to Wayman, the teachings of the &quot;Avataṃsaka Sūtra&quot; (1st–3rd century CE), which say that the Buddha&#x27;s knowledge is all pervasive and is present in all sentient beings were also an important step in the development of buddha-nature thought. The &quot;Avataṃsaka Sūtra&quot; does not mention the term &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot;, but the idea of &quot;a universal penetration of sentient beings by the wisdom of the Buddha (&quot;buddhajñāna&quot;),&quot; is seen by some scholars as complementary to the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; concept.

The &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;, written between 100 BCE and 200 CE, also does not use the term &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot;, but Japanese scholars suggest that a similar idea is nevertheless expressed or implied in the text. The tenth chapter emphasizes that all living beings can become a Buddha. The twelfth chapter of the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; details that the potential to become enlightened is universal among all people, even the historical Devadatta has the potential to become a buddha. East Asian commentaries saw these teachings as indicating that the Lotus sutra was also drawing on the concept of the universality of buddha-nature. The sutra shares other themes and ideas with the later tathāgatagarbha sūtras and thus several scholars theorize that it was an influence on these texts.

=== &quot;Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra&quot; and &quot;Nirvana Sūtra&quot; ===
According to Zimmerman, the &quot;Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra&quot; (200–250 CE) is the earliest buddha-nature text. Zimmerman argues that &quot;the term &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; itself seems to have been coined in this very sutra.&quot; The &quot;Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra&quot; states that all beings already have perfect Buddha body (&quot;*tathāgatatva, *buddhatva, *tathāgatakāya&quot;) within themselves, but do not recognize it because it is covered over by afflictions.

The &quot;Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra&quot; uses nine similes to illustrate the concept:
Another important and early source for buddha-nature is the &quot;Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra (&quot;often just called the &quot;Nirvana Sutra),&quot; possibly dating to the 2nd century CE. Some scholars like Michael Radich argue that this is the earliest buddha-nature sutra. This sutra was very influential in the development of East Asian Buddhism. The &quot;Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot; linked the concept of tathāgatagarbha with the &quot;buddhadhātu&quot; (&quot;buddha-nature&quot; or &quot;buddha-element&quot;) and it also equates these with the eternal and pure Buddha-body, the Dharmakaya, also called &quot;vajrakaya&quot;. The sutra also presents the buddha-nature or tathagatagarbha as a &quot;Self&quot; or a true self (ātman), though it also attempts to argue that this claim is not incompatible with the teaching of not-self (anatman). The &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; further claims that buddha-nature (and the Buddha&#x27;s body, his Dharmakaya) is characterized by four perfections (pāramitās) or qualities: permanence (&quot;nitya&quot;), bliss (&quot;sukha&quot;), self (&quot;ātman&quot;), and purity (&quot;śuddha).&quot;

=== Other important buddha-nature sutras ===
Other important tathāgatagarbha sutras include:

* The &quot;Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra&quot; (&quot;The Lion&#x27;s Roar of Queen Srimala,&quot; c. 3rd century CE) which discusses the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; along with other key Mahayana doctrines like the one vehicle and the luminous mind and links them to buddha-nature thought. This sutra also states that the mind&#x27;s luminous nature, while being empty of adventitious defilements, is &quot;not empty&quot; of limitless buddha qualities. Furthermore, the &quot;Śrīmālādevī&quot; also says that the tathāgatagarbha is the basis of both saṃsāra and nirvāṇa and equates it with the dharmakāya (which is described as &quot;permanent,&quot; &quot;eternal,&quot; &quot;everlasting,&quot; and &quot;peaceful&quot;). 
* The &quot;Anūnatvāpurnatvanirdeśa&quot; (&quot;The Teaching of Neither Increase nor Decrease&quot;). This sutra states that there is no increase or decrease in the “realm (or domain, or element) of (sentient) beings” (&quot;sattvadhātu&quot;), which is really a single domain &quot;(*ekadhātu)&quot; that is equally samsara and buddhahood and is equated with the “originally pure mind” (&quot;*prakṛtipariśuddhacitta&quot;) and &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot;. 
* The &quot;Aṅgulimālīya Sūtra&quot; (2nd c. CE) – Features the mass murderer convert Aṅgulimāla as a central character (now reformed and turned into a bodhisattva). The text attributes various qualities to the universal tathāgatagarbha, such as non-arising, independence, invariability, and not being the perceptive mind.
* &quot;Mahābheri Sūtra&quot; (&quot;Great Drum Sutra&quot;) – Describes buddha nature as luminous and pure, as eternal, everlasting, peaceful and self (&quot;ātman&quot;).
* &quot;Mahāmegha Sūtra&quot; (&quot;Great Cloud Sutra&quot;) - Like the &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; this sutra also teaches the eternity of Buddhas (and their docetic nature) and the four perfections of permanence, bliss, self and purity as qualities of the Buddha. It also discusses the non-dual nature of all sentient beings with the Dharmadhatu along with four hundred types of samādhi.
* The &quot;Dhāraṇīśvararāja sūtra&quot; is a key source for the &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot;&#x27;s seven main vajra topics. It explicitly points out that the nature of the minds of sentient beings is fundamentally pure (&quot;cittaprakrtivisuddhi&quot;). 
* The &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot; (compiled 350–400 CE) synthesized the tathāgatagarbha doctrine and teachings of the Yogācāra school, like the ālāya-vijñāna (storehouse consciousness) and the &quot;three natures&quot;. According to the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra&quot;, tathāgatagarbha is the same as the ālayavijñāna (though this is qualified in other passages which explain that there are two layers of the ālayavijñāna, a pure and an impure layer). The storehouse consciousness is supposed to contain the pure tathāgatagarbha, from which awakening arises. Wayman notes that this synthesis of tathāgatagarbha thought and Yogacara Buddhism is a key innovation of the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra.&quot;
* The &quot;Ghanavyūha sūtra&quot; is another sutra which synthesizes Yogācāra doctrines like the three natures and the ālayavijñāna (storehouse consciousness) with the tathāgatagarbha teaching&quot;.&quot;

==Indian commentaries==
The &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; doctrine was also widely discussed by Indian Mahayana scholars in treatises or commentaries, called śāstra, the most influential of which was the Ratnagotravibhāga (5th century CE).

===&quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot;===

The &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot; (&quot;Investigating the Jewel Disposition&quot;)&quot;,&quot; also called &quot;Uttaratantraśāstra&quot; (&quot;Treatise on the Ultimate Continuum&quot;), is a 5th century CE Indian treatise (śāstra) which synthesised major elements and themes of the tathāgatagārbha theory. It gives an overview of key themes found in many tathāgatagarbha sutras, and it cites the &quot;Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra&quot;, the &quot;Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra&quot;, &quot;Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot;, the &quot;Aṅgulimālīya Sūtra&quot;, the &quot;Anunatva-Apurnatva-Nirdesa&quot; and the &quot;Mahābherīharaka-sūtra&quot;. The &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot; presents the tathāgatagarbha as &quot;an ultimate, unconditional reality that is simultaneously the inherent, dynamic process towards its complete manifestation&quot;. Mundane and enlightened reality are seen as complementary:
In the &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot;, the tathāgatagarbha is seen as having three specific characteristics: (1) dharmakaya, (2) suchness, and (3) disposition, as well as the general characteristic (4) non-conceptuality.

According to the &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot;, all sentient beings have &quot;the embryo of the Tathagata&quot; in three senses:
# the Tathāgata&#x27;s dharmakāya permeates all sentient beings;
# the Tathāgata&#x27;s &quot;tathatā&quot; is omnipresent (&quot;avyatibheda&quot;);
# the Tathāgata&#x27;s species (&quot;gotra&quot;, a synonym for tathagatagarbha) occurs in them.

The &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot; equates enlightenment with the nirvāṇa-realm and the dharmakāya. It gives a variety of synonyms for &quot;garbha&quot;, the most frequently used being &quot;gotra&quot; and &quot;dhatu&quot;.

This text also explains the tathāgatagarbha in terms of luminous mind, stating that &quot;the luminous nature of the mind Is unchanging, just like space.&quot;

=== Other possible Indian treatises on buddha-nature ===
Takasaki Jikido notes various buddha nature treatises which exist only in Chinese and which are similar in some ways to the &quot;Ratnagotra&quot;. These works are unknown in other textual traditions and scholars disagree on whether they are translations, original compositions or a mixture of the two. These works are:

* &quot;Dharmadhātvaviśeṣaśāstra&quot; (&quot;Dasheng fajie wuchabie lun&quot; 大乘法界無差別論), said to have been translated by Paramartha and attributed to Saramati (the same author which the Chinese tradition states wrote the &quot;Ratnagotra&quot;).
* &quot;Buddhagotraśāstra&quot; (佛性論, &quot;Fó xìng lùn, Buddha-nature treatise&quot;, Taishō 1610), said to have been translated by Paramartha and is attributed by Chinese tradition to Vasubandhu
* &quot;Anuttarâśrayasūtra&quot;, which according to Takasaki &quot;is clearly a composition based upon the Ratna.&quot;

=== Madhyamaka school ===
Indian Madhyamaka philosophers interpreted the theory as a description of emptiness and as a non implicative negation. Bhaviveka&#x27;s &quot;Tarkajvala&quot; states:

According to Candrakirti&#x27;s &quot;Madhyamakāvatārabhāsya&quot; the storehouse consciousness &quot;is nothing but emptiness that is taught through the term &#x27;alaya-consciousness.&#x27;&quot; Go Lotsawa states that this statement is referencing the tathāgatagarbha doctrine. Candrakirti&#x27;s &quot;Madhyamakāvatārabhāsya&quot; also argues, basing itself on the &quot;Lankavatara sutra&quot;, that &quot;the statement of the emptiness of sentient beings being a buddha adorned with all major and minor marks is of expedient meaning&quot;.

Kamalasila&#x27;s (c. 740–795) &quot;Madhyamakaloka&quot; associates tathāgatagarbha with luminosity and luminosity with emptiness. According to Kamalasila the idea that all sentient beings have tathāgatagarbha means that all beings can attain full awakening and also refers to how &quot;the term tathāgata expresses that the dharmadhātu, which is characterized by personal and phenomenal identitylessness, is natural luminosity.&quot;

Paul Williams puts forward the Madhyamaka interpretation of the buddha-nature as emptiness in the following terms:

Uniquely among Madhyamaka texts, some texts attributed to Nagarjuna, mainly poetic works like the &quot;Dharmadhatustava, Cittavajrastava&quot;, and &quot;Bodhicittavivarana,&quot; associate the term tathāgatagarbha with the luminous nature of the mind.

=== Yogācāra school ===
According to Brunnholzl, &quot;all early Indian Yogācāra masters (such as Asanga, Vasubandhu, Sthiramati, and Asvabhava), if they refer to the term tathāgatagarbha at all, always explain it as nothing but suchness in the sense of twofold identitylessness&quot;.

Some later Yogacara scholars spoke of the tathāgatagarbha in more positive terms, such as Jñanasrimitra who in his &quot;Sakarasiddhi&quot; equates it with the appearances of lucidity (prakāśa-rupa). Likewise, the Vikramashila scholar Ratnākaraśānti describes buddha-nature as the natural luminous mind, which is a non-dual self-awareness. Brunnholzl also notes that for Ratnākaraśānti, this luminosity is equivalent to the Yogacara concept of the perfected nature, which he sees as an implicative negation. Ratnākaraśānti also describes this ultimate self-nature as radiance (prakāśa, ‘shining forth’), which is the capacity to appear (pratibhāsa).

The Yogācāra concept of the alaya-vijñana (store consciousness) also came to be associated by some scholars with the tathāgatagarbha. This can be seen in sutras like the &quot;Lankavatara&quot;, the &quot;Srimaladevi&quot; and in the translations of Paramartha. The concept of the ālaya-vijñāna originally meant defiled consciousness: defiled by the workings of the five senses and the mind. It was also seen as the mūla-vijñāna, the base-consciousness or &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; (Mindstream) from which awareness and perception spring.

Around 300 CE, the Yogācāra school systematized the prevalent ideas on the nature of the Buddha in the Trikaya (triple body) doctrine, in which the Buddha is held to have three bodies: Nirmanakaya (transformation body which people see on earth), Sambhogakāya (a subtle body which appears to bodhisattvas) and the Dharmakāya (ultimate reality). This doctrine was also later to be synthesized with buddha-nature teachings by various sources (with buddha-nature generally referring to the Dharmakaya as it does in some sutras).

The Yogācāra school also had a doctrine of &quot;gotra&quot; (lineage, family) which held that there were five categories of living beings each with their own inner nature. To make this teaching compatible with the notion of buddha-nature in all beings, Yogācāra scholars in China such as Tz&#x27;u-en (慈恩, 632–682) the first patriarch in China, advocated two types of nature: the latent nature found in all beings (理佛性) and the buddha-nature in practice (行佛性). The latter nature was determined by the innate seeds in the alaya.

==East Asian Buddhism==

The doctrines associated with buddha-nature (Chinese: &quot;fóxìng&quot;) and tathāgatagarbha (&quot;rúláizàng&quot;) were extremely influential in the development of East Asian Buddhism. The buddha-nature idea was introduced into China with the translation of the &quot;Nirvana Sutra&quot; in the early fifth century and this text became the central source of buddha-nature doctrine in Chinese Buddhism. When Buddhism was introduced to China, it was initially understood through comparing it with native Chinese philosophies such as neo-daoism. Based on their understanding of the &quot;Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra&quot; some Chinese Buddhists supposed that the teaching of the buddha-nature was, as stated by that sutra, the final Buddhist teaching, and that there is an essential truth above emptiness and the two truths. This idea was often interpreted as being similar to the ideas of the Dao, non-being (&quot;wu&quot;), and Principle (Li) in Chinese philosophy and developed into what was called &quot;essence-function&quot; thought (體用, pinyin: &quot;tǐ yòng&quot;) which held there were two main ontological levels to reality, the most foundational being the buddha-nature, the &quot;essence&quot; of all phenomena (which in turn were the &quot;functions&quot; of buddha-nature).

===&quot;Awakening of Faith in the Mahāyāna&quot;===

&quot;The Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana&quot; (&quot;Dàshéng Qǐxìn Lùn&quot;) was very influential in the development of Chinese Buddhism While the text is traditionally attributed to the Indian Aśvaghoṣa, no Sanskrit version of the text is extant. The earliest known versions are written in Chinese, and contemporary scholars believe that the text is a Chinese composition.

&quot;The Awakening of Faith&quot; offers an ontological synthesis of buddha-nature and Yogacara thought from the perspective of &quot;essence-function&quot; philosophy. It describes the &quot;One Mind&quot; which &quot;includes in itself all states of being of the phenomenal and transcendental world. The &quot;Awakening of Faith&quot; tries to harmonize the ideas of the tathāgatagarbha and the storehouse consciousness (ālāyavijñāna) into a single theory which sees self, world, mind and ultimate realty as an integrated &quot;one mind&quot;, which is the ultimate substratum of all things (including samsara and nirvana).

In the &quot;Awakening of Faith&quot; the &quot;one mind&quot; has two aspects, namely &quot;the aspect of enlightenment,&quot; (which is &quot;tathata&quot;, suchness, the true nature of things), and &quot;the aspect of nonenlightenment&quot; (&quot;samsara&quot;, the cycle of birth and death, defilement and ignorance). This text was in line with an essay by Emperor Wu of the Liang dynasty (reign 502–549 CE), in which he postulated a pure essence, the enlightened mind, trapped in darkness, which is ignorance. By this ignorance the pure mind is trapped in samsara. This resembles the &quot;tathāgatagarba&quot; and the idea of the defilement of the luminous mind.

In a similar fashion to the &quot;Awakening of Faith&quot;, the Korean &quot;Vajrasamādhi Sūtra&quot; (685 CE) uses the doctrine of Essence-Function to explain the tathāgatagarbha (also called &quot;the dharma of the one mind&quot; and original enlightenment) as having two elements: one essential, immutable, changeless and still (the &quot;essence&quot;); the other an active and salvational inspirational power (function).

===Strong tathāgatagarbha theory versus weak tathāgatagarbha theory===
According to Ching Keng, there are two different types of tathāgatagarbha theory: [1] weak tathāgatagarbha theory, associated with texts such as the Ratnagotravibhāga; and [2] strong tathāgatagarbha theory, associated with such texts as the Awakening of Faith. 

According to the weak theory, although thusness pervades all sentient beings, it is strictly unchanging and unconditioned. Thus, it can have no effects in sentient beings and does not play an active role in their liberation. On the other hand, strong tathāgatagarbha theory blurs the distinction between the conditioned and the unconditioned and maintains that thusness, while unconditioned, nonetheless evolves into conditioned dharmas. Keng associates the weak theory with the Indian understanding of tathāgatagarbha and the strong theory with that of Chinese Buddhism. 

Similarly, Buswell observes that while the passive aspect of the tathāgatagarbha can be seen from the earliest stratum of tathāgatagarbha literature, East Asian texts such as Wŏnhyo&#x27;s commentary on the Vajrasamādhi Sūtra emphasize the tathāgatagarbha as an active agent which constantly exerts a beneficial influence on sentient beings.

=== In Chinese Yogacara and Madhyamaka ===
By the 6th century CE buddha nature had been well established in Chinese Buddhism and a wide variety of theories developed to explain it. One influential figure who wrote about buddha nature was Jingying Huiyuan (523–592 CE), a Chinese Yogacarin who argued for a kind of idealism which held that &quot;all dharmas without exception originate and are formed from the true[-mind], and other than the true[-mind], there exists absolutely nothing which can give rise to false thoughts.&quot; Jingying Huiyuan equated this &quot;true mind&quot; with the storehouse consciousness and with buddha-nature and held that it was an essence, a true consciousness and a metaphysical principle that ensured that all sentient beings will reach enlightenment.

In the sixth and seventh centuries, Yogacara theory became associated with a substantialist non-dual metaphysics which saw buddha nature as an eternal ground. This idea was promoted by figures like Ratnamati. Chinese Yogacara included numerous traditions with their own interpretations of buddha-nature. The Dilun or Daśabhūmikā school and the Shelun school were some of the earliest schools in this Chinese Yogacara. The Dilun school became split on the issue of the relationship between the storehouse consciousness and buddha-nature. The southern faction held that the storehouse consciousness was identical with the pure mind, while the northern school held that the storehouse consciousness was exclusively a deluded and defiled mind. In addition to the standard eight consciousnesses of classical Yogācāra, some Chinese Yogācāra schools such as the Shelun maintained the existence of an immaculate ninth consciousness known as the &quot;amalavijñāna,&quot; which lay beyond the eighth (&quot;ālayavijñāna&quot;, the storehouse consciousness), and served as the basis for all the other consciousnesses.

In contrast with the Chinese Yogacara view, the Chinese Madhyamaka scholar Jizang (549–623 CE) sought to remove all ontological connotations of the term as a metaphysical reality and saw buddha nature as being synonymous with terms like &quot;tathata,&quot; &quot;dharmadhatu,&quot; &quot;ekayana,&quot; &quot;wisdom, &quot; &quot;ultimate reality,&quot; &quot;middle way&quot; and also the wisdom that contemplates dependent origination. In formulating his view, Jizang was influenced by the earlier Chinese Madhyamaka thinker Sengzhao (384–414 CE) who was a key figure in outlining an understanding of emptiness which was based on the Indian sources and not on Daoist concepts which previous Chinese Buddhists had used. Jizang used the compound &quot;Middle Way-buddha-nature&quot; (&quot;zhongdao foxing&quot; 中道佛性) to refer to his view. Jizang was also one of the first Chinese philosophers to famously argue that plants and insentient objects have buddha-nature, which he also termed true reality and universal principle (&quot;dao&quot;).

=== In Tiantai ===
The Tiantai school is one of the first native Chinese doctrinal schools, and the primary figure of this tradition is the scholar Zhiyi. According to Paul L. Swanson, none of Zhiyi&#x27;s works discuss buddha-nature explicitly at length however. Yet it is still an important concept in his philosophy, which is seen as synonymous with the ekayana principle outlined in the Lotus Sutra. Swanson argues that for Zhiyi, buddha-nature is:

Thus, for Zhiyi, buddha-nature has three aspects which he bases on passages from the &quot;Lotus sutra&quot; and the &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot;. These three aspects are:

# The direct cause of attaining Buddhahood, the innate potential in all sentient beings to become Buddhas, which is the aspect of &#x27;true nature&#x27;, the way things are.
# The complete cause of attaining Buddhahood, which is the aspect of wisdom that illuminates the true nature and the goal of practice.
# The conditional causes of attaining Buddhahood, which is the aspect of the practices and activities that lead to Buddhahood.

The later Tiantai scholar Zhanran would expand the Tiantai view of buddha-nature, which he saw as synonymous with suchness, to argue for the idea that insentient rocks and plants also have buddha-nature.

=== In Huayan ===
The other major native Chinese doctrinal school is the Huayan school. The Huayan tradition heavily relied on buddha nature sources like the &quot;Awakening of Faith&quot; and on the doctrine of principle (理, &quot;li,&quot; or the ultimate pattern) and phenomena (&quot;shi)&quot;. In the Huayan tradition, the ultimate principle is associated with buddha-nature, and with the One Mind of the &quot;Awakening of Faith.&quot; This ultimate nature is seen as the ontological source and ground of all phenomena&quot;.&quot; This is a key idea in Huayan thought which is called &quot;nature-origination&quot; (&quot;xingqi&quot;)&quot;.&quot; According to this doctrine defended by Huayan thinkers like Fazang, the entire universe is a manifestation of the one nature, and it is also fully interfused with its source.&quot;&quot; As such, the ultimate principle is non-dual with all relative phenomena. Because the ultimate source of all things is also interdependent and interconnected with them, it remains a ground which is empty of self-existence (svabhava) and thus it is not an independent essence. &quot;&quot;

===In Chan Buddhism===

In Chan Buddhism, buddha-nature tends to be seen as the essential nature of all beings, while also emphasizing that buddha-nature is emptiness, the absence of an independent and substantial &quot;self&quot;. The term buddha-nature is interpreted in various ways throughout the voluminous Chan literature. In the East Mountain Teaching of early Chan, buddha-nature was equated with the nature of mind, while later sects sometimes rejected any identification of the term with the mind. This rejection of any reification of the term is reflected in the recorded sayings of Chan master Mazu Daoyi (709–788) of the influential Hongzhou school, who sometimes would teach on the &quot;ordinary mind&quot; or say &quot;Mind is Buddha,&quot; but at other times would say &quot;Neither mind nor Buddha.&quot;

The influential Chan patriarch Guifeng Zongmi (780–841), who was also a patriarch of Huayan, interpreted buddha-nature as &quot;empty tranquil awareness&quot; (&quot;k&#x27;ung-chi chih&quot;), which he took from the Ho-tse school of Chan. Following the &quot;Srimala sutra&quot;, he interpreted the theory of emptiness as presented in the Prajñaparamita sutras as provisional and saw the awareness which is buddha-nature as the definitive teaching of Buddhism.

Chan masters from Huineng (7th-century China), Chinul (12th century Korea), Hakuin Ekaku (18th-century Japan) to Hsu Yun (20th-century China), have taught that the process of awakening begins with the light of the mind turning around to recognize its own true nature, so that the storehouse consciousness (also called the 8th consciousness in Yogacara Buddhism), which is also the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot;, is transformed into the &quot;bright mirror wisdom&quot;. According to D.T. Suzuki, the Zen view of buddha-nature can be found in the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot;, which states that one must let go of all discriminating notions of any kind to attain the perfect knowledge of the tathāgatagarbha. According to the Platform Sūtra, the eight consciousnesses transform into the four wisdoms, and yet, only their names are transformed, the consciousnesses are not transformed in their essence.

A famous reference to buddha-nature in the Chan tradition is found in the influential koan called the mu-koan (from &quot;The Gateless Barrier,&quot; a 13th century koan collection) which asks &quot;does a dog have Buddha nature?&quot; The enigmatic response given by the master is &quot;no&quot; (&quot;wú&quot;, Chinese, &quot;mu&quot; in Japanese) which can interpreted in various ways.

According to Heng-Ching Shih, the teaching of the universal buddha-nature does not intend to assert the existence of substantial, entity-like self endowed with excellent features of a Buddha. Rather, buddha-nature simply represents the potentiality to be realized in the future. 

Hsing Yun, forty-eighth patriarch of the Linji school, equates the buddha-nature with the dharmakāya in line with pronouncements in key tathāgatagarbha sūtras. He defines these as &quot;the inherent nature that exists in all beings...transcendental reality...the unity of the Buddha with everything that exists,&quot; and sees it as the goal of Mahayana Buddhism.

=== Japanese Buddhism ===
The major Japanese Buddhist traditions all take the idea of buddha-nature (Japanese: &quot;busshō,&quot; 仏性) as a central teaching, from Tendai and Shingon, to the new Kamakura schools. One of the most important developments of buddha-nature thought in Japanese Buddhism was hongaku theory (本覚, innate or original enlightenment) which developed within the Tendai school from the cloistered rule era (1086–1185) through the Edo period (1688–1735) and is derived from the &quot;Awakening of Faith&quot; (which uses the term pen-chileh, “original enlightenment”). Jacqueline Stone writes that Tendai doctrine held that enlightenment was &quot;inherent from the outset and as accessible in the present, rather than as the fruit of a long process of cultivation.&quot; It was often held that hongaku was a feature of all phenomena, including plants and inanimate objects.

Hongaku thought was also influential on the development of New Kamakura Buddhist schools, like Japanese Pure Land Buddhism, Zen and Nichiren. Japanese Pure Land Buddhism relied on Tendai buddha-nature doctrine. The founder of the Jōdo Shinshū of Pure Land Buddhism, Shinran, equated buddha-nature with the central Shin concept of shinjin (true faith or the entrusting mind).

The founder of the Sōtō school of Zen Buddhism, Dōgen Zenji, held that buddha-nature was simply the true nature of reality and being. This true nature was just impermanence, becoming and &#x27;vast emptiness&#x27;. Because he saw the whole universe as an expression of buddha-nature, he held that even grass and trees are buddha-nature. According to Dōgen:

Buddha-nature was likewise influential for the other sects of Zen, like Rinzai.

Nichiren Buddhism, founded by Nichiren (1222–1282), views the buddha-nature present in all beings as &quot;the inner potential for attaining Buddhahood&quot;. The emphasis in Nichiren Buddhism is on attaining Buddhahood in this lifetime, described as manifesting or summoning forth buddha-nature by chanting the name of the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;: Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō Like the classic Tendai hongaku doctrine, Nichiren held that all life and even all insentient matter (such mandalas, images, statues) also possesses buddha nature, because they serve as objects of worship.

==Tibetan Buddhism==
In Tibetan Buddhist scholastics, there are two main camps of interpreting buddha-nature:

* There are those who argue that &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; is just emptiness (described either as dharmadhatu or the nature of phenomena). This pure Madhyamaka view is described in as &quot;a nonimplicative negation&quot;, which means that in one&#x27;s philosophical analysis, one negates all forms of existence (and non-existence) completely, leaving nothing left over.
* There are those who see it as an implicative negation, which means that there is something further to be said about buddha-nature that is not just the Madhyamaka emptiness based on pure negations of all concepts. This could include positive descriptions like the union of the mind&#x27;s emptiness and luminosity, a non-dual buddha-wisdom, or even the eternal pure buddhic Self which includes all buddha-qualities (as in Jonang Shentong).

An early Tibetan translator, Ngok Lotsawa (1050–1109) argues in his commentary to the &quot;Uttaratantra&quot; that buddha-nature is a non-implicative negation, which is to say that it is emptiness, as a &quot;total negation&quot; of inherent existence (&quot;svabhava&quot;) that does not imply that anything is left un-negated (in terms of its &quot;svabhava&quot;). Another early figure, Chaba Chokyi Senge (1109–1169) also argued that buddha-nature was a non-implicative negation. The Kadampa tradition generally followed Ngok Lotsawa by holding that Buddha- nature was a nonimplicative negation. The Gelug school, which sees itself as a continuation of the Kadampas, also hold this view, while also holding, as Chaba did, that buddha-nature teachings are of expedient meaning.

This interpretation is sometimes called the &quot;rangtong&quot; interpretation of Prasaṅgika Madhyamaka. This view interprets the buddha-nature teaching as an expedient way to talk about the emptiness of inherent existence and should not be taken literally. Other schools, especially the Jonang, and some within the Kagyu tradition have tended to accept the shentong (&quot;other-empty&quot;) philosophy, which discerns an ultimate reality which &quot;is empty of adventitious defilements which are intrinsically other than it, but is &quot;not&quot; empty of its own inherent existence&quot;. Shentong influenced interpretations tend to rely heavily on the buddha-nature sutras to balance the negative dialectics of Madhyamaka.

These interpretations of the tathagatagarbha-teachings have been a matter of intensive debates in Tibetan Buddhism down to this day.

===Nyingma===
Morten Ostensen writes that the buddha-nature teaching (also known as &quot;sugatagarbha&quot;, Wylie: &quot;bde gshegs snying po,&quot; in Tibetan tantric sources), first entered Tibetan Buddhism through the translation of the Nyingma school&#x27;s &quot;Guhyagarbha Tantra&quot; in the eighth century. During the early translation period, other works which synthesized and reconciled buddha-nature thought with Yogacara and Madhyamaka philosophy were also translated by Tibetan scholars like Yeshe De (mid 8th – early 9th century). One of these works is Kamalashila&quot;s &quot;Madhyamakāloka&quot;.

Yeshe De describes the sugatagarbha as twofold. It is the impure mind of sentient beings, the &quot;ālayavijñāna&quot;, and it is also the pure &quot;natural spiritual disposition&quot; (rigs) that is present within all beings which is also called the dharmakāya, and which he also calls the root (&quot;rtsa&quot;) and the ground (&quot;gzhi&quot;).

The teaching of buddha-nature is also a key source for Tibetan Dzogchen texts, which presents the sugatagarbha as equivalent to the ultimate ground or basis of all reality. This teaching can be found in early Dzogchen sources like Nubchen Sangye Yeshe&#x27;s (9th century) &quot;Lamp for the Eye of Contemplation&quot; equates buddha-nature with this ultimate basis, which it also calls by various names like &quot;the spontaneous essence&quot;, &quot;the innermost treasury of all vehicles&quot;, &quot;the great universal grandfather [spyi myes], is to be experienced directly by self-awareness [rang rig pas]&quot;, &quot;sphere of the great circle [thig le chen po&#x27;i klong] of the self-awareness.&quot;

The Nyingma school view of buddha-nature is generally marked by the tendency to align the idea with Dzogchen views and with Prasangika Madhyamaka. This trend begins with the work of Rongzom (1042–1136) and continues into the work of Longchenpa (1308–1364) and Mipham (1846–1912). 

Mipham Rinpoche, the most authoritative figure in modern Nyingma, adopted a view of buddha-nature as the unity of appearance and emptiness, relating it to the descriptions of the ground in Dzogchen as outlined by Longchenpa. This ground is said to be primordially pure (ka dag) and spontaneously present (Ihun grub). In Dzogchen, buddha nature, which is equated with the basis (gzhi) of all phenomena, is often explained as the unity of &quot;primordial purity&quot; (Wylie: &quot;ka dag&quot;) and &quot;natural perfection&quot; or &quot;spontaneous presence&quot; (&quot;lhun grub&quot;). The Nyingma commentary of Ju Mipham upon the &quot;Ratnagotravibhaga&quot; from a Dzogchen viewpoint has been rendered into English by Duckworth (2008).

According to Mipham, buddha-nature was neither [1] truly established, [2] a mere emptiness, nor [3] an impermanent and conditioned entity. In this way, he distinguished his unique position on buddha-nature from those of the Jonang, Gelug, and Sakya; which correspond respectively to the first, second, and third positions. Moreover, as Mipham&#x27;s commentator Bötrül points out, for Mipham, buddha-nature was neither established from the point of view of ultimate valid cognition, nor was it posited merely from the point of view of the mistaken perception of ordinary beings. Mipham instead held that buddha-nature was established by a conventional valid cognition of pure vision.

The modern Nyingma scholars Khenchen Palden Sherab (1938–2010) and Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal (born 1950), emphasise that the essential nature of the mind (the buddha-nature) is not a blankness, but is characterized by wonderful qualities and a non-conceptual perfection that is already present and complete, it&#x27;s just obscured and we fail to recognize it.

=== Sakya ===
Sakya Pandita (1182–1251), the central figure of the Sakya school, sees the buddha-nature as the dharmadhatu free from all reference points, and states that the teaching that buddha-nature exists in all beings is of expedient meaning (not ultimate) and that its basis is emptiness, citing Candrakirti&#x27;s &quot;Madhyamakāvatārabhāsya&quot;. The Sakya scholar Rongtön (1367–1449) meanwhile, argued that buddha-nature is suchness, with stains, or emptiness of the mind with stains.

Sakya scholar Buton Rinchen Drub (1290–1364) likewise held that the buddha-nature teachings were not an ultimate or final teaching (like emptiness), seeing them as teachings of expedient meaning that merely points to emptiness. His view was that the basis for these teachings is the alaya-vijñana and also that buddha-nature is the dharmakaya of a buddha but &quot;never exists in the great mass of sentient beings&quot;.

According to Brunnholzl, in the works of the influential Sakya scholar Gorampa Sonam Senge (1429–1489), buddha-nature is

Sakya Chokden (1428–1507) meanwhile argues that the ultimate buddha-nature is an implicative negation, which means that its philosophical negation leaves something positive that is not negated by analysis. This is &quot;mind&#x27;s natural luminosity free from all extremes of reference points, which is the sphere of personally experienced wisdom.&quot;

===Jonang===
The Jonang school, whose foremost historical figure was the Tibetan scholar-monk Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen (1292–1361), sees the buddha-nature as the very ground of the Buddha himself, as the &quot;permanent indwelling of the Buddha in the basal state&quot;. According to Brunnholzl, Dolpopa, basing himself on certain &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; sutras, argued that the buddha-nature is &quot;ultimately really established, everlasting, eternal, permanent, immutable (therzug), and being beyond dependent origination.&quot; This is the foundation of what is called the Shentong view.

The Buddhist tantric scripture entitled &quot;Chanting the Names of Mañjuśrī ()&quot;, repeatedly exalts, as portrayed by Dolpopa, not the non-Self but the Self, and applies the following terms to this ultimate reality: &quot;the Buddha-Self, the beginningless Self, the solid Self, the diamond Self.&quot; These terms are applied in a manner which reflects the cataphatic approach to Buddhism, typical of much of Dolpopa&#x27;s writings.

Cyrus Stearns writes that Dolpopa&#x27;s attitude to the third turning of the wheel (i.e. the buddha-nature teachings) is that they &quot;are the final definitive statements on the nature of ultimate reality, the primordial ground or substratum beyond the chain of dependent origination, and which is only empty of other, relative phenomena.&quot;

===Kagyu===
According to Brunnholzl, &quot;virtually all Kagyu masters hold the teaching on buddha nature to be of definitive meaning and deny that the tathagata heart is just sheer emptiness or a nonimplicative negation.&quot; This means that most Kagyu scholars do not think that the strictly negative Madhyamaka explanation of buddha-nature is suffient on its own (without drawing on the buddha-nature sutras) to explain buddha-nature. Some Kagyu views can be similar to Jonang shentong and sometimes use shentong language, but they are generally less absolutist than Jonang views (the exception is Jamgon Kongtrul Lodro Taye, who largely follows Taranatha and Dolpopa but at times blends their positions with the Third Karmapa&#x27;s view).

In Kagyu, the view of the Third Karmapa Rangjung Dorje is generally seen as the most authoritative. His is the view that buddha-nature is &quot;mind&#x27;s luminous ultimate nature or nondual wisdom, which is the basis of everything in samsara and nirvana.&quot; Thrangu Rinpoche sees the Buddha-nature as the indivisible oneness of wisdom and emptiness:

=== Gelug ===
Kedrub Jé Geleg Balsang (1385–1438), one of the main disciples of Tsongkhapa, defined the tathāgatagarbha thus:

Brunnholzl states that the view of Gyaltsab Darma Rinchen (1364–1432) is that buddha-nature (the tathagata heart) is &quot;the state of a being in whom mind&#x27;s emptiness is obscured, while buddhas by definition do not possess this tathagata heart.&quot;

The 14th Dalai Lama sees the buddha-nature as the &quot;original clear light of mind&quot;, but points out that it ultimately does not exist independently, because, like all other phenomena, it is of the nature of emptiness:

===Rimé movement===
The Rimé movement is an ecumenical movement in Tibet which started as an attempt to reconcile the various Tibetan schools in the 19th century. In contrast to the Gelugpa, which adheres to the &quot;rang stong&quot;, &quot;self-empty&quot;, or Prasaṅgika point of view, the Rimé movement supports &quot;shen tong&quot; (&quot;gzhan tong&quot;), &quot;other-empty&quot;, an essential nature which is &quot;pure radiant non-dual consciousness&quot;.

According to Rime scholar Jamgon Kongtrul rangtong and shentong are not ultimately different as both can reach the ultimate state in practice. However, they do differ in how they describe ultimate reality (Dharmata), since shentong describes the buddha-mind as ultimately real, while rangtong rejects this (fearing it will be confused as an atman). Kongtrul &quot;finds the Rangtong way of presentation the best to dissolve concepts and the Shentong way the best to describe the experience.&quot;

==Modern scholarship==
Modern scholarship points to the various possible interpretations of buddha-nature as either an essential self, as Sunyata, or as the &quot;inherent possibility&quot; of awakening.

===Essential self===
Shenpen Hookham, Oxford Buddhist scholar and Tibetan lama of the Shentong tradition writes of the buddha-nature or &quot;true self&quot; as something real and permanent, and already present within the being as uncompounded enlightenment. She calls it &quot;the Buddha within&quot;, and writes that the Buddha, Nirvana and Buddha-wisdom can be referred to as the &quot;True Self&quot; (as it is done in some buddha-nature sutras). According to Hookham, in the shentong interpretation, buddha-nature is what truly exists, while not-self is what it is not.

Buddhist scholar and chronicler, Merv Fowler, writes that &quot;the main message of the &quot;tathagatagarbha&quot; literature&quot; is that buddha-nature really is present as &quot;a hidden essence&quot; within each being. According to Fowler, this view is &quot;the idea that enlightenment, or nirvana, is not something which has to be achieved, it is something which is already there... In a way, it means that everyone is really a Buddha &quot;now&quot;.&quot;

===Emptiness===
According to Heng-Ching Shih, buddha-nature does not represent a substantial self (&quot;ātman&quot;). Rather, it is a positive expression of emptiness (&quot;śūnyatā&quot;), which emphasizes the potentiality to realize Buddhahood through Buddhist practices. In this view, the intention of the teaching of buddha-nature is soteriological rather than theoretical.

The influential 20th century Chinese scholar Yin Shun (印順, 1906 – 2005) drew on Chinese Madhyamaka to argue against any Yogacara influenced view that buddha-nature was an underlying permanent ground of reality and instead supported the view that buddha-nature teachings are just an expedient means. Yin Shun, drawing on his study of Indian Madhyamaka promoted the emptiness of all things as the ultimate Buddhist truth, and argued that the buddha-nature teaching was a provisional teaching taught in order to ease the fear of some Buddhists regarding emptiness as well as to attract those people who have an affinity to the idea of a Self or Brahman. Later after taking up the Buddhist path, they would be introduced to the truth of emptiness.

===Critical Buddhist interpretation===
Several contemporary Japanese Buddhist scholars, headed under the label Critical Buddhism (&quot;hihan bukky&quot;ō, 批判仏教), have been critical of buddha-nature thought. According to Matsumoto Shirõ and Hakamaya Noriaki of Komazawa University, essentialist conceptions of buddha-nature are at odds with the fundamental Buddhist doctrine of dependent origination and non-self (&quot;anātman&quot;&quot;)&quot;. The Buddha nature doctrines which they label as &quot;dhātuvāda&quot; (&quot;substantialism&quot;, sometimes rendered &quot;locus theory&quot; or &quot;topicalism&quot; and &quot;generative monism&quot;) is not Buddhist at all. As defined by Matsumoto, this &quot;locus&quot; theory or &quot;dhātuvāda&quot; which he rejects as un-buddhist is: &quot;It is the theory that the single (&quot;eka, sama&quot;) existent &quot;locus&quot; (&quot;dhatu&quot;) or basis is the cause that produces the manifold phenomena or &quot;super-loci&quot; (&quot;dharmah&quot;).&quot; Matsumoto further argues that: &quot;Tathagatagarbha thought was a Buddhist version of Hindu monism, formed by the influence of Hinduism gradually introduced into Buddhism, especially after the rise of Mahayana Buddhism.&quot; Other Japanese scholars responded to this view leading to a lively debate in Japan. Takasaki Jikido, a well known authority on &quot;tathagathagarbha&quot; thought, accepted that Buddha nature theories are similar to Upanishadic theories and that &quot;dhātuvāda&quot; is an accurate expression of the structure of these doctrines&quot;,&quot; but argues that the Buddha nature texts are aware of this and that Buddha nature is not necessarily un-Buddhist or anti-Buddhist. Likewise, Hirakawa Akira, sees buddha-nature as the potential to attain Buddhahood which is not static but ever changing and argues that &quot;dhātu&quot; does not necessarily mean substratum (he points to some Agamas which identify &quot;dhatu&quot; with &quot;pratitya-samutpada&quot;).

Western scholars have reacted in different ways to this idea. Sallie B. King objects to their view, seeing the buddha-nature as a metaphor for the potential in all beings to attain Buddhahood, rather than as an ontological reality. Robert H. Sharf notes that the worries of the Critical Buddhists is nothing new, for &quot;the early &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; scriptures betray a similar anxiety, as they tacitly acknowledge that the doctrine is close to, if not identical with, the heretical ātmavāda teachings of the non- Buddhists.&quot; He also notes how the &quot;Nirvāṇa-sūtra&quot; &quot;tacitly concedes the non-Buddhist roots of the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; idea.&quot; Sharf also has pointed out how certain Southern Chan masters were concerned with other interpretations of Buddha nature, showing how the tendency to critique certain views of Buddha nature is not new in East Asian Buddhism.

Peter N. Gregory has also argued that at least some East Asian interpretations of Buddha nature are equivalent to what Critical Buddhists call &quot;dhātuvāda,&quot; especially the work of Tsung-mi, who &quot;emphasizes the underlying ontological ground on which all phenomenal appearances (&quot;hsiang&quot;) are based, which he variously refers to as the nature (&quot;hsing&quot;), the one mind (&quot;i-hsin&quot;)...&quot;. According to Dan Lusthaus, certain Chinese Buddhist ideologies which became dominant in the 8th century promoted the idea of an &quot;underlying metaphysical substratum&quot; or &quot;underlying, invariant, universal metaphysical &#x27;source&#x27;&quot; and thus do seem to be a kind of &quot;dhātuvāda.&quot; According to Lusthaus &quot;in early T&#x27;ang China (7th–8th century) there was a deliberate attempt to divorce Chinese Buddhism from developments in India.&quot; Lusthaus notes that the Huayen thinker Fa-tsang was influential in this theological trend who promoted the idea that true Buddhism was about comprehending the &quot;One Mind that alone is the ground of reality&quot; (&quot;wei- hsin).&quot;

Paul Williams too has criticised this view, saying that Critical Buddhism is too narrow in its definition of what constitutes Buddhism. According to Williams, &quot;We should abandon any simplistic identification of Buddhism with a straightforward not-Self definition&quot;.

===Multiple meanings===
Sutton agrees with Williams&#x27; critique on the narrowness of any single interpretation. In discussing the inadequacy of modern scholarship on buddha-nature, Sutton states, &quot;One is impressed by the fact that these authors, as a rule, tend to opt for a single meaning disregarding all other possible meanings which are embraced in turn by other texts&quot;. He goes on to point out that the term &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; has up to six possible connotations. Of these, he says the three most important are:
#an underlying ontological reality or essential nature (&quot;tathāgata-tathatā-&#x27;vyatireka&quot;) which is functionally equivalent to a &quot;self&quot; (&quot;ātman&quot;) in an &quot;Upanishadic&quot; sense,
#the &quot;dharmakāya&quot; which penetrates all beings (&quot;sarva-sattveṣu dharma-kāya-parispharaṇa&quot;), which is functionally equivalent to brahman in an &quot;Upanishadic&quot; sense
#the womb or matrix of Buddhahood existing in all beings &quot;(tathāgata-gotra-saṃbhava&quot;), which provides beings with the possibility of awakening.
Of these three, Sutton claims that only the third connotation has any soteriological significance, while the other two posit buddha-nature as an ontological reality and essential nature behind all phenomena.

<text>Benjamin Henry Grierson (July 8, 1826 – August 31, 1911) was a music teacher from Illinois who, although afraid of horses, volunteered for service in the cavalry during the Civil War, commanding a cavalry division Army of the Tennessee and reaching the rank of major general in the United States Volunteers. He is most noted for Grierson&#x27;s Raid, an 1863 expedition through Confederate-held territory that severed enemy communication lines between Vicksburg, Mississippi and Confederate commanders in the Eastern Theater. After the war he became colonel of the 10th Cavalry Regiment, an African-American regiment from 1866 until his retirement in 1890. 

Grierson was born in Pennsylvania, but moved to the Midwest where he earned his living as a music teacher and as a partner in an unsuccessful mercantile business. He began his military career as a volunteer aide-de-camp but was soon advanced to major of cavalry. After six months he was promoted to the command of his regiment and before long to the command of a cavalry brigade, and finally of a cavalry division. As colonel of an African-American regiment he was disliked by his superiors and fellow officers due to his support for and trust in his black troops. His 26 years of postwar service was spent in garrison and in the field at the southwestern frontier.
==Early life and career==

Grierson was born in the borough of Allegheny, Pennsylvania, today a section of Pittsburgh. He was the youngest of five siblings. Grierson became afraid of horses when, at age eight, he was kicked and nearly killed by a horse, after which he hated horses. In 1851, he became a music teacher and band leader in Jacksonville, Illinois. From 1855 to 1861 Grierson was a partner in an unsuccessful mercantile business in Meredosia, Illinois, and was active in Republican politics. He married Alice Kirk of Youngstown, Ohio on September 24, 1854. The couple had seven children, four of whom survived to adulthood.

==Civil War==

With the outbreak of the Civil War, Grierson enlisted as a volunteer aide-de-camp to Maj. Gen. Benjamin M. Prentiss. Promoted to major on October 24, 1861, he joined the 6th Illinois Cavalry and was promoted to colonel of that regiment on April 13, 1862. His regiment was engaged in a number of small skirmishes and raids on railroads and facilities in Tennessee and Mississippi that spring and summer. In November, he became a brigade commander in the Cavalry Division of the Army of the Tennessee. In December, he participated in the pursuit of Confederate Earl Van Dorn after his Holly Springs raid against the supply lines of General Ulysses S. Grant.

In the spring of 1863, he led Grierson&#x27;s Raid, a major diversionary thrust deep into the Confederacy, ordered by Grant as part of his Vicksburg Campaign. Grierson departed from La Grange, Tennessee, on April 17, in command of 1,700 men of the 6th and 7th Illinois and the 2nd Iowa Cavalry regiments. Over 17 days, his command marched 800 miles, repeatedly engaged the Confederates, disabled two railroads, captured many prisoners and horses, and destroyed vast amounts of property, finally ending in Baton Rouge on May 2. Historian John D. Winters in &quot;The Civil War in Louisiana&quot; (1963) reports that Grierson&#x27;s raid &quot;struck fear in the hearts of the citizens and somewhat demoralized the Confederate forces who failed to stop the move.&quot;

More importantly, Grierson diverted the attention of the Confederate defenders of Vicksburg away from General Grant&#x27;s main thrust. Gen. Sherman considered Grierson&#x27;s raid &quot;the most brilliant expedition of the war.&quot; Grierson was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers in June. While ending his raid in Louisiana he was able to take part in Nathaniel P. Banks&#x27; siege of Port Hudson as commander of the XIX Corps cavalry.

In June 1864 Grierson returned to command a cavalry division in the Army of the Tennessee during William T. Sherman&#x27;s Meridian Campaign. He was still in division command during Samuel D. Sturgis&#x27; ill-fated encounter with Nathan B. Forrest at the Battle of Brice&#x27;s Crossroads. Shortly after that battle Grierson was transferred to command the Cavalry in the District of West Tennessee. He was attached to Andrew J. Smith&#x27;s XVI Corps and fared much better against Forrest at the Battle of Tupelo.

Between December 21, 1864, and January 5, 1865, Grierson led an expedition of two brigades of the Cavalry Division against the Mobile and Ohio Railroad. On Christmas Day he surprised and captured Forrest&#x27;s dismounted camp at Verona, Mississippi, and on December 28 engaged a train carrying an &quot;ad hoc&quot; Confederate force of approximately 1,200 men at Egypt Station, Mississippi, south of Aberdeen, capturing more than 500 troops, including 253 former Union prisoners who had enlisted as &quot;Galvanized Yankees&quot; in the 10th Tennessee. For this expedition Grierson received a brevet promotion to the rank of major general.

In the spring of 1865, he took part in Canby&#x27;s successful campaign to capture Mobile, Alabama.

==Postbellum service in the West==

Grierson decided to pursue a career in the Regular Army after the war, which was unusual for an officer whose only prior military service was as a volunteer officer during the Civil War. His lack of West Point credentials made him suspect to many fellow officers. On 28 July 1866 he was commissioned a colonel in the Regular Army and assigned as the commander of the 10th U.S. Cavalry, one of two mounted regiments composed of black enlisted men and white officers, called the Buffalo Soldiers. This assignment also made him unpopular with other officers, including his superior, General Philip Henry Sheridan, because of his support for and trust in his troops. His sympathy and courtesy to Native American tribes also led to questions about his judgment. 


===Postbellum command history===
*1867–69: Commanded Fort Riley, then later Fort Gibson.
*1868–69: Headed the District of the Indian Territory.
*1869–72: Selected the site for Camp Wichita, later renamed Fort Sill, Oklahoma, with the 10th Cavalry. Supervised construction and acted as post commander. He angered residents of the Texas frontier with his support of the peace policy on the Kiowa-Comanche Reservation. Saved the life of visiting General William Tecumseh Sherman, during a confrontation with Lone Wolf, principal chief of the Kiowa, over responsibility for an attack on a wagon train near Salt Creek Prairie, Texas.
*1873–74: Superintendent of the Mounted Recruiting Service at St. Louis.
*1875–78: Commander at Fort Concho, Texas.
*1878–80: Commander of the District of the Pecos. In 1880 he helped defeat Victorio to end the Indian threat to West Texas.
*1882–82: Moved his headquarters to Fort Davis, Texas.
*1883–83: Commanded the Department of Texas in September and October.
*1885–86: Transferred to Arizona, commanded Whipple Barracks and later Fort Grant.
*1886–88: Commanded the District of New Mexico. There he dealt sympathetically and effectively with problems on the Jicarilla and Navajo reservations.
*1888–90: Commanded the Department of Arizona.
*April 5, 1890: Promoted to Brigadier General.
*July 8, 1890: Retired, having reached the mandatory retirement age of 64.

His wife, Alice, died August 14, 1888. Grierson much later married Lillian Atwood King, a widow, on July 28, 1897. During his life, he had homes in Jacksonville, Illinois, Fort Concho, and a summer home at Omena, Michigan. In 1907 he suffered a debilitating stroke; he died on August 31, 1911, in Omena, Leelanau County, Michigan. He is buried in Jacksonville East Cemetery in Jacksonville, a town in Morgan County, Illinois.

==Grierson in media==
Colonel Grierson is a prominent figure in Turner Network Television&#x27;s documentary, &quot;Buffalo Soldiers&quot;.

The part of Colonel Marlowe, played by John Wayne in the movie &quot;The Horse Soldiers&quot;, is loosely based on Grierson, from a book by Harold Sinclair.

<text>Bumbershoot is an annual international music and arts festival held in Seattle, Washington. One of North America&#x27;s largest such festivals, it takes place every Labor Day weekend (leading up to and including the first Monday of September) at the 74-acre (299,000 m2) Seattle Center, which was built for the 1962 World&#x27;s Fair. Seattle Center includes both indoor theaters and outdoor stages.

==History==

=== The early years ===
Bumbershoot began as a city-funded ($25,000 budget) arts and music festival called &quot;Mayor&#x27;s Arts Festival&quot;, also known as &quot;Festival &#x27;71&quot;, held at Seattle Center on August 13–15, 1971. This event had a total attendance of 125,000 visitors. Amidst the local economic depression triggered by the near collapse of Boeing, the festival attempted to revive local spirits, and was the largest event held in Seattle Center since the 1962 World&#x27;s Fair. Talk radio host Irving Clark Jr. chaired the fair committee, and avant-garde impresario Anne Focke used one-fifth of the budget for light shows (which incorporated lasers, still something of a novelty at that time), computer graphics, enormous inflatable soft sculptures by the Land Truth Company, and an electronic jam session. Other events included dance, theater, folk music, arts and crafts, art cars, body painting, a Miss Hot Pants Contest, amateur motorcycle races, and one out-of-town performer: country singer Sheb Wooley.

In 1972, &quot;Festival &#x27;72&quot;, held on July 21–23, took in 175,000 guests. In 1973 the festival adopted the present name &quot;Bumbershoot&quot;, grew to five days, and pulled in 200,000 visitors. National acts included Cal Tjader, Joe Venuti, and John Handy. In 1974 it grew again, to 10 days and 325,000 visitors. The festival opened with a &quot;Renaissance Processional&quot; for the kilometer or so from downtown to the center; Mayor Wes Uhlman and most of the city council participated that year, in roles ranging from clowning to reading children&#x27;s stories aloud to, in the mayor&#x27;s case, running the Lost Child Center. Another prominent Bumbershoot event from this era was the Bumbernationals Artists&#x27; Soapbox Derby, which continued into the early 1980s. 1975&#x27;s 11-day festival was produced by Parks Department employee John Chambless, a former University of Washington professor of history and philosophy who had produced the 1968 Sky River Rock Festival, a Pacific Northwest hippie-era festival.

===The late-1970s retreat===
With declining government grant support, Bumbershoot tried to keep afloat on donations and sales of posters, buttons, and T-shirts, but poor weather hurt attendance some years and left the free Festival scrambling for more financially stable options. First, the festival retrenched on the number of days and on bringing in national talent. According to John Chambless, about 25 percent of the 1975 budget went to out-of-town talent; the 1976 festival was nearly 100 percent local and was cut to two weekends; in 1977, it was further cut to just Labor Day weekend; as it happened, in both 1977 and 1978, Labor Day weekend was rainy.

===One Reel takes over===
In 1980 the city brought in Northwest non-profit organization One Reel to produce the event; they have been running it ever since. A mid-1980s attempt by Seattle Center itself to wrest back control was overruled by the City Council.

In the early 1980s, One Reel worked with Red Sky Poetry Theatre (RSPT) which ran many of the Literary Arts aspects of Bumbershoot for several years. RSPT would hold competitions to determine the local talent that would read on the performance stage. This was a precursor to the Poetry slam.

According to its website, One Reel originated as a traveling show, &quot;The One Reel Vaudeville Show&quot; in 1972 and was founded by former One Reel president and CEO Norman Langill. One Reel has also operated Teatro ZinZanni, the &quot;Summer Nights&quot; concert series and &quot;Family 4th at Lake Union&quot; events.

As the One Reel Vaudeville Show, the organization had been involved in the event since its second year, 1972, but with their new role as festival producer came big change. Once again, the festival featured headlining national and international talent (acts that year included Emmylou Harris, Chuck Berry, the Art Ensemble of Chicago, Etta James, Clifton Chenier, Eugene Fodor and Martin Mull), but added an admission charge.Initially that admission charge was US$2.50 a day (although there was a &quot;Free Friday&quot;, a tradition lasted for over a decade); as of 2007, it had grown to US$40 a day, and to $62 by 2013. Substantial new premium ticket offerings have also been introduced, including Gold and Platinum passes, full-event tickets providing guaranteed inclusive admission to limited-seating events and reserved VIP seating at certain live music venues.

The new formula featured world-class acts while continuing to ground the festival on a bedrock of Pacific Northwest talent. Record numbers of art and music lovers flocked to the multiple indoor and outdoor stages, galleries, and food, art and craft vendors. Artists such as The Eurythmics, James Brown, Spinal Tap and Tina Turner shared the turf with art oddities like the gigantic flying pencil, the Bumbernationals soapbox derby and robotic art. Although initially resistant to hip hop, in the mid-&#x27;90s Bumbershoot introduced some of the first large-scale hip hop shows ever held in Seattle, a tradition that&#x27;s still very much alive. From the ashes of the grunge rock scene came a new brand of Seattle sound; influential alternative rock bands such as Sleater Kinney, Modest Mouse, Death Cab for Cutie and Grand Archives have played Bumbershoot. In the new millennium, international artists have included groups such as Baba Maal, The Grand Kabuki Theatre of Japan, and an Ethiopian youth circus. The One Reel Film Festival, held within Bumbershoot, celebrates American independent film shorts. Bumbershoot incorporated new arts forms such as poetry slams and break dancing as well as older arts such as circus, contortion, aerial, and street theater. 

One Reel signed a three-year programming and promotional agreement in 2008 with AEG Live, one of the largest for-profit international promoters of rock concerts and large events. The deal allowed AEG to assist One Reel with booking musical acts and sponsorship but ultimately proved unfruitful for both parties.

As the region&#x27;s largest single showcase for regional talent, Bumbershoot became a cultural tastemaker. The festival—which has become Seattle&#x27;s longest-lived music and arts festival—paved the way for other Seattle-area outdoor events, festivals, and happenings. Many of these, such as the Northwest Folklife Festival that premiered at Seattle Center on Memorial Day weekend nine months after the first Bumbershoot, have become established traditions in their own right.

===AEG Presents takes over===
After several years of financial trouble, AEG Live took over as lead promoter in 2015, with One Reel providing supporting programming. AEG had previously taken on a secondary production role from 2007 to 2009 during which they experienced &quot;significant losses due to rain and the Great Recession of 2009&quot;.

Contrary to their time as secondary producers AEG would now have majority control as One Reel was no longer a &quot;financially healthy company&quot;. Because of this struggle Chris Porter, &quot;Bumbershoot&#x27;s music booker of nearly two decades&quot;, said that &quot;this time [One Reel] had to bow down to the way AEG wanted to do things in order to get the deal done&quot;. In other words, AEG kept the festival alive but would make the major decisions it didn&#x27;t have the authority to do in the past.

Locals were worried that AEG stepping in would change the deep cultural significance the festival served for the city highlighting local creatives. Having experienced a similar situation in New Orleans, a Seattle local interviewed by The Seattle Times said that as soon as AEG began to produce JazzFest that the significance of the city&#x27;s history and its culture fell to the background. Local artists were replaced by money making headliners.

Though there were concerns, the truth of the matter was that the local AEG team believed in Bumbershoot and Seattle. AEG &quot;took over in 2015 after nearly a million dollars of debt threatened the festivals future&quot;. A source told Crosscut magazine that &quot;local AEG staff thought the festival should be saved, and not because it represented a potential chance to make money&quot;.

After signing the contact with AEG, One Reel&#x27;s founder Norm Langill met with Chad Queirolo and Rob Thomas of AEG&#x27;s Pacific Northwest chapter. Langill reported to the Seattle Times that he had full faith in Queirolo and Thomas to take over Bumbershoot&#x27;s operations.

=== AEG steps down ===
In November 2019, AEG Live announced that they decided not to continue producing Bumbershoot when their contract was up for renewal. AEG&#x27;s Rob Thomas said the decision was &quot;heartbreaking&quot; as they initially invested in saving the music festival because they believed in it. This decision came after years of problems. Since Seattle maintains ownership of Bumbershoot, related problems arise such as unions, city overtime pay and police fees. The Seattle Center has also been under construction for the last several years which restricts the area available for festival use, most significantly, KeyArena. Industry experts have noted that &quot;it was likely that AEG lost upwards of a million dollars each year it promoted Bumbershoot&quot;.

In many festival-hosting cities, government funding – such as grants – have been organized as to continue the festival and maintain profits from tourism and tax gains. Bumbershoot has not experienced such economic profitability, and thus AEG chose to step down.

In the fall of 2019 it was announced that AEG Live &quot;declined to renew its option to produce Bumbershoot in 2020&quot; following its five-year run as lead producer. The 2020 and 2021 editions were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2022 edition was cancelled to allow new operator New Rising Sun to revamp the festival in time for the golden anniversary in 2023.

=== Third Stone and New Rising Sun===
In 2023, Third Stone and New Rising Sun announced that they would be re-launching Bumbershoot. New Rising Sun (NRS), a team of concert promoters and visual arts producers, obtained rights to produce Bumbershoot in partnership with Seattle Center. 

In March 2023, it was announced that the musical lineup for Bumbershoot 2023 would include Sleater-Kinney, Brittany Howard, Band of Horses, Zhu, Jawbreaker, AFI, the Descendents and Sunny Day Real Estate, among others.

<doc id="690469" wikidata="Q4165151" url="?curid=690469" title="Dolly grip">
<text>In cinematography, the dolly grip is a dedicated technician trained to operate the camera dolly. This technician places, levels, and moves the dolly track, then pushes and pulls the dolly and usually a camera operator and camera assistant as riders. If the dolly has a moveable vertical axis, such as a hydraulic arm, then the dolly grip also operates the &quot;boom&quot;. If both axes are used simultaneously, this type of dolly shot is known as a compound move.

A dolly grip must work closely with the camera crew to perfect these complex movements (cinematic techniques) during rehearsals. Focusing the lens is critical to capturing a sharp image, so a dolly grip must hit his or her marks in concert with a camera assistant who pulls focus. It is a skill that experience can hone to a point, but the best dolly grips are known for their &quot;touch,&quot; and that makes them highly sought-after.

A dolly grip is also employed when the camera is operated in handheld mode (on the operator&#x27;s shoulders or literally in their hands). While the camera operator is moving with the camera, the dolly grip is responsible for the operator&#x27;s safety, helping the operator to &quot;blindly&quot; negotiate sometimes complicated environments. The dolly grip silently directs the operator (through gentle touches, nudges, pulls and pushes) away from walls and other obstacles that the operator cannot see while concentrating on the image in the camera viewfinder. The same is true when the camera is operated with a Steadicam or similar body-mounted stabilization tool.

Dolly grips may also push a wheeled platform holding the microphone and boom operator.

Crane operators in the film industry are specially trained film crew. They are normally grips.

Some shots require the camera to move. This can be done several ways, one of which is to use a camera crane. There are many types of camera cranes, most being a counterbalanced arm on a pivot, whilst others are hydraulic. Cranes can be used to lift the camera, and often the camera operator and assistant also, quickly into the air. The crane operator sets up and operates the camera crane so that the camera arrives at the right spot. This can be difficult since the camera may be a long distance from the operator.

<doc id="690470" wikidata="Q1086822" url="?curid=690470" title="Supermarine Swift">
<text>The Supermarine Swift is a British single-seat jet fighter aircraft that was operated by the Royal Air Force (RAF). It was developed and manufactured by Supermarine during the 1940s and 1950s. The Swift featured many of the new jet age innovations, such as a swept wing. On 26 September 1953, a Swift F.4 piloted by Commander Mike Lithgow broke the world absolute speed record, reaching a speed of 737.7 mph (1,187 km/h).

After a protracted development period, the Swift entered service as an interceptor aircraft with the RAF in 1954. However, due to a spate of accidents incurred by the type, the Swift was grounded for a time, and had a relatively brief service life. The problems with the Swift led to a public scandal surrounding the development and performance of the aircraft, harming the reputations of the British government, the RAF, and the British aircraft industry.

Ultimately, the less problematic Hawker Hunter assumed much of the role intended for the Swift and only half as many Swifts were manufactured as had once been intended. A later photo reconnaissance variant of the Swift had resolved some of the teething problems, but that proved to be too late for it to regain favour. An advanced derivative of the Swift that was to be capable of transonic speeds, the Supermarine 545, was also under development during the early 1950s. However, it was cancelled in 1955, principally due to the poor performance of the Swift.

==Design and development==
===Background===
During 1945, the Second World War ended and a new Labour government, headed by Clement Attlee, came to power in Britain. The incoming government&#x27;s initial stance on defence was that no major conflict would occur for at least a decade, and so there would be no need to develop or to procure any new aircraft until 1957. In accordance with that policy, aside from a small number of exceptions such as what would become the Hawker Sea Hawk for the Royal Navy, the majority of Specifications issued by the Air Ministry for fighter-sized aircraft during the late 1940s were restricted to research purposes. 

In part, the Swift had its origins in the experimental fighter prototypes that had been developed. Specifically, a number of Supermarine-built prototypes had been ordered under Specification E.41/46, which had sought the production of an experimental fighter aircraft with a swept wing. The first of these was the &quot;Type 510&quot;, which was substantially based on the straight-wing Supermarine Attacker, which was procured for the Fleet Air Arm. The principal difference from the Attacker was that it had a swept wing. During 1948 the Type 510 made its maiden flight, a year after the first navalised prototype Attacker had flown, making it the first British aircraft to fly with both swept wings and a swept tailplane. In trials for the Fleet Air Arm, the Type 510 was also the first swept-wing aircraft to take off from and land on an aircraft carrier.

During the late 1940s, in the face of the emerging Cold War, the RAF came to recognise that it would urgently require the development and procurement of fighters equipped with features such as swept wings. That need was felt to be so pressing that it was willing to accept interim fighter aircraft while more capable fighters were being developed. In 1950, with the outbreak of the Korean War, Britain&#x27;s involvement in that conflict led to a flurry of orders being placed. In particular, the RAF felt that a pair of proposed fighter aircraft from Hawker Aircraft and Supermarine were of great importance and, in the same year, ordered the proposed fighters &quot;off the drawing board&quot;. The Supermarine design was designated as the &quot;Type 541&quot;, and was essentially an advanced development of the earlier Type 510 experimental aircraft.

The initial order placed in 1950 for 100 aircraft was intended to serve as an insurance policy in the event that Hawker failed to produce a viable aircraft. . In early 1946, the Type 541 order was increased to 150 aircraft, the Air Ministry hoping that it would enter service before the rival Hunter. However, the development of both types was protracted. 

The Type 541 replaced its predecessors&#x27; Rolls-Royce Nene centrifugal flow turbojet engine with the axial-flow Rolls-Royce AJ.65 turbojet, which became the Avon series. The fuselage, which had been given a cross section suitable for the Nene engine, was not redesigned for the narrower AJ.65 and Avon engines, and retained a somewhat portly appearance. The aircraft also had with a tricycle undercarriage. Two of Type 541 prototypes were built. The first made its maiden flight on 01 August 1951 and the second during the following year.

===Into production===
Production of the Swift had been declared to be a &quot;super-priority&quot; item under a policy created by Sir Winston Churchill, who had regained the position of Britain&#x27;s prime minister in 1951, as a means of increasing projects considered to be of vital military importance. Volume manufacturing commenced in advance of the implementation of modifications based on the results of flight experiences with the prototypes: &quot;too much had been asked for in too little time and production aircraft were coming the production line before a major redesign could be accomplished&quot;.

The first production variant was a fighter designated the &quot;Swift F Mk 1&quot;, of which 18 were eventually built. It was powered by a single 7,500 lbf (33.4 kN)-thrust Avon 109 engine and was armed with two 30 mm ADEN cannons. On 25 August 1952, the first flight of a production standard Swift F 1 took place. Peter Thorne, who had been appointed as the senior RAF test pilot for the incoming Swift in 1954, came to doubt the aircraft&#x27;s suitability. Thorne and several other pilots noted the Swift had unusual handling qualities, as well as a troublesome engine.

The second variant was the &quot;Swift F Mk 2&quot;, of which 16 were built. It was practically the same as the F 1, except for being fitted with two extra ADENs and the leading edge of the wing was altered from straight to a compound sweep. However, the addition of the cannon caused problems, because the modifications required to house the increased ammunition load led to dangerous handling characteristics, and it was also clear that more thrust was required from its engine. Numerous further modifications were required to resolve the problems.

The third Swift variant was the &quot;F Mk 3&quot;, of which 25 were built, powered by an Avon 114 engine with reheat. It was never put into operational service with the Royal Air Force and was used as an instructional airframe. The next variant was the &quot;F Mk.4&quot;, which included a variable incidence tailplane, intended to correct the handling problems that the Swift suffered from. It did fix the problem, but it was found that reheat could not be ignited at high altitude, adding to the Swift&#x27;s list of problems.

The next in the line, the &quot;FR Mk 5&quot;, had a longer nose to accommodate a number of cameras to allow a reconnaissance role, as well as other modifications to its structure. The FR 5 also reverted to the F 1&#x27;s twin ADEN cannon armament. It first flew in 1955 and entered service the following year, performing reconnaissance mainly at low level, making the reheat problem at high altitude irrelevant.

Two further variants were designed. The &quot;PR Mk 6&quot; was an unarmed photo reconnaissance plane. However, its use was short-lived, due to the ever-present reheat problems. The last variant was the &quot;F Mk 7&quot;, which was the first Swift model to be fitted with guided missiles, the Fairey Fireflash air-to-air missile, and was powered by a new model of the Avon. Only fourteen F 7 aircraft were built and none ever entered service with the RAF, being relegated – along with its prototype missiles – to conducting guided-missile trials.

===Proposed derivative===

In 1953, as a response to growing RAF interest in developing transonic aircraft to serve as a stopgap while the next generation of supersonic fighters were being developed, both Supermarine and Hawker proposed derivatives of their respective Swift and Hunter aircraft. By that time, the shortcomings of the Swift were not yet apparent, which perhaps had allowed Supermarine to gain the RAF&#x27;s favour for its proposal, designated as the Type 545, over the rival Hawker P.1083. The Type 545 had been drawn up to conform with the requirements given by Specification F.105D. It was to have been capable of attaining Mach 1.3. powered by an Avon engine, promising superior performance to that of the P.1083. The Type 545 bore a resemblance to the Swift, although it was a complete redesign, having an area-ruled fuselage and wing changes. In 1955, work on the project was cancelled, in part due to the considerable difficulties experienced with the Swift.

==Operational history==

In February 1954, the Swift F 1 entered service with the RAF, No. 56 Squadron becoming the first RAF squadron to operate the type. With its introduction, the Swift became the RAF&#x27;s first swept-wing aircraft. The Swift F 2 entered service that same month. Wood refers to the type&#x27;s introduction as having been &quot;panicked&quot;, and that the adoption soon proved to be an &quot;abysmal failure&quot;. Tragedy struck very early in the career of the Swift: there were a number of accidents that involved the F 1 and F 2, one of them being fatal. In August 1954, it was decided that the Swift F 1 would be grounded, and the Swift F 2, which had effectively replaced the F 1 that same month, was also soon grounded as well, for similar reasons.

The Swift F 3 and F 4 fighters were noted to have improved performance over their predecessors. The F 4 was the last variant that the RAF would accept in an interceptor role. All fighter variants of the Swift were withdrawn from service by the RAF after a short time in service, to be replaced by the more capable Hawker Hunter. While subject to its own problems, the Hunter had quickly proved to be a successful fighter aircraft. By autumn 1954, the problems with the Swift had become public knowledge, and reports of the pending cancellation of the Swift appeared in the national press. In Parliament, Under-Secretary of State for Air Sir George Ward said of the aircraft: &quot;Aerodynamic difficulties have been encountered, and it is not possible to say with certainty if they can be overcome in the version under development&quot;.

In early February 1955, it was rumoured that the Swift had failed its final evaluation by the RAF Central Fighter Establishment, and that the type was likely to be restricted to aerial reconnaissance or to ground attack roles. On 2 March 1955, Minister of Supply Selwyn Lloyd acknowledged that development of the Swift had cost £20 million prior to the scrapping of the fighter variants. According to Wood, the Swift had become a national scandal by early 1955, which not only tarnished the aircraft, but also the RAF and the British aircraft industry, with the public and the government generally becoming more averse to other aircraft projects.

The FR.5 was the last Swift variant to enter service with the RAF and was eventually replaced by the Hunter FR.10, with the FR.5 leaving RAF service entirely in 1961. The Swift FR. 5 had been deemed suitable for its role and was based with two squadrons that were assigned to RAF Germany. The Swift never saw combat action with the RAF, but it did break a number of speed records in its time. In Libya, on 26 September 1953, an F.4 (WK198) piloted by Commander Mike Lithgow broke the world absolute speed record, reaching a speed of 737.7 mph (1,187 km/h), though it was broken just eight days later by the Douglas Skyray, a United States Navy (USN) fighter. The Swift has the distinction of being the last British production aircraft to hold the record (the Fairey Delta 2 was experimental). Fewer than two hundred Swifts were built from an order of 497. A number of Swift airframes were taken to Australia for Operation Buffalo in 1956, being placed at various distances from a detonating atomic bomb.

Its last variant had resolved many of the problems that had plagued earlier Swifts but the programme was not continued. The Hunter, performing satisfactorily in the same roles, removed any requirement to persist with the Swift.

<text>Lady Anne Moulson (sometimes Ann and/or Mowlson), born Anne Radcliffe (sometimes Radclyffe) (1576–1661), was an early benefactor of the fledgling colonial Harvard College. She is remembered today in the name of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.

Ann Radcliffe was the daughter of Anthony Radcliffe, Merchant Taylor of London and sheriff in 1586, who married Elizabeth Bright in 1558. In 1600 Anne married Thomas Moulson, an alderman and member of the Grocers&#x27; Company who served as Lord Mayor of London in 1634. They lived in the parish of St Christopher le Stocks.They owned and operated an inn in London. They had two children but both died young. Thomas Moulson died in 1638, leaving the customary half of his estate to his widow Anne. Ann had a head for business and managed her own business for the next twenty-three years. In addition to the inn, she loaned money and invested in import ventures. She was also active in the Puritan cause, contributing toward hiring a Puritan lecturer in her parish and giving generously to other charities. In 1643 she donated some of her money to found the first endowed scholarship at Harvard. When in 1894 the women&#x27;s annex to the university was chartered as a full college, it was given the name of Harvard&#x27;s first female benefactor.

She died in October 1661. In her will she left bequests to the descendants of her sister Dorothy, who married William Gerard (died 1609) and of her brother Edward Radcliffe.

<text>Apalit, officially the Municipality of Apalit (; ), is a municipality in the province of Pampanga, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 117,160 people.

The town is famous for its Apung Iru Fluvial Procession, which is listed as one of the most significant water-based intangible cultural heritage of the Philippines where the festival happens every &quot;June 28th–30th&quot;; and for its blacksmithing.

==Etymology==
The town got its name after a big sturdy tree with the scientific name &quot;Pterocarpus indicus&quot; also known as &quot;Narra&quot;, known by Kapampangan as &quot;Apalit&quot;.

==History==
Apalit received official recognition as a separate town in 1582, while Gonzalo Ronquillo de Penalosa was the country&#x27;s governor-general at the time. Apalit&#x27;s town was mostly made up of four encomiendas: Apali (Pale), La Castilla, Cabambangan, and Capalangan. San Juan Nepomuceno was the new name given to the enconmienda &quot;La Castilla&quot; once it had been transformed into a town proper (Poblacion).

After severing ties with the Parish of Calumpit, The Apalit Parish of Saint Peter was established in 1597.

Capitan del Pueblo Don Pedro Armayan-Espiritu y Macam created the customary fluvial parade of Saint Peter on June 28, 1844, commonly known as &quot;Libad ng Apung Iru,&quot; which is still observed today in Apalit during its town festival.

It is thought that the son of a specific Gatbonton named Pangpalung, who was once known as Macapagal, built Barrio Capalangan, which takes its name from the Kapampangan word &quot;Palang&quot; meaning machete or bolo, which the barangay takes pride of.

This Barrio was the home of Panday Pira, the first well-known Filipino maker of cannons, and got its name from the Kapampangan word &quot;Palang,&quot; which means Bolo or Machete. It is said to have been founded by the son of a particular Gatbonton named Pangpalung, who in his youth also went by the name &quot;Macapagal.&quot; After the Spanish conquest of Manila, he worked under Adelantado and Governor General Miguel Lopez de Legaspi, producing &quot;Lantakas&quot; cannons for Rajah Soliman&#x27;s army.

During the reign of Capitan del Pueblo Don Joaquin Arnedo de la Cruz y Tanjutco and his heiress wife, Dona Maria de la Paz Sioco y Carlos, viuda de Tanjutco, Puerto Sulipan was once regarded as a haven for big businesses, politics, and &quot;high society&quot; in the Philippines from the 1850s until the 1910s.

==Geography==
Apalit is surrounded by Macabebe, Masantol, Minalin and San Simon in Pampanga, and Calumpit, Pulilan, and Baliuag in Bulacan.

It is from Manila, from the provincial capital, San Fernando, and from Angeles.

===Barangays===
Apalit is politically subdivided into 12 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.

==Demographics==
In the 2020 census, the population of Apalit, was 117,160 people, with a density of .

===Religion===
Most inhabitants of Apalit are Christian, with a majority professing Catholicism, due to Spanish colonialism and imperialism from the 15th to 19th centuries. Other prominent Christian groups include Members Church of God International, Iglesia ni Cristo, and Muslims.

====Catholicism====


Apalit was first established as one of the visitas (mission chapel) under the administration of Convento de Calumpit.
In 1597, the Augustinian chapter accepted Apalit as House of Order under the advocacy of San Pedro Apostol where Fray Pedro de Vergara OSA as its first parish priest In conjunction with the annual town fiesta, the &quot;Libad&quot; was established by the &quot;Capitan del Pueblo&quot;, &quot;Don&quot; Pedro Armayan-Espíritu y Macam, on June 28, 1844.Libad fluvial procession also reaching Calumpit even today to signify the old relationship of Apalit to its mother town Calumpit where San Juan Bautista is the patron of the Town.

The first church and &quot;convento&quot; was constructed under the tenure of Fray Juan Cabello as parish priest from 1641 to 1645. Fray Simón de Alarcia built another church made of concrete and tile in 1854–1860, but it was destroyed by a strong earthquake in 1863. The present neo-classical church was built under Fray Antonio Redondo, who was assigned to Apalit from 1873 to 1886.

Father Gallende wrote in &quot;La Iglesia de Apalit&quot;:

It was officially inaugurated with solemn ceremonies held successively during the town fiesta from 28 to 30 June of the same year. The chronicler remarks that when there was no more sand or bricks, Fr. Redondo would ask the &quot;fiscal&quot; (sacristan) to go around town pealing the bells. Preceded by the town bands, he would lead the way towards the riverside with an &quot;azafate&quot; (a basket or hamper) on his head. Unquestioning, the whole town would follow him, and in less than two hours, the masons would have enough sand for two months. &quot;The whole town of Apalit helped either with monetary donations, personal service, or with their good wishes.&quot; The church measures 59 meters long and 14 meters wide. The painting was done by a native of Apalit, an industrious pupil of Alberoni. The church possesses the qualities of good construction: &quot;solidity, capacity, light and artistic beauty.&quot;

The towers were completed under the guidance of Rev Toríbio Fanjul in 1896. In 1989, a major church renovation was initiated by Monsignor Rústico G. Cuevas.

=====Feast of Saint Peter=====
The &quot;Libad&quot;, a fluvial procession in honour of the town&#x27;s patron saint Peter the Apostle (known locally &quot;Apung Iru&quot;), is annually from 28 to 30 June. The event, where a centuries-old ivory image of the apostle is paraded along the Pampanga River, is one of the more famous religious processions in Pampanga.

=====History of the Image of Apung Iru=====

The life-sized, seated image of &quot;Apung Iru&quot; is an heirloom of the Armayan-Espíritu y Macam clan of &quot;Sitio Alauli&quot;, San Vicente, Apalit. The image, with its ivory face and hands, dates from the last quarter of the 1700s. Family tradition has it that &quot;Don&quot; Pedro Armayan-Espíritu y Macam (d. 1904)–or his parents &quot;Don&quot; Calixto Armayan-Espíritu and &quot;Doña&quot; María Macam, acquired the image from an aunt, &quot;Doña&quot; Máxima Santos–in exchange for a considerable parcel of agricultural land in Apalit. During the Spanish colonial era, Spanish friars shrewdly assigned the ownership of the town&#x27;s patron saint to wealthy families, so that the former could be spared the expenses of its upkeep and annual &quot;fiesta&quot;. The first &quot;Libad&quot; was held in 1844.

Custody of the image of &quot;Apung Iru&quot; has passed to the direct descendants of &quot;Don&quot; Pedro Armayan-Espíritu y Macam, who married three times: first to &quot;Doña&quot; Dorotea Arnedo; then Máxima Santa Rita; and finally Ysabel Dungo y Nocom. &quot;Don&quot; Pedro originally bequeathed the image to his favourite, his youngest daughter &quot;Doña&quot; Ysidora &quot;Orang&quot; Espíritu y Dungo (later Mrs. Jesús Justo González), but she did not want the responsibility of being the image&#x27;s &quot;camarera&quot; (custodian). She passed it on to her elder, spinster sister &quot;Doña&quot; Aurea &quot;Ondeng&quot; Espíritu y Dungo. After &quot;Doña&quot; Aurea&#x27;s early death, &quot;Don&quot; Pedro&#x27;s eldest daughter &quot;Doña&quot; María &quot;Maruja&quot; Espíritu y Dungo (later Mrs. Macario Arnedo) became the image&#x27;s &quot;camarera&quot;. In 1928, &quot;Doña&quot; María translated the image of &quot;Apung Iru&quot; from the Armayan-Espíritu ancestral home in &quot;Sitio&quot; Alauli in Barangay San Vicente to her house in &quot;Barrio&quot; Capalangan, where it has remained since.

&quot;Doña&quot; María died in 1934, and her second daughter &quot;Doña&quot; Ysabel &quot;Tabing&quot; Arnedo y Espíritu (later Mrs .Fernando Dueñas Reyes) became the image&#x27;s &quot;camarera&quot; until her own death in 1970. &quot;Doña&quot; María&#x27;s third daughter, &quot;Doña&quot; Rosario Lucia &quot;Charing&quot; Arnedo y Espíritu (later Mrs. Augusto Diosdado Sioco González) became &quot;camarera&quot; until her death in May 1977. The youngest daughter, &quot;Doña&quot; Elisa Juana &quot;Ising&quot; Arnedo y Espíritu (later Mrs Fortunato Kabiling Sazon) became the next &quot;camarera&quot; until her death in May 1987. &quot;Doña&quot; Elisa&#x27;s eldest daughter, Dr. Erlinda Crispina &quot;Linda&quot; Arnedo Sazon (later Mrs. Enrique Espíritu Badenhop) succeeded her mother as &quot;camarera&quot; from until her own death in February 2008. Augusto Marcelino &quot;Toto&quot; Reyes González III, &quot;Doña&quot; Rosario&#x27;s grandson from her eldest son, Augusto Beda, is the current &quot;camarero&quot; of &quot;Apung Iru&quot;, following a stipulation that &quot;Doña&quot; Rosario and &quot;Doña&quot; Ysidora made to the family in 1970.

In 1975, &quot;Doña&quot; Ysidora, &quot;Doña&quot; Rosario, and the latter&#x27;s son Brother Andrew Benjamin González, F.S.C., established Saint Peter&#x27;s Mission, Inc. with the stipulation that &quot;Apung Iru&quot; and his feast be maintained by the generations to come.

<text>Fleet Week is a United States Navy, United States Marine Corps, and United States Coast Guard tradition in which active military ships recently deployed in overseas operations dock in a variety of major cities for one week. Once the ships dock, the crews can enter the city and visit its tourist attractions. At certain hours, the public can take a guided tour of the ships. Often, Fleet Week is accompanied by military and air shows such as those provided by the Blue Angels.

==History==
The first Fleet Week was celebrated in San Diego, California, during the 1935 California Pacific International Exposition. The years between World War I and World War II saw an increasing military build-up in both Japan and Germany, while the communist Soviet Union (USSR) was given over to the wave of Stalinist nationalism. Most United States citizens experienced little sense of urgency about foreign developments because of isolationism and concerns with the ongoing economic Great Depression. However, then-U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a former Assistant Secretary of the Navy, was intent on expanding the U.S. Navy in response to world political trends. A major aircraft company was moving to Lindbergh Field, (today more commonly known as San Diego International Airport). In this atmosphere, Fleet Week was born.

At 11 a.m. on May 29, 1935, a color guard of the U.S. Marine Corps led a parade across Cabrillo Bridge to Plaza del Pacifico, where the U.S. flag was raised to open the Exposition officially. At 8 p.m., Roosevelt spoke by telephone and designated two selected orphans to press the buttons turning on the lights which bathed the grounds in color. In his remarks, heard over the loudspeaker system, Roosevelt said: &quot;The decision of the people of San Diego thus to dedicate the California Pacific International Exposition is, I believe, worthy of the courage and confidence with which our people now look to the future. No one can deny that we have passed through troubled years. No one can fail to feel the inspiration of your high purpose. I wish you great success.&quot;

During Fleet Week in June 1935, 114 warships and 400 military planes arrived under command of U.S. Navy Admiral Joseph M. Reeves, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Fleet. It was described as the mightiest fleet ever assembled under the U.S. flag. It included forty-eight battleships, cruisers and aircraft carriers, with more than 3,000 commissioned officers and 55,000 enlisted men. The U.S. Navy men visited the Exposition and, in turn, thousands of San Diegans and other fairgoers were guests on the various ships.

==San Francisco==

For years it was common for several U.S. Navy ships to dock in San Francisco, California for a similar series of events. One or more fleet ships were docked as a &quot;visit ship&quot; for tourists to board, and the local community took in sailors for home visits; drinks were often discounted to uniformed sailors at area bars and restaurants. The highlight of the San Francisco Fleet Week is the Air Show on San Francisco Bay with the Blue Angels as the center of attention. The Air Show also features stunt planes and parachute team and Coast Guard demonstrations. Another highlight of the Fleet Week SF is a parade of ships under the Golden Gate Bridge.

The revived name of Fleet Week was applied to an expanded and more heavily publicized fleet visit in 1981, in conjunction with Columbus Day Weekend celebrations during the second week of October. Since then, the event has been held each year during the Columbus Day Weekend without a break and celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2005. The event is estimated to attract over one million people who watch the air show along the San Francisco Bay waterfront stretching from the Ferry Building to the Golden Gate Bridge. The event was canceled for 2013 due to federal budgetary issues, but was revived in 2014, and continues to be an annual event.

<text>The John C. Stennis Space Center (SSC) is a NASA rocket testing facility in Hancock County, Mississippi, United States, on the banks of the Pearl River at the Mississippi–Louisiana border. , it is NASA&#x27;s largest rocket engine test facility. There are over 50 local, state, national, international, private, and public companies and agencies using SSC for their rocket testing facilities.

== History ==
The initial requirements for NASA&#x27;s proposed rocket testing facility required the site to be located between the rockets&#x27; manufacturing facility at Michoud Assembly Facility in eastern New Orleans, Louisiana, and the launch facility at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Also, the site required barge access as the rocket stages to be tested for Apollo were too large for overland transport. Additionally, the Apollo motors were too loud to be tested at Marshall Space Flight Center&#x27;s existing test stands near Huntsville, Alabama. A more isolated site was needed.

After an exhaustive site selection process that included reviews of other coastal locations including Eglin Air Force Base in Florida plus islands in both the Caribbean and the Pacific, NASA announced formation of the Mississippi Test Facility (now known as Stennis Space Center) on Oct. 25, 1961, for testing engines for the Apollo Program. A high-terrace area bordering the East Pearl River in Hancock County, Miss., was selected for its location. NASA entrusted the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers with the difficult task to procure each land parcel either by directly purchasing the land or through acquisition of a perpetual easement.

The selected area was thinly populated and met all other requirements; however before construction began, five small communities (Gainesville, Logtown, Napoleon, Santa Rosa, and Westonia), plus the northern portion of a sixth (Pearlington), and a combined population of 700 families had to be completely relocated off the facility. The effort acquired more than 3,200 parcels of privately owned land – 786 residences, 16 churches, 19 stores, three schools and a wide assortment of commercial buildings, including nightclubs and community centers. Remnants of the communities, including city streets and a one-room school house, still exist within the facility.

The site was selected on October 25, 1961, on the Mississippi Test Facility or Pearl River Site. On December 18, 1961, NASA officially designated the facility as NASA Mississippi Test Operations. The test area (officially known as the Fee Area) is surrounded by a 125,000 acre (506 km2) acoustical buffer zone. The facility&#x27;s large concrete and metal rocket propulsion test stands were originally used to test-fire the first and second stages of the Saturn V rockets. The facility was renamed again to Mississippi Test Facility on July 1, 1965, became a part of the Marshall Space Flight Center.

Starting in 1971, all Space Shuttle Main Engines were flight-certified at Stennis. On June 14, 1974, the site was renamed National Space Technology Laboratories, a name that continued until May 20, 1988, when it was renamed for Mississippi senator and space program supporter John C. Stennis.

With the end of the Apollo and Shuttle programs, use of the base decreased, with economic impact to the surrounding communities. Over the years, other government organizations and commercial entities have moved to and left from the facility, in the balance providing a major economic benefit to the communities.

== Rocket propulsion test complex ==

The Rocket Propulsion Test Complex is a rocket testing complex which was built in 1965 as a component of the John C. Stennis Space Center. The Rocket Propulsion Test Complex played an important role in the development of the Saturn V rocket. The A-1, A-2 and B-1/B-2 test stands were declared a National Historic Landmark in 1985.
The NASA Engineering &amp; Science Directorate (ESD) at SSC operates and maintains SSC&#x27;s rocket test stands.
== A-1/A-2 Test stand ==
The smaller two of the original three test stands at Stennis Space Center, the A-1 and A-2 stands were built to test and flight-certify the second stage of the Saturn V, the S-II (pronounced &quot;ess two&quot;), the launch vehicle for the Apollo program. The two stands are similar steel and concrete structures are roughly tall, and capable of withstanding thrust loads of more than 1 million pounds and temperature of up to . Each test stand can provide Liquid Hydrogen (LH2) and liquid oxygen (LOX) in addition to support fluids, gaseous helium (GHe), gaseous hydrogen (GH2) and gaseous nitrogen (GN2) as purge or pressurizing gasses.

=== 1960s ===

Construction began in 1963 and was finished in 1966. The A Test Complex also includes a Test Control Center, observation bunkers, and various technical and support systems.

On 23 April 1966 workmen at the A-2 test stand successfully captive-fired for 15 seconds the S-II-T, Structural and Dynamic Test Vehicle for the Saturn V second stage, in an all-systems test. This was the first test of a flight-weight S-II stage. The stage, largest and most powerful liquid oxygen-liquid hydrogen stage known, developed one million pounds of thrust from its five Rocketdyne J-2 engines. This test also marked the first operational use of the A-2 stand.

The first full-duration firing of the S-II flight stage occurred 20 May 1966 when S-II-T test-fired on the A-2 test stand for 354.5 seconds. LOX cutoff sensors initiated cutoff automatically. The firing passed all major test objectives with the exception of the propellant utilization system. This was the fourth static firing of the S-II-T. The stage developed one million pounds of thrust from its five hydrogen-oxygen-powered J-2 engines.

==== S-II-T rupture ====

A static test version of the Saturn V second stage S-II-T ruptured during pressure tests at SSC on 28 May 1966, and five North American Aviation technicians monitoring the test received minor injuries. The accident occurred when the hydrogen fuel tank failed under pressure. S-II-T, which had five hydrogen-oxygen J-2 engines capable of generating one million pounds of thrust, had been tested May 25 in ground firing but stopped firing after 195 seconds when a hydrogen link leak caused automatic cutoff. At time of the explosion, technicians were trying to determine cause for the hydrogen leak. No hydrogen was in the tank when the explosion occurred. Under the direction of MSFC, a Board of Inquiry headed by Dr. Kurt H. Debus, Director of Kennedy Space Center, convened on the night of May 28. Immediate investigation revealed that the second shift crew, not knowing that the liquid hydrogen pressure sensors and switches had been disconnected, had attempted to pressurize the tank. Believing that a liquid hydrogen vent valve was leaking, the technicians closed the facility by blocking valves. This had caused the vehicle tank to become over-pressurized and burst. On 30 May 1966 the board released its findings after two days of inquiry. The fuel tank of the S-II stage had been pressurized beyond design limits. There was a need for tighter controls over MTF test procedure. Following the destruction of S-II-T, NASA extended the S-II battleship program until July 1967.

S-II-1, the first flight S-II stage scheduled for static firing at MTF, left Seal Beach on July 31, 1966.

The first flight model (S-II-1) of the Saturn V vehicle&#x27;s second stage arrived August 13, 1966 at MTF completing its 4,000-mile voyage from Seal Beach. Workmen immediately moved the stage into the S-II stage service and checkout building for inspection and preparation for static firing.

On December 1, 1966, North American Aviation conducted a successful 384-second captive firing of five J-2 engines, the first flight hydrogen-fueled engines, developing a total one million pounds of thrust. During the test, number 2 and 4 engine SLAM arms did not drop, resulting in the successful gimballing of engines 1 and 3 only. The test included the recording of about 800 measurements of the stage&#x27;s performance, including propellant tank temperatures, engine temperatures, propellant flow rates, and vibrations.

On December 30, 1966, MSFC technicians at the MTF test stand conducted a static firing of the first flight version of the Saturn V second stage, S-II-1. This second test firing, like an earlier firing, lasted more than six minutes.

=== 1967 ===

On January 11, 1967, initial post-static checkout of the S-II-1 stage ended at MTF. On January 27, 1967, the S-II-2 stage left Seal Beach, California, to pass through the Panama Canal and on to MTF. After its journey lasting 16 days, the S-II would arrive at MTF for two static tests. The S-II-2 stage arrived on dock at MTF on February 11, 1967. The S-II-2 stage, part of the second Saturn V vehicle (AS-502) scheduled for launch from KSC late in 1967, was scheduled for testing at MTF late in March 1967. On February 17, 1967, the first full-duration test of a cluster of uprated J-2 engines, S-II battleship test No. 041, lasted 360 seconds. On February 25, 1967, workmen completed construction of the S-II A-1 test stand, and the Corps of Engineers accepted beneficial occupancy with exceptions. On March 17, 1967, technicians fired the S-II battleship stage for a mainstage duration of 29 seconds. On March 31, failure of a prevalve to close caused program officials to scrub the first attempt to static fire the S-II-2 stage.

Battleship testing of the S-II battleship test stage equipped with five uprated J-2 engines ended in late March 1967 with a full-duration test of approximately 360 seconds mainstage operation.

=== Summary ===

These two test stands tested and flight-certified S-II stages and J-2 engines until the end of the Apollo program in the early 1970s.

=== 1970s–2000s ===

It was announced in 1971 that the center would be performing tests on the engines for the new Space Shuttle program (called the SSME). The A-1 and A-2 test stands, originally designed to accommodate the physically much larger S-II J-2 engines, were modified to accept the smaller SSME, and testing officially began on May 19, 1975, when the first such engine was tested on the A-1 stand. The center continued to test engines for the duration of the shuttle program, on the A-1 and A-2 stands with the final scheduled test occurred on July 29, 2009, on the A-2 stand.

=== 2010s ===

As the shuttle program is phased out, the A-1 and A-2 test stands are seeing new use testing the next generation of rocket engines, including the J-2X engine designed to power the SLS upper stage, with the first such test occurring on December 18, 2007.

Stennis tested Aerojet Rocketdyne AJ26 rocket engines for Orbital Sciences Corp. of Dulles, Va., which partnered with NASA to provide commercial cargo flights to the International Space Station. Orbital&#x27;s maiden flight to the space station launched from NASA&#x27;s Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia September 18, 2013. Orbital&#x27;s Antares rocket was powered by a pair of AJ26 engines.

The first test of the RS-25 engine for use on the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket was conducted January 9, 2015. Stennis completed testing of all 16 heritage RS-25 engines that will help launch the first four SLS missions as part of NASA&#x27;s Artemis program on April 4, 2019.

=== 2020s ===

The A-1 Test Stand was designated the Fred Haise Test Stand in March 2020, in honor of the Apollo 13 astronaut and Biloxi, Mississippi, native.

The first test of the newly redesigned RS-25 engine was completed December 14, 2022.

== B-1/B-2 Test stand ==

The B-1/B-2 test stand is a dual-position, vertical, static-firing stand supporting a maximum dynamic load of 11M lbf. It was originally built in the 1960s to simultaneously test the five F-1 engines of a complete Saturn-V S1-C first stage from 1967 to 1970.

On October 17, 1966, MSFC shipped its S-IC all-system test booster, S-IC-T, to SSC for use in checkout of a static test stand and for use in static firings. Workmen loaded the huge booster aboard the barge Poseidon for the 1,000-mile river journey. Six days later the S-IC-T reached SSC. All future firings would be accomplished at the B-2 stand.

An all-systems test version of Apollo/Saturn V first stage, S-IC-T, went into the B-2 test stand at the Mississippi Test Facility on December 17, 1966. Stage electrical and mechanical hook-up to the test stand began immediately. Static firing would occur in early 1967 to demonstrate the facility checkout system.

=== 1967 ===

On 13 February 1967 Corps of Engineers personnel completed construction of the S-IC B-2 test stand at MTF.

Following an extensive systems, subsystems, and total integrated systems checkout of the B-2 test stand at MTF on March 3, 1967, workmen successfully fired the S-IC battleship/all-systems stage (S-IC-T) for 15 seconds. This S-IC-T test, the first MTF S-IC firing, proved the total compatibility of stage, mechanical support equipment, and S-IC test facilities.

A second S-IC-T firing lasted for 60 seconds on March 17, 1967. This firing validated the flame-bucket-water-flow pattern of the B-2 test stand and ended the facilities checkout test series at MTF.

Boeing personnel removed the S-IC-T from test stand B-2 on March 24, 1967, following post-static checkout, test stand refurbishment, and facilities modification.

=== Post Apollo ===

During the shuttle era it was modified to test the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME). Stennis now leases the B-1 test position to Pratt &amp; Whitney Rocketdyne for testing of RS-68 engines for the Delta IV launch vehicle. NASA has prepared the B-2 test position to test the core stage of NASA&#x27;s Space Launch System (SLS), which it first did in early 2021. The SLS Core Stage, with four RS-25D rocket engines, was installed on the stand for propellant fill and drain testing and two hot-fire tests.

== A-3 Test stand ==
In August 2007, NASA began construction of the A-3 test stand at SSC. The A-3 stand was to be used for testing J-2X engines under vacuum conditions simulating high altitude operation. A-3 will also be operable as a sea-level test facility. However, because the Constellation Program was cancelled in 2010, the stand is expected to be unused after its completion. The A-3 stand may however, be able to be refurnished to test a new mission when needed. In 2014, journalists writing for Bloomberg News and the Washington Times criticized the continued construction work on the $350 million test stand, and characterized it as a wasteful earmark by Mississippi U.S. senator Roger F. Wicker.

American-New Zealand launch service provider Rocket Lab intends to use the A-3 stand to develop and test their Archimedes reusable rocket engine.

== E Test stand complex ==

In the 1990s, a new test complex named &quot;E&quot; was constructed to test a variety of new small engine and single/multiple components and concepts. The E test stand complex consists of four distinct test stands

=== E1 Test stand ===

==== History ====

In 2012, Blue Origin tested the thrust chamber assembly at the E-1 test cell for its new thrust BE-3 liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen rocket engine. As part of Blue&#x27;s Reusable Booster System (RBS), the engines are designed eventually to launch the biconic-shaped Space Vehicle the company is developing.

On 22 May 2014, an AJ26 rocket engine under test on the Stennis E-1 test stand, for a future Orbital Sciences Antares launch, failed and caused major damage to the E-1 test stand. As of 10 June, neither NASA, Orbital, nor Aerojet Rocketdyne have released any additional information on the extent of the damage, nor time frame when the three test cells in the E-1 test stand will return to operational status. As of early June 2014, the E-1 test stand was non-operational pending the completion of an investigation into a rocket engine failure on the test stand on 22 May 2014.

In June 2015, Aerojet Rocketdyne signed a contract with NASA to upgrade the E-1 test stand so that the &quot;multi-element pre-burner and main injector&quot; of the AR-1 rocket engine could be tested there, with a goal of first flight of the new AR-1 engine after 2019.

==== Description ====
The stand is composed of three individual test &quot;cells&quot;:
:*E1 Cell 1 can handle liquid-propellant and hybrid based test articles up to of thrust in a horizontal position.
:*E1 Cells 2 and 3 are designed to support LOX and LH2 turbopump assemblies for testing with high-pressure propellant feeds.

=== E2 Test stand ===
The E2 test facility at Stennis has multiple test cells that support three separate test stands (Cell 1 and Cell 2), for testing horizontally-mounted engines and for vertically mounted vehicle stages and/or engines. Cell 1 can support engines with up to of thrust while Cell 2 can support vehicle stages with up to of thrust. 
The facility can provide liquid oxygen, liquid nitrogen, liquid hydrogen, liquid methane, rocket-grade kerosene (RP1), , gaseous hydrogen, &quot;hot&quot; gaseous hydrogen, gaseous oxygen and gaseous nitrogen.

E2 Cell 1, originally known as the High Heat Flux Facility (HHFF), was constructed in 1993 to support materials development for the National Aerospace Plane (NASP).

The E2 test stand was modified after 2013 to support liquid methane engine testing, with funds being provided by SpaceX, the Mississippi Development Authority ( using funding from state bond issues), and NASA (up to ). , the SpaceX funding commitment to the methane modification project has not yet been disclosed, as the contract has not yet been finalized and executed. The methane modifications will become a permanent part of the Stennis test infrastructure and will be available to other users of the test facility after the SpaceX facility lease is completed.
, the most recent test completed on the E2 test stand had been a 2012 NASA test of chemical steam generators.

Beginning in 2014, SpaceX conducted component tests of their liquid methane/liquid oxygen Raptor rocket engine on the E2 test stand. This testing was limited to components of the Raptor engine, since the test stand is not large enough to test the full Raptor engine, which is rated to generate more than vacuum thrust.
SpaceX completed a &quot;round of main injector testing in late 2014,&quot; and a &quot;full-power test of the oxygen preburner component&quot; for Raptor by June 2015.

=== E3 Test stand ===
The E3 test stand consists of two test cells for component and pilot scale combustion device testing:
*E3 Cell 1 can support devices up to thrust in a horizontal position. Propellant supports includes LOX or gaseous oxygen/hydrocarbon, gaseous oxygen/gaseous hydrogen and hybrid.
*E3 Cell 2 can support devices up to thrust in a vertical position. Propellent configurations are similar to E3 Cell 1 with the addition of hydrogen peroxide based devices.

A series of tests conducted in the late 1990s eventually led to the commercialization of hybrid rocket motors.
Test firing an American Rocket Company (AMROC) hybrid rocket motor at NASA&#x27;s Stennis Space Center in 1994.

=== E4 Test stand ===
The E4 test stand consists of four 32 foot tall concrete-walled cells and an associated concrete foundation; a 1,344 square foot hardened and conditioned Signal Conditioning Building; a 12,825 square foot high bay with 10 ton bridge crane, shop area with 1 ton bridge crane, and a 7,000 square foot blast hardened Test Control Center; and two 1,400 square foot raised-floor control rooms. The site also includes underground deluge water piping; underground power, data, and control duct banks; and potable water. The E4 hard stand system was designed to accommodate up to 500,000 pounds-force (2,224 kN) engines and powerpack systems testing in a horizontal configuration. The E4 test stand was proposed in the year 2000 to be located near the H1 test stand.

== H-1 Test stand ==
In 2001, the Pentagon&#x27;s Ballistic Missile Defense Organization proposed construction of a $140 million facility at Stennis H-1 test stand to test its proposed Space-Based Laser (SBL) to begin in the first quarter of fiscal year 2002. The facility was to be used to evaluate beam quality, efficiency, and power levels for a prototype megawatt-class hydrogen fluoride laser.

In 2007, British manufacturer Rolls-Royce plc has been operating an outdoor aero-engine test facility built on the old H1 test area. Rolls-Royce constructed the facility due to noise pollution concerns at its UK testing facility at Hucknall Airfield near its headquarters in Derby.

In 2013, a second test stand was opened by Rolls-Royce.

== Tenant facilities ==
In 2005, the center was home to over 30 government agencies and private companies. By far the largest of these were elements of the United States Navy with some 3,500 personnel, which was far larger than the NASA civil servant contingent. Some of the prominent resident agencies include:

The themes of the center&#x27;s interactive exhibits include Mississippi Natural History, NASA, space, planets, stars, weather, Earth science, space travel and exploration. Displays include the Apollo 4 command module, a full-sized International Space Station module, a cutaway model of the Orion spacecraft, and components from a space-flown RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine. Outdoor displays include an F-1 rocket engine, a tsunami buoy, U.S. Navy riverine training boat and the Apollo 19 Saturn V first stage rocket booster (acquired from NASA Michoud Assembly).

The INFINITY Science Center officially opened in April 2012 to replace the old StenniSphere visitors center.

=== StenniSphere ===
The museum and visitor center for the Stennis Space Center was known as StenniSphere. Upon the imminent opening of the new INFINITY Science Center, StenniSphere closed its doors to the public on February 15, 2012. Unlike INFINITY, the StenniSphere building is located within the grounds of the Stennis Space Center. Exhibits focused on the activities of NASA, space, space exploration, science, geography, weather and more. Many of the exhibits from StenniSphere have been moved into the new INFINITY visitor facility.

<text>Josef von Sternberg (; born Jonas Sternberg; May 29, 1894 – December 22, 1969) was an American filmmaker whose career successfully spanned the transition from the silent to the sound era, during which he worked with most of the major Hollywood studios. He is best known for his film collaboration with actress Marlene Dietrich in the 1930s, including the highly regarded Paramount/UFA production &quot;The Blue Angel&quot; (1930).

Sternberg&#x27;s finest works are noteworthy for their striking pictorial compositions, dense décor, chiaroscuro illumination, and relentless camera motion, endowing the scenes with emotional intensity. He is also credited with having initiated the gangster film genre with his silent era movie &quot;Underworld&quot; (1927). Sternberg&#x27;s themes typically offer the spectacle of an individual&#x27;s desperate struggle to maintain their personal integrity as they sacrifice themselves for lust or love.

He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director for &quot;Morocco&quot; (1930) and &quot;Shanghai Express&quot; (1932).

Shortly before his death in 1969, his autobiography, &quot;Fun in a Chinese Laundry&quot;, was published.

== Biography ==
=== Early life and education ===
Josef von Sternberg was born Jonas Sternberg to an impoverished Orthodox Jewish family in Vienna, at that time part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. When Sternberg was three years old, his father Moses Sternberg, a former soldier in the army of Austria-Hungary, moved to the United States to seek work. Sternberg&#x27;s mother, Serafine (&quot;née&quot; Singer), a circus performer as a child joined Moses in America in 1901 with her five children when Sternberg was seven. On his emigration, von Sternberg is quoted as saying, &quot;On our arrival in the New World we were first detained on Ellis Island where the immigration officers inspected us like a herd of cattle.&quot; Jonas attended public school until the family, except Moses, returned to Vienna three years later. Throughout his life, Sternberg carried vivid memories of Vienna and nostalgia for some of his &quot;happiest childhood moments.&quot;

The elder Sternberg insisted upon a rigorous study of the Hebrew language, limiting his son to religious studies on top of his regular schoolwork. Biographer Peter Baxter, citing Sternberg&#x27;s memoirs, reports that &quot;his parents&#x27; relationship was far from happy: his father was a domestic tyrant and his mother eventually fled her home in order to escape his abuse.&quot; Sternberg&#x27;s early struggles, including these &quot;childhood traumas&quot; would inform the &quot;unique subject matter of his films.&quot;

=== Early career ===
In 1908, when Jonas was fourteen, he returned with his mother to Queens, New York, and settled in the United States. He acquired American citizenship in 1908. After a year, he stopped attending Jamaica High School and began working in various occupations, including millinery apprentice, door-to-door trinket salesman and stock clerk at a lace factory. At the Fifth Avenue lace outlet, he became familiar with the ornate textiles with which he would adorn his female stars and embellish his mise-en-scène.

In 1911, when he turned seventeen, the now &quot;Josef&quot; Sternberg, became employed at the World Film Company in Fort Lee, New Jersey. There, he &quot;cleaned, patched and coated motion picture stock&quot; – and served evenings as a movie theatre projectionist. In 1914, when the company was purchased by actor and film producer William A. Brady, Sternberg rose to chief assistant, responsible for &quot;writing [inter]titles and editing films to cover lapses in continuity&quot; for which he received his first official film credits.

When the United States entered World War I in 1917, he joined the U.S. Army and was assigned to the Signal Corps headquartered in Washington, D.C., where he photographed training films for recruits.

Shortly after the war, Sternberg left Brady&#x27;s Fort Lee operation and embarked on a peripatetic existence in America and Europe offering his skills &quot;as cutter, editor, writer and assistant director&quot; to various film studios.

== Assistant director: 1919–1923 ==
Sternberg served his apprenticeship years with early silent filmmakers, including Hugo Ballin, Wallace Worsley, Lawrence C. Windom and Roy William Neill. In 1919, Sternberg worked with director Emile Chautard&#x27;s on &quot;The Mystery of the Yellow Room&quot;, for which he received official screen credit as assistant director. Sternberg honored Chautard in his memoirs, recalling the French director&#x27;s invaluable lessons on photography, film composition and the importance of establishing &quot;the spatial integrity of his images.&quot; This advice led Sternberg to develop his distinctive &quot;framing&quot; of each shot to become &quot;the screen&#x27;s greatest master of pictorial composition.&quot;

Sternberg&#x27;s 1919 debut in filmmaking, though in a subordinate capacity, coincided with the filming and/or release of D. W. Griffith&#x27;s &quot;Broken Blossoms&quot;, Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;Sunnyside&quot;, Erich von Stroheim&#x27;s &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Pass Key&quot;, Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s &quot;Male and Female&quot;, Robert Wiene&#x27;s &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot;, Victor Sjöström&#x27;s &quot;Karin Daughter of Ingmar&quot; and Abel Gance&#x27;s &quot;J&#x27;accuse&quot;.

Sternberg travelled widely in Europe between 1922 and 1924, where he participated in making a number of movies for the short-lived Alliance Film Corporation in London, including &quot;The Bohemian Girl&quot; (1922). When he returned to California in 1924, he began work on his first Hollywood movie as assistant to director Roy William Neill&#x27;s &quot;Vanity&#x27;s Price&quot;, produced by Film Booking Office (FBO). Sternberg&#x27;s aptitude for effective directing was recognized in his handling of the operating room scene, singled out for special mention by &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Mordaunt Hall.

== United Artists – &quot;The Salvation Hunters&quot;: 1924 ==
The 30-year-old Sternberg made his debut as a director with &quot;The Salvation Hunters&quot;, an independent picture produced with actor George K. Arthur.
The picture, filmed on the minuscule budget of $4,800 – &quot;a miracle of organization&quot; – made a tremendous impression on actor-director-producer Charles Chaplin and co-producer Douglas Fairbanks Sr. of United Artists (UA). Influenced by the works of Erich von Stroheim, director of &quot;Greed&quot; (1924), the movie was lauded by cineastes for its &quot;unglamorous realism&quot;, depicting three young drifters who struggle to survive in a dystopian landscape.

Despite its considerable defects, due in part to Sternberg&#x27;s budgetary constraints, the picture was purchased by United Artists for $20,000 and given a brief distribution, but fared poorly at the box-office.

On the strength of this picture alone, actor-producer Mary Pickford of UA engaged Sternberg to write and direct her next feature. His screenplay, entitled &quot;Backwash&quot;, was deemed to be too experimental in concept and technique, and the Pickford-Sternberg project was cancelled.

Sternberg&#x27;s &quot;The Salvation Hunters&quot; is &quot;his most explicitly personal work&quot;, with the exception of his final picture &quot;Anatahan&quot; (1953). His distinctive style is already in evidence, both visually and dramatically: veils and nets filter the view of the actors, and &quot;psychological conflict rather than physical action&quot; has the effect of obscuring the motivations of his characters.

== Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer: 1925 ==

Released from his contract with United Artists, and regarded as a rising talent in Hollywood, Sternberg was sought after by the major movie studios.
Signing an eight-film agreement with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1925, Sternberg entered into &quot;the increasingly rigid studio system&quot; at M-G-M, where films were subordinated to market considerations and judged on profitability. Sternberg would clash with Metro executives over his approach to filmmaking: the picture as a form of art and the director a visual poet. These conflicting priorities would &quot;doom&quot; their association, as Sternberg &quot;had little interest in making a commercial success.&quot;

Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer first assigned Sternberg to adapt author Alden Brooks&#x27; novel &quot;Escape&quot;, retitled &quot;The Exquisite Sinner&quot;. A romance set in post-World War I Brittany, the movie was withheld from release for failing to clearly set forth its narrative, though M-G-M acknowledged its photographic beauty and artistic merit.

Sternberg was next tasked to direct film stars Mae Murray and Roy D&#x27;Arcy in &quot;The Masked Bride&quot;, both of whom had played in Stroheim&#x27;s highly acclaimed &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; (1925). Exasperated with his lack of control over any aspect of the production, Sternberg quit in two weeks – his final gesture turning the camera to the ceiling before walking off the set. Metro arranged a cancellation of his contract in August 1925. Frenchman Robert Florey, Sternberg&#x27;s assistant director, reported that Sternberg&#x27;s Stroheim-like histrionics emerged on the M-G-M sets to the consternation of production managers.

== Chaplin and &quot;A Woman of the Sea&quot;: 1926 ==

When Sternberg returned from a sojourn in Europe following his disappointing tenure at M-G-M in 1925, Charles Chaplin approached him to direct a comeback vehicle for his erstwhile leading lady, Edna Purviance. Purviance had appeared in dozens of Chaplin&#x27;s films, but had not had a serious leading role since the much admired picture &quot;A Woman of Paris&quot; (1923). This would mark the &quot;only occasion that Chaplin entrusted another director with one of his own productions.&quot;

Chaplin had detected a Dickensian quality in Sternberg&#x27;s representation of his characters and mise-en-scène in &quot;The Salvation Hunters&quot; and wished to see the young director expand on these elements in the film. The original title, &quot;The Sea Gull&quot;, was retitled &quot;A Woman of the Sea&quot; to invoke the earlier &quot;A Woman of Paris&quot;.

Chaplin was dismayed by the film Sternberg created with cameraman Paul Ivano, a &quot;highly visual, almost Expressionistic&quot; work, completely lacking in the humanism that he had anticipated. Though Sternberg reshot a number of scenes, Chaplin declined to distribute the picture and the prints were ultimately destroyed.

== Paramount: 1927–1935 ==
The failure of Sternberg&#x27;s promising collaboration with Chaplin was a temporary blow to his professional reputation. In June 1926 he travelled to Berlin at the request of impresario Max Reinhardt to explore an offer to manage stage productions, but discovered he was not suited to the task. Sternberg went to England, where he rendezvoused with Riza Royce, a New York actress originally from Lancaster, Pennsylvania, who had served as an assistant on the ill-fated &quot;A Woman of the Sea&quot;. They wed on July 6, 1927. Sternberg and Royce would have a tempestuous marriage spanning three years. In August 1928, Riza von Sternberg obtained a divorce from her spouse that included charges of mental and physical abuse, in which Sternberg &quot;seems to have acted a husband&#x27;s role on the model his [abusive] father provided.&quot; The pair remarried in 1928, but the relationship continued to deteriorate, ending in a second and final divorce on June 5, 1931.

=== Silent era: 1927–1929 ===
In the summer of 1927, Paramount producer B. P. Schulberg offered, and Sternberg accepted, a position as &quot;technical advisor for lighting and photography.&quot; Sternberg was tasked with salvaging director Frank Lloyd&#x27;s &quot;Children of Divorce&quot;, a movie that the studio executives had written off as &quot;worthless&quot;. Working &quot;three [consecutive] days of 20-hour shifts&quot; Sternberg reconceived and reshot half the picture and presented Paramount with &quot;a critical and box-office success.&quot; Impressed, Paramount arranged for Sternberg to film a major production based on journalist Ben Hecht&#x27;s story about Chicago gangsters: &quot;Underworld&quot;.

This film is arguably regarded as the first &quot;gangster&quot; movie, to the extent that it portrayed a criminal protagonist as tragic hero destined by fate to meet a violent death. In Sternberg&#x27;s hands the &quot;journalistic observations&quot; provided by Hecht&#x27;s narrative are abandoned and substituted with a fantasy gangsterland that sprang &quot;solely from Sternberg&#x27;s imagination.&quot; &quot;Underworld&quot;, &quot;clinical and Spartan&quot; in its cinematic technique made a significant impression on French filmmakers: &quot;Underworld&quot; was surrealist filmmaker Luis Buñuel&#x27;s favorite film.

With &quot;Underworld&quot;, Sternberg demonstrated his &quot;commercial potential&quot; to the studios, delivering an enormous box-office hit and Academy Award winner (for Best Original Story). Paramount provided Sternberg with lavish budgets for his next four films. Some historians point to &quot;Underworld&quot; as the first of Sternberg&#x27;s accommodations to the studio profit system, whereas others note that the film marks the emergence of Sternberg&#x27;s distinctive personal style.

The movies Sternberg created for Paramount over the next two years – &quot;The Last Command&quot; (1928), &quot;The Drag Net&quot; (1928), &quot;The Docks of New York&quot; (1928) and &quot;The Case of Lena Smith&quot; (1929), would mark &quot;the most prolific period&quot; of his career and establish him as one of the greatest filmmakers of the late silent era. Contrary to Paramount&#x27;s expectations, none were very profitable in distribution.

&quot;The Last Command&quot; earned high praise among critics and added luster to Paramount&#x27;s prestige. The film had the added benefit of forging collaborative relations between the director and its Academy Award-winning star Emil Jannings and producer Erich Pommer, both temporarily on loan from Paramount&#x27;s sister studio, UFA in Germany. Before embarking on his next feature, Sternberg, at the studio&#x27;s behest, agreed to &quot;cut down to manageable length&quot; fellow director Erich von Stroheim&#x27;s &quot;The Wedding March&quot;. Sternberg&#x27;s willingness to accept the assignment had the unhappy side effect of &quot;destroying&quot; his relationship with von Stroheim.

&quot;The Drag Net&quot;, a lost film, is believed to be a sequel to &quot;Underworld&quot;. &quot;The Docks of New York&quot;, &quot;today the most popular of Sternberg&#x27;s silent films&quot;, combines both spectacle and psychology in a romance set in sordid and brutal environs.

Of Sternberg&#x27;s nine films he completed in the silent era, only four are known to exist today in any archive. That Sternberg&#x27;s output suffers from &quot;lost film syndrome&quot; makes a comprehensive evaluation of his silent oeuvre impossible. Despite this, Sternberg stands as the great &quot;Romantic artist&quot; of this period in film history.

A particularly unfortunate loss is that of &quot;The Case of Lena Smith&quot;, his last silent movie, and described as &quot;Sternberg&#x27;s most successful attempt at combining a story of meaning and purpose with his very original style.&quot; The film fell victim to the emerging talkie enthusiasm and was largely ignored by American critics, but in Europe &quot;its reputation is still high after decades of obscurity.&quot; The Austrian Film Museum has assembled archival material to reconstruct the film, including a 5-minute print fragment discovered in 2005.

=== Sound era: 1929–1935 ===
Paramount moved quickly to adapt Sternberg&#x27;s next feature, &quot;Thunderbolt&quot;, for sound release in 1929. An underworld melodrama-musical, its soundtrack employs innovative asynchronous and contrapuntal aural effects, often for comic relief. &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; garnered leading man George Bancroft a Best Actor Award nomination, but Sternberg&#x27;s future with Paramount was precarious due to the long string of commercial disappointments.

==== Magnum opus: &quot;The Blue Angel&quot;: 1930 ====
 Sternberg was summoned to Berlin by Paramount&#x27;s sister studio, UFA in 1929 to direct Emil Jannings in his first sound production, &quot;The Blue Angel&quot;. It would be &quot;the most important film&quot; of Sternberg&#x27;s career. Sternberg cast the then little-known Marlene Dietrich as Lola Lola, the female lead and nemesis of Jannings character Professor Immanuel Rath, whose passion for the young cabaret singer would reduce him to a &quot;spectacular cuckold.&quot; Dietrich became an international star overnight and followed Sternberg to Hollywood to produce six more collaborations at Paramount. Film historian Andrew Sarris contends that &quot;The Blue Angel&quot; is Sternberg&#x27;s &quot;most brutal and least humorous&quot; work of his oeuvre and yet the one film that the director&#x27;s &quot;most severe detractors will concede is beyond reproach or ridicule ... &quot;The Blue Angel&quot; stands up today as Sternberg&#x27;s most efficient achievement ...&quot;

Sternberg&#x27;s romantic infatuation with his new star created difficulties on and off the set. Jannings strenuously objected to Sternberg&#x27;s lavish attention to Dietrich&#x27;s performance, at the elder actor&#x27;s expense. Indeed, the &quot;tragic irony of &quot;The Blue Angel&quot;&quot; was &quot;paralleled in real life by the rise of Dietrich and the fall of Jannings&quot; in their respective careers.

Riza von Sternberg, who accompanied her spouse to Berlin, discerned that director and star were sexually involved. When Dietrich arrived in the United States in April 1930, Mrs. von Sternberg personally presented her with $100,000 libel lawsuits for public remarks made by the star that her marriage was failing, and a $500,000 suit for alienation of [Josef] Sternberg&#x27;s affections. The Sternberg-Dietrich-Royce scandal was &quot;in and out of the papers&quot;, but public awareness of the &quot;ugly scenes&quot; was largely concealed by Paramount executives. On June 5, 1931, the divorce was finalized providing $25,000 cash settlement to Mrs. Sternberg and a 5-year annual alimony of $1,200. In March 1932, the now divorced Riza Royce dropped her libel and alienation charges against Dietrich.

=== The Sternberg-Dietrich Hollywood Collaborations: 1930–1935 ===
Sternberg and Dietrich would unite to make six brilliant and controversial films for Paramount: &quot;Morocco&quot; (1930), &quot;Dishonored&quot; (1931), &quot;Shanghai Express&quot; (1932), &quot;Blonde Venus&quot; (1932), &quot;The Scarlet Empress&quot; (1934), and &quot;The Devil is a Woman&quot; (1935).
The stories are typically set in exotic locales including Saharan Africa, World War I Austria, revolutionary China, Imperial Russia, and fin-de-siècle Spain.

Sternberg&#x27;s &quot;outrageous aestheticism&quot; is on full display in these richly stylized works, both in technique and scenario. The actors in various guises represent figures from Sternberg&#x27;s &quot;emotional biography&quot;, the wellspring for his poetic dreamscapes.
Sternberg, largely indifferent to the studio publicity or to his movies&#x27; commercial success, enjoyed a degree of control over these pictures that permitted him to conceive and execute these works with Dietrich.

==== &quot;Morocco&quot; (1930) and &quot;Dishonored&quot; (1931) ====
Seeking to capitalize on the immense European success of &quot;The Blue Angel&quot;, though not yet released to American audiences, Paramount launched the Hollywood production of &quot;Morocco&quot;, an intrigue-romance starring Gary Cooper, Dietrich and Adolphe Menjou. The all-out promotional campaign declared Dietrich &quot;the woman all &quot;women&quot; want to see&quot;, providing a fascinated public with salacious hints about her private life and adding to the star&#x27;s glamor and notoriety. The fan press inserted an erotic component into her collaboration with Sternberg, encouraging Trilby-Svengali analogies. The publicity tended to distract critics from the genuine merits of the five movies that would follow and overshadowing the significance of Sternberg&#x27;s lifetime cinematic output.

&quot;Morocco&quot; serves as Sternberg&#x27;s exploration of Dietrich&#x27;s aptitude for conveying onscreen his own obsession with &quot;feminine mystique&quot;, a mystique that allowed for a sexual interplay blurring the distinction between male and female gender stereotypes. Sternberg demonstrates his fluency in the visual vocabulary of love: Dietrich dresses in drag and kisses a pretty female; Cooper flourishes a ladies&#x27; fan and places a rose behind his ear. In terms of romantic complexity, &quot;Morocco&quot; &quot;is Sternberg&#x27;s Hollywood movie &quot;par excellence&quot;&quot;.

The box-office success of &quot;Morocco&quot; was such that both Sternberg and Dietrich were awarded with contracts for three more films and generous increases in salary. The film earned Academy Award nominations in four categories.

&quot;Dishonored&quot;, Sternberg&#x27;s second Hollywood film, featuring Dietrich opposite Victor McLaglen, was completed before &quot;Morocco&quot; was released. A film of considerable levity but plot-wise one of his slightest works, this espionage-thriller is a sustained romp through the vicissitudes of spy-versus-spy deception and desire. The feature closes with the melodramatic military execution of Dietrich&#x27;s Agent X-27 (based on Dutch spy Mata Hari), the love-struck femme fatale, a scene that balances &quot;gallantry and ghoulishness.&quot;

==== Literary contretemps – &quot;An American Tragedy&quot;: 1931 ====
&quot;Dishonored&quot; had not met with the studio&#x27;s profit expectations at the box-office, and Paramount New York executives were struggling to find a vehicle to commercially exploit the &quot;mystique and glamor&quot; with which they had endowed the Sternberg-Dietrich productions. While Dietrich was visiting her husband, Rudolf Sieber and their daughter Maria Riva in Europe during the winter of 1930–31, Paramount enlisted Sternberg to film an adaption of novelist Theodore Dreiser&#x27;s novel &quot;An American Tragedy&quot;.

The production was initially under the direction of preeminent Soviet filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein. His socially deterministic filmic treatment of the novel was rejected by Paramount, and Eisenstein withdrew from the project. Already heavily invested financially in the production, the studio authorized a complete revision of the planned feature. While retaining Dreiser&#x27;s basic plot and dialogue, Sternberg eliminated its contemporary sociological underpinnings to present a tale of a sexually obsessed middle-class youth (Phillips Holmes) whose deceptions lead to the death of a poor factory girl (Sylvia Sidney). Dreiser was outraged at Sternberg&#x27;s failure to adhere to his themes in the adaptation and sued Paramount to stop distribution of the movie, but lost his case.

Images of water abound in the film and serve as a motif signaling Holmes&#x27; motivations and fate. The photography by Lee Garmes invested the scenes with a measure of intelligence and added visual polish to the overall production. Sternberg&#x27;s role as replacement director curbed his artistic investment in the project. As such, the picture bears little resemblance to his other works of that decade. Sternberg expressed indifference to the mixed critical success it received and banished the picture from his oeuvre.

When Dietrich returned to Hollywood in April 1931, Sternberg had emerged as a top-ranking director at Paramount and was poised to begin &quot;the richest and most controversial phase of his career.&quot; In the next three years he would create four of his greatest films. The first of these was &quot;Shanghai Express&quot;.

==== &quot;Shanghai Express&quot;: 1932 ====



The theme of the work, as in most of Sternberg&#x27;s films, is &quot;an examination of deception and desire&quot; in a spectacle pitting Dietrich against Clive Brook, a romantic struggle in which neither can satisfactorily prevail. Sternberg strips the denizens of the train, one-by-one, of their carefully crafted masks to reveal their petty or sordid existences. Dietrich&#x27;s notoriously enigmatic character, Shanghai Lily, transcends precise analysis but reflects Sternberg&#x27;s own personal involvement with his star and lover. Scriptwriter Jules Furthman famously provided Dietrich with the poignant admission, &quot;It took more than one man to change my name to Shanghai Lily.&quot;.

Sternberg honored the former filmmaker and early mentor Émile Chautard by casting him as the bemused Major Lenard.

With &quot;Shanghai Express&quot;, Sternberg exhibits complete mastery over every element of his work: décor, photography, sound and acting. Lee Garmes, who would serve as cinematographer on this suite of films, won an Academy Award, and both Sternberg and the movie were nominated in their categories.

==== &quot;Blonde Venus&quot;: 1932 ====

When Sternberg embarked on his next feature, &quot;Blonde Venus&quot;, Paramount Pictures&#x27; finances were in jeopardy. Profits had plummeted due to a decline in theatre attendance among working class moviegoers. Fearing bankruptcy, the New York executives tightened control over Hollywood film content. Dietrich&#x27;s heretofore forthright portrayals of demi-mondes (&quot;Dishonored&quot;, &quot;Shanghai Express&quot;) were suspended in favor of a heroine who embraced a degree of American-style domesticity. Producer B. P. Schulberg was banking on the success of further Sternberg-Dietrich collaborations to help the studio survive the financial downturn.

Sternberg&#x27;s original story for &quot;Blonde Venus&quot; and the screenplay by Furthman and S.K. Lauren presents a narrative of a fallen woman, with the caveat that she is ultimately forgiven by her long suffering husband. The narrative exhibited the &quot;sordid self-sacrifice&quot; that was &quot;de rigueur&quot; for Hollywood&#x27;s top female performers, yet the studio balked at the redemptive denouement.
When Sternberg declined to alter the ending, Paramount put the project on hold and threatened the filmmaker with a lawsuit. Dietrich joined Sternberg in defying the New York executives. Minor adjustments were made that satisfied the studio, but Sternberg&#x27;s compromises would revert to him after the less than stellar critical and box-office success of the movie.

Paramount&#x27;s toleration of the duo&#x27;s defiance was conditioned largely by the considerable profits that they were reaping from &quot;Shanghai Express&quot;, over $3 million in early distribution.

&quot;Blonde Venus&quot; opens with the idealized courtship and marriage of Dietrich and mild-mannered chemist Herbert Marshall. Quickly ensconced as a Brooklyn, New York housewife and burdened with an impish son Dickie Moore, she is compelled to make herself a mistress to politico and nightclub gangster Cary Grant when her husband requires expensive medical treatment for radiation exposure. The plot grows increasingly improbable as Dietrich resurrects her theatrical career that takes to exotic locations around the world – with her little boy in tow.

The movie is ostensibly about the devotion of a mother for her child, a subject that Sternberg uses to dramatize the traumas of his own childhood and his harsh experiences as a transient laborer in his youth. With &quot;Blonde Venus&quot;, Sternberg reached his apogee stylistically. A film of great visual beauty achieved through multiple layers of evocative décor where style displaces and transcends personal characterizations.
Between the highly episodic narrative, disparate locales, and an unimpressive supporting cast, the movie is frequently dismissed by critics.
&quot;Blonde Venus&quot; &quot;camp&quot; designation is attributable in part to the outrageous and extremely stylized &quot;Hot Voodoo&quot; nightclub sequence. Dietrich, the beauty, assumes the role of the beast and emerges from an ape costume.

Paramount&#x27;s expectations for &quot;Blonde Venus&quot; were out of proportion to realities of declining theatre attendance. Though not an unprofitable picture, the less than robust critical acclaim weakened the studio&#x27;s commitment to sustaining further Sternberg-Dietrich creations.

At odds with Paramount and their individual contracts nearly expired, Sternberg and Dietrich privately conceived of forming an independent production company in Germany. Studio executives were suspicious when Sternberg offered no objections when Dietrich was scheduled to star in director Rouben Mamoulian&#x27;s &quot;The Song of Songs&quot; (1933) in the final weeks of her term. When Dietrich balked at the assignment, Paramount quickly sued her for potential losses. Courtroom testimony revealed that she was preparing to abscond to Berlin to pursue filmmaking with Sternberg. Paramount prevailed in court, and Dietrich was required to remain in Hollywood and complete the film. Any hopes for such a venture were dashed when the National Socialists were ushered into power in January 1933 and Sternberg returned to Hollywood in April 1933. Abandoning their plans for independent filmmaking, both Sternberg and Dietrich reluctantly signed a two-film contract with the studio on May 9, 1933.

Reacting to Paramount&#x27;s increasing coolness towards his films and to the general disarray that plagued studio management since 1932, Sternberg prepared to make one of his most monumental movies: &quot;The Scarlett Empress&quot;, a &quot;relentless excursion into style&quot; that would antagonize Paramount and mark the onset of a distinct phase in his creative output.

==== &quot;The Scarlet Empress&quot;: 1934 ====

&quot;The Scarlet Empress&quot;, an historical drama concerning the rise of Catherine the Great of Russia, had been adapted to film on several occasions by American and European directors when Sternberg began organizing the project. In this, his penultimate film starring Dietrich, Sternberg abandoned contemporary America as a subject and contrived a fantastical 18th-century Imperial Russia, &quot;grotesque and spectacular&quot;, stupefying contemporary audiences with its stylistic excesses.

The narrative follows the rise of the child Sophia &quot;Sophie&quot; Frederica through adolescence to become Empress of Russia, with special emphasis on her sexual awakening and her inexorable sexual and political conquests. Sternberg&#x27;s decision to examine the erotic decadence among 18th-century Russian nobility was partly an attempt to blindside censors, as historical dramas &quot;ipso facto&quot; were granted a measure of decorum and gravity. The sheer sumptuousness of the sets and décor obscure the allegorical nature of the film: the transformation of the director and star into pawns controlled by the corporate powers that exalt ambition and wealth, &quot;a nightmare vision of the American dream.&quot;

The film portrays 18th-century Russian nobility as developmentally arrested and sexually infantile, a disturbed and grotesque portrayal of Sternberg&#x27;s own childhood experiences, linking eroticism and sadism. The opening sequence examines the young Sophia (later Catherine II) early sexual awareness, conflating eroticism and torture, that serves as a harbinger of the sadism that she will indulge in as an empress. Whereas &quot;Blonde Venus&quot; portrayed Dietrich as a candidate for mother love, the maternal figures in &quot;The Scarlet Empress&quot; make a mockery of any pretense to such idealizations. Dietrich is reduced to a fantastic and helpless clothes horse, bereft of any dramatic function.

Despite withholding distribution of the film for eight months, so as not to compete with the recently issued United Artists film &quot;The Rise of Catherine the Great&quot; (1934), starring Elisabeth Bergner, the movie was dismissed by critics and the public. Americans, preoccupied with the challenges of the financial crisis were in no mood for a picture that appeared to be an exercise in self-indulgence. The film&#x27;s conspicuous failure among moviegoers was a blow to Sternberg&#x27;s professional reputation, recalling his 1926 disaster, &quot;A Woman of the Sea&quot;.

Sternberg embarked on the final film of his contract knowing that he was finished at Paramount. The studio was undergoing a realignment in management that was the fall of producer Schulberg, a Sternberg stalwart, and the rise of Ernst Lubitsch, which did not bode well for the director. As his personal relationship with Dietrich deteriorated, the studio made clear that her professional career would proceed independently of his. With the cynical blessing of incoming production manager Ernst Lubitsch, Sternberg was given full control over what would be his final film with Marlene Dietrich: &quot;The Devil is a Woman&quot;.

==== &quot;The Devil is a Woman&quot;: 1935 ====

&quot;The Devil is a Woman&quot; is Sternberg&#x27;s cinematic tribute and confession to his collaborator and muse Marlene Dietrich. In this final tribute he sets forth his reflections on their five-year professional and personal association.

His key thematic preoccupation is fully articulate here: the spectacle of an individual&#x27;s conspicuous loss of prestige and authority as the price demanded for surrendering to a sexual obsession. To this endeavor Sternberg brought to bear all the sophisticated filmic elements at his disposal. Sternberg&#x27;s official handling of the photography is a measure of this.

Based on a novel by Pierre Louÿs, &quot;The Woman and the Puppet&quot; (1908), the drama unfolds in Spain&#x27;s famous carnival at the end of the 19th century. A love triangle develops pitting the young revolutionary Antonio (Cesar Romero) against the middle-aged former military officer Don Pasqual (Lionel Atwill) in a contest for the love of the devastatingly beautiful demi-mondaine Concha (Dietrich). Despite the gaiety of the setting, the film has a dark, brooding, reflective quality. The contest ends in a duel where Don Pasqual is wounded, perhaps mortally: the denouement is never made explicit.

More so than any of his previous pictures, Sternberg picked a leading man (Atwill) who is the director&#x27;s double in more than facial appearance: short stature, stern countenance, proud bearing, verbal mannerisms and immaculate attire. Sternberg has effectively stepped from behind the camera to play opposite Dietrich. This deliberate self-portraiture signals that the film is a submerged commentary on the decline of his career in the movie industry as well as his loss of Dietrich as a lover. The sharp exchanges between Concha and Pasqual are filled with bitter recriminations. The players do not emote to convey feeling. Rather, Sternberg carefully applies layer upon layer of décor in front of the lens to create a three-dimensional effect. When an actor steps into this pictorial canvas, the most delicate gesture registers emotion. His outstanding control over the visual integrity is the foundation for much of the eloquence and force of Sternberg&#x27;s cinema.

The March 1935 premiere of &quot;The Devil is a Woman&quot; in Hollywood was accompanied by a press statement from Paramount announcing that Sternberg&#x27;s contract would not be renewed. The director anticipated his termination with his own declaration before the film&#x27;s release explicitly severing his professional ties with Dietrich, writing &quot;Miss Dietrich and I have progressed as far as possible ... if we continued, we would get into a pattern that would be harmful to both of us.&quot;

Even with better than expected reviews, &quot;The Devil is a Woman&quot; cost Sternberg his reputation in the film industry. Sternberg would never again enjoy the largesse nor the prestige that had been conferred on him at Paramount.

A postscript to the release of &quot;The Devil is a Woman&quot; concerns a formal protest issued by the Spanish government protesting the film&#x27;s purported disparagement of &quot;the Spanish armed forces&quot; and an insult to the character of the Spanish people. The objectionable scenes depict Civil Guards as inept at controlling carnival merrymakers, and a shot of a policeman consuming an alcoholic beverage in a café. Paramount president Adolph Zukor agreed to suppress the picture in the interest of protecting US-Spain trade agreements – and to protect Paramount film distribution in the country.

== Columbia Pictures: 1935–1936 ==
The personnel shakeup that followed bankruptcy at Paramount in 1934 prompted an exodus of talent. Two of the refugees, producer Schulberg and screenwriter Furthman, were picked up by the manager-owner of the Columbia Pictures, Harry Cohn. These two former colleagues sponsored Sternberg&#x27;s engagement at the low-budget studio for a two-picture contract.

=== &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;: 1935 ===

An adaption of the 19th-century Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; was Sternberg&#x27;s first project at Columbia, and a mismatch in terms of his aptitudes and interests. Presenting literary masterpieces to the masses was an industry-wide rage during the financially strapped 1930s. As copyrights on these works were generally expired, the studio paid no fees.

Sternberg invested Dostoevsky&#x27;s work with a measure of style, but any attempt to convey the complexity of the author&#x27;s character analysis was suspended in favor of a straightforward, albeit suspenseless, detective story. However uninspired, Sternberg proved an able craftsman, dispelling some of the myths regarding his eccentricities, and the film proved satisfactory to Columbia.

=== &quot;The King Steps Out&quot;: 1936 ===

Columbia had high hopes for Sternberg&#x27;s next feature, &quot;The King Steps Out&quot;, starring soprano Grace Moore and based on Fritz Kreisler&#x27;s operetta &quot;Cissy&quot;. A comedy of errors concerning Austrian royalty set in Vienna, the production was undermined by personal and professional discord between opera diva and director. Sternberg found himself unable to identify himself with his leading lady or adapt his style to the demands of operetta. Wishing to distance himself from the fiasco, Sternberg quickly departed Columbia Pictures after the film&#x27;s completion. &quot;The King Steps Out&quot; is the only movie that he insisted be expunged from any retrospective of his work.

In the wake of his distressing two-picture sojourn at Columbia Pictures, Sternberg oversaw the construction of a home on his 30-acre (12-hectares) property in the San Fernando Valley north of Hollywood. Designed by architect Richard Neutra, the avant-garde structure was built to the director&#x27;s specifications, featuring a faux-moat, an eight-foot (2.4 meter) exterior steel wall and bullet-proof windows. The siege-like character of this desert retreat reflected Sternberg&#x27;s apprehensions regarding his professional career, as well as his mania to assert strict control over his identity.

From 1935 to 1936, Sternberg travelled extensively in the Far East, cataloging his first impressions for future artistic endeavors. During these excursions he made the acquaintance of Japanese film distributor Nagamasa Kawakita – they would collaborate on Sternberg&#x27;s final movie in 1953.

In Java Sternberg contracted a life-threatening abdominal infection, requiring his immediate return to Europe for surgery.

== London Films – &quot;I, Claudius&quot;: 1937 ==

While convalescing in London, the 42-year-old director, his creative powers still fully intact, was approached by London Films&#x27; Alexander Korda. The British movie impresario asked Sternberg to film novelist and poet Robert Graves&#x27;s biographical account of Roman Emperor Claudius. Already in pre-production, Marlene Dietrich had intervened on Sternberg&#x27;s behalf to see that Korda selected her former collaborator rather than the British director William Cameron Menzies.

Claudius as conceived by Graves is &quot;a Sternbergian figure of classic proportions&quot; possessing all the elements for a great film. Played by Charles Laughton, Claudius is an aging, erudite and unwitting successor to the Emperor Caligula. When thrust into power, he initially governs upon the precepts of his heretofore virtuous life. As emperor, he warms to his tasks as a social reformer and military commander. When his young wife, Messalina (Merle Oberon) proves unfaithful while Claudius is away campaigning, he launches his armies against Rome and signs her death warrant. Proclaimed a living god, the now dehumanized and megalomaniacal Claudius meets his tragic fate: to rule his empire utterly alone. The dual themes of virtue corrupted by power, and the cruel paradox that degradation must precede self-empowerment were immensely appealing to Sternberg both personally and artistically.

Korda was eager to get the production underway, as Charles Laughton&#x27;s contract would likely expire during shooting.

Korda had already assembled a talented cast and crew when Sternberg assumed his directorial duties in January 1937. The Austrian-American injected a measure of discipline into the London Film&#x27;s Denham studio, an indication of the seriousness with which Sternberg approached this ambitious project.
When shooting commenced in mid-February Sternberg, a martinet who was prone to reducing his performers &quot;to mere details of décor&quot;, soon clashed with Laughton, London Film&#x27;s Academy Award-winning star.

As a performer, Laughton required the active intervention of the director to consummate a role – &quot;a midwife&quot; according to Korda. Short of this he could be sullen and intransigent.

Sternberg, who had a clear insight cinematically and emotionally as to the Claudius he wished to create, struggled with Laughton in frequent &quot;artistic arguments&quot;. Suffering under Sternberg&#x27;s high-handedness, the actor announced five weeks into the filming that he would be departing London Film when his contract expired on April 21, 1937. Korda, now under pressure to expedite the production, discreetly sounded Sternberg on the film&#x27;s likely completion date. With only half the picture in the can, an exasperated Sternberg exploded, declaring that he was engaged in an artistic endeavor, not a race to a deadline.

On March 16, with growing personnel animosities and looming cost overruns, actress Merle Oberon was seriously injured in an automobile accident. Though expected to recover quickly, Korda seized upon the mishap as a pretext to terminate what he had concluded was an ill-fated venture.

The film negative and prints were placed into storage at Denham Studio and London Films collected sizable insurance compensation.
The greatest share of misfortune accrued to Sternberg. The surviving film sequences suggest that &quot;I, Claudius&quot; might have been a genuinely great work. When production was aborted, Sternberg lost his last opportunity to reassert his status as a top-rung filmmaker.

The collapse of the London Film production was not without its impact on Sternberg. He is reported to have checked into Charring Cross Psychiatric Unit in the aftermath of the shoot. Sternberg&#x27;s persistent desire to find work kept him in Europe from 1937 to 1938.

He approached Czech soprano Jarmila Novotná as to her availability to star in an adaptation of Franz Werfel&#x27;s &quot;The Forty Days of Musa Dagh&quot;, but she demurred.
Reviving their mutual interest in playwright Luigi Pirandello&#x27;s &quot;Six Characters in Search of an Author&quot;, Sternberg and director Max Reinhardt attempted to obtain the rights but the cost was prohibitive.

At the end of 1937, Sternberg arranged for Austrian financing to film a version of &quot;Germinal&quot; by Émile Zola, successfully acquiring Hilde Krahl and Jean-Louis Barrault for the lead roles. Final preparations were underway when Sternberg collapsed due to a relapse of the illness he had contracted in Java. While he was convalescing in London, Germany invaded Austria and the project had to be abandoned. Sternberg returned to his home in California to recover but found he had developed a chronic heart condition that would plague him for his remaining years.

== M-G-M redux: 1938–1939 ==
In October 1938, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer asked Sternberg to finish up a few scenes for departing French director Julien Duvivier&#x27;s &quot;The Great Waltz&quot;. His association with M-G-M twelve years previously had ended in an abrupt departure. After completing that simple assignment, the studio engaged Sternberg for a one-movie contract to direct a largely pre-packaged vehicle for Austrian-born Hedy Lamarr, the recent star of &quot;Algiers&quot;. Metro was motivated by Sternberg&#x27;s success with Marlene Dietrich at Paramount, anticipating that he would instill some warmth in Lamarr&#x27;s screen image.

Sternberg worked on &quot;New York Cinderella&quot; for little more than a week and resigned. The movie was completed by W. S. Van Dyke as &quot;I Take This Woman&quot; in 1940. The feature was panned by critics.

Sternberg returned to the crime drama, a genre he had created in the silent era, in order to fulfill his contract to M-G-M: &quot;Sergeant Madden&quot;.

=== &quot;Sergeant Madden&quot;: 1939 ===
A paternalistic patrolman (Wallace Beery) rises through the ranks to become sergeant. As father he presides over a blended family of natural and adopted children: a biological son (Alan Curtis) and adopted children (Tom Brown and Laraine Day). After the natural son marries his &quot;sister&quot;, he turns to crime and dies in a police shootout, in which Beery participates. The adopted and dutiful son emulates his father to become a good cop and marries his deceased brother&#x27;s wife.

The film is notable in that the theme and style strongly resemble German films of the post-WWI period. Thematically, the precept that social duty is superior to family loyalty was commonplace in German literature and film. In particular, the spectacle of an adopted son displacing an interior offspring in a test of physical and moral strength thus proves his worth to society. The central conflict in &quot;Sergeant Madden&quot; recounts the natural son (Curtis) engages in mortal combat with a powerful father (Beery), bears parallels to Sternberg&#x27;s boyhood struggles with his tyrannical father Moses.

Stylistically, Sternberg&#x27;s film techniques mimic the dark, gray atmosphere of the German Expressionist films of the 1920s. The minor characters in &quot;Sergeant Madden&quot; appear to have been recruited from the films of F. W. Murnau. Despite some resistance from the bombastic Beery, Sternberg coaxed a relatively restrained performance that recalls Emil Jannings.

== United Artists redux – 1940–1941 ==
Sternberg&#x27;s restrained directorial performance at Metro reassured Hollywood executives and United Artists provided him with the resources to make the last of his classic films: &quot;The Shanghai Gesture&quot;.

=== Shanghai Gesture: 1941 ===

German producer Arnold Pressburger, an early associate of the director, held the rights to a John Colton play entitled &quot;The Shanghai Gesture&quot; (1926). This &quot;sensational&quot; work surveyed the &quot;decadent and depraved&quot; denizens of a Shanghai brothel and opium den operated by a &quot;Mother Goddam&quot;. Colton&#x27;s lurid tale presented difficulties to adaption in 1940 when strictures imposed by the Hays Office were in full force. Salacious behavior and depictions of drug use, including opium, were forbidden, leading censors to disqualify more than thirty efforts to transfer &quot;The Shanghai Gesture&quot; to the screen. Veteran screenwriter Jules Furthman with assistance from Karl Vollmöller and Géza Herczeg formulated a bowdlerized version which passed muster. Sternberg made some additions to the scenario and agreed to film it. Paul Ivano, Sternberg&#x27;s cinematographer on &quot;A Woman of the Sea&quot; was enlisted as cameraman.

To satisfy censors, the story is set in a Shanghai casino, rather than a brothel; the name of the proprietress of the establishment is softened to &quot;Mother Gin-Sling&quot;, rather than the impious &quot;Mother Goddam&quot; in the Colton&#x27;s original. Gin-Sling&#x27;s half-caste daughter Gene Tierney – the result of a coupling between Gin-Sling and British official Sir Guy Charteris Walter Huston – is the product of European finishing schools rather than a courtesan raised in her mother&#x27;s whore house. The degradation of daughter who sports the nickname &quot;Poppy&quot; is no less degraded by her privileged upbringing.

Sternberg augmented the original story by inserting two compelling characters: Doctor Omar (Victor Mature) and Dixie Pomeroy (Phyllis Brooks). Dr. Omar – &quot;Doctor of Nothing&quot; – is a complacent sybarite impressive only to cynical casino regulars. His scholarly epithet has no more substance than Sternberg&#x27;s &quot;von&quot; and the director humorously exposes the pretense. The figure of Dixie, a former Brooklyn chorus girl contrasts with Tierney&#x27;s continental beauty and this all-American commoner takes the measure of the banal Omar. Poppy, lacking &quot;the humor, intelligence and an appreciation of the absurd&quot; succumbs to the voluptuous Omar – and Sternberg cinematically reveals the absurdity of the relationship.

The veiled parental confrontation between Charteris and Gin-Sling revives only past humiliations and suffering, and Poppy is sacrificed on the altar of this heartless union. Charteris obsessive rectitude blinds him to the terrible irony of his daughter&#x27;s murder.

&quot;The Shanghai Gesture&quot; is a tour-de-force with Sternberg&#x27;s sheer &quot;physical expressiveness&quot; of his characters that conveys both emotion and motivation. In Freudian terms, the gestures serve as symbols of &quot;impotence, castration, onanism and transvestism&quot; revealing Sternberg&#x27;s obsession with the human condition.

== Department of War Information – &quot;The American Scene&quot;: 1943–1945 ==
On July 29, 1943, the 49-year-old Sternberg married Jeanne Annette McBride, his 21-year-old administrative assistant at his home in North Hollywood in a private ceremony.

=== &quot;The Town&quot;: 1943 ===
In the midst of World War II, Sternberg, in a civilian capacity, was asked by the United States Office of War Information to make a single film, a one-reel documentary for the series entitled &quot;The American Scene&quot;, a domestic version of the combat and recruitment oriented &quot;Why We Fight&quot;. Whereas his service with the Signal Corps in World War I included filming shorts demonstrating the proper use of fixed bayonets, this 11-minute documentary &quot;The Town&quot; is a portrait of a small American community in the Midwest with emphasis on the cultural contributions of its European immigrants.

Aesthetically, this short documentary exhibits none of Sternberg&#x27;s typical stylistic elements. In this respect it is the only purely realistic work he ever created. It is executed, nonetheless, with perfect ease and efficiency, and his &quot;sense of composition and continuity&quot; is strikingly executed. &quot;The Town&quot; was translated into 32 languages and distributed overseas in 1945.

At the end of the war, Sternberg was hired by producer David O. Selznick, an admirer of the director, to serve as a roving advisor and assistant on the film &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot;, starring Gregory Peck. Attached to the unit overseen by filmmaker King Vidor, Sternberg pitched into any task he was assigned with alacrity. Sternberg continued to seek a sponsor for a highly personal project entitled &quot;The Seven Bad Years&quot;, a journey into self-analysis concerning his childhood and its ramifications for his adult life. When no commercial backing materialized, Sternberg abandoned hopes for support from Hollywood and returned to his home in Weehawken, New Jersey, in 1947.

== RKO Pictures: 1949–1952 ==
For two years Sternberg resided at Weehawken, unemployed and in semi-retirement. He married Meri Otis Wilmer in 1948 and soon had a child and a family to support.

In 1949, screenwriter Jules Furthman, now a co-producer for Howard Hughes&#x27; RKO studios in Hollywood, nominated Sternberg to film a color feature. Oddly, Hughes demanded a film test from the 55-year-old director. Sternberg dutifully submitted a demonstration of his skills and RKO, satisfied, presented him with a two-picture contract. In 1950, he began filming the Cold War-era &quot;Jet Pilot&quot;.

=== &quot;Jet Pilot&quot;: 1951 ===
As a precondition, Sternberg agreed to deliver a conventional movie that focused on aviation themes and hardware, avoiding the erotic embellishments he was famous for.
In a Furthman script that resembled a comic-book narrative, a Soviet pilot-spy Janet Leigh lands her Mig fighter at a USAF base in Alaska, posing as defector. Suspicious, the base commander assigns American pilot John Wayne to play counter-spy. Mutual respect leads to love between the two aviators and when Leigh is denied asylum, Wayne weds her to avoid Leigh&#x27;s deportation. The USAF sends them to Russia to spread fraudulent intelligence, but upon his return to the air base Wayne is suspected of acting as a double agent and scheduled for brainwashing. Leigh arranges for their escape to Austria.

Janet Leigh is placed at the visual center of the film. She is permitted a measure of eroticism that contrasts sharply and humorously with the All-American pretensions of the Furthman script. Sternberg stealthily inserted some subversive elements in this paean of cold war militarism. During the airborne refueling scenes (anticipating Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Strangelove)&quot;, the fighter jets take on the persona and attributes of Leigh and Wayne.

Sternberg wrapped up shooting in merely seven weeks, but the picture was fated to undergo innumerable permutations until it finally enjoyed distribution – and a moderate commercial success – by Universal Studios six years later in September 1957.

With &quot;Jet Pilot&quot; completed, Sternberg immediately turned to his second film for RKO: &quot;Macao&quot;.

=== &quot;Macao&quot;: 1952 ===

To Sternberg&#x27;s discomfiture, RKO maintained strict control when filming commenced in September 1950. The thriller is set in the exotic locale of Macao, at the time a Portuguese colony on the coast of China. American drifters Robert Mitchum and gold-digger Jane Russell become involved in an intrigue to lure corrupt casino owner and jewel smuggler Brad Dexter offshore into international waters so he can be arrested by US lawman William Bendix. Mistaken identities put Mitchum in danger and murders ensue, ending in a dramatic fight scene.

Cinematically, the only evidence that Sternberg directed the picture is where he managed to impose his stylistic signature: a waterfront chase that features hanging fish nets; a feather pillow exploding in an electric fan. His handling of the climactic fight between Mitchum and Dexter was deemed deficient by producers. Mastery over action scenes predictably eluded Sternberg and director Nicholas Ray (uncredited) was summoned to re-shoot the sequence in the final stages of production. Contrary to Hughes&#x27;s inclination to retain Sternberg as a director at RKO, no new contract was forthcoming.

Persevering in his efforts to launch an independent project, Sternberg obtained an option on novelist Shelby Foote&#x27;s tale of sin and redemption, &quot;Follow Me Down&quot;, but failed to obtain funding.

Visiting New York in 1951, Sternberg renewed his friendship with Japanese producer Nagamasa Kawakita, and they agreed to pursue a joint production in Japan. From this alliance would emerge Sternberg&#x27;s most personal film – and his last: &quot;The Saga of Anahatan&quot;.

== Later career ==

Between 1959 and 1963, Sternberg taught a course on film aesthetics at the University of California, Los Angeles, based on his own works. His students included undergraduate Jim Morrison and graduate student Ray Manzarek, who went on to form the rock group The Doors shortly after receiving their respective degrees in 1965. The group recorded songs referring to Sternberg, with Manzarek later characterizing Sternberg as &quot;perhaps the greatest single influence on The Doors.&quot;

When not working in California, Sternberg lived in a house that he built for himself in Weehawken, New Jersey. He collected contemporary art and was also a philatelist, and he developed an interest in the Chinese postal system which led to him studying the Chinese language. He was often a juror at film festivals.

Sternberg wrote an autobiography, &quot;Fun in a Chinese Laundry&quot; (1965); the title was drawn from an early film comedy. &quot;Variety&quot; described it as a &quot;bitter reflection on how a master artisan can be ignored and bypassed by an art form to which he had contributed so much.&quot; He had a heart attack and was admitted to Midway Hospital Medical Center in Hollywood and died within a week on December 22, 1969, aged 75. He was interred in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Westwood, California near several film studios.

== Comments by contemporaries ==

Scottish-American screenwriter Aeneas MacKenzie: &quot;To understand what Sternberg is attempting to do, one must first appreciate that he imposes the limitations of the visual upon himself: he refuses to obtain any effect whatsoever save by means of pictorial composition. That is the fundamental distinction between von Sternberg and all other directors. Stage acting he declines, cinema in its conventional aspect he despises as mere mechanics, and dialogue he employs primarily for its value as integrated sound. The screen is his medium – not the camera. His purpose is to reveal the emotional significance of a subject by a series of magnificent canvases&quot;.

American film actress and dancer Louise Brooks: &quot;Sternberg, with his detachment, could look at a woman and say &#x27;this is beautiful about her and I&#x27;ll leave it ... and this is ugly about her and I&#x27;ll eliminate it&#x27;. Take away the bad and leave what is beautiful so she&#x27;s complete ... He was the greatest director of women that ever, ever was&quot;.

American actor Edward Arnold: &quot;It may be true that [von Sternberg] is a destroyer of whatever egotism an actor possesses, and that he crushes the individuality of those he directs in pictures ... the first days filming &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; ... I had the feeling through the whole production of the picture that he wanted to break me down ... to destroy my individuality ... Probably anyone working with Sternberg over a long period would become used to his idiosyncrasies. Whatever his methods, he got the best he could out of his actors ... I consider that part of the Inspector General one [of] the best I have ever done in the talkies&quot;.

American film critic Andrew Sarris: &quot;Sternberg resisted the heresy of acting autonomy to the very end of his career, and that resistance is very likely one of the reasons his career was foreshortened&quot;.

<text>Phra Sunthorn Vohara (Phu) (, , ; 26 June 1786 – 1855), known as Sunthorn Phu (, , ), is Thailand&#x27;s best-known royal poet. He wrote during the Rattanakosin period.

Phu&#x27;s career as a royal poet began in the reign of King Rama II, and when the king died, he resigned from the role and became a monk. Twenty years later, in the reign of King Rama III, he returned to court as a royal scribe, where he remained for the rest of his life.

Phu was renowned for composing verse, and his epic poetry is popular in Thailand to the present day. His works include &quot;Nirat Phukhao Thong&quot;, a collection of poems recounting his journey to the Golden Mountain; &quot;Nirat Suphan&quot;, his journey to Suphan Buri province; and the &quot;Phra Aphai Mani&quot; saga.

==Biography==
Sunthorn Phu was born in the reign of King Rama I, on 26 June 1786 (year of the Horse), around 8.00 a.m. His family&#x27;s house was behind the royal palace, near the present day Bangkok Noi railway station and Wang Lang Market. It is generally understood that his father was from Ban Kram, Klaeng district, Rayong province, but in the belief of a new generation of historians that in fact his father was of Brahmin lineage from Ban Samo Phlue, Ban Lat district in Phetchaburi province today.

At the time the epic poet was born, Bangkok had been established as the Thai capital just four years earlier, founding the Rattanakosin era which continues to the present day.

His father and mother divorced. His father became a monk at Ban Kram temple. His mother became a wet nurse for the royal family. Phu had an opportunity to work in the palace with his mother, where he fell in love with a lady in the palace named Chan, who was related to the royal family. The couple were arrested and punished as their relationship violated the traditional social order, but they were pardoned on the king&#x27;s death.

Phu later returned to Rayong to visit his father, and wrote a poem about the journey called &quot;Nirat Mueang Klaeng&quot; which became one of his most famous poems. He wrote the epic poem for his fiancée, Chan. After he returned to the palace in Bangkok he married Chan, and they had a son named Phat. It was at this time that King Rama II appointed him court poet. However, the couple were not married long, divorcing after Phu had an affair with another woman. This was the first of many marriages ending in divorce, although he later professed that the wife he had loved the most was Chan. Phu became an alcoholic, and, around 1821, was jailed after a fight.

He began the poem, &quot;Phra Aphai Mani&quot; in prison, and published it in installments over the next twenty years. The epic tale follows the title character, Prince Aphai Mani, a Byronic hero, in his romantic adventures throughout ancient Thailand.

King Rama II was so pleased with Phu&#x27;s poetry that he awarded him the title of &quot;Khun&quot;. During the reign of King Rama III, however, Phu made the grave mistake of publicly correcting one of the king&#x27;s poems, and was stripped of his title as punishment. After this disgrace, he initially entered the Buddhist priesthood, but later became a merchant.

During the reign of King Rama IV, Phu came into the service of viceroy (or vice-king) Pinklao as head of the Front Palace&#x27;s Royal Scribes Department, and was awarded the title of &quot;Phra&quot;. He died in 1855 at a house by the Khlong Chak Phra canal near Wat Rae Rai temple in Taling Chan district, Bangkok.

==Legacy==
Sunthorn left behind a legacy of poems that have become famous over time because of their description of Thai history. In 1986, the 200th anniversary of his birth, Sunthorn Phu was honored by UNESCO as a great world poet. His &quot;Phra Aphai Mani&quot; poems describe a fantastical world, where people of all races and religions live and interact together in harmony.

Recently, his literary works have been adapted in various media such as comics, films and songs. Thai cinema&#x27;s first and only cel-animated cartoon feature film, &quot;The Adventure of Sudsakorn&quot; (1979), was based on a character from &quot;Phra Aphai Mani&quot;. It was directed by Payut Ngaokrachang. A live-action version of the tale was made in 2006, titled &quot;Legend of Sudsakorn&quot;.

Monuments of two characters from his epic work, &quot;Phra Aphai Mani&quot; have been erected on Ko Samet&#x27;s Hat Sai Kaeo beach, the title character, Prince Aphai Mani, and the siren/mermaid character.

===Memorial===
A memorial to Sunthorn Phu was elected in Klaeng district, Rayong province, the birthplace of his father. His birthday, 26 June, is celebrated in Thailand as Sunthorn Phu Day.

Sunthorn Phu Memorial Park is a 33.15 acre facility. The foundation stone was set on 30 December 1955 by Prime Minister Pibulsongkram, but construction stopped for 10 years, until 1968. The Rayong Governor at that time was Vithya Kasetsaowapak who donated 962,766.10 baht to purchase the land. It was completed on 5 March 1970 and had its official opening on 25 May 1970.

The memorial sits on a hillside. Three sculptures surround the statue of Sunthorn Phu. The other sculptures represent the main characters in his literary works, including Prince Aphai Mani, the ocean butterfly, and the mermaid. Sukij Laidej created the Phu statue. Gaisorn Srisuwan sculpted Aphai Mani. Saroj Jaruc carved the mermaid, and Thana Laohathaikul executed the ocean butterfly.

<doc id="690485" wikidata="Q974034" url="?curid=690485" title="Hire purchase">
<text>A hire purchase (HP), also known as an installment plan, is an arrangement whereby a customer agrees to a contract to acquire an asset by paying an initial installment (e.g., 40% of the total) and repaying the balance of the price of the asset plus interest over a period of time. Other analogous practices are described as closed-end leasing or rent to own.

The hire purchase agreement was developed in the United Kingdom in the 19th century to allow customers with a cash shortage to make an expensive purchase they otherwise would have to delay or forgo. For example, in cases where a buyer cannot afford to pay the asked price for an item of property as a lump sum but can afford to pay a percentage as a deposit, a hire-purchase contract allows the buyer to hire the goods for a monthly rent. When a sum equal to the original full price plus interest has been paid in equal installments, the buyer may then exercise an option to buy the goods at a predetermined price (usually a nominal sum) or return the goods to the owner.

If the buyer defaults in paying the installments, the owner may repossess the goods, a vendor protection not available with unsecured-consumer-credit systems. HP is frequently advantageous to consumers because it spreads the cost of expensive items over an extended time period. Business consumers may find the different balance sheet and taxation treatment of hire-purchased goods beneficial to their taxable income. The need for HP is reduced when consumers have collateral or other forms of credit readily available, such as credit cards.

These contracts are most commonly used for items such as automobiles and high-value electrical goods where the purchasers are unable to pay for the goods directly.

==Standard provisions==
To be valid, HP agreements must be in writing and signed by both parties. They must clearly lay out the following information in a print that all can read without effort:
#a clear description of the goods
#the cash price for the goods
#the HP price (i.e., the total sum that must be paid to hire and then purchase the goods)
#the deposit
#the monthly installments (most states require that the applicable interest rate is disclosed and regulate the rates and charges that can be applied in HP transactions)
#a reasonably comprehensive statement of the parties&#x27; rights (sometimes including the right to cancel the agreement during a &quot;cooling-off&quot; period)
# The right of the hirer to terminate the contract when he feels like doing so with a valid reason

==The seller and the owner==
If the seller has the resources and the legal right to sell the goods on credit (which usually depends on a licensing system in most countries), the seller and the owner will be the same person. But most sellers prefer to receive a cash payment immediately. To achieve this, the seller transfers ownership of the goods to a Finance Company, usually at a discounted price, and it is this company that hires and sells the goods to the buyer. This introduction of a third party complicates the transaction. Suppose that the seller makes false claims as to the quality and reliability of the goods that induce the buyer to &quot;buy&quot;. In a conventional contract of sale, the seller will be liable to the buyer if these representations prove false. But in this instance, the seller who makes the representation is not the owner who sells the goods to the buyer only after all the installments have been paid. To combat this, some jurisdictions, including Ireland, make the seller and the finance house jointly and severally liable to answer for breaches of the purchase contract.

===Implied warranties and conditions to protect the hirer===
The extent to which buyers are protected varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but the following are usually present:
#the hirer will be allowed to enjoy quiet possession of the goods, i.e. no-one will interfere with the hirer&#x27;s possession during the term of this contract
#the owner will be able to pass title to, or ownership of, the goods when the contract requires it
#that the goods are of merchantable quality and fit for their purpose, save that exclusion clauses may, to a greater or lesser extent, limit the Finance Company&#x27;s liability
#where the goods are let by reference to a description or to a sample, what is actually supplied must correspond with the description and the sample.

==The hirer&#x27;s rights==
The hirer usually has the following rights:
#To buy the goods at any time by giving notice to the owner and paying the balance of the HP price less a rebate
#To return the goods to the owner
#With the consent of the owner, to assign both the benefit and the burden of the contract to a third person. The owner cannot unreasonably refuse consent where the nominated third party has good credit rating.
#Where the owner wrongfully repossesses the goods, either to recover the goods plus damages for loss of quiet possession or to damages representing the value of the goods lost.
Each jurisdiction has a different formula for calculating the amount of the rebate. Generally, returning the goods is subject to the payment of a penalty to reflect the owner&#x27;s loss of profit but subject to a maximum specified in each jurisdiction&#x27;s law to strike a balance between the need for the buyer to minimize liability and the fact that the owner now has possession of an obsolescent asset of reduced value.

==The hirer&#x27;s obligations==

The hirer usually has the following obligations:
#to pay the hire installment
#to take reasonable care of the goods (if the hirer damages the goods by using them in a non-standard way, he or she must continue to pay the installments and if appropriate, recompense the owner for any loss in asset value)
#to inform the owner where the goods will be kept.
#A hirer can sell the products if, and only if, he/she has purchased the goods finally or else not to any other third party.

==The owner&#x27;s rights==
The owner usually has the right to terminate the agreement where the hirer defaults in paying the installments or breaches any of the other terms in the agreement. This entitles the owner:
#to forfeit the deposit
#to retain the installments already paid and recover the balance due
#to repossess the goods (which may have to be by application to a Court depending on the nature of the goods and the percentage of the total price paid)
#to claim damages for any loss suffered

==In Australia==
Hire purchases are commonly used by businesses (including companies, partnerships and sole traders) in Australia to fund the purchase of cars, commercial vehicles and other business equipment.

Under Australian Taxation Office rules, businesses who account for GST on an accruals basis are entitled to claim an Input Tax Credit for all of the GST contained in the purchase price of the goods on their next Business Activity Statement.

Hire purchase is also commonly known as &quot;commercial hire purchase&quot; and &quot;corporate hire purchase&quot; (both abbreviated to &quot;CHP&quot;) in Australia.
Hire Purchase was brought to Australia in the early 1960s by Les Meteyard and his business partner (currently unknown).

==In Malaysia==
Hire purchases agreement are commonly known as H.P agreement in Malaysia and it is used by financial institutions in Malaysia to fund the purchase of consumer goods, vehicles and other business equipment and industrial machinery.

In Malaysia, the legislation governing hire purchase transactions is the Hire Purchase Act 1967, which came into force on 11 April 1968 after hire purchase became popular in the acquisition of expensive consumer goods such as cars, business equipment and industrial machinery. Purchasing cars is the most common type of hire purchase agreement in Malaysia and the repayment could take up to 9 years from the date of agreement been executed.

<doc id="690491" wikidata="Q3810907" url="?curid=690491" title="Juan Ponce de León II">
<text>Juan Ponce de León II (1524–1591) was a Spanish official and an acting governor of Puerto Rico. He was the first acting governor to be born on the island.

==Early years==
Ponce de León II (birth name: Juan Troche Ponce de León), was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Viceroyalty of New Spain, to Juan García &quot;Gracia&quot; Troche and Juana Ponce de León. The Spanish conquistador Juan Ponce de León was Ponce de León II&#x27;s maternal grandfather.

==Settlement in Trinidad==
Ponce de León II was sent by the Spanish Crown to establish a settlement on the island of Trinidad in 1569. He founded the &quot;town of the Circumcision&quot;, probably around modern Laventille. In 1570, this settlement was abandoned, possibly because of the raids by the Caribs, which resulted in the death of Ponce de Leon&#x27;s son. According to some historians, Ponce de León II may have been an on-and-off governor of the island from 1571 to 1591.

==The first Puerto Rican acting governor of Puerto Rico==
In 1579, the Spanish Crown named Jerónimo De Agüero Campuzano governor of Puerto Rico. He was to replace the then governor Francisco De Obando Y Mexia. During the time that it took Jerónimo De Agüero Campuzano to travel from Spain to Puerto Rico, Ponce de León II was appointed acting governor. He thus became the first native-born Puerto Rican to be appointed Spanish governor of Puerto Rico.

==Written work &quot;Melgarejo&#x27;s Memoirs&quot;==
In 1581, at the request of King Philip II of Spain, Juan Lopez Melgarejo, who served as governor of Puerto Rico from 1581 to 1582, asked Juan Ponce de León II to write a general description of the West Indies with emphasis on the part corresponding to Puerto Rico. He did this with the collaboration of his fellow Puerto Rican Antonio de Santa Clara. Ponce de León II&#x27;s written work &quot;Memorias de Melgarejo&quot; (Melgarejo&#x27;s Memoirs) is one of Puerto Rico&#x27;s most important historical documents. In 1581, Ponce de León II was able to establish the exact geographical coordinates of San Juan by observing an eclipse.

==Later years==

Later in life, after he became a widower, Ponce de León II embraced and lived a religious life. He took it upon himself to transfer the body of his grandfather, Juan Ponce de León, to San José Church in San Juan from Cuba, where he had died and been buried in 1521 after being wounded in an attempt to colonize Florida. His grandfather&#x27;s remains were moved once again in 1913, when they were transferred to the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista, which is also located in Old San Juan.

Juan Ponce de León II&#x27;s remains are still interred at San José Church in San Juan. Puerto Rico has honored his memory by naming a high school in the town of Florida, Puerto Rico after him.

<doc id="690495" wikidata="Q662857" url="?curid=690495" title="Radial artery">
<text>In human anatomy, the radial artery is the main artery of the lateral aspect of the forearm.

==Structure==
The radial artery arises from the bifurcation of the brachial artery in the antecubital fossa. It runs distally on the anterior part of the forearm. There, it serves as a landmark for the division between the anterior and posterior compartments of the forearm, with the posterior compartment beginning just lateral to the artery. The artery winds laterally around the wrist, passing through the anatomical snuff box and between the heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle. It passes anteriorly between the heads of the adductor pollicis, and becomes the deep palmar arch, which joins with the deep branch of the ulnar artery.

Along its course, it is accompanied by a similarly named vein, the radial vein.

===Branches===
The named branches of the radial artery may be divided into three groups, corresponding with the three regions in which the vessel is situated.

====In the forearm====
* Radial recurrent artery - arises just after the radial artery comes off the brachial artery. It travels superiorly to anastomose with the radial collateral artery around the elbow joint
* Palmar carpal branch of radial artery - a small vessel which arises near the lower border of the pronator quadratus
* Superficial palmar branch of the radial artery - arises from the radial artery, just where this vessel is about to wind around the lateral side of the wrist.

====At the wrist====
* Dorsal carpal branch of radial artery - a small vessel which arises beneath the extensor tendons of the thumb
* First dorsal metacarpal artery - arises just before the radial artery passes between the two heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle and divides almost immediately into two branches which supply the adjacent sides of the thumb and index finger; the lateral side of the thumb receives a branch directly from the radial artery.

====In the hand====
* Princeps pollicis artery - arises from the radial artery just as it turns medially to the deep part of the hand.
* Radialis indicis - arises close to the princeps pollicis. The two arteries may arise from a common trunk, the first palmar metacarpal artery.
* Deep palmar arch - terminal part of radial artery.

=== Variations ===
In less than 1% of the population, the radial artery takes a superficial course in the anatomical snuff box. This arterial variation can be mistaken for the cephalic vein as accidental injection of this variant radial artery has been reported. Identifying arterial pulsation in the anatomical snuff box is therefore recommended.

==Clinical significance ==
The radial artery lies superficially in front of the distal end of the radius, between the tendons of the brachioradialis and flexor carpi radialis; it is here that clinician takes the radial pulse. (where it is commonly used to assess the heart rate and cardiac rhythm). Presence of &quot;radial pulse&quot; was thought to indicate a systolic blood pressure of at least 70 mmHg, as estimated from the 50% percentile, although this was found to generally be an overestimation of a patient&#x27;s true blood pressure.
The radial artery can be less easily felt as it crosses the anatomical snuff box.
The radial artery is used for coronary artery bypass grafting and is growing in popularity among cardiac surgeons. Recently, it has been shown to have a superior peri-operative and post-operative course when compared to saphenous vein grafts.

The radial artery is often punctured in a common procedure to obtain an arterial blood gas. Such a procedure may first involve an Allen&#x27;s test.

The radial artery is also used to evaluate the collateral circulation of blood through the hands; applying pressure through palpating the palmar arches results in paleness over the area being compressed; adequate collateral circulation can be ascertained by how quickly normal colour returns after the pressure is removed.

The radial artery is a common site for the insertion of an arterial line, such as for blood pressure monitoring in an intensive care unit. It is also commonly used for cerebral angiograms for the treatment of cerebral pathologies, such as strokes, cerebral aneurysms It is selected because it is accessible, and because of the low incidence of complications such as thrombosis.

<doc id="690506" wikidata="Q1032558" url="?curid=690506" title="Canal Street (Manhattan)">
<text>Canal Street is a major east–west street of over in Lower Manhattan, New York City, United States, running from East Broadway between Essex and Jefferson Streets in the east, to West Street between Watts and Spring Streets in the west. It runs through the neighborhood of Chinatown, and forms the southern boundaries of SoHo and Little Italy as well as the northern boundary of Tribeca. The street acts as a major connector between Jersey City, New Jersey, via the Holland Tunnel (I-78), and Brooklyn in New York City via the Manhattan Bridge. It is a two-way street for most of its length, with two unidirectional stretches between Forsyth Street and the Manhattan Bridge.

==History==
By 1800, Collect Pond, one of New York City&#x27;s few natural sources of fresh water, had become completely polluted with sewage and run-off from the tanneries, breweries, and other workshops and factories around it. Run-off from the pond, including one &quot;sluggish stream&quot; which traveled part of the route of the future Canal Street, fed nearby swamps and marshes which prevented the city from continuing its northward growth. To deal with this, the city&#x27;s Common Council ordered that the swamps be drained and, in 1803, that the pond itself be filled in. A drain was built continuing the path of the &quot;sluggish stream&quot; to the Hudson River, which redirected the underground springs which watered the swamps. The pond was successfully drained by 1813 or 1815.


The area was developed, but the springs remained and caused the &quot;dry&quot; land to be boggy and uneven. The Common Council then authorized a canal, in the form of a 40-foot wide, 8-foot deep ditch, which would continue carrying off the excess water. Because it was not efficient, and did not have sufficient flow, it, too, became an open sewer. The city covered it over in 1819, but as it had no air traps, the covered canal became a stinking covered sewer. Canal Street was completed in 1820, following the path of the covered canal and named for it. The historic townhouses and newer tenements that had been built along Canal Street quickly fell into disrepair, and the eastern stretch of Canal Street came within the ambit of the notorious Five Points slum as property values and living conditions plummeted.

Early in the 20th century, the jewelry trade centered on the corner of Canal Street and Bowery, but moved mid century to the modern Diamond District on 47th Street. In the 1920s, the Citizens Savings Bank built a notable domed headquarters at the intersection&#x27;s southwest corner which remains a local landmark. The portion of Canal Street around Sixth Avenue was New York&#x27;s principal market for electronics parts for a quarter-century after the closing of Radio Row to make way for the building of the World Trade Center.

===Reputation as hawkers&#x27; haven===
Canal Street is a bustling commercial district, crowded with comparatively low-rent open storefronts, and street vendors to the west; banks and jewelry shops to the east. For a generation after World War II, the former segment hosted many stores selling exotic high-tech components to would-be inventors and engineers. Canal Street is also the main Chinese jewelry business district of Chinatown. Tourists as well as locals pack its sidewalks every day to frequent the open-air stalls and bare-bones stores selling items such as perfume, purses, hardware, and industrial plastics at low prices. Many of these goods are grey market imports and many notoriously counterfeit, with fake trademarked brand names on electronics, clothing and personal accessories (including the fake Rolex watches that have become a Manhattan cliché). Bootleg CDs and DVDs were common, and were offered for sale on Canal Street—often before they were even officially released in stores or the theater—in makeshift stands and suitcases or simply laid out on bedsheets.

Widespread sale of these counterfeit goods persists along Canal Street and in its hidden back rooms despite frequent police raids. In addition, legislation was proposed in 2013 to try to make purchasing counterfeit items a crime; this would let the city&#x27;s economy earn back at least $1 billion annually in taxes.

===9/11 attack===
After the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center in 2001, Canal Street was the northern-most boundary of the area initially closed to everyone but residents and emergency personnel. When the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund was established, Canal Street was again the northern cut-off for the World Trade Center Exposure Zone.

== Transportation ==
Canal Street is served by the New York City Subway at seven stations, west to east:

*Canal Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line) at Varick Street, served by the 
*Canal Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line) at Sixth Avenue, served by the 
*Canal Street (BMT Broadway, Manhattan Bridge, and Nassau Street Lines, and IRT Lexington Avenue Line) at Broadway, Lafayette Street, and Centre Street, served by the at four separate sets of platforms
*East Broadway (IND Sixth Avenue Line) at East Broadway, served by the 

Canal Street is also served by the New York City Bus system, though no routes actually run on Canal Street. Routes intersecting with the street include M20 at Hudson Street (northbound) and at Varick Street (southbound); M55 at Sixth Avenue (northbound) and Broadway (southbound); M103 at Bowery; M15/M15 SBS at Allen Street; and M9 at Essex/Rutgers Streets.

<text>Liquid Television was an animation showcase broadcast on MTV from 1991 to 1995. It launched several high-profile original cartoons, including &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot; and &quot;Æon Flux&quot;. Other recurring segments include &quot;The Art School Girls of Doom&quot;, &quot;The Specialists&quot;, and &quot;Brad Dharma: Psychedelic Detective&quot;. Independent animators and artists created most of the material specifically for the show, and some previously produced segments were compiled from festivals such as Spike and Mike&#x27;s Festival of Animation. 

The first season of &quot;Liquid Television&quot; also aired on BBC Two in co-production with MTV. Ultimately, MTV commissioned three seasons of the show, produced by Colossal Pictures. The show was eventually succeeded by &quot;Cartoon Sushi&quot;. Mark Mothersbaugh composed the theme music. 

The show was broadcast in Canada on MuchMusic, in Asia on Channel V, in Australia on SBS and in New Zealand on TV3.

==History==
Many animation pieces were adapted from Art Spiegelman&#x27;s comic compilation, &quot;RAW&quot;. &quot;RAW&quot; features underground cartoonists such as Mark Beyer, Richard Sala, and Peter Bagge. In particular, &quot;Dog-Boy&quot; by Charles Burns was based on the artist&#x27;s series from &quot;RAW&quot;.

Due to the extensive use of licensed music throughout the series (many episodes begin with a contemporary music video being &quot;liquified&quot;), full episodes of &quot;Liquid Television&quot; have not been broadcast since their original run. Selected segments from the series, including the debut of &quot;Æon Flux&quot;, were released on two VHS tapes in the late 1990s as &quot;The Best of Liquid Television&quot;. A collection volume, &quot;Wet Shorts (The Best of Liquid Television)&quot;, with the content of the two VHS tapes, was released on DVD in 1997.

<text>The Akaike information criterion (AIC) is an estimator of prediction error and thereby relative quality of statistical models for a given set of data. Given a collection of models for the data, AIC estimates the quality of each model, relative to each of the other models. Thus, AIC provides a means for model selection.

AIC is founded on information theory. When a statistical model is used to represent the process that generated the data, the representation will almost never be exact; so some information will be lost by using the model to represent the process. AIC estimates the relative amount of information lost by a given model: the less information a model loses, the higher the quality of that model.

In estimating the amount of information lost by a model, AIC deals with the trade-off between the goodness of fit of the model and the simplicity of the model. In other words, AIC deals with both the risk of overfitting and the risk of underfitting.

The Akaike information criterion is named after the Japanese statistician Hirotugu Akaike, who formulated it. It now forms the basis of a paradigm for the foundations of statistics and is also widely used for statistical inference.

==Definition==
Suppose that we have a statistical model of some data. Let be the number of estimated parameters in the model. Let formula_1 be the maximized value of the likelihood function for the model. Then the AIC value of the model is the following.

:formula_2

Given a set of candidate models for the data, the preferred model is the one with the minimum AIC value. Thus, AIC rewards goodness of fit (as assessed by the likelihood function), but it also includes a penalty that is an increasing function of the number of estimated parameters. The penalty discourages overfitting, which is desired because increasing the number of parameters in the model almost always improves the goodness of the fit.

AIC is founded in information theory. Suppose that the data is generated by some unknown process &quot;f&quot;. We consider two candidate models to represent &quot;f&quot;: &quot;g&quot;1 and &quot;g&quot;2. If we knew &quot;f&quot;, then we could find the information lost from using &quot;g&quot;1 to represent &quot;f&quot; by calculating the Kullback–Leibler divergence, ; similarly, the information lost from using &quot;g&quot;2 to represent &quot;f&quot; could be found by calculating . We would then, generally, choose the candidate model that minimized the information loss.

We cannot choose with certainty, because we do not know &quot;f&quot;. showed, however, that we can estimate, via AIC, how much more (or less) information is lost by &quot;g&quot;1 than by &quot;g&quot;2. The estimate, though, is only valid asymptotically; if the number of data points is small, then some correction is often necessary (see AICc, below).

Note that AIC tells nothing about the absolute quality of a model, only the quality relative to other models. Thus, if all the candidate models fit poorly, AIC will not give any warning of that. Hence, after selecting a model via AIC, it is usually good practice to validate the absolute quality of the model. Such validation commonly includes checks of the model&#x27;s residuals (to determine whether the residuals seem like random) and tests of the model&#x27;s predictions. For more on this topic, see &quot;statistical model validation&quot;.

==How to use AIC in practice==
To apply AIC in practice, we start with a set of candidate models, and then find the models&#x27; corresponding AIC values. There will almost always be information lost due to using a candidate model to represent the &quot;true model,&quot; i.e. the process that generated the data. We wish to select, from among the candidate models, the model that minimizes the information loss. We cannot choose with certainty, but we can minimize the estimated information loss.

Suppose that there are &quot;R&quot; candidate models. Denote the AIC values of those models by AIC1, AIC2, AIC3, ..., AIC&quot;R&quot;. Let AICmin be the minimum of those values. Then the quantity exp((AICmin − AIC&quot;i&quot;)/2) can be interpreted as being proportional to the probability that the &quot;i&quot;th model minimizes the (estimated) information loss.

As an example, suppose that there are three candidate models, whose AIC values are 100, 102, and 110. Then the second model is times as probable as the first model to minimize the information loss. Similarly, the third model is times as probable as the first model to minimize the information loss.

In this example, we would omit the third model from further consideration. We then have three options: (1) gather more data, in the hope that this will allow clearly distinguishing between the first two models; (2) simply conclude that the data is insufficient to support selecting one model from among the first two; (3) take a weighted average of the first two models, with weights proportional to 1 and 0.368, respectively, and then do statistical inference based on the weighted multimodel.

The quantity is known as the &quot;relative likelihood&quot; of model &quot;i&quot;. It is closely related to the likelihood ratio used in the likelihood-ratio test. Indeed, if all the models in the candidate set have the same number of parameters, then using AIC might at first appear to be very similar to using the likelihood-ratio test. There are, however, important distinctions. In particular, the likelihood-ratio test is valid only for nested models, whereas AIC (and AICc) has no such restriction.

==Hypothesis testing==
Every statistical hypothesis test can be formulated as a comparison of statistical models. Hence, every statistical hypothesis test can be replicated via AIC. Two examples are briefly described in the subsections below. Details for those examples, and many more examples, are given by and .

===Replicating Student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-test===
As an example of a hypothesis test, consider the &quot;t&quot;-test to compare the means of two normally-distributed populations. The input to the &quot;t&quot;-test comprises a random sample from each of the two populations.

To formulate the test as a comparison of models, we construct two different models. The first model models the two populations as having potentially different means and standard deviations. The likelihood function for the first model is thus the product of the likelihoods for two distinct normal distributions; so it has four parameters: . To be explicit, the likelihood function is as follows (denoting the sample sizes by and ).

:formula_3
:formula_4

The second model models the two populations as having the same means and the same standard deviations. The likelihood function for the second model thus sets and in the above equation; so it only has two parameters.

We then maximize the likelihood functions for the two models (in practice, we maximize the log-likelihood functions); after that, it is easy to calculate the AIC values of the models. We next calculate the relative likelihood. For instance, if the second model was only 0.01 times as likely as the first model, then we would omit the second model from further consideration: so we would conclude that the two populations have different means.

The &quot;t&quot;-test assumes that the two populations have identical standard deviations; the test tends to be unreliable if the assumption is false and the sizes of the two samples are very different (Welch&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-test would be better). Comparing the means of the populations via AIC, as in the example above, has the same disadvantage. However, one could create a third model that allows different standard deviations. This third model would have the advantage of not making such assumptions at the cost of an additional parameter and thus degree of freedom.

===Comparing categorical data sets===
For another example of a hypothesis test, suppose that we have two populations, and each member of each population is in one of two categories—category #1 or category #2. Each population is binomially distributed. We want to know whether the distributions of the two populations are the same. We are given a random sample from each of the two populations.

Let be the size of the sample from the first population. Let be the number of observations (in the sample) in category #1; so the number of observations in category #2 is . Similarly, let be the size of the sample from the second population. Let be the number of observations (in the sample) in category #1.

Let be the probability that a randomly-chosen member of the first population is in category #1. Hence, the probability that a randomly-chosen member of the first population is in category #2 is . Note that the distribution of the first population has one parameter. Let be the probability that a randomly-chosen member of the second population is in category #1. Note that the distribution of the second population also has one parameter.

To compare the distributions of the two populations, we construct two different models. The first model models the two populations as having potentially different distributions. The likelihood function for the first model is thus the product of the likelihoods for two distinct binomial distributions; so it has two parameters: , . To be explicit, the likelihood function is as follows.

:formula_5

The second model models the two populations as having the same distribution. The likelihood function for the second model thus sets in the above equation; so the second model has one parameter.

We then maximize the likelihood functions for the two models (in practice, we maximize the log-likelihood functions); after that, it is easy to calculate the AIC values of the models. We next calculate the relative likelihood. For instance, if the second model was only 0.01 times as likely as the first model, then we would omit the second model from further consideration: so we would conclude that the two populations have different distributions.

==Foundations of statistics==
Statistical inference is generally regarded as comprising hypothesis testing and estimation. Hypothesis testing can be done via AIC, as discussed above. Regarding estimation, there are two types: point estimation and interval estimation. Point estimation can be done within the AIC paradigm: it is provided by maximum likelihood estimation. Interval estimation can also be done within the AIC paradigm: it is provided by likelihood intervals. Hence, statistical inference generally can be done within the AIC paradigm.

The most commonly used paradigms for statistical inference are frequentist inference and Bayesian inference. AIC, though, can be used to do statistical inference without relying on either the frequentist paradigm or the Bayesian paradigm: because AIC can be interpreted without the aid of significance levels or Bayesian priors. In other words, AIC can be used to form a foundation of statistics that is distinct from both frequentism and Bayesianism.

==Modification for small sample size==
When the sample size is small, there is a substantial probability that AIC will select models that have too many parameters, i.e. that AIC will overfit. To address such potential overfitting, AICc was developed: AICc is AIC with a correction for small sample sizes.

The formula for AICc depends upon the statistical model. Assuming that the model is univariate, is linear in its parameters, and has normally-distributed residuals (conditional upon regressors), then the formula for AICc is as follows.

:formula_6

—where denotes the sample size and denotes the number of parameters. Thus, AICc is essentially AIC with an extra penalty term for the number of parameters. Note that as , the extra penalty term converges to 0, and thus AICc converges to AIC.

If the assumption that the model is univariate and linear with normal residuals does not hold, then the formula for AICc will generally be different from the formula above. For some models, the formula can be difficult to determine. For every model that has AICc available, though, the formula for AICc is given by AIC plus terms that includes both and 2. In comparison, the formula for AIC includes but not 2. In other words, AIC is a first-order estimate (of the information loss), whereas AICc is a second-order estimate.

Further discussion of the formula, with examples of other assumptions, is given by and by . In particular, with other assumptions, bootstrap estimation of the formula is often feasible.

To summarize, AICc has the advantage of tending to be more accurate than AIC (especially for small samples), but AICc also has the disadvantage of sometimes being much more difficult to compute than AIC. Note that if all the candidate models have the same and the same formula for AICc, then AICc and AIC will give identical (relative) valuations; hence, there will be no disadvantage in using AIC, instead of AICc. Furthermore, if is many times larger than 2, then the extra penalty term will be negligible; hence, the disadvantage in using AIC, instead of AICc, will be negligible.

==History==

The Akaike information criterion was formulated by the statistician Hirotugu Akaike. It was originally named &quot;an information criterion&quot;. It was first announced in English by Akaike at a 1971 symposium; the proceedings of the symposium were published in 1973. The 1973 publication, though, was only an informal presentation of the concepts. The first formal publication was a 1974 paper by Akaike.

The initial derivation of AIC relied upon some strong assumptions. showed that the assumptions could be made much weaker. Takeuchi&#x27;s work, however, was in Japanese and was not widely known outside Japan for many years. (Translated in )

AIC was originally proposed for linear regression (only) by . That instigated the work of , and several further papers by the same authors, which extended the situations in which AICc could be applied.

The first general exposition of the information-theoretic approach was the volume by . It includes an English presentation of the work of Takeuchi. The volume led to far greater use of AIC, and it now has more than 64,000 citations on Google Scholar.

Akaike called his approach an &quot;entropy maximization principle&quot;, because the approach is founded on the concept of entropy in information theory. Indeed, minimizing AIC in a statistical model is effectively equivalent to maximizing entropy in a thermodynamic system; in other words, the information-theoretic approach in statistics is essentially applying the second law of thermodynamics. As such, AIC has roots in the work of Ludwig Boltzmann on entropy. For more on these issues, see and .

==Usage tips==

===Counting parameters===
A statistical model must account for random errors. A straight line model might be formally described as &quot;y&quot;&quot;i&quot; = &quot;b&quot;0 + &quot;b&quot;1&quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot; + &quot;ε&quot;&quot;i&quot;. Here, the &quot;ε&quot;&quot;i&quot; are the residuals from the straight line fit. If the &quot;ε&quot;&quot;i&quot; are assumed to be i.i.d. Gaussian (with zero mean), then the model has three parameters:
&quot;b&quot;0, &quot;b&quot;1, and the variance of the Gaussian distributions.
Thus, when calculating the AIC value of this model, we should use &quot;k&quot;=3. More generally, for any least squares model with i.i.d. Gaussian residuals, the variance of the residuals&#x27; distributions should be counted as one of the parameters.

As another example, consider a first-order autoregressive model, defined by
&quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot; = &quot;c&quot; + &quot;φx&quot;&quot;i&quot;−1 + &quot;ε&quot;&quot;i&quot;, with the &quot;ε&quot;&quot;i&quot; being i.i.d. Gaussian (with zero mean). For this model, there are three parameters: &quot;c&quot;, &quot;φ&quot;, and the variance of the &quot;ε&quot;&quot;i&quot;. More generally, a &quot;p&quot;th-order autoregressive model has parameters. (If, however, &quot;c&quot; is not estimated from the data, but instead given in advance, then there are only parameters.)

===Transforming data===
The AIC values of the candidate models must all be computed with the same data set. Sometimes, though, we might want to compare a model of the response variable, , with a model of the logarithm of the response variable, . More generally, we might want to compare a model of the data with a model of transformed data. Following is an illustration of how to deal with data transforms (adapted from : &quot;Investigators should be sure that all hypotheses are modeled using the same response variable&quot;).

Suppose that we want to compare two models: one with a normal distribution of and one with a normal distribution of . We should &quot;not&quot; directly compare the AIC values of the two models. Instead, we should transform the normal cumulative distribution function to first take the logarithm of . To do that, we need to perform the relevant integration by substitution: thus, we need to multiply by the derivative of the (natural) logarithm function, which is . Hence, the transformed distribution has the following probability density function:
: formula_7
—which is the probability density function for the log-normal distribution. We then compare the AIC value of the normal model against the AIC value of the log-normal model.

For misspecified model, Takeuchi&#x27;s Information Criterion (TIC) might be more appropriate. However, TIC often suffers from instability caused by estimation errors.

==Comparisons with other model selection methods==

The critical difference between AIC and BIC (and their variants) is the asymptotic property under well-specified and misspecified model classes. Their fundamental differences have been well-studied in regression variable selection and autoregression order selection problems. In general, if the goal is prediction, AIC and leave-one-out cross-validations are preferred. If the goal is selection, inference, or interpretation, BIC or leave-many-out cross-validations are preferred. A comprehensive overview of AIC and other popular model selection methods is given by Ding et al. (2018)

===Comparison with BIC===
The formula for the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) is similar to the formula for AIC, but with a different penalty for the number of parameters. With AIC the penalty is , whereas with BIC the penalty is .

A comparison of AIC/AICc and BIC is given by , with follow-up remarks by . The authors show that AIC/AICc can be derived in the same Bayesian framework as BIC, just by using different prior probabilities. In the Bayesian derivation of BIC, though, each candidate model has a prior probability of 1/&quot;R&quot; (where &quot;R&quot; is the number of candidate models). Additionally, the authors present a few simulation studies that suggest AICc tends to have practical/performance advantages over BIC.

A point made by several researchers is that AIC and BIC are appropriate for different tasks. In particular, BIC is argued to be appropriate for selecting the &quot;true model&quot; (i.e. the process that generated the data) from the set of candidate models, whereas AIC is not appropriate. To be specific, if the &quot;true model&quot; is in the set of candidates, then BIC will select the &quot;true model&quot; with probability 1, as ; in contrast, when selection is done via AIC, the probability can be less than 1. Proponents of AIC argue that this issue is negligible, because the &quot;true model&quot; is virtually never in the candidate set. Indeed, it is a common aphorism in statistics that &quot;all models are wrong&quot;; hence the &quot;true model&quot; (i.e. reality) cannot be in the candidate set.

Another comparison of AIC and BIC is given by . Vrieze presents a simulation study—which allows the &quot;true model&quot; to be in the candidate set (unlike with virtually all real data). The simulation study demonstrates, in particular, that AIC sometimes selects a much better model than BIC even when the &quot;true model&quot; is in the candidate set. The reason is that, for finite , BIC can have a substantial risk of selecting a very bad model from the candidate set. This reason can arise even when is much larger than 2. With AIC, the risk of selecting a very bad model is minimized.

If the &quot;true model&quot; is not in the candidate set, then the most that we can hope to do is select the model that best approximates the &quot;true model&quot;. AIC is appropriate for finding the best approximating model, under certain assumptions. (Those assumptions include, in particular, that the approximating is done with regard to information loss.)

Comparison of AIC and BIC in the context of regression is given by . In regression, AIC is asymptotically optimal for selecting the model with the least mean squared error, under the assumption that the &quot;true model&quot; is not in the candidate set. BIC is not asymptotically optimal under the assumption. Yang additionally shows that the rate at which AIC converges to the optimum is, in a certain sense, the best possible.

===Comparison with least squares===
Sometimes, each candidate model assumes that the residuals are distributed according to independent identical normal distributions (with zero mean). That gives rise to least squares model fitting.

With least squares fitting, the maximum likelihood estimate for the variance of a model&#x27;s residuals distributions is
:formula_8,
where the residual sum of squares is 
:formula_9
Then, the maximum value of a model&#x27;s log-likelihood function is (see Normal distribution#Log-likelihood): 
: formula_10
where is a constant independent of the model, and dependent only on the particular data points, i.e. it does not change if the data does not change.

That gives:
:formula_11
Because only differences in AIC are meaningful, the constant can be ignored, which allows us to conveniently take the following for model comparisons:
:formula_12
Note that if all the models have the same , then selecting the model with minimum AIC is equivalent to selecting the model with minimum —which is the usual objective of model selection based on least squares.

===Comparison with cross-validation===
Leave-one-out cross-validation is asymptotically equivalent to AIC, for ordinary linear regression models. Asymptotic equivalence to AIC also holds for mixed-effects models.

===Comparison with Mallows&#x27;s &quot;Cp&quot;===
Mallows&#x27;s &quot;Cp&quot; is equivalent to AIC in the case of (Gaussian) linear regression.

<doc id="690514" wikidata="Q317799" url="?curid=690514" title="Ahmad Shah Qajar">
<text>Ahmad Shah Qajar (‎; 21 January 1898 – 21 February 1930) was the shah of Iran (Persia) from 16 July 1909 to 15 December 1925, and the last ruling member of the Qajar dynasty.

Ahmad Shah was born in Tabriz on 21 January 1898 and ascended the throne at the age of 12 after the removal of his father Mohammad Ali Shah by the Parliament on 16 July 1909. Due to his young age, his uncle, Ali-Reza Khan, took charge of state affairs as Regent. Upon reaching the age of majority, Ahmad Shah was formally crowned on 21 July 1914.

==Reign==
On 16 July 1909, Mohammad Ali Shah was overthrown by rebels seeking to restore the 1906 Constitution. The rebels then convened the Grand Majles of 500 delegates from different backgrounds, which placed Ahmad Shah, Mohammad Ali&#x27;s eleven-year-old son, on the Sun Throne.

The Grand Majlis enacted many reforms. They abolished class representation and created five new seats in the Majlis for minorities: two seats for Armenians, and one seat each for Jews, Zoroastrians, and Assyrians. The Majles also democratized the electoral system, diminished the electoral dominance of Tehran, and even lowered the voting age from twenty-five to twenty.

Not much is known about Ahmad&#x27;s early life before his succession to the throne. Due to his young age, his uncle, Ali Reza Khan Azod al-Molk, governed as regent.

Ahmad Shah was formally crowned on 21 July 1914, upon reaching his majority. He attempted to fix the damage done by his father by appointing the best ministers he could find. He was, however, an ineffective ruler who was faced with internal unrest and foreign intrusions, particularly by the British Empire and Russian Empire. Russian and British troops fought against the Ottoman Empire forces in Iran during World War I. 

The Second Majlis convened in November 1910 and just like the First Majlis, did not lead to any relevant accomplishment. The Majlis was rendered ineffective because the central government was weak and did not have enough influence to rein in the changes that it had proposed.

In 1917, Britain used Iran as the springboard for an attack into Russia in an unsuccessful attempt to reverse the Russian Revolution of 1917. The newly born Soviet Union responded by annexing portions of northern Persia as buffer states much like its Tsarist predecessor. Marching on Tehran, the Soviets extracted ever more humiliating concessions from the Iranian government – whose ministers Ahmad Shah was often unable to control. The weakness of the government in the face of such aggression by an atheist foreign power sparked seething anger among many traditional Iranians – including the young Ruhollah Khomeini, who would later condemn both Communism and monarchy as treason against Iran&#x27;s sovereignty and the laws of Islam.

By 1920, the government had virtually lost all power outside the capital and Ahmad Shah had lost control of the situation. Ahmad Shah has also been described as &quot;pleasure-loving, effete, and incompetent&quot;. The Anglo-Persian Agreement, along with new political parties, further immobilized the country. The Moderates and Democrats often clashed, particularly when it came to minority rights and secularism. The debates between the two political parties led to violence and even assassinations.

The weak economic state of Iran put Ahmad Shah and his government at the mercy of foreign influence; they had to obtain loans from the Imperial Bank of Persia. Furthermore, under the Anglo-Persian Agreement, Iran received only a small fraction of the income generated by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. On the other hand, the Red Army along with rebels and warlords ruled much of the countryside.

On 21 February 1921, Ahmad Shah was pushed aside in a military coup by Colonel Reza Khan, Minister of War and commander of the Persian Cossack Brigade, who subsequently seized the post of Prime Minister. During the coup, Reza Khan used three thousand men and only eighteen machine guns, a very bloodless coup that moved forward quickly. One of Khan&#x27;s first actions was to rescind the unpopular Anglo-Persian Agreement. In addition, he signed the Russo-Persian Treaty of Friendship. This agreement canceled all previous treaties between the two countries and also gave Persia full and equal shipping rights in the Caspian Sea.

Stripped of all his remaining powers, Ahmad Shah went into exile with his family in 1923. Ahmad Shah&#x27;s apparent lack of interest in attending to the affairs of the state and poor health had prompted him to leave Iran on an extended trip to Europe. He was formally deposed on 31 October 1925, when Reza Khan was proclaimed Shah by the Majlis, as Reza Shah Pahlavi. This terminated the Qajar dynasty.

== Exile and death ==
The coup of 1921 rendered Ahmad Shah politically weaker and less relevant. In 1923, Ahmad Shah left Iran for Europe for health reasons. Later, the formal termination of the Qajar dynasty by the Majles turned Ahmad Shah&#x27;s 1923 European tour into exile.

Ahmad Shah died in 1930 at Neuilly-sur-Seine, outside Paris, France, and was buried in his family crypt in Karbala, Iraq. His brother, former crown prince Mohammad Hassan Mirza, assured the continuation of the dynasty through his descendants. French publications at the time reported that his estate was worth some seventy-five million francs.

==Personal life==
Ahmad Shah Qajar married five times. His first wife was Lydia Jahanbani. He had four children, each by a different wife.
* Princess Maryamdokht (1915 – November 10, 2005), daughter of Delaram Khanum
* Princess Irandokht (1916–1984), daughter of Princess Badr al-Molouk Vala
* Princess Homayoundokht (1917–2011), daughter of Princess Khanum Khanumha Moezzi
* Prince Fereydoun Mirza (1922 – September 24, 1975), son of Fatemeh Khanum

He had 12 grandchildren, who respectively carry the last names Albertini, Faroughy, Panahi and Qajar (also spelled Kadjar).

<doc id="690522" wikidata="Q5305993" url="?curid=690522" title="Draw play">
<text>A draw play, or simply draw for short, is a type of American football play. The draw is a running play disguised as a passing play. It is the opposite of a play-action pass, which is a passing play disguised as a running play. The play is often used in long yardage situations.

The idea behind a draw play is to attack aggressive, pass-rushing defenses by &quot;drawing&quot; the defensive linemen across the line of scrimmage towards the passer while the linebackers and defensive backs commit to positioning themselves downfield in anticipation of a pass. This creates larger gaps between defenders and thereby allows the offense to effectively run the ball. Draw plays are often run out of the shotgun formation, but can also be run when the quarterback is under center. These types of draw plays are sometimes referred to as &quot;delayed handoffs&quot;.

The running back will most often run straight downfield through the hole in the &quot;A-gap&quot; (the space between the center and the offensive guard), although there are more complicated variations. The most common variation of this play is the &quot;quarterback draw,&quot; where the quarterback himself runs the ball, instead of handing it off, meaning the running back is free to help block.

==History==
The history of who came up with the draw play is disputed. One idea is that it arose from necessity in the late 1940s when Packers linebacker Buckets Goldenberg noticed a different stance on plays dropping back from center to pass in the Bears T formation with quarterback Sid Luckman and thus adjusted to go with persistent blitz or not. Bears center Bulldog Turner supposedly suggested to do a fake dropback that would go for a run. The draw was also allegedly invented by the Cleveland Browns during their years in the All-America Football Conference. A botched play, originally designed to be a pass play, caused quarterback Otto Graham to improvise a hand-off to fullback Marion Motley. A surprised Motley, who had been expecting to block on the play, instead ran for a big gain. Coach Paul Brown noted the success of the improvised play and began to work it in as a regular play, quickly creating four different versions of it. By 1950, the term began appearing in print among various places such as Rice vs North Carolina in the 1950 Cotton Bowl Classic.

==Maneuvers==
;Offensive movement during a draw play
*The quarterback drops back to pass, just long enough to get the pass rush to come upfield.
*The offensive linemen momentarily show pass block, but also try to push the defenders to the outside, creating a crease in the middle.
*The running back momentarily fakes as if he is staying in to help pass protect, then takes the hand-off from the quarterback and heads downfield through the crease created by the linemen.
*The receivers run clear-out routes downfield in order to take the defensive backs out of the play.

<text>Richard Walther Darré (born Ricardo Walther Óscar Darré; 14 July 1895 – 5 September 1953) was one of the leading Nazi &quot;blood and soil&quot; () ideologists and served as Reich Minister of Food and Agriculture. As the National leader () for agricultural policy, he was a high-ranking functionary in the Nazi Party and as a Senior group leader () in the SS, he was the seventh most senior commander in that organisation. He was tried and found guilty on three counts at the Ministries Trial.

==Early life==
Darré was born in Belgrano, a Buenos Aires neighbourhood in Argentina, to Richard Oscar Darré, a German with Huguenot ancestry (born 10 March 1854, Berlin; died 20 February 1929, Wiesbaden) and Emilia Berta Eleonore, née Lagergren (born 23 July 1872 in Buenos Aires to a Swedish-born father and German-born mother; died 20 July 1936 in Bad Pyrmont). His father moved to Argentina in 1888 as a partner of the German international import/export wholesaler Engelbert Hardt &amp; Co. His parents&#x27; marriage was not a happy one; Richard Walther remembered his father as &quot;a hard drinker and a womaniser&quot;. They lived prosperously and educated their children privately, until they were forced to return to Germany as a result of worsening international relations in the years preceding World War I. Darré gained fluency in four languages: Spanish, German, English, and French.

Darré&#x27;s parents sent him to Germany at age nine to attend school in Heidelberg. In 1911, he attended King&#x27;s College School in Wimbledon as an exchange student. The rest of the family returned to Germany in 1912. Richard (as he was known in the family) then spent two years at the &quot;Oberrealschule&quot; in Gummersbach, followed in early 1914 by the &quot;Kolonialschule&quot; for resettlement in the German colonies at Witzenhausen, south of Göttingen, which awakened his interest in farming.

After a single term at Witzenhausen, he volunteered for army service. He was slightly wounded a number of times while serving during World War I.

When the war ended, he contemplated returning to Argentina for a life of farming, but the family&#x27;s weakening financial position during the years of inflation made that impossible. Instead, he returned to Witzenhausen to continue his studies. He then obtained unpaid work as a farm assistant in Pomerania. His observation of the treatment of returning German soldiers there influenced his later writings.

In 1922, he moved to the University of Halle to continue his studies. He undertook an agricultural degree, specialising in animal husbandry. He did not complete his PhD studies until 1929, at the age of 34. During those years, he spent some time working in East Prussia and Finland.

He married twice. In 1922, he married Alma Staadt, a schoolfriend of his sister Ilse. The marriage produced one daughter, Anneliese, born 1923. He and Alma divorced in 1927 and, in 1931, he married Charlotte Freiin von Vittinghoff-Schell, who survived him. The second marriage also produced one daughter, Elin, born 1938.

==Political career==
As a young man in Germany, Darré initially joined the Artaman League, a &quot;Völkisch&quot; youth-group committed to the back-to-the-land movement. In that context, he began to develop the idea of the link between the future of the Nordic race and the soil, the tendency which became known as &quot;Blut und Boden&quot; or Blood and Soil, where &quot;blood&quot; represents race and ancestry, while &quot;soil&quot; expresses the concepts of territory, land. The essence of the theory involved the mutual and long-term relationship between a people and the land that they occupy and cultivate.

Darré&#x27;s first political article (1926) discussed &quot;Internal Colonisation&quot; and argued against Germany attempting to regain its lost colonies in Africa. Most of his writing at that time, however, concentrated on technical aspects of animal breeding. He wrote his first book, &quot;Das Bauerntum als Lebensquell der nordischen Rasse&quot; (&#x27;Peasantry as the life-source of the Nordic Race&#x27;), in 1928. It asserted that German farms had previously been bestowed on one son, the strongest, ensuring the best were farmers, but partible inheritance had destroyed that. Darré demanded the restoration of the ancient tradition, as well as serious efforts to restore the purity of Nordic blood through eugenics.

In her biography of Darré, Anna Bramwell interprets his writing as an early example of &quot;Green&quot; or Conservationist thinking. He advocated more natural methods of land management, placing emphasis on the conservation of forests, and demanded more open space and air in the raising of farm animals. Other scholars, however, have challenged that view. One sees Bramwell&#x27;s books as &quot;devoid of credible evidence&quot; and containing &quot;gross errors&quot;. Another acknowledges Bramwell&#x27;s biography as &quot;undoubtedly the best single source on Darré in either German or English&quot;, while at the same time saying that she &quot;consistently downplays the virulently fascist elements in his thinking, portraying him instead as a misguided agrarian radical.&quot;

Those who heard and heeded Darré&#x27;s arguments included Heinrich Himmler, himself one of the Artaman. 

Darré&#x27;s work also glorified &quot;peasant virtues&quot; – as found in the remnants of the Nordics who lived in the country – and disparaged city living. 

In his two major works, he defined the German peasantry as a homogeneous racial group of Nordic antecedents, who formed the cultural and racial core of the German nation, and promoted the idea that since the Nordic birth-rate was lower than that of other races, the Nordic race was under a long-term threat of extinction.

=== Nazi Party member ===
In July 1930, after Paul Schultze-Naumburg had introduced him to Adolf Hitler, Darré joined the Nazi Party (# 248,256) and the SS (# 6,882).
On 1 January 1932, the chief of the SS (&quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot;) Himmler appointed him chief of the newly established SS Race and Settlement Main Office, a racist and antisemitic organization concerned with the implementation of racial policies and the control of the racial integrity of SS members. In 1932 Darré was given the rank of SS-Group leader (SS-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot;) and in November 1934 he was promoted to SS-Senior group leader (SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot;).
During the 1932 presidential election, Darré engaged in a campaign of anti-Semitic harassment against Theodor Duesterberg, the candidate of the conservative German National People&#x27;s Party, who, it emerged during the campaign, was the grandson of a Jewish convert to Lutheranism. Duesterberg was so wounded by Darré&#x27;s attacks that he challenged him to a duel, a challenge that Darré declined under the grounds that it was beneath him to fight a man with &quot;Jewish blood&quot;. Duesterberg then took up his dispute with Darré before the court of honor of the Former Officers of the 1st Hanoverian Field Artillery Regiment of Scharnhorst, number 10 to which Darré belonged. The court ruled in Darré&#x27;s favor.

Darré was first elected to the &quot;Reichstag&quot; in July 1932, and would continue to serve as a deputy until the fall of the regime. Darré was not part of the first coalition government headed by Hitler. However, on 29 June 1933, shortly after the approval by the &quot;Reichstag&quot; of the Enabling Act of 23 March, he became Reich Minister of Food and Agriculture, succeeding DNVP leader Alfred Hugenberg, who had resigned. He concurrently was made Prussian Minister of Agriculture, and subsequently was named to the Prussian State Council by Prussian Minister President Hermann Göring. He was also named Reich Farmers Leader (&quot;Reichsbauernführer&quot;) in May 1933. On 2 June 1933 Hitler appointed Darré a National Leader (&quot;Reichsleiter&quot;) of the Party. He was also a founding member of the Hans Frank&#x27;s Academy for German Law in October 1933.

Darré went on to set up an agrarian political apparatus to recruit farmers into the party operating along three main directives: to exploit unrest in the countryside as a weapon against urban governments; to win over the farmers as staunch Nazi supporters; to gain a constituency of people to be used as settlers displacing the Slavs in future land grabs in the East. The German historian Klaus Hildebrand described Darré together with Himmler and Alfred Rosenberg as one of the leaders of the &quot;agrarian&quot; fraction within the NSDAP who championed anti-industrial and anti-urban &quot;blood and soil&quot; ideology, expansion into Eastern Europe to gain &quot;Lebensraum&quot;, an alliance with Great Britain to defeat the Soviet Union, and staunch opposition to restoring the pre-1914 German colonial empire. The &quot;agrarian&quot; fraction took the view that Wilhelmine imperialism had taken Germany in the wrong direction by colonizing lands that were unsuitable for mass colonization by German settlers and had unwisely antagonized Britain. The lesson that the Nazi &quot;agrarians&quot; drew from the German Empire was that Germany must focus its ambitions to the continent of Europe in order to win an alliance with Britain and land suitable for German colonization.
Darré was instrumental in founding the Nazi Reich Food Society (&quot;Reichsnährstand&quot;) as part of the Nazification process of the German society (&quot;Gleichschaltung &quot;). Darré campaigned for big landowners to part with some of their land to create new farms, and promoted the controversial Hereditary Farm Law (Reichserbhofgesetz), which forcibly converted most of the country&#x27;s small farms (from 7.5 to 125 hectares - 19 to 309 acres), into hereditary estates that were to be passed from father to son under the ancient laws of entailment. While the law protected small farmers from foreclosure and the ordeal of repossession, it also tied them and their descendants to their hereditary farm forever, not allowing it to be alienated nor mortgaged.

At the Nazi &#x27;agricultural school&#x27; in Burg Neuhaus, the &quot;Reich School of the Reichsnährstand for Physical Exercises&quot; Darré promoted Nordic racial purity through eugenics and the &quot;New nobility of blood and soil&quot;. Darré appointed the photographers Anna Koppitz and German sports photographer Hanns Spudich to produce pictures of the hand-picked young peasant farmers exercising for Rudolf Bode&#x27;s &quot;Neuhaus gymnastik&quot;. The pictures appeared in the June 1939 &quot;Die 5. Reichsnährstands-Ausstellung&quot; (&quot;5th Reich nutrition exhibition&quot;) in Leipzig and in &quot;Odal&quot;, the organ of Nazi propaganda.

Darré developed a plan for &quot;Rasse und Raum&quot; (&quot;race and space&quot;, or territory) along the ideological lines of &quot;Drive to the east&quot; (&quot;Drang nach Osten&quot;), &quot;Living space&quot; (&quot;Lebensraum&quot;) and &quot;Hitler&#x27;s dream of conquest&quot; earlier expounded in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;.

Darré strongly influenced Himmler in his goal to create a German racial aristocracy based on selective breeding. The extreme Nazi policies of eugenics would lead to the annihilation of millions of non-Germans. In the course of the preparations for the &quot;Master Plan for the East&quot; (&quot;Generalplan Ost&quot;), Himmler would later break with Darré, whom he saw as too theoretical. Although Darré was considered one of the few Nazi ministers who knew his field well, he was generally on bad terms with Economy Minister Hjalmar Schacht, particularly as Germany suffered poor harvests in the mid-1930s.

=== Discrediting and displacement ===
Darré&#x27;s influence began to wane as Hitler and Himmler both came to feel that he was too much of a theoretician and an incompetent administrator. By September 1938, Himmler demanded that Darré step down as leader of the SS Race and Settlement Main Office in favour of Günther Pancke. Darré was later placed on an extended leave of absence as Reich Minister on 23 May 1942, ostensibly on health grounds, and his duties were assumed by his State Secretary, Herbert Backe. Darré nominally remained Reich Minister until Backe formally took over as Reich Minister on 6 April 1944. However, Darré was effectively sidelined from May 1942 and retired to his hunting lodge in the Schorfheide forest outside Berlin until the end of the Nazi regime.

The transcript of a 1940 speech, supposedly given by Darré, was published in &quot;Life magazine&quot;, 9 December 1940, reads:
By blitzkrieg . . . before autumn . . . we shall be the absolute masters of two continents . . . a new aristocracy of German masters will be created . . . . [with] slaves assigned to it, these slaves to be their property and to consist of landless, non-German nationals . . . we actually have in mind a modern form of medieval slavery which we must and will introduce because we urgently need it in order to fulfil our great tasks. These slaves will by no means be denied the blessings of illiteracy; higher education will, in future, be reserved only for the German population of Europe . . . .

==After the war==
In April 1945, the American authorities arrested Darré, interned him at Flak-Kaserne Ludwigsburg and tried him at the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials, as one of 21 defendants in the Ministries Trial, also known as the Wilhelmstrasse Trial (1947–1949).

He was charged under the following counts:

* Count I: participation in the planning, preparation, initiation, and waging of wars of aggression and invasion of other countries. Found not guilty.
* Count II: conspiracy to commit crimes against peace and crimes against humanity: The count was dismissed, the tribunal finding that no evidence was offered.
* Count IV: crimes against humanity, relating to offenses committed against German nationals from 1933 to 1939. The count was dismissed upon the arguments of defense counsel.
* Count V: atrocities and offenses committed against civilian populations between 1938 and 1945. Found guilty.
* Count VI: plunder and spoliation. Found guilty.
* Count VII: slave labor. Found not guilty.
* Count VIII: membership of criminal organizations. Found guilty.

Darré was sentenced to seven years at Landsberg Prison. He was released in 1950 and spent his final years in Bad Harzburg. He died in a Munich hospital, on 5 September 1953, of liver cancer. He is buried in Goslar.

==Works==
Darré&#x27;s works were primarily concerned with ancient and present Nordic peasantry, and the ideology of blood and soil. Within this context, he made an explicit attack against Christianity.
In his two main writings, 
* &quot;Das Bauerntum als Lebensquell der nordischen Rasse&quot;, [Peasantry as Life-source of the Nordic Race] (1928)
* &quot;Neuadel aus Blut und Boden&quot;, [New Nobility from Blood and Soil] (1930), 
Darré accused Christianity, with its &quot;teaching of the equality of men before God,&quot; of having &quot;deprived the Teutonic nobility of its moral foundations&quot;, the &quot;innate sense of superiority over the nomadic tribes&quot;.

<text>Laki () or Lakagígar (, &quot;Craters of Laki&quot;) is a volcanic fissure in the western part of Vatnajökull National Park, Iceland, not far from the volcanic fissure of Eldgjá and the small village of Kirkjubæjarklaustur. The fissure is properly referred to as Lakagígar, while Laki is a mountain that the fissure bisects. Lakagígar is part of a volcanic system centered on the volcano Grímsvötn and including the volcano Þórðarhyrna. It lies between the glaciers of Mýrdalsjökull and Vatnajökull, in an area of fissures that run in a southwest to northeast direction.

The system erupted violently over an eight-month period between June 1783 and February 1784 from the Laki fissure and the adjoining volcano Grímsvötn. It poured out an estimated 42 billion tonnes or of basalt lava as well as clouds of poisonous hydrofluoric acid and sulfur dioxide compounds that contaminated the soil, leading to the death of over 50% of Iceland&#x27;s livestock population, and the destruction of the vast majority of all crops. This led to a famine which then killed at least a fifth of the island&#x27;s human population, although some have claimed a quarter. 

The Laki eruption and its aftermath caused a drop in global temperatures, as 120 million tonnes of sulfur dioxide was spewed into the Northern Hemisphere. This caused crop failures in Europe and may have caused droughts in North Africa and India.

==1783 eruption==

On 8 June 1783, a fissure of at least 130 vents opened with phreatomagmatic explosions because of the groundwater interacting with the rising basalt magma. Over a few days the eruptions became less explosive, Strombolian, and later Hawaiian in character, with high rates of lava effusion. This event is rated as 4 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index, but the eight-month emission of sulfuric aerosols resulted in one of the most important climatic and socially significant natural events of the last millennium.

The eruption, also known as the (&quot;Skaftá fires&quot;) or Síðueldur produced an estimated of basalt lava, and the total volume of tephra emitted was . Lava fountains were estimated to have reached heights of . The gases were carried by the convective eruption column to altitudes of about .

The eruption continued until 7 February 1784, but most of the lava was ejected in the first five months. One study states that the event &quot;occurred as ten pulses of activity, each starting with a short-lived explosive phase followed by a long-lived period of fire-fountaining&quot;. Grímsvötn volcano, from which the Laki fissure extends, also erupted at the time, from 1783 until 1785. The outpouring of gases, including an estimated 8 million tonnes of fluorine and an estimated 120 million tonnes of sulfur dioxide, gave rise to what has since become known as the &quot;Laki haze&quot; across Europe.

===Consequences in Iceland===
The consequences for Iceland, known as the (mist hardships), were disastrous. An estimated 20–25% of the population died in the famine after the fissure eruptions ensued. (Some sources specify a death toll of between 9,000 to 9,500 people.) Approximately 80% of sheep (190,500 head), 50% of cattle (11,500 head) and 50% of horses (28,000 head) died because of dental fluorosis and skeletal fluorosis from the 8 million tons of fluorine that were released. The livestock deaths were primarily caused by eating contaminated grass, while humans deaths were mostly from the subsequent famine.

The parish minister and provost of Vestur-Skaftafellssýsla, Jón Steingrímsson (1728–1791), grew famous for the (&quot;fire mass&quot;) that he delivered on 20 July 1783. The church farm of Kirkjubæjarklaustur was endangered by a branch of the lava flow that halted not far from the farm while the Rev. Jón and his parishioners were worshipping in the church. The spot at which the lava diverted away from the church became known thereafter as (&quot;Fire Mass Point&quot;).


===Consequences in monsoon regions===
There is evidence that the Laki eruption weakened African and Indian monsoon circulations, leading to between less daily precipitation than normal over the Sahel of Africa, resulting in, among other effects, low flow in the River Nile. The resulting famine that afflicted Egypt in 1784 cost it roughly one-sixth of its population. The eruption was also found to have affected South Arabia and the already ongoing Chalisa famine in India.

===Consequences in East Asia===
The Great Tenmei famine of 1782–1788 in Japan may have been worsened by the Laki eruption. In the same year, Mount Asama erupted in Japan (Tenmei eruption). The eruption may have affected a drought in eastern China.

===Consequences in Europe===

An estimated 120,000,000 tonnes of sulfur dioxide was emitted, about three times the total annual European industrial output in 2006 (but delivered to higher altitudes, hence its persistence), and equivalent to six times the total 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption. This outpouring of sulfur dioxide during unusual weather conditions caused a thick haze to spread across western Europe, resulting in many thousands of deaths throughout the remainder of 1783 and the winter of 1784.

The summer of 1783 was the hottest on record and a rare high-pressure zone over Iceland caused the winds to blow to the south-east. The poisonous cloud drifted to Bergen in Denmark–Norway, then spread to Prague in the Kingdom of Bohemia (now the Czech Republic) by 17 June, Berlin by 18 June, Paris by 20 June, Le Havre by 22 June, and Great Britain by 23 June. The fog was so thick that ships stayed in port, unable to navigate, and the sun was described as &quot;blood coloured&quot;. 

Inhaling sulfur dioxide gas causes victims to choke as their internal soft tissues swell – the gas reacts with the moisture in the lungs and produces sulfurous acid. The local death rate in Chartres was up by 5% during August and September, with more than 40 dead. In Great Britain, the east of England was most affected. The records show that the additional deaths were among outdoor workers; the death rate in Bedfordshire, Lincolnshire, and the east coast was perhaps two or three times the normal rate. It has been estimated that 23,000 British people died from the poisoning.

The weather became very hot, causing severe thunderstorms with large hailstones that were reported to have killed cattle, until the haze dissipated in the autumn. The winter of 1783–1784 was very severe; the naturalist Gilbert White in Selborne, Hampshire, reported 28 days of continuous frost. The extreme winter is estimated to have caused 8,000 additional deaths in the UK. During the spring thaw, Germany and Central Europe reported severe flood damage. This is considered part of a volcanic winter.

The meteorological impact of Laki continued, contributing significantly to several years of extreme weather in Europe. In France, the sequence of extreme weather events included a failed harvest in 1785 that caused poverty for rural workers, as well as droughts, bad winters and summers. These events contributed significantly to an increase in poverty and famine that may have contributed to the French Revolution in 1789. Laki was only one factor in a decade of climatic disruption, as Grímsvötn was erupting from 1783 to 1785, and there may have been an unusually strong El Niño effect from 1789 to 1793.

===Consequences in North America===
In North America, the winter of 1784 was the longest and one of the coldest on record. It was the longest period of below-zero temperatures in New England, with the largest accumulation of snow in New Jersey, and the longest freezing over of Chesapeake Bay. At the time, the capital of the United States was situated on the Chesapeake at Annapolis, Maryland; the weather delayed Congressmen who were traveling there to vote for the Treaty of Paris, which formally ended the American Revolutionary War. A huge snowstorm hit the South; the Mississippi River froze at New Orleans and there were reports of ice floes in the Gulf of Mexico.

===Contemporaneous reports===
Gilbert White recorded his perceptions of the event at Selborne, Hampshire, England:

Benjamin Franklin recorded his observations in America in a 1784 lecture:

According to contemporary records, Hekla did not erupt in 1783; its previous eruption was in 1766. The Laki fissure eruption was east and the Grímsvötn volcano was erupting about northeast. Katla, only southeast, was still renowned after its spectacular eruption 28 years earlier in 1755.

Sir John Cullum of Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England, recorded his observations on 23 June 1783 (the same date on which Gilbert White noted the onset of the unusual atmospheric phenomena), in a letter to Sir Joseph Banks, then President of the Royal Society:

Sir John goes on to describe the effect of this &quot;frost&quot; on trees and crops:

The area around Shingō was controlled by the Nanbu clan of Morioka Domain during the Edo period. During the post-Meiji Restoration establishment of the modern municipalities system on 1 April 1889, Herai Village and neighboring Nozawa Village were formed. On 29 July 1955, the western portion of Nozawa Village merged into Herai, which was then renamed Shingō.

==Government==
Shingō has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral village council of eight members. Shingō is part of Sannohe District which contributes three members to the Aomori Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the village is part of Aomori 2nd district of the House of Representatives of the National Diet.

==Education==
Shingō has one public elementary school, one public middle school, and a preschool operated by the village government. The village does not have a high school.

==Economy==
The economy of Shingō is heavily dependent on agriculture. Notable crops include garlic, edible chrysanthemum, Japanese yam and tobacco. Traditionally a horse breeding area, Shingō is also known for its cattle ranches.

==Transportation==
===Railway===
*The village has no passenger railway service. The nearest train station is JR East Hachinohe Station, served by the Tohoku Shinkansen and Hachinohe Lines, and the Aoimori Railway Aoimori Railway Line.

==&quot;Tomb of Jesus&quot;==

Shingō is the location of what is purported to be the resting place of Jesus, the , and the residence of Jesus&#x27; descendants, the Sawaguchi family. According to these claims, Jesus Christ did not die on the cross at Golgotha. Instead, a man alleged to be his brother, Isukiri, took his place on the cross, while Jesus escaped across Siberia to Mutsu Province, in northern Japan.

<text>Mannus, according to the Roman writer Tacitus, was a figure in the creation myths of the Germanic tribes. Tacitus is the only source of these myths.

Tacitus wrote that Mannus was the son of Tuisto and the progenitor of the three Germanic tribes Ingaevones, Herminones and Istvaeones. In discussing the German tribes, Tacitus wrote:
Several authors consider the name &quot;Mannus&quot; in Tacitus&#x27;s work to stem from an Indo-European root. 

The Latinized name is evidently of some relation to Proto-Germanic , &#x27;man&#x27;.

Mannus again became popular in literature in the 16th century, after works published by Annius de Viterbo and Johannes Aventinus purported to list him as a primeval king over Germany and Sarmatia.

In the 19th century, F. Nork wrote that the names of the three sons of Mannus can be extrapolated as Ingui, Irmin, and Istaev or Iscio. A few scholars like Ralph T. H. Griffith have expressed a connection between Mannus and the names of other ancient founder-kings, such as Minos of Greek mythology, and Manu of Hindu tradition.

Guido von List incorporated the myth of Mannus and his sons into his occult practice, which were later adopted into Nazi occult beliefs.

<doc id="690539" wikidata="Q59314" url="?curid=690539" title="Gloria Grahame">
<text>Gloria Grahame (born Gloria Penelope Hallward; November 28, 1923 – October 5, 1981) was an American actress. She began her acting career in theater, and in 1944 made her first film for MGM. Many biographies indicate she was born Gloria Grahame Hallward, but she adopted the surname Grahame, her mother&#x27;s acting name, as her professional name.

Despite a featured role in &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; (1946), MGM did not believe she had the potential for major success and sold her contract to RKO. Often cast in film noir projects, Grahame was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for &quot;Crossfire&quot; (1947), and later won the award for her work in &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot; (1952). After starring opposite Humphrey Bogart in &quot;In a Lonely Place&quot; (1950), she achieved her highest profile with &quot;Sudden Fear&quot; (1952), &quot;The Big Heat&quot; (1953), &quot;Human Desire&quot; (1954), and &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; (1955), but her film career began to wane soon afterwards. She returned to work on the stage, but continued to appear in films and television productions, usually in supporting roles.

In 1974, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. It went into remission less than a year later and Grahame returned to work. In 1980, the cancer returned, but Grahame refused to accept the diagnosis or seek treatment. Choosing instead to continue working, she traveled to the United Kingdom to appear in a play. Her health, however, declined rapidly. At her family&#x27;s insistence, she returned to New York City, dying the same day, October 5, 1981, at St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital at the age of 57.

==Early life==
Gloria Penelope Hallward was born in Los Angeles, the younger child of Michael and Jean Hallward. She was raised a Methodist. Her English father, Reginald Michael Bloxam Hallward (later known as Michael Hallward) was an architect and author; her Scottish mother, Jean McDougall, who used the stage name Jean Grahame, was a stage actress and acting teacher. The couple had an elder daughter, Joy Hallward, an actress who married John Mitchum (younger brother of actor Robert Mitchum). During Gloria&#x27;s childhood and adolescence, her mother taught her acting. Grahame attended Hollywood High School before dropping out to pursue acting. She was raised a Methodist. 

==Career==

An early stage appearance was in the long-running farce &quot;Good Night, Ladies&quot; at Chicago&#x27;s Blackstone Theatre, starring Buddy Ebsen, which opened on April 12, 1942.

Grahame made her Broadway debut on December 6, 1943, at the Royale Theatre as Florrie in Nunnally Johnson&#x27;s &quot;The World&#x27;s Full of Girls&quot;, which was adapted from Thomas Bell&#x27;s 1943 novel &quot;Till I Come Back to You&quot;. She was signed to a contract with MGM Studios under her professional name after Louis B. Mayer saw her performance. Another Broadway role was in April-May 1944&#x27;s &quot;Highland Fling&quot;. She made her film debut in &quot;Blonde Fever&quot; (1944) and then achieved one of her most widely praised roles as the vixenish Violet Bick, saved from disgrace by George Bailey in &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; (1946). MGM felt unable to develop her potential as a star, and her contract was sold to RKO Studios in 1947. 
Grahame was often featured in film noir pictures as a tarnished beauty with an irresistible sexual allure. During this time, she made films for several Hollywood studios. She received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress for &quot;Crossfire&quot; (1947).

Grahame starred with Humphrey Bogart in the film &quot;In a Lonely Place&quot; (1950) for Columbia Pictures, a performance for which she gained praise. Though today it is considered among her finest performances, it was not a box-office hit, and Howard Hughes, owner of RKO, admitted that he never saw it. When she asked to be lent out for roles in &quot;Born Yesterday&quot; (also 1950) and &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot; (1951), Hughes refused and instead made her perform a supporting role in &quot;Macao&quot; (1952). 
Despite appearing for only a little over nine minutes on screen, she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in MGM&#x27;s &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot; (also 1952); she long held the record for the shortest performance on screen to win an acting Oscar until Beatrice Straight won for &quot;Network&quot; (1976) with a five-minute performance.

Grahame&#x27;s other memorable roles included the scheming Irene Neves in &quot;Sudden Fear&quot; (also 1952); mob moll Debby Marsh in Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;The Big Heat&quot; (1953) in which, in a horrifying off-screen scene, she is scarred by hot coffee thrown in her face by Lee Marvin&#x27;s character; and the &quot;femme fatale&quot; Vicki Buckley in Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Human Desire&quot; (1954). Grahame appeared as wealthy seductress Harriet Lang in Stanley Kramer&#x27;s &quot;Not as a Stranger&quot; (1955) starring Olivia de Havilland, Robert Mitchum, and Frank Sinatra. Grahame also did her own stunts as Angel the Elephant Girl in Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot;, which won the Oscar for best film of 1952.

Grahame&#x27;s career began to wane after her performance in the musical film &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; (1955). She, whom audiences were used to seeing as a film noir siren, was viewed by some critics to be miscast as an ignorant country lass in a wholesome musical, and the paralysis of her upper lip from plastic surgery altered her speech and appearance. Additionally, she was rumored to have been difficult on the set of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, upstaging some of the cast and alienating her co-stars. 

Grahame also guest-starred in television series, including the science-fiction series &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;. In the 1964 episode of that series titled &quot;The Guests&quot;, Grahame plays a forgotten film star living in the past. She also appears in an episode of &quot;The Fugitive&quot; (&quot;The Homecoming&quot;, 1964) and an episode of &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot; (&quot;Who Killed The Rabbit&#x27;s Husband&quot;, 1965). Grahame can be seen also in a 1970 episode of &quot;Mannix&quot; titled “Duet for Three” (season four, episode 13) and in small roles in the miniseries &quot;Rich Man, Poor Man&quot; and &quot;Seventh Avenue&quot;.

The play &quot;The Time of Your Life&quot; was revived on March 17, 1972, at the Huntington Hartford Theater in Los Angeles with Grahame, Henry Fonda, Richard Dreyfuss, Lewis J. Stadlen, Ron Thompson, Jane Alexander, Richard X. Slattery, and Pepper Martin among the cast, and Edwin Sherin directing.

==Personal life==
Over time, Grahame became increasingly concerned with her physical appearance; she particularly felt her upper lip was too thin and had ridges that were too deep. She began stuffing cotton or tissues under it, which she felt gave her a sexier look. Several co-stars discovered this during kissing scenes. In the mid-1940s, Grahame began undergoing small cosmetic procedures on her lips and face. According to her niece, Vicky Mitchum, Grahame&#x27;s obsession with vanity led her to undergo more cosmetic procedures that rendered her upper lip immobile because of nerve damage. Mitchum said, &quot;Over the years, she [Grahame] carved herself up, trying to make herself into an image of beauty she felt should exist but didn&#x27;t. Others saw her as a beautiful person, but she never did, and crazy things spread from that.&quot; 

Grahame was a Democrat who supported Adlai Stevenson&#x27;s campaign in the 1952 presidential election.

===Relationships, marriages, and children===
Grahame was married four times and had four children. 

Her first marriage was to actor Stanley Clements in August 1945. They divorced in June 1948. 

The day after her divorce from Clements was final, Grahame married director Nicholas Ray. They had a son in November 1948. After several separations and reconciliations, Grahame and Ray divorced in 1952. 

According to Glenn Ford&#x27;s son Peter, Grahame had an affair with Ford during the filming of &quot;Human Desire&quot; in 1954.

Grahame&#x27;s third marriage was to writer and TV producer Cy Howard. They married in August 1954 and had a daughter in 1956. Grahame filed for divorce from Howard in May 1957, citing mental cruelty. Their divorce was final as of November 1957.

Grahame&#x27;s fourth and final marriage was to actor Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; Ray, when he was 23 years old and she was 37. He was the son of her second husband Nicholas Ray and his first wife Jean Evans, and was Grahame&#x27;s former stepson. According to Nicholas Ray, he allegedly caught Grahame and a 13-year-old Tony in bed together, which effectively ended their marriage in 1950. However, Grahame&#x27;s former partner and biographer, Peter Turner, disputed this, saying the story of Tony being underage when Grahame began a sexual relationship with him is &quot;fiction&quot;. Grahame and Anthony Ray began dating in 1958 and married in Tijuana, Mexico, in May 1960. The couple had two children: boys born in 1963 and 1965.

News of the 1960 marriage to Tony was kept private until 1962, when it was written about in the tabloids. The ensuing scandal damaged Grahame&#x27;s reputation and affected her career. After learning of her marriage to Anthony Ray, Grahame&#x27;s third husband, Cy Howard, attempted to gain sole custody of the couple&#x27;s daughter. Howard claimed Grahame was an unfit mother, and the two fought over custody of their daughter for years. The stress of the scandal, her waning career, and her custody battle with Howard took its toll on Grahame and she had a nervous breakdown. She later underwent electroconvulsive therapy in 1964. 

Despite the scandal, Grahame&#x27;s marriage to Anthony Ray was the only one of four to last beyond four years, ending a few days short of their 14th anniversary in May 1974.

From 1979 to 1981, Grahame had a relationship with British actor Peter Turner. Turner authored a book about his time with Grahame called &quot;Film Stars Don&#x27;t Die in Liverpool&quot;, which was later turned into a movie of the same name.

==Death==
In March 1974, Grahame was diagnosed with breast cancer. She underwent radiation treatment, changed her diet, stopped smoking and drinking alcohol, and sought homeopathic remedies. In less than a year, the cancer went into remission but returned in 1980. In autumn 1981, while performing at The Dukes in Lancaster, England, Grahame fell ill. 

She told her former lover, actor Peter Turner, and asked him not to contact doctors or her family (which he did anyway). According to Turner&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Film Stars Don&#x27;t Die in Liverpool&quot;, Turner&#x27;s local family physician told Grahame she had a cancerous tumor &quot;the size of a football&quot; in her abdomen. Breast cancer is not mentioned in the book. Turner informed Grahame&#x27;s children of her illness; they brought her back to the US against her wishes and those of her doctor and Turner. She was immediately admitted to St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital in Manhattan on October 5, 1981, where she died a few hours later of stomach cancer and peritonitis at age 57.

Grahame&#x27;s remains were interred at Oakwood Memorial Park Cemetery in Chatsworth, Los Angeles.

==Legacy==
On February 8, 1960, for her contributions to the motion-picture industry, Grahame had a star placed on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6522 Hollywood Boulevard.

On November 16, 2017, the motion picture &quot;Film Stars Don&#x27;t Die in Liverpool&quot; (2017), based on Peter Turner&#x27;s account of the final years of Grahame&#x27;s life, was released in the United Kingdom. The film was released in the United States on December 29, 2017. In the film, Grahame was portrayed by Annette Bening.

Grahame had kept an apartment at the Manhattan Plaza residential complex, and its community room, where her portrait hangs, is dedicated to her.

<text>Kapampangan, Capampáñgan, or Pampangan, is an Austronesian language, and one of the eight major languages of the Philippines. It is the primary and predominant language of the entire province of Pampanga and southern Tarlac, on the southern part of Luzon&#x27;s central plains geographic region, where the Kapampangan ethnic group resides. Kapampangan is also spoken in northeastern Bataan, as well as in the provinces of Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, and Zambales that border Pampanga. It is further spoken as a second language by a few Aeta groups in the southern part of Central Luzon. The language is known honorifically as (&#x27;breastfed, or nurtured, language&#x27;).

Kapampangan is assigned the ISO 639-2 three-letter code pam, but not an ISO 639-1 two-letter code.

==Classification==
Kapampangan is one of the Central Luzon languages of the Austronesian language family. Its closest relatives are the Sambalic languages of Zambales province and the Bolinao language spoken in the towns of Bolinao and Anda in Pangasinan. These languages share the same reflex of the proto-Malayo-Polynesian *R.

==History==
&quot;Kapampangan&quot; is derived from the root word (&#x27;riverbank&#x27;). The language was historically spoken in the Kingdom of Tondo, ruled by the Lakans.

A number of Kapampangan dictionaries and grammar books were written during the Spanish colonial period. wrote two 18th-century books about the language: (first published in 1729) and (first published in 1732). Kapampangan produced two 19th-century literary giants; was noted for and , and playwright wrote in 1901. &quot;Crissotan&quot; was written by Amado Yuzon, Soto&#x27;s 1950s contemporary and Nobel Prize nominee for peace and literature, to immortalize his contribution to Kapampangan literature.
==Geographic distribution==
Kapampangan is predominantly spoken in the province of Pampanga and southern Tarlac (Bamban, Capas, Concepcion, San Jose, Gerona, La Paz, Victoria and Tarlac City). It is also spoken in border communities of the provinces of Bataan (Dinalupihan, Hermosa and Orani), Bulacan (Baliuag, San Miguel, San Ildefonso, Hagonoy, Plaridel, Pulilan and Calumpit), Nueva Ecija (Cabiao, San Antonio, San Isidro, Gapan and Cabanatuan) and Zambales (Olongapo City and Subic). In Mindanao, a significant Kapampangan-speaking minority also exists in Cagayan de Oro, Davao City and South Cotabato, specifically in General Santos and the municipalities of Polomolok and Tupi. According to the 2000 Philippine census, 2,312,870 people (out of the total population of 76,332,470) spoke Kapampangan as their native language. As of 2020, the language is ranked to be the eighth leading language spoken at home in the Philippines with only 639,687 households still speaking the language.

==Phonology==
Standard Kapampangan has 21 phonemes: 15 consonants and five vowels; some western dialects have six vowels. Syllabic structure is relatively simple; each syllable contains at least one consonant and a vowel.

===Vowels===
Standard Kapampangan has five vowel phonemes:
*, a close back unrounded vowel when unstressed; allophonic with , an open front unrounded vowel similar to English &quot;father&quot; when stressed
*, an open-mid front unrounded vowel similar to English &quot;bed&quot;
*, a close front unrounded vowel similar to English &quot;machine&quot;
*, a close-mid back rounded vowel similar to English &quot;forty&quot;
*, a close back rounded vowel similar to English &quot;flute&quot;

There are four main diphthongs: , , , and . In most dialects (including standard Kapampangan), and are reduced to and respectively. 

Monophthongs have allophones in unstressed and syllable-final positions:
* becomes in all unstressed positions.
*Unstressed is usually pronounced , as in English &quot;bit&quot; and &quot;book&quot; respectively (except final syllables).
*In final syllables can be pronounced , and can be pronounced .
** (&#x27;these&#x27;) can be pronounced / or /; (&#x27;bought&#x27;) can be pronounced or ; (&#x27;to us&#x27; [except you]) can be pronounced or ; can be pronounced or , (&#x27;dusk&#x27;) can be pronounced or .
** (&#x27;he said, she said, they said, it was said, allegedly, reportedly, supposedly&#x27;) can be pronounced or ; (&#x27;book&#x27;) can be pronounced or ; (&#x27;who&#x27;) can be pronounced or ; (&#x27;to me&#x27;) can be pronounced or , and (&#x27;cricket&#x27;) can be pronounced or .
*Unstressed are usually pronounced , respectively (except final syllables).

===Consonants===
In the chart of Kapampangan consonants, all stops are unaspirated. The velar nasal occurs in all positions, including the beginning of a word. Unlike other languages of the Philippines but similar to Ilocano, Kapampangan uses /h/ only in words of foreign origin.

* tends to lenite to between vowels.
* and are allophones in Kapampangan, and sometimes interchangeable; can be (&#x27;Where are the books?&#x27;).
*A glottal stop at the end of a word is often omitted in the middle of a sentence and, unlike in most languages of the Philippines, is conspicuously absent word-internally; hence, Batiáuan&#x27;s dropping of semivowels from its very name.

===Stress===
Stress is phonemic in Kapampangan. Primary stress occurs on the last or the next-to-last syllable of a word. Vowel lengthening accompanies primary or secondary stress, except when stress occurs at the end of a word. Stress shift can occur, shifting to the right or left to differentiate between nominal or verbal use (as in the following examples):
* (&#x27;should, ought to&#x27;) → (&#x27;deed, concern, business&#x27;)
* (&#x27;gather, burn trash&#x27;) → (&#x27;trash pile&#x27;)

Stress shift can also occur when one word is derived from another through affixation; again, stress can shift to the right or the left:
* → (&#x27;company&#x27;)
* → (&#x27;melt, digest&#x27;)

===Sound changes===
In Kapampangan, the proto-Philippine schwa vowel merged to in most dialects of Kapampangan; it is preserved in some western dialects. Proto-Philippine is (&#x27;to plant&#x27;) in Kapampangan, compared with Tagalog , Cebuano and Ilocano (&#x27;grave&#x27;).

Proto-Philippine merged with . The Kapampangan word for &#x27;new&#x27; is ; it is in Tagalog, in Ilocano, and in Indonesian.

==Grammar==

Kapampangan is a VSO or Verb-Subject-Object language. However, the word order can be very flexible and change to VOS (Verb-Object-Subject) and SVO (Subject-Verb-Object). Just like other Austronesian languages, Kapampangan is also an agglutinative language where new words are formed by adding affixes onto a root word (affixation) and the repetition of words, or portions of words (reduplication), (for example: (&#x27;child&#x27;) to (&#x27;children&#x27;)). Root words are frequently derived from other words by means of prefixes, infixes, suffixes and circumfixes. (For example: (&#x27;food&#x27;) to (&#x27;to eat&#x27;) to &#x27; (&#x27;eating&#x27;) to (&#x27;being eaten&#x27;)).

Kapampangan can form long words through extensive use of affixes, for example: , &#x27;a group of people having their noses bleed at the same time&#x27;, , &#x27;everyone loves each other&#x27;, , &#x27;can speak Kapampangan&#x27;, and , &#x27;until to fall in love&#x27;. Long words frequently occur in normal Kapampangan.

===Nouns===
Kapampangan nouns are not inflected, but are usually preceded by case markers. There are three types of case markers: absolutive (nominative), ergative (genitive), and oblique.

Unlike English and Spanish (which are nominative–accusative languages) and Inuit and Basque (which are ergative–absolutive languages), Kapampangan has Austronesian alignment (in common with most Philippine languages). Austronesian alignment may work with nominative (and absolutive) or ergative (and absolutive) markers and pronouns.

Absolutive or nominative markers mark the actor of an intransitive verb and the object of a transitive verb. Ergative or genitive markers mark the object (usually indefinite) of an intransitive verb and the actor of a transitive one. It also marks possession. Oblique markers, similar to prepositions in English, mark (for example) location and direction. Noun markers are divided into two classes: names of people (personal) and everything else (common).

Examples:
* (&#x27;The man arrived.&#x27;)
* (&#x27;Juan saw Maria.&#x27;)
* (&#x27;Elena and Roberto will go to Miguel&#x27;s house.&#x27;)
* (&#x27;Where are the books?&#x27;)
* (&#x27;I will give the key to Carmen.&#x27;)

===Pronouns===
Kapampangan pronouns are categorized by case: absolutive, ergative, and oblique.

====Examples====
* (&#x27;I wrote.&#x27;)
* (&#x27;I wrote to him.&#x27;)
* (&#x27;He [or she] wrote me.&#x27;)
* (&#x27;He [or she] has arrived.&#x27;) Note: &#x27;He arrived (or arrives)&#x27;; &#x27;He has arrived.&#x27;
* (&#x27;Tell it to me.&#x27;)
* (&#x27;Who called you?&#x27;)
* (&#x27;They are reading.&#x27;)
* (&#x27;Are the pigs eating?&#x27;)

Genitive pronouns follow the word they modify. Oblique pronouns can replace the genitive pronoun, but precede the word they modify.

*; ; (&#x27;my house&#x27;)

The dual pronoun and the inclusive pronoun refer to the first and second person. The exclusive pronoun refers to the first and third persons.

* (&#x27;We [dual] do not have rice.&#x27;)
* (&#x27;We [inclusive] do not have rice.&#x27;)
*, (&#x27;We [exclusive] do not have rice.&#x27;)

Kapampangan differs from many Philippine languages in requiring the pronoun even if the noun it represents, or the grammatical antecedent, is present.

* (not ; &#x27;Ernie arrived&#x27;).
* (not ; &#x27;Maria and Juan are reading&#x27;).
* (not ; &#x27;José wrote you&#x27;).

====Special forms====
The pronouns and have special forms when they are used in conjunction with the words (&#x27;there is/are&#x27;) and (&#x27;there is/are not&#x27;).

* (&#x27;He is in Pampanga&#x27;).
*, (&#x27;The doctors are no longer here&#x27;).

Both and are correct. The plural form (&#x27;they are&#x27;) is and . Both and are correct in the plural form. The singular forms are and .

====Pronoun combinations====
Kapampangan pronouns follow a certain order after verbs (or particles, such as negation words). The enclitic pronoun is always followed by another pronoun (or discourse marker:
* (&#x27;I saw you&#x27;).
* (&#x27;He wrote to me&#x27;).

Pronouns also combine to form a portmanteau pronoun:
* (&#x27;I saw her&#x27;).
* (&#x27;I will give them money&#x27;).

Portmanteau pronouns are not usually used in questions and with the word :
* (&#x27;Do you see him?&#x27;)
*, (&#x27;He likes that, too&#x27;).

In the following chart, blank entries denote combinations which are deemed impossible. Column headings denote pronouns in the absolutive case, and the row headings denote the ergative case.

===Demonstrative pronouns===
Kapampangan&#x27;s demonstrative pronouns differ from other Philippine languages by having separate forms for singular and plural.

The demonstrative pronouns and (and their respective forms) both mean &#x27;this&#x27;, but each has distinct uses. usually refers to something abstract, but may also refer to concrete nouns: (&#x27;this music&#x27;), (&#x27;this is what we do&#x27;). is always concrete: (&#x27;this book&#x27;), (&#x27;this is Juan&#x27;s dog&#x27;).

In their locative forms, is used when the person spoken to is not near the subject spoken of; is used when the person spoken to is near the subject spoken of. Two people in the same country will refer to their country as , but will refer to their respective towns as ; both mean &#x27;here&#x27;.

The plural forms of a demonstrative pronoun and its existential form (for the nearest addressee) are exceptions. The plural of is ; the plural of is ; the plural of is , and the plural of is . The existential form of is .

* (&#x27;What&#x27;s this?&#x27;)
*, (&#x27;These flowers smell nice&#x27;).
* (&#x27;Who is that man?&#x27;)
*, (&#x27;Come here&#x27;).
*, , (&#x27;I am here&#x27;).
* (&#x27;They will eat there&#x27;).
* (&#x27;Who is that child?&#x27;)
* (&#x27;So that&#x27;s where your glasses are!&#x27;)
* (&#x27;I haven&#x27;t seen one of these before&#x27;).
* (&#x27;Those are delicious&#x27;).
* (&#x27;Here are the two gifts for you&#x27;).
* (&#x27;I like you!&#x27;)
* (&#x27;I love you!&#x27;)
* (&#x27;Let&#x27;s eat!&#x27;)
* (&#x27;I don&#x27;t want to lose you!&#x27;)

===Verbs===
Kapampangan verbs are morphologically complex, and take a variety of affixes reflecting focus, aspect and mode. The language has Austronesian alignment, and the verbs change according to triggers in the sentence (better known as voices). Kapampangan has five voices: agent, patient, goal, locative, and cirumstantial. The circumstantial voice prefix is used for instrument and benefactee subjects.

The direct case morphemes in Kapampangan are (which marks singular subjects) and , for plural subjects. Non-subject agents are marked with the ergative-case ; non-subject patients are marked with the accusative-case &quot;-ng&quot;, which is cliticized onto the preceding word.

==== Ambiguities and irregularities ====
Speakers of other Philippine languages find Kapampangan verbs difficult because some verbs belong to unpredictable verb classes and some verb forms are ambiguous. The root word (&#x27;write&#x27;) exists in Tagalog and Kapampangan:
* means &#x27;is writing&#x27; in Kapampangan and &#x27;will write&#x27; in Tagalog.
* means &#x27;will write&#x27; in Kapampangan and &#x27;wrote&#x27; in Tagalog. It is the infinitive in both languages.
* means &#x27;wrote&#x27; in both languages. In Kapampangan, it is in the actor focus (with long i: ) or object focus (with short i: ), and object focus only in Tagalog.

The object-focus suffix &quot;-an&quot; represents two focuses; the only difference is that one conjugation preserves &quot;-an&quot; in the completed aspect, and it is dropped in the other conjugation:
* (&#x27;to pay someone&#x27;): (&#x27;will pay someone&#x27;), (&#x27;is paying someone&#x27;), (&#x27;paid someone&#x27;)
* (&#x27;to pay for something&#x27;): (&#x27;will pay for something&#x27;), (&#x27;is paying for something&#x27;), (&#x27;paid for something&#x27;)

Other Philippine languages have separate forms; Tagalog has &quot;-in&quot; and &quot;-an&quot;, Bikol and most of the Visayan languages have &quot;-on&quot; and &quot;-an&quot;, and Ilokano has &quot;-en&quot; and &quot;-an&quot; due to historical sound changes in the proto-Philippine /*e/.

A number of actor-focus verbs do not use the infix &quot;-um-&quot;, but are usually conjugated like other verbs which do (for example, (&#x27;to do&#x27;), (&#x27;to immerse&#x27;), (&#x27;to dance&#x27;), (&#x27;to take off&#x27;), (&#x27;to smoke&#x27;), (&#x27;to fetch&#x27;), (&#x27;to step&#x27;) and (&#x27;to accompany&#x27;). Many of these verbs undergo a change of vowel instead of taking the infix &quot;-in-&quot; (completed aspect). In the actor focus (&quot;-um-&quot; verbs), this happens only to verbs with the vowel in the first syllable; (&#x27;to take off&#x27;) is conjugated (&#x27;will take off&#x27;), (&#x27;is taking off&#x27;), and (&#x27;took off&#x27;).

This change of vowel also applies to certain object-focus verbs in the completed aspect. In addition to becoming , becomes in certain cases (for example, [&#x27;brought something&#x27;], [&#x27;worked on something&#x27;] and [&#x27;bought&#x27;]).

There is no written distinction between the two &quot;mag-&quot; affixes; may mean &#x27;is speaking&#x27; or &#x27;will speak&#x27;, but there is an audible difference. means &#x27;will speak&#x27; while means &#x27;is speaking&#x27;.

Many Filipino surnames that end with “on”, “son”, and “zon” are of Chinese origin, Hispanized version of 孫 (&quot;sun&quot;).

Due to the influence of Buddhism and Hinduism, Kapampangan also acquired words from Sanskrit. A few examples are:

*, &#x27;home&#x27;, from the Sanskrit &quot;alaya&quot;
*, &#x27;fate&#x27;, from the Sanskrit &quot;karma&quot;
*, &#x27;divine law&#x27;, from the Sanskrit &quot;dharma&quot;

* &#x27;demerit, bad karma&#x27; from the Sanskrit 
* &#x27;fruit, blessings&#x27; from the Sanskrit &quot;phala&quot;

The language has also absorbed many Spanish loanwords due to the 333 years of presence of the Spaniards in the Kapampangan speaking provinces. Hence, Spanish Days of the Week, Months, and Numbers are used in Kapampangan respectively. Many Spanish expressions, basic nouns, verbs, and phrases are also present in the Language. Such as, (&quot;Kómusta?&quot;) from Spanish, &quot;cómo estás&quot; which means &#x27;how are you?&#x27;. (this common expression can also be found in other Philippine Languages, such as Tagalog, Bisaya, Hiligaynon, etc. Other examples are:

* &quot;Aparte, &#x27;&quot;aside or apart&#x27;, from Spanish &#x27;&quot;Aparte&quot;&#x27;
* &quot;Casafuego,&quot; &#x27;matchstick&#x27;, from Mexican Spanish &quot;Casa fuego&quot;. &#x27;&quot;Fósforro&quot;&#x27; which is also Spanish, is also commonly used by the Speakers.
* &quot;Mariposa&quot;, &#x27;butterfly&#x27;, from Spanish &quot;&#x27;Mariposa&quot;&#x27;
* &quot;Primeru&quot;, &#x27;first&#x27;, from Spanish &quot;&#x27;Primero&quot;&#x27;

* &quot;Filipinas&quot;, &#x27;philippines&#x27;, from Spanish &quot;&#x27;Filipinas&quot;&#x27;

==Orthography==
Kapampangan, like most Philippine languages, uses the Latin alphabet. Before the Spanish colonization of the Philippines, it was written in old Kapampangan writing. Kapampangan is usually written in one of three different writing systems: &quot;sulat Baculud&quot;, &quot;sulat Wawa&quot; and a hybrid of the two, &quot;Amung Samson&quot;.

The first system (, also known as or in the system) is based on Spanish orthography, a feature of which involved the use of the letters ⟨c⟩ and ⟨q⟩ to represent the phoneme (depending on the vowel sound following the phoneme). ⟨C⟩ was used before , and (&quot;ca&quot;, &quot;co&quot; and &quot;cu&quot;), and ⟨q⟩ was used with ⟨u⟩ before the vowels and (&quot;que&quot;, &quot;qui&quot;). The Spanish-based orthography is primarily associated with literature by authors from Bacolor and the text used on the Kapampangan .

The second system, the , is an &quot;indigenized&quot; form which preferred ⟨k⟩ over ⟨c⟩ and ⟨q⟩ in representing the phoneme . This orthography, based on the Abakada alphabet was used by writers from Guagua and rivaled writers from the nearby town of Bacolor.

The third system, hybrid orthography, intends to resolve the conflict in spelling between proponents of the and . This system was created by former Catholic priest Venancio Samson during the 1970s to translate the Bible into Kapampangan. It resolved conflicts between the use of ⟨q⟩ and ⟨c⟩ (in ) and ⟨k⟩ (in ) by using ⟨k⟩ before ⟨e⟩ and ⟨i⟩ (instead of [qu]⟩ and using ⟨c⟩ before ⟨a⟩, ⟨o⟩, and ⟨u⟩ (instead of ⟨k⟩). The system also removed ⟨ll⟩ and ⟨ñ⟩ (from Spanish), replacing them with ⟨ly⟩ and ⟨ny⟩.

Orthography has been debated by Kapampangan writers, and orthographic styles may vary by writer. The system has become the popular method of writing due to the influence of the Tagalog-based Filipino language (the national language) and its orthography. The system is used by the Akademyang Kapampangan and the poet Jose Gallardo.

<text>The black-throated munia or Jerdon&#x27;s mannikin (Lonchura kelaarti) is a small passerine bird. This estrildid finch is a resident breeding bird in the hills of southwest India, the Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats and Sri Lanka.

==Habitat==
The black-throated munia is a small gregarious bird which feeds mainly on seeds. It frequents open hill woodland and cultivation. The nest is a large domed grass structure in a tree or creepers on a house into which 3-8 white eggs are laid in India, and usually five in Sri Lanka.

==Characteristics==

The black-throated munia is 12 cm in length with a long black tail. The adult of the southwest Indian population, &quot;L. k. jerdoni&quot;, has a stubby grey bill, dark brown upperparts with pale shaft streaks; a blackish face and bib; and pinkish brown underparts with scaly marking towards the vent. The Eastern Ghats form &quot;vernayi&quot; has paler pinkish underparts. The nominate form &quot;L. k. kelaarti&quot; of Sri Lanka has scaly patterning on the underparts and vent with the pale almost whitish shaft streaks contrasting on the darker back. The sexes are similar in all populations, but immatures lack the darker face and have more uniform underparts.

==Commemoration==
The binomial commemorates the zoologist Edward Frederick Kelaart and the name was given by Thomas C. Jerdon in 1863.

<text>Eldgjá (, &quot;fire canyon&quot;) is a volcano and a canyon in Iceland. Eldgjá is part of the Katla volcano; it is a segment of a long chain of volcanic craters and fissure vents that extends northeast away from Katla volcano almost to the Vatnajökull ice cap. This fissure experienced a major eruption around 939 CE, which was the largest effusive eruption in recent history. It covered about of land with of lava from two major lava flows.

While Icelandic records about the effects of the eruption are sparse, paleoclimate proxies and historical records from China, Europe and the Islamic world describe widespread impacts on the Northern Hemisphere climate. The Eldgjá eruption produced a noticeable cooling of the climate, with resulting cold winters and food crises across Eurasia.

== Geology ==
The interaction between the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the Iceland hotspot has given rise to the stack of volcanic rocks that forms Iceland. Volcanoes on Iceland occur in four volcanic zones; the North Volcanic Zone in northeastern Iceland, the East Volcanic Zone in the southeast, the West Volcanic Zone in the southwest and the Snæfellsnes Volcanic Zone in the west. The first three of these form an upside-down Y structure, with each volcanic zone consisting of volcanic and tectonic lineaments that extend from north-northeast to south-southwest. These lineaments are dotted with volcanic edifices; Eldgjá lies in the East Volcanic Zone where there are no large shield volcanoes but numerous long fissures, including Laki.

Glaciation has influenced volcanic activity on Iceland, and the occurrence of large eruptions—such as the Þjórsá Lava 8,600 years ago—in the early Holocene has been attributed to the unloading of the crust caused by the melting of Pleistocene ice. This process does not appear to have influenced the Eldgjá eruption. Eldgjá&#x27;s eruption may have altered the shape of the Katla volcano and thus modified the behaviour of its glaciers. Glacial meltwater drains from Katla through several subglacial &quot;tunnels&quot;, one of which coincides with the Eldgjá lineament, and geothermal activity on the lineament drives melting and the formation of cauldron-shaped depressions in the northeastern sector of the Myrdalsjökull Ice Cap. Moraines from the ice cap extend to the Eldgjá lineament.

The rocks erupted by Eldgjá are mainly alkali basalts, which have a uniform composition and contain phenocrysts of clinopyroxene, olivine, magnetite and plagioclase. There are also a small amount of tholeiitic rocks. The composition of Katla magmas shows evidence of long-term variations that appear to reflect a long-term cycle of its magmatic system. The Eldgjá eruption appears to be the beginning of one such cycle that continues to the present-day. There is evidence that eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull often precede eruptions at Katla, raising concerns after the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull that Katla may erupt again.

== Geography and geomorphology ==

 means &quot;fire gorge&quot; and is a reference to the fissure that makes up the volcano; the term is also used with other Icelandic volcanoes. It is situated between Landmannalaugar and Kirkjubæjarklaustur. The Ófærufoss waterfall, a tourist attraction, lies in the main Eldgjá fissure. There used to be an oft-photographed natural bridge at Ófærufoss, which collapsed during the early 1990s. The northern part of Eldgjá, including Ófærufoss, and surrounding areas, have been a part of Vatnajökull National Park since 2011; the entire Eldgjá is since 2010 part of the Katla Geopark. There are information centres and picnic places at Eldgjá.

It consists of a northeast-southwest trending graben with explosion craters, about long. It is wide, deep and part of a larger long chain of offset grabens. The canyon is subdivided into four segments from southwest to northeast. The northeasternmost segment is known as ); the name Eldgjá is usually only applied to the long segment in the middle of the chain, but the 939 eruption also involved other segments. The canyon extends between the Öldufellsjökull glacier of the Myrdalsjökull Ice Cap (the ice cap covers part of the fissure) in the southwest, stretches across mountainous terrain and almost reaches the Vatnajökull Ice Cap to the northeast at Stakafell mountain. It is the longest volcanic fissure in Iceland.

Ground fractures, hornitos, normal faults, lava lakes, pyroclastic cones and spatter ramparts make up the Eldgjá lineament; the cones form alignments and have red-to-gray colours and consist of alternating layers of lava, scoria and spatter, with the scoria and spatter sometimes fused together until they resemble lava flows. There is evidence that the Eldgjá fissure existed before the 930s eruption. Ongoing activity of the fissure can be seen in the form of ground deformation.

The Eldgjá is part of the wider Katla volcano, which features a series of fissures, as well as a caldera covered by the Myrdalsjökull Ice Cap. To the northeast, the lineament runs away from and parallel to that of the 1783-1784 CE Laki eruption fissure, which is part of the Grimsvötn volcano. There are other volcanic centres in the area, some of which had large fissure-fed eruptions within historical memory.

== 10th century eruption ==
The Eldgjá eruption was the largest Holocene eruption of the Katla system, the largest effusive eruption on Earth during the last few millennia, and the only historical eruption of this volcano outside of its caldera. It involved a long area of the volcano, including both the central caldera and the Eldgjá lineament. During the course of the eruption, about 16 episodes of Plinian or subplinian eruptions took place, producing plumes with heights of . These episodes did not occur simultaneously across the entire length of the Eldgjá; rather the eruption commenced in the caldera and propagated northeastward. Intense lava fountaining, explosive eruptions and the effusion of lava took place.

The eruption has been linked to an episode of active continental rifting in the 930s, during which the injection of magma into dykes led to deformation of the ground surface and the evacuation of magmas from the Katla magmatic system. Part of this magma entered into the Katla magma chamber, triggering the release of silicic magmas that form part of the tephra and were at least for some time erupted simultaneously with basaltic magmas. Other volcanoes in Iceland such as Bárðarbunga, Grimsvötn and Reykjanes peninsula erupted at the same time as Eldgjá.

===Dating===
The Eldgjá eruption took place in the 930s, but its exact date had long been uncertain. Early research put its beginning during 934-938. Later research published in 2015 indicated that it began in 939 and likely ended in 940, but may have continued for several years more. Further confusion had been created because the Eldgjá eruption occurred only seven years before the Millennium Eruption of Paektu Mountain on the China–Korea border. Some climatic effects attributed to the Eldgjá eruption may actually have resulted from the Paektu eruption. That eruption, in 946 CE, may have produced only a small amount of sulfate aerosols, far less than Eldgjá. A tephra layer at Katla originally attributed to a 1000 CE eruption is now considered to be part of the Eldgjá eruption.

===Products===
The eruption produced two fields of (mostly pahoehoe) lava flows emanating from the southern and central sectors of the Eldgjá fracture. Flowing through lava tubes, the lava flows were channelled down river valleys and gorges and eventually reached the sea. They cover an area of and with a volume of constitute the largest lava flows of the last 1,100 years. The lavas buried traces of earlier eruptions and obstructed river valleys, forcing the rivers to change their course, and altered the terrain so that large parts of the plains east of Katla can no longer be reached by jökulhlaups (glacier meltwater flood) from the volcano. Rootless cones such as and Iceland&#x27;s largest complex at are linked to lava flows attributed to Eldgjá, although an older date for the latter lavas is possible. Later eruptions from Laki have buried many of the northeastern Eldgjá lava flows.

About dense rock equivalent of mostly basaltic ejecta became of tephra, which was emplaced mainly south and southeast from Eldgjá. The tephra was formed through alternating magmatic and phreatomagmatic processes, and is more complex than common Katla tephras. External water (such as from ice melt) did not play a major role in driving the explosivity of the eruption. Part of the eruption occurred underneath the Katla ice cap; this part also gave rise to the Kriki hyaloclastite on the eastern side of the ice cap, a product of an interaction between lava and ice. The Eldgjá eruption was accompanied by jökulhlaups from the northern, eastern and perhaps also southern part of Myrdalsjökull Ice Cap but the burial of its deposits by later glacier meltwater floods and lavas make it difficult to trace the precise extent of the flood. There is evidence that the inner structure of Katla was permanently altered by the Eldgjá eruption, as eruption rate decreased compared to the rate in the previous two millennia and there have been no meltwater floods on the southern or western side of the volcano since the event.

===Tephra and aerosol emissions===
Both tephra layers and sulfate layers linked to the Eldgjá eruption occur in Greenland, where they have been recorded from ice cores in the form of layers where the ice contains more acids, salts and tiny glass shards. Tephra layers from the eruption have been used to date lake sediments and ice cores in the Northern Hemisphere, volcanic eruptions at Eyjafjallajökull and other Icelandic volcanoes, glacier advances on the island, and events in Viking Age Iceland. 

Large volcanic eruptions can produce veils of aerosols in the atmosphere from sulfur dioxide, which reduce the amount of sunlight reaching Earth&#x27;s surface and alter its climate. Eldgjá produced about of sulfur dioxide, more than that of other well-known historical eruptions (such as Tambora in 1815 and Huaynaputina in 1600) but possibly less than Laki in 1783, as phreatomagmatic activity would have scavenged sulfate from the eruption column. The Eldgjá eruption is the largest volcanic atmospheric pollution event of the last several millennia and traces of platinum erupted by the volcano have been found across the Western Hemisphere, where they have been used to date archaeological sites.

The climate impact of the Eldgjá has been recorded in cave deposits, historical reports, ice cores, tree rings and other environmental records potentially as far south as Australia. Tree rings suggest a cooling of about in the Northern Hemisphere during 940 CE, most pronounced in Alaska, the Canadian Rocky Mountains, Central Asia, Central Europe and Scandinavia; in Canada and Central Asia it lasted until 941 CE. Volcanic aerosols often weaken the monsoons that feed the Nile River in Africa; during 939 the water levels of the river were unusually low. Conversely, increased flooding in Europe after the Eldgjá and other volcanic eruptions during the 10th century have been correlated to declines in Poland&#x27;s &quot;Alnus&quot; trees. Some climate impacts attributed to Eldgjá might have been caused by simultaneous eruptions of other volcanoes, such as Ceboruco in Mexico.

== Human impacts ==

Even though Iceland was already settled at that time and the impacts of the eruption were severe, there are no contemporary historical records of the eruption. Anecdotal reports are recorded in the Book of Settlements, which was written about 200 years later. Events in the poem Völuspá may record the eruption or another eruption of Katla. According to the Book of Settlements, lava flows forced settlers east of Katla off their land; two settlements or farms belonging to at least two settlements in the Álftaver area southeast of Katla had to be abandoned due to damage from lava flows and sources of the 12th century define it a &quot;wasteland&quot;. Tephra covered an area of about on Iceland; of these, were covered with over of tephra and had to be abandoned, while received a tephra cover exceeding and suffered heavy damage as a result. The events and impact of the eruption may have stopped the settlement of the island and could have played a role in stimulating the Christianization of Iceland. However, it is possible that Iceland&#x27;s population at the time was more resilient than during the 18th century and thus the Eldgjá event had less impact than the Laki eruption.

Unlike the local impacts on Iceland, the effects of the Eldgjá eruption on Europe appear in the historical record. Darkened skies were reported from Germany, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain although the interpretation of contemporary reports as referencing atmospheric phenomena linked to the Eldgjá eruption is controversial. Reportedly, winters in Europe and China between 939-942 were severe, with the sea and canals freezing, while droughts occurred during the summer months. Food crises reported in China, the Maghreb, the Levant and Western Europe at that time have been linked to the Eldgjá eruption. More tentatively, the downfall of the Later Jin Dynasty and locust plagues in China, epidemics of animal diseases in Europe and a decrease of human activity on Ireland and rebellions in Japan have been connected to the Eldgjá eruption.

=== Impacts of a repeat ===
Large fissure-fed effusive eruptions in Iceland reoccur every few centuries. The much smaller () 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull caused worldwide disruptions of air travel, with economic losses of over $1 billion for airlines alone, because volcanic ash can interfere with the operation of airplane engines. Additional hazards of a widespread aerosol layer are its corrosive effects on equipment, decreased visibility leading to accidents on the sea, as well as health hazards resulting from the aerosols. The impact could extend to North Africa.

<doc id="690560" wikidata="Q6291777" url="?curid=690560" title="José Campeche">
<text>José Campeche y Jordán (December 23, 1751 – November 7, 1809), is the first known Puerto Rican visual artist and considered by art critics as one of the best rococo artists in the Americas. Campeche y Jordán loved to use colors that referenced the landscape of Puerto Rico, as well as the social and political crème de la crème.

== Early life ==
Campeche was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico. His parents were Tomás Campeche (1701–1780) and María Jordán y Marqués. His father was a freed slave born in Puerto Rico and his mother was a native of the Canary Islands so he was considered to be . His father was a gilder who restored and painted religious statues, and had an influence on the young Campeche&#x27;s interest in the arts. Campeche was trained by Luis Paret y Alcázar, a Spanish court painter banished from Spain.

== Paintings ==
Campeche distinguished himself with his paintings related to religious themes and of governors and other important figures. His most famous paintings and his best known portraits are of:
* &quot;Juan Alejo de Arizmendi&quot;
* &quot;Our Lady of Bethlehem&quot;
* &quot;Portrait of Brigadier don Ramón de Castro y Gutiérrez&quot;
* &quot;Portrait of Governor don Miguel de Ustariz&quot;
* &quot;Saint John the Baptist&quot;
* &quot;The Bishop of San Francisco de la Cuerda&quot;
* &quot;The Rescue of Don Ramón Power y Giralt&quot; in honor of Ramón Power y Giralt
* &quot;The Sacred Family&quot;
* &quot;The Virgin of the Rosary&quot;
* &quot;The Vision of Saint Anthony&quot;
* &quot;Virgen de la Soledad de la Victoria&quot;
* &quot;Doña María de los Dolores Gutiérrez del Mazo y Pérez&quot;, ca. 1796.


==Importance==
Not only did the Puerto Rican society of the time appreciate Campeche&#x27;s personal and artistic merits but he is now considered to be amongst the most gifted rococo artists in the Americas. His works of art can be found in museums, churches and chapels, such as Capilla del Cristo in San Juan, and in private collections in Puerto Rico and Venezuela. Campeche died in the city of San Juan on November 7, 1809.

High-resolution images of works of art from Puerto Rico&#x27;s museums are being digitized and made available online with the help of the Institute, Google Arts &amp; Culture, Lin Manuel Miranda and other stakeholders. 350 such works were available online by November 7, 2019 including many works by José Campeche.

== Commemorations ==
* There is a &quot;José Campeche room&quot; in the former Dominican Convent in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico, where some of his works can be seen. The building is currently being renovated and will be reinaugurated as the National Gallery of Puerto Rico.
* Puerto Rico has various schools and avenues named after Campeche to honor his memory. The José Campeche High School is located in San Lorenzo.
* Manuel Gregorio Tavárez composed a funeral march &quot;Redención&quot; in Campeche&#x27;s honor.
* Puerto Rican graphic artist Lorenzo Homar also created a work of art commemorating Campeche.
* Campeche is buried in the San José Church in Old San Juan.

<text>A play-action pass (also known as a play fake or simply &quot;play-action&quot;) is an American football play. The play action starts with what appears to be a running play, but turns out to be a pass play; in this way, it can be considered the opposite of a draw play. Play-action passes are often used against defenses that are focused on stopping the run. By initially simulating a running play, the offense attempts to deceive the defense into acting on the fake run placing them out of position in their pass coverage, and giving receivers more time and room to be free to receive passes behind the linebackers.

==Offensive action during a play-action pass==
*The quarterback takes the snap and drops back to hand off to the running back.
*The running back gets ready to take the hand off.
*The quarterback quickly pulls the ball back from the hand off position, trying to hide it from the defense. He then looks downfield for an open receiver.
*The running back continues to move up field as if he has the ball in his hands.
*The offensive line comes off the ball to run block, but then goes into pass protection.
*The receivers &quot;sell&quot; the running play by appearing to block at first, then break off into their pass routes.

==Use==
Despite being one of the most effective kinds of plays, the play-action pass is not proportionately used. The belief is that a heavy running game must be maintained, but in fact even teams who heavily lean on passes have high success with the play-action.
==See also==
* Flea-flicker — a type of play-action pass.
* Halfback option play — Like the play-action, but retains an option to actually run
* Draw play — the opposite of a play-action, where a pass play is faked when it&#x27;s actually a run.

<text>Fraunces Tavern is a museum and restaurant in New York City, situated at 54 Pearl Street at the corner of Broad Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan. The location played a prominent role in history before, during, and after the American Revolution. At various points in its history, Fraunces Tavern served as a headquarters for George Washington, a venue for peace negotiations with the British, and housing federal offices in the Early Republic.

Fraunces Tavern has been owned since 1904 by Sons of the Revolution in the State of New York Inc., which carried out a major conjectural reconstruction, and claim it is Manhattan&#x27;s oldest surviving building. The museum interprets the building and its history, along with varied exhibitions of art and artifacts. The tavern is a tourist site and a part of the American Whiskey Trail and the New York Freedom Trail. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a New York City designated landmark. In addition, the block on which Fraunces Tavern is located is a National Historic Landmark District and a New York City designated landmark district.

==Early history==

===Pre-Revolutionary history===
New York Mayor Stephanus van Cortlandt built his home in 1671 on the site, but retired to his manor on the Hudson River and gave the property in 1700 to his son-in-law, Étienne &quot;Stephen&quot; DeLancey, a French Huguenot who had married Van Cortlandt&#x27;s daughter, Anne. The DeLancey family contended with the Livingston family for leadership of the Province of New York.

DeLancey built the current building as a house in 1719. The small yellow bricks used in its construction were imported from the Dutch Republic and the sizable mansion ranked highly in the province for its quality. His heirs sold the building in 1762 to Samuel Fraunces who converted the home into the popular tavern, first named the Queen&#x27;s Head, and periodically known as Boltons Tavern or The Coffee House.

Before the American Revolution, the building was one of the meeting places of the secret society, the Sons of Liberty. During the tea crisis caused by the British Parliament&#x27;s passage of the Tea Act 1773, the Patriots forced a British naval captain who tried to bring tea to New York to give a public apology at the building. The Patriots, disguised as American Indians (like those of the Boston Tea Party), then dumped the ship&#x27;s tea cargo into New York Harbor.

In 1768, the New York Chamber of Commerce was founded by a meeting in the building. On June 13, 1771, King George III of Great Britain granted a royal charter to establish &quot;The Society of the New York Hospital in the City of New York in America&quot; and a Board of Governors for the &quot;reception of such patients as require medical treatment, chirurgical management and maniacs.&quot; The first regular meeting of the Board of Governors of what is now known as NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital was held at Fraunces Tavern on July 24, 1771.

===Revolution===
In August 1775, Americans, principally the &#x27;Hearts of Oak&#x27; – a student militia of King&#x27;s College, of which Alexander Hamilton was a member – took possession of cannons from the artillery battery at the southern point of Manhattan and fired on HMS &quot;Asia&quot;. The British Royal Navy ship retaliated by firing a 32-gun broadside on the city, sending a cannonball through the roof of the building.

In September 1780, Jane Tuers, a local farmer from across the Hudson River in Bergen Township, New Jersey (now Jersey City), stopped into the tavern while selling her goods and spoke with Samuel Fraunces. He informed Tuers that British soldiers had been in the tavern toasting General Benedict Arnold, who was to deliver West Point to the British. Tuers returned to Bergen later that day and informed her brother Daniel Van Reypen about the conspiracy. Van Reypen rode to Hackensack, New Jersey to meet with General Anthony Wayne who then sent Van Reypen to inform General Washington of the conspiracy. The information provided by Tuers confirmed what Washington had suspected of Arnold and led to the arrest, trial, conviction and hanging of co-conspirator John André for treason and stopped the plot to surrender West Point. Arnold would later defect to the British to escape prosecution.

When the war was all but won, the building was the site of &quot;British-American Board of Inquiry&quot; meetings, which negotiated to ensure to American leaders that no &quot;American property&quot; (meaning former slaves who were emancipated by the British for their military service) be allowed to leave with British troops. Led by Brigadier General Samuel Birch, board members reviewed the evidence and testimonies that were given by freed slaves every Wednesday from April to November 1783, and British representatives were successful in ensuring that almost all of the loyalist black people of New York maintained their liberty and could be evacuated with the &quot;Redcoats&quot; when they left if so desired. Through this process, Birch created the Book of Negroes.

====Washington&#x27;s farewell to his officers====

A week after British troops had evacuated New York on November 25, 1783, the tavern hosted an elaborate &quot;turtle feast&quot; dinner, on December 4, 1783, in the building&#x27;s Long Room for U.S. Gen. George Washington during which he bade farewell to his officers of the Continental Army by saying &quot;[w]ith a heart full of love and gratitude, I now take leave of you. I most devoutly wish that your latter days may be as prosperous and happy as your former ones have been glorious and honorable.&quot; After his farewell, he took each one of his officers by the hand for a personal word.

===Post-Revolution===
In January 1785, New York City became the seat of the Confederation Congress, the nation&#x27;s central government under the &quot;Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union.&quot; The departments of Foreign Affairs, Finance and War had their offices at Fraunces Tavern.

With the ratification of the United States Constitution in March 1789, the Confederation Congress&#x27;s departments became federal departments, and New York City became the first official national capital. The inauguration of George Washington as first President of the United States took place in April 1789. Under the July 1789 Residence Act, Congress moved the national capital to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for a 10-year period, while the permanent national capital was under construction in what is now Washington, D.C. The federal departments vacated their offices in the building and moved to Philadelphia in 1790.

==19th and 20th centuries==

The building operated throughout much of the 19th century, but suffered several serious fires beginning in 1832. Having been rebuilt several times, the structure&#x27;s appearance was changed to the extent that the original building design is not known. The building was owned by Malvina Keteltas in the early 1800s. Ernst Buermeyer and his family leased part of the property in 1845 and ran a hotel called the Broad Street House at this location until 1860. After a disastrous fire in 1852, two stories were added, making the Tavern a total of five stories high. In 1890, the taproom was lowered to street level and the first floor exterior was remodeled, and its original timbers sold as souvenirs. The Manhattan local society of the National Society of the Children of the American Revolution is located at Fraunces Tavern. As of 2020, the Senior Society President is Ms. Elsye Richardson.

=== Restoration ===
In 1900, the tavern was slated for demolition by its owners, who reportedly wanted to use the land for a parking lot. A number of organizations, most notably the Daughters of the American Revolution, worked to preserve it, and convinced New York state government leaders to use their power of eminent domain and designate the building as a park (which was the only clause of the municipal ordinances that could be used for protection, as laws were not in place at the time for the subject of &quot;historic preservation&quot;, then in its infancy). The temporary designation was later rescinded when the property was acquired in 1904 by the Sons of the Revolution In the State of New York Inc., primarily with funds willed by Frederick Samuel Tallmadge, the grandson of Benjamin Tallmadge, George Washington&#x27;s chief of intelligence during the Revolution (a plaque depicting Tallmadge is affixed to the building). An extensive reconstruction was completed in 1907 under the supervision of early historic preservation architect, William Mersereau. A guide book of the era called the tavern &quot;the most famous building in New York&quot;.

Historian Randall Gabrielan wrote in 2000 that &quot;Mersereau claimed his remodeling of Fraunces Tavern was faithful to the original, but the design was controversial in his time. There was no argument over removing the upper stories, which were known to have been added during the building&#x27;s 19th-century commercial use, but adding the hipped roof was questioned. He used the Philipse Manor House in Yonkers, New York as a style guide and claimed to follow the roof line of the original, as found during construction, traced on the bricks of an adjoining building.&quot; Architects Norval White and Elliot Willensky wrote in 2000 that the building was &quot;a highly conjectural reconstruction – not a restoration – based on &#x27;typical&#x27; buildings of &#x27;the period,&#x27; parts of remaining walls, and a lot of guesswork.&quot; Daniela Salazar at the website &quot;Untapped New York&quot; agrees, stating that the &quot;reconstruction was extremely speculative, and resulted in an almost entirely new construction&quot;.

The building was declared a landmark in 1965 by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, and the surrounding city block bounded by Pearl Street, Water Street, Broad Street and Coenties Slip was included on November 14, 1978. The National Park Service added the surrounding city block to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on April 28, 1977, and the building was added to the NRHP on March 6, 2008.

===Bombing===
A bomb planted in the tavern exploded on January 24, 1975, killing four people and injuring more than 50 others. The Puerto Rican clandestine paramilitary organization &quot;Fuerzas Armadas de Liberación Nacional Puertorriqueña&quot; (Armed Forces of Puerto Rican National Liberation, or FALN), which had executed other bomb incidents in New York in the 1970s, claimed responsibility. No one had been prosecuted for the bombing as of 2022.

In a note police found in a phone booth nearby, the FALN wrote, &quot;we … take full responsibility for the especially detornated (sic) bomb that exploded today at Fraunces Tavern, with reactionary corporate executives inside.&quot; The note claimed the bomb – roughly 10 pounds of dynamite that had been crammed into an attaché case and slipped into the tavern&#x27;s entrance hallway – was retaliation for the &quot;CIA ordered bomb&quot; that killed three and injured 11 in a restaurant in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico, two weeks earlier.

==Recent uses==

Since 1907, the Fraunces Tavern Museum on the second and third floors has helped to interpret the Fraunces Tavern and the collection of artifacts that it holds. The museum comprises nine galleries: John Ward Dunsmore collection of painted scenes of the American revolution; the Elizabeth and Stanley DeForest Scott gallery of portraits of George Washington; the Long Room, the site of General George Washington&#x27;s famous farewell dinner; the Clinton Room, a recreation of a federalist style dining room; the McEntee Gallery, depicting the history of the Sons of the Revolution; the Davis Education Center (Flag Gallery); and a number of other galleries and spaces used for periodic exhibitions. In 2014, for example, the museum exhibited 27 maps from the 1700 and 1800s, including a never before seen map from 1804 depicting the United States&#x27; postal routes.

The building served as the location of the General Society, Sons of the Revolution (a heritage organization similar to and competing with the &quot;Sons of the American Revolution&quot;) office until 2002, when the General Society moved to Independence, Missouri. The Fraunces Tavern Museum maintains several galleries of art and artifacts about the Revolution including the McEntee &quot;Sons of the Revolution&quot; Gallery that displays much of the history of the Society.

<text>The Seattle Asian Art Museum (often abbreviated to SAAM) is a museum of Asian art at Volunteer Park in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, United States. Part of the Seattle Art Museum, the SAAM exhibits historic and contemporary artworks from China, Korea, Japan, India, the Himalayas, and other Southeast Asian countries. It also features an education center, conservation center, and library. The museum is located in the 1933 Art Deco building which was originally home to the Seattle Art Museum&#x27;s main collection. In 1991 the main collection moved to a newly constructed Seattle Art Museum building in the downtown area. The Seattle Asian Art Museum opened in 1994.

== About ==
The SAAM is organized thematically, with art and objects grouped by their relationship to themes including &quot;spirituality, worship, celebration, visual arts, literature, clothing, nature and the power of birth and death.&quot; The museum&#x27;s permanent collection spans thirteen galleries. There is one large gallery reserved for special exhibitions which changes every six months.

== History ==
The Seattle Art Museum was founded in 1933 by Richard E. Fuller, a collector of Asian art. Sixty years later, in 1993, the main Seattle Art Museum announced that it would open an Asian art museum at its original Volunteer Park location. A reception, held November 1993 as part of the APEC Summit, was attended by the leaders of East Asian nations and 400 guests. The SAAM officially opened to the public on August 13, 1994, during a ceremony attended by 6,000 visitors.

The museum houses an Asian Paintings Conservation Center.

==Architecture==

The Seattle Asian Art Museum is housed in a historic Art Deco building designed in 1933 by Carl F. Gould of the architectural firm Bebb and Gould. From 1933 to 1991, the building served as the home of the Seattle Art Museum and its main collection. After the main collection moved to a new museum in Downtown Seattle, the building underwent an early renovation in the 1990s at a cost of $5.2 million. The Gould building was designated a Seattle landmark in 1989, and officially added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2016.

The museum underwent a major expansion project, starting in 2017, that was spurred by the need to upgrade the building&#x27;s HVAC system, freight elevator, and seismic resistance. The project was funded by a mixture of public and private donations and included preservation of the museum&#x27;s historic Art Deco facade, infrastructure upgrades, climate control and seismic system improvements, as well as the addition of new gallery and education spaces. Seattle-based firm LMN Architects was responsible for design of a US$56 million renovation and expansion of the building. Construction on the renovation project began with a ceremonial groundbreaking on March 13, 2018. The museum closed for three years for the major renovation, from February 2017 until February 2020. The new three-story wing is constructed principally out of glass and sandstone in a minimalist style.

== Collection ==
The Seattle Asian Art Museum holds a permanent collection of Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Indian, Himalayan, and Southeast Asian art. The museum continues to grow its collection of art &quot;centered around historic, modern, and contemporary Asian Pacific Islander as well as Southeast Asian art, specifically collecting different works created by local Asian Pacific Islander artists within the Seattle area.&quot;

The collection holds the artwork entitled &quot;Some/One&quot; by South Korean sculptor Do-Ho Suh in the form of a suit of armor made of thousands of military IDs, or dog-tags. South Korean ceramic artist Yoon Kwang-cho is also represented in the collection.

<text>Allison Joy Langer, Countess of Devon (born May 22, 1974), commonly known by her stage name A. J. Langer, is an American actress. She is most known for playing Rayanne Graff on the television series &quot;My So-Called Life&quot; and &quot;Caroline Larkin&quot; on Baywatch.

==Early years==
Born in Columbus, Ohio, Allison Joy Langer moved to the San Fernando Valley with her family at age five. When she joined an otherwise all-boys baseball league at age eight, her teammates considered the name &quot;Allison&quot; to be too feminine, and began calling her by her initials, &quot;A.J.&quot; She has one older brother, Kirk.

==Career==
After many guest starring roles on several television shows, including &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;, and her first series regular in &quot;Drexell&#x27;s Class&quot;, Langer was cast as Rayanne Graff on &quot;My So-Called Life&quot;. She also starred as a series regular in the sitcoms &quot;It&#x27;s Like, You Know...&quot; and &quot;Three Sisters&quot;, as well as the drama series &quot;Eyes&quot;. Her film appearances include John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot; and Wes Craven&#x27;s horror film &quot;The People Under the Stairs&quot;.

In 2011, after a six-year acting hiatus, Langer appeared in 14 episodes of &quot;Private Practice&quot; in the recurring role of Erica Warner. She left the show in 2012 following the death of her character.

==Personal life==
Langer married attorney Charles Courtenay, the son of Hugh Courtenay, 18th Earl of Devon, in a civil ceremony in 2004. A formal wedding took place on April 30, 2005, in Los Angeles.

Until the death of her father-in-law, Langer held the courtesy title of Lady Courtenay. Following his death, and upon her husband&#x27;s succession as 19th Earl of Devon, she assumed the title of Countess of Devon. In January 2014, she and her husband permanently relocated their family to London, and to the family seat at Powderham Castle in May 2015. The couple announced their separation, and intention to divorce, in November 2023. In February 2024, the couple filed to dismiss their earlier divorce application.

The couple have two children, a daughter and a son:
* Lady Joscelyn Skye Courtenay
* Jack Haydon Langer Courtenay, Lord Courtenay

In her spare time, Langer raises awareness and money for the research and treatment of fibromyalgia, from which she herself suffers.

<text>Hvítárvatn (, &quot;white river lake&quot;; also known as Hvítárlón , &quot;white river lagoon&quot;) is a lake in the Highlands of Iceland and the source of the glacial river Hvítá, Árnessýsla. It is located northeast of Gullfoss waterfall. Its surface is about and its greatest depth is . It lies at an elevation of .

There are some rivers and lakes with the Icelandic adjective &quot;hvítur&quot; (white) in their name. This is explained by the source of most of Iceland&#x27;s freshwater, originating from glaciers which make the water light in colour.

<text>A bounty is a payment or reward of money to locate, capture or kill an outlaw or a wanted person. Two modern examples of bounties are the ones placed for the capture of Saddam Hussein and his sons by the United States government and Microsoft&#x27;s bounty for computer virus creators. Those who make a living by pursuing bounties are known as bounty hunters.

Bounties have also been granted for other actions, such as exports under mercantilism.

==Examples==
===Historical examples===
Written promises of reward for the capture of or information regarding criminals go back to at least the first-century Roman Empire. Graffiti from Pompeii, a Roman city destroyed by a volcanic eruption in 79 AD, contained this message:
A copper pot went missing from my shop. Anyone who returns it to me will be given 65 bronze coins (&quot;sestertii&quot;). Twenty more will be given for information leading to the capture of the thief.

A bounty system was used in the American Civil War as an incentive to increase enlistments. Unscrupulous bounty jumpers would receive a bounty, then desert. 

Another bounty system was used in New South Wales to increase the number of immigrants from 1832.
Bounties were sometimes paid as rewards for killing Native Americans. In 1862, a farmer received a bounty for shooting Taoyateduta (Little Crow). In 1856, Governor Isaac Stevens put a bounty on the head of Indians from eastern Washington, for ordinary Indians and for a chief. A western Washington Indian, Patkanim, chief of the Snohomish, obligingly provided a great many heads, until the territorial auditor put a stop to the practice due to the dubious origins of the deceased.

In Australia in 1824, a bounty of of land was offered for capturing alive the Wiradjuri warrior Windradyne, the leader of the Aboriginal resistance movement in the Bathurst Wars. A week after the bounty was offered, the word &quot;alive&quot; was dropped from the reward notices, but he was neither captured nor betrayed by his people.

Bounties have been offered on animals deemed undesirable by particular governments or corporations. In Tasmania, the thylacine was relentlessly hunted to extinction based on such schemes. Gray wolves, too, were extirpated from much of the present United States by bounty hunters. An example of the legal sanction granted can be found in a Massachusetts Bay Colony law dated May 7, 1662: &quot;This Court doth Order, &quot;as an encouragement to persons to destroy Woolves&quot;, That henceforth every person killing any Woolf, shall be allowed out of the Treasury of that County where such woolf was slain, Twenty shillings, and by the Town Ten shillings, and by the County Treasurer Ten shillings: which the Constable of each Town (on the sight of the ears of such Woolves being cut off) shall pay out of the next County rate, which the Treasurer shall allow.&quot;

===17th-century examples===
Since after the Stuart Restoration, criminality was increasing, the dissatisfaction with the penal system led to the implementation of the rewards. £10 were promised to anyone who gave information about a robber or burglar and a pardon was also granted to convicts able to provide evidence against their accomplices. Between 1660 and 1692, Parliament introduced a series of statutes that offered rewards up to £40. Under William III, the rewards became a systematic element in the fight against crime, an alternative to erase the most dangerous threats to the community. The first example of permanent reward was in 1692, when £40 (together with the offender&#x27;s horse, arms, and money) were offered for the discovery and the conviction of offenders who committed serious property crimes – highway robbery, burglary and housebreaking, coining, and other offences. The trial judges became fundamental to the administration of the rewards system because the statutes put them in charge of apportioning the reward among the persons who claimed to have participated in procuring the conviction. As it was written in the legislation of 1692, &quot;...in case any Dispute shall happen to arise between the persons so apprehending any the said Thieves and Robbers touching their right and title to the said Reward that then the said Judge or Justices so respectively certifying as aforesaid shall in and by their said Certificate direct and appoint the said Reward to be paid unto and amongst the Parties claimeing the same in such share and proportions as to the said Judge or Justices shall seem just and reasonable&quot;

===18th-century examples===
In the 18th century, the English government episodically offered rewards by proclamation; in 1720, a royal proclamation offered bounties for the unmasking of murderers or highway robbers, sometimes worth as much as £100. When a statutory reward overlapped a proclamation, prosecuting or convicting of a highway robber could be worth £140 a head (£100 under proclamation, £40 by statute), £240 for a pair or £420 for a three-person group. These were huge sums at the time when an artisan earned about £20 and a labourer less than £15 per year. Supplementary reward was part of the administration of the law for six years, then with the death of George I, it came to an end. After two years, in February 1728, a new proclamation reinstated the £100 reward by respecting the original terms. Private parties were also free to offer rewards in addition to rewards by proclamations, then this practice was taken up by governmental departments and local authorities. In 1716, Robert Griffith was indicted for stealing from Thomas Brooks, one silver watch, value £51, and one gold watch, value £18, from Mary Smith. She offered a reward of £15 to anyone who gave information about the robber. The reward was received by Mr. Holder, after he brought Mrs. Smith the silver watch that was stolen. In 1732, Henry Carey offered a reward of 2 guineas for the securing of Richard Marshall, and three more for his conviction. Marshall, together with Mary Horsenail and Amy Mason, were indicted for breaking and entering the house of Mr. Carey in Dorrington-street. They were also indicted for robbery. Marshall was secured by Mr. Parker, that received the 2-guinea reward as promised. Australian bushranger Ned Kelly held the most wanted bounty of the 1800s, for £8000; Ned was wanted dead or alive.

===Rewards and thief-takers===
In creating incentives to overcome criminality, the rewards system risked overincentivizing. This led to the development of the profession of thief-taker. They were part of the criminal underworld, but they were seen as offering an advantageous service to the state. Victims of theft in London, facilitated by the circulation of newspapers, took advantage of advertising to recover their stolen goods. They offered a reward &quot;with no questions asked&quot;. Since prosecutors usually resorted to the legal system, they had to pay for the proceedings at the Old Bailey; though the offender was convicted, they often lost their goods forever. For this reason, prosecutors decided to bypass the legal system, recovering their goods by resorting to advertising. Thief-takers were the perfect intermediates between victims and offenders and received a portion of the reward offered. Jonathan Wild, a prominent figure of the underworld, successfully combined thief-taking with the activity of simplifying the return of stolen goods by paying rewards to the thieves. In the early 1720s, he controlled London&#x27;s underworld, but his activity became a threat to the community and the integrity of the penal system. In 1725, Wild was accused of stealing 50 yards (46 m) of lace, valued at £40, from the shop of a blind woman, Catherine Statham. He admitted accepting a reward of 10 guineas from Mrs. Statham for helping her to recover the stolen lace. He was acquitted of the first charge but with Mrs. Statham&#x27;s evidence presented against him on the second charge he was convicted and sentenced to death.

===Fictional representations===
The figure of Jonathan Wild inspired the character of Mr. Peachum in &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;, a satirical ballad opera in three acts written in 1728 by John Gay. Peachum controls a large group of thieves, and is connected to the government and courts. Because of these connections, he can decide whether to allow a captured criminal to be hanged (in that case he receives a reward) or to be released. In scene II, Peachum gives evidence against another member of his gang, Tom Gagg, in exchange for a reward of £40. Then in scene IV, Mrs. Peachum, Peachum&#x27;s wife, enters and inquires about Bob Booty, her favorite member of the gang. Peachum will accept a £40 reward for allowing Bob to be hanged.

Steve McQueen played bounty hunter Josh Randall in the Western television series &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot; (1958–1961).

The &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe features many bounty hunters, with the most famous examples being Boba Fett and Din Djarin.

Two films directed by Quentin Tarantino, &quot;Django Unchained&quot; and &quot;The Hateful Eight&quot;, focus on the stories of bounty hunters in the United States in the mid to late 1800s.

===21st-century examples===
The majority of prisoners held in Guantánamo Bay detainment camp were handed over by bounty hunters.

The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston offered a $5 million reward for the return, in good condition, of the 13 works of art taken from its galleries in March 1990.

==Other uses==

===Mathematics===
The term &quot;bounty&quot; is used in mathematics to refer to a reward offered to any person willing to take on an open problem. Bounties are offered for solving a particular math problem – ranging from small lemmas that graduate students solve in their spare time to some of the world&#x27;s hardest math problems. Paul Erdős was famous for offering mathematical bounties.

===Economics===
In economics the term &quot;bounty&quot; has often been used in the sense of a negative tax.

===Open-source software===
In the computer science and open-source community, bounty refers to a reward offered to any person or project willing to solve open problems, for instance, implementing a feature or finding a bug in an open-source software program (open-source bounty). For instance, the Mozilla Foundation offers bounties for security bug hunting. Bounty-driven development is one of the business models for open-source software.

Bounties can also be awarded for non-technical contributions, such as for adding relevant information or digital media to a repository. On Wikipedia, one of several ways to incentivize users to expand articles is by offering rewards via the in exchange for a specified contribution. Bounties on the Reward board are provided by the requesting Wikipedia user and both monetary and non-monetary rewards are permitted. Wikipedia, and other open-source projects, place guidelines on compensation to maintain and reliability.

===Poker===

In poker tournaments, a money bounty is awarded for knocking a player out of the tournament. Some tournaments offer a bounty for any eliminated player, while others offer them only for certain players, usually well-known professional players, sometimes celebrities.

===Cryptocurrency===
In cryptocurrency, bounty campaign is a popular marketing tool used widely to support the launch of a new cryptocurrency, new dApp game or a new blockchain platform. In a bounty campaign, participants receive small amounts of cryptocurrency tokens in exchange for providing social media engagement (for instance, tweeting and retweeting) or for creating promotional materials (such as YouTube videos).

===Motorsport===

Often, if a driver or team has won multiple consecutive races, a race track or sanctioning body will establish a bounty on a team. This practice is common on local short tracks, especially if a driver has won three consecutive weeks or more. The bounty often is increased for every race the offending driver or team continues to win, and is claimed upon another driver or team ending that winning streak. After Chip Ganassi Racing won six consecutive Rolex Sports Car Series races, Grand American Road Racing Association established a bounty to the team that beats Ganassi. On May 14, 2011, Action Express Racing defeated Ganassi, and claimed the bounty.

After Kyle Busch won six consecutive NASCAR Gander RV &amp; Outdoors Truck Series races over a two-season span, driver Kevin Harvick and series sponsor Camping World Holdings placed a $100,000 bounty to a full-time Cup Series driver that defeats Busch in one of the remaining four races Busch is eligible to participate. Numerous Cup Series drivers announced plans to enter the $100,000 bounty races. On the first race of the four on May 26, 2020, Chase Elliott claimed the bounty in defeating Busch at the North Carolina Education Lottery 200. Harvick and Camping World will donate the bounty to COVID-19 relief efforts. A separate bounty had been planned by Halmar International, a sponsor on a Kyle Busch Motorsports truck, for $50,000 if a Truck Series regular defeated Busch, but that was cancelled because the sponsor used the money for COVID-19 relief efforts.

===American football===

Bounties, referring to bonuses for in-game performance, are officially banned by the National Football League, the sport&#x27;s dominant professional league. Despite this, bounties have had a significant history within the sport. Notable examples include a 1989 game between the Dallas Cowboys and Philadelphia Eagles that became known as the Bounty Bowl, and a bounty scheme organized by players and coaches with the New Orleans Saints that was uncovered in 2012, leading to substantial penalties.

===Recruitment===
Bounty is also used to refer to bonus payments made to staff on recruitment (or for recommending others for recruitment). This practice used to be common in the military (it was standard practice in the British Army during the 19th century), but has since been largely phased out, only to become relatively widespread amongst civilian employers. Many reserve armed forces also pay a retention &quot;bounty&quot; to personnel who meet or exceed participation and training thresholds.

<text>Samuel Joseph Dash (February 27, 1925 – May 29, 2004) was an American lawyer. He was chief counsel for the Senate Watergate Committee during the Watergate scandal. Dash became famous for his televised interrogations during the hearings held by the United States Congress on the Watergate incident.

== Early life and education ==
Dash was born in Camden, New Jersey, to Joseph and Ida Dash (originally Dashevsky), Jewish immigrants from the Soviet Union. His family later moved to Philadelphia.

He graduated from Central High School in Philadelphia and went on to study at Temple University. While in high school he was the president of the Interscholastic League of Student Associations. He interrupted his studies when at the age of 18, with the United States engaged in fighting World War II, Dash enlisted in the Army Air Corps and served as a bombardier navigator, flying missions over Italy. After the war, he finished his undergraduate degree at Temple University in 1947. Dash then studied at Harvard Law School where he gained his degree in 1950.

== Career ==
In 1955, Dash became a district attorney in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He later went into private practice.

Dash became a law professor at Georgetown University, where he was working when he was asked to help United States Senator Sam Ervin, head of the Senate Committee charged to investigate the possible involvement of President Richard Nixon in the burglary of offices used by the Democratic Party at the Watergate Hotel in Washington, D.C., and the effort to obstruct investigation of the burglary. The university gave Dash a leave of absence to do this work, and he became the committee&#x27;s chief counsel.

Two decades later, Dash was again in the news, after resigning his post as ethics adviser to independent counsel Kenneth Starr. After working for the investigation for four years, Dash resigned to protest Starr&#x27;s appearance before the United States House Committee on the Judiciary. Dash thought that Starr was acting as an &quot;aggressive advocate&quot; instead of an impartial investigator. 

Dash returned to Georgetown, where, for nearly 40 years, he taught criminal procedure. In 1976, he was elected to the Common Cause National Governing Board. Shortly before his death, he published &quot;The Intruders: Unreasonable Searches and Seizures from King John to John Ashcroft&quot;, which discusses the risks to freedom in modern society, particularly in the wake of the PATRIOT Act.

== Death ==
Dash died in Washington, D.C., of congestive heart failure, aged 79, on the same day as Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor for the Watergate scandal.

== Media appearances ==
 
* In the WETA-TV 2-part special &quot;Summer of Judgment: The Watergate Hearings&quot; in 1983, marking 10 years after the hearings.

* In Episode 4 of the TV adaptation of &quot;Slow Burn&quot; Season 1 on the Watergate hearings (via archival footage).

<doc id="690624" wikidata="Q7458185" url="?curid=690624" title="Seward Park, Seattle">
<text>Seward Park is a neighborhood in southeastern Seattle, Washington, just west of Seward Park. It is part of Seattle&#x27;s South End. The park occupies all of Bailey Peninsula.

==Neighborhood==
The neighborhood is bounded on the east and north by Lake Washington, on the south by South Kenyon Street, and on the west by the eastern boundaries of Columbia City, one of Seattle&#x27;s oldest neighborhoods.

==Environment==
The 300 acres (121 ha) of Seward Park has about a 120 acre (48.6 ha) surviving remnant of old-growth forest, providing a glimpse of what some of the lake shore looked like before the growth of the city of Seattle. With trees older than 250 years, the Seward Park forest is relatively young (the forests of Seattle before the city were fully mature, up to 1,000–2,000 years old). The park&#x27;s trees largely consists of softwoods, mostly Douglas firs, but with other species present as well, including Western hemlock, Pacific madrona and Alaskan cedar.

One of the earliest settlers, E. A. Clark, was influential in the life of Cheshiahud, a young man at the time, the mid-1850s.

The Seward Park neighborhood includes what may be one of the highest residential hills in Seattle (the hill is traversed by Graham Street near its high point, thus earning it the name &quot;Graham hill&quot;). In a series of annexations, the neighborhood joined the City of Seattle in 1907.

==Education==
Although no schools fall within the borders of the neighborhood as described on city maps, three public schools, Graham Hill and Hawthorne and Dunlap elementary schools serve the area&#x27;s students. In addition the alternative Orca K-8 lies within blocks of the neighborhood&#x27;s boundary.

== Jewish Community ==
Seward Park is home to the largest concentration of Orthodox Jews in the Seattle area. Established after the Jewish community of the Central District relocated en masse in the early 1960s, the eruv-bound neighborhood has five synagogues and a Kollel, and its main thoroughfare becomes a family parade on Shabbat and holidays. The state’s oldest Ashkenazi Orthodox congregation, Bikur Cholim Machzikay-Hadath (BCMH), runs a campus that includes the local mikveh, a summer camp, and the girls’ high school Derech Emunah. Seward Park also contains two congregations - Sephardic Bikur Holim, which follows Turkish tradition, and Congregation Ezra Bessaroth, from the Island of Rhodes - which anchor Seattle’s Sephardic population, the third largest community in the country.

<doc id="690627" wikidata="Q3203183" url="?curid=690627" title="Moving Mars">
<text>Moving Mars is a science fiction novel written by Greg Bear. Published in 1993, it won the 1994 Nebula Award for Best Novel, and was also nominated for the 1994 Hugo, Locus, and John W. Campbell Memorial Awards, each in the same category. The main focus of &quot;Moving Mars&quot; is the coming of age and development of Casseia Majumdar, the narrator, as political tensions over revolutionary scientific discoveries build between Earth and Martian factions, and Mars tries to unify itself.

== Background ==

=== Martian politics ===
The &quot;Triple&quot; is the combined economy of Earth, the Moon, and Mars. On Mars the first colonists formed families, which developed into larger family-units called Binding Multiples (BMs). The BMs were fashioned after the Lunar system, and are being threatened to be toppled out of power by Statists, people who want a unified Mars under a centralized government. The Earth wants Mars to unify in order to improve trade within the Triple, but many Martians prefer their independence, and see the Earth&#x27;s proposal as a thinly-veiled attempt at control.

=== Thinkers ===
Thinkers are artificial intelligences given human traits that allow them to have conversations with people. The most advanced are Quantum Logic Thinkers, or QL Thinkers, which are hugely intelligent, but whose thought processes (based on quantum mechanics) are somewhat alien to most people. Thinkers are used in many disciplines, although almost all Thinkers are manufactured on Earth, giving Earth leverage over Mars.

== Plot ==
A small number of students, who are angry at the breaking of their contract with the University of Mars, Sinai, start a protest and plan to storm the university. Although the attempted coup ends in a stalemate, a protester, Casseia Majumdar, establishes her position. The story picks up again a few years later when Casseia is more mature. She does not necessarily regret her actions in the attempted revolution, but continues to be haunted by their consequences, especially her love affair with fellow student Charles Franklin.

Casseia eventually emerges as a fledgling politician in her BM, and wins a trip to Earth with her BM&#x27;s representative and the BM&#x27;s Thinker to discuss the situation between Earth and Mars, which is getting increasingly worse. Meanwhile, Charles, her one-time lover, along with a team of super-geniuses called the Olympians, discovers a radical new technology that has the potential to turn the tables on the conflict. He theorizes that the universe is basically a large computer and discovers a way to &quot;tweak&quot; the laws of the universe to create an effect. The Earth does not know exactly what this new technology can do, but they have hints of it and fear it. Casseia returns to Mars and marries into a family with potentially political ambitions due to their perceived neutrality. Her mother-in-law eventually becomes president of an interim central Martian government, and chooses Casseia as her vice-president. Tensions between the BMs and Earth grow to crisis levels, as news of the Olympians&#x27; discovery frightens the Earth government into pressuring the Martians to cooperate. One method of coercion that the Martians fear is &quot;evolvons&quot;, or small undetectable computer viruses implanted during manufacture into all Thinkers. Martians fear that the Earth will use these to control all Martian Thinkers, and therefore cripple essential operations.

While the tension between Earth and Mars builds, the Olympians, led by Charles Franklin, reveal to Casseia that they have the ability to instantly move anything an infinite distance or to redefine the properties of an object by &quot;tweaking&quot; the properties of an object, with the help of a QL Thinker. The ramifications of this become clear to Casseia and the leaders of the interim government immediately, but they so fear its power that they refuse to use it as anything but a last resort. Charles is convinced that &quot;tweaking&quot;, as the technique is called, is the solution, and orders a QL Thinker to speed up the process. Eventually, he is able to test his technique by converting part of a substance into an &#x27;anti-matter&#x27; of its properties.

The test shows everyone on Earth what the potential of this breakthrough really is, and Earth fears the power it gives the Martians. They double their efforts to duplicate the technology and eventually activate the evolvons, creating chaos on Mars but also uniting it against the Earth. Earth then demands that Mars government allow them to take over and place themselves into a junior relationship status. Martians retaliate by moving the moon Phobos into Earth orbit to demonstrate their ability to respond, but this only escalates the conflict. Earth withdraws their demands but now are racing to duplicate the technology they now know is possible. Charles is able to test the moving object technique by linking his mind to a QL Thinker and using Phobos as a base, visits a planetary system to investigate as a new potential home for moving Mars to. Casseia travels along with his team as the government representative. The test goes well, but with Charles&#x27; mind linked to the QL Thinker, it nearly ends in disaster when the QL Thinker becomes distracted trying to test other &quot;truths&quot;. While connected to the Thinker, the raw intelligence of the Thinker imposes its intellectual will on Charles, and tempts him to test every use of this technique, these &quot;truths&quot;, even those that would be destructive.

Shortly after the planetary system visit, Earth invades Mars with nanotech robots that kill the Martian President, leaving Casseia as the one in charge. Under attack and with no hope of fighting back, she makes the decision to go along with Charles Franklin&#x27;s desperate plan to completely remove Mars from the solar system and place it in orbit around a star 10,000 light-years away. To do it, Charles Franklin must connect his mind to the QL Thinker again. The same temptation as in the first test nearly overcomes Charles&#x27; willpower; he prevails, but it costs him his mind. The novel ends with an aged Casseia looking at the new Martian sky and hoping that the decision she made was the right one.

<doc id="690640" wikidata="Q455795" url="?curid=690640" title="Kamehameha III">
<text>Kamehameha III (born Kauikeaouli) (March 17, 1814 – December 15, 1854) was the third king of the Kingdom of Hawaii from 1825 to 1854. His full Hawaiian name was Keaweaweula Kīwalaō Kauikeaouli Kaleiopapa and then lengthened to Keaweaweula Kīwalaō Kauikeaouli Kaleiopapa Kalani Waiakua Kalanikau Iokikilo Kīwalaō i ke kapu Kamehameha when he ascended the throne.

Under his reign, Hawaii evolved from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy with the signing of both the 1840 Constitution, which was the first Hawaiian Language Constitution, and the 1852 Constitution. He was the longest reigning monarch in the history of the Kingdom, ruling for 29 years and 192 days, although in the early part of his reign he was under a regency by Queen Kaahumanu and later by Kaahumanu II.
His goal was the careful balancing of modernization by adopting Western ways while keeping his nation intact.

==Early life==

Kauikeaouli was born at Keauhou Bay, on Hawaii island, the largest island of the Hawaiian Islands archipelago. He was the second son of King Kamehameha I and his highest ranking wife, Queen Keōpūolani, born in Maui. Early historians suggested June or July 1814, but one accepted date is August 11, 1813. Biographer P. Christiaan Klieger cites 17 March 1814 as his birthday, which is the date declared by the Privy Council as the official birthday in its meeting of March 16, 1846.
He was of the highest &quot;kapu&quot; lineage. Kauikeaouli was about 16 years younger than his brother Liholiho, who ruled as Kamehameha II starting in 1819. He was named &quot;Kauikeaouli&quot; (placed in the dark clouds) &quot;Kaleiopapa Kuakamanolani Mahinalani Kalaninuiwaiakua Keaweaweulaokalani&quot; (the red trail or the roadway by which the god descends from heaven) after his maternal grandfather Kīwalaō. 
He was promised to Kuakini in adoption, but as at birth he appeared to be delivered stillborn, Kuakini did not wish to take him. But Chief Kaikioewa summoned his &quot;kaula&quot; (prophet) Kapihe who declared the baby would live.
Kauikeaouli was cleansed, laid on a rock, fanned, prayed over and sprinkled with water until he breathed, moved and cried. The prayer of Kapihe was to &quot;Kaōnohiokalā&quot;, &quot;Child of God&quot;. The rock is preserved as a monument at Keauhou Bay. He was given to Kaikioewa to raise.

He was torn between the Puritan Christian guidelines imposed on the kingdom by the &quot;kuhina nui&quot; (Queen Regent) who was his stepmother Kaʻahumanu, and the desires to honor the old traditions. Under the influence of Oʻahu&#x27;s then governor, Boki, and a young Hawaiian-Tahitian former priest named Kaomi, Kauikeaouli&#x27;s aikāne partner, he rebelled against his partial Christian upbringing.

==Reign==

When Kauikeaouli came to the throne in 1825, the native population numbered about 150,000, which was already less than one-third of the Hawaiian population at the time of Captain Cook&#x27;s arrival to Hawaii in 1778. During his reign, that number would be halved again, due to a series of epidemics.

===Marriage and children===
In ancient Hawaii, the upper classes considered a marriage with a close royal family member to be an excellent way to preserve pure bloodlines. His brother Liholiho (King Kamehameha II) and his Queen Kamāmalu were a half-sister and brother couple. He had loved his sister Nāhienaena and planned to marry her since childhood, but the union was opposed by the missionaries due to their perceptions of incest.

It was proposed in 1832 that Kamanele, the daughter of Governor John Adams Kuakini, would be the most suitable in age, rank, and education for his queen. Kamanele died in 1834 before the wedding took place. Instead Kamehameha III chose to marry Kalama Hakaleleponi Kapakuhaili, against the wishes of Kīnau. Kalama&#x27;s father was Naihekukui. After his sister&#x27;s death in late 1836, he married Kalama on February 14, 1837, in a Christian ceremony. Kamehameha III and Kalama had two children: Prince Keaweaweulaokalani I and Prince Keaweaweulaokalani II who both died while infants.
He and his mistress Jane Lahilahi, a daughter of his father&#x27;s advisor John Young, had twin illegitimate sons: Kīwalaʻō, who Kamehameha initially took to raise, died young, while the other twin Albert Kūnuiākea survived and was later adopted by Kamehameha and his wife Queen Kalama. Kūnuiākea lived to adulthood but died childless (1851–1902).

===Government===

Kamehameha III led the development of Hawaii&#x27;s first formal written laws. In 1838, senior advisor Hoapili convinced former missionary William Richards to resign from the church and become a political advisor. Richards (although he had no legal training himself) gave classes to Kamehameha III and his councilors on the Western ideas of rule of law and economics. Their first act was a declaration of human rights in 1839.

In 1839, under a French threat of war, Roman Catholicism was legalized in the Edict of Toleration and the first statutory law code was established. Kamehameha III also enacted the Constitution of 1840, Hawaii&#x27;s first. This laid the groundwork for the establishment of judicial and executive branches of government, and a system of land ownership was implemented under the Mahele in 1848. The 1839 declaration of rights, the 1840 constitution, and various laws enacted from 1840 to 1842 came to be collectively called the Kumu Kānāwai or &quot;foundation of law.&quot; They were published together in a dual Hawaiian/English book with a blue cover, similar to the statutory laws of the New England states at the time, and like them became known in English as the Blue Laws. The Kumu Kānāwai was primarily based on Hawaii&#x27;s indigenous traditions, various laws enacted since 1823, and the principles of the Christian Bible.

Over the next few years, Kamehameha III moved the capital from Lahaina to Honolulu. In September 1840 Charles Wilkes arrived on the United States Exploring Expedition. Kamehameha III was happy to support the explorers, and appointed missionary doctor Gerrit P. Judd to serve as translator. Judd treated many of the sailors who suffered from altitude sickness on their ascent of Mauna Loa. Wilkes vastly underestimated the task and did not leave until March 1841.
====Paulet affair====
In February 1843, British Captain Lord George Paulet pressured Kamehameha III into surrendering the Hawaiian kingdom to the British crown, but Kamehameha III alerted London of the captain&#x27;s rogue actions which eventually restored the kingdom&#x27;s independence. Less than five months later, British Admiral Richard Thomas rejected Paulet&#x27;s actions and the kingdom was restored on July 31. It was at the end of this period of uncertainty that the king uttered the phrase &quot;Ua Mau ke Ea o ka ʻĀina i ka Pono&quot;, &quot;the sovereignty of the land is perpetuated in righteousness&quot;. July 31 was celebrated thereafter as &quot;Lā Hoʻihoʻi Ea&quot;, Sovereignty Restoration Day, an official national holiday of the kingdom. Later that year, on November 28, Britain and France officially recognized the independence of the Hawaiian Kingdom, and that too became a national holiday, &quot;Lā Kūʻokoʻa&quot; — Independence Day.

==== Government reform ====

Through the 1840s a formal legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom and cabinet replaced the informal council of chiefs. The chiefs became the House of Nobles, roughly modeled on the British House of Lords. Seven elected representatives would be the start of a democratic government. The cabinet consisted of a Privy Council and five powerful government ministers. Judd was appointed to the most powerful post of Minister of Finance. Frontier lawyer John Ricord was Attorney General, Robert Crichton Wyllie was Minister of Foreign Affairs, Richards Minister of Public Instruction, and Keoni Ana was Minister of the Interior.

Kamehameha III also presided over the formalization of the court system and land titles. Cases such as those of Richard Charlton and Ladd &amp; Co. had prompted the incidents of 1843 and subsequent litigation. Under Kamehameha III, Hawaii rapidly transitioned from indigenous traditions to a new legal system based on Anglo-American common law. Lorrin Andrews became a judge for foreign cases in 1845. William Little Lee (the first to actually graduate from law school) became the first chief justice.

A commission to Quiet Land Titles was formed on February 10, 1846.
This led to what is called the Great Mahele of 1848 which redistributed land between the government, king, nobles, and commoners. Foreigners were allowed to own land fee simple in Hawaii for the first time.
Many commoners were unaware of the program and lost out on the distribution. The domination of his cabinet by Americans (balanced only by Scot Wyllie and half-Hawaiian Keoni Ana) also discouraged the people. 
This was not the end of foreign conflicts either. In 1849, Admiral Louis Tromelin led a French invasion of Honolulu. The French sacked and looted the city after the king refused his demands.

In September 1849, Judd was sent with the heir apparent Prince Alexander Liholiho and Kamehameha V on a diplomatic mission. They returned with a new treaty with the United States but failed in visits to London and Paris.

The Constitution of 1852 and subsequent legislation continued to liberalize politics. The court system was unified, instead of having separate courts for Hawaiians and foreigners. Local Hawaiian magistrates became Circuit Judges, and a Supreme Court was formed with Lee, Andrews, and John Papa ʻĪʻī as members. Voting rules were formalized and the role of the House of Representatives was strengthened.

===Later years===
The California Gold Rush brought increased trade, but also some unwelcome visitors. Previously the long trips around Cape Horn or from Europe meant infected sailors were either recovered or buried at sea by the time they arrived. The short voyage from California brought several waves of diseases that decimated the native Hawaiians who had no immunity.
In the summer of 1853, an epidemic of smallpox caused thousands of deaths, mostly on the island of Oahu. Judd, always at odds with Wyllie, lost the backing of others who blamed him for not containing the disease (or had other political reasons to want him out of power). Judd was forced to resign on September 3 and was replaced by Elisha Hunt Allen as Minister of Finance.

In 1851, Scottish-Australian entrepreneur and sailor Benjamin Boyd convinced King Kamehameha III to become regent of a Pacific empire ranging from Hawaii and the Marquesas to Samoa and Tonga. Boyd was killed in Guadalcanal shortly after.

Hawaii became a popular winter destination for frustrated prospectors in the 1850s. Some were rumored to be filibusters hoping to profit from a rebellion. One of the first was a group led by Samuel Brannan, who did not find the popular support for an uprising that they expected. By the end of 1853 the threats, whether real or imagined, caused petitions for the king to consider annexation to the United States. Wyllie and Lee convinced the king to insist that annexation would only be acceptable if Hawaii became a U.S. state.

In 1852 a group of missionaries set out from Hawaii for the islands of Micronesia. They carried with them a letter of introduction that bore the official seal of King Kamehameha III, the then-ruling monarch of the Hawaiian Islands. This letter, originally written in Hawaiian and addressed to the various rulers of the Pacific Islands, said in part: &quot;There are about to sail for your islands some teachers of the Highest God, Jehovah, to make known unto you His Word for your eternal salvation. . . . I commend these good teachers to your esteem and friendship and exhort you to listen to their instructions. . . . I advise you to throw away your idols, take the Lord Jehovah for your God, worship and love Him and He will bless and save you.&quot;
On May 16, 1854, King Kamehameha III proclaimed the Hawaiian Kingdom neutral in the Crimean War in Europe. The present crises had passed, but the king&#x27;s health declined, often attributed to his renewed drinking. The annexation question also did not go away. The British minister William Miller and French representative Louis Emile Perrin objected to the plan. New U.S. Commissioner David L. Gregg received instructions from Secretary of State William L. Marcy and negotiated a treaty of annexation with Wyllie by August 1854. It was never signed, and might not have been ratified by the Senate. Although there was some support in the U.S., it would take 105 more years before full statehood of Hawaii.

== Death and funeral ==
Kamehameha III died suddenly on December 15, 1854, after a brief illness, which may have been related to a stroke.
He was succeeded by his nephew and adopted son Alexander Liholiho, who was styled as King Kamehameha IV.

In 1865, Kamehameha III was reburied in the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii known as Mauna ʻAla.

== Legacy ==
The access to his birthplace at Keauhou Bay is via Kamehameha III Road from the north from Hawaii Belt Road, at and Kaleiopapa Street from the south at .

His successor described his reign:

The age of Kamehameha III was that of progress and of liberty—of schools and of civilization. He gave us a Constitution and fixed laws; he secured the people in the title to their lands, and removed the last chain of oppression. He gave them a voice in his councils and in the making of the laws by which they are governed. He was a great national benefactor, and has left the impress of his mild and amiable disposition on the age for which he was born.

On July 31, 2018, a 12-foot bronze statue of Kamehameha III and a flagpole flying the Hawaiian flag was unveiled at Thomas Square in a ceremony honoring the 175th anniversary of the restoration of Hawaiian sovereignty in 1843. The statue was created by Oregon artist Thomas Jay Warren for $250,000 allotted by the Mayor&#x27;s Office of Culture and the Arts and is part of Mayor Kirk Caldwell&#x27;s plans to revamp the park.

<text>The New Criterion is a New York–based monthly literary magazine and journal of artistic and cultural criticism, edited by Roger Kimball (editor and publisher) and James Panero (executive editor). It has sections for criticism of poetry, theater, art, music, the media, and books. It was founded in 1982 by Hilton Kramer, former art critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and Samuel Lipman, a pianist and music critic. The name is a reference to &quot;The Criterion&quot;, a British literary magazine edited by T. S. Eliot from 1922 to 1939.

The magazine describes itself as a &quot;monthly review of the arts and intellectual life ... at the forefront both of championing what is best and most humanely vital in our cultural inheritance and in exposing what is mendacious, corrosive, and spurious.&quot; It is characterized by a Modernist inclination and evinces a political conservatism that is rare among other publications of its type.

It regularly publishes special symposia, or compilations of published material organized into themes. Some past examples include &quot;Affirmative action and the law&quot;; &quot;Common-good conservatism: a debate&quot;; &quot;Corrupt Humanitarianism&quot;; &quot;Religion, Manners, and Morals in the U.S. and Great Britain&quot;; and &quot;Reflections on Anti-Americanism&quot;.

Since 1999, &quot;The New Criterion&quot; has awarded the New Criterion Poetry Prize, a poetry contest wherein the magazine publishes the winner&#x27;s work and awards them a cash prize. In 2004, &quot;The New Criterion&quot; contributors began publishing an online section, initially named ArmaVirumque, and later renamed to Dispatch.

==Origin==
&quot;The New Criterion&quot; was founded in 1982 by &quot;The New York Times&quot; art critic Hilton Kramer. He cited his reasons for leaving the paper to start &quot;The New Criterion&quot; as &quot;the disgusting and deleterious doctrines with which the most popular of our Reviews disgraces its pages&quot;, as well as &quot;the dishonesties and hypocrisies and disfiguring ideologies that nowadays afflict the criticism of the arts, [which] are deeply rooted in both our commercial and our academic culture.&quot; He went on to say: &quot;It is therefore all the more urgent that a dissenting critical voice be heard, and it is for the purpose of providing such a voice that &quot;The New Criterion&quot; has been created.&quot;

Kramer&#x27;s decision to leave &quot;The New York Times&quot;, where he had been the newspaper&#x27;s chief art critic, and to start a magazine devoted to ideas and the arts &quot;surprised a lot of people and was a statement in itself&quot;, according to Erich Eichmann.

Contributors to the journal have included Peter Thiel, Douglas Murray, Mark Steyn, Roger Scruton, David Pryce-Jones, Theodore Dalrymple, Alexander McCall Smith, Victor Davis Hanson, Harvey Mansfield, Gertrude Himmelfarb, Penelope Fitzgerald, Allan Bloom, and Jay Nordlinger.

In its first issue, dated September 1982, the magazine set out &quot;to speak plainly and vigorously about the problems that beset the life of the artists and the life of the mind in our society&quot; while resisting &quot;a more general cultural drift&quot; that had in many cases, &quot;condemned true seriousness to a fugitive existence&quot;.

==Reception==
Reviewing the debut issue for &quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot;, Gail Caldwell noted that &quot;The opening editorial, &#x27;A Note on the &quot;New Criterion&quot;,&#x27; is fearlessly candid about the journal&#x27;s slant. The alleged destruction of high culture in this country, including a &#x27;fateful collapse in critical standards,&#x27; is due to the creeping meatball of the Far Left.&quot; Still, she predicted that &quot;the &quot;New Criterion&quot; going to do quite nicely, thank you. Because Kramer, rearguard politics notwithstanding, has a formidable intellect—and because the table of contents is cluttered with Important People.&quot;

&quot;The New Criterion&quot; ranked in the top ten most influential periodicals among American intellectuals according to a survey conducted by Steven G. Brint in &quot;In an Age of Experts: The Changing Role of Professionals in Politics and Public Life&quot; (Princeton University Press).

Writing for &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, Harry Mount called &quot;The New Criterion&quot; &quot;More consistently worth reading than any other magazine in English.&quot;

According to the conservative publication &quot;The New York Sun&quot;, for a quarter of a century &quot;The New Criterion&quot; &quot;has helped its readers distinguish achievement from failure in painting, music, dance, literature, theater, and other arts. The magazine ... has taken a leading role in the culture wars, publishing articles whose titles are an intellectual call to arms.&quot;

Elsewhere, critics of the magazine have accused it of &quot;sheer snobbery&quot; and a tendency to get lost in the culture wars. The critic Michael Dirda wrote in &quot;The American Scholar&quot; that &quot;Nearly all the magazine&#x27;s reviewing—of books, art, and music—is first-rate. The poetry featured is comparably exceptional, with a strong preference for formal verse (which is just fine by me).&quot;

<text>West Seattle is a conglomeration of neighborhoods in Seattle, Washington, United States. It comprises two of the thirteen districts, Delridge and Southwest, and encompasses all of Seattle west of the Duwamish River. It was incorporated as an independent town in 1902 before being annexed by Seattle five years later. Among the area&#x27;s attractions are its saltwater beach parks along Elliott Bay and Puget Sound, including Alki Beach Park and Lincoln Park. The area is also known for its views of the Olympic Mountains to the west and the Cascade Range to the east. One-third of Seattle&#x27;s green space and urban forest is located in West Seattle, much of it in the West Duwamish Greenbelt.

==History==

West Seattle is the oldest neighborhood in the city and considered the birthplace of the modern city of Seattle. The Denny Party landed at Alki Point on November 13, 1851, after disembarking from the &quot;Exact&quot;. At the time, the peninsula had several Coast Salish villages inhabited by the Duwamish and Suquamish. The white settlement was later named &quot;New York Alki&quot;, using a Chinook Jargon term for &quot;by and by&quot; or &quot;in a while&quot;; most of the Denny Party later moved across Elliott Bay, while Charles C. Terry remained on the peninsula and filed a plat for the town of Alki in 1853. The exposed, western side of the peninsula proved unsuitable for a major city due to its high winds and tides. The Southwest Seattle Historical Society maintains the Log House Museum at Alki Point.

The Duwamish village of , in modern-day West Seattle, was destroyed by arson on March 7, 1893. The village&#x27;s inhabitants fled to Ballast Island, a small artificial island in Elliott Bay, and other areas around the region.

The independent community of West Seattle grew in the late 19th century and was incorporated as a fourth-class city in 1902. It was connected to Seattle proper by a ferry beginning in 1888 and a railroad and streetcar trestle that was completed two years later. The City of West Seattle opened its own streetcar line—among the first municipalities in the U.S. to do so—in 1906. The line was sold to the Seattle Electric Railway Company and extended in 1907 to the Fauntleroy area, where real estate development soon began. The city annexed the Alki and Youngstown neighborhoods on May 25, 1907, and was itself annexed into Seattle on June 29.

==Neighborhoods==
===High Point===

High Point is a neighborhood in the Delridge district. It is so named because it contains the highest point in the city of Seattle: Myrtle Reservoir Park at the intersection of 35th Avenue SW and SW Myrtle Street, which is above sea level. The neighborhood is located on the east side of 35th Ave SW, with approximate north and south boundaries at SW Juneau Street and SW Myrtle Street.

The hill is dominated by two large water towers; it is also the location of Our Lady of Guadalupe School and Parish, on the peak of the highest hill in West Seattle. It is also known for the High Point Projects which were torn down in 2005 to make way for new mixed-income housing. High Point is one of Seattle&#x27;s most diverse neighborhoods, with a substantial immigrant population from Southeast Asia and East Africa.

====Redevelopment====

The neighborhood was originally developed during World War II to provide government housing, and it remained a district of predominantly low-income housing through the 1990s. In 2003, the Seattle Housing Authority began work on the first phase of a six-year project to redevelop High Point into a mixed-income community. The redevelopment removed all existing housing, roads, and utilities. In their place, new roads, underground infrastructure, about 1,600 new housing units, and community facilities were built.
The redevelopment embraced many sustainable development principles. The site and rental housing are certified at the highest BuiltGreen levels; most housing is Energy Star rated. The site makes extensive use of permeable paving, including porous sidewalks, parking areas, and the only porous pavement street in the state of Washington. Some houses were built to reduce symptoms for people with asthma. The neighborhood redevelopment plan has been recognized with some of the most prestigious land use and development awards, among them the 2007 ULI Global Award of Excellence, the 2007 EPA National Award for Smart Growth, and the 2007 Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence.

===Alki===

Alki Point is traditionally credited as the point where the Denny Party founded Seattle before moving across Elliott Bay to what is now Downtown. A similar landing at Alki has been reenacted annually since 1950 as part of the week-long Seafair celebration of Seattle&#x27;s marine and boating heritage. Seafair coincides with West Seattle festivities including Hi-Yu and the West Seattle Summer Fest street festival held each July. Along with its historical significance, Alki is also home to the most popular beach in the Seattle area. Fittingly named Alki Beach, it features a long strip of sandy beach full of driftwood, seashells, and fire pits. Low tides offer West Seattleites an opportunity to explore marine life in tidepools. Alki also hosts a flat bike and running trail from which visitors can view the Seattle skyline, Puget Sound, and the Olympic mountains.

===The Junction===

The Junction is the name used for the commercial district that centers on the intersection of California Avenue S.W. and S.W. Alaska Street. It is sometimes called &quot;West Seattle Junction&quot; or &quot;Alaska Junction&quot; by residents.

West Seattle also has two other intersections of note: Admiral Junction in the northern part of the peninsula where California Avenue S.W. and S.W. Admiral Way meet, and Morgan Junction at the southern end where Fauntleroy Way S.W., S.W. Morgan Street, and California Avenue S.W. intersect.

The West Seattle Summer Fest, a multi-day street festival at the Junction, is hosted annually in July. It includes live music, shopping, art galleries, and other events in the neighborhood. The festival was established in 1982 and was cancelled for 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Other neighborhoods===
The Westwood Village shopping center, between S.W. Trenton and S.W. Barton Streets in the south end of West Seattle, has undergone several makeovers and now provides a mall-like shopping experience, including a Target and a Marshall&#x27;s. However, it is unlikely that a movie theater will be allowed here because of restricted parking.

Before the annexation of West Seattle, the neighborhood of White Center radiated north and south of Roxbury, but now with the city line going down the middle of the old neighborhood is it unclear whether the northern part of the area should still be referred to as part of the White Center neighborhood.

West Seattle also includes suburban neighborhoods in the southwest end, including Gatewood, Fauntleroy, Arbor Heights, and Arroyo Heights in the southernmost section of West Seattle. These neighborhoods are located near pt. Williams and the surrounding areas including the Fauntleroy ferry terminal, Lincoln Park, and The Arbor Heights pool.

==Transportation==
West Seattle has three bridges over the Duwamish River that connect the peninsula to SODO and Downtown Seattle. The high-level West Seattle Bridge, opened in 1984 and carries seven lanes of traffic on a short freeway that continues towards Interstate 5 on the Spokane Street Viaduct. The bridge was closed from 2020 to 2022 for extensive repairs after the rapid growth of cracks in the concrete was discovered. The parallel, low-level Spokane Street Bridge is a swing bridge that opened in 1991 and also carries a multi-use trail across Harbor Island. To the southeast is the First Avenue South Bridge, a pair of movable bridges on State Route 99.

The peninsula&#x27;s major north–south streets include California Avenue, which runs from Hamilton Viewpoint to Thistle Strete; Fauntleroy Way, which connects the Fauntleroy ferry terminal to the West Seattle Bridge; 35th Avenue Southwest; and Delridge Way. Alki Avenue and Harbor Avenue form a continuous ring along the north shore of the peninsula and have a parallel multi-use trail.

West Seattle is served by bus service from King County Metro, the county&#x27;s public transit system, with connections to Downtown Seattle and other nearby destinations. These routes include the RapidRide C Line on California Avenue and Fauntleroy Way and RapidRide H Line on Delridge Way; both lines have bus rapid transit features and continue across the West Seattle Bridge to Downtown Seattle. Washington State Ferries operates automobile ferries from the Fauntleroy terminal to Vashon Island and Southworth on the Kitsap Peninsula. The passenger-only King County Water Taxi also runs between Seacrest Park and Downtown Seattle; it was upgraded to year-round all-day service in 2022. King County Metro operates shuttle buses that connect West Seattle Junction, Alki, and the Admiral District with water taxi runs from Seacrest Park.

Sound Transit, the regional public transit agency of the Seattle metropolitan area, plans to build a Link light rail extension between Downtown Seattle and West Seattle. The project was approved in the 2016 Sound Transit 3 ballot measure as one of two in-city corridors and is estimated to cost at least $6.7 billion to construct. The extension will be part of the 3 Line and is scheduled to open in 2032 with three stations in West Seattle, a new bridge over the Duwamish River, and a temporary terminus at SODO station. The remainder of the 3 Line to Snohomish County would open later in the decade after the completion of the Ballard Link Extension. The three stations in West Seattle are expected to be an underground station at Alaska Junction on the site of the Jefferson Square shopping center; a retained cut station at Avalon Way; and an elevated station at Delridge Way near Andover Street.

==Media==

The community is served by the &quot;West Seattle Herald&quot;, which published a weekly newspaper until 2021 and was later replaced by &quot;Westside Seattle&quot; after a merger with the &quot;Ballard News-Tribune&quot;. A hyperlocal blog website named the &quot;West Seattle Blog&quot; was established in December 2005 and has remained independently owned and operated.

==Education==
West Seattle is home to South Seattle College, West Seattle High School, Chief Sealth International High School, Seattle Lutheran High School, Gatewood Elementary School, Madison Middle School, Denny International Middle School, Roxhill Elementary School, K-5 STEM at Boren, Alki Elementary School, Lafayette Elementary School, Highland Park Elementary School, Sanislo Elementary School, Pathfinder K-8, Holy Family School Seattle, Holy Rosary West Seattle, Genesee Hill Elementary School, Our Lady of Guadalupe, Hope Lutheran School, Arbor Heights Elementary School, and Fairmount Park Elementary School.

==Parks and recreation==
West Seattle has many parks along the waterfront, including Lincoln Park and the Emma Schmitz Overlook to Jack Block Park facing the port. The West Seattle Golf Course, West Seattle Stadium, and Camp Long Outdoor Learning Center are found in the middle of the peninsula with unique opportunities to recreate outdoors including overnight camping in rustic cabins. In addition, Seattle Parks and Recreation maintains Community Centers (Alki, Delridge, and Hiawatha), Coleman Pool, SouthWest Pool, and the SouthWest Teen Life Center. There is a historic bath house on Alki Beach as well as the Dakota Place Park with its restored light station.

<doc id="690646" wikidata="Q887354" url="?curid=690646" title="Kamehameha V">
<text>Kamehameha V (Lota Kapuāiwa Kalanimakua Aliʻiōlani Kalanikupuapaʻīkalaninui; December 11, 1830 – December 11, 1872), reigned as the fifth monarch of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi from 1863 to 1872. His motto was &quot;Onipaʻa&quot;: immovable, firm, steadfast, or determined; he is said to have worked diligently for his people and kingdom, being described as the last great traditional chief.

==Early life==
He was born and given the name Lot Kapuāiwa December 11, 1830. His mother was Elizabeth Kīnaʻu and father was Mataio Kekūanaōʻa. His siblings included David Kamehameha, Moses Kekūāiwa, Alexander Liholiho, and Victoria Kamāmalu. He also was a grandson of Kamehameha I. &quot;Kapu āiwa&quot; means mysterious kapu or sacred one protected by supernatural powers. He was adopted using the ancient Hawaiian tradition called &quot;hānai&quot; by Princess Nāhiʻenaʻena, but she died in 1836. He was then adopted by his grandmother Queen Kalākua Kaheiheimālie and step-grandfather High Chief Ulumāheihei Hoapili. His childhood was difficult; he felt that his &quot;hānai&quot; parents treated him as a stranger in their house, and that the adoption had deprived him the love of his mother. Throughout his life he would have a deep dislike for this tradition as it could be later seen by his anger at his half-sister Ruth Keelikolani giving away her second son Keolaokalani to Bernice Pauahi Bishop.

It was planned that he would be Hoapili&#x27;s heir as Governor of Maui, although this never happened. Since King Kamehameha III declared him eligible for the throne, he was educated at the Royal School like his cousins and siblings. He was betrothed to Bernice Pauahi at birth, but she chose to marry American Charles Reed Bishop instead.

After leaving school, he traveled abroad with his brother Alexander Liholiho. With the supervision of their guardian Dr. Judd, Lot and his brother sailed to San Francisco in September 1849. After their tour of California, they continued on to Panama, Jamaica, New York City and Washington, D.C. They toured Europe and met with various heads of state including French president Louis Napoleon, British prince consort Albert, and US president Zachary Taylor and vice president Millard Fillmore.

==Career==
From 1852 to 1855 he served on the Privy Council of State, and from 1852 to 1862 in the House of Nobles. He was Minister of the Interior from 1857 to 1863, chief justice of the supreme court from 1857 to 1858, and held other offices. His more charismatic younger brother Prince Alexander Liholiho was chosen to become King Kamehameha IV in 1854. In 1862, he was officially added to the line of succession in an amendment to the 1852 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Lot and his heirs, followed by his sister Princess Victoria and her heirs, would succeed in the case his brother died without any legitimate heirs. The change was made shortly before the death of Prince Albert Kamehameha, the only son of Kamehameha IV, on August 23, 1862.

==New constitution and new laws==
He came to power on November 30, 1863, after his brother&#x27;s death, but refused to uphold the previous constitution of 1852. He objected, in particular, to that constitution&#x27;s grant of universal male suffrage in elections for the lower House of Representatives. In May 1864 he called for a constitutional convention. On July 7, 1864, he proposed a new constitution rather than amending the old one. The convention ran smoothly until the 62nd article. It limited voters to being residents who passed a literacy test and possessed property or had income qualifications. On August 20, 1864, he signed the 1864 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii and took an oath to protect it. 

The constitution was based on the original draft, but 20 articles were deleted. When he appointed Charles de Varigny, a French national, as minister of finance in December 1863, Americans in Hawaiʻi were convinced that he had adopted an anti-American policy. In reality, his foreign policy remained the same. Later de Varigny became minister of foreign affairs from 1865 to 1869.

He was the first king to encourage revival of traditional practices. Under his reign, the laws against &quot;kahunaism&quot; were repealed. A Hawaiian Board of Medicine was established, with kahuna members, and la&#x27;au lapa&#x27;au or Hawaiian medicine was again practiced. He brought kahuna practitioners to Honolulu to document their remedies.

In 1865, a bill was brought before the legislature giving foreign merchants the right to sell liquor directly to Native Hawaiians. Kamehameha V surprised supporters of the bill by refusing to grant his assent, saying: &quot;I will never sign the death warrant of my people.&quot; Alcoholism was one of the many causes of the already declining population of the native Hawaiians.

==Growth in travel to Hawaii==
Growth in travel to the islands increased during Kamehameha&#x27;s reign. Mark Twain came in March 1866 aboard the merchantman &quot;Ajax&quot;. He stayed for four months under his real name, Samuel Clemens, writing letters back to the &quot;Sacramento Union&quot; describing the islands. Twain described the king:

He was a wise sovereign; he had seen something of the world; he was educated &amp; accomplished, &amp; he tried hard to do well by his people, &amp; succeeded. There was no trivial royal nonsense about him; He dressed plainly, poked about Honolulu, night or day, on his old horse, unattended; he was popular, greatly respected, and even beloved.

Queen Victoria sent her second son Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh on a state visit in 1869. He appealed to Kaiser Wilhelm I of Germany, who sent Henri Berger to organize the Royal Hawaiian Band, a gift of music from the king to his people.

==Succession==
His sister and only named Heir Apparent to the throne, Crown Princess Victoria Kamāmalu had died childless in 1866 and through the remainder of his reign, Kamehameha V did not name a successor. He died on December 11, 1872, while the preparations for his birthday celebration were underway. As Lot lay bedstricken, he answered those that came to visit him: &quot;It is hard to die on my birthday, but God&#x27;s will be done&quot;. He offered the throne to his cousin Bernice Pauahi Bishop who refused, and died an hour later without designating an heir. Lot Kapuāiwa had a daughter Keanolani (July 7, 1847 – June 30, 1902) with Abigail Maheha. However, her illegitimate birth prevented her from succeeding to the Hawaiian throne. Lot was buried in the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii at Mauna ʻAla.

He was the last ruling monarch of the House of Kamehameha styled under the Kamehameha name. Before his death Kamehameha V stated:

The throne belongs to Lunalilo; I will not appoint him, because I consider him unworthy of the position. The constitution, in case I make no nomination, provides for the election of the next King; let it be so. 

With no heir at his death, the next monarch would be elected by the legislature. Kamehameha V&#x27;s cousin William Charles Lunalilo, a Kamehameha by birth from his mother, demanded a general election and won. The legislature agreed and Lunalilo became the first elected king of the Hawaiian Kingdom.

==Legacy==
He founded the Royal Order of Kamehameha I society on April 11, 1865, named to honor his grandfather.

The Prince Lot Hula Festival is named for him. It was held the third Saturday in July since 1977 at his former home called Moanalua Gardens.

In February 1847, a female student at the Royal School, Abigail Maheha, was expelled and wed in a hastily arranged marriage due to a scandalous pregnancy. Some speculate that the sixteen year-old Kamehameha V or his seventeen-year-old brother Moses Kekūāiwa was the father of Abigail&#x27;s daughter Keanolani, who left living descendants. Evidence to support this claim include his financial support of Abigail&#x27;s husband Keaupuni, veiled conversations the Cookes had with Abigail and Lot dated months before the pregnancy was discovered, and entries from the period which were torn out of his school journal.

<text>In graph theory, a proper edge coloring of a graph is an assignment of &quot;colors&quot; to the edges of the graph so that no two incident edges have the same color. For example, the figure to the right shows an edge coloring of a graph by the colors red, blue, and green. Edge colorings are one of several different types of graph coloring. The edge-coloring problem asks whether it is possible to color the edges of a given graph using at most different colors, for a given value of , or with the fewest possible colors. The minimum required number of colors for the edges of a given graph is called the chromatic index of the graph. For example, the edges of the graph in the illustration can be colored by three colors but cannot be colored by two colors, so the graph shown has chromatic index three.

By Vizing&#x27;s theorem, the number of colors needed to edge color a simple graph is either its maximum degree or . For some graphs, such as bipartite graphs and high-degree planar graphs, the number of colors is always , and for multigraphs, the number of colors may be as large as . There are polynomial time algorithms that construct optimal colorings of bipartite graphs, and colorings of non-bipartite simple graphs that use at most colors; however, the general problem of finding an optimal edge coloring is NP-hard and the fastest known algorithms for it take exponential time. Many variations of the edge-coloring problem, in which an assignments of colors to edges must satisfy other conditions than non-adjacency, have been studied. Edge colorings have applications in scheduling problems and in frequency assignment for fiber optic networks.

==Examples==
A cycle graph may have its edges colored with two colors if the length of the cycle is even: simply alternate the two colors around the cycle. However, if the length is odd, three colors are needed.
A complete graph with vertices is edge-colorable with colors when is an even number; this is a special case of Baranyai&#x27;s theorem. provides the following geometric construction of a coloring in this case: place points at the vertices and center of a regular -sided polygon. For each color class, include one edge from the center to one of the polygon vertices, and all of the perpendicular edges connecting pairs of polygon vertices. However, when is odd, colors are needed: each color can only be used for edges, a fraction of the total.

Several authors have studied edge colorings of the odd graphs, -regular graphs in which the vertices represent teams of players selected from a pool of players, and in which the edges represent possible pairings of these teams (with one player left as &quot;odd man out&quot; to referee the game). The case that gives the well-known Petersen graph. As explains the problem (for ), the players wish to find a schedule for these pairings such that each team plays each of its six games on different days of the week, with Sundays off for all teams; that is, formalizing the problem mathematically, they wish to find a 6-edge-coloring of the 6-regular odd graph . When is 3, 4, or 8, an edge coloring of requires colors, but when it is 5, 6, or 7, only colors are needed.

== Definitions ==
As with its vertex counterpart, an edge coloring of a graph, when mentioned without any qualification, is always assumed to be a proper coloring of the edges, meaning no two adjacent edges are assigned the same color. Here, two distinct edges are considered to be adjacent when they share a common vertex. An edge coloring of a graph may also be thought of as equivalent to a vertex coloring of the line graph , the graph that has a vertex for every edge of and an edge for every pair of adjacent edges in .

A proper edge coloring with different colors is called a (proper) -edge-coloring. A graph that can be assigned a -edge-coloring is said to be -edge-colorable. The smallest number of colors needed in a (proper) edge coloring of a graph is the chromatic index, or edge chromatic number, . The chromatic index is also sometimes written using the notation ; in this notation, the subscript one indicates that edges are one-dimensional objects. A graph is -edge-chromatic if its chromatic index is exactly . The chromatic index should not be confused with the chromatic number or , the minimum number of colors needed in a proper vertex coloring of .

Unless stated otherwise all graphs are assumed to be simple, in contrast to multigraphs in which two or more edges may be connecting the same pair of endpoints and in which there may be self-loops. For many problems in edge coloring, simple graphs behave differently from multigraphs, and additional care is needed to extend theorems about edge colorings of simple graphs to the multigraph case.

==Relation to matching==

A matching in a graph is a set of edges, no two of which are adjacent; a perfect matching is a matching that includes edges touching all of the vertices of the graph, and a maximum matching is a matching that includes as many edges as possible. In an edge coloring, the set of edges with any one color must all be non-adjacent to each other, so they form a matching. That is, a proper edge coloring is the same thing as a partition of the graph into disjoint matchings.

If the size of a maximum matching in a given graph is small, then many matchings will be needed in order to cover all of the edges of the graph. Expressed more formally, this reasoning implies that if a graph has edges in total, and if at most edges may belong to a maximum matching, then every edge coloring of the graph must use at least different colors. For instance, the 16-vertex planar graph shown in the illustration has edges. In this graph, there can be no perfect matching; for, if the center vertex is matched, the remaining unmatched vertices may be grouped into three different connected components with four, five, and five vertices, and the components with an odd number of vertices cannot be perfectly matched. However, the graph has maximum matchings with seven edges, so . Therefore, the number of colors needed to edge-color the graph is at least 24/7, and since the number of colors must be an integer it is at least four.

For a regular graph of degree that does not have a perfect matching, this lower bound can be used to show that at least colors are needed. In particular, this is true for a regular graph with an odd number of vertices (such as the odd complete graphs); for such graphs, by the handshaking lemma, must itself be even. However, the inequality does not fully explain the chromatic index of every regular graph, because there are regular graphs that do have perfect matchings but that are not &quot;k&quot;-edge-colorable. For instance, the Petersen graph is regular, with and with edges in its perfect matchings, but it does not have a 3-edge-coloring.

==Relation to degree==

===Vizing&#x27;s theorem===

The edge chromatic number of a graph is very closely related to the maximum degree , the largest number of edges incident to any single vertex of . Clearly, , for if different edges all meet at the same vertex , then all of these edges need to be assigned different colors from each other, and that can only be possible if there are at least colors available to be assigned. Vizing&#x27;s theorem (named for Vadim G. Vizing who published it in 1964) states that this bound is almost tight: for any graph, the edge chromatic number is either or .
When , &quot;G&quot; is said to be of class 1; otherwise, it is said to be of class 2.

Every bipartite graph is of class 1, and almost all random graphs are of class 1. However, it is NP-complete to determine whether an arbitrary graph is of class 1.

 proved that planar graphs of maximum degree at least eight are of class one and conjectured that the same is true for planar graphs of maximum degree seven or six. On the other hand, there exist planar graphs of maximum degree ranging from two through five that are of class two. The conjecture has since been proven for graphs of maximum degree seven. Bridgeless planar cubic graphs are all of class 1; this is an equivalent form of the four color theorem.

===Regular graphs===
A 1-factorization of a &quot;k&quot;-regular graph, a partition of the edges of the graph into perfect matchings, is the same thing as a &quot;k&quot;-edge-coloring of the graph. That is, a regular graph has a 1-factorization if and only if it is of class 1. As a special case of this, a 3-edge-coloring of a cubic (3-regular) graph is sometimes called a Tait coloring.

Not every regular graph has a 1-factorization; for instance, the Petersen graph does not. More generally the snarks are defined as the graphs that, like the Petersen graph, are bridgeless, 3-regular, and of class 2.

According to the theorem of , every bipartite regular graph has a 1-factorization. The theorem was stated earlier in terms of projective configurations and was proven by Ernst Steinitz.

===Multigraphs===

For multigraphs, in which multiple parallel edges may connect the same two vertices, results that are similar to but weaker than Vizing&#x27;s theorem are known relating the edge chromatic number , the maximum degree , and the multiplicity , the maximum number of edges in any bundle of parallel edges. As a simple example showing that Vizing&#x27;s theorem does not generalize to multigraphs, consider a Shannon multigraph, a multigraph with three vertices and three bundles of parallel edges connecting each of the three pairs of vertices. In this example, (each vertex is incident to only two out of the three bundles of parallel edges) but the edge chromatic number is (there are edges in total, and every two edges are adjacent, so all edges must be assigned different colors to each other). In a result that inspired Vizing, showed that this is the worst case: for any multigraph . Additionally, for any multigraph , , an inequality that reduces to Vizing&#x27;s theorem in the case of simple graphs (for which ).

==Algorithms==
Because the problem of testing whether a graph is class 1 is NP-complete, there is no known polynomial time algorithm for edge-coloring every graph with an optimal number of colors. Nevertheless, a number of algorithms have been developed that relax one or more of these criteria: they only work on a subset of graphs, or they do not always use an optimal number of colors, or they do not always run in polynomial time.

===Optimally coloring special classes of graphs===
In the case of bipartite graphs or multigraphs with maximum degree , the optimal number of colors is exactly . showed that an optimal edge coloring of these graphs can be found in the near-linear time bound , where is the number of edges in the graph; simpler, but somewhat slower, algorithms are described by and . The algorithm of begins by making the input graph regular, without increasing its degree or significantly increasing its size, by merging pairs of vertices that belong to the same side of the bipartition and then adding a small number of additional vertices and edges. Then, if the degree is odd, Alon finds a single perfect matching in near-linear time, assigns it a color, and removes it from the graph, causing the degree to become even. Finally, Alon applies an observation of , that selecting alternating subsets of edges in an Euler tour of the graph partitions it into two regular subgraphs, to split the edge coloring problem into two smaller subproblems, and his algorithm solves the two subproblems recursively. The total time for his algorithm is .

For planar graphs with maximum degree , the optimal number of colors is again exactly . With the stronger assumption that , it is possible to find an optimal edge coloring in linear time .

For d-regular graphs which are pseudo-random in the sense that their adjacency matrix has second largest eigenvalue (in absolute value) at most , d is the optimal number of colors .

===Algorithms that use more than the optimal number of colors===
 and describe polynomial time algorithms for coloring any graph with colors, meeting the bound given by Vizing&#x27;s theorem; see Misra &amp; Gries edge coloring algorithm.

For multigraphs, present the following algorithm, which they attribute to Eli Upfal. Make the input multigraph Eulerian by adding a new vertex connected by an edge to every odd-degree vertex, find an Euler tour, and choose an orientation for the tour. Form a bipartite graph in which there are two copies of each vertex of , one on each side of the bipartition, with an edge from a vertex on the left side of the bipartition to a vertex on the right side of the bipartition whenever the oriented tour has an edge from to in . Apply a bipartite graph edge coloring algorithm to . Each color class in corresponds to a set of edges in that form a subgraph with maximum degree two; that is, a disjoint union of paths and cycles, so for each color class in it is possible to form three color classes in . The time for the algorithm is bounded by the time to edge color a bipartite graph, using the algorithm of . The number of colors this algorithm uses is at most formula_1, close to but not quite the same as Shannon&#x27;s bound of formula_2. It may also be made into a parallel algorithm in a straightforward way. In the same paper, Karloff and Shmoys also present a linear time algorithm for coloring multigraphs of maximum degree three with four colors (matching both Shannon&#x27;s and Vizing&#x27;s bounds) that operates on similar principles: their algorithm adds a new vertex to make the graph Eulerian, finds an Euler tour, and then chooses alternating sets of edges on the tour to split the graph into two subgraphs of maximum degree two. The paths and even cycles of each subgraph may be colored with two colors per subgraph. After this step, each remaining odd cycle contains at least one edge that may be colored with one of the two colors belonging to the opposite subgraph. Removing this edge from the odd cycle leaves a path, which may be colored using the two colors for its subgraph.

A greedy coloring algorithm that considers the edges of a graph or multigraph one by one, assigning each edge the first available color, may sometimes use as many as colors, which may be nearly twice as many number of colors as is necessary. However, it has the advantage that it may be used in the online algorithm setting in which the input graph is not known in advance; in this setting, its competitive ratio is two, and this is optimal: no other online algorithm can achieve a better performance. However, if edges arrive in a random order, and the input graph has a degree that is at least logarithmic, then smaller competitive ratios can be achieved.

Several authors have made conjectures that imply that the fractional chromatic index of any multigraph (a number that can be computed in polynomial time using linear programming) is within one of the chromatic index. If these conjectures are true, it would be possible to compute a number that is never more than one off from the chromatic index in the multigraph case, matching what is known via Vizing&#x27;s theorem for simple graphs. Although unproven in general, these conjectures are known to hold when the chromatic index is at least formula_3, as can happen for multigraphs with sufficiently large multiplicity.

===Exact algorithms===
It is straightforward to test whether a graph may be edge colored with one or two colors, so the first nontrivial case of edge coloring is testing whether a graph has a 3-edge-coloring.
As showed, it is possible to test whether a graph has a 3-edge-coloring in time , while using only polynomial space. Although this time bound is exponential, it is significantly faster than a brute force search over all possible assignments of colors to edges. Every biconnected 3-regular graph with vertices has 3-edge-colorings; all of which can be listed in time (somewhat slower than the time to find a single coloring); as Greg Kuperberg observed, the graph of a prism over an -sided polygon has colorings (lower instead of upper bound), showing that this bound is tight.

By applying exact algorithms for vertex coloring to the line graph of the input graph, it is possible to optimally edge-color any graph with edges, regardless of the number of colors needed, in time and exponential space, or in time and only polynomial space .

Because edge coloring is NP-complete even for three colors, it is unlikely to be fixed parameter tractable when parametrized by the number of colors. However, it is tractable for other parameters. In particular, showed that for graphs of treewidth , an optimal edge coloring can be computed in time , a bound that depends superexponentially on but only linearly on the number of vertices in the graph.

 formulate the edge coloring problem as an integer program and describe their experience using an integer programming solver to edge color graphs. However, they did not perform any complexity analysis of their algorithm.

==Additional properties==

A graph is uniquely -edge-colorable if there is only one way of partitioning the edges into color classes, ignoring the possible permutations of the colors. For , the only uniquely -edge-colorable graphs are paths, cycles, and stars, but for other graphs may also be uniquely -edge-colorable. Every uniquely 3-edge-colorable graph has exactly three Hamiltonian cycles (formed by deleting one of the three color classes) but there exist 3-regular graphs that have three Hamiltonian cycles and are not uniquely 3-colorable, such as the generalized Petersen graphs for . The only known nonplanar uniquely 3-colorable graph is the generalized Petersen graph , and it has been conjectured that no others exist.
 investigated the non-increasing sequences of numbers with the property that there exists a proper edge coloring of a given graph with edges of the first color, edges of the second color, etc. They observed that, if a sequence is feasible in this sense, and is greater in lexicographic order than a sequence with the same sum, then is also feasible. For, if in lexicographic order, then can be transformed into by a sequence of steps, each of which reduces one of the numbers by one unit and increases another later number 
 with by one unit. In terms of edge colorings, starting from a coloring that realizes , each of these same steps may be performed by swapping colors and on a Kempe chain, a maximal path of edges that alternate between the two colors. In particular, any graph has an equitable edge coloring, an edge coloring with an optimal number of colors in which every two color classes differ in size by at most one unit.

The De Bruijn–Erdős theorem may be used to transfer many edge coloring properties of finite graphs to infinite graphs. For instance, Shannon&#x27;s and Vizing&#x27;s theorems relating the degree of a graph to its chromatic index both generalize straightforwardly to infinite graphs.

 considers the problem of finding a graph drawing of a given cubic graph with the properties that all of the edges in the drawing have one of three different slopes and that no two edges lie on the same line as each other. If such a drawing exists, then clearly the slopes of the edges may be used as colors in a 3-edge-coloring of the graph. For instance, the drawing of the utility graph as the edges and long diagonals of a regular hexagon represents a 3-edge-coloring of the graph in this way. As Richter shows, a 3-regular simple bipartite graph, with a given Tait coloring, has a drawing of this type that represents the given coloring if and only if the graph is 3-edge-connected. For a non-bipartite graph, the condition is a little more complicated: a given coloring can be represented by a drawing if the bipartite double cover of the graph is 3-edge-connected, and if deleting any monochromatic pair of edges leads to a subgraph that is still non-bipartite. These conditions may all be tested easily in polynomial time; however, the problem of testing whether a 4-edge-colored 4-regular graph has a drawing with edges of four slopes, representing the colors by slopes, is complete for the existential theory of the reals, a complexity class at least as difficult as being NP-complete.

As well as being related to the maximum degree and maximum matching number of a graph, the chromatic index is closely related to the linear arboricity of a graph , the minimum number of linear forests (disjoint unions of paths) into which the graph&#x27;s edges may be partitioned. A matching is a special kind of linear forest, and in the other direction, any linear forest can be 2-edge-colored, so for every it follows that . Akiyama&#x27;s conjecture (named for Jin Akiyama) states that formula_4, from which it would follow more strongly that . For graphs of maximum degree three, is always exactly two, so in this case the bound matches the bound given by Vizing&#x27;s theorem.

==Other types==

The Thue number of a graph is the number of colors required in an edge coloring meeting the stronger requirement that, in every even-length path, the first and second halves of the path form different sequences of colors.

The arboricity of a graph is the minimum number of colors required so that the edges of each color have no cycles (rather than, in the standard edge coloring problem, having no adjacent pairs of edges). That is, it is the minimum number of forests into which the edges of the graph may be partitioned into. Unlike the chromatic index, the arboricity of a graph may be computed in polynomial time.

List edge-coloring is a problem in which one is given a graph in which each edge is associated with a list of colors, and must find a proper edge coloring in which the color of each edge is drawn from that edge&#x27;s list. The list chromatic index of a graph is the smallest number with the property that, no matter how one chooses lists of colors for the edges, as long as each edge has at least colors in its list, then a coloring is guaranteed to be possible. Thus, the list chromatic index is always at least as large as the chromatic index. The Dinitz conjecture on the completion of partial Latin squares may be rephrased as the statement that the list edge chromatic number of the complete bipartite graph equals its edge chromatic number, . resolved the conjecture by proving, more generally, that in every bipartite graph the chromatic index and list chromatic index are equal. The equality between the chromatic index and the list chromatic index has been conjectured to hold, even more generally, for arbitrary multigraphs with no self-loops; this conjecture remains open.

Many other commonly studied variations of vertex coloring have also been extended to edge colorings. For instance, complete edge coloring is the edge-coloring variant of complete coloring, a proper edge coloring in which each pair of colors must be represented by at least one pair of adjacent edges and in which the goal is to maximize the total number of colors. Strong edge coloring is the edge-coloring variant of strong coloring, an edge coloring in which every two edges with adjacent endpoints must have different colors. Strong edge coloring has applications in channel allocation schemes for wireless networks.

Acyclic edge coloring is the edge-coloring variant of acyclic coloring, an edge coloring for which every two color classes form an acyclic subgraph (that is, a forest). The acyclic chromatic index of a graph formula_5, denoted by formula_6, is the smallest number of colors needed to have a proper acyclic edge coloring of formula_5. It has been conjectured that formula_8, where formula_9 is the maximum degree of formula_5. Currently the best known bound is formula_11. The problem becomes easier when formula_5 has large girth. More specifically, there is a constant formula_13 such that if the girth of formula_5 is at least formula_15, then formula_16. A similar result is that for all formula_17 there exists an formula_18 such that if formula_5 has girth at least formula_18, then formula_21.

 studied 3-edge-colorings of cubic graphs with the additional property that no two bichromatic cycles share more than a single edge with each other. He showed that the existence of such a coloring is equivalent to the existence of a drawing of the graph on a three-dimensional integer grid, with edges parallel to the coordinate axes and each axis-parallel line containing at most two vertices. However, like the standard 3-edge-coloring problem, finding a coloring of this type is NP-complete.

Total coloring is a form of coloring that combines vertex and edge coloring, by requiring both the vertices and edges to be colored. Any incident pair of a vertex and an edge, or an edge and an edge, must have distinct colors, as must any two adjacent vertices. It has been conjectured (combining Vizing&#x27;s theorem and Brooks&#x27; theorem) that any graph has a total coloring in which the number of colors is at most the maximum degree plus two, but this remains unproven.

If a 3-regular graph on a surface is 3-edge-colored, its dual graph forms a triangulation of the surface which is also edge colored (although not, in general, properly edge colored) in such a way that every triangle has one edge of each color. Other colorings and orientations of triangulations, with other local constraints on how the colors are arranged at the vertices or faces of the triangulation, may be used to encode several types of geometric object. For instance, rectangular subdivisions (partitions of a rectangular subdivision into smaller rectangles, with three rectangles meeting at every vertex) may be described combinatorially by a &quot;regular labeling&quot;, a two-coloring of the edges of a triangulation dual to the subdivision, with the constraint that the edges incident to each vertex form four contiguous subsequences, within each of which the colors are the same. This labeling is dual to a coloring of the rectangular subdivision itself in which the vertical edges have one color and the horizontal edges have the other color. Similar local constraints on the order in which colored edges may appear around a vertex may also be used to encode straight-line grid embeddings of planar graphs and three-dimensional polyhedra with axis-parallel sides. For each of these three types of regular labelings, the set of regular labelings of a fixed graph forms a distributive lattice that may be used to quickly list all geometric structures based on the same graph (such as all axis-parallel polyhedra having the same skeleton) or to find structures satisfying additional constraints.

A deterministic finite automaton may be interpreted as a directed graph in which each vertex has the same out-degree , and in which the edges are -colored in such a way that every two edges with the same source vertex have distinct colors. The road coloring problem is the problem of edge-coloring a directed graph with uniform out-degrees, in such a way that the resulting automaton has a synchronizing word. solved the road coloring problem by proving that such a coloring can be found whenever the given graph is strongly connected and aperiodic.

Ramsey&#x27;s theorem concerns the problem of -coloring the edges of a large complete graph in order to avoid creating monochromatic complete subgraphs of some given size . According to the theorem, there exists a number such that, whenever , such a coloring is not possible. For instance, , that is, if the edges of the graph are 2-colored, there will always be a monochromatic triangle.

A path in an edge-colored graph is said to be a rainbow path if no color repeats on it. A graph is said to be rainbow colored if there is a rainbow path between any two pairs of vertices.
An edge-colouring of a graph G with colours 1. . . t is an interval t coloring if all colours are used, and the colours of edges incident to each vertex of G are distinct and form an interval of integers.

==Applications==
Edge colorings of complete graphs may be used to schedule a round-robin tournament into as few rounds as possible so that each pair of competitors plays each other in one of the rounds; in this application, the vertices of the graph correspond to the competitors in the tournament, the edges correspond to games, and the edge colors correspond to the rounds in which the games are played. Similar coloring techniques may also be used to schedule other sports pairings that are not all-play-all; for instance, in the National Football League, the pairs of teams that will play each other in a given year are determined, based on the teams&#x27; records from the previous year, and then an edge coloring algorithm is applied to the graph formed by the set of pairings in order to assign games to the weekends on which they are played. For this application, Vizing&#x27;s theorem implies that no matter what set of pairings is chosen (as long as no teams play each other twice in the same season), it is always possible to find a schedule that uses at most one more weekend than there are games per team.

Open shop scheduling is a problem of scheduling production processes, in which there are a set of objects to be manufactured, each object has a set of tasks to be performed on it (in any order), and each task must be performed on a specific machine, preventing any other task that requires the same machine from being performed at the same time. If all tasks have the same length, then this problem may be formalized as one of edge coloring a bipartite multigraph, in which the vertices on one side of the bipartition represent the objects to be manufactured, the vertices on the other side of the bipartition represent the manufacturing machines, the edges represent tasks that must be performed, and the colors represent time steps in which each task may be performed. Since bipartite edge coloring may be performed in polynomial time, the same is true for this restricted case of open shop scheduling.

 study the problem of link scheduling for time-division multiple access network communications protocols on sensor networks as a variant of edge coloring. In this problem, one must choose time slots for the edges of a wireless communications network so that each node of the network can communicate with each neighboring node without interference. Using a strong edge coloring (and using two time slots for each edge color, one for each direction) would solve the problem but might use more time slots than necessary. Instead, they seek a coloring of the directed graph formed by doubling each undirected edge of the network, with the property that each directed edge has a different color from the edges that go out from and from the neighbors of . They propose a heuristic for this problem based on a distributed algorithm for -edge-coloring together with a postprocessing phase that reschedules edges that might interfere with each other.

In fiber-optic communication, the path coloring problem is the problem of assigning colors (frequencies of light) to pairs of nodes that wish to communicate with each other, and paths through a fiber-optic communications network for each pair, subject to the restriction that no two paths that share a segment of fiber use the same frequency as each other. Paths that pass through the same communication switch but not through any segment of fiber are allowed to use the same frequency. When the communications network is arranged as a star network, with a single central switch connected by separate fibers to each of the nodes, the path coloring problem may be modeled exactly as a problem of edge coloring a graph or multigraph, in which the communicating nodes form the graph vertices, pairs of nodes that wish to communicate form the graph edges, and the frequencies that may be used for each pair form the colors of the edge coloring problem. For communications networks with a more general tree topology, local path coloring solutions for the star networks defined by each switch in the network may be patched together to form a single global solution.

==Open problems==
 list 23 open problems concerning edge coloring. They include:
*The conjecture of that the chromatic index and fractional index are within one of each other, which would allow the chromatic index to be approximated within one color in polynomial time.
*Several conjectures of Jakobsen and others on the structure of critical graphs for edge coloring, graphs of class 2 such that any subgraph either has smaller maximum degree or is of class 1. Jakobsen originally conjectured that all critical graphs have an odd number of vertices, but this was eventually disproved. Several other conjectures weakening this one, or bounding the numbers of vertices of critical graphs and critical multigraphs, remain open.
*Vizing&#x27;s problem of classifying the maximum degrees that are possible for class 2 planar graphs.
*The overfull subgraph conjecture of A. J. W. Hilton, stating that graphs with degree at least are either of class 1 or contain a subgraph with the same degree as the original graph, and with an odd number of vertices, such that the number of edges in the subgraph is greater than , and a similar conjecture by Herbert Grötzsch and Paul Seymour concerning planar graphs in place of high-degree graphs.
*A conjecture of Amanda Chetwynd and Anthony Hilton (possibly going back earlier to the work of Gabriel Andrew Dirac) that regular graphs with an even number of vertices and with degree at least are of class 1.
*A conjecture of Claude Berge and D. R. Fulkerson that the 6-regular multigraphs formed by doubling every edge of a bridgeless 3-regular simple graph may be edge-colored with six colors.
*A conjecture of Fiorini and Wilson that every triangle-free planar graph, other than the claw &quot;K&quot;1,3, is not uniquely 3-edge-colorable.
* A 2012 conjecture that if is a -regular planar multigraph, then is -edge-colorable if and only if is oddly -edge-connected. This conjecture is a generalization of the four color theorem, which arises at =3. Maria Chudnovsky, Katherine Edwards, and Paul Seymour proved that an 8-regular planar multigraph has an edge chromatic number of 8.

<doc id="690648" wikidata="Q15524938" url="?curid=690648" title="Virgil Bogue">
<text>Virgil Gay Bogue (1846–1916) was an American civil engineer who worked initially in his home state of New York before taking jobs internationally and in the western and northwestern United States. He primarily worked for railroads, though also became involved in city planning.

==Civil engineering==
Bogue was born in Norfolk, New York, on July 16, 1846, the son of George Charles and Mary W. (Perry) Bogue. He received a degree in civil engineering from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York, in 1868.

Bogue worked consecutively on Oroya Railway in Peru to 1879, the Northern Pacific Railway to 1886. On the Northern Pacific, he named Pasco, Washington after a region known for vicious sandstorms he had seen while in South America; built the Northern Pacific and Puget Sound Shore Railroad connecting Tacoma, Washington to Seattle, Washington; and discovered Stampede Pass.

After the Northern Pacific, Bogue served as chief engineer of the Union Pacific Railroad until 1891. Following this, he was also chief engineer on the Western Maryland Railway and headed up the construction of the Western Pacific Railroad through California&#x27;s rugged Feather River Canyon.

As a consulting engineer, Bogue worked on Columbia River Navigation, Commencement Bay and Grays Harbor, the New Zealand Railway, the New York Department of Public Works, and finally, shortly before his death, the Greater Seattle Plan. Bogue died at sea aboard the steamship &quot;Esperanza&quot; on October 14, 1916.

His &quot;Bogue Plan&quot; was rejected by voters on March 5, 1912, by a 10,000-vote margin. It would have established Seattle&#x27;s first comprehensive plan and a variety of improvements, including a civic center in the new Denny Regrade area. The civic center was eventually realized five decades later as Seattle Center, more or less in the location Bogue proposed.

<text>The Frye Art Museum is a modern and contemporary art museum in the First Hill neighborhood of Seattle, Washington. It was founded in 1952 to house the collection of Charles and Emma Frye and has since grown to include rotating temporary exhibitions of emerging and contemporary artists.

The museum emphasizes painting and sculpture from the nineteenth century to the present. Its holdings originated from the private collection of Charles H. Frye (1858–1940) and Emma Lamp Frye (d. 1934). The Fryes&#x27; were first-generation Americans of German descent who collected primarily German and Austrian artwork, often purchased directly from studios in Munich.

Charles Frye was the owner of a local meatpacking plant in Seattle. He set aside money in his will for a museum to house the Fryes&#x27; collection of 232 paintings. The Fryes&#x27; collection was first offered to the Seattle Art Museum but it was declined due to restrictions stipulated in the will which specified that the artwork must be on permanent display, be shown under natural light, not be shown with abstract work, and that admission to view the works remain free of charge. After Charles and Emma Frye had both died and following the sale of their home in 1941, many of their collected paintings, overseen by Walser Greathouse, were moved to the meat plant on Airport Way in SoDo, Seattle. The stored artwork survived a major fire at the plant on Feb. 18, 1943, following the crash of a B-29 bomber prototype, then a top-secret military project.

The Frye Art Museum was built in Seattle&#x27;s First Hill neighborhood and opened to the public in 1952 as a free art museum.

The Fryes&#x27; historic collection consisted of representational art works, with a tendency toward &quot;the dark, the dramatic, and the psychological&quot; rather than &quot;the genteel&quot;. The museum&#x27;s permanent collection reflects Charles Frye&#x27;s relatively conservative artistic tastes, and initially, the museum continued to be dedicated to representational art, both in its acquisitions and its exhibits. This conservatism reflected the artistic and social values of its first director, Walser Greathouse (d. 1966) and of his widow and successor Ida Kay Greathouse, who ran the museum until 1993.

After 2007 the artwork presented and collected by the museum shifted, contrary to the restrictions stipulated in Charles Frye&#x27;s will, to include more contemporary forms such as Conceptual Art, eliciting comparisons to Seattle&#x27;s Henry Art Gallery.

== Architecture ==
The building for the Frye Art Museum was originally designed by architect Paul Thiry. In the mid 1990s the museum was expanded and renovated by architect Rick Sundberg of Olson Sundberg Kundig Allen Architects. The museum added a 142-seat auditorium and an education studio as part of the renovation.

== Exhibitions and programs ==
Exhibitions have included &quot;Subspontaneous: Francesca Lohmann and Rob Rhee,&quot; featuring sculptures involving natural forces and ecological growth, &quot;Agnieszka Polska: Love Bite,&quot; and &quot;Unsettling Femininity: Selections from the Frye Art Museum Collection.&quot; The museum often redeploys its permanent collection, experimenting with exhibiting it in different arrangements. In 2018, the museum had 109,249 total attendees and a membership base of 2,383.

Contemporary artists and groups exhibited at The Frye have included the performance group Degenerate Art Ensemble, First Nations indigenous artist Duane Linklater, American painter Christina Quarles, and African-American filmmaker and multimedia artist Cauleen Smith.

In 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the museum temporarily closed for in-person visits and provided online art viewing and educational opportunities through the Frye From Home program. On August 28, 2020, the museum announced its expectation to reopen for in-person visits in October 2020.

==Collection==
The Frye Art Museum&#x27;s collection highlights many kinds of paintings, prints, works on paper, and sculptures. Artists represented in the museum&#x27;s collection include Eugène Boudin, Nicolai Fechin, William-Adolphe Bouguereau, Félix Ziem, Eugène Isabey, Franz von Lenbach, Tim Lowly, Fritz von Uhde (&quot;Picture Book&quot;), Hermann Corrodi (&quot;Venice&quot;), Ludwig von Zumbusch, Leopold Schmutzler, and Franz Stuck (&quot;Judgment of Paris&quot;).

==Library==
The Frye Art Museum library contains more than 2,000 books. It specializes in 19th and 20th century American and German art.

<text>Tigernmas, son of Follach, son of Ethriel, a descendant of Érimón, was, according to medieval Irish legend and historical traditions, an early High King of Ireland.

According to the &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; he became king when he overthrew his predecessor Conmáel in the Battle of Óenach Macha, and within a year of his accession had won twenty-seven battles against the descendants of Eber Finn, almost completely destroying Eber&#x27;s line. It is said that during his reign gold was first smelted in Ireland, by the wright Iuchadán. Tigernmas was the first king to give drinking-horns to his followers, and the first to have clothes dyed purple, blue and green and decorated with brooches, fringes and ornaments. Seven lakes and three rivers burst from the ground during his reign. After reigning for seventy-seven years (or 100 years according to the Book of Fenagh, P 23), he and three-quarters of the men of Ireland died on Magh Slécht while worshipping Crom Cruach, a cruel deity propitiated with human sacrifice. According to the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot;, Ireland was without a High King for seven years after his death, before Eochaid Étgudach took the kingship.

The &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot; synchronises his reign with the deaths of Thineas and Decylas, kings of Assyria, and the reigns of David and Solomon in Israel; the &quot;Laud Synchronisms&quot; with the Judean kings Asa and Jehoshaphat and the Assyrian king Pertiades (Pyriatides) 985 B.C. The &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; dates his reign to 1621–1544 BC; Geoffrey Keating to 1209–1159 BC.

<doc id="690652" wikidata="Q895167" url="?curid=690652" title="Bounty (chocolate bar)">
<text>Bounty is a coconut-filled, chocolate-enrobed candy bar manufactured by Mars Inc., introduced in 1951 in the United Kingdom and Canada.

It is an imitation of the Mounds bar introduced by Peter Paul in 1936. The Bounty is no longer domestically sold within the United States, only being available via import sales.

==Flavours==
Bounty has a coconut filling, enrobed with milk chocolate (in a blue wrapper) or dark chocolate (in a red wrapper) and is usually sold as two small bars wrapped in one package.

Since 2006, a cherry-flavoured version has also been available in Australia. This was initially a limited edition flavour, but remained available as of 2013. In Europe, a limited edition mango flavour was available in 2004-05 and in Russia and Ukraine in 2010. A pineapple-flavoured edition was available in Russia during 2014.

Although Bounty is no longer distributed by Mars in the United States, similar products, such as Mounds and Almond Joy, are marketed by Hershey&#x27;s.

On 3 November 2022, it was announced that Bounty bars would be removed from some Celebrations tubs in the United Kingdom after the manufacturers found that 40% of people hated them. A limited run of &quot;No Bounty&quot; tubs would be available, in the weeks before Christmas. But a final decision had not been made after 18% of people named the Bounty as their favourite.

Since November 2022 the dark chocolate Bounty has not been available. Mars UK said in September 2023 that &quot;we have temporarily had to delist Bounty Dark for operational reasons and we’re working hard to bring the product back when we can&quot;.

==Advertising==

Early advertisement described the bar as &quot;the new chocolate thrill from the South Seas&quot;. Guardian journalist Emma Hughes viewed the 1951 introduction of the product as responding to a &quot;new mood of postwar optimism and people&#x27;s longing for sunny foreign travel&quot;.

In the 1970s the bar was promoted in television adverts showing a tropical beach scene and the tag-line &quot;The Bounty hunters — They came in search of paradise.&quot; In 1996 the format was radically changed, after a £2m investment from the manufacturer, Mars Inc.

<doc id="690653" wikidata="Q1569670" url="?curid=690653" title="Nang yai">
<text>Nang yai (, ) is a form of shadow play found in Thailand. Puppets are made of painted buffalo hide, while the story is narrated by songs, chants and music.

&quot;&quot; means &quot;leather&quot; (&quot;leather puppet&quot; in this case), and in common usage refers to a dance-drama shadow puppet show. &quot;Nang yai&quot;, whose name specifically means &quot;large shadow puppet&quot;, features life-size puppets, while &quot;nang talung&quot; (a similar tradition of shadow puppetry whose name derives from Pattalung, a southern city where the tradition has long been popular) features much smaller puppets. Both are particularly popular in southern Thailand. According to James Brandon, most scholars believe that &quot;nang yai&quot; came to Thailand via Java and the Malay Peninsula from India.
&quot;Nang yai&quot; and &quot;nang talung&quot; incorporate various episodes of the Indian epic &quot;Ramayana&quot; (known as the &quot;Ramakien&quot; in Thailand). The art form&#x27;s traditions originated around the beginning of the 15th century. &quot;Nang yai&quot; performances were a popular means of entertainment during the Ayudhaya period and are mentioned in a poem called &quot;Bunnovat Khamchan&quot;, written by the Buddhist monk Mahanag sometime around the years 1751 to 1758, at the end of King Boromakot&#x27;s reign. The earliest known mention of &quot;nang yai&quot; in Thai records is from 1458, according to Brandon.
Performances are traditionally held in open spaces such as a lawn or village dirt space. A white cloth screen about long and high, with a decorated border, is stretched across the stage. Behind the screen, a bonfire is lit to project the puppets&#x27; shadows (electric lights are often used instead now). During the show, a Thai instrumental ensemble (usually a &quot;piphat&quot;) plays music appropriate to each episode, synchronized with the puppets&#x27; action. Offstage reciters tell the story in a sort of heightened speech. The puppet figures are made from perforated cow or buffalo hide, each weighing about three or four kilograms. The biggest puppet is one which characterizes a place, weighing around five to seven kilograms.

&quot;Nang yai&quot; influenced &quot;that khon&quot;, a dance-drama art form from Thailand which involves masked pantomime.

&quot;Nang yai&quot; can be found throughout Thailand. For example, in central Thailand, &quot;nang yai&quot; is performed at Wat Khanon in Ratchaburi, Wat Plub in Petchaburi, Wat Sawang Arom in Singburi, and Wat Pumarin in Samut Songkhram, while in eastern Thailand it can be found at Wat Donin in Rayong Province.

==Monuments==
Lake View includes the Nisei War Memorial Monument, a 21-foot column erected in 1949, listing the names of 47 Japanese American soldiers from Seattle who were killed during World War II. The Nisei Veterans Committee, in response to the US Army&#x27;s plans in late 1947 to return Washington&#x27;s Nisei war dead, began a door-to-door fundraising campaign in the Puget Sound region, collecting donations of $1 to $5, and raising over $10,000 to construct the memorial. Later, 9 more names of Seattle area service members of Japanese ancestry killed in Korea, Vietnam and Granada were added to names on the memorial.

The cemetery has a memorial to Confederate veterans erected in 1926 by Seattle&#x27;s chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, near the site of 11 graves, the only burial ground in the Northwest of Confederate soldiers. During the 2020 George Floyd protests, the memorial was toppled by unknown persons on July 3, 2020. It had been criticized by protestors, and targeted with vandalism and graffiti in recent years.

<text>Volunteer Park is a park in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, United States.

==History==
Volunteer Park was acquired by the city of Seattle in 1876 from J.M. Colman at a cost of $2,000. When Seattle Cemetery became Denny Park in 1884, the bodies interred there were moved to Washelli Cemetery, at the site of the future park. It soon became apparent that the land would be better suited to park use and the bodies were moved once again, this time to Lake View Cemetery; the park was renamed Lake View Park. This caused considerable confusion, leading to another renaming to City Park in 1887. J. Willis Sayre, a Seattle theatre critic, journalist and historian who had fought in the Spanish–American War, actively lobbied local officials to rename it once again - as Volunteer Park, to honor the volunteers who served in the war.

Volunteer Park is one of the highlights of Seattle&#x27;s Olmsted park and boulevard system. The Board of Park Commissioners brought John Charles Olmsted, of the Olmsted Brothers&#x27; Landscape Architects firm, to Seattle in 1903 to design a park system which would provide open space and help guide development in the rapidly growing city. In Olmsted&#x27;s first comprehensive plan, Volunteer Park served as the central park of the system due to its location near downtown.

Hired that same year to develop plans for Volunteer Park, Olmsted and his associates studied the landscape and built the plans around its natural beauty. Taking advantage of its ridgetop location, Olmsted ran one axis of the park&#x27;s plan along the top of the hill, laying out a concourse running north and south through the park. It is lined with an allé of chestnut trees stretching between the two ends of the drive. A second axis runs through the city&#x27;s municipal water system reservoir, which had been built in 1901. At the intersection of the two axes, he placed a concert grove, pergola, and terraced planting beds flanked by lily ponds.

On the eastern side of the park, paths looped around the concert grove and connected the interior of the park with the streetcar stop at 15th Avenue East and East Prospect Street. Large lawns surrounded by planting beds and groves of trees filled the interior. Multi-layered plantings filled planting beds on the perimeter of the park on the east, south, and west, to buffer the park from the city beyond its borders. On the western side of the park, the landscape featured lawns and more wooded areas. A carriage drive looped down the slope and around the reservoir connecting with the concourse drive at its northern and southern ends.

The original 1904 plan had a small children&#x27;s playground at the northwest corner of the park. It included a shelterhouse with restrooms and a covered area that provided seating for caregivers as their charges enjoyed the sandboxes, swings, “Little Folks Lawn,” and wading pool. A revised 1909 plan added a playground for larger children at the request of playground advocates. Neighbors objected to its location on account of the noise potential, and this playground was moved to the northeast corner of the park.

The northern edge of the park is largely reserved for the work areas of the park. The caretaker&#x27;s cottage, the greenhouses, and other facilities are located along the northern fenceline. The conservatory was added in 1912, built from a kit purchased from the Hitchings Company of New York.

The pergola Olmsted sited on the concourse featured a “concert grove” on its east side. It is shown on Olmsted plans as a cluster of trees adjacent to a covered shelter in the middle of the pergola. In 1915, the Park Department built a bandshell, designed by prominent Seattle architect Carl Gould, on the edge of the lawn north of the reservoir. Olmsted objected to its siting there because of its intrusion on the greensward – the great lawn, but it better served the type of musical performances that were popular at that time. It was a wooden structure and had to be torn down in 1947 because of rotted timbers. A new stage structure, designed by Rich Haag, was built in 1971.

An effort by the Washington State Art Association to build a museum in the park was rebuffed in 1910. Olmsted argued that, “Volunteer Park is obviously a landscape park – not an ornamental public square nor primarily a public playground. The conclusion is evident that the proposed art museum is not suggested as a means for the public to enjoy the landscape of the park… Owing to its size and style of architecture, the art museum is in no way to be subordinate to the park landscape, but on the contrary the museum would completely dominate a large part if not the whole of the park… destroying much of the landscape value of this park.” The issue would arise again, however, when the Fuller family offered to donate funding for construction of a museum for the Seattle Art Institute. The Park Department accepted the offer and the Seattle Art Museum was built in 1932. It would serve as home to the Seattle Art Museum until 1991, when a new building was constructed downtown. The Volunteer Park building became the new home of SAM’s Asian art collections and was renamed Seattle Asian Art Museum.

==Features==
The park includes a conservatory (a designated city landmark) which was completed in 1912; an amphitheater; a water tower with an observation deck, built by the Water Department in 1906, a fenced-off reservoir; the dramatic Art Deco building of the Seattle Asian Art Museum (a designated city landmark); a statue of William H. Seward; a memorial to Judge Thomas Burke; and a sculpture, &quot;Black Sun&quot;, by Isamu Noguchi (colloquially referred to as &quot;The Doughnut&quot;), around which a scenic view of the Seattle skyline that prominently features the Space Needle can be seen, as well as several meadows and picnic tables. The wading pool is operational in the summer months and operates daily from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.

Volunteer Park is also well known for its extensive dahlia garden in season. There are also koi ponds at the park which are home to the fish during the summer months.

==Events==
The park hosts various free concerts and outdoor theater events throughout the year. There are also picnic tables for birthday parties and ample space for outdoor sports like touch football, frisbee and various field day activities.

<text>Parathion, also called parathion-ethyl or diethyl parathion, is an organophosphate insecticide and acaricide. It was originally developed by IG Farben in the 1940s. It is highly toxic to non-target organisms, including humans, so its use has been banned or restricted in most countries. In response to safety concerns, the less toxic but still dangerous analogue parathion methyl was later developed.

==History==

Parathion was developed by Gerhard Schrader for the German trust IG Farben in the 1940s. After World War II and the collapse of IG Farben due to the war crime trials, the Western allies seized the patent, and parathion was marketed worldwide by different companies and under different brand names. The most common German brand was E605 (banned in Germany after 2002); this was not a food-additive &quot;E number&quot; as used in the EU today. &quot;E&quot; stands for &quot;Entwicklungsnummer&quot; (German for &quot;development number&quot;). It is an irreversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor.

Safety concerns later led to the development of parathion methyl, which is somewhat less toxic.

In the EU, Parathion was banned after 2001. In Switzerland, the substance is no longer approved as a pesticide.

==Handling properties==
Pure parathion is a white crystalline solid. It is commonly distributed as a brown liquid that smells of rotting eggs or garlic. The insecticide is somewhat stable, although it darkens when exposed to sunlight.

==Industrial synthesis==
Parathion is synthesized from diethyl dithiophosphoric acid by chlorination to generate diethylthiophosphoryl chloride (), and then the chloride is treated with sodium 4-nitrophenolate (the sodium salt of 4-nitrophenol).
:

==Applications==
As a pesticide, parathion is generally applied by spraying. It is often applied to cotton, rice and fruit trees. The usual concentrations of ready-to-use solutions are 0.05 to 0.1%. The chemical is banned for use on many food crops.

==Insecticidal activity==
Parathion acts on the enzyme acetylcholinesterase indirectly. After an insect (or a human) ingests parathion, an oxidase replaces the double bonded sulfur with oxygen to give paraoxon.

The phosphate ester is more reactive in organisms than the phosphorothiolate ester, as the phosphorus atoms become much more electropositive.

Parathion is a special case of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor resistance.

==Degradation==
Degradation of parathion leads to more water-soluble products. Hydrolysis, which deactivates the molecule, occurs at the aryl ester bond resulting in diethyl thiophosphate and 4-nitrophenol.
Degradation proceeds differently under anaerobic conditions: the nitro group on parathion is reduced to the amine.

==Safety==
Parathion is a cholinesterase inhibitor. It generally disrupts the nervous system by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase. It is absorbed via skin, mucous membranes, and orally. Absorbed parathion is rapidly metabolized to paraoxon, as described in Insecticidal activity. Paraoxon exposure can result in headaches, convulsions, poor vision, vomiting, abdominal pain, severe diarrhea, unconsciousness, tremor, dyspnea, and finally pulmonary edema as well as respiratory arrest. Symptoms of poisoning are known to last for extended periods, sometimes months. The most common and very specific antidote is atropine, in doses of up to 100 mg daily. Because atropine may also be toxic, it is recommended that small frequently repeated doses be used in treatment. If human poisoning is detected early and the treatment is prompt (atropine and artificial respiration), fatalities are infrequent. Insufficient oxygen will lead to cerebral hypoxia and permanent brain damage. Peripheral neuropathy including paralysis is noticed as late sequelae after recovery from acute intoxication. Parathion and related organophosphorus pesticides are used in hundreds of thousands of poisonings annually, especially suicides. It is known as &quot;Schwiegermuttergift&quot; (mother-in-law poison) in Germany. For this reason, most formulations contain a blue dye providing warning.

Parathion was used as a chemical warfare agent, most notably by an element of the British South Africa Police attached to the Selous Scouts during the Rhodesian Bush War. They used it to poison clothing that was then supplied to anti-government guerrillas. When the enemy soldiers put on the clothes, they were poisoned by absorption through the skin.

Based on animal studies, parathion is considered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to be a possible human carcinogen. Studies show that parathion is toxic to fetuses, but does not cause birth defects.

It is classified by the United Nations Environment Programme as a persistent organic pollutant and by the World Health Organization as Toxicity Class Ia (extremely hazardous).

Parathion is toxic to bees, fish, birds, and other forms of wildlife.

===Protection against poisoning===
To provide the end user with a minimum standard of protection, suitable protective gloves, clothing, and a respirator with organic-vapour cartridges is normally worn. Industrial safety during the production process requires special ventilation and continuous measurement of air contamination in order not to exceed PEL levels, as well as careful attention to personal hygiene. Frequent analysis of workers&#x27; serum acetylcholinesterase activity is also helpful with regards to occupational safety, because the action of parathion is cumulative. Also, atropine has been used as a specific antidote.

=== Use in suicides ===
A chemist swallowed of parathion to find the most lethal means of exposure to humans, intending to take an antidote afterwards, but was paralyzed and so died before he could reach it.

Parathion was commonly used for suicides in the 1950s and 1960s.

<doc id="690669" wikidata="Q1130404" url="?curid=690669" title="List coloring">
<text>In graph theory, a branch of mathematics, list coloring is a type of graph coloring where each vertex can be restricted to a list of allowed colors. It was first studied in the 1970s in independent papers by Vizing
and by Erdős, Rubin, and Taylor.

==Definition==

Given a graph and given a set of colors for each vertex (called a list), a list coloring is a &quot;choice function&quot; that maps every vertex to a color in the list . As with graph coloring, a list coloring is generally assumed to be proper, meaning no two adjacent vertices receive the same color. A graph is -choosable (or -list-colorable) if it has a proper list coloring no matter how one assigns a list of colors to each vertex. The choosability (or list colorability or list chromatic number) of a graph is the least number such that is -choosable.

More generally, for a function assigning a positive integer to each vertex , a graph is -choosable (or -list-colorable) if it has a list coloring no matter how one assigns a list of colors to each vertex . In particular, if for all vertices , -choosability corresponds to -choosability.

==Examples==
Consider the complete bipartite graph , having six vertices , , , , , such that and are each connected to all of , , , and , and no other vertices are connected. As a bipartite graph, has usual chromatic number 2: one may color and in one color and , , , in another and no two adjacent vertices will have the same color. On the other hand, has list-chromatic number larger than 2, as the following construction shows: assign to and the lists {red, blue} and {green, black}. Assign to the other four vertices the lists {red, green}, {red, black}, {blue, green}, and {blue, black}. No matter which choice one makes of a color from the list of and a color from the list of , there will be some other vertex such that both of its choices are already used to color its neighbors. Thus, is not 2-choosable.

On the other hand, it is easy to see that is 3-choosable: picking arbitrary colors for the vertices and leaves at least one available color for each of the remaining vertices, and these colors may be chosen arbitrarily.
More generally, let be a positive integer, and let be the complete bipartite graph . Let the available colors be represented by the different two-digit numbers in radix .
On one side of the bipartition, let the vertices be given sets of colors } in which the first digits are equal to each other, for each of the possible choices of the first digit .
On the other side of the bipartition, let the vertices be given sets of colors } in which the first digits are all distinct, for each of the possible choices of the -tuple 
The illustration shows a larger example of the same construction, with .

Then, does not have a list coloring for : no matter what set of colors is chosen for the vertices on the small side of the bipartition, this choice will conflict with all of the colors for one of the vertices on the other side of the bipartition. For instance if the vertex with color set {00,01} is colored 01, and the vertex with color set {10,11} is colored 10, then the vertex with color set {01,10} cannot be colored.
Therefore, the list chromatic number of is at least .

Similarly, if formula_1 then the complete bipartite graph is not -choosable. For, suppose that colors are available in total, and that, on a single side of the bipartition, each vertex has available to it a different -tuple of these colors than each other vertex. Then, each side of the bipartition must use at least colors, because every set of colors will be disjoint from the list of one vertex. Since at least colors are used on one side and at least are used on the other, there must be one color which is used on both sides, but this implies that two adjacent vertices have the same color. In particular, the utility graph has list-chromatic number at least three, and the graph has list-chromatic number at least four.

==Properties==

For a graph , let denote the chromatic number and the maximum degree of . The list coloring number satisfies the following properties.
# . A -list-colorable graph must in particular have a list coloring when every vertex is assigned the same list of colors, which corresponds to a usual -coloring.
# cannot be bounded in terms of chromatic number in general, that is, there is no function such that holds for every graph . In particular, as the complete bipartite graph examples show, there exist graphs with but with arbitrarily large.
# where is the number of vertices of .
# if is a planar graph.
# if is a bipartite planar graph.

==Computing choosability and (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;)-choosability==

Two algorithmic problems have been considered in the literature:
# -&quot;choosability&quot;: decide whether a given graph is -choosable for a given , and
# -&quot;choosability&quot;: decide whether a given graph is -choosable for a given function formula_2.
It is known that -choosability in bipartite graphs is formula_3-complete for any , and the same applies for 4-choosability in planar graphs, 3-choosability in planar triangle-free graphs, and (2, 3)-choosability in bipartite planar graphs. For -free graphs, that is, graphs excluding a 5-vertex path graph, -choosability is fixed-parameter tractable.
It is possible to test whether a graph is 2-choosable in linear time by repeatedly deleting vertices of degree zero or one until reaching the 2-core of the graph, after which no more such deletions are possible. The initial graph is 2-choosable if and only if its 2-core is either an even cycle or a theta graph formed by three paths with shared endpoints, with two paths of length two and the third path having any even length.

==Applications==

List coloring arises in practical problems concerning channel/frequency assignment.

<text>The Yugoslav First League (Bosnian: Prva savezna liga u fudbalu, , , , , , ) was the premier football league in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1918–1941) and Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1945–1992).

The First League Championship was one of two national competitions held annually in Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav Cup being the other.

The league became fully professional in 1967.

==Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1923–1940)==
This was the first club competition on a national level for clubs from Kingdom of Yugoslavia (named the &quot;Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes&quot; until 1930). The league was started in 1923 and the first four seasons had a cup tournament format, while the first round-robin league competition was held in 1927. In the period from 1927 to 1940 seventeen seasons were completed, with all the titles won by clubs from Croatia (Građanski Zagreb, Concordia Zagreb, HAŠK Zagreb and Hajduk Split) or Serbia (BSK Belgrade and Jugoslavija Belgrade).

It was governed at first by the Croatian-named &quot;Nogometni Savez Jugoslavije (Football Association of Yugoslavia)&quot;, founded in April 1919 in Zagreb, until in late 1929 disagreements arose between the Zagreb and Belgrade branches of the association. This resulted in the association headquarters being moved to Belgrade in May 1930 where it adopted the Serbian name &quot;Fudbalski Savez Jugoslavije&quot; and continued operating the league until it was suspended due to the outbreak of World War II. Consequently, with the moving of headquarters, Croatian players and coaches boycotted Yugoslavia national team. With the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia, separate Croatian and Serbian leagues were established, which operated during the World War II.

Over the years the Yugoslav First League featured many different teams, but there were always a number of teams that stood out, typically from the bigger cities. Among these were:

===UEFA coefficients===

The following data indicates historical Yugoslav coefficient rankings among European football leagues.
== Successor leagues ==
The 1990–91 season was the last season held in its usual format, with clubs from all federative units participating in the championship. The breakup of the country also broke up its top-flight league into several smaller ones.

The UEFA recognised the First League of FR Yugoslavia as its successor league.

=== Slovenia and Croatia depart ===
In June 1991 Slovenia declared independence and Croatia followed suit in October of the same year. This meant that their football associations separated from the Football Association of Yugoslavia so they both started their own football leagues. The Slovenian PrvaLiga was launched in late 1991, while the Croatian Prva HNL saw its first edition in 1992. Affected by the ongoing war in Croatia, the season was held over the course of a single calendar year, from February to June 1992. Both leagues have been going on ever since.

=== 1991–92 season ===
The 1991–92 season was the last season held officially under the name of SFR Yugoslavia, even though Slovenian and Croatian clubs have already abandoned the competition to play in their own leagues. Clubs from the remaining four federative units all took part in the competition, but since the Bosnian War broke out towards the end of the season, Bosnian clubs never finished it, with Željezničar of Sarajevo only managed to play 17 out of 33 scheduled fixtures, while Sloboda Tuzla and Velež Mostar ended the season with a few games short of completing the season. Still, since most of the games were played as planned, Crvena Zvezda of Belgrade is credited with winning the last Yugoslav First League championship.

=== Macedonia and FR Yugoslavia ===
Macedonian clubs abandoned the competition after the 1991–92 season because the new Macedonian First League was launched the following season. For the 1992–93 season Bosnian clubs were all on hiatus due to full blown fighting that developed there, with the sole exception of Borac of Banja Luka (the strongest Bosnian Serb side at the time) which temporarily moved to Belgrade and joined the newly formed league featuring clubs from Serbia and Montenegro, this time restyled as the First League of FR Yugoslavia. (Serbia and Montenegro, the only ones left after other four member republics declared independence, renamed their country Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.) The league lasted under that name until the 2002–03 season, when the country changed its name so the league was renamed First League of Serbia and Montenegro. Finally, in June 2006 Montenegro declared independence and peacefully departed the union, so from the 2006–07 season onwards Montenegro started operating separate top-flight football league supervised by its football association. On the other hand, as the legal successor of Serbia-Montenegro state union, Serbia also got the continuity of the country&#x27;s league that was formed as Prva liga (First League) in 1992, and renamed and rebranded as Superliga in summer 2005.

=== Bosnia and Herzegovina ===
Bosnia and Herzegovina proclaimed independence in late winter 1992, and already in April same year N/FSBiH applied for membership with FIFA and UEFA. Meanwhile, due to the outbreak of Bosnian War in April 1992 no games were played in the 1992–93 season. In late 1993 some parts of the country re-launched football competitions with reduced scope. But just as the country was divided along ethnic lines, so was football.

In 1993 Bosnian Croats launched the First League of Herzeg-Bosnia in which only Croatian clubs competed on parochial scale within the limits of West Herzegovina and few other enclaves. In the same year Bosnian Serbs also organized their own First League of the Republika Srpska, on a territory held by Republika Srpska regime at the time.
Only football on a territory under the control of then Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina institutions and auspices of N/FSBiH, at the time consequently with Bosniak majority, apart from a brief competition for the season 1994–95 (won by Čelik Zenica), came to a standstill.
Competition under auspices of N/FSBiH did not resume until 1995–96 season when the First League of Bosnia and Herzegovina was launched.

These three separate football leagues were operating in Bosnia and Herzegovina until 1998, and 2000. Since FIFA and UEFA showed support only for the association operating under patronage of the official and internationally recognized state institutions, during the war and prior to &quot;Dayton Peace Agreement&quot; as well as after its signage, they endorsed unification of all three organizations as N/FSBiH. This also came as a consequence of FIFA decision to recognize N/FSBiH already in July 1996, while in the same year UEFA admitted N/FSBiH as an adjacent member until 1998 when they recognized its full membership. This meant that only N/FSBiH clubs and its national team could compete at the international and official level.

Final unification has been preceded by several stages. At first was created a playoff where clubs were playing for the champion under N/FSBiH auspices. Idea was that playoff under unified N/FSBiH auspices should bring together clubs competing under three separate organizations for the first time but was rejected by Serb association, leaving clubs from Croat football association and N/FSBiH participating playoff for the seasons 1997–98 and 1999–00, while 1998–99 playoff was canceled due to Croat&#x27;s association hesitation on the decision on which stadiums games should be played. Next season playoff was resumed for the last time prior to full and final agreement on unified N/FSBiH and its competition, Premier League BiH &quot;(Premijer Liga)&quot;, in the fall 2000. However, the first 2000–01 season seen clubs from Federation of BiH only, while clubs from Republic of Srpska entity continue to compete in their own separate league as their entity association still refused to join agreed unified N/FSBiH and its new competition. However, UEFA and FIFA never intended to recognize this separate organization nor its competition, which meant clubs couldn&#x27;t compete outside territory of the entity and wouldn&#x27;t see any international football. This situation forced clubs to insist that their organization also join N/FSBiH, and two years later they became part of the competition for the season 2002–03. Ever since the year 2000 Premier League is the top tier of Bosnia and Herzegovina football, with two entity-based leagues, First League of Republika Srpska and First League of the Federation of BiH, being pushed to the second tier of the football pyramid and serve as feeder leagues to Premier League.

===Today&#x27;s top flight successors===
* → Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina (2000–present; from 1994 to 2000 had a First League of Bosnia and Herzegovina)
* → HNL (1992–present)
* → Football Superleague of Kosovo (2016–present)
* → Macedonian First League (1992–present)
* → Montenegrin First League (2006–present; from 1992 to 2006 had a joint league with Serbia)
* → Serbian SuperLiga (2006–present, from 1992 to 2006 had a joint league with Montenegro)
* → Slovenian PrvaLiga (1991–present)

UEFA recognised FR Yugoslavia and subsequently Serbia as the only official successor of Yugoslavia and consequently the clubs from FR Yugoslavia kept the ranking and ponctuation within UEFA.

<text>The Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Nogometni/Fudbalski Savez Bosne i Hercegovine (N/FSBiH); Ногометни/Фудбалски Савез Босне и Херцеговине (Н/ФСБиХ), (FSBiH); unified abbreviation N/FSBiH), based in Sarajevo, is the chief officiating body of football in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Bosnian football association was founded as the Sarajevo football sub-association of Yugoslavia in 1920. In 1992, the association was re-founded as the Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

In May 2002, the Football Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina was unified to include both Bosnian regional football associations, the Football Association of Republika Srpska, and the already unified Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina with the Football Federation of Herzeg-Bosnia. In April 2011, it changed its name from the Football Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

==History==
===Pre-independence (1903–1992)===
The game reached Bosnia and Herzegovina at the start of the 20th century, with Sarajevo (in 1903) and Mostar (in 1905) being the first cities to embrace it. Banja Luka, Tuzla, Zenica and Bihać were next along with numerous smaller towns as the sport spread. The country was under Austro-Hungarian rule when official competition began in 1908, though these activities were on a small scale within each territory. At the outbreak of World War I, there were five clubs in Sarajevo, four based on religious and ethnic affiliation: SAŠK as Bosnian Croatian, Slavija affiliated to Bosnian Serbs, Bosniaks Đerzelez (also known as &quot;Sarajevski&quot;) and Makabi Sarajevo (also known as &quot;Barkohba&quot;) as Bosnian Jewish club; while only multi-ethnic was worker&#x27;s club RŠD Hajduk. Along with Sarajevo-based clubs there were approximately 20 outside the capital. The creation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia post 1918 brought an increase in the number of leagues, and soon a domestic national championship was organised featuring two teams from Bosnia and Herzegovina, the champions of Banja Luka football sub-association and Sarajevo football sub-association. In 1920, the direct predecessor of the football association of Bosnia-Herzegovina was founded as the Sarajevo football subassociation. The unified championship ran until 1939/40.

The Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina was founded after the Second World War, being affiliated to the Yugoslav Football Association.

Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s best sides at the time were FK Sarajevo, FK Željezničar (Sarajevo), FK Velež (Mostar), FK Sloboda (Tuzla), NK Čelik (Zenica) and FK Borac (Banja Luka) which played in the Yugoslavian first league, second league and cup competitions with moderate to good success, while its best players with the likes of Predrag Pašić, Vahid Halilhodžić, Davor Jozić, Safet Sušić, Josip Katalinski, Faruk Hadžibegić, Ivica Osim, Asim Ferhatović, Blaž Slišković, Mehmed Baždarević, Dušan Bajević, Edhem Šljivo, Enver Marić and many others were chosen to represent SFR Yugoslavia national football team.

===Post-independence (1992–present)===

During the season 1997–98 Bosnia-Herzegovina football league competition included both Bosniak and Bosnian Croat clubs playing against each other for the first time. Before this, the leagues ran strictly divided along ethnic lines. Bosnian Serb clubs joined the league system in 2002.

====Premier League unification (May 2002)====
In May, 2002, Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina was unified to include both Bosnian entity football associations, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina Football Association, based in Sarajevo, and Republika Srpska Football Association, based in Banja Luka. The unified Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina that includes clubs from both entities started from the 2002-03 season and is active today. Each semi-autonomous half also has a federation of its own. source

====FIFA suspends Bosnian FA====

On 1 April 2011 UEFA and FIFA announced the suspension of the Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina with immediate effect. UEFA and FIFA decided to do so because the Association didn&#x27;t follow the new UEFA statute, namely the rule under which the organization must be led by a single president. They had three, one for each one of the constituent national ethnicities: Bosniaks, Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats, as was the case with the Dayton Agreement. The suspension was lifted on 30 May 2011 after the new statute was unanimously approved by all three ethnic groups. 

In the past years, some Bosnian players were very vocal about their opposition to then-leaders in the Bosnian FA, who were elected or appointed because of ethnic affiliation rather than professional qualifications. Fans often either boycotted the games or displayed anti-FA banners at the games they did attend. 13 Bosnian national team players (Misimović, Berberović, Grujić, Bartolović, Hrgović, Bajramović, Papac, Spahić, Milenković, Grlić, Bešlija, Hasagić, and Tolja) released a statement published in &quot;Dnevni Avaz&quot; daily, announcing they would boycott all national team matches until four FA officials – Milan Jelić, Iljo Dominković, Sulejman Čolaković, and Ahmet Pašalić – resigned. &quot;We will no longer accept call-ups to the national team while these people are performing these functions, hoping that our gesture will mark the first step in the healing of this cancer in our soccer and a new beginning for the national team for which our hearts beat.&quot; in the letter it was quoted. A new team had to be assembled to continue qualifications for Euro 2008. Former forwards Sergej Barbarez and Elvir Bolić were the most vocal against the corruption in the Bosnian FA appearing on numerous TV shows expressing their deep frustration about the situation in the Bosnian football over the years.

====FIFA imposes normalisation committee (April 2011 – December 2012)====
From 1 April 2011 to December 2012, NSBiH was run by a FIFA-imposed normalisation committee headed by football great Ivica Osim, which helped lift the FIFA imposed suspension of Bosnian football.

Other members of the Normalisation Committee include former football players and managers: Faruk Hadžibegić, Dušan Bajević, Sergej Barbarez and Jasmin Baković. According to many football enthusiasts, this was a welcome change for the football in the country. One of those dismissed from their positions was a former NSBiH secretary general Munib Ušanović, who was successfully prosecuted over tax evasion and illegal misappropriation of the NFSBiH funds. Together with Miodrag Kureš, Munib Ušanović has been sentenced to five years in jail over tax fraud.

====Elvedin Begić elected first single president (December 2012)====
On 13 December 2012, members of Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina voted in Elvedin Begić as the new first single president of the BiH football organization for the next four years. Begić was serving as vice president of the Normalisation Committee prior to this position.

====UEFA President opens sport centre in Zenica (September 2013)====
On 2 September 2013, UEFA President Michel Platini opened the Bosnia and Herzegovina Football Association new state of the art training centre, built with UEFA, FIFA and city of Zenica funding. Alongside of Michel Platini and Bosnian FA president Elvedin Begić, other special guests from the region included president of the Croatian Football Federation Davor Šuker, and Football Association of Serbia general secretary Zoran Laković. Also joining them were Ivica Osim, Jasmin Baković, Rodoljub Petković and at the time Bosnia-Herzegovina team coaches Safet Sušić and Borče Sredojević, as well as past team captain Emir Spahić, Senad Lulić, as well as Vlado Jagodić (coach of U21 Bosnia side at the time), former Bosnia players Muhamed Konjić, Elvir Bolić, Vedin Musić, and many others.

====Football academy in Mostar (January 2015)====
On 20 January 2015, Project dubbed &quot;Projekat obnove sportskog centra u Mostaru za pomirenje u zajednici kroz promociju sporta&quot; was announced meaning SKC Kantarevac in Mostar will be built and serve as the city&#x27;s new football academy sponsored by Japanese embassy and Tsuneyasu Miyamoto and supported locally by Ivica Osim, former Japan national football team manager.

====Vico Zeljković elected president (March 2021)====
On 16 March 2021, Vico Zeljković, president of the Football Association of Republika Srpska, was elected president of the Bosnia and Herzegovina FA.

<text>Lee Arenberg (born July 18, 1962) is an American actor. He is best known for his role as Pintel, one of Captain Barbossa&#x27;s crew, in the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; franchise. He also had a recurring role as the dwarf Grumpy in the television series &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;.
He attended UCLA as a theatre major.

==Career==
Arenberg attended Santa Monica High School with future &quot;brat pack&quot; actors Sean Penn, Robert Downey Jr. and Emilio Estevez, and co-wrote a play with Estevez which was directed by Penn. Lee&#x27;s first professional job was in 1986 at the Mark Taper Forum in &quot;Ghetto&quot;, a play directed by Gordon Davidson. Within weeks he was cast in three films, including the role of Norton in the feature &quot;Tapeheads&quot; (1988) opposite the film&#x27;s co-stars Tim Robbins and John Cusack. Guest appearances on television began in 1987 with the hit sitcom &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; (1986), and have continued with memorable roles such as the parking space-stealing New Yorker Mike Moffitt on &quot;Seinfeld&quot; (1992) and as the murderous rock promoter opposite Katey Sagal and Sam Kinison in &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; (1989), as well as roles on &quot;Arli$$&quot; (1996), and &quot;Friends&quot; (1994). Arenberg can also be seen in the role of the well endowed studio head Bobby G. on the controversial short-lived Fox sitcom &quot;Action&quot; (1999) opposite series star Jay Mohr.

Arenberg has also guest starred on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, and &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;. Coincidentally, in two of his appearances, (&quot;The Nagus&quot; and &quot;United&quot;), he played a character named Gral, one a Ferengi and the other a Tellarite. In 1992, Lee appeared on the TV series &quot;Night Court&quot;. Arenberg also played the recurring role of bookie Mike Moffitt in two episodes of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. In &quot;The Parking Space&quot;, he and George Costanza had a parking dispute, while in &quot;The Susie&quot; his thumbs were accidentally broken while trying to repair Jerry Seinfeld&#x27;s car trunk.

He also guest starred in the fifth season of &quot;Friends&quot; in an episode titled &quot;The One with the Inappropriate Sister&quot;. He guest starred on an episode of &quot;Brotherly Love&quot; entitled &quot;Motherly Love&quot;. He had a bit part as a bumbling Hold-up Man in &quot;RoboCop 3&quot;. Lee also played Dr. Moyer in the &quot;Scrubs&quot; episode &quot;My Own American Girl&quot;. He also starred as the dwarf Elwood Gutworthy in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (2000), and the pirate Pintel in the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; trilogy. He guest starred as &quot;Hair Plugs&quot; in &quot;Grounded for Life&quot; (2001).
A graduate of Santa Monica High in 1980, he starred as the regular character &quot;Grumpy/Leroy&quot; on the hit ABC television series &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;. As he confirmed when speaking at the Farpoint Star Trek Convention in Timonium, Maryland, Arenberg&#x27;s character Pintel did not return in the fourth &quot;Pirates&quot; film.

Arenberg&#x27;s face as skeletal Pintel from &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;, can be seen popping up in the treasure caves on &quot;Pirate&#x27;s Lair on Tom Sawyer Island&quot; in &quot;Disneyland&quot;.

<doc id="690675" wikidata="Q903860" url="?curid=690675" title="Koševo City Stadium">
<text>Koševo Stadium (Bosnian:&quot; Stadion Koševo&quot;), also Koševo Olympic Stadium or Stadium Asim Ferhatović - Hase (&quot;Stadion Asim Ferhatović Hase&quot;) is a multi-purpose stadium located in the Koševo neighborhood of Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Its official name is Olimpijski stadion Koševo – Asim Ferhatović-Hase.

The stadium was opened by the city, and leased on longterm basis by football club FK Sarajevo. The club proposed the new name for its sporting and football events, in honor to its former footballer and club&#x27;s legend, Asim Ferhatović. It hosted the opening ceremony of the 1984 Winter Olympics.

==Construction==
The stadium was opened in the year 1947. In 1984, it was reconstructed for the 1984 Winter Olympics, and is therefore often called &quot;Olympic Stadium&quot;. In July 2004, FK Sarajevo proposed the new name for sporting and football events, in honor to its former player and club&#x27;s legend from the 1960s, Asim Ferhatović - Hase.

Today, the total capacity of Koševo is 34,500 seats, and up to 70,000 for musical and various public events, such as U2&#x27;s concert as part of their PopMart Tour in 1997 and Dino Merlin&#x27;s Burek tour in 2004 and Hotel Nacional in 2015, or hosting of papal pastoral visitations by Pope John Paul II between 12–13 April 1997 and Pope Francis on 6 June 2015. It was also the home stadium of the Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team.

==History==
Construction works started in 1947. The stadium was literally buried into a local hill thus merging with its natural surroundings. In 1950, a pitch and a tartan track were also added. The first international football match, between Yugoslavia and Turkey, was played in 1954.

In 1966, the stadium hosted an athletic championship for the Balkans. It was renovated for that occasion. A new administration building was built, so were the new locker rooms and a restaurant. A modern scoreboard and new lighting were also provided.

The stadium was renovated for the third time after the Bosnian War, in 1998. By adding the chairs on every stand the seating capacity of the stadium was reduced to 34,500.

Throughout its football history, the stadium was usually a home ground for FK Sarajevo&#x27;s and FK Željezničar&#x27;s international matches. The Sarajevo audience witnessed many great matches against Europe&#x27;s finest clubs such as Manchester United, Dynamo Kyiv, Derby County, Basel, Hamburger SV, Newcastle United, Celtic etc.

The stadium&#x27;s largest attendance was recorded in a 1981–82 Yugoslav First League match between Sarajevo and Željezničar. Allegedly, up to 60,000 people attended the game, though the exact number was never officially published.

In April 2021, the stadium was leased to FK Sarajevo for operating the stadium for the next 30 to 45 years, making the stadium FK Sarajevo&#x27;s de facto property.

===1984 Winter Olympics===
On 7 February 1984, the Koševo stadium hosted the opening ceremonies of the 1984 Winter Olympics for which it was thoroughly renovated and expanded. About 50,000 people attended the ceremonies. The west stand held 18,500 seating places at that time.

<text>The Seattle Art Museum (commonly known as SAM) is an art museum located in Seattle, Washington, United States. The museum operates three major facilities: its main museum in downtown Seattle; the Seattle Asian Art Museum in Volunteer Park, Capitol Hill; and Olympic Sculpture Park on the central Seattle waterfront, which opened in 2007.

==History==
The SAM collection has grown from 1,926 pieces in 1933 to nearly 25,000 as of 2008. Its original museum provided an area of ; the present facilities provide plus a park. Paid staff have increased from 7 to 303, and the museum library has grown from approximately 1,400 books to 33,252.

SAM traces its origins to the Seattle Fine Arts Society (organized 1905) and the Washington Arts Association (organized 1906), which merged in 1917, keeping the Fine Arts Society name. In 1931 the group renamed itself as the Art Institute of Seattle. The Art Institute housed its collection in Henry House, the former home, on Capitol Hill, of the collector and founder of the Henry Art Gallery, Horace C. Henry (1844–1928).

Richard E. Fuller, president of the Seattle Fine Arts Society, was the animating figure of SAM in its early years. During the Great Depression, he and his mother, Margaret MacTavish Fuller, donated $250,000 to build an art museum in Volunteer Park on Seattle&#x27;s Capitol Hill. The city provided the land and received ownership of the building. Carl F. Gould of the architectural firm Bebb and Gould designed an Art Deco/Art Moderne building for the museum, which opened June 23, 1933. The Art Institute collection formed the core of the original SAM collection; the Fullers soon donated additional pieces. The Art Institute was responsible for managing art activities when the museum first opened. Fuller served as museum director into the 1970s, never taking a salary.

SAM joined with the National Council on the Arts (later NEA), Richard Fuller, and the Seattle Foundation (in part, another Fuller family endeavor) to acquire and install Isamu Noguchi&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Black Sun&quot; in front of the museum in Volunteer Park. It was the NEA&#x27;s first commission in Seattle.

In 1983 to 1984, the museum received a donation of half of a downtown city block, the former J. C. Penney department store on the west side of Second Avenue between Union and Pike Streets. They eventually decided that this particular block was not a suitable site: that land was sold for private development as the Newmark Building, and the museum acquired land in the next block south. On December 5, 1991, SAM reopened in a $62 million downtown facility designed by Robert Venturi. The next year, one of Jonathan Borofsky&#x27;s &quot;Hammering Man&quot; sculptures was installed outside the museum as part of Seattle City Light&#x27;s One Percent for Art program. &quot;Hammering Man&quot; would have been installed in time for the museum&#x27;s opening, but on September 28, 1991, as workers attempted to erect the piece, it fell, was damaged, and had to be returned to the foundry for repairs. &quot;Hammering Man&quot; was used in a guerrilla art installation on Labor Day in 1993 when Jason Sprinkle and other local artists attached a ball and chain to the leg of the sculpture. In 1994, the Volunteer Park facility reopened as the Seattle Asian Art Museum. In 2007, the Olympic Sculpture Park opened to the public, culminating an eight-year process. In 2017, the Seattle Asian Art Museum closed for a two-year $54 million renovation and expansion project. The museum reopened February 8, 2020.

In September 2021, employees of Seattle Art Museum called for a boycott of the museum for policies they claim unfairly target unhoused people. Soon after, in October 2021, SAM Director and CEO, Amada Cruz, signed onto a letter on behalf of the museum in support of increasing the city&#x27;s police budget. The letter also advocated for subsidized security for nonprofit institutions, despite the recent termination of SAM&#x27;s contract with Star Protection Services due to employee misconduct and the continued opposition of staff and community members.

On January 7, 2022, the visitor service officers filed to unionize in partnership with IUPAT 116. In May 2022, security employees voted to form an independent union, the SAM Visitors Service Officers (VSO) Union. The National Labor Relations Board certified the SAM VSO Union as the security officers&#x27; representative on June 8, 2022. Since then, the museum has recognized and bargained with the SAM VSO Union as the security officers’ collective bargaining representative, and is negotiating with the VSO for the first contract to cover the security officers.

==Exhibitions==
Among the museum&#x27;s notable exhibitions were a 1954 exhibition of 25 European paintings and sculptures from the Samuel H. Kress Foundation; these pieces were donated to SAM in 1961. A 1959 Van Gogh exhibit drew 126,100 visitors. That same year, SAM organized a retrospective of the work of Northwest School painter Mark Tobey that traveled to four other U.S. museums. Tobey&#x27;s works and highlights of SAM&#x27;s Asian collection were featured under the museum&#x27;s aegis at the Century 21 Exposition (the 1962 Seattle World&#x27;s Fair). A Jacob Lawrence retrospective in 1974 honored a giant of African American art who had settled in Seattle four years earlier. &quot;Leonardo Lives&quot; (1997) featured the Codex Leicester, the last manuscript of Leonardo da Vinci in private hands, which had then been recently purchased by Bill Gates.

==Collection==
As of January 2023, the museum&#x27;s collection includes about 25,000 pieces. Among them are Alexander Calder&#x27;s &quot;Eagle&quot; (1971) and Richard Serra&#x27;s &quot;Wake&quot; (2004), both at the Olympic Sculpture Park; Cai Guo-Qiang&#x27;s &quot;Inopportune: Stage One&quot; (2004), a sculpture constructed from cars and sequenced multi-channel light tubes on display in the lobby of the SAM Downtown; &quot;The Judgment of Paris&quot; (c. 1516–18) by Lucas Cranach the Elder; Mark Tobey&#x27;s &quot;Electric Night&quot; (1944); &quot;Yéil X&#x27;eenh (Raven Screen)&quot; (c. 1810), attributed to the Tlingit artist Kadyisdu.axch&#x27;; Do-Ho Suh&#x27;s &quot;Some/One&quot; (2001); a Supermatist composition (1924) by Anna Kogan; and a coffin in the shape of a Mercedes-Benz (1991) by Kane Quaye.

===Return of looted art===
The museum returned to the heirs of 1930s French-Jewish impressionist and post-impressionist art dealer Paul Rosenberg a painting by Henri Matisse which had been looted by Nazis in World War II, after having requested that the family sue in order to reach a legal settlement that included another art dealer. So in October 1997, Rosenberg&#x27;s family filed suit in District Court, to recover the painting &quot;Odalisque&quot; (1927 or 1928). It was the first lawsuit against an American museum concerning ownership of Nazi plunder during World War II. Then museum director Mimi Gardner Gates brokered an 11th hour settlement that returned the artwork, after which the museum sued the gallery which had sold it the painting in the 1950s. Author Héctor Feliciano said it was only the second instance in the US of a museum returning looted art.

==Libraries==
The Seattle Art Museum contains the Dorothy Stimson Bullitt Library and the McCaw Foundation Library for Asian Art.

===Dorothy Stimson Bullitt Library===
The Dorothy Stimson Bullitt Library was founded in 1991. As of 2011 it contained 20,000 books and subscribed to 100 periodicals. It specializes in African art, contemporary art, decorative ars, European art, Modern art, and photography.

===McCaw Foundation Library for Asian Art===
The McCaw Foundation Library for Asian Art was founded in 1933. As of 2011 it contained 15,000 book volumes and subscribed to 100 periodicals. It specializes in Asian art.

==Facilities==
===Main facility===

The museum&#x27;s main collection moved to its present location on First Avenue in December 1991; the museum&#x27;s original building became the Seattle Asian Art Museum in 1994. The building, a limestone-covered rectangle with a streak of tile and terra cotta around its outside, is located at University Street and First Avenue, and was completed by Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates at with a $28.1 million budget.

In 2006, the Seattle Art Museum began expanding its 1991 location in a joint effort with Washington Mutual (WaMu); the enlarged building was originally known as the WaMu Center. The expansion actually began in July 2004. Several pieces had to be temporarily moved to prevent them from being damaged due to vibrations during construction. This would have been the initial foundation phase of the WaMu Center. In addition to reworking the Venturi building, SAM now takes up the first four floors of a 16-floor building designed by Portland, Oregon architect Brad Cloepfil. SAM also owns the next eight floors, which WaMu originally rented; Washington Mutual owned the top four floors. As SAM expands in the future, it can take over one or more of the rented floors.

Because of the construction, the museum&#x27;s downtown location was closed from January 5, 2006, to May 5, 2007. The expanded building offers 70 percent more gallery space, an expanded museum store, and a new restaurant. In anticipation of the expansion, over a thousand new pieces, with a total value over a billion dollars, were donated to the collection.

Washington Mutual&#x27;s 2008 failure and subsequent acquisition by JPMorgan Chase resulted in Northwestern Mutual purchasing WaMu&#x27;s share of the building September 9, 2009, and renaming it the Russell Investments Center. Currently, Russell Investments, a Northwestern Mutual subsidiary, is headquartered there, having relocated from Tacoma, Washington.

Admission to the SAM&#x27;s indoor facilities is free on the first Thursday of each month; SAM also offers free admission the first Saturday of the month. And even the normal admission is suggested, meaning that the museum would like visitors to pay the complete admission but if they can not pay fully they can still enjoy the museum.

===Modern Art Pavilion===
After the Century 21 Exposition, the fairgrounds became Seattle Center, and the UK Pavilion became the Modern Art Pavilion of the museum. It remained in use until 1987.

===Asian Art Museum===
The Asian Art Museum has been located since 1994 in the original 1933 Deco/Moderne SAM facility in Volunteer Park on Seattle&#x27;s Capitol Hill.

===Olympic Sculpture Park===
The Olympic Sculpture Park is a free and open public park on the Seattle waterfront just north of downtown. It opened on January 20, 2007.

==Management==

===Governance===
Amada Cruz was named director and CEO of the Seattle Art Museum in 2019. She succeeded Kimberly Rorschach who served as director from 2012 to 2019.

===Funding===
The Seattle Art Museum only receives 4% of its funding from the government; the rest of its operating costs are covered by ticket fees and its membership base. As of 2014, the museum has a $23 million budget. As a result of the banking crisis, the museum in 2009 lost $5.8 million in annual rental and related income from its tenant Washington Mutual. It faced an accumulated debt of $56 million dating back from when the museum and Washington Mutual partnered on a new downtown building they intended to share. After the bank was sold to JPMorgan Chase in 2008, it left the museum with eight floors of office space, at a cost of about $5.8 million a year. Help came in the form of grants from the JPMorgan Chase and the Gates Foundation. The museum&#x27;s endowment for art purchases is currently at less than $7.8 million. In 2016, the Seattle Art Museum was the Seattle Art Fair&#x27;s Beneficiary Partner where it received $100,000 from the Opening Night Preview.

===Attendance===
While the number of visitors has grown, the pattern is more complicated: 346,287 people visited the museum in its first year; in 1978 the traveling exhibit &quot;Treasures of Tutankhamun&quot; (shown in the facility at Seattle Center) drew 1.3 million visitors in four months; 2007 attendance was 797,127. In 2010, the exhibition &quot;Picasso: Masterpieces from the Musée National Picasso, Paris&quot; drew more than 405,000 and was the museum&#x27;s most-attended exhibition since it moved to its downtown location from Volunteer Park in 1991. In SAM&#x27;s history, only the 1978 King Tut exhibition, held at Seattle Center, ranked higher in attendance.
