<text>Super Bowl XXXIX was an American football game played between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion New England Patriots and the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Philadelphia Eagles to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2004 season. The Patriots defeated the Eagles by the score of 24–21. The game was played on February 6, 2005, at Alltel Stadium (now EverBank Stadium) in Jacksonville, Florida, currently the only Super Bowl hosted in the city.

The Patriots, who entered the Super Bowl after compiling a 14–2 regular season record, became the then-most recent team to win consecutive Super Bowls (until the Kansas City Chiefs did in 2023). New England also became the second team after the Dallas Cowboys to win three Super Bowls in four seasons, cementing their status as the NFL dynasty of the 2000s. The Eagles were making their second-ever Super Bowl appearance after posting a 13–3 regular season record.

The game was close throughout, with the teams battling to a 14–14 tie by the end of the third quarter. The Patriots then scored 10 points in the 4th quarter with Corey Dillon&#x27;s 2-yard touchdown run and Adam Vinatieri&#x27;s 22-yard field goal. The Eagles then cut their deficit to 24–21, with quarterback Donovan McNabb&#x27;s 30-yard touchdown pass to receiver Greg Lewis, with 1:48 remaining in the game but could not sustain the comeback. Overall, New England forced four turnovers, while Patriots wide receiver Deion Branch was named Super Bowl MVP for recording 133 receiving yards and tied the Super Bowl record with 11 catches.

To avoid the possibility of an incident similar to the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show the previous year, the league selected Paul McCartney as a &quot;safe&quot; choice to perform during Super Bowl XXXIX&#x27;s halftime. The broadcast of the game on Fox was watched by an estimated 86 million viewers.

==Background==
===Host selection process===
NFL owners voted to award Super Bowl XXXIX to Jacksonville during their November 1, 2000, meeting held in Atlanta. It marked the first and to-date, only Super Bowl held in Jacksonville, and the third metropolitan area in the state of Florida to host a Super Bowl, after Miami and Tampa. Three cities submitted bids: Jacksonville (Alltel Stadium), Miami (Pro Player Stadium), and Oakland (Oakland Coliseum). Three Super Bowls host sites were selected during the meeting, XXXVIII, XXXIX, and XL. However, XXXIX was the only one of the three that involved a competitive voting process. The city of Jacksonville was awarded the 30th NFL franchise in November 1993. The expansion Jacksonville Jaguars began play in 1995, and would play their home games in Jacksonville Municipal Stadium. The facility was essentially a brand new stadium, built on the former site of the Gator Bowl. Almost all of the former Gator Bowl was demolished, except for the west upper deck, and ramping. Jacksonville had bid for the Super Bowl several times prior, specifically for XX, XXI, XXII, XXIII, XXIV, but they were rejected for various reasons including the aging condition of the Gator Bowl, and not having an NFL franchise at the time.

In May 1999, Jacksonville submitted their initial bid for XXXIX. Miami, Atlanta, and Oakland also submitted proposals. Atlanta, however, dropped out before the final bids were due on September 8. Rumors of bids by New Orleans and Kansas City never materialized. Oakland&#x27;s bid in particular, was considered a long shot, and it did not even have the support of Raiders owner Al Davis. Miami was thought be the favorite to land the game, based on its experience having hosted the Super Bowl eight previous times. Jacksonville was an underdog, but garnered interest and attention as they represented a new market for the game. While the stadium had the capacity to host the game, area attractions were plentiful, and weather was acceptable, the greater Jacksonville area lacked the necessary number of premium-level hotel rooms needed to satisfy the NFL&#x27;s requirements. The host committee&#x27;s solution, though controversial, was to dock several cruise ships on the St. Johns River near downtown to serve as temporary hotels. The plan was expensive, and would require roughly 800 buses to shuttle attendees back-and-forth to the various events and activities throughout the week.

A city would win the vote if they received of the ballots during any of the first three rounds. If no city won during the first three rounds, the fourth round would revert to a simple majority. Only 31 of the 32 team owners took part; expansion Houston did not vote. Oakland was eliminated on the second ballot. Jacksonville won on the fourth ballot. Houston was awarded XXXVIII, and Detroit was awarded XL. Officials from the Miami contingent, which included Don Shula and Dan Marino, expressed displeasure over the results. Dolphins president Eddie Jones said &quot;[Jacksonville] will do a good job, but it&#x27;s not the best place.&quot; Miami would ultimately land the next available game (XLI).

===New England Patriots===
New England finished the regular season with a record of 14–2, bested only by the Pittsburgh Steelers&#x27; 15–1 mark, and ranking seventh in yards gained (5,773) and fourth in points scored (437).

The Patriots&#x27; major acquisition prior to the season was veteran running back Corey Dillon, who joined the team after playing seven seasons with the Cincinnati Bengals. acquired in exchange for a second-round draft pick. Dillon became a significant offensive weapon for the 2004 Patriots, recording a franchise record 1,635 rushing yards and 12 touchdowns, and was named to the Pro Bowl for the fourth time in his career.

Another weapon in the Patriots&#x27; offensive backfield was running back Kevin Faulk, who rushed for 255 yards, had 248 receiving yards, and scored three total touchdowns. Fullback Patrick Pass also emerged as a big contributor, rushing for 141 yards and catching 28 passes for 215 yards.

Pro Bowl quarterback Tom Brady remained at the helm of the Patriots offense, with 3,692 passing yards, 28 touchdowns, and 14 interceptions. Although wide receiver Deion Branch, New England&#x27;s major deep threat, missed most of the season because of injuries, he recorded 454 yards and four touchdowns. Wide receiver David Givens was the team&#x27;s leading receiver with 874 receiving yards and three touchdowns. Wide receiver David Patten also contributed 800 receiving yards and seven touchdowns, and tight end Daniel Graham had 364 receiving yards and seven touchdowns. On special teams, pro bowl kicker Adam Vinatieri had the best season of his career, leading the NFL in field goals made (31), field goal percentage (93.9) and scoring (141 points)

On defense, the Patriots were plagued by injuries, especially in their secondary. Cornerbacks Tyrone Poole and Ty Law suffered season ending injuries, while safety Eugene Wilson, who led the team with four interceptions, missed several games. With their patchwork secondary, the Patriots ranked 17th in passing yards allowed (3,400), However, they did rank seventh in interceptions (20) and 10th in fewest passing touchdowns allowed (18). Most importantly, New England continued to win despite the injuries. Converted wide receiver Troy Brown turned out to be very effective playing as a defensive back, ranking second on the team with three interceptions. Safety Rodney Harrison was also an impact player, leading the team with 138 tackles while also recording three sacks and two interceptions.

Up front, the Patriots&#x27; defensive line was anchored by Pro Bowler Richard Seymour, who recorded five sacks. New England also still had their trio of impact veteran linebackers: Pro Bowler Tedy Bruschi (122 tackles, three and a half sacks, three interceptions), Willie McGinest (nine and a half sacks, one interception), and Mike Vrabel (71 tackles and five and a half sacks), along with Ted Johnson. Vrabel also frequently played at the tight end position during offensive plays near the opponent&#x27;s goal line, recording two touchdown receptions.

===Philadelphia Eagles===
The Eagles earned the NFC Super Bowl berth after three consecutive defeats in the NFC Championship Game. The Eagles hired Andy Reid as their head coach in 1999 following two straight losing seasons. That same year, they used their first-round pick in the NFL draft (the second overall) to select quarterback Donovan McNabb. Prior to the 2004 season, the Eagles traded for wide receiver Terrell Owens to be the impact player to help get them to the Super Bowl.

Owens joined the team after eight seasons with the San Francisco 49ers. Owens became the Eagles&#x27; deep-ball threat, finishing the season with 1,200 receiving yards and 14 touchdowns. McNabb had the best season of his career in 2004, passing for 3,875 yards, 31 touchdowns, and eight interceptions, making him the first quarterback to ever throw for more than 30 touchdowns and fewer than 10 interceptions in a season. He also rushed for 220 yards and 3 touchdowns. Wide receiver Todd Pinkston was also a reliable target, recording 36 catches for 676 yards.

Philadelphia&#x27;s running game was not as strong as their passing attack, ranking 24th in the league in rushing yards (1,639). Running back Brian Westbrook led the team with 812 rushing yards and three touchdowns, however he also led all NFL running backs in receiving with 706 receiving yards and six touchdowns. Veteran running back Dorsey Levens added 410 rushing yards. The Eagles&#x27; offensive line was led by Pro Bowl tackles Tra Thomas and Jon Runyan and center Hank Fraley.

Three of their four starters in the defensive secondary were named to the Pro Bowl: Cornerback Lito Sheppard (one sack, five interceptions, and two touchdowns), safety Michael Lewis (88 tackles, one sack, and one interception) and safety Brian Dawkins (three sacks and 4 interceptions), while their fourth starter, cornerback Sheldon Brown, also enjoyed a solid year (89 tackles, three sacks, two interceptions). Their defensive line was anchored by Pro Bowl defensive tackle Corey Simon (five and a half sacks) and defensive ends Jevon Kearse (seven and a half sacks) and Derrick Burgess. Pro Bowl middle linebacker Jeremiah Trotter, who only started nine games, recorded 69 tackles and a sack.

The Eagles started the 2004 regular season with seven straight wins before suffering a loss to the 15-1 Steelers. After that, they finished the season with a 13–3 record. Their only other two losses were in their final two games of the season, when they decided to rest all of their starters because they had already clinched the NFC #1 seed. However, during a December 19 win over the Dallas Cowboys, Owens was seriously injured on a &quot;horse-collar tackle&quot; by Cowboys defensive back Roy Williams and missed the rest of the regular season and the playoffs.

===Playoffs===
Despite the loss of Owens, the Eagles beat the Minnesota Vikings, 27–14, and the Atlanta Falcons, 27–10, in the playoffs with relative ease. McNabb recorded 21 out of 33 completions for 286 yards and two touchdowns, while receiver Freddie Mitchell scored two touchdowns in the victory over the Vikings. Although Minnesota quarterback Daunte Culpepper threw for 316 yards, the Eagles defense recorded two interceptions and two sacks. McNabb then completed 17 out of 26 passes for 180 yards and two touchdowns in the win over the Falcons.The Eagles defense held dual-threat quarterback Michael Vick to only 136 passing yards, 26 rushing yards, and no touchdowns, while also recording an interception and four sacks. McNabb had an average passer rating of 111.3 in the two games, with 466 passing yards, 35 rushing yards, four touchdowns, and no turnovers. Safety Brian Dawkins was also an important player, recording a sack and a forced fumble against the Vikings, followed by an interception and a forced fumble against the Falcons in the NFC Championship Game.

Meanwhile, the Patriots defeated the Indianapolis Colts, 20–3, holding the league&#x27;s highest scoring team with 522 total points to just one field goal. Colts quarterback Peyton Manning was limited to 238 passing yards with an interception and no touchdowns. The Patriots also held possession of the ball for 37:43, including 21:26 in the second half, and recorded three long scoring drives that each took over seven minutes off the clock. One reason New England was able to hold the ball so long was because of Dillon&#x27;s rushing. He finished the game with 23 carries for 144 yards and 5 receptions for 17 yards.

The Patriots then defeated the first seeded Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Championship Game, 41–27. Although Pittsburgh finished the season with the best record in the NFL at 15–1 and had beaten New England during the regular season and led the league in fewest total yards allowed, they could not stop the Patriots. Brady threw for 207 yards and two touchdowns; Dillon rushed for 73 yards and a touchdown; and Branch, who was coming off of his injuries, recorded 4 receptions for 116 yards and a touchdown, along with 37 rushing yards and another touchdown on 2 carries. Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger was intercepted three times, including an 87-yard interception returned for a touchdown by Rodney Harrison, and running back Jerome Bettis, Pittsburgh&#x27;s leading rusher, was held to just 64 yards.

===Super Bowl pregame news===
Owens was cleared to play in Super Bowl XXXIX, defying doctors&#x27; orders by playing on his injured ankle containing two screws and a metal plate.

The other major story was the Patriots&#x27; potential loss of both their offensive coordinator and defensive coordinator at the end of the season, and how it might affect the team in 2005. On December 12, 2004, about a month and a half before the game, New England offensive coordinator Charlie Weis signed a contract to become the head coach of Notre Dame starting in the 2005 season. Rumors were also circulating that defensive coordinator Romeo Crennel would also leave the team to become the head coach of the Cleveland Browns (which ended up being true as Crennel and the Browns agreed to a contract a couple of weeks after the Super Bowl).

Due to injuries at the tight end spot, the Eagles were forced to sign Jeff Thomason, a former tight end who was working construction at the time, to a one-game contract for the Super Bowl. Thomason saw time during several plays, although never had a ball thrown his way. This was his third Super Bowl, playing in two with the Green Bay Packers during Andy Reid&#x27;s days as a Packer assistant.

With this appearance the Patriots became the eighth team to play in five Super Bowls They joined the Dallas Cowboys, Denver Broncos, Pittsburgh Steelers, San Francisco 49ers, Miami Dolphins, Washington Redskins, and Oakland/Los Angeles Raiders. They would later be joined by the Green Bay Packers in 2011 the New York Giants in 2012 and the Kansas City Chiefs in 2023

The Eagles were trying to win their first NFL title since 1960 and the first championship for the city of Philadelphia since Moses Malone&#x27;s &quot;fo&#x27;, fi&#x27;, fo&#x27;&quot; during the 76ers run to the NBA Championship. With President George W. Bush being inaugurated for a second time in January, the Eagles were also trying to end a losing streak—teams in the city of Philadelphia had lost six straight championships during presidential inauguration years, beginning with the 76ers loss in . The streak included the Eagles in Super Bowl XV in 1981. 1989 was not included in that streak, but 1977, 1981, 1985 (Flyers), 1993 (Phillies), 1997 (Flyers), and 2001 (76ers) were.

As the designated home team in the annual rotation between AFC and NFC teams, the Eagles elected to wear their home midnight green uniforms with white pants, while the Patriots wore their away white uniforms with navy pants.

==Broadcasting==
The game was televised in the United States by Fox, with play-by-play announcer Joe Buck and color commentators Troy Aikman and Cris Collinsworth. At age 35, Buck was the youngest announcer to call the play-by-play of a Super Bowl telecast. This also marked the first time since Super Bowl I that none of the network commentators had ever called a Super Bowl game before (although Collinsworth had worked three prior Super Bowl telecasts as a pregame analyst). This was the last game that Collinsworth broadcast as a member of Fox, as he chose to return to NBC in the following off-season.

Pam Oliver (Patriots sideline) and Chris Myers (Eagles sideline) served as sideline reporters. James Brown hosted all the events with help from his fellow &quot;Fox NFL Sunday&quot; cast members Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long, and Jimmy Johnson. Jillian Barberie served as weather and entertainment reporter. This was the final Super Bowl that Brown hosted for Fox, as he would return to CBS following the 2005 season.

For its Super Bowl lead-out program, Fox aired a special episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (&quot;Homer and Ned&#x27;s Hail Mary Pass&quot;) and the series premiere of &quot;American Dad!&quot; (&quot;Pilot&quot;). Local stations WTXF in Philadelphia and WFXT in Boston instead immediately aired their own local postgame shows/newscasts, delayed Fox&#x27;s programming in those markets by an hour.

Westwood One broadcast the game on radio, with Marv Albert calling the play-by-play, Boomer Esiason providing color commentary, and John Dockery and Bonnie Bernstein reporting from the sidelines. Jim Gray hosted the broadcast along with Dave Sims.

==Entertainment==
===Pregame ceremonies===
Before the game, performances came from the Black Eyed Peas, Earth Wind &amp; Fire, Charlie Daniels, John Fogerty, Kelly Clarkson, and Gretchen Wilson. Shortly before kickoff, Will Smith introduced Alicia Keys who sang &quot;America the Beautiful,&quot; paying tribute to Ray Charles, who died in June 2004. The combined choirs of the U.S. Military Academy, the U.S. Naval Academy, the U.S. Air Force Academy, and the U.S. Coast Guard Academy (including members of The Idlers) sang the national anthem accompanied by the U.S. Army Herald Trumpets. This was the first time in more than 30 years that all four service academies sang together—the last time was at the second inauguration of President Richard Nixon in 1973 and the only time since 1985 that the national anthem was not sung by a notable recording artist.

The traditional military missing man formation flyby was this year performed by a pair of F/A-18 Super Hornets from VFA-106 at NAS Oceana and a pair of the Air Force&#x27;s newest fighters, the F-22 Raptor, flying from Tyndall AFB, the training base for the Raptor. The earlier military flyby during the veterans&#x27; salute was conducted by 2 T-6 Texan trainers and a B-25 Mitchell bomber.

The coin toss ceremony featured youth football players from Jacksonville: Tyler Callahan, Tyler Deal, Lawrence McCauley, and Jacob Santana; and New Orleans NFL Junior Player Development coach Tomaris Jackson. They were billed as the first non-celebrities to participate in the coin toss.

For the third straight year, each team took the field &quot;en masse,&quot; following a tradition the Patriots had started in Super Bowl XXXVI. In prerecorded video segments, Andover, Massachusetts native Michael Chiklis introduced the Patriots, and Philadelphia-born Will Smith introduced the Eagles.

===Halftime show===

Paul McCartney performed during the halftime show; his selection by the NFL, the show&#x27;s producers, Don Mischer Productions, and the show&#x27;s sponsor, Ameriquest Mortgage, was considered to be a &quot;safe&quot; choice, as it avoided the possibility for an incident similar to that which sparked the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy the previous year. McCartney&#x27;s set consisted of these songs:
*&quot;Drive My Car&quot; from his career with the Beatles.
*&quot;Get Back&quot; from his career with the Beatles.
*&quot;Live and Let Die&quot; from his career with Wings.
*&quot;Hey Jude&quot; from his career with the Beatles.

===Theme===
Taking the concept a step further, for the first time, a theme was tied to the event: Building Bridges, as symbolized by the theme logo, represented by the Main Street Bridge, one of the seven bridges that crosses over the St. Johns River in the host city, and according to the League, symbolized the bridging of a nation under the NFL football umbrella. The theme was also used by Jacksonville-area nonprofit Fresh Ministries in a major event entitled &quot;Bridges of Peace,&quot; featuring city officials asking the people to unite for the Super Bowl and heal the wounds of segregation.

===Presidential appearances===
Former Presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton appeared in support of their bipartisan effort to raise money for relief of the December 26, 2004, tsunami in southeast Asia through the USA Freedom Corps, an action which former President Bush described as &quot;transcending politics.&quot;

==Game summary==
===First quarter===
On the first drive of the game, Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb appeared to narrowly avoid a sack by Patriots linebacker Tedy Bruschi, but fumble the ball while running into linebacker Willie McGinest, with the Patriots recovering it at the Philadelphia 34-yard line. Eagles coach Andy Reid&#x27;s instant replay challenge overruled the fumble; officials ruled that McNabb&#x27;s knee hit the ground while he was being hit by Bruschi before he lost the ball. Later in the quarter after each team had punted twice, McNabb completed a 30-yard pass to wide receiver Terrell Owens, with an unnecessary roughness penalty against linebacker Rosevelt Colvin adding 9 yards, moving the ball inside the New England 10-yard line. However, linebacker Mike Vrabel sacked McNabb for a 16-yard loss on the next play. On the following play, the Eagles once again appeared to turn the ball over; McNabb&#x27;s pass was intercepted in the end zone by cornerback Asante Samuel, who returned it to his own 30-yard line, but the play was nullified by an illegal contact penalty against linebacker Roman Phifer, moving the ball back inside the 20 and giving the Eagles a first down. However, Philadelphia turned the ball over for real on the next play when McNabb threw an interception to safety Rodney Harrison. This was McNabb&#x27;s first red zone interception of the season.

The Eagles&#x27; defense then forced the Patriots to a three-and-out on their ensuing possession, and Philadelphia got great field position by receiving Josh Miller&#x27;s punt at the New England 45-yard line. But three plays later, Harrison held up tight end L. J. Smith, enabling cornerback Randall Gay to punch the ball loose, with safety Eugene Wilson making the recovery at the 38.


===Second quarter===
The Philadelphia defense once again forced New England to punt and got the ball back at their own 19-yard line. Aided by a pair of completions from McNabb to wide receiver Todd Pinkston for 57 yards, the Eagles drove 81 yards in nine plays and scored on McNabb&#x27;s 6-yard touchdown pass to Smith, taking a 7–0 lead with 9:55 left in the half. It was the first time New England trailed during the entire postseason. On their ensuing drive, the Patriots moved the ball to the Eagles&#x27; 4-yard line, mainly on plays by running back Corey Dillon, who caught two screen passes for 29 yards and rushed for 25. But quarterback Tom Brady fumbled the ball on a fake hand-off play-action pass and Eagles defensive tackle Darwin Walker recovered it. However, Philadelphia could not take advantage of the turnover and had to punt after three plays. Dirk Johnson&#x27;s punt went just 29 yards, giving the Patriots the ball at the Philadelphia 37-yard line. The Patriots then drove 37 yards in seven plays to score on Brady&#x27;s 4-yard pass to wide receiver David Givens with 1:10 remaining in the period, tying the game 7–7 by halftime. It was only the second halftime tie in Super Bowl history (Super Bowl XXIII between the 49ers and the Bengals was the other; the score at the half was 3–3) and the first time both of the game&#x27;s first two quarters ended tied.

===Third quarter===
On the opening drive of the second half, Patriots wide receiver Deion Branch caught four passes from Brady for 71 yards on a drive that ended with Brady&#x27;s 2-yard touchdown pass to Vrabel, who lined up at the tight end spot, mirroring Brady&#x27;s touchdown pass to Vrabel in the previous Super Bowl. The score gave the Patriots their first lead of the game, 14–7. After the teams traded punts, the Eagles tied the game with 3:39 left in the third period with a 74-yard, 10-play drive that was capped by McNabb&#x27;s 10-yard touchdown pass to running back Brian Westbrook. For the first time in Super Bowl history, the game was tied going into the fourth quarter.

===Fourth quarter===
The Patriots immediately broke the tie again with a nine-play, 66-yard scoring drive that was keyed by three plays from running back Kevin Faulk, who caught two passes for 27 combined yards and rushed once for 12. Dillon capped off the drive with a 2-yard touchdown run to give New England a 21–14 lead. Then after forcing another Eagles punt, Branch made a spectacular 19-yard catch, taking the ball out of the hands of cornerback Sheldon Brown. A roughing-the-passer penalty on defensive tackle Corey Simon on the same play set up kicker Adam Vinatieri&#x27;s 22-yard field goal with 8:43 left in the game to increase the Patriots&#x27; lead to 24–14. In all three Patriots&#x27; Super Bowl wins in the decade, they held a double digit lead in the fourth quarter, but all of their victories were decided by a field goal.

The Eagles responded with a 36-yard completion from McNabb to Owens to reach the New England 36-yard line, but on the next play, McNabb fired a pass over the head of running back Dorsey Levens, where Bruschi was waiting to intercept it at his 24-yard line. At this point, there was only 7:20 to play in the game, with the Patriots still up by 10 points.

Philadelphia did force New England to punt, and got the ball back at their own 21-yard line, but with 5:40 left in the game. The Eagles then drove 79 yards in 13 plays, scoring on McNabb&#x27;s 30-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Greg Lewis (the first touchdown catch of his career) and cutting their deficit to 24–21. However, the drive consumed 3:52 of the clock, and only 1:48 remained in the game by the time Lewis scored. Because of this, many sportswriters later criticized the Eagles for not immediately going to a no-huddle offense at the start of the possession. Anecdotal reports later came out alleging that McNabb was suffering from dry-heaves, and teammates Jon Ritchie and Lito Sheppard have gone on record years later that McNabb was suffering from dry-heaves or vomiting, though no video evidence exists and the stories have not been confirmed. Center Hank Fraley said in an interview the day after the game that McNabb was &quot;almost puking&quot; due to two large hits from Bruschi and defensive end Jarvis Green on back-to-back plays.&lt;ref name=&quot;B/R vomit&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; McNabb himself denies that he was vomiting or dry-heaving during the final drive, and Brian Westbrook later claimed that McNabb was merely &quot;coughing.&quot;

The Eagles failed to recover their ensuing onside kick attempt, with Patriots tight end Christian Fauria catching the ball cleanly and sliding down to seal possession for New England. The Patriots then played it safe by running the ball three times and forcing the Eagles to use up their remaining timeouts. Miller then pinned the Eagles back at their own 4-yard line with just 46 seconds left in the game. Philadelphia then tried one last desperate drive to win or tie the game. But on first down from his own end zone, McNabb was pressured into making a rushed pass to Westbrook at the line of scrimmage. Instead of dropping the pass to stop the clock, Westbrook made the mistake of catching the ball and was immediately tackled for no gain by Phifer, keeping the clock running and forcing the Eagles to run back to the line of scrimmage for their next play with no huddle. On second down, McNabb threw an incomplete pass intended for Owens. Finally on third down, McNabb threw a pass that deflected off of the outstretched fingertips of Smith and into the arms of Harrison for an interception with nine seconds left. Brady took a knee to run out the clock, clinching the third Super Bowl title in four years for the Patriots, and in the eyes of many establishing themselves as a dynasty.

===Box score===



===Statistical overview===

McNabb completed 30 out of 51 passes for 357 yards and 3 touchdowns, but threw 3 interceptions and was sacked four times. McNabb&#x27;s 357 yards are tied with Joe Montana for the seventh most in Super Bowl history and third most of any quarterback, as Tom Brady holds both the top and number 2 spot, with 505 yards in Super Bowl LII and 468 yards in Super Bowl LI. Westbrook was the Eagles leading rusher with 44 yards, while also catching 6 passes for 70 yards and a touchdown and returning 3 punts for 19 yards. Pinkston caught 4 passes for 82 yards, while Owens was the Eagles&#x27; top receiver with 9 catches for 122 yards, however neither of them scored a touchdown.

Brady completed 23 out of 33 passes for 236 yards and 2 touchdowns. Dillon was the top rusher of the game with 75 yards and a touchdown, and had 3 catches for 31 yards. Running back Kevin Faulk contributed 38 rushing yards and 27 receiving yards.

Branch&#x27;s Super Bowl record 11 catches tied Cincinnati Bengals&#x27; Dan Ross in Super Bowl XVI and San Francisco 49ers&#x27; Jerry Rice in Super Bowl XXIII. Coincidentally, all three would later be traded to the Seattle Seahawks: Ross in 1985, Rice in 2004 and Branch in 2006. Branch&#x27;s combined 21 catches in Super Bowls XXXVIII and XXXIX are the most in back-to-back Super Bowls. Branch also became the third offensive player ever to win Super Bowl MVP honors without scoring a touchdown or throwing a touchdown pass. The other two players were Joe Namath in Super Bowl III and Fred Biletnikoff in Super Bowl XI.[5]

Branch and Terrell Owens each had 100 yards receiving, marking the third time in Super Bowl history, one player from each team had over 100 yards in a Super Bowl. Michael Irvin and Andre Reed were the first in Super Bowl XXVII, and Branch and Muhsin Muhammad the second a year earlier in Super Bowl XXXVIII. Branch also became the fourth player to have at least 100 yards receiving in back-to-back Super Bowls, joining John Stallworth, Jerry Rice and Antonio Freeman. Also, Mike Vrabel and David Givens became just the 14th and 15th players to score a touchdown in consecutive Super Bowls. Vrabel is the most surprising person on this list because he is a linebacker and he scored his on offense. They also became just the 7th and 8th players to catch a touchdown in back-to-back Super Bowls.

With the victory, Tom Brady became just the fourth quarterback to win at least three Super Bowls, along with Terry Bradshaw, Joe Montana and Troy Aikman. Brady also became the fourth quarterback to throw a touchdown pass in three different Super Bowls. Other quarterbacks to do it were Bradshaw, Montana, and John Elway, with Kurt Warner later accomplishing the feat during Super Bowl XLIII and Peyton Manning in Super Bowl XLVIII.

The Patriots joined the Dallas Cowboys as the only teams in NFL history to win three Super Bowls in a span of four years.

Eagles halfback Dorsey Levens retired immediately following this game.

==Aftermath==
The Patriots&#x27; Super Bowl win was the third championship for Boston-area sports teams in 12 months, following the Patriots winning Super Bowl XXXVIII the year before and the Red Sox winning the World Series – first in 86 years – three months earlier. This marked the first time since 1989–1990 in the San Francisco Bay Area that the same market has had 2 Super Bowl and World Series winners in 12 months.

With the Eagles’ loss, the city of Philadelphia&#x27;s sports championship drought continued (no Philadelphia-based pro sports team since the 1983 76ers won a title) until the Phillies won the 2008 World Series. The Eagles did not return to the Super Bowl until 2017, when they exacted revenge on New England in Super Bowl LII, defeating them 41–33 and winning their first championship since 1960.

As usual, the television coverage of this year&#x27;s Super Bowl was the showcase for the most expensive commercials in television—both to produce and to buy airtime (at the rate of $2.4 million US for 30 seconds).

One ad that drew the ire of many—including the NFL—was for the internet domain provider Go Daddy, which tweaked the controversial halftime of the previous year&#x27;s game with a mock censorship hearing featuring a comely woman, Nikki Cappelli (played by WWE Wrestler Candice Michelle), having a &quot;wardrobe malfunction&quot;. Fox pulled the second airing of the ad, scheduled for the two-minute warning of the fourth quarter, along with a five-second plug, and it was replaced with a promo for &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. The Scottsdale, Arizona-based World Wide Web domain registration company got a refund on the second ad.

Another popular ad was made by the NFL. It featured players who were not in the Super Bowl, headlined by Pittsburgh Steelers rookie quarterback Ben Roethlisberger being at a beach resort, depressed he did not make it in. Joe Montana comforted Roethlisberger, and soon both Montana and Roethlisberger joined many other players in different locations in an off-key yet rousing edition of &quot;Tomorrow&quot; from the musical &quot;Annie&quot;. The commercial ended with the tagline: &quot;Tomorrow, we&#x27;re all undefeated again.&quot; Roethlisberger went on to lead the Steelers to victory in Super Bowl XL the very next season.

The top ad, as chosen by the USA Today Super Bowl Ad Meter was for Anheuser-Busch&#x27;s Bud Light featuring a timid skydiver making his first jump getting enticed with a six-pack of the product. This ad was ranked second on ADBOWL. The highest ranked commercial by ADBOWL was Anheuser-Busch&#x27;s &quot;Applause.&quot;

For the first time since the campaign started in Super Bowl XXI, no &quot;I&#x27;m going to Disney World!&quot; ad aired following Super Bowl XXXIX.

==Player bonuses==
Each member of the Patriots received a payment of $68,000 for winning the game. The Eagles each received $36,500. When adjusted for inflation, the Patriots salary was actually less than the $15,000 paid to members of the Green Bay Packers for winning Super Bowl I in 1967. That amount of money in 1967 equated to approximately $85,000 in 2005.

<text>Frostastaðavatn (, Icelandic for &quot;lake of the frosty place&quot;) is a lake in Iceland. It is situated in the Highlands of Iceland, not far from the famous mountains of Landmannalaugar and the volcano Hekla.

Evidence of volcanism shows around this lake; for example in the famous mixed lava flows from the 1477 combined eruptions of the Torfajökull and Bárðarbunga volcanic systems reaching down to the shore (lava flows of rhyolitic as well as basaltic composition).

Two highland roads run along its shore, &quot;Fjallabaksleið nyrðri&quot; (F 208) and &quot;Landmannaleið&quot; (F 225).

<text>Freedom Ship is a floating city project initially proposed in the late 1990s by engineer Norman Nixon. The namesake of the project reflects the designer&#x27;s vision of a mobile ocean colony, such that it is free from the property, municipal, or federal laws of any nation states. The project would not be a conventional ship, but rather a series of linked barges.

The Freedom Ship project envisioned an integrated city long with condominium housing for 80,000 people, a hospital, school system, hotel, casino, commercial and office occupancies, duty-free shopping and other facilities, large enough to require rapid transit. The complex would have circumnavigated the globe continuously, stopping regularly at ports of call. 

==Construction==
Freedom Ship International initially estimated the net cost for construction to be US$6 billion in 1999. However, by 2002, estimates had risen to US$11 billion. A July 2008 press release explained the difficulty of obtaining reliable financial backing. In November 2013, the company announced that the project, now with an estimated price of US$10 billion, was being resurrected, though that construction had not yet begun. In 2016, the project affiliated with Kanethara Marine in India.

==Similar projects==
The basic idea had been published by Jules Verne in his novel &quot;Propeller Island&quot;. No technical details were given, but the book includes the idea of building a gigantic raft. The main aim of the project was saving taxes, as the Island would move around the world on an annual basis.

Other projects, such as the ResidenSea, have similarly attempted to create mobile communities, though they have conservatively limited themselves to the constraints of conventional shipbuilding. In regard to the economic flexibility and &quot;freedom&quot; created by such mobile settlements, these projects could be considered a realization of the avant-garde Walking City concept from 1964, by British architect Ron Herron of the group Archigram. The Freedom Ship also served as the inspiration for (and is closely resembled by) the &quot;Libertania&quot;, a mobile ship depicted in Grant Morrison&#x27;s comic book &quot;The Filth&quot;. In the 1950s, Buckminster Fuller also proposed &quot;floating cities&quot; approximately a mile wide that could accommodate up to 50,000 permanent inhabitants. Mike Wallace interviewed Buckminster Fuller on TV regarding this &quot;floating cities&quot; concept, which Fuller explained would free up land needed for agriculture and industrial uses.

<doc id="685025" wikidata="Q1344336" url="?curid=685025" title="Robert Mondavi">
<text>Robert Gerald Mondavi (June 18, 1913 – May 16, 2008) was an American winemaker. His technical and marketing strategies brought worldwide recognition for the wines of the Napa Valley in California. From an early period, Mondavi promoted labeling wines varietally rather than generically, which became the standard for New World wines. The Robert Mondavi Institute (RMI) for Wine and Food Science at the University of California, Davis opened in October 2008 in his honor.

==Family history==
Robert Mondavi&#x27;s parents, Cesare Mondavi and Rosa Grassi, emigrated from Sassoferrato in the Marche region of Italy and settled in Hibbing, Minnesota. Robert Gerald Mondavi was born in Virginia, Minnesota. From Minnesota the Mondavi family moved to Lodi, California, where he attended Lodi High School. In Lodi, his father, Cesare, established a fruit packing business under the name C. Mondavi and Sons, packing and shipping grapes to the east coast primarily for home winemaking. Mondavi graduated from Stanford University in 1936 with a degree in economics and business administration.

In 1943, Mondavi joined his father and brother Peter after the family acquired the Charles Krug Winery located in St. Helena, California, from James Moffitt.
In 1965, Robert Mondavi left the family winery after a feud with his younger brother Peter over the business direction of the Krug Winery. Subsequently, Mondavi started his own winery in Oakville, California. 

Part of Mondavi&#x27;s original vineyard land included the &quot;To Kalon&quot; (a Greek term meaning &quot;the beautiful&quot;) vineyard originally established by Napa Valley pioneer H.W. Crabb in 1868. The winery produced wine in the California mission style. Mondavi selected Cliff May to design the winery building, which opened in 1966 and is now considered an architectural icon in the Napa Valley, with an expansive entryway arch and bell tower.

==Family==
In 1937, Mondavi married his high school sweetheart, Marjorie Ellen (Declusin) Mondavi. Together, the couple had three children: Michael, Marcia, and Tim. In the late 1970s, their marriage ended in a divorce. In 1980, at the age of 67, he married Margrit (Kellenberger) Biever Mondavi, a Swiss-born, and multilingual woman who worked at the Robert Mondavi winery. 

==Wine history==

In 1968, Mondavi made a dry oak–aged Sauvignon blanc, an unpopular variety in California at the time, and labeled it &quot;Fumé Blanc&quot;.

Mondavi entered into a joint venture with Baron Philippe de Rothschild of Château Mouton Rothschild to create Opus One Winery, and since the 1990s has set up joint ventures with local partners in Europe, South America and Australia.

In the Grand European Jury Wine Tasting of 1997, the Robert Mondavi Chardonnay Reserve was ranked number one.

In 2005, Mondavi and his younger brother Peter made wine together for the first time after their feud. Using grapes from both family vineyards, they produced one barrel of cabernet blend, which was sold for $400,000 under the name &quot;Ancora Una Volta&quot; (&quot;Once Again&quot;) at the 2005 Napa Valley Auction. 

==Legacy==
In 2001, Mondavi donated $10 million to help with the building cost of the Robert and Margrit Mondavi Center for the Performing Arts building at UC Davis.

In 2003, Mondavi expressed regret and criticized his sons for the business strategy that emphasized the inexpensive Mondavi lines, Coastal and Woodbridge, over the premium wines, allowing the company name to lose its association with fine wine it held in the past. He said, &quot;We&#x27;ve got to get our image back, and that&#x27;s going to take time.&quot;

In the 2004 documentary film &quot;Mondovino&quot;, the Mondavi family featured prominently, in close application to its theme of globalization. 

On December 22, 2004, Constellation Brands acquired the Mondavi winery in a controversial takeover for nearly US$1.36 billion in cash and assumption of debt. Following the sale of the company, Mondavi partnered with his younger son Tim Mondavi and daughter Marcia Mondavi to make a single wine from a single estate at the highest level. 

Robert and Margrit were also founding supporters of the restoration of the 19th-century Napa Valley Opera House and the Oxbow School, a new art school in Napa that provides grants and instruction to art students in their junior year of high school.

==Death==
Mondavi died at his Yountville home on May 16, 2008, at the age of 94.

==Published works==

==Awards and honors ==
In 1985, Mondavi received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

Robert Mondavi was selected as the &quot;Decanter&quot; &quot;Man of the Year&quot; in 1989. 
He was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1991.

In 2000 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Johnson &amp; Wales University.

In 2002, he received the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic. In 2005, he received the Legion of Honour from the French government.

On December 5, 2007, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and First Lady Maria Shriver inducted Mondavi into the California Hall of Fame, located at The California Museum for History, Women and the Arts.

He was inducted into the Culinary Institute of America Vintner&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2007. The election was based upon ballots from seventy wine journalists. The decision for their election of Mondavi is for contributions to the wine industry of California during his lifetime.

Robert Mondavi was awarded the Presidential Gold Medal of the Confrerie de la Chaine des Rotisseurs in December 2006 for his many contributions to the Society.

<text>Kleifarvatn () is the largest lake on the Reykjanes Peninsula in Iceland, situated in the southern part of the peninsula. It is located on the fissure zone of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The lake has no visible water coming in or going out as most of its water comes and leaves underground. The lake can be reached via a track, and there are two areas with high temperature that can be found not far from it: Seltún/Krýsuvík and another to the east. A 2012 survey demonstrated one definite geothermal vent under the lake and suggested two others in a linear line trending as for most of the faults in the area.

Kleifarvatn was first surveyed in 1964 and studied at greater resolution later. The lake&#x27;s greatest recorded depth was in 1975 with height above sea level of . After the 2000 Iceland earthquakes, the lake began to diminish, so that at least 20% of its surface has since disappeared and the serial surveys suggest there has been some material deposition as depth has reduced more than height above sea level of the lake surface. By 2012 the surface was at with a maximum depth of . The lake by then was only in area. Its area previously been measured between . The pattern of sedimentation suggests that at some time in the past the lake was smaller in size than it was in 2012.

The novel &quot;Kleifarvatn&quot; by Icelandic writer Arnaldur Indriðason was named after the lake.

<doc id="685028" wikidata="Q904928" url="?curid=685028" title="Super Bowl XL">
<text>Super Bowl XL was an American football game between the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Seattle Seahawks and the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Pittsburgh Steelers to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2005 season. The Steelers defeated the Seahawks by the score of 21–10. The game was played on February 5, 2006, at Ford Field in Detroit, Michigan. It is the most recent Super Bowl broadcast on ABC who lost the rights to broadcast Super Bowl games in the next NFL television contract (though under a new contract the network is scheduled to broadcast Super Bowl LXI) and the first where all aspects of the game itself were aired in HD. This was the last of 10 straight Super Bowls to feature a team seeking its first win.

With the win, the Steelers tied the San Francisco 49ers and the Dallas Cowboys with the then-record five Super Bowl victories (a record the Steelers themselves would break three years later). The Steelers&#x27; victory was their first Super Bowl victory since Super Bowl XIV. Pittsburgh, who finished the regular season with an 11–5 record, also became the fourth wild card team, the third in nine years, and the first ever number 6 seed in the NFL playoffs, to win a Super Bowl. The Seahawks, on the other hand, in their 30th season, were making their first ever Super Bowl appearance after posting an NFC-best 13–3 regular season record.

Pittsburgh capitalized on two big plays that were converted into touchdowns. The Steelers jumped to a 14–3 lead early in the third quarter with running back Willie Parker&#x27;s Super Bowl record 75-yard touchdown run. Seahawks defensive back Kelly Herndon&#x27;s then-Super Bowl record 76-yard interception return set up a Seattle touchdown to cut the lead 14–10. But Pittsburgh responded with Antwaan Randle El&#x27;s 43-yard touchdown pass to Hines Ward, the first time a wide receiver threw a touchdown pass in a Super Bowl, to clinch the game in the fourth quarter. Ward, who caught 5 passes for 123 yards and a touchdown, while also rushing for 18 yards, was named Super Bowl MVP.

The officiating in Super Bowl XL was met with criticism from members of the media soon after the game, leading NFL Films to rank it as one of the top ten controversial calls of all time.

==Background==
===Host selection process===

NFL owners voted to award Super Bowl XL to Detroit during their November 1, 2000, meeting held in Atlanta. It marked the second Super Bowl held in the Detroit area, the first was XVI played at the Pontiac Silverdome in the Detroit suburb of Pontiac. Three Super Bowls host sites were selected during the meeting, XXXVIII, XXXIX, and XL. However, XXXIX was the only one of the three that involved a competitive voting process. The vote for XL was mostly a formality, as Detroit had been tentatively preselected for the game, as a reward for constructing a new stadium. The host duties, however, were contingent on satisfying a series of basic requirements. No other cities were considered for XL.

On August 20, 1996, the Lions announced their intentions to build a new stadium in downtown Detroit. NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue helped lobby support for the project, announcing that the city of Detroit was positioned to host a Super Bowl if the stadium plans were to go forward. Despite some early mixed polls, on November 5, 1996, voters approved a tax referendum to fund the stadium construction in a landslide. Groundbreaking occurred three years later on November 16, 1999. With stadium construction underway, the NFL reaffirmed their commitment to awarding the facility a Super Bowl. By that time, host cities had been awarded, or tentatively assigned, through XXXVIII. With stiff competition from Miami, Jacksonville, and possibly Atlanta for XXXIX, Detroit set their sights on XL (February 2006). That more than satisfied the NFL&#x27;s rule that required new stadiums to wait until at least their second year of operation before hosting a Super Bowl, in order to iron out any logistical issues or construction delays. 

The Detroit host committee made their initial presentation on March 29, 2000, at the NFL owners meeting in Palm Beach. No other cities submitted bids for XL. The presentation was met with positive reviews. However, they had yet to secure the required number of hotel rooms, had not yet booked the venues needed for various ancillary events, and would need to install temporary seating at still-under construction Ford Field in order to meet minimum capacity. In addition, the Detroit area&#x27;s previous Super Bowl (XVI), while praised for its hospitality, suffered from extreme frigid temperatures and traffic jams. Complicating the situation was the possibility of needing to utilize three casino hotels in order to achieve the required number of hotel rooms. At the time, the NFL strongly avoided any associations with gambling, however, Paul Tagliabue seemed willing to overlook that concern. The city was also saddled with a longstanding reputation of decline, urban decay, and crime – an image the city was eagerly trying to shed.

Auto racing legend and business magnate Roger Penske was hired to serve as chairman of the host committee, and he made an aggressive push over the summer of 2000 to firm up Detroit&#x27;s bid. With doubts still hovering over Detroit&#x27;s chances, Penske, mayor Dennis Archer, and other key members of the committee held a private meeting with the NFL owners advisory committee on September 27 to make a follow-up pitch. The league set a deadline of October 11 for the final bid package submittal, or they were likely to re-open the bidding. A last-minute push resolved all of the remaining hurdles. On November 1, the host committee made their final presentation at the owners&#x27; meeting Atlanta, and Detroit was overwhelmingly approved as the host for Super Bowl XL. Jerry Jones called it &quot;outstanding...one of the best presentations that I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot; Wayne Huizenga characterized it as a &quot;slam-dunk&quot;, and Bud Adams said Detroit &quot;deserves a Super Bowl.&quot; Houston was awarded XXXVIII, and Jacksonville won the vote for XXXIX.

This would be the first Super Bowl played on the newer FieldTurf surface; each of the previous Super Bowls had been played either on natural grass or on the first-generation AstroTurf.

===Teams===
====Seattle Seahawks====
The Seahawks entered Super Bowl XL after finishing the regular season with an NFC-best 13–3 record. After a rocky 2–2 start, they won 11 consecutive games before losing to the Green Bay Packers to finish the season. The 13–3 record and 11-game winning streak set new team records.

This was Seattle&#x27;s first Super Bowl appearance in the team&#x27;s 30-year history. The Seahawks had been mediocre for much of the 1990s, recording eight consecutive non-winning seasons from 1991 through 1998. The team hit a low point in 1996, when then-owner Ken Behring announced his intention to move the team to the Los Angeles area. The team&#x27;s fortunes began to turn in 1997, when Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen bought the team and brokered a deal to build a new football stadium, Qwest Field (now Lumen Field), to replace the aging Kingdome. Mike Holmgren, who had led the Green Bay Packers to Super Bowls XXXI and XXXII, became head coach in 1999. He became the fifth coach to take two franchises to the Super Bowl. Joe Jurevicius became the sixth player to play in a Super Bowl with three teams, having previously played in Super Bowl XXXV with the Giants and in Super Bowl XXXVII with the Buccaneers.

Behind running back Shaun Alexander, Seattle finished the 2005 season as the league&#x27;s top offense, scoring 452 points. Meanwhile, quarterback Matt Hasselbeck completed 65.5 percent of his passes for 3,455 yards 24 touchdowns and nine interceptions, and added 124 yards and one touchdown on the ground. Alexander, who had scored at least 16 touchdowns in each of the previous four seasons, had the best campaign of his career, leading the league with 1,880 rushing yards and scoring an NFL-record 28 touchdowns, for which he was rewarded with the NFL Most Valuable Player Award. Although the Seahawks suffered injuries to starting wide receivers Darrell Jackson and Bobby Engram throughout the season, the passing game proved potent, as Engram managed for 778 receiving yards. Joe Jurevicius, a backup when the season began, started eleven games and had for 694 receiving yards and 10 touchdowns; tight end Jerramy Stevens also emerged as a Hasselbeck target with 554 receiving yards and five touchdowns. Hasselbeck was protected and Alexander was given time to run by a stout offensive line, led by Pro Bowl offensive tackle Walter Jones, guard Steve Hutchinson, and center Robbie Tobeck, and by Pro Bowl fullback Mack Strong.

Though rookie middle linebacker Lofa Tatupu was the Seahawks&#x27; only defensive Pro Bowl selection, the Seahawks&#x27; defense recorded 50 quarterback sacks, leading the NFL in that category; defensive end Bryce Fisher led the Seahawks with 9 sacks, while defensive tackle Rocky Bernard added 8.5 and veteran defensive end Grant Wistrom recorded 4. Despite starting two rookies at linebacker for most of the year, the Seattle linebacking corps played well, led by Tatupu, who topped the team with 104 tackles and added 4 sacks, three interceptions, and one fumble recovery. From his strong safety position, Michael Boulware led the team with four interceptions and also tallied 2 sacks and one fumble recovery. The Seattle secondary suffered injuries throughout the year, notably to free safety Ken Hamlin; second-year cornerback Jordan Babineaux played well as he appeared in all 16 games for Seattle, intercepting three passes and making 61 tackles. For the year, the defense surrendered just 271 points, 181 fewer than the Seahawks offense scored.

====Pittsburgh Steelers====

After a 7–5 start, the Steelers won their final four games to qualify for the playoffs with an 11–5 record. They also became the first team ever to defeat the top three seeded teams on the road in the playoffs (#3 Cincinnati, #1 Indianapolis and #2 Denver). In addition, the team became the first sixth-seeded team to reach both a conference championship game and the Super Bowl since the NFL expanded to a 12-team playoff format in 1990.

Under Bill Cowher&#x27;s reign as head coach since 1992, the Steelers had been one of the top teams in the NFL, making the playoffs in 10 out of his 14 seasons, advancing to the AFC Championship Game six times, and making an appearance in Super Bowl XXX, losing to the Dallas Cowboys 27–17. After having finished the 2003 season with a 6–10 record and after splitting its first two games to open 2004, Pittsburgh lost starting quarterback Tommy Maddox to injury. Maddox was replaced by rookie quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, who was drafted with the 11th pick in the 2004 NFL draft but was not expected to play during his rookie season. Nevertheless, Roethlisberger led the Steelers to victory in all of the team&#x27;s 14 remaining regular season games, giving Pittsburgh a 15–1 record and making the Steelers the first AFC team ever to win 15 games. However, the Steelers lost to eventual Super Bowl champion New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game.

Pittsburgh began the 2005 season by winning seven of its first nine games, but suffered a major setback when both Roethlisberger and his backup, Charlie Batch, went down with injuries. With Maddox back as the starter, the team was defeated by Baltimore and dropped two more games after Roethlisberger&#x27;s return, falling to then-undefeated Indianapolis, and division rival Cincinnati. The postseason hopes of the Steelers were in peril, but the team recovered to win its final four regular season games and to claim the 6-seed in the AFC playoffs.

Roethlisberger was efficient in his 12 regular season games, throwing for 2,385 yards and seventeen touchdowns with nine interceptions, while adding three rushing touchdowns. The Steelers&#x27; main receiving threat was wide receiver Hines Ward, who led the team with 975 receiving yards and 11 touchdowns. On the other side of the field, speedy wide receiver Antwaan Randle El was a constant breakaway threat with 558 receiving yards, while gaining 448 yards and two touchdowns on punt returns. Rookie tight end Heath Miller also recorded for 459 receiving yards and six touchdowns.

Pittsburgh&#x27;s main strength on offense, however, was its running game. Running back Willie Parker was the team&#x27;s leading rusher with 1,202 yards, while also recording 218 receiving yards and scoring five touchdowns. In short-yardage situations, the team relied on running back Jerome Bettis, who rushed for 368 yards and scored nine touchdowns. The 33-year-old Bettis finished his 13th NFL season as the league&#x27;s fifth all-time leading rusher (13,662 yards and 91 touchdowns), but until this point he had never played in a Super Bowl. The Steelers rushing attack was powered by an offensive line led by Pro Bowl guard Alan Faneca and Pro Bowl reserve center Jeff Hartings.

The Steelers defense ranked fourth in the NFL, giving up 284.0 total yards per game. The Pittsburgh defense was led by its linebacking corps: Joey Porter, James Farrior, Clark Haggans, and Larry Foote. Porter led all NFL linebackers with 10.5 quarterback sacks and also recorded two interceptions and a fumble recovery. Haggans tallied 9 sacks and 40 tackles, while Farrior added a team-high 119 tackles to go with his 2 sacks and one fumble recovery. In the secondary, free safety Chris Hope led the team with three interceptions, while Pro Bowl safety Troy Polamalu, the team&#x27;s top threat in the defensive backfield, notched 91 tackles, 3 sacks, two fumble recoveries, and two interceptions.

The Steelers became just the third team to win the Super Bowl despite not playing a single home game in the playoffs. The Green Bay Packers, who won Super Bowl I (against the Kansas City Chiefs), and the Kansas City Chiefs, who won Super Bowl IV (against the Minnesota Vikings), also accomplished the feat. The Steelers, however, had to win four games to accomplish the feat, while the Chiefs won three and Packers won two games.

Of a &quot;bridging the eras&quot; moment, Steelers cornerback Willie Williams was the last remaining player to have been on the Steelers last Super Bowl team, their Super Bowl XXX loss to the Dallas Cowboys following the 1995 season. (Defensive backs coach Darren Perry was also a player on the Super Bowl XXX team. Both were starters in that game.) Ironically, Williams, who was in his second stint with the Steelers at the time, played with Seattle from 1997 to 2003. He was inactive for Super Bowl XL, which, like Bettis, turned out to be his final NFL game before retiring that offseason.

===Statistical comparison===
The chart below provides a comparison of regular season statistics in key categories (overall rank amongst 32 teams in parentheses).

===Playoffs===
The Seahawks became the first team to advance to the Super Bowl without playing a division champion in the playoffs (later matched by the Colts in 2009, Steelers in 2010, and the Seahawks again in 2013, with the 2013 Seahawks being the only one of the four to win the Super Bowl). Off a first-round bye, Seattle defeated the sixth-seeded Washington Redskins, 20–10, before eliminating the fifth-seeded Carolina Panthers, 34–14, in the NFC Championship Game. These were Seattle&#x27;s first playoff victories since the 1984 season when they defeated the Los Angeles Raiders 13–7, when the team was still in the AFC (the Seahawks were in that conference from 1977 to 2001).

The Steelers became the second team after the 1985 New England Patriots to win three road playoff games to reach the Super Bowl. Pittsburgh defeated the third-seeded Cincinnati Bengals, 31–17; the top-seeded Indianapolis Colts, 21–18 in the &quot;Immaculate Redemption/Tackle II&quot; game; and the second-seeded Denver Broncos, 34–17, in the AFC Championship Game. The Steelers also became the eighth wild-card team to go to the Super Bowl and the fourth in nine seasons. The Steelers&#x27; catchphrase for the playoffs was &quot;One for the Thumb&quot;, a phrase originally made popular by Joe Greene as an allusion to a fifth Super Bowl ring.

===Practice venues===

====Seahawks====
The Seahawks practiced at the Detroit Lions&#x27; practice facility in Allen Park.

====Steelers====
The Steelers practiced at the Silverdome in Pontiac (site of Super Bowl XVI). Since the Silverdome featured Astroturf, a FieldTurf surface was temporarily installed at the venue specifically for these practices. After the Super Bowl the playing surface used for these practices was donated by the manufacturers of FieldTurf for use at Wisner Stadium, a public sports stadium in Pontiac.

===Promotion===
The NFL promoted this Super Bowl under the slogan &quot;The Road to Forty.&quot; The slogan not only honored the 40-year history of the game, but was a nod to Detroit&#x27;s traditional role as the center of the U.S. automotive industry. In a related note, Roger Penske, owner of a car dealership, racing team, and other related companies, headed the Super Bowl XL host committee.

The Seahawks became the first team to have their full team name painted in their end zone for a Super Bowl, as their geographic location name (Seattle) was painted above the team nickname (Seahawks). In Super Bowl XLIII, coincidentally also against the Steelers, the Arizona Cardinals became the second team to have their full team name painted in their end zone, as their geographic location name (Arizona) was painted above the team nickname (Cardinals). For all other Super Bowl teams, end zones have featured only the team nickname.

==Broadcasting==

===United States===

Super Bowl XL was televised by ABC. This was ABC&#x27;s final NFL telecast before the ABC Sports division merged with sister network ESPN in September 2006 to form ESPN on ABC. And under the league&#x27;s new television contracts beginning in the 2006 season, ESPN took over &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; from ABC, and NBC took over &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; from ESPN. The NFL was then reluctant to add ESPN to the Super Bowl rotation because of the potential decrease in viewership due to the relatively limited access to cable television compared to that of an over-the-air network. The league would then allow ABC to simulcast all future ESPN-produced playoff games starting in January 2016, and select Monday Night games starting in 2020. ESPN/ABC simulcasts would finally be added to the Super Bowl rotation in 2021, with the Super Bowls in 2027 and 2031.

The telecast featured play-by-play announcer Al Michaels, color commentator John Madden, who was named the day before to the Class of 2006 by the Pro Football Hall of Fame, sideline reporters Michele Tafoya (Steelers sideline) and Suzy Kolber (Seahawks sideline). This was the sixth Super Bowl telecast for Michaels, and the tenth for Madden (whose first was Super Bowl XVI, also played in Michigan). This was also the second Super Bowl broadcast for the Michaels-Madden pairing after they had called Super Bowl XXXVII for ABC three years earlier. Madden had already signed with NBC to broadcast games for them beginning in the 2006 season; several days later Michaels, who was still under contract to ABC and ESPN, joined him in exchange for ESPN gaining partial coverage of the Ryder Cup golf tournament and The Walt Disney Company, ABC&#x27;s parent, gaining all intellectual property rights to Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, a cartoon character that Walt Disney had created for Universal Pictures (NBC&#x27;s corporate sibling) in the 1920s. Michaels and Madden would go on to call one more Super Bowl together, Super Bowl XLIII, after which Madden retired from broadcasting altogether.

Chris Berman, from Disney-owned corporate sibling ESPN, returned to host ABC&#x27;s pregame show, as he had done for ABC&#x27;s coverage of Super Bowls XXXIV and XXXVII. Berman was joined by his fellow analysts from ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Sunday NFL Countdown&quot; pregame show: Michael Irvin, Tom Jackson, and Steve Young, along with co-host Mike Tirico and New England Patriots head coach (and three-time Super Bowl winner) Bill Belichick. Also contributing to the pre-game show were Tafoya, Kolber, Sam Ryan, Andrea Kremer, Kenny Mayne and Chris Mortensen.

Although the Super Bowl had largely been presented in high definition since Super Bowl XXXIV, Super Bowl XL was the first Super Bowl where all aspects of the game itself were aired in HD.

For its Super Bowl lead-out program, ABC aired the &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; episode &quot;It&#x27;s the End of the World&quot;.

Westwood One/CBS Radio provided national radio coverage in the United States, with the broadcasting team of Marv Albert and Boomer Esiason.

====Advertising====
As usual, the American television broadcast of the Super Bowl showcased top commercials and commanded high prices, estimated at $2.6 million (US) for a 30-second spot. According to &quot;Advertising Age&quot;, Anheuser-Busch was the top advertiser during the game, having purchased ten 30-second spots. The magazine reported that other companies having purchased multiple commercial segments included Ameriquest (two), CareerBuilder.com (two), Pepsi-Cola (four), Pizza Hut (ten, though most ran prior to kickoff), Sprint (three), Procter &amp; Gamble (four, three for Gillette&#x27;s new Fusion razor), Warner Bros. (three), Disney (two) and GoDaddy.com (two). Three companies aired 60-second advertisements: General Motors (for the Cadillac brand), Burger King, and Mobile ESPN (the Sports Heaven ad). Agency BBDO was the biggest single producer of commercials, creating 19. ABC also aired several 60-second commercials for some of its shows, including &quot;Lost&quot;, &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, and &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;. Notably, this was the first Super Bowl during which commercials, in addition to the game itself, were broadcast in HDTV. During typical HDTV broadcasts at the time, commercials themselves were broadcast in standard definition.

Google Video and America Online each catalogued ads for later viewing. The &quot;USA Today Super Bowl Ad Meter&quot; and ADBOWL, which both measure viewer online reaction to all Super Bowl ads, found the Bud Light &quot;Magic refrigerator&quot; spot ranked as the top spot.

===International===
The main NFL international feed of the game featured Fox broadcasters Dick Stockton and Daryl Johnston providing commentary tailored to those largely unfamiliar with the rules of American football.

Since the game was being played close to the U.S.-Canada border, Canadian television rights holders Global broadcast portions of an NFL-sponsored &quot;Passport To The Super Bowl&quot; event in nearby Windsor, Ontario, featuring a performance by the newly revived 1980s rock group INXS with Canadian native lead singer J.D. Fortune, though the network limited coverage of the Windsor event to short segments immediately prior to commercial breaks.

The game was also televised in Australia on (SBS and ESPN International), Austria (ORF and TW1), Brazil (ESPN International), Denmark (TV 2), Finland (MTV3), France (France 2), Germany (ARD), Hungary (Sport 1), Iceland (SÝN), Ireland (Sky Sports), Italy (Sky Sports 3 and Italia 1), Japan (NHK BS-1, NTV), Mexico (TV Azteca), Netherlands (SBS6), New Zealand (ESPN International/SKY TV), Portugal (SportTV), Slovenia (Prva TV), Spain (Canal +), Sweden (ZTV), and UK and Ireland (ITV/Sky Sports). According to the NFL, the game was available worldwide in 32 languages.

Sirius Satellite Radio and NFL.com carried international local-language broadcasts from the United Kingdom (BBC Radio Five Live), Spain (Canal Plus Spain), Russia (NTV), Belgium (BeTV, in French), China (SMG), and Japan (NTV), in addition to the press box intercom and the public address announcer feeds.

==Entertainment==

===Pre-game ceremonies===
During the pre-game ceremonies, Stevie Wonder, along with Joss Stone, India Arie, and John Legend, performed a medley of Wonder&#x27;s hits. The Four Tops also performed during the pregame ceremonies, though the performance was not televised.

In honor of the fortieth Super Bowl, the pre-game ceremony featured the on-field introduction of 30 of the previous 34 Super Bowl Most Valuable Players (with the exception of Joe Montana, Terry Bradshaw, Jake Scott, and the late Harvey Martin). The absences of Montana and Bradshaw were originally reported to have been due to disagreements over appearance funds to be paid by the NFL, but each later rebutted such reports, suggesting that they had prior family commitments; Scott was reported to have been traveling through Australia. This ceremony continued a ten-year tradition (starting with Super Bowl XX and then repeated in Super Bowl XXX) in which past Super Bowl MVPs were honored before the game.

A moment of silence was observed in memory of the two civil rights activists who had died during the months prior to the game: Coretta Scott King (six days earlier) and Rosa Parks (on October 24, 2005), the latter a long-time Detroit resident.

The Steelers became the first AFC club, and only the third franchise overall, to wear white jerseys despite being the &quot;home&quot; team. The first two clubs, the Cowboys (Super Bowls XIII and XXVII) and the Redskins (Super Bowl XVII), traditionally wore white at home. The Denver Broncos later became the second AFC team and fourth club overall to wear white jerseys in a Super Bowl despite being the home team in Super Bowl 50. Bill Cowher stated that the Steelers were playing in Detroit, not Pittsburgh, and therefore it was not a &quot;home&quot; game (although 10 years earlier Cowher&#x27;s Steelers did wear their black home jerseys as the designated &quot;home&quot; team in Super Bowl XXX at Tempe, Arizona away from Pittsburgh, where they had won both their playoff games to reach that Super Bowl). Having been the Cowboys&#x27; opponent in Super Bowl XIII, Pittsburgh also became the first team to have worn white jerseys for a &quot;home&quot; Super Bowl and colored jerseys for an &quot;away&quot; one.

The teams took the field while flanked on either side by flags bearing the names of all previous Super Bowl MVPs. Although the participating teams each entered as a team for their introduction, the Steelers insisted on sending Jerome Bettis out ahead of the rest of the team in front of his hometown crowd.

Singers Aretha Franklin and New Orleans native Aaron Neville, along with pianist Dr. John and a 150-member choir, performed the national anthem as part of a pre-game tribute to New Orleans, a nine-time Super Bowl host city then in the midst of efforts to rebuild in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. The national anthem was performed in American Sign Language by Angela LaGuardia, a teacher at Michigan School for the Deaf.

Tom Brady, MVP of Super Bowls XXXVI and XXXVIII, became the first active player to participate in a Super Bowl coin toss, the result of which toss was tails, as selected by Seattle.

===Halftime show===

The Rolling Stones performed during the halftime show, which was sponsored by the American telecommunications company Sprint. The group performed three songs: &quot;Start Me Up&quot;, &quot;Rough Justice&quot;, and &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Get No) Satisfaction&quot;. The show was viewed by 89.9 million people.

===Post-game ceremonies===
The post-game presentation saw Bart Starr, the MVP of Super Bowls I and II, take the Vince Lombardi Trophy to the podium, whence it was presented to Steelers owner Dan Rooney.

==Game summary==

===First half===
After the first four possessions of the Super Bowl XL ended with punts, Seahawks punt returner Peter Warrick gave his team good field position by returning Chris Gardocki&#x27;s 37-yard punt 12 yards to Seattle&#x27;s 49-yard line. Quarterback Matt Hasselbeck then started off the drive with a pair of completions to receivers Darrell Jackson and Joe Jurevicius for gains of 20 and 11 yards, respectively. On the third play of the drive, Jackson caught a pass in the end-zone, apparently for a touchdown, but the play was nullified as Jackson was called for pass interference. Running back Shaun Alexander ran the ball the next two plays but gained only three yards. Hasselbeck&#x27;s third-down pass attempt fell incomplete, and the Seahawks were forced to settle for a 47-yard field goal by kicker Josh Brown, which was successful.

By the end of the first quarter, the Steelers had failed to gain a first down, and quarterback Ben Roethlisberger had completed one of five pass attempts for one yard. On their first second-quarter possession, Pittsburgh once more was forced to punt after three plays, but benefited from another Seahawks penalty, a holding call that nullified Warrick&#x27;s 34-yard punt return. The Steelers forced a Seattle punt, but Seattle safety Michael Boulware intercepted a Roethlisberger pass at the Seattle 17-yard line on the ensuing drive. The Seahawks, though, were once more forced to punt after three plays, and Pittsburgh drove into Seattle territory on the following drive. An offensive pass interference call against tight end Heath Miller and a sack for an eight-yard loss by Seahawks defensive end Grant Wistrom, though, backed the Steelers to the 40-yard line, and left the team facing a third-down-and-28. However, Roethlisberger hit receiver Hines Ward out of a scramble and extremely unorthodox, against the grain pass for a 37-yard gain to give the team the longest third down conversion in Super Bowl history. Jerome Bettis carried the ball on the next two plays, taking his team to the one-yard line but not into the end-zone. On the third-down play, after the two-minute warning, Roethlisberger faked a hand-off and dove into the end-zone himself. There was some confusion as to whether or not he had scored, since the referee hesitated for a bit after the play ended, but he eventually signaled a touchdown, and it was upheld after a replay challenge. On the strength of a 19-yard Jurevicius reception, Seattle advanced the ball to the Pittsburgh 36-yard line, but, after the drive stalled, Brown missed a 54-yard field goal attempt to the right and the Steelers ran out the clock to end the first half.

===Second half===
The Steelers took the ball to begin the second half, and just two plays in, running back Willie Parker broke through for a 75-yard touchdown run, giving his team a 14–3 lead and setting a record for the longest run in Super Bowl history, beating Marcus Allen&#x27;s Super Bowl XVIII mark by one yard. The Seahawks drove into Pittsburgh territory on the next drive, sparked by a 21-yard run by Alexander, but Brown again missed a field-goal attempt, this one from 50 yards, as Seattle was unable to close the 11-point deficit. Pittsburgh drove 54 yards to the Seattle six-yard line to put themselves in position to take a large lead, but Seahawks defensive back Kelly Herndon intercepted a pass from Roethlisberger and returned it a Super Bowl record 76 yards to the Steelers 20-yard line. Herndon&#x27;s interception remains as of 2024, the longest non-scoring play in Super Bowl history. From there, the Seahawks required just two plays to score on Hasselbeck&#x27;s 16-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jerramy Stevens, cutting their deficit to 14–10. The teams exchanged punts (two from Pittsburgh, one from Seattle) to fill out most of the third quarter, but the Seahawks ended the quarter having driven from their own two-yard line to near midfield. The drive continued in the fourth quarter, as the Seahawks reached the Pittsburgh 19-yard line. An 18-yard pass to Stevens, though, was negated on a penalty call against Seattle tackle Sean Locklear for holding, denying the Seahawks an opportunity for a first-down-and-goal from the 1-yard-line. Three plays later, Pittsburgh defensive back Ike Taylor intercepted a Hasselbeck pass at the 5-yard line and returned it 24 yards. While tackling Taylor, Hasselbeck dove low and was flagged for blocking below the waist. The penalty added 15 yards to the return and gave the Steelers the ball on their own 44-yard line. Four plays later, Pittsburgh ran a wide receiver reverse, but the play turned out to be a pass play by wide receiver Antwaan Randle El, who played quarterback while in college. Parker took a pitch from Roethlisberger and handed off to Randle El, who was running in the opposite direction. Randle El then pulled up and threw a 43-yard touchdown pass to a wide-open Ward, giving the Steelers a 21–10 lead and also marking the first time a wide receiver threw a touchdown pass in a Super Bowl. On the ensuing possession, Hasselbeck ran the ball for eighteen yards and was briefly touched by Steelers linebacker Larry Foote as the former fell to the ground. Though the play was initially ruled a fumble, with the ball recovered by the Steelers, a Seahawks challenge proved successful, as officials ruled Hasselbeck to have been down prior to his having lost the ball, Seattle, aided by a 13-yard Jurevicius reception, drove to the Pittsburgh 48-yard line but could go no further; a Tom Rouen punt entered the end zone, giving the Steelers possession on their own 20-yard line. Pittsburgh possessed the ball for nearly four-and-one-half minutes on the ensuing drive, as Bettis carried seven times, Seattle was forced to use all of its three timeouts to stop the clock, but nevertheless had only 1:51 left when it took the ball from its own 20-yard line following a Gardocki punt. A 35-yard reception by Jurevicius took the Seahawks into Pittsburgh territory, and a 13-yard Bobby Engram reception took the team to within field-goal range, but dubious clock-management and play-calling left the team with just 35 seconds remaining; an incompletion and a three-yard pass to Stevens over the middle of the field consumed 26 seconds, and Hasselbeck threw incomplete near Stevens on fourth down, giving the Steelers the ball on downs with just three seconds remaining, after which a Roethlisberger kneel-down ended the game.

===Box score===



===Statistical overview===
The Steelers became just the third team to win the Super Bowl despite not playing a home game in the playoffs. The Green Bay Packers, who won Super Bowl I, and the Kansas City Chiefs, who won Super Bowl IV, also accomplished the feat. The Steelers, however, had to win four games to accomplish the feat, while the Chiefs won three and Packers won only two games.

Roethlisberger finished the game having completed just 9 of 21 passes for 123 yards and having also thrown two interceptions; his 22.6 quarterback rating was the lowest ever by a Super Bowl winning quarterback. He also rushed for 25 yards and a touchdown. He became the second youngest quarterback to start in a Super Bowl and the youngest quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl at 23 years, 11 months.

The Steelers&#x27; rushing game was paced by Willie Parker, who gained 93 yards and one touchdown on ten carries, Bettis rushed 14 times for 43 yards, converted a key first down, and allowed his team to run time off the clock late in the fourth quarter. Ward caught five passes for 123 yards and a touchdown. In addition to his 43-yard touchdown pass, Randle El caught three passes for 22 yards and returned two punts for 32 yards.

In defeat for the Seahawks, Hasselbeck completed 26 of 49 pass attempts for 273 yards and a touchdown, with one interception. Jurevicius caught 5 passes for 93 yards. Engram and Jackson also played roles, combining to gain 120 yards on eleven receptions. Alexander led all rushers in the game, accumulating 95 yards on 20 carries while also catching two passes for two yards. The Steelers were the third team to lose the turnover battle and win the game, after the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl V and the Steelers in Super Bowl XIV.

Defensively, Taylor led the Steelers, making seven tackles, defensing two passes, and intercepting Hasselbeck; for the Seahawks, linebacker Lofa Tatupu recorded nine tackles.

===Reaction to officiating===
The officiating in Super Bowl XL was met with criticism from members of the media soon after the game. One call that was complained about was an offensive pass interference on Seahawks wide receiver Darrell Jackson for a push-off against Steelers safety Chris Hope that nullified his 16-yard touchdown reception in the first quarter. However, according to the NFL&#x27;s Director of Officiating at the time, Mike Pereira, the call was indeed correct as Jackson had pushed off.

Another complaint had to do with a penalty in the fourth quarter against Seattle right tackle Sean Locklear for holding Steelers linebacker Clark Haggans that nullified a deep pass. Pereira later stated that Locklear was definitively holding and the call was correct. Also disputed was the penalty on Hasselbeck for an illegal block below the waist while making a tackle during Ike Taylor&#x27;s interception return.

In addition, many Steelers fans were outraged by an incomplete pass call early in the game from Hasselbeck to Jerramy Stevens. Stevens appeared to have possession and then fumble, only for the officials to rule he never had complete possession. The Steelers also were upset about a call on a play that appeared to give them possession of the football when Matt Hasselbeck fumbled while scrambling. It was ruled however that Hasselbeck had been touched before losing control of the football, thus negating the fumble.

&quot;Kansas City Star&quot; writer Jason Whitlock encapsulated some views when he wrote the day after the game, &quot;Bill Leavy and his crew ruined Super Bowl XL. Am I the only one who would like to hear them defend their incompetence?&quot; Initially, some fans reacted negatively as well. A February 7 online ESPN poll found that, with 103,167 votes cast, 61.7% of those votes were cast for the choice of &quot;officiating mistakes affected the outcome of Super Bowl XL.&quot; Seahawks head coach Mike Holmgren himself took issue with the officiating at a rally for his team on February 6 at Qwest Field, saying, &quot;We knew it was going to be tough going against the Pittsburgh Steelers. I didn&#x27;t know we were going to have to play the guys in the striped shirts as well.&quot;.

In response to the criticisms leveled at the officials, the NFL, just two days after the game, released a statement defending the officials&#x27; performance. &quot;The game was properly officiated, including, as in most NFL games, some tight plays that produced disagreement about the calls made by the officials&quot;, NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said in a statement.

High-profile referee Ed Hochuli said &quot;The Super Bowl was one of those games where it seemed the big calls went against Seattle. And that was just fortuitous—bad fortuitous for Seattle.&quot; Hochuli went on to say that &quot;The league felt, actually, that the Super Bowl was well officiated. Now, that doesn&#x27;t mean there were no mistakes. There are always mistakes, but it was a well-officiated game.&quot;

On August 6, 2010, while visiting the Seahawks&#x27; preseason training camp for an annual rules interpretation session with the Seattle media, Leavy brought up Super Bowl XL without being asked, and said:
The Super Bowl XL officiating controversy was later listed as number 8 on the NFL&#x27;s list of the top ten controversial calls of all time. Commentators Boomer Esiason, Steve Raible, and Tom Curran were critical of the officiating, while former Steelers wide receiver Hines Ward and commentator Ed Bouchette defended the calls, and commentators Howard Balzer and Bill Hillgrove and former Steelers defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau felt that the officiating did not impact the outcome of the game.

==Gambling==
* According to Las Vegas oddsmakers, the Steelers opened betting as a four-point favorite. As the Steelers won by eleven points, they covered this spread.
* The over-under, or expected points total, for the game, opened at 47. As the total combined score of this game was only 31 points, the under bet won.
* The money line was set at roughly +160 for the Seahawks and −180 for the Steelers.

This was just the fifth time in Super Bowl history when a lower-seeded team opened as the favorite to win; the previous occurrences were Super Bowls XXXIX (AFC second-seeded New England Patriots were favored by seven points over NFC top-seed Philadelphia Eagles), XXXV (AFC fourth-seeded Baltimore Ravens were favored by three points over NFC top-seed New York Giants), XXIII (NFC second-seeded San Francisco 49ers were favored by seven points over AFC first-seed Cincinnati Bengals), and XVII (AFC second-seeded Miami Dolphins were favored by three points over NFC top-seed Washington Redskins). In each but the last iteration, the lower-seeded and favored team won.

This was also the second time in Super Bowl history when the favorite was a wild card team, the first was before Super Bowl XXXV, when the Ravens were favored. It also marked the first time since that game the favorite won against the spread.

Members of the winning team each received a payment of $73,000 for playing in the game, while players on the losing team were paid $38,000. The Green Bay Packers received $15,000 each for winning Super Bowl I in 1967; adjusted for inflation in 2006 dollars, that sum is roughly $86,000.

After having held constant at $600 for three years, the face value of the costliest Super Bowl ticket rose to $700 for the game. On eBay, the least-desirable seats—those behind each end zone in the upper level—fetched more than $2000 each, while top seats around the 50-yard line sold for more than $6000.

==Ring==

The ring for the Pittsburgh Steelers was designed by Steelers owner Dan Rooney with Jerome Bettis and Ben Roethlisberger. It is crowned by five Vince Lombardi trophies, all topped with football-shaped diamond settings to represent their five Super Bowl victories. Rooney would have preferred the ring to focus exclusively on this team&#x27;s win, but Bettis and Roethlisberger, cognizant of a tradition of which they couldn&#x27;t help but be reminded, insisted that it acknowledge the legacy of all those teams (indeed, during the pre-game MVP introductions, Franco Harris, winner of the award in the Steelers&#x27; first Super Bowl IX victory 31 years earlier on January 12, 1975, had waved a Terrible Towel as he walked onto the field).

The base of each trophy has the Roman numeral for their victories, with Super Bowl XL front and center. In front of the trophies is the Steelers logo set with colored jewels to mimic the colors of the logo. On the top of the crown is &quot;PITTSBURGH&quot;, and on the bottom is &quot;WORLD CHAMPIONS&quot;. Each side of the crown has 10 square cut diamonds channel set along the edge. The left side of the ring has the player&#x27;s name and number with the NFL logo in between, while the right side has the score of the game (Steelers 21 Seahawks 10) above the Super Bowl XL logo over 2005. The year on the ring is for the NFL season, and not the year the game was played.

The Super Bowl XL rings were produced by the Minneapolis-based jewelry company Jostens, which is the primary supplier of Super Bowl champion rings and has made 31 rings in the Super Bowl&#x27;s 50-year history through 2017. The National Football League covers the cost of 150 rings, paying up to $5,000 for each (three quarters of a million dollars). If a team wants a fancier look, such as player names, more gems or detailed designs, or more than 150 rings, then the team owner has to foot the bill for the extra cost.

<text>The Glerá (, &quot;glass river&quot;) is a river in northern Iceland. It originates from glaciers in the mountains of the Tröllaskagi peninsula and also draws from some freshwater springs on its way down Glerá Valley. It runs through the town of Akureyri before it flows into the sea in Eyjafjörður. The river formed the sandbank of Oddeyri where it enters the sea. It was important in the dawn of the industrial age in Akureyri when it was dammed and used to produce electricity from 17 September 1922. The original power station has been demolished now but the dam remains. A new power station has been built to commemorate 100 years of hydroelectric power in Iceland. This 290 kW (rated capacity) power station was opened on August 27, 2005.

The river used to separate Akureyri proper from Glerá Village which was the settlement north of the Glerá but it merged with the township of Akureyri in the early 20th century. Today the part of Akureyri that is north of the Glerá is called &quot;Glerárhverfi&quot; (Glerá Borough) or &quot;Þorpið&quot; (The Village) and more than 7000 of the town&#x27;s 17000 residents live there.

<text>Ruislip () is a London Underground station in Ruislip in west London. The station is on the Uxbridge branch of both the Metropolitan and Piccadilly lines, between Ickenham and Ruislip Manor stations. The station is located on Station Approach. It is in Travelcard Zone 6. It is the oldest station on the Uxbridge branch and was originally the only intermediate station on the line between Uxbridge and Harrow-on-the-Hill.

==History==
The Metropolitan Railway (Harrow and Uxbridge Railway) constructed the line between Harrow-on-the-Hill and Uxbridge and commenced services on 4 July 1904 with, initially, Ruislip being the only intermediate stop. At first, services were operated by steam trains, but track electrification was completed in the subsequent months and electric trains began operating on 1 January 1905. The formation was made wide enough at Ruislip to enable another pair of tracks to be constructed as passing loops or additional platform roads. Neither has ever occurred.

On 1 March 1910, an extension of the District line from South Harrow to connect with the Metropolitan Railway at Rayners Lane was opened enabling District line trains to serve stations between Rayners Lane and Uxbridge from that date. On 23 October 1933, District line services were replaced by Piccadilly line trains.

Currently, only the station&#x27;s eastbound (Central London) platform has step-free access. Passengers who wish to travel in the Uxbridge direction and are unable to use the footbridge (which is the only link between the westbound platform and the entrance/exit) must travel to Northwick Park or Sudbury Town and change direction there. In 2018, it was announced that the station will be made fully accessible, as part of a £200m investment to increase the number of accessible stations on the Tube.

It is possible to reverse trains from west to east at Ruislip. Trains must detrain in the westbound platform and then continue for approximately half a mile to a reversing siding leading to Ruislip Depot. After reversing, the train must come back the way it came and enter the eastbound platform by means of a crossover. Unfortunately, while this manoeuvre is carried out, both the westbound and eastbound services are held up. Therefore, this manoeuvre is usually only done by some peak-hour Piccadilly line trains due to the inconvenience it causes. There was formerly a crossover to the east of the station enabling trains to leave the westbound platform in an easterly direction, and a goods yard to the north of the line.

<text>Bryggen (&quot;the dock&quot;), also known as Tyskebryggen (, &quot;the German dock&quot;), is a series of Hanseatic heritage commercial buildings lining up the eastern side of the Vågen harbour in the city of Bergen, Norway. Bryggen has been on the UNESCO list for World Cultural Heritage sites since 1979.

The city of Bergen was founded around 1070 within the boundaries of Tyskebryggen. Around 1350 a &quot;Kontor&quot; of the Hanseatic League was established there, and Tyskebryggen became the centre of the Hanseatic commercial activities in Norway. Today, Bryggen houses museums, shops, restaurants and pubs.

==History==
Bergen was established before 1070 AD. In the Middle Ages, the Bryggen area encompassed all buildings between the sea and the &quot;Stretet&quot; (&quot;Øvregaten&quot;) road, from Holmen in the north to Vågsbunnen in the south. According to the Sagas, the city was founded within this area.

One of the earliest pier constructions has been dated to around 1100, and the existing buildings are of a much later date, with only Schøtstuene and some buildings towards Julehuset being originals from 1702.

Around 1350, a Kontor of the Hanseatic League was established in Bryggen. As the town developed into an important trading centre, the wharfs were improved and the buildings of Bryggen were gradually taken over by the Hanseatic merchants. The warehouses were used to store goods, particularly stockfish from northern Norway, and cereal from Europe.

In 1702, the buildings belonging to the Hanseatic League were damaged by fire. They were rebuilt, and some of these were later demolished, and some were destroyed by fire. In 1754, the operations of the office at Bryggen ended, when all the properties were transferred to Norwegian citizens.

Throughout history, Bergen has experienced many fires, since most of its houses were traditionally made from wood. This was also the case for Bryggen, and as of today around a quarter were built after 1702, when the older wharfside warehouses and administrative buildings burned down. The rest predominantly consists of younger structures, although there are some stone cellars that date back to the 15th century.

Parts of Bryggen were again destroyed in a fire in 1955. A thirteen-year archaeological excavation followed, revealing the day-to-day runic inscriptions known as the Bryggen inscriptions. The Bryggen museum was built in 1976 on part of the site cleared by the fire. 
==Architectural heritage==
Bryggen was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979, by Criterion (iii):
Notable houses at Bryggen include Bellgården (a 300-year-old building), Svensgården, Enhjørningsgården, Bredsgården, Bugården, Engelgården. The oldest and tallest building in the area is St Mary&#x27;s Church. Streets include Jacobsfjorden. Museums include Bryggens Museum and Hanseatic Museum and Schøtstuene.

<text>The United States No Electronic Theft Act (NET Act), a federal law passed in 1997, provides for criminal prosecution of individuals who engage in copyright infringement under certain circumstances, even when there is no monetary profit or commercial benefit from the infringement. Maximum penalties can be five years in prison with fines.

==History==
Prior to the enactment of the NET Act in 1997, criminal copyright infringement required that the infringement was for the purpose of &quot;commercial advantage or private financial gain.&quot; Merely uploading and downloading files on the internet did not fulfill this requirement, meaning that even large-scale online infringement could not be prosecuted criminally.

This state of affairs was underscored by the unsuccessful 1994 prosecution of David LaMacchia, then a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for allegedly facilitating massive copyright infringement as a hobby, without any commercial motive. The court&#x27;s dismissal of &quot;United States v. LaMacchia&quot; suggested that then-existing criminal law simply did not apply to non-commercial infringements (a state of affairs which became known as the &quot;LaMacchia Loophole&quot;). The court suggested that Congress could act to make some non-commercial infringements a crime, and Congress acted on that suggestion in the NET Act.

The NET Act amended the definition of &quot;commercial advantage or private financial gain&quot; to include the &quot;receipt, or expectation of receipt, of anything of value, including the receipt of other copyrighted works&quot; (17 USC 101), and specifies penalties of up to five years in prison.

In addition, it added a threshold for criminal liability where the infringer neither obtained nor expected to obtain anything of value for the infringement – &quot;by the reproduction or distribution, including by electronic means, during any 180-day period, of 1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or more copyrighted works, which have a total retail value of more than $ 1,000&quot; (17 USC 506(a)(1)(B)). In response to the NET Act, the US Sentencing Commission stiffened sanctions for intellectual property infringement.

<text>Marty Ralph Klein (born 1950) is an American sex therapist, author, educator and public policy analyst. Klein has spent his career supporting the healthy sexual expression of men, women and couples in a wide range of ways. He is critical of censorship, the concepts of sex addiction and porn addiction, as well as the anti-pornography movement. He believes that public policy relating to sexuality should be driven by scientific data rather than emotion, &quot;tradition&quot; or popular but untrue myths. He has been a participant in various state, federal and international court cases dealing with the First Amendment, obscenity, censorship and &quot;harmful to minors&quot; laws.

==Early life==

Klein grew up in Brooklyn, New York. While still in elementary school he began to play the recorder and to collect stamps, interests he has continued throughout his life. Collecting stamps led to a lifelong interest in geography and history. He later wrote on these topics frequently when he began to lecture and travel internationally.

After graduating from Stuyvesant High School in 1967 he attended Stony Brook University. There he developed a passion for sociology and went on to attend PhD programs in sociology at Indiana University and the University of California.

==Career==

Klein was trained in the doctoral programs of two different branches of sociology: the first was survey research, the use of statistical analysis to gather data about human behavior in order to understand, correlate and predict it; the second was ethnomethodology, which is the study of how people create meaning as a prelude to creating orderly social interactions and predictable social institutions.

First as a volunteer and then as a staff member, Klein worked for the Santa Barbara branch of Planned Parenthood (1976-1980). While there he became intrigued with the recurring experience of women returning for pregnancy tests multiple times despite being prescribed or given various types of contraception. These women&#x27;s explanations surprised him: they didn&#x27;t want to use birth control because they were afraid their partner would think they were a slut, or that they had actually planned to have sex with a stranger they&#x27;d just met at a bar.

Planned Parenthood then asked him to run a group for the male partners of women coming to the birth control clinic. He also received a grant from the state Office of Family Planning relating to male sexuality. His interest already piqued by his experiences at the clinic, he began his career in human sexuality.
==Sexuality==

===Views on sexuality in the media===

Klein has been outspoken about the way sexuality is discussed in media outlets. For example, a 2005 &quot;New York Times&quot; article on the phenomenon of self-help books about sexual positions, sex fantasies and increasingly edgy materials stated that the genre is big business, aimed at women and promoting the idea that &quot;It is a woman&#x27;s role to ensure that the couple&#x27;s sex life remains satisfying.&quot; Klein disagrees that the promises that these books make about improving sex with oral, anal and fetishistic techniques and information are not what most couples really need to make them happy. &quot;A book called &#x27;How to Get Your Wife to Hug You a Little Bit More&#x27; or &#x27;How to Get Your Husband to Slow Down and Caress Your Hair and Love Doing It,&#x27; now those are books that would change people&#x27;s lives,&quot; says Klein. Communication is the key to satisfying relationships; things like new positions or removing pornography from a home without your partner&#x27;s consent is generally not helpful. Klein told the &quot;Commonwealth Club&quot; that what most adults want out of sex is a combination of &quot;pleasure and closeness,&quot; and he encourages people to pay more attention to these, rather than to performance anxiety or how they look.

Klein has criticized the mass media for talking about sexuality in what he claims is an exploitative manner. He calls this the &quot;Oprah-ization&quot; factor, where talk shows like &quot;Oprah&quot; and &quot;Dr. Phil&quot; will, for example, put teen prostitutes on stage and talk about how awful it is. What they are really doing, according to Klein, is showing teen girls in skimpy clothing talking about sex, which results in voyeuristic viewers. &quot;If the American media really thought these stories were so terrible it wouldn&#x27;t give them so much air time ... The key message in American culture is that sex is dangerous. But sex isn&#x27;t dangerous, bad sexual decision making is dangerous.&quot; In an interview with Chip August for &quot;Personal Life Media&quot; Klein stated, &quot;I think Oprah has single-handedly launched the victim industry in this country,&quot; adding that society is now infantilizing women by saying that they are unable to make decisions for themselves, that they are tricked into drinking at parties, that they can&#x27;t control whether they get drunk or create circumstances of vulnerability. &quot;It&#x27;s demeaning to people to say that even though you&#x27;re an adult, we&#x27;re not going to hold you accountable for your own decision-making,&quot; he says.

===Views on pornography===

Klein has criticized as unproven the theory of &quot;secondary effects&quot;, which posits that people involved with various forms of commercial sexual expression (such as escorts, strip clubs or pornography) will inevitably get involved with other, non-sexual illegal activity such as burglary, vandalism, or assault. He states that there is no evidence for this, but the idea appeals intuitively to many people. Thus instead of looking at the actual causal factors of crime, they seek to ban pornography, strip clubs and other outlets to reduce it. On &quot;20/20&quot; Klein told host John Stossel that 150 years ago most people got married as soon as they reached puberty, which was about 14 or 15 years old. Now most Americans reach puberty around ages 10–12 but they delay marriage into their late 20s.&lt;ref name=&quot;20/20&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, Klein was a return guest on &quot;The Skeptics&#x27; Guide to the Universe&quot; talking about his book &quot;His Porn, Her Pain: Confronting America&#x27;s Porn Panic with Honest Talk about Sex&quot;. He explained that he wrote this book in response to Broadband internet making porn more available - and the accompanying increase in women complaining about their men viewing porn, as well as to help improve sexual literacy of both adults and minors. Host Steven Novella asked Klein if anti-pornography groups are trying to justify their opposition by citing health concerns or were just confused about the science. Klein responded that both are true. &quot;The junk science is there for anyone who wants to use it,&quot; he said, noting that the common claims that pornography leads to various social problems lack evidence to support them, as rates of sexual violence, divorce, teen pregnancy and child molestation have all gone down since Broadband pornography became common. He observed that couples that don&#x27;t have sex anymore are quicker to fight about pornography rather than have a meaningful conversation about problems in their sexual relationships. In addition, he explained that consumer products based on fantasy are mostly about what people want to see, not necessarily what they want to do or experience, as both men and woman fantasize about things they would not do even if given the chance.

===Views on children and sexuality===

In a 2012 interview with &quot;Your Tango&quot;, Klein stated that in America, children are raised to have negative feelings about sex and their sexuality. In Europe most beaches are clothing optional, yet in America nudity on beaches is a crime. Further, he has been critical of laws which make it risky for parents to take photos of their children in the bathtub, or for teenagers to take sexual photos of themselves for their own private use. In addition, he has spoken out against the way he sees teens being treated as a sexually repressed minority, such as the criminalization and punishment of teen &quot;sexting,&quot; and the deliberate withholding of sexual information and sexual health products from them.

In a 2015 &quot;New York Times&quot; interview, Klein was asked how best to talk to children about sex. He responded that it depends on the child, since a younger child will probably not notice the conversation, and older children will need additional information and it is best for parents to respond honestly in a way that reflects their values. A teenager will need to understand what is real and what is fictional entertainment. In all cases, Klein said, it is important to listen, remain calm and make sure the child knows they are not a bad person for having sex questions and that they can ask the parent anything.

Klein has also said that children are learning about sex despite &quot;anti-sex crusaders&quot; and other societal forces trying to keep it from them. It&#x27;s a parenting issue, Klein told NPR, when children are viewing something that is made for adults. Parents need to educate their children and increase their sexual literacy, so that they understand that what they are seeing on the Internet is fantasy.

==&quot;Sex addiction&quot;==

When the expression &quot;sex addiction&quot; was coined in the mid-1980s by Patrick Carnes, Klein began to lecture and write against this idea. Klein believed then - and continues to believe - that the concept of &quot;sex addiction&quot; is primarily a set of moralistic judgements dressed up as clinical theory. He has written that the concept is a simplistic explanation of poor sexual decision-making that demonizes sexuality. He says it ignores the roles of culture, religion and the psychological means of sex for individuals while portraying sexual desires as dangerous, often unhealthy and in need of strict control channeled into the one proper form of sexual expression. Klein has reservations that sex-addiction exists and believes that an addiction movement whose agenda is based on false assumptions is harmful to patients and to society, namely: that sexual desires are dangerous, controlling, and not healthy, and that there is only one way to express sexuality.

It is unknown, according to Klein, if the sex addiction movement realized that its ideas would become politically exploited. Regardless of their intentions, this is what activists, government and the media have done in order to discredit the profession of sexology. Issues such as culture, religion, age and disorders must be taken into account. He states that society needs to come up with &quot;sex-positive&quot; models of &quot;sexual health&quot;. These models should reflect good education for children as well as for adults, while being sensitive across different cultures. Klein&#x27;s concerns with the concept of sexual addiction are that it appears to lend scientific credibility to it and implies that &quot;sex is dangerous.&quot; Twelve-step programs for sex addiction are of limited value because they are typically self-referred for a problem that any lay person can diagnose. There is no serious evaluation, just &quot;Hello Joe, welcome to the group&quot;. Joe may suffer from other problems that will not be helped by a twelve-step program, and may in fact be made worse. Klein told NPR that the idea that going to strip clubs or &quot;watching porn movies can actually be addictive in the same way that heroin is addictive is just silly.&quot;

==Court cases==

Michigan passed a law in 1999 criminalizing the distribution of &quot;sexually explicit&quot; material on the Internet fearing it could fall into the hands of minors. Plaintiffs, which included Marty Klein, challenged the law arguing that it violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and it was ruled unconstitutional in June 2001.

In April 2000 Arizona Governor Jane Hull signed law H.B. 2428 which added the Internet to the &quot;harmful to minors&quot; statute. Plaintiffs including Klein sought to have the Internet removed, claiming the law was far too broad contrary to the First Amendment. After reaching the 9th Circuit in June 2002, the Court struck down the law as unconstitutional in &quot;American Civil Liberties Union v. Goddard&quot;.
In early 2010 an addition was proposed to Massachusetts Senate Bill 997 adding &quot;electronic media&quot; to traditional media in its &quot;harmful to minors&quot; law. This would have criminalized any material posted on the Internet that might be considered harmful if viewed by a minor. The plaintiffs argued that this could &quot;potentially ban constitutionally protected speech about art, literature, sexual health and other topics.&quot; The case was heard in October 2010, and in April 2011 the Bill was signed into law, but with the stipulation that it could only be enforced if the &quot;harmful material&quot; was knowingly distributed to a minor. Marty Klein was the only individual among the various institutional plaintiffs.

==Personal life==
Klein is an extensive traveler and maintains a travel blog for his various trips, including India (2007), Azerbaijan (2009), Viet Nam (2010), Ukraine (2010), China (2011), Brazil (2011), Poland (2012), Myanmar (2013), Italy (2014), Hong Kong (2015), Japan (2015) and Greece (2016). All the photos on his blog are his own.

==Awards==
Klein has been honored by the following professional associations: 
*American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors &amp; Therapists: 2007 Sexuality Book of the Year
*California Association of Marriage &amp; Family Therapists Literary Achievement
*Honorary Memberships : Croatian Society for Medical Hypnosis and the Slovenian Society for Hypnotherapy

==Select bibliography==

===Books===
Klein has authored seven books on sexuality. His book &quot;America&#x27;s War on Sex&quot; with a foreword by ACLU President Nadine Strosse was honored as 2006&#x27;s Best Sexuality Book by AASECT. It documents how the issue of sexual regulation is being used by the Religious Right to undermine secular democracy. Klein details what he describes as a well-coordinated, deeply funded war on sexuality which is being fought on many fronts. Klein explores what he sees as the U.S.&#x27;s deep-seated anxiety about sexuality and the lengths to which the U.S. government is willing to go to keep its citizens sexually repressed. Klein challenges American society&#x27;s (and psychotherapy&#x27;s) assumptions about sexuality; he is particularly critical of what he calls the &quot;Sexual Disaster Industry&quot; and the &quot;Oprah-ization&quot; of psychotherapy and medicine.

<doc id="685085" wikidata="Q735354" url="?curid=685085" title="Miguel Cabrera">
<text>José Miguel Cabrera Torres (born April 18, 1983) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball first baseman, third baseman, and designated hitter who played 21 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Florida Marlins and Detroit Tigers. Debuting in 2003, he was a two-time American League (AL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) award winner, a four-time AL batting champion, and a 12-time MLB All-Star. Although he primarily played in left and right field before 2006, he spent the majority of his major league career at first and third base. He claimed the 17th MLB Triple Crown in 2012, the first to do so in 45 seasons. Cabrera is one of three players in MLB history to have a career batting average above .300, 500 home runs, and 3,000 hits, joining Hank Aaron and Willie Mays. Cabrera is regarded as one of the greatest hitters of all time.

At 16 years old, Cabrera was signed by Tigres de Aragua of the Venezuelan Winter League, where recorded his first hit as a professional in December 1999. Cabrera was signed in 1999 as an amateur free agent by the Florida Marlins, and progressed through their minor league system. He made his MLB debut in mid-2003 at the age of 20, and contributed to the Marlins&#x27; World Series victory later that year. Over the next four seasons, Cabrera was a regular player for the Marlins before being traded to the Detroit Tigers before the 2008 season. 

In 2012, Cabrera became the first player since Carl Yastrzemski in 1967 to win the batting Triple Crown, leading the AL with a .330 batting average, 44 home runs, and 139 runs batted in (RBI), earning him the AL MVP award that year. In the first half of 2013, Cabrera was on pace to shatter his numbers from his prior Triple Crown season. He became the first player to ever reach 30 home runs and 90 RBIs before the all-star break and was on pace to bat .366 with 53 home runs and 167 RBIs at that time. However, injuries plagued much of the latter half of the season and both his performance and playing time were reduced as a result. Overall, Cabrera still improved on his previous year&#x27;s batting performance, including a career-high .348 batting average, and received his second consecutive AL MVP award.

Cabrera won four AL batting titles, including three in consecutive years (2011–2013), and batted over .300 in 11 different seasons. He hit 30 or more home runs in ten separate seasons and drove in over 100 runs in 12 separate seasons (including 11 consecutive seasons, 2004–2014). Cabrera is the all-time leader in career home runs and hits by a Venezuelan player, surpassing Andrés Galarraga and Omar Vizquel respectively. He joined the 500 home run club in 2021 and the 3,000 hit club in 2022; he was the seventh player in MLB history to reach both milestones. In international competition, he represented Venezuela at five World Baseball Classic tournaments from 2006 to 2023. Cabrera retired after the 2023 season and will continue working with the Tigers&#x27; organization as a special assistant to the president of baseball operations.

==Early life==
Cabrera was born in Maracay, Aragua State, Venezuela, to parents Miguel Cabrera and Gregoria Torres de Cabrera. Growing up, Cabrera showed interest in volleyball as well as baseball. From early on, he was guided by his maternal uncle, David Torres. At 14, he was enrolled in a baseball school in Cagua, so he could continue his studies while still playing ball.

Miguel was signed by the Marlins in 1999 as an amateur free agent and came up through their farm system, teaming with future major leaguers Adrián González and Dontrelle Willis.

He began his professional career in 2000 as a shortstop in the Gulf Coast League (GCL). After batting .260 with 10 doubles, two triples, and two home runs through 57 games for the GCL Marlins, Cabrera was promoted to Class-A ball where he finished the final eight games batting .250 with 6 RBIs for the New York–Penn League (NYPL) Blue Sox in Utica, New York. While playing that winter for the Tigres de Aragua in the Venezuelan Winter League, manager Bill Plummer moved Cabrera from shortstop to third base.

Heading into 2001, the Marlins bumped Cabrera up to the Low Class-A Kane County Cougars. He earned his way into the Futures Game during All-Star Weekend in Seattle, along with González. He ended the year batting .268 with 30 extra-base hits, 66 RBIs, and distinguished himself as having the strongest arm in the Midwest League.

Entering the following season, Cabrera was once again promoted, this time to the Jupiter Hammerheads of the High Class-A Florida State League. At the request of the Marlins coach Ozzie Guillén, Cabrera made the transition from shortstop to third base. By July, his average was at .277, and he led his team with 45 RBI earning himself a second trip to the Future&#x27;s game, where he collected two singles. He finished the season batting .278 with 43 doubles and 75 RBIs. Up to this point, he hit just nine homers in his 489 at-bats.

To begin the 2003 season, Cabrera earned another promotion to the Double-A Carolina Mudcats. There he again teamed up with Willis, the left-handed fireballer with whom he would join in the majors. In April, he hit .402, and by June his average stood at .365 with 10 homers and 59 RBIs before being called up to the majors.

==Major league career==

===Florida Marlins (2003–2007)===

====2003: Rookie year and World Series====
Cabrera made his major league debut on June 20, 2003, at 20 years old. Cabrera hit a walk-off home run in his first major league game against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, following Billy Parker in 1972 and Josh Bard in 2002 as the third player since 1900 to hit a game-winning home run in his big-league debut. Cabrera rapidly established himself, as his stellar play in July made him the Marlins&#x27; cleanup hitter. Cabrera&#x27;s postseason play helped propel Florida to the World Series title over the New York Yankees and landed him on the cover of &quot;ESPN The Magazine&quot; during the offseason. He finished fifth in the NL Rookie of the Year voting, as teammate Dontrelle Willis took home the award.

In the NLDS against the Giants, Cabrera hit .286 with three RBIs. After changing positions in the heat of the NLCS against the Chicago Cubs, he hit .333 with three homers and six RBIs, including clutch home runs in Game 1 and Game 7 that gave the Marlins crucial leads. In Game 4 of the 2003 World Series against the Yankees, Cabrera faced Roger Clemens for the first time in his career. In the first inning, Clemens threw a 92-mph fastball in the vicinity of Cabrera&#x27;s chin, causing Cabrera to turn and stare at Clemens. Later in the at-bat, Cabrera hit a pitch to deep right field for a two-run home run. The home run would give the Marlins an early 2–0 lead en route to a 4–3 Marlins victory that evened the series at two games apiece. Cabrera and the Marlins would go on to win the 2003 World Series in 6 games.

In his first season, Cabrera batted .268 (84-for-314), with 12 home runs, 62 RBIs, 39 runs, 21 doubles, and three triples in 87 games played and received NL Rookie of the Month honors for both July and September.

====2004: 1st All-Star Game====
On April 20, 2004, Cabrera recorded his 100th career hit, an RBI single in the seventh inning against Roberto Hernández. In 2004, Cabrera batted .294 with 33 home runs, 112 RBIs, 101 runs, 177 hits, a .366 on-base percentage, and a .512 slugging percentage from the third and fourth spots in the order, while playing in 160 games and earning his first All-Star appearance. Cabrera spent the entire 2004 season playing in the outfield and had 13 outfield assists. In 284 total fielding chances, he committed nine errors (tied for the most among NL outfielders) and made 262 putouts. Cabrera also appeared in his first career all-star game, as a reserve. Cabrera hit an RBI scoring forceout in the 8th inning to drive in Moisés Alou.

====2005====
In 2005, Cabrera finished second in the National League in hits with 198 and batted .323 with 33 home runs, 43 doubles, two triples, and 116 RBIs. He was voted to his second consecutive All-Star Game, along with teammates Paul Lo Duca and Willis, and won his first Silver Slugger Award. Cabrera&#x27;s 33 home runs made him the youngest player in Major League Baseball history with back-to-back 30-homer seasons, at 22 years, 143 days. Albert Pujols performed the feat at 22 years, 223 days. Cabrera ultimately would have four seasons with at least 100 runs batted in, which is the most among Marlin players in history, and he is the only one to have had consecutive 100-RBI seasons.

====2006====

On June 22, 2006, pitcher Todd Williams let the first pitch of an attempted intentional walk get too close to the plate and Cabrera reached out and singled it to right center field. The hit occurred during the 10th inning, scoring the winning run to give the Marlins a 6–5 lead over the Baltimore Orioles.

During a July 9, 7–6 road loss to the New York Mets, Cabrera became involved in an altercation with teammate Scott Olsen. With the Marlins trailing 2–0, Mets catcher Paul Lo Duca hit a hard grounder that glanced off Cabrera&#x27;s glove and rolled into left field, allowing a run to score as Lo Duca raced to second with a double. As they came off the field, Olsen could be seen shouting something at Cabrera. A moment later, television cameras showed Cabrera in the crowded dugout reaching past teammates to poke his finger at Olsen as the pitcher walked past him. Olsen tried to jab back at Cabrera, who charged Olsen and tried to kick the pitcher before the players were quickly separated by teammates. Cabrera was voted to represent the National League All-Stars for the third time in his career and made his first appearance in the Home Run Derby. Cabrera finished in third place with 15 home runs in the event.

With teammates Josh Willingham and Dan Uggla hitting behind and ahead of him respectively, Cabrera finished the year with a .339 batting average, 26 home runs, and 114 RBIs. He was selected for his third consecutive All-Star Game and won his second Silver Slugger Award. Cabrera battled the Pittsburgh Pirates&#x27; shortstop Freddy Sanchez for the National League batting crown until the last day of the regular season. Marlins manager Joe Girardi decided to bat Cabrera leadoff for the final game of the season to give him more chances to get a hit for the crown. He ended up finishing second to Sanchez. Cabrera also finished the 2006 campaign with a .568 slugging percentage and a .430 on-base percentage.

====2007====

On February 17, Cabrera became the first player of the 2007 offseason to win his arbitration hearing, obtaining a one-year contract worth $7.4 million.

Cabrera made his fourth consecutive All-Star game. He was initially scheduled to participate in the Home Run Derby during the All-Star weekend, but an injured left shoulder suffered a few days before the All-Star break, forced him out of the derby and limited him in the All-Star game to a pinch-hit at-bat against Dan Haren in which he struck out.

On September 4, Cabrera recorded his 500th RBI in the major leagues, making him the third-youngest player to accumulate 500 RBIs. Hall of Famers Mel Ott and Ted Williams were the only players to precede him in this feat. On September 15, 2007, in a game against the Colorado Rockies at Coors Field, Cabrera drove in at least 100 runs for the fourth consecutive year. His 100th RBI came in the first inning against Ubaldo Jiménez. Five innings later, Cabrera added four more RBIs when he hit a ball into the center field trees for his first career grand slam. He joined David Ortiz, Alex Rodriguez, Albert Pujols, Mark Teixeira, Bobby Abreu, and Vladimir Guerrero as the only players to reach the 100-RBI plateau in each of the four previous seasons.

In 2007, Cabrera won the NL Player of the Week twice (April 1–8 and June 4–10). He also passed former Marlins Gary Sheffield and Derrek Lee for second on the franchise home run list. Cabrera moved into third in all-time franchise RBIs and first in batting average. Cabrera ended the 2007 season with career highs in both home runs (34) and runs batted in (119) while hitting for a .320 average.

===Detroit Tigers (2008–2023)===

On December 5, 2007, the Marlins traded Cabrera and starting pitcher Dontrelle Willis to the Detroit Tigers for pitchers Andrew Miller, Dallas Trahern, Eulogio De La Cruz and Burke Badenhop, outfielder Cameron Maybin and catcher Mike Rabelo.

On March 22, 2008, Cabrera reached an agreement with the Tigers on an eight-year, $152.3 million contract extension. At the time, the deal was the fourth-largest in baseball history, behind those signed by Alex Rodriguez, Derek Jeter, and Manny Ramirez. The deal was also the largest in Tigers history at the time, surpassing the five-year, $75 million contract signed by Magglio Ordóñez in 2005 (it was later surpassed in 2012 when Prince Fielder signed a nine-year, $214 million deal) Cabrera earned $11.3 million in 2008 and was to receive an average of $20 million per year through 2015.

====2008====
Cabrera made his Tigers debut on March 31, 2008, playing third base in a home game against the Kansas City Royals. In his third at-bat, he hit a solo home run off Royals pitcher Gil Meche. He finished the game 1-for-5 with two strikeouts, and the Tigers lost 5–4 in 11 innings. On April 22, manager Jim Leyland announced that Cabrera would be moving to first base, with Carlos Guillén becoming the starting third baseman. Cabrera had already made seven appearances at first, the first appearances at the position of his career. Cabrera was named the AL Player of the Month for July after batting .330 with eight home runs and 31 RBIs. On September 7, Cabrera reached the 1,000-hit plateau on a home run off Twins pitcher Glen Perkins.

Cabrera finished the 2008 season with a career-high 37 home runs, which led the American League. He became the youngest AL home run champion since Troy Glaus in 2000. He also established a new career high in RBIs (127). He became one of only six players who had driven in at least 100 runs in each of the past five seasons, joining Alex Rodriguez, Albert Pujols, David Ortiz, Bobby Abreu, and Mark Teixeira.

====2009====
On Opening Day, Cabrera hit a grand slam to left-center that traveled more than at Comerica Park to help the Detroit Tigers to a 15–2 victory over the Texas Rangers. Cabrera finished the game 4-for-6 with six RBIs. On August 23, 2009, Cabrera hit his 200th career home run in a game against the Oakland A&#x27;s. He became only the fourth Venezuelan player to ever reach that plateau.

Across the 2009 season, Cabrera posted a .324 batting average, which was fourth in the AL. He also tied his career-high in hits with 198, which was also fourth among AL players. Cabrera also had 103 RBI on the season, making it the sixth straight year he attained the 100 RBI mark.

====2010====
On May 28, in a game against the Oakland Athletics in Detroit, Cabrera hit three home runs in a 5–4 Tigers loss. Two of the home runs came against starter Ben Sheets, and one against closer Andrew Bailey. It was the first three-home run game in Cabrera&#x27;s career and came in his first game returning to the team after his daughter&#x27;s birth.

Cabrera was named an AL All-Star for the first time since joining the American League, and the fifth time in his eight-year career. He was chosen to be the starter in place of Minnesota Twins star Justin Morneau, who had suffered a concussion against the Tigers on July 9. Cabrera also participated in the Home Run Derby, finishing fourth in the event with 12 home runs.

On September 26, in a game against the Cleveland Indians, Cabrera suffered a high ankle sprain while getting back to first base on a pick-off attempt. He initially tried to play, but the Tigers decided to shut him down for the remainder of the season. Cabrera ended the 2010 season with a .328 batting average, a career-high 38 home runs, and 126 RBIs. The lack of a strong #5 hitter to follow Cabrera in the Tigers&#x27; lineup also resulted in him drawing a career-high 89 walks, which included an AL-leading 32 intentional passes. On defense, Cabrera led all AL first basemen in errors, with 13.

In the 2010 AL MVP voting, Cabrera finished second to Josh Hamilton of the Texas Rangers.

====2011: First career batting title====
Cabrera was named to his second AL All-Star team as a reserve in 2011, his sixth All-Star Game appearance overall. On July 15, the first game after the All-Star break, Cabrera collected his 1,500th career hit, in a game against the Chicago White Sox. During the 2011 season, Cabrera hit for a .344 average, winning the AL batting title, while also leading the AL in on-base percentage (.448) and doubles (48). He had his eighth straight 100-RBI season (105) and fifth straight 30-HR season (30). He also reached a new career-high in walks with 108. On defense, Cabrera led all AL first basemen in errors, with 13.

Cabrera hit .429 with six home runs and 21 RBIs in September 2011, propelling the Tigers into the playoffs and eventually the American League Championship Series. In the 2011 ALCS, Cabrera hit .400 with four doubles, three home runs, and seven RBI, and posted a 1.606 OPS, but the Tigers fell to the Texas Rangers in six games.

Through 2011, he had the sixth-best career batting average of all active players (.317), and seventh-best slugging percentage (.555) and OPS (.950).

====2012: Triple Crown, first MVP season, and World Series====

In 2012, after the signing of first baseman Prince Fielder, the Tigers announced Cabrera would move back to third base. In a spring training game against the Philadelphia Phillies, Cabrera was struck below the right eye by a ground ball off the bat of Hunter Pence, which broke a bone. Despite this, after seeing the team&#x27;s orbital surgeon, Dr. Srinivas Iyengar, Cabrera believed he would be ready for opening day on April 5. He was, and was in the starting lineup on Opening Day.

On April 7, Cabrera and new teammate Fielder each hit two home runs against the Red Sox, including back-to-back homers in the fifth inning. That week, from April 4–8, Cabrera was named AL Player of the Week, his ninth time achieving that honor, five of them being with Detroit. Cabrera hit 5-for-11 in three games over that span with three home runs and eight RBI. On April 27, Cabrera collected his 1,000th RBI in a game against the Yankees. He was the sixth youngest player to reach the mark, with only Mel Ott, Jimmie Foxx, Alex Rodriguez, Ken Griffey Jr., and Lou Gehrig being younger.
Cabrera was named to the American League All-Star team as a reserve, as Rangers&#x27; third baseman Adrián Beltré was voted as the starter. This marked Cabrera&#x27;s third consecutive All-Star appearance as a member of the Tigers and seventh appearance overall. On July 22, he hit his 300th career home run off White Sox starter Philip Humber. This made him the second Venezuelan-born player to reach this milestone, joining Andrés Galarraga who hit 399.

On August 15, Cabrera became the first player in Detroit Tigers history to hit 30 home runs in five consecutive seasons, passing Hank Greenberg (1937–40) and Cecil Fielder (1990–93), who each had four consecutive 30 home run seasons. This also marked the eighth time in the last nine seasons overall that Cabrera had reached the 30 home run mark. Cabrera was voted the American League Player of the Month for August after batting .357 with six doubles, eight home runs, 24 RBI, 19 runs scored, and 12 walks in 26 games. This was the second time that Cabrera was named player of the month for the Tigers as he joined Alan Trammell as the only Tigers to win the award more than once.

Cabrera won the Triple Crown, finishing the season with an AL-leading .330 batting average, plus 44 home runs and 139 RBIs which led all of Major League Baseball. He became the first batter to win a Triple Crown since Carl Yastrzemski in 1967. Cabrera became the first non-outfielder to win the Triple Crown since Lou Gehrig in 1934, the first player to win it without a tie in any of the three categories since Frank Robinson in 1966, and the first Latin American player and the first third baseman to win a Triple Crown. Cabrera also had his first career 200-hit season, having hit safely 205 times. He was named &quot;The Sporting News&quot; Player of the Year. On October 27, 2012 he was awarded the AL Hank Aaron Award. Cabrera also led the AL in slugging (.606), OPS (.999), total bases (377), and led the majors in hitting into double plays (28).

In Game 4 of the 2012 World Series, Cabrera hit his first World Series home run since his rookie year with the Marlins in 2003, putting Detroit on the board for the first time in two games. During the bottom of the 10th inning, Cabrera was the final out of the World Series as he struck out looking, completing the San Francisco Giants&#x27; sweep of the Tigers.

On November 15, Cabrera was named the AL&#x27;s Most Valuable Player over Mike Trout of the Los Angeles Angels, receiving 22 out of 28 first-place votes and 362 points from a panel of Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America.

====2013: Second MVP season====
Baseball Hall of Famer Al Kaline was quoted in 2013 as saying that Cabrera&#x27;s performance was &quot;unbelievable&quot;, and that Cabrera was &quot;already qualified for Cooperstown.&quot; Bob Nightengale of USA Today Sports called Cabrera &quot;the greatest player in the game of baseball.&quot; Barry Bonds agreed with Nightengale&#x27;s analysis, adding &quot;He&#x27;s the best. By far. Without a doubt. The absolute best.&quot;

Cabrera continued a torrid pace into the 2013 season, being named American League Player of the Month for May. Cabrera batted .379 (44-for-116) with nine doubles, 12 home runs, 33 RBIs, 23 runs scored, and 15 walks in 28 games to claim his third career Player of the Month Award. Cabrera previously won top player honors in July 2008 and August 2012. The week of August 5–11, Cabrera was named the American League Co-Player of the Week, with fellow Tigers teammate Austin Jackson. Cabrera batted .429 (12-for-28) with two doubles, four home runs, 11 RBIs, and seven runs scored over seven games, to win his 10th career player of the week award.

As of the 2013 All-Star break, Cabrera was hitting .365 with 30 home runs and a league-leading 95 RBIs, considerably ahead of the pace he set during his 2012 Triple Crown season at the same point. Cabrera became the first player in MLB history to have at least 30 home runs and 90 RBIs before the All-Star break. Cabrera was voted in as the starter at third base for the first time in the fan balloting for the 2013 Major League All-Star Game. Cabrera won the ESPY Award in 2013 for Best MLB Player. On July 9, 2013, he hit his 350th career home run, against the Chicago White Sox.

On August 18, Cabrera hit his 40th home run of the season in a game against the Kansas City Royals, joining Babe Ruth and Jimmie Foxx as the only MLB players in history to have at least 40 home runs, 120 RBIs and a batting average of .350 or higher through 116 games. Cabrera also became the third Tigers player in history to hit 40 or more home runs in consecutive seasons, joining Hank Greenberg (1937–38) and Cecil Fielder (1990–91). Cabrera was named the American League Player of the Month for August. Cabrera batted .356 (36-for-101) with five doubles, 11 home runs, 31 RBIs, 17 runs scored, and 13 walks in 27 games to claim his fourth career Player of the Month Award and his second of the 2013 season, after claiming the award for May.

Following the All-Star Break, Cabrera suffered injuries including a groin strain that limited his playing time later in the season. Cabrera finished the regular season with a .348 batting average, and won his third straight AL batting title. Cabrera became the first Tiger to win three consecutive batting titles since Ty Cobb (1917–1919), the first American Leaguer to win at least three straight since Wade Boggs (1985–88), and the first right-handed batter in either league to win three straight batting titles since Rogers Hornsby (1920–25). He also led the AL in on-base percentage (.442), slugging percentage (.636), OPS (1.078) and OPS+ (190). He finished second in the league in home runs (44), RBIs (137), and runs scored (103), and was third in walks (90).

On October 24, Cabrera was honored with his second consecutive &quot;Sporting News&quot; MLB Player of the Year Award. He was the fourth player in history to win this award in back-to-back seasons, joining Ted Williams (1941–42), Joe Morgan (1975–76), and Albert Pujols (2008–09).

On November 14, Cabrera won his second consecutive American League MVP Award, receiving 23 out of 30 first-place votes and 385 points. Cabrera became the first American League player to win back-to-back MVP awards since Frank Thomas of the Chicago White Sox (1993–1994). He was the third Tiger player to win the MVP award more than once, joining Hank Greenberg (1935, 1940) and Hal Newhouser (1944–45).

====2014: Contract extension====
With the departure of Prince Fielder via trade, the Tigers announced that Cabrera would return to first base for the 2014 season.

On March 28, 2014, the Tigers announced that Cabrera had signed an eight-year contract extension worth $248 million. Combined with the $44 million the Tigers owed on the remaining two years of Miguel&#x27;s then-current contract, the total 10-year commitment was worth $292 million. The deal broke the previous record commitment of $275 million the New York Yankees tendered to Alex Rodriguez in 2007. Cabrera&#x27;s contract has since been surpassed by Giancarlo Stanton&#x27;s 13-year, $325 million contract in 2014, the largest contract in baseball. Many analysts criticized the contract as excessive and short-sighted, with &quot;The Washington Post&quot; calling it &quot;the worst.&quot;

On April 4, in a game against the Baltimore Orioles, Cabrera hit a two-run home run to notch his 2,000th career hit, becoming the ninth player to reach 2,000 hits before his 31st birthday and the seventh-youngest to reach the mark. On July 6, it was announced that Cabrera had won the fan voting to start at first base for the American League at the 2014 All-Star Game. This was his ninth All-Star selection overall, and second straight as a starter. In the first inning of the All-Star game, Cabrera hit a 2-run home run off National League starting pitcher Adam Wainwright. It was his first career All-Star game home run.

Cabrera won the ESPY Award for Best MLB Player for the second year in a row in 2014. On September 7, Cabrera recorded his 100th RBI of the season, reaching the milestone for the 11th consecutive season. Cabrera was the fifth player in major league history to accomplish this feat, joining Lou Gehrig (13 seasons), Jimmie Foxx (13 seasons), Alex Rodriguez (13 seasons), and Al Simmons (11 seasons).

Cabrera was named the AL Co-Player of the Week for the week of September 1–7. Cabrera batted .500 (15-for-30) with two doubles, five home runs, nine RBI, and eight runs scored in seven games to win his 11th career Player of the Week award. He led the major league in hits, home runs, total bases (32), slugging percentage (1.067), tied for first overall in runs scored, and tied for second in RBI.

Cabrera was named the American League Player of the Month for September. Cabrera batted .379 (39-for-103) with 10 doubles, eight home runs, 18 RBI, 39 hits, and 19 runs scored in 26 games to claim his fifth career Player of the Month Award and help the Tigers secure their fourth straight AL Central Division title by one game over the Kansas City Royals. Cabrera led the league with a .737 slugging percentage and a 1.118 OPS in September.

Cabrera finished the regular season with a .313 batting average, 25 home runs, 109 RBI, and a league-leading 52 doubles; he led both leagues with 11 sacrifice flies. Along with Matt Holliday in 2014, Cabrera attained at least 20 home runs, 30 doubles, 75 RBI, and 80 runs scored each for the ninth consecutive season, becoming the fourth player in MLB history to do so. The others were Stan Musial, Manny Ramirez, and Pujols, all with ten consecutive seasons.

On October 23, Cabrera was announced as a finalist for the American League Gold Glove Award for first base. This marked the first time he was nominated for the accolade. The other two nominees for the award were Albert Pujols and the defending Gold Glove winner Eric Hosmer, with Hosmer eventually winning the award for 2014 as well.

On October 24, Cabrera underwent surgery to remove a bone spur in his right ankle that had been bothering him for several months. He also had a procedure to repair a stress fracture in the navicular bone near the top of his right foot. Doctors knew about the bone spurs, but said the discovery of the broken bone was a surprise. Cabrera himself said he wasn&#x27;t surprised, stating, &quot;I was feeling a lot of pain. I knew something was wrong.&quot; He said he had to alter his swing mechanics during the last half of the 2014 season, being unable to put weight on his back foot without pain.

====2015: Fourth AL batting title====
Cabrera was named the AL player of the week for the week of April 5–12. Cabrera batted .520 (13-for-25) with two doubles, two home runs, eight RBIs, and four runs scored over six Tigers victories to win his 13th career Player of the Week award. He led the league in total bases (21), hits (13), and on-base percentage (.586), was tied for first in RBIs, and was second in batting average and slugging percentage (.840). He finished the week by registering back-to-back four-hit games for the first time in his career.

On May 16, 2015, Cabrera hit his 400th career home run, against Tyler Lyons of the St. Louis Cardinals, making him the all-time leader in home runs among Venezuelan-born players, surpassing the previous record holder, Andrés Galarraga. At the age of 32 years, 28 days, he became the third-youngest active player to reach this milestone, behind Albert Pujols (30 years, 222 days) and Alex Rodriguez (29 years, 316 days), and the eighth-youngest in history. On May 21, Cabrera recorded his 1,400th career RBI. At the age of 32 years, 33 days, he was the fifth-youngest player to reach the milestone.

On July 4, Cabrera was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a Grade 3 left calf strain, including tearing of muscle fibers. This marked the first time Cabrera had been placed on the DL in his 13-year career. At the time of the injury, Cabrera was leading the league in batting average (.350), on-base percentage (.456), and OPS (1.034). He had 16 doubles, 15 home runs, and 54 RBIs through 77 games.

On July 5, it was announced that Cabrera had won the fan voting to start at first base for the American League at the 2015 All-Star Game; however, he was unable to play due to injury. This was the sixth consecutive season that Cabrera had been named an All-Star and the 10th time in his career. Cabrera was recalled from the disabled list on August 14. On August 16, he recorded his 1,426th career RBI to surpass Galarraga for the most RBIs by a Venezuelan-born player.

Although Cabrera had only 18 home runs and 76 RBI in 2015, snapping his streak of 11 consecutive seasons with at least 25 home runs and 100 RBIs, his .338 batting average led the major leagues and earned him his fourth AL batting title in the last five years. He was the seventh player in history to win at least four AL batting titles, following Ty Cobb, Harry Heilmann, Wade Boggs, Rod Carew, Ted Williams, and Nap Lajoie, and only the second right-handed batter in the live-ball era (since 1920) to do so, joining Heilmann. He also led the American League with a .440 on-base percentage, and ranked second in the league with a .974 OPS. He led all MLB hitters (140 or more plate appearances) in batting average against right-handers, at .344. Because of the injury-shortened season, Cabrera also saw his streak of 11 consecutive seasons with at least 300 total bases end. The streak ranks fourth in the MLB live-ball era, behind Lou Gehrig (13), Willie Mays (13) and Albert Pujols (12).

Cabrera won his sixth Silver Slugger award, and second at first base, becoming the 18th player to win at least six Silver Slugger Awards. Cabrera joined Alex Rodriguez as the only players with multiple Silver Slugger Awards at different infield positions.

====2016====
Cabrera was named the American League Co-Player of the Week, along with fellow Tigers teammate Cameron Maybin, for the week of May 16–22. Cabrera batted .500/.538/1.000 with three home runs and six RBIs during that time, to win his 14th career player of the week award. On May 23, Cabrera hit his 500th career double, becoming the 62nd player all time to reach the milestone. On June 12, Cabrera recorded his 2,400th career hit in his 2,000th career game, becoming the fifth-youngest player in MLB history to reach the milestone, at 33 years, 55 days old.

On June 28, Cabrera hit a home run off his former team, the Miami Marlins, giving him the distinction of hitting a home run against all 30 Major League teams during his career. On July 5, Cabrera was named to his 11th All-Star team, as a reserve at first base for the American League. On July 22, Cabrera recorded his 1,500th career RBI, becoming the 56th player in major league history to reach the milestone. Cabrera reached 1,500 RBI with 400+ home runs faster than anyone in Major League history. He was one of six active players with at least 400 home runs and 1,500 RBI, and was more than two years younger than any of the other five. On August 18, Cabrera recorded his 1,000th RBI as a member of the Tigers.

On September 5, Cabrera hit his 30th home run of the season and his 300th home run as a Tiger. He joined Al Kaline (399), Norm Cash (373), and Hank Greenberg (306) as the only four players to hit 300+ home runs in a Tiger uniform. On September 18, Cabrera recorded his 2,500th career hit, off the Indians&#x27; Trevor Bauer, becoming the 100th player in Major League history to reach the milestone, and the eighth player to do so by his age-33 season. He was the fourth-youngest (33 years, 181 days) to reach 2,500 hits, following Ty Cobb, Rogers Hornsby, and Hank Aaron.

Cabrera was named the American League Player of the Week for the week of September 26 – October 2. Cabrera batted .565 (13-for-23) with six runs scored, a double, four home runs, and 13 RBI over six games. Cabrera finished the period first in hits, RBI, batting average, slugging percentage (1.130), and on-base percentage (.583), second in home runs and total bases (26), and tied for third in runs scored in the American League. This marked Cabrera&#x27;s 15th weekly honor, tying him with Barry Bonds for the second-most all-time. Cabrera was named the American League Player of the Month from September 1 to October 2. Cabrera batted .347 (34-for-98) with 20 runs scored, four doubles, 10 home runs, and 27 RBI over 26 games to claim his sixth career Player of the Month Award. Among American League leaders in September with a minimum of 80 at-bats, Cabrera finished second in slugging percentage (.694), tied for second in home runs, and RBI, third in on-base percentage (.443), fourth in batting average, and tied for fourth in hits and runs scored.

Cabrera finished the 2016 season with a .316 batting average, 38 home runs, 31 doubles, and 108 RBI. He finished tied for first in the AL with David Ortiz for the most intentional walks with 15, and for the second time in his career led the majors by hitting into 26 double plays.

Cabrera won the 2016 AL Silver Slugger Award for first basemen, his seventh Silver Slugger Award overall, and third award at first base. He was one of 14 Major League players to have won seven or more Silver Slugger awards since the award was introduced in 1980.

====2017====
Back ailments and stiffness plagued Cabrera throughout the 2017 season, beginning with the World Baseball Classic. On April 22, he was placed on the 10-day disabled list due to a right groin strain. He was activated on May 2 and hit his 450th career home run that night. On June 2, Cabrera recorded his 1,000th career extra-base hit, becoming the 39th player in Major League history to reach the milestone. On July 20, Cabrera recorded his 1,600th career RBI, becoming the 36th player in Major League history to reach the milestone. He left the August 12 game versus the Twins due to lower back stiffness, and missed the next two games.

On August 24, Cabrera got into an altercation with Yankees catcher, and future teammate, Austin Romine at home plate, triggering a bench-clearing brawl. Both players were ejected. On August 25, Cabrera was suspended seven games for his role in the brawl. He started serving his suspension on September 2 after it was reduced to six games on appeal.

On September 24, Cabrera was diagnosed with two herniated discs in his back, a condition that he likely played through the entire season. Manager Brad Ausmus and the Tigers did not think the issue would require offseason surgery. Cabrera finished 2017 with a career-low .249 batting average and a career-low .399 slugging percentage while hitting 16 home runs and driving in 60 runs in 130 games.

====2018====
On May 4, 2018, Cabrera was placed on the 10-day disabled list due to a right hamstring strain. On June 12, Cabrera suffered a left biceps injury after swinging and immediately left the game. He suffered a rupture in his left biceps tendon, requiring surgery and putting him out of action for the remainder of the 2018 season. He finished the 2018 season with a .299 batting average, three home runs, and 22 RBIs in 38 games.

====2019====
Cabrera struggled with knee issues in 2019, which had the Tigers moving him into a full-time designated hitter role by early June. He hit .282 for the year with 12 home runs and 59 RBI in 139 games. His .398 slugging percentage was the lowest of his career.

====2020====
On August 29, 2020, Cabrera collected three hits in a doubleheader against the Minnesota Twins passing former Tiger Charlie Gehringer for 50th on the all-time MLB hits list with 2,841. This made Cabrera one of only 16 major league players to place in the top 50 all-time for hits, home runs and RBIs. On August 30 against the Twins, Cabrera recorded his 2,000th career hit as a Tiger, becoming the eighth Tiger player to reach the milestone.

For the shortened 2020 season, Cabrera hit .250 (the second-lowest batting average of his career)/.329/.417 with a team-leading 10 home runs and 35 RBI in 57 games. Through season&#x27;s end, he ranked 23rd all-time in doubles (581), 23rd in total bases (4,942), 24th in RBIs (1,729), 30th in home runs (487), and tied for 46th in hits (2,866). He had the slowest sprint speed of all major league DHs, at 23.2 feet per second.

====2021: 500th career home run====
On April 1, 2021, with a home run in his first at-bat of the 2021 season, Cabrera became the second Tigers player to record 350 home runs and 2,000 hits with the team, following Al Kaline. On April 11, Cabrera was placed on the 10-day injured list with a left biceps strain. He was activated off the injured list and returned to game action on April 25. In a May 12 game against the Kansas City Royals, Cabrera surpassed Omar Vizquel for the most career hits by a Venezuelan-born player (2,878). On June 1, Cabrera recorded his 400th career double with the Tigers, becoming the eighth Tiger in franchise history to reach the milestone. Cabrera&#x27;s 585th career double on June 15 moved him into the all-time MLB top 20 (tied with Rafael Palmeiro).

After posting a sub-.200 batting average through the first two months of the 2021 season, Cabrera batted .329 (28-for-85) in June. It was his first full month batting over .300 since June 2019.

On August 22, Cabrera hit his 500th career home run in the 6th inning off of Steven Matz of the Toronto Blue Jays, becoming the 28th player in Major League history to reach the milestone, and the first player to do so as a Tiger. Among members of the 500 home run club, Cabrera currently has the fifth highest career batting average, behind Ted Williams (.344), Babe Ruth (.342), Jimmie Foxx (.325) and Manny Ramirez (.312). Shortly after the August 22 game, the Tigers announced they would schedule a &quot;Miggy Celebration Day&quot; at Comerica Park for September 24. Despite playing his home games in two notoriously stingy home run stadiums (Joe Robbie Stadium in Miami and Comerica Park in Detroit), Cabrera&#x27;s home/road splits for his first 500 home runs are nearly identical (248 at home, 252 on the road).

On September 7 against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Cabrera passed Ichiro Suzuki for the most career hits in MLB interleague play with 369. Cabrera had two more hits in that game, then went 4-for-4 against the Pirates the next night, increasing his interleague hit total to 375. Cabrera began the next Tigers game against the Tampa Bay Rays on September 10 with two more hits, giving him nine consecutive plate appearances with a hit. This marks the longest streak by a Tiger since Walt Dropo had hits in 12 straight plate appearances in 1952 (tying the MLB record), and the longest streak by any major league player age 38 or older since Ty Cobb in 1925.

On September 20, Cabrera recorded his 1,800th career RBI, becoming the 20th player in history to reach the milestone on the official MLB list. (Cabrera ranks 22nd on the Baseball Reference list, which recognizes RBI before it became an official statistic in 1920.)

With three hits and four RBIs against the Kansas City Royals on September 25, Cabrera tied Hank Aaron with his 81st career game of 3+ hits and 3+ RBI. Only Lou Gehrig (97), Al Simmons (94), and Babe Ruth (87) had more.

Cabrera finished the 2021 season with a .256 batting average, 15 home runs, and 75 RBIs while posting career lows in on-base percentage (.316), slugging percentage (.386), and OPS (.701). In 2021, he had the slowest sprint speed of all major league designated hitters, at 23.9 feet/second. At season&#x27;s end, he was tied with Sam Rice for 33rd on the all-time MLB hits list with 2,987. He now ranked 28th in career home runs (502), 18th in career doubles (597), 21st in career extra-base hits (1,116), and 18th in career total bases (5,124).

====2022: 3,000th career hit====
On April 23, 2022, Cabrera recorded his 3,000th career hit against Antonio Senzatela of the Colorado Rockies, an opposite-field single in the bottom of the first inning. He became the 33rd player in MLB history to join the 3,000-hit club, and the seventh player in MLB history to record 500 home runs and 3,000 hits, joining Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, Albert Pujols, Eddie Murray, Rafael Palmeiro, and Alex Rodriguez.

On May 7, Cabrera recorded his 600th career double, becoming the third player in MLB history to record 3,000 hits, 600 doubles, and 500 home runs, following Hank Aaron and Albert Pujols. He is also the first player in MLB history to record 3,000 hits, 600 doubles, 500 homers, and at least 1 Triple Crown. On June 28, Cabrera had two hits to move past Rickey Henderson into the Top 25 on the all-time MLB hits list (3,056). On July 8, Cabrera was named to the 2022 MLB All-Star Game as an honorary selection along with Albert Pujols by commissioner Rob Manfred, who was allowed to do so after the 2022 Collective Bargaining Agreement. In his only All-Star game plate appearance, Cabrera grounded out to shortstop. On July 25, Cabrera hit a solo home run for his 1,840th RBI, moving him into the Top 15 on the all-time list.

After being relegated to part-time duty in August, Cabrera was placed on the 10-day injured list on September 3 with a left biceps strain. He returned to the Tigers lineup on September 19. For the 2022 season, Cabrera hit .254 with 5 home runs and 43 RBI in 397 at-bats. At season&#x27;s end, he ranks in the all-time top 25 in several hitting categories: hits (3,088; 24th), doubles (607; 14th), RBI (1,847; 14th), extra-base hits (1,131; 16th) and total bases (5,250; 16th). He also moved up to 27th all-time in home runs (507).

In November 2022, Cabrera announced that he would likely retire after the 2023 season, his final contracted year with the Tigers.

====2023: Final season====

At spring training in February 2023, Cabrera confirmed that he planned to retire following the season. He stated he would like to remain with the Tigers organization, in a capacity where he could help younger players. On May 16, Cabrera became just the eighth player in Tigers history to play in 2,000 regular season games with the team, joining Sam Crawford, Ty Cobb, Charlie Gehringer, Al Kaline, Norm Cash, Lou Whitaker, and Alan Trammell.

On August 8 against the Minnesota Twins, Cabrera had two hits to surpass Tony Gwynn and move into the top 20 on the all-time MLB hits list. On September 27, Cabrera hit his 511th home run to move into the top 25 on the all-time MLB list (tied with Mel Ott). The homer also tied him with Norm Cash for the second-most home runs as a Tiger (373), behind only Al Kaline (399).

In his final major league inning, Cabrera was moved from his DH spot to first base and made an unassisted putout on a ground ball hit to him by the first batter of the inning. He was then removed from the game, making the putout the final statistic in his major league career. In his final season, Cabrera batted .257 with 20 doubles, 4 home runs, and 34 RBI in 98 games.

Cabrera finished his career with a .306 average, 3,174 hits (16th), 511 home runs (tied for 25th), 627 doubles (13th), 1,881 RBIs (12th), 1,258 walks, 1,551 runs, 103 sacrifice flies (tied for 25th), and a .900 OPS. He also ranked in the top 25 in MLB history with 11,796 plate appearances (23rd), 10,356 at-bats (22nd), 2,797 games (25th), 5,368 total bases (14th), 1,155 extra-base hits (14th), and 897 multi-hit games (17th). He retired as one of only two players in MLB history (with Hank Aaron) to reach 3,000 hits, 500 home runs, and 600 doubles while posting a career batting average over .300.

In 55 postseason games, Cabrera batted .278 (57-for-205) with 29 runs, 10 doubles, 13 home runs, 38 RBI, 27 walks, .368 on-base percentage and .517 slugging percentage.

==International career==
Cabrera represented the Venezuela national baseball team in international competition. Before the 2006 MLB season, Cabrera represented Venezuela in the inaugural World Baseball Classic; the Venezuelan team finished seventh in the tournament. 

Cabrera was selected to play for Venezuela at the 2009 World Baseball Classic, along with Tigers teammates Magglio Ordóñez, Carlos Guillén, and Armando Galarraga.

He also played at the 2013, 2017, and 2023 World Baseball Classic tournaments.

==Post-playing career==
On September 29, 2023, two days before the end of the regular season, the Tigers announced Cabrera would remain a member of the organization as a special assistant to the president of baseball operations, Scott Harris.

==Personal life==
Cabrera is very active in the community, and in 2012, he began The Miguel Cabrera Foundation to help a variety of children&#x27;s funds. He also uses his foundation to encourage young kids to play baseball and softball. In 2012 and 2013, Cabrera was nominated by his team for the Roberto Clemente Award, honoring the MLB player who best represents baseball on and off the field.

Cabrera is both a Catholic and a practitioner of Santería. He became a babalawo in the 2006 offseason. His wife is named Rosangel, and they have two daughters and one son. Cabrera&#x27;s wife filed for divorce in April 2017, but later changed her mind. Cabrera also has two other children, whom he fathered with an ex-mistress, a boy and a girl (who in January 2019 were six and three years old), who lived in Orlando, Florida.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Cabrera featured in a Spanish-language rap single with Venezuelan actor and musician Carlos Madera, known professionally as Sibilino. The song was titled &quot;Miggy al Bate&quot;, which translates to &quot;Miggy at Bat&quot; in English.

===Outcry on Venezuelan Crisis===
After maintaining a discreet stance concerning the escalating crisis in his homeland, Cabrera took a hard swing at Venezuela&#x27;s government, expressing exhaustion over the constant fear for his family&#x27;s safety and the financial extortion to safeguard them from violence. On a video shared to his Instagram on the first day of the All-Star break, Cabrera articulated his dismay, &quot;I am tired of hearing that they are going to kidnap my mother, and I don&#x27;t know whether it is a policeman or a bad guy, I don&#x27;t know who they are. All I know is if I don&#x27;t pay, those people disappear.&quot; The remarks, initially made in Spanish, were among many from a series of videos posted on the social media platform, later translated to English by a Spanish translator for the Free Press.

His comments highlight the dire economic condition in Venezuela and his wish to catalyze change in his motherland. Although previously advised against political engagements, Cabrera now believes it&#x27;s imperative to intervene as the nation, in his words, has been &quot;kidnapped&quot;. He also voiced the threats directed at him and pleaded for his family&#x27;s safety: &quot;Please, do not hurt my family. I am begging you.&quot;

Cabrera, without labeling himself as a rebel, emphasized his support towards improving the living conditions in Venezuela. He further dismissed accusations of being financially influenced by individuals in the U.S. to criticize Venezuela. He also responded to criticisms of his alleged inadequacy in aiding the Venezuelan people, defending his efforts and millionaire status by recounting his contributions like sending medicine and food, and calling for elections in Venezuela.

Cabrera&#x27;s public outcry for change followed a tragic event 13 years prior, when Ugueth Urbina, another Venezuelan Tiger, faced a horrifying ordeal as his mother was kidnapped and held for a $6 million ransom. Cabrera&#x27;s outspoken stance, alongside other Venezuelan Major League Baseball players, reflects a growing discontent and concern over the political and humanitarian quagmire gripping Venezuela, which has seen at least 75 individuals lose their lives due to civil unrest triggered by the presidency of Nicolas Maduro, whose administration is blamed for the nation&#x27;s triple-digit inflation, profound food and medical scarcities, and escalating crime rates.

As one of Venezuela&#x27;s most celebrated baseball icons, Cabrera&#x27;s vocalizations on the crisis portray a notable shift, encapsulating a desperate plea for intervention and restoration of normalcy in a nation beleaguered by political and social turmoil.

===Legal matters===
In the early morning of October 3, 2009, police were called to the Cabrera home and took him in for questioning. Cabrera had come home at 6:00 a.m., after a night of drinking at the nearby Townsend Hotel, and got into an argument with his wife. He was seen later that day at a game at Comerica Park, with scratches on his face. Cabrera told reporters that the scratches came from his dog, and refused to discuss the matter further. It was later reported he had a blood alcohol level of .26 when tested.

On January 21, 2010, it was reported that Cabrera spent three months in an alcohol abuse treatment center to help him recover from his addiction. He said at the time he had not consumed any alcohol since he was taken into custody in October 2009, and that he would continue his treatment into spring training and the regular season.

Cabrera was arrested in Florida on suspicion of drunken driving and resisting arrest on February 16, 2011. The matter was settled on a &quot;no contest&quot; plea to Driving Under the Influence with the resisting charge dropped, and he was sentenced without additional jail time.

In 2018, Cabrera was in a Florida court litigating a case brought against him in August 2017 by his former mistress, Belkis Mariella Rodriguez, over a dispute regarding how much child support Cabrera should pay Rodriguez for two children they had together. She argued that given his $30 million annual salary, she was entitled to $100,000 a month. Cabrera had been paying Rodriguez $20,000 a month in child support without any court order, but cut the amount by $5,000 in the summer of 2017. In December 2018 the Orange County Circuit Court ordered Cabrera to pay $20,000 a month in child support to the ex-mistress, additional expenses, and her attorneys&#x27; fees.

<text>Bernhard Schlink (; born 6 July 1944) is a German lawyer, academic, and novelist. He is best known for his novel &quot;The Reader&quot;, which was first published in 1995 and became an international bestseller. He won the 2014 Park Kyong-ni Prize.

==Early life==
He was born in Großdornberg, near Bielefeld, to a German father (Edmund Schlink) and a Swiss mother, the youngest of four children. His mother, Irmgard, had been a theology student of his father, whom she married in 1938. (Edmund Schlink&#x27;s first wife had died in 1936.) Bernhard&#x27;s father had been a seminary professor and pastor in the anti-Nazi Confessing Church. In 1946, he became a professor of dogmatic and ecumenical theology at Heidelberg University, where he would serve until his retirement in 1971. Over the course of four decades, Edmund Schlink became one of the most famous and influential Lutheran theologians in the world and a key participant in the modern Ecumenical Movement. Bernhard Schlink was brought up in Heidelberg from the age of two. He studied law at West Berlin&#x27;s Free University, graduating in 1968.

Schlink became a judge at the Constitutional Court of the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia in 1988 and in 1992 a professor for public law and the philosophy of law at Humboldt University, Berlin. Among Schlink&#x27;s academic students are Stefan Korioth and Ralf Poscher. He retired in January 2006.

==Career==
Schlink studied law at the University of Heidelberg and at the Free University of Berlin. He worked as a scientific assistant at the Universities of Darmstadt, Bielefeld and Freiburg. He had been a law professor at the University of Bonn and Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main before he started in 1992 at Humboldt University of Berlin. His career as a writer began with several detective novels with the main character named Selb—a play on the German word for &quot;self&quot;—(the first, &quot;Self&#x27;s Punishment&quot;, co-written with being available in the UK). One of these, &quot;Die gordische Schleife&quot;, won the in 1989.

In 1995, he published &quot;The Reader&quot; (&quot;Der Vorleser&quot;), a novel about a teenager who has an affair with a woman in her thirties who suddenly vanishes but whom he meets again as a law student when visiting a trial about war crimes. The book became a bestseller both in Germany and the United States and was translated into 39 languages. It was the first German book to reach the No. 1 position in the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list. In 1997, it won the Hans Fallada Prize, a German literary award, and the Prix Laure Bataillon for works translated into French. In 1999 it was awarded the &quot;Welt&quot;-Literaturpreis of the newspaper &quot;Die Welt&quot;.

In 2000, Schlink published a collection of short fiction called &quot;&quot;. A January 2008 literary tour, including an appearance in San Francisco for City Arts &amp; Lectures, was cancelled due to Schlink&#x27;s recovery from minor surgery.

In 2008, Stephen Daldry directed a film adaptation of &quot;The Reader.&quot; In 2010, his non-fiction political history, &quot;Guilt About the Past&quot; was published by Beautiful Books Limited (UK).

, Schlink divides his time between New York and Berlin. He is a member of PEN Centre Germany.

<doc id="685106" wikidata="Q850329" url="?curid=685106" title="Betty Dodson">
<text>Betty Dodson (August 24, 1929October 31, 2020) was an American sex educator. An artist by training, she exhibited erotic art in New York City, before pioneering the pro-sex feminist movement. Dodson&#x27;s workshops and manuals encourage women to masturbate, often in groups.

==Early career==
Dodson went to New York City to train as an artist in 1950, and lived on Manhattan&#x27;s Madison Avenue from 1962. In 1959, Dodson married Frederick Lief, an advertising director; they divorced in 1965. Dodson&#x27;s quest for &quot;sexual self-discovery&quot; began after her divorce. Dodson held a first one-woman show of erotic art at the Wickersham Gallery in New York City in 1968. In 1987, her &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine memoir and instructional series, &quot;Sex for One&quot;, was published. Random House later published the work broadly, and it was translated into 25 languages.

Dodson criticized Eve Ensler&#x27;s &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;, which she believed has a negative and restrictive view of sexuality with an anti-male bias.

Dodson earned a degree from the unaccredited Institute for the Advanced Study of Human Sexuality for her research work on sexuality.

==Workshops and coaching==

Dodson became active in the sex-positive movement in the late 1960s.

From the 1970s onwards, she organised &quot;Bodysex workshops&quot;. Bodysex is a practice developed by Betty Dodson to help women connect with their bodies and erogenous zones, heal shames, improve pleasure perception, and promote self-love. In the workshops, women were guided to explore their bodies and masturbate together to learn, with guidance, &quot;how&quot; to have an orgasm as a woman alone and with a sexual partner. Her two-hour sessions featured 15 naked women, each using a Hitachi Magic Wand to aid in masturbation. Dodson used the Magic Wand, a mains-powered vibrator, in demonstrations and instructional classes to instruct women regarding self-pleasure techniques. She provided a Magic Wand to each woman for these sessions. She recommended women put a small towel over their vulva in order to dull the sensation of the vibrator and prolong the pleasurable experience. The essence of her method was to provide vaginal and clitoral stimulation at the same time. Dodson taught thousands of women to achieve orgasm using this technique. Her technique became known as the Betty Dodson Method.

A study conducted in 2007 tested the &quot;Betty Dodson Method&quot; in group therapy with 500 previously anorgasmic women. Of the 500, 465 (93%) had orgasms during therapy, while 35 (7%) did not. In a 2021 study, the female techniques for pleasurable vaginal intercourse taught by Dodson (&quot;Angling, Rocking, Shallowing, Pairing&quot;) are again described by women.

==Later career==
Dodson published a memoir, &quot;Sex by Design&quot;, in 2010.

In 2014, she stated that she considered herself a fourth-wave feminist, stating that the previous waves of feminist were banal and anti-sexual, which is why she has chosen to look at a new stance of feminism, fourth wave feminism. In 2014, Dodson worked with women to discover their sexual desires through masturbation. Dodson said her work has gained support from an audience of young, successful women who have never had an orgasm. This includes fourth-wave feminists – those rejecting the anti-pleasure stance they believe third-wave feminists stand for.

Dodson died on October 31, 2020, at the age of 91, from cirrhosis in a Manhattan nursing home.

<text>Weibel–Palade bodies are the storage granules of endothelial cells, the cells that form the inner lining of the blood vessels and heart. They manufacture, store and release two principal molecules, von Willebrand factor and P-selectin, and thus play a dual role in hemostasis and inflammation.

==Etymology==
Weibel–Palade bodies were initially described by the Swiss anatomist Ewald R. Weibel and the Romanian physiologist George Emil Palade in 1964. Palade won Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1974 for his work on the function of organelles in cells.

==Constituents==
There are two major components stored within Weibel–Palade bodies. One is von Willebrand factor (vWF), a multimeric protein that plays a major role in blood coagulation. Storage of long polymers of vWF gives this specialized lysosomal structure an oblong shape and striated appearance on electron microscope. The other is P-selectin, which plays a central role in the ability of inflamed endothelial cells to recruit passing leukocytes (white blood cells), allowing them to exit the blood vessel (extravasate) and enter the surrounding tissue, where they can migrate to the site of infection or injury.

Additional Weibel–Palade body components are the chemokines interleukin-8 and eotaxin-3, endothelin-1, angiopoietin-2, osteoprotegerin, the P-selectin cofactor CD63/lamp3, and α-1,3-fucosyltransferase VI.

==Production==
Multimeric vWF is assembled head-to-head in the Golgi apparatus from tail-to-tail vWF dimers. vWF multimers condense and twist into long, helical, mostly parallel tubules separated by a less dense matrix of protein domains protruding from the tubules. The Golgi then buds off clathrin-coated vesicles which consist almost exclusively of vWF.

Immature Weibel–Palade bodies remain near the nucleus, where they acquire more membrane proteins and then disperse throughout the cytoplasm, carried along microtubules by kinesins. Clathrin-coated vesicles bud from immature Weibel–Palade bodies, reducing their volumes, condensing their contents, and removing select membrane proteins. Maturing Weibel–Palade bodies may also fuse with each other.

The only parallel organelle in physiology is the alpha&quot;-&quot;granule of platelets, which also contains vWF. Weibel–Palade bodies are the main source of vWF, while α-granules probably play a minor role.

==Secretion==
Weibel-Palade bodies undergo a complex maturation process following their dissociation from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) which involves recruitment of a large number of membrane proteins. These include Rab GTPases such as Rab27A, Rab3B and Rab3D, Rab effectors and SNARE proteins, which together form the exocytotic machinery of Weibel-Palade bodies. 

The small subset of Weibel–Palade bodies tethered at the cell periphery to the actin cortex serve as a readily releasable pool that&#x27;s replenished by a larger pool of microtubule-associated bodies in the cell interior.

The contents of Weibel–Palade bodies are secreted by one of three mechanisms. Some undergo exocytosis individually in a rapid, sub-second fusion event, while others fuse transiently to the plasma membrane in a &quot;lingering kiss&quot; that opens a pore large enough for only their smaller cargo (e.g. IL-8, CD63) to diffuse out. In some cases this is accompanied by the formation of an actomyosin ring complex around the fusing Weibel-Palade body. Weibel–Palade bodies may also coalesce into larger vesicles called secretory pods, for multigranular exocytosis. Secretory pod formation is mediated by interposition of tiny nanovesicles between bodies. As Weibel–Palade bodies fuse together into secretory pods, their vWF cargo loses its tubular form for spaghetti-like strings that are then exocytosed through a fusion pore. Whether cargo besides vWF is exocytosed from secretory pods or selectively retained is uncertain. Different modes of cargo release from Weibel–Palade bodies may be a mechanism for differential release of subsets of molecules in different physiological conditions.

During secretion, the vWF molecules fuse together into the final concatamer &quot;strings&quot;.

==Clinical significance==
The importance of Weibel–Palade bodies are highlighted by some human disease mutations. Mutations within vWF are the usual cause of the most common inherited bleeding disorder, von Willebrand disease. VWD has an estimated prevalence in some human populations of up to 1%, and is most often characterized by prolonged and variable mucocutaneous bleeding. Type III von Willebrand Disease is a severe bleeding disorder, like severe hemophilia type A or B. VWF acts in primary hemostasis to recruit platelets at a site of injury, and is also important in secondary hemostasis, acting as a chaperone for coagulation factor VIII (FVIII).

<text>WGPR (107.5 FM) is a commercial radio station in Detroit, Michigan, broadcasting an urban contemporary radio format. Owned by the International Free and Accepted Modern Masons, its studios and offices are on East Jefferson Avenue on Detroit&#x27;s lower eastside.

WGPR has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 50,000 watts. The station&#x27;s transmitter is atop the Maccabees Building on the campus of Wayne State University, on Woodward Avenue in Detroit.

==History==

===Early years===
The station signed on the air on December 6, 1961. It was founded by broadcaster Ross Mulholland, who had worked at WJR and several other area stations. The original construction permit for the station bore the call sign WQTI, similar to Mulholland&#x27;s easy listening-formatted AM station, WQTE (560 AM, now WRDT), but the station was never on the air with those call letters. Upon signing on, the call letters were WGPR.

Initially, WGPR featured easy listening music similar to that of WQTE. The station was purchased in 1964 by its current owner, the International Free and Accepted Modern Masons (d/b/a WGPR, Inc.), led by Dr. William V. Banks, who served as president and general manager of WGPR until his death in 1985.

It is reported that the station&#x27;s call sign meant &quot;Where God&#x27;s Presence Radiates&quot;, but the original meaning was &quot;Grosse Pointe Radio.&quot; The station was originally based at a studio on 20233 Mack Avenue in Grosse Pointe Woods when it went on the air. The original building still stands and houses a real estate agent. The current studios are located on East Jefferson in Detroit.

An independent television station focusing on shows aimed at African-American viewers was added in 1975, WGPR-TV. On September 29, 1975, Amyre Porter, Doug Morrison and Sharon Crews became the nation&#x27;s first African-American primetime news team. WGPR-TV became a CBS network affiliate in 1994 following WJBK&#x27;s switch from CBS to Fox. WGPR-TV was sold to CBS in 1995, taking the call sign WWJ-TV.

===Urban Contemporary===
Under the ownership of the Masons, WGPR transitioned to African-American-oriented programming, including Urban Contemporary, R&amp;B, Soul Music and Urban Gospel. Some brokered ethnic programs in Spanish, Italian, Greek and other languages, were on the schedule into the 1990s.

The disc jockey known as Electrifyin&#x27; Mojo was heard evenings on WGPR during the early 1980s. In 1982, during Mojo&#x27;s tenure at WGPR, the station scored its highest ratings, landing in the Top 10 on several occasions. By the mid-1980s, the station had once again fallen into the lower echelons of the ratings and remained there for the next quarter-century. WGPR was, by October 2011, the lowest-rated of Detroit&#x27;s three urban AC stations, trailing WMXD and WDMK. Nevertheless, the station had a devoted audience. Its ratings were not adversely affected by Detroit&#x27;s switching from Arbitron&#x27;s diary system to Portable People Meters (PPM).

===Jazzy 107.5 and The Rhythm===
Until October 2011, WGPR featured a mix of urban adult contemporary hits and urban oldies. From June 1997 to June 2008, the station was known as &quot;The Rhythm 107-5&quot; or &quot;The Jazzy 107-5&quot;, and for several years, featured smooth jazz mixed in with its urban format. On June 20, 2008, the station reverted to an urban AC format.
Saturdays were &quot;Old School Saturdays&quot;, featuring a wide variety of classic R&amp;B, soul and dance-oriented oldies. Genres played on OSS included disco, funk, 1980s electronic music, dance music, Motown, urban oldies, and 1970s R&amp;B. This program was prone to technical errors, including skipping CDs, varying volume levels between tracks, a song ending midway through and sometimes accidental but simultaneous mix-in of multiple song tracks. Sundays were devoted mostly to urban gospel programming. According to the September 2011 PPM Ratings release, WGPR ranked #20 (2.1) in the Detroit market.

=== Radio One LMA===
The current urban format on WGPR began on WCHB-FM (105.9) in 1996, later changing call signs to WDTJ before swapping formats with WDMK by moving to that station&#x27;s frequency on 102.7 as WHTD in 2005.

On October 21, 2011, Radio One announced that it would take over WGPR under a local marketing agreement (LMA), and move WHTD&#x27;s urban contemporary format to the station as &quot;Hot 107.5&quot;. Meanwhile, WHTD was to flip to an urban gospel format as &quot;Praise 102.7&quot; on October 31. On October 24, WGPR signed off as Radio One assumed control, and began stunting with a loop of &quot;It&#x27;s So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday&quot; by Boyz II Men. This was interspersed with promos redirecting WGPR listeners to Radio One&#x27;s urban AC station WDMK (whose competition was neutralized by the format shuffle).

On October 26, 2011, WGPR re-launched as &quot;Hot 107.5&quot;. WIZF alum Big Greg (also known as Buckie Naked) was the first DJ on air, followed by future &quot;106 &amp; Park&quot; host Shorty Da Prince on nights and Paigion on mid-days.

The WHTD call letters did not move with the frequency shift; the call letters now belong to an AM radio station in Toccoa, Georgia. WGPR featured the syndicated Rickey Smiley morning show until October 2014, when it was replaced with &quot;The Morning Heat&quot;, a local show with Big Greg, Foolish, and Deelishis.

In the December 2013 Detroit PPM ratings report, WGPR ranked 14th 6+ among subscribing stations, with a 3.6 rating to rival WJLB&#x27;s 4.2.

=== End of Urban One LMA ===
On June 10, 2019, Urban One announced that it would not renew its LMA with WGPR when it expired at the end of 2019. The same day, Beasley Broadcast Group announced that it would acquire WDMK and its Detroit Praise Network stations for $13.5 million.

WGPR is once again run by a staff employed by the Masons. It has remained a Mainstream Urban outlet, competing with WJLB, WMXD, WDMK and WMGC-FM.

== HD Radio ==
===Smooth Jazz and Modern Rock===
On April 20, 2011, WGPR launched two HD Radio digital subchannels, with a smooth jazz format on WGPR-HD2 as &quot;The Oasis&quot; and modern rock on WGPR-HD3 as &quot;The Bone&quot;. These subchannels were programmed by the Martz Communications Group. Martz owned the low-powered translators (through licensee Radio Power, Inc.) that rebroadcast the HD Radio signals: 104.7 FM W284BQ would rebroadcast &quot;The Oasis&quot;, while 94.3 FM W232CA would rebroadcast &quot;The Bone&quot;. &quot;The Oasis&quot; programming came from Broadcast Architecture&#x27;s Smooth Jazz Network, featuring Kenny G as morning show host with Detroit radio veteran Sandy Kovach (formerly of the former smooth jazz outlet V98.7) as co-host. As of May 1, 2011, the station added an HD4 subchannel with Regional Mexican programming branded as &quot;La Jefa&quot;. By July of that year, the HD4 subchannel was no longer on air.

Martz&#x27;s operation of WGPR&#x27;s HD subchannels was not affected by the LMA agreement with Radio One. On January 31, 2012, Martz Communications ceased operations of The Oasis and The Bone, forcing them both off the air. Financial and signal difficulties were the primary reasons for the closure of the two HD subchannels.

===&quot;The Oasis&quot; vs. WIOT Toledo===
In March 2011, Martz filed an application with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to relocate the frequency of W284BQ, from 104.7 MHz to 93.9 MHz. The application was approved in August 2011. If built, the transmitter will interfere with Windsor, Ontario station CIDR-FM in much of the Greater Detroit area, though the licensee contends that the transmitter will be directional, as to not interfere with CIDR-FM on the Canadian side of the border. 

In May 2011, Toledo station WIOT, which also broadcasts on 104.7 MHz, filed a complaint with the FCC, saying that W284BQ interferes with WIOT in the Michigan portion of their broadcast area. WIOT had also solicited comments and reception reports from listeners in the affected area.

Martz would soon after establish a website, http://www.savetheoasis.com/, which explains the station&#x27;s position on the issue, stating that WIOT should not get special treatment on the grounds that it was an Ohio radio station that served no part of Detroit (though the statement was not exactly true, as the station was interfering with listeners inside WIOT&#x27;s protected signal contour) and that Clear Channel&#x27;s motive was to try to remove competition, as Clear Channel owns two of the heritage adult-oriented radio stations in Detroit, WMXD and WNIC. The Oasis&#x27; web site mentioned that they and Clear Channel planned to undergo mutual testing in order to alleviate the interference problems, but in June 2011, The Oasis claimed that Clear Channel had broken the commitment to work together for a resolution.

On October 18, 2011, the FCC ordered W284BQ to cease operation immediately. &quot;Oasis&quot; programming continued in the interim over WGPR-HD2 and 1047theoasis.com, until both the HD2 and the website were shut down. The translator filed to move to 93.5 MHz; however, a K-LOVE repeater also applied to use this frequency and was granted permission.

On January 9, 2012, Martz applied to return The Oasis to the airwaves, this time via a translator on 92.7 MHz. However, any relaunch on 92.7 was negated by Martz&#x27;s suspension of operations of its Detroit HD Radio operations, as FCC regulations require the translators to repeat an existing station. The 92.7 translator has since been taken over by Salem Communications-owned talk station WDTK and is used to relay that station. Meanwhile, smooth jazz programming returned to the Detroit airwaves during the late evening and overnight hours via Radio One&#x27;s WCHB and its FM translator.

<doc id="685130" wikidata="Q5986772" url="?curid=685130" title="Ictal headache">
<text>A headache is often present in patients with epilepsy.
If the headache occurs in the vicinity of a seizure, it is defined as peri-ictal headache, which can occur either before (pre-ictal) or after (post-ictal) the seizure, to which the term ictal refers.
An ictal headache itself may or may not be an epileptic manifestation. In the first case, it is defined as ictal epileptic headache or simply epileptic headache. It is a type of pain seizure that can remain isolated or be followed by other manifestations of the seizure.
On the other hand, a ictal non-epileptic headache is a headache that occurs during a seizure but it is not due to an epileptic mechanism.
When the headache does not occur in the vicinity of a seizure, it is defined as inter-ictal headache. In the case it&#x27;s a disorder separate from epilepsy, it&#x27;s a comorbidity.
==Definitions==

Pre-ictal headache.

The most frequent cause of a pre-ictal headache is that of a seizure occurring during or within one hour after an attack of migraine with aura, defined Migraine aura-triggered seizure or Migralepsy. However, the condition can also occur in connection with an attack of migraine without aura or of a non-migrainous headache. Only an EEG during the headache can determine whether it is a true migraine or an epileptic headache (in this second case epileptiform anomalies are detectable during the headache phase).

Post-ictal headache.

It is a headache “occurring within three hours after an epileptic seizure and remitting spontaneously within 72 hours after seizure termination”. It is one of the possible symptoms of the postictal state.
Post-ictal headache is the most frequent association between headache and epilepsy, occurring between 12% and 52% of people with epilepsy. Post-ictal headache has migrainous features in about half of the cases. It is more frequent after generalized tonic-clonic seizures, in temporal and occipital lobe epilepsy and in those with inter-ictal headache.

Inter-ictal headache.

Patients with epilepsy may also experience any type of headache, having its occurrence independent of the epileptic seizures, although occasionally near it (after or before). This is a comorbid condition, to be kept separate from the above-reported peri-ictal and ictal headaches.

===Ictal headache===

1. Ictal epileptic headache (IEH) or, more simply, Epileptic headache (EH, since the term &quot;ictal&quot; is pleonastic, as a headache manifestation of an epileptic seizure is by definition ictal). This is a rare form of a pain seizure.
EH may be the initial phase (so-called aura, necessarily with awareness) of an epileptic seizure, which then continues with other manifestations, for example convulsions. But EH is of greater clinical importance when it is an isolated event (&quot;pure EH&quot; ), i.e. not followed by other manifestations that clarify its epileptic nature.

Symptoms and diagnosis.
EH has no clinical elements allowing a diagnosis. The characteristics and location of the pain in EH can be different: sometimes migraine-like with or without aura, sometimes tension-type, sometimes indefinable. The duration of an episode of EH may last for seconds, or for days (headache/status epilepticus).

For the diagnosis it is necessary to perform an EEG during the headache that shows epilepsy-compatible discharges coinciding with the onset and cessation of the headache.

The so-called hemicrania epileptica is a variant of EH characterized by the fact that head pain and EEG paroxysms are located on the same side.

MRI is necessary to establish the cause, which, as in all focal epilepsies, can be varied: malformations/dysplasia, neoplasms, encephalopathies, traumatic brain injury, vasculopathies.

Therapy. It depends on the etiology. During the headache, like most seizures, i.v. benzodiazepines are usually effective. Antiepileptic drugs can be used as preventive.

2. Ictal non-epileptic headache. Rare cases are reported.
It is a condition that can be differentiated with certainty from the previous one if the headache episode is also present outside the seizure, that is, before and/or after, without specific EEG abnormalities.

<doc id="685131" wikidata="Q7553164" url="?curid=685131" title="Soda Constructor">
<text>Soda Constructor is a Java based physics engine, which was central to Soda&#x27;s collaborative learning environment Sodaplay.com. It was created by Ed Burton, Soda&#x27;s Research and development Director, in April 2000. It won an Interactive Arts BAFTA Award in 2001.

== Overview ==

Sodaplay.com users use constructor to create and share &quot;models&quot;. These models are made of &quot;masses&quot; and &quot;springs&quot; and follow strict physical laws. By turning springs into &quot;muscles&quot;, models can be animated and made very lifelike.

==History==

Around 1990, Ed Burton created the precursor to sodaconstructor - a BASIC program entitled &quot;Constructor&quot; which contained some of sodaconstructor&#x27;s modern functionality, with both springs and masses, but not muscles, available for construction. This program was never released and was never intended for general use.

In May 1998, Ed Burton joined Soda, and it was around this time that he wrote the first Java version of the Constructor, mostly as a fun way to teach himself Java. The Soda team experimented with the program, creating the twelve basic models that are now presented as examples. This version of the program existed quietly on the soda website, still not being advertised or spread as an official Soda product. This small project eventually began to evolve into the &quot;sodaconstructor&quot;, spreading only by word of mouth.

By early 2001, as the number of active users began to grow, the team realized a save function was necessary to allow people to store the models they had created. With this feature, the Soda team began to emphasize sodaconstructor on their site and created the Sodazoo, a list of user-created models that had been deemed noteworthy enough to capture and share among the community which was growing around the applet. Soon after this, a forum was created in order to support the fan base and encourage discussion of models and construction techniques.

Around late August 2007, Ed Burton and the soda team released Sodaconstructor II, an improved version of the classic sodaconstructor. It had a more standard interface, based around built-in features instead of the older sliders and menus built from scratch. It also allowed users to download, modify, and load the XML data used to store models, leading to some scripted tools being used for precise construction and introduced solid springs which masses would bounce off of. However, reaction was generally negative, as most users preferred the older interface due to its simplicity and flexibility. Another issue was the fact that due to small tweaks in the physics engine and XML format, some old models which relied on precise timing no longer functioned properly with the new applet.

The community found the files required to run the old version, and XML converters were written, so both versions are now able to be used.

==Features==

Recently even more features have been added, expanding the sodaplay universe: sodarace and SC Local. Sodarace is a program where constructors can pit their models against other constructors&#x27; models on varying terrains, to see whose is faster. There is a sodarace league forum on the sodarace website, intended for challenging others to a race or showing off your model&#x27;s prowess in previously created races.

Along with sodarace came Sodaconstructor Local, which is an offline form of sodaconstructor. With it you can import and export models from and to your computer. Models on your computer are stored in an XML format, allowing you to edit your model in a text editor and import it back into sodaconstructor. Obviously not everyone would be interested in doing this, but it certainly gives constructors an edge in racing or the artistic aspects of their models.

As sodaconstructor has developed, constructors have become more and more clever at using the software to create exceedingly complex models, some of which even contain &quot;motors&quot; (self-contained structures that can power an entire model). Sodaconstructor continues to evolve and expand, with no sign of stopping.

== Community ==

The sodaplay community is small but diverse. While thousands of sodaplay creations are created, the forum is visited by only a few daily. Meanwhile, the number of sodasites are very small. Also the presence of the sodateam is noticed as very inactive.

Global moderators make rare appearances on the forum. It is believed that they get online to sort matters out, promote/demote, or do other administrative things.

==Demise==
As the tools became obsolete, redevelopment was considered too costly and Sodaplay.com was first archived with modelling tools made unavailable but the model archive maintained. In 2017 the archive was taken offline and the sodaplay redirected to Soda&#x27;s home page.

<doc id="685132" wikidata="Q5457908" url="?curid=685132" title="Flatiron Building (Atlanta)">
<text>The English-American Building, commonly referenced as the Flatiron Building, is a building completed in 1897 located at 84 Peachtree Street NW in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, on the wedge-shaped block between Peachtree Street NE, Poplar Street NW, and Broad Street NW. It was completed five years before New York&#x27;s Flatiron Building, and shares a similar prominent flatiron shape as its counterpart. It was designed by Bradford Gilbert, a Chicago school contemporary of Daniel Burnham, the designer of the New York building. The building has 11 stories, and is the city&#x27;s second and oldest standing skyscraper. The Flatiron building is protected by the city as a historic building in the Fairlie-Poplar district of downtown, and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

Immediately across Peachtree is the historic Rhodes-Haverty Building, on the north corner with Williams Street.

FlatironCity is now home to a Microsoft Innovation Center, Women&#x27;s Entrepreneurship Institute and 20+ entrepreneurs and startups.

In 2017, it was announced that a statue of Evander Holyfield would be installed in front of the building. However, the planned location for the statue has since been changed.

<doc id="685151" wikidata="Q1201158" url="?curid=685151" title="Explicitly parallel instruction computing">
<text>Explicitly parallel instruction computing (EPIC) is a term coined in 1997 by the HP–Intel alliance to describe a computing paradigm that researchers had been investigating since the early 1980s. This paradigm is also called &quot;Independence&quot; architectures. It was the basis for Intel and HP development of the Intel Itanium architecture, and HP later asserted that &quot;EPIC&quot; was merely an old term for the Itanium architecture. EPIC permits microprocessors to execute software instructions in parallel by using the compiler, rather than complex on-die circuitry, to control parallel instruction execution. This was intended to allow simple performance scaling without resorting to higher clock frequencies.

==Roots in VLIW==
By 1989, researchers at HP recognized that reduced instruction set computer (RISC) architectures were reaching a limit at one instruction per cycle. They began an investigation into a new architecture, later named EPIC. The basis for the research was VLIW, in which multiple operations are encoded in every instruction, and then processed by multiple execution units.

One goal of EPIC was to move the complexity of instruction scheduling from the CPU hardware to the software compiler, which can do the instruction scheduling statically (with help of trace feedback information). This eliminates the need for complex scheduling circuitry in the CPU, which frees up space and power for other functions, including additional execution resources. An equally important goal was to further exploit instruction-level parallelism (&quot;ILP&quot;) by using the compiler to find and exploit additional opportunities for parallel execution.

&quot;VLIW&quot; (at least the original forms) has several short-comings that precluded it from becoming mainstream:
* VLIW instruction sets are not backward compatible between implementations. When wider implementations (more execution units) are built, the instruction set for the wider machines is not backward compatible with older, narrower implementations.
* Load responses from a memory hierarchy which includes CPU caches and DRAM do not have a deterministic delay. This makes static scheduling of load instructions by the compiler very difficult.
EPIC architecture evolved from VLIW architecture, but retained many concepts of the superscalar architecture.

==Moving beyond VLIW==
&quot;EPIC&quot; architectures add several features to get around the deficiencies of
VLIW:
* Each group of multiple software instructions is called a &quot;bundle&quot;. Each of the bundles has a stop bit indicating if this set of operations is depended upon by the subsequent bundle. With this capability, future implementations can be built to issue multiple bundles in parallel. The dependency information is calculated by the compiler, so the hardware does not have to perform operand dependency checking.
* A software prefetch instruction is used as a type of data prefetch. This prefetch increases the chances for a cache hit for loads, and can indicate the degree of temporal locality needed in various levels of the cache.
* A speculative load instruction is used to speculatively load data before it is known whether it will be used (bypassing control dependencies), or whether it will be modified before it is used (bypassing data dependencies).
* A check load instruction aids speculative loads by checking whether a speculative load was dependent on a later store, and thus must be reloaded.

The &quot;EPIC&quot; architecture also includes a &quot;grab-bag&quot; of architectural concepts to increase &quot;ILP&quot;:
* Predicated execution is used to decrease the occurrence of branches and to increase the speculative execution of instructions. In this feature, branch conditions are converted to predicate registers which are used to kill results of executed instructions from the side of the branch which is not taken.
* Delayed exceptions, using a not a thing bit within the general purpose registers, allow speculative execution past possible exceptions.
* Very large architectural register files avoid the need for register renaming.
* Multi-way branch instructions improve branch prediction by combining many alternative branches into one bundle.

The Itanium architecture also added rotating register files, a tool useful for software pipelining since it avoids having to manually unroll and rename registers.

==Other research and development==
There have been other investigations into EPIC architectures that are not directly tied to the development of the Itanium architecture:
*The IMPACT project at University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, led by Wen-mei Hwu, was the source of much influential research on this topic.
*The PlayDoh architecture from HP-labs was another major research project.
*Gelato was an open source development community in which academic and commercial researchers worked to develop more effective compilers for Linux applications running on Itanium servers.

<text>A Nissen fundoplication, or laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication when performed via laparoscopic surgery, is a surgical procedure to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and hiatal hernia. In GERD, it is usually performed when medical therapy has failed; but, with a Type II (paraesophageal) hiatus hernia, it is the first-line procedure. The Nissen fundoplication is total (360°), but partial fundoplications known as Thal (270° anterior), Belsey (270° anterior transthoracic), Dor (anterior 180–200°), Lind (300° posterior), and Toupet fundoplications (posterior 270°) are alternative procedures with somewhat different indications and outcomes.

==History==
Dr. Rudolph Nissen (1896–1981) first performed the procedure in 1955 and published the results of two cases in a 1956 &quot;Swiss Medical Weekly&quot;. In 1961 he published a more detailed overview of the procedure. Nissen originally called the surgery &quot;gastroplication&quot;. The procedure has borne his name since it gained popularity in the 1970s.

== Indications ==
The most common indication for a fundoplication is GERD that has failed lifestyle modification and medical management. Patients that continue to have reflux symptoms or that have had uncontrolled reflux symptoms for more than 5 years are also candidates for surgical management. Complications that arise from long term GERD such as severe esophagitis, stricture formation, and ulcer development, all of which can be seen on endoscopy, warrant surgical intervention. Presence of Barrett&#x27;s esophagus is not an indication, as the benefit of a fundoplication in preventing progression into adenocarcinoma is controversial. Respiratory symptoms and upper airway symptoms such as cough, asthma, hoarseness are also indications for surgical intervention. In the pediatric population, infants who fail to thrive or have inadequate weight gain despite proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may also benefit from fundoplication.

==Technique==

In a &quot;fundoplication&quot;, the gastric fundus (upper part) of the stomach is wrapped, or plicated, around the lower end of the esophagus and stitched in place, reinforcing the closing function of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). The esophageal hiatus is also narrowed down by sutures to prevent or treat concurrent hiatal hernia, in which the fundus slides up through the enlarged esophageal hiatus of the diaphragm.
The surgeon should begin with ligating and dividing the short gastric arteries.

In a Nissen fundoplication, also called a complete fundoplication, the fundus is wrapped the entire 360 degrees around the esophagus. In contrast, surgery for achalasia is generally accompanied by either a &quot;Dor&quot; or &quot;Toupet&quot; partial fundoplication, which is less likely than a Nissen wrap to aggravate the dysphagia that characterizes achalasia. In a Dor (anterior) fundoplication, the fundus is laid over the top of the esophagus; while in a Toupet (posterior) fundoplication, the fundus is wrapped around the back of the esophagus.

The procedure can be performed with open surgery but is now routinely performed laparoscopically, as laparoscopic surgery has decreased post-operative complications and decreased hospital stay. When used to alleviate gastroesophageal reflux symptoms in patients with delayed gastric emptying, it is frequently combined with modification of the pylorus via pyloromyotomy or pyloroplasty.

This procedure can also be completed robotically. Outcomes comparing laparoscopic fundoplication to robotic fundoplication show similar clinical outcomes, but robotic fundoplication is more likely to have an increased length of operative time and financial cost.

==Mechanism of relief==
Whenever the stomach contracts, it also closes off the esophagus instead of squeezing stomach acids into it. This prevents the reflux of gastric acid (in GERD). Although antacids and PPI drug therapy can reduce the effects of reflux acid, successful surgical treatment has the advantage of eliminating drug side-effects and damaging effects from other components of reflux such as bile or gastric contents. The Nissen fundoplication reduces reflux by reinforcing the LES by increasing LES pressure and increasing the LES length.

==Effectiveness==
Nissen (complete) fundoplication is generally considered to be safe and effective, with a mortality rate of less than 1% and many of the most common post-operative complications minimized or eliminated by the partial fundoplication procedures now more commonly used. Studies have shown that after 10 years, 89.5% of patients are still symptom-free. When compared to stand alone medical therapy with PPIs, Nissen fundoplication has been found to be superior in reducing acid reflux as well as the symptoms associated with reflux. Fundoplication was found to be better at increasing LES pressure than PPI therapy, whilst having similar risk for adverse events. In patients with non-acid reflux, a hiatal hernia, or respiratory symptoms, surgical intervention was found to be more effective at controlling symptoms than PPIs alone.

==Complications==
Complications include &quot;gas bloat syndrome&quot;, dysphagia (trouble swallowing), dumping syndrome, excessive scarring, vagus nerve injury and, rarely, achalasia. The fundoplication can also come undone over time in about 5–10% of cases, leading to recurrence of symptoms. If the symptoms warrant a repeat surgery, the surgeon may use Marlex or another form of artificial mesh to strengthen the connection. Postoperative ileus, which is common after abdominal surgery, is possible.

In &quot;gas bloat syndrome&quot;, fundoplication can alter the mechanical ability of the stomach to eliminate swallowed air by belching, leading to an accumulation of gas in the stomach or small intestine. Data varies, but some degree of gas-bloat may occur in as many as 41% of Nissen patients, whereas the occurrence is less with patients undergoing partial anterior fundoplication. Gas bloat syndrome is usually self-limiting within 2 to 4 weeks, but in some it may persist. The offending gas may also come from dietary sources (especially carbonated beverages), or involuntary swallowing of air (aerophagia). If postoperative gas-bloat syndrome does not resolve with time, dietary restrictions, counseling regarding aerophagia, medications, and correction – either by endoscopic balloon dilatation or repeat surgery to revise the Nissen fundoplication to a partial fundoplication – may be necessary.

Acute dysphagia or short term trouble swallowing is a symptom that most patients will have after having a fundoplication. Patients who have dysphagia prior to surgery are more likely to have some dysphagia post-operatively. Symptoms of dysphagia will often resolve on their own within a few months. Short term dysphagia is controlled by modifying diet to include more easily swallowed food such as liquids and soft foods. Dysphagia that persists longer than 3 months will need further evaluation, typically with a barium swallow study, esophageal manometry, or endoscopy. Structural changes such as movement of the wrap, herniation, development of stenosis or stricture may lead to persistent dysphagia. Previously undiagnosed achalasia or a wrap that is too tight may also lead to persistent dysphagia. Depending on the etiology of persistent dysphagia, a trial of PPI therapy, endoscopic dilation, or surgical revision may be necessary.

Vomiting is sometimes impossible or, if not, very painful after a fundoplication, with the likelihood of this complication typically decreasing in the months after surgery. In some cases, the purpose of this operation is to correct excessive vomiting. Initially, vomiting is impossible; however, small amounts of vomit may be produced after the wrap settles over time, and in extreme cases such as alcohol poisoning or food poisoning, the patient may be able to vomit freely with some amount of pain.

<doc id="685158" wikidata="Q1375989" url="?curid=685158" title="Neyman–Pearson lemma">
<text>In statistics, the Neyman–Pearson lemma describes the existence and uniqueness of the likelihood ratio as a uniformly most powerful test in certain contexts. It was introduced by Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson in a paper in 1933. The Neyman–Pearson lemma is part of the Neyman–Pearson theory of statistical testing, which introduced concepts like errors of the second kind, power function, and inductive behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;org/euclid.ndml&quot;&gt;Wald: Chapter II: The Neyman–Pearson Theory of Testing a Statistical Hypothesis: Wald: Chapter II: The Neyman–Pearson Theory of Testing a Statistical Hypothesis&lt;/ref&gt; The previous Fisherian theory of significance testing postulated only one hypothesis. By introducing a competing hypothesis, the Neyman–Pearsonian flavor of statistical testing allows investigating the two types of errors. The trivial cases where one always rejects or accepts the null hypothesis are of little interest but it does prove that one must not relinquish control over one type of error while calibrating the other. Neyman and Pearson accordingly proceeded to restrict their attention to the class of all formula_1 level tests while subsequently minimizing type II error, traditionally denoted by formula_2. Their seminal paper of 1933, including the Neyman–Pearson lemma, comes at the end of this endeavor, not only showing the existence of tests with the most power that retain a prespecified level of type I error (formula_1), but also providing a way to construct such tests. The Karlin-Rubin theorem extends the Neyman–Pearson lemma to settings involving composite hypotheses with monotone likelihood ratios.

==Statement==
Consider a test with hypotheses formula_4 and formula_5, where the probability density function (or probability mass function) is formula_6 for formula_7.

For any hypothesis test with rejection set formula_8, and any formula_9, we say that it satisfies condition formula_10 if
* formula_11
** That is, the test has size formula_1 (that is, the probability of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis is formula_1).
* formula_14 such that
:: formula_15
: where formula_16 is a negligible set in both formula_17 and formula_18 cases: formula_19.
* That is, we have a strict likelihood ratio test, except on a negligible subset.
For any formula_9, let the set of level formula_21 tests be the set of all hypothesis tests with size at most formula_21. That is, letting its rejection set be formula_8, we have formula_24.

In practice, the likelihood ratio is often used directly to construct tests — see likelihood-ratio test. However it can also be used to suggest particular test-statistics that might be of interest or to suggest simplified tests — for this, one considers algebraic manipulation of the ratio to see if there are key statistics in it related to the size of the ratio (i.e. whether a large statistic corresponds to a small ratio or to a large one).

(x) - 1_R(x)][\rho(x\mid\theta_1) - \eta \rho(x\mid\theta_0)] \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; except on some ignorable set formula_16.

Then integrate it over formula_26 to obtain
formula_27

Since formula_28 and formula_29, we find that formula_30.

Thus the formula_31 rejection test is a UMP test in the set of level formula_1 tests.

Uniqueness:

For any other UMP level formula_1 test, with rejection region formula_8, we have from Existence part,
formula_35. 

Since the formula_8 test is UMP, the left side must be zero. Since formula_37 the right side gives
formula_38, so the formula_8 test has size formula_1.

Since the integrand formula_41 is nonnegative, and integrates to zero, it must be exactly zero except on some ignorable set formula_16.

Since the formula_31 test satisfies formula_10 condition, let the ignorable set in the definition of formula_10 condition be formula_46.

formula_47 is ignorable, since for all formula_48, we have formula_49. 

Similarly, formula_50 is ignorable. 

Define formula_51 (where formula_52 means symmetric difference). It is the union of three ignorable sets, thus it is an ignorable set. 

Then we have
formula_53 and formula_54. So the formula_8 rejection test satisfies formula_10 condition with the same formula_57.

Since formula_58 is ignorable, its subset formula_59 is also ignorable. Consequently, the two tests agree with probability formula_60 whether formula_61 or formula_62.

== Example ==

Let formula_63 be a random sample from the formula_64 distribution where the mean formula_65 is known, and suppose that we wish to test for formula_66 against formula_67. The likelihood for this set of normally distributed data is

:formula_68

We can compute the likelihood ratio to find the key statistic in this test and its effect on the test&#x27;s outcome:

:formula_69

This ratio only depends on the data through formula_70. Therefore, by the Neyman–Pearson lemma, the most powerful test of this type of hypothesis for this data will depend only on formula_70. Also, by inspection, we can see that if formula_72, then formula_73 is a decreasing function of formula_70. So we should reject formula_75 if formula_70 is sufficiently large. The rejection threshold depends on the size of the test. In this example, the test statistic can be shown to be a scaled chi-square distributed random variable and an exact critical value can be obtained.

== Application in economics ==
A variant of the Neyman–Pearson lemma has found an application in the seemingly unrelated domain of the economics of land value. One of the fundamental problems in consumer theory is calculating the demand function of the consumer given the prices. In particular, given a heterogeneous land-estate, a price measure over the land, and a subjective utility measure over the land, the consumer&#x27;s problem is to calculate the best land parcel that they can buy – i.e. the land parcel with the largest utility, whose price is at most their budget. It turns out that this problem is very similar to the problem of finding the most powerful statistical test, and so the Neyman–Pearson lemma can be used.

== Uses in electrical engineering ==
The Neyman–Pearson lemma is quite useful in electronics engineering, namely in the design and use of radar systems, digital communication systems, and in signal processing systems. 
In radar systems, the Neyman–Pearson lemma is used in first setting the rate of missed detections to a desired (low) level, and then minimizing the rate of false alarms, or vice versa.
Neither false alarms nor missed detections can be set at arbitrarily low rates, including zero. All of the above goes also for many systems in signal processing.

== Uses in particle physics ==
The Neyman–Pearson lemma is applied to the construction of analysis-specific likelihood-ratios, used to e.g. test for signatures of new physics against the nominal Standard Model prediction in proton–proton collision datasets collected at the LHC.

== Discovery of the lemma ==

Neyman wrote about the discovery of the lemma as follows. Paragraph breaks have been inserted.

<text>Blaxton is a village in the Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster (part of South Yorkshire, England), on the border with Lincolnshire. It lies to the north of Finningley, on the A614 road, and is located at approximately 53° 29&#x27; 30&quot; North, 0° 59&#x27; West, at an elevation of around 5 metres above sea level. It has a population of 1,179, reducing slightly to 1,162 at the 2011 Census.

Blaxton is a civil parish situated, since April 1974, in the county of South Yorkshire and in the Doncaster Metropolitan District. Before that date, it was situated in the West Riding of Yorkshire, one of the three divisions of the county of York. It lay on the southern border of the county and the name of the community derives from the name &#x27;Blackstone&#x27;. Blaxton does not appear in the Domesday Book of 1087 and the earliest written reference dates from 1213, when it is named as &#x27;Blacston&#x27; in the records of the central government. This spelling, or something similar, was customary for centuries. On the map in Edward Miller&#x27;s &quot;History of Doncaster&quot;, published in 1805, it appears as Blakestone. The name is likely to refer to the location of a stone that traditionally marked a boundary. The boundary that it would most recently mark would be the county boundary of Yorkshire. However, the boundary it originally marked may be even more ancient, perhaps that of the southern boundary of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria, the kingdom `North of the Humber&#x27;. The name of the village probably received its current spelling, as with many other places, from the surveyors of the Ordnance Survey, who first put Blaxton on their first map of Yorkshire, on a scale of one inch to one mile, published on 1 February 1841. This map, incidentally, shows the boundary stone to the south-east of the village cross roads.

Blaxton was part of the soke of Hexthorpe, later known as the soke of Doncaster, another ancient institution, probably dating from the time of the Norsemen. They colonised Yorkshire under their leader Halfdan, who in the year 876 decided that it was more profitable to settle in the country that they had previously only raided. The soke was a unit of local government with its own court and Blaxton effectively remained part of the soke until 1835, when the magistrates of Doncaster ceased to exercise their jurisdiction over the village.

From the earliest times, Blaxton lay in the ecclesiastical parish of Finningley. Although part of the West Riding, Blaxton, like its neighbours Austerfield, Auckley, and Blyth were not part of the great diocese of York. They were part of the archdeaconry of Nottingham. This was part of the diocese of Lichfield then, from 1836, part of the diocese of Lincoln before becoming part of the new diocese of Southwell, to which these parishes still belonged until 2010 whence the Parishes of Finningley, Blaxton and Auckley transferred to the diocese of Sheffield.
Blaxton has been through its history a small rural community. In 1811, the first time its population was counted separately, it had 132 residents. There were 146 of them by the mid-century and 149 by 1901. These figures, however, disguise a picture of growth and then decline, in common with many agricultural communities in the course of the nineteenth century, as employment opportunities fluctuated and finally went into long-term decline as foreign food imports competed all too successfully with British farming.

==Listed building==
There is one listed building in the village, the war memorial. This is in an enclosure on the north side of Bank End Road. It is in York stone, and consists of an obelisk on a four-sided plinth on a stepped base. The plinth has a moulded cornice and a pedimented cap, the pediment containing carving in relief. There are inscriptions on the obelisk and plinth, and on the plinth are the names of those lost in the two World Wars.

<doc id="685179" wikidata="Q1464689" url="?curid=685179" title="Schwinger's quantum action principle">
<text>The Schwinger&#x27;s quantum action principle is a variational approach to quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. This theory was introduced by Julian Schwinger in a series of articles starting 1950.

== Approach ==
In Schwinger&#x27;s approach, the action principle is targeted towards quantum mechanics. The action becomes a quantum action, i.e. an operator, formula_1. Although it is superficially different from the path integral formulation where the action is a classical function, the modern formulation of the two formalisms are identical.

Suppose we have two states defined by the values of a complete set of commuting operators at two times. Let the early and late states be formula_2 and formula_3, respectively. Suppose that there is a parameter in the Lagrangian which can be varied, usually a source for a field. The main equation of Schwinger&#x27;s quantum action principle is:

:formula_4

where the derivative is with respect to small changes (formula_5) in the parameter, and formula_6 with formula_7 the Lagrange operator.

In the path integral formulation, the transition amplitude is represented by the sum over all histories of formula_8, with appropriate boundary conditions representing the states formula_2 and formula_3. The infinitesimal change in the amplitude is clearly given by Schwinger&#x27;s formula. Conversely, starting from Schwinger&#x27;s formula, it is easy to show that the fields obey canonical commutation relations and the classical equations of motion, and so have a path integral representation. Schwinger&#x27;s formulation was most significant because it could treat fermionic anticommuting fields with the same formalism as bose fields, thus implicitly introducing differentiation and integration with respect to anti-commuting coordinates.

<doc id="685182" wikidata="Q663350" url="?curid=685182" title="Hatfield, South Yorkshire">
<text>Hatfield is a town and civil parish in the City of Doncaster in South Yorkshire, England. It had a population of 17,236 at the 2011 Census. The town is located on the A18 road between Doncaster and Scunthorpe, and to the west of the M18 motorway. It shares a railway station with Stainforth on the line between Goole and Scunthorpe, and Doncaster. Recorded history in the parish extends as far back as 730, when Bede wrote about the Northumbrian King, Edwin, being killed in battle in the area.

==History==

Hatfield (called Heathfield historically) is an ancient settlement and a palace of the Northumbrian Kingdom called Meicen, (or Meigen).

On 12 October 633 AD, King Edwin was killed in the Battle of Hatfield Chase by Penda, King of Mercia. Penda was assisted in the battle by the Welsh under the leadership of Cadwallon ap Cadfan, Welsh (British) King of Gwynedd. Osric, a possible successor to Edwin, was also killed in the battle. Edwin&#x27;s son Edfrith surrendered to Penda.

It is thought that the battle gave rise to the name of Slay Pit Lane in Hatfield, where it is rumoured that the battle took place and the bodies of soldiers lay close by.

Hatfield is mentioned in the Domesday Book as having a church, a priest, various ploughlands and plough men. The area was in the possession of William de Warenne. The name Hatfield stems from Old English (with a Scandinavian influence) of &quot;Hæþfeld&quot;; the &quot;field or open land where heather and other shrubs grew&quot;. The name was recorded by Bede as &quot;Heathfelth&quot; in 730.

Hatfield Manor House is a grade I listed building dating back to the 12th century. The site of the house was regraded as the site of the palace of Edwin, King of Northumbria. Notable visitors over the years have included Edward Balliol, Elizabeth, Countess of Ulster, John of Gaunt and Geoffrey Chaucer. The Anglican St Lawrence&#x27;s Church, Hatfield was built around the same time as the manor house.

In 1629, Charles I sold almost of Hatfield Chase to a Dutch engineer, Cornelius Vermuyden who sold tracts of the land to other parties and spent £400,000 draining the chase and reclaiming the land. Of the land, one third was awarded to Vermuyden, one third went too the crown and the remaining third was given to the local population as common land.

The parish of Hatfield was originally in the wapentake of Lower Strafforth and in the county of the West Riding of Yorkshire. It was moved in the county boundary changes of 1974, into South Yorkshire. The population of the parish at the 2001 census was 16,164, which had risen to 17,236 at the 2011 census.

There is an outdoor water activity centre to the north-east of the town, and two prisons, Hatfield Main and Hatfield Lakes, across the M18 to the east. HMP Lindholme is to the south-east of the town built on the former site of RAF Lindholme.

==Geography==
Hatfield is located within the historic boundaries of the West Riding of Yorkshire on the border of Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, on the A18 road between Doncaster and Scunthorpe. The A1146 connects Hatfield with Thorne. The town is bisected by the M18 motorway. Junctions 4 and 5 of the M18, and Junction 1 of the M180 motorway are all within the parish. Hatfield is part of the parliamentary constituency of Don Valley.

Hatfield parish contains the following villages:

Dunscroft lies on the A18 road, about from the centre of Doncaster. There is Sheep Dip Lane primary school. The church is dedicated to St Edwin, however, it is intended to amalgamate the ecclesiastical parishes of Dunscroft and Hatfield and close St Edwin&#x27;s Church.

Dunsville lies on the A18 road, about from the centre of Doncaster.

Hatfield lies on the A18 road, about from the centre of Doncaster. It is served by the Hatfield and Stainforth railway station in Stainforth and Thorne. Hatfield has numerous public houses, including &quot;The Bay Horse&quot;, &quot;The Hatfield Chase&quot;, &quot;Hatfields&quot;, &quot;The Blue Bell&quot;, &quot;The Ingram Arms&quot; and &quot;The Green Tree&quot;. The original building known as &quot;the Abbey&quot; or &quot;Dunscroft Grange&quot; was demolished in 1966–7. For the final twenty years, this building was owned by Mr Harry Lewis. The old Abbey was possibly a dormitory to Roche Abbey at Maltby. It had to be demolished because the 12th-century masonry and stonework were unstable. The main school for the area is Ash Hill Academy. There is the Travis St. Lawrence Church of England Primary School, and Hatfield Crookesbroom primary school.

Hatfield Woodhouse (&quot;House in the Hatfield Wood&quot;), is a small, semi-rural village which lies on the A614 road, about from the centre of Doncaster.

Hatfield Woodhouse also gave rise to RAF Hatfield Woodhouse two miles south of the village. The airfield was later named RAF Lindholme.

Recently an application has been proposed to allow the demolition of the pub and several flats to be built in its place. This application has recently been denied due to rallies by locals to have the plans rejected. There is the Hatfield Woodhouse primary school, which was rated as being &quot;Good&quot; by Ofsted in 2019.
Lindholme (&quot;Lime-tree island&quot;, () is a somewhat isolated community on the site of RAF Lindholme. It is close to Hatfield Moors nature reserve as well as to three prisons (HMP Hatfield Lakes, HMP Lindholme and HMP Moorland).

West End is a small village to the south-west of Hatfield Woodhouse.

==Transport==

The A18 road runs through the eastern part of Hatfield town, with the M18 and M180 motorways in the east of the parish. A proposal exists to develop land adjacent to the west side of Junction 5 on the M18, to a mixed development of housing and warehousing space known as &quot;Unity Park&quot;. The development, which is projected to involve housing, a marina and a new school, has led to the creation of a new link road from Junction 5 to Waggons Way in Stainforth. Junction 5 also has a motorway service area (MSA) known as &quot;Doncaster North&quot;, run by Moto.

A railway from Doncaster to Thorne first arrived in July 1856 with the station being labelled simply as &quot;Stainforth&quot;. It was replaced by a newer station called &quot;Hatfield and Stainforth&quot; in October 1866.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire Television signals are received from the Emley Moor TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Sheffield, Heart Yorkshire, Capital Yorkshire, Hits Radio South Yorkshire, Greatest Hits Radio Yorkshire, TX1 Radio and TMCR 95.3, a community based radio station which broadcast from its studios in Thorne. 

The town is served by these local newspapers, &quot;Doncaster Free Press&quot; and &quot;Thorne Times&quot;.

<text>Wolfgang Borchert (; 20 May 1921 – 20 November 1947) was a German author and playwright whose work was strongly influenced by his experience of dictatorship and his service in the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; during the Second World War. His work is among the best-known examples of the Trümmerliteratur movement in post-World War II Germany. His most famous work is the drama &quot;Draußen vor der Tür&quot; &quot;(The Man Outside)&quot;, which he wrote soon after the end of World War II. His works are uncompromising on the issues of humanity and humanism. He is one of the most popular authors of the German postwar period; his work continues to be studied in German schools.

== Life ==
Borchert was born in Hamburg, the only child of teacher Fritz Borchert, who also worked for the Dada magazine &quot;Die Rote Erde&quot;, and author Hertha Borchert, who worked for the Hamburg radio and was famous for her dialect poetry. Borchert&#x27;s family was liberal and progressive, and they moved in Hamburg&#x27;s intellectual social circles. Borchert hated his compulsory time in the party&#x27;s youth wing, the Hitler Youth, from which, after missing meetings, he was released. He rebelled against the Nazi dictatorship in his prewar-works (1938–1940). In April 1940 he was arrested by the Gestapo and then released. The same year he reluctantly took up an apprenticeship at the Hamburg bookshop C. Boysen in the Große Bleichen. He would pass around anti-Nazi poems to his colleagues. While at the bookshop, Borchert took acting lessons, without, at first, telling his parents. He left the apprenticeship early in 1941. Upon passing his acting examination on 21 March 1941, he began working for the travelling repertory theatre company Landesbühne Ost-Hannover based in Lüneburg. His nascent theatrical career was cut short by his conscription into the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; in June 1941.

Borchert was posted to the Eastern Front, where he saw the full horror of the eastern conflict, witnessing the numerous casualties in battle and those sustained due to cold, starvation and inadequate equipment. On 23 February 1942, he returned from sentry duty on the Russian front missing the middle finger of his left hand. He claimed that he had surprised a Russian soldier, had engaged in hand-to-hand conflict, his rifle had gone off in the struggle and wounded him. His superior officer, accusing him of attempting to evade military service by self-mutilation, had him arrested and placed in isolation. At his trial, the military prosecutor called for the death penalty, but the court believed Borchert&#x27;s version, and he was pronounced not guilty. However, he was immediately re-arrested on charges under the &quot;Heimtückegesetz&quot; – making statements against the regime. He was convicted of making &quot;statements endangering the country&quot; and sentenced to serve a further six weeks of strict-regime detention, and was then sent back to the Eastern Front &quot;to prove himself at the front&quot;. There he suffered frostbite and several further bouts of hepatitis, after which he was granted medical leave. On leave he again acted in a night club in the now bomb-ravaged city of Hamburg. He then returned to his barracks, and successfully applied to be transferred to an army theatre group. He was transferred to a transit camp in Koblenz, but in the dormitory on the evening of 30 November 1943 he retold parodies of the Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. Borchert was denounced by one of the other soldiers in the dormitory, arrested, and on 21 August 1944 sentenced to nine months in prison. The sentence was deferred until the end of the War, so he was again returned to the army, this time mostly spending his time in his barracks in Jena, before being sent, in March 1945, to the area around Frankfurt-am-Main. His company surrendered to the French in March 1945. During their transportation to a prisoner of war camp, Borchert and others jumped off the lorry and escaped, and then he walked home to Hamburg (a distance of around 370 miles). He arrived there, totally exhausted, on 10 May, a week after Hamburg had surrendered to the British.

Following the war, Borchert&#x27;s condition continued to worsen. In 1946 one doctor told his mother he expected Borchert would not live longer than another year, but Borchert himself was never told of this prognosis. He resumed his work with the theatre, and continued writing. He wrote short prose and published a collection of poems &quot;Laterne, Nacht und Sterne&quot; &quot;(Lantern, Night and Stars)&quot; in December 1946. In December 1946 and/or January 1947 he wrote the play &quot;Draußen vor der Tür&quot; &quot;(The Man Outside)&quot;. Even before its publication the play was performed on the radio on 13 February 1947, meeting with much acclaim. Later in 1947 Borchert entered a hepatic sanitorium in the Swiss city of Basel, where he continued with short stories and wrote his manifesto against war &quot;&quot; &quot;(Then there is only one thing!)&quot; shortly before his death from liver failure.

== Poems ==
Borchert was keen on poetry from his mid-teens. Readers sensed in his poems the influence of famous poets, such as Shakespeare, Stefan George and Rainer Maria Rilke. Rilke was his role model, to the extent that he signed a work &quot;Wolff Maria Borchert&quot; to express his respect for him. He was a follower of some poets and had seen them as his source of art fulfillment, for example, when he was to join the army, he wrote that he was hungry for art, listing Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Verlaine, Musset, Schiller and Hölderlin.

Writing poetry was easier for Borchert than creating prose. His poem production rate was around five to 10 per day. His work was reviewed by his father, which Wolfgang considered as an endorsement. He was later well known for expressing himself in poems when he needed to, no matter what the outcome. Borchert&#x27;s writings indicate that he was less concerned with the quality of his work than he was fulfilled creating poems. This later came in when he joined the theater where he became an actor to better express himself. For instance, in one of his letters to Aline Bussmann he was not interested in hearing her opinion in what he wrote but rather he asked her whether the piece pleased her or not!

Borchert&#x27;s work was distributed to whoever showed interest in them; later, this helped the Gestapo arrest him along with other reasons. Even though Wolfgang&#x27;s work was widely spread, he was not satisfied with his work and thought it was more of a self-expression need that he needed to let out:

&quot;Aber ich bin seit einiger Zeit darüber, meine Gedichte für etwas Wichtiges anzusehen, das nicht verloren gehen dürfte. Wenn von den paar Tausend – so viele werden es ja allmählich sein- nur zwei – drei übrig bleiben die es wert sind, dann will ich zufrieden sein. Wenn ich aber dennoch immer welche schreibe, die oft garnichts taugen, dann nur, um sie loszuwerden – sonst nichts.&quot;

Later when Wolfgang grew up, he purified his creation by destroying many poems that were irrelevant to that time period. In Wolfgang&#x27;s eyes, what was left of his poems were not of high quality. Therefore, what survived from his poems were mostly included in his letters to Aline Bussmann, Ruth Hager, Carl Albert Lange and Hugo Seiker. Those poems were not to be published, or at least that was the intention of Borchert. However, in 1960, his mother Hertha Borchert and the American Stanley Tschopp gathered around two hundred poems to be published but that did not happen until 1996, when &quot;Allein mit meinem Schatten und dem Mond (Alone with my shadow and the moon)&quot;, a compiled selection of Wolfgang Borchert&#x27;s poems, was published.

When it comes to putting Wolfgang&#x27;s poems under the critic&#x27;s spotlight, only his later work that he endorsed publishing should be studied. This is due to the fact that his poems were mostly written for certain events or to a particular person, or occasional literature; his earlier poems were done when he was young.

From one of his longer poems:

&quot;Laterne, Nacht und Sterne:&quot;

&quot;Ich möchte Leuchtturm sein&quot;

&quot;In Nacht und Wind-&quot;

&quot;für Dorsch und Stint-&quot;

&quot;für jedes Boot-&quot;

&quot;und bin doch selbst&quot;

&quot;ein Schiff in Not!&quot;

Which translates to:

&quot;Lantern, Night and Stars:&quot;

&quot;I would like to be a lighthouse&quot;

&quot;at night and wind –&quot;

&quot;for codfish and smelt –&quot;

&quot;for any boat –&quot;

&quot;and am myself&quot;

&quot;A ship in need!&quot;

== Style and influence ==
Wolfgang Borchert’s style was not limited to his poems, but rather it was his short stories that made his style more vivid. The experience he had been through during war was a key factor in the way he expressed himself; his work reflects the trauma he went through. The preoccupations of war and post war in Borchert’s writings are the pictures he had in mind of the front from the war, the life of a prisoner during the war, the return of a soldier to a destroyed Germany and the hope for the future after devastating war. From there his writings entail abrupt and fragmented pictures. Most of what he creates is not memorable-character based, meaning, he describes people and things without the labels placed by the society or the nation. For example, he mentions men, soldiers, or widows instead of giving up characters like himself, his parents or anyone else. People felt the pain in his writing even with this anonymity and that points out a humanitarian success he achieved; reaching the people’s hearts with simplicity. The basic language he used contributed to delivering the desired message of suffering the people, and he, experienced during the war time.

His play &quot;Draußen vor der Tür,&quot; which was “a tragedy of a returning soldier”, had a hopelessly nihilistic theme. There was emphasis on how nothing was worth living for and everything was destroyed; the smell of guilt is spread everywhere, and the largest share of guilt is the God&#x27;s guilt. There was no tolerance or acceptance to fate. This describes what Borchert felt inside and how he wanted to touch the audience&#x27;s feelings. He aimed to bring up disjointed events and present them as a shattered mirror and let the audience enjoy feeling it instead of watching it. The normal style of narrating a story does not exist in Borchert&#x27;s writings due to the intensity of experience he had to go through. Instead, the reader finds Borchert&#x27;s stories divided into sections of despair, guilt, solitariness and a lack of faith and willingness. That was caused by the distracted mind, the shaken soul, and the disordered emotions initiated by the war experience.

Borchert&#x27;s work was not famous during his early days, although there were many people who liked his poems and prose works. The war gave Wolfgang&#x27;s writings an everlasting impression; it was characterized as one of the best war-literature. He employed the styles of Rainer Maria Rilke and Holderlin into his poems and short stories. Rilke tends to use metaphors, metonymy and contradictions which affected Borchert in that he utilized many metaphors in his writings such as Borchert&#x27;s short story “The Kitchen Clock”. In the story, he used the clock as a metaphor that reminds him of his mother and his lost family. It has a great resemblance to trauma-literature. Then, comes Hölderlin&#x27;s role in inspiring Borchert where Hölderlin was known for using symbols in his writings instead of labeling people and places with their known tags. And, again in “The Kitchen Clock”, Borchert uses symbols in describing characters, for example, describing the returning soldier in “The Kitchen Clock” he says:

&quot;“… He looked at his clock and shook his head pensively. No, dear sir, no, you are wrong about that. It has nothing to do with the bombs. You should not keep talking about the bombs. No. At 2:30. At night I mean. Nearly always at 2:30. That is just it…”&quot;

The character is missing here but the message he wanted to send is clear and deliverable because there are many people who had their different “Clock” after World War II and can relate to his situation. Borchert was a heavy reader and he read the product of other poets from other countries. Borchert was influenced by an American civil-war poet Walt Whitman. For example, the “&quot;Laterne, Nacht und Sterne&quot;“ written by Borchert is very similar to Whitman&#x27;s “youth, old age, and night”. They share the same images of insomnia with darkness that are mixed with cold, hunger and the long time outside standings Later in Borchert&#x27;s life, his work extended beyond the national borders as it was translated to other languages, especially English. The most famous work of Wolfgang Borchert was &quot;The Man Outside&quot;, a play that was first performed in 1947 only one day after his death. &quot;The Man Outside&quot; has the same tone as the Kitchen Clock so that it describes the return of a prisoner of war to his home. This play was first translated to English in 1952 by David Porter whose translation reduced the quality of this artistic piece. Then, Thomas Fisher, an English producer, retranslated the play and produced it to be played in London in 1998 at the Gate Theater. The translation of Borchert&#x27;s work opened up the opportunity for foreigners to further study the trauma literature which is greatly presented in his poems and short stories. In 1988, a group of people who were keen on Wolfgang Borchert work initiated the International Wolfgang-Borchert Society. The mission of the society is to promote studying Borchert&#x27;s writings to the international level.

<text>Germany Must Perish! is a 104-page book written by Theodore N. Kaufman, which he self-published in 1941 in the United States. The book advocated genocide through the sterilization of all Germans and the territorial dismemberment of Germany, believing that this would achieve world peace. 

Kaufman founded the Argyle Press in Newark, New Jersey, United States, in order to publish this book. He was the sole proprietor of the Argyle Press, which is not known to have published any other works.

The Nazi Party used the book, written by a Jewish author, to support their argument that Jews were plotting against their country.

==Contents==
Kaufman advocated the mass extermination of the German people through forced sterilization and the territorial dismemberment of Germany after an Allied victory in World War II.

Kaufman summarized &quot;Germany Must Perish!&quot; in advertisements in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;New York Post&quot; as: &quot;A dynamic volume outlining a plan for the extinction of Germany and containing a map showing possible dissection and apportionment of its territory.&quot; Kaufman defended his plan for the &quot;sterilization of all Germans&quot; in an interview published in the September 26, 1941, issue of &quot;The Canadian Jewish Chronicle&quot;:

==Reception==
===In the United States===
Although self-published, the book received considerable attention. &quot;Time&quot; magazine published a review in its 24 March issue that compared the book to Jonathan Swift&#x27;s 1729 satirical essay &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot;, which proposed reducing the population pressure in Ireland by the cannibalistic consumption of poor Irish infants. However, the &quot;Time&quot; essay recognized that Kaufman&#x27;s work was not satirical; it described the book as the &quot;enshrinement of a single sensational idea&quot;. &quot;Since Germans are the perennial disturbers of the world&#x27;s peace, says the book, they must be dealt with like any homicidal criminals. But it is unnecessary to put the whole German nation to the sword. It is more humane to sterilize them.&quot;

According to one study, reviews in the United States &quot;reflected an odd combination of straight reporting and skepticism&quot;. Kaufman&#x27;s second and more moderate pamphlet, &quot;No More German Wars&quot; published in 1942, was ignored in both the U.S. and Germany.

An advertisement in &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that the book was released to the public on March 1, 1941. Kaufman also promoted the book by mailing a miniature black cardboard coffin with a hinged lid to reviewers. Inside the coffin was a card proclaiming, &quot;Read GERMANY MUST PERISH! Tomorrow you will receive your copy.&quot;

The book&#x27;s dust jacket contained excerpts from reviews of the book. One blurb read: &quot;A Plan For Permanent Peace Among Civilized Nations! -- New York Times.&quot;

Kaufman&#x27;s book was cited by a prominent Jewish-American trial lawyer, Louis Nizer. In his 1944 book &quot;What To Do With Germany&quot;, Nizer accepted the collective punishment of Germans and considered, though ultimately rejected, their mass &quot;eugenic sterilization&quot;.

In 1945, a Jewish journalist wrote an article claiming that the book was &quot;little more than self-indulgence in dire vituperation by a man who sees Germany as the sole cause of the world&#x27;s woes&quot;.

===In Germany===
Kaufman was a Manhattan-born Jew and his advocacy of genocide attracted great attention in Germany. The book was denounced in Germany as an &quot;orgy of Jewish hatred&quot;, and it was seen as inspired by United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s supposed polemical anti-German agitation. American journalist Howard K. Smith was in Germany when &quot;Germany Must Perish!&quot; became known. He wrote:
In September 1941, Julius Streicher published an essay in &quot;Der Stürmer&quot; that called Kaufman&#x27;s book &quot;the crazy thinking of [an] insane Jewish brain&quot;. He quoted Kaufman at length and then commented: &quot;By destroying the German people, the Jew wants to stop up the spring from which, since the beginning, the world has always found its creative blood, the source of all that is beautiful, good and noble.&quot; Joseph Goebbels also gave a radio address from Berlin warning Germans of &quot;plans &#x27;for sterilization of our entire population under 60 years&#x27; of age&quot;. These concerns were echoed by Adolf Hitler himself after the US entered World War II; he claimed mass sterilization of German male youth was a &quot;primary&quot; American goal.

When the Jews of Hanover were evicted on September 8, 1941, the local authorities cited Kaufman&#x27;s book as one of the reasons. Kaufman responded:
The book appeared in many pieces of Nazi propaganda. The &quot;Parole der Woche&quot; weekly wall newspaper included it as evidence that the Allies&#x27; war aims included the destruction of Germany. The pamphlet &quot;The War Goal of World Plutocracy&quot; detailed the contents of the book, although with some omissions from the text that it quoted. It was used in 1944 in a pamphlet, &quot;Never!&quot;, which described Kaufman&#x27;s importance:
At his Nuremberg trial, Julius Streicher cited Kaufman&#x27;s book in his defense, claiming his anger at Jews was prompted by &quot;Germany Must Perish!&quot;. The German philosopher and historian Ernst Nolte argues that the German reaction to &quot;Germany Must Perish!&quot; supports his contention that World War II was a genuine response to German fears of a worldwide Jewish plot.

<text>Roland Emmerich (; born 10 November 1955) is a German-American filmmaker. Emmerich is widely known for his science fiction and disaster films and has been called a &quot;master of disaster&quot; within the movie industry. His films, most of which are English-language Hollywood productions, have made more than $3 billion worldwide, including just over $1 billion in the United States, making him the 17th-highest-grossing Hollywood director of all time.

Emmerich began his work in the film industry by directing the film &quot;The Noah&#x27;s Ark Principle&quot; (1984) as part of his university thesis and also co-founded Centropolis Entertainment in 1985 with his sister. He has subsequently directed the films &quot;Universal Soldier&quot; (1992), &quot;Stargate&quot; (1994), &quot;Independence Day&quot; (1996), &quot;Godzilla&quot; (1998), &quot;The Patriot&quot; (2000), &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; (2004), &quot;10,000 BC&quot; (2008), &quot;2012&quot; (2009), &quot;White House Down&quot; (2013), &quot;Stonewall&quot; (2015), &quot;Independence Day: Resurgence&quot; (2016), &quot;Midway&quot; (2019), and &quot;Moonfall&quot; (2022).

==Early life and career==
Emmerich was born in Stuttgart, West Germany, and grew up in the nearby town of Sindelfingen. As a youth, he traveled extensively throughout Europe and North America on vacations financed by his father, Hans, the wealthy founder of a garden machinery production company. In 1977, he began attending University of Television and Film Munich with the intention of studying to become a production designer. After watching &quot;Star Wars&quot;, he instead decided to enroll in the school&#x27;s film director program. Required to create a short film as his final thesis in 1981, he wrote and directed the full-length feature &quot;The Noah&#x27;s Ark Principle&quot;, which was screened as the opening film of the 34th Berlin International Film Festival in 1984.

In 1985, he founded Centropolis Film Productions (now Centropolis Entertainment) in partnership with his sister, producer Ute Emmerich, and directed his major film debut, a fantasy feature named &quot;Joey&quot;. He subsequently directed the 1987 comedy &quot;Hollywood-Monster&quot; and the 1990 science-fiction film &quot;Moon 44&quot;. Theatrically, these were only released in and nearby his native country, although Emmerich filmed them in English and went against conventional German styles in an attempt to appeal to a larger market. This subsequently resulted in &quot;Moon 44&quot; being released direct-to-video in the U.S. in early 1991. &quot;Joey&quot; and &quot;Hollywood-Monster&quot; eventually also saw home video releases in the U.S. (as &quot;Making Contact&quot; and &quot;Ghost Chase&quot;, respectively) once Emmerich achieved more prominence in America.

==Hollywood director==

===1990s===
Producer Mario Kassar invited Emmerich to come to the United States to direct a futuristic action film entitled &quot;Isobar&quot;. Dean Devlin, who appeared in &quot;Moon 44&quot;, soon joined Emmerich as his writing and producing partner, and served in this capacity until 2000. Emmerich subsequently refused the offer to direct after producers rejected Devlin&#x27;s re-write of the script, and the &quot;Isobar&quot; project was eventually scrapped. Instead, Emmerich was hired to replace director Andrew Davis for the action movie &quot;Universal Soldier&quot;. The film was released in 1992.

Emmerich next helmed the 1994 science-fiction film &quot;Stargate&quot;. At the time, it set a record for the highest-grossing opening weekend for a film released in the month of October. It became more commercially successful than most film industry insiders had anticipated, and spawned a highly popular media franchise.

Emmerich then directed &quot;Independence Day&quot;, an alien invasion feature, released in 1996, that became the first film to gross $100 million in less than a week and went on to become one of the most financially successful films of all time, at one point having been the second-highest-grossing film in terms of worldwide box office. Emmerich and Devlin then created the television series &quot;The Visitor&quot;, which aired on the Fox Network during 1997–1998 before being cancelled after one season.

His next film, &quot;Godzilla&quot;, opened in 1998. An extensive advertising and marketing campaign generated significant hype during the months leading up to the film&#x27;s release. The film was a box office success but was met with negative reviews from critics and fans. It garnered a Saturn Award for Best Special Effects, a BMI Film Music Award, and the Audience Award for Best Director at the European Film Awards while also receiving a Razzie Award for Worst Remake or Sequel. It has only a 16% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Emmerich said that prior to getting involved with &quot;Godzilla&quot; he and Devlin had planned a disaster movie centered around an asteroid fall, which wound up cancelled after &quot;Armageddon&quot; went for a similar idea.

===2000s===
Taking a short break from science-fiction, Emmerich next directed the American Revolutionary War epic &quot;The Patriot&quot; (2000). One of only five films (&quot;Universal Soldier&quot;, &quot;Anonymous&quot;, &quot;White House Down&quot;, and &quot;Midway&quot; being the others) Emmerich has directed in which he did not contribute to the screenplay, the film received a generally favorable critical and commercial response, and is Emmerich&#x27;s best-reviewed film to date. After teaming up with new screenwriting partner Harald Kloser, Emmerich returned once again to directing a visual effects-laden adventure with 2004&#x27;s blockbuster &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot;, another disaster film about a rapidly oncoming ice age brought upon by the effects of global warming. Soon afterward, he founded Reelmachine, another film production company based in Germany.

In 2008, Emmerich directed &quot;10,000 BC&quot;, a film about the journeys of a prehistoric tribe of mammoth hunters. It was a box office hit, but consistently regarded by professional critics as his worst film, as well as one of the worst films of the year. He was slated to direct a remake of the 1966 science-fiction film &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot;, but he eventually left project, due to clashing with its producer James Cameron. In 2009, Emmerich directed &quot;2012&quot;, an apocalyptic disaster film based on the conspiracy theory that the ancient Mayans prophesied the world&#x27;s ending on 21 December 2012. Despite mixed reviews, the film went on to be his second-highest-grossing film to date (after &quot;Independence Day&quot;) and received praise from audiences. Emmerich usually finishes production of a large-scale movie both in a time frame shorter and on a budget lower than what is typically requested by other directors.

===2010s===
Emmerich&#x27;s next film, &quot;Anonymous&quot;, released on 28 October 2011, is based on the premise that Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford is the real author of the plays and sonnets of William Shakespeare. According to Emmerich, &quot;It&#x27;s an historical thriller because it&#x27;s about who will succeed Queen Elizabeth and the struggle of the people who want to have a hand in it. It&#x27;s the Tudors on one side and the Cecils on the other, and in between [the two] is the Queen. Through that story we tell how the plays written by the Earl of Oxford ended up labelled &#x27;William Shakespeare.&#x27;&quot; The film&#x27;s box-office failures signaled a decline of Emmerich&#x27;s career.

In 2011, Sony Pictures had purchased a pitch for Emmerich&#x27;s project &quot;Singularity&quot;, a sci-fi epic about a man composed of nanomachines. Originally planned for a 2013 release, the project has since gone into development hell.

Emmerich directed the action-thriller film &quot;White House Down&quot;, which involved a terrorist attack on the White House by a paramilitary group. The spec script was written by James Vanderbilt and was purchased by Sony Pictures for in March 2012. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; called it &quot;one of the biggest spec sales in quite a while&quot;. The journal said the script was similar &quot;tonally and thematically&quot; to the films &quot;Die Hard&quot;, &quot;Air Force One&quot; and &quot;Olympus Has Fallen&quot; (2013). Emmerich began filming in July 2012 at the La Cité Du Cinéma in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The film was released on 28 June 2013 in the United States.

Whenever asked about making a personal project, Emmerich thought it would be &quot;a gay film&quot;, and after friends during production of &quot;Anonymous&quot; asked if he could make a film on the Stonewall riots, Emmerich got interested in the idea. &quot;Stonewall&quot; was released in 2015. He followed it with a sequel to his most successful film in &quot;Independence Day: Resurgence&quot;, released twenty years after the original &quot;Independence Day&quot; on 24 June 2016.

In November 2019, Emmerich directed the film &quot;Midway&quot; based on the battle of Midway during the Pacific Theater of World War II.

===2020s===
In 2020, it was announced that Emmerich&#x27;s next film project would be entitled &quot;Moonfall&quot;, released in 2022 by Lionsgate. The project is a space disaster film about a mysterious force knocking the moon from its orbit around Earth, sending it on a collision course with the planet. In response, a ragtag team launches a last-ditch mission to land on the lunar surface and save Earth from annihilation. with the production budget standing at $150 million.

===Future projects===
Following the release of &quot;Moonfall&quot;, Emmerich said he has been working on a TV series based on T. E. Lawrence for around a decade, and stated he has three projects he would like to make, a mistaken identity period piece set in 1919 about a young writer having to take control of a film set, another about a conquistador, and a third about the death of Marilyn Monroe.

In June 2023, Emmerich announced a franchise titled &quot;Space Nation&quot; which will consist of a MMORPG, a TV series, animated shorts and spinoff games.

==Personal life and advocacy==
Emmerich owns homes in Los Angeles, New York City, London and Stuttgart. He likes to decorate his homes in a self-described &quot;outlandish&quot; manner, adorning them with rare Hollywood memorabilia, murals and portraits of dictators and Communist figures, and World War II militaria.

Emmerich is gay and is a LGBT rights activist. He is married to Omar De Soto. He has stated that he witnessed overt racism when producers and studio executives were opposed to allowing him to cast Will Smith for the lead in &quot;Independence Day&quot;, and reluctant to allow him to portray an interracial couple in &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot;. He has also stated that he has encountered homophobia from the same groups, and is vocal in his opposition to such behavior. He has stated that sometimes he does &quot;[not like working in] the movie business&quot;, describing it as a sometimes &quot;very cold, brutal business&quot;, but his motivation to keep directing is that he genuinely &quot;like[s] making movies&quot;.

In 2006, he pledged $150,000 to the Legacy Project, a campaign dedicated to gay and lesbian film preservation. Emmerich made the donation on behalf of Outfest, making it the largest gift in the festival&#x27;s history. In 2007, on behalf of the LGBT community, he held a fundraiser at his Los Angeles home for Democratic Party presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

In 2011, he became a U.S. citizen while keeping his German citizenship. He stated he did so because he &quot;wanted to have a vote in the next US elections&quot; and that he waited because he &quot;didn’t want to become an American under Bush.&quot;

He is a collector of art. Emmerich&#x27;s extensive collection of artwork includes a painting of Jesus Christ wearing a Katharine Hamnett-styled T-shirt during his crucifixion, prints of Alison Jackson&#x27;s works of a Princess Diana lookalike making obscene gestures and engaging in sex acts, a wax sculpture of Pope John Paul II laughing as he reads his own obituary, and a Photoshopped image of Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in a homoerotic pose. Emmerich, a financial supporter of U.S. progressive politics, states that the decorations and pieces are not declarations of any beliefs, but rather reflections of his &quot;predilection for art with a political edge&quot;.

Emmerich is in favor of the campaign for stunt performers to receive recognition at the Academy Awards, and has worked to raise awareness over the issue of global warming. He once was a chain-smoker who was known to smoke as many as four packs of cigarettes a day, Emmerich has often included in his films characters who are trying to quit smoking or warn against the dangers of tobacco use. Along with several other celebrities, he is a producer of &quot;The 1 Second Film&quot;, a non-profit project intended to raise money for women&#x27;s rights in the developing world.

==Filmography==
In addition to film, Emmerich also co-created and produced the short-lived television series &quot;The Visitor&quot;, and, in 2001, directed a one-minute commercial titled &quot;Infinite Possibilities&quot; for DaimlerChrysler.

==Critical reception==
Reviewers often criticize Emmerich&#x27;s films for relying heavily on visual effects and suffering from clichéd dialogue, flimsy and formulaic narratives, numerous scientific and historical inaccuracies, illogical plot developments, and lack of character depth. Emmerich contends that he is not discouraged by such criticism and that he aims to provide enjoyable &quot;popcorn&quot; entertainment to movie-going audiences. Stating that he is &quot;a filmmaker, not a scientist&quot;, he creates his own fiction based on actual science or history to make the messages he sends &quot;more exciting&quot;.

In response to accusations of insensitivity for including scenes of New York City being destroyed in &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot;, less than three years after the September 11 attacks, Emmerich said that it was necessary to depict the event as a means to showcase the increased unity people now have when facing a disaster, because of the attacks. When accused of resorting too often to scenes of cities being subjected to epic disasters, Emmerich says that it is a justified way of increasing awareness about both global warming, and the lack of a government preparation plan for a global doomsday scenario in the cases of &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;2012&quot;, respectively.

Acknowledging what he characterized as flaws with &quot;Godzilla&quot;, Emmerich admitted he regretted having agreed to direct it. He stated that his lack of interest in the previous Godzilla movies, the short time he promised it would take for him to complete the film, and the studio&#x27;s refusal to screen it for test audiences were all factors that may have negatively affected the quality of the final product, and cited the former reason as to why he turned down an offer to direct &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, as he was not interested in comic books or superhero-related fiction. However, Emmerich still defends &quot;Godzilla&quot;, noting that the film was highly profitable and claiming that, of all his movies, people tell him &quot;Godzilla&quot; is the one they and their kids watch the most repeatedly.

Emmerich has also faced criticism from the LGBT community. His film &quot;Stonewall&quot; was criticized for being whitewashed and diminishing the contributions of transgender women of color to starting the Stonewall riots, and for being sex-negative. In response to these claims, Emmerich has said the Stonewall riots were &quot;a white event&quot;. The film received generally negative reviews from critics.

Similarly, Emmerich touted his 2016 film &quot;Independence Day: Resurgence&quot; as having a gay couple, but when the film was released, Johnny Gayzmonic of &quot;Unicorn Booty&quot; criticized the film because the couple in question was two trivial characters lacking in believable chemistry who were utilized solely for comic relief, one of whom was needlessly killed off in a way that was not vital to the plot (the other having been depicted as strictly heterosexual in tie-in material to the first film), the characters only being revealed to have been a gay couple during the aforementioned death scene (with references to their relationship being cut from the Chinese version of the film), a fate that Gayzmonic observed befell many gay couples in film.

<doc id="685190" wikidata="Q1048945" url="?curid=685190" title="Comparison of C Sharp and Java">
<text>This article compares two programming languages: C# with Java. While the focus of this article is mainly the languages and their features, such a comparison will necessarily also consider some features of platforms and libraries.

C# and Java are similar languages that are typed statically, strongly, and manifestly. Both are object-oriented, and designed with semi-interpretation or runtime just-in-time compilation, and both are curly brace languages, like C and C++.

== Types ==
=== Unified type system ===
Both languages are statically typed with class-based object orientation. In Java the primitive types are special in that they are not object-oriented and they could not have been defined using the language itself. They also do not share a common ancestor with reference types. The Java reference types all derive from a common root type. C# has a unified type system in which all types (besides unsafe pointers) ultimately derive from a common root type. Consequently, all types implement the methods of this root type, and extension methods defined for the type apply to all types, even primitive literals and delegates. This allows C#, unlike Java, to support objects with encapsulation that are not reference types.

In Java, compound types are synonymous with reference types; methods cannot be defined for a type unless it is also a &quot;class&quot; reference type. In C# the concepts of encapsulation and methods have been decoupled from the reference requirement so that a type can support methods and encapsulation without being a reference type. Only reference types support virtual methods and specialization, however.

Both languages support many built-in types that are copied and passed by value rather than by reference. Java calls these types primitive types, while they are called &quot;simple types&quot; in C#. The primitive/simple types typically have native support from the underlying processor architecture.

The C# simple types implement several interfaces and consequently offer many methods directly on instances of the types, even on the literals. The C# type names are also merely &quot;aliases&quot; for Common Language Runtime (CLR) types. The C# type is exactly the same type as the type; the only difference is that the former is the canonical .NET name, while the latter is a C# alias for it.

Java does not offer methods directly on primitive types. Instead, methods that operate on primitive values are offered through companion primitive wrapper classes. A fixed set of such wrapper classes exist, each of which wraps one of the fixed set of primitive types. As an example, the Java type is a reference type that wraps the primitive type. They are &quot;not&quot; the same type, however.

=== Data types ===
==== Numeric types ====
===== Signed integers =====
Both Java and C# support signed integers with bit widths of 8, 16, 32 and 64 bits. They use the same name/aliases for the types, except for the 8-bit integer that is called a in Java and a (signed byte) in C#.

===== Unsigned integers =====
C# supports unsigned in addition to the signed integer types. The unsigned types are , , and for 8, 16, 32 and 64 bit widths, respectively. Unsigned arithmetic operating on the types are supported as well. For example, adding two unsigned integers (s) still yields a as a result; not a long or signed integer.

Java does not feature unsigned integer types. In particular, Java lacks a primitive type for an unsigned byte. Instead, Java&#x27;s type is sign extended, which is a common source of bugs and confusion.

Unsigned integers were left out of Java deliberately because James Gosling believed that programmers would not understand how unsigned arithmetic works.In programming language design, one of the standard problems is that the language grows so complex that nobody can understand it. One of the little experiments I tried was asking people about the rules for unsigned arithmetic in C. It turns out nobody understands how unsigned arithmetic in C works. There are a few obvious things that people understand, but many people don&#x27;t understand it.

Java versions 8 and 9 added some limited built-in unsigned integer operations, but they are only exposed as static methods on the primitive wrapper classes; they operate on signed primitive integer types, treating them as if they were unsigned.

===== High-precision decimal numbers =====
C# has a type and literal notation for high-precision (28 decimal digits) decimal arithmetic that is appropriate for financial and monetary calculations. Contrary to the and data types, decimal fractional numbers such as 0.1 can be represented exactly in the decimal representation. In the float and double representations, such numbers often have non-terminating binary expansions, making those representations more prone to round-off errors.

While Java lacks such a built-in type, the Java library does feature an &quot;arbitrary precision&quot; decimal type. This is not considered a language type and it does not support the usual arithmetic operators; rather it is a reference type that must be manipulated using the type methods. See more about arbitrary-size/precision numbers below.

==== Advanced numeric types ====
Both languages offer library-defined arbitrary-precision arithmetic types for arbitrary-size integers and decimal point calculations.

Only Java has a data type for arbitrary precision decimal point calculations. Only C# has a type for working with complex numbers.

In both languages, the number of operations that can be performed on the advanced numeric types is limited compared to the built-in IEEE 754 floating point types. For instance, none of the arbitrary-size types support square root or logarithms.

C# allows library-defined types to be integrated with existing types and operators by using custom implicit/explicit conversions and operator overloading. See example in section &quot;Integration of library-defined types&quot;

==== Characters ====
Both languages feature a native (character) datatype as a simple type. Although the type can be used with bit-wise operators, this is performed by promoting the value to an integer value before the operation. Thus, the result of a bitwise operation is a numeric type, not a character, in both languages.

==== Built-in compound data types ====
Both languages treat strings as (immutable) objects of reference type. In both languages, the type contains several methods to manipulate strings, parse, format, etc. In both languages regular expressions are considered an external feature and are implemented in separate classes.

Both languages&#x27; libraries define classes for working with dates, times, time zones, and calendars in different cultures. Java provides , a mutable reference type with millisecond precision, and (since Java 8) the package (including classes such as , , and for date-only, time-only, and date-and-time values), a set of immutable reference types with nanosecond precision. In contrast, the C# is an immutable struct value type for date-and-time information with 100-nanosecond precision; the .NET 6 API also added and , similar structures for date-only or time-only operations. C# additionally defines a type for working with time periods; Java 8 provides the class for the same purpose. Both languages support date and time arithmetic according to different cultures and time zones.

=== User-defined value type (struct) ===
C# allows the programmer to create user-defined value types, using the keyword. Unlike classes and like the standard primitives, such value types are passed and assigned by value rather than by reference. They can also be part of an object (either as a field or boxed), or stored in an array without the memory indirection that normally exists for class types.

Because value types have no notion of a value and can be used in arrays without initialization, they always come with an implicit default constructor that essentially fills the struct memory space with zeroes. The programmer can only define additional constructors with one or more arguments. Value types do not have virtual method tables, and because of that (and the fixed memory footprint), they are implicitly sealed. However, value types &quot;can&quot; (and frequently do) implement interfaces. For example, the built-in integer types implement several interfaces.

Apart from the built-in primitive types, Java does not include the concept of value types.

=== Enumerations ===
Both languages define enumerations, but they are implemented in fundamentally different ways. As such, enumerations are one area where tools designed to automatically translate code between the two languages (such as Java to C# converters) fail.

C# has implemented enumerations in a manner similar to C, that is as wrappers around the bit-flags implemented in primitive integral types (int, byte, short, etc.). This has performance benefits and improves interaction with C/C++ compiled code, but provides fewer features and can lead to bugs if low-level value types are directly cast to an enumeration type, as is allowed in the C# language. Therefore, it is seen as syntactic sugar. In contrast, Java implements enumerations as full featured collection of instances, requiring more memory and not aiding interaction with C/C++ code, but providing additional features in reflection and intrinsic behavior. The implementation in each language is described in the table below.

In both C# and Java, programmers can use enumerations in a switch statement without conversion to a string or primitive integer type. However, C# disallows implicit fall-through unless the case statement does not contain any code, as it is a common cause of hard-to-find bugs. Fall-through must be explicitly declared using a goto statement.

=== Delegates, method references ===
C# implements object-oriented method pointers in the form of delegates. A delegate is a special type that can capture a reference to a method. This reference can then be stored in a delegate-type variable or passed to a method through a delegate parameter for later invocation. C# delegates support covariance and contravariance, and can hold a reference to any signature-compatible static method, instance method, anonymous method or lambda expression.

Delegates should not be confused with closures and inline functions. The concepts are related because a reference to a closure/inline function must be captured in a delegate reference to be useful at all. But a delegate does not always reference an inline function; it can also reference existing static or instance methods. Delegates form the basis of C# events, but should not be confused with those either.

Delegates were deliberately left out of Java because they were considered unnecessary and detrimental to the language, and because of potential performance issues. Instead, alternative mechanisms are used. The wrapper pattern, which resembles the delegates of C# in that it allows the client to access one or more client-defined methods through a known interface, is one such mechanism. Another is the use of adapter objects using inner classes, which the designers of Java argued are a better solution than bound method references.

See also example C# delegates and equivalent Java constructs.

=== Lifted (nullable) types ===
C# allows value/primitive/simple types to be &quot;lifted&quot; to allow the special value in addition to the type&#x27;s native values. A type is lifted by adding a suffix to the type name; this is equivalent to using the generic type, where is the type to be lifted. Conversions are implicitly defined to convert between values of the base and the lifted type. The lifted type can be compared against or it can be tested for . Also, lifted operators are implicitly and automatically defined based on their non-lifted base, where – with the exception of some Boolean operators – a null argument will propagate to the result.

Java does not support type lifting as a concept, but all of the built-in primitive types have corresponding wrapper types, which do support the value by virtue of being reference types (classes).

According to the Java spec, any attempt to dereference the reference must result in an exception being thrown at run-time, specifically a . (It would not make sense to dereference it otherwise, because, by definition, it points to no object in memory.) This also applies when attempting to unbox a variable of a wrapper type, which evaluates to : the program will throw an exception, because there is no object to be unboxed – and thus no boxed value to take part in the subsequent computation.

The following example illustrates the different behavior. In C#, the lifted*operator propagates the value of the operand; in Java, unboxing the null reference throws an exception.

Not all C# lifted operators have been defined to propagate unconditionally, if one of the operands is . Specifically, the Boolean operators have been lifted to support ternary logic thus keeping impedance with SQL.

The Java Boolean operators do not support ternary logic, nor is it implemented in the base class library.

=== Late-bound (dynamic) type ===
C# features a late bound dynamic type that supports no-reflection dynamic invocation, interoperability with dynamic languages, and ad-hoc binding to (for example) document object models. The type resolves member access dynamically at runtime as opposed to statically/virtual at compile time. The member lookup mechanism is extensible with traditional reflection as a fall-back mechanism.

There are several use cases for the type in C#:
* Less verbose use of reflection: By casting an instance to the type, members such as properties, methods, events etc. can be directly invoked on the instance without using the reflection API directly.
* Interoperability with dynamic languages: The dynamic type comes with a hub-and-spoke support for implementing dynamically typed objects and common runtime infrastructure for efficient member lookup.
* Creating dynamic abstractions on the fly: For instance, a dynamic object could provide simpler access to document object models such as XML or XHTML documents.

Java does not support a late-bound type. The use cases for C# dynamic type have different corresponding constructs in Java:
* For dynamic late-bound &quot;by-name&quot; invocation of preexisting types, reflection should be used.
* For interoperability with dynamic languages, some form of interoperability API specific to that language must be used. The Java virtual machine platform does have multiple dynamic languages implemented on it, but there is no common standard for how to pass objects between languages. Usually this involves some form of reflection or reflection-like API. As an example of how to use JavaFX objects from Java.
* For creating and interacting with objects entirely at runtime, e.g., interaction with a document object model abstraction, a specific abstraction API must be used.

See also example #Interoperability with dynamic languages.

=== Pointers ===
Java precludes pointers and pointer-arithmetic within the Java runtime environment. The Java language designers reasoned that pointers are one of the main features that enable programmers to put bugs in their code and chose not to support them. Java does not allow for directly passing and receiving objects/structures to/from the underlying operating system and thus does not need to model objects/structures to such a specific memory layout, layouts that frequently would involve pointers. Java&#x27;s communication with the underlying operating system is instead based upon Java Native Interface (JNI) where communication with/adaptation to an underlying operating system is handled through an external &quot;glue&quot; layer.

While C# does allow use of pointers and corresponding pointer arithmetic, the C# language designers had the same concerns that pointers could potentially be used to bypass the strict rules for object access. Thus, C# by default also precludes pointers. However, because pointers are needed when calling many native functions, pointers are allowed in an explicit &quot;unsafe&quot; mode. Code blocks or methods that use the pointers must be marked with the keyword to be able to use pointers, and the compiler requires the switch to allow compiling such code. Assemblies that are compiled using the switch are marked as such and may only execute if explicitly trusted. This allows using pointers and pointer arithmetic to directly pass and receive objects to/from the operating system or other native APIs using the native memory layout for those objects while also isolating such potentially unsafe code in specifically trusted assemblies.

=== Reference types ===
In both languages references are a central concept. All instances of classes are &quot;by reference&quot;.

While not directly evident in the language syntax &quot;per se&quot;, both languages support the concept of &quot;weak&quot; references. An instance that is only referenced by weak references is eligible for garbage collection just as if there were no references at all. In both languages this feature is exposed through the associated libraries, even though it is really a core runtime feature.

Along with weak references, Java has &quot;soft references&quot;. They are much like weak references, but the Java virtual machine (JVM) will not deallocate softly-referenced objects until the memory is needed.

=== Arrays and collections ===
Arrays and collections are concepts featured by both languages.
The syntax used to declare and access arrays is identical, except that C# has added syntax for declaring and manipulating multidimensional arrays.
Multidimensional arrays can in some cases increase performance because of increased locality (as there is one pointer dereference instead of one for every dimension of the array, as it is the case for jagged arrays). However, since all array element access in a multidimensional array requires multiplication/shift between the two or more dimensions, this is an advantage only in very random access scenarios.

Another difference is that the entire multidimensional array can be allocated with a single application of operator , while jagged arrays require loops and allocations for every dimension. However, Java provides a syntactic construct for allocating a jagged array with regular lengths; the loops and multiple allocations are then performed by the virtual machine and need not be explicit at the source level.

Both languages feature an extensive set of collection types that includes various ordered and unordered types of lists, maps/dictionaries, sets, etc.

=== Tuples ===
C# provides two different methods for creating tuple types (also known as product types). The first is via the classes, which are immutable reference types provided by the framework API (starting with .NET Framework 4.0) for creating generic tuple types. This first method has since been effectively superseded by the second, the structs, which are mutable value types provided by the framework API (starting with .NET Framework 4.7).

While the two methods seem superficially similar, they have multiple notable differences. The types are value types, so they have a more compact memory footprint; also, the types expose their contents as mutable fields, compared to the immutable properties of the classes. Finally, since C# version 7.0, the language has native syntactical support for the construction, deconstruction, and manipulation of tuples as instances; this also provides for the arbitrary renaming of the tuples&#x27; constituent fields (as opposed to , where the fields are always named , , etc.).

Java does not provide tuple types as part of its language or standard API; numerous third-party libraries exist which can provide tuple types, but they all are necessarily similar to the C# classes. In comparison to C# types and their associated syntax, they are more unwieldy to use (requiring the explicit use of constructors or static factory methods for creating them, requiring individual member access to deconstruct them, and having fixed names for their elements).

== Expressions and operators ==
===Boxing and unboxing===
Both languages allow automatic boxing and unboxing, i.e. they allow for implicit casting between any primitive types and the corresponding reference types.

In C#, the primitive types are subtypes of the Object type. In Java this is not true; any given primitive type and the corresponding wrapper type have no specific relationship with each other, except for autoboxing and unboxing, which act as syntactic sugar for interchanging between them. This was done intentionally, to maintain backward compatibility with prior versions of Java, in which no automatic casting was allowed, and the programmer worked with two separate sets of types: the primitive types, and the wrapper (reference) type hierarchy.

This difference has the following consequences. First of all, in C#, primitive types can define methods, such as an override of Object&#x27;s method. In Java, this task is accomplished by the primitive wrapper classes.

Secondly, in Java an extra cast is needed whenever one tries to directly dereference a primitive value, as it will not be boxed automatically. The expression will convert an integer literal to string in Java while performs the same operation in C#. This is because the latter one is an instance call on the primitive value , while the former one is an instance call on an object of type .

Finally, another difference is that Java makes heavy use of boxed types in generics (see below).

==Statements==
== Syntax ==
Both languages are considered &quot;curly brace&quot; languages in the C/C++ family. Overall the syntaxes of the languages are very similar. The syntax at the statement and expression level is almost identical with obvious inspiration from the C/C++ tradition. At type definition level (classes and interfaces) some minor differences exist. Java is explicit about extending classes and implementing interfaces, while C# infers this from the kind of types a new class/interface derives from.

C# supports more features than Java, which to some extent is also evident in the syntax that specifies more keywords and more grammar rules than Java.

=== Keywords and backward compatibility ===
As the languages evolved, the language designers for both languages have faced situations where they wanted to extend the languages with new keywords or syntax. New keywords in particular may break existing code at source level, i.e. older code may no longer compile, if presented to a compiler for a later version of the language. Language designers are keen to avoid such regressions. The designers of the two languages have been following different paths when addressing this problem.

Java language designers have avoided new keywords as much as possible, preferring instead to introduce new syntactic constructs that were not legal before or to reuse existing keywords in new contexts. This way they didn&#x27;t jeopardize backward compatibility. An example of the former can be found in how the loop was extended to accept iterable types. An example of the latter can be found in how the and (especially) the keywords were reused for specifying type bounds when generics were introduced in Java 1.5. At one time (Java 1.4) a new keyword was introduced that was not reserved as a keyword before. This had the potential to render formerly valid code invalid, if for instance the code used as an identifier. The designers chose to address this problem with a four-step solution: 1) Introducing a compiler switch that indicates if Java 1.4 or later should be used, 2) Only marking as a keyword when compiling as Java 1.4 and later, 3) Defaulting to 1.3 to avoid rendering prior (non 1.4 aware code) invalid and 4) Issue warnings, if the keyword is used in Java 1.3 mode, to allow changes in the code.

C# language designers have introduced several new keywords since the first version. However, instead of defining these keywords as &quot;global&quot; keywords, they define them as &quot;context sensitive&quot; keywords. This means that even when they introduced (among others) the and keywords in C# 2.0, the use of those words as identifiers is still valid as there is no clash possible between the use as keyword and the use as identifier, given the context. Thus, the present C# syntax is fully backward compatible with source code written for any prior version without specifying the language version to be used.
== Object-oriented programming ==
Both C# and Java are designed from the ground up as object-oriented languages using dynamic dispatch, with syntax similar to C++ (C++ in turn derives from C). Neither language is a superset of C or C++, however.

=== Partial class ===
C# allows a class definition to be split across several source files using a feature called &quot;partial classes&quot;. Each part must be marked with the keyword . All the parts must be presented to the compiler as part of a single compilation. Parts can reference members from other parts. Parts can implement interfaces and one part can define a base class. The feature is useful in code generation scenarios (such as user interface (UI) design), where a code generator can supply one part and the developer another part to be compiled together. The developer can thus edit their part without the risk of a code generator overwriting that code at some later time. Unlike the class extension mechanism, a partial class allows &quot;circular&quot; dependencies among its parts as they are guaranteed to be resolved at compile time. Java has no corresponding concept.

=== Inner and local classes ===
Both languages allow &quot;inner classes&quot;, where a class is defined lexically inside another class. However, in each language these inner classes have rather different semantics.

In Java, unless the inner class is declared , a reference to an instance of an inner class carries a reference to the outer class with it. As a result, code in the inner class has access to both the static and non-static members of the outer class. To create an instance of a non-static inner class, the instance of the embracing outer class must be named. This is done via a new -operator introduced in JDK 1.3: . This can be done in any class that has a reference to an instance of the outer class.

In C#, an inner class is conceptually the same as a normal class. In a sense, the outer class only acts as a namespace. Thus, code in the inner class cannot access non-static members of the outer class unless it does so through an explicit reference to an instance of the outer class. Programmers can declare the inner class &quot;private&quot; to allow only the outer class to have any access to it.

Java provides another feature called &quot;local classes&quot; or &quot;anonymous classes&quot;, which can be defined within a method body. These are generally used to implement an interface with only one or two methods, which are typically event handlers. However, they can also be used to override virtual methods of a superclass. The methods in those local classes have access to the outer method&#x27;s local variables declared . C# satisfies the use-cases for these by providing anonymous delegates; see event handling for more about this.

C# also provides a feature called &quot;anonymous types/classes&quot;, but it is rather different from Java&#x27;s concept with the same name. It allows the programmer to instantiate a class by providing only a set of names for the properties the class should have, and an expression to initialize each. The types of the properties are inferred from the types of those expressions. These implicitly-declared classes are derived directly from &quot;object&quot;.

=== Event ===
C# multicast-delegates are used with &quot;events&quot;. Events provide support for event-driven programming and are an implementation of the observer pattern. To support this there is a specific syntax to define events in classes, and operators to register, unregister or combine event handlers.

See here for information about how events are implemented in Java.

=== Operator overloading and conversions ===
Operator overloading and user-defined casts are separate features that both aim to allow new types to become first-class citizens in the type system. By using these features in C#, types such as  and  have been integrated so that the usual operators like addition and multiplication work with the new types. Unlike C++, C# does restrict the use of operator overloading, prohibiting it for the operators , , , , , and any variations of compound statements like . But compound operators will call overloaded simple operators, like calling and .

Java does not include operator overloading, nor custom conversions to prevent abuse of the feature and to keep the language simple.

=== Indexer ===
C# also includes &quot;indexers&quot; that can be considered a special case of operator overloading (like the C++ ), or parameterized / properties. An indexer is a property named that uses one or more parameters (indexes); the indices can be objects of any type:
myList[4] = 5;
string name = xmlNode.Attributes[&quot;name&quot;];
orders = customerMap[theCustomer];
Java does not include indexers. The common Java pattern involves writing explicit getters and setters where a C# programmer would use an indexer.

=== Fields and initialization ===
==== Object initialization ====
In both C# and Java, an object&#x27;s fields can be initialized either by &quot;variable initializers&quot; (expressions that can be assigned to variables where they are defined) or by &quot;constructors&quot; (special subroutines that are executed when an object is being created). In addition, Java contains &quot;instance initializers&quot;, which are anonymous blocks of code with no arguments that are run after the explicit (or implicit) call to a superclass&#x27;s constructor but before the constructor is executed.

C# initializes object fields in the following order when creating an object:
# Derived static fields
# Derived static constructor
# Derived instance fields
# Base static fields
# Base static constructor
# Base instance fields
# Base instance constructor
# Derived instance constructor

Some of the above fields may not be applicable (e.g. if an object does not have &quot;static fields&quot;). &quot;Derived fields&quot; are those that are defined in the object&#x27;s direct class, while &quot;base field&quot; is a term for the fields that are defined in one of the object&#x27;s superclasses. Note that an object representation in memory contains all fields defined in its class or any of its superclasses, even, if some fields in superclasses are defined as private.

It is guaranteed that any field initializers take effect before any constructors are called, since both the instance constructor of the object&#x27;s class and its superclasses are called after field initializers are called. There is, however, a potential trap in object initialization when a virtual method is called from a base constructor. The overridden method in a subclass may reference a field that is defined in the subclass, but this field may not have been initialized because the constructor of the subclass that contains field initialization is called after the constructor of its base class.

In Java, the order of initialization is as follows:
# Invocation of another constructor (either of the object&#x27;s class or of the object&#x27;s superclass)
# Instance variable initializers and instance initializers (in the order they appear in the source code)
# The constructor body

Like in C#, a new object is created by calling a specific constructor. Within a constructor, the first statement may be an invocation of another constructor. If this is omitted, the call to the argumentless constructor of the superclass is added implicitly by the compiler. Otherwise, either another overloaded constructor of the object&#x27;s class can be called explicitly, or a superclass constructor can be called. In the former case, the called constructor will again call another constructor (either of the object&#x27;s class or its subclass) and the chain sooner or later ends up at the call to one of the constructors of the superclass.

After another constructor is called (that causes direct invocation of the superclass constructor, and so forth, down to the Object class), instance variables defined in the object&#x27;s class are initialized. Even if there are no variable initializers explicitly defined for some variables, these variables are initialized to default values. Note that instance variables defined in superclasses are already initialized by this point, because they were initialized by a superclass constructor when it was called (either by the constructor&#x27;s code or by variable initializers performed before the constructor&#x27;s code or implicitly to default values). In Java, variable initializers are executed according to their textual order in the source file.

Finally, the constructor body is executed. This ensures proper order of initialization, i.e. the fields of a base class finish initialization before initialization of the fields of an object class begins.

There are two main potential traps in Java&#x27;s object initialization. First, variable initializers are expressions that can contain method calls. Since methods can reference any variable defined in the class, the method called in a variable initializer can reference a variable that is defined below the variable being initialized. Since initialization order corresponds to textual order of variable definitions, such a variable would not be initialized to the value prescribed by its initializer and would contain the default value.
Another potential trap is when a method that is overridden in the derived class is called in the base class constructor, which can lead to behavior the programmer would not expect when an object of the derived class is created. According to the initialization order, the body of the base class constructor is executed before variable initializers are evaluated and before the body of the derived class constructor is executed. The overridden method called from the base class constructor can, however, reference variables defined in the derived class, but these are not yet initialized to the values specified by their initializers or set in the derived class constructor. The latter issue applies to C# as well, but in a less critical form since in C# methods are not overridable by default.

=== Resource disposal ===
Both languages mainly use garbage collection as a means of reclaiming memory resources, rather than explicit deallocation of memory. In both cases, if an object holds resources of different kinds other than memory, such as file handles, graphical resources, etc., then it must be notified explicitly when the application no longer uses it. Both C# and Java offer interfaces for such deterministic disposal and both C# and Java (since Java 7) feature automatic resource management statements that will automatically invoke the disposal/close methods on those interfaces.

=== Methods ===
==== Extension methods and default methods ====
Using a special &quot;this&quot; designator on the first parameter of a method, C# allows the method to act as if it were a member method of the type of the first parameter. This &quot;extension&quot; of the foreign class is purely syntactical. The extension method must be declared and defined within a purely static class. The method must obey any member access restriction like any other method external to the class; thus static methods cannot break object encapsulation. The &quot;extension&quot; is only active within scopes where the namespace of the static host class has been imported.

Since Java 8, Java has a similar feature called &quot;default methods&quot;, which are methods with a body declared on interfaces. As opposed to C# extension methods, Java default methods are instance methods on the interface that declare them. Definition of default methods in classes that implement the interface is optional: If the class does not define the method, the default definition is used instead.

Both the C# extension methods and the Java default methods allow a class to override the default implementation of the extension/default method, respectively. In both languages this override is achieved by defining a method on the class that should use an alternate implementation of the method.

C# scope rules defines that if a matching method is found on a class, it takes precedence over a matching extension method. In Java any class declared to implement an interface with default method is assumed to have the default methods implementations, &quot;unless&quot; the class implements the method itself.

==== Partial methods ====
Related to &quot;partial classes&quot; C# allows partial methods to be specified within partial classes. A partial method is an intentional declaration of a method with several restrictions on the signature. The restrictions ensure that if a definition is not provided by any class part, then the method and every call to it can be safely erased. This feature allows code to provide a large number of interception points (like the template method GoF design pattern) without paying any runtime overhead if these extension points are not being used by another class part at compile time. Java has no corresponding concept.

==== Virtual methods ====
&quot;Methods&quot; in C# are non-virtual by default, and must be declared virtual explicitly, if desired. In Java, all non-static non-private methods are virtual. Virtuality guarantees that the most recent override for the method will always be called, but incurs a certain runtime cost on invocation as these invocations cannot be normally inlined, and require an indirect call via the virtual method table. However, some JVM implementations, including the Oracle reference implementation, implement inlining of the most commonly called virtual methods.

Java methods are virtual by default (although they can be &quot;sealed&quot; by using the modifier to disallow overriding). There is no way to let derived classes define a new, unrelated method with the same name.

This means that by default in Java, and only when explicitly enabled in C#, new methods may be defined in a derived class with the same name and signature as those in its base class. When the method is called on a superclass reference of such an object, the &quot;deepest&quot; overridden implementation of the base class&#x27; method will be called according to the specific subclass of the object being referenced.

In some cases, when a subclass introduces a method with the same name and signature as a method already present in the base class, problems can occur. In Java, this will mean that the method in the derived class will implicitly override the method in the base class, even though that may not be the intent of the designers of either class.

To mitigate this, C# requires that if a method is intended to override an inherited method, the keyword must be specified. Otherwise, the method will &quot;hide&quot; the inherited method. If the keyword is absent, compiler warning to this effect is issued, which can be silenced by specifying the keyword. This avoids the problem that can arise from a base class being extended with a non-private method (i.e. an inherited part of the namespace) whose signature is already in use by a derived class. Java has a similar compiler check in the form of the method annotation, but it is not compulsory, and in its absence, most compilers will not provide comment (but the method will be overridden).

==== Constant/immutable parameters ====
In Java, it is possible to prevent reassignment of a local variable or method parameter by using the keyword. Applying this keyword to a primitive type variable causes the variable to become immutable. However, applying to a reference type variable only prevents that another object is assigned to it. It will not prevent the data contained by the object from being mutated. As of , it is possible to prevent reassignment of a method parameter by using the keyword, however this keyword cannot be used on local variables. As with Java, applying to a parameter only prevents the parameter from being reassigned to a different value. It is still possible to mutate the data contained by the object.
Both languages do not support essential feature of const-correctness that exists in C/C++, which makes a method constant.

Java defines the word &quot;constant&quot; arbitrarily as a field. As a convention, these variable names are capital-only with words separated with an underscore but the Java language doesn&#x27;t insist on this. A parameter that is only is not considered as a constant, although it may be so in the case of a primitive data type or an immutable class, like a .

==== Generator methods ====

Any C# method declared as returning , or the generic versions of these interfaces can be implemented using syntax. This is a form of limited, compiler-generated continuations and can drastically reduce the code needed to traverse or generate sequences, although that code is just generated by the compiler instead. The feature can also be used to implement infinite sequences, e.g., the sequence of Fibonacci numbers.

Java does not have an equivalent feature. Instead, generators are typically defined by providing a specialized implementation of a well-known collection or iterable interface, which will compute each element on demand. For such a generator to be used in a &quot;for each&quot; statement, it must implement interface .

See also example Fibonacci sequence below.

==== Explicit interface implementation ====
C# also has &quot;explicit interface implementation&quot; that allows a class to specifically implement methods of an interface, separate to its own class methods, or to provide different implementations for two methods with the same name and signature inherited from two base interfaces.

In either language, if a method (or property in C#) is specified with the same name and signature in multiple interfaces, the members will clash when a class is designed that implements those interfaces. An implementation will by default implement a common method for all of the interfaces. If separate implementations are needed (because the methods serve separate purposes, or because return values differ between the interfaces) C#&#x27;s explicit interface implementation will solve the problem, though allowing different results for the same method, depending on the current cast of the object. In Java there is no way to solve this problem other than refactoring one or more of the interfaces to avoid name clashes.

==== Reference (in/out) parameters ====
The arguments of primitive types (e.g. int, double) to a method are passed by value in Java whereas objects are passed by reference. This means that a method operates on copies of the primitives passed to it instead of on the actual variables. On the contrary, the actual objects in some cases can be changed. In the following example, object String is not changed. Object of class &#x27;a&#x27; is changed.

In C#, it is possible to enforce a reference with the keyword, similar to C++ and in a sense to C. This feature of C# is particularly useful when one wants to create a method that returns more than one object. In Java trying to return multiple values from a method is unsupported unless a wrapper is used, in this case named &quot;Ref&quot;.

=== Exceptions ===
====Checked exceptions====
Java supports checked exceptions (along with unchecked exceptions). C# only supports unchecked exceptions. Checked exceptions force the programmer to either declare the exception thrown in a method, or to catch the thrown exception using a clause.

Checked exceptions can encourage good programming practice, ensuring that all errors are dealt with. However Anders Hejlsberg, chief C# language architect, argues that they were to some extent an experiment in Java and that they have not been shown to be worthwhile except in small example programs.

One criticism is that checked exceptions encourage programmers to use an empty catch block (), which silently swallows exceptions, rather than letting the exceptions propagate to a higher-level exception-handling routine. In some cases, however, exception chaining can be applied instead, by re-throwing the exception in a wrapper exception. For example, if an object is changed to access a database instead of a file, an could be caught and re-thrown as an , since the caller may not need to know the inner workings of the object.

However, not all programmers agree with this stance. James Gosling and others maintain that checked exceptions are useful, and misusing them has caused the problems. Silently catching exceptions is possible, yes, but it must be stated explicitly what to do with the exception, versus unchecked exceptions that allow doing nothing by default. It can be ignored, but code must be written explicitly to ignore it.

====Try-catch-finally====
There are also differences between the two languages in treating the statement. The block is always executed, even if the block contains control-passing statements like or . In Java, this may result in unexpected behavior, if the block is left by a statement with some value, and then the block that is executed afterward is also left by a statement with a different value. C# resolves this problem by prohibiting any control-passing statements like or in the block.

A common reason for using blocks is to guard resource managing code, thus guaranteeing the release of precious resources in the finally block. C# features the statement as a syntactic shorthand for this common scenario, in which the method of the object of the is always called.

A rather subtle difference is the moment a stack trace is created when an exception is being thrown. In Java, the stack trace is created in the moment the exception is created.
class Foo {
 Exception up = new Exception();
 int foo() throws Exception {
 throw up;
}
The exception in the statement above will always contain the constructor&#x27;s stack-trace – no matter how often foo is called.
In C# on the other hand, the stack-trace is created the moment &quot;throw&quot; is executed.
class Foo
 Exception e = new Exception();

 int foo()
 try
 throw e;
 catch (Exception e)
 throw;
 }


In the code above, the exception will contain the stack-trace of the first throw-line. When catching an exception, there are two options in case the exception should be rethrown: will just rethrow the original exception with the original stack, while would have created a new stack trace.

==== Finally blocks ====
Java allows flow of control to leave the block of a statement, regardless of the way it was entered. This can cause another control flow statement (such as ) to be terminated mid-execution. For example:
int foo() {
 try {
 return 0;
 } finally {
 return 1;
}
In the above code, the statement within the block causes control to leave it, and thus block is executed before the actual return happens. However, the block itself also performs a return. Thus, the original return that caused it to be entered is not executed, and the above method returns 1 rather than 0. Informally speaking, it &quot;tries&quot; to return 0 but &quot;finally&quot; returns 1.

C# does not allow any statements that allow control flow to leave the block prematurely, except for . In particular, is not allowed at all, is not allowed if the target label is outside the block, and and are not allowed if the nearest enclosing loop is outside the block.

== Generics ==
In the field of generics the two languages show a superficial syntactical similarity, but they have deep underlying differences.
=== Type erasure versus reified generics ===
Generics in Java are a language-only construction; they are implemented only in the compiler. The generated classfiles include generic signatures only in form of metadata (allowing the compiler to compile new classes against them). The runtime has no knowledge of the generic type system; generics are not part of the Java virtual machine (JVM). Instead, generics classes and methods are transformed during compiling via a process termed type erasure. During this, the compiler replaces all generic types with their &quot;raw&quot; version and inserts casts/checks appropriately in client code where the type and its methods are used. The resulting byte code will contain no references to any generic types or parameters (See also Generics in Java).

The Java language specification intentionally prohibits certain uses of generics; this is necessary to allow for implementing generics through type erasure, and to allow for migration compatibility. Research into adding reified generics to the Java platform is ongoing, as part of Project Valhalla.

C# builds on support for generics from the virtual execution system, i.e., it is not just a language feature. The language is merely a front-end for cross-language generics support in the CLR. During compiling generics are verified for correctness, but code generation to &quot;implement&quot; the generics are deferred to class-load time. Client code (code invoking generic methods/properties) are fully compiled and can safely assume generics to be type-safe. This is called reification. At runtime, when a unique set of type parameters for a generic class/method/delegate is encountered for the first time, the class loader/verifier will synthesize a concrete class descriptor and generate method implementations. During the generation of method implementations all reference types will be considered one type, as reference types can safely share the same implementations. This is merely for the purpose of &quot;implementing&quot; code. Different sets of reference types will still have unique type descriptors; their method tables will merely point to the same code.

The following list illustrates some differences between Java and C# when managing generics. It is not exhaustive:

C# allows generics directly for primitive types. Java, instead, allows the use of boxed types as type parameters (e.g., instead of ). This comes at a cost since all such values need to be boxed/unboxed when used, and they all need to be heap-allocated. However, a generic type can be specialized with an array type of a primitive type in Java, for example is allowed.
Several third-party libraries implemented the basic collections in Java with backing primitive arrays to preserve the runtime and memory optimization that primitive types provide.

=== Migration compatibility ===
Java&#x27;s type erasure design was motivated by a design requirement to achieve &quot;migration compatibility&quot; – not to be confused with backward compatibility. In particular, the original requirement was &quot;… there should be a clean, demonstrable migration path for the Collections APIs that were introduced in the Java 2 platform&quot;. This was designed so that any new generic collections should be passable to methods that expected one of the pre-existing collection classes.

C# generics were introduced into the language while preserving full backward compatibility, but did not preserve full &quot;migration compatibility&quot;: Old code (pre C# 2.0) runs unchanged on the new generics-aware runtime without recompilation. As for &quot;migration compatibility&quot;, new generic collection classes and interfaces were developed that supplemented the non-generic .NET 1.x collections rather than replacing them. In addition to generic collection interfaces, the new generic collection classes implement the non-generic collection interfaces where possible. This prevents the use of new generic collections with pre-existing (non-generic aware) methods, if those methods are coded to use the collection &quot;classes&quot;.

=== Covariance and contravariance ===

Covariance and contravariance is supported by both languages. Java has use-site variance that allows a single generic class to declare members using both co- and contravariance. C# has define-site variance for generic interfaces and delegates. Variance is unsupported directly on classes but is supported through their implementation of variant interfaces. C# also has use-site covariance support for methods and delegates.

== Functional programming ==
=== Closures ===
A closure is an inline function that captures variables from its lexical scope.

C# supports closures as anonymous methods or lambda expressions with full-featured closure semantics.

In Java, anonymous inner classes will remain the preferred way to emulate closures until Java 8 has become the new standard. This is a more verbose construction. This approach also has some differences compared to real closures, notably more controlled access to variables from the enclosing scopes: only final members can be referenced. Java 8, however introduces lambdas that fully inherit the current scope and, in fact, do not introduce a new scope.

When a reference to a method can be passed around for later execution, a problem arises about what to do when the method has references to variables/parameters in its lexical scope. C# closures can access any variable/parameter from its lexical scope. In Java&#x27;s anonymous inner classes, only references to final members of the lexical scope are allowed, thus requiring the developer to mark which variables to make available, and in what state (possibly requiring boxing).

===Lambdas and expression trees===
C# and Java feature a special type of in-line closures called lambdas. These are anonymous methods: they have a signature and a body, but no name. They are mainly used to specify local function-valued arguments in calls to other methods, a technique mainly associated with functional programming.

C#, unlike Java, allows the use of lambda functions as a way to define special data structures called expression trees. Whether they are seen as an executable function or as a data structure depends on compiler type inference and what type of variable or parameter they are assigned or cast to. Lambdas and expression trees play key roles in Language Integrated Query (LINQ).

==Metadata==
== Preprocessing, compilation and packaging ==
=== Namespaces and file contents ===
In C#, namespaces are similar to those in C++. Unlike package names in Java, a namespace is not in any way tied to the location of the source file. While it is not strictly necessary for a Java source file location to mirror its package directory structure, it is the conventional organization.

Both languages allow importing of classes (e.g., in Java), allowing a class to be referenced using only its name. Sometimes classes with the same name exist in multiple namespaces or packages. Such classes can be referenced by using fully qualified names, or by importing only selected classes with different names. To do this, Java allows importing a single class (e.g., ). C# allows importing classes under a new local name using the following syntax: . It also allows importing specializations of classes in the form of .

Both languages have a static import syntax that allows using the short name of some or all of the static methods/fields in a class (e.g., allowing where can be statically imported from another class). C# has a static class syntax (not to be confused with static inner classes in Java), which restricts a class to only contain static methods. C# 3.0 introduces extension methods to allow users to statically add a method to a type (e.g., allowing where can be an imported extension method working on the type of ).

The Sun Microsystems Java compiler requires that a source file name must match the only public class inside it, while C# allows multiple public classes in the same file, and puts no restrictions on the file name. C# 2.0 and later allows splitting a class definition into several files by using the keyword in the source code. In Java, a public class will always be in its own source file. In C#, source code files and logical units separation are not tightly related.

=== Conditional compilation ===
Unlike Java, C# implements conditional compilation using preprocessor directives. It also provides a attribute to define methods that are only called when a given compilation constant is defined. This way, assertions can be provided as a framework feature with the method , which is only evaluated when the constant is defined. Since version 1.4, Java provides a language feature for assertions, which are turned off at runtime by default but can be enabled using the or switch when invoking the JVM.

== Threading and asynchronous features ==
Both languages include thread synchronization mechanisms as part of their language syntax.

=== Task-based parallelism for C# ===
With .NET Framework 4.0, a new task-based programming model was introduced to replace the existing event-based asynchronous model. The API is based around the and classes. Tasks can be composed and chained.

By convention, every method that returns a should have its name postfixed with &quot;Async&quot;.
public static class SomeAsyncCode
 public static Task&lt;XDocument&gt; GetContentAsync()
 HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient();
 return httpClient.GetStringAsync(&quot;www.contoso.com&quot;).ContinueWith((task) =&gt; {
 string responseBodyAsText = task.Result;
 return XDocument.Parse(responseBodyAsText);
 }

var t = SomeAsyncCode.GetContentAsync().ContinueWith((task) =&gt; {
 var xmlDocument = task.Result;

t.Start();

In C# 5 a set of language and compiler extensions was introduced to make it easier to work with the task model. These language extensions included the notion of methods and the statement that make the program flow appear synchronous.
public static class SomeAsyncCode
 public static async Task&lt;XDocument&gt; GetContentAsync()
 HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient();
 string responseBodyAsText = await httpClient.GetStringAsync(&quot;www.contoso.com&quot;);
 return XDocument.Parse(responseBodyAsText);
}

var xmlDocument = await SomeAsyncCode.GetContentAsync();

// The Task will be started on call with await.

From this syntactic sugar the C# compiler generates a state-machine that handles the necessary continuations without developers having to think about it.

=== Task-based parallelism for Java ===
Java supports threads since JDK 1.0. Java offers a high versatility for running threads, often called tasks. This is done by implementing a functional interface (a interface) defining a single void no-args method as demonstrated in the following example:

var myThread = new Thread(() -&gt; {
 var threadName = Thread.currentThread().getName();
 System.out.println(&quot;Hello &quot; + threadName);

myThread.start();
Similar to C#, Java has a higher level mechanism for working with threads. can execute asynchronous tasks and also manage a group of subprocesses. All the threads of an instance are handled in a pool. This instance will be reused under the hood for revenant tasks, so it&#x27;s possible runs as many concurrent tasks as the programmer wants throughout the life-cycle of the application using a single executor service instance.

This is how the first thread-example looks using executors:

ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();

executor.submit(() -&gt; {
 var threadName = Thread.currentThread().getName();
 System.out.println(&quot;Hello &quot; + threadName);


The instance also supports a interface, another single method interface like but the signature of the contained method of returns a value. In this way, the lambda expression must also return a value, like the below example of calling a website asynchronously as the C# example.

ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();

Future&lt;String&gt; contentAsync = executor.submit(() -&gt; { 
 HttpRequest httpReq = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
 .uri(new URI(&quot;www.graalvm.org&quot;))
 .build();
 return HttpClient.newHttpClient()
 .send(httpReq, BodyHandlers.ofString())
 .body();
 
var webPageResult = contentAsync.get();

Calling the method blocks the current thread and waits until the callable completes before returning the value (in the example, a web page content):

The following example, a method and a class are used. This wrap it&#x27;s just to be similar to the C# example since Java does not have keywords like async for the method signature.

public static class SomeAsyncCode {

 static ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();

 public static Future&lt;String&gt; getContentAsync(){
 return executor.submit(() -&gt; { 
 HttpRequest httpReq = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
 .uri(new URI(&quot;www.graalvm.org&quot;))
 .build();
 return HttpClient.newHttpClient()
 .send(httpReq, BodyHandlers.ofString())
 .body();
 }

var webPageResult = SomeAsyncCode.getContentAsync().get();
==Additional features==
===Numeric applications===
To adequately support applications in the field of mathematical and financial computation, several language features exist.

Java&#x27;s strictfp keyword enables strict floating-point calculations for a region of code. Strict floating-point calculations require that even if a platform offers higher precision during calculations, intermediate results must be converted to single/double. This ensures that strict floating-point calculations return exactly the same result on all platforms. Without strict floating-point, a platform implementation is free to use higher precision for intermediate results during calculation. C# allows an implementation for a given hardware architecture to always use a higher precision for intermediate results if available, i.e. C# does not allow the programmer to optionally force intermediate results to use the potential lower precision of single/double.

Although Java&#x27;s floating-point arithmetic is largely based on IEEE 754 (Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic), certain features are unsupported even when using the strictfp modifier, such as Exception Flags and Directed Roundings, abilities mandated by IEEE Standard 754 (see Criticism of Java, Floating point arithmetic).

C# provides a built-in decimal type, which has higher precision (but less range) than the Java/C# double. The decimal type is a 128-bit data type suitable for financial and monetary calculations. The decimal type can represent values ranging from 1.0 × 10−28 to approximately 7.9 × 1028 with 28–29 significant digits. The structure uses C# operator overloading so that decimals can be manipulated using operators such as , , and , like other primitive data types.

The and types provided with Java allow arbitrary-precision representation of decimal numbers and integer numbers, respectively. Java standard library does not have classes to deal with complex numbers.

The , and types provided with C# allow representation and manipulation of arbitrary-precision integers and complex numbers, respectively. The structures use C# operator overloading so that instances can be manipulated using operators such as , , , and , like other primitive data types. C# standard library does not have classes to deal with arbitrary-precision floating point numbers (see software for arbitrary-precision arithmetic).

C# can help mathematical applications with the and operators that allow the enabling or disabling of run-time checking for arithmetic overflow for a region of code.

=== Language integrated query (LINQ) ===

C#s Language Integrated Query (LINQ) is a set of features designed to work together to allow in-language querying abilities and is a distinguishing feature between C# and Java.

LINQ consists of these features:
* Extension methods allow existing interfaces or classes to be extended with new methods. Implementations can be shared or an interface can have a dedicated implementation.
* Lambdas allow for expression of criteria in a functional fashion.
* Expression trees allow a specific implementation to capture a lambda as an abstract syntax tree rather than an executable block. This can be utilized by implementations to represent criteria in a different language, e.g. in the form of an SQL where clause as is the case with e.g. Linq, LINQ to SQL.
* Anonymous types and type inference supports capturing and working with the result type of a query. A query may both join and project over query sources that may lead to a result type that cannot be named.
* Query expressions to support a syntax familiar to SQL users.
* Nullable (lifted) types to allow for a better match with query providers that support nullable types, like e.g. SQL.

=== Native interoperability ===
The Java Native Interface (JNI) feature allows Java programs to call non-Java code. However, JNI does require the code being called to follow several conventions and imposes restrictions on types and names used. This means that an extra adaption layer between legacy code and Java is often needed. This adaption code must be coded in a non-Java language, often C or C++. Java Native Access (JNA) allows easier calling of native code that only requires writing Java code, but comes at a performance cost.

In addition, third party libraries provide Java-Component Object Model (COM) bridging, e.g., JACOB (free), and J-Integra for COM (proprietary).

.NET Platform Invoke (P/Invoke) offers the same ability by allowing calls from C# to what Microsoft terms unmanaged code. Through metadata attributes the programmer can control exactly how the parameters and results are marshalled, thus avoiding the external glue code needed by the equivalent JNI in Java. P/Invoke allows almost complete access to procedural APIs (such as Win32 or POSIX), but limited access to C++ class libraries.

In addition, .NET Framework also provides a .NET-COM bridge, allowing access to COM components as, if they were first-class .NET objects.

C# also allows the programmer to disable the normal type-checking and other safety features of the CLR, which then enables the use of pointer variables. When using this feature, the programmer must mark the code using the keyword. JNI, P/Invoke, and &quot;unsafe&quot; code are equally risky features, exposing possible security holes and application instability. An advantage of unsafe, managed code over P/Invoke or JNI is that it allows the programmer to continue to work in the familiar C# environment to accomplish some tasks that otherwise would require calling out to unmanaged code. An assembly (program or library) using unsafe code must be compiled with a special switch and will be marked as such. This enables runtime environments to take special precautions before executing potentially harmful code.

=== Runtime environments ===
Java (the programming language) is designed to execute on the Java platform via the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). The Java platform includes the Java virtual machine (JVM) and a common set of libraries. The JRE was originally designed to support interpreted execution with final compiling as an option. Most JRE environments execute fully or at least partially compiled programs, possibly with adaptive optimization. The Java compiler produces Java bytecode. Upon execution the bytecode is loaded by the Java runtime and either interpreted directly or compiled to machine instructions and then executed. 

C# is designed to execute on the Common Language Runtime (CLR). The CLR is designed to execute fully compiled code. The C# compiler produces Common Intermediate Language instructions. Upon execution the runtime loads this code and compiles to machine instructions on the target architecture. 

== Examples ==
=== Input/output ===
Example illustrating how to copy text one line at a time from one file to another, using both languages.
=== Integration of library-defined types ===
C# allows library-defined types to be integrated with existing types and operators by using custom implicit/explicit conversions and operator overloading as illustrated by the following example:
=== C# delegates and equivalent Java constructs ===
=== Type lifting ===
===Interoperability with dynamic languages===
This example illustrates how Java and C# can be used to create and invoke an instance of class that is implemented in another programming language. The &quot;Deepthought&quot; class is implemented using the Ruby programming language and represents a simple calculator that will multiply two input values ( and ) when the method is invoked. In addition to the conventional way, Java has GraalVM, a virtual machine capable to run any implemented programming language.
=== Fibonacci sequence ===
This example illustrates how the Fibonacci sequence can be implemented using the two languages. The C# version takes advantage of C# generator methods. The Java version takes the advantage of interface and method references. Both the Java and the C# examples use K&amp;R style for code formatting of classes, methods and statements.

<doc id="685218" wikidata="Q724329" url="?curid=685218" title="Nathan Clifford">
<text>Nathan Clifford (August 18, 1803 – July 25, 1881) was an American statesman, diplomat and jurist.

Clifford is one of the few people who have held a constitutional office in each of the three branches of the U.S. federal government. He represented Maine in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1839 to 1843, then served in the administration of President James K. Polk as the U.S. Attorney General from 1846 to 1848 and as the U.S. Ambassador to Mexico from 1848 to 1849. In the latter office, he signed the Treaty of Guadeloupe Hidalgo. In 1858, President James Buchanan appointed Clifford to be an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Clifford served on the Supreme Court until his death in 1881.

== Early life and education ==
Clifford was born on August 18, 1803, in Rumney, New Hampshire, to Deacon Nathaniel Clifford and his wife Lydia (née Simpson). He was the eldest and only son of seven children. His family were of old Yankee stock. As a young girl in 1672, his great-great-grandmother Ann Smith was an accuser of Goody Cole, the only woman in New Hampshire convicted of witchcraft.

He attended the public schools of that town, then the Haverhill Academy in New Hampshire, and finally the New Hampton Literary Institute (now known as the New Hampton School).

== Early career ==
After teaching school for a time, he studied law in the offices of Josiah Quincy III and was admitted to the bar in Maine in 1827, establishing his first practice in Newfield, Maine.

He served in the Maine House of Representatives from 1830 to 1834 and served as Speaker of the House from 1833 to 1834. He was then Maine Attorney General from 1834 to 1838, when he entered national politics.

=== U.S. House of Representatives (1839–43) ===
Initially, Clifford ran for the Senate and lost. Then, Clifford was elected as a Democratic Representative to the 26th and 27th Congresses, serving March 4, 1839 through March 3, 1843.

In Washington, D.C., he followed the Democratic party line on policies, and was a strong supporter of the Van Buren administration. Clifford was opposed to a high tariff, supported internal improvements, endorsed state banking, and was in favor of federal retrenchment. He also criticized abolition, saying that its supporters were well intentioned but denounced the &quot;mean and incendiary schemes of political Abolitionists.&quot;

Due to re-redistricting and political infighting, Clifford was not a candidate for re-election in 1842.

== Polk administration ==

=== U.S. Attorney General (1846–48) ===
In 1846, President James K. Polk appointed him 19th Attorney General of the United States after his predecessor, John Y. Mason, returned to being Naval Secretary. Clifford served in Polk&#x27;s Cabinet from October 17, 1846, to March 17, 1848.

=== Ambassador to Mexico (1848–49) ===
Clifford resigned his post with the Justice Department to become the U.S. Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Mexico, serving from March 18, 1848, to September 6, 1849. It was through Clifford that the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was arranged with Mexico, by which California became a part of the United States.

A Whig Presidential victory meant that Clifford was recalled to the United States. Following his service in the diplomatic corps, Clifford resumed the practice of law in Portland, Maine.

== Associate Justice of the Supreme Court (1858–81) ==

=== Appointment ===
On December 9, 1857, President James Buchanan nominated Clifford as an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court, to a seat vacated by Benjamin R. Curtis. Clifford&#x27;s nomination came in the immediate wake of the &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot; decision and was hotly contested. As a longtime partisan Democrat, the opposition labeled Clifford a political hack and a &quot;doughface&quot; — a Northern man with Southern sympathies. Anti-slavery representatives in the United States Senate fiercely opposed Clifford due to his pro-slavery record. After a 34-day-long confirmation process, the U.S. senate narrowly confirmed Clifford on January 12, 1858, by a vote. He was sworn into office on January 21, 1858.

At the time Clifford joined the Court, all but one of the justices were affiliated with the Democratic Party. By 1872, Clifford had outlived his Democratic colleagues, and his new Republican colleagues tended to outvote him for his remaining nine years on the Court. Therefore, about one-fifth of all his opinions were in dissent. He wrote the majority opinion in 398 cases. His opinions were comprehensive essays on law and have sometimes been criticized as overly lengthy and digressive.

=== Legal philosophy ===
Justice Clifford rarely declared any legal philosophy about the U.S. Constitution but believed in a sharp dividing line between federal and state authority. One admirer, U.S. Senator James W. Bradbury, said Clifford&#x27;s view was that the Constitution was not an &quot;elastic instrument to be enlarged or impaired by construction, but to be fairly interpreted according to its terms, and sacredly maintained in all its provisions and limitations, as the best guaranty for the perpetuity of our republican institutions.&quot; Clifford supported a mechanical jurisprudence adhering to the strict text of the Constitution.

Clifford&#x27;s fields of expertise were commercial and maritime law, Mexican land grants, and procedure and practice. Clifford&#x27;s major contribution to constitutional interpretation may have been his dissent in &quot;Loan Association v. Topeka&quot; rejecting &quot;natural law&quot; or any ground other than clear constitutional provision as a basis for the Court to use to strike down legislative acts.

=== Civil War ===
During the Civil War, Clifford remained loyal to the Union. He distrusted federal authority, but generally upheld federal power as far as was necessary to prosecute the war. Some exceptions were the &quot;Prize Cases&quot;, where he joined the dissent in arguing that the blockade of the Confederacy was illegal without a declaration of war, and &quot;Ex parte Milligan&quot;, where he joined the majority to limit the use of military tribunals to prosecute citizens when civilian courts were available.

=== Reconstruction ===
During Reconstruction, Clifford continued his skepticism of the federal government, now unrestrained by any consideration for the exigencies of wartime emergency powers. He more readily voted to limit federal power and make it easier for the South to rejoin the Union. In &quot;Cummings v. Missouri&quot; and &quot;Ex parte Garland&quot;, Clifford joined the majority in outlawing test oaths as part of the conditions of returning to the Union.

==== Legal Tender cases ====
Perhaps Clifford&#x27;s most prominent declaration against exercise of federal authority came in the Legal Tender cases. The cases dealt with the Legal Tender Act of 1862, passed to permit the issuance of paper money to pay war debts and establishing that paper currency would be valid as legal tender. In &quot;Hepburn v. Griswold&quot; (1870), a debtor whose note was made prior to the Act&#x27;s passage challenged its application to her debt. Clifford joined the majority in a 5–3 decision holding that the Legal Tender Act could not constitutionally apply to preexisting debts.

Almost immediately after &quot;Griswold&quot;, the composition of the Supreme Court changed. Terminally ill Justice Robert Grier, who had joined the majority in &quot;Hepburn&quot;, resigned. President Ulysses S. Grant filled his seat with William Strong. The Court was also expanded by an Act of Congress from eight to nine members, with Joseph Bradley filling the new seat.

This change had an immediate impact on the pending case &quot;Knox v. Lee&quot; (1871). The case dealt with remuneration for goods confiscated by the Confederate Army. The lower court ruled that the plaintiff must be repaid in paper money and that the defendant had to pay the difference in the valuation of the goods in gold to greenbacks. Justice Clifford, joined by Justices Field and Nelson, dissented from the grant of certiorari, stating publicly, &quot;I dissent from the order of the Court in these cases, especially from that part of it which opens for re-argument the question whether... the Legal Tender Act is constitutional as to contracts made before its passage—as I hold that the question is conclusively settled by the case of Hepburn vs Griswold...&quot;

On May 1, 1871, the Court ruled 5–4 to overturn &quot;Hepburn v. Griswold&quot; and find the Legal Tender Act constitutional — facially and as applied to pre-existing debt. The four justices who formed the majority in &quot;Hepburn&quot; (minus the late Justice Grier) all dissented in &quot;Knox&quot;. The new justices, Bradley and Strong, were the deciding factor. Clifford submitted an 18,000 word dissent, angered that the Court would reverse its opinion in such a short amount of time. He also argued that the Legal Tender Act was facially unconstitutional, arguing that only hard money (gold and silver) with intrinsic value could serve as legal tender.

==== Reconstruction amendments ====
Clifford held to a limited interpretation of the Reconstruction amendments. He joined the majority in the Slaughter-House Cases (1873), which distinguished state and federal citizenship and held that the Fourteenth Amendment only protects the narrower rights of federal citizens. In &quot;Hall v. DeCuir&quot; (1878), Justice Clifford wrote a separate concurrence to uphold segregation on steamships, coining the phrase &quot;equality is not identity.&quot; His concurrence may have foreshadowed the principle of &quot;separate but equal&quot; laid down after his death, in &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; (1893).

=== Compromise of 1877 ===
Clifford was president of the Electoral Commission convened in 1877 to determine the outcome of the 1876 presidential election. Clifford voted for fellow Democrat Samuel Tilden, but Rutherford B. Hayes won by a single vote.

Clifford believed that the commission erred in nullifying Tilden&#x27;s apparent victory and never accepted Hayes as the lawful president. Still, he signed off on Hayes&#x27; order for inauguration. In this instance Clifford put the country before his strong party beliefs, and his personal hope of having a Democratic president choose his successor.

By 1877, Clifford&#x27;s mental faculties had declined and impaired his ability to be an effective Justice. Justice Samuel Miller wrote that Clifford&#x27;s mental deterioration was &quot;obvious to all of the Court&quot; and &quot;in the work we do, no man ought to be there after 70.&quot; (Clifford was 74.) In 1880, Clifford experienced a stroke that, according to Miller, &quot;rendered him a babbling idiot.&quot; He did not participate in any cases during that year, but still refused to step down, hoping that a Democratic president would be elected in 1880 and appoint a successor. He died on July 25, 1881, his successor on the bench, Horace Gray, instead being appointed by Republican president Chester Arthur.

== Personal life ==
As a young lawyer in Newfield, Clifford met his wife, Hannah Ayer. They had six children.

== Death and legacy ==
Clifford died on July 25, 1881, in Cornish, Maine, and is interred in Evergreen Cemetery in Portland.

The Nathan Clifford Elementary School in Portland is named for him. Clifford&#x27;s son, William Henry Clifford, was a successful lawyer and an unsuccessful candidate for the Maine State House of Representatives. His grandson, also named Nathan Clifford, was also a lawyer and briefly president of the Maine State Senate.

<text>The Progressive Corporation is an American insurance company. Progressive is currently the #2 auto insurer in the United States behind State Farm. The company was co-founded in 1937 by Jack Green and Joseph M. Lewis, and is headquartered in Mayfield, Ohio. The company insures passenger vehicles, motorcycles, recreational vehicles (RVs), trailers, boats, personal water craft (PWC), and commercial vehicles. Progressive also provides home, life, pet, and other types of insurance through select companies. Additionally, Progressive offers auto insurance in Australia.

The company ranked #62 on the 2024 Fortune 500 list of the top American corporations.

==History==
Progressive was formed in 1937 by Joseph Lewis and Jack Green as Progressive Mutual Insurance Company. In 1956, the company found a niche by insuring more risky drivers. In 1965, Peter B. Lewis, son of Joseph Lewis, and his mother borrowed $2.5 million, pledging their majority stake as collateral, and completed a leveraged buyout of Progressive. In 1971, Progressive conducted an initial public offering (IPO) and became a publicly-traded company. In 1987, the sum of the company&#x27;s written premiums surpassed $1 billion, and by 2016 that number reached $20 billion. Progressive boasts being the first auto insurance company to have a website and to allow customers to purchase policies via that site. Later, Progressive would pioneer the use of mobile browsers and smartphone apps for rating and managing policies. It was also the first to offer 24/7 claims reporting. 

==Segments==

The company operates in three segments: personal lines, commercial auto, and other indemnity.

* The personal lines segment writes insurance for private passenger automobiles, motorcycles, boats, and recreational vehicles through both an independent agency channel and a direct channel. 
* The commercial auto segment writes primary liability and physical damage insurance for automobiles and trucks owned by businesses primarily through an independent agency channel.
* The other-indemnity segment provides professional liability insurance to community banks, principally directors, and officers liability insurance. It also provides insurance-related services, primarily providing policy issuance and claims adjusting services in 25 states for Commercial Auto Insurance Procedures/Plans.

==Industry information==
Progressive is one of the largest auto insurers in the United States, with over 13 million policies in force, along with State Farm, Allstate, GEICO, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, Farmers Insurance Group, and USAA. Progressive primarily offers its services through the internet, by telephone or through independent insurance agents. Progressive’s Agency business sells insurance through more than 30,000 independent insurance agents and &quot;progressiveagent.com&quot; where customers can quote their own policies and then contact an agent to complete the sale.

In December 2009, Progressive announced it was selling car insurance in Australia. Initially called Progressive Direct, it rebranded as Progressive in 2011, and later rebranded as PD Insurance in 2019.

==Marketing and operations==
Progressive&#x27;s marketing campaign is known for offering quotes of its competitors along with its own quote. It was the first major insurer to offer auto policies through the phone and through its web site. In September 2007 Progressive began to offer Pet Injury coverage, which provides coverage for dogs and cats that are injured in a crash and is included at no additional cost with Collision coverage.

Immediate Response Vehicles (IRVs) used by Progressive are specially modified Ford Explorers and Ford Escapes.

==Advertising==
Since 2008, many of Progressive&#x27;s television advertisements have featured a woman named Flo (played by actress Stephanie Courtney), who explains the benefits of Progressive Insurance. In December 2010, the company introduced the &quot;Messenger&quot;, as a complementary campaign. He was played by John Jenkinson. The Flo universe also includes Jamie (Jim Cashman), an awkward fellow Progressive employee; and Bill and Tom, rival insurance salesmen from the figurative straw man &quot;A. Nother Insurance Company&quot;. Bill and Tom were largely discontinued after Allstate filed a claim with the Better Business Bureau alleging that Progressive was making a false claim that they offered discounts that Allstate and other insurance providers did not.

In 2012, Progressive introduced another character, a personified box (voiced by Chris Parnell) representing the company&#x27;s products. It is portrayed as having an entourage (including a personal trainer). Progressive later added more characters like Flobot, Mara (Natalie Palamides), Dr. Rick, and Motaur to its advertising series. In 2019, Progressive began the &quot;At Home with Baker Mayfield&quot; ad campaign during the National Football League season. The campaign featured the Cleveland Browns quarterback living with his wife in FirstEnergy Stadium. After he was traded to the Carolina Panthers in the 2022 offseason, Mayfield stated that the advertisements will end, calling it a &quot;missed opportunity&quot;.

In 2022, Jon Hamm appeared in several TV commercials, as himself, unsuccessfully pursuing a romantic relationship with spokesperson Flo.

==Products==
According to a February 2011 &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; article, Progressive has a leg up on its rivals in Pay As You Drive insurance, a form of vehicle insurance also generically known as usage-based insurance. Progressive has seven U.S. patents covering usage-based insurance methods and systems, with more patents pending. Progressive began working on the concept in the mid-1990s and continues to refine the concept and bring it to the mass market.

Snapshot is Progressive&#x27;s Pay As You Drive, or usage-based insurance program. Snapshot is a voluntary discount program where drivers can save money on their car insurance by sharing their driving habits with Progressive. According to Progressive, Snapshot is best for people who drive less, in safer ways and during safer times of day. Snapshot customers can make changes to their driving habits that will lead to bigger discounts by checking their driving data and projected discount on progressive.com over the course of their initial policy period.

Drivers plug a device the size of a garage door opener into the on-board diagnostic (OBD) port of their car. The device records and sends the driving data to Progressive, and Progressive uses that information to calculate the rate. After 30 days, customers find out if they&#x27;re eligible for a discount based on that 30-day &quot;snapshot&quot; of their driving habits. At the end of a six-month policy period, Progressive calculates the customer&#x27;s renewal discount and customers return the device to Progressive. The company doesn&#x27;t take into account how fast the car goes although it does take into account how fast and frequently the vehicle operator brakes. Snapshot is voluntary and customers can opt out at any time. The customer is charged up to $50.00 if they do not return the snapshot device to Progressive should they decide not to engage in the program after receiving it.

Snapshot is currently available in 45 states plus the District of Columbia. Because insurance is regulated at the state level, Snapshot is currently not available in Alaska, California, Hawaii, and North Carolina.

==Corporate sponsorship==
On December 13, 2006, the company said earnings rose 58 percent in November as the company retained more of the premiums it collected because of comparisons to a month affected by Hurricane Katrina claims.

In 1999, Progressive Auto Insurance was the title sponsor of the Super Bowl XXXIII halftime show.

In January 2008, Jacobs Field in Cleveland, Ohio, home of the Cleveland Guardians, was renamed Progressive Field. Progressive signed a 16-year contract for the naming rights, as well as sponsorship rights to become the Official Auto Insurer of the Cleveland Guardians. The agreement costs around $3.6 million per year. (Mayfield Village, Ohio, where the company is based, is a suburb of Cleveland.) Naming rights for Progressive were extended on April 3, 2024 for an additional 12 years until at least 2036, with an option to extend by 5 years to 2041 if the current lease on the ballpark was extended.

In March 2008, Progressive announced its title sponsorship of the Progressive Insurance Automotive X PRIZE and their funding of the $10 million prize purse. The Progressive Automotive X PRIZE is an international competition designed to inspire a new generation of viable, super fuel-efficient vehicles. The competition is open to teams from around the world that can design, build, and bring to market 100 MPGe (miles per gallon energy equivalent) vehicles.

On December 14, 2010, the Gator Bowl Association announced that Progressive Insurance would become the title sponsor for the 2011 Gator Bowl college football bowl game.

On September 24, 2019, Progressive became the official sponsor of &quot;Friday Night SmackDown&quot; broadcast on Fox.

Starting in 2020, Progressive sponsored Roush Fenway Racing&#x27;s Ryan Newman car at races at Atlanta and Pocono.

==Controversies==
In 2002, the company settled with the State of Georgia in a class action lawsuit over diminished value claims brought by policyholders. Five years later, the company apologized after it was revealed they hired private investigators to infiltrate a church group and pose as congregation members to collect information on litigants seeking redress from the company. Another lawsuit was filed by the litigants over the affair against the company for invasion of privacy and fraud.

In 2009, Progressive was sued for allegedly deceiving policyholders by employing illegally operated, unlicensed body shops to make repairs on vehicles for their clients in order to save money. The court ruled in the company&#x27;s favor on two of the counts and the other four were dropped, pending appeal.

In 2012, the company was widely criticized online for how it handled the claims filed by the family of Kaitlynn Fisher. The 24-year-old died when the car she was driving was hit by another that had run a red light in Baltimore. Progressive fought to avoid paying out the claim to Fisher&#x27;s estate. Fisher&#x27;s insurance policy with Progressive included coverage in the event of an accident with an underinsured driver. The underinsured driver was found to be negligent in a jury trial brought by the Fisher family, in which the Fisher family contended that Progressive provided legal assistance to the defense. In two followup statements, Progressive explained that they did not &quot;serve as the attorney for the defendant in this case&quot; and then clarified that &quot;[a]s a defendant in this case, Progressive participated in the trial procedures on our own behalf.&quot; The company&#x27;s position was that fault for the accident had not been clearly established, since three witnesses (the driver of the other car, that car&#x27;s passenger, and Ms. Fisher&#x27;s passenger) believed that Fisher had run a red light, and filed a motion to intervene to assert that she had been at fault, and therefore was not liable to pay the underinsured motorist claim. The lawyer for the Fisher family countered by noting that two of the three witnesses were not independent, saying &quot;I have an issue with how they examined the evidence to abandon their insured&quot; and introduced the idea the state insurance commissioner could find Progressive had acted in bad faith. As noted, Progressive lost the case and was ordered to pay the underinsured motorist claim in addition to a separate settlement with the Fisher family &quot;to avoid a hearing before the state insurance commissioner&quot;.

<text>The Shaw Prize is a set of three annual awards presented by the Shaw Prize Foundation in the fields of astronomy, medicine and life sciences, and mathematical sciences. Established in 2002 in Hong Kong, by Hong Kong entertainment mogul and philanthropist Run Run Shaw (邵逸夫), the awards honour &quot;individuals who are currently active in their respective fields and who have recently achieved distinguished and significant advances, who have made outstanding contributions in academic and scientific research or applications, or who in other domains have achieved excellence.&quot; The prize has been described as the &quot;Nobel of the East&quot;.

== Award ==
The prize consists of three awards in the fields of astronomy, life science and medicine, and mathematical sciences; it is not awarded posthumously. Nominations are submitted by invited individuals beginning each year in September. Winners are announced in the summer and receive the award at a ceremony in early autumn. Each award consists of a gold medal, a certificate and USD$1.2 million (US$1 million before 2015). The front of the medal bears a portrait of Shaw and the name of the prize in English and Traditional Chinese characters; the back bears the year, category, laureate&#x27;s name and a quotation from the Chinese philosopher Xunzi &quot;制天命而用之&quot; (translated to English as &quot;Grasp the law of nature and make use of it&quot;).

As of 2022, there have been 99 Shaw Laureates. 16 Nobel laureates - Jules A. Hoffmann, Bruce Beutler, Saul Perlmutter, Adam Riess, Shinya Yamanaka, Robert Lefkowitz, Brian Schmidt, Jeffrey C. Hall, Michael Rosbash, Michael W. Young, Kip Thorne, Rainer Weiss, Jim Peebles, Michel Mayor, Reinhard Genzel, and David Julius - are Shaw Laureates. The inaugural laureate of the Shaw Prize in Astronomy was Jim Peebles, honored for his contributions to cosmology. Two inaugural prizes were awarded for the Shaw Prize in Life Science and Medicine: Stanley Norman Cohen, Herbert Boyer and Yuet Wai Kan jointly won one of them for their research in DNA while physiologist Richard Doll won the other for his contribution to cancer epidemiology. Shiing-Shen Chern was awarded the inaugural Shaw Prize in Mathematical Sciences for his work on differential geometry.

<text>Gavin Maxwell (15 July 19147 September 1969) was a Scottish naturalist and author, best known for his non-fiction writing and his work with otters. He became most famous for &quot;Ring of Bright Water&quot; (1960) and its sequels, which described his experiences raising Iraqi and West African otters on the west coast of Scotland. One of his Iraqi otters was of a previously unknown sub-species which was subsequently named after Maxwell. &quot;Ring of Bright Water&quot; sold more than a million copies and was made into a film starring Bill Travers and Virginia McKenna in 1969. His other books described sharking in the Hebrides and his travels in Iraq, Morocco, and Algeria, as well as studies of recent history in Sicily and Morocco.

==Early life==
Gavin Maxwell was the youngest son of Lieutenant-Colonel Aymer Maxwell and Lady Mary Percy, fifth daughter of the seventh Duke of Northumberland. His paternal grandfather, Sir Herbert Maxwell, 7th Baronet, was an archaeologist, politician and natural historian.

Maxwell was born at The House of Elrig near the small village of Elrig, near Port William, in Wigtownshire, south-western Scotland. Maxwell&#x27;s relatives still live in the area and the family&#x27;s ancient estate and grounds are in nearby Monreith.

Maxwell&#x27;s education took place at a succession of preparatory and public schools, including the sporty Heddon Court School at East Barnet, St Cyprian&#x27;s School, where he found encouragement for his interest in natural history, and Stowe School. In &quot;The Rocks Remain&quot;, he relates how family pressure led him to take a degree in Estate Management at Hertford College, Oxford, where he spent his time pursuing sporting and leisure activities instead of studying. He cheated his way through the intermediate exams but passed the final examinations honestly, having crammed the entire three-year course in six weeks.


During World War II, Maxwell served as an instructor with the Special Operations Executive. He was invalided out with the rank of Major in 1944. After the war, he purchased the Isle of Soay off Skye in the Inner Hebrides, Scotland. According to his book &quot;Harpoon at a Venture&quot; (1952), bad planning and a lack of finance meant his attempt to establish a basking shark fishery there between 1945 and 1948 proved unsuccessful and the island was sold to his business partner, Tex Geddes. Living in London, he became a close friend of British-Swiss Nobel Prize winner Elias Canetti.

==Career==
In 1956, Maxwell toured the reed marshes of southern Iraq with explorer Wilfred Thesiger, Maxwell&#x27;s wife&#x27;s first cousin once removed. Maxwell&#x27;s account of their trip appears in &quot;A Reed Shaken By The Wind&quot;, later published under the title &quot;People of the Reeds&quot;. It was hailed by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;near perfect&quot;.

Since 1948, Maxwell had been using a borrowed cottage in Sandaig as a writer&#x27;s retreat (which he called &quot;Camusfeàrna&quot; in his books). Sandaig was a small community opposite Isleornsay on a remote part of the Scottish mainland. This is where his &quot;otter books&quot; are set. After &quot;Ring of Bright Water&quot; (1960), his newfound fame did not sit well with him:

In &quot;The Rocks Remain&quot; (1963), the otters Edal, Teko, Mossy and Monday show great differences in personality. The book demonstrates the difficulty Maxwell was having, possibly as a result of his mental state, in remaining focused on one project and the impact that had on his otters, Sandaig and his own life.

In 1960-1962, he made several trips to Morocco and Algeria. He published accounts of his experiences in North Africa, including his description of the aftermath of the 1960 Agadir earthquake, in &quot;The Rocks Remain&quot; (1963). In Morocco, he was assisted by the monarchy&#x27;s head of Press Services and Minister of Information Moulay Ahmed Alaoui, and by the anticolonial activist and journalist Margaret Pope, who Maxwell referred to in &quot;The Rocks Remain&quot; under a pseudonym, &quot;Prudence Hazell.&quot; Pope recruited Maxwell to travel to Algiers in January 1961 to collect information for the Algerian revolutionary National Liberation Front (FLN). Maxwell also began research for a non-fiction book tracing the dramatic lives of the last rulers of Marrakech under the French, eventually published in 1966 as &quot;Lords of the Atlas: The Rise and Fall of the House of Glaoua 1893–1956&quot;. During the Moroccan Years of Lead, the regime there considered his book subversive and banned its importation.

In &quot;The House of Elrig&quot; (1965), Maxwell describes his family history and his passion for the calf-country, Galloway, where he was born. It was during this period that he met ornithologist Peter Scott and the young Terry Nutkins, who later became a children&#x27;s television presenter.

In 1968, Maxwell&#x27;s Sandaig home was destroyed by fire, in which Edal perished, and he moved to the lighthouse keepers&#x27; cottages on Eilean Bàn (White Island), an island between the Isle of Skye and the Scottish mainland by the village of Kyleakin. He invited John Lister-Kaye to join him on Eilean Bàn to help him build a zoo on the island and work on a book about British wild mammals. Lister-Kaye accepted the invitation, but both projects were abandoned when Maxwell died from lung cancer in a hospital in Inverness the following year.

Maxwell&#x27;s literary agent was Peter Janson-Smith, who was also agent for James Bond author Ian Fleming. Maxwell also lived in Paultons Square in London.

==Memorial==
Eilean Bàn now supports a pier of the Skye Bridge, built during the 1990s. Despite modern traffic a hundred feet or so above it, the island is a commemorative otter sanctuary and houses a museum dedicated to Maxwell. Another memorial is a bronze otter erected at Monreith near to St Medan&#x27;s Golf Club.

==Personal life==
Privately homosexual, Maxwell married Lavinia Renton (daughter of The Right Honourable Sir Alan Lascelles and granddaughter of Viscount Chelmsford, Wilfred Thesiger&#x27;s uncle) on 1 February 1962. The marriage lasted little more than a year and they divorced in 1964.

According to Douglas Botting, Maxwell suffered from bipolar disorder throughout his life. 

==Gavin Maxwell&#x27;s otter==

Maxwell&#x27;s book &quot;Ring of Bright Water&quot; describes how, in 1956, he brought a smooth-coated otter back from Iraq and raised it in &quot;Camusfearna&quot; at Sandaig Bay on the west coast of Scotland. He took the otter, called Mijbil, to the London Zoological Society, where it was decided that this was a previously unknown subspecies of smooth-coated otter. It was therefore named &quot;Lutrogale perspicillata maxwelli&quot; (or, colloquially, &quot;Maxwell&#x27;s otter&quot;) after him. While it was thought to have become extinct in the alluvial salt marshes of Iraq as a result of the large-scale drainage of the area that started in the 1960s, newer surveys suggest large populations remain throughout its range, though they still remain vulnerable.

In his book &quot;The Marsh Arabs&quot;, Wilfred Thesiger wrote:

The otter became woven into the fabric of Maxwell&#x27;s life. The title of his book &quot;Ring of Bright Water&quot; was taken from the poem &quot;The Marriage of Psyche&quot; by Kathleen Raine, who said in her autobiography that Maxwell had been the love of her life. Raine&#x27;s relationship with Maxwell deteriorated after 1956 when she indirectly caused the death of Mijbil. Raine held herself responsible not only for losing Mijbil but for a curse she had uttered shortly beforehand, frustrated by Maxwell&#x27;s homosexuality: &quot;Let Gavin suffer in this place as I am suffering now.&quot; Raine blamed herself thereafter for all Maxwell&#x27;s misfortunes, beginning with Mijbil&#x27;s death and ending with the cancer that took him at age 55 on 7 September 1969.

Maxwell&#x27;s ashes were placed beneath a boulder at the former site of his house &quot;Camusfeàrna&quot;. The boulder marks the position of his writing desk.

<text>Jökulsárlón (; translates to &quot;glacial river lagoon&quot;) is a large glacial lake in southern part of Vatnajökull National Park, Iceland. Situated at the head of the Breiðamerkurjökull glacier, it developed into a lake after the glacier started receding in the late 19th century. The lake has grown since then at varying rates because of melting of the glaciers. The glacial front is now about away from the ocean&#x27;s edge and the lake covers an area of about . In 2009 it was reported to be the deepest lake in Iceland, at over , as glacial retreat extended its boundaries. The size of the lake has increased fourfold since the 1970s.

The lake can be seen from Route 1 between Höfn and Skaftafell. It appears as &quot;a ghostly procession of luminous blue icebergs&quot;.

Jökulsárlón has been a setting for four Hollywood movies: &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;, &quot;Die Another Day&quot;, &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&quot;, and &quot;Batman Begins&quot;, as well as the reality TV series &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;. In 1991, Iceland issued a postage stamp, with a face value of 26 kronur, depicting Jökulsárlón.

The tongue of the Breiðamerkurjökull glacier is a major attraction for tourists.

== Formation ==

=== Lagoon ===
Jökulsárlón is the largest and most active glacial lake in Iceland. It provides outstanding views of the ice cap Vatnajökull, a vast dome of ice that rises to a height of and shows how the outlet glacier Breiðamerkurjökull calves into the lagoon. 

The lagoon started to form in 1930&#x27;s after the glacier Breiðamerkurjökull started to recede in the late 19th century, and it is getting bigger because the glacier is receding about 200m every year. Icebergs gather at the mouth of the lake&#x27;s shallow exit, melt down into smaller ice blocks, and roll out into the sea. Ice water and soil make a unique ecological phenomenon. Jökulsárlón Lake, the &quot;glacier lake&quot;, was reported to have doubled in size in the 15-year period before 2007. The huge blocks of ice that calve from the edge of Vatnajökull are about high, which fills the lagoon stocked with icebergs. Some icebergs appear naturally sculpted on account volcanic ash from ancient eruptions that partly covers them.

====Icebergs====
The icebergs that calve from the glacier edge move towards the river mouth and get entrenched at the bottom. The movement of the icebergs fluctuates with the tide currents, as well as being affected by wind. However, they start floating as icebergs when their size is small enough to drift to the sea. These icebergs are seen in two shades: milky white and bright blue, which depends on the air trapped within the ice and is an interplay of light and ice crystals.

=== Glacier - Breiðamerkurjökull ===
The outlet glacier that feeds the lagoon is called Breiðamerkurjökull.

=== Out-wash plains - Breiðamerkursandur ===
The glacier is responsible for the formation of a large outwash plain called Breiðamerkursandur. It has a breadth of around 25 km and serves as bird habitat in the summer month. This outwash plain is constantly changing. The shoreline of the glacial lagoon used to be advancing, but is now retreating as there is a decrease in glacial rivers depositing material. However, as the glaciers melt, the land rises around 2–4 cm each year somewhat balancing out the retreating shoreline.

==Fauna==
The lake is filled with fish that drift in from the sea along with the tides. Seals gather in large numbers at the mouth of the lake to catch fish during the winter. Large numbers of seabirds, particularly Arctic terns, which nest nearby, gather to catch herring, trout, salmon, krill and other fish. Breiðamerkursandur (the large sand deposits in the area) is the main habitat of the Arctic skua (&quot;Stercorarius parasiticus&quot;). During the summer season, the gull-like skuas have their nests on the lake&#x27;s shores. The skuas, fat and dark in colour with white wingtips, are said to be aggressive &quot;pirates of the seas&quot;, which harass other birds as big as gannets. They also kill and eat smaller birds such as puffins. Great skuas are not afraid of human beings and also do not tolerate human beings close to their nests. These birds are reported to migrate from their wintering grounds off the coasts of Spain and Africa. Seals are seen either swimming in the lagoon or lying on icebergs. Many times, the tides carry shoals of herring or capelan into the lagoon by the tide and the birds feast on them.

==Land Use History==
=== Land Settlement and Farms ===
The first settlers arrived in Iceland around AD 870, when the edge of the tongue of Breiðamerkurjökull glacier was about further north of its present location. During the Little Ice Age between 1600 and 1900, with lower temperatures prevailing in these latitudes, the glacier had grown by up to about from the coast at Jokulsá River, by about 1890. When the temperatures rose between 1920 and 1965, the Breiðamerkurjökull glacier tongue rapidly retreated, continually creating icebergs of varying size, thus creating a lagoon in its wake around 1934–35. The lake is over deep where the glacier snout originally existed. Glacial moraines became exposed on both sides of the lake. In 1975, the lake was about in area and now it reportedly stands at at the edge of the glacier tongue.

=== Current Ownership ===
In 2017 the Icelandic State bought the farm Fell which includes Jökulsárlón. Later that same year Fell and other public land surrounding Jökulsárlón got protected as a part of Vatnajökull National Park.

The Jökulsárlón Landowners Association represented the owners of the land property Fell. This property was leased out for filming or any other commercial activity as required.

Einar Björn Einarsson is the operator of the boat trips on Jökulsárlón. The Landowners Association leased out the site at the lagoon front to this operator to ply the boats on the lagoon.

=== Nature Protection ===
Jökulsárlón and the surrounding area are a part of Vatnajökull National park. The size of the park is 14,967 km2   Which is approximately 14% of Iceland, making it Europe&#x27;s second largest national park in terms of area after Yugyd Va in Russia. On 5 July 2019, Vatnajökull National Park was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The unique qualities of Vatnajökull National Park are primarily its great variety of landscape features, created by the combined forces of rivers, glacial ice, and volcanic and geothermal activity. The National Park aims to preserve unimpaired the natural beauty of the park for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations.
===Protective measures for the bridge===
A coffer dam was constructed near the Glacial River Bridge that spans Jökulsárlón to build a row of protective measures of stone boulders to prevent any erosion of the foundation of the pillars of the bridge. This coffer dam enabled the Icelandic road administration to create workable access for the power shovel digger to place the row of stone protective measures, which would also divert the icebergs from hitting the bridge pillars, thus avoiding damage to the structure.

Given the current retreat rate of Vatnajökull, likely a deep fjord will develop where Jökulsárlón is now. This retreat is also posing a threat to the National Highway Route 1 of Iceland. The lagoon is to the west of Höfn town and east of Skaftafell. It is accessible by the ring road, Route 1, that goes across the lake, and where parking facilities have been provided for visitors. It is also known as the &quot;tourist conveyor belt&quot;. Isolated large blocks of icebergs can be seen on the black sand beach, sometimes called &quot;diamond beach&quot; because of ice chunks scattered on the sand.
The name of the beach is actually Eystri-Fellsfjara. 

==Tourism and Services==

===Activities===

There are many activities available to guests at Jökulsárlón. There are lagoon tours provided by several different companies in boats or kayaks. In the winter there are ice cave tours that leave from the lagoon parking lot. There are hiking trails around the area that offer guests an opportunity to explore the area.

====Boat tours on the glacier lake====
In 1985, the premiere of the James Bond movie &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; marked the start of commercial boat tours on the lake. Guðbrandur Jóhannesson started the tours on Jökulsárlón. Jóhannesson, who today owns and operates the company Vatnajökull Travel , operated the tours for the first two years. In summer 1987, about 5,000 passengers sailed on the company&#x27;s two small vessels. The next year, an amphibious vehicle, the LARC-V, joined the fleet. By 1995, the number of passengers per year had multiplied and the company then operated three amphibious vehicles. In 1999, Einar Björn Einarsson, a local from the nearby town of Höfn, bought the company. In 2006, the company added a fourth amphibian.

The company Jökulsárlón ehf now employs about 30 seasonal employees. For the past few years, the company has carried 60,000 to 70,000 passengers annually; since the first commercial boat tour, about 900,000 tourists have taken the excursion.

=== Services ===
There are park rangers working in the area all year round. During the summer months park rangers offer free educational walks for park visitors.

==In popular culture==

Jökulsárlón and the Breiðamerkurjökull glacier have been part of the James Bond films &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; (1985) and &quot;Die Another Day&quot; (2002), &quot;Batman Begins&quot; (2005), &quot;Beowulf and Grendel&quot; (2005), &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&quot; (2001) and &quot;Dilwale&quot; 

The popularity of the lake has been further boosted by the TV coverage provided live from Jökulsárlón on the American TV program &quot;Good Morning America&quot; in southeast Iceland, on 13 November 2006.
The live broadcast is reported to have been watched by four million people.

In 2014, Swedish electronic multimedia project, iamamiwhoami, filmed their music video &quot;vista&quot; in Jökulsárlón.

In October 2014, scenes of French singer Indila&#x27;s music video &quot;Love Story&quot; were filmed at the lagoon.

<text>Fjallsárlón () is a glacier lake at the south end of the Icelandic glacier Vatnajökull. &quot;Fjallsjökull&quot; which is part of the bigger glacier reaches down to the water of the lake and some ice-bergs are drifting by on its surface.

The glacier calving into the lagoon is a part of Vatnajökull National Park and the better known glacier lake Jökulsárlón is not far from there. From the glacier lake Breiðárlón a little river flows into the Fjallsárlón.

Above, there is looming the volcano Öræfajökull.

At its shore, in the summertime, it is better to beware of the skúas, big seagulls which have their nests on the ground around the lake.

<text>Colonel Frederick Gustavus Burnaby (3 March 1842 – 17 January 1885) was a British Army intelligence officer. Burnaby&#x27;s adventurous spirit, pioneering achievements, and swashbuckling courage earned an affection in the minds of Victorian imperial idealists. As well as travelling across Europe and Central Asia, he mastered ballooning, spoke a number of foreign languages fluently, stood for parliament twice, published several books, and was admired and feted by the women of London high society. His popularity was legendary, appearing in a number of stories and tales of empire.

== Early life ==
Frederick Burnaby was born in Bedford, the son of the Rev. Gustavus Andrew Burnaby of Somerby Hall, Leicestershire, and canon of Middleham in Yorkshire (d. 15 July 1872), by Harriet, sister of Henry Villebois of Marham House, Norfolk (d. 1883). His sister Mary married John Manners-Sutton. He was a first cousin of Edwyn Burnaby and of Louisa Cavendish-Bentinck. Fred was educated at Bedford School, Harrow, Oswestry School, where he was a contemporary of William Archibald Spooner, and in Germany. Legend has it he could carry two boys under both arms up the stairs of school house. Burnaby was a huge man for his times: 6 ft 4in tall and 20 stone when fully grown. His outsize personality and strength became the literary legend of imperial might. Lionised by the press for his outlandish expeditious adventures across Central Asia, Burnaby at 6 ft 4 ins tall with broad shoulders was a giant amongst men, symbolic of a Victorian celebrity, feted in London society.

He entered the Royal Horse Guards in 1859. Finding no chance for active service, his spirit of adventure sought outlets in balloon ascents and in travels through Spain and Russia with his firm friend, George Radford. In the summer of 1874 he accompanied the Carlist forces in Spain as correspondent for &quot;The Times&quot;, but before the end of the war he was transferred to Africa to report on Gordon&#x27;s expedition to the Sudan. This took Burnaby as far as Khartoum.

== Military adventures ==
Returning to England in March 1875, he formulated his plans for a journey on horseback to the Khanate of Khiva through Russian Asia, which had just been closed to travellers. War had broken out between the Russian army and the Turcoman tribesmen of the desert. He planned to visit St. Petersburg to meet Count Milyutin, the Minister of War to the Tsar. Travelling at his own expense carrying an 85 lb pack, he departed London Victoria station on 30 November 1875. The Russians announced they would protect the soldier along the route, but to all intents and purposes this proved impossible. The accomplishment of this task, in the winter of 1875–1876, with the aim of reciprocity for India and the Tsarist State, was described in his book &quot;A Ride to Khiva&quot;, and brought him immediate fame. The city of Merv was inaccessible, but presented a potential military flashpoint. The Russians knew that British Intelligence gathered information along the frontier. Similar expeditions had taken place under Captain George Napier (1874) and Colonel Charles MacGregor (1875). By Christmas, Burnaby had arrived at Orenburg. In receipt of orders prohibiting progress into Persia from Russian-held territory, he was warned not to advance. A fluent Russian speaker, he was not coerced; arriving at a Russian garrison, the officers entertaining the former Khan of Kokand.

Hiring a servant and horses his party trudged through the snow to Kazala, intending a crossing into Afghanistan from Merv. Extreme winter blizzards brought frostbite, treated with &quot;naphtha&quot;, a Cossack emetic. Close to death, Burnaby took three weeks to recover. Having received conflicted accounts of the dubious privilege of Russian hospitality it was a welcome release, he later told his book, to be cheered with vodka. It was another 400 miles south to Khiva, when he was requested to divert to Petro Alexandrovsk, a Russian fortress garrison. Lurid tales of wild tribesmen awaiting his desert travails ready to &quot;gouge out his eyes&quot; were intended to discourage. He ignored the escort, believing the tribes more friendly than the Russians. Intending to go via Bokhara and Merv, he deviated, cutting two days off the journey. Leaving Kazala on 12 January 1876 with a servant, guide, three camels and a &quot;kibitka&quot;, Burnaby bribed the servant with 100 Roubles a day to avoid the fortress where he would be bound to be delayed. A local mullah wrote an introduction note to the Khan, and clad in furs they traversed the freezing desert. On the banks of River, 60 miles from the capital, he was met by the Khan&#x27;s nobleman, who guided the escort into the city. Burnaby&#x27;s book outlined in some detail the events of the following days, the successful outcome of the meetings, and the decision he took to evade the Russian army. The Khanate was already at war, his possessions seized; the Russians intended a march from Tashkent to seize Kashgar, Merv and Herat. Protestations of neutrality were a sham. Burnaby gained respect from the population, who bowed in homage at a soldier &quot;en passant&quot;. But on return to his quarters he received a note of orders from Horse Guards to return via Russia. Frustrated Burnaby learnt of the overwhelming numerical superiority the Tsarists presented. To his great surprise he was received as a brother officer at Petro Alexandrovsk. Colonel Ivanov was smug and proud declared the fate of Merv &quot;must be decided by the sword.&quot; Released by the Khan&#x27;s Treasurer he travelled for nine days with Cossacks across the snowy plains of Kazala. Hard-bitten and hungry he sat on a small pony for 900 miles. &quot;En route&quot; he heard of what later was described in parliament as the Bulgarian Horrors, and a forthcoming campaign against Yakub Beg in Kashgaria.

On arrival back in England, March 1876, he was received by Commander-in-Chief, Prince George, Duke of Cambridge, whose praise marvelled at Burnaby&#x27;s feats of derring-do and impressive physique. Burnaby&#x27;s fame grew celebrated in London society, in newspaper and magazines. His guest appearances flattered to deceive, when he learnt that he had travelled with the ringleaders of the Cossack Revolt. The rising of the Eastern Question in parliament was sparked in a village in Hercegovina and spread to Bosnia, Serbia, Montenegro and Bulgaria. Outraged by the pogroms the Prime Minister ordered immediate diplomatic efforts, while W. E. Gladstone demanded an aggressive clear out of the Sultanate from Europe. It was in the crucible of this crisis that Burnaby planned a second expedition. At Constantinople he had planned to meet Count Ignatiev, the Russian ambassador, whom he missed on his journey across Turkey on horseback, through Asia Minor, from Scutari to Erzerum, with the object of observing the Russian frontier, an account of which he afterwards published. He was warned the Russian garrison had issued an arrest warrant; turning back at the frontier he took ship on the Black Sea via the Bosphorus and the Mediterranean. In April 1877 Russia declared war on Turkey. The inexorable conclusion was drawn in Calcutta and London that Russia would not avoid, but wanted war; planning more attacks still. Eager for Russian rule, Colonel N L Grodekov had built a road from Tashkent to Herat via Samarkand, anticipating a war of conquest. Burnaby&#x27;s warnings that the bellicose Russians posed a serious threat to India were confirmed later by Lord Curzon, and an expedition much later under the Arabist Colonel Francis Younghusband, witnessed by the genesis of a Cossack invasion.

&quot;See main article: Russo-Turkish War of 1877&quot;

Burnaby (who soon afterwards became lieutenant-colonel) acted as travelling agent to the Stafford House Red Cross Committee, but had to return to England before the campaign was over.

In 1879 he married Elizabeth Hawkins-Whitshed, who had inherited her father&#x27;s lands at Greystones, Ireland. The previously named Hawkins-Whitshed estate at Greystones is known as The Burnaby to this day. At this point began his active interest in politics, and in 1880 he unsuccessfully contested Birmingham in the Tory-Democrat interest, which was followed by a second attempt in 1885.

On 23 March 1882 he crossed the English Channel in a gas balloon. Having been disappointed in his hope of seeing active service in the Egyptian Campaign of 1882, he participated in the Suakin campaign of 1884 without official leave, and was wounded at El Teb when acting as an intelligence officer for his friend General Valentine Baker.

=== Death ===
The aforementioned events did not deter Burnaby from a similar course when a fresh expedition started up the Nile. He was given a post by Lord Wolseley, involved first in the skirmish at El Teb, until he met his death in the hand-to-hand fighting of the Battle of Abu Klea. As a gap in the lines opened up the Colonel rushed out to rescue a colleague and was wounded outside the square. Corporal Mackintosh went to his rescue driving his bayonet into the assailant. Lieutenant-Colonel Lord Binning rushed out to give him some water, twice. On the last occasion he came across a private crying, holding the dying man&#x27;s head. He had been struck again by a Mahdist spear through the neck and throat. The young soldier was tearful because Burnaby was revered as one of the great Victorian heroes. A courageous man of charm and supreme self-sacrifice, who was admired and respected in equal measure. Lord Binning recalled &quot;that in our little force his death caused a feeling akin to consternation. In my own detachment many of the men sat down and cried&quot;. Private Steele who went to help him won the Distinguished Conduct Medal. There are two memorials erected to his memory in Holy Trinity Garrison and Parish Church in Windsor, the first by the officers and men of the Royal Horse Guards and the second, a privately funded memorial from Edward, Prince of Wales.

== Cultural references ==
Henry Newbolt&#x27;s poem &quot;Vitaï Lampada&quot; is often quoted as referring to Burnaby&#x27;s death at Abu Klea; &quot;The Gatling&#x27;s jammed and the Colonel&#x27;s dead...&quot;, (although it was a Gardner machine gun which jammed). It was, perhaps, because of an impromptu order by Burnaby (who, as a , had no official capacity in the battle) that the Dervishes managed to get inside the square. Yet the song &quot;Colonel Burnaby&quot; was written in his honour and his portrait hangs in the National Portrait Gallery, London. There are two contradictory accounts:

# The report in &quot;The Times&quot;, says that Burnaby fell while re-forming a broken British square, this being one of only two recorded cases of a British square breaking in the 19th century.
# Another account says that the square did not break, but men were ordered to pull aside temporarily to let the Gardner gun and then the Heavy Camel Corps get out and attack the enemy. Some Dervishes got inside before the gap closed, but the back ranks of the square faced-about and made an end of the intruders.

Burnaby&#x27;s &quot;Ride to Khiva&quot; appears in Joseph Conrad&#x27;s 1898 short story, &quot;Youth,&quot; when the young Marlow recounts how he &quot;read for the first time &quot;Sartor Resartus&quot; and Burnaby&#x27;s &quot;Ride to Khiva&quot;,&quot; preferring &quot;the soldier to the philosopher at the time.&quot;

Burnaby appears as a balloonist in Julian Barnes&#x27;s memoir &quot;Levels of Life&quot; (2014), where he is portrayed as having a (fictional) love affair with Sarah Bernhardt.

It has been suggested that Burnaby may have been (in part) an inspiration for the creation of George MacDonald Fraser&#x27;s fictional anti-hero Harry Flashman.

== Legacy ==
A tall Portland stone obelisk in the churchyard of St Philip&#x27;s Cathedral, Birmingham commemorates his life. Besides Burnaby&#x27;s bust, in relief, it carries only the word &quot;Burnaby&quot;, and the dated place names &quot;Khiva 1875&quot; and &quot;Abu Klea 1885&quot;. The obelisk was unveiled by Lord Charles Beresford on 13 November 1885.

There is a memorial window to Burnaby at St Peter&#x27;s Church, Bedford. There is also a public house, The Burnaby Arms, located in the Black Tom area of Bedford. The organ at Oswestry School Chapel was given in his memory.

William Kinnard, who was instrumental in acquiring a post office for a tiny settlement at the base of Morgan&#x27;s Point on Lake Erie&#x27;s North Shore in Ontario, Canada, &quot;suggested the name Burnaby&quot; for the settlement after an article he had read in The Globe newspaper about a Colonel who had been killed in the Egyptian War.

<text>Breiðárlón () is a glacier lake at the south end of the Icelandic glacier Vatnajökull. Formed at the terminus of one of Vatnajökull&#x27;s biggest outlets, Breiðamerkurjökull, Breiðárlón lies in between Fjallsárlón and Jökulsárlón glacier lagoons.

The glacier calving into the lagoon is a part of Vatnajökull National Park and the better known glacier lake Jökulsárlón is not far from there. From Breiðárlón a little river flows into the Fjallsárlón.

<text>This is a list of insurance companies based in the United States. These are companies with a strong national or regional presence, having insurance as their primary business.

== History ==
In 1752, Benjamin Franklin founded the first American insurance company as Philadelphia Contributionship. In 1820, there were 17 stock life insurance companies in the state of New York, many of which would subsequently fail. Between 1870 and 1872, 33 US life insurance companies failed, in part fueled by bad practices and incidents such as the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. 3,800 property-liability and 2,270 life insurance companies were operating in the United States by 1989.

<text>In music, a pensato () is a composed imaginary note, a written note which is neither played nor heard. &quot;This meant that a note had to be so indescribably tender and soft that it was only allowed to be thought of.&quot; (Score 1958)

Anton Webern is credited by some with the first use of pensatos, while others argue he did not use them at all. As Alex Ross (2007: 69, quoted in Toop 2016: 158) puts it: &quot;The Joke went around that Webern had introduced the marking &quot;pensato&quot;: Don&#x27;t play the note, only think it.&quot; George Perle (1990: ), noting that &quot;no composer has ever been more concrete, explicit, detailed, and subtle in his notation,&quot; argues that if Webern did use a pensato, it would have been a pitch &quot;with all the attributes that give a note actuality: pitch, duration, mode of attack and release, timbre, intensity,&quot; and not a pitch class. He also points to a &quot;verifiable &quot;pensato&quot;&quot; in the last bar of Alban Berg&#x27;s &quot;Lyric Suite&quot;: &quot;The instruments drop out one by one, the four parts converging into a single line that continues into an &quot;ostinato&quot; on the last two notes of the derived series and becomes inaudible on the penultimate note of the series, seemingly continuing into the silence beyond.&quot; (Perle, 1985: 14) The last measure of the score is marked &quot;dimin.&quot;, then &quot;morendo...*&quot;, then the asterisk reads: &quot;*)bis zum völligen Verlöschen, daher die letzte Terz &quot;Des—F&quot; eventuell noch ein-, zweimal wiederholen. Keinesfalls aber auf &quot;Des&quot; schließen!&quot; (&quot;until completely extinguished, repeat the last third of Des — F once or twice. In no case, however, conclude to Des!&quot;) Presumably an expression of unrequited love (Santos 2014: 35).

<text>Marina Vlady (born 10 May 1938) is a French actress.

==Biography==
Vlady was born in Clichy, Hauts-de-Seine to White Russian immigrant parents. Her father was an opera singer and her mother was a dancer. Her sisters, now all deceased, were the actresses Odile Versois, Hélène Vallier and Olga Baïdar-Poliakoff. The sisters began acting as children and, for a while, pursued a ballet career.

From 1955 to 1959, she was married to actor/director Robert Hossein. From 1963 to 1966, she was married to Jean-Claude Brouillet, a French entrepreneur, owner of two airlines and member of French Resistance. Vlady was married to Soviet poet/songwriter Vladimir Vysotsky from 1969 until his death in 1980. She lived with French oncologist Léon Schwartzenberg from the 1980s until his death in 2003.

Vlady won the Best Actress Award at the 1963 Cannes Film Festival for &quot;The Conjugal Bed&quot;. In 1965, she was a member of the jury at the 4th Moscow International Film Festival.

Vlady starred in Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s &quot;2 ou 3 choses que je sais d&#x27;elle&quot; (1967), and later portrayed the insightful and protective stepmother in the Italian film &quot;Il sapore del grano (aka: The Flavor of Corn)&quot; (1986). A rare English language role was as Kate Percy in Orson Welles&#x27; &quot;Chimes at Midnight&quot; (1966). Her television credits include the 1983 mini-series &quot;La Chambre des Dames&quot;.

She wrote &quot;Vladimir, or the Aborted Flight&quot;, a memoir of her relationship with Vladimir Vysotsky.

For a decade, the couple maintained a long-distance relationship as Vlady compromised her career in France in order to spend more time in Moscow, and his friends pulled strings for him to travel abroad. She eventually joined the Communist Party of France, which essentially gave her an unlimited-entry visa into the Soviet Union, and provided Vysotsky with some immunity against prosecution by the government. The problems of his long-distance relationship with Vlady inspired several of Vysotsky&#x27;s songs.

==Politics==
In 1971, Vlady signed the Manifesto of the 343, which publicly declared she had an abortion as a way to advocate for abortion, even though the procedure was illegal in France at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;nouvelobs/20071127.OBS7018/343&quot;&gt;*
*&lt;/ref&gt;

Vlady and partner Léon Schwartzenberg participated in the protests against deportations of Arab workers from France. She accepted a role in a film about a gay couple from Iran.

<text>Alexander Mitscherlich (28 May 1836 in Berlin – 31 May 1918 in Oberstdorf) was a German chemist and son of Eilhard Mitscherlich.

He studied at University of Göttingen, where he also became member of Burschenschaft Hannovera (fraternity).

His most important work was in the field of processing wood to create cellulose. He patented an early version of the sulfite process in 1882.

In 1909 Mitscherlich wrote on crop yields in agronomy. His results have been characterized as the &quot;sum of two exponential processes.&quot;

A historian of plant science wrote in 1942:
:A working model of the soil: Liebig&#x27;s Law of the Minimum was the formulation of an idea that yield of a crop was determined primarily by the amounts of plant food that were present in minimum quantities. His idea was discussed later as the Limiting Factor by BLACKMAN and again by MITSCHERLICH as the Law of Physiological Relations. The latter was expressed as a logarithmic function between yield and the quantity of plant food constituents, which is virtually the Law of Diminishing Returns.

<text>Youth crew is a music subculture of hardcore punk, which was particularly prominent during the New York hardcore scene of the late 1980s. Youth crew is distinguished from other punk styles by its optimism and moralistic outlook. The original youth crew bands and fans were predominantly straight edge (abstaining from alcohol and drugs) and vegetarian.

Early musical influences included Minor Threat, Bad Brains, Negative Approach, 7 Seconds, and Black Flag. While some youth crew music is similar to melodic hardcore, other styles can be very thrash metal-influenced and also includes breakdowns intended for the hardcore dancing style associated with live performances. Youth of Today was a very thrashy youth crew band, with abrasive vocals and fast songs too short to include much melody (similar to early Agnostic Front, and contrasting with the other big New York City youth crew bands such as Gorilla Biscuits). Later youth crew bands took increasing influence from heavy metal.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;crew&quot; was used by many first wave hardcore punk bands of the early 80s. 7 Seconds named their debut LP record &quot;The Crew&quot; in 1984, which also contained the song &quot;The Crew&quot;. Some other notable examples of this are Boston straight edge bands like SS Decontrol, Negative FX, DYS and other associates calling themselves the &quot;Boston Crew&quot;, bands in the Reno area (most notably 7 Seconds) used to refer to themselves as the &quot;Skeeno Crew&quot;. John L Hancock III (aka RatBoy) designed a T-shirt and wrote the Youth of Today song &quot;Youth Crew&quot; which appeared on their 1985 &quot;Can&#x27;t Close My Eyes&quot; 7&quot;. Warzone also had a song called &quot;We&#x27;re the Crew&quot; on their 1988 album &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget the Struggle, Don&#x27;t Forget the Streets.&quot; Judge also released a song called &quot;New York Crew&quot; in 1988.

== History ==
Youth crew was most popular from 1986 to 1992, primarily in New York City tri-state region and, to a lesser degree, California. It was inspired by bands such as 7 Seconds, Minor Threat and SSD, whose members were all straight edge, and lyrical concerns included brotherhood and community values. The sound was largely defined by a series of releases by labels such as Revelation Records, including albums by Youth of Today, Chain of Strength, Gorilla Biscuits, Bold, Judge, and Side By Side. However, many of these bands were more aggressive in their attitudes. Ray Cappo eventually converted to the Hare Krishna faith, and 108 and the Cro-Mags also participated in the Krishnacore offshoot. The California band Vegan Reich established the hardline wing of straight edge youth crew hardcore. Although hardline had few adherents, its attitudes and militancy had a notable effect on later bands such as Earth Crisis and Racetraitor. The &quot;Youth Crew&quot; scene also included the participation of skinheads, many of whom were fans of Warzone, Cro-Mags and Youth Defense League. Youth crew bands were contemporary to, though noticeably distinct from, crossover thrash, thrashcore, crust punk, melodic hardcore, and emo bands. The music of youth crew bands was originally intended to be a reaction against the metal-influenced hardcore that groups like Agnostic Front and the Cro-Mags made popular at the time, by using a sound that called back to earlier punk rock–leaning hardcore acts. However, later youth crew bands, namely Judge, began to take heavily from metal, helping to lead to the development of beatdown hardcore.

The end of the 1980s also saw the beginning of the Durham, England scene, one of the few youth crew scenes outside of the U.S. Heavily inspired by the sound of U.S. youth crew and straight edge bands, groups in the scene included Steadfast, False Face, No Way Out, Long Cold Stare, Know Your Enemy, The MacDonalds and Northern Wolfpack. Members of multiple of these bands would eventually form Voorhees.

The 1990s saw the emergence of groups inspired by this scene, as well as by thrash and death metal. These bands, including Earth Crisis, Snapcase, One Life Crew, Integrity, Strife, Hatebreed and Blood for Blood, recorded for Victory Records, and were partly responsible for the contemporary metalcore scene. Groups on Trustkill Records, such as Walls of Jericho, Racetraitor and Shai Hulud, were also part of this current. There were some bands, such as Mouthpiece, who were still keeping the original sound of youth crew.

As a reaction against the dominance of metal-influenced hardcore amongst straight edge bands, around 1996, a revival of the sound of the youth crew bands began. Bands including In My Eyes, Bane, Ten Yard Fight and Floorpunch, used the key aspects of late 1980s bands such as the gang vocals, high tempos and lyrical themes of straight edge, unity and vegetarianism. Additionally, at this time, Youth of Today&#x27;s Ray Cappo formed Better Than a Thousand with Ken Olden and Graham Land of early 1990s straight edge band Battery, creating a sound, too, harkening back to this era.

By 1999 and 2000, the youth crew revival was in decline, with Ten Yard Fight, In My Eyes and Floorpunch all disbanding. As a reaction against the homogeneity and simplicity that scene had developed, Ten Yard Fight guitarist Tim Cossar and the band&#x27;s roadie Wesley Eisold formed American Nightmare. Although still musically rooted in the youth crew revival, the band&#x27;s negative, poetic lyrics of self-loathing were inspired by groups like the Smiths. American Nightmare&#x27;s influence was apparent promptly in their home of Boston, then expanded nationally with the release of their 2001 debut album &quot;Background Music&quot;, being followed by a wave bands including Ceremony, Ruiner, Modern Life Is War, the Hope Conspiracy and Killing the Dream. A reaction against this movement also took place, which began with Mental, who were quickly followed by Have Heart. Have Heart&#x27;s success led to the rise in popularity of other positive hardcore groups like Champion, Verse and Sinking Ships, and the rise in prominence of Bridge 9 Records.

== Fashion ==
The youth crew fashion, different from the stereotypical skinhead fashion worn by many New York City-area hardcore music fans circa 1988, is preserved in record-liner photos, videos, and zine photos from that era. The look was more conventional than the usual punk fashion. In an interview in 2004&#x27;s &quot;All Ages: Reflections on Straight Edge&quot;, Cappo described the youth crew look as &quot;Tony Hawk meets Beaver Cleaver&quot;.

Youth crew fashion included bleached hair, crewcuts and similar haircuts, athletic wear, letterman jackets, sportswear, army pants or shorts, oversized T-shirts bearing band logos or straight edge slogans, hooded sweatshirts and hightop basketball shoes. 7 Seconds and their fans often drew black lines under their eyes in a similar manner to athletes. Hardliners and more militant straight-edgers sometimes wore camouflage and military surplus gear. The Swatch X-Rated became popular in youth crew fashion. Sports brands, such as Adidas, Nike or Champion, were popular in youth crew fashion.

The year 1988 is often considered the peak of youth crew straight edge New York hardcore, so the abbreviation &quot;&#x27;88&quot; sometimes appears in songs, T-shirts, album cover art or other media. The year is also commonly remembered as a violent and dangerous one in the New York hardcore scene, when many clubs closed or banned hardcore concerts.

<text>Youth of Today is an American hardcore punk band, initially active from 1985 to 1990 before reforming in 2010. The band played a major role in establishing the &quot;Youth Crew&quot; subculture of hardcore, both espousing and evolving the philosophies of the straight edge and vegetarian lifestyles.

After the band&#x27;s dissolution, vocalist Ray Cappo became involved in the Hare Krishna movement and formed the bands Shelter and Better Than a Thousand. Youth of Today is currently composed of Cappo and guitarist John Porcelly, both founding members, as well as bassist Walter Schreifels and drummer Sammy Siegler.

==History==
Youth of Today was formed in Danbury, Connecticut, in 1985 by two members of the hardcore band Violent Children, Ray Cappo (vocals) and John Porcelly (Porcell) (guitar) were aiming to start a straight edge band at a time when most old school straight edge bands had disbanded. Having difficulty finding a bassist and drummer, Ray and Porcell found help from two high school friends, Graham Phillips and Darren Pesce, who had played with Porcell in a band called The Young Republicans in the past. Youth of Today played their first show at The Anthrax on July 2, 1985.

===&quot;Can&#x27;t Close My Eyes&quot;===
In 1985, Youth of Today recorded their debut EP &quot;Can&#x27;t Close My Eyes&quot; for Kevin Seconds&#x27; (singer of the popular hardcore band 7 Seconds) label Positive Force Records with additional lyrics by John L Hancock III (a.k.a. Ratboy). At the same time the band contributed five songs to the Connecticut Fun compilation album; these tracks would later be combined with the aforementioned release to make the album version of &quot;Can&#x27;t Close My Eyes&quot; that is commonly recognized today.

After touring for a while both Graham and Darren left the band, and two members of New York band Straight Ahead joined Ray and John, Craig Setari (bass) and Tommy Carroll (drums). Tommy left during their second tour, and Drew Thomas, drummer of brother band Crippled Youth (who later changed their name to Bold), was asked to finish the rest of the tour.

===&quot;Break Down the Walls&quot;===
A short while later, Underdog vocalist Richie Birkenhead joined the band on second guitar. With this line-up, the first Youth of Today album was recorded, entitled &quot;Break Down the Walls&quot;, and released by Wishingwell Records, the label of California straight edge bands Unity and Uniform Choice. Soon after recording the album Drew was replaced by Mike &quot;Judge&quot; (later to be the singer, along with John Porcelly on guitar, in the band Judge).
Craig left to reform Straight Ahead (and later played in Agnostic Front and Sick of It All), and Walter Schreifels of Gorilla Biscuits joined on as the new bassist. At the end of the &quot;Break Down the Walls&quot; tour that followed the release of the LP, second guitarist Richie left the band to concentrate on singing in Underdog, and with that line-up Youth of Today appeared with two songs on the Revelation Records compilation &quot;New York Hardcore - The Way It Is&quot;, alongside New York bands like Bold, Gorilla Biscuits, Side By Side and Sick of It All.

===&quot;We&#x27;re Not in This Alone&quot;===
At the end of 1987, Mike left the band, and Sammy Siegler became the new drummer. In 1988, Youth of Today recorded their classic second LP &quot;We&#x27;re Not in This Alone&quot;, which was released in America by Caroline Records and in Europe by both We Bite Records and Funhouse Records. The beginning of the next year, Youth of Today, whose line-up was steady at last, did a European tour- playing shows in: Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Yugoslavia, Italy, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and England. In 1990, Youth of Today decided to quit and recorded 4 songs for a farewell 7-inch on Revelation Records. Three of those songs appeared on the single &quot;Disengage&quot;.

When Youth of Today split, it seemed the beginning of the end for the second straight edge wave, which had begun in 1985, and which was at its height in 1988–1990. Together with bands like Uniform Choice, Gorilla Biscuits, No For An Answer, and Chain of Strength, Youth of Today were an inspiration for hundreds of bands all over the world, who combined the message of positive thinking and straight edge with energetic and fast hardcore, as well as an inspiration for hundreds of thousands of kids to live and lead a positive drug-free life.

===Post-breakup===
Ray Cappo of Youth of Today started the Hare Krishna band Shelter, and was later joined by Porcell. Walter was playing guitar in Gorilla Biscuits from 1986 until their end, and was joined on the European tour of Gorilla Biscuits in 1990 by Porcell and Sammy on guitar and drums. After the split of Gorilla Biscuits, Walter started Quicksand, and later on, Rival Schools and Walking Concert. Sammy later played drums in CIV (which featured members of Gorilla Biscuits) and multiple other bands.

=== Reunion ===
Aside from several one-off reunion shows, Youth of Today did a European reunion tour in 2003 with original members Ray, Porcell and Sammy. Ray&#x27;s friend Ken Olden from Battery and Better Than a Thousand filled in on bass. In fall 2010, they again started for a small reunion tour through Europe starting on September 16 in Lyss, Switzerland. A first-ever South American tour was scheduled for the first week of December 2010, taking Youth of Today to countries like Peru, Chile, Argentina and Brazil. They played two shows in Russia and two in Oslo, Norway, during the third week in March 2011. Youth of Today played the U Street Music Hall in Washington, D.C., on June 3, 2011; opening bands were Mouthpiece and Give. They played a show at the Glasshouse in Pomona, California, and another show at the Chaos in Tejas festival in June 2011. They played at the Getaway Rock Festival in Gävle, Sweden, on July 7–9, 2011. Youth of Today played at New Direction Fest No. 2 in Olbia, Sardinia, on July 10, 2011. They also played This Is Hardcore on August 12; the show sold out. The group played Riot Fest in Chicago opening for Danzig and Doyle playing Misfits songs on October 7, 2011. The band played at the Within These Walls fest in Mesa, Arizona, on September 21, 2012. On April 28, 2016, Youth of Today played in Berlin, Germany, and the next day in Meerhout, Belgium. The show included Sammy Siegler on drums and Walter Schreifels on bass.

<text>Moorends is a village in the north-east of the City of Doncaster, South Yorkshire, England, situated on the border with East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. It was historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire until 1974. It is part of the civil parish of Thorne, which lies to the south.

Moorends is located on the edge of Thorne Moors, part of the Humberhead Levels, at an elevation of around above sea level. The moors can be accessed via Grange Road. The village grew up with housing being built to house the miners working in Thorne Colliery, which was developed in the village. Before the coal mine was sunk, the area was largely farmland with only a handful of houses. A missionary church was provided by the owners of the coal mine during the colliery&#x27;s development (, however, a permanent church, St Wilfrith&#x27;s, was built in 1934, and this became its own parish in 1956.

The legendary goalkeeper Ted Sagar was born in Moorends in 1910. It is also home to one public house.

<text>David Vincent Olliffe (born 3 November 1975) is an Australian musician, and the former drummer of The Vines. During the recordings of the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Highly Evolved&quot;, Olliffe left citing creative differences with band management and the album&#x27;s producer although it was reported on the band&#x27;s website that &quot;he didn&#x27;t enjoy the touring lifestyle.&quot;

Before leaving, Olliffe had already recorded drum tracks for the songs &quot;Highly Evolved&quot;, &quot;Autumn Shade&quot;, &quot;Outtathaway&quot;, &quot;Sunshinin&quot;, &quot;Homesick&quot; (outro only), &quot;Country Yard&quot;, &quot;Mary Jane&quot;, and &quot;1969&quot; (which he also co-wrote).

Olliffe was also the drummer for Sydney&#x27;s Theredsunband, however he is credited as &quot;David O&#x27;Leaf&quot; in the official site bio. He played with the Sydney outfit after Theredsunband&#x27;s first drummer Kate Wilson (formerly of The Null Set and current drummer in The Laurels) left the band. Theredsunband&#x27;s current line up does not include O&#x27;Leaf/Olliffe, who left shortly before the band recorded their first album &quot;Peapod&quot;.

In 2017 Olliffe has officially released his debut album under the name the Molotov Garage. It is available to listen to on YouTube. &quot;See The Silver Sky Run&quot; was written and recorded from within his time in the Vines up until over ten years since his departure from the band, and was co-produced with Simon Holmes, formerly of Sydney band the Hummingbirds, and Jeremy Smith who played in one of the later configurations of another Sydney band Glide.

<doc id="685289" wikidata="Q6453319" url="?curid=685289" title="Romanization of Russian">
<text>The romanization of the Russian language (the transliteration of Russian text from the Cyrillic script into the Latin script), aside from its primary use for including Russian names and words in text written in a Latin alphabet, is also essential for computer users to input Russian text who either do not have a keyboard or word processor set up for inputting Cyrillic, or else are not capable of typing rapidly using a native Russian keyboard layout (JCUKEN). In the latter case, they would type using a system of transliteration fitted for their keyboard layout, such as for English QWERTY keyboards, and then use an automated tool to convert the text into Cyrillic.
==Systematic transliterations of Cyrillic to Latin==
There are a number of distinct and competing standards for the romanization of Russian Cyrillic, with none of them having received much popularity, and, in reality, transliteration is often carried out without any consistent standards.

===Scientific transliteration===
Scientific transliteration, also known as the &quot;International Scholarly System&quot;, is a system that has been used in linguistics since the 19th century. It is based on the Czech alphabet and formed the basis of the GOST and ISO systems.

===GOST===

====OST 8483====
OST 8483 was the first Soviet standard on romanization of Russian, introduced on 16 October 1935.

====GOST 16876-71 (1973)====
Developed by the National Administration for Geodesy and Cartography at the USSR Council of Ministers, GOST 16876-71 has been in service since 1973. Replaced by GOST 7.79-2000.

====ST SEV 1362 (1978)====
This standard is an equivalent of GOST 16876-71 and was adopted as an official standard of the COMECON.

====GOST 7.79-2000 (2002)====

GOST 7.79-2000 &quot;System of Standards on Information, Librarianship, and Publishing–Rules for Transliteration of the Cyrillic Characters Using the Latin Alphabet&quot; is an adoption of ISO 9:1995. It is the official standard of both Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).

====GOST 52535.1-2006 (2006)====
GOST 52535.1-2006 &quot;Identification cards. Machine readable travel documents. Part 1. Machine readable passports&quot; is an adoption of an ICAO standard for travel documents. It was used in Russian passports for a short period during 2010–2013 (see below). The standard was substituted in 2013 by GOST R ISO/IEC 7501-1-2013, which does not contain romanization, but directly refers to the ICAO romanization (see below).

====Street and road signs====
Names on street and road signs in the Soviet Union were romanized
according to GOST 10807-78 (tables 17, 18), which was amended by newer Russian GOST R 52290-2004 (tables Г.4, Г.5), the romanizations in both the standards are practically identical.

===ISO===
====ISO/R 9====
ISO/R 9, established in 1954 and updated in 1968, was the adoption of the scientific transliteration by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). It covers Russian and seven other Slavic languages.

====ISO 9====
ISO 9:1995 is the current transliteration standard from ISO. It is based on its predecessor ISO/R 9:1968, which it deprecates; for Russian, the two are the same except in the treatment of five modern letters. ISO 9:1995 is the first language-independent, univocal system of one character for one character equivalents (by the use of diacritics) that faithfully represents the original and allows for reverse transliteration for Cyrillic text in any contemporary language.

===United Nations romanization system===
The UNGEGN, a Working Group of the United Nations, in 1987 recommended a romanization system for geographical names, which was based on the 1983 version of GOST 16876-71. It may be found in some international cartographic products.

===Library of Congress (ALA-LC)===
American Library Association and Library of Congress (ALA-LC) romanization tables for Slavic alphabets are used in North American libraries and in the British Library since 1975.

The formal, unambiguous version of the system for bibliographic cataloguing requires some diacritics, two-letter tie characters, and prime marks. The standard is also often adapted as a &quot;simplified&quot; or &quot;modified Library of Congress system&quot; for use in text for a non-specialized audience, omitting the special characters and diacritics, simplifying endings, and modifying iotated initials.

===British Standard===
&quot;British Standard 2979:1958&quot; is the main system of the Oxford University Press, and a variation was used by the British Library to catalogue publications acquired up to 1975. The Library of Congress system (ALA-LC) is used for newer acquisitions.

===BGN/PCGN===
The BGN/PCGN system is relatively intuitive for Anglophones to read and pronounce. In many publications, a simplified form of the system is used to render English versions of Russian names, typically converting &quot;ë&quot; to &quot;yo&quot;, simplifying &quot;-iy&quot; and &quot;-yy&quot; endings to &quot;-y&quot;, and omitting apostrophes for &quot;ъ&quot; and &quot;ь&quot;. It can be rendered using only the basic letters and punctuation found on English-language keyboards: no diacritics or unusual letters are required, although the interpunct character (·) may be used to avoid ambiguity.

This particular standard is part of the BGN/PCGN romanization system which was developed by the United States Board on Geographic Names and by the Permanent Committee on Geographical Names for British Official Use. The portion of the system pertaining to the Russian language was adopted by BGN in 1944 and by PCGN in 1947.

===Transliteration of names on Russian passports===
In Soviet international passports, transliteration was based on French rules but without diacritics and so all names were transliterated in a French-style system.

In 1997, with the introduction of new Russian passports, a diacritic-free English-oriented system was established by the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, but the system was also abandoned in 2010.

In 2006, GOST R 52535.1-2006 was adopted, which defines technical requirements and standards for Russian international passports and introduces its own system of transliteration. In 2010, the Federal Migration Service of Russia approved Order No. 26, stating that all personal names in the passports issued after 2010 must be transliterated using GOST R 52535.1-2006. Because of some differences between the new system and the old one, citizens who wanted to retain the old version of a name&#x27;s transliteration, especially one that had been in the old pre-2010 passport, could apply to the local migration office before they acquired a new passport. The standard was abandoned in 2013.
In 2013, Order No. 320 of the Federal Migration Service of Russia came into force. It states that all personal names in the passports must be transliterated by using the ICAO system, which is published in Doc 9303 &quot;Machine Readable Travel Documents, Part 3&quot;. The system differs from the GOST R 52535.1-2006 system in two things: ц is transliterated into &quot;ts&quot; (as in pre-2010 systems), ъ is transliterated into &quot;ie&quot; (a novelty).

==Transliteration table==
===Table notes===
==Latin script==

In a second sense, the romanization or Latinization of Russian may also indicate the introduction of a dedicated Latin alphabet for writing the Russian language. Such an alphabet would not necessarily bind closely to the traditional Cyrillic orthography. The transition from Cyrillic to Latin has been proposed several times throughout history (especially during the Soviet era), but was never conducted on a large scale, except for informal romanizations in the computer era.

The most serious possibility of adoption of a Latin alphabet for the Russian language was discussed in 1929–30 during the campaign of latinisation of the languages of the USSR, when a special commission was created to propose a latinisation system for Russian.

===Latin letter names in Russian===
The letters of the Latin script are named in Russian as following (and are borrowed from French and/or German):

<doc id="685298" wikidata="Q6517116" url="?curid=685298" title="Lefty Williams">
<text>Claude Preston &quot;Lefty&quot; Williams (March 9, 1893 – November 4, 1959) was an American pitcher in Major League Baseball. He is probably best known for his involvement in the 1919 World Series fix, known as the Black Sox Scandal.

==Career==
Williams was born in Aurora, Missouri, to William and Mary Williams. He began his major league career on September 17, 1913, with the Detroit Tigers.

Williams&#x27; breakthrough season came in 1915, while with the Salt Lake City Bees of the Pacific Coast League. That year, he pitched 418.2 innings, leading the league in wins (33) and strikeouts (294), while featuring mostly his mid-90s fastball and swooping curve. His contract was then purchased by the Chicago White Sox.

With the White Sox, Williams settled into the starting rotation and helped the team win the pennant in 1917, going 17–8. After spending 1918 working in Navy shipyards, he came back strong in 1919 with his greatest performance, going 23–11 with a 2.64 earned run average. The White Sox again won the American League pennant. However, before that year&#x27;s World Series, he was involved in the Black Sox Scandal when teammate Chick Gandil offered him $10,000 to lose his starts. Williams only received $5,000, half of what he was promised, a sum that was still almost double his 1919 salary of $2,600.

In the series, Williams went 0–3, with an earned run average of 6.63. His three losses were a World Series record. That was equaled in the 1981 Series when George Frazier lost three games. &quot;Eight Men Out&quot; author Eliot Asinof wrote that Williams eventually turned against the fix as he prepared for his final Series start; Asinof later admitted that this particular anecdote was made up.

In 1920, Williams went 22–14, but was caught up in the indictments handed down that autumn. Though acquitted by a jury, Williams and the seven other &quot;Black Sox&quot; were banned from organized baseball by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis.

Afterwards, Williams barnstormed and played in outlaw leagues for a few years, and he played briefly for the Fort Bayard Veterans team in New Mexico which was part of the Copper League or Cactus League. He supposedly took to drinking heavily. It was reported that the between-inning &quot;nips&quot; made him an intimidating pitcher to the batters.

Williams is listed as a manager of the Anaheim/San Bernardino Valencias for part of the 1948 season of the Class-C Sunset League.

Williams spent his later years in Laguna Beach, California where he died in 1959, operating a garden nursery business.

Williams was portrayed by actor James Read in the 1988 film &quot;Eight Men Out&quot;.
