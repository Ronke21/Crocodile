<text>Andrew James Robert Patrick Martin (March 17, 1975 – March 13, 2009) was a Canadian professional wrestler and actor. He was best known for his time with the World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (WWF/WWE) under the ring name Test.

During his nine-year tenure with the WWF/WWE, he found his greatest success as a singles performer, winning the Intercontinental and European Championships once each, and the Hardcore Championship twice. Martin found additional success in the tag team division, twice becoming a World Tag Team Champion with Booker T by winning the WWF and WCW World Tag Team Championships once each.

==Early life==
Martin was born on March 17, 1975, in the Southern Ontario town of Whitby (Durham Region).

==Professional wrestling career==
===Training and early career (1997–1998)===
In the mid-1990s, Martin met professional wrestler Bret Hart in a restaurant. After Hart offered to train him to wrestle, Martin spent eight months training under both Hart and Leo Burke. Martin debuted in 1997, wrestling on the Canadian independent circuit under the ring names Martin Kane and T.J. Thunder. Martin continued his training with Dory Funk Jr. at Funk&#x27;s Funkin&#x27; Dojo, a training center in Ocala, Florida.

===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (1998–2004)===

====The Corporation (1998–1999)====

Martin debuted in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) on the October 25, 1998, episode of &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot; as an unnamed bodyguard for the band Mötley Crüe, who were performing on the show. In a scripted event, Martin threw an overzealous fan off the stage during the band&#x27;s rehearsal. On the December 14 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, Martin aligned himself with WWF Champion The Rock by attacking The Rock&#x27;s rival Triple H. A week later on the December 21 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, Martin made his in ring debut teaming with The Rock to defeat Triple H and X-Pac by disqualification. Martin went on to join The Corporation, a wrestling stable consisting of numerous other wrestlers. During this time, he received the ring name &quot;Test&quot;, since he usually checked the mic saying &quot;test...test...&quot;

On the January 11, 1999, episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, Test competed in a Corporation vs. D-X Corporate Rumble, which was won by Chyna, making her the 30th entrant in the upcoming Royal Rumble match. At the Royal Rumble on January 24, Test competed in the Royal Rumble match but was eliminated by Steve Austin. On the March 8 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, Test defeated X-Pac. At WrestleMania XV on March 28, Test teamed with D&#x27;Lo Brown in a WWF Tag Team Championship title match against Jeff Jarrett and Owen Hart where Jarrett and Hart retained their titles. Along with Triple H, he helped Shane McMahon retain the European Championship against X-Pac at WrestleMania XV. After being removed from the Corporation, Test joined The Union who were known to carry 2x4 boards of wood with them. The group briefly feuded with the Corporation and at Over the Edge on May 23, The Union defeated The Corporate Ministry in an Eight-man elimination tag team match, before quietly disbanding.

====Relationship with Stephanie McMahon and T &amp; A (1999–2000)====

Test then began an on-screen relationship with Stephanie McMahon that would lead to a &quot;Love her or Leave her&quot; match at SummerSlam on August 22. He went on to defeat Shane McMahon at SummerSlam, gaining Shane&#x27;s blessing, which led to an on-screen engagement between Stephanie and Test. Later in the storyline, The British Bulldog hit Stephanie with a trash can, which caused her to develop amnesia. Plans for the wedding continued however, and on the night of the wedding Test defeated Triple H with a quick 3-count from a referee in a Vince McMahon mask. Triple H later showed a video which revealed that he had drugged Stephanie and had taken her to Las Vegas, Nevada, where he married her in a drive-through ceremony. Stephanie then turned on Test and aligned herself with Triple H, ushering in the McMahon-Helmsley Era. Test then had a short feud with DX. On the December 6 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, Test and Kane were defeated by Triple H and X-Pac. DX would go on to break his nose and force him into matches like a handicap match against Big Boss Man and Albert. On the December 12 episode of &quot;Heat&quot;, Test faced Al Snow in a losing effort. The next night on &quot;Raw is War&quot;, Test teamed with Triple H to face the New Age Outlaws resulting in Triple H turning on and assaulting him. The next week on &quot;Raw is War&quot;, Triple H would continue to torment him by putting him in a handicap match against the New Age Outlaws, calling it a &quot;Christmas present&quot;. On the January 17, 2000 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, Test defeated Big Boss Man to win the WWF Hardcore Championship. At the Royal Rumble on January 23, Test competed in the Royal Rumble match where he was eliminated by Big Show. Test then lost the WWF Hardcore Championship to Crash Holly on the February 24 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. Test then turned heel and formed a tag team with Albert. The two were known as T &amp; A (Test and Albert) and were managed by Trish Stratus. At WrestleMania 2000 on April 2, T &amp; A defeated Al Snow and Steve Blackman. Then at Backlash on April 30, T &amp; A (with Trish Stratus) defeated the Dudley Boyz. At King of the Ring on June 25, T &amp; A were defeated in a Four corners elimination match for the WWF Tag Team Championship by Edge &amp; Christian. At Fully Loaded on July 23, T &amp; A and Trish Stratus lost to the Hardy Boyz and Lita in a Six-person mixed tag team match. At Unforgiven on September 24, Test competed in a Hardcore Open Invitational for the WWF Hardcore Championship which was won by Steve Blackman. At No Mercy on October 22, T &amp; A and Trish Stratus competed against the Acolytes Protection Agency (Bradshaw and Faarooq) and Lita, which ended in a no contest because of T &amp; A attacking The APA before the match. At Survivor Series on November 19, T &amp; A and Trish Stratus faced Steve Blackman, Crash Holly and Molly Holly in a losing effort.

====The Invasion and various feuds (2000–2002)====

On the December 28 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Albert attacked Test at the orders of Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley, effectively disbanding T &amp; A and turning Test face again.

Again a singles wrestler, Test eliminated William Regal at the Royal Rumble on January 21, 2001 during the Royal Rumble match and subsequently defeated him the next night on &quot;Raw is War&quot; to win the WWF European Championship. Test then feuded with Eddie Guerrero, losing the European Championship to Guerrero at WrestleMania X-Seven on April 1 following interference from Dean Malenko and Perry Saturn. On the April 30 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, Test defeated Triple H by disqualification after Triple H hit him with a chair and powerbombed him through the announce table. At Judgment Day on May 20, Test competed in a Triple threat hardcore match for the WWF Hardcore Championship which was won by Rhyno. On the June 14 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Test defeated Rhyno to win the Hardcore Championship but he would lose the title back to Rhyno on the June 25 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;.

During the Invasion storyline, the APA (Bradshaw and Faarooq) were suspicious of Test&#x27;s friendship with WCW owner Shane McMahon, prior to Shane&#x27;s heel turn and the formation of the ECW half of The Alliance. They decided to attack Test because they thought he was the mole within the WWF, only to find out he wasn&#x27;t. In retaliation, on the August 9 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Test joined The Alliance by helping Alliance members Diamond Dallas Page and Chris Kanyon defeat the APA for the WWF Tag Team Championship, turning heel once again. Test teamed with The Dudley Boyz to defeat the APA and Spike Dudley in a six-man tag team match at SummerSlam on August 19 when Test pinned Bradshaw. The next day on &quot;Raw is War&quot;, ECW owner Stephanie McMahon approached Test with the task of beating Chris Jericho after Rhyno failed to do so at SummerSlam. Despite past conflicts, they shook hands, thus finally resolving the grudge between himself and Stephanie. Test went on to defeat Jericho. He then began teaming with Booker T regularly in September. Together Test and Booker T defeated The Brothers of Destruction (The Undertaker and Kane) on the September 27 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; to win the WCW Tag Team Championship. However they would go on to lose the titles to The Hardy Boyz on the October 8 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. At No Mercy on October 21, Test defeated Kane. On the November 1 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Test and Booker T defeated The Rock and Chris Jericho to win the WWF Tag Team Championship.

Test defeated Edge to win the WWF Intercontinental Championship on the November 5 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. On the November 12 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Test and Booker T lost the WWF Tag Team Championship to the Hardy Boyz. Test lost the WWF Intercontinental Championship back to Edge in a unification match at Survivor Series on November 18 for the WCW United States Championship and the WWF Intercontinental Championship. On the same night, he won a battle royal which granted him on-screen immunity from being fired for a year after attacking and taking the place of Scotty 2 Hotty. For the next few weeks, a storyline was built around Test using that immunity to justify attacking fellow wrestlers but the storyline went nowhere and shortly after the year turned it was dropped. At Vengeance on December 9, Test and Christian were defeated by Scotty 2 Hotty and Albert. At the Royal Rumble on January 20, 2002, Test competed in the Royal Rumble match, but was eliminated by Stone Cold Steve Austin. At No Way Out on February 17, Test and Booker T faced Tazz and Spike Dudley for the WWF Tag Team Championship but failed to win the titles.

At the 2002 WWF draft lottery, Test was drafted to the SmackDown! brand. On the May 2 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Test and Christian defeated Mark Henry and Faarooq. On the May 9 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Test defeated Mark Henry. On the May 23 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Test defeated Randy Orton. On the May 30 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Test defeated Triple H. On the June 13 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Test defeated The Hurricane in a King of the Ring qualifier. The next week, Test defeated Hardcore Holly in a Quarterfinals match but would go on to lose in the semi-finals of the King of the Ring tournament to the eventual winner, Brock Lesnar. On the July 4 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Test, Christian and Lance Storm formed The Un-Americans. On the July 25 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, John Cena poked fun at him so he slapped him which led to a match where Cena won. On the July 29 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, The Un-Americans left SmackDown! and joined the Raw brand. Later that night they attacked The Undertaker.

The storyline culminated in a match at SummerSlam on August 25 where The Undertaker defeated Test. The Un-Americans lost to the team of Kane, Goldust, Booker T and Bubba Ray Dudley at Unforgiven on September 22 and after a series of losses The Un-Americans divided, and the stable split in brawling fashion and disbanded on the September 30 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;.

====Relationship with Stacy Keibler and departure (2002–2004)====

In October, after the Un-Americans dissolved, Test received Stacy Keibler as his on-screen girlfriend and &quot;image consultant&quot;. This began by Keibler telling Test he should embrace his fanbase and call them his &quot;Testicles&quot;, in line with The Rock&#x27;s fan group, the &quot;People&quot;, Kane&#x27;s &quot;Kaneanites&quot;, Chris Jericho&#x27;s &quot;Jerichoholics&quot; and Hulk Hogan&#x27;s &quot;Hulkamaniacs&quot;. This eventually culminated with Test cutting off his long hair and trading his trademark leather pants for normal wrestling trunks. The couple were originally heels, but due to the popularity of the gimmick, quickly became faces. At the Royal Rumble on January 19, 2003, Test competed in the Royal Rumble match, but was eliminated by Batista. In May, Test formed a tag team with the returning Scott Steiner, at the request of Keibler, and at Judgment Day on May 18, they faced La Résistance in a losing effort. Later in the night, he went on to compete in a battle royal for the vacant WWE Intercontinental Championship, but it was eventually won by Christian. Test and Keibler eventually split up due to the ongoing mistreatment of Keibler at the hands of Test, while turning him heel again and developed a misogynist streak. At Bad Blood on June 15, Steiner defeated Test for Keibler&#x27;s managerial services. On the August 18 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Test defeated Steiner, winning the services of Keibler and announcing his intentions to &quot;make her a whore&quot;. At Unforgiven on September 21, Test again defeated Steiner, forcing him to become his manservant. Steiner then attacked Keibler, blaming her for the loss and for him having to take orders from another man. Test then freed Steiner from his obligation, and the pair became a tag team once again, as now both treated Keibler like a slave. The two challenged for the World Tag Team Championship on multiple occasions but came up short each time. The pair were then fired by Mick Foley (therefore freeing Keibler from their control), who was the on-screen Co-General Manager for two nights, thus finally ending the year-long angle. They were then re-hired by Eric Bischoff, upon his return to the position of Raw General Manager. At Armageddon on December 14, Test and Scott Steiner competed in a Tag Team Turmoil match for the World Tag Team Championship but failed to win the titles.

Test then had a short feud with Steven Richards in January 2004, which started after Test kicked Victoria (Richard&#x27;s on-screen girlfriend) in the jaw. They fought several times on &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot;, with Richards winning every match. On the January 19 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Test competed in a Triple Threat Royal Rumble Qualifying Match against Goldberg and Steiner. After Goldberg won the match Test and Steiner would officially disband. At the Royal Rumble on January 25, Test was found knocked out backstage by some officials and the &quot;Raw&quot; Sheriff Stone Cold Steve Austin when it was his turn to enter. Austin ordered someone to quickly replace Test as the 21st rumble entrant. The person who attacked him and replaced him was revealed to be Mick Foley. Test would gain some revenge on the February 2 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, when he and Randy Orton attacked Foley in a backstage area. Test would start competing against the likes of Rico and Stevie Richards regularly on &quot;Heat&quot;. On the March 1 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Test and Matt Hardy were defeated by Rob Van Dam and Booker T. Test would go on to compete on house shows until he reaggravated the neck injury that had kept him out of action the past few months.

Martin had spinal fusion surgery performed by Dr. Lloyd Youngblood in July. On November 1, it was announced that he was released from his WWE contract along with A-Train and Billy Gunn.

===Independent circuit, Italy, and Australia (2005–2006)===
Test returned to the ring in May 2005, and began accepting bookings with various independent promotions. On August 27, 2005, Test wrestled at WrestleReunion 2 teaming with The Masked Superstar, Steve Corino, and The Original Evil Clown losing to D&#x27;Lo Brown, The Blue Meanie, Tom Prichard and Dusty Rhodes in Philadelphia. One of his most notable victories during this tenure was against former TNA wrestler Samoa Joe for World Series Wrestling in Australia. His most prominent role in the independent circuit was in the Nu-Wrestling Evolution promotion in Italy, where he took on the ring name &quot;Big Foot&quot;, due to his &quot;big boot&quot; finishing move. He also feuded with Mark Jindrak in January 2006 in Italy.

===Return to WWE (2006–2007)===

On March 22, 2006, WWE.com announced that Test had verbally agreed to return to WWE. Subsequently, vignettes began to play during &quot;ECW on Sci Fi&quot;, announcing that Test was debuting on the ECW brand. He officially made his return on the July 4 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, defeating Al Snow. In late-July, Test aligned with the fellow ECW newcomers, Mike Knox, Big Show, and Matt Striker to feud with the &quot;ECW Originals&quot;, which consisted of Rob Van Dam, Sabu, and The Sandman. On the August 1 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, Test and Mike Knox defeated Sandman and Tommy Dreamer in an Extreme Rules match, with Test pinning Dreamer. On the September 5 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, Test and Mike Knox lost to Rob Van Dam and Sabu in an Extreme Rules Match. On the October 3 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, Test defeated Rob Van Dam in an Extreme Rules Match.
On the November 7 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, Test defeated Tommy Dreamer to earn a spot in the Extreme Elimination Chamber at December to Dismember on December 3. Test was a member of Team Big Show (Big Show, himself, Montel Vontavious Porter, Finlay and Umaga) facing Team Cena (John Cena, Kane, Bobby Lashley, Sabu and Rob Van Dam) at Survivor Series on November 26. During the match, Test eliminated Rob Van Dam but was eventually eliminated by Sabu. Team Big Show eventually lost. At December to Dismember, he eliminated Hardcore Holly and Rob Van Dam in the Extreme Elimination Chamber match for the ECW World Championship, before being pinned by the eventual winner Bobby Lashley. On the January 16, 2007, episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, Test competed in a triple threat match for the ECW World Championship, which was won by Bobby Lashley. The following week, Test faced Lashley for the ECW World Championship but failed to win the title. He would fail to defeat Lashley for the title on two further occasions, at the Royal Rumble on January 28 and on the January 30 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;.

Following these defeats, Test would disappear from WWE television. On February 18, WWE commentator Jim Ross, confirmed on his blog that Test had been suspended for 30 days for violating the WWE &quot;Wellness Program&quot;. A week after Ross made the announcement, it was reported that Test was officially released from his WWE contract. Martin released a statement through his MySpace saying that the release was mutual and he had requested it.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2007)===
After his departure, Martin debuted in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) as a face under his real name on the August 2, 2007, episode of &quot;TNA Impact!&quot;. He allied himself with Abyss and Sting and helped them defeat A.J. Styles and Christian Cage in a tag team ladder match. At Hard Justice on August 12, Martin wrestled his first and only match for TNA as &quot;The Punisher&quot; Andrew Martin, as he teamed with Sting and Abyss to defeat Christian&#x27;s Coalition (Cage, Tomko, and A.J. Styles) in a Doomsday Chamber of Blood match, after Styles was slammed into a pile of broken glass and pinned by Abyss.

===Late career (2007–2009)===
On December 19, 2007, Martin announced that he would embark on a final tour of Britain, Ireland and France in February and March 2008 before retiring from professional wrestling. Martin finished his retirement tour in France, losing to Rene Dupree in a series of matches. However, Martin did wrestle two more matches in Japan in 2009. Martin defeated Lance Hoyt on February 1 and Mitsuya Nagai on February 3.

==Personal life==
Martin dated WWE Diva Stacy Keibler from 2001 until 2005. He also dated Barbara Blank, better known in WWE as Kelly Kelly, from 2007 until just before his death in March 2009.

On September 14, 2007, and April 5, 2008, Martin was arrested for driving under the influence in Hillsborough County and Pasco County, Florida. He was booked into jail both times, but was released the following day after posting bail.

==Death==
Martin was found dead in his Tampa, Florida apartment on March 13, 2009, four days prior to what would have been his 34th birthday. Police were contacted after a neighbor reportedly realized Martin had been lying motionless on his couch for some time, prompting them to call 911. Authorities retrieved Martin&#x27;s body after scaling his balcony and confirming his death. Toxicology reports revealed that Martin&#x27;s death was caused by an accidental overdose of oxycodone. It was reported that in August 2008, Martin entered a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center in West Palm Beach, Florida after reaching out to WWE, his former employer, for help regarding his substance abuse. Martin&#x27;s body was cremated and his remains were flown to his family in his hometown of Whitby, Ontario.

Forensic pathologist Bennet Omalu later determined that Martin had severe chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a brain condition caused by repeated concussions and subconcussive head injuries. Fellow Canadian wrestler and one of Martin&#x27;s idols, Chris Benoit, also suffered from CTE before his death in June 2007, and it was determined to be a factor in the Chris Benoit double-murder and suicide.

<doc id="690219" wikidata="Q692991" url="?curid=690219" title="Shane Douglas">
<text>Troy Allan Martin (born November 21, 1964) is an American professional wrestler, manager, and promoter, better known by his ring name Shane Douglas. He is best known for his tenures in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), World Championship Wrestling (WCW), the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), Xtreme Pro Wrestling (XPW), and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA).

Martin held a dozen championships between ECW, WCW, and the WWF and is a six-time world champion: a four-time ECW World Heavyweight Champion, a one-time XPW World Heavyweight Champion, and a one-time NWA World Heavyweight Champion. As ECW Champion, he holds the records for most combined days as champion (874) and the longest single reign (406 days). Martin is also a two-time ECW World Television Champion, a one-time WWF Intercontinental Champion, a one-time WCW United States Heavyweight Champion and a two-time WCW World Tag Team Champion. Martin was also the first to hold a championship in all three major U.S. promotions of the 1990s, after he was awarded the WWF Intercontinental Championship in 1995.

Martin achieved the greatest success of his career in ECW, where he debuted in 1993 and captured the ECW Heavyweight Championship twice in his first year with the company. He gained attention when he won a tournament for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, where he publicly rejected the NWA title belt and helped ECW in evolving from an NWA territory to a national promotion. Within ECW, he was dubbed &quot;The Franchise&quot; in reference to his status as the franchise player of the promotion. WWE, who purchased that organization, asserted: &quot;Without Shane Douglas, there would have been no ECW.&quot; He headlined many events for ECW including three editions of the company&#x27;s premier pay-per-view event November to Remember in 1996, 1997 and 1998.

==Early life==
Martin was born in New Brighton, Pennsylvania, one of six children of a veteran of World War II, who died in 1991. He graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; from Bethany College in 1986 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history and political science. He is an alumnus of the Psi chapter of Beta Theta Pi. After earning his degrees, he was offered to join the Saba University School of Medicine but declined in order to continue wrestling.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early years (1980–1989)===
Martin was trained by Dominic DeNucci in the Pittsburgh suburb of Freedom, Pennsylvania, alongside Mick Foley in the mid-1980s. He had been wrestling professionally to earn money since 1982. When he started, he used the character of Troy Orndorff, the fictional nephew of Paul Orndorff. In 1986, he wrestled Randy Savage at a &quot;WWF Superstars of Wrestling&quot; taping using his real name. He also wrestled &quot;Mr. Wonderful&quot; Paul Orndorff in the debut episode of &quot;WWF Wrestling Challenge&quot;, once again using his real name. Later that year, he began wrestling as a fan favorite for the Universal Wrestling Federation (UWF) using the name Shane Douglas, which was given to him by &quot;Hot Stuff&quot; Eddie Gilbert and Missy Hyatt (the &quot;Douglas&quot; last name was inspired by actor Michael Douglas). Douglas defeated Gilbert for the UWF Television Championship on August 3, 1987, but did not rise above mid-card status. Douglas lost the title on September 2 to Terry Taylor.

=== World Championship Wrestling (1988–1990)===
In 1988, Douglas signed with the promotion World Championship Wrestling (WCW), then a member of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). He retained his Shane Douglas ring name and was put into a tag team of skateboarders known as The Dynamic Dudes with Johnny Ace (John Laurinaitis, the younger brother of Road Warrior Animal).

Mick Foley has opined that since neither Ace nor Douglas knew how to skateboard, the fans saw through the character and refused to buy into it. Jim Cornette, who was managing The Midnight Express (Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane) at the time, decided to manage the duo to help them get over.

When Eaton and Lane in storyline did not approve, they forced a match between the two teams with Cornette remaining neutral at ringside. He ended up turning on Douglas and Ace and the teams feuded for a couple of months. Cornette&#x27;s turn was to have established The Dynamic Dudes as a top fan favorite tag team, but the turn backfired and made The Midnight Express more popular than they already were.

The Dynamic Dudes broke up in 1990 after Ace began competing progressively more for All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW), which was breaking its ties to the NWA. Jim Cornette also states that the end of the Dynamic Dudes came when Douglas went over his head to Jim Herd about having a finish changed to make him look stronger. Cornette, who was part of the booking committee, washed his hands of working with them afterwards. Shane argued that they had been repeatedly promised a big push and were instead being booked to lose all of their big matches, then getting criticized for not getting over as a top team. The Dudes would last wrestle together in March 1990, and Douglas soon left WCW after broken promises to give him a push, and wrestled on the American independent circuit.

===World Wrestling Federation (1990–1991)===
In 1990, Douglas signed a deal with the World Wrestling Federation and made his debut on the June 18 episode of Prime Time Wrestling, defeating Bob Bradley, in a match taped in Toronto, Ontario, on May 27. Douglas remained undefeated in his first month, defeating Bob Bradley, Paul Diamond, and Steve Lombardi in a series of matches. He then moved up to begin a house show series in late June against Haku and suffered his first loss on June 28 in Denver, Colorado. He remained without a win in subsequent rematches. He made his syndicated television debut on the August 26 episode of WWF Wrestling Challenge, teaming with jobber Mark Thomas in a loss to The Orient Express.

In August 1990, he received his first break when he was tapped as the temporary replacement to an injured Shawn Michaels in The Rockers tag-team. Douglas teamed with Jannetty six times in matches against The Orient Express. On August 27, he defeated Buddy Rose in a dark match at the SummerSlam &#x27;90 PPV. On the September 17 episode of Prime Time Wrestling, Douglas wrestled Haku to a draw, and he was largely undefeated against low level competition throughout the fall. At the Survivor Series &#x27;90 PPV Douglas defeated Buddy Rose in another dark match, and on January 3, 1991, at a house show in Scranton, Pennsylvania, he scored the biggest victory of his nascent WWF career when he upset Dino Bravo. Four days later on the January 7, 1991, episode of Prime Time Wrestling he would pin Haku, and was strongly positioned as a rising young star.

His most memorable WWF performance took place at the 1991 Royal Rumble, where he entered as the seventeenth entrant and lasted for 26 minutes and 23 seconds before being eliminated by Brian Knobbs. Shortly after, he left the company to take care of his ailing father.

Douglas would make intermittent appearances in 1991, subbing for various wrestlers on house shows. He returned on May 8 in Youngstown, Ohio, and lost to Ricky Steamboat. In June he returned for a pair of house shows and was defeated by Colonel Mustafa. He made his final televised appearance on the June 15th episode of Prime Time Wrestling, losing to Dino Bravo in a match taped at Madison Square Garden. Douglas closed out his first WWF run with two victories - a win on July 29 in a dark match at a WWF Superstars taping against Bob Bradley, and a victory over The Orient Express on August 2 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, when he teamed with Marty Jannetty.

===Return to WCW (1992–1993)===
Douglas returned to WCW on the September 12, 1992, episode of &quot;Saturday Night&quot; as a fan favorite, where he defeated Super Invader in his return match by using Magnum T. A.&#x27;s finishing move, belly to belly suplex, which was noted by Magnum, the following week on &quot;Saturday Night&quot;. On the October 17 episode of &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, Douglas had a match with Brian Pillman, which began a rivalry between the duo. He made his pay-per-view return at Halloween Havoc, where he teamed with Tom Zenk and Johnny Gunn to compete against Arn Anderson, Bobby Eaton and Michael Hayes in a winning effort.

While feuding with Pillman, Douglas formed a tag team with Ricky Steamboat to take on Pillman and Steve Austin in a tag team match on the October 24 episode of &quot;Worldwide&quot;. The following month, Steamboat and Douglas won the NWA and WCW World Tag Team Championships from Dustin Rhodes and Barry Windham on the November 18 &quot;Clash of the Champions XXI&quot;. Steamboat and Douglas made a successful title defense against Windham and Pillman at Starrcade.

Steamboat and Douglas began a lengthy rivalry with Pillman and his new tag team partner Steve Austin. Steamboat and Douglas successfully defended the tag titles against Austin and Pillman on the January 13, 1993 &quot;Clash of the Champions XXII&quot;, before dropping the titles to Austin and Pillman on the March 27, 1993, episode of &quot;Worldwide&quot;. Soon after losing the tag titles, Douglas began a rivalry with the World Television Champion Paul Orndorff, where he came up short against Orndorff in two respective matches in the &quot;Computer Contenders Challenge&quot; on the May 1 episode of &quot;Worldwide&quot; and the May 8 episode of &quot;Power Hour&quot;, before departing the company for Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW). Douglas had been scheduled to team with Steamboat in a steel cage match for a title shot at the NWA and WCW World Tag Team Championship at Slamboree, but was replaced by Tom Zenk in a mask.

===Eastern / Extreme Championship Wrestling (1993-1995)===
==== The Franchise (1993–1994) ====

Martin debuted in the upstart ECW during its formative years on the August 24, 1993, episode of &quot;Eastern Championship Wrestling&quot; and solidified his status as a villain by joining Hotstuff International. In his first match, Douglas defeated Don E. Allen and Herve Renesto in a handicap match. Douglas quickly rose to the top of the roster, winning the promotion&#x27;s Heavyweight Championship on the September 14 episode of &quot;Eastern Championship Wrestling&quot;, after champion Tito Santana forfeited the title. Douglas successfully defended the title against The Sandman at the UltraClash event. At NWA Bloodfest, Douglas retained the title against J.T. Smith before dropping the title to Sabu later that night.
On the December 14 episode of &quot;NWA Eastern Championship Wrestling&quot;, Douglas substituted for an injured Johnny Gunn to defend the Tag Team Championship alongside Gunn&#x27;s partner Tommy Dreamer against Kevin Sullivan and The Tazmaniac, during which Douglas turned on Dreamer by attacking him with a steel chain. The following week, Douglas defeated Dreamer via disqualification by hitting Dreamer with a steel chain and handing over the chain to Dreamer, which fooled the referee to believe that Dreamer had hit him with the chain. This strategy would be adopted by Eddie Guerrero a decade later. Douglas defeated Dreamer at Holiday Hell to end the feud.

Douglas developed a gimmick of a foul-mouthed, incredibly arrogant villain (an attitude that would define him permanently and give him success), and gave himself the nickname &quot;The Franchise&quot;. His best friend Sherri Martel became his valet. Douglas gained notoriety when he wrestled Terry Funk and Sabu to a one-hour draw in the company&#x27;s first-ever three-way dance for the ECW Heavyweight Championship at The Night the Line Was Crossed. Douglas dethroned Funk in an Ultimate Jeopardy steel cage match to win his second Heavyweight Championship at Ultimate Jeopardy. 
Since its founding, ECW had been a member of the NWA. Douglas was instrumental in the development of &quot;extreme wrestling&quot; when he defeated The Tazmaniac, Dean Malenko and 2 Cold Scorpio to win a tournament to become the NWA World Heavyweight Champion on August 27. In an angle which only he, Tod Gordon, and Paul Heyman knew about, Douglas threw down the NWA title belt and stated that he did not want to be champion of a &quot;dead promotion&quot;. Douglas raised the ECW Heavyweight Championship belt and declared it to be a world championship belt, renaming it the ECW World Heavyweight Championship. WWE recognizes this moment as the beginning of ECW Championship and Douglas as the first ECW Champion. According to the &quot;Forever Hardcore&quot; DVD, Douglas only decided to throw down the NWA belt after NWA president Dennis Coralluzzo buried Douglas on Mike Tenay&#x27;s radio show. On the August 30 edition of &quot;NWA Eastern Championship Wrestling&quot;, Gordon announced he was folding Eastern Championship Wrestling, and in its place forming Extreme Championship Wrestling, a new promotion independent of the NWA. Capitalizing on the controversy that surrounded his literally &quot;throwing down&quot; the NWA belt and the promo following it, Douglas was encouraged to express his true feelings in interviews by the ECW bookers. This helped raise ECW&#x27;s prominence in the eyes of wrestling fans and journalists and allowed it to become an alternative to WCW and the WWF and Douglas cemented a legacy in the history of ECW. Douglas closed 1994 with successful title defenses of the ECW World Heavyweight Championship against Ron Simmons.

==== Triple Threat (1995) ====

In early 1995, Douglas formed the Triple Threat faction, aligning himself with Chris Benoit and Dean Malenko. He started the year with successful title defenses of the World Heavyweight Championship against Tully Blanchard and Marty Jannetty. He then entered a feud with The Sandman during a match at Three Way Dance, where Sandman&#x27;s valet, Woman, seemed to have aligned herself with Douglas by helping him in retaining the title against Sandman by handing him Sandman&#x27;s Singapore cane to attack him and get the win. However, it turned out to be a ruse when she aided Sandman in defeating Douglas for the title at Hostile City Showdown. Douglas&#x27; lengthy reign ended at 385 days, which is the second longest reign in the title history.

After failing to regain the title, Douglas began a rivalry with Cactus Jack, as each man wanted to capture the title from Sandman and saw the other as competition. During this time, Douglas went on a tirade about the lawlessness of ECW and brought in Bill Alfonso as a troubleshooting referee to restore order. After teasing a departure for the WWF, Douglas finally left ECW for the WWF in July 1995, making his last appearance during a world title match between Sandman and Cactus Jack at Hardcore Heaven, during which he attacked both men and left.

===Return to WWF (1995-1996)===

In 1995, Douglas returned to the WWF with a college dean character under the ring name Dean Douglas, making his first appearance on the July 29 episode of &quot;Superstars&quot;. To establish himself, he filmed several vignettes with a chalkboard, lecturing wrestlers and fans. He would also be shown taking notes of his opponents at ringside during some matches, and frequently carried a paddle (dubbed the &quot;Board of Education&quot;) with him to the ring. He would usually present a &quot;Report Card&quot; in which he would degrade the performances of heroic wrestlers after their matches.

Douglas began a rivalry with Razor Ramon after grading him &quot;MF&quot; for miserable failure after Razor&#x27;s loss to Shawn Michaels at SummerSlam. Douglas made his in-ring return to WWF on the September 9 episode of &quot;Superstars&quot;, where he defeated 1-2-3 Kid by disqualification after Razor attacked Douglas. This resulted in a match between Douglas and Razor at In Your House 3, which Douglas won after interference by the Kid.

He was set to wrestle Shawn Michaels for the Intercontinental Championship at In Your House 4, but Michaels forfeited the title due to injuries incurred after being attacked and beaten by a Marine in Syracuse, New York. Douglas, however, immediately had to defend the title against rival Razor Ramon. Ramon would go on to defeat Douglas, ending his reign at only twenty minutes. Douglas was randomly paired with Razor, Owen Hart and Yokozuna against Shawn Michaels, Ahmed Johnson, British Bulldog and Sycho Sid in a Wildcard Survivor Series match at Survivor Series. Douglas was eliminated by Michaels after Razor attacked him. His team went on to lose the match.

Douglas failed to recapture the Intercontinental Championship from Razor Ramon on the December 4 episode of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;. His last televised match was on the December 9 episode of &quot;Superstars&quot;, where he defeated enhancement talent Tony Williams. His last appearance on WWF television was at In Your House 5, when he was booked to wrestle Ahmed Johnson. According to the storyline, his back was not in wrestling condition, so he introduced Buddy Landel as his substitute, who was subsequently defeated by Johnson in just forty-two seconds. His very last day working in WWF was at Madison Square Garden where he was diagnosed with a severe muscle spasm in his back that if agitated could have paralyzed him. Despite doctors telling Vince McMahon it was a legitimate injury, Vince became angry at the news and tried to intimidate Shane into denying it, and was explicitly told by Vince McMahon to leave the company on January 1, 1996. However, Vince made him go out that evening and deliver a promo, in which he announced his injury. Douglas has been very outspoken about how Vince paid him much less than what was agreed upon, and because of his treatment before he refuses to ever work for Vince again.

===Return to ECW (1996-1999)===
==== World Television Champion (1996) ====

After leaving the WWF, Douglas made his surprise return to ECW at the House Party event on January 5, 1996, where he briefly reprised his Dean Douglas character, correcting Buh Buh Ray Dudley&#x27;s grammar after a match, thus becoming a fan favorite. His televised return aired on the January 9 episode of &quot;Hardcore TV&quot;, where he confronted Stevie Richards and Blue Meanie, denounced his Dean gimmick and declared &quot;the Franchise is back!&quot;. During this time, he had a memorable feud with Cactus Jack as Cactus was getting ready to leave for WWF and cutting promos encouraging Tommy Dreamer to side with him, deriding ECW&#x27;s hardcore style and promoting clean wrestling. Douglas eventually pinned Jack in a match at CyberSlam after performing a drop toe-hold onto an opened steel chair after Jack&#x27;s partner Mikey Whipwreck betrayed Jack. Upon his return, Douglas also targeted the World Heavyweight Champion Raven and received several title shots but came up short due to heavy interference by members of Raven&#x27;s Flock.

After failing in his attempts to regain the World Heavyweight Championship, Douglas won the World Television Championship from 2 Cold Scorpio at A Matter of Respect and eventually turned into a villain by showing disrespect to the title. After the match, 2 Cold Scorpio attacked him. A month later, Douglas was scheduled to defend the title against Scorpio at Fight The Power, but Scorpio was injured, which resulted in Douglas retaining the title against El Puerto Ricano, Don E. Allen, Devon Storm and Mikey Whipwreck in quick succession before losing it to Pitbull #2 after Douglas insulted The Pitbulls&#x27; manager, Francine and gave her a belly to belly suplex. At Heat Wave, Douglas won his second World Television Championship by defeating champion Chris Jericho, 2 Cold Scorpio and Pitbull #2 in a four corners match, after Francine turned on them and aided Douglas in winning the match. With Francine by his side, Douglas continued to feud with Pitbull #2 and retained his title against the latter in subsequent rematches for the remainder of the year.

==== Triple Threat reformation and final storylines (1996–1999) ====

In the fall of 1996, Douglas reformed the Triple Threat with new members Chris Candido and Brian Lee. Douglas and Francine entered a feud with Tommy Dreamer and Beulah McGillicutty, which culminated in a series of matches between the two pairs throughout late 1996 and early 1997.

Triple Threat feuded with Douglas&#x27; enemies Tommy Dreamer and The Pitbulls throughout the first half of 1997, while Douglas continued his successful title defenses of the World Television Championship against Pitbull #2. Douglas retained his title against Pitbull #1, as well, in an &quot;I Quit&quot; match at Hostile City Showdown. During this time, a mysterious man began stalking Francine and displayed mannerisms of Rick Rude. After Douglas retained his title against Pitbull #2 at ECW&#x27;s first pay-per-view Barely Legal, Brian Lee revealed himself to be the mysterious stalker and delivered a Chokeslam to Douglas. As a result, Lee was removed from Triple Threat due to his betrayal and left ECW. Triple Threat gained Bam Bam Bigelow in Lee&#x27;s place, who joined the group as Douglas&#x27; partner in a tag team match against The Pitbulls at Chapter 2.

At Wrestlepalooza, Douglas retained his title against Chris Chetti. Later that night, Douglas interrupted Taz&#x27;s promo after a match between Taz and Sabu. Douglas defended his title against Taz, with the stipulation that Taz would not be able to compete in ECW for sixty days. Douglas lost the title in under three minutes after Taz made him submit to the &quot;Tazmission&quot;. Douglas&#x27; reign ended at 329 days. He then turned his attention on capturing the World Heavyweight Championship from Terry Funk and challenged him for the title at Heat Wave but lost by disqualification. Douglas received another shot on the August 14 episode of &quot;Hardcore TV&quot;, but lost. Shortly after, Sabu won the title but Douglas remained in the title picture. At Hardcore Heaven, Douglas defeated Sabu and Funk in a three-way dance to win the title for the third time. In September 1997, Douglas retained the title against Tommy Dreamer at Terry Funk&#x27;s WrestleFest and against Phil Lafon in a no disqualification match at As Good as It Gets.

Douglas lost his title to Bam Bam Bigelow on the October 24 episode of &quot;Hardcore TV&quot; after Rick Rude chose Bigelow as Douglas&#x27; challenger. As a result, Bigelow was kicked out of Triple Threat and replaced by Lance Storm. After failing in a rematch at Ultimate Jeopardy, Douglas regained the title by defeating Bigelow at the November to Remember pay-per-view, beginning his fourth reign as champion. Douglas was injured in the match and was sidelined for nearly two months, making his return to action on January 30, 1998. At Hostile City Showdown, Bigelow rejoined Triple Threat by turning on his partner Taz during a match against Triple Threat. Bigelow&#x27;s return lead to Lance Storm being kicked out of the group, which began a feud between Storm and the Triple Threat. At Living Dangerously, Douglas and Chris Candido faced Storm and his mystery partner, who was revealed to be Al Snow. Snow pinned Douglas following a &quot;Snow Plow&quot;. This earned Snow a title shot against Douglas for the world title at Wrestlepalooza, where Douglas retained the title.

Douglas suffered an injury which prevented him from competing for a couple of months but he continued to appear on television, during which Triple Threat began feuding with Taz, Rob Van Dam and Sabu. The two teams squared off in a match at November to Remember, where Triple Threat lost. After the match, Bigelow left ECW and Chris Candido abandoned Douglas, resulting in Triple Threat being disbanded.

Douglas continued his feud with Taz, which culminated in a match between the two at Guilty as Charged in 1999, where Douglas lost the ECW World Heavyweight Championship to Taz after Douglas was attacked by former teammate Chris Candido, allowing Taz to win with a &quot;Tazmission&quot;. Douglas&#x27; fourth ECW World Heavyweight Championship reign was the longest reign in the title&#x27;s history, lasting 406 days.
Douglas faced Taz in a rematch for the World Heavyweight Championship at House Party, where he lost. On February 12 at Crossing the Line &#x27;99, Douglas allied with his long-time nemesis Tommy Dreamer to feud with Impact Players after both men claimed to be the &quot;New Franchise&quot; but Douglas elected Dreamer as his successor, turning Douglas face for the first time in nearly 3 years. After the face turn, Douglas would perform in a heroic role for the first since he disrespected the ECW Television title in 1996 and continued to feud with the Impact Players. At Living Dangerously, Dreamer and Douglas defeated Impact Players. Douglas wrestled his last match in ECW on April 15, where he defeated Justin Credible after a &quot;Pittsburgh Plunge&quot;. On May 15, Douglas was scheduled to represent ECW on the interpromotional Break the Barrier event. However, after a disagreement with Paul Heyman, Douglas delivered a controversial shoot promo at the event which ended with him quitting ECW one day before its Hardcore Heaven pay-per-view.

===Second return to WCW (1999-2001)===
==== The Revolution and New Blood (1999–2000) ====

After quitting ECW, Douglas made a surprise return to WCW on the July 19, 1999, episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, where he joined with former Triple Threat members Chris Benoit and Dean Malenko and fellow ECW alumnus Perry Saturn to form The Revolution and pledged to cut the &quot;cancer&quot; out of WCW. This was a reference to Ric Flair, with whom Douglas had an off-screen grudge. Asya was later added to the group in place of Benoit, who left the team. The group wrestled other groups including West Texas Rednecks, First Family, Filthy Animals, and Varsity Club during its run. The group was rarely featured prominently and never really challenged the dominant wrestlers of WCW. This led to them never really getting popular as an idea, though both Benoit and Malenko were successful individually. The lack of success would eventually lead to the demise of the group after Malenko and Saturn left WCW. Following the disbanding of the Revolution, Douglas managed The Wall at the Souled Out pay-per-view in 2000, before taking a hiatus from television as the company did not have any plans for him at the time.

Douglas returned to WCW television on the April 10 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, where he aligned himself with Vince Russo and joined The New Blood group run by Russo and Eric Bischoff, which feuded with the older established The Millionaire&#x27;s Club, which included his on-screen and real life off-camera nemesis Ric Flair. Douglas faced Flair for the first time on that same night in a match, which Douglas lost by disqualification. At Spring Stampede, Douglas was paired with Buff Bagwell in a four-team tournament for the vacated World Tag Team Championship, where they defeated Harlem Heat 2000 in the semi-finals and the makeshift team of Ric Flair and Lex Luger in the finals, after Brian Adams and Bryan Clark delivered a &quot;High Times&quot;. Douglas resumed his feud with Flair, which culminated in a match between the two at Slamboree, which Douglas won, with the help of Flair&#x27;s son David Flair in disguise of a masked man. On the May 15 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Douglas defended the tag title alongside The Wall, who substituted for Buff Bagwell in a match against KroniK, which KroniK won.

Douglas received an opportunity for the World Heavyweight Championship against Jeff Jarrett on the May 31 episode of &quot;Thunder&quot;, where he failed to win the title after the WCW Commissioner Ernest Miller delivered a &quot;Feliner&quot; to Douglas. Douglas competed against The Wall in a Best of Five Tables match at The Great American Bash, which Douglas won by driving Wall through three tables.

==== Return of The Franchise and United States Champion (2000–2001) ====
At Bash at the Beach, Douglas defeated his former tag team partner Buff Bagwell, by debuting his new finishing move called &quot;Franchiser&quot; and with assistance by Torrie Wilson, who turned on Bagwell. With Wilson as his manager, Douglas began using his ECW nickname &quot;The Franchise&quot; and began using &quot;Cut the damn music!&quot; catchphrase during his entrance to the ring and then delivered a promo on the microphone. Douglas participated in a tournament for the vacated United States Heavyweight Championship on the July 18 episode of &quot;Monday Nitro&quot;, where he defeated Billy Kidman in the quarter-finals but lost to eventual winner Lance Storm in the semi-finals.

Douglas would begin a rivalry with Kidman, who had previously been aligned with Torrie Wilson. During this rivalry, Kidman notably displayed footage of a supposed sex tape between Douglas and Wilson, in which Douglas suffered erectile dysfunction. This led to a &quot;Viagra on a Pole&quot; match, which Douglas won. At the New Blood Rising pay-per-view, Kidman defeated Douglas in a Strap match. However, Douglas and Torrie Wilson defeated Kidman and Madusa in a scaffold match at Fall Brawl.

In the fall of 2000, Douglas became allied with the Natural Born Thrillers, during which he helped their leader Mike Sanders win a kickboxing match against Ernest Miller at Halloween Havoc, which lead to Douglas facing Miller in a match at Mayhem, which Miller won. Douglas would then enter a rivalry with Misfits in Action leader General Rection over Rection&#x27;s United States Heavyweight Championship. He faced Rection for the title at Starrcade, but lost by disqualification after Chavo Guerrero Jr. informed the referee that Douglas was trying to use a chain to hit Rection. In 2001, Douglas defeated Rection in a first blood chain match to capture the title at the Sin pay-per-view. Douglas dropped the belt to Rick Steiner on the February 5 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;. This was Douglas&#x27; last WCW match in the company and he sat out the rest of his WCW contract until it was purchased by the WWF on March 23, 2001. After WCW closed down, Douglas refused to return to the WWF because of paternity leave due to his wife&#x27;s pregnancy.

===Xtreme Pro Wrestling (2002–2003)===
After the WWF purchased both WCW and ECW in 2001, Douglas Went to Xtreme Pro Wrestling in July 2002, where he won its World Heavyweight Championship after defeating Johnny Webb at the Night of Champions event. Douglas later helped expand the promotion from its base in Los Angeles to Philadelphia, and XPW held its first show in Philadelphia on August 31. Douglas would later become the final World Heavyweight Champion in XPW history, as the promotion held its final event on March 8, 2003, in his hometown of Pittsburgh.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2003-2009)===
==== The New Church and The New Franchise (2003–2004) ====

Following the closure of XPW, Martin signed with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) in June 2003. Under his Shane Douglas ring name, he debuted in TNA on the company&#x27;s weekly pay-per-view on June 11, where he immediately reignited his feud with Raven by costing him an opportunity for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. The two ended up joining separate factions as Douglas became a member of The New Church and Raven formed The Gathering. Douglas made his TNA in-ring debut on July 2, where he defeated CM Punk in a Clockwork Orange House of Fun match. Douglas and Raven clashed throughout the summer of 2003, with both men trading wins in a couple of matches.

When this feud ran down, Douglas broke away from The New Church on October 1 and began a quest to find &quot;The New Franchise&quot;. He was joined by Tracy as his new valet after his match against Sandman on November 5 and Michael Shane was introduced as Douglas&#x27; protege and the trio formed their new group called &quot;The New Franchise&quot; on November 26. Douglas took him under his wing throughout the end of 2003 and beginning of 2004, as the two joined the company&#x27;s tag team division. The duo were entered into a tournament for the vacated NWA World Tag Team Championship, where they lost to Christopher Daniels and Low Ki on March 24. The following week, Douglas and Shane participated in a four-way tag team match to receive a shot at the tag team titles, but came up short. On May 5, Shane turned on Douglas and the two squared off in a match, which Douglas won. After the match, Traci joined Shane to abandon Douglas.

==== Various roles and managing The Naturals (2004–2007) ====
When the grouping of Shane and Douglas broke up, Douglas went into a semi-in-ring retirement. He became an onscreen commentator and interviewer for TNA&#x27;s new weekly television show, &quot;Impact!&quot;, and their monthly pay-per-views. In addition to this on-screen role, he worked backstage as a road agent and took a few independent bookings.

Douglas returned to television on the May 18, 2006, episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, appearing on the entrance ramp as Andy Douglas (no relation) made the save for his tag team partner Chase Stevens after a brutal squash match against Samoa Joe. He would scout The Naturals again on the May 25 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, when Andy Douglas lost his match. A few weeks later, on June 15, Shane confronted them on their recent losing streak and their squandered talent, referring to their former manager and Douglas&#x27;s ex-Triple Threat teammate Chris Candido in the process. He offered to become their manager, which they accepted. During the promo when he offered his services, he spoke his true feelings on World Wrestling Entertainment&#x27;s revival of Extreme Championship Wrestling, admonishing Vince McMahon for &quot;exploiting the memory&quot; of the company he helped build nearly 15 years earlier. After becoming their mentor, pre-recorded videos showed Douglas training The Naturals have been shown on TNA programming, though he doesn&#x27;t stand at ringside during their matches like most other managers. Once they were deemed ready for competition, Douglas billed them as &quot;The Newly Franchised Naturals&quot;.

On the December 21 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; after The Naturals lost to Team 3D in a tables match, a fed up Douglas turned his back on them, claiming that his experiment was over. Despite the failed &quot;experiment&quot;, prior to the departure of The Naturals from TNA, Chase Stevens was featured in a match on the pre-show of the Final Resolution pay-per-view in 2007. During the match, Stevens wore the gold-and-black &quot;Franchised&quot; Naturals attire. Douglas came out after his match to heatedly confront Stevens about wearing his colors, leading to an in-ring confrontation between the two. After the angle was dropped, Douglas remained completely unseen on TNA programming. On October 10, 2007, TNA announced that Douglas was released from his TNA contract.

==== Return and feud with Christopher Daniels (2009) ====

On the May 28, 2009, episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Douglas returned to TNA and attacked Christopher Daniels after his match with A.J. Styles. The following week on &quot;Impact!&quot;, Douglas again attacked Daniels during his match before subsequently stating that he wanted a second chance in TNA like Daniels received, after the latter was, in storyline, fired from TNA. He was granted a second chance on the June 11 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, where he was given a match with A.J. Styles which he lost, only to attack Styles after the match. Daniels would come out to help Styles, only to have Douglas hit him with a towel containing a pair of handcuffs. At the Slammiversary pay-per-view, Douglas lost to Daniels in a second chance match, resulting in Daniels retaining his spot on the TNA roster. Following the match, Douglas left TNA once again, although asked by TNA to participate in their ECW reunion show &quot;Hardcore Justice&quot;, he refused the invitation.

===Return to the independent circuit (2009–present)===
On March 14, 2009, Douglas returned to the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) for the first time since he dropped the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in 15 years, wrestling for the NWA On Fire territory in a singles match, and defeating ECW alumnus Little Guido.

In 2012, Douglas announced that he would take part in Extreme Reunion, an event consisting of former ECW Originals. It was the first in a series of three events. The event was held on April 28 in the National Guard Armory of Philadelphia. The second event, Extreme Rising, was held on June 29 in New York and on June 30 in Philadelphia. There was a third show promoted by the same group, held on November 17 in Pittsburgh called Remember November. In the main event Douglas wrestled Matt Hardy to a no-contest.

On March 24, 2017, at a Pro Wrestling All-Stars of Detroit event, Douglas defeated The Great Akuma in Melvindale, Michigan, to become the Pro Wrestling All-Stars Heavyweight Champion. On April 21, Douglas defeated Paul Bowser by countout in an Extreme Rules match to successfully defend the title. He lost the title on May 12, 2017, when Breyer Wellington beat Douglas, Paul Bowser, and Atlas Hytower in a Fatal Four-Way match.

On May 13, 2017, at XICW Best In Detroit 20 in Clinton Township, Michigan, Douglas beat Joe Coleman to become the XICW Xtreme Intense Champion.
On March 3, 2018, at the World BigTime Wrestling (WBW) Extreme Warfare event in Lucas County, Ohio, Douglas defeated Shawn Blaze for the WBW Heavyweight Championship. He lost the belt back to Blaze on May 5, 2018, after the WBW commissioner interfered with the match. Douglas also feuded with Bobby Fulton, squaring off against the former Fantastic in a series of hardcore matches.

On March 11, 2018, at XICW March Madness &amp; Mayhem in Fraser, Michigan, Shane Douglas lost the XICW Xtreme Intense Title to Kongo Kong.

==Booking and promoting==
Douglas was a booker for the Xtreme Pro Wrestling (XPW) promotion during the 2000s. Under his directive, XPW moved from California to Philadelphia and featured many former Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) stars.

In mid-2005, Douglas conceived and, alongside Jeremy Borash, promoted and booked Hardcore Homecoming, a series of reunion events. The first event occurred on June 10, two days before World Wrestling Entertainment&#x27;s own ECW reunion show, ECW One Night Stand. Hardcore Homecoming&#x27;s final show occurred on November 5.

On April 9, 2009, it was announced that Douglas and Nite Owl Production were to promote a follow-up to Hardcore Homecoming called November to Remember: The Final Chair Shot. Originally, the event was to occur on June 10, 2008, the anniversary of the original Hardcore Homecoming event, but the date was rescheduled to 2009 to coincide with an American Cancer Society charity event hosted by Douglas&#x27; former valet Francine.

In 2012, Douglas founded the Extreme Reunion (later Extreme Rising) promotion. Douglas was scheduled to headline an Extreme Reunion event scheduled for April 28, 2012. Unbeknownst to WWE, Douglas appeared in the audience on the March 19, 2012, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; to promote the event, but was escorted out of the arena by security after causing a disturbance. Extreme Rising closed in 2014.

==Personal life==
In 1993 during his first stint with World Championship Wrestling, he began teaching emotional support classes, economics, and the history of the United States at Beaver Area High School. While not wrestling, Martin works as a motivational speaker.

Martin married Michelle Burke on August 17, 1987. They divorced on November 24, 1994. Five years later, Martin married Carla Marie Reeves on August 13, 1999. Their first son, Connor, was born in April 2001, and their second son, Caden Andrew, was born on December 6, 2005. Soon after his second son was born, Martin checked himself into a drug rehabilitation program due to a painkiller addiction. Since 2006, Martin has remained drug-free. He discussed this on Steve Austin&#x27;s podcast during a two-part episode in April 2015. Martin and his wife divorced in 2017.

Martin produced, choreographed and played himself in the 2013 film &quot;Pro Wrestlers vs Zombies&quot;.

In July 2016, Martin was named part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred traumatic brain injuries during their tenure and that the company concealed the risks of injury. The suit was litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. The lawsuit was dismissed by US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant in September 2018.

<text>Syria is a unitary state, but for administrative purposes, it is divided into fourteen governorates, also called provinces or counties in English (Arabic &quot;muḥāfaẓāt&quot;, singular &quot;muḥāfaẓah&quot;). The governorates are divided into sixty-five districts (&quot;manāṭiq&quot;, singular &quot;minṭaqah&quot;), which are further divided into subdistricts (&quot;nawāḥī&quot;, singular &quot;nāḥiyah&quot;). The &quot;nawāḥī&quot; contain villages, which are the smallest administrative units.

Each governorate is headed by a governor, appointed by the president, subject to cabinet approval. The governor is responsible for administration, health, social services, education, tourism, public works, transportation, domestic trade, agriculture, industry, civil defense, and maintenance of law and order in the governorate. The minister of each local administration works closely with each governor to coordinate and supervise local development projects. The governor is assisted by a provincial council, all of whose members are popularly elected for four-year terms. In addition, each council elects from among its members an executive bureau which administers the day to day issues between provincial council sessions. Each executive officer is charged with specific functions.

Districts and subdistricts are administered by officials appointed by the governor. These officials work on local matters with elected district councils and serve as intermediaries between the central government and traditional local leaders, such as village chiefs, clan leaders, and councils of elders.

<doc id="690223" wikidata="Q596953" url="?curid=690223" title="Phil Simms">
<text>Phillip Martin Simms (born November 3, 1955) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 14 seasons with the New York Giants. After playing college football for the Morehead State Eagles, Simms was selected in the first round by the Giants as the seventh overall pick in the 1979 NFL draft. Simms was named Most Valuable Player (MVP) of Super Bowl XXI, after he led the Giants to a 39–20 victory over the Denver Broncos and set the record for highest completion percentage in a Super Bowl, completing 22 of 25 passes (88%), as well as the highest passer rating in a Super Bowl at 150.9; both of these records still stand. He was also named to the Pro Bowl for his performances in the 1985 and 1993 seasons.

He finished his career with 33,462 passing yards and has since gone on to be a career broadcaster of NFL games—first as an analyst for ESPN, then as an in-game color commentator with NBC and CBS. He left CBS in 2024. He is the father of former NFL quarterback, assistant coach, and current NFL football analyst Chris Simms and former quarterback Matt Simms.

==Early life==
Simms was born in Springfield, Kentucky, on his grandfather&#x27;s farm, a place now called Maple Hill Manor in Washington County, where he attended St. Dominic&#x27;s Elementary. While in elementary school, his family moved to Louisville and he went to St. Rita Catholic grade school. Simms was the quarterback of the Trojans of Southern High School in Louisville and graduated in 1974.

==College career==
Simms chose to attend NCAA Division I FCS (formerly Division 1 AA) Morehead State of the Ohio Valley Conference in nearby Morehead.

The Morehead State Eagles ran a ball-control offense, and Simms&#x27; numbers were unspectacular—in his senior season he completed 92 of 173 passes for a 53.2% completion percentage and had six touchdown passes, 11 interceptions, and 1,229 yards. The Ohio Valley moved up to the new Division I-AA in 1978, but the Eagles went 2–6–1; they failed to make the postseason during his college career. Simms finished with 409 completions in 835 attempts for a 48.9% completion percentage. He also totaled 32 touchdowns, 45 interceptions, and a school-record 5,545 yards.

==Professional career==
===NFL draft===
Before the 1979 NFL draft, new San Francisco 49ers head coach Bill Walsh flew to Morehead State with assistant coach Sam Wyche to work out Simms. Walsh was so impressed that he planned to draft Simms in the third round, preferring him over the quarterback they ultimately took, Joe Montana of Notre Dame. But the New York Giants decided to make Simms their first round pick (seventh overall) to the surprise of many. As Simms acknowledged, &quot;most people have never heard of me.&quot; When Simms&#x27;s name was announced by Commissioner Pete Rozelle in front of the audience at the draft in New York, his selection was booed loudly by the Giants fans in attendance. He was the second quarterback taken; Jack Thompson of Washington State went to Cincinnati with the third overall pick. Simms was not then happy being a Giant either, &quot;All I was thinking was which teams I would rather play for—the Green Bay Packers, the Kansas City Chiefs, San Diego, San Francisco...&quot; But he became popular with his teammates, who jokingly dubbed him &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; in his rookie training camp.

===Rookie year===
Simms won the first five starts of his rookie year in 1979; finishing with a 6–4 record, threw for 1,743 yards and 13 touchdown passes, and was named to the NFL All-Rookie Team. He was runner-up for Rookie of the Year, behind future teammate Ottis Anderson.

===Early career: 1980–1986===
Simms&#x27; next four years were marred by injuries and inconsistent play. He finished the 1980 season with 15 touchdowns and 19 interceptions, while completing a subpar 48.0% of his passes for 2,321 yards. In 1981, Simms threw for 2,031 yards, 11 touchdowns, and 9 interceptions on 54.4% completion percentage before suffering a separated shoulder in a November 15 loss to the Washington Redskins. With Simms out, the Giants went on a run led by Scott Brunner and advanced to the second round of the playoffs. Simms suffered a torn knee ligament in a preseason game against the New York Jets, preventing him from playing the entire 1982 season. Following the season, Ray Perkins resigned as head coach to take over the same position at the University of Alabama, and was replaced by the team&#x27;s defensive coordinator Bill Parcells. In the coming years this change would prove crucial to the Giants and Simms.

One of Parcells&#x27; first decisions as coach was to replace Simms as the starting quarterback with Brunner. Simms asked to be traded after the benching, but his request was ignored. During the sixth game of the Giants&#x27; 1983 Season, Simms came in to replace the struggling Brunner against the Philadelphia Eagles. On his third drive, Simms suffered a season-ending injury when the thumb on his throwing hand hit a player&#x27;s helmet on his follow-through. The injury was reported as a dislocation, but according to the book, &quot;Simms to McConkey&quot;, written by Phil McConkey, Simms, and Dick Schaap, the injury was much more severe, with the thumb literally hanging off after impact, and the bone sticking out through the skin.

During his first few years on the team, Giants fans were merciless in their treatment of Simms, who they felt was a disappointment. He commented that his wife &quot;had to sit up in the stands and listen to them cuss me.&quot; However, in 1984, after many seasons plagued by injuries and up-and-down play, Simms finally emerged as a team offensive leader. During his 1983 injury, offensive coordinator Ron Erhardt talked Simms into watching more game film, something he had not regularly done in college or the pros. He gained a better understanding of NFL defenses, his team&#x27;s formations, and pass protection schemes, and improved his ability to audible at the line of scrimmage. He also changed his strength training regimen in an attempt to make his body more resistant to injury. He passed for 4,044 yards (second most in the National Football Conference (NFC), 22 touchdown passes, and led the Giants to a playoff berth.

He was voted to the Pro Bowl and named Pro Bowl MVP as he led the NFC to a comeback win over the American Football Conference (AFC) by throwing three touchdowns. In 1985, he passed for 3,829 yards, 22 touchdowns, and led the Giants to 10 victories, the most for a Giants team since 1963. In a game against the Cincinnati Bengals during the 1985 season, Simms passed for 513 yards—the fifth most passing yards in a single game in NFL history. In 1986, he passed for 3,487 yards and 21 touchdown passes during a season in which the Giants won 14 games. In week 11, he completed a desperate fourth-and-17 pass to Bobby Johnson late in the game to set up Raul Allegre&#x27;s game-winning field goal, which gave the Giants a 22–20 victory over the Minnesota Vikings. Simms later commented:

On January 25, 1987, the Giants faced the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXI. In the biggest game of his life, Simms had one of the finest performances in Super Bowl history. He completed 22 of 25 passes for 268 yards, setting Super Bowl records for consecutive completions (10), accuracy (88%), and passer rating (150.9). In addition, he threw 3 touchdown passes and his passer rating set an NFL postseason record. &quot;This might be the best game a quarterback has ever played&quot;, Giants coach Bill Parcells later said. Two of the most famous plays from the game were the flea flicker to McConkey, and the touchdown pass caught by McConkey off of the fingertips of Giants tight end, Mark Bavaro. The Giants defeated the Broncos 39–20, and Simms was named MVP of Super Bowl XXI. He is credited for being the first to use the phrase &quot;I&#x27;m going to Disney World!&quot; following a championship victory.

===Later career: 1987–1993===
Simms performed well in the strike-shortened 1987 NFL season, finishing with the second highest quarterback rating in the NFC. He threw for 2,230 yards, 17 touchdowns, and 9 interceptions. He passed for 3,359 yards, 21 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions while completing 54.9% of his passes in the 1988 season. The Giants rebounded from a 6–9 record in 1987 to finish 10–6 but fell just short of the playoffs due to the NFL tie-breaker system. In 1989, the Giants started 8–1 and finished 12–4, Simms passed for 3,061 yards, 14 touchdowns, and 14 interceptions on 56.3% completion percentage. He performed consistently most of the season except for a two-game stretch against the Eagles and 49ers where he produced seven turnovers, six of which resulted in points for the opposition. He also struggled in the Giants&#x27; playoff game against the Los Angeles Rams, and the Giants lost 19–13. In 1990, Simms was having one of his finest seasons, leading the NFC with the highest quarterback rating (92.7) and the Giants to an 11–3 record, but his season was cut short due to a broken foot suffered in the Week 15 game against the Giants&#x27; eventual Super Bowl XXV opponent, the Buffalo Bills. The Giants defeated the Bills 20–19 in the Super Bowl with Jeff Hostetler filling in at quarterback.

After the Giants&#x27; Super Bowl victory, Parcells resigned and was replaced by the team&#x27;s running backs coach, Ray Handley. One of Handley&#x27;s first decisions was to select Hostetler as the team&#x27;s starting quarterback following his performance in Super Bowl XXV. Simms saw only spot action in two games prior to Week 13, when Hostetler broke his back in a game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Simms finished the game and reclaimed the starting job, but won only once in his remaining four starts as the Giants failed to return to the playoffs at 8–8.

Simms was named the starter for the 1992 season after beating out Hostetler for the job in preseason. Simms suffered a severe arm injury in a Week 4 loss to the Los Angeles Raiders and missed the remainder of the season. Between the 1991 and 1992 seasons, he amassed a combined 1,905 yards, 13 touchdowns, and 7 interceptions while completing 59.3% of his passes. The Giants finished the 1992 season at 6–10, which led to Handley&#x27;s firing and the hiring of former Denver Broncos coach Dan Reeves. As part of an overall house cleaning, Reeves released Hostetler and named Simms his starting quarterback. Simms started all 16 games in 1993, being one of only seven quarterbacks to do so, and led the Giants to a resurgent 11–5 season including a victory over the Minnesota Vikings in the playoffs. He underwent shoulder surgery after the 1993 NFL season to repair a torn labrum. The surgery was successful, and team doctor Russell F. Warren&#x27;s prognosis for recovery was excellent, and Simms was expected to be ready in time for training camp. However, later during that offseason, Simms was released by the Giants, and subsequently decided to retire. Upon his release, co-owner Wellington Mara called it &quot;a day of overwhelming sadness.&quot;. In an interview in the 2024 documentary &quot;The Duke: The Giant Life of Wellington Mara&quot;, Simms recalled that Mara didn&#x27;t agree with the decision to let him go and was willing to make changes to the front office to ensure Simms stayed, but Simms declined saying it would just make it worse.

Simms considered playing for the Cardinals in 1994 and the Browns in 1995, but eventually decided to stay retired.

In his 14 seasons with the Giants, Simms completed 2,576 out of 4,647 passes for 33,462 yards and 199 touchdowns. His career passing yardage total ranked him at 11th in NFL history at the time of his retirement. He added 349 carries for 1,252 rushing yards and 6 touchdowns on the ground. He set team records for most passes completed and attempted in one game (40 and 62, respectively), season (286, 533), and career (2,576, 4,647), most career touchdown passes (199) and most 300-yard games in a career (21). Simms still owns some of the New York Giants passing records, although Eli Manning has surpassed most of them: season passes (387 completed, 618 attempted), career completed passes (4,895), career touchdowns (366), career 300-yard games (53). &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; considered Simms to be the &quot;Most Underrated Quarterback&quot; in NFL history in their August 27, 2001, issue entitled, &quot;The Most Overrated and Underrated&quot;.

==Post NFL career==

On September 4, 1995, Simms&#x27; jersey was retired in a halftime ceremony of a game versus the Dallas Cowboys. During an emotional speech, Simms stated that he wanted to don his jersey one final time, and throw &quot;one more pass&quot; to teammate Lawrence Taylor. Simms later commented, &quot;[a]ll of a sudden it kind of hit me, I&#x27;ve put Lawrence in a really tough spot; national TV, he&#x27;s got dress shoes and a sports jacket on, and he&#x27;s had a few beers and he&#x27;s going to run down the field and I&#x27;m going to throw him a pass.&quot; Simms then motioned for Taylor to run a longer pattern, and after 30–40 yards, threw him the pass. Taylor later stated that the situation made him more nervous than any play of his career, &quot;I&#x27;m saying to myself (as the pass is being thrown), &#x27;If I drop this pass, I got to run my black ass all the way to Upper Saddle River because there ain&#x27;t no way I&#x27;m going to be able to stay in that stadium&#x27;.&quot; Taylor caught the pass however, and the capacity crowd in attendance cheered in approval.

After his retirement as a player in 1994, Simms first joined ESPN then went on to join NBC&#x27;s lead broadcast crew, teaming with Dick Enberg and Paul Maguire on NBC&#x27;s coverage of Super Bowl XXX and Super Bowl XXXII. Simms also announced weightlifting at the 1996 Summer Olympics and served as a sideline reporter on the &quot;NBA on NBC&quot; for NBC Sports. In 1998, he moved to CBS with the AFC package, teaming first with Greg Gumbel (through the end of the 2003 season) and later with Jim Nantz on the CBS&#x27;s lead broadcast team. He also worked with Armen Keteyian, Bonnie Bernstein, Lesley Visser, and Tracy Wolfson. Since 2009, he has been a host of &quot;Inside the NFL&quot; on Showtime (another CBS holding) with James Brown and Cris Collinsworth. In 2017, he was replaced by Tony Romo as a color commentator and joined the CBS pregame show &quot;The NFL Today&quot;. He left CBS after his contract expired at the end of the 2023 season. Simms has also worked on Westwood One as an analyst for select games in 2024.

Simms joined WFAN&#x27;s &quot;Boomer and Gio&quot; in 2024.

Simms was part of the commentary team along with Nantz in the &quot;Madden NFL&quot; &quot;13&quot;, &quot;25&quot;, &quot;15&quot;, and &quot;16&quot; video games.

Outside of football broadcasting, Simms co-hosted the Miss Universe 2002 pageant with actress and model Daisy Fuentes. He made an appearance as himself on the CBS soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot; in 2007, and in February 2010 made an appearance on &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; (with Nantz) to present a Super Bowl XLIV showcase. In the same month, he appeared as himself (again with Nantz) on the &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; episode &quot;Rabbit or Duck&quot;. On November 13, 2014, Simms appeared uncredited on the episode &quot;Just a Regular Irregular&quot; of the CBS television series &quot;Elementary&quot;. Simms&#x27; cameo was as a consultant to Sherlock Holmes in the art of knife throwing. Furthermore, Simms was forced to settle a debt with Holmes by loaning him a Super Bowl ring for the purpose of advancing the investigation.

==Personal life==
Simms and his wife, Diana, live in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey. They have three children: Chris, Deirdre, and Matt. His son-in-law is former NFL linebacker Brian Toal, who was schoolmates with Matt. Simms is fond of New Jersey, remarking in 1987: &quot;I wasn&#x27;t overjoyed about coming to New York. When I thought of New York, I thought of New York &quot;City&quot;. But out here, it&#x27;s just like anywhere else.&quot;

In 2011, Simms was inducted into the Kentucky Pro Football Hall of Fame.

<doc id="690225" wikidata="Q1335828" url="?curid=690225" title="Greg Valentine">
<text>Jonathan Anthony Wisniski (born September 20, 1951) is a retired American professional wrestler, better known as Greg &quot;the Hammer&quot; Valentine. He is the son of wrestler Johnny Valentine.

Over five decades, Valentine held more than 40 championships, including the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship, WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship, WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship, NWA World Tag Team Championship, and WWF World Tag Team Championship. An alumnus of Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling, the World Wrestling Federation and World Championship Wrestling, he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2004 and the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2016.

==Early life==
Born in Seattle, Washington, Wisniski traveled around Texas in his teens with his father; Johnny Valentine. During a summer vacation, he decided to drop out of college and become a wrestler. His father initially tried to deter him, but eventually ceded to his wishes and sent him to Canada in 1970 to train under Stu Hart in Calgary.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career (1970–1976)===
Wisniski was trained to wrestle by Stu Hart, wrestling his debut match in July 1970 against Angelo &quot;King Kong&quot; Mosca (he lost in around five minutes). Six months later, Wisniski relocated to Detroit to complete his training under the Sheik.

Initially reluctant to take his father&#x27;s ring name, Wisniski wrestled as Baby Face Nelson before becoming Johnny Fargo, one half of the Fargo Brothers with Don Fargo between 1971 and 1974. The Fargo Brothers initially competed in the Buffalo and Cleveland based National Wrestling Federation before moving on to Texas. They split in 1974 and Wisniski went to Florida, where he began performing as Johnny Valentine Jr., hopeful that he could live up to his father&#x27;s legacy. He later changed his ring name to Greg &quot;the Hammer&quot; Valentine, and was billed as Johnny Valentine&#x27;s brother, not his son, because of fears that the elder Valentine would be thought of as too old to be a legitimate threat. Valentine remained in Florida for a year while also working in Los Angeles and in Japan under Antonio Inoki in 1975 and early 1976.

===Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling (1976–1978)===
In August 1976, Valentine debuted in Jim Crockett Jr.&#x27;s Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling and booked by George Scott, an affiliate of the National Wrestling Alliance based in the Carolinas and Virginias. Valentine was hired to replace his father, who had been forced to retire after he broke his back in a plane crash in 1975. He immediately began feuding with Johnny Weaver, who he &quot;retired&quot; with a top rope elbow drop. Valentine&#x27;s elbow drop was promoted as a deadly move, with tapes of him breaking wooden boards with his elbow shown to the audiences before his debut.

Valentine then formed a tag team with Ric Flair, with whom he twice won the NWA World tag team title and held the NWA Mid-Atlantic Tag Team Championship (between June 30 and August 22, 1977). They first defeated Gene and Ole Anderson on December 26, 1976 (who nine years later would become in storyline Flair&#x27;s &quot;cousins&quot;) in Greensboro, injuring Gene so badly that he had to be stretchered out. They held the titles until May 8, 1977, when the Andersons defeated them in a steel cage match in the old Charlotte Coliseum.

Flair and Valentine regained the tag titles from the Andersons on October 30, this time leaving Ole unable to leave under his own power. The team split after they were stripped of the titles in April 1978 by NWA president Eddie Graham as a result of their &quot;unprofessional conduct&quot;. Flair then set his sights on the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, while Valentine held the NWA World Tag Team Championships once more with Baron von Raschke in 1978.

At the same time, Valentine feuded with Chief Wahoo McDaniel over the NWA Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship. Wahoo had cost Valentine and Flair their first tag team championships (Wahoo, the then-nemesis of Flair, had been the special referee in the steel cage match), so Valentine was eager for revenge. On June 11, 1977, in Raleigh he defeated Wahoo, breaking his leg in the process. Though Wahoo&#x27;s legs were too thick for Valentine to apply his signature Figure Four leglock, he managed to break Wahoo&#x27;s ankle using a leg/ankle suplex. The heel Valentine then began wearing a T-shirt with the slogan &quot;&quot;I broke Wahoo&#x27;s leg&quot; on the front and &quot;No more Wahoo&quot;&quot; on the back. Wahoo returned on August 9, 1977, and took back the title. Valentine would hold the title once more, defeating Wahoo again on September 10 and losing to Ken Patera on April 9, 1978.

===World Wide Wrestling Federation (1978–1979)===
Valentine began working on a casual basis for the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF), then owned by Vincent J. McMahon, in November 1978. Managed by The Grand Wizard, he was given the gimmick of a methodical wrestler who broke the legs of all his opponents, including Chief Jay Strongbow. In February 1979, he wrestled then WWWF Heavyweight Champion Bob Backlund to a one-hour time-limit draw at Madison Square Garden.

===Return to Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling (1979–1981)===
Valentine returned to the NWA in late 1979 and asked Flair to reform their tag team. Flair, by then a face, declined. Valentine held the NWA World Tag Team Championship once more with Ray Stevens in 1980. Four days after their victory, the promoter, David Crockett told Valentine and Stevens that he possessed film which proved that the illegal man had been pinned in the tag match, nullifying the win. When Crockett threatened to send the film to NWA president Bob Geigel who said he would overturn their victory, Stevens and Valentine attacked him and cut the film up with a pocketknife, destroying the evidence.

Valentine later claimed to have &quot;seen the light&quot;, and re-formed his team with Flair, who believed that Valentine was now a face. In a tag match against Jimmy Snuka and the Iron Sheik, Valentine abandoned Flair, leaving him outnumbered. Flair was beaten, and then Valentine snapped Gene Anderson&#x27;s hickory cane over Flair&#x27;s head, legitimately breaking his nose and splitting his lips. The former partners began feuding over Flair&#x27;s NWA United States Heavyweight Championship, with Valentine finally defeating Flair for the title on July 26 in Flair&#x27;s adopted hometown of Charlotte. He held the title until November 24, when he was beaten by Flair; Flair became one of Valentine&#x27;s main opponents in the Mid-Atlantic territory.

===World Wrestling Federation (1981–1982)===
Valentine returned to the WWF, now known as the World Wrestling Federation, for a year in 1981 and continued to pursue the title. On October 19, he was pinned by Backlund, but then handed the title belt by the dazed referee. The title was held up, and Backlund defeated Valentine cleanly in the November 23 rematch. In January 1982, Valentine met Backlund yet again, this time in a steel cage, for the WWF Heavyweight Championship at the Philadelphia Spectrum, which Backlund won.

He also feuded with Pedro Morales over the WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship, who he &quot;injured&quot; by suplexing him on the concrete floor of the arena. Valentine was not successful in winning this title either, and in mid-1982 left the promotion.

===Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling (1982–1984)===
Valentine would hold the United States Championship twice more, renewing his feud with Wahoo in 1982 and defeating him for the title on November 4 with the assistance of his manager, Sir Oliver Humperdink. Roddy Piper began pursuing the title, and, after Piper gave Valentine a cake with a dog collar inside, the two had a series of brutal dog collar matches, most notably at Starrcade 1983, where Piper pinned Valentine in a non-title match after repeatedly whipping him with the steel chain. The feud was intensified by Valentine&#x27;s propensity to focus on Piper&#x27;s ear, which had been injured earlier in his career and would bleed easily. Piper would eventually defeat Valentine on April 16, 1983, but Valentine regained the title on April 30 in Greensboro, NC; after the match, where he regained the US Title from Piper, Valentine hit Piper in the ear with US Title. He dropped the title to Dick Slater on December 14, just before leaving them for the World Wrestling Federation.
=== World Wrestling Federation (1984–1992) ===

==== Intercontinental Champion (1984–1985) ====
Valentine went back to the WWF in 1984, predicting that Vince McMahon&#x27;s plan for national expansion would succeed. His first manager was Captain Lou Albano, and he was later managed by Jimmy Hart.
On September 24, 1984, in London, Ontario Valentine defeated Tito Santana for the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship, focusing on Santana&#x27;s injured knee throughout the match. Santana initially thought he had the match won, but had in fact only achieved a two-count. As Santana was celebrating, Valentine rolled him up for the pin and the title. Following the win, Valentine put Santana in the figure four leglock, reinjuring him. While Santana was sidelined having leg surgery, Valentine feuded with the Junkyard Dog, who he faced in an Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship Title match at the very first WrestleMania held in Madison Square Garden. Valentine pinned the JYD after using the ropes, but Santana came to ringside and informed the referee, who restarted the match. Valentine then walked out, losing the match by count-out but saving his title. Santana eventually healed and fought Valentine in many matches. He went on to win the title back on July 6, 1985, in a steel cage match in Baltimore, ending Valentine&#x27;s 285-day reign, the fifth-longest in Intercontinental title history. Valentine, incensed over losing the championship belt, destroyed it in the steel cage, forcing the WWF to get a new Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship belt (in reality, this was pre-planned as the WWF already had a newer, more modern Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship belt made and destroying the old title belt was seen as the perfect way to introduce the new one).

==== Dream Team; New Dream Team (1985–1987) ====

Valentine would then form a tag team with Brutus Beefcake known as The Dream Team, managed by &quot;Luscious&quot; Johnny V. Initially the team was managed by both Jimmy Hart and Johnny V, but the WWF dropped Hart from the group and he went on to manage the Hart Foundation. On August 24, 1985, at The Spectrum in Philadelphia, the Dream Team defeated the U.S. Express for the WWF Tag Team Championship when Beefcake rubbed Johnny V&#x27;s lit cigar in Windham&#x27;s eyes allowing him to be pinned. They held the titles until April 7, 1986, when they were defeated at WrestleMania 2 by The British Bulldogs (Davey Boy Smith and the Dynamite Kid). At WrestleMania III, The Dream Team defeated the Rougeau Brothers as a result of interference by Johnny V and Dino Bravo. Upset because of a missed move by Beefcake during the match, Valentine left with Bravo and abandoned Beefcake, resulting in Brutus turning face later on in the night.

Replacing Beefcake with Dino Bravo, Valentine formed the New Dream Team. Valentine was unhappy about teaming with Bravo, who he felt he had little chemistry with. After the WWF asked him to &quot;kidnap&quot; Matilda, the bulldog mascot of The British Bulldogs, Valentine resigned. He was brought back soon after, with Jimmy Hart again as his new manager (while the &quot;kidnap&quot; angle was reassigned to The Islanders) but was used in a much diminished role between 1987 and 1990.

==== Feuds with Don Muraco and Ron Garvin (1988–1990) ====
Valentine was entered in the WWF World Heavyweight Championship tournament at WrestleMania IV, where he defeated Ricky &quot;the Dragon&quot; Steamboat in the first round before losing to &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage, the eventual winner of the tournament, in the quarter-finals.

In May 1988, Jimmy Hart fitted Valentine&#x27;s left shin with a shin guard, citing a mysterious injury to his wrestler, and proclaiming the shin guard as Valentine&#x27;s &quot;road to the gold.&quot;

Later in 1988, Valentine feuded with &quot;The Rock&quot; Don Muraco, who had turned face a year earlier. The feud was triggered when Valentine viciously attacked Muraco&#x27;s manager, former WWF Heavyweight Champion Superstar Billy Graham. Graham, walking with a cane, tried to intervene when Valentine held the figure-four leglock on jobber Ricky Ataki, after already winning the match. Valentine then put the figure-four leglock on Graham, who had a plastic hip. The feud was abruptly halted when Muraco was dismissed by the WWF, despite Valentine&#x27;s pleas for Muraco not to be fired so that the promising program could be allowed to run. (Kayfabe magazine &quot;Inside Wrestling&quot; had run a story on the feud, conversely claiming that it was Muraco, yearning to personally avenge Graham&#x27;s injuries, who had begged the WWF not to dismiss Valentine).

In April 1989 he began feuding with &quot;Rugged&quot; Ronnie Garvin. Two weeks after WrestleMania V (where he teamed with the Jimmy Hart managed Honky Tonk Man in a loss to the now babyface Hart Foundation), he defeated Garvin in a retirement match on &quot;Superstars of Wrestling&quot; by reversing a small package and holding on to the ropes. Garvin became a referee until Valentine and Hart managed to have him fired. Garvin then became a ring announcer, and began aggravating Valentine. At &quot;SummerSlam 1989&quot;, for his match with Hercules, Garvin announced Valentine as being Hercules&#x27; &quot;so-called opponent&quot; and at 249 lbs looking to Garvin like he was &quot;overweight by thirty pounds&quot; as he approached the ring. Other insults by Garvin during the introduction included Valentine not knowing whether he was &quot;coming or going&quot; and being the only wrestler Garvin knew who had &quot;two left feet&quot; and that he had a &quot;pipsqueak, poor excuse for a manager&quot;. Following the match, Garvin then announced Hercules as the winner when Valentine cheated to win, despite the referee declaring Valentine the winner. Valentine knocked Garvin out of the ring before having a further punching match with Hercules while Garvin climbed back in the ring and nailed Valentine. Valentine and Jimmy Hart eventually demanded that Garvin be reinstated so that they could fight in the ring.

For some time Valentine had been wearing a shin guard, which he would rotate (so it covered his calf, not his shin) in order to increase the pressure exerted by the Figure Four Leglock. He referred to the shin guard as the &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;. Valentine would also (illegally) attach the shin guard to his arm in order to accentuate his elbow drops. In the course of the feud, Garvin countered with a rotated shin guard of his own, which he dubbed &quot;the Hammer Jammer&quot;. The feud culminated in a submission match at the 1990 Royal Rumble. Garvin utilized the &quot;Hammer Jammer&quot; during the match, using it to &quot;counter&quot; Valentine&#x27;s figure-four leglock when Valentine applied it on Garvin during the match (rather than writhing in pain as normal during the hold, Garvin was smiling and making faces at Valentine). Jimmy Hart managed to remove the &quot;Hammer Jammer&quot; from Garvin&#x27;s leg, after which Valentine systematically wore down Garvin&#x27;s leg, but eventually lost after Garvin hit him with the Heartbreaker and applied a sharpshooter, forcing Valentine to submit.

==== Rhythm and Blues (1990–1991) ====
Shortly after, Valentine formed a tag team with The Honky Tonk Man. For around eight months Valentine resisted dying his hair black (an idea of Jesse &quot;The Body&quot; Ventura) but eventually relented and since Honky Tonk Man was an Elvis Presley look alike, Valentine became a Roy Orbison look alike and the team became known as Rhythm and Blues and were managed by Jimmy Hart. Rhythm and Blues feuded with The Bushwhackers (Butch and Luke) and The Hart Foundation against whom they received title shots, but were overshadowed by the Legion Of Doom (Animal and Hawk), who were by then dominating the tag division, feuding with former champions Demolition in six man tag main events also featuring WWF World champion The Ultimate Warrior while the Harts&#x27; tag team title defences against Valentine and Honky were relegated to opening match status. Famously during the time of Rhythm and Blues, WWF announcer Gorilla Monsoon would proclaim every time Valentine got on the microphone and sang (while also attempting to play a guitar) that &quot;if you hung The Hammer for being a good singer you would hang an innocent person&quot;.

In mid December his partner The Honky Tonk Man departed the World Wrestling Federation. An angle was recorded on December 28, 1990, at Madison Square Garden where he was defeated by Saba Simba after accidentally being hit by Jimmy Hart&#x27;s guitar; afterwards he almost attacked his manager and began to be cheered by the fans. On January 7, 1991, the angle was furthered. In a match that saw Davey Boy Smith defeat Dino Bravo, Valentine was again accidentally hit by Jimmy Hart&#x27;s megaphone. This time Valentine attacked Jimmy Hart and turned face. However, Valentine abruptly departed the company and along with the Honky Tonk Man&#x27;s aforementioned departure from the WWF this effectively cancelled the planned feud with Valentine.

==== Babyface run (1991–1992) ====
On January 19, 1991, Valentine participated in the fourth annual Royal Rumble match. He lasted forty four minutes. On the February 17, 1991 edition of &quot;Wrestling Challenge&quot;, the WWF aired footage from the incident with Jimmy Hart at Madison Square Garden at the end of 1990. This began the televised process of his face turn. Valentine lost to the Jimmy Hart managed Earthquake at WrestleMania VII, and was defeated again at SummerSlam 1991 by Irwin R. Schyster. He participated in the 1992 Royal Rumble for the vacated WWF Championship, where he attacked his old rival Ric Flair before being eliminated by the Repo Man. Later that month he finished his run with the company, defeating Skinner at a house show on January 25, 1992, in Chicago, Illinois.

=== Universal Wrestling Federation (1991) ===
Herb Abrams had aggressive plans for his Universal Wrestling Federation, announcing the signings of name wrestlers such as Andre the Giant, Steve Williams, The Killer Bees, and Bob Orton. Added to this list was Greg Valentine, who joined the company on January 9, 1991. He made his debut that night at a television taping in the Penta Hotel in New York City, defeating Sonny Blaze. He later defeated Mike Durham at the same taping, and was interviewed by Albano, his former WWF manager in the &quot;Captain Lou&#x27;s Corner&quot; segment on UWF television. However his stay in the UWF was technically only for that TV taping; as with Andre the Giant, Vince McMahon responded to Abram&#x27;s announcement by luring Greg Valentine back to the WWF. In an interview in 2000, Valentine stated that Abrams retaliated by withholding payment for his appearances in the UWF. During this period, Valentine also visited Egypt where he challenged local champion Mamdouh Farag.

=== World Championship Wrestling (1992) ===
Conscious of his diminishing status, Valentine left the WWF and signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1992. He made his debut on February 4, 1992, at a house show in Norfolk, Virginia. Teaming with Terry Taylor, the duo defeated Marcus Alexander Bagwell and Tom Zenk. On February 15, 1992, he made his debut on television. Two weeks later, he teamed again with Terry Taylor to defeat Ron Simmons and Big Josh to win the WCW United States Tag Team Championship. Throughout the spring the duo successfully defended the belts against Zenk and Bagwell on various house shows. On May 17, 1992, at WrestleWar 92 they lost the titles to The Freebirds. At Beach Blast, Valentine pinned Marcus Bagwell. In July, he became involved in an angle with Dusty Rhodes and Dustin Rhodes where he confronted the father/son duo on &quot;WCW Worldwide&quot;. Both Rhodes attacked Valentine, only to then be retaliated upon by Dick Slater and The Barbarian.

Valentine faced Dustin Rhodes on multiple house shows that summer and was winless. While in this series, Valentine also began to regularly team with Dick Slater. The duo wrestled The Freebirds and Barry Windham &amp; Dustin Rhodes. On Clash of the Champions XX, Bobby Eaton &amp; Arn Anderson defeated Slater and Valentine in a rare heel vs heel match. In September 1992 Valentine engaged in a house show feud with Van Hammer and was undefeated. In the fall he continued to team with Slater in matches against The Steiner Brothers. On television, Valentine&#x27;s fortunes continued to wane. On the October 11, 1992 edition of &quot;WCW Pro&quot; he was defeated by Shane Douglas. On the October 19, 1992 taping of &quot;WCW Saturday Night&quot; he arrived to learn that he was to lose to Sting on that night&#x27;s taping. In addition he was not scheduled to be booked at any upcoming events, and Valentine resigned from the promotion.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1993–1994) ===
He reappeared in the WWF at the 1993 Survivor Series under a mask as The Blue Knight in an elimination match pitting Shawn Michaels (who was substituting for Jerry Lawler) and his three &quot;knights&quot; (who also included Barry Horowitz as the Red Knight and Jeff Gaylord as the Black Knight) against the Hart Family. He would return again, as Greg Valentine, at the 1994 Royal Rumble, lasting over twenty minutes before being eliminated by Rick Martel. That summer Valentine would wrestle three times on a July house show tour, facing Bob Backlund on each occasion.

===Independent circuit (1994–1996)===
Valentine went on to tour the independent circuit, wrestling in Japan, with the Hamilton based International Championship Wrestling promotion and with the American Wrestling Federation.

===World Championship Wrestling (1996–1998)===
Starting in the summer of 1996, Valentine made several appearances with WCW over the course of the next two years. He was used on a pay-per-appearance basis, but was rarely utilized and was allowed to continue wrestling on the independent circuit. On July 1, 1996, Valentine faced Randy Savage on &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot; in Landover, Maryland. Valentine was used primarily on television, facing The Giant, Harlem Heat, and Lex Luger. The following year he was used sparingly as well, again on television but had a 6–2 record, defeating Mike Enos, Bobby Eaton, and Billy Kidman. Valentine wrestled four times for the promotion in 1998 and was 3–1. He finished his WCW run with a victory over Pat Tanaka on February 17, 1998.

=== Late career (1998–2019)===
On October 10, 1999, he appeared on the infamous Heroes of Wrestling pay-per-view, pinning George &quot;The Animal&quot; Steele with the assistance of Sherri Martel. He wrestled on the 2000 tour of the United Kingdom in which Yokozuna died. He was also involved with the short-lived X Wrestling Federation as an investor and as an in-ring performer. In the 2000s, he began reducing his independent dates in order to pursue a career in real estate.

<doc id="690226" wikidata="Q379538" url="?curid=690226" title="Ricky Steamboat">
<text>Richard Henry Blood Sr. (born February 28, 1953), better known by his ring name Ricky &quot;the Dragon&quot; Steamboat, is an American retired professional wrestler best known for his work with the American Wrestling Association (AWA), Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP), World Championship Wrestling (WCW), and the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). Steamboat is regarded as one of the greatest and most influential professional wrestlers of all time.

In JCP and WCW, he was a one-time NWA World Heavyweight Champion, a four-time United States Heavyweight Champion, a four-time World Television Champion, a 12-time World Tag Team Champion (eight under the WCW banner, one (though unofficial) under the NWA banner, and three under the Mid-Atlantic banner), and a two-time Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Champion. In the WWF/E, Steamboat was a one-time Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2009.

== Early life ==
Of English and Japanese American descent, Blood was born in West Point, New York on February 28, 1953. He went to high school first in New York and later graduated in 1971 from Boca Ciega High School in Gulfport, Florida, where he was on the wrestling team. He was a two-time New York state qualifier and a Florida state champion.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== American Wrestling Association (1976) ===
Blood was trained to wrestle by Verne Gagne and The Iron Sheik. He debuted in March 1976 as a babyface in Gagne&#x27;s Minneapolis, Minnesota–based American Wrestling Association (AWA), wrestling as &quot;Dick Blood&quot;. His early opponents included Scott Irwin, Buck Zumhofe, Mad Dog Vachon, and Blackjack Lanza. In May 1976, he took part in a two ring, $50,000 battle royal that was won by Mad Dog Vachon and Larry Hennig. He left the AWA later that month to join Championship Wrestling from Florida.

=== Championship Wrestling from Florida (1976–1977) ===
Before Blood&#x27;s debut in Championship Wrestling from Florida, Eddie Graham gave him the ring name &quot;Ricky Steamboat&quot; based on his resemblance to Hawaiian wrestler Sammy Steamboat. According to Steamboat, Graham thought &quot;Rick Blood&quot; was a good name for a heel, but not a face.

=== Jim Crockett Promotions (1977–1985) ===
In 1977, Steamboat entered the National Wrestling Alliance-sanctioned Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) (which ran under the concurrent brand names &quot;Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling&quot; and &quot;Wide World Wrestling&quot;—later &quot;World Wide Wrestling&quot;—as well as airing syndicated TV programs under those respective names), where he would remain for the next eight years of his career. Steamboat, who had been brought in by JCP booker George Scott on the recommendation of Wahoo McDaniel, was initially billed as a babyface protege of Wahoo and barely spoke above whispers in interviews. Matching him with his brash young counterpart, Ric Flair, was a natural fit. Steamboat was doing an interview on the syndicated &quot;Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling&quot; when Flair, then Mid-Atlantic television champion, began goading him. Steamboat knocked Flair out with a backhand chop to set up a match between the two. Steamboat&#x27;s star-making performance came when he pinned Flair after a double thrust off the top rope to win the NWA Mid-Atlantic Television Championship at the WRAL-TV studios in Raleigh, North Carolina.

Over the next eight years in JCP, Steamboat captured the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship three times and the NWA World Tag Team Championship six times (once with Paul Jones and five times with Jay Youngblood). He also held the NWA Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship singles crown twice and the NWA Mid-Atlantic Tag Team Championship four times (three times with Paul Jones, once with Jay Youngblood). He also won the Television title (which had been renamed NWA World Television Championship) a second time.

Notable moments involving Steamboat&#x27;s time in the Mid-Atlantic territory include: the day Flair dragged his face around the television studio, causing facial scarring, and Steamboat retaliating the following week by ripping Flair&#x27;s expensive suit to shreds (an angle that would be reworked several times involving other wrestlers in the years that followed); when longtime tag team partner Jones turned heel on Steamboat at the end of a two-ring battle royal; Steamboat and Youngblood painting yellow streaks down the backs of Paul Jones and Baron von Raschke to embarrass them into defending the World Tag Team titles against the two; Steamboat and Youngblood&#x27;s top drawing feud with Sgt. Slaughter and Don Kernodle; Steamboat and Youngblood being turned on by their friends Jack and Jerry Brisco; Steamboat in a shocking (and emotional) feud against former mentor McDaniel; and his last great series in the territory, feuding with Tully Blanchard over the NWA TV title. After creative differences with JCP booker Dusty Rhodes, Steamboat left the NWA.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1985–1988) ===

==== Birth of &quot;the Dragon&quot; (1985–1986) ====

In 1985, Steamboat was offered a contract by Vince McMahon and joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Shortly after his debut (where he defeated Steve Lombardi on &quot;Championship Wrestling&quot;), Steamboat was given the gimmick of a babyface nicknamed &quot;the Dragon&quot;; Steamboat&#x27;s jacket-and-trunks attire was replaced by a &quot;keikogi&quot; and long tights. Steamboat&#x27;s mother is Japanese American, hence his Asian features crucial for his &quot;Dragon&quot; gimmick. Steamboat kept the nickname and gimmick for the remainder of his career.

He appeared at the inaugural WrestleMania, where he defeated Matt Borne in the card&#x27;s third match. On the September 14, 1985, edition of &quot;Championship Wrestling&quot;, Steamboat defeated Mr. Fuji, but after his victory was attacked by Fuji&#x27;s protege Don Muraco, pitting Steamboat in a feud against Muraco and Fuji. During a televised episode of &quot;Championship Wrestling&quot;, Steamboat and Muraco were scheduled for a match that never officially started after Muraco jumped Steamboat before the bell. Following the beat down, Muraco and Fuji used Steamboat&#x27;s karate black belt to hang him outside the ring from the top rope before Steamboat was finally saved by Tito Santana and the Junkyard Dog. On the November 2 &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event III&quot;, he defeated Fuji in a kung-fu challenge. On the January 4, 1986, &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event IV&quot;, his intense feud with Muraco ended after he and the JYD beat Muraco and Fuji in a tag team match.

In the opening round at WWF The Wrestling Classic, Steamboat faced Davey Boy Smith in a rare match pitting two fan favorites against each other. The match moved back and forth until Smith landed in the ropes trying to attack Steamboat, but Steamboat sidestepped and Smith injured his groin and was unable to continue, so Steamboat was awarded the match by forfeit. He then faced off against Randy Savage in the quarterfinals. The referee was distracted by Miss Elizabeth as Savage took advantage and pulled out brass knuckles from his tights and hit Steamboat before pinning him to win the match.

After a victory over Hercules Hernandez at the Los Angeles portion of WrestleMania 2, Steamboat began his next feud with Jake &quot;The Snake&quot; Roberts. Their feud began when Roberts attacked him before their match on the May 3 &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event VI&quot;, which did not occur due to Roberts assaulting Steamboat. Roberts was initially reluctant to deliver the DDT on the concrete floor due to his fear that Steamboat would not be able to stop his head from hitting the floor, which, on this particular occasion, was not covered with protective mats. Vince McMahon and booker George Scott were adamant that the spot take place outside the ring. Only after assurances by Steamboat that he would protect himself did Roberts agree to it. However, Roberts&#x27; fears came true and Steamboat was legitimately knocked out when his forehead hit the concrete. Roberts later described the sound as like a watermelon bursting. They later battled each other in a Snake Pit match (no DQ) in front of 74,000 fans at &quot;The Big Event&quot; in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, which Steamboat won with a small package despite Roberts dominating virtually the entire match to that point. Their feud finally ended on the October 4 &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event VII&quot;, when Steamboat defeated Roberts in their Snake Pit rematch. Following the match, Roberts continued to attack Steamboat and was about to place his snake Damiene on him, but Steamboat took his Komodo Dragon out of his bag and scared Roberts from the ring.

==== Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion and departure (1986–1988) ====

On the November 22, 1986 edition of &quot;Superstars&quot;, Steamboat got a shot at the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship against Macho Man Randy Savage. Steamboat lost the match by countout but after the match, Savage continued to assault him and injured Steamboat&#x27;s larynx (kayfabe) with the ring bell, beginning an angle between the two. On the January 3, 1987 &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event IX&quot;, Steamboat returned from his injury and prevented Savage from attacking George Steele like he had done to Steamboat six weeks prior. At WrestleMania III, Steamboat defeated Savage for the Intercontinental Championship. The highly influential match was considered an instant classic by both fans and critics and was named 1987&#x27;s Match of the Year by both &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot; and the &quot;Wrestling Observer&quot;.

Several weeks after winning the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship, Steamboat asked WWF owner Vince McMahon for some time off to be with his wife Bonnie, who was expecting the birth of their first son, Richard, Jr. This did not sit well with WWF management as he had been groomed to become a long-term champion. The decision was made by WWF management to punish Steamboat by having him initially drop the title to Butch Reed, but Reed did not show up that night, so he dropped to The Honky Tonk Man on the June 15 edition of &quot;Superstars&quot;; his son was born a month later. Steamboat came back in time for the Survivor Series in November 1987. WWF management was still bitter over his impromptu sabbatical from his first WWF run, however, and he was not pushed or given any meaningful feuds. Steamboat himself has implied in interviews that he was being punished for one-upping the Hogan-Andre main event at WrestleMania III. After defeating Ravishing Rick Rude by disqualification at 1988 Royal Rumble, Steamboat was entered into the tournament for the vacant WWF World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania IV in March 1988. On WWF television prior to the match, Steamboat appeared in a vignette where he stated that he hoped Randy Savage would win his first round match, thus setting up a rematch of last year&#x27;s WrestleMania match and &quot;one more classic confrontation&quot;. However, Steamboat would lose to his first round opponent Greg &quot;The Hammer&quot; Valentine. Although television segments were shot immediately after WrestleMania IV that made it appear that Steamboat would be facing Valentine in a series of matches, Steamboat left the WWF shortly thereafter.

=== World Championship Wrestling (1989) ===
Steamboat made his comeback to wrestling in January 1989 and returned to the NWA (specifically, NWA affiliate World Championship Wrestling) on the January 21, 1989 edition of &quot;World Championship Wrestling&quot; (it would later become the name of the promotion) as a surprise tag team partner of &quot;Hot Stuff&quot; Eddie Gilbert against NWA World Champion, Ric Flair and Barry Windham in a tag team match that saw Steamboat pin Flair. This earned him a shot at the title at Chi-Town Rumble where Steamboat defeated Flair in the main event for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. He was also the last NWA World Champion to defend the belt in All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) in a match against Tiger Mask II. After Steamboat retained the NWA title against Flair in a controversial ending on the April 2 &quot;Clash of the Champions VI: Ragin&#x27; Cajun&quot;, Flair and Steamboat would then face each other in their final rematch at WrestleWar in May, where Steamboat dropped the title to Flair. 

After losing the title, Steamboat remained the number one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, a fact that irked fellow babyface U.S. Champion Lex Luger. This dispute culminated in Luger attacking Steamboat on the June 14 &quot;Clash of the Champions VII: Guts and Glory&quot;, thus turning heel. Luger stood over the fallen Steamboat and arrogantly said, &quot;There lays your number one contender!&quot; Steamboat then demanded a no disqualification match against Luger at The Great American Bash for the title, but just before the bell Luger demanded the clause be dropped or there would not be a match. Steamboat lost the match by disqualification after hitting Luger with a chair. Due to a contract dispute this would be Steamboat&#x27;s last match of note in WCW in 1989.

=== North American Wrestling Association / South Atlantic Pro Wrestling (1990) ===

After leaving the NWA, Steamboat underwent surgery on his injured foot. Fully recovered, he returned to the ring in February 1990 for the North Carolina–based North American Wrestling Association (later renamed South Atlantic Pro Wrestling in July 1990), where he feuded with Robert Fuller over the NAWA/SAPW Heavyweight Championship, until leaving the promotion in October 1990.

=== New Japan Pro-Wrestling (1990) ===
In September and October 1990, he toured with New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), where he faced high-profile stars like Hiroshi Hase and The Great Muta and teamed up with the likes of Owen Hart, Pegasus Kid, Riki Choshu, Shinya Hashimoto, and Miguel Perez, Jr., and also having matches with aspiring stars Hiro Saito and Takayuki Iizuka.

=== Return to WWF (1991) ===
In 1991, Steamboat would return to the World Wrestling Federation after signing a two-year contract. Billed simply as The Dragon, a series of vignettes began airing in February 1991 that featured him breathing fire. Despite his previous success in the WWF as a one-time Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion, Steamboat was mainly treated as a brand-new wrestler, save for the announcers occasionally making reference to his WrestleMania III match and former title reign. Steamboat&#x27;s first match came on a &quot;Superstars&quot; taping on March 11 in Pensacola, FL when he defeated Jeff Sword. His first televised match was on the March 30 edition of &quot;Superstars&quot; when he defeated the Brooklyn Brawler with his signature diving crossbody. On subsequent episodes of &quot;Superstars&quot; and &quot;Wrestling Challenge&quot;, Steamboat would go on to win numerous squash matches. He would also be victorious on televised Madison Square Garden events, defeating the likes of Haku, Demolition Smash, Paul Roma, Col. Mustafa, Pat Tanaka, and The Warlord.

Steamboat&#x27;s only pay per view appearance during his second WWF tenure was at SummerSlam. Teaming with Kerry Von Erich and Davey Boy Smith against the Warlord, Hercules, and Paul Roma, Steamboat got the victory for his team by pinning Roma.

The Dragon was undefeated on television during his 1991 run and lost only one match, a house show bout against Skinner. The day after his dark match loss, Steamboat gave his notice to WWF management and then quit the company shortly thereafter. He had been booked for the Survivor Series, teaming with Jim Neidhart (who would be replaced by Sgt. Slaughter due to injury), Jim Duggan, and Kerry Von Erich against Col. Mustafa, Skinner, The Berzerker, and Big Bully Busick (who would be replaced by Hercules after Busick left the WWF), but he left before the event and was replaced by Tito Santana. It is rumored that Steamboat was booked to be squashed by The Undertaker on &quot;Superstars&quot; to build Undertaker for his impending WWF Championship match against Hulk Hogan, and that Steamboat chose to quit the WWF rather than lose to Undertaker. Undertaker instead squashed Kerry Von Erich on &quot;Wrestling Challenge&quot; weeks prior to Survivor Series.

During his time in the WWF, Steamboat asked Pat Patterson to work as a heel. Steamboat proposed to fight as a masked heel until somebody would remove his mask, but Patterson said he was a consummate babyface.

=== Return to WCW (1991–1994) ===

==== World Tag Team Champion (1991–1992) ====
In November 1991 at &quot;Clash of the Champions XVII&quot;, Steamboat returned to World Championship Wrestling (WCW) as the surprise tag team partner of Dustin Rhodes, substituting for an injured Barry Windham. Steamboat and Rhodes defeated the Enforcers (Arn Anderson and Larry Zbyszko) to win the World Tag Team Championship, Steamboat&#x27;s first World Tag Team Title under the WCW banner. They lost the titles to Arn Anderson and his new partner Bobby Eaton at a live event in January 1992. Steamboat began feuding with the Dangerous Alliance at this point, facing them in a critically acclaimed WarGames match at WrestleWar, which received a 5-star rating from Dave Meltzer. He unsuccessfully challenged Dangerous Alliance member and United States Heavyweight Champion Rick Rude for the title at SuperBrawl II. Their rivalry culminated in a non-title Iron Man Challenge at Beach Blast, which Steamboat won.

==== World Television Champion (1992–1993) ====
On the September 2, 1992 &quot;Clash of the Champions XX: 20th Anniversary&quot;, Steamboat defeated &quot;Stunning&quot; Steve Austin to win his first Television Championship under the WCW banner. He lost the title to Scott Steiner at a television taping on September 29. He however, won both his first NWA World Tag Team Championship (unrecognized by NWA) and his second WCW World Tag Team Title with Shane Douglas (NWA and WCW titles were unified) on the November 18 &quot;Clash of the Champions XXI&quot; by defeating Barry Windham and Dustin Rhodes. On the March 27, 1993 edition of &quot;Power Hour&quot;, they lost the NWA and WCW titles to The Hollywood Blonds (Brian Pillman and Steve Austin). On the August 18 &quot;Clash of the Champions XXIV&quot;, he defeated Paul Orndorff to win his second and final WCW World Television Championship. In September 1993, at Fall Brawl, Steamboat&#x27;s TV title reign was ended when he lost to Lord Steven Regal. At Starrcade, the two fought in a rematch for the title which resulted in a time-limit draw.

==== United States Heavyweight Champion and retirement (1994) ====
Heading into 1994, Steamboat engaged in one last feud over the WCW World Heavyweight Championship with longtime rival Ric Flair, which culminated in a match in the main event of Spring Stampede where the title was briefly held up due to both men&#x27;s shoulders being pinned at the same time. On the May 14 edition of &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, Flair defeated Steamboat to reclaim possession of the title. Their final singles match was on &quot;Main Event&quot; in July which ended on a disqualification when Steve Austin interfered. Steamboat and Flair&#x27;s last encounter was in a tag team match on the July 31 edition of &quot;Main Event&quot; where Steamboat teamed with Sting against Ric Flair and Steve Austin.

He then feuded with US Champion &quot;Stunning&quot; Steve Austin and earned a US title shot at Bash at the Beach, but lost. On the August 24 &quot;Clash of the Champions XXVIII&quot;, he got a rematch against Austin where Steamboat hurt his back, but managed to pin Austin for the United States Heavyweight Championship. However, he had to give up the belt due to the injury at Fall Brawl; he was replaced by &quot;Hacksaw&quot; Jim Duggan, who made his WCW debut after Duggan left the WWF. The match was started, Duggan defeated Austin to become new United States Heavyweight Champion. In September 1994, Steamboat was fired by WCW President Eric Bischoff via Federal Express package (while injured), thus ending a nearly two decade relationship with the Crockett/Turner wrestling organization.

=== First retirement (1994–2005) ===
After an eight-year retirement, Steamboat played an important role in the genesis of Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), where he was the referee of the first Gauntlet for the Gold for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. He was also the referee for the four-way double-elimination match to crown the first holder of the TNA X Division Championship. He has also made appearances for Ring of Honor where he refereed the first defense of the ROH Pure Wrestling Championship. In 2004, he engaged in a series of confrontations with CM Punk over Punk&#x27;s arrogance in matches Steamboat refereed and then became CM Punk&#x27;s inspiration to become the better person Steamboat knew he could be. The latter part of 2004 saw Steamboat feud with Mick Foley over which style of wrestling was superior, pure wrestling or hardcore wrestling. The two of them had many confrontations and managed teams to face one another, but never had a match against each other. Steamboat&#x27;s last ROH appearance was at Final Battle 2004 where he and Foley finally made peace.

=== Second return to WWE (2005-2014) ===

==== Agent and feud with Chris Jericho (2005–2009) ====
In early 2005, Steamboat returned to WWE as a producer and was introduced as a WWE Legend on the &quot;Homecoming&quot; edition of &quot;Raw&quot; in October 2005. In early 2006, Ricky Steamboat told WWE management that he would like to come out of retirement at WrestleMania 22 and work a match with Ric Flair, but the idea was nixed. Ricky Steamboat has been the special referee in main event matches between John Cena, Triple H, and/or Edge at WWE house shows. In 2006 at the Raw SummerSlam Tour in Sydney, Australia, he was a referee for a match between Cena and Edge for the WWE Championship. He also refereed another title match in July 2007 between John Cena and Randy Orton in Anaheim, California. On April 1, 2007, he made an appearance at WrestleMania 23 while various other legends were having a small dance party in the background. He also briefly appeared at the pay-per-view, being recognized as a former Intercontinental Champion. He made another appearance on WWE television during Ric Flair&#x27;s farewell on the March 31, 2008 edition of &quot;Raw&quot;.
He appeared on the February 23 edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, after being named one of the members of the 2009 WWE Hall of Fame class. However, Steamboat was attacked by Chris Jericho, who began to feud with the Hall of Famers. In his first match in nearly 15 years, Steamboat returned to the ring alongside Piper and Snuka to take on Jericho at WrestleMania 25 on April 5, 2009. While both Snuka and Piper were swiftly eliminated during the match, Steamboat held his own against Jericho, performing his legendary diving crossbody and even a plancha, although Jericho would eventually go on to win the match. After receiving good reviews for his performance, Steamboat was scheduled to face Jericho in another match at Backlash. However, he lost the match after submitting to the Walls of Jericho. From June to August 2009, Steamboat worked in house shows against Chris Jericho, Drew McIntrye, and Sheamus. On August 15, 2009, he teamed up with his son Richie to defeat Hiram Tua and Orlando Colon for World Wrestling Council in Puerto Rico.

==== Later WWE appearances (2010-2014) ====
Steamboat&#x27;s last WWE-related match was teaming with his son Richie, as they defeated Trent Barretta and Caylen Croft at Florida Championship Wrestling&#x27;s Father&#x27;s Day Salute on June 18, 2010.

On June 28, 2010, he returned to &quot;Raw&quot; to promote his new DVD only to be attacked and injured by The Nexus. On WWE&#x27;s website the following day, it was announced that in storyline, Steamboat suffered injuries from the attack. However, on July 1, WWE&#x27;s website announced that the prior night, Steamboat felt legitimate pain in his neck and shoulders and as a result, was now legitimately hospitalized. This caused WWE to take down any storyline information related to that attack. In a 2024 interview for , Steamboat stated that he was in the hospital for three weeks following that injury, due to bleeding between the hemispheres of his brain.
Steamboat worked as an NXT trainer and in the talent relations department with Triple H until the developmental release of his son, Richie Steamboat, in 2013. He later moved on to being an Ambassador.

Steamboat was released by WWE on July 19, 2014.

=== Later appearances (since 2014) ===

On the February 25, 2019, episode of &quot;WWE Raw&quot;, Steamboat along with special guests Shawn Michaels, Kurt Angle and Sting appeared during the main event segment to celebrate the 70th birthday of Ric Flair. However, Flair would be attacked by Batista instead of appearing on screen.

In his first televised appearance on TBS since 1994, Steamboat was the guest timekeeper in a match between Bryan Danielson and Daniel Garcia on the August 17, 2022 edition of &quot;AEW&quot; &quot;Dynamite.&quot;

Steamboat returned to the ring on November 27, 2022, at age 69 for the first time since his last match in 2010. He teamed with FTR (Cash Wheeler and Dax Harwood) as they defeated Nick Aldis, Jay Lethal and Brock Anderson (son of Arn Anderson) at Big Time Wrestling Return of the Dragon in Raleigh, North Carolina.

Steamboat returned to AEW on the August 5, 2023, episode of &quot;AEW Collision&quot; as a special outside enforcer for the &quot;Real World Championship&quot; match between CM Punk and Ricky Starks due to Starks beating Punk by cheating in their previous two matches. After the match, Starks assaulted Steamboat with Steamboat&#x27;s own belt. It was later reported that Steamboat requested that he be beaten down by Starks instead of the planned finish of him chasing Starks away after the match. On the September 2 episode of &quot;Collision&quot;, Steamboat presented a contract for a &quot;Ricky Starks vs. The Dragon&quot; strap match at AEW All Out to Starks. After Starks signed the contract, it was revealed that his opponent would not be Steamboat but &quot;The American Dragon&quot; Bryan Danielson instead. Steamboat joined the broadcast team for the match at All Out to witness Danielson defeating Starks.

Steamboat was guest timekeeper for AEW Revolution in 2024, which was billed as the final match for Steve &quot;Sting&quot; Borden and his tag team partner Darby Allin, who defended the AEW Tag Team Championship against Matthew and Nicholas Jackson, which was held at Greensboro Coliseum.

== In other media ==

<text>Fleshcrawl is a German death metal band formed in Illertissen, Bavaria, in 1987. Their most recent album, &quot;Into the Catacombs of Flesh&quot;, was released in 2019 under Apostasy Records.

== History ==

=== 1987–1997 ===
Fleshcrawl was formed by Stefan Hanus and Bastian Herzog in 1987 under the name Morgöth. In 1990, after original lead vocalist Wendelin Dopfer left the band, Alex Pretzer was signed on, the band changed their name to Suffocation, and released a demo tape called &quot;Festering Flesh&quot;. After the release of their demo tape, the band was forced to change their name because the American band, Suffocation, had released their first vinyl cut earlier. The band was officially renamed to Fleshcrawl and then released their first 7-inch EP &quot;Lost in a Grave&quot; in 1991 through Morbid Records. One of the first shows under the new name took place in their hometown in October 1991. It was a legendary underground concert together with the German bands Dead and R.U.Dead? and Demigod from Finland.

In 1992, Fleshcrawl signed a recording contract with Black Mark Production, and in June 1992, they recorded their debut studio album, &quot;Descend into the Absurd&quot;, at Montezuma Studios, Stockholm. Shortly after the release of &quot;Descend into the Absurd&quot;, Mike Hanus, brother to founding member Stefan Hanus, replaced Gero Schmitt as one of the guitarists, and in 1993, they began recording their second studio album, &quot;Impurity&quot;, at Dan Swanö&#x27;s Unisound Studio.

In 1995, Markus Amann left the band and Mike Hanus took over as the bassist for studio sessions. In December 1995, Fleshcrawl recorded their third studio album, &quot;Bloodsoul&quot;, which was released in 1996. Shortly after the release of &quot;Bloodsoul&quot;, Fleshcrawl began recording their fourth studio album, &quot;Bloodred Massacre&quot;, which was released in 1997 with Sven Gross replacing Alex Pretzer as the lead vocalist. Both albums were recorded at Abyss Studios by Peter Tägtgren of Hypocrisy.

=== 1998–present ===

In 1998, Tobias Schick took over as the new bassist, allowing Mike Hanus to return to playing guitar exclusively. After the release of &quot;Bloodred Massacre&quot;, Fleshcrawl left Black Mark Production and joined a monthlong tour with Kataklysm and Vader, as well as participating in festivals with Cannibal Corpse and Dark Funeral. After returning from their tour, Fleshcrawl signed a recording contract with Metal Blade Records, and in January 2000, they released their fifth studio album, &quot;As Blood Rains from the Sky... We Walk the Path of Endless Fire&quot;, which was produced at Studio Fredman in Gothenburg, Sweden. In June 2000 the band went out to tour Europe again, this time 25 performances with Vader and Vital Remains had been scheduled. Individual shows and various festival appearances followed (among others at the Czech Dynamo Festival and the Summer Breeze Open Air in Bavaria, Germany).

In September 2001, Fleshcrawl began recording their sixth studio album, &quot;Soulskinner&quot; at Studio Underground in Västeras, Sweden. Soulskinner was introduced live on a four-week tour with Bolt Thrower and Benediction in January 2002. In spring 2002, Stefan Hanus left the band for personal reasons. He was replaced by Oliver Grbavac and the band played at Wacken Open Air. In November 2002, Fleshcrawl played their first tour in Japan in support of Hypocrisy.

During 2003, the band played few live shows in order to focus on writing their seventh studio album. In November 2003, Fleshcrawl again entered Studio Underground in Sweden to record their seventh studio album, &quot;Made of Flesh&quot;, which was musically similar to &quot;Soulskinner&quot;. &quot;Made Of Flesh&quot; was released on 23 February 2004 in Europe and Japan and on 9 March 2004 in the United States, and following its release the band played a few shows, including the Summer Breeze Open Air and the Party.San Metal Open Air in Thuringia, Germany. The band also supported &quot;Made of Flesh&quot; by touring with Six Feet Under and Criminal in Europe in February/March 2004.

In 2005, Fleshcrawl released a compilation album, &quot;Crawling in Flesh – The Best of Fleshcrawl&quot;, which featured fifteen tracks from their first 4 full-length albums.

In early 2007, Nico Scheffler replaced Tobias Schick as the band&#x27;s bassist and the band began to work on their eighth studio album, &quot;Structures of Death&quot;. It was released in Europe on 24 September 2007. Following the album&#x27;s release, Fleshcrawl played a few shows around central Europe with bands such as Carnal Forge, Dismember, Enslaved, and Jungle Rot, and also played several metal festivals.

In 2011, bassist Nico Scheffler left Fleshcrawl, but was quickly replaced by Manuel Markowski. The group did not release new music between 2008 and 2015. This was due to various private problems of the musicians and a longer stay abroad by drummer Bastian Herzog. Nevertheless, the band played several individual and festival shows during this time. Just to mention a few notable ones: The SWR Barroselas in Portugal (2008), the German Protzen Open Air, Summer Breeze and Queens of Metal in the same year, Chronical Moshers (2010), Way of Darkness (2011), Stromgitarrenfest III (2012), Rock Hard Festival and Bang Your Head (both in 2013), Baden in Blut (2014) and the Faces of Death in Moscow, Russia (2014). Fleshcrawl also performed a headliner show in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates in March 2012. At the end of 2015, Fleshcrawl and Skinned Alive produced a split CD which included four new songs by the musicians and was initially released by Brutal Art Records, later, in the course of the year 2016, by FDA Rekotz.

In January 2016, the band performed on their first ever Asian tour. They played eight shows in seven different countries – the United Arab Emirates, Nepal, Thailand, Taiwan, Philippines, Singapore and Vietnam. In the course of this, the band was the headliner at the Nepal Deathfest in Kathmandu and co-headliner at a The Exploited show in Singapore. Later in 2016, the band released &quot;Festering Thoughts from a Grave&quot; – a CD re-release of their two demos and the &quot;Lost in a Grave&quot; EP (Raw Skull Recordz).

In 2017 and 2018, the group played concerts and festivals, including appearances at the Schoonebeek Deathfest in the Netherlands (2017), Obscene Extreme in the Czech Republic (2018), Helsinki Deathfest in Finland and Way of Darkness in Germany (both also in 2018). In October 2018, the band split from their longtime guitarist Mike Hanus, who was replaced by Slobodan Stupar. In December, Fleshcrawl performed at the Eindhoven Metal Meeting. In 2019, further individual and festival shows in Central Europe and the UK followed. In May 2019, the group entered North American territory for the very first time to perform at the renowned Maryland Deathfest in Baltimore, US.

Back in Germany, Fleshcrawl completed their work on the long-awaited follow-up to &quot;Structures of Death&quot;. &quot;Into the Catacombs of Flesh&quot; was released by Apostasy Records on 29 November 2019. But already in March 2020 the personnel carousel turned again: Guitarist Slobodan Stupar found his successor in Christian Kalbrecht. Another change of personnel occurred after an almost concertless year (due to COVID-19) in December 2020. Fleshcrawl separated from guitarist Oliver Grbavac and got Apu Justin Reisch on board instead.

On 11 June 2021, vocalist Sven Gross died from cancer at the age of 44. Later in the year, Russian-born vocalist Borisz Sarafutgyinov performed with the band at the Obscene Extreme festival in the Czech Republic. On 15 October, Fleshcrawl officially announced Sarafutgyinov as the official new vocalist of the band.

== Musical style ==
Fleshcrawl, although their overall style has evolved over the years, remains quite similar- and often compared to such Scandinavian/melodic death metal bands as Grave and Dismember. Like these bands, Fleshcrawl creates a familiar, mid-range guitar tone with rapid tempos and short guitar solos consisting of fast, nimble alto-range progressions. However, the band&#x27;s drumwork since the mid-to-late 1990s, composed mainly of high-speed, rolling double-bass drums and blast beats is comparable to that of many brutal death metal bands, such as Nile and Skinless, but at the same time, is down-tuned enough to not lose its kinship with the melodic death metal genre.

Occasionally, they incorporate organs and other instruments, such as trumpets and kettle drums into their music, particularly in their instrumental intros and interludes.

Fleshcrawl&#x27;s lyrical themes are generally characteristic of typical death metal, and encompass such concepts as insanity, horror, doomsday, war, murder, misanthropy, genocide, gore, slavery, and sacrifice, among other lyrical concepts familiar to death metal.

<text>Kenneth Wayne Shamrock (né Kilpatrick; born February 11, 1964) is an American retired professional wrestler and mixed martial artist. He is currently signed to WWE under a Legends contract, under the ring name Ken Shamrock. He is best known for his time in Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), WWE and other combat sports. An inaugural inductee into the UFC Hall of Fame, Shamrock is widely regarded as an icon and pioneer of the sport. He has headlined over 15 main events and co-main events in the UFC and Pride FC and set numerous MMA pay-per-view records. In the early part of his UFC career, Shamrock was named &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Dangerous Man&quot; by ABC News in a special called &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Dangerous Things&quot;. The moniker has stuck as his nickname.

Shamrock became known early on in the UFC for his rivalry with Royce Gracie. After fighting to a draw in the inaugural UFC &quot;Superfight&quot;, he became the first UFC Superfight Champion when he defeated Dan Severn at UFC 6; the title was eventually replaced by the UFC Heavyweight Championship when weight categories were introduced to the UFC. He was also the first foreign MMA champion in Japan, winning the King of Pancrase Openweight title. During his reign as the UFC Superfight Champion, he was widely considered the #1 mixed martial artist in the world, and in 2008, Shamrock was ranked by Inside MMA as one of the top 10 greatest mixed martial arts fighters of all time. He is the founder of the Lion&#x27;s Den mixed martial arts training camp, and is the older brother of fellow fighter Frank Shamrock.

In addition to his mixed martial arts career, Shamrock has had considerable success in professional wrestling, particularly during his tenure with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). There, he is a one-time Intercontinental Champion, a one-time World Tag Team Champion and the 1998 King of the Ring. Shamrock also wrestled for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, where he is a one-time NWA World Heavyweight Champion – the first world champion under the TNA banner – and a 2020 inductee in the Impact Hall of Fame. He headlined multiple pay-per-view events in both promotions, including 1997&#x27;s D-Generation X: In Your House, where he challenged for the WWF Championship. Additionally, Shamrock was also one of the first wrestlers to use the shoot style of wrestling in America, being credited by WWE with popularizing the legitimate ankle lock submission hold.

==Early life==
A &quot;military brat,&quot; Kenneth Wayne Kilpatrick was born at the Robins Air Force Base, in Warner Robins, Georgia on February 11, 1964,&lt;ref name=&quot;ericuribe.com/2012/10/04/ken-shamorck&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; where he lived for his first four years. His father, Richard Kilpatrick, was a United States Air Force enlistee, and his mother, Diane Kilpatrick, was a waitress and dancer who had her first son when she was 15. Kilpatrick had three brothers and grew up at a predominantly black neighborhood of Atlanta, Georgia.

Kilpatrick was often left to fend for himself, and, without his parents&#x27; supervision or guidance, got into many fights. His father abandoned his family when Kilpatrick was five. His mother married an Army aviator named Bob Nance, and the newly formed family moved to Napa, California, Nance&#x27;s hometown. Kilpatrick and his brothers were outsiders in this community, coming from a poor background and speaking in a Southern accent. They continued to cause trouble and get into fights and began using drugs. Nance, who fought in the Vietnam War, joined the local fire department and also worked in roofing and upholstery. Kilpatrick became involved in and excelled at sports at a young age, playing in Little League baseball and Pop Warner football. Nance remembered a veteran coach telling him that he had never seen a player with as much heart and tenacity as the young Kilpatrick. Kilpatrick was not as involved with drugs as his brothers, such as his brother Richie, who enjoyed smoking marijuana and eventually using heroin intravenously, but who also played football.

At age 10, Kilpatrick ran away from home for the first time, and was stabbed by another child on the run, ending up in the hospital. When he was 13, his stepfather kicked him out of their home, and each of the brothers went their own ways. Kilpatrick lived in stolen cars and would often rob people at knifepoint as a means to survive, before being placed in a foster home. Kilpatrick went through seven group homes and served time in a juvenile hall. He moved between several more group homes before being placed in Bob Shamrock&#x27;s Boys&#x27; Home in Susanville, California at age 14, where he turned his life around. Bob Shamrock legally adopted Ken as his son, and Ken changed his last name from Kilpatrick to Shamrock in Bob&#x27;s honor.

At Lassen High School, Shamrock (known there as Kenny Nance) excelled in football and wrestling. Shamrock credits organized sports, as well as his adoptive father, Bob, for his life turning around. As a senior, he qualified for the state championships in wrestling, but broke his neck in practice days before the competition and underwent neck surgery. Due to the injury, he received no scholarship offers from any big colleges, and doctors told him his sports career was likely over. Against doctors&#x27; orders, he joined the Shasta College football team, where he was voted team captain in his final season. The San Diego Chargers of the National Football League later offered him a tryout, but he declined in order to pursue a career in professional wrestling, where he debuted in 1989 in the North Carolina–based South Atlantic Pro Wrestling promotion.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early career (1988–1993)===
In 1988, Shamrock trained as a professional wrestler under Buzz Sawyer, Nelson Royal, and Gene Anderson. He debuted in 1989 in Royal&#x27;s North Carolina–based Atlantic Coast Wrestling promotion under the ring name Wayne Shamrock. After ACW folded, he moved on to the George Scott/Paul Jones-run company South Atlantic Pro Wrestling (which initially promoted under the banner of the North American Wrestling Association) and changed his ring name to Vince Torelli. Later he adopted the nickname &quot;Mr. Wrestling&quot; and a more villainous persona.

===Japan (1990–1993)===
In June 1990, after being inspired by Dean Malenko, Shamrock applied for the American tryouts of Japanese Universal Wrestling Federation in Florida. As it was a shoot style promotion, where real strikes and holds were used, Shamrock was put to spar legitimately against other participants, among them Bart Vale. After passing another tryout in Japan, he was eventually accepted, and in October he had his debut match in UWF, wrestling under the name of &quot;Wayne Shamrock&quot; and defeating Yoji Anjo. He became instantly popular and was put on a match against Masakatsu Funaki next. UWF folded shortly after, and Shamrock followed Funaki and other wrestlers to its successor promotion, Pro Wrestling Fujiwara Gumi, led by Yoshiaki Fujiwara.

Even though he had not started his mixed martial arts career yet, Shamrock had his first fighting experience in Fujiwara Gumi, as the results of many matches were chosen by having the wrestlers partake in competitive grappling at the gym. He had his first high level bout with Duane Koslowski, Dennis Koslowski&#x27;s twin brother and a 1988 Summer Olympics Greco-Roman wrestler, whom Shamrock submitted twice before working their actual match. A different situation happened with Kazuo Takahashi, as he broke the script and shot on Shamrock in their November 1991 match, leading the American to fight back and knock him out with a soccer kick to the face at 1:27. They wrestled a rematch in 1992, with both wrestlers working heavily stiff, though with no more incidents. Shamrock himself praised Takahashi as a wrestler, comparing him to himself.

===World Wrestling Federation (1997-1999)===

====Various feuds (1997–1998)====
Shamrock made his WWF debut as a face on the February 24, 1997, episode of &quot;Monday Night Raw,&quot; the same episode of Raw where ECW promoted their first pay-per-view Barely Legal 1997. On March 23, 1997, Shamrock, identified as Ken Shamrock and billed as &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Dangerous Man&quot;—a name given to him by ABC News—refereed a submission match between Bret Hart and Steve Austin at WrestleMania 13.

Shamrock returned to the ring following WrestleMania, squashing Vernon White (one of his Lion&#x27;s Den students) in his debut WWF match. He went on to feud with Vader, Bret Hart, and The Hart Foundation throughout 1997. Shamrock&#x27;s feud with Vader continued in Japan, through a working agreement between the WWF and FMW, Shamrock wrestled Vader in an Ultimate Rules Steel Cage match for FMW&#x27;s Kawasaki Legend 1997 super show featuring 4 other promotions. The match ended in a TKO win for Vader as Shamrock was suffering from internal bleeding from a lung infection and a rib injury.

Shamrock&#x27;s rivalry with the Harts led to his first WWF pay-per-view main event at In Your House 16: Canadian Stampede and culminated in a bout between him and The British Bulldog for the European Championship at SummerSlam which Shamrock lost by disqualification after hitting the Bulldog with a can of dog food. Shamrock went on to wrestle Bret Hart to a no-contest in a match for the latter&#x27;s WWF Championship on the edition of October 21 of &quot;Raw&quot;. He again challenged for the WWF Championship in the main event of December&#x27;s D-Generation X: In Your House, defeating champion Shawn Michaels by disqualification when Triple H interfered.

Throughout early 1998, Shamrock feuded with The Rock and his Nation of Domination stable over Rock&#x27;s Intercontinental Championship. On January 18 at Royal Rumble, during a match the referee Mike Chioda was distracted by The Rock&#x27;s team Nation of Domination when The Rock&#x27;s teammate D&#x27;Lo Brown&#x27;s foot was stuck in the ropes, before The Rock used brass knuckles to hit him. He then disposed of the brass knuckles inside his trunks behind the referee&#x27;s back. Shamrock was originally set to win the match and defeat The Rock. The Rock appealed to Chioda who discovered the foreign object. Shamrock objected to using the brass knuckles to Chioda before Chioda reversed the decision and took the Intercontinental Championship belt from Shamrock and gave it back to The Rock, making The Rock the winner via disqualification. After the match, Shamrock attacked Chioda for taking the Intercontinental Championship belt from him. Two months later on March 29 at WrestleMania XIV, Shamrock originally defeated The Rock, though the decision was reversed when Shamrock continued to apply his ankle lock after The Rock had submitted, and The Rock was declared the winner by disqualification.

In June 1998, Shamrock competed in the 1998 King of the Ring tournament, eliminating Nation members Mark Henry, Kama and The Rock, as well as Jeff Jarrett, to win the tournament. Following the King of the Ring, Shamrock feuded briefly with the returning King Mabel, who had interfered to attack him in a rematch with Jarrett, and whom Shamrock defeated in a singles match injuring his leg. He next feuded with Owen Hart: Hart defeated Shamrock in a &quot;Hart Family Dungeon match&quot; at Fully Loaded, and Shamrock defeated Hart in a &quot;Lion&#x27;s Den match&quot; at SummerSlam. In September, he formed a short-lived stable with Mankind and The Rock.

====The Corporation and The Union (1998–1999)====

Shamrock turned heel in October 1998 and won the vacant Intercontinental Championship on the October 12 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, defeating X-Pac in the finals of an eight-man tournament. Shamrock retained the title in his first title defense against Mankind, six days later at Judgment Day: In Your House. In November, Shamrock participated in the Deadly Games tournament for the vacant WWF Championship at Survivor Series. He defeated Goldust in the first round, before losing to eventual winner The Rock in the quarterfinals. The following night, on &quot;Raw is War&quot; Shamrock joined Mr. McMahon&#x27;s Corporation after McMahon offered him &quot;a family&quot; in exchange for his services. Shamrock successfully defended the Intercontinental Championship against Steve Blackman at Capital Carnage.

In December, Shamrock and his Corporation teammate Big Boss Man began pursuing the WWF Tag Team Championship, unsuccessfully challenging rival faction D-Generation X (DX) members New Age Outlaws (Billy Gunn and Road Dogg) for the titles at Rock Bottom: In Your House. However, the following night, on the December 14 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, Shamrock and Boss Man defeated New Age Outlaws for the Tag Team Championship, making Shamrock a dual champion. On the January 11, 1999 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, Shamrock&#x27;s kayfabe sister, Ryan made her WWF debut, with both Billy Gunn and Val Venis making overtures to her. It led to a match between Shamrock and Gunn for the Intercontinental Championship at Royal Rumble. Shamrock retained the title. The following night, on the January 25 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, Shamrock and Boss Man lost the Tag Team Championship to Jeff Jarrett and Owen Hart.

Val Venis continued to flirt with Ryan, leading to Shamrock defending the Intercontinental Championship against Venis at St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre, with Billy Gunn as the guest referee. Shamrock lost the match after Ryan slapped him and Gunn delivered a fast count. Shortly after losing the title, Shamrock also began feuding with Goldust, who also began flirting with Ryan. This led to Shamrock competing in a four way match for the Intercontinental Championship at WrestleMania XV. The reigning champion Road Dogg, was able to retain his title by pinning Goldust after Shamrock and Venis were counted out while brawling outside the ring.

In early mid-1999, the Corporation began feuding with The Undertaker and his Ministry of Darkness, with The Undertaker&#x27;s minions repeatedly ambushing Shamrock and kidnapping Ryan, sacrificing her on The Undertaker&#x27;s symbol. After breaking away from the Corporation, thus turning face once more, Shamrock went on to feud with The Undertaker at and lost.

After losing to The Undertaker, Shamrock, Big Show, Mankind and Test formed The Union, a stable of wrestlers in opposition to the Corporate Ministry. The Union dissolved soon after defeating the Corporate Ministry at Over the Edge in May. Shamrock briefly feuded with Jeff Jarrett before beginning a rivalry with martial artist Steve Blackman that saw he and Blackman fight one another in a series of unorthodox matches. The feud ended at SummerSlam, where Shamrock defeated Blackman in a &quot;Lion&#x27;s Den weapons match&quot;. He went on to feud with the newly debuted Chris Jericho until departing the WWF in late 1999 in order to resume his mixed martial arts career. His departure was attributed on screen to an injury inflicted by Jericho&#x27;s bodyguard, Mr. Hughes.

However, during his 2024 interview with Chris Van Vliet, Shamrock revealed the reason he left WWF at the time was that he was uncomfortable with the incest storyline, which included Alicia Webb, who debuted using Shamrock&#x27;s real life son&#x27;s name as a part of Webb&#x27;s ring name, and stated that the Montreal Screwjob Incident that caused his mentor Bret Hart to leave WWF hurt his career, as Hart was the person who helped him get into the wrestling business along with his character gimmick. Shamrock also stated that he had no creative direction by WWE due to them not knowing what to do with him.

===Return to Japan (2000)===
Shamrock made a one-night return on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2000 teaming with UFC fighter Don Frye losing to Keiji Muto and Nobuhiko Takada at Inoki Bom-Ba-Ye in Osaka, Japan.

===Independent circuit (2002, 2004, 2009, 2013)===
Shamrock returned to professional wrestling in March 2002, refereeing a Ring of Honor match between Bryan Danielson and Low Ki.

Then on February 20, 2004, Shamrock defeated Sylvester Terkay in a double disqualification at Ultimate Pro Wrestling. A couple of weeks later he fought Shinsuke Nakamura to a draw at Inoki Dojo in Hollywood, California.

Shamrock made an appearance in the independent Wrestling company Juggalo Championship Wrestling during their flagship annual event, Bloodymania III, defeating Jimmy Jacobs with Dan Severn as the special guest referee.

In December 2013 at &quot;Amo del Hexagono&quot; in Costa Rica, he made his return by attacking Carlito and challenging him to a match.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2002)===
In May 2002, Shamrock signed a one-year deal with the newly formed Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) promotion. On the inaugural TNA pay-per-view on June 19, Shamrock won the vacant NWA World Heavyweight Championship in a Gauntlet for the Gold match and is recognized as TNA&#x27;s first ever World Champion. After feuding with Malice for several weeks, Shamrock left TNA shortly after losing the title to Ron Killings on August 7.

===New Japan Pro-Wrestling (2003–2004, 2022)===
Shamrock made two appearances for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) between 2003 and 2004. He defeated Takashi Iizuka at NJPW Ultimate Crush II in May 2003. He then lost to Josh Barnett by disqualification at NJPW Nexess.

Shamrock made a special return to NJPW on October 27, 2022, at Rumble on 44th Street, escorting Clark Connors to the ring for his match against Minoru Suzuki, in which Suzuki was victorious. After the match, Suzuki and Shamrock stared off, hinting a brawl, however both instead embraced in the ring.

===Return to TNA (2004)===
Shamrock briefly returned to TNA in July 2004. In his return, he only wrestled twice: for the NWA Heavyweight Championship in a gauntlet match, and an eight-man guitar-on-a-pole match. In both matches, he was unsuccessful in winning. Shamrock then departed TNA again shortly after the latter match.

===Return to the independent circuit (2018–2019)===
Shamrock returned to professional wrestling on November 30, 2018, for Battle Championship Wrestling in Melbourne, Australia. He defeated BCW Tag Team Champion Gabriel Wolfe in a singles match before teaming with Carlo Cannon in an impromptu BCW Tag Team Championship match against Wolfe and Big Cuz, in which Shamrock and Cannon were successful in capturing the BCW tag team titles. These matches were Shamrock&#x27;s first since 2009 and his first championship since the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in the summer of 2002. They would go on to hold the titles for nine months to the day losing them to The Preston Kindred (Jonathan Preston &amp; Sean Preston).

===Second return to Impact Wrestling (2019–2021)===
In August 2019, it was announced that Shamrock would be returning to TNA, now known as Impact Wrestling, for the first time since 2004. He returned at the September 5 &quot;Impact!&quot; TV taping in Las Vegas, Nevada, and furthered his feud with Moose that began over social media. Shamrock faced Moose at the 2019 Bound for Glory event in a losing effort. On the October 29 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Shamrock was challenged to a match by Joey Ryan. The following week, Shamrock defeated Ryan, winning his first match since 2002. In February 2020, he was inducted into the Impact Hall of Fame. On March 17, ICU interrupted Shamrock&#x27;s interview with Josh Mathews. The mysterious figure threw a fireball into Shamrock&#x27;s eyes. He took off the mask and it was revealed to be Sami Callihan. Callihan would take his phone and the lights would go off and he would disappear. The feud would culminate at Rebellion 2020 Night 1 in an Unsanctioned match, where Shamrock submitted Callihan to an ankle lock. Ken Shamrock turned heel when he aligned himself with Sami Callihan and attacked Eddie Edwards before leaving the promotion once more.

===Battleground Championship Wrestling (2022)===
Shamrock returned for a one-night appearance for Battleground Championship Wrestling in Philadelphia on August 6, 2022, defeating Davey Boy Smith&#x27;s son Harry Smith.

===Return to WWE (2024-present)===
Shamrock had announced that he re-signed with the now-renamed WWE on September 19, 2024 under a Legends Contract during his interview with Chris Van Vliet.

==Mixed martial arts career==
===Background===
The origins of Shamrock&#x27;s professional fighting career began while working as a bouncer in college and the early years of his professional wrestling career in North Carolina. He made money by winning Toughman Contests and street fights. Shamrock later joined the shoot-style Japanese pro wrestling organization Fujiwara Gumi. On October 4, 1992, at the Tokyo Dome, a legitimate match between &quot;Wayne Shamrock&quot; (Shamrock&#x27;s ring name in Japan) and kickboxer Don Nakaya Nielsen took place. Shamrock submitted Nielsen in 45 seconds, first threatening him with a rear naked choke and then locking a neck crank/keylock combination for the win. The success of this match made young professional wrestlers Shamrock, Masakatsu Funaki and Minoru Suzuki question what they had been told since entering into predetermined wrestling: that nobody would ever pay to see real matches. Funaki and Suzuki then founded a group of professional wrestlers and decided to pursue marketable legitimate matches. The two formed the pioneering mixed martial arts (MMA) promotion called Pancrase, which Shamrock later joined.

===Pancrase Hybrid Wrestling (1993–1996)===
Shamrock made his mixed martial arts debut at Pancrase on September 21. Using professional wrestling rules—no closed fisted punching to the head and breaks on the ropes—but fighting for real without predetermined finishes, Shamrock beat Funaki by arm-triangle choke in the main event of the first Pancrase show on September 21, 1993. Shamrock considered this a big victory, as it had been the first time he beat Funaki in all his time as Funaki&#x27;s apprentice, and the show attracted a sell-out audience of 7,000.

He followed up with victories over Yoshiki Takahashi, Takaku Fuke and Andre Van Den Oetelaar, and was slated to fight co-founder Minoru Suzuki on January 19, 1994. According to Shamrock, he was asked by Pancrase management not to injure Suzuki during the match, as the Japanese was already affected by a back injury. However, during the match Suzuki refused to release a kneebar after Shamrock had grabbed the ropes to escape, which injured the American&#x27;s leg and forced him to forfeit the fight. The incident angered Shamrock, but there were no consequences.

His ninth match, against Matt Hume, would be a controversial one too. The bout was finished by Shamrock performing a professional wrestling northern lights suplex floated over into a Kimura lock and was widely considered to be a worked shoot. When Shamrock was asked about the matter in 1998, he revealed that Hume and him had agreed to work the match in an exhibition format. Later, in 2015, he would answer to a similar question: &quot;I talked to Matt and I said that we would go in with each other but I wouldn&#x27;t hurt him. I wouldn&#x27;t hurt him, because he had been so green. [...] So those were understandings I had with guys because I was so much better than they were. And I&#x27;m not going to go in there and abuse these guys.&quot;

He defeated world kickboxing champion Maurice Smith and Alex Cook in the opening round of the 16-man and Masakatsu Funaki and Manabu Yamada in the to become the first King of Pancrase in December 1994. With this win, Shamrock became the first ever foreign champion in MMA history in Japan. He then defended his King of Pancrase title against Bas Rutten in 1995, submitting him with a kneebar. He lost the title in his next fight against Pancrase co-creator, Minoru Suzuki.

In addition to his MMA bouts in Pancrase, Shamrock also competed in a kickboxing match in 1994 with Dutch champion Frank &quot;The Animal&quot; Lobman, who holds a pro record of 110-6 with a 90% KO ratio. The American had only rudimentary striking experience, but he took the fight expecting it to help him to work on proper kickboxing. Shamrock broke Lobman&#x27;s nose with a right cross early in the bout but was ultimately defeated by TKO due to leg kicks.

Shamrock eventually had a falling out with Pancrase management in early 1996 and left the company to compete in the UFC full-time. Shamrock left Pancrase with a record of 17–3.

===Ultimate Fighting Championship (1993–1996)===

====Ken Shamrock vs. Royce Gracie - the first UFC rivalry====
From there he went to the newly formed Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), a fighting tournament that would take place in America. Although Shamrock initially believed it to be a professional wrestling event, he decided to sign up nonetheless, supported by Pancrase members Masakatsu Funaki and Takaku Fuke. The event, &quot;UFC 1&quot;, was held under a one-night tournament format, but Shamrock only realized it would be real fighting after watching Gerard Gordeau knock out Teila Tuli in the first bout.

In the first round, Shamrock was pitted against kickboxing stylist Patrick Smith, who he made short work of by throwing Smith to the mat and submitting him with a heel hook. His next opponent was Brazilian jiu-jitsu exponent and eventual tournament winner Royce Gracie. Shamrock sprawled a takedown and manoeuvred on top of Gracie, but the latter escaped from under his mount attempt and returned to his feet. The Brazilian then pulled guard, so the American grabbed his ankle and sat back to attempt another heel hook. According to Shamrock, however, Gracie had wrapped his gi around Shamrock&#x27;s arm, and when the latter sat back, it pulled Gracie on top of him. With his arm still entangled, the American could not apply his leglock, which Gracie capitalized on to secure a choke with his free hand and submit Shamrock. While the move is often listed as a rear naked choke, Shamrock later stated it to be actually a gi choke, as Royce had wrapped the cloth of his gi around Ken&#x27;s neck. The ending of the fight was also controversial, as the referee did not see the tap and ordered the two fighters to continue fighting after Gracie had let go of the hold. Shamrock paused for a few seconds but declined, admitting to the ref that he tapped out and that it would not be fair for him to continue fighting.

After the fight, Shamrock admitted that he had underestimated Gracie. In 2008 he said: &quot;I didn&#x27;t know who Royce Gracie was... When I saw him in his gi, I thought he was some karate guy [with no grappling skills].&quot; On the other hand, in 2015 Shamrock said he had watched the &quot;Gracie Jiu-Jitsu: In Action&quot; before the event and showed it to Funaki and the rest: &quot;So one thing led to another, they started to support me on it- they did know that that gi meant a lot- but when they saw it too they thought &quot;Yeah, you&#x27;ll be able to beat this guy pretty well.&quot; And I had confidence, too.&quot; Anyway, he put the blame of his loss in the fact that he wasn&#x27;t allowed to wear wrestling shoes during the fights, while Gracie himself had been allowed to wear his gi and choke Shamrock with it. &quot;[Wearing shoes] is a lot of the set ups and the positions for my leglocks- being able to get my knee inside, being able to spin and push off, and being able to secure the leg. You take the shoes off, it&#x27;s like being on ice on the mat if you&#x27;ve never done it before.&quot;
Shamrock was originally scheduled to compete at &quot;UFC 2&quot; but broke his hand after blocking a high kick while sparring with a teammate. He still wanted to compete, but when doctors told him that he might never fight again if he injured his hand any further, he reluctantly withdrew.

On September 9, 1994, Shamrock returned to the octagon at &quot;UFC 3&quot; in an event that was marketed by the UFC as the ultimate rematch between two-time champion Royce Gracie and #1 contender Shamrock. Shamrock&#x27;s first fight, now wearing better shoes, was against top ranked judo practitioner Christophe Leininger. Shamrock&#x27;s next fight was in the semifinals against kickboxer Felix Mitchell. Shamrock defeated Mitchell with the popularized rear naked choke. With this win, Shamrock advanced to the finals of &quot;UFC 3&quot;. However, Shamrock refused to compete in the finals after he learned Gracie had dropped out of the tournament after his win over Kimo Leopoldo, combined with a knee injury he suffered during his match with Leininger.

On April 5, 1995, at &quot;UFC 5&quot;, Shamrock got his rematch with Gracie in a match called &quot;The Superfight,&quot; which would determine the UFC Champion. At the time, Gracie had a reputation as being seemingly unbeatable. Gracie came into the octagon at 190 pounds, while Shamrock cut his weight down to 205 pounds for the bout. Mere hours before the event, the UFC suddenly instituted a 30-minute time limit, mainly due to pay per view time constraints. Both Gracie and Shamrock were upset at the sudden rule change. Shamrock and Gracie fought for the entire allotted time of 30 minutes along with 5 minutes of overtime before the match was declared a draw. Had there been ringside judges, UFC matchmaker Art Davie believes that Shamrock would have been declared the winner. Gracie left with a melon sized welt closing his eye, a result of a standing punch due to a sudden change of the rules in which both of the fighters were restarted on their feet. Shamrock was not satisfied with his performance against Gracie, saying &quot;it&#x27;s certainly not a win. You gain nothing (with a draw)&quot;. Shamrock expressed desire to fight Gracie again for a third time in 1996, saying that if it went to a draw again, he would have Gracie declared the winner and Shamrock would forfeit his UFC Superfight Championship belt to Gracie.

====UFC Superfight Champion====
Shamrock was then matched up with &quot;UFC 5&quot; tournament champion Dan Severn at &quot;UFC 6&quot; on July 14, 1995, to determine the reigning champion of the UFC. The &quot;superfight&quot;, a match presented as a fight between the &quot;best of the best&quot;, was still the match that would determine the UFC champion and the tournament winner would be considered the #1 contender for the newly created UFC Superfight Championship (later replaced by the UFC Heavyweight Championship when weight categories were introduced to the UFC). Their feud began at the pre-fight press conference. After most of the attention from the media was given to Shamrock, Severn got up and walked out of the door without explanation. Shamrock took Severn&#x27;s action as a sign of disrespect. Severn later said that he walked out because he felt that it would be unfair to Shamrock for him to be present in the room while Shamrock was discussing his fight strategy to the media. Shamrock became even more furious when he found a newsletter back at the hotel that explained to readers how Severn was going to destroy Shamrock. During the match, Shamrock forced Severn to tap out to a choke in 2:14 to win the UFC Superfight Championship.

On September 8, 1995, at &quot;UFC 7&quot;, Shamrock successfully defended the UFC Superfight Championship against UFC 6 Tournament Champion &quot;The Russian Bear&quot; Oleg Taktarov. Shamrock stated in his autobiography that he was uncomfortable fighting Taktarov, as Oleg trained with the Lion&#x27;s Den and he did not wish to injure his friend and teammate. In &quot;Beyond the Lion&#x27;s Den&quot;, Shamrock states; &quot;In addition to being his friend, I was also trying to get him into Pancrase and if I broke his leg it would be a while before he could recover and he needed the money. I figured my best chance of winning without seriously hurting him was to beat on him with punches... If I could open a cut and get him to start pouring blood, I could get a referee stoppage. It might not have been the best plan going into a fight, but considering the options it seemed like the best option available. And it turned out fine. I battered him around for the duration of the match, the bout was declared a draw and when Oleg recovered he went on to fight in Pancrase.&quot;

Shamrock then defended his belt against Kimo Leopoldo at &quot;UFC 8&quot; in February 1996 in Puerto Rico. In the bout, Shamrock secured a kneebar, forcing Kimo to submit. With the win, Shamrock defended his UFC Superfight title for the second time.

====The Dance in Detroit====
Shamrock was then scheduled to face number one contender and rival Dan Severn at &quot;UFC 9&quot; in a rematch of their fight at &quot;UFC 6&quot;, which Shamrock won by guillotine choke in 2:14. Their rematch at UFC 9 was marketed as the &quot;Clash of the Titans 2&quot; and took place in the Cobo Arena in Detroit, Michigan, in Severn&#x27;s home state.

UFC owner Bob Meyrowitz, referee John McCarthy and a team of lawyers were in court until 4:30 p.m. on the day of the fight battling with the District Attorney of Michigan, who was trying to prevent the UFC from holding the event in the state. An ultimatum was issued: the fight could go on as long as there were no closed fisted strikes to the head and no headbutts. The UFC, desperate to put the show on, agreed to the terms. Fighters were warned hours before the show that they would be arrested if they punched to the head with a closed fist. When Shamrock learned of the sudden rule change, he made up his mind that he was not going to fight. While training for the match, Shamrock suffered a torn lateral meniscus, a partially torn ACL, a broken nose, and cracked ribs. His injuries, combined with the rule change, meant he did not think he could win the fight because all of his weapons were taken away from him. Shamrock was also fearful that he would be arrested; the troubled boys from his father&#x27;s foster home would be watching him and he was afraid of setting a bad example. If Shamrock withdrew, the main event would have been cancelled and the UFC could have suffered substantial monetary damage. After UFC owner Bob Meyrowitz and other UFC officials pleaded with Shamrock to go on with the show, Shamrock, despite the injuries and new rules, reluctantly gave in to the pressure.

In a fight that would be called &quot;The Dance in Detroit&quot;, both Severn and Shamrock circled each other with little to no contact for a combined total of almost thirty minutes. &quot;I took the center of the ring understanding that I was going to be fighting for my life and Dan never came at me,&quot; Shamrock said. Severn later said that his strategy was purposely not to engage with Shamrock and wait for the fans to boo, hoping that the booing would affect Shamrock psychologically and force him to make a mistake that Severn could capitalize on. Finally, after over 15 minutes of stalling, Severn shot for a takedown, but was unsuccessful and following a brief scramble, Shamrock put Severn on his back in full mount. Shamrock held the mount for close to five minutes, throwing open fist palm strikes to Severn&#x27;s head and an occasional closed fist punch to the body. Shamrock felt as though he would have damaged Severn badly and perhaps finished him from this position of full mount had he been allowed to punch Severn in the face with a closed fist. Severn eventually gave his back in an attempt to get out and the risk paid off as Shamrock slid off Severn&#x27;s back and onto his back in full guard. Severn landed a headbutt to open a cut above Shamrock&#x27;s eye and followed with elbow strikes and punches from Shamrock&#x27;s guard. Shamrock eventually got back to his feet and after six more minutes stalling, the fight went to a judges&#x27; decision. The judges gave a split decision win to Dan Severn, which upset Shamrock because he felt as though Severn had broken the rules by utilizing the banned closed fist punches to the head and headbutts. Chants of &quot;boring!&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s go Red Wings!&quot; were echoed throughout the arena during the fight. Shamrock later stated that going through with this fight was the biggest regret of his fighting career.

After taking time off away from the octagon to heal injuries, Shamrock entered the UFC&#x27;s Ultimate Ultimate 1996 in December 1996. Shamrock appeared as a guest on the mainstream American television program &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; to promote the event. Frank Shamrock served as Ken&#x27;s head cornerman for the event. Shamrock&#x27;s opponent in the quarterfinals of the tournament was Judo black belt, kickboxer, and Golden Gloves champion Brian Johnston. Shamrock eventually tapped Johnston out with a forearm choke and advanced to the semifinals of the tournament. Shamrock, however, broke the same hand during this fight that kept him out of &quot;UFC 2&quot; and had to withdraw from the tournament. If Ken Shamrock was not injured, he would have faced Tank Abbott in the semifinals and more than likely would have defeated Tank to then go on to the finals of the tournament and face Don Frye. Betting odds had Ken Shamrock as a huge favorite to beat Don Frye in the finals and win the whole one night Ultimate Ultimate 1996 tournament.

After &quot;UFC 9&quot;, United States Senator John McCain was successful in pulling UFC pay-per-view broadcasts from numerous cable systems, including TCI Cable, which greatly hurt pay-per-view revenue. Combined with money drying out, the need to support his family and being burnt out from fighting, Shamrock left MMA for professional wrestling signing with the World Wrestling Federation.

===Pride Fighting Championships (2000–2002, 2005)===
====Pride Grand Prix 2000====
On January 30, 2000, at the Pride Grand Prix 2000 Opening Round, Guy Mezger, one of Shamrock&#x27;s fighters, fought Kazushi Sakuraba, who at the time was considered to be one of the best pound for pound fighters in the world. Mezger took the fight on two weeks&#x27; notice and had a broken foot going into the fight. The contract that Mezger signed stipulated that the fight would be one 15-minute round with no overtime. The fight mostly consisted of Mezger controlling the fight by stopping Sakuraba&#x27;s takedown attempts while landing strikes from the outside. The round ended and Mezger expected the fight to go to the judges, but Pride officials wanted the fight to go to overtime.

According to Mezger, Pride did not like the outcome of the fight and changed the agreement/contract on the spot in order to give Sakuraba another chance to win the fight. Ken Shamrock, Mezger&#x27;s corner man, entered the ring and an argument ensued. Mezger was then ordered out of the ring and back to the locker room by Shamrock, who was livid at the decision to extend the fight because of Mezger&#x27;s foot injury and the fact that he had taken the fight on short notice.

Mezger said, &quot;For some reason, I had a tremendous amount of energy for that 15 minutes, but I started to kind of wilt near the end. Then they called it a draw and I&#x27;m like, &quot;What?&quot; Everyone blames Ken for being unprofessional. Really, Ken was protecting his fighter. We had an agreement. Sakuraba said, &quot;I wanted to go another round, thinking it would be possible to salvage the match, but when it was decided to extend the fight, Ken Shamrock was making scary faces. Later I heard that Mezger&#x27;s contract was only for a one-round fight. I thought, &quot;Ah, then it couldn&#x27;t be helped.&quot; But Shamrock didn&#x27;t have to get so angry like that. Seeing Mezger getting scolded by him, I felt sorry for (Mezger).&quot;

Later that night, the president of Pride FC made a public apology to Mezger at the Tokyo Dome for the miscommunication. Braverman added, &quot;We had a big meeting (with PRIDE). We were able to get some concessions out of them, money and guarantees of future fights. They wanted to make it right. One thing I said in the meeting was, &quot;Do you want me to call Kenny back in here and see what he says?&quot; &quot;No, no, no, no!&quot;

In early 2000, Shamrock made a comeback to the mixed martial arts scene following his 4-year hiatus in the WWF. Ken Shamrock was supposed to face Josh Barnett at SuperBrawl 16 February 8, 2000, but withdrew due to pay issues, Shamrock was the favorite to win the bout and was replaced by former fellow UFC Superfight Champion Dan Severn, He signed with Pride Fighting Championships and defeated Alexander Otsuka by KO due to punches at the Pride Grand Prix 2000 Finals in the superfight, his first fight back from the WWF. During the match Shamrock was able to totally knock out the tough Otsuka, a feat which renowned strikers like Igor Vovchanchyn and Wanderlei Silva failed to do. This was the first ever Pride event to be broadcast live in America and Pride strategically used Shamrock&#x27;s drawing power in America by making his Superfight with Otsuka the co-headliner of the event.

====Heavyweight division====
On August 27, 2000, Shamrock fought consensus top 10 Heavyweight &quot;Ironhead&quot; Kazuyuki Fujita at Pride 10 - Return of the Warriors. Shamrock came into the fight with Fujita noticeably smaller than his previous fight with Otsuka, dropping roughly 15 pounds of weight. During the time before the fight, Shamrock was going through a divorce and had to take care of his young kids during the day, which severely cut into his training time for the fight. Despite this, Shamrock dominated Fujita throughout the entire fight, stopping takedowns from the Japanese wrestling champion and landing hard strikes, but eventually had his corner throw in the towel because he felt like he was having a heart attack. He was evaluated after the fight and it was determined that he was suffering from heart palpitations.

In March 2001, Shamrock was scheduled to fight Igor Vovchanchyn at Pride 13 - Collision Course, but re-injured his neck during training two weeks before the fight, the same serious neck injury that ended his WWF career.

Shamrock engaged in a feud with Don Frye during his career in the Pride Fighting Championships, whose background was Don Frye&#x27;s trash talking. In 1999, Alicia Webb (also known as Ryan Shamrock) dated Ken Shamrock until early 2003. Frye made comments to the effect that Shamrock cheated on and divorced his wife to date a young girl (Alicia Webb was 19 and Ken Shamrock was 35 when they started dating). Frye also joked that Ken&#x27;s (at the time) estranged father Bob and brother Frank would be in Frye&#x27;s corner for the fight. Ken Shamrock was enraged by Frye&#x27;s trash talk, causing a feud between Shamrock and Frye. Since then, Frye has stated that he only resorted to personal trash talk to make Ken want to fight him. Frye said: &quot;I saw Ken Shamrock whoop him (Dan Severn) at UFC 6 and I thought, &quot;That&#x27;s a guy I gotta fight. Anybody who can whoop Dan Severn like that has gotta be a man and I want to test my size against his size. I had the chance to talk trash and they gave me the fight; I crossed the line. I wasn&#x27;t professional about it, but Ken was and after the fight, we shook hands and went our separate ways.&quot;

The feud ended on February 24, 2002, at Pride 19, where Shamrock fought Frye in the main event in a match that potentially had PRIDE Heavyweight Championship title implications (PRIDE FC considered giving the winner of this fight a title shot against Pride heavyweight champion Antônio Rodrigo Nogueira). Frye got the edge on a series of clinch battles, while Shamrock dropped down for an ankle lock and transitioned into both a kneebar and a toehold, wrenching Frye&#x27;s leg badly; however, despite the damage, Frye refused to tap out and managed to knock Shamrock down in a subsequent punching exchange. The bout moved to the mat, where Shamrock attempted another ankle lock, only for Frye to try to counter with one of his own and finally refusing to tap out by sheer will until the time ran out. Frye won the fight via spit decision, and the two hugged after the fight ended, putting an end to their rivalry.

====Fight against Kazushi Sakuraba====
In October 2005, Shamrock lost to Kazushi Sakuraba in &quot;Pride: Fully Loaded&quot; by TKO. Three minutes into the bout, Sakuraba struck through Shamrock&#x27;s guard with a left hand. Shamrock staggered back and ultimately fell into the ropes, his head hanging out of the ring and his back turned to Sakuraba. Sakuraba rushed in to follow up, but before any meaningful offense could be launched, the fight was halted by referee Yuji Shimada. Shamrock got up following the KO and protested vigorously. Opinions were mixed regarding the KO&#x27;s legitimacy, though Ken&#x27;s adopted brother and rival, Frank, stated to believe the stoppage was justified.

===Return to the UFC (2002–2006)===

====Feud with Tito Ortiz====

A feud between Shamrock&#x27;s Lion&#x27;s Den camp and Tito Ortiz began to build on January 8, 1999, at &quot;UFC 18&quot;. After upsetting top UFC fighter and Lion&#x27;s Den member Jerry Bohlander, Ortiz mimicked shooting at Shamrock and put on a shirt in the octagon which read &quot;I just f**ked your ass&quot;.

On March 5, 1999, at &quot;UFC 19&quot;, after Ortiz won by referee stoppage in his rematch with Guy Mezger, he immediately flipped off the Lion&#x27;s Den corner and then put on a shirt that said &quot;Gay Mezger is my Bitch&quot;. After Shamrock saw the shirt, he yelled into the octagon &quot;Hey Tito, don&#x27;t let me see you wearing that shirt!&quot;. Shamrock leaped onto the top of the cage, screaming at Ortiz and angrily waving his finger in Ortiz&#x27;s face. Referee John McCarthy picked Ortiz up and carried him across the octagon to prevent the situation from escalating further. The situation was escalated to the point that police and security had to be called in to monitor the situation.

On November 22, 2002, at &quot;UFC 40&quot;, nearly four years after the confrontation at &quot;UFC 19&quot;, Shamrock returned to the UFC to fight Ortiz in a title match for the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship. Shamrock&#x27;s apparent size advantage did not factor into the fight, however; Shamrock experienced difficulty cutting weight for the first time and cut too much weight, weighing in at 201 lbs, 4 lbs under the 205 lb. limit. Ortiz shed light upon his feelings before the fight in his book &quot;This is Gonna Hurt: The Life of a Mixed Martial Arts Champion&quot;; &quot;Ken Shamrock is a real good fighter. I was not intimidated by him, but I guess you can say I was a little bit afraid.&quot;

The match garnered mainstream attention from media outlets such as ESPN and &quot;USA Today&quot;. UFC President Dana White credited Shamrock for the show&#x27;s success. White said, &quot;the reason we did so well on UFC 40 was because of Ken Shamrock and the fact that everyone knew who he was.&quot; Shamrock briefly buckled Ortiz to his knees with a punch, however Ortiz would go on to control most of the bout with his wrestling and ground and pound, causing Shamrock&#x27;s corner to throw in the towel before the fourth round.

After the fight was over, Shamrock revealed that he fought Ortiz with a torn ACL. He also seriously contemplated retirement from MMA, citing the fact that he had never lost two fights in a row in his career before and he had a buildup of injuries. In 2003, Shamrock had surgery to repair his ACL. Shamrock has said that since his knee injury, he has had difficulty shooting and taking people down, which resulted in Shamrock changing his primary style from a wrestler/grappler and moving more towards a standup fighter.

====UFC Hall of Famer====
On November 21, 2003, at &quot;UFC 45&quot;, Royce Gracie and Shamrock became the first inductees to the UFC Hall of Fame. UFC President Dana White said, &quot;We feel that no two individuals are more deserving than Royce and Ken to be the charter members. Their contributions to our sport, both inside and outside the Octagon, may never be equaled.&quot;

At &quot;UFC 48&quot; on June 19, 2004, a 40-year-old Shamrock returned to fight the Kimo Leopoldo in a rematch of the &quot;UFC 8&quot; Superfight Championship match, which Shamrock had won via submission due to a kneebar. The rematch saw Shamrock once again win, this time by way of KO. Shamrock injured his shoulder during the fight against Kimo. He originally thought it was just &quot;wear and tear&quot;, but an MRI revealed a torn rotator cuff. Shamrock then had to have surgery to repair it.

On April 9, 2005, at &quot;The Ultimate Fighter&quot; finale Shamrock faced Rich Franklin. Shamrock applied a heel hook early in the fight that put Franklin on crutches for a week, but Franklin escaped and defeated Shamrock by a TKO.

====The &quot;Ultimate Fighter&quot;: Season 3====
On November 19, 2005, at &quot;UFC 56&quot;, Dana White, the UFC president, announced that Shamrock would be one of the coaches (along with Tito Ortiz) for the upcoming third season of The Ultimate Fighter.

Shamrock was portrayed badly on the show, feuding with his fighters and often appearing uninterested. Shamrock admitted to doing a poor job with his fighters: &quot;I failed them miserably, completely. So I have to figure out a way to get this...back in the driver&#x27;s seat&quot;, Shamrock said during the show. Shamrock responded to his critics in an interview: &quot;I trained three fighters that were the first three (UFC) Middleweight Champions: Jerry Bohlander, Guy Mezger and Frank Shamrock. And I&#x27;ve trained dozens of guys to be champs in other organizations. In Pancrase, I had eight fighters in the top ten at one point. I was the champion and (Masakatsu) Funaki was the number one contender. The rest were all Lion&#x27;s Den fighters. My reputation doesn&#x27;t have to be spoken for or defended. The UFC and Spike TV did what they thought they needed to do for ratings, but in the end, my fans, my family and my God know exactly who I am.&quot;

On July 8, 2006, at &quot;UFC 61&quot;, the rematch between Shamrock and Ortiz took place. Shamrock lost the rematch with Ortiz in 1:18 of the first round by a technical knockout. During the match, referee Herb Dean deemed that Shamrock was no longer able to intelligently defend himself and stopped the fight. Shamrock and the crowd were furious at the early stoppage and Dana White immediately put together a rematch on television.

At &quot;Ortiz vs. Shamrock 3: The Final Chapter&quot; on October 10, 2006, Shamrock was defeated again by Ortiz by KO after referee John McCarthy stopped the fight following multiple undefended fist strikes. Immediately after the fight, Ortiz initially celebrated his victory with a mocking &quot;grave digger&quot; routine and a T-shirt that said, &quot;Punishing Him Into Retirement&quot; after giving him the finger. However, Shamrock approached Ortiz and, after the two talked for several seconds, Shamrock said they could put all of their animosity aside as it was always &quot;just business&quot;, shaking hands and burying the hatchet. UFC President Dana White said the day after Shamrock&#x27;s fight with Ortiz, &quot;Last night was a turning point for the UFC. This will further drive the evolution of mixed martial arts into a mainstream sport.&quot;

Shamrock was rumored to fight Englishman Steve McDonald at &quot;UFC 75&quot;, but he was ultimately released from his UFC contract in June 2007. Shamrock stated that the UFC released him solely because of his decision to coach in the International Fight League. Shamrock then engaged in a feud with White in the media and ultimately sued the UFC for breach of contract, citing that he had one fight left on his deal that the UFC had to honor. Shamrock ultimately lost his suit against the UFC and was ordered by the court to pay Zuffa&#x27;s attorney fees, totaling $175,000.

===Post-UFC career (2007–2019)===
====Various promotions====
In early 2007, Shamrock became the coach of the Nevada Lions for the International Fight League (IFL). Roy Nelson, one of Shamrock&#x27;s fighters, was the reigning IFL Heavyweight Champion when the league was bought out and disbanded.

On March 8 at the &quot;Cage Rage 25&quot;, Shamrock fought Robert Berry, but lost in the first round by Technical knockout due to punches. It was announced on August 25 that Shamrock&#x27;s next opponent would be Kimbo Slice at &quot;Elite XC Saturday Night Fight Special&quot; on October 4, 2008. Shamrock, however, was injured before the match and could not compete for at least 45 days.

Ken Shamrock Productions co-promoted an event with War Gods on February 13, 2009, in which Ken fought in the main event against 6&#x27;6, 380 lb. Ross Clifton. Shamrock knocked Clifton down with a right hand and finished him via arm bar from side control in the first round. Shamrock was then scheduled to fight Bobby Lashley, but tested positive for steroids after the Clifton fight and received a one-year suspension. Shamrock&#x27;s attorney and former manager Rod Donohoo said Shamrock adamantly denied the allegations.

Shamrock faced Pedro Rizzo on July 18, 2010, at an event called &quot;Impact Fighting Championships&quot; in Sydney, Australia. Shamrock lost by TKO due to leg kicks. His next fight was against Johnathan Ivey for the USA MMA promotion on October 16, 2010. Shamrock earned a unanimous decision against Ivey, with all three judges scoring the bout 30-27. He then fought Mike Bourke on November 25, 2010, in Durban, South Africa for the King of the Cage promotion. Shamrock knocked Bourke down with a punch but was injured shortly after during a scramble and subsequently lost the bout via TKO (injury) in the first round, as he was unable to continue due to a leg injury.

Shamrock was scheduled to face Antony Rea at &quot;WEF 46&quot; on April 22, 2011. Ken withdrew from the fight with Rea due to a staph infection. Shamrock was also planning on returning to MMA to take on Ian Freeman for &#x27;The Legends World Title&#x27; on July 27 at the Keepmoat Stadium in Doncaster, England. The fight with Freeman was cancelled due to contractual issues on Shamrock&#x27;s part.

On January 8, 2015, Shamrock announced that he would fight James Quinn in the United Kingdom in a Bare Knuckle Boxing match. The match was set for April 2015, but never took place.

====Bellator MMA====
On February 27, 2015, during &quot;Bellator 134&quot;, it was announced that Ken would return to fight Kimbo Slice at Bellator 138 on June 19, 2015. During the fight, Shamrock had managed to take Slice down twice and the second time establish a rear naked choke. Slice refused to tap, however, and eventually wriggled free from the submission and was able catch Shamrock with one of his trademark powerful right hooks resulting in a TKO loss for Shamrock at 2:22 in the first round. The fight was controversial with many believing Ken took a dive.

At Bellator 145, it was announced that Shamrock would face rival Royce Gracie in a trilogy fight on February 19, 2016, at Bellator 149, almost 21 years after their most recent fight. Gracie won the bout via TKO in round one after taking Shamrock down and battering him with hammerfists. Though there was controversy, as replays showed Gracie kneeing Shamrock in the groin before taking him down. On March 11, 2016, it was revealed by Texas Combat Sports commission that Shamrock had failed his pre-fight drug test. His licence to fight was revoked.

====Retirement====
In July, 2019 via his Facebook page, Shamrock, aged 55, announced that he has &quot;no plans to fight again.&quot; However in March, 2023 Shamrock confirmed he was only retired in MMA, not professional wrestling.

===Criticism of later career===
Shamrock has been criticized by some in the MMA media for fighting too far past his prime. Jeremy Botter of Heavy.com wrote: &quot;Ken Shamrock used to be the baddest man on the planet. In the early days of mixed martial arts, it was tough to find anybody who inspired more fear than Shamrock. His muscled and ripped frame...his intensity was unequaled in the sport at the time, and his bag of submissions made him a very real threat to any opponent he faced during those early years. But those early years were a long time ago, and Shamrock is no longer even a shell of the man he once was.&quot;

After the &quot;Impact FC 2&quot; show, Dave Meltzer wrote: &quot;Impact Fighting Championship&#x27;s pay-per-view show from Sydney was a sad reminder of what the future may hold for many of today&#x27;s top stars. Ken Shamrock, Carlos Newton, Murilo Bustamante, Pedro Rizzo and Josh Barnett were all at various points either UFC champions or groomed to be top stars. But there they were, on the other side of the world, fighting before quiet, small crowds in an atmosphere that hardly felt like they were part of a booming sport.&quot;

Dana White said in 2008; &quot;Ken Shamrock was in a beef with us over his contract. We thought he retired, he was claiming he didn&#x27;t and still had one fight. And my attitude was, I&#x27;d rather pay Ken Shamrock to not fight. I&#x27;d rather pay him to not fight and just say, &quot;stay home, Ken&quot;. Ken is &quot;way&quot; past his prime, it gets to the point where it&#x27;s dangerous for that guy to still be fighting.&quot; WWE announcer Jim Ross said before Shamrock&#x27;s scheduled fight with Bobby Lashley in early 2009; &quot;There was a time that I could see the veteran, 45-year-old Shamrock, a former WWE superstar, schooling the MMA rookie Lashley but that ship has long since sailed. I have great respect for Ken but he&#x27;s outstayed his welcome in the octagon, cage, whatever and needs to teach and coach and stop fighting...Kenny is fighting for one more pay day while Lashley is fighting to help establish what he hopes will be a long term, lucrative, MMA career.&quot;

In Dan Wetzel&#x27;s eulogy for Kimbo Slice, he described Slice&#x27;s opponent Shamrock as a &quot;tomato can&quot; in their scheduled October 2008 fight.

===Fighting style===
Shamrock&#x27;s fighting style has varied over the course of his career. During Shamrock&#x27;s prime, he was known as an explosive grappler with speed, power, agility, and physical strength. Fighter Mike Ciesnolevicz called Shamrock &quot;out of this world strong&quot;, and added &quot;I was in awe of his strength, it was definitely something I will not forget.&quot; Bob Shamrock, who ran a troubled boys youth home and eventually adopted Ken as his son, said, &quot;I have had over 900 young men live with me in the past 30 years and I have never seen anyone with (Ken&#x27;s) athletic ability.&quot; Shamrock learned the art of shoot wrestling primarily from Masakatsu Funaki in Japan and used this style during his fights in the 1990s.

In 2000, after Shamrock&#x27;s three-year absence from MMA while he was participating in professional wrestling with the WWF, Shamrock returned to MMA showcasing a vastly different style of fighting. Shamrock sustained a large amount of injuries during his WWF career, including a serious neck injury and several knee injuries. Shamrock has stated that his knee injuries caused him difficulty in shooting and taking people down, which caused him to shift his style towards striking and abandon his grappling pedigree.

==Promoting career==
=== Valor Bare Knuckle (2019–present) ===
In July 2019, Shamrock announced he would begin his own bare-knuckle boxing promotion called &quot;Valor&quot;. The inaugural bare-knuckle event was held in New Town, North Dakota, on September 21, 2019, featuring several UFC veterans.

==Personal life==
Shamrock is of Irish descent. Shamrock and his adopted brother Frank Shamrock had an estranged relationship. Ken has claimed that Frank mistreated their foster father Bob, while Frank claims that the reason for the fallout with Ken is due to his feeling that Ken was trying to keep Frank&#x27;s career from progressing. Frank asserts that he and Ken have never been close and that his attempts to mend their relationship were rejected by Ken. However, as noted in Frank&#x27;s 2013 Spike TV documentary, &quot;Bound by Blood,&quot; Ken and Frank have reconciled. On January 14, 2010, Frank and Ken Shamrock&#x27;s adoptive father, Bob Shamrock, died due to health complications from diabetes.

Shamrock has been married twice. His first marriage to Tina Ramirez ended in divorce in early 2004. Together they have four children: Ryan Robert (born November 24, 1988), Connor Kenneth (born September 26, 1991), Sean Garret (born June 15, 1993) and one daughter, Fallon Marie (born July 12, 1996). In 2005, Shamrock married a woman named Tonya whom he had known since childhood. He is now the stepfather to her three children. In total, Shamrock has seven children and seventeen grandchildren.

In August 2012, Shamrock was investigated for assault at a mall in Modesto, California. According to a report, Shamrock intervened when he saw two people involved in a fight, and when he went to break it up, a female jumped on Shamrock&#x27;s back and attempted to choke him. Shamrock threw her to the ground, with the force of the impact when she landed knocking her unconscious. Shamrock said he mistook her for a male, and would not have acted so aggressively had he realized she was a woman. No charges were filed as the Modesto police determined Shamrock acted in self defense.

==Other media==
Shamrock had appeared in numerous video games: &quot;WCW vs. the World&quot;, &quot;WWF War Zone&quot;, &quot;WWF Attitude&quot;, &quot;WWF WrestleMania 2000&quot;, &quot;WWF SmackDown!&quot;, &quot;WWF SmackDown! 2: Know Your Role&quot; (Hidden character), &quot;WWF No Mercy&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;EA Sports MMA&quot;, &quot;WWE &#x27;13&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K16&quot; and &quot;WWE 2K24&quot;.

Shamrock was later the star of a low-budget martial arts film in 1997 called &quot;Champions&quot; alongside Danny Trejo.

Shamrock released his book, &quot;Inside The Lion&#x27;s Den&quot;, on March 15, 1998.

In 1999, Shamrock appeared in an episode of Walker, Texas Ranger as a prisoner who was involved in an illegal fighting ring staged by the prison guards and warden.

Shamrock also appeared in episode 15 of the first season of &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; as a professional wrestler, alongside fellow WWE wrestler Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson.

As part of the UFC, he appeared as a cage fighter in the 1995 movie &quot;Virtuosity&quot;, starring Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe.

<text>The history of the U.S. state of Minnesota is shaped by its original Native American residents, European exploration and settlement, and the emergence of industries made possible by the state&#x27;s natural resources. Early economic growth was based on fur trading, logging, milling and farming, and later through railroads and iron mining.

The earliest known settlers followed herds of large game to the region during the last glacial period. They preceded the Anishinaabe, the Dakota, and other Native American inhabitants. Fur traders from France arrived during the 17th century. Europeans moving west during the 19th century drove out most of the Native Americans. Fort Snelling, built to protect United States territorial interests, brought early settlers to the future state. They used Saint Anthony Falls to power sawmills in the area that became Minneapolis, while others settled downriver in the area that became Saint Paul.

Minnesota&#x27;s legal identity was created as the Minnesota Territory in 1849, and it became the 32nd U.S. state on May 11, 1858. After the chaos of the American Civil War and the Dakota War of 1862 ended, the state&#x27;s economy grew when its timber and agriculture resources were developed. Railroads attracted immigrants, established the farm economy, and brought goods to market. The power provided by St. Anthony Falls spurred the growth of Minneapolis, and the innovative milling methods gave it the title of the &quot;milling capital of the world&quot;.

New industry came from iron ore, discovered in the north, mined relatively easily from open pits, and shipped to Great Lakes steel mills from the ports at Duluth and Two Harbors. Economic development and social changes led to an expanded role for state government and a population shift from rural areas to cities. The Great Depression brought layoffs in mining and tension in labor relations, but New Deal programs helped the state. After World War II, Minnesota became known for technology, fueled by early computer companies Sperry Rand, Control Data, and Cray. The Twin Cities also became a regional center for the arts, with cultural institutions such as the Guthrie Theater, Minnesota Orchestra, and Walker Art Center.

==Native American inhabitation==
=== Prehistory ===
The oldest known human remains in Minnesota, dating back about 9,000 years ago, were discovered near Browns Valley in 1933. &quot;Browns Valley Man&quot; was found with tools of the Clovis and Folsom types. Some of the earliest evidence of a sustained presence in the area comes from a site known as Bradbury Brook near Mille Lacs Lake which was used around 7500 BC. Subsequently, extensive trading networks developed in the region. The body of an early resident known as &quot;Minnesota Woman&quot; was discovered in 1931 in Otter Tail County. Radiocarbon dating places the age of the bones approximately 8000 years ago, approximately 7890 ±70 BP or near the end of the Eastern Archaic period. She had a conch shell from a snail species known as &quot;Busycon perversa&quot;, which had previously only been known to exist in Florida.

Several hundred years later, the climate of Minnesota warmed significantly. As large animals such as mammoths became extinct, native people changed their diet. They gathered nuts, berries, and vegetables, and they hunted smaller animals such as deer, bison, and birds. The stone tools found from this era became smaller and more specialized to use these new food sources. They also devised new techniques for catching fish, such as fish hooks, nets, and harpoons. Around 5000 BC, people on the shores of Lake Superior (in Minnesota and portions of what is now Michigan, Wisconsin, and Canada) were the first on the continent to begin making metal tools. Pieces of ore with high concentrations of copper were initially pounded into a rough shape, heated to reduce brittleness, pounded again to refine the shape, and reheated. Edges could be made sharp enough to be useful as knives or spear points.

=== Ancient history ===

Archaeological evidence of Native American presence dates between 2,500 and 5,000 years ago at the Jeffers Petroglyphs site in southwest Minnesota. The exposed Sioux Quartzite rock is dotted with several thousand petroglyphs thought to date to the Late Archaic Period (3000 BC to 1000 BC). Around 700 BC, burial mounds were first created, and the practice continued until the arrival of Europeans, when 10,000 to 11,000 such mounds dotted the state. The Hopewell burial mounds in Saint Paul are protected from invasive modern tourism.

Archaeologists believe native peoples discovered the catlinite deposit at Pipestone over 3,000 years ago. Word of its existence spread and a quarry developed that was sacred ground to the native peoples across a vast area. When the French Voyageurs arrived in the region in the 1600s they learned of the quarry in their bartering with the indigenous peoples. In 1858, the same year Minnesota became a state, the Yankton Sioux Tribe signed the Yankton Treaty in which they gave up their lands in western Minnesota and South Dakota. However, section 8 of the treaty gave the Yankton nation a one-mile square reservation at the quarry site. In 1893 the site was sold to the US Government and in 1937 FDR signed the bill creating the Pipestone National Monument. Today the quarry remains active and is restricted exclusively to Native Americans by treaty with the National Park Service. At present there are 23 tribal nations affiliated by treaty to the Monument based upon their historic ties with Pipestone.

By AD 800, wild rice became a staple crop in the region, and corn farther to the south. Within a few hundred years, the Mississippian culture reached into the southeast portion of the state, and large villages were formed. The Dakota Native American culture may have descended from some of the peoples of the Mississippian culture.

=== European colonization ===
When Europeans first started exploring Minnesota, the region was inhabited primarily by tribes of Dakota, with the Ojibwa (sometimes called Chippewa, or Anishinaabe) beginning to migrate westward into the state around 1700. (Other sources suggest the Ojibwe reached Minnesota by 1620 or earlier.) The economy of these tribes was chiefly based on hunter-gatherer activities. There was also a small group of Ho-Chunk (Winnebago) Native Americans near Long Prairie, who later moved to a reservation in Blue Earth County in 1855.

At some early point, the Missouria moved south into what is now Missouri, the Menominee ceded much of their westernmost lands and withdrew closer to the region of Green Bay, Wisconsin, and the A&#x27;ani were pushed north and west by the Dakota and split into the Gros Ventre and the Arapaho. Later tribes who would inhabit the region include the Assiniboine, who split from the Dakota and returned to Minnesota, but later also moved west as American settlers came to populate the region.

The word Minnesota comes from the Dakota phrase &quot;Mni Sóta Makoce&quot;, which is depicted on the state seal.

==European exploration==

=== 17th century ===
In the late 1650s, Pierre Esprit Radisson and Médard des Groseilliers, while following the southern shore of Lake Superior (which would become northern Wisconsin), were probably the first Europeans to meet Dakota Native Americans . The north shore of the lake was explored in the 1660s. Among the first to do this was Claude Allouez, a missionary on Madeline Island. He made an early map of the area in 1671.

Around this time, the Ojibwa Native Americans reached Minnesota as part of a westward migration. Having come from a region around Maine, they had experience dealing with European traders. They sold furs and purchased guns. Tensions rose between the Ojibwa and Dakota in the ensuing years.

In 1671, France signed a treaty with a number of tribes to allow trade. Shortly thereafter, French trader Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut, arrived in the area and began trading with the local tribes. Du Lhut explored the western area of Lake Superior, near his namesake, the city of Duluth, and areas south of there. He helped to arrange a peace treaty between the Dakota and Ojibwa tribes in 1679.
Father Louis Hennepin, with companions Michel Aco and Antoine Auguelle (a.k.a. Picard Du Gay), headed north from the area of modern Illinois after coming into that area with an exploration party headed by René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle. They were captured by a Dakota tribe in 1680. While with the tribe, they came across and named the Falls of Saint Anthony. Soon, Du Lhut was able to obtain through negotiation the release of Hennepin&#x27;s party. Hennepin returned to Europe and wrote a book, &quot;Description of Louisiana&quot;, published in 1683, about his travels; many portions, including the part about Saint Anthony Falls, were strongly embellished. As an example, he described the falls as having a drop of 50 to 60 feet (15–18 m), when they were really only about . Pierre-Charles Le Sueur explored the Minnesota River to the Blue Earth area around 1700. He thought the blue earth was a source of copper, and he told stories about the possibility of mineral wealth, but there actually was no copper in it.

=== 18th century ===
Explorers searching for the fabled Northwest Passage and large inland seas in North America continued to pass through the state. In 1721, the French built Fort Beauharnois on Lake Pepin. In 1731, the Grand Portage trail was first traversed by a European, Pierre La Vérendrye. He used a map written down on a piece of birch bark by Ochagach, an Assiniboine guide. The North West Company, which traded in fur and competed with the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, was established along the Grand Portage in 1783–1784.

Jonathan Carver, a shoemaker from Massachusetts, visited the area in 1767 as part of another expedition. He and the rest of the exploration party were only able to stay for a relatively short period, due to a lack of supplies. They headed back east to Fort Michilimackinac, where Carver wrote journals about the trip, though others would later claim the stories were largely plagiarized. The stories were published in 1778, but Carver died before the book earned him much money. Carver County and Carver&#x27;s Cave (Wakan Tipi) are named for him.

=== 19th century ===
In 1817, Major Stephen Harriman Long headed a military excursion up the Mississippi River to the Falls of St. Anthony near the confluence with the Minnesota River. As a result of his recommendations, the Army established Fort Snelling to guard against Indian incursions against settlers in the Upper Mississippi Valley. Long recorded his experiences of the expedition in a journal, which was first published as &quot;Voyage in a Six-Oared Skiff to the Falls of St. Anthony&quot;, by the Minnesota Historical Society in 1860.

In 1822 the Earl of Selkirk acquired a controlling interest in the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. Through the Company he acquired of land that today (2021) make up Manitoba and the northern portions of North Dakota and Minnesota. Until 1818 the Red River Valley was considered part of British North America, and several colonization plans were mounted to the region, such as the Red River Colony. The boundary where the Red River crossed the 49th parallel was not marked until 1823, when Long returned to the region to conduct another survey expedition. When several hundred settlers abandoned the Red River Colony in the 1820s, they entered United States territory along the Red River Valley, going south to Fort Snelling. The region had been occupied by Métis people, the children of voyageurs and Native Americans, since the middle of the 17th century.

Several efforts were made to find the source of the Mississippi River. The true source was found in 1832 when Henry Schoolcraft was guided by a group of Ojibwa headed by &quot;Ozaawindib&quot; (&quot;Yellow Head&quot;) to a lake in northern Minnesota. Schoolcraft named it Lake Itasca, combining the Latin words &quot;veritas (&quot;truth&quot;) and caput&quot; (&quot;head&quot;). The native name for the lake was &quot;Omashkooz&quot;, meaning elk. Other explorers of the area include Zebulon Pike in 1806, Major Stephen Long in 1817, and George William Featherstonhaugh in 1835. Featherstonhaugh conducted a geological survey of the Minnesota River Valley and wrote an account, entitled &quot;A Canoe Voyage up the Minnay Sotor&quot;.

Joseph Nicollet scouted the area in the late 1830s, exploring and mapping the Upper Mississippi River basin, the St. Croix River, and the land between the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers. He and John C. Frémont left their mark in the southwest part of the state, carving their names in the pipestone quarries near Winnewissa Falls (an area now part of Pipestone National Monument, in Pipestone County).

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow never explored the state, but he did help to make it popular. In 1855 he published &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot;, which contains references to many places in Minnesota. The story is based on Ojibwa legends carried back east by other explorers and traders (particularly those collected by Henry Rowe Schoolcraft).

==Territorial foundation and settlement==
===Land acquisition===

All of the land east of the Mississippi River was granted to the United States by the Second Treaty of Paris, which in 1783 ended the American Revolution. This included what would become modern-day Saint Paul but only part of Minneapolis, along with the northeast, north-central, and east-central portions of the future state. The western portion of the state was part of Spanish Louisiana since the Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762). The wording of the treaty in the Minnesota area depended on landmarks reported by fur traders, who erroneously reported an &quot;Isle Phelipeaux&quot; in Lake Superior, a &quot;Long Lake&quot; west of the island, and the belief that the Mississippi River ran well into modern Canada. Most of the state—the area west of the Mississippi—was purchased in 1803 from France as part of the Louisiana Purchase. Parts of northern Minnesota were considered to be in Rupert&#x27;s Land. The exact definition of the boundary between Minnesota and British North America was not addressed until the Anglo-American Convention of 1818, which set the U.S.–Canada border at the 49th parallel west of the Lake of the Woods (except for a small chunk of land now dubbed the Northwest Angle). Border disputes east of Lake of the Woods continued until the Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842.

During the first half of the 19th century, the northeastern portion of the state was a part of the Northwest Territory, then the Illinois Territory, then the Michigan Territory, and finally the Wisconsin Territory. The western and southern areas of the state, although theoretically part of the Wisconsin Territory from its creation in 1836, were not formally organized until 1838, when they became part of the Iowa Territory. 

===Establishment of Fort Snelling, Minneapolis and Saint Paul===


Fort Snelling was the first U.S. military post in the state. The land for the fort encompassed the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi rivers and was acquired in 1805 by Lt. Zebulon Pike. When concerns mounted about the fur trade in the area, construction of the fort began in 1819, and was completed in 1825, named after Colonel Josiah Snelling.

Slaves Dred Scott and his wife were taken to the fort by their master, John Emerson. They lived at the fort and elsewhere in territories where slavery was prohibited. After Emerson&#x27;s death, the Scotts argued that since they had lived in free territory, they were no longer slaves. The U.S. Supreme Court sided against the Scotts in &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot;. Dred Scott Field, located just a short distance away in Bloomington, is named in memory of Fort Snelling&#x27;s significance in one of the most important legal decisions in U.S. history.

By 1851, treaties between Native American tribes and the U.S. government had opened much of Minnesota to settlement, so Fort Snelling no longer was a frontier outpost. It served as a training center for soldiers during the American Civil War and later as the headquarters for the Department of Dakota. A portion has been designated as Fort Snelling National Cemetery where over 160,000 are interred. During World War II, the fort served as a training center for nearly 300,000 inductees. Fort Snelling is now a historic site operated by the Minnesota Historical Society.

Fort Snelling was largely responsible for the establishment of the city of Minneapolis. The fort garrison built roads, planted crops, and built a grist mill and a sawmill at Saint Anthony Falls. Later, Franklin Steele came to Fort Snelling as the post sutler. He established interests in lumbering and operated the ferries serving the fort from St. Paul and Mendota. When the Ojibwe signed a treaty ceding lands in 1837, Steele staked a claim to land on the east side of the Mississippi River adjacent to Saint Anthony Falls. In 1848, he built a sawmill at the falls, and the community of Saint Anthony developed along the east side of the falls. Steele told one of his employees, John H. Stevens, that land on the west side of the falls would make a good site for future mills. Since the land on the west side was still part of the military reservation, Stevens made a deal with Fort Snelling&#x27;s commander. Stevens would provide free ferry service across the river in exchange for a tract of at the head of the falls. Stevens received the claim and built a house, the first house in Minneapolis, in 1850. In 1854, Stevens platted the city of Minneapolis on the west bank. Later, in 1872, Minneapolis absorbed the city of Saint Anthony.

The city of Saint Paul, Minnesota is also a Fort Snelling development. Squatters, mostly from the ill-fated Red River Colony in what is now Manitoba, established a camp near the fort. The commandant of Fort Snelling, Major Joseph Plympton, found their presence problematic because they were using resources that the fort required; timber, firewood and grazing lands around the fort. Plympton banned lumbering and evicted the squatters from the military reservation. As a result, they moved four miles downstream on the Mississippi River to Fountain cave. This location was not quite far enough for Plympton, so the squatters were forced out again. Pierre &quot;Pig&#x27;s Eye&quot; Parrant, established a moonshine trade there with both the soldiers and Sioux. The settlement got the name &quot;Pig&#x27;s Eye&quot; when a customer at Parrant&#x27;s tavern wrote a letter with &quot;Pig&#x27;s Eye&quot; as the return address. The reply to that letter was delivered directly to the settlement. In 1840, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Dubuque sent Father Lucien Galtier as a missionary to the settlement. Galtier built a small log church and dedicated it to Saint Paul. The nearby steamboat landing took on the name &quot;St. Paul&#x27;s Landing&quot;, and by 1846, when a post office was opened, the area was known as St. Paul. Before white settlement, the Mdewakanton Sioux knew the area as &quot;Im-in-i-ja Ska&quot;, meaning &quot;White Rock&quot;, which describes the sandstone bluffs adjacent to Carver&#x27;s Cave.

Minneapolis and Saint Paul are collectively known as the Twin Cities. Minneapolis is the largest city in Minnesota, with a population of 429,954 in the 2020 census. Saint Paul is smaller with a population of 311,527 in 2020. Minneapolis-Saint Paul are the core of the MPLS metropolitan area with a population of 3,690,261 as of 2020, with a total state population of 5,706,494.

===Early European settlement and development===
Henry Hastings Sibley built the first stone house in the Minnesota Territory in Mendota in 1838, along with other limestone buildings used by the American Fur Company, which bought animal pelts at that location from 1825 to 1853. Another area of early economic development in Minnesota was the logging industry. Loggers found the white pine especially valuable, and it was plentiful in the northeastern section of the state and in the St. Croix River valley. Before railroads, lumbermen relied mostly on river transportation to bring logs to market, which made Minnesota&#x27;s timber resources attractive. Towns like Pine City, Marine on St. Croix and Stillwater became important lumber centers fed by the St. Croix River, while Winona became an important lumber market because of its proximity to farms that were developing in the south of the state. The unregulated logging practices of the time and a severe drought took their toll in 1894, when the Great Hinckley Fire ravaged in the Hinckley and Sandstone areas of Pine County, killing over 400 residents. The combination of logging and drought struck again in the Baudette Fire of 1910 and the Cloquet Fire of 1918.

Saint Anthony, on the east bank of the Mississippi River later became part of Minneapolis, and was an important lumber milling center supplied by the Rum River. In 1848, businessman Franklin Steele built the first private sawmill on the Saint Anthony Falls, and more sawmills quickly followed. The oldest wood-frame home still standing in Saint Anthony is the Ard Godfrey house, built in 1848, and lived in by Ard and Harriet Godfrey. The house of John H. Stevens, the first house on the west bank in Minneapolis, was moved several times, finally to Minnehaha Park in south Minneapolis in 1896. 

===Minnesota Territory===

On August 26, 1848, shortly after Wisconsin was admitted to the Union, a convention of sixty-one met in Stillwater to petition Congress to create a Minnesota Territory from the remainder of the Wisconsin and Iowa Territories. The delegate chosen to bring the convention&#x27;s petition before Congress was Henry Hastings Sibley. Stephen A. Douglas (D), the chair of the Senate Committee on Territories, drafted the bill authorizing Minnesota Territory. He had envisioned a future for the upper Mississippi valley, so he was motivated to keep the area from being carved up by neighboring territories. In 1846, he prevented Iowa from including Fort Snelling and Saint Anthony Falls within its northern border. In 1847, he kept the organizers of Wisconsin from including Saint Paul and Saint Anthony Falls. The Minnesota Territory was established from the lands remaining from Iowa Territory and Wisconsin Territory on March 3, 1849. The Minnesota Territory extended far into what is now North Dakota and South Dakota, to the Missouri River. There was a dispute over the shape of the state to be carved out of Minnesota Territory. An alternate proposal that was only narrowly defeated would have made the 46th parallel the state&#x27;s northern border and the Missouri River its western border, thus giving up the whole northern half of the state in exchange for the eastern half of what later became South Dakota.

With Alexander Ramsey (W) as the first governor of Minnesota Territory and Henry Hastings Sibley (D) as the territorial delegate to the United States Congress. Ramsey lobbied Congress for funds to build five military roads in the Territory: Mendota/Fort Snelling to Wabasha, Point Douglas to Fort Ripley/Crow River Indian Agency, Mendota/Fort Snelling to the Missouri River, Point Douglas to Superior, and Fort Ripley Road to Long Prairie Indian Agency. The populations of Saint Paul and Saint Anthony swelled. Henry M. Rice (D), who replaced Sibley as the territorial delegate in 1853, worked in Congress to promote Minnesota interests. He lobbied for the construction of a railroad connecting Saint Paul and Lake Superior, with a link from Saint Paul to the Illinois Central. Another military road would run from Fort Ridgely to South Pass, Nebraska Territory.

===Statehood===

In December 1856, Henry Mower Rice brought forward two bills in Congress: an enabling act that would allow Minnesota to form a state constitution, and a railroad land grant bill. Rice&#x27;s enabling act defined a state containing both prairie and forest lands. The state was bounded on the south by Iowa, on the east by Wisconsin, on the north by Canada, and on the west by the Red River of the North and the Bois de Sioux River, Lake Traverse, Big Stone Lake, and then a line extending due south to the Iowa border. Rice made this motion based on Minnesota&#x27;s population growth.

At the time, tensions between the northern and the southern United States were growing, in a series of conflicts that eventually resulted in the American Civil War. There was little debate in the United States House of Representatives, but when Stephen A. Douglas introduced the bill in the United States Senate, it caused a firestorm of debate. Northerners saw their chance to add two senators to the side of the free states, while Southerners were sure that they would lose power. Many senators offered polite arguments that the population was too sparse and that statehood was premature. Senator John Burton Thompson of Kentucky, in particular, argued that new states would cost the government too much for roads, canals, forts, and lighthouses. Although Thompson and 21 other senators voted against statehood, the enabling act was passed on February 26, 1857.

After the enabling act was passed, territorial legislators had a difficult time writing a state constitution. A constitutional convention was assembled in July 1857, but Republicans and Democrats were deeply divided. In fact, they formed two separate constitutional conventions and drafted two separate constitutions. Eventually, the two groups formed a conference committee and worked out a common constitution. The divisions continued, though, because Republicans refused to sign a document that had Democratic signatures on it, and vice versa. One copy of the constitution was written on white paper and signed only by Republicans, while the other copy was written on blue-tinged paper and signed by Democrats. These copies were signed on August 29, 1857. An election was called on October 13, 1857, where Minnesota residents would vote to approve or disapprove the constitution. The constitution was approved by 30,055 voters, while 571 rejected it.

The state constitution was sent to the United States Congress for ratification in December 1857. The approval process was drawn out for several months while Congress debated over issues that had stemmed from the Kansas–Nebraska Act. Southerners had been arguing that the next state should be pro-slavery, so when Kansas submitted the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution, the Minnesota statehood bill was delayed. After that, Northerners feared that Minnesota&#x27;s Democratic delegation would support slavery in Kansas. Finally, after the Kansas question was settled and after Congress decided how many representatives Minnesota would get in the House of Representatives, the bill passed. The eastern half of the Minnesota Territory, under the boundaries defined by Rice, became the country&#x27;s 32nd state on May 11, 1858. The western part remained unorganized until its incorporation into the Dakota Territory on March 2, 1861.

== Military conflicts ==
===Civil War===

When news broke in 1861 that Fort Sumter had been fired on, Gov. Ramsey happened to be in Washington, D.C., and rushed to the White House to give President Abraham Lincoln Minnesota&#x27;s support, being the first Union governor to do so. The soldiers of the 1st Minnesota Infantry Regiment were the first soldiers offered to fight for the Union Army. Minnesota had more than 24,000 troops serve in the Civil War, about one-seventh of the state&#x27;s population in 1860. Nearly 3,000 lost their lives to battlefield wounds or disease.

The 1st Minnesota changed the course of the decisive Battle of Gettysburg. Desperate to make time for reinforcements to arrive, on Gettysburg&#x27;s second day, July 2, 1863, General Winfield Scott Hancock sent the 262 members of 1st Minnesota to halt a Confederate assault. They succeeded in capturing a Confederate flag and held the line for the Union, but all but 47 of them were killed, wounded, or captured. The regiment lost 17 more facing Pickett&#x27;s Charge to end the battle the next day. Lt. Col. William F. Fox wrote that &quot;the percentage of loss in the First Minnesota, Gibbon&#x27;s Division [is] without an equal in the records of modern warfare&quot;. Explaining his role in ordering the First Minnesota in, Hancock is quoted, &quot;There is no more gallant deed recorded in history ...&quot;

By the end of the war, Minnesota had raised 11 regiments of infantry, two sharpshooter units, and some cavalry and artillery.

===Dakota War of 1862===

During the Civil War, the state faced another crisis as the Dakota War of 1862 broke out. As white settlement pressed in, the Dakota were destitute, even starving because of the loss of habitat of huntable game. Dakota had signed the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux and Treaty of Mendota in 1851. They were given a strip of land of north and south of the Minnesota River, but were later forced to sell the northern half. In 1862, crop failures left the Dakota with food shortages, and government money was delayed.

The conflict was ignited when four young Dakota men, searching for food, killed a family of white settlers on August 17. That night, a faction of Little Crow&#x27;s Dakota decided to try and drive all settlers out of the Minnesota River valley. In the weeks that followed, Dakota warriors attacked and killed hundreds of settlers, causing thousands to flee the area. The ensuing battles at the Lower Sioux Agency, Fort Ridgely, Birch Coulee, and Wood Lake punctuated a six-week war, which ended with the trial of 425 Indians for their participation in the war. Of this number, 303 were convicted and sentenced to death. Bishop Henry Benjamin Whipple pled to President Abraham Lincoln for clemency, and the death sentences of all but 39 Sioux were reduced to prison terms. On December 26, 1862, 38 Sioux were hanged in the largest mass execution in the United States.

Many of the remaining Dakota Indians, including non-combatants were confined in a prison camp at Pike Island over the winter of 1862–1863, where between 125 and 300 died of disease. They were later exiled to the Crow Creek Reservation, and then to a reservation near Niobrara, Nebraska. A small number of Dakota Indians returned to Minnesota in the 1880s and established small communities near Granite Falls, Morton, Prior Lake, and Red Wing.

===World War I===
When the United States entered the First World War, Minnesota&#x27;s National Guard was activated for federal service. To fill that void the State created the Minnesota Home Guard. The 16th Battalion was the first African American unit formed by the State of Minnesota. Companies A, B, and band were formed in St. Paul while C and D Companies came from Minneapolis. Because of the bigotry the soldiers experienced at enlistment, they insisted their officers be black. When the war ended the Home guard was disbanded, however, there was community support for the 16th being incorporated into the National guard. Instead, in April 1919, the Minnesota Legislature approved the formation of the First Infantry Battalion of the Minnesota Militia. It was segregated and not an official unit of the state guard.

Fort Snelling was converted to a rehabilitation hospital for veterans, and treated victims of the 1918 influenza pandemic.

=== World War II ===

Naval reservists of the Minnesota Naval Militia were manning the &quot;USS Ward&quot; at the entrance of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Sailors on the USS Ward fired at a Japanese minisub attempting to enter the harbor that morning in what is credited as the United States&#x27; first shot of World War II. Like other U.S. States, Minnesota contributed to the war effort. The United States Navy gave Cargill shipbuilding contracts after seeing their ability to build ships and barges for transporting grain. From facilities in Savage, Minnesota on the south bank of the Minnesota River, Cargill launched 18 refueling ships and 4 towboats for the war. After the war, Cargill transitioned those facilities into a major grain shipping terminal.

The War Department created the Twin Cities Army Ammunition Plant to produce munitions in Arden Hills. The plant employed 8,500 workers in 1941. With the shortage of men caused by the war effort, more than half of the workers were women. President Franklin D. Roosevelt had issued an executive order forbidding racial discrimination in defense industries and the plant employed nearly 1,000 African Americans as well as Native Americans. Camp Savage was selected to become the Army&#x27;s Japanese Language School for the Pacific theater. The school was first established in San Francisco, but moved to Minnesota after the bombing of Pearl Harbor made Japanese Americans unwelcome on the coast. Fort Snelling was a major recruit reception center after the Selective Service Act passed in 1940, processing over 300,000 individuals during the World War II years.

Between 70 and 75% of the iron needed to fight the war came from Minnesota&#x27;s iron ore. Hormel produced more than 150 million pounds of Spam for the War Department. Ancel Keys at the University of Minnesota is credited with creating K-rations. Honeywell developed and fabricated aviation control systems, nautical periscopes, and a proximity fuse for anti-aircraft shells.

During the war Minnesota had multiple prisoner of war camps, all satellites of the 10,000-person POW Camp at Algona, Iowa. Despite some friction from unions, because of a labor shortage, German war prisoners worked in the lumber, agriculture, and food processing industries, especially commercial canning.

==Economic and social development==

===Immigration===

Immigration to Minnesota began after the 1851 Treaty of Traverse des Sioux opened the land for white settlement in a land grab described as &quot;pell mell&quot;. In the 1850s, settlers moving onto Minnesota lands formerly inhabited by Native Americans created a population explosion of 2,831% (by far the nation&#x27;s fastest). Initially the territory was hungry for immigrants, and in 1855 the Minnesota Territory hired an emigration commissioner to attract immigrants in New York. Of the estimated 47 million immigrants who reached the U.S. between 1820 and 1975, about one million came to or through Minnesota. The French came in 1860, and were followed by the Irish and Swiss. The next wave, starting about 1875, brought British, French and French Canadians, Germans, and Norwegians. Danes and Swedes followed beginning in about 1880. Poles came after about 1895. Just before 1900, Hungarians and Dutch arrived. Belgians and Finns followed, and around 1910, Greeks and Italians began to come. By the late 1800s, 37% of Minnesotans were foreign-born; by 1920, that had dropped to 20%, and by 2017, to 8.2% (448,397 residents).

Intolerance and discrimination began to take hold. The 1921 Emergency Quota Act restricted immigration to the US. Citizens formed night schools on the Iron Range to teach Americanization. The practice spread and an Americanization council was formed in 1920. The Ku Klux Klan reemerged around 1921, taking political action against Jews, Catholics, and people of color, and advocating that the true American was the white Protestant. The Klan attracted women and families through everyday events like church suppers and weddings, and hosted annual parades in Owatonna, but lost steam in the state after about five years.

Legislation made immigration possible again. In 1948 Minnesota passed the Displaced Persons Act and welcomed Latvians and Estonians after World War II. In 1975, the state accepted Vietnamese and other Southeast Asians. When the US passed the Refugee Assistance Act in 1975, federal funds became available to local social service agencies, and Southeast Asians were directed primarily to Minnesota and California. The largest groups of foreign-born residents in Minnesota in 2018 were born in Mexico, Somalia, and India. In 2020, the Twin Cities had the largest Hmong population of any US metropolitan area. In 2019, the Somali diaspora in Minneapolis was the largest anywhere, comprising 1.5% of Minnesotans.

===Farming and railroads===
After the Civil War, Minnesota attracted European immigration and farmland settlers. Minnesota&#x27;s population in 1870 was 439,000; this number tripled during the two subsequent decades. The Homestead Act in 1862 facilitated land claims by settlers, who regarded the land as being cheap and fertile. The railroad industry, led by the Northern Pacific Railway and Saint Paul and Pacific Railroad, advertised opportunities in the state and worked to attract immigrants. James J. Hill was instrumental in reorganizing the Saint Paul and Pacific Railroad and extending lines from the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area into the Red River Valley and to Winnipeg. He was also responsible for building a passenger depot in Minneapolis, served by the Stone Arch Bridge which was completed in 1883. Other railroads, such as the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad and the Milwaukee Road, also played an important role in the early days of Minnesota&#x27;s statehood. Later railways, such as the Soo Line and Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway facilitated the transport of flour and other products, although they were not as involved in attracting settlers.
Oliver Hudson Kelley played an important role in farming as one of the founders of the National Grange. The organization worked to provide education and advocacy on matters important to farmers. An area of concern was the freight rates charged by the railroads and by the grain elevators. Since there was little or no competition between railroads serving Minnesota farm communities, railroads could charge as much as the traffic would bear. By 1871, the situation was so heated that both the Republican and Democratic candidates in state elections promised to regulate railroad rates. The state established an office of railroad commissioner and imposed maximum charges for shipping. Populist Ignatius L. Donnelly also served the Grange as an organizer.

Saint Anthony Falls played an important part in the development of Minneapolis. The power of the waterfall first fueled sawmills, but later it was tapped to serve flour mills. In 1870, only a small number of flour mills were in the Minneapolis area, but by 1900 Minnesota mills were grinding 14.1% of the nation&#x27;s grain. Advances in transportation, milling technology, and water power combined to give Minneapolis dominance in the milling industry. Spring wheat could be sown in the spring and harvested in late summer, but it posed special problems for milling. To get around these problems, Minneapolis millers invented the middlings purifier, a device that used jets of air to remove the husks from the flour early in the milling process. They also started using roller mills, as opposed to grindstones. A series of rollers gradually broke down the kernels and integrated the gluten with the starch. These improvements led to the production of &quot;patent&quot; flour, which commanded almost double the price of &quot;bakers&quot; or &quot;clear&quot; flour, which it replaced. Pillsbury and the Washburn-Crosby Company (a forerunner of General Mills) became the leaders in the Minneapolis milling industry. This leadership in milling later declined as milling was no longer dependent on water power, but the dominance of the mills contributed greatly to the economy of Minneapolis and Minnesota, attracting people and money to the region.

===Industrial development===

At the end of the 19th century, several forms of industrial development shaped Minnesota. In 1882, a hydroelectric power plant was built at Saint Anthony Falls, marking one of the first developments of hydroelectric power in the United States. Iron mining began in northern Minnesota with the opening of the Soudan Mine in 1884. The Vermilion Range was surveyed and mapped by a party financed by Charlemagne Tower. Another mining town, Ely began with the foundation of the Chandler Mine in 1888. Soon after, ore was found just under the surface of the ground in Mountain Iron in the Mesabi Range. Ore in the Mesabi Range was easier to extract because it was closer to the surface, and 111 open-pit mines were operating there by 1904. To ship the iron ore to refineries, railroads such as the Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway were built from the iron ranges to Two Harbors and Duluth on Lake Superior. Large ore docks were used at these cities to load the iron ore onto ships for transport east on the Great Lakes. The mining industry helped to propel Duluth from a small town to a large, thriving city. In 1904, iron was discovered in the Cuyuna Range in Crow Wing County. Between 1904 and 1984, when mining ceased there, more than 106 million tons of ore were mined.

===Urbanization and government===

As a result of industrialization, the population became more concentrated in urban areas. By 1900, the Twin Cities were becoming a center of commerce, led by the Minneapolis Grain Exchange. Many of the businessmen who had made money in the railroad, flour milling, and logging industries started to donate money to cultural institutions such as the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra (now the Minnesota Orchestra). The parks of Minneapolis, under the direction of Theodore Wirth became famous, and the new Minnesota State Capitol building and the Cathedral of Saint Paul attracted attention to Saint Paul.

The role of government grew during the early 20th century. In the rural areas, most people obtained food and manufactured goods from neighbors and other people they knew personally. As industry and commerce grew, goods such as food, materials, and medicines were no longer made by neighbors, but by large companies. In response, citizens called on their government for consumer protection, inspection of goods, and regulation of public utilities. The growth of the automobile spurred calls to develop roads and to enforce traffic laws. New regulations were necessary for commerce and safety, and for banking and insurance. Since government was getting more complex, citizens demanded more of a role in their government, and became more politically active.

===Health===
William Worrall Mayo, M.D. the founder of the Mayo Clinic, moved to Rochester in 1863. In the summer of 1883, an F5 tornado struck, dubbed the 1883 Rochester tornado, causing a substantial number of deaths and injuries. W. W. Mayo worked with nuns from the Sisters of St. Francis to treat the survivors. After the disaster, Mother Alfred Moes and Mayo recognized the need for a hospital and joined to build Saint Marys Hospital which opened in 1889. The hospital, with over 1,100 beds, is now part of the Mayo Clinic, which grew out of the practice of William Worrall Mayo and his sons, William James Mayo (1861–1939) and Charles Horace Mayo.

Norman Risjord writes in &quot;A Popular History of Minnesota&quot; that Mayo was a &quot;pioneer in the concept of integrated group practice of medicine&quot; and is &quot;one of the premier medical facilities in the world&quot;, with more than 40,000 employees including 2,000 physicians, by the beginning of the 21st century. &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; 2021 survey placed the Mayo Clinic first on the best hospitals honor roll and in the top four in most fields.

Apart from Mayo, Minnesota was an average northern state in developing public health programs after 1872, when the state board of medicine was established and public health programs began to operate.

===Great Depression===
The Great Depression caused layoffs on the Iron Range, and a drought in the Great Plains from 1931 through 1936 further affected Minnesota. Wilbur Foshay, an owner of several utility companies, built the Foshay Tower in 1929, just before the Wall Street Crash of 1929. The tallest building in Minnesota at the time, it was a symbol of the wealth, but Foshay lost his fortune when the stock market crashed.

Elected governor in 1930, Floyd B. Olson signed a bonding bill that authorized $15 million ($ as of 2025) for highway construction, in an effort to provide work for the unemployed. He also signed an executive order that provided for a minimum wage of 45 cents per hour for up to 48 hours weekly, predating the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 that established a nationwide minimum wage. The 1933 legislative session saw a comprehensive response to the depression including a moratorium on mortgage foreclosures, a reduction in property taxes for farmers and homeowners, the state income tax, and chain store taxes, tavern reform, ratification of a child labor amendment, and a state old-age pension system.

In 1933 the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was created by an executive order of President Franklin Roosevelt, to provide employment to young jobless, unmarried men, and to help their families in need. They were assigned to nature conservation projects on waterways and primarily in forestry. At least 77,000 Minnesota men enrolled in the program. CCC activity peaked in Minnesota in 1935 with a total of 18,500 enrollees in 104 camps. The CCC was structured like and set up by the US Army which had a strict segregation policy. African Americans had difficulties getting these jobs, which mainly went to Whites and to a small number of Native Americans. The Civilian Conservation Corps-Indian Division (CCC-ID) was allocated 400 positions based on Minnesota&#x27;s Native American population. The Bureau of Indian Affairs administered the CCC-ID camps.

Labor unions began forcefully asserting themselves. The Minneapolis Teamsters Strike of 1934 turned ugly, with the union demanding the right to speak for all trucking employees. As a result of this strike and many others across the nation, Congress passed the National Labor Relations Act in 1935. Government programs such as the CCC and Works Progress Administration brought much-needed work projects to the state. Congress passed the Indian Reorganization Act in 1934, giving Minnesota&#x27;s Ojibwa and Dakota tribes more autonomy over their own affairs.

===Modern economy===

Flour milling spurred the growth of banking in Minneapolis. Millers had to pay cash for wheat during the growing season, and then hold it until it was needed for flour, which required large amounts of capital. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis was founded in 1914; it serves parts of six states in the Federal Reserve System.

Agriculture evolved from an individual occupation into a major industry after World War II. Technological developments increased farm productivity with the automation of feedlots for hogs and cattle, machine milking for dairy production, and large poultry building operations. Crops became more specialized with hybridization of corn and wheat, fertilization, and mechanical equipment such as tractors and combines became the norm. University of Minnesota professor Norman Borlaug contributed to this knowledge as part of the Green Revolution. The Minnesota Valley Canning Company sold cream style corn and then peas before becoming Green Giant in 1950.

Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company (3M) was founded in 1902 in Two Harbors, Minnesota, and was later moved to Duluth, Saint Paul, and then Maplewood. The founders of 3M got their start by manufacturing sandpaper. Under the leadership of William L. McKnight, the company established product lines such as abrasives for wet sanding, masking tape and other adhesives, roofing granules, resins, and films.

Suburban development intensified after the war, fueled by the demand for new housing. In 1957, the Legislature created a planning commission for the Twin Cities metropolitan area, which became the Metropolitan Council in 1967.

Northwest Airlines was founded in 1926 carrying mail from the Twin Cities to Chicago. The airline, long headquartered in Eagan, merged with Delta Air Lines in October 2008 and the Northwest headquarters closed.

===Technology===
Engineering Research Associates, formed in Saint Paul in 1946, built massive mainframes for the still-secret National Security Agency&#x27;s wartime code-breaking and Cold War intelligence needs. Minneapolis startup Control Data Corporation under executive William Norris and engineer Seymour Cray imagined the computer hardware marketplace and then filled it profitably. From his hometown in Wisconsin, Cray and his team delivered the world&#x27;s fastest computer, called the first supercomputer, in the mid-60s for Control Data back in Minnesota.

Rival IBM purchased of farmland in Rochester, Minnesota in 1956 for a manufacturing facility, choosing the site over others because of the absence of labor unions. Together with Livermore Labs, they assembled what was the world&#x27;s fastest supercomputer between 2004 and 2008. IBM Rochester also manufactured superfast gaming chips, and the Watson that beat two human &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; champions in 2011.

At a Minneapolis campus from 1927 until the 1990s, Honeywell, experts in variable feedback-control, had a national profile in military technology. Medtronic, founded in a Minneapolis garage in 1949, is the world&#x27;s largest medical device maker as of 2020.

===Infrastructure===
The state officially started its trunk highway system in 1920, with the passage of the Babcock Amendment that established 70 Constitutional Routes around the state.

On August 1, 2007, the Interstate 35W Mississippi River Bridge in Minneapolis collapsed during the evening rush hour. A construction project was in progress on the bridge and nearly of construction equipment and materials was positioned on the bridge. The main span of the deck truss experienced a catastrophic failure, and collapsed; 13 people died and 145 were injured. The National Transportation Safety Board investigation revealed that one of the gusset plates was insufficient. The collapse raised questions about other deficient bridges in the United States and in Minnesota. It was determined that $60.5 billion would need to be raised to keep Minnesota&#x27;s road system functional. A third of Minnesota&#x27;s highway bridges were more than 50 years old, and the state&#x27;s pavement condition was ranked 38th in the nation.

===Politics===
Hubert Humphrey was an influential Minnesota Democrat who became Minneapolis mayor (1945), U.S. senator (1948–1964, elected three times), and U.S. vice president (1965–1969). In 1944 he and others worked to merge Democrats and the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party into the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. Proposed by Humphrey, the country&#x27;s first municipal fair employment law was adopted while he was mayor. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, which Humphrey called his greatest achievement, was based on ideas that Humphrey had introduced in the Senate for the previous fifteen years. Lyndon B. Johnson recruited Humphrey for his running mate in the 1964 presidential election. Humphrey&#x27;s support of the Vietnam War is said to have cost him the U.S. presidency.

Eugene McCarthy (DFL) served in the United States House of Representatives from 1949 through 1959 and in the United States Senate from 1959 through 1971. In 1967, he challenged Lyndon B. Johnson for the presidential nomination, running on an anti-war platform in contrast to Johnson&#x27;s policies. Democrat Walter Mondale became U.S. senator (1964–1977) to replace Humphrey and then was vice president under Jimmy Carter.

Paul Wellstone (DFL) was elected to the United States Senate in 1990, defeating incumbent Rudy Boschwitz (R) in a major upset with Boschwitz the only incumbent senator to lose reelection that year. Jesse Ventura was elected governor in 1998; he left office after one term. His election brought international attention to the Independence Party.

===Civil rights===
The 1791 United States Bill of Rights gave civil rights to propertied White men; race, sex, immigration, and LGBTQ discrimination have been barriers to constitutional equality. In 1868, Minnesota was the first state to grant Black men the right to vote after two failed attempts; however, true opportunities for Blacks remained illusory. The Minnesota Human Rights Act of 1967 defends thirteen &quot;protected classes&quot; of people in seven areas of protection.

Native American men voted and served in the Minnesota legislature between 1849 and 1862, when they had citizenship and considerable political power. Following the Dakota War, Native Americans lost their citizenship (and some, their lives) and none served again until 1933. Arcane, exclusionary language dating from the Minnesota Territory was in the state constitution until 1960.

In 1920, women earned the right to vote with the Nineteenth Amendment. Other women&#x27;s rights were advanced in the Equal Rights Amendment in 1923, and while Minnesota ratified it in 1973, it did not gain support nationally. As more women entered politics, however, the state passed groundbreaking legislation in pay equity, domestic violence, and parental leave.

In 1971 &quot;Baker v. Nelson&quot; the Minnesota Supreme Court affirmed that marriage licenses are available only to persons of the opposite sex. In 2015, the US Supreme Court overruled the decision, legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide, and in 2018, Baker&#x27;s marriage was explicitly recognized as valid in Minnesota. The state protects against discrimination for sexual orientation and gender identity.

George Floyd, an African-American man, was arrested on May 25, 2020, by Minneapolis police officers on suspicion of passing a counterfeit $20 bill. Officer Derek Chauvin pinned Floyd to the ground and held his knee to the back of Floyd&#x27;s neck for over ten minutes, while Floyd repeatedly said that he couldn&#x27;t breathe. Floyd was transported to Hennepin County Medical Center and was pronounced dead. Darnella Frazier recorded the murder of George Floyd. The video quickly went viral, and large protests erupted in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area. The protests spread to more than 150 other cities in the United States. Chauvin was found guilty of second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter. In February 2022, three other officers on the scene were convicted of federal charges of failing to provide aid to Floyd, the first time that U.S. police officers have been tried on failing to intervene against a more senior officer who was using excessive force. Announcing her Benenson Courage Award, PEN America said, &quot;With nothing more than a cell phone and sheer guts, Darnella changed the course of history in this country&quot;.

According to the Minnesota Historical Society, there have been 20 lynchings in Minnesota, three of which were African Americans.

Minnesota&#x27;s first execution happened in St. Paul in 1860. A woman named Ann Bilansky was accused of poisoning her husband and sentenced to hang. Bilansky was the only woman hanged by the state of Minnesota, but 26 men were hanged after her. (The federal government executed the 38 Sioux men hanged during the Dakota War.) In 1906 the hanging of William Williams was botched in St. Paul, and ended up being a strangulation that took 14 minutes. Capital punishment in Minnesota was abolished in 1911.

===Arts and culture===
The Guthrie Theater, opened in 1963, was the brainchild of Sir Tyrone Guthrie, who wanted to found a regional theater without the commercial constraints of Broadway. His ideas were first disseminated in a 1959 article in the drama section of the &quot;New York Times&quot;, and citizens in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area were eager to support them. The theater served as a prototype for other resident non-profit theaters.

The Minnesota Orchestra dates back to 1903 when it was founded as the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra. It was renamed the Minnesota Orchestra in 1968 and moved into its own building, Orchestra Hall, in downtown Minneapolis in 1974. Later the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra became the second full-time professional orchestral ensemble in the Twin Cities.

The Minneapolis Institute of Arts was established in 1883. The present building was opened in 1915. The Walker Art Center was established in 1927 as the first public art gallery in the Upper Midwest. In the 1940s, the museum shifted its focus toward modern art.

=== State and national parks ===
Minnesota&#x27;s first state park, Itasca State Park, was established in 1891 at the source of the Mississippi River. By 1925, Minnesota had 23 parks. During the Depression, with nine of its parks used as housing for the Civilian Conservation Corps, a division of state parks was created to administer the park system. Modern Minnesota has 72 state parks and recreation areas, and 59 state forests, all managed by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.

Christopher C. Andrews, Minnesota&#x27;s forestry commissioner in 1902, began to press for federally protected lands in the northern part of the state (now the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, or BWCA, area). Superior National Forest was created from all federally owned land in northeastern Minnesota in 1909 by President Theodore Roosevelt. With sawmills shutting down and property owners falling behind on taxes during the Great Depression, the federal government purchased more land to add to the Superior National Forest. Publicity of the natural beauty of the area led to increased recreational use during the 1950s. The area was officially named the Boundary Waters Canoe Area in 1958, and the Wilderness Act of 1964 organized it as a unit of the National Wilderness Preservation System.

<text>Dustin Patrick Runnels (born April 11, 1969) is an American professional wrestler. He is signed to All Elite Wrestling (AEW), where he performs under the ring name Dustin Rhodes, with a nickname of &quot;The Natural&quot; and is a member of The Sons of Texas. He also appears in AEW&#x27;s sister promotion Ring of Honor (ROH) where he is a double champion: he is currently one-half of the ROH World Tag Team Champions alongside Sammy Guevara, and one-third of the ROH World Six-Man Tag Team Champions alongside Marshall and Ross Von Erich in their first reign both as a team and individually.

He is previously known for wrestling in the World Wrestling Federation/WWE from 1995 to 2018 (on and off), under the ring name Goldust. A second generation wrestler, he is the son of WWE Hall of Famer Dusty Rhodes and the half-brother of Cody Rhodes. He is also known for his appearances with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA).

Between WWE, WCW, and ROH, Runnels has won 25 total championships. In WCW, he was a two-time WCW United States Heavyweight Champion, a one-time WCW World Six-Man Tag Team Champion, and a two-time WCW World Tag Team Champion. In the WWF/WWE, he is a three-time WWF Intercontinental Champion, nine-time WWE Hardcore Champion, one-time World Tag Team Champion, and two-time WWE Tag Team Champion. Runnels has also appeared in the fourth most Royal Rumble matches, at 13. Runnels headlined multiple pay-per-view events for WWE (then WWF) and WCW during the 1990s.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== Championship Wrestling from Florida (1988–1989) ===
Runnels made his professional wrestling debut on September 13, 1988, as &quot;Dustin Rhodes&quot;, defeating Bob Cook in a match for the Tampa-based Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF) promotion. The promotion was renamed the Professional Wrestling Federation in February 1989 after Runnels&#x27; father, Dusty Rhodes, began wrestling there. Runnels captured the NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship from Al Perez on May 23, 1989, holding it for a month.

=== World Championship Wrestling (1988–1989) ===
In December 1988, Runnels debuted in World Championship Wrestling (WCW). Rhodes teamed with Kendall Windham in an undercard tag team called The Texas Broncos that saw success against The Cruel Connection and The Commandos. Their first defeat came against The Original Midnight Express at a house show on December 10, 1988, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Rhodes&#x27;s first singles match came two days later at a television taping in Atlanta, Georgia when he defeated Trent Knight. Rhodes&#x27; initial WCW run lasted only a few months, as he exited the company two months after his father. After suffering a loss to Butch Reed during a dark match for an &quot;NWA Main Event&quot; taping in The Omni on February 12, 1989, Rhodes closed out his initial WCW run with a win over Trent Knight in Walterboro, South Carolina on February 24.

=== Japan and Memphis (1989–1990) ===
In March 1989, Runnels toured Japan for All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) in its annual Champion Carnival, under the name Dusty Rhodes Jr. He returned to AJPW for a ten and a twenty-day tour in the spring and summer of 1990. Runnels began wrestling in the United States Wrestling Association (USWA) in July 1989. There he feuded mainly with Tony Anthony for Anthony&#x27;s CWA Heavyweight Championship but never won the belt. He left the USWA in the spring of 1990.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1990–1991) ===
Runnels debuted as a fan favorite in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in late 1990, wrestling as Dustin Rhodes. His first match in the WWF (now WWE) was against Paul Diamond on WWF on MSG Network on September 21, 1990. In November 1990, Rhodes defeated Ted DiBiase in a televised ten-minute challenge match. On January 19, 1991, at the Royal Rumble, Rhodes and his father Dusty lost to Ted DiBiase and Virgil in a tag team bout, and both left immediately after.

=== Return to WCW (1991–1995) ===
==== Teaming with Barry Windham (1991–1992) ====
In February 1991, Runnels joined World Championship Wrestling (WCW), wrestling as &quot;The Natural&quot; Dustin Rhodes. He feuded with Larry Zbyszko until April 1991, when he refused to join Alexandra York&#x27;s York Foundation, thus beginning a feud with Foundation member Terrence Taylor.

In late 1991, Rhodes formed a tag-team with Barry Windham and began pursuing WCW Tag Team champions The Enforcers (Arn Anderson and Zbyszko). The pair received a title shot at &quot;Clash of the Champions XVII&quot;, but Windham was (kayfabe) injured prior to the event by the champions when they slammed a car door on his wrist. A returning Ricky Steamboat was chosen to partner Rhodes, and the makeshift duo won the WCW World Tag Team Championship. They lost the belts on January 16, 1992, to Arn Anderson and fellow Dangerous Alliance member Bobby Eaton.

On a taped edition of &quot;WCW Saturday Night&quot; on September 2, 1992, Rhodes teamed with Windham to defeat Steve Williams and Terry Gordy for the unified WCW World Tag Team Championship and NWA World Tag Team Championship (their NWA title reign is not recognized by NWA); the match would air on October 3. They held the belts for about two months before losing them to Steamboat and Shane Douglas in a memorable match on the November 18 edition of &quot;Clash of the Champions XXI&quot;. Windham turned on Rhodes after the match when Rhodes refused to pin Steamboat after an accidental low blow.

==== United States Heavyweight Champion (1993–1995) ====
In January 1993, Rhodes reached the final of a tournament to decide the number one contender for the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship. The champion Rick Rude was stripped of his title that same month, meaning the tournament final would be for the title. Rhodes faced his old partner Ricky Steamboat to win his first United States Heavyweight title. He successfully defended the title the following month at SuperBrawl III against Maxx Payne. Rude returned that April and quickly challenged Rhodes. Their first encounter resulted in a controversial double pin, with Rude initially being awarded the title. The championship was held up two weeks later.
After a 30-minute Iron Man Match ended in a 1–1 draw at Beach Blast on July 18, a best-of-three series was set between the two on &quot;Saturday Night&quot;; Rhodes lost the first match on August 28, but defeated Rude twice on September 4 and 11 to claim his second United States Heavyweight Championship.

At Fall Brawl, Rhodes teamed with Sting, Davey Boy Smith and The Shockmaster to defeat Big Van Vader, Sid Vicious and Harlem Heat in a WarGames match. Rhodes lost the title to Steve Austin in a Two out of three falls match at Starrcade, after losing both falls.

In March 1994, Rhodes started feuding with Bunkhouse Buck and Col. Robert Parker. After Parker introduced Arn Anderson and Terry Funk as adversaries for Runnels, Runnels responded by bringing his father, a former enemy of Funk, back into the ring to team with him again against Parker&#x27;s Stud Stable. In December 1994, Parker introduced another opponent for Rhodes, The Blacktop Bully. At the Uncensored pay-per-view on March 19, 1995, Rhodes lost to The Blacktop Bully in the only King of the Road match in the company&#x27;s history. The match, which was filmed several days earlier, resulted in both Rhodes and The Blacktop Bully being fired from the company, as the two had bladed during the match after being instructed to by one another, which was against corporate policy at the time in WCW.

=== Return to WWF (1995–1999) ===
==== Debut of Goldust (1995–1997) ====

In August 1995, Runnels returned to the WWF, wrestling as a then-villain Goldust, nicknamed &quot;the Bizarre One&quot; because of his somewhat spooky, mysterious, bashful presentation yet sexual suggestiveness turned aggressions. In communications, Goldust frequently took to comical flirtation while maintaining a bashfully deadpan and delivery and presence. Using in-ring psychology to his advantage, Goldust often performed lewd and flirtatious to anger, confuse, and distract his opponents. He engaged in such tactics as groping and excessive physical affection towards his opponent in the midst of delivering his onslaught. To that end, one of Goldust&#x27;s trademarks was his exaggerated, suggestively breathy inhalation whilst caressing his own body; this display ended in him exhaling through a startlingly vicious biting sound directed at his adversaries (also said between his catchphrase words &quot;You will never forget the name of&quot; and &quot;Goldust&quot;). The character was portrayed as a drag queen obsessed with films and everything gold, which is a parody of the Oscars statuette. Adding to this aspect of the gimmick, Goldust often quoted or made references to classic Hollywood films during his promos. Under the gimmick, Runnels wore a predominately gold jumpsuit (with tads of other colors, such as white and black); black and gold face paint; and during entrances and promos, a glittery gold robe and a platinum blonde wig over his short platinum blonde hair.

Years later, Runnels stated that Vince McMahon called him and offered him the gimmick and mentioned &quot;androgynous&quot; several times; Runnels, wanting a separate identity from his father at the time, promptly accepted without knowing what the word &quot;androgynous&quot; meant, then promptly looked it up in the dictionary after getting off the phone with McMahon and shocked to see what it meant said to himself &quot;What did I get myself in to?&quot; Runnels himself admitted that the first few months of the gimmick were uncomfortable for him as it didn&#x27;t match his personality at all, but decided to work with what was given to him and &quot;run with it&quot;.

He would defeat Bob Holly at In Your House 3 in a dark match. 

Goldust won his television debut match on October 22, 1995, against Marty Jannetty at the In Your House 4 pay-per-view. He defeated the departing Bam Bam Bigelow in Bigelow&#x27;s last WWF match at the Survivor Series. He then feuded with Razor Ramon, whom he stalked and sent messages to throughout late 1995. The feud culminated at the Royal Rumble on January 21, 1996, where Goldust defeated Ramon for the Intercontinental Championship due to interference from the 1–2–3 Kid. This match also marked the debut of Goldust&#x27;s valet, Marlena, portrayed by his then wife Terri. With her seductive, coolly unconcerned, mysterious character and fully gold-colored wear, Marlena complemented Goldust. Her gimmick consisted of sitting at ringside in a director&#x27;s chair during Goldust&#x27;s matches, advising him while smoking large brown cigars. A rematch between Goldust and Ramon at WrestleMania XII was canceled after Ramon was suspended, with Goldust instead fighting Roddy Piper in a Hollywood Backlot Brawl. At the end of the fight, Piper stripped Goldust of his ring attire to reveal him wearing women&#x27;s lingerie; Runnels revealed in 2018 that it was his idea just three days before WrestleMania XII to wear a slip and thong underneath his ring attire and to have Piper strip him down, getting the approval from McMahon.

Goldust defended his Intercontinental Championship in bouts against Savio Vega and The Ultimate Warrior before losing the title to Ahmed Johnson at King of the Ring on June 23, 1996. In Summer 1996, Goldust briefly gained control over Mankind and feuded with The Undertaker. His attention soon turned to Marc Mero and his then wife Sable. Goldust and Marlena attempted to get Sable to join their team, but Mero won the feud and kept her by his side. He also had a ladder match with Shawn Michaels at internet pay-per-view (iPPV) Xperience for the WWF Championship but lost the match.

In December 1996, Goldust entered a feud with Hunter Hearst Helmsley, when Helmsley began flirting with Marlena. This feud lead to the debut of Chyna as Helmsley&#x27;s new bodyguard and marked the first time Goldust became a fan favorite.

==== Various gimmicks (1997–1999) ====
In May 1997, Goldust revealed his identity as Dustin Runnels, the son of Dusty Rhodes. In the summer and fall of that year, he joined other wrestlers in their conflict with The Hart Foundation, feuding in particular with Brian Pillman. Goldust defeated Pillman at SummerSlam in which Pillman was forced to wear a dress for a month, then Pillman challenged Goldust again to a match at Ground Zero: In Your House, Goldust agreed that if he lost, he would lose Marlena to Pillman for 30 days, Goldust lost the match to Pillman and was forced to lose Marlena, had Goldust won, Pillman would leave the WWF. Just before the thirty days were up, Pillman died of heart disease hours before the Badd Blood event on October 5, 1997. In November 1997, Goldust split with Marlena and refused to cooperate with his Survivor Series teammates, which once again turned him into a heel. This led to a feud with Vader in December 1997 and the appearance of The Artist Formerly Known As Goldust (a reference to Prince), managed by Luna Vachon. He began mimicking celebrities and fellow wrestlers with characters such as &quot;Chynadust&quot;, &quot;Dust Lovedust&quot;, &quot;Dustydust&quot;, &quot;Hunterdust&quot;, &quot;Flashdust&quot;, &quot;Marilyn Mansondust&quot;, &quot;Sabledust&quot;, and &quot;Vaderdust&quot; in early 1998. Around this time, he made a legitimate push to management to get breast implants as part of the gimmick before being talked out of it by McMahon.

By June 1998, Goldust feuded with Val Venis, who had been involved with Terri during their separation. Now going by his real name, Runnels began speaking out (mostly in taped vignettes) on the increasingly edgy WWF product and promoting alternatives to watching the show such as reading the Bible. These vignettes were sponsored by the fictional group, &quot;Evangelists Against Television, Movies and Entertainment&quot;, the acronym for which reads &quot;EATME&quot; – a thinly veiled joke on the WWF&#x27;s part. Runnels declared himself a born again Christian, alluding to &quot;his&quot; return, and walking through the crowd with signs reading &quot;he&#x27;s coming back!&quot;. While the return of Christ was clearly implied, Runnels was in fact referencing the return of the Goldust gimmick, which he reprised in October 1998 against Val Venis and then in November 1998, he began feuding with Jeff Jarrett over the attention of his manager, Debra.

In early 1999, Goldust feuded with Al Snow, upon stealing the mannequin Head, Snow&#x27;s mascot, and The Blue Meanie, who had recently renamed himself &quot;Bluedust&quot; and adopted many of Goldust&#x27;s mannerisms. After Goldust defeated Meanie at St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre, Meanie became Goldust&#x27;s apprentice. After Ryan Shamrock became Goldust&#x27;s valet, Meanie and Shamrock began vying for Goldust&#x27;s attention. In the same time period, Goldust won the Intercontinental Championship again from Road Dogg and then lost it to The Godfather two weeks later. He would team up with The Blue Meanie having a few matches against The Hardy Boyz until Goldust left the WWF in June 1999.

=== Second return to WCW (1999–2001) ===
Runnels returned to WCW on the November 8, 1999, edition of &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot;, filming several vignettes for a fantastical, face-painted character named Seven. These vignettes contained ominous footage of Rhodes in full makeup standing outside a child&#x27;s bedroom window. The gimmick was reported to have been based on &quot;The Strangers&quot; from the 1998 film noir &quot;Dark City&quot;. The character was dropped after Turner Standards and Practices expressed concern that this gimmick could be misinterpreted as a child abductor. Upon returning to WCW television, Rhodes removed his costume and delivered a worked shoot in which he mocked unrealistic gimmicks as well as his time as Goldust in the WWF. After turning heel upon his return, Runnels began wrestling as &quot;The American Nightmare&quot; Dustin Rhodes, with his nickname a reference to his father&#x27;s nickname, &quot;The American Dream&quot;. &quot;The American Nightmare&quot; nickname would later be used by Runnels&#x27; half brother, Cody Rhodes.

Rhodes feuded with Jeff Jarrett before feuding with Terry Funk. He was (kayfabe) fired by Vince Russo at Spring Stampede in April 2000 for failing to prevent Terry Funk from winning the vacant Hardcore Championship, against Norman Smiley.

Runnels returned to WCW television in January 2001, assisting his father in his feud with Jarrett and, eventually, Ric Flair. He wrestled on the final WCW pay-per-view, Greed on March 18, 2001. In March 2001, WCW was purchased by the World Wrestling Federation, but the WWF did not acquire Runnels&#x27; contract.

=== Turnbuckle Championship Wrestling (2001–2002) ===

In July 2001, Runnels, while still under contract to AOL Time Warner, began wrestling for his father&#x27;s newly created Turnbuckle Championship Wrestling promotion, winning the promotion&#x27;s Heavyweight Championship.

He would team up with his father. Competing as Dustin Rhodes, he captured the TCW Heavyweight Championship from Scotty Riggs on January 26, but vacated the title immediately afterwards after it was confirmed that he would be returning to WWF. Following his return to the WWF at the 2002 Royal Rumble, he made two more appearances with TCW, the first in a six-man tag team match with his father Dusty and Ron Studd against Riggs, Fake Goldust, and Jason Sugarmann, and the second in a singles victory over Steve Corino.

=== Second return to WWF/WWE (2001–2003) ===
==== Hardcore Champion (2001–2002) ====
In December 2001, Runnels accepted a buyout from his AOL Time Warner contract and was re-signed by the World Wrestling Federation to a two-year deal. Promos immediately began airing on WWF television advertising the return of Goldust. On January 20, 2002, he officially returned by taking part in the Royal Rumble, reprising his Goldust character. Shortly after returning, promos began airing for a few weeks of Goldust saying that there was a certain wrestler whose &quot;star was shining brighter&quot; than he would like. He eventually revealed the person he was talking about was Rob Van Dam by attacking him on &quot;Raw&quot;, turning heel in the process. Van Dam defeated him in a singles match at No Way Out on February 17. After the loss, he moved on to the hardcore division, where he won the Hardcore Championship on nine occasions.

==== Teaming with Booker T (2002–2003) ====

When the World Wrestling Federation was renamed World Wrestling Entertainment and the roster was divided into two brands, Raw and SmackDown!, Goldust was assigned to the Raw brand, where he formed a tag team with Booker T. The duo engaged in numerous comedic vignettes, on one occasion hosting a segment titled &quot;Booker T and Goldust at the Movies&quot; and delivering reviews of &quot;The Scorpion King&quot;, a film starring The Rock. In May 2002, Booker T joined the New World Order (nWo), with Goldust&#x27;s request to join the faction rejected. In June 2002, Booker T was ejected from the nWo by Shawn Michaels, sparking a feud between the nWo and Booker T and Goldust. Booker T and Goldust went on to compete in the tag team division, winning the World Tag Team Championship at Armageddon before being forced to split up on the February 3, 2003, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; by Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff for failing to win back the World Tag Team Championship.

Following the dissolution of the tag team, Goldust contracted a stutter and Tourette&#x27;s-like symptoms, upon receiving a shock from a Round Tube during an attack at the hands of Batista and Randy Orton. Goldust appeared in character on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; in March 2003. He appeared sporadically thereafter, forming a tag team with Lance Storm in August 2003. In fall 2003, Booker T began receiving mysterious, haunting messages for a few weeks from somebody. The messages only said &quot;I remember&quot;. It was rumored that the messages would be from Goldust, which would have begun a feud between the two. Suddenly, the angle was never mentioned again on television and the company announced on their website that they would not be renewing Rhodes&#x27; contract. WWE allowed his contract to expire in December 2003.

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2004–2005) ===
On February 4, 2004, he debuted in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) as &quot;The Lone Star&quot; Dustin Rhodes, unsuccessfully challenging Jeff Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. On February 18, Runnels and El Leon defeated Kevin Northcutt and Legend in a tag team bout. In December 2004, he returned to TNA, once again wrestling as Dustin Rhodes. on the January 7, 2005, episode of Impact, Rhodes and Jeff Hardy defeated Kash and Dallas. On the January 14 episode of Impact, Rhodes defeated Chris Candido. At Final Resolution, Rhodes defeated Kid Kash. on the February 11 episode of Impact Wrestling, Rhodes and America&#x27;s Most Wanted defeated Kid Kash, Dallas and Raven in a six-man tag team match. at Against All Odds, Rhodes lost to Raven but got payback at Destination X when he defeated Raven in a bullrope match. He then entered a feud with Bobby Roode and at Lockdown, Rhodes defeated Roode in a 2 out of 3 falls Prince of Darkness cage match. His TNA contract expired in April 2005 and he chose not to renew it, leaving TNA.

=== Third return to WWE (2005–2006) ===
Runnels returned to World Wrestling Entertainment on October 31, 2005, as a heel and back under the Goldust attire, as Jonathan Coachman enlisted him and Vader to attack Batista. Goldust and Vader unsuccessfully interfered in a Street Fight between Batista and Coachman on behalf of Coachman at Taboo Tuesday. Following the event, Goldust once again disappeared from television. In January 2006, Goldust took part in the Royal Rumble match and was assigned once again to the &quot;Raw&quot; brand until he was released from his WWE contract on June 14, 2006, for no-showing an appearance. Runnels made a short appearance at WrestleMania 22 to give Booker T advice on his match against The Boogeyman where he insinuated that the only way he could beat The Boogeyman was to put worms in his anus.

=== Return to Japan (2007) ===
On January 28, 2007, it was announced that Rhodes would appear at the February 17, 2007, All Japan Pro Wrestling show in the Ryōgoku Kokugikan in Tokyo. On February 15, Rhodes, identified as Gold Dustin, appeared at ringside during a match involving The Great Muta, resulting in a brawl between Rhodes and The Great Muta. On February 17, Rhodes and Jinsei Shinzaki were defeated by The Great Muta and Yoshihiro Tajiri in a tag team bout.

=== Return to TNA (2007–2008) ===
On July 15, 2007, Rhodes returned to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling at Victory Road and aligned himself with Christian Cage by helping him defeat &quot;Wildcat&quot; Chris Harris. In an interview on &quot;TNA Impact!&quot; conducted by Mike Tenay, Rhodes discussed accusations of having a split personality and stated that he was going to embrace it and let it out. TNA presented the interview as being an emotional breakdown on the part of Rhodes. On August 12 at Hard Justice, Rhodes debuted his new ring name, Black Reign, and a &quot;new, darker and bizarre look&quot;. At Hard Justice, Harris defeated Black Reign via disqualification when Black Reign attacked several referees. The next week, the gimmick was explored even further, saying that Rhodes constantly switched between Rhodes and Black Reign. He was featured at Bound for Glory in a Monster&#x27;s Ball match against Rhino, Abyss, and Raven, which he lost. Black Reign challenged Abyss to a &quot;Shop of Horrors&quot; match at Genesis and lost. At Genesis, Black Reign&#x27;s new partner, Rellik (which is &quot;Killer&quot; spelled backwards), made his debut after attacking Abyss. At Turning Point, Abyss and Raven defeated Black Reign and Rellik in a Match of 10,000 Tacks. Originally, this match was signed to be Abyss and Rhino versus Rellik and Black Reign but, due to an injury, Rhino was replaced by Raven for this match.

On &quot;Impact!&quot;, he helped Rellik beat up Kaz. Later the same night, he appeared for an interview, as Dustin Rhodes, without his Black Reign make-up and stated that his &quot;alter ego&quot; has been scaring him since when he was a little kid. His interview was interrupted by the furious Kaz. This led to a match between the two at Final Resolution where Kaz won. Reign and his partner Rellik then began feuding with Eric Young and his new superhero gimmick Super Eric. At Destination X, Black Reign and Rellik faced Eric Young and Kaz in a losing effort. At Lockdown, Black Reign and Rellik competed in a Six Team Cuffed in the Cage match which was won by Kaz and Super Eric. After three months of not showing up on television, Black Reign&#x27;s profile was removed from the TNA roster page and he was released from his TNA contract.

=== Fourth return to WWE (2008–2012) ===
==== Various appearances (2008–2009) ====

On October 26, 2008, Runnels returned to the WWE at Cyber Sunday under his Goldust persona as part of the three choices (the other two being Roddy Piper and The Honky Tonk Man) that the fans could choose to face Santino Marella for the Intercontinental Championship. After Honky Tonk Man was chosen and won via disqualification, Goldust and Piper entered the ring and the three candidates fought Marella, afterwards celebrating together in the ring. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Goldust appeared again with Piper and the Honky Tonk Man as guest commentators for Marella&#x27;s match with Charlie Haas. The match ended when Goldust and Piper distracted Marella so that Honky Tonk Man could smash his guitar over Marella&#x27;s head.

Goldust appeared on the celebration of the 800th episode of &quot;Raw&quot; on November 3, 2008, dancing alongside his father Dusty Rhodes, Lilian Garcia and several other wrestlers. A noticeably slimmer and quicker Goldust finally made a full-time return on the &quot;Raw&quot; roster once again on the November 24, 2008, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, where he defeated Santino Marella. Goldust participated in the 2009 Royal Rumble match and stared down his real-life half-brother, Cody Rhodes, but was eliminated by him later.

==== Brand switches and NXT (2009–2010) ====
The team of Goldust and Hornswoggle came to an end on June 29, 2009, when Goldust was traded to the ECW brand via a 15-man trade. His debut match for the brand came on the July 14 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, in which he lost to Zack Ryder. In the upcoming weeks, he started a feud with Sheamus leading to his first televised singles win in several months on &quot;Superstars&quot; against Sheamus pinning him using an inside cradle. After several weeks of feuding, Sheamus defeated Goldust in a &quot;No Disqualification&quot; match on the September 1 episode of &quot;ECW on Syfy&quot; to end the feud.

Following this loss, he garnered his first number one contender&#x27;s match for the ECW Championship on the September 15, 2009, episode of &quot;ECW on Syfy&quot; in a 10-Man Battle Royal where he was the seventh participant eliminated and Zack Ryder earning the title shot in the end. The September 29, 2009, episode of &quot;ECW on Syfy&quot; saw Goldust win his first match on ECW in an eight-man tag team match where Yoshi Tatsu pinned William Regal to score the win for their team. On the November 10 episode of &quot;ECW on Syfy&quot;, Goldust won his first televised singles match on the ECW brand by pinning Paul Burchill. Goldust participated in an &quot;ECW Homecoming&quot; Match on the December 22 episode of &quot;ECW on Syfy&quot; to determine who got an opportunity to challenge Christian for the ECW Championship, but was defeated by Vance Archer.

In early January, he teamed with Yoshi Tatsu and began a feud with ECW newcomers Trent Barreta and Caylen Croft. The duos exchanged victories in singles and tag team competition until the feud came to an end on the February 9 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, when Goldust and Tatsu defeated Barreta and Croft in a match to determine the number one contenders to the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship. However, Goldust and Tatsu failed in capturing the titles on the final episode of &quot;ECW on Syfy&quot;. The team of Goldust and Yoshi Tatsu came to an end when Tatsu signed with the &quot;Raw&quot; brand after &quot;ECW on SyFy&quot; was canceled.

On March 3, 2010, Goldust joined the &quot;SmackDown&quot; brand, He made his debut for the brand on the March 4 episode of &quot;Superstars&quot; in a losing effort against Chris Jericho. The following week on &quot;Superstars&quot;, he won his first match as a SmackDown star after defeating Mike Knox using his finishing move, the Final Cut, as well as beating William Regal also using the Final Cut soon afterwards. He appeared in a dark 26-man battle royal match at WrestleMania XXVI, but failed to win, although his past ally Yoshi Tatsu won.

As part of the 2010 WWE Supplemental Draft, Goldust was drafted back to the Raw brand. On the May 3 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Goldust made his re-debut for the brand in a backstage segment with the guest host for that week, Wayne Brady. In late September, a mysterious stalker was sending messages to Maryse and Ted DiBiase Jr., but it was unsure who they were aimed at. On the October 4 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Goldust was revealed as the mystery stalker, but the messages were not directed to Maryse, but at DiBiase&#x27;s Million Dollar Championship, which he then took.
During the season 2 finale of &quot;NXT&quot; on August 31, 2010, it was announced that Goldust would take part in NXT&#x27;s third season as a Pro with Aksana as his Rookie. On the October 12 episode of &quot;NXT&quot; Goldust proposed to Aksana, who was facing deportation from the country, so she could stay in America. On the October 18 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, DiBiase tried to reclaim his Million Dollar Championship after Goldust&#x27;s match with Zack Ryder by attacking him, but he was unsuccessful in retrieving his belt. At Bragging Rights, DiBiase defeated Goldust, but Goldust still left with the title after Aksana distracted DiBiase long enough for Goldust to hit his finisher on him. Goldust and Aksana were married on the November 2 episode of &quot;NXT&quot; with father Dusty Rhodes and real-life half-brother &quot;Dashing&quot; Cody Rhodes in attendance. Immediately afterwards Aksana slapped Goldust and walked out on him. The following Monday on &quot;Raw&quot; Aksana stole the Million Dollar Championship belt during Goldust&#x27;s match with Ted DiBiase. The following week on &quot;Raw&quot; Goldust managed to steal the Million Dollar Championship belt back from Aksana and then returned it to Ted DiBiase Sr., and on &quot;NXT&quot; he asked Aksana for a divorce after she was eliminated.

==== Backstage producer and departure (2011–2012) ====
On December 7, 2010, it was reported that Runnels had suffered a shoulder injury. He underwent surgery to repair the injury on December 10 and, as a result, was expected to be out of action for five to six months. On the April 11, 2011, episode of Raw, he was seen (without makeup) hugging Edge after his retirement speech. On July 11, Runnels began working backstage as a producer.

On May 6, 2012, WWE acknowledged Goldust&#x27;s departure from the company.

=== Return to the independent circuit (2012–2013) ===
Runnels returned to professional wrestling on April 11, 2012, in Port St. Lucie, Florida, for Championship Wrestling Entertainment&#x27;s event &quot;WrestleFest&quot;, defeating JD Maverick in the main event. He then wrestled on July 14, 2012, in Hollywood, Florida, for the NWA Ring Warriors (part of NWA territories) promotion as Goldust, losing to Vordell Walker via disqualification when &quot;Iceman&quot; Buck Q interfered in the match. Runnels appeared for the Dreamwave Wrestling on September 15 in LaSalle, Illinois. Runnels continued to use the Goldust name outside WWE. Runnels appeared on Mr. Chainsaw Pro Wrestling&#x27;s &quot;Battle Ground 5&quot; event on May 18, 2013, in Kalkaska, Michigan, and billed as Dustin &quot;Goldust&quot; Rhodes.

=== Fifth return to WWE (2013–2019) ===
==== Teaming with Cody Rhodes (2013–2015) ====

Runnels returned to WWE as Goldust at the Royal Rumble on January 27, 2013, as the eighth participant in the Rumble match. He was eliminated by his half-brother, Cody Rhodes, teasing a possible feud. but Goldust later confirmed that his return was a one night only deal.
When Cody was (kayfabe) fired for speaking out against chief operating officer Triple H and then losing to the WWE Champion Randy Orton, Goldust returned on the September 9 &quot;Raw&quot; to face Orton in a match to get his half-brother Cody Rhodes rehired, but was defeated. Following this, Goldust&#x27;s father Dusty Rhodes returned to WWE to ask Stephanie McMahon for Cody to be rehired. After much dialogue in which The Shield and Big Show interrupted, Stephanie McMahon gave Dusty two choices, which were to get knocked out by an unwilling Big Show or get &quot;mauled by The Shield.&quot; Big Show then knocked Dusty out and stayed with Dusty while the paramedics arrived. In return, the Rhodes brothers gatecrashed &quot;Raw&quot; by attacking the Shield. At Battleground, Cody and Goldust won their jobs back when they defeated the WWE Tag Team Champions, Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns in a non-title match. The Rhodes brothers heaped more misery on the Shield by winning a no disqualification match on the October 14 &quot;Raw&quot; (with the help of Big Show) to capture the tag titles, marking Goldust&#x27;s first title in WWE in nearly 11 years. By this point, many longtime Goldust mannerisms such as wearing a robe and platinum blonde wig to the ring were dropped in exchange for wearing a jacket similar to his brother; additionally, Goldust would now speak with his normal Texan voice. At Hell in a Cell, the Rhodes brothers&#x27; first successful title defense came with winning a triple threat match against the Usos and Rollins and Reigns. At Survivor Series, Goldust alongside his half-brother Cody, participated in the traditional Survivor Series Tag Team match where Goldust survived till the final two alongside Rey Mysterio. However, he got eliminated by Roman Reigns and his team lost. At , the Rhodes Brothers retained the title in a fatal-4-way elimination match against Curtis Axel and Ryback, The Real Americans and Big Show and Rey Mysterio, but they lost the title to New Age Outlaws (Road Dogg and Billy Gunn) at the Royal Rumble. Later in the Royal Rumble match, he would accidentally eliminate Cody Rhodes. After continuing to team together for months, Goldust and Cody broke up in June, after mounting losses. Cody prompted Goldust to find a new partner to replace him.
On the June 16 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Cody debuted a new character, &quot;Stardust&quot;, wearing face paint and a bodysuit and adopting mannerisms similar to those of Goldust. At Money in the Bank, Goldust and Stardust defeated RybAxel (Curtis Axel and Ryback). Goldust and Stardust appeared in backstage segments, speaking of a &quot;Cosmic Key&quot;. On the August 25 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Goldust and Stardust defeated The Usos in a title match via count-out, but, as a result, they did not win the title. The duo would then attack the Usos out of frustration, turning heel in the process. They confirmed their heel turn after attacking El Torito the following night on &quot;Main Event&quot;, having defeated Los Matadores in their tag team match. At Night of Champions they won the WWE Tag Team Championships once again by beating The Usos. At Hell in a Cell they retained their title by beating The Usos. At Survivor Series they lost the title to The Miz and Damien Mizdow. They had a rematch for the tag team titles the following night on Raw, but were unsuccessful.

On the February 2, 2015, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, after being defeated by The Ascension, Stardust would start to show his frustrations toward Goldust. On the February 16 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, following a loss to The New Day members Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods, Stardust would turn on Goldust by using his old finisher, Cross Rhodes on him, marking the end of Gold and Stardust, turning Goldust face in the process. This led to a match at Fastlane, where Goldust defeated Stardust. Later that night, while speaking to their father, Dusty Rhodes, Goldust would be attacked by Stardust again. At WrestleMania 31, Goldust participated in the 2nd annual André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal, where he was eliminated by Ryback. On the March 30, 2015, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Goldust lost via submission to Rusev.

In May, Goldust announced that he would undergo surgery to address a shoulder injury and that he would be out of action for 2–4 months. Goldust made an appearance at NXT TakeOver: Respect without any facepaint to congratulate Finn Bálor and Samoa Joe after they won the Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic tournament.

Goldust returned from injury at Survivor Series, competing in a 5-on-5 traditional Survivor Series elimination tag team match during the pre-show, teaming with The Dudley Boyz, Neville and Titus O&#x27;Neil, where they defeated the team of Stardust, The Ascension, The Miz and Bo Dallas. Goldust would continue feuding with his brother, Stardust, on Raw and SmackDown during the months of November and December. On the December 17 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Goldust would cost Tyler Breeze his match against O&#x27;Neil after distracting Breeze by appearing at ringside. On the December 31 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Goldust would be defeated by Breeze.

==== The Golden Truth (2016–2017) ====

In early 2016, during various episodes of &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Goldust approached R-Truth and proposed they form a tag team to no avail. At Fastlane, Goldust inadvertently cost R-Truth his match against Curtis Axel. Following Fastlane, R-Truth began to apologize and attempt to form a tag team with Goldust, with Goldust rejecting. On the March 21 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Goldust came to R-Truth&#x27;s aid after Truth was defeated by Bubba Ray Dudley. At WrestleMania 32, Goldust took part in the Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal in a losing effort. On the April 11 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Shane McMahon announced a number one contenders tournament for the WWE Tag Team Championship, which included Goldust and Truth teaming together. On the April 14 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Goldust would tell R-Truth before their match they would not team together, with Goldust instead teaming with Fandango, where they were defeated by The Vaudevillains in the first round. On the April 22 episode of Smackdown, Goldust was the special referee for the match of R-Truth and Fandango, which R-Truth won. On the May 2 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Goldust faced off against R-Truth&#x27;s new partner, Tyler Breeze, in a losing effort following a distraction from R-Truth. On the May 12 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, the two teams would face each other, with Goldust and Truth refusing to fight each other, resulting in Fandango and Breeze forming an alliance and attacking Goldust and R-Truth, with Fandango subsequently allowing Breeze to pin Goldust. On the May 16 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Goldust and Truth began teaming together, where they were defeated by the newly dubbed Breezango (Fandango and Breeze). The week after on &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Golden Truth started a losing streak, losing to the likes of Breezango and The Dudley Boyz. Golden Truth earned their first victory on the Money in the Bank pre-show after defeating Breezango.

In the 2016 WWE Draft, Goldust, along with R-Truth, was drafted to &quot;Raw&quot;. The Golden Truth later entered into a feud with The Shining Stars. On the July 25 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, The Golden Truth would enter the ring during a tag team match between Enzo and Cass and The Shining Stars, playing Pokémon Go! Over a number of months The Shining Stars would attempt to persuade R-Truth into purchasing a one-way ticket to Puerto Rico which saw Goldust continually but in and save R-Truth from being conned. On the August 1 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, The Golden Truth would be defeated by The Shining Stars. On the October 17 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, The Golden Truth were joined by Mark Henry in their feud against the Shining Stars. They would go on to defeat The Shining Stars &amp; Titus O&#x27;Neil in an 8-man tag team match on the same episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. On the October 31 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Goldust would compete in a battle royal with the winner being added to Team Raw at Survivor Series. Goldust was unsuccessful with Braun Strowman winning the battle royal and joining Team Raw in the process. The Golden Truth were later announced as members of the 10-man Survivor Series Raw Tag Team stable but later lost their spots a week later when it was revealed R-Truth had sold their spots on the team to the Shining Stars for tickets to Puerto Rico. On the November 7 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, The Shining Stars defeated The Golden Truth to join Team Raw. On the November 28 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Goldust attacked Braun Strowman after his victory over R-Truth. Sami Zayn would then run into the ring and help in attacking Strowman. At &quot;WWE Tribute to the Troops&quot; on December 14, The Golden Truth competed in a Fatal 4-Way tag team match to determine the #1 contenders to the WWE Tag Team Championship against Cesaro and Sheamus, Gallows and Anderson, and The Shining Stars, which was won by Cesaro and Sheamus.

On the March 27, 2017, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, the Golden Truth was confirmed for the 4th annual André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal at WrestleMania 33, however neither one of them was successful in winning.

On the May 8 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, The Golden Truth participated in the tag team turmoil match for the No. 1 Contenders spot against The Hardy Boyz, but lost to Cesaro and Sheamus.

Later that night, Goldust attacked R-Truth before a match against Gallows and Anderson, turning heel for the first time since 2015 and breaking up The Golden Truth.

==== Last feuds and departure (2017–2019) ====

On the August 28 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Goldust participated in the 15-man battle royal for a shot at the Intercontinental Championship. Goldust was unsuccessful though, as he was eliminated by Luke Gallows.

On the September 11 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Goldust faced Bray Wyatt in a losing effort. After the match, Wyatt used a towel to remove his facepaint, saying he was &quot;just a man&quot;, as a shot towards the face and body paint Wyatt&#x27;s rival Finn Bálor would use. The next week on &quot;Raw&quot;, under his real name and without his signature facepaint (although still using Goldust&#x27;s theme and ring attire), Rhodes faced Wyatt once again in a losing effort. Bálor ran down to help Rhodes after the match, when Wyatt continued to attack him. Rhodes, however, resented the help and attacked Bálor during a confrontation backstage on the September 25 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. He had a match against Bálor later that night, but was defeated. At Starrcade, he competed as &quot;The Natural&quot; Dustin Rhodes, defeating Dash Wilder with the bulldog.

<text>Brian Girard James (born May 20, 1969) is an American professional wrestler signed with the WWE, where he serves as the Senior Vice President of Live Events.

James was best known for his initial tenure with World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) as The Roadie from 1994 to 1995 and as &quot;Road Dogg&quot; Jesse James from 1996 to 2001. He is also known for his appearances with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) as B.G. James from 2002 to 2009, and has also made appearances for several other promotions such as Smoky Mountain Wrestling, World Championship Wrestling, the United States Wrestling Association, the Catch Wrestling Association, and World Wrestling All-Stars (WWA).

James has held numerous championships in a career spanning more than three decades. In the WWF/E, he achieved mainstream notoriety as half of The New Age Outlaws (who became part of D-Generation X): he and partner Billy Gunn won the WWF World Tag Team Championship five times, and later held the WWE Tag Team Championship once. Additionally, James found success in singles competition, becoming a one-time Intercontinental Champion and a one-time WWF Hardcore Champion.

Following his 2001 departure from the WWF, James became the inaugural WWA World Heavyweight Champion before once again finding success as a tag team wrestler in TNA, where he was a two-time National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) NWA World Tag Team Champion with Konnan and Ron Killings under the Freebird Rule as the 3 Live Kru. He twice competed for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship on pay-per-view.

WWE commentator John Layfield charted James&#x27;s transition from &quot;a cornerstone of the Attitude Era; one of its greatest stars and one of its architects&quot;, to &quot;one of the prime creative forces behind WWE&quot;. James is a second generation wrestler; his father Bob wrestled, as did his brothers Scott, Brad, and Steve. He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame (Class of 2019) as part of D-Generation X.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career (1986)===

James, under the ring name Brian Armstrong, made his professional wrestling debut on December 1, 1986, where he defeated Kevin Sullivan in a match for NWA Southeast Championship Wrestling. Following this, James put his wrestling career on hold in order to enlist in the United States Marine Corps in 1987.

===World Championship and Smoky Mountain Wrestling (1991–1995)===
Brian was mentioned on WCW programming during the WrestleWar 91 PPV on February 24, 1991, when the commentary team mentioned that Brad&#x27;s brother Brian was serving in Operation Desert Storm during a match between Brad and Bobby Eaton. Following his tour of duty, Brian wrestled his first match in five years and lost to Terrance Taylor on July 7, 1991, during the final night of World Championship Wrestling&#x27;s The Great American Bash house show tour. After completing another tour of duty, James made his debut for Smoky Mountain Wrestling on November 20, 1992, under a mask as The Dark Secret, where he lost to Tracy Smothers. As The Dark Secret, James was relegated to jobbing, as he would lose continuously in both singles and tag team matches throughout the rest of 1992 and into 1993.

Following another tour of duty, James returned to SMW on July 2, 1993, where he lost to Bobby Blaze. On July 19, James, now using the Brian Armstrong ring name, defeated Killer Kyle in a dark match. Following this, James would alternate between the Brian Armstrong and The Dark Secret ring names, where he would find success in singles and tag team matches under the former and continue to job under the latter. In addition to SMW, James returned to WCW under his Brian Armstrong ring name on the November 30 episode of &quot;Saturday Night&quot; in a losing effort to Steve Austin.

Beginning in 1994, James wrestled more frequently for WCW, including a championship match against the World Television Champion Lord Steven Regal which he lost. On the March 5, 1994 edition of the WCW Power Hour, Armstrong lost to Terra Ryzing – who would go on to become James&#x27; DX stablemate Triple H – in the latter&#x27;s debut match for the promotion. Brian wrestled primarily on television tapings, and began to team frequently with his brother Brad, albeit in losing efforts.

Meanwhile, his time in Smoky Mountain Wrestling was drawing to a close. Following a tag team match where he (as The Dark Secret) and Killer Kyle lost to The Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson) on April 4, James left SMW and began competing solely for WCW as Brian Armstrong. However, he would find little success, as his only victories were in tag team dark matches where he teamed with his brother Brad while he, along with his brothers, were relegated to being jobbers on television, with the most notable example being a rematch with Lord Steven Regal for the World Television Championship on the August 10 episode of &quot;Saturday Night&quot;. Around that time, he would adopt his signature undercut braids.

On the November 14, 1994 edition of &quot;WCW Pro&quot;, Armstrong again lost to the future Triple H, who by that time had been repackaged as Jean-Paul Lévesque. Both men left the promotion before long. James wrestled his final match for WCW on the February 17, 1995 episode of &quot;WorldWide&quot;, as he and his brothers Brad and Scott lost a six-man tag team match to The Three Faces of Fear (Kevin Sullivan, The Butcher, and Avalanche).

===World Wrestling Federation (1994–1995; 1996–2001)===

====Alliance with Jeff Jarrett (1994–1995)====
After defeating Barry Hardy in a dark match on the August 16, 1994 episode of &quot;WWF Wrestling Challenge&quot;, James signed with the World Wrestling Federation towards the end of 1994. He was billed as The Roadie, an assistant to &quot;Double J&quot; Jeff Jarrett, a would-be country singer. He wrestled on several pay-per-views and television shows, but most of his first WWF tenure was spent accompanying Jarrett and interfering in his matches. He fought against Razor Ramon and The 1-2-3 Kid. He participated in the King of the Ring 1995 tournament defeating Doink the Clown, and Bob Holly until losing to Savio Vega in the semi-finals. Roadie defeated The 1-2-3 Kid at In Your House 2: The Lumberjacks. In early 1995, Jarrett released the song &quot;With My Baby Tonight&quot;, which Jarrett claimed he had sung himself. The planned angle was to reveal that it was The Roadie, not Jarrett, who had really performed the vocals on this song, sparking a feud between the two wrestlers. Before this revelation could take place, James and Jarrett suddenly left the WWF following the second In Your House 2 pay-per-view on July 23, 1995.

After leaving the WWF, James joined the United States Wrestling Association under the ring name Jesse James Armstrong alongside Jarrett, where he won its Memphis Wrestling Southern Heavyweight Championship, USWA Television Championship, and USWA World Tag Team Championship before losing a Loser Leaves Town match to Jarrett.

====The New Age Outlaws and D-Generation X (1996–2001)====

James, without Jarrett, returned to the WWF in October 1996 under the ring name Jesse James, where he revealed himself as &quot;The Real Double J&quot; and the true singer of &quot;With My Baby Tonight&quot;. He languished as an undercard singles wrestler until beginning a feud with The Honky Tonk Man. After denying Honky Tonk Man&#x27;s offer at becoming his manager by destroying his guitar, James also began feuding with Honky Tonk Man&#x27;s protégé Rockabilly. After trading wins against each other on television and pay-per-view, James, now referring to himself as &quot;The Road Dogg&quot; Jesse James, originally spelled &quot;Jammes&quot; as a play on the way Jarrett spelled his name. (J E double S E, J A double M E S) suggested to Rockabilly that they form a tag team in order to end their unsuccessful runs as singles competitors. A change in creative direction in the WWF in late 1997 led Rockabilly to accept James&#x27; offer after subsequently attacking Honky Tonk Man with his own guitar to cement their alliance. Soon after, Rockabilly reverted to his Billy Gunn ring name and adopted the nickname &quot;Badd Ass&quot;, while Road Dogg began to grow out and braid his hair, resurrecting his old look from his days in WCW. In addition to these esthetic changes, their mannerisms became consistently more controversial and antisocial, with the team ultimately becoming known as the New Age Outlaws following their victory over The Legion of Doom for their first WWF Tag Team Championship. The Outlaws would continue to feud with the Legion of Doom and later the short-lived tag team of Cactus Jack and Chainsaw Charlie before joining D-Generation X the night after WrestleMania XIV.

The Outlaws amassed five WWF Tag Team Championship reigns and managed to become singles champions while still together, with Road Dogg and Gunn each winning the Hardcore Championship once in 1998 and 1999, respectively, while Road Dogg would also go on to win the Intercontinental Championship in 1999. The team came to an end when Gunn was legitimately injured in early 2000 and, to explain the absence needed for his recovery, Gunn was expelled from DX due to losing his temper. James then teamed with fellow DX member X-Pac throughout the summer of 2000, but failed to regain any championship success. The team eventually split, with Road Dogg and X-Pac subsequently feuding with each other before the entirety of DX fell apart. Road Dogg then formed a tag team with newcomer K-Kwik, and competed in his last televised match on December 23. He was then indefinitely suspended, and later released from his contract in January 2001, due to personal problems. On March 26, 2001, James arrived at the final &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot; taping in Panama City, Florida, in order to negotiate a return to World Championship Wrestling, only to find out that the promotion had been purchased by the WWF, thus ruling out both companies as employment options.

===Independent circuit (2001–2002)===
James would go on work the independent circuit after being fired from WWF, often no-showing scheduled appearances as a result of substance-abuse issues he was battling with at the time. On May 26, 2001, James appeared on an indy show at a high school in Conway, South Carolina where he was supposed to wrestle against The Barbarian for the main event. During that event, James was signing autographs and taking Polaroids during intermission, and became belligerent after being asked to leave the gymnasium when the intermission ended and matches were going on. James became irritated, started swearing and refused to leave. Police came and arrested him. He was charged for disorderly conduct.

He also worked for IWA Mid-South. Then James worked for the short-lived World Wrestling All-Stars (WWA) promotion in Australia with former WWF and WCW wrestlers. On October 23, 2001, he defeated former WWF colleague and tag team partner Jeff Jarrett for the vacant WWA World Heavyweight Champion where he was the inaugural champion. He dropped the title to Jarrett three days later. He continued feuding with Jarrett and Scott Steiner.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2002–2009)===

====3 Live Kru (2002–2005)====

James debuted for the Total Nonstop Action Wrestling promotion on September 18, 2002, wrestling as B.G. James, as the Road Dogg gimmick was owned by WWE. He was initially a heel and one of the founding members of Vince Russo&#x27;s Sports Entertainment Xtreme faction.

In 2003, James formed the stable known as the 3 Live Kru alongside Konnan and Ron Killings. The stable was popular from the outset and, as a nod to James&#x27; and Killings&#x27; brief tag team in the World Wrestling Federation, they sang their own entrance music as they approached the ring. In addition to popularity, the Kru found championship success as well, as Killings won his second and final NWA World Heavyweight Championship as a member while all three men held the NWA World Tag Team Championship twice under the Freebird Rule.

Tension arose when James&#x27; former partner Billy Gunn joined TNA as The New Age Outlaw (later shortened to The Outlaw) in 2005. The Outlaw repeatedly courted James, seeking to split the Kru and recreate the New Age Outlaws. When The Outlaw began feuding with the Kru, James repeatedly found his loyalties divided, unwilling to fight either his former or current tag team partners. For a time, James stopped appearing with the Kru but did not align himself with The Outlaw, who had by then changed his name to Kip James as a &quot;tribute&quot; to James&#x27; father. At Sacrifice, he reasserted his allegiance with 3 Live Kru as the special guest referee in a match between the other members of 3LK and the team of Kip James and Monty Brown. Kip tried to warm up to 3LK again in the lead-up to Bound for Glory by saving James several times from Team Canada. At Bound for Glory, he offered his protective services to them against Team Canada to neutralize Scott D&#x27;Amore. When they lost, Kip came down to the ring, appearing ready to hit Konnan with a steel chair since he originally vetoed Kip&#x27;s offer. Kip instead saved Konnan from Team Canada, thus proving his original intentions.

On the November 26 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, James brought Kip and the 3LK to the ring and asked Killings and Konnan to give Kip a yes/no vote to be accepted into the group. After James got heated with Konnan, both gave Kip yes votes and the 4 Live Kru was born. The 4 Live Kru was short lived as Konnan, still apparently upset at Kip&#x27;s induction into the Kru, hit both James and Kip over the head with a steel chair at Turning Point. Konnan, still wanting Killings to be his &quot;family&quot;, tried talking with Killings. Killings told Konnan that he was done with the Kru and wanted to leave it all behind him.

====James Gang/Voodoo Kin Mafia (2006–2008)====

After the incident, James and Kip regrouped, reformed their old tag team as The James Gang, and feuded with Konnan&#x27;s new stable, The Latin American Xchange (LAX), which he formed with Homicide and Apolo. Apolo was sent home from Against All Odds after complaining about being used as a jobber and was quickly replaced by a relative unknown named Machete.

On a subsequent edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, James&#x27; real life father &quot;Bullet&quot; Bob Armstrong informed The James Gang that he was sick of the shenanigans of LAX and how they always used strength in numbers to their advantage. He informed them that he was going to see Larry Zbyszko to have himself added to the Destination X match as their partner, effectively making it a three-man tag team. &quot;Bullet&quot; was in fact added to the team and they won the match at Destination X. The following month, an arm wrestling match was booked between Armstrong and Konnan, where the losing team would get hit ten times with a leather whip. Armstrong prevailed with the victory, resulting in LAX being whipped several times upon trying to scramble out of the cage for survival.

Following their feud with LAX, James and Kip began feuding with Team 3D. The two teams cut promos arguing over their long-term histories with past promotions such as World Wrestling Entertainment and Extreme Championship Wrestling. The rivalry came to a head at Sacrifice when The James Gang beat Team 3D using a lead pipe. The James Gang and Team 3D feuded throughout the summer. They were scheduled for a number one contendership match at Hard Justice but, due to a fire, the match was canceled. The match was rescheduled for &quot;Impact!&quot;, which the Gang lost.

On the November 2, 2006 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Kip and James announced that they were going to quit TNA. While attempting to speak about it, their microphones were cut off. When the show returned, the announcers speculated that they may have been frustrated due to the influx of new talent entering TNA. It was later reported that the segment was a worked shoot that Vince Russo had written in order to renew interest upon their eventual return.

On the November 16 airing of &quot;Impact!&quot;, The James Gang announced that they would now be known as Voodoo Kin Mafia (VKM) (a pun on the name Vincent Kennedy McMahon). They spent their airtime bashing McMahon and both members of D-Generation X, using their real names: Paul Levesque and Michael Hickenbottom. After calling Triple H &quot;Triple Hollywood&quot; and Shawn Michaels &quot;Shawn Kiss-My-Bottom&quot;, VKM claimed they were declaring war on DX and Vincent Kennedy McMahon. On the November 23 airing of &quot;Impact!&quot;, they drove around searching for their targets, but they ended up arriving at a Target store. At the end of the episode, VKM argued, and Kip pointed straight ahead to the WWE World Headquarters, which prompted James to respond, &quot;We&#x27;re back!&quot; In 2006, as acknowledged by TNA&#x27;s website, VKM accepted The Hardys&#x27; open challenge to a match at December to Dismember. WWE never acknowledged their acceptance, however. Over the following weeks, VKM aired several more videos bashing DX and Vince McMahon. They also made a $1 million challenge to DX as announced on the TNA website. They declared &quot;victory&quot; at Final Resolution, after receiving no answer from WWE. In early 2007, however, James said in a shoot interview along with his tag team partner Kip that he would jump back to WWE if he could get out of his TNA contract and get a WWE offer.

On August 4, James returned to the Boston-based Millennium Wrestling Federation&#x27;s Soul Survivor IV wrestling event and fanfest. James worked for the promotion when it opened in 2001, but no-showed a benefit for Superstar Billy Graham in 2002 due to his drug and personal issues. MWF subsequently brought the legitimate situation into a storyline. Despite this, James teamed with Beau Douglas to win the promotion&#x27;s Tag Team Championship from the Canadian Superstars (J-Busta and Dave Cole). During a pre-event question and answer session, James went into his hatred of Jim Ross and his feelings that WWE ruins families and lives. James and Douglas lost the title back to the Canadians on October 27, 2007, at a Special Olympics fundraiser in Salem, Massachusetts. After five years of bad blood, James made peace with the MWF&#x27;s promoter Dan Mirade for sabotaging the Graham benefit and agreed to return in the future.

At Turning Point, James won one of the cases in the Feast or Fired match, which was later revealed to contain a contract for a TNA World Tag Team Championship match. Instead of teaming with Kip, he chose his father &quot;Bullet&quot; Bob Armstrong to be his tag team partner. B.G. and Bullet Bob lost their title match against A.J. Styles and Tomko in the opening match of Against All Odds. He and Kip had turned face but on the February 21, 2008 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Kip turned on James and Armstrong by hitting them both with a crutch, turning heel in the process. At Lockdown, he finally defeated Kip in a six-sides of steel match.

====Sporadic appearances and departure (2008–2009)====
At Final Resolution, James returned to TNA television for the first time in months and participated in the Feast or Fired Match, which was won by Curry Man, Homicide, Hernandez, and Jay Lethal. James was also seen on &quot;Impact!&quot; two weeks later as he was trying to hold back Jeff Jarrett from fighting Kurt Angle. The week afterwards, he was punched by Angle while he and Jarrett were fighting. On the January 8, 2009 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, James faced off against Angle, but lost via submission due to Angle&#x27;s ankle lock.

On September 15, 2009, James was released from his TNA contract.

===Return to independent circuit (2009–2011)===
Upon leaving TNA, James returned to the independent circuit and resumed using his Jesse James ring name. On January 30, 2010, he teamed with Dysfunction to defeat Mason Quinn and J-Ca$h, who substituted for Quinn&#x27;s tag team partner Dave Demone, to win the All-Star Championship Wrestling Tag Team Championship for the first time. On May 1, James lost his half of the title when Dysfunction picked Quinn as his new partner when Dysfunction and Quinn scored a double pin against each other during a title defense. On April 19, James resumed using his Road Dogg name and reformed the New Age Outlaws with Billy Gunn to compete in the Canadian Wrestling&#x27;s Elite promotion.

On May 28, James appeared at One Pro Wrestling&#x27;s event The Last Stand, where he teamed with Kevin Nash in an unsuccessful attempt at winning the Tag Team Championship.

=== Return to WWE ===

==== Sporadic appearances (2011–2012) ====
On April 2, 2011, James returned to WWE for the first time in over a decade to induct his father &quot;Bullet&quot; Bob Armstrong into the company&#x27;s Hall of Fame. Several months later, James announced on October 11 via his Facebook account that he re-signed with WWE as a producer, and would return to the company in his new role on October 23 at the Vengeance pay-per-view. After a ten-year-long absence, James returned to WWE television on the December 12 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; under his Road Dogg ring name to present CM Punk with the Slammy Award for &quot;Pipe Bomb&quot; of the Year.

On January 29, 2012, Road Dogg entered the Royal Rumble match as the twenty-third entrant and lasted nearly five minutes before being eliminated by Wade Barrett. Following this, he began hosting the WWE.com and YouTube web series &quot;Are You Serious?&quot; alongside Josh Mathews. On July 23, Road Dogg reunited with Billy Gunn, Sean Waltman, Shawn Michaels and Triple H to reform D-Generation X for one night only on the 1000th episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. On the December 17 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, he and Billy Gunn appeared together as the New Age Outlaws and presented the Slammy Award for Comeback of the Year to Jerry Lawler.

==== New Age Outlaws reunion (2013–2014) ====
On the March 4, 2013 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Road Dogg and Billy Gunn made their in-ring return as the New Age Outlaws with a victory over Primo and Epico. A week later, the New Age Outlaws competed against Team Rhodes Scholars, but the match was rendered a no contest after Brock Lesnar interrupted and performed an &quot;F-5&quot; to both Outlaws as part of his ongoing feud with Triple H. On the December 9 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, the New Age Outlaws appeared to present the Slammy Award for LOL Moment of the Year.
On the January 6, 2014 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, the New Age Outlaws saved CM Punk from an assault by The Shield and later stood in Punk&#x27;s corner during his match against Roman Reigns. Later that week on &quot;SmackDown&quot;, they teamed alongside Punk to face The Shield in a six-man tag team match, although they were defeated after Gunn was pinned by Reigns. On the January 13 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, the New Age Outlaws and Punk faced The Shield in a rematch before abandoning Punk as he was about to tag them, turning both Outlaws heel in the process for the first time in over a decade. Later that week on &quot;SmackDown&quot;, the New Age Outlaws defeated the WWE Tag Team Champions Cody Rhodes and Goldust in a non-title match. On January 26 at the Royal Rumble kickoff show, the New Age Outlaws defeated Rhodes and Goldust to win their first WWE Tag Team Championship and sixth tag team title in WWE overall. They held the title until the March 3 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, where they were defeated by The Usos. After losing the title, the Outlaws allied with Kane as part of The Authority to face The Shield at WrestleMania XXX, but they were defeated.

====Producing and writing, executive role (2014–present)====
Following WrestleMania XXX, James resumed his role as a producer while Gunn resumed his role as a trainer in NXT. On the January 19, 2015 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, the New Age Outlaws returned alongside The Acolytes Protection Agency and the New World Order to confront and ultimately drive off The Ascension after they had been disrespecting tag teams from the past. Six days later, the Outlaws challenged The Ascension at the Royal Rumble, but were defeated. at WrestleMania 31, Road Dogg and the rest of D-Generation X (X-Pac and Billy Gunn) did a run in during Triple H&#x27;s match against Sting which resulted in a brawl with the NWO (Hogan, Hall and Nash) at ringside. In December 2016 it was reported that James was going to be working on the writing team on &quot;SmackDown&quot;, and would be groomed for a bigger position. This led to James working as a producer and writer on &quot;SmackDown&quot;. He would later be promoted to one of the lead writers.

In January 2018, James made a one night return to Raw 25 Years, as part of the D-Generation X reunion. Later on at the show, they celebrated with the Balor Club, after attacking The Revival. James would later appear in the 2018 WWE Hall of Fame ceremony to induct Jeff Jarrett. On the January 28, 2019 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Road Dogg made a surprise appearance, where he joined Jeff Jarrett in interrupting Elias, and the two sang &quot;With My Baby Tonight&quot; until they were both attacked by Elias, with both Road Dogg and Jarrett being smashed with a guitar. On the February 4, 2019 edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, he was in Jarrett&#x27;s corner for his first match in WWE for 19 years against Elias. After Elias won the match, he attacked him from behind to set up a guitar shot from Jarrett. On April 7, 2019, Dogg was inducted in the WWE Hall of Fame as part of D-Generation X.

After WrestleMania 35, it was reported Dogg resigned as head writer of &quot;SmackDown Live&quot;. It was later clarified that James will remain with the company and is currently seen as a &quot;utility player&quot;. From May 2019 to January 2022, he held a position at the WWE Performance Center in which he taught classes on in-ring promos and character development. He was released by WWE in January 2022, but was rehired as Senior Vice President of Live Events in August 2022, replacing Jeff Jarrett.

On January 23, 2023, Road Dogg, along with D-Generation X and Kurt Angle, made an appearance at Raw&#x27;s 30th anniversary, Raw is XXX. They were interrupted by Imperium during their reunion. Beginning with the episode broadcast on February 1, 2024, Road Dogg served as color commentator on &quot;WWE Main Event&quot;, under his birth name of Brian James.

==Personal life==
James is a second-generation wrestler and the youngest brother of the Armstrong wrestling family: his father, Bob, wrestled, as did his brothers Scott, Brad, and Steve. Scott worked at WWE as a referee.

Like his father, James served in the United States Marine Corps. His tenure lasted from 1987 to 1993 and he fought in Operation Desert Storm in 1991, where he was a platoon sergeant in command of thirty-three Marines. James is married to Tracy James, with three children and a grandchild.

James is a longtime Pittsburgh Steelers fan, and owns a jersey of former tight end Jesse James.

James admits to having had problems with drugs and alcohol throughout his life. He began taking painkillers during his time in D-Generation X. After being suspended and then released from the WWF, he successfully underwent rehabilitation.

On March 26, 2021, after returning from Orlando, James suffered an apparent heart attack and was hospitalized. He saw his kidney specialist and had a stress test done, and had also been taking medications for high blood pressure.

<text>The Naval History and Heritage Command, formerly the Naval Historical Center, is an Echelon II command responsible for the preservation, analysis, and dissemination of U.S. naval history and heritage located at the historic Washington Navy Yard. The NHHC is composed of 42 facilities in 13 geographic locations including the Navy Department Library, 10 museums and 1 heritage center, USS &quot;Constitution&quot; repair facility and detachment, and historic ship ex-USS &quot;Nautilus&quot;.

==Command history==
The Naval History and Heritage Command traces its lineage to 1800, when President John Adams requested Benjamin Stoddert, the first Secretary of the Navy, prepare a catalog of professional books for use in the Secretary&#x27;s office. When the British invaded Washington in 1814, this collection, containing the finest works on naval history from America and abroad, was rushed to safety outside the Federal City. After that, the library had many locations, including a specially designed space in the State, War, and Navy Building (now the Indian Treaty Room of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building) next to the White House.

When the library was placed under the Bureau of Navigation in 1882, the director, noted international lawyer and U.S. Naval Academy professor James R. Soley, gathered the rare books scattered throughout Navy Department offices, collected naval prints and photographs, and subscribed to professional periodicals. He also began collecting and preserving naval records, particularly those of the American Civil War. Congress initially recognized his efforts by authorizing funds for office staff and combining the library and records sections into the Office of Library and Naval War Records.

Six years later, the United States Congress appropriated the funds to print the first volume in a monumental documentary series, &quot;Official Records of the Union and Confederate Navies in the War of the Rebellion&quot;. Completed in 1927 with the publication of volume 31, the series marked the beginning of a commitment to collect, edit, and publish historical naval documents, a mission that the History Command continues to carry out in its American Revolution and War of 1812 documentary projects. In 1915, the appropriations for publications, the library, and naval war records were combined. The office received a new title—Office of Naval Records and Library.

Once America entered World War I, the emphasis shifted to gathering documents on current naval operations. Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels directed Admiral William S. Sims, Commander U.S. Naval Forces Operating in European Waters, to collect war diaries, operational reports, and other historic war materials of naval commands in his London headquarters.

To handle World War I records in Washington, a Historical Section was established in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations and housed in the new Navy Department (&quot;Main Navy&quot;) Building on Constitution Avenue. When the war ended, Admiral Sims&#x27; London collection and photographs and new motion pictures from the various Navy bureaus were transferred to the Historical Section. Holding more than 50,000 volumes, the library remained in the State, War, and Navy Building.

In 1921, a former member of Admiral Sims&#x27; wartime staff, Captain Dudley W. Knox, was named head of the Office of Naval Records and Library and the Historical Section. For the next twenty-five years, he was the driving force behind the Navy&#x27;s historical program, earning for the office an international reputation in the field of naval archives and history. The Historical Section was absorbed into Naval Records and Library in 1927. Knox&#x27;s additional appointment as the Curator for the Navy envisioned a display of the nation&#x27;s sea heritage in a naval museum in Washington. In 1961, Admiral Arleigh Burke, Chief of Naval Operations, established the U.S. Naval Historical Display Center (now the United States Navy Museum).

At President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s suggestion, Knox began several documentary series. Seven volumes on the Quasi War with France and six volumes relating to the war with the Barbary Powers were ultimately published. World War II halted plans for similar publications on the American Revolution, the War of 1812, the Mexican–American War, and World War I. During World War II, Knox turned his attention to collecting documents generated by naval operations in the global conflict. He immediately began a campaign to gather and arrange operation plans, action reports, and war diaries into well-controlled archives staffed by professional historians who came on board as naval reservists.

To complement the developing World War II operational archives, the Knox group pioneered an oral history program. Participants in the significant Atlantic and Pacific operations and battles were interviewed as soon as possible after their wartime engagements. When Pulitzer Prize winner and Harvard history professor Samuel Eliot Morison was commissioned by President Roosevelt to prepare the fifteen-volume &quot;History of United States Naval Operations in World War II&quot;, he relied not only on his own combat experience but also on those records assembled in Knox&#x27;s archives.

In 1944, Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal established the Office of Naval History to coordinate the Morison project, as well as the wartime administrative histories being written by Navy commands, under the direction of Princeton professor Robert G. Albion. Knox served as deputy director of Naval History under the Director, Admiral Edward C. Kalbfus, but the Office of Naval Records and Library at first remained separate until March 1949 when it merged with the Office of Naval History to form the Naval Records and History Division of the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations. In 1952 it was renamed the Naval History Division.

The eventual home for the Navy&#x27;s historians was the Washington Navy Yard in Southeast Washington, which in 1961 was converted from an industrial facility to an administrative center. The first component of the Naval History Division in the yard was the Navy Museum (later the United States Navy Museum), established in 1961. In 1963, the Operational Archives moved to the Navy Yard. The other sections of the Naval History Division followed in 1970, occupying several scattered buildings.

An organizational change in 1971 shifted the Naval History Division from a headquarters establishment to a field activity called the Naval Historical Center, under the Chief of Naval Operations. Most of the center&#x27;s activities were brought together in 1982 when they moved into the historic building complex named to honor Dudley W. Knox, who perhaps did more than any other individual to strengthen the Navy&#x27;s commitment to its historical heritage and traditions.

In 1986, the Navy Art Collection and Gallery and the Naval Aviation History and Publication Division, both already located in the Washington Navy Yard, became part of the Naval Historical Center.

2008 was a year of change for the Navy&#x27;s history program. First, the command was streamlined into four major components: Histories and Archives, Museums and Collections, Integration and Outreach, and Operations. Following the realignment of the Navy&#x27;s dozen museums under the Director of Naval History, the Naval Historical Center was redesignated the Naval History &amp; Heritage Command on 1 December 2008. In the spring of 2009, the NHHC established a presence on the social media sites Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Goodreads, and Delicious.

==Navy Reserve units==

===Naval Reserve Combat Documentation Detachment 206===
Assigned to the History Command since 1991, the unit deploys its teams to U.S. Navy, joint, and combined commands worldwide where they conduct oral history interviews, collect historically significant artifacts and records, and document operations through photography and art. Their collection effort contributes to the Navy&#x27;s lessons learned and preserves the history of current naval operations during crisis response, wartime, declared national emergency, or in situations as directed. Teams have documented the Navy&#x27;s role in the Persian Gulf War, Operation Restore Hope (Haiti) and Operation Allied Force (Kosovo); counter-narcotics actions in the Caribbean; fleet exercises, special warfare activities, Information Technology (IT-21); the attack on, and the rebuilding of USS &quot;Cole&quot; (DDG-67); the 11 September 2001 attack on the Pentagon; and the Global War on Terrorism. In 2001 eleven unit members were recalled to active duty to support the History Command&#x27;s documentation collection efforts related to Operation Noble Eagle and Operation Enduring Freedom. For Operation Iraqi Freedom and in support of the Navy&#x27;s Task Force History, four unit members were recalled to active duty.

===Naval Reserve Naval History Volunteer Training Unit 0615===
This non-pay Naval Reserve unit provides project support to the Naval History &amp; Heritage Command in keeping with the larger goal of enhancing the Navy&#x27;s effectiveness by preserving, analyzing, and interpreting its history and heritage. Unit members work on long-term historical projects with the NHC staff, processing archival collections, conducting oral history interviews with Pearl Harbor survivors, and digitizing histories for the Command&#x27;s website or publication in print. VTU members also conduct end-of-tour interviews with key naval leaders.

<text>Jacques Rougeau Jr. (born June 13, 1960) is a Canadian former professional wrestler best known for his appearances in the 1980s and 1990s with the World Wrestling Federation. He began his career under his real name as half of the tag team The Fabulous Rougeaus with his brother Raymond Rougeau. In 1991, he began a singles career as the Mountie, winning the WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship once. In 1993, he formed three time WWF Tag Team Championship winning tag team The Quebecers with Pierre Ouellet.

==Professional wrestling career==
At least three of Jacques&#x27; family members were wrestling promoters and/or wrestled themselves: his older brother Ray, his father Jacques Sr., and his uncle Jean &quot;Johnny&quot; Rougeau. Jacques&#x27; sister Johanne also promoted wrestling matches in Montreal, and brother Armand wrestled for smaller federations.

=== Early career (1977–1985) ===
Jacques Rougeau began his career in 1977, working in Stu Hart&#x27;s Calgary, Alberta based Stampede Wrestling promotion. In the 1980s he began wrestling in the United States, achieving success in Alabama and Tennessee, and in 1985 he and Ray were signed by the World Wrestling Federation.

===World Wrestling Federation (1986–1994)===

====Fabulous Rougeaus (1986–1990)====
Jacques debuted in the WWE (then WWF) on February 26, 1986, during the Australian leg of the company&#x27;s &quot;International Tour,&quot; in a losing effort against Moondog Rex. Raymond, who was victorious in his debut match against Moondog Spot the same night, debuted alongside Jacques 6 days later, winning their debut match as the &quot;Fabulous Rougeaus&quot; against the Moondogs.In their first year in the WWE, the Fabulous Rougeaus claimed tag-team victories against The Hart Foundation (Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart), The Moondogs, Jimmy Jack and Dory Funk Jr., and The Dream Team (Greg Valentine and Brutus Beefcake).

Although they lost their match at WrestleMania III in 1987 to Valentine and Beefcake, they briefly upset The Hart Foundation for the WWF Tag Team Championship at the Montreal Forum on August 10 that year. The decision was reversed to a disqualification and the championship returned, since the challengers initially won after using Jimmy Hart&#x27;s megaphone as a weapon.

After two years in the Federation, The Fabulous Rougeaus turned heel. The Canadian brothers began being announced as &quot;From Canada, but soon to relocate to the United States&quot; and debuted an intentionally annoying entrance song, in which they sang (partly in French) about being &quot;All-American Boys&quot; and their manager, Jimmy Hart. They were also briefly billed from Memphis, Hart&#x27;s home city. They mockingly waved tiny American flags to the chagrin of many American fans. They would humorously attempt to start &quot;USA!&quot; chants, which led to further negative fan &quot;heat&quot;. According to Jacques, the widespread antipathy of American fans inspired Vince McMahon to turn them into heels. They feuded with The Killer Bees, The Hart Foundation (who had turned face in between), The Bushwhackers, and The Rockers during their heel run.

====The Mountie (1991–1992)====
Ray Rougeau retired in early 1990, ending his tag-team partnership with Jacques. Jacques departed the Federation for a year before redebuting in January 1991, once again alongside Jimmy Hart. The Mountie character was that of a corrupt, cattle prod-wielding member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, who often boasted that he &quot;always gets his man&quot; (a phrase long associated with the RCMP, which insinuated that criminals cannot escape from Canada&#x27;s federal police force). The cattle prod came into play as part of The Mountie&#x27;s post-match gimmick, where he would handcuff, berate and then &quot;shock&quot; his defeated and helpless opponents in the stomach. The story of the character change was that Jacques Rougeau had actually gone through the training to become a Mountie to wield authority. The character was eventually the subject of litigation in Canada, preventing Rougeau from performing as The Mountie in his home country. Thus, while wrestling in Canada, he was billed using only his real name and did not wear his Mountie-inspired hat and jacket to the ring, although he did retain other parts of his costume such as red shirt, black pants, and boots.

The Mountie made his in-ring debut in January 1991. In his pay-per-view debut, he defeated Koko B. Ware at the 1991 Royal Rumble. He gained another major victory at WrestleMania VII, defeating Tito Santana after using the shock stick. The Mountie began a feud with the Big Boss Man after declaring that he was the sole legitimate law enforcer in the WWF, and on August 26, 1991, he spent a night in prison (kayfabe) after Bossman defeated him in a Jailhouse Match at SummerSlam. At the 1991 Survivor Series, Mountie teamed with Ric Flair, Ted DiBiase and The Warlord to defeat Roddy Piper, Bret Hart, Virgil and Davey Boy Smith in a four-on-four Survivor Series elimination match.

The Mountie&#x27;s greatest achievement as a singles wrestler came when he won the WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship in an upset over Bret Hart on January 17, 1992. In the storyline, Hart was suffering from the flu (Hart was actually going through contract negotiations). The Mountie lost the title just two days later to Rowdy Roddy Piper at the 1992 Royal Rumble, in what was one of the shortest Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship reigns. The Mountie received a rematch at the February 8 &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXX&quot;, but when he attempted to use his shock stick, it had no effect as Piper was wearing a rubber vest under his T-shirt. Piper removed his shirt after the match to reveal the vest, which was labeled &quot;Shock Proof&quot;. Piper won the match after using the shock stick on The Mountie.

For the next several months, The Mountie primarily appeared in the undercard. He was on the losing end of an eight-man tag team match at WrestleMania VIII and a six-man tag team match at SummerSlam. He feuded with Sgt. Slaughter after shocking him with an extra large cattle prod on an episode of &quot;Superstars&quot;, though the subsequent matches all took place on house shows that summer, with no conclusion on television. After losing to then WWF World Heavyweight Champion Bret Hart in seventy-five seconds on October 26, 1992, Rougeau left the WWF.

====The Quebecers (1993–1994)====

Jacques returned to the WWF in July 1993. Shortly thereafter, Rougeau began tagging with Pierre Ouellet as The Quebecers. The team, who feuded with Steiner Brothers, Men on a Mission, The Headshrinkers, and Marty Jannetty and The 1–2–3 Kid, were three-time WWF Tag Team Champions. The Quebecers characters were an extension of the earlier Mountie-theme, albeit with a more casual costume and an emphasis on bullying behavior. The pair (who were managed by Johnny Polo) emphasized their detachment from the earlier Mountie controversy by using a doctored version of Jacques&#x27;s second Mountie theme song, titled &quot;We&#x27;re Not The Mounties&quot;, with the lyrics modified to insult the RCMP - for example, &quot;because the Mountie always gets his man&quot; became &quot;unlike the Mounties, we always get our man&quot;. Jacques participated in the main event of the 1993 Survivor Series as a member of the &quot;Foreign Fanatics&quot; team. At the Royal Rumble, The Quebecers defeated Bret Hart and Owen Hart by referee stoppage to retain the WWF Tag Team Championship. At WrestleMania X, The Quebecers faced Men on a Mission for the WWF Tag Team Championship and retained after getting counted out. They lost the title to Men on a Mission in an unplanned title change at a house show on March 29, 1994, in London, England. Mabel stunned Pierre who couldn&#x27;t kick out as he was supposed to. The wrong was righted as they won the belts back on March 31 at another house show. They lost the championship to The Headshrinkers on the April 26 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; and split up soon after.

The Quebecers broke up at a house show in the Montreal Forum on June 25, 1994. After a loss to The Headshrinkers, Pierre and Polo turned on Rougeau. After a few minutes of Jacques being attacked in front of his hometown crowd, Raymond Rougeau (who by this point was an announcer for the WWF&#x27;s French-language broadcasts) ran to the ring to save his brother. This angle led to Jacques Rougeau&#x27;s first retirement match, which, over the next few months, was heavily promoted on WWF TV shows broadcast in the Montreal area and in the local media. The match, held on October 21, 1994, drew a sell-out crowd of 16,843 to the Montreal Forum, and resulted in a victory for Jacques, when he pinned Pierre following a seated tombstone piledriver. Jacques, who was accompanied by Raymond, used Queen&#x27;s song &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; as his theme music for the night.

===World Championship Wrestling (1996–1997)===

On September 9, 1996, Rougeau came out of retirement reuniting with Ouellet as they debuted as The Amazing French Canadians in World Championship Wrestling in a losing effort against The Nasty Boys. In 1997, Jacques became one of few wrestlers to cleanly defeat then-WCW Heavyweight Champion Hollywood Hogan, claiming a singles victory at the Molson Centre in Montreal. On the &quot;Right After Wrestling&quot; program on Sirius Satellite Radio Channel 98, Jacques told hosts Arda Ocal and Jimmy Korderas that Hogan put him over because of his respect for the Rougeau family name and for keeping a clean wrestling image. On Colt Cabana&#x27;s &quot;Art of Wrestling&quot; podcast, Rougeau&#x27;s former student, Kevin Owens stated that there is a rumor that Hogan lay down for Rougeau for an additional $10,000 payment. Rougeau said that he paid and organized the show, so it was a Jacques Rougeau show, not a WCW show.

===Return to WWF (1998)===
In January 1998, Rougeau returned to the WWF for a final run teaming once again with Pierre Ouellet in an updated version of The Quebecers. This incarnation of the team still used the ring attire from their WCW run as the Amazing French Canadians. The team were also one of the 14 tag teams eliminated in the tag team battle royal at WrestleMania XIV, leading to a win for the Legion of Doom. Rougeau teamed up with his brother, Ray (who at the time was a commentator, announcer and host for the French-produced WWF programming) alongside Ouellet in a dark match for &quot;WWF Shotgun Saturday Night&quot; where they defeated the team of Edge, Shawn Stasiak, and Tom Brandi. They failed to achieve the same success they enjoyed during their prior run, with their only notable feud being with The Godwinns, where the Godwinns went over. Both Rougeau and Ouellet left the WWF in August 1998.

===Later career and retirement (1998–2018)===
After WWF, Rougeau was the promoter for the Montreal-based Lutte International 2000 were he wrestled on occasion.

Rougeau and Ouellet briefly reunited in WCW in 2000 in Lance Storm&#x27;s Team Canada. After WCW, Rougeau and Ouellet went their separate ways.

Rougeau continued working in his promotion until wrestling his last match on December 27, 2011 with his son Jean-Jacques as they defeated Kurrgan and Frank The Machine in Repentigny, Quebec. After his last match, Rougeau decided to close down Lutte International 2000.

After retiring, Rougeau attempted to join the Montreal Police Department, but was unable to do so as he had not graduated from high school. He is now a public speaker, touring schools to speak on drugs, smoking, and bullying. He opened the Rougeau Wrestling School in Montreal in 1998.

In 2018, Rougeau announced that he would retire for a third time, and that he had closed his wrestling school. On August 18, 2018, shortly after his retirement announcement, Rougeau mirrored his father&#x27;s retirement matching by teaming with his sons for the first and only time. As Rougeau&#x27;s sons, all of whom have wrestled, have expressed no desire to return to wrestling, Jacques&#x27; retirement effectively ended the Rougeau family wrestling dynasty after more than six decades.

==Personal life==
Rougeau is divorced from Nathalie Thibodeau, whom he married in 1978. He and Thibodeau had three sons: Cedric, Emile, and Jean-Jacques. Former NHL ice hockey defenceman Denis Gauthier is Rougeau&#x27;s nephew.

<text>The art world comprises everyone involved in producing, commissioning, presenting, preserving, promoting, chronicling, criticizing, buying and selling fine art. It is recognized that there are many art worlds, defined either by location or alternative definitions of fine art. Some may use the singular &quot;art world&quot; to refer only to the elite level of globalized fine art. The art world(s) are continually changing in response both to the creativity of those that create art and in response to social change.

==History==
Rather than being a term coined in the 20th century, &quot;art world&quot; can be found in publications from the 19th century. The emergence of many of the elements, such as galleries, critics, and museums; as well as the term &quot;fine arts&quot; (&quot;Beaux Arts&quot;) date from the 18th century.

==Sociological definition==
An art world, as with any segment of society, is defined in terms of mutually understood conventions (social norms, roles, and institutions) that are the basis for cooperative activity between members of a group who may not interact directly.

Howard S. Becker describes an art world as &quot;the network of people whose cooperative activity, organized via their joint knowledge of conventional means of doing things, produces the kind of art works that art world is noted for.&quot; Becker admits this definition is tautological, but is useful in understanding how works of art are produced and consumed.

Sarah Thornton, also a sociologist, describes the art world as &quot;a loose network of overlapping subcultures held together by a belief in art&quot;. They span the globe but cluster in art capitals such as New York City, London, Los Angeles, and Berlin.

==Roles in the art world==
===Production===
There are a number of roles for those actively involved in the creation of new works of fine art, but the exemplar remains the lone artist or a close collaboration. Historically, art was produced by the members of a workshop, often a master and a number of journeymen and apprentices. Contemporary artists allude to this group practice in their establishment of studio workshops or &quot;factories&quot;, or by having works fabricated by industrial methods according to their plans and specifications. Some works, being of monumental scale, cannot be executed in any other way. In most of these group practices, the authenticity associated with fine art is maintained by the artist either doing the essential work, closely supervising others, and giving final approval to the finished piece by signing it.

Artwork by women was largely excluded from the highest levels of the art world until the feminist movement of the 1970s.

The primary socialization of individuals into the role of artists is by attendance at art school. The value of contemporary art depends upon the reputation of the artist, which most often begins with earning an MFA from a select number of art school programs. Some self-taught or outsider artists may gain recognition by being discovered by a dealer, while others are denied inclusion.

===Distribution===

The production of art depends upon its distribution to others in order to provide the economic support of that production. In the past, this was done through patronage or commissions from collectors. Artists may also do this themselves either by direct sales or through cooperative efforts. Contemporary art is most often distributed though intermediaries.

An art dealer is the intermediary between artists, private collectors and institutional buyers. While some dealers may be consultant advising individual clients, dealers usually own or operate art galleries. Hosting public exhibitions and opening celebrations became part of the social function of the art world in addition to their marketing functions.

The international art fair, occurring typically every two years, has become a major force in the marketing of contemporary fine art. Commercial art fairs are essentially temporary galleries that benefit from the attraction of public interest and competition between collectors. One of the most successful, Art Basel originated in Switzerland in the 1970s, expanded to Miami in 2000 and Hong Kong in 2010. Art Basel built on the model of Art Cologne, the first fair sponsored by and for commercial galleries; in contrast to the government sponsored world&#x27;s fairs that began in the Victorian era. One of the latter, the Venice Biennale founded in 1895, continues to operate as a public foundation with national pavilions.

The tradition of auctioning works of art grew from the difficulty of determining the price of rare and unique objects. While estimates of market value are made for other purposes, such as taxation, charitable donations, and estates; in recent years prices paid at auctions have exceeded such estimates.

===Evaluation===
====Art critics====

In 1964 critic and philosopher Arthur Danto published an essay defining &quot;The Artworld,&quot; in terms of artistic theory. Danto writes: &quot;these days one might not be aware he was on artistic terrain without an artistic theory to tell him so. And part of the reason for this lies in the fact that terrain is constituted artistic in virtue of artistic theories, so that one use of theories, in addition to helping us discriminate art from the rest, consists in making art possible&quot;. In &quot;The Painted Word&quot; Tom Wolfe went further in saying that without a theory, the viewer cannot see a modern work of art. Theory is needed due to the absence of narrative meaning in abstract art that was once provided by realistic art. At the beginning of the 21st century, Danto stated that contemporary art does not speak for itself, but has meaning only in reference to art-world discourse.

Becker however notes that new theories of art may arise in order to account for the acceptance by the art world of works not fitting into older theories. An example is the failure of imitation theories, in which art was judged solely by it faithful representation of nature, to account for works which used form and color to express emotions, giving rise to formalism.

Danto had considerable influence on aesthetic philosophy and especially upon George Dickie&#x27;s institutional theory of art. Dickie defines an art work as an artifact &quot;which has had conferred upon it the status of candidate for appreciation by some person or persons acting in behalf of a certain social institution (the artworld).&quot;

==Change==
The notion of the singular &quot;art world&quot; is problematic, since Becker and others show art worlds are, instead, independent multiplicities scattered worldwide that are always in flux: there is no &quot;center&quot; to the art world any more.

The art world, along with the definition of fine art, is constantly changing as works of art previously excluded move into the &quot;avant garde&quot; and then into mainstream culture.

<doc id="690246" wikidata="Q2916484" url="?curid=690246" title="Matrix of ones">
<text>In mathematics, a matrix of ones or all-ones matrix is a matrix with every entry equal to one. For example:

:formula_1

Some sources call the all-ones matrix the unit matrix, but that term may also refer to the identity matrix, a different type of matrix.

A vector of ones or all-ones vector is matrix of ones having row or column form; it should not be confused with &quot;unit vectors&quot;.

==Properties==
For an matrix of ones &quot;J&quot;, the following properties hold:

* The trace of &quot;J&quot; equals &quot;n&quot;, and the determinant equals 0 for &quot;n&quot; ≥ 2, but equals 1 if &quot;n&quot; = 1.
* The characteristic polynomial of &quot;J&quot; is formula_2.
* The minimal polynomial of &quot;J&quot; is formula_3.
* The rank of &quot;J&quot; is 1 and the eigenvalues are &quot;n&quot; with multiplicity 1 and 0 with multiplicity .
* formula_4 for formula_5
* &quot;J&quot; is the neutral element of the Hadamard product.

When &quot;J&quot; is considered as a matrix over the real numbers, the following additional properties hold:
* &quot;J&quot; is positive semi-definite matrix.
*The matrix formula_6 is idempotent.
*The matrix exponential of &quot;J&quot; is formula_7

==Applications==
The all-ones matrix arises in the mathematical field of combinatorics, particularly involving the application of algebraic methods to graph theory. For example, if &quot;A&quot; is the adjacency matrix of an &quot;n&quot;-vertex undirected graph &quot;G&quot;, and &quot;J&quot; is the all-ones matrix of the same dimension, then &quot;G&quot; is a regular graph if and only if &quot;AJ&quot; = &quot;JA&quot;. As a second example, the matrix appears in some linear-algebraic proofs of Cayley&#x27;s formula, which gives the number of spanning trees of a complete graph, using the matrix tree theorem.

The logical square roots of a matrix of ones, logical matrices whose square is a matrix of ones, can be used to characterize the central groupoids. Central groupoids are algebraic structures that obey the identity formula_8. Finite central groupoids have a square number of elements, and the corresponding logical matrices exist only for those dimensions.

<text>Raymond Rougeau (born February 18, 1955) is a Canadian politician, former professional wrestler and French language commentator. He most notably worked for the World Wrestling Federation between 1986 and 2002, firstly as one of The Fabulous Rougeaus, and has been the mayor of Rawdon, Quebec, since 2021.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Canada and Georgia (1971–1986) ===
Raymond Rougeau began training with his father Jacques Rougeau, Sr. and his great-uncle Eddie Auger at the age of fourteen. He debuted in 1971 at the age of sixteen in Joliette for his father&#x27;s Montreal promotion as a babyface. In 1974 he and his father fought The Love Brothers in Toronto. In 1976, Raymond relocated to Atlanta, Georgia to work for Jim Barnett in the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) along with his close friend Pierre Lefebvre. In 1985 he and his brother Jacques Rougeau Jr. fought Ron and Jimmy Garvin in Montreal.

=== World Wrestling Federation ===

==== Fabulous Rougeaus (1986–1990) ====
In February 1986, Raymond and his brother joined the World Wrestling Federation, debuting during a tour of Australia. During their first year with the company they faced and defeated such duos as The Hart Foundation (Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart), The Moondogs, Jimmy Jack and Dory Funk, Jr., and The Dream Team (Greg Valentine and Brutus Beefcake).
Although they lost their match at WrestleMania III in 1987 to Valentine and Beefcake, they briefly upset The Hart Foundation for the WWF Tag Team Championship at the Montreal Forum on August 10 that year. The decision was reversed to a disqualification and the championship returned, since the challengers initially won after using Jimmy Hart&#x27;s megaphone as a weapon.
After two years in the Federation, The Fabulous Rougeaus (Jacques and Raymond) turned heel when they participated in an angle in which the Canadian brothers were announced as &quot;From Canada, but soon to relocate to the United States&quot;, and had an intentionally annoying entrance theme in which they sang (partly in French) about being &quot;All-American Boys&quot; as well as now having Jimmy Hart as their manager (The Rougeaus were also briefly billed as being from Memphis, Jimmy Hart&#x27;s home city). They also waved tiny American flags, infuriating fans, who questioned their sincerity, and humorously attempted to start &quot;USA!&quot; chants, which led to further negative fan &quot;heat&quot;. According to Jacques, the widespread antipathy of American fans inspired Vince McMahon to turn them into heels. They feuded with The Killer Bees, The Hart Foundation (who had turned face in between), The Bushwhackers and The Rockers during their heel run.

Raymond went into semi-retirement three months after SummerSlam in 1989. His last match in the WWF was at the Royal Rumble in 1990, which the Rougeau Brothers lost to The Bushwhackers.

==== Commentator (1992–2002) ====
In October 1992, Rougeau replaced Edouard Carpentier as the play-by-play commentator for the French syndicated WWF programming distributed to Quebec, Europe and Africa. He commentated alongside Guy Hauray from October 1992 to April 1994, then Jean Brassard from May 1994 to November 1998 when the WWF stopped producing French-language TV shows. It resumed in January 2000 after the WWF landed a new TV deal in France and Rougeau returned with a new co-host, Philippe Hartman, until January 2002.

As his brother was still an active competitor as one half of The Quebecers alongside Pierre, Pierre turned and started attacking Jacques. Raymond left the commentary table and ran to the ring to save his brother. Rougeau later accompanied Jacques in his first retirement match in the WWF, held in Montreal.

Rougeau was also an interviewer and presenter on WWF programming in 1993 and 1994. He also did English play-by-play for the international version of Superstars in 1998.

Rougeau came out of retirement on August 8, 1996, to face Owen Hart in a boxing match at the Montreal Molson Centre during a WWF house show despite not being active as a competitor for years.

Rougeau came out of retirement again in March 1998, when he teamed with Jacques and Carl Ouellet to defeat Adam Copeland, Shawn Stasiak and Tom Brandi in a dark match for &quot;WWF Shotgun Saturday Night&quot;.

In 2000, Rougeau participated in the &quot;Lutte 2000&quot; event, where he defeated Richard Charland.

Rougeau left the WWF in early 2002 when it stopped producing French-language versions of its programming.

===Return to WWE (2017–2021)===
In May 2017, it was announced that Rougeau would return to WWE as a French language commentator, reuniting with Jean Brassard, for the PPVs on the WWE Network.

In April 2021, after Peacock became the new home for WWE Network, due to rescheduling, Rougeau and Brassard didn&#x27;t continue providing their services, leaving the company again.

==Political career==
Rougeau owned income management properties and has been active in city council politics in Rawdon, Quebec since 2002; he was initially elected with 72% of the vote and was re-elected unopposed. He was elected for the first time in the November 2002 municipal election and is reelected in 2005, 2009 and 2013. Opposed by two candidates, he was reelected with 66,12% of the vote in November 2013. He occasionally promotes wrestling shows in Montreal along with Jacques. In 2021, he was elected Mayor of Rawdon with 61% of the vote.

==Personal life==
Rougeau has a son who was born in 1990.

In September 2011, Rougeau was credited with saving the life of a 77-year-old hunting friend who was lost in the woods, near Lac-Saint-Jean, Quebec for two days. Rougeau flew his own plane for the rescue mission after a police search did not lead to the man being found.

<text>Marcel Tabuteau (2 July 18874 January 1966) was a French-American oboist who is considered the founder of the American school of oboe playing.

==Life==
Tabuteau was born in Compiègne, Oise, France, and given a post in the city&#x27;s municipal wind band at age eleven. He then studied at the Conservatoire de Paris with the legendary oboist Georges Gillet.

Walter Damrosch brought Tabuteau, along with French musicians flutist Georges Barrère, bassoonist Auguste Mesnard, clarinetist Leon Leroy, and Belgian trumpeter Adolphe Dubois, to New York in 1905 to play in his New York Symphony Orchestra. Damrosch was fined by the musicians&#x27; union for not advertising for musicians from New York, but the emigrating musicians were allowed to stay. In 1906 Tabuteau returned to France to complete his three years of compulsory military service as a French citizen, and served as a military musician in the regimental band of the 45th Infantry Regiment in Compiègne. A French law that had been enacted on July 11, 1892 gave special consideration to graduates of the Conservatoire, allowing him to be demobilized after just one year of service. He returned to the United States in 1907 and the union again tried to have him expelled, on the grounds that there had been a break in his US residence since filing his first citizenship papers. The union was unsuccessful and Tabuteau became a US citizen in 1912. 

Tabuteau served as principal oboist of the Philadelphia Orchestra from 1915 to 1954 under Leopold Stokowski and Eugene Ormandy, and just as importantly, taught in Philadelphia at the Curtis Institute of Music. There his classes included Oboe, Woodwind and String Ensembles, Orchestral Winds/Percussion Class, and combined ensembles. He taught at Curtis from 1925 until his retirement in 1954.

==Legacy==
During the thirty years Tabuteau taught at the Curtis Institute of Music, he came to exercise a decisive influence on the standards of oboe playing in the whole United States, as well as raising the level of woodwind achievement in general. The impact of his teaching was not confined to wind instruments alone, as is evidenced by the many string players and pianists who attended his classes.
