<text>Ram Vilas Paswan (5 July 19468 October 2020) was an Indian politician from Bihar and the Cabinet Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution in the first and second Modi ministries. Paswan was also the president of the Lok Janshakti Party, nine-times Lok Sabha member and two-time Rajya Sabha MP. He started his political career as member of Samyukta Socialist Party and was elected to the Bihar Legislative Assembly in 1969. Later, Paswan joined Lok Dal upon its formation in 1974, and became its general secretary. He opposed the emergency, and was arrested during this period. He first entered the Lok Sabha in 1977, as a Janata Party member from Hajipur constituency, and was elected again in 1980, 1989, 1991 (from Rosera), 1996, 1998, 1999, 2004 and 2014.

In 2000, Paswan formed the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) as its president. Subsequently, in 2004, he joined the ruling United Progressive Alliance government and remained a Union Minister in Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers and Ministry of Steel. He was posthumously awarded India&#x27;s third highest civilian award the Padma Bhushan in 2021.

Known for holding cabinet positions under 7 governments, Paswan was known as the weatherman of Indian politics. As of 2024, he is the longest-serving Union minister who was not a member of the Indian National Congress.

==Early life and education==
Paswan was born in a Dusadh family on 5 July 1946 in Shaharbanni, Khagaria district of Bihar to Jamun Paswan and Siya Devi. Paswan held Bachelor of Laws and Master of Arts degrees from Kosi College, Khagaria and Patna University. He had been selected as a DSP in Bihar Police in 1969.

==Political career==
Paswan was elected to the Bihar state legislative assembly in 1969 as a member of the Samyukta Socialist Party (&quot;United Socialist Party&quot;) from Alauli, a reserved constituency. He lost 1972 Vidhan Sabha election from Alauli to Shri Mishri Sada of Congress. In 1974, as an ardent follower of Raj Narain and Jayaprakash Narayan Paswan became the general secretary of the Lok Dal. He was personally close to the prominent leaders of anti-emergency like Raj Narain, Karpoori Thakur and Satyendra Narayan Sinha.

In 1975, when emergency was proclaimed in India, Paswan was arrested and spent the entire period in jail. On being released in 1977, he became a member of the Janata Party and won election to Parliament for the first time on its ticket from Hajipur with a record margin (later broken) of 424,000 and 89.3% votes which is perhaps an all-time record for general election in India. Former PM Narasimha Rao got a higher percentage of vote in a 1991 bye-poll. When Janata Party split in 1979, he joined Charan Singh&#x27;s faction. Paswan was re-elected to the 7th Lok Sabha in 1980 from Hajipur constituency as Janata Party (Socialist) candidate. In 1983, he established the Dalit Sena, an organisation for Dalit emancipation and welfare. The Dalit Sena was later headed by his brother Ram Chandra Paswan. Later it was renamed as Scheduled Caste sena in a vein similar to the Scheduled Caste federation established by Bhim Rao Ambedkar. Paswan lost 1984 Lok Sabha election from Hajipur.

Paswan was elected to the 9th Lok Sabha in 1989 and was appointed Union Minister of Labour and Welfare in the Vishwanath Pratap Singh government. He was elected to Lok Sabha from Rosera (Lok Sabha constituency) in 1991, the only time between 1977 and 2014 when he did not contest from Hajipur. In 1996, he won again from Hajipur, and he even led the ruling alliance or proposition in the Lok Sabha as the prime minister was a member of the Rajya Sabha. This was also the year when Paswan first became the Union Railway Minister. He continued to hold that post till 1998. Thereafter, Paswan was the Union Communications Minister from October 1999 to September 2001 when he was shifted to the Coal Ministry, the portfolio he held till April 2002.

In 2000, Paswan broke from the Janata Dal, to form the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP). He resigned as minister and left the ruling NDA in 2002 after developing differences with BJP. Following the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, Paswan joined the United Progressive Alliance government and was made the Union Minister in Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers and Ministry of Steel.

In the February 2005 Bihar State elections, Paswan&#x27;s party LJP along with the Indian National Congress contested the election. The result was that no particular party or alliance could form a government by itself. However, Paswan consistently refused to support either Lalu Prasad Yadav, whom he accused of being extremely corrupt, or the right-wing National Democratic Alliance thereby creating a stalemate. This stalemate was broken when Nitish Kumar succeeded in persuading 12 members of Paswan&#x27;s party to defect; to prevent the formation of a government supported by LJP defectors, the Governor of Bihar, Buta Singh dissolved the state legislature and called for fresh elections, keeping Bihar under President&#x27;s Rule. In the November 2005 Bihar state elections, Paswan&#x27;s third-alliance was utterly devastated; the Laloo Yadav-Congress alliance reduced to a minority and the NDA formed the new government.

Paswan has declared that the Bihar state elections have no influence on the Central Government, which will continue with both him and Laloo Yadav as ministers.
Paswan has served as a Union Minister under five different Prime Ministers and continuously held a cabinet berth in all the Council of Ministers formed since 1996 (as of 2015). He was also part of all the national coalitions (the United Front, the National Democratic Alliance and the United Progressive Alliance), which have formed the Indian Government from 1996 to 2015.
===2009 Indian general election===
For the 2009 Indian general election Paswan forged an alliance with Lalu Prasad Yadav and his Rashtriya Janata Dal, while dumping their erstwhile coalition partner and leader of the United Progressive Alliance, the Indian National Congress from the new alliance. The duo was later joined by Mulayam Singh&#x27;s Samajwadi Party and were declared the Fourth Front. Paswan lost the elections from Hajipur to the Janata Dal&#x27;s Ram Sundar Das, a former chief minister of Bihar for the first time in 33 years. His party the Lok Janshakti Party was not able to win any seats in the 15th Lok Sabha, while his coalition partner Yadav and his party too failed to perform well and were reduced to 4 seats.
===2010 assembly election===

Before the assembly elections to be held in 2010, Paswan was elected to the Rajya Sabha from the assembly, Ram Vilas Paswan and Lalu fought the 2010 Bihar election together and also claimed to form the government in Bihar with two-thirds majority. They termed the Nitish B.J.P. government that has been running for 5 years as ineffective and accused Nitish of taking Bihar into trouble. The work of taking has been done due to which Bihar has lagged further behind. Accusing the N.D.A., he said that 30 percent of the voters in Bihar are fake and the government is also behind this. Lalu&#x27;s party RJD and Ram Vilas had fought this election together in alliance, in which L.J.P. fielded its candidates on 75 seats, while only 3 candidates could win, and could not even save the deposit on many seats. This performance of the party was less than the last election of 2005 Bihar election. The condition of the alliance was such that only 22 candidates could win for RJD. Seeing such poor performance of the party, Paswan and Lalu&#x27;s Dalit, Muslim and backward politics took a new dimension.


===2014 Indian general election===
Paswan was elected as member of 16th Lok Sabha after the 2014 Indian general election from Hajipur constituency when he contested in alliance with BJP, while his son Chirag Paswan won from Jamui constituency also in Bihar.

Paswan was again given charge of the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution in May 2014, which continued in Second Modi ministry in 2019. He was elected to Rajya Sabha in 2019 with the help of BJP though his own party had only 2 MLAs in the state assembly.

==Personal life==
Paswan married Rajkumari Devi in the 1960s. In 2014, he disclosed that he had divorced her in 1981, after his Lok Sabha nomination papers were challenged. Paswan had two daughters from first wife, Usha and Asha. In 1983, he married Reena Sharma, an air hostess. They had a son and a daughter. His son Chirag Kumar Paswan is an actor-turned-politician.

He was often called a dynast. He brought his brothers Pashupati Kumar Paras and Ram Chandra Paswan into politics. Of the six seats that the LJP won in 2019, three were from his family – son Chirag, and brothers Pashupati Kumar Paras and Ram Chandra Paswan. Ram Chandra&#x27;s son Prince Raj succeeded his father upon his death.

== Death ==
Paswan died on 8 October 2020, and his death was confirmed by his son, Chirag Paswan. Paswan had undergone heart surgery and was hospitalised for a few weeks prior to his death. Paswan was cremated in Patna on 10 October 2020. His body was brought to Janardan Ghat in the Digha locality from his residence in Shri Krishna Puri, about 3 km away, for the last rites.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi went to Paswan&#x27;s Delhi residence to pay homage to him. Also, senior leader and former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Mulayam Singh Yadav paid tribute to him.

<text>The SoWa Art &amp; Design District (South of [[SoWa|Wa]]shington) in the South End of Boston, Massachusetts, USA, is a community of artist studios, contemporary art galleries, boutiques, design showrooms, and restaurants. It features the SoWa Open Market, the SoWa Vintage Market, and a residential neighborhood.

Originally derived from a shortening of &quot;South of Washington&quot;, SoWa spans the area from East Brookline Street to East Berkeley Street and from Shawmut Avenue to Albany Street.

==History==
GTI Properties and owner Mario Nicosia are credited with gentrifying the district beginning in the early 2000s and for inventing the SoWa name.

In the 19th century, SoWa&#x27;s brick and beam factories were home to manufacturers of pianos, canned goods, shoes and other merchandise. In addition, 540 Harrison Ave, a building currently used to host markets and events, originally opened in 1891 as the Central Power Station for the West End Street Railway Company, the precursor to the MBTA. The Romanesque Revival and Gothic Revival structure was the world&#x27;s largest electrical power station at the time and later became a trolley barn.

==Culture==
Due to the number of artists and galleries located in the neighborhood, many events regarding art are held at SoWa. Every month, over 90 artists and galleries in SoWa stage their new 30-day shows, showing the works of established painters, photographers and sculptors. This event, known as &quot;SoWa First Fridays&quot;, is held on the first Friday of every month from 5pm to 9pm. In addition, the SoWa Art Walk, an annual art festival held each spring, enables many artists to present their works and host open studios.

Opened in 2003, The SoWa Open Market provides an opportunity for local artisans to share their products. Each Sunday, many visitors from across New England converge in SoWa.

<text>Gregory Rabassa (March 9, 1922 – June 13, 2016) was an American literary translator from Spanish and Portuguese to English. He taught for many years at Columbia University and Queens College. 

==Life and career==
Rabassa was born in Yonkers, New York, to a family headed by a Cuban émigré. After serving during World War II as an OSS cryptographer, he received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Dartmouth. He earned his doctorate at Columbia University and taught there for over two decades before accepting a position at Queens College, City University of New York.

Rabassa translated literature from Spanish and Portuguese. He produced English-language versions of the works of several major Latin American novelists, including Julio Cortázar, Jorge Amado and Gabriel García Márquez. On the advice of Cortázar, García Márquez waited three years for Rabassa to schedule translating &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot;. He later declared Rabassa&#x27;s translation to be superior to the Spanish original.

He received the PEN Translation Prize in 1977 and the PEN/Ralph Manheim Medal for Translation in 1982. Rabassa was honored with the Gregory Kolovakos Award from PEN American Center for the expansion of Hispanic Literature to an English-language audience in 2001.

Rabassa had a particularly close and productive working relation with Cortázar, with whom he shared lifelong passions for jazz and wordplay. For his version of Cortázar&#x27;s novel, &quot;Hopscotch&quot;, Rabassa shared the inaugural U.S. National Book Award in Translation.

Rabassa taught at Queens College, from which he retired with the title Distinguished Professor Emeritus. In 2006, he was awarded the National Medal of Arts.

He wrote a memoir of his experiences as a translator, &quot;If This Be Treason: Translation and Its Dyscontents, A Memoir&quot;, which was a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; &quot;Favorite Book of the Year&quot; for 2005 and for which he received the PEN/Martha Albrand Award for the Art of the Memoir in 2006.

== Translation methods ==
Rabassa sometimes translated without having read the book beforehand.

In a 2006 interview with the University of Delaware, Rabassa said &quot;I just let the text lead me along. In my mind, the book I’m translating exists in English even before it’s translated. I just have to pull it out. I do a first draft, “write” the book as the author him- or herself would have written it if they’d spoken English. Ideally, a different style emerges for each author being translated&quot;.

== Death ==
Rabassa died on June 13, 2016, at a hospice in Branford, Connecticut. He was 94.

<text>Carlos Alberto Hernández Almeida [er-NAN-dez] (born May 24, 1967) is a Venezuelan former Major League Baseball catcher who played for the Los Angeles Dodgers (1990–1996), San Diego Padres (1997–2000) and St. Louis Cardinals (2000).

==Career==
Signed by the Dodgers as a free agent in 1984, Hernández became the second Venezuelan catcher in MLB history, following Bo Díaz. He made his major league debut in the 1990 season, basically as a backup for Mike Scioscia. A high skilled defensive player, Hernández spent his Dodgers career as mainly a back-up catcher to Scioscia and Mike Piazza, appearing in 230 games, including 133 starts. He signed as a free agent with San Diego and later was traded to the Cardinals.

In his first full major league season as a regular catcher for the Padres, Hernández batted .262, with 9 home runs and 52 runs batted in in 129 games played. In 22 postseason games, he hit .299 (20-67) with one homer and two RBI.

Hernández finished his career batting .253 (315–1244) with 24 home runs, 141 RBI, 102 runs, 51 doubles, one triple, and one stolen base in 488 games played.

Hernández started his career as a manager with the &quot;Toros de Tijuana&quot; in the Mexican League for the 2004 season. He then returned to the San Diego Padres organization as a catching coordinator from 2005 to 2007. He also managed the Leones de Caracas from the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League from 2006 to 2008.

Hernández returned to the San Diego Padres in 2012 as a color analyst for Spanish game broadcasts on Fox Deportes and their Spanish radio broadcast on XEMO.

Hernández owned &#x27;Caribbean Flavor&#x27;, a Venezuelan restaurant in the San Diego suburb of Poway, but the restaurant closed in 2011.

<doc id="679852" wikidata="Q3182144" url="?curid=679852" title="John Murray (theologian)">
<text>John Murray (14 October 1898 – 8 May 1975) was a Scottish-born Calvinist theologian who taught at Princeton Seminary and then left to help found Westminster Theological Seminary, where he taught for many years. He was ordained in the Orthodox Presbyterian Church in 1937.

==Life==
Murray was born in the croft of Badbea, near Bonar Bridge, in Sutherland county, Scotland. Following service in the British Army in the First World War (during which he lost an eye, serving in the Black Watch regiment) he studied at the University of Glasgow. Following his acceptance as a theological student of the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland he pursued further studies at Princeton Theological Seminary under J. Gresham Machen and Geerhardus Vos, but broke with the Free Presbyterian Church in 1930 over that Church&#x27;s handling of a discipline case in the Chesley, Ontario congregation concerning the Lord&#x27;s Day. He taught at Princeton for a year and then lectured in systematic theology at Westminster Theological Seminary to generations of students from 1930 to 1966, and was an early trustee of the Banner of Truth Trust. Besides the material in the four-volume &quot;Collected Writings&quot;, his primary published works are a commentary on the Epistle to the Romans (previously included in the &quot;New International Commentary on the New Testament&quot; series but now superseded by Douglas J. Moo&#x27;s commentary), &quot;Redemption Accomplished and Applied&quot;, &quot;Principles of Conduct&quot;, &quot;The Imputation of Adam&#x27;s Sin&quot;, &quot;Baptism&quot;, and &quot;Divorce&quot;.

Murray preached at Chesley and Lochalsh from time to time until his retirement from Westminster Theological Seminary in 1966. He returned to Scotland, where he was connected with the Free Church of Scotland, and at the age of 69, married Valerie Knowlton 7 December 1967. Writing after a communion season at Lochalsh, Murray said, &quot;I think I feel most at home here and at Chesley of all the places I visit.&quot; There had been some consideration that upon leaving the seminary, Murray might take a pastorate in the newly formed Presbyterian Reformed Church, but the infirmity of his aged sisters at the home place necessitated his return to Ross-shire, Scotland.

He is a special invitee to the Congress Working Committee and was a chairman of both the party&#x27;s political training department and the department of policy planning and coordination. He is also a well-known 
political columnist and has written several books, including &quot;Pakistan Papers&quot; and &quot;Remembering Rajiv&quot;, and has edited a four-volume publication, &quot;Rajiv Gandhi&#x27;s India&quot;.

His special interests include grassroots democracy, Indian foreign policy particularly with India&#x27;s neighbouring countries, and West Asia and nuclear disarmament.

==Personal life==
He was married on 4 January 1973 to Suneet Vir Singh, a Sikh woman. They have 3 daughters – the eldest, Suranya Aiyar is a lawyer; the second, Yamini Aiyar is a senior research fellow and director of the Accountability Initiative.

Aiyar is the uncle of Vidya Shankar Aiyar, former anchor on Channelnews asia and CNN- IBN.

==Controversies==

While on a tour of the Andamans as the Cabinet Minister in the later part of 2004, Aiyar was quoted as saying at the Cellular Jail there that there was no difference between Hindutva ideologue Vinayak Savarkar and Pakistan&#x27;s founder Mohammed Ali Jinnah as they shared a &#x27;divisive&#x27; philosophy. He also ordered that a plaque with a poem commemorating Savarkar be replaced with a plaque with quotes from Mahatma Gandhi. Reports of the incident paralysed Parliament and led to agitations by the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra. Aiyar&#x27;s remarks created confusion as well in the ruling party; the official spokesman, Anand Sharma, noted that the Congress Party did not consider Savarkar either a freedom fighter or a patriot. A few days later, the Prime Minister dissociated himself and the cabinet from that view.
In September 2011, Aiyar visited his alma mater—St. Stephen&#x27;s College—to speak about &#x27;Governance and Corruption: Is Panchayati Raj A Solution?&#x27;. However, he began to mock the Hansraj College and its former student Ajay Maken. He also belittled the Kirori Mal College and the BA (Programme) Degree, a course in the University of Delhi. This led to an agitation by the students of Hansraj College. When the agitated students approached him, he mocked them even further. When later questioned by the media, Aiyar refused to apologise and rather ridiculed the institutions even further. Baffled by his remarks, Stephen&#x27;s College and its students went on to apologise to Hansraj College and extended a hand of friendship.

He in an interview days before the run up to the 2014 Parliament elections in India, said that a tea seller (The Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi of the BJP) can never become the Prime Minister of India, but can sell tea in AICC meetings. His comment was disowned by the Congress saying it&#x27;s his personal view and not the party&#x27;s view. Rahul Gandhi asked him not to make personal attacks.

Mani Shankar Aiyer justified November 2015 Paris attacks as a response to France banning hijab. He also justified Charlie Hebdo shooting as a backlash for the death of Muslims. His comments were disapproved by his own party members.

He sparked a political firestorm when he called Prime Minister Narendra Modi a &quot;neech aadmi&quot;, which PM Modi interpreted as &quot;nichli jaati&quot; (lower caste). Subsequently, he was temporarily suspended from the party&#x27;s primary membership. Aiyar said the comments by the PM showed his &quot;low-level mindset and one bereft of any manners&quot;. He further justified his remarks on Modi by adding &quot;Yes, I called Modi &#x27;neech&#x27; but did not mean it as a low-born; I meant it as low&quot;.

<text>Arvydas Romas Sabonis (; born 19 December 1964) is a Lithuanian former professional basketball player and businessman. Sabonis won the Euroscar six times and the Mr. Europa Award twice. He played in a variety of leagues, including the Spanish ACB League, and spent seven seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Playing the center position, Sabonis won a gold medal at the 1988 Summer Olympics, in South Korea, for the Soviet Union, and later earned bronze medals at the 1992 Olympic Games and 1996 Olympic Games representing Lithuania. He retired from professional basketball in 2005. Sabonis was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round of the 1986 NBA draft, but he did not play his first NBA game until 1995, at the age of 30. 
On 20 August 2010, Sabonis was inducted into the FIBA Hall of Fame in recognition of his great play in international competition. On 4 April 2011, Sabonis was named to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, and he was inducted on 12 August 2011. On 24 October 2011, Sabonis was voted as the next President of the Lithuanian Basketball Federation, replacing Vladas Garastas, who had led the LBF since 1991. He resigned from the position on 2 October 2013, but he came back to it on 10 October 2013.

His son, Domantas Sabonis, plays for the NBA&#x27;s Sacramento Kings .

==Early life and career==
Born in Kaunas, in then Lithuanian SSR, Soviet Union, Sabonis began playing basketball at age 13. By the time he was 15 years old, he was a member of the Soviet national junior team.

Sabonis was excused from mandatory service to the Soviet Army, by enrolling at the Lithuanian University of Agriculture, in his hometown.

==Professional career==
===Žalgiris===
Sabonis made his professional club debut in 1981, with one of the oldest basketball teams in Lithuania, Žalgiris, in his hometown of Kaunas. With the club, he won three consecutive Soviet Premier League titles, and the 1986 FIBA Club World Cup (FIBA Intercontinental Cup).

===Valladolid===
In 1989, Sabonis left Žalgiris, and signed with the Spanish Liga ACB club Fórum Valladolid. During the 1991–92 season, Sabonis helped the team to reach the semifinals at the Korać Cup.

===Real Madrid===
In 1992, after playing with Fórum Valladolid for three seasons, Sabonis joined the Spanish club Real Madrid, and with them, he won two Spanish League titles, and a FIBA European League (EuroLeague) title, in 1994–95. With Real Madrid, during the 1994–95 Spanish League season, he averaged 22.9 points, 12.5 rebounds, 2.4 assists, 1.6 steals, and 2.3 blocked shots, in 42 games played. While in the 1994–95 FIBA European League season, he averaged 21.8 points, 11.2 rebounds, 2.6 assists, and 1.8 steals per game, in 17 games played.

===Portland Trail Blazers===
Sabonis was originally selected by the Atlanta Hawks with the 77th overall pick of the 1985 NBA draft. However, the selection was voided because Sabonis was under 21 at the time of the draft. The following spring, he suffered a devastating Achilles&#x27; tendon injury. Nevertheless, he was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers, with the 24th overall pick of the 1986 NBA draft. As of 2024, Sabonis would be the last player to be selected in multiple NBA drafts, since the process of players entering multiple draft years would be abolished after the 1980s. Sabonis was not allowed to play in the US by the Soviet authorities, despite LSU Tigers head coach Dale Brown&#x27;s plans to have Sabonis studying and playing at Louisiana State University, thus keeping him in an amateur status. However, he did go to Portland, to rehabilitate his injury with the Blazers medical staff, in 1988, while also practicing with the team.

After the 1994–95 European season, Sabonis and Portland contacted one another about a move to the NBA. Before signing Sabonis, Portland&#x27;s then-general manager, Bob Whitsitt, asked the Blazers team physician to look at Sabonis&#x27; X-rays. Illustrating the impact of Sabonis&#x27; numerous injuries, Whitsitt recalled in a 2011 interview, that when the doctor reported the results, &quot;He said that Arvydas could qualify for a handicapped parking spot, based on the X-ray alone.&quot; Nevertheless, the Blazers signed Sabonis. He had a successful rookie campaign, averaging 14.5 points, on 55% shooting, and 8.1 rebounds per game while playing less than 24 minutes per game. Sabonis was selected to the All-Rookie First Team and was runner-up in both Rookie of the Year and Sixth Man of the Year voting. His postseason averages went up to 23.6 points and 10.2 rebounds per game. In the first playoff series of his NBA career, Portland lost to Utah in five games. Sabonis averaged 16.0 points, 10.0 rebounds, and 3.0 assists per game in 1997–98, all career-highs.

During Sabonis&#x27;s first stint in Portland, the Blazers always made the playoffs (part of a 21-year streak); between 1998 and 1999, the Oregon franchise changed large parts of its roster in order to compete for the NBA Championship (after six consecutive first round losses) with center Sabonis the only player remaining in the starting five. Kenny Anderson and Isaiah Rider were traded for Damon Stoudamire and Steve Smith. In both those years, the Blazers reached the Western Conference Finals. In 1999, they were swept by the eventual champions, the San Antonio Spurs, while, the next year, the team (starting Sabonis, Smith, Stoudamire, Rasheed Wallace, and recently added Scottie Pippen) lost to the Los Angeles Lakers (at the beginning of the team&#x27;s three-peat), in seven games.

The question that frequently surrounds Sabonis&#x27;s NBA career revolves around how good he could have been had he played in the NBA during his prime. Sabonis was already 30 when he joined the Blazers, by which time he had already won multiple gold medals, suffered through numerous injuries, and had lost much of his mobility and athleticism. In Bill Simmons&#x27;s &quot;Book of Basketball&quot;, Sabonis the international player is idealized, while Sabonis the Blazer is described as &quot;lumbering up and down the court in what looked to be concrete Nikes&quot; and ranking &quot;just behind Artis Gilmore on the Moving Like a Mummy Scale.&quot; In ESPN&#x27;s David Thorpe&#x27;s view, Sabonis would be the best passing big man in NBA history, and possibly a top-four center overall, had he played his entire career there. In Clyde Drexler&#x27;s view, if Sabonis had been able to spend his prime in Portland, next to the plethora of other Trail Blazers&#x27; All-Stars (Drexler, Terry Porter, Buck Williams, Steve Johnson, Kevin Duckworth, and Clifford Robinson), the Trail Blazers would &quot;have had four, five or six titles. Guaranteed. He was that good. He could pass, shoot three pointers, had a great post game, and dominated the paint.&quot; Despite his height and weight, he was &quot;a magician in the post who played the game with a style I&#x27;ve never seen from a big man. He was a point guard in a center&#x27;s body. And, just to be fair to Arvydas, he was better than most point guards are at distributing the ball.&quot; His age and injuries made him appear as a &quot;big guy who looked like he couldn&#x27;t make it up the court, but the same guy who made the defense look foolish with a pass that whizzed by their ear. It just goes to show you how smarts and court savvy will always age better than a guy with no brains and all athletic ability&quot;.

On 6 April 2001, Sabonis scored a season-high 32 points while making 11 of 12 field goal attempts during a 122–91 win over the Golden State Warriors. After the 2000–2001 NBA season, Sabonis refused to sign an extension with the Trail Blazers and retired from the NBA. In his own words, he &quot;was tired mentally and physically.&quot; Instead, he returned to Europe, where he signed a one-year deal, at a nominal salary, with Žalgiris Kaunas, expecting to join the team for the most important games of the season down the stretch. However, he ended up missing that season in its entirety, resting and recovering from injuries. Sabonis rejoined the Trail Blazers for one final season, in 2002–2003.

He won the Euroscar twice while playing with the Blazers. He also became a fan favorite, and had a warm welcome back when he visited Portland in 2011, en route to being enshrined into the Naismith Hall of Fame.

===Back to Žalgiris===
Sabonis went back to Žalgiris to play his final season, in 2003–04. He led the team to the Top 16 stage of the EuroLeague that year, and was named the Regular Season MVP and the Top 16 MVP. He also became the team&#x27;s president. Sabonis would officially retire from playing professional basketball, in 2005.

==National team career==
===Soviet national team===

In 1982, Sabonis was one of the players in the senior Soviet Union national team that toured the United States, playing against various college basketball teams.

Despite being recommended to rest, instead of playing in the 1988 Summer Olympics, the Soviets allowed Sabonis to remain a part of their national team. Sabonis led the Soviet Union to a gold medal, with a win against the 1988 edition of the United States national team, that featured future NBA All-Stars David Robinson, Mitch Richmond, and Danny Manning in the semifinals. This was the last American Olympic team that was not composed of active NBA players. The team later beat Yugoslavia in the finals.

In his career with the senior Soviet national team, Sabonis also played at the following major tournaments: the 1982 FIBA World Championship (gold medal), the 1983 EuroBasket (bronze medal), the 1985 EuroBasket (gold medal), the 1986 FIBA World Championship (silver medal), and the 1989 EuroBasket (bronze medal). He was named to the EuroBasket All-Tournament Team in 1983 and 1985, and he was named the EuroBasket MVP in 1985.

The 1985–1988 stretch of a heavy playing schedule, and lack of rest, took a significant toll on Sabonis&#x27;s future health and durability. Various leg injuries were not given much time to heal, due to the Cold War climate that surrounded international competition, as well as the intense rivalry of the Žalgiris Kaunas versus CSKA Moscow games in the USSR Premier League. In a 2011 interview, Sabonis expressed an opinion, that overuse by the coaches of the Soviet national program, was a major contributing factor to his first Achilles&#x27; tendon injury, back in 1986. Another key moment for his future health, took place in 1988, when Sabonis had a surgical Achilles procedure performed in Portland, but was rushed back on the floor with the USSR Olympic team, before a full recovery. The decision to include a limping Sabonis, on the USSR roster for the 1988 Olympic Games, was protested at the time by the Portland medical staff, and was later heavily criticized. While the Soviets cleared him to play professionally in 1989, when his Soviet national teammate, Šarūnas Marčiulionis, went to North America, Sabonis postponed his travel, over feeling that he was not physically ready for the NBA. Eventually, Sabonis would develop chronic knee, ankle and groin issues, that substantially limited his mobility and explosiveness, by the mid-1990s.

===Lithuanian national team===
After breakup of the Soviet Union, and the independence of Lithuania, Sabonis then became a member of the senior Lithuanian national team. He represented Lithuania at the following major tournaments: the 1992 Summer Olympic Games (bronze medal), the 1995 EuroBasket (silver medal), the 1996 Summer Olympic Games (bronze medal), and the 1999 EuroBasket. He was named to the EuroBasket All-Tournament Team in 1995.

Sabonis was also awarded a silver medal at the 2013 EuroBasket tournament, due to being the Lithuanian Basketball Federation (LKF) President.

<text>URS Corporation (formerly United Research Services) was an engineering, design, and construction firm and a U.S. federal government contractor. Headquartered in San Francisco, California, URS was a full-service, global organization with offices located in the Americas, Europe, Africa, and Asia-Pacific.

URS was acquired by AECOM on October 17, 2014.

==History==
URS Corporation’s oldest predecessor company was founded in 1904. URS was established in 1951 and incorporated in 1957 as Broadview Research – a research group active in the area of physical and engineering sciences. In 1967, management developed a growth strategy focused on building a multidisciplinary professional services firm. In 1968, Broadview Research acquired United Research Incorporated of Cambridge, Massachusetts. During this period, the name Broadview Research was changed to United Research Services and later shortened to URS.

URS was publicly traded as &quot;URS&quot; on the NYSE from January 13, 1978 through its acquisition by AECOM on October 17, 2014. It was originally traded as Thortec. A major investor was Richard Blum, husband of Senator Dianne Feinstein.

As of June 2013, the firm had more than 50,000 employees worldwide, in nearly 50 countries.

===Activist investor demands and sale of company===
Following announcements in early February 2014 that the fiscal year 2013 revenue and earnings were below expectations, URS made some management changes. URS had acquired Flint Energy Services for $1.25 billion in February 2012, creating an oil and gas division for the company. Issues in the oil and gas division were cited for the poor financial performance in fiscal year 2013 and URS announced the resignation of senior staff from that division. By the end of February 2014, the hedge fund Jana Partners disclosed that they had acquired an activist investor ownership position in the publicly traded company, announcing an intent to engage the corporate management on board and corporate structure and to create shareholder value.

Amidst industry speculation of a corporate breakup for URS, AECOM announced on July 13, 2014 that an agreement was reached to acquire URS for about $4 billion in cash and shares with another $2 billion in assumed debt. The final acquisition was decided on October 17, 2014, and URS was officially part of AECOM as of October 20, 2014.

== Mergers and acquisitions ==
In 1996, URS acquired Greiner Engineering for $73.5 million. Greiner Engineering had been established in 1908 by John E. Greiner. Greiner was a former bridge engineer for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and worked at one time for Gustav Lindenthal, including on the Seventh Street Bridge.

URS acquired the Denver, Colorado based civil, geotechnical and environmental engineering firm Woodward-Clyde Group in 1997 for $100 Million, bringing additional environmental capabilities and a broader international presence to the organization. When Dames &amp; Moore Group joined in 1999 (which had recently absorbed the Australian firm Hardcastle &amp; Richards), URS further strengthened its program and construction management expertise and added to its FORTUNE 500 client base. In February 1999, URS also acquired transport consultant Thorburn Colquhoun.

In 2002, URS acquired EG&amp;G Technical Services, positioning the company as a leading U.S. federal services contractor.

In November 2007, URS acquired Washington Group International of Boise for $3.1B and operated it as the &quot;Energy and Construction Division&quot;.

On June 12, 2009, URS Chief Executive Officer Martin Koffel indicated the company was still on the hunt for &quot;transformative acquisitions&quot;. An analyst with Gabelli &amp; Co. stated that KBR, Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron Company, and Foster Wheeler AG may be possible takeover targets.

On September 10, 2010, URS completed its acquisition of the British engineering firm Scott Wilson Group.

On June 2, 2011, URS completed its acquisition of Apptis Holdings, Inc. for a purchase price of $260 million in cash.

URS announced its acquisition of Flint Energy Services, a provider of construction services in the oil and gas industry, based in Calgary, Alberta, on February 20, 2012.

On October 20, 2014, URS was officially acquired by AECOM.

==Projects==
URS provided ongoing management and operation of the 4,200-acre Kennedy Space Center complex, including its 900 mission-specific facilities, 16,000 unique NASA systems and equipment, and 600 unique U.S. Air Force systems and equipment.

In the United Kingdom, a URS-led team was responsible for management and operation services at the Sellafield nuclear complex, including commercial operations, waste management, support services, decontamination and decommissioning, and new construction projects. Sellafield is one of the largest and most complex nuclear sites in the U.K., storing and treating nuclear waste from both the U.K.&#x27;s military and civil nuclear programs. URS lost this contract in January 2015.

URS provided comprehensive project and construction management services for the reconstruction of the UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center, the largest building project ever undertaken by the University of California.

URS was the contractor for the Port Washington Generating Station in Wisconsin, an 1100 MW combined-cycle power plant, which was recognized by Power Magazine as one of its top plants of 2008. URS also helped build the state-of-the-art Holcim cement manufacturing plant in Missouri, one of the largest cement manufacturing facilities in the world.

The I-35W bridge in Minneapolis collapsed in August 2007, killing 13 people and injuring 145. In 2003, URS had been retained by the Minnesota Department of Transportation to conduct a fatigue evaluation and a redundancy analysis of the bridge. Lawsuits filed in 2008 and 2009 cite the company with negligence. In 2010, these lawsuits were settled out of court without the admission of negligence or wrongdoing on the part of URS.

In November 2008, the National Transportation Safety Board determined the probable cause of the collapse of the I-35W bridge was &quot;inadequate load capacity, due to a design error by Sverdrup &amp; Parcel and Associates, Inc., of the gusset plates at the U10 nodes, which failed under a combination of (1) substantial increases in the weight of the bridge, which resulted from previous modifications, and (2) the traffic and concentrated construction loads on the bridge on the day of the accident.&quot; URS was not involved in the work being conducted on the bridge at the time of the collapse or in the design of the bridge.

The Martin Olav Sabo Bridge over Hiawatha Avenue in Minneapolis experienced failure of two of its longest support cables on February 20, 2012. URS Corporation was the design consultant for the bridge that was completed in 2007. These failures resulted in closures of Hiawatha Avenue and the adjacent light rail between Mall of America and downtown Minneapolis for safety precautions while support structures were put in place. Rail service was restored after four days while Hiawatha Avenue road traffic remained closed for staging of construction equipment. This failure occurred less than 18 months after URS Corporation settled out of court the lawsuits surrounding the Minneapolis I-35W bridge collapse.

URS was one of the contractors responsible for operating nuclear facilities at Los Alamos. In 2011, URS was involved in a criticality accident that nearly caused an uncontrollable nuclear reaction after mishandling plutonium. This occurred during lax safety protocols and after they replaced all of the members of the criticality safety team with URS employees.

<doc id="679864" wikidata="Q5179224" url="?curid=679864" title="Coverdell education savings account">
<text>A Coverdell education savings account (also known as an education savings account, a Coverdell ESA, a Coverdell account, or just an ESA, and formerly known as an education [[individual retirement account]]), is a tax advantaged investment account in the U.S. designed to encourage savings to cover future education expenses (elementary, secondary, or college), such as tuition, books, and uniforms (for the same year as the distribution). It is found at Section 530 of the Internal Revenue Code (). Coverdell ESAs were first introduced under the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.

The account is named for its primary champion in the United States Senate, the late Senator Paul Coverdell (R-GA).

== Structure and Tax-Advantaged Status ==

=== Structure ===
Coverdell ESAs have two primary parties: a trust or custodian, who manages the account, and a beneficiary, who receives distributions from the account. The trust or custodian is the party that establishes and controls the funds in the ESA for the student beneficiary, who must be under the age of 18 at the time of designation. Funds within the account are not considered to be owned by the custodian nor by the beneficiary unless they are the same individual. All funds within an ESA must be distributed to the beneficiary before he or she turns 30 years old, but the custodian may name a new beneficiary of the account before such time in order the preserve the account.

Coverdell ESAs are self-directed investment accounts. Unlike bank deposit accounts, such as checking or savings accounts which are pure cash holdings and are typically insured, ESAs can contain both cash and investment securities such as stocks, bonds, real estate funds, and mutual funds. The value of these securities is not insured. This means the value of the funds in an ESA may rise and fall with the respective values of the securities held in the account. Coverdell ESAs may be opened with any investment brokerage institution who select a wide range of securities for the custodian to choose. The investment options for an ESA are therefore only limited by the choices available at that institution.

=== Tax-Advantaged Status ===
The funds contained in Coverdell ESAs are classified as tax-deferred. This means the appreciation, interest, and profits of securities within the account are not taxed as capital gains or income. Qualified distributions from an ESA are tax-free and are not considered income to the beneficiary, nor are contributions to ESAs tax-deductible. However, if the beneficiary receives an ESA distribution that exceeds his or her total qualified expenses in a given year, the excess is taxed as normal income. Any excess distribution that results from distributing the remainder of the account once the beneficiary turns 30 years old is also taxed as normal income.

== Contributions and Distributions ==
=== Contributions ===
There are no restrictions on who can make qualified contributions to a Coverdell ESA, but there are limits on how much. Each ESA plan can only receive a total of $2,000 in contributions per tax year. Individuals may contribute to any number of accounts per tax year as long as each plan does not exceed the $2,000 contribution limit. Contributors with a higher modified adjusted gross income, or MAGI, of $95,000+ for single tax filers or $195,000+ for joint filers may not contribute the full $2,000 limit. Single tax filers exceeding a MAGI of $110,000 or joint filers exceeding $220,000 may not contribute to Coverdell ESAs at all.

=== Distributions ===
The beneficiary may request, or the custodian may elect, to use Coverdell ESA funds to pay for qualified educational expenses. Qualified expenses include, but are not limited to, tuition and fees, books and supplies, room and board, and some special needs services if required by the student. Qualifying educational institutions include all accredited primary and secondary schools, including private or religious institutions, and post-secondary institutions that are eligible to receive federal financial aid. There are no restrictions on the amount of qualified funds that may be distributed within a given year and distributions are purely voluntary.

== Comparison to a 529 Plan ==
Coverdell ESAs have many similarities and differences to a 529 Plan, another tax-advantaged investment account aimed at helping students pay for their education. ESA&#x27;s and 529s are the only two types of tax-advantaged educational accounts currently allowed by the U.S. tax code.
== Effects ==
Since Coverdell ESAs are tax-advantaged, they impact federal tax revenues. The annual revenue lost to the IRS is small at about $100 million per year, or roughly less than 10 times less than the revenue loss generated by 529 plans. ESAs also reduce federal government expenditures since savings assets such as Coverdell accounts typically lower the amount of financial aid a student is eligible to receive. The impact of this reduction of federal student aid impacts students and their families differently. When the student is a dependent and not an owner of the account, money in both a Coverdell ESA and a 529 plan is not considered the child&#x27;s (beneficiary&#x27;s) money when applying for federal financial aid. The child&#x27;s potential financial aid is increased compared to when the student is not a dependent and the account owner, because the expected family contribution will be 5.64% as opposed to 20%. Students belonging to higher-income households face a smaller relative impact than those coming from lower-income households, thus increasing the disparity in financial aid as a result of income.

<doc id="679865" wikidata="Q191799" url="?curid=679865" title="Aleksandr Popov (physicist)">
<text>Alexander Stepanovich Popov (sometimes spelled Popoff; ; – ) was a Russian physicist who was one of the first people to invent a radio receiving device.

Popov&#x27;s work as a teacher at a Russian naval school led him to explore high-frequency electrical phenomena. On 7 May 1895, he presented a paper on a wireless lightning detector he had built that worked via using a coherer to detect radio noise from lightning strikes. This day is celebrated today in Russia as Radio Day. In a 24 March 1896 demonstration, he transmitted radio signals 250 meters between different campus buildings in St. Petersburg. His work was based on that of another physicist, Oliver Lodge, and contemporaneous with the work of Guglielmo Marconi.

==Early life==
Born in the town of Krasnoturinsk, Sverdlovsk Oblast, in the Urals as the son of a priest, he became interested in natural sciences when he was a child. His father wanted Alexander to join the priesthood and sent him to the Seminary School at Yekaterinburg. There he developed an interest in science and mathematics and instead of going on to Theology School in 1877 he enrolled at Saint Petersburg University, where he studied physics. After graduation with honors in 1882, he stayed on as a laboratory assistant at the university. However, the salary at the university was inadequate to support his family, and in 1883 he took a post as teacher and head of laboratory at the Russian Navy&#x27;s Torpedo School in Kronstadt on Kotlin Island.

==Radio wave receiver==

Along with his teaching duties at the naval school, Popov pursued related areas of research. Trying to solve a problem with the failure in the electrical wire insulation on steel ships (which turned out to be a problem with electrical resonance) led him to further explore oscillations of high-requency electrical currents. His interest in this area of study (including the new field of &quot;Hertzian&quot; or radio waves) was intensified by his trip in 1893 to the Chicago World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in the United States, where he was able to confer with other researchers in the field.

Popov also read an 1894 article about British physicist Oliver Lodge&#x27;s experiments related to the discovery of radio waves by German physicist Heinrich Hertz 6 years earlier. On 1 June 1894, after the death of Hertz, British physicist Oliver Lodge gave a memorial lecture on Hertz experiments. He set up a demonstration on the quasi optical nature of Hertzian waves (radio waves) and demonstrated their transmission at distances up to 50 meters. Lodge used a detector called a &quot;coherer&quot;, a glass tube containing metal filings between two electrodes. When received waves from an antenna were applied to the electrodes, the coherer became conductive allowing the current from a battery to pass through it, with the impulse being picked up by a mirror galvanometer. After receiving a signal, the metal filings in the coherer had to be reset by a manually operated vibrator or by the vibrations of a bell placed on the table nearby that rang every time a transmission was received. Popov set to work to design a more sensitive radio wave receiver that could be used as a lightning detector, to warn of thunderstorms by detecting the electromagnetic pulses of lightning strikes using a coherer receiver.

===Operating principle===
In Popov&#x27;s lightning detector the coherer (&quot;C&quot;) was connected to an antenna (&quot;A&quot;), and to a separate circuit with a relay (&quot;R&quot;) and battery (&quot;V&quot;) which operated an electric bell (&quot;B&quot;). The radio noise generated by a lightning strike turned on the coherer, the current from the battery was applied to the relay, closing its contacts, which applied current to the electromagnet (&quot;E&quot;) of the bell, pulling the arm over to ring the bell. Popov added an innovative automatic reset feature of a &quot;self tapping&quot; coherer where the bell arm would spring back and tap the coherer, restoring it to its receptive state. The two chokes (&quot;L&quot;) in the coherer&#x27;s leads prevented the radio signal across the coherer from short circuiting by passing through the DC circuit. He connected his receiver to a wire antenna (&quot;A&quot;) suspended high in the air and to a ground (earth) (&quot;G&quot;). The antenna idea may have been based on a lightning rod and was an early use of a monopole wire aerial.

===Demonstrations===
On 7 May 1895 Popov presented the paper &quot;On the Relation of Metallic Powders to Electric Oscillations&quot;, which described his lightning detector, to the Russian Physical and Chemical Society in St. Petersburg. Most Eastern sources regard Popov&#x27;s lightning detector as the first radio receiver, and 7 May has been celebrated since 1945 in the Russian Federation as &quot;Radio Day&quot;. However, there is no evidence Popov sent any type of message on that occasion. The first account of &quot;communication&quot; by Popov was a demonstration on 24 March 1896 at the Physical and Chemical Society, when some accounts say the Morse code message &quot;ГЕНРИХ ГЕРЦ&quot; (&quot;HEINRICH HERTZ&quot; in Russian) was received from a transmitter 250 meters away and transcribed on the blackboard by the Society president. Historian Charles Susskind in 1962 concluded that Popov did not use radio waves for actual wireless communication before mid-1896.

In 1895 Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi began work on a purpose-built wireless telegraphy system based on &quot;Hertzian&quot; (radio) waves, developing a spark-gap transmitter and a much improved automatically reset coherer receiver. By mid-1895 Marconi had transmitted messages 1/2 mile (800 meters). He then came up with the idea grounding his transmitter as well as his receiver, and by mid-1896 he was transmitting radio messages a mile and a half (2400 meters). Popov and Marconi&#x27;s early work seems to have been done without knowledge of each other&#x27;s system, although reading Marconi&#x27;s June 1896 patent disclosures led Popov to develop a long-range wireless telegraphy system.

His paper on his experiments: &quot;On the relation of metallic powders to electrical oscillations&quot;, was published 15 December 1895. He did not apply for a patent for his invention. In July 1895 he installed his receiver and a siphon recorder on the roof of the Institute of Forestry building in St. Petersburg. and was able to detect thunderstorms at a range of 50 km, however he was also aware of its communication potential. His paper, read at the 7 May 1895 meeting, concluded:
&quot;I can express my hope that my apparatus will be applied for signaling at great distances by electric vibrations of high frequency, as soon as there will be invented a more powerful generator of such vibrations.&quot;

In 1896, the article depicting Popov&#x27;s invention was reprinted in the &#x27;Journal of the Russian Physical and Chemical Society&#x27;. In March 1896, he effected transmission of radio waves between different campus buildings in St. Petersburg. In November 1897, the French entrepreneur Eugène Ducretet made a transmitter and receiver based on wireless telegraphy in his own laboratory. According to Ducretet, he built his devices using Popov&#x27;s lightning detector as a model. By 1898 Ducretet was manufacturing equipment of wireless telegraphy based on Popov&#x27;s instructions. At the same time Popov effected ship-to-shore communication over a distance of 6 miles in 1898 and 30 miles in 1899.

==Later work==

In 1900 a radio station was established under Popov&#x27;s instructions on Hogland island (Suursaari) to provide two-way communication by wireless telegraphy between the Russian naval base and the crew of the battleship &quot;General-Admiral Apraksin&quot;. The battleship had run aground on Hogland island in the Gulf of Finland in November 1899. The crew of the &quot;Apraksin&quot; were not in immediate danger, but the water in the Gulf began to freeze. Due to bad weather and bureaucratic red tape, the crew of &quot;Apraksin&quot; did not arrive until January 1900 to establish a wireless station on Hogland Island. By 5 February, however, messages were being received reliably. The wireless messages were relayed to Hogland Island by a station some 25 miles away at Kymi (nowadays Kotka) on the Finnish coast. Kotka was selected as the location for the wireless relay station because it was the point closest to Hogland Island served by telegraph wires connected to Russian naval headquarters.

By the time the &quot;Apraksin&quot; was freed from the rocks by the icebreaker &quot;Yermak&quot; at the end of April, 440 official telegraph messages had been handled by the Hogland Island wireless station. Besides the rescue of the Apraksin&#x27;s crew, more than 50 Finnish fishermen, who were stranded on a piece of drift ice in the Gulf of Finland, were saved by the icebreaker &quot;Yermak&quot; following distress telegrams sent by wireless telegraphy. In 1901 Alexander Popov was appointed as professor at the Electrotechnical Institute. In 1905 he was elected director of the institute.

==Death==

In 1905 he became seriously ill and died of a brain hemorrhage on 13 January 1906.

==Honors==
===Radio Day===
In 1945 on the 50th anniversary of Popov&#x27;s experiment the old Soviet Union made 7 May a new holiday, Radio Day, the day they claim Popov invented radio. Historians note this holiday may be more due to Cold War era politics than historical evidence. Radio Day is still officially marked in Russia and Bulgaria.

===Named after===
* A minor planet, 3074 Popov, discovered by Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Zhuravlyova in 1979. 
* Crater Popov on the back side of the Moon. 
* A huge conference room &quot;Alexander Stepanovich Popov&quot; at the ITU&#x27;s headquarters in Geneva was inaugurated at the ITU Telecom World 2011 by Igor Shchyogolev, Minister of Telecom and Mass Communications of the Russian Federation alongside Hamadoun Touré, Secretary General of the ITU.

<doc id="679869" wikidata="Q3402241" url="?curid=679869" title="Manorbier">
<text>Manorbier (; ) is a village, community and parish on the south coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales. The name means the &#x27;Manor of Pŷr&#x27;. The community includes Jameston, Lydstep and Manorbier Newton.

An electoral ward with the same name exists. It stretches inland to St Florence and at the 2011 Census, the population was 2,083. The area is served by the West Wales Line stopping at Manorbier railway station.

Manorbier is within the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park and is a popular tourist attraction with Manorbier Castle, St James&#x27;s Church, the sandy beach, cliffs, and part of the Wales Coast Path.

== History ==

Fossils can be found along the stream bed, although some are of poor quality, and along the cliffs to the side of the beach the rock formations are revealed as vertical beds. The evidence of early human habitation consists of many flint microliths from the Mesolithic and Neolithic ages, housed in local museums. The cromlech known as the King&#x27;s Quoit is south of Manorbier bay and beach.

Later evidence points to occupation of The Dak with the finding of a perforated mace head as well as Bronze Age burial mounds on the Ridgeway. Fortifications also seem to have been prominent including an Iron Age enclosure near Manorbier station and the site of a multivallate, meaning multiple ditches, promontory fort at Old Castle Head where there are remains of hut platforms within the ditches. A well-restored lime kiln is in Mud Lane behind the castle. To the east of Manorbier, on the side of the road to Lydstep, is an area of strip lynchets dating to early Anglo Saxon times and perhaps as early as the Bronze Age.

The Norman knight Odo de Barri was granted the lands of Manorbier, Penally and Begelly in gratitude for his military help in conquering Pembrokeshire after 1103. The first Manorbier Castle was motte and bailey style, with the stone walls being added in the next century by later Normans.

St James&#x27;s parish church dates from the 12th century and is a Grade I listed building. A large number of other buildings and structures in the parish are listed.

From 1933 to 1 September 1946, a mixed civil and military airfield was operational. During World War II it was a Royal Air Force airfield, RAF Manorbier. The site is now a firing range employed by the Royal Artillery as a testing range for high-velocity missiles.

<text>The Peugeot 104 is a supermini car produced by the French company Peugeot between 1972 and 1988. It was designed by Paolo Martin was initially only sold as a four-door saloon car, with a three-door hatchback variant introduced in 1974 and a five-door hatchback version replacing the saloon in 1976. The 104 was the first model produced at the company&#x27;s Mulhouse plant. It was also the first new Peugeot introduced since 1955 not to be offered in a diesel version.

== Production history ==

===Saloon (1972)===
The 104 was introduced at the September 1972 Paris Motor Show. On its launch, the Peugeot 104 was offered as a compact four-door fastback. Although it had a short, sloping rear end that suggested a hatchback, there was originally a separate boot/trunk, as on a conventional saloon. Power was provided from a 954 cc Douvrin engine called the PSA X engine, an all-aluminium alloy, chain driven overhead cam, with gearbox in the sump, sharing engine oil, which was jointly developed with Renault. This transmission-in-sump arrangement was similar to that pioneered by the British Motor Corporation in the Mini. It gave good levels of economy and refinement as well as having an impressive chassis which made ride and handling excellent. The engine was mounted leaning backwards, at a 72-degree angle.

===Coupé (1973)===
A three-door coupé was launched on a shortened chassis at the 1973 Paris Motor Show, featuring the same 954 cc engine as the saloon. Headlights were larger and rectangular in shape, rather than square. Originally sold as the &quot;104 Coupé&quot;, the shorter wheelbase models later received names beginning with a &quot;Z&quot; (e.g. ZL, ZA, ZS2). Equipment levels which begin with a &quot;G&quot; or an &quot;S&quot; were used for the longer four/five-door variants.

===1976 facelift===
A facelift in July 1976 saw the four-door saloon replaced with a five-door hatchback. Peugeot had been afraid that a five-door 104 would steal sales from the old-fashioned 204 Break, but with production of the 204 coming to an end in July 1976 this was no longer a concern. Rear light clusters were modified slightly with indicators that wrapped around to the sides of the car, and a 1.1-litre engine was also made available. The coupé was made available in two versions, the ZL and also the more powerful ZS with 66 PS. A modified camshaft on the 954 cc engines also retarded the valve timing in order to favour fuel economy at the price of a slight power reduction. The revised models only appeared in right-hand drive form at the end of the year. 1977 proved to be the most successful year for the 104, with 190,000 being built.

===1978 facelift===
The coupé gained a third (cheaper) commercial variant with only two seats, the ZA, and all coupé variants were given larger rear light clusters with integral reversing lights. Higher specification five-door models gained the larger headlights and grille introduced for the coupé. The more powerful engine from the ZS was briefly available in the five-door hatchback &quot;Sundgau&quot; special edition, of which 1,200 examples were built in March and April 1978. For 1979 the ZL Coupé was upgraded to a version of the 1,124 cc engine.

===1980 facelift===
The 1980 facelift was minor, with model designations changing in line with other vehicles in the Peugeot line-up. However, a 1.2-litre engine was now also offered (in the SR), with the same power as the lesser 1.1.

===1982 facelift===
This facelift incorporated smaller headlights, a new grille and rear light clusters that included reversing lights. The amount of chrome trim was reduced and generally replaced by black plastic. At the end of summer, the ZS coupé variant was given an 1,360 cc engine to improve its performance. The existing 72 PS version remained on sale at a lower price until the 1984 model year was introduced. The power gain was achieved by using two carburetors rather than one double-barrel unit.

===1983 on===
In 1983, the number of models offered was reduced to make way for the new 205 and exports to most foreign markets gradually came to an end. It remained on sale in France until the end of production in 1988. The sporting ZS remained on sale until late 1985; for the 1986 model year only the 1,124 cc engine remained. There was a minor facelift in 1987, introducing a new grille with three body-coloured horizontal bars and anthracite bumpers - now without a chrome band. The Z, Style Z, and five-door GLS continued to be available with this engine in the home market until 1988.

===ZS 2===
A limited run of 1,000 sporting ZS 2s were built in 1979. They were powered by a 1,360 cc four-cylinder engine.
== Prototypes ==
Several prototypes based on the 104 are known to exist. Different power sources were tried out, including electric and diesel. The M18 prototype (circa 1976) was a blue 5-door estate, with rear light clusters similar to those that were used on the 504 estate. The M23 was a dark red 3-door van concept based on the saloon rather than the existing 3-door coupé. A yellow three-box saloon (&quot;pictured&quot;) is also known, as is a white pick-up truck and the &quot;Peugette&quot; - a roadster prototype built on the 104 ZS platform.

== Related cars ==
=== Citroën LN / LNA ===
After Peugeot assumed control of Citroën in 1975, forming the PSA Group, the 104 coupé bodywork was shared with the 602 cc two-cylinder engined Citroën LN. In 1982 this car was fitted with the more modern 652 cc engine of the Visa in 1983 to become the LNA, before production ended in 1985.

=== Citroën Visa ===
The mechanical configuration of the 104 (with longer travel suspension), was also used in the Citroën Visa, leading to the abandonment of the Citroën Prototype Y plan for the Visa, although that plan went on to be used on Romanian-built cars. The Visa, unlike the LN / LNA, had its own distinctive body style and packaging. It remained in production until 1988, the same year as the 104&#x27;s demise. The Citroën C15 box van version of the Visa was in production with updated engines and transmissions until 2005.

=== Talbot Samba ===
A derivative of the 104 coupé with a slightly longer rear section, the Talbot Samba was launched in 1981, following Peugeot&#x27;s acquisition of Chrysler Europe (and its Talbot marque) in 1978. A cabriolet version of the Samba was developed. Production lasted until 1986.

== Market impact and replacement ==
The Peugeot 104 was one of the most successful European small cars of the 1970s but it was starting to show its age against more modern rivals by the turn of the 1980s. When Peugeot launched the stylish all-new 205 in 1983, the 104 was withdrawn from most European markets, but it continued in France as a budget choice until production finally ceased in May 1988 after 16 years, in which time 1,624,992 Peugeot 104s had been built. 345,849 of these were the short wheelbase Coupé versions.

As of 2019, only 12 Peugeot 104s remain taxed and on the roads in the United Kingdom with 24 on SORN.

<doc id="679878" wikidata="Q849964" url="?curid=679878" title="Jacket">
<text>A jacket is a garment for the upper body, usually extending below the hips. A jacket typically has sleeves and fastens in the front or slightly on the side. Jackets without sleeves are vests. A jacket is generally lighter, tighter-fitting, and less insulating than a coat, but both are outerwear. Some jackets are fashionable, while some others serve as protective clothing.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;jacket&quot; comes from the French word &quot;jaquette&quot;. The term comes from the Middle French noun &quot;jaquet&quot;, which refers to a small or lightweight tunic. In Modern French, &quot;jaquette&quot; is synonymous with &quot;jacket&quot;. Speakers of American English sometimes informally use the words &quot;jacket&quot; and &quot;coat&quot; interchangeably. The word is cognate with Spanish &quot;jaco&quot; and Italian &quot;giacca&quot; or &quot;giacchetta&quot;, first recorded around 1350s. It is ultimately loaned from Arabic &quot;shakk (شكّ)&quot;, which in turn loaned from Aramaic and Hebrew &quot;shaḳḳ (שַׁקּ)&quot;.

<text>Bercy () is a neighbourhood in the 12th arrondissement of Paris, France, the city&#x27;s 47th administrative neighbourhood.

==History==

Some of the oldest vestiges of human occupation in Paris were found on the territory of Bercy, dating from the late Neolithic (between 4000 and 3800 BC).

The name of Bercy, or Bercix, appeared for the first time in property deeds in the twelfth century. The area belonged for a time to the Montmorency family before passing to the Malons family, who had an old manor house expanded by François Le Vau into the Château de Bercy.

In the eighteenth century, a large site located along the Seine, contiguous to the Paris city limits of the time, began to be used as a warehousing area, particularly for wine. For two hundred years, the area was the thriving centre of the Paris wine trade and a place with a unique life and culture.

Bercy was formerly a commune. In 1860, when Paris annexed its suburban zone, the commune of Bercy was dissolved. The north-west portion of its territory was consolidated into Paris while the south-east portion, beyond the fortifications, was consolidated into Charenton-le-Pont.

==Features==
The area features a number of well-known landmarks:
* The Ministry of the Economy and Finance building (often known simply as &quot;Bercy&quot;), built in the 1980s; the extremity of the building plunges into the river Seine, where two fast boats dedicated to VIP transportation are moored.
* The &quot;Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy&quot; (POPB) is a large sports hall often used for concerts. It is now called AccorHotels Arena 
* The Parc de Bercy
* The Cinémathèque Française, formerly the American Center, designed by Frank Gehry
* The Cour Saint-Émilion shopping complex
* The UGC Ciné Cité Bercy movie complex
* The Musée des Arts Forains (&quot;The Fairground Art Museum&quot;).

Line 14 of the Métro crosses the neighbourhood. There are two stations: Bercy and Cour Saint-Émilion.

<doc id="679888" wikidata="Q1010177" url="?curid=679888" title="Caerwent">
<text>Caerwent () is a village and community in Monmouthshire, Wales. It is located about five miles west of Chepstow and 11 miles east of Newport. It was founded by the Romans as the market town of &quot;Venta Silurum&quot;, an important settlement of the Brythonic Silures tribe. The modern village is built around the Roman ruins, which are some of the best-preserved in Europe. It remained prominent through the Roman era and Early Middle Ages as the site of a road crossing between several important civic centres. The community includes Llanvair Discoed. The village itself had a population of about 1,200.

==Etymology==
The modern name derives from &quot;Venta&quot;, an ancient British word denoting a &quot;market&quot;, and Caer, a later Welsh word denoting a fortified settlement. The town would give its name to the post Roman successor kingdom of Gwent and it is possible that the modern name means &quot;Fort of Gwent&quot;.

Romans writers recorded the town as &quot;Venta Silurum&quot; to distinguish it from the other tribal markets in Britain such as Venta Belgarum (modern Winchester) and Venta Icenorum (modern Caistor St Edmund).

==History==
===Roman times===

Caerwent was founded by the Romans in AD 75 as a market town for the defeated Silures tribe. This is confirmed by inscriptions on the &quot;Civitas Silurum&quot; stone, now on display in the parish church. Large sections of the Roman town walls are still in place, rising up to high in places. Historian John Newman has described the walls as: &quot;easily the most impressive town defence to survive from Roman Britain, and in its freedom from later rebuilding one of the most perfectly preserved in Northern Europe.&quot; In 1881, a portion of a highly intricate coloured floor mosaic or tessellated pavement, depicting different types of fish, was unearthed during excavations in the garden of a cottage.

Excavations in 1971 dated the north-west polygonal angle-tower to the mid-300s. Further excavations were carried out in 2008 by Wessex Archaeology and was featured in the Channel 4 TV programme &quot;Time Team&quot;.

Modern houses are built on top of half the site of the old Roman market place. The ruins of several Roman buildings are still visible, including the foundations of a 4th-century Roman temple with a Temenos area. The rudimentary quality of most of the houses, few of which had mosaic or hypocaust-heated floors, indicates that, although a large settlement, Caerwent did not attain the importance or sophistication of other Romano-British tribal capitals.

===Early Christian times===
Caerwent was a centre for the Kingdom of Gwent after the Roman occupation. The name Caerwent translates from Welsh as &quot;fort of Gwent&quot;, and the name Gwent derives from the Roman name &quot;Venta (Silurum)&quot;. The English town name of Winchester has a parallel derivation, ultimately from the combination of the Latin words &quot;Venta&quot;, in that case, &quot;Venta Belgarum&quot;, and &quot;castra&quot;.

Caerwent remained an important centre, where the road between Gloucester and Caerleon met the north–south road from Shrewsbury, via Monmouth and Trellech, to the sea at Portskewett. Excavations at Caerwent have revealed remains and everyday objects from the post-Roman period. Metalwork, including elaborate penannular brooches and fastening pins, have been dated to the 5th–7th centuries. A large number of Christian burials, some stone-lined, dating from between the 4th and 9th centuries have also been discovered, both around the town&#x27;s East Gate and close to the parish church. It has been suggested that it may have been the birthplace of St. Patrick.
A monastery was established at Caerwent some time before the 10th century, and a pre-Norman cross head was discovered at the site in 1992. The Church of St Stephen and St Tathan is dedicated to Saints Stephen and Tathan, the latter name possibly having arisen through confusion with Saint Tathyw. The oldest existing part of the church dates to the 13th century.

The village appears as &quot;Venta Siluru&quot; and &quot;Caer went&quot; on the Cambriae Typus map of 1573.

==Modern era==
During World War II, a Royal Navy Propellant Factory was established at Caerwent, immediately north of the A48 road. Between 1967 and 1993, this was used as a storage station for the Royal Air Force and the United States Army; since that time it has been used as an army training facility and on occasion as a filming location for TV episodes such as Doctor Who &quot;Before the Flood&quot; and large-scale productions such as &quot;Captain America: The First Avenger&quot;.

Caerwent is now a small village, largely bypassed by the busy A48 road running between the city of Newport to the west and Chepstow to the east. The Northgate Inn closed in 2013, leaving the Coach and Horses as the only village pub. The Post Office thrives and was recently refitted. The village has a garage which has been repairing cars since 1917.

==Governance==
An electoral ward in the same name exists. The area and population of this ward are identical to that of the parish.

<text>Mike Lange (March 3, 1948 – February 19, 2025) was an American sportscaster best known for his 46-year career as a play-by-play announcer for the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League (NHL). Lange served as the team&#x27;s play-by-play announcer in 1974 and again from 1976 to 2021. In 2001, he received the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award for his outstanding work as an NHL broadcaster.

==Career==
In 1969, while attending Sacramento State University, Lange was encouraged by his friend to attend a hockey game. At the time, Lange had never attended a hockey game before.

From there, Lange worked in the penalty box at local arenas, coordinating the penalty time with the public address (PA) announcer. He eventually replaced the PA announcer after he asked for a raise and his play-by-play was broadcast over the college radio station.

Lange joined the Pittsburgh Penguins as a radio announcer in 1974 after spending time as a commentator for the San Diego Gulls and Phoenix Roadrunners of the Western Hockey League. He left the Penguins after just one season, because the team was in bankruptcy and he had no guarantee of a job. Lange called Washington Diplomats soccer games, then returned to the Penguins for the 1976–77 season, where he became the central figure of the team&#x27;s broadcast presence.
From 1976 until 2006, Lange served as the lead play-by-play announcer for the Penguins&#x27; radio and television network, never missing a broadcast. In 2001, Lange was the recipient of the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award for his outstanding work as an NHL broadcaster. On June 29, 2006, citing a desire to go in a new direction, Fox Sports Pittsburgh (now SportsNet Pittsburgh) did not exercise the option year on Lange&#x27;s contract. He was replaced by his longtime radio partner and color commentator, Paul Steigerwald, in a move that was extremely unpopular with fans. On taking Lange&#x27;s spot Steigerwald said, &quot;I&#x27;m not going to try to replace him. I think he&#x27;s irreplaceable.&quot;
On August 4, 2006, Lange signed a contract to work on Penguins&#x27; radio broadcasts. 

From 1985 to 1986, he also broadcast several NHL games for ESPN that did not involve the Pittsburgh Penguins. In 1986 and 1987, he also called Pittsburgh Pirates baseball games on cable television.

Lange and then-colleague Steigerwald appeared together as themselves in the 1995 movie &quot;Sudden Death&quot;, starring Jean-Claude Van Damme. In the film, Lange used many of his trademark expressions in his play-by-play commentary.

On October 8, 2019, prior to a game against the Winnipeg Jets, Lange was presented with an autographed personalized jersey to commemorate his 45th year.

On August 9, 2021, the Pittsburgh Penguins announced that Lange would be retiring after a 46-year career with the Penguins.

== Personal life and death ==
Lange was born in Sacramento, California, on March 3, 1948.

He died in his home in Pittsburgh, on February 19, 2025, at the age of 76.

<text>Ewenny () is a village and community (parish) on the River Ewenny in the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales.

Over the years the village has grown into the neighbouring village of Corntown to such an extent that there is no longer a clear boundary between the two. The nearest town of significant size is Bridgend, away. Corntown is within the community.

In 1987, scenes from the Doctor Who episode Delta and the Bannermen were filmed in the village.

==History==
===Ewenny Priory===
The village grew around the Priory and Church. The Norman church of St. Michael was built in the 12th century by one of the Norman knights of Glamorgan, William de Londres. His son Maurice founded the adjacent Benedictine priory in 1141 when he granted the church to the abbey of St. Peter at Gloucester, together with the churches of St Brides Major, St. Michael at Colwinston and the manor at Lampha.

The priory is widely regarded as one of the finest fortified religious buildings in Britain. 
Over the centuries the priory has sustained some damage, but nonetheless it is still inhabited by its current owners, the Turbervill family. The priory is not open to the public but the attached Church is still in use today.

===Potteries===

Records show that the pottery industry has existed in the area since 1427. This is probably because the materials required for the production of pottery are readily available in this area, including a local red earthenware, glaze materials, stone to build the kilns and coal to fire the pots in the kilns. There have been fifteen potteries in the Ewenny area at one time or another, all small family concerns.

The village is home to the Ewenny Pottery, founded in 1610 and the oldest working pottery in Wales. The business is run by the descendants of the pottery&#x27;s original founders, the Jenkins family.

===The Legend of the White Lady===
Close to Ewenny Priory is an area of land known as White Lady&#x27;s meadow and White Lady&#x27;s Lane. It is said that the area is haunted by the &quot;Y Ladi Wen&quot; or the White Lady ghost. Few details are available about the ghost, but it is generally believed that she committed some terrible misdeed in the past and now her spirit must roam the earth in penance. There is a similar legend associated with Ogmore Castle. As these two locations are within a couple of miles of each other it is likely that the legends are related, or inspired by each other.

==Other Points of Interest==
The nearby Coed-y-Bwl nature reserve, more locally known as the &quot;Daffodil woods&quot; has around a quarter of a million ‘wild’ daffodils. The reserve was established in 1971 and in 1975 received a Prince of Wales trust award. The daffodils were planted in the early 19th century by Mrs Nicholl of Merthyr Mawr.

A Roman bridge is situated near the reserve.

==Governance==
Ewenny has a community council which elects or co-opts eight community councillors. Until 2022 the community was part of the county ward of Llandow/Ewenny for elections to the Vale of Glamorgan Council. It was transferred to the St Brides Major ward as a result of recommendations from the Local Democracy and Boundary Commission for Wales.

<text>Yan, known in historiography as the Southern Yan (; 398–410), was a dynastic state of China ruled by the Murong clan of the Xianbei during the era of Sixteen Kingdoms. Its founder Murong De (Emperor Xianwu) was a son of Murong Huang (Emperor Wenming) and brother of Murong Jun (Emperor Jingzhao) and Murong Chui (Emperor Chengwu), and therefore was an imperial prince of both the Former Yan and Later Yan dynasties.

All rulers of the Southern Yan declared themselves &quot;emperors&quot;. Initially ruling from Huatai (滑台, in modern Anyang, Henan) in northern Henan, they later moved to Shandong and established Guanggu (廣固, in modern Qingzhou, Shandong) as their capital. As one of many Yan states from the period, they were given the prefix of &quot;Southern&quot; by historiographers to distinguish them with the others as they were based south of the Yellow River.

== History ==

=== Background ===
Murong De was the son of Murong Huang, the founder of the Former Yan dynasty. He was an accomplished military general for the Former Yan, then the Di-led Former Qin after they conquered Yan in 370, and finally the Later Yan, a restoration of the Former Yan founded by his brother, Murong Chui. Under Later Yan, De was trusted by Chui as a key advisor in his administration, and after Chui&#x27;s son, Murong Bao, ascended the throne in 396, he was made to overlook the southern empire from Ye.

However, soon after Bao&#x27;s succession, the Northern Wei launched a large-scale invasion of Later Yan. The Central Plains was quickly overran by Wei, and Murong Bao was forced to abandon his capital, Zhongshan (中山, in modern Baoding, Hebei) and evacuate to Longcheng in Liaoning. Initially, Murong De held firmly to Ye and parts of the south, but at the advice of his nephew, Murong Lin, who previously declared himself emperor at Zhongshan but fled to Ye as Wei captured the city, he decided to abdondon Ye for Huatai (滑台, in modern Anyang, Henan) in 398.

=== Reign of Murong De ===
At Huatai, Murong De took the title of Prince of Yan, thus splitting the Yan into two. Historiographers distinguish Murong De&#x27;s state with the other Yan states as the Southern Yan. De nearly captured and killed Murong Bao when the latter came to Huatai, unaware that his uncle had declared independence, but Bao managed to escape back north.

In 399, disorder broke out in Southern Yan when Fu Guang (苻廣), a remnant of the Fu clan of Former Qin, rebelled in an attempt to restore his state. Murong De campaigned against and defeated him, but while he was away, a traitor opened the gates of Huatai to Northern Wei forces, leaving Murong De stranded without any territory. He decided to attack Qing Province of the Eastern Jin dynasty, which corresponds to modern central and eastern Shandong. He took the province with ease, establishing the city of Guanggu (廣固, in modern Qingzhou, Shandong) as his new capital. In 400, he elevated his title to Emperor of Yan and changed his name to Murong Beide.

For the rest of Murong Beide&#x27;s reign, Southern Yan was peaceful and prosperous to live in. As Yan had a much smaller population compared to the neighbouring Wei and Jin, Beide enacted policies to encourage manpower movement such as corvee exemptions while also rectifying the household registry. At the time, Jin was in turmoil due to Huan Xuan&#x27;s rebellion, and Southern Yan welcomed a number of Jin exiles into their territory. Murong De also planned to take advantage of the situation in Jin by launching an invasion, but became ill and died in 405. 

=== Reign of Murong Chao ===
Murong De did not have any living sons prior to his death, the throne was passed on to his nephew, Murong Chao. Chao had previously been a beggar in Later Qin and was almost immediately made heir when he arrived at Guanggu in 405. Records accuse Chao of initially having great potential, but turning cruel and capricious upon becoming emperor. During his reign, Chao purged his uncle&#x27;s retainers like Murong Zhong while elevating his own confidants, particularly Gongsun Wulou, to power, which brought the government into disarray. In 407, wanting to retrieve his mother and wife who were still in Later Qin, Chao agreed to become a vassal and give up his court musicians in return for their safe passage to Southern Yan. 

In 409, Murong Chao attacked the Jin for prisoners to be trained as new musicians. This prompted an invasion of Southern Yan by the Jin general Liu Yu. Liu Yu defeated the Southern Yan army at the Battle of Linqu and then besieged Guanggu. The Later Qin, held down by their war with the Helian Xia, was unable to send reinforcements to Southern Yan, and Liu Yu eventually took Guanggu in 410. Murong Chao was captured and executed and Southern Yan was annexed by Jin.

<doc id="679919" wikidata="Q898804" url="?curid=679919" title="Girdler sulfide process">
<text>The Girdler sulfide (GS) process, also known as the GeibSpevack (GS) process, is an industrial production method for extracting heavy water (deuterium oxide, D2O) from natural water. Heavy water is used in particle research, in deuterium NMR spectroscopy, deuterated solvents for proton NMR spectroscopy, heavy water nuclear reactors (as a coolant and moderator) and deuterated drugs.

In 1943, Karl-Hermann Geib and Jerome S. Spevack independently invented the process.The process is named after the Gildler Company, which constructed the first American plant to implement it.

The method is an isotopic exchange process, where isotopes of hydrogen are swapped between hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and water (H2O), also known as &quot;light&quot; water, that produces heavy water over several steps. This process is highly energy intensive.

Until its closure in 1997, the Bruce Heavy Water Plant in Ontario (located on the same site as Douglas Point and the Bruce Nuclear Generating Station) was the world&#x27;s largest heavy water production plant, with a peak capacity of 1600 tonnes per year (800 tonnes per year per full plant, two fully operational plants at its peak). It used the Girdler sulfide process to produce heavy water, and required by mass 340000 units of feed water to produce 1 unit of heavy water.

The first such facility of India&#x27;s Heavy Water Board to use the Girdler process is at Rawatbhata near Kota, Rajasthan. This was followed by a larger plant at Manuguru, Andhra Pradesh. Other plants exist in the United States and Romania for example. Romania, India and the former supplier of much of the world&#x27;s heavy water demand, Canada, all have operating heavy water reactors with two at Cernavoda Nuclear Power Plant in Romania making up the country&#x27;s entire fleet and several each in India (mostly IPHWR) and Canada (exclusively CANDU).

== The process ==
Each of a number of steps consists of two sieve tray columns. One column is maintained at and is called the &#x27;cold tower&#x27; and the other at and is called the &#x27;hot tower&#x27;. The enrichment process is based on the difference in separation between 30°C and 130°C.

The process of interest is the equilibrium reaction,

At 30°C, the equilibrium constant K = 2.33, while at 130°C, K = 1.82. This difference is exploited for enriching deuterium in heavy water.

Hydrogen sulfide gas is circulated in a closed loop between the &quot;cold tower&quot; and the &quot;hot tower&quot; (although these can be separate towers, they can also be separate sections of one tower, with the cold section at the top). Demineralised and deaerated water is fed to the cold tower where deuterium migration preferentially takes place from the hydrogen sulfide gas to the liquid water. Normal water is fed to the hot tower where deuterium transfer takes place from the liquid water to the hydrogen sulfide gas. In cascade systems, the same water is used for both inputs. The mechanism for this is the difference in the equilibrium constant; in the cold tower, deuterium concentration in the hydrogen sulfide is lowered, and the concentration in the water raised. The deuterium in the hot loop slightly prefers to be in the hydrogen sulfide, resulting in excess deuterium in the hydrogen sulfide relative to the cold tower. For n moles of deuterium per mole of protium in the hot tower input water, there are moles per mole of protium in the hydrogen sulfide. In the cold tower, part of this deuterium is transferred to the cold tower input water, in accordance with the equilibrium constant. At the input to the cold tower, the ratio of products to reactants in the above equation is 1.82, since both input streams have equal concentrations of deuterium. The chemical equilibrium tries to force more deuterium into the water to correct the ratio. Ideally for equal amounts of water and hydrogen sulfide, the cold tower should output water with 12% more deuterium than it entered. Enriched water is output from the cold tower, while depleted water is output from the hot tower. 

An appropriate cascade system accomplishes enrichment: enriched water is fed into another separation unit and is further enriched. 

Normally in this process, water is enriched to 1520% D2O. Further enrichment to &quot;reactor-grade&quot; heavy water (&gt; 99% D2O) is done in another process, e.g. distillation.

<text>The Renault 4, or R4 in short (and 4L, pronounced &quot;Quatrelle&quot;, in French), is an economy car built by the French company Renault from 1961 to 1994. Although the Renault 4 was first marketed as a short estate or wagon, its minimal rear overhang, and its top-hinged, single-piece tail-gate made it the world&#x27;s first mass-produced hatchback car, as well as the first time Renault had used a front-wheel-drive layout in a family car. A bare-bones, entry-level Renault 3, or R3 was also offered in 1961/1962.

The car was launched at a time when several decades of economic stagnation were giving way to growing prosperity and surging car ownership in France. The first million cars were produced by 1 February 1966, less than four and a half years after launch; eventually over eight million were built, making the Renault 4 a commercial success because of the timing of its introduction and the merits of its design. Inearly 2020, the 33-year production run of the Renault 4 was counted as the seventeenth most long-lived single generation car in history.

==Origins and strategy==

The Renault 4 was Renault&#x27;s response to the 1948 Citroën 2CV. Renault was able to review the advantages and disadvantages of the 2CV design. The Citroën had made motoring available to low-income people in France, and especially to farmers and other people in rural areas, for whom the car was as much a working tool as personal transport. The 2CV had been designed in the 1930s for use in the French countryside where the road network was poor — speed was not a requirement but a good ride, useful rough-terrain ability, a versatile body for load carrying, and economy and simplicity of operation were its key considerations. However, by the late 1950s, the 2CV was becoming outdated. Rural roads in France were improved and the national system of autoroutes was being developed. Agriculture was becoming more mechanized with fewer smallholdings and family farms for which the 2CV was designed. The Citroën had also proved popular with people living in towns and cities as affordable, economical transport but the 2CV&#x27;s rural design brief made it less than ideal as a city car and, despite improvements, the late-1950s 2CV had a top speed of just . Its air-cooled two-cylinder engine was reliable and economical but noisy and offered poor performance. The 2CV&#x27;s suspension gave it an excellent ride and good grip and handling but was mechanically complex with many moving parts that required regular maintenance and lubrication at intervals as low as every 1000 miles (1600km). With its roots in the 1930s, the 2CV&#x27;s styling was also outdated and, with its separate wing/fenders, had a relatively narrow and cramped body for its overall footprint. While the Citroën had been designed during the Great Depression when money was tight and living standards were relatively low, by the 1960s the French economy was growing and people would be able to afford a more modern, refined, and less utilitarian small car.

In early 1956, Renault Chairman Pierre Dreyfus launched this new project: designing a new model to replace the rear engined 4CV and compete against the Citroën 2CV that would become an everyman&#x27;s car, capable of satisfying the needs of most consumers. It would be a family car, a woman&#x27;s car, a farmer&#x27;s car, or a city car. Dreyfus summed up his intention for project by requesting his staff produce &quot;a blue jeans car&quot; — a car that, like the denim trousers that were becoming increasingly popular as casual wear fashion items at the time, could be as useful for recreation as for work, and be appealing to customers of all demographics. 

The Renault 4 shared many design traits with the older Citroën 2CV to allow it to fulfill the same role as a versatile utility car, especially for people in rural France and other parts of the world with poor roads. It had a large structural platform with a separate body. It had front-wheel drive, long-travel fully independent suspension, and rack and pinion steering. It had a simple body with minimal equipment, a large space for cargo or luggage, and &#x27;deckchair&#x27; seats which could be easily removed. However, the Renault 4 updated this basic concept with a larger four-cylinder water-cooled engine with a sealed cooling system offering much better refinement and performance than the contemporary 2CV, with a top speed of over . The suspension consisted of torsion bars which required no regular maintenance. The boxy full-width body offered more space for both passengers and luggage than the similar-sized 2CV and the car boasted an early hatchback body for greater practicality.

==Launch of the R3 and R4==
Renault launched the Renault 3 and the Renault 4 simultaneously in July 1961. The cars shared the same body and most mechanical components, but the R3 was powered by a 603 cc version of the engine while the R4 featured a 747 cc engine. This placed the R3 in the 3CV taxation class while the R4 was in the 4CV class. Maximum power output was rated by Renault as for the R3, and for the R4, depending on price level and the type of carburettor fitted. Initially the base versions of the R3 and R4 came with a thick C-pillar behind each of the rear doors. Quarter glass was a 400 franc option for the basic R4. The extra visibility increased the weight of the vehicle, but these windows soon became standard for all R4s.

The R3 and R4 were targeted at the Citroën 2CV that employed soft springs and long wheel travel to absorb bumps on rough roads. The Renault 3/4 applied the same approach and two models appeared at the Paris Motor Show in 1961 on a specialized demonstration display that incorporated an irregular rolling road. Visitors could sit inside a car, which remained undisturbed while the suspension absorbed the erratic bumps of the rolling road. In 1962 Renault employed the same display at the Turin Motor Show.

The basic version of the R3 was priced 40 francs below the lowest-priced version of the Citroën 2CV in 1961 and featured painted bumpers and grille, a simplified instrument panel, a single sun visor, no windshield washer, and no interior door trim panels. This trim was also offered with the more powerful R4 engine. The R4L with six side windows, chrome-colored bumper and grille, as well as a less spartan interior cost 400 francs (roughly 8%) more than the R4 with its four side windows. However, as with the Renault 4CV &quot;Service&quot; in 1953, customers shunned the basic model and in October 1962, the Renault R3 was discontinued, along with the most basic version of the Renault 4.

A &quot;Super&quot; version (branded &quot;de Luxe&quot; in some export markets) with opening rear quarter-light windows and extra trim was also offered. The de Luxe and Super versions of the R4L received a version of the engine from the Renault Dauphine giving them an engine capacity of 845 cc. After the withdrawal of the 603 cc engined R3, the 747 cc R4 model continued to be listed with an entry-level recommended retail price, but the slightly larger-engined L versions were more popular. By 1965, Renault had removed the extra &quot;R&quot; from their model names: the Renault R4L thus became the Renault 4L.

==Engines==

Early versions of the Renault R4 used engines and transmissions from the Renault 4CV. The original design brief called for an engine size between 600 cc and 700 cc, but there was no consensus as to whether to use a four-cylinder unit or to follow Citroën with a two-cylinder unit. With Volkswagen rapidly growing market share across Europe and North America, Renault also gave serious consideration to an air-cooled boxer motor option for the forthcoming R3/R4. However, using the existing water-cooled unit from the 4CV was a solution, especially in view of the extended period of teething troubles encountered by the Renault Frégate, which was then Renault&#x27;s most recent attempt to develop an innovative powerplant. The existing engines were larger than that specified by management for the new 4CV, but the automaker addressed this by reducing the bore so that the overall capacity of the base engine for the new R3 worked out to be 603 cc, comfortably at the lower end of the required 600–700 cc range. However, since Renault already produced the 747 cc version of the engine that was well proven in the 4CV, it made sense to use this as well in what would in many respects be the older car&#x27;s successor. Therefore, in 1961, the R3 had a 49 mm bore and 80 mm stroke, while the R4 received the 54.5 mm × 80 mm existing engine.

Moving the engine from the rear of the 4CV to the front of the new model involved significant planning: design changes to the unit were introduced as part of the process. The inlet manifold was now a steel casting whereas on the 4CV it had been constructed of a light-weight alloy: this was driven by cost considerations now that aluminum was not so inexpensive as it had been fifteen years earlier. Renault also took the opportunity to introduce a feature which subsequently became mainstream. Renault also designed a &quot;sealed-for-life&quot; cooling system, supported by a small expansion tank on the right side of the engine bay. The cooling system contained antifreeze intended to enable operation without topping up or other intervention throughout a car&#x27;s life provided ambient temperatures below -40°C were avoided.

The engines were larger than the small 425 cc (later 602 cc and 29 PS), engines in the 2CV. The R4 always had a four-cylinder watercooled engine. The original Renault R4&#x27;s engine capacity of 747 cc served to differentiate the model from the more powerful Renault Dauphine, but the Dauphine&#x27;s 845 cc engine was used in the 4 itself from 1963 onwards: for most markets at this stage the Dauphine engine now came as standard in the top of the range Renault R4 Super, and was available in some other versions only as an optional extra. Given that Renault’s 603, 747, and 845 cc engines all shared the same cylinder stroke and were all of the same basic design, it is likely that there was very little difference between the manufacturing costs of the basic engine block between the three. These three did fall within different taxation classes (3CV, 4CV, and 5CV respectively) but at this end of the market tax levels were by now less of an issue in those European countries that still taxed cars according to engine size.

With time, the increasing trend to the production of Renault 4s in a wide range of countries reduces the validity of generalized statements as to which engines were fitted when: in French-built cars the old 845 cc engine continued in the low versions until the mid-1980s, but in 1978 the top-end Renault 4 GTLs received the new 1108 cc engine: this engine was not new to Renault, however, being the five-bearing &quot;Sierra&quot; engine, first installed in the Estafette van and R8 in the summer of 1962. A smaller version (956 cc) of this new engine finally replaced the by now venerable 845 cc engine in the 4 in 1986. Unlike the original &quot;Billancourt&quot; engine from the 4CV, the Sierra engine rotated in a clockwise direction, so fitting it required reversing the direction of the differential in the gear box in order to avoid producing a car with one forward speed and four reverse speeds.

==Transmission==
The initial transmission was a three-speed manual, described by one critic as an obsolete feature when compared to the four-speed manual of the then thirteen-year-old Citroën 2CV. Ironically the new Renault 4 did not inherit its transmission from the Renault 4CV nor from anyone else: the transmission was newly developed for the car. The dash-mounted gear lever was linked via a straight horizontal rod that passed over the longitudinally mounted engine and clutch directly to the gearbox right at the front. The resulting absence of any linkage at floor level permitted a flat floor across the full width of the car&#x27;s cabin. Synchromesh featured only on the top two ratios, even though the low power of the engine required frequent gear changes by drivers using normal roads and wishing to make reasonable progress. On this point Renault quickly acknowledged their error and cars produced from 1962 featured synchromesh on all three ratios. In 1968 the Renault 4 finally received a four-speed transmission.

==Structure and running gear==

The three principal new models introduced by Renault since the war featured monocoque &quot;chassisless&quot; construction that was less expensive to manufacture process and reduced operating costs because of lower vehicle weight. The Renault R3/R4 design defied this by now widely accepted mantra, employing a separate platform to which the body shell was then attached. The body&#x27;s structural role in maintaining the overall rigidity of the car body was thereby reduced, placing less stress on the roof and allowing for thinner window pillars. Although the use made of a separate platform resembled, in some respects, the use that pre-war designs would have made of a chassis, the outcome was a structure described as semi-monocoque, and it would later allow Renault to use the R4 platform, with very little modification, to build new models such as the Renault 6 and Rodeo. (Later, the successful Renault 5 used the R4 running gear, but in a monocoque shell).

==Suspension==

The R3 and R4 had four-wheel torsion-bar independent suspension. This was an innovation that would be copied on a succession of subsequent front-engined Renaults introduced during the 1960s and 70s.

The car features a shorter wheelbase on the left than on the right because the rear wheels are not mounted directly opposite one another. This concept allowed a very simple design of the rear suspension using transverse torsion bars located one behind the other without affecting handling. The front torsion bars were longitudinal.
The fixed end of the torsion bars is mounted on quadrants that can be adjusted via a holes/fixing bolt arrangement. This enables the suspension to be &quot;beefed up&quot; and the ground clearance increased. With specialist tools provided by Renault, adjustments can be made to provide the light 4L some off-road capabilities. This feature, along with the installation of a thick protecting aluminum plate under the engine, has been used by off-road drivers and student 4L Trophy entrants. Damping was provided by hydraulic telescopic shock absorbers on all four wheels. Those at the rear were mounted virtually horizontally which avoided the intrusion of rear suspension componentry into the flat-floored passenger cabin.

The longitudinal layout of the front-wheel drive engine and transmission with the engine behind the front axle, and gearbox/differential in front, is identical to the Citroën Traction Avant. The suspension is similar with the difference being the deletion of the Citroën&#x27;s flexible beam between the rear wheels to give the Renault 4 fully independent rear suspension.

==Around the world==
*In Colombia, the Renault 4 was one of the highest-selling vehicles. Many Colombians nicknamed it &quot;&quot; (Faithful friend) due to its popularity. The vehicle was manufactured at the SOFASA plant in Envigado (Medellín) from 1970 to 1992. Two of the most popular versions included the Master (1,022 cc) and the Líder (Leader), which had a more powerful 1,300 cc engine. The first Renault 4 was actually called &quot;Azul Pastrana&quot;, named after President Misael Pastrana inaugurated the Renault plant in Envigado, Colombia.
*In Argentina and Chile the 4 van (Fourgonette) is known as &quot;, following the nickname given to the Citroën 2CV van, &quot;. Due to heavy taxation on passenger vehicles in the late 1950s, the first 2CVs were imported unfinished, only up to the front doors and completed with an Argentine-made pickup truck bed. The Spanish word for pickup truck is &quot;camioneta&quot;, hence &quot;Renoleta&quot;.
*In Italy the 4 was produced by the Alfa Romeo factory in Milan under license from 1962 to 1964. 41,809 R4s were built there.
*In Australia the car was produced between 1962 and 1966 in Heidelberg, Victoria but ceased production to make way for other models
*In Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia the car was known as &quot;Mali div&quot; (Little giant) or &quot;četvorka&quot;
*In Finland, the car was known as &quot;&quot;Tipparellu&quot; (Drop Rellu) from the marketing slogan &quot;No grease, no water, just a drop of fuel&quot; and as it had excellent fuel economy. &quot;Rellu&quot; is the common nickname for Renault cars in Finland.
*In Mexico, the Renault 4 was produced in Ciudad Sahagún, an industrial city created by DINA and Renault in the fifties. Renault production ceased in 1976.
*In Ireland the car was first produced in a plant established in 1962 in Naas, and production was transferred to a new factory established in Wexford in 1972, production running until 1984.
*In Slovenia (formerly part of Yugoslavia) the Renault 4, nicknamed &quot;Katrca&quot; or &quot;štirica&quot;&quot; (from French &quot;quatre&quot;, four), was produced in the Industrija motornih vozil (IMV) plant from 1973 to 1992. 575,960 R4s were built there. In 1989 the plant was sold to Group Renault and renamed REVOZ d.d.
*In Portugal it had a CKD assembly line in Guarda from 1964 to 1989 where more than 190,000 units were assembled. It was known as &quot;Quatro L&quot; (four L) .
*In Spain the Renault 4L is known as &quot;Cuatro latas&quot; (four tins).
*In East Africa it became known as the &quot;Roho&quot;. In Swahili Roho means spirit, soul or character perhaps reflecting the affection the vehicle gained. 
*On September 7, 2013, Pope Francis accepted a white 1984 4L which had done 300,000 km (200,000 miles), offered to him by father Renzo Zocca from Verona.

==Design==
The Renault 4 was a basic car with a simple dashboard and sliding windows. Suspension and seats were designed for comfort, and ventilation and the heater were effective.

The Renault 4 was not significantly changed during its production. Exterior chrome trim was eventually phased out on all models, and aluminium grilles were replaced with plastic. There were three different dashboard designs. On the right side of the car at the back the position of the fuel filler was raised by approximately less than a year after the car&#x27;s launch; other than that, changes to the body panels were limited to a slightly altered hood and hinges.

Renault developed new small cars, the Renault 6 and the Renault 5, while the Renault 4 was still selling well. The Renault 5 competed in a somewhat different sector (three-and five-door supermini). The Renault 4 is intermediate between the small utility vehicle (2CV) and the supermini design (R5, Peugeot 205).

==Variants==
There were many different &#x27;special edition&#x27; Renault 4s. Some (including the Safari, Sixties, and Jogging) were sold in special colour schemes, upholstery and other details, while others (Clan, Savane) were standard models with special decals.

There were also special models that were not solely a marketing exercise, such as the Renault 4 Sinpar 4x4, the Plein Air, a pickup truck, LPG versions, and electric versions.

The Plein Air was a doorless and roofless version originally developed to meet a 1964 request by the French Army. Sinpar&#x27;s version, called the Sinpar 4x4 Torpedo, was first shown as a prototype at the 1968 Geneva Salon, equipped with Sinpar&#x27;s four-wheel-drive system. Sinpar was quickly given a contract to build a front-wheel-drive version at their works in Colombes near Paris; it appeared in May 1968. Called the Plein Air (meaning &quot;Open Air&quot;), it had no doors, with only a chain protecting the passengers. A military contract did not materialize but Renault and Sinpar attempted to ride the late sixties/early seventies buggy wave in marketing it as a fun beach car. Being more expensive and less capable than the Citroën Méhari it did not catch on and was discontinued in March 1970, after only 563 had been built. In 1989, Colombian SOFASA produced the variants &quot;Brisa&quot; (Breeze) which was based on the French &quot;Plein Air&quot; and &quot;Jogging&quot;, which was marketed as a sportier version of the car and featured red accessories.

In 1978, the &quot;R4 GTL&quot; arrived. It had the 1108 cc engine from the Renault 6 TL, albeit with the performance reduced for better economy, and bigger drum brakes. The GTL was identifiable by its grey front grille, grey bumpers, and grey plastic strips along the bottoms of the doors. It also had an extra air intake below the front grille (as a result, the registration plate was moved down to the bumper), and 12 inch (304.8 mm) wiper blades instead of the original 10 inch (254 mm) ones. For the 1983 model year, the GTL got front disc brakes, the handbrake now working on the rear wheels, and there were a modified dashboard and cloth seats. The Renault 4 was the last French automobile to be sold with drum brakes on all four wheels, after the Citroën 2CV received disc brakes in 1981. The very first 1983 models had the handbrake lever moved from left to right under the steering wheel before it was moved to the floor like in almost any other car by then.

There was also a panel van (Fourgonnette) version of the R4, which with its &quot;high cube&quot; bodyshell and the unique &#x27;giraffon&#x27; (giraffe hatch) at the rear became the idiosyncratic French &quot;Boulangerie&quot; van. For many years, this was a successful vehicle of its type and for many customers, as it represents their idea of a Renault 4 more than a passenger version. It remained on sale in Europe until 1993 and was replaced by the Renault Express (called Extra in UK and Ireland, Rapid in Germany), which was based on the second generation Renault 5 &#x27;Supercinq&#x27;.

==End of the R4==
Though reasons such as emissions and safety legislation are often given for the Renault 4&#x27;s demise in Europe during the 1980s, it would appear that its popularity would not have lasted. Outmoded production methods, more advanced competition and the reasons outlined above meant that the Renault 4&#x27;s days were numbered, at least as a mainstream product. And Renault was already enjoying huge sales success with the far more modern R5, which was only slightly more expensive. Comparable products had already been discontinued in Europe or had their production scaled back, as more modern designs enjoyed the strongest sales. British Leyland&#x27;s Mini had been produced in smaller figures since the launch of the Austin Metro in 1980 with production continuing until 2000. Volkswagen had switched Beetle production from West Germany to Mexico in 1978 (where it was made until 2003), with the new Polo and Golf proving hugely popular in Europe. Citroën kept its 2CV in production until 1990, but did not directly replace it, with the AX (launched in 1986) taking its place as the entry-level model in the Citroën range. It had also produced the earlier Dyane and Visa as more modern and only marginally more expensive alternatives to 2CV. 

There were several projects to replace the Renault 4, starting from the early 1970s. However, the continuing success of the Renault 4, the need to replace the more popular Renault 5 during the early 1980s, the difficulties coming up with a suitable replacement (and the idea that the Renault 4&#x27;s market would die with it) all meant that a new entry-level Renault (the Twingo) did not appear until 1992. To conclude production, a series of 1000 examples marketed as &quot;Bye-Bye&quot; was released, each with a numbered plaque.

To mark the end of Renault 4 production, a retrospective series of ten black-and-white photographs by Thierry des Ouches was published in Libération in early December 1992, when R4 production finally finished after 31 years. This series later won first prize from Le Club des Directeur Artistiques in the category of daily newspaper. It was also awarded the Lion d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival.

In 2003, a Japanese car modification company called DAMD came up with a design called the Ancel Lapin which could transform a first-generation Suzuki Lapin into a Renault 4 lookalike.

== Name reuse (2020s) ==
In 2021, it was announced that a namesake of the Renault 4 would be introduced during the 2020s as the &quot;4ever&quot;, a compact crossover cousin of the forthcoming all-electric Renault 5 E-Tech. It will be built alongside the 5 EV at Renault ElectriCity, a union of three existing Renault factories in northern France that is planned to produce 400,000 EVs per year by 2025. The 4ever is based on the same CMF-B EV platform as the 5 EV; because the platform shares of its components with the existing CMF-B platform, production costs are expected to be of the current Zoe.

==In motorsport==

The Renault 4 was originally powered by a engine and its suspension were never intended for sporting dynamics. The Renault 4 had certain advantages in its high torque and a suspension and ground-clearance that gave it go-anywhere capabilities. This meant that Renault was able to give it a sporting image with programs such as the &quot;Cross Elf Cup of France&quot; in 1974 and the &quot;Routes du Monde&quot; program in 1968. The latter was a project in which Renault would lend young people cars to travel the world in, and this would help to give the Renault 4 an adventurous and durable image. The &quot;Coupe de France Renault Cross Elf&quot; was a series of races in France on dirt tracks with slightly tuned 782 cc R4s.

A Renault 4 Sinpar (the four-wheel drive version) was entered in the Paris-Dakar Rally in 1979 and 1980 by Bernard and Claude Marreau, coming fifth in 1979 and in third in 1980. Renault 4 continued to feature in many long distance rallies after production ceased, such as in 2001 in the London–Sahara–London rally (Renault 4 GTL) and the 2008 Mongol Rally. The Renault 4 forms the basis of the 4L Trophy, an annual rally established in 1997 for students who collect sponsorship and drive to the Sahara to deliver educational materials to children of the desert and of Morocco.

The Renault 4 GTL was homologated in Group A. Jacky Cesbron raced one in the Monte Carlo Rally in 1993 and the Tour de Corse in 1991. Pinto dos Santos raced a Group N 4 GTL in visiting every round of the WRC though not all during the same season. To celebrate the car&#x27;s 50th birthday, Renault entered the R4 in the Monte Carlo Rally in 2011.

Standard Renault 4s has taken part in a drag race at Santa Pod Raceway, Northamptonshire since 2004, and covered the quarter mile in 21.438 seconds with a terminal speed of 59.14 mph.

<text>Gaping Gill (also known as Gaping Ghyll) is a natural cave in North Yorkshire, England. It is one of the unmistakable landmarks on the southern slopes of Ingleborough – a deep pothole with the stream Fell Beck flowing into it. After falling through one of the largest known underground chambers in Britain, the water disappears into the bouldery floor and eventually resurges adjacent to Ingleborough Cave.

The shaft was the deepest known in Britain, until Titan in Derbyshire was discovered in 1999. Gaping Gill still retains the records for the highest unbroken waterfall in England and the largest underground chamber naturally open to the surface.

==Features==

Due to the number of entrances which connect into the cave, many different routes through and around the system are possible. Other entrances include Jib Tunnel, Disappointment Pot, Stream Passage Pot, Bar Pot, Hensler&#x27;s Pot, Corky&#x27;s Pot, Rat Hole, and Flood Entrance Pot.

The Bradford Pothole Club around Whitsun May Bank Holiday, and the Craven Pothole Club around August Bank Holiday, each set up a winch above the shaft to provide a ride to the bottom and back out again for any member of the public who pays a fee.

A detailed 3D model of the chamber has been created using an industrial laser rangefinder which showed that its volume is comparable to the size of York Minster.

==History of exploration==

=== Descents ===
The first recorded attempted descent was by John Birkbeck in 1842 who reached a ledge approximately down the shaft which bears his name. The first complete descent was achieved by Édouard-Alfred Martel in 1895.

=== Hensler&#x27;s Crawl and Master Cave ===
On 16 May 1937 Eric Hensler (1907–1991) explored a low passage leading off Booth-Parsons crawl, finding it to be unexplored. This was later named Hensler&#x27;s Crawl and was also found to lead into Hensler&#x27;s Master Cave.

=== Since 1937 ===
In 1983 members of the Cave Diving Group made the underwater connection into Ingleborough Cave.

An extreme rock-climb (graded E3, 5c) is possible up the main shaft which requires very dry conditions. It was first pioneered in 1972 with ten points of aid. The first free ascent was made in 1988.

<doc id="679929" wikidata="Q1131660" url="?curid=679929" title="Stone (unit)">
<text>The stone or stone weight (abbreviation: st.) is an English and British imperial unit of mass equal to 14 avoirdupois pounds (6.35 kg). The stone continues in customary use in the United Kingdom and Ireland for body weight.

England and other Germanic-speaking countries of Northern Europe formerly used various standardised &quot;stones&quot; for trade, with their values ranging from about 5 to 40 local pounds (2.3 to 18.1 kg) depending on the location and objects weighed. With the advent of metrication, Europe&#x27;s various &quot;stones&quot; were superseded by or adapted to the kilogram from the mid-19th century onward.

==Antiquity==
The name &quot;stone&quot; derives from the historical use of stones for weights, a practice that dates back into antiquity. The Biblical law against the carrying of &quot;diverse weights, a large and a small&quot; is more literally translated as &quot;you shall not carry a stone and a stone (), a large and a small&quot;. There was no standardised &quot;stone&quot; in the ancient Jewish world, but in Roman times stone weights were crafted to multiples of the Roman pound. Such weights varied in quality: the Yale Medical Library holds 10- and 50-pound examples of polished serpentine, while a 40-pound example at the Eschborn Museum is made of sandstone.

==Great Britain and Ireland==
The 1772 edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; defined the stone:STONE also denotes a certain quantity or weight of some commodities. A stone of beef, in London, is the quantity of eight pounds; in Hertfordshire, twelve pounds; in Scotland sixteen pounds.

The Weights and Measures Act 1824 (5 Geo. 4. c. 74), which applied to all of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, consolidated the weights and measures legislation of several centuries into a single document. It revoked the provision that bales of wool should be made up of 20 stones, each of 14 pounds, but made no provision for the continued use of the stone. Ten years later, a stone still varied from 5 pounds (glass) to 8 pounds (meat and fish) to 14 pounds (wool and &quot;horseman&#x27;s weight&quot;). 
The Weights and Measures Act 1835 permitted using a stone of 14 pounds for trade but other values remained in use. James Britten, in 1880 for example, catalogued a number of different values of the stone in various British towns and cities, ranging from 4 lb to 26 lb. The value of the stone and associated units of measure that were legalised for purposes of trade were clarified by the Weights and Measures Act 1835 as follows:
===England===
The English stone under law varied by commodity and in practice varied according to local standards. The Assize of Weights and Measures, a statute of uncertain date from , describes stones of 5 merchants&#x27; pounds used for glass; stones of 8 lb. used for beeswax, sugar, pepper, alum, cumin, almonds, cinnamon, and nutmegs; stones of 12 lb. used for lead; and the of  lb. used for wool. In 1350 Edward III issued a new statute defining the stone weight, to be used for wool and &quot;other Merchandizes&quot;, at 14 pounds, reaffirmed by Henry VII in 1495.
In England, merchants traditionally sold potatoes in half-stone increments of 7 pounds. Live animals were weighed in stones of 14 lb; but, once slaughtered, their carcasses were weighed in stones of 8 lb. Thus, if the animal&#x27;s carcass accounted for of the animal&#x27;s weight, the butcher could return the dressed carcasses to the animal&#x27;s owner stone for stone, keeping the offal, blood and hide as his due for slaughtering and dressing the animal. Smithfield market continued to use the 8 lb stone for meat until shortly before the Second World War. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; also lists:
===Scotland===
The Scottish stone was equal to 16 Scottish pounds (17 lb 8 oz avoirdupois or 7.936 kg). In 1661, the Royal Commission of Scotland recommended that the Troy stone be used as a standard of weight and that it be kept in the custody of the burgh of Lanark. The tron (or local) stone of Edinburgh, also standardised in 1661, was 16 tron pounds (22 lb 1 oz avoirdupois or 9.996 kg). In 1789 an encyclopedic enumeration of measurements was printed for the use of &quot;his Majesty&#x27;s Sheriffs and Stewards Depute, and Justices of Peace, ... and to the Magistrates of the Royal Boroughs of Scotland&quot; and provided a county-by-county and commodity-by-commodity breakdown of values and conversions for the stone and other measures. The Scots stone ceased to be used for trade when the Weights and Measures Act 1824 (5 Geo. 4. c. 74) established a uniform system of measure across the whole of the United Kingdom, which at that time included all of Ireland.

===Ireland===
Before the early 19th century, as in England, the stone varied both with locality and with commodity. For example, the &quot;Belfast stone&quot; for measuring flax equaled 16.75 avoirdupois pounds. The most usual value was 14 pounds. Among the oddities related to the use of the stone was the practice in County Clare of a stone of potatoes being 16 lb in the summer and 18 lb in the winter.

===Modern use===
In 1965, the Federation of British Industry informed the British government that its members favoured adopting the metric system. The Board of Trade, on behalf of the government, agreed to support a ten-year metrication programme. There would be minimal legislation, as the programme was to be voluntary and costs were to be borne where they fell. Under the guidance of the Metrication Board, the agricultural product markets achieved a voluntary switchover by 1976. The stone was not included in the Directive 80/181/EEC as a unit of measure that could be used within the EEC for &quot;economic, public health, public safety or administrative purposes&quot;, though its use as a &quot;supplementary unit&quot; was permitted. The scope of the directive was extended to include all aspects of the EU internal market from 1 January 2010.

With the adoption of metric units by the agricultural sector, the stone was, in practice, no longer used for trade; and, in the Weights and Measures Act 1985, passed in compliance with EU directive 80/181/EEC, the stone was removed from the list of units permitted for trade in the United Kingdom. In 1983, in response to the same directive, similar legislation was passed in Ireland. The act repealed earlier acts that defined the stone as a unit of measure for trade. (British law had previously been silent regarding other uses of the stone.)
The stone remains widely used in the United Kingdom and Ireland for human body weight: in those countries people may commonly be said to weigh, e.g., &quot;11 stone 4&quot; (11 stones and 4 pounds), rather than &quot;72 kilograms&quot; as in most of the other countries, or &quot;158 pounds&quot;, the conventional way of expressing the same weight in the US and in Canada. The invariant plural form of &quot;stone&quot; in this context is &quot;stone&quot; (as in, &quot;11 stone&quot; or &quot;12 stone 6 pounds&quot;); in other contexts, the correct plural is &quot;stones&quot; (as in, &quot;Please enter your weight in stones and pounds&quot;). In Australia and New Zealand, metrication has entirely displaced stones and pounds since the 1970s.

In many sports in both the UK and Ireland, such as professional boxing, wrestling, and horse racing, the stone is used to express body weights.

==Elsewhere==
The use of the stone in the former British Empire was varied. In Canada for example, it never had a legal status.
Shortly after the United States declared independence, Thomas Jefferson, then Secretary of State, presented a report on weights and measures to the U.S. House of Representatives. Even though all the weights and measures in use in the United States at the time were derived from English weights and measures, his report made no mention of the stone being used. He did, however, propose a decimal system of weights in which his &quot;[decimal] pound&quot; would have been and the &quot;[decimal] stone&quot; would have been .
Before the advent of metrication, units called &quot;stone&quot; (; ; ) were used in many northwestern European countries. Its value, usually between 3 and 10 kg, varied from city to city and sometimes from commodity to commodity. The number of local &quot;pounds&quot; in a stone also varied from city to city. During the early 19th century, states such as the Netherlands (including Belgium) and the South Western German states, which had redefined their system of measures using the as a reference for weight (mass), also redefined their stone to align it with the kilogram.

This table shows a selection of stones from various northern European cities:

==Metric stone==
In the Netherlands, where the metric system was adopted in 1817, the &quot;pond&quot; (pound) was set equal to half a kilogram, and the &quot;steen&quot; (stone), which had previously been 8 Amsterdam pond (3.953 kg), was redefined as being 3 kg. In modern colloquial Dutch, a &quot;pond&quot; is used as an alternative for 500 grams or half a kilogram, while the &quot;ons&quot; is used for a weight of 100 grams, being  &quot;pond&quot;.

<text>Sian Kaʼan Biosphere Reserve () is a biosphere reserve in Tulum Municipality in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo. It was established in 1986 and became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987.

The term Sian Kaʼan, from the Yuatec Mayan language, &quot;means &#x27;gate of heaven&#x27; or &#x27;a place where heaven begins.

With the participation of scientists, technicians, students, fishers, farmers, rural promoters, and administrators, together with regional and international partners, have successfully carried out more than 200 conservation projects basing all conservation actions on scientific and technical information for planning and implementing environmental policies and the proposal of viable solutions for sustainable use of natural resources and focusing their efforts established within eight protected natural areas that include the reefs of Banco Chinchorro, and Xcalak at South of Quintana Roo, Sian Kaʼan Biosphere Reserve, Cancun, the island of Cozumel that is located in front of Xcaret and Isla Contoy up north, covering . These areas lie in parts of all seven Caribbean Sea coastal municipalities of the state, with the largest part being in eastern Felipe Carrillo Puerto, where the vast majority of Sian Kaʼan Biosphere Reserve lies.

Part of the reserve is on land and part is in the Caribbean Sea, including a section of coral reef. The reserve has an area of .

The reserve also includes some 23 known archeological sites of the Maya civilization including Muyil. Remains of the Decauville railway Vigía Chico-Santa Cruz, which was operated from 1905 to 1932, can be found at several places.

Within the Amigos de Sian Kaʼan project objectives are the identification, protection, and management of additional areas with high biodiversity value as well as those critical for maintenance of the life cycles of endangered, threatened, and migratory species in the Riviera Maya, providing environmental education through books, journals, and pamphlets, giving technical assistance, and training to Mayan communities working with ecotourism.

<doc id="679933" wikidata="Q6389161" url="?curid=679933" title="Kenfig">
<text>Kenfig () is a village and former borough in Bridgend, Wales. It is situated inland on the north bank of the Bristol Channel, and just south-west of the M4 motorway. To the east is the town of Bridgend, at approximately , and the capital city of Cardiff, at . To the west lies Port Talbot, at approximately 7 miles, and Swansea at approximately 18 miles.

==Geography==
The area of sand dunes and the pool at Kenfig are managed by Bridgend County Borough Council as Kenfig Pool National Nature Reserve, the area designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The reserve has a visitor and interpretation centre, and a car park. The dunes are home to a variety of rare and endangered species of plants and animals, including a high concentration of fen orchid (or &quot;Liparis loeselii&quot;). The current village, built further inland, is a continuation of the mediaeval one. Landmarks include ruins of Kenfig Castle.

The Kenfig Burrows beach is used by naturists.

==History==
The village was established in the 12th century and was situated around Kenfig Castle. The encroaching sand caused by intensive cattle grazing and increasing temperatures due to the Medieval Warm Period made habitation of the area difficult and by the 14th century most of the fields and buildings were unusable. The village was abandoned by 1650. The church was moved from the original village stone by stone and currently stands in the village of Pyle, where the relocation is evident by smaller stones at the bottom of the church, with larger ones above. The earlier settlement was the subject of an episode of the archaeological television programme &quot;Time Team&quot;, screened on 11 March 2012.

The borough contributed with other Glamorgan towns to sending a member of parliament to Westminster until the Reform Act 1832. The municipal ceremonial mace is in the National Museum of Wales, but a pewter copy is held in the Prince of Wales Inn, a pub and Grade II-listed inn, which was built in the 17th century and over the years has served as town hall, courthouse, and a mortuary for sailors whose bodies washed ashore on nearby beaches.

In 1940, work commenced on a calcium carbide plant at Kenfig, built for the Ministry of Supply and operated by British Industrial Solvents, a subsidiary of the Distillers Company. Calcium carbide was a vital raw material for acetylene production. The Kenfig plant closed in 1966, overtaken by cheaper methods of producing acetylene from the catalytic cracking of oil and foreign competitors lower electricity costs.

In 1968, BorgWarner opened a plant at Kenfig for the manufacture of automatic transmissions. In January 1976 the plant completed its two millionth gearbox, which was &#x27;presented&#x27; to A B Volvo. At that time a press release stated that Borg-Warner&#x27;s UK plants at Letchworth and at Kenfig were producing transmissions for use in more than fifty different car models, and that more than half the gearboxes produced were exported outside the UK. In 2001 the factory faced the threat of closure but was saved by a new contract from Korean car company Kia. In December 2008 Borg-Warner announced that the plant would finally close by mid-2010 with the loss of all 110 jobs at the site; a statement from the company blamed the economic downturn for the decision.

In 2009, two Grob Tutor T1 aircraft collided in mid-air and crashed in the nature reserve, killing both pilots and two teenage air cadets.

<doc id="679935" wikidata="Q7821802" url="?curid=679935" title="Tony Ayala Jr.">
<text>Antonio Ayala Jr. (February 13, 1963 – May 12, 2015) was an American professional boxer who competed in the light middleweight division. He began his professional career in 1980, and by 1982 he had compiled a record of 22 wins and no losses, with 19 knockouts. Ayala was born to a boxing family, and had three brothers who were boxers, Mike Ayala, Paulie Ayala and Sammy Ayala. Tony Ayala is considered one of the most promising boxing wasted talents by boxing writers and historians, as his career cut short after he was imprisoned in 1983, at the age of 19. His first shot at the world title never happened due to his personal troubles and later conviction, while his second shot proved unsuccessful, as he was 40 years old and out-of-shape by that time.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Ayala was born in San Antonio, Texas. Tony is the brother of former boxers Mike Ayala and Sammy Ayala and the son of trainer Tony Ayala, Sr.

===Amateur career===
Many have said Ayala was a boxing prodigy, he first fought at the age of five, at the age of six he avenged his first defeat. At the age of eight, he was rumored to suffer his last loss. At fourteen, he was battering a world champion around the ring. At 15, he knocked out Sugar Ray Leonard&#x27;s older brother, Roger Leonard. At that point, his achievements was a bit overshadowed by his older brother Mike, who turned pro in 1975, and by the early 1980 was the number one ranked super bantamweight fighter in the world, so Tony was dubbed simply the &quot;other fighting Ayala.&quot;

===Highlights===
 National Golden Gloves (165 lbs), Indianapolis, Indiana, March 1979:
*1/2: Defeated Vaughn Hooks PTS
*Finals: Defeated Lamont Kirkland PTS
 National Sports Festival (165 lbs), Colorado Springs, Colorado, July 1979:
*Finals: Defeated Alex Ramon PTS

Ayala won National Junior Olympic titles in 1977 and 1978 as well as a National Golden Gloves championship in 1979, compiling an amateur record of 140–8 with sixty knockouts. He was one of Olympic hopefuls for the 1980 Summer Olympics, but turned pro instead of qualifying at the National Olympic Trials in Atlanta, Georgia (as Ayala withdrew, Charles Carter qualified for the U.S. Olympic Team in the middleweight class, but the U.S. participation was canceled soon thereafter due to the boycott).

===Professional career===
Ayala turned professional in June 1980 with a one-round knockout of Zip Castillo and proceeded to score three other first round knock outs in a row. He was co-managed by the Duva family, namely by Lou Duva, Dan Duva, and Kathy Duva. By December 1981 Ayala, the 18-year-old, was rated No. 3 by the World Boxing Association.

The young boxer was known as a savage brawler who was often considered a &quot;dirty&quot; fighter; for example, on one occasion, he spit on his opponent after knocking him to the ground. He also admitted to using heroin before a fight on three occasions (his brother Mike Ayala also made allegations of using drugs before his world title fight against Danny Lopez). In the summer of 1981, teenager Ayala was featured in a cover story of Sports Illustrated as a rising star in boxing. Veteran boxing writer Michael Katz claimed he was the best young fighter he had ever seen; Muhammad Ali&#x27;s trainer Angelo Dundee said he thought Ayala could have been one of boxing&#x27;s greatest fighters. On September 16, 1981, Ayala fought on the undercard of the legendary fight between Sugar Ray Leonard and Thomas Hearns.

===Personal troubles===
By summer 1982 Ayala split with and got back with his 18-year-old wife Lisa, they were living in New Jersey, not far from the Duvas. Twice a week, on Mondays and Fridays, he attended meetings of the local Alcoholics Anonymous. On Wednesdays, he drove to New York to attend meetings at the Freedom Institute. On November 19, 1982, Ayala was scheduled to meet Roberto Durán, the former lightweight and welterweight champion, in a 12-round junior middleweight bout co-promoted by Dan Duva and Don King, scheduled to be shown in prime time by NBC. During August–September 1982 he took a monthly course in a clinic, Care Unit Hospital in Orange, California, as part of a plea deal for one of his earlier attacks. Though he was allowed to leave for training purposes. The rehabilitation program kept him from having a $750,000 payday against Roberto Duran. When the Duran fight didn&#x27;t happen, Ayala settled for about $150,000 to fight Argentinian Carlos Herrera. &#x27;It doesn&#x27;t bother me,&#x27; he said. &#x27;I&#x27;m looking at it as a step closer to the world title. Davey Moore is going to have to meet me after this fight.&#x27;

===Rape conviction===
After defeating Carlos Herrera, November 20, 1982, he was scheduled to fight champion Davey Moore. Ayala was to have one last &quot;tune up&quot; bout on January 26, 1983 when he was scheduled to fight journeyman Leslie &quot;Sweet Lemonade&quot; Gardner at the Ice World Arena in Totowa, New Jersey. By December 1982, Ayala was already a second-ranked junior middleweight in the world.

The fight was not to be. On January 1, 1983, Ayala burglarized the home of his neighbor, a young schoolteacher, and brutally sexually assaulted her. Although he was only 19 years old, Ayala had already been convicted twice of assaults against women. One of these attacks took place in the restroom of a drive-in theatre and left the victim with a broken back. He had been given probation for these offenses. Under a repeat offender&#x27;s law, he was sentenced to 35 years in prison. The prosecutor at trial argued the young boxer should serve the full term because he was a danger to the community.

Ayala Jr served his sentence term at Rahway State Prison and Trenton State Prison and released in 1999.

===Release in 1999===
Ayala was paroled from prison in 1999 and resumed his boxing career, winning six high-profile fights, all by knockout. Ayala was still popular in his hometown. An eliminator against hard hitting ex-champ Yori Boy Campas brought an end to his unlikely comeback, a hand injury caused Ayala to quit on his stool after 8 rounds. His troubles with the law continued. In 2000, he was shot in the shoulder by a young woman after breaking into her home. At Ayala&#x27;s trial the prosecution pointed out this was almost an exact replay of Ayala&#x27;s 1983 offense. He received probation and a brief jail term for this offense. In 2003, Ayala was charged with having sex with a thirteen-year-old girl, but the charges were dismissed when the girl said she lied about it.

===Reincarceration in 2004===
In 2004, Ayala was sentenced to ten years in prison for violation of probation after he was pulled over in his vehicle for speeding, and was also charged with driving without a license, heroin possession and possession of pornography in his vehicle. Tony Jr. was housed at the private Sanders Estes Unit for lower-level offenders in Venus, Southeast of Fort Worth, where he worked as a janitor. He was also housed at the Robertson unit in Abilene Texas a maximum security prison.

===Release in 2014 and father&#x27;s funeral===
Ayala was released on April 25, 2014. He did not grant any interviews or make any appearances or public statements during his second incarceration.

His father, Tony Ayala Sr., who still owned and operated the Zarzamora Street Gym in San Antonio, died on April 10, 2014. Tony was granted special permission to attend his father&#x27;s funeral on April 16, 2014, greeting family, friends, and fans, his first public appearance in over a decade. He then returned to custody to serve the remaining nine days of his sentence.

===El Torito at Zarzamora Street Gym===
Tony Ayala Jr. assisted his brothers, Mike Ayala and Sammy Ayala, in the running of the Zarzamora Street Gym in San Antonio, following his father&#x27;s death.

===Death===
Ayala died on May 12, 2015, age 52, from an apparent overdose at Zarzamora Street Gym, San Antonio, Texas. It has been reported in the media that drug paraphernalia was found near his body.

<doc id="679936" wikidata="Q1933110" url="?curid=679936" title="Rillettes">
<text>Rillettes (, , ) is a preservation method similar to confit where meat is seasoned then submerged in fat and cooked slowly over the course of several hours (4 to 10 hours). The meat is shredded and packed into sterile containers covered in fat. Rillettes is traditionally made with goose or duck, and are commercially most commonly made with pork, but also made with other meats such as chicken, game birds, rabbit and sometimes with fish such as anchovies, tuna, pike or salmon. Rillettes are typically served at room temperature spread thickly on toasted bread.

Sarthe (Le Mans), Tours, and Anjou, all in central France, are notable sources of rillettes.

The term &quot;rillette&quot; can refer to the final product and its appearance when spread on sliced bread. Rillettes were traditionally made with fatty pork belly or pork shoulder. The meat was cubed, salted and cured, cooked slowly over low heat until very tender, then raked into small shreds and blended with the warm cooking fat to form a rustic paste. Rillettes could be stored in crocks for several months. In Anjou, rillaud was a speciality, plated in the shape of a pyramid and topped with the pig&#x27;s tail; the rillettes were proudly displayed to the guest of honor. In time the rillette cooking style was applied to game birds, wild rabbit, and fish. Eventually several preparations for seafood rillettes were developed including an anchovy, tuna, and salmon version. Though the fish is not actually cooked in the fat, it is blended with fat to form the characteristic paste-spread. The soft, smooth texture is a deciding factor in determining a good rillette dish.

Like cassoulet or fondue, this French dish has its many regional definitions. In general most rillettes are served at room temperature, as a spread with toast points, much like a pâté. Pork rillettes from the northwestern regions of Tours and Anjou are famous for the rich texture and bronze color achieved during the cooking process. Rabelais called rillettes &quot;brown pig jam&quot; (&quot;brune confiture de cochon&quot;). Rillettes from the adjacent &quot;département&quot; of Sarthe are distinguished by a more rustic texture, complete with larger pieces of pork and less color.

In Quebec, cretons are similar to rillettes.

==Etymology==
The French word &quot;rillettes&quot; is first evidenced in 1845. It derives from the Old French &quot;rille&quot;, meaning a slice of pork, which is first attested in 1480. This is a dialect variation of the Old French &quot;reille&quot;, meaning a lath or strip of wood, from the Latin &quot;regula&quot;.

<text>The Space Shuttle external tank (ET) was the component of the Space Shuttle launch vehicle that contained the liquid hydrogen fuel and liquid oxygen oxidizer. During lift-off and ascent it supplied the fuel and oxidizer under pressure to the three RS-25 main engines in the orbiter. The ET was jettisoned just over 10 seconds after main engine cut-off (MECO) and it re-entered the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Unlike the Solid Rocket Boosters, external tanks were not re-used. They broke up before impact in the Indian Ocean (or Pacific Ocean in the case of direct-insertion launch trajectories), away from shipping lanes and were not recovered.

== Overview ==

The ET was the largest element of the Space Shuttle, and when loaded, it was also the heaviest. It consisted of three major components:
* the forward liquid oxygen (LOX) tank
* an unpressurized intertank that contains most of the electrical components
* the aft liquid hydrogen (LH2) tank; this was the largest part, but it was relatively light, due to liquid hydrogen&#x27;s very low density.

The ET was the &quot;backbone&quot; of the shuttle during launch, providing structural support for attachment with the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) and orbiter. The tank was connected to each SRB at one forward attachment point (using a crossbeam through the intertank) and one aft bracket, and it was connected to the orbiter at one forward attachment bipod and two aft bipods. In the aft attachment area, there were also umbilicals that carried fluids, gases, electrical signals and electrical power between the tank and the orbiter. Electrical signals and controls between the orbiter and the two solid rocket boosters were also routed through those umbilicals.

Although the external tanks were always discarded, it may have been possible to re-use them in orbit. Plans for re-use ranged from incorporation into a space station as extra living or research space, as rocket fuel tanks for interplanetary missions (e.g. Mars), to raw materials for orbiting factories.

Another concept was to use the ET as a cargo carrier for bulky payloads. One proposal was for the primary mirror of a 7-meter aperture telescope to be carried with the tank. Another concept was the Aft Cargo Carrier (ACC).

==Versions==
Over the years, NASA worked to reduce the weight of the ET to increase overall efficiency. The weight reduced from the ET resulted in an almost equal increase of the cargo-carrying capability of the Space Shuttle.

===Orange color===
The external tank&#x27;s orange color, which would become iconic of the Space Shuttle program, is the color of the spray-on foam insulation. The first two tanks, used for STS-1 and STS-2, were painted white to protect the tanks from ultraviolet light during the extended time that the shuttle spent on the launch pad prior to launch. NASA engineer Farouk Huneidi told the agency that the paint did not actually protect the foam. Martin Marietta (now part of Lockheed Martin) reduced weight by leaving the rust-colored spray-on insulation unpainted beginning with STS-3, saving approximately .

===Standard Weight Tank===
The original ET is informally known as the Standard Weight Tank (SWT) and was fabricated from 2219 aluminum alloy, a high-strength aluminum-copper alloy used for many aerospace applications.

After STS-4, several hundred pounds were eliminated by removing the anti-geyser line. This line paralleled the oxygen feed line, providing a circulation path for liquid oxygen. This reduces accumulation of gaseous oxygen in the feed line during prelaunch tanking (loading of the LOX). After propellant loading data from ground tests and the first few Space Shuttle missions were assessed, the anti-geyser line was removed for subsequent missions. The total length and diameter of the ET remain unchanged. The last SWT, flown on STS-7, weighed approximately inert.

===Lightweight Tank===

Beginning with the STS-6 mission, a lightweight ET (LWT), was introduced. This tank was used for the majority of the Shuttle flights, and was last used during the launch of the ill-fated STS-107 mission. Although tanks vary slightly in weight, each weighed approximately inert.

The weight reduction from the SWT was accomplished by eliminating portions of stringers (structural stiffeners running the length of the hydrogen tank), using fewer stiffener rings and by modifying major frames in the hydrogen tank. Also, significant portions of the tank were milled differently so as to reduce thickness, and the weight of the ET&#x27;s aft solid rocket booster attachments was reduced by using a stronger, yet lighter and less expensive titanium alloy.

===Super Lightweight Tank===
The Super Lightweight Tank (SLWT) was first flown in 1998 on STS-91 and was used for all subsequent missions with two exceptions (STS-99 and STS-107). The SLWT had basically the same design as the LWT except that it used an aluminium-lithium alloy (Al 2195) for a large part of the tank structure. This alloy provided a significant reduction in tank weight (about ) over the LWT. Manufacture also included friction stir welding technology. Although all ETs produced after the introduction of the SLWT were of this configuration, one LWT remained in inventory to be used if requested until the end of the shuttle era. The SLWT provided 50% of the performance increase required for the shuttle to reach the International Space Station. The reduction in weight allowed the Orbiter to carry more payload to the highly inclined orbit of the ISS.

==Contractor==
The contractor for the external tank was Lockheed Martin (previously Martin Marietta), New Orleans, Louisiana. The tank was manufactured at the Michoud Assembly Facility, New Orleans, and was transported to Kennedy Space Center by barge.

==Components==
The ET has three primary structures: an LOX tank, an intertank, and an LH2 tank. Both tanks are constructed of aluminium alloy skins with support or stability frames as required. The intertank aluminium structure utilizes skin stringers with stabilizing frames. The primary aluminium materials used for all three structures are 2195 and 2090 alloys. AL 2195 is an Al-Li alloy designed by Lockheed Martin and Reynolds for storage of cryogenics (and used for the SLW version of the ET - earlier versions used Al 2219). Al 2090 is a commercially available Al-Li alloy.
===Liquid oxygen tank===
The LOX tank is located at the top of the ET and has an ogive shape to reduce aerodynamic drag and aerothermodynamic heating. The ogive nose section is capped by a flat removable cover plate and a nose cone. The nose cone consists of a removable conical assembly that serves as an aerodynamic fairing for the propulsion and electrical system components. The foremost element of the nose cone functions as a cast aluminium lightning rod. The LOX tank volume is at and (cryogenic).

The tank feeds into a diameter feed line that conveys the liquid oxygen through the intertank, then outside the ET to the aft right-hand ET/orbiter disconnect umbilical. The diameter feed line permits liquid oxygen to flow at approximately with the RS-25s operating at 104% or permits a maximum flow of .

All loads except aerodynamic loads are transferred from the LOX tank at a bolted, flange-joint interface with the intertank.

The LOX tank also includes an internal slosh baffle and a vortex baffle to dampen fluid slosh. The vortex baffle is mounted over the LOX feed outlet to reduce fluid swirl resulting from slosh and to prevent entrapment of gases in the delivered LOX.

===Intertank===
The intertank is the ET structural connection between the LOX and LH2 tanks. Its primary functions are to receive and distribute all thrust loads from the SRBs and transfer loads between the tanks.

The two SRB forward attach fittings are located 180° apart on the intertank structure. A beam is extended across the intertank structure and is mechanically fastened to the attach fittings. When the SRBs are firing, the beam will flex due to high stress loads. These loads will be transferred to the fittings.

Adjoining the SRB attach fittings is a major ring frame. The loads are transferred from the fittings to the major ring frame which then distributes the tangential loads to the intertank skin. Two panels of the intertank skin, called the thrust panels, distribute the concentrated axial SRB thrust loads to the LOX and LH2 tanks and to adjacent intertank skin panels. These adjacent panels are made up of six stringer-stiffened panels.

The intertank also functions as a protective compartment for housing the operational instrumentation.

===Liquid hydrogen tank===

The LH2 tank is the bottom portion of the ET. The tank is constructed of four cylindrical barrel sections, a forward dome, and an aft dome. The barrel sections are joined together by five major ring frames. These ring frames receive and distribute loads. The forward dome-to-barrel frame distributes the loads applied through the intertank structure and is also the flange for attaching the LH2 tank to the intertank. The aft major ring receives orbiter-induced loads from the aft orbiter support struts and SRB-induced loads from the aft SRB support struts. The remaining three ring frames distribute orbiter thrust loads and LOX feedline support loads. Loads from the frames are then distributed through the barrel skin panels. The LH2 tank has a volume of at and (cryogenic).

The forward and aft domes have the same modified ellipsoidal shape. For the forward dome, mounting provisions are incorporated for the LH2 vent valve, the LH2 pressurization line fitting, and the electrical feed-through fitting. The aft dome has a manhole fitting for access to the LH2 feedline screen and a support fitting for the LH2 feedline.

The LH2 tank also has a vortex baffle to reduce swirl resulting from slosh and to prevent entrapment of gases in the delivered LH2. The baffle is located at the siphon outlet just above the aft dome of the LH2 tank. This outlet transmits the liquid hydrogen from the tank through a line to the left aft umbilical. The liquid hydrogen feed line flow rate is with the main engines at 104% or a maximum flow of .

===Thermal protection system===

The ET thermal protection system consists primarily of spray-on foam insulation (SOFI), plus preformed foam pieces and premolded ablator materials. The system also includes the use of phenolic thermal insulators to preclude air liquefaction. Thermal isolators are required for liquid hydrogen tank attachments to preclude the liquefaction of air on exposed metal, and to reduce heat flow into the liquid hydrogen. While the warmer liquid oxygen results in fewer thermal requirements, the aluminum of the liquid oxygen tank forward areas require protection from aeroheating. Meanwhile, insulation on the aft surfaces prevents liquified air from pooling in the intertank. The middle cylinder of the oxygen tank, and the propellant lines, could withstand the expected depths of frost accumulation condensed from humidity, but the orbiter could not take the damage from ice breaking free. The thermal protection system weighs .

Development of the ETs thermal protection system was problematic. Anomalies in foam application were so frequent that they were treated as variances, not safety incidents. NASA had difficulty preventing fragments of foam from detaching during flight for the entire history of the program:

*STS-1 &quot;Columbia&quot;, 1981: Crew reports white material streaming past windows during orbiter-external-tank flight. Crew estimated sizes from to fist-sized. Post-landing report describes probable foam loss of unknown location, and 300 tiles needing outright replacement due to various causes.
*STS-4 &quot;Columbia&quot;, 1982: PAL ramp loss; 40 tiles require outright replacement.
*STS-5 &quot;Columbia&quot;, 1982: Continued high rate of tile loss.
*STS-7 &quot;Challenger&quot;, 1983: Bipod ramp loss photographed, dozens of spot losses.
*STS-27 &quot;Atlantis&quot;, 1988: One large loss of uncertain origin, causing one total tile loss. Hundreds of small losses.
*STS-32 &quot;Columbia&quot;, 1990: Bipod ramp loss photographed; five spot losses up to 70 cm in diameter, plus tile damages.
*STS-50 &quot;Columbia&quot;, 1992: Bipod ramp loss. 20×10×1 cm tile damage.
*STS-52 &quot;Columbia&quot;, 1992: Portion of bipod ramp, jackpad lost. 290 total tile marks, 16 greater than an inch.
*STS-62 &quot;Columbia&quot;, 1994: Portion of bipod ramp lost.

In 1995, chlorofluorocarbon-11 (CFC-11) began to be withdrawn from large-area, machine-sprayed foams in compliance with an Environmental Protection Agency ban on CFCs under section 610 of the Clean Air Act. In its place, a hydrochlorofluorocarbon known as HCFC-141b was certified for use and phased into the shuttle program. Remaining foams, particularly detail pieces sprayed by hand, continued to use CFC-11 through the end of the program. These areas include the problematic bipod and PAL ramps, as well as some fittings and interfaces. For the bipod ramp in particular, &quot;the process of applying foam to that part of the tank had not changed since 1993.&quot; The &quot;new&quot; foam containing HCFC 141b was first used on the aft dome portion of ET-82 during the flight of STS-79 in 1996. Use of HCFC 141b was expanded to the ETs area, or larger portions of the tank, starting with ET-88, which flew on STS-86 in 1997.

During the lift-off of STS-107 on January 16, 2003, a piece of foam insulation detached from one of the tank&#x27;s bipod ramps and struck the leading edge of &#x27;s wing at a few hundred miles per hour. The impact is believed to have damaged one comparatively large reinforced carbon-carbon panel on the leading edge of the left wing, believed to be about the size of a basketball which then allowed super-heated gas to enter the wing superstructure several days later during re-entry. This resulted in the destruction of &quot;Columbia&quot; and the loss of its crew. The report determined that the external fuel tank, ET-93, &quot;had been constructed with BX-250&quot;, a closeout foam whose blowing agent was CFC-11 and not the newer HCFC 141b.

In 2005, the problem of foam shed had not been fully cured; on STS-114, additional cameras mounted on the tank recorded a piece of foam separated from one of its Protuberance Air Load (PAL) ramps, which are designed to prevent unsteady air flow underneath the tank&#x27;s cable trays and pressurization lines during ascent. The PAL ramps consist of manually sprayed layers of foam, and are more likely to become a source of debris. That piece of foam did not impact the orbiter.

Reports published concurrent with the STS-114 mission suggest that excessive handling of the ET during modification and upgrade may have contributed to the foam loss on &quot;Discovery&quot; Return to Flight mission. However, three shuttle missions (STS-121, STS-115, and STS-116) were later conducted, all with &quot;acceptable&quot; levels of foam loss. However, on STS-118 a piece of foam (and/or ice) about in diameter separated from a feedline attachment bracket on the tank, ricocheted off one of the aft struts and struck the underside of the wing, damaging two tiles. The damage was not considered dangerous.

===Hardware===
The external hardware, ET–orbiter attachment fittings, umbilical fittings, and electrical and range safety system weigh .

====Vents and relief valves====
Each propellant tank has a vent and relief valve at its forward end. This dual-function valve can be opened by ground support equipment for the vent function during prelaunch and can open during flight when the ullage (empty space) pressure of the liquid hydrogen tank reaches or the ullage pressure of the liquid oxygen tank reaches .

On early flights, the liquid oxygen tank contained a separate, pyrotechnically operated, propulsive tumble vent valve at its forward end. At separation, the liquid oxygen tumble vent valve was opened, providing impulse to assist in the separation maneuver and more positive control of the entry aerodynamics of the ET. The last flight with the tumble valve active was STS-36.

Each of the two aft external tank umbilical plates mate with a corresponding plate on the orbiter. The plates help maintain alignment among the umbilicals. Physical strength at the umbilical plates is provided by bolting corresponding umbilical plates together. When the orbiter GPCs command external tank separation, the bolts are severed by pyrotechnic devices.

The ET has five propellant umbilical valves that interface with orbiter umbilicals: two for the liquid oxygen tank and three for the liquid hydrogen tank. One of the liquid oxygen tank umbilical valves is for liquid oxygen, the other for gaseous oxygen. The liquid hydrogen tank umbilical has two valves for liquid and one for gas. The intermediate-diameter liquid hydrogen umbilical is a recirculation umbilical used only during the liquid hydrogen chill-down sequence during prelaunch.
As the ET is filled, excess gaseous hydrogen is vented through umbilical connections over a large diameter pipe on an arm extended from the fixed service structure. The connection for this pipe between the ET and service structure is made at the ground umbilical carrier plate (GUCP). Sensors are also installed at the GUCP to measure hydrogen levels. Countdowns of STS-80, STS-119, STS-127 and STS-133 have been halted and resulted in several week delays in the later cases due to hydrogen leaks at this connection. This requires complete draining of the tanks and removal of all hydrogen via helium gas purge, a 20-hour process, before technicians can inspect and repair problems.

A cap mounted to the swing-arm on the fixed service structure covers the oxygen tank vent on top of the ET during the countdown and is retracted about two minutes before lift-off. The cap siphons off oxygen vapor that threatens to form large ice accumulations on the ET, thus protecting the orbiter&#x27;s thermal protection system during launch.

====Sensors====

There are eight propellant-depletion sensors, four each for fuel and oxidizer. The fuel-depletion sensors are located in the bottom of the fuel tank. The oxidizer sensors are mounted in the orbiter liquid oxygen feed line manifold downstream of the feed line disconnect. During RS-25 thrusting, the orbiter general-purpose computers constantly compute the instantaneous mass of the vehicle due to the usage of the propellants. Normally, main engine cutoff is based on a predetermined velocity; however, if any two of the fuel or oxidizer sensors sense a dry condition, the engines will be shut down.

The locations of the liquid oxygen sensors allow the maximum amount of oxidizer to be consumed in the engines, while allowing sufficient time to shut down the engines before the oxidizer pumps cavitate (run dry). In addition, of liquid hydrogen are loaded over and above that required by the 6:1 oxidizer–fuel engine mixture ratio. This assures that cutoff from the depletion sensors is fuel-rich; oxidizer-rich engine shutdowns can cause burning and severe erosion of engine components, potentially leading to loss of the vehicle and crew.

Unexplained, erroneous readings from fuel depletion sensors have delayed several shuttle launch attempts, most notably STS-122. On December 18, 2007, a tanking test determined the cause of the errors to be a fault in a wiring connector, rather than a failure of the sensors themselves.

Four pressure transducers located at the top of the liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen tanks monitor the ullage pressures.

The ET also has two electrical umbilicals that carry electrical power from the orbiter to the tank and the two SRBs and provide information from the SRBs and ET to the orbiter.

The ET has external cameras mounted in the brackets attached to the shuttle along with transmitters that can continue to send video data long after the shuttle and the ET have separated.

===Range safety system===

Earlier tanks incorporated a range safety system to disperse tank propellants if necessary. It included a battery power source, a receiver/decoder, antennas and ordnance. Starting with STS-79 this system was disabled, and was completely removed for STS-88 and all subsequent flights.

==Future use==
In 1990, it was suggested that the external tank would be used as a lunar habitat or as an orbital station. These proposals did not come to fruition.

===As basis for Ares in Constellation===
With the retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2011, NASA, with its canceled Constellation program, which featured the Orion spacecraft, would also have featured the debut of two Shuttle-derived launch vehicles, the human-rated Ares I crew-launch vehicle and the heavy-lift Ares V cargo-launch vehicle.

While both the Ares I and Ares V would have utilized a modified five-segment Solid Rocket Booster for its first stage, the ET would have served as a baseline technology for the first stage of the Ares V and the second stage of the Ares I; as a comparison, the Ares I second stage would have held approximately of LOX, versus the ET holding , more than 5 times that amount.

The Ares V first stage, which would have been fitted with five RS-68 rocket engines (the same engine used on the Delta IV rocket), would be in diameter, as wide as the S-IC and S-II stages on the Saturn V rocket. It would have utilized the same internal ET configuration (separate LH2 and LOX tanks separated with an intertank structure), but would have been configured to directly accept LH2 and LOX fill and drain, along with LOX venting on a retractable arm like that used on the Shuttle for LH2.

The Ares I second stage, on the other hand, would have only used the spray-on insulation foam currently used on the current ET. Originally configured like that of the Ares V and the Shuttle ET, NASA, upon completing its design review in 2006, decided, in order to save weight and costs, to reconfigure the internal structure of the second stage by using a combined LH2/LOX tank with the propellants separated by a common bulkhead, a configuration successfully used on the S-II and S-IVB stages of the Saturn V rocket. Unlike the Ares V, which would have used the same fill/drain/vent configuration used on the Shuttle, the Ares I system would have utilized a traditional fill/drain/vent system used on the Saturn IB and Saturn V rockets, but with quick-retracting arms due to the &quot;leap frog&quot; speed the Ares I would expect upon SRB ignition.

As originally envisioned, both the Ares I and Ares V would have used a modified &quot;throw away&quot; version of the RS-25 engine, but in due course, because of the need to keep R&amp;D costs down and to maintain a schedule set by NASA Administration Michael D. Griffin to launch the Ares and Orion by 2011, NASA decided (after the 2006 review) to switch to the cheaper RS-68 engine for the Ares V and to an uprated J-2 engine for the Ares I. Because of the switch to the less efficient RS-68, the Ares V was widened from to accommodate the extra propellants, while the Ares I was reconfigured to incorporate a fifth solid-rocket segment with the J-2X upper stage, as the new engine has less thrust than the original RS-25. Because of the trade-off, NASA would save an estimated USD $35 million by using simplified, higher thrust RS-68 engines (reconfigured to fire and perform like the SSME), while at the same time, eliminate the costly tests needed for an air-startable RS-25 for the Ares I.

===Proposed for DIRECT===
The DIRECT project, a proposed alternative shuttle-derived vehicle, would have used a modified, standard diameter, external tank with three RS-25 engines, with two standard SRBM, as a Crew Launch Vehicle. The same vehicle, with one extra RS-25, and an EDS upper stage, would have served as the Cargo Launch Vehicle. It was planned to save $16 billion, eliminate NASA job losses, and reduce the post-shuttle, crewed spaceflight gap from five plus years to two or less.

===Core stage of Space Launch System===
The Space Launch System (SLS) is a US super heavy-lift expendable launch vehicle, which first flew on Artemis 1 in November 2022.

The core stage of the rocket is in diameter and mount a Main Propulsion System (MPS) incorporating four RS-25 engines. The core stage is structurally similar to the Space Shuttle external tank, and initial flights will use modified RS-25D engines left over from the Space Shuttle program. Later flights will switch to a cheaper version of the engine not intended for reuse.

===Un-flown hardware===

MPTA-ET is on display with the Space Shuttle &quot;Pathfinder&quot; at the U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama.

ET-94 (an older version LWT) is in Los Angeles and in 2019 was scheduled to be displayed with Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; at the California Science Center when the Samuel Oschin Air and Space Center opened. On January 15, 2024 it was announced in a press release that ET-94, 2 solid rocket boosters, and the Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; had been linked together and expected them to be moved by the end of the month to their new exhibit location.

Three other external tanks were in production when NASA ended the shuttle program. ET-139 was at advanced stage of manufacturing; ET-140 and ET-141 were in early stages of manufacturing.

<doc id="679939" wikidata="Q5437718" url="?curid=679939" title="Fathers' rights movement in the United Kingdom">
<text>The [[fathers&#x27; rights]] movement in the United Kingdom consists of a large number of diverse pressure groups, ranging from charities (regulated by the Charity Commission) and self-help groups to civil disobedience activists in the United Kingdom, who started to obtain wide publicity in 2003. Studies show the majority of the UK population support the need for change and protection of fathers rights to meet the responsibility through 50:50 contact. The movement&#x27;s origin can be traced to 1974 when Families Need Fathers (FNF) was founded. At the local level, many activists spend much time providing support for newly separated fathers, most of whom are highly distraught. Although some have been accused of being sexist by some commentators, these groups also campaign for better treatment for excluded mothers, women in second marriages, other step-parents and grandparents – all of whom suffer discrimination in respect of contact with their (grand) child(ren).

The advent of Fathers 4 Justice in 2003 brought the cause into the mainstream media for the first time, and new legislation was brought in the United Kingdom as a result in 2005. Another leading group, Families Need Fathers, is recognised as source of help by The Department of Constitutional Affairs, and regularly provides evidence to parliamentary sub-committees, resulting on one senior Family Court judge indicating that it was a &quot;key player in the debate about on-going contact and joint residence&quot;.

Activists within the movement seek to restructure family law, arguing that children benefit from being raised by both parents, and that children should thus be allowed to interact with both parents on a regular basis as of right. The family justice system in England and Wales, according to a committee of Members of Parliament on 2 March 2005, gives separated and divorced fathers a raw deal and does not give enough consideration to preserving the relationship between the father and the child.

The Child Support Act in the United Kingdom aims to ensure that absent parents pay towards the support of their children. The payment amount is inversely proportional to the time that the child spends with the so-called absent parent. If a parent puts acceptable reasons to a court for the other parent&#x27;s involvement to be restricted, then the restricted parent has to pay more. Many judgements have been criticised for not allowing fathers to be as involved as they would like to be or at all, and the courts criticised for failing to enforce their orders. Pressure from the fathers&#x27; movement has influenced the United Kingdom Government, which published a draft Children (Contact) and Adoption Bill in February 2005. This aims to widen judges&#x27; powers in dealing with parents who obstruct their ex-partner from seeing their children.

==Fathers rights issues==
There are a number of issues which drive the participants in the fathers&#x27; rights movement:
*Residence with the children is rarely given to the father after divorce or separation.
*Shared residence (and shared parenting) is seldom used as an expedient to resolve family child residency disputes, frequently resulting in fathers being marginalised and unable to perform effectively in their capacity as fathers.
*When contact is denied, the courts frequently do not enforce their own orders.
*Whereas mothers get parental responsibility automatically, fathers only do so if they were married to the mother or signed the birth certificate, or if the mother agrees.
*Fathers are obliged to pay means tested child support irrespective of whether they are allowed to see their children, and with no account taken of the mother&#x27;s household&#x27;s income.
*Contact centre places are hard to obtain because of inadequate funding and at the same time their use is frequently demanded unreasonably – resulting in children being unnecessarily deprived of the love and care of their non-resident parent.
*When a father makes representations in court to see his child when this is being obstructed by the mother, adversarial court proceedings against the mother are inevitably the cause of further conflict. If a court can determine that a child should see its father, this could be done without reference to the mother, who may be deemed irrelevant to the proceedings in cases of implacable hostility.

==Leading groups==

Fathers 4 Justice (F4J) takes a proactive approach to generating awareness of fathers&#x27; issues. It generates considerable publicity through planned actions e.g. throwing purple (its campaign colour) flour at the Prime Minister, and Batman landing on Buckingham Palace. It organises stylish and colourful dress-up demonstrations as part of its campaign of direct action. Their actions have been described as &quot;totally irresponsible&quot; and yet the attendant publicity, coordinated by Matt O&#x27;Connor, may be said to have informed the British public of an issue that others had failed to do hitherto.

==Political lobbying==
Father&#x27;s rights groups in the United Kingdom were largely ineffective at political lobbying up until recently. Effective lobbyists, however, have included Families Need Fathers (FNF), whose ideas were included in the Adoption and Children Act 2002 regarding the automatic granting of parental responsibility to fathers when their name appears on a child&#x27;s birth certificate. Tony Coe has been an articulate proponent of a singular message, and appeared in 2004 on a TV programme with Bob Geldof and Jim Parton, the editor of the FNF newsletter. The 2005 Children and Contact Bill addresses one of the expressed concerns of Fathers For Justice. If remains to be seen in the United Kingdom whether providing evidence to Select committees is a more effective tactic than performing publicity stunts.

Government ministers for a long time denied that there is a problem until 2004. Lord Filkin, the family justice minister announced at the beginning of April 2004 that there will be a green paper outlining proposals intended to improve the methods used to settle child residence disputes. This paper, &quot;Parental Separation: Children’s Needs and Parents&#x27; Responsibilities&quot; is seen by activists to not seriously address the fundamental issues, particularly the courts&#x27; generation of inter-parental conflict by making it necessary to have adversarial proceedings.

In the Queen&#x27;s Speech at the State Opening of Parliament on 27 November 2004, Her Majesty said:
:&quot;My Government believes that the welfare of children is paramount. Draft legislation will be published to safeguard the welfare of children in circumstances of parental separation and inter-country adoption.&quot;

F4J achieved its main objective of bringing to the issues to the public&#x27;s attention, creating fear in men who have not &quot;yet&quot; faced the dilemmas of divorce that their relationship with their children could be devastated if they fell out with their partners. By having generated this fear, campaigners are optimistic that governments must now be seen to be actually doing something that will palliate public concerns and fears. However, there is also a &quot;wait and see&quot; mentality being applied within Government departments, as it is the judiciary, by using recent precedents, who have the greatest power to bring about change. The success of the charity, FNF, for instance, in advising members to act as a litigant in person and to work towards shared residency court orders, has resulted in changing judicial attitudes. It is capitalising on that success and has spawned an industry of providing information and help to fathers (and, increasingly, mothers) facing family break-own.

The Labour Party has this to say on the issue in its 2005 Election Manifesto:

:For those parents who do separate or divorce, both have a responsibility for a meaningful relationship with their children where that is safe. We are introducing reforms to minimise conflict and encourage conciliation by greater and early use of mediation. We stand by the principle that absent parents should make a fair contribution to the cost of the upkeep of their children, and we are committed to tackling the backlog of Child Support Agency claims as efficiently and fairly as possible. We also need to ensure court orders on access are enforced according to the best interests of the child, which ideally gives both parents an important role.

===Legal issues===
The new system in the United Kingdom whereby the amount of child support that, in the vast majority of cases, the father pays, is acknowledged to be less fair than the old because it has ceased to take into account the other household&#x27;s income. This is justified on the grounds that it saves administrative cost for the government agency concerned.

There are issues to do with the non-enforcement of Contact Orders – orders made by family court judges which oblige the so-called resident recalcitrant parent (usually the mother) to let the children spend some time with their dad. Such orders are not required if the mother is cooperative about letting the children see their dad, but generally speaking no action is taken if such an order is made and the mother is uncooperative.

The main issue, however, is to do with the adversarial nature of the system, in which most parents are dissatisfied, according to a United Kingdom government report published in 2004, and the only winners are lawyers.

Also justified on the grounds of administrative convenience is the United Kingdom system whereby child benefit is only payable to one parent, even when both separated parents provide substantial portions of the childcare. In a Court of Appeal judgment in February 2005, in a landmark (HOCKENJOS v. SOS JGT) ruling, Lord Justice Ward declared &quot;To allow a father nothing for the maintenance of the child when he shares care virtually equally is so unfair that no reasonable secretary of state should countenance it.&quot; He said that the practice of making just one parent responsible for a child under the benefits system was &quot;grotesque... It is degrading to fathers who actually – and lovingly – tend to their children. A law so framed is so far removed from reality that it brings the law into disrepute and justifiably fuels the passions of protesting fathers.&quot;

===Recent reform===
The publication of the Green Paper together with the item in the Queen&#x27;s Speech may not deliver much immediately, but if it can be established early on in the process which aspects of any proposed new legislation will become retrospective then there is opportunity for it to start having an immediate social impact.

There was a debate on the topic of Family Justice on 13 December 2004 in the House of Commons. The motion:

:That this House agrees that on the separation of parents, priority should be given to the interests of the children; believes that it is in the best interests of all children for both parents to be fully involved in their upbringing and hence that separated parents should each have a legal presumption of reasonable contact with their children, except where a child&#x27;s safety would be at risk, so that children are able to benefit from being parented by both their parents, as well as from contact with any grandparents and extended family members able and willing to play a role in their upbringing; regrets the Government&#x27;s opposition to such a legal presumption, which will lead to yet more children being denied access to both their parents and their extended families; views with concern the Government&#x27;s failure to implement the Early Intervention Project; and calls on the Government to replace the legal term &#x27;contact&#x27; with &#x27;parenting time&#x27;, to introduce a legal presumption of co-parenting and to introduce early intervention in parental separation, with court-backed mediation and guidelines on parenting-time.

It was defeated by with 168 Ayes and 283 Noes voted by MPs.

====Making Contact Work ====

In 2001 Mr Justice Wall (now Lord Justice) chaired a Children Act Sub-Committee (known as CASC).

They reported in March 2002 in a document called &quot;Making Contact Work&quot;.

It called for &quot;urgent reform&quot;. It was a sort of Hutton Inquiry of family law reform. It is well known that Wall LJ was very vexed that nothing happened for a long time.

The &quot;Facilitation and Enforcement&quot; stakeholder group was however created to discuss the CASC report. Stakeholders included a couple of district judges, a solicitor, a barrister, CAFCASS, Women&#x27;s Aid, various academics, mediators...

The report went to Minister Margaret Hodge in June 2003 and the response was a Green Paper in 2004.

CASC, and the stakeholder Group could be called Prong No. 1 of reform, which was started off by the politicians, after pressure from several directions, including from the campaigning charity FNF.

The impression formed by many involved at the time was that the government had no true appetite for reform, and hoped that the problem would just go away.

====Fathers 4 Justice====
Fathers 4 Justice have had success in bringing the subject to the nation&#x27;s attention at a bottom-up grass-roots level, (rather than at the top-down political level of the CASC group, and the stakeholder group.)

However, the true size of Fathers 4 Justice is a matter of opinion. While the organization claims to have over 25,000 members in five countries, its main base of operations is the United Kingdom and there appear to be fewer than 20 actual members who conduct regular civil disobedience actions – namely Jason Hatch and Jolly Stansby.

The results of their campaigning remains to be seen. While they are a fixture in the United Kingdom, they have yet to pull off a successful action in the United States or in Canada. The Canadian branch of Fathers 4 Justice has existed for 15 months and has yet to make national headlines.

====Early intervention====
This is the work of Oliver Cyriax. He has run two conferences about early interventions in 2001 and 2002. These were attended by high-ranking members of the judiciary, including from overseas, where schemes that promote retaining both parents&#x27; involvement in childcare, but leave the courts as last resort, have been very successful. Notably in Florida and California.

He has a strong alliance, made up of senior members of the Solicitors Family Law Association (SFLA), Family Law Bar Association (FLBA), Hamish Cameron the child psychiatrist, Fathers Direct and the campaigning charity Families Need Fathers. Ex-president of the United Kingdom Family Division of the courts Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss has said she supports this plan.

Observers indicate that there is currently a tug-of-war between Oliver Cyriax&#x27;s early interventions pilot project – which would be run by PESF (Parenting and Education Support Forum) in a low key way, probably at Wells Street (the family court in central London) – and another plan, created by the civil servants.

The worry about the civil servants is that they are not expert in family matters at all, and their pilot plan might fail. The civil servant behind it, Bruce Clark, comes from a child protection background. He is said to be the man who drew up the discredited Munchausen&#x27;s guidelines, and not a natural champion of fathers rights&#x27; that campaigners demand, in particular to ensure that children will have adequate parenting time with their fathers.

Fathers&#x27; rights campaigners urgently want an &quot;Early Interventions Pilot Plan&quot; to test and develop compulsory mediation and parenting plans, etc. backed up by a strict enforcement regime, &quot;Facilitation and Enforcement&quot; as the stakeholder group was called.

It is not clear who will win the tug-of-war, and campaigners argue that both initiatives are worthwhile. Duncan Fisher of Fathers Direct says Oliver Cyriax&#x27;s PESF scheme could start immediately, although it is known that civil servants and politicians are prone to call for numbers of rounds of committee meetings and consultations, sometimes indefinitely.

=====Every Day Matters=====
It is arguable that the recent Consultation Paper issued by CAFCASS and entitled is a recognition of the hurt and resentment caused by the existing Family Law system, and is a call for radical change, particularly by the early adoption of Shared Residence in the vast majority of cases. This is clear from Section 36 on page 21.

===Green Paper 2004===
In July 2004 the United Kingdom Government published a Green Paper in response to the two-year-old &quot;Making Contact Work&quot; document, and the more recent &quot;Child Contact Survey&quot;. Only the year before, the Government had been indicating that no legislative changes in this area were planned, so this is a turnaround whose timing is generally felt to be the result of the efforts of fathers&#x27; rights activists. The Women&#x27;s Aid response to this paper contains the following: &quot;We believe that legislation is still required to create a rebuttable presumption in family proceedings legislation that child contact is not awarded unless and until it can be shown to be safe, and that this should be done through a mandatory risk assessment process.&quot; The response does not make clear whether this provision is intended to apply to both parents involved in a child residence dispute.

===Party politics===
At the same time, the Conservative Party has started indicating that it believes fundamental changes in the law are required. The Labour Party supports the stance taken by CAFCASS&#x27;s trade union NAPO. The Opposition stance is that such a policy is against the existing Children Act.

The Liberal Democrats, the third major United Kingdom political party, has framed the issue in terms of domestic violence, but yet has to communicate its ideas widely.

==Constitutional Affairs Committee==
The government in 2004 set up a select committee to look into Family Law in the United Kingdom. In relation to the way in which the fathers&#x27; rights campaign has been received, the following interchange took place during the taking of oral evidence on &quot;Family Justice: The Operation of The Family Courts&quot; at the House of Commons on Tuesday 9 November 2004.

&quot;Lord Justice Wall:&quot; A few years ago I went to address the annual general meeting of &quot;Families Need Fathers&quot; and I was actually very impressed by the strength of their feelings and their emotions. The message I gave them – and I was not the only one doing it – was that the way to succeed, the way to get into the system, is not to sloganise but actually to get on the committees, get in with government where there is lots going on and people want to consult you, and respond to &quot;Making Contact Work&quot;. We had an excellent response from &quot;Families Need Fathers&quot;, part of which we incorporated, and I think &quot;Families Need Fathers&quot; has become a key player in the debate about on-going contact and joint residence. We make progress with rational argument; we do not make progress by sloganising.

&quot;Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss:&quot; I cannot meet &quot;Fathers4Justice&quot; because they are not being sensible. As long as they throw condoms with purple powder and send a double-decker bus with a loudspeaker outside my private house in the West Country there is no point in talking to them; they are not going to talk, they are going to tell me.

Those present included Rt Hon Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss DBE, Rt Hon Lord Justice Wall and Hon Mr Justice Munby, His Honour Judge Meston QC, District Judge Michael Walker and District Judge Nicholas Crichton.

==Family court statements==

===Futility experienced in family court===
In April 2004, the Honourable Mr. Justice Munby of the Court of Appeal in the UK wrote:
:&quot;From the father’s perspective the last two years of the litigation have been an exercise in absolute futility. …

:He is entitled to [feel let down]. … I can understand why he expresses that view. He has every right to express that view. In a sense it is shaming to have to say it, but I personally agree with his view. It is very, very disheartening. I am sorry there is nothing more I can do.&quot;

====Family court on parental alienation and PAS====

The legal system in the United Kingdom has seen argument about parental alienation and parental alienation syndrome as is illustrated by comments the following cases:

Lady Justice Hale (in &quot;Re K (Contact: Psychiatric Report)&quot; [1995] 2 FLR 432) stated:

:It is my unhappy experience, borne out by other anecdotal evidence and confirmed by the Official Solicitor&#x27;s department that there seems to be an increasing number of cases coming before the family courts where contact between a young child and the absent parent has become bedevilled by stubborn opposition to contact being shown by the child which may, or may not, be evidence of some implacable hostility on the part of the other parent for good reason or for no reason at all.

Since The Children Act requires that the views of the child need to be made known to the court, fathers&#x27; rights campaigners claim that the mother sometimes alienates a child against his or her father and that this then supports the mother&#x27;s case in court to banish the father. Lady Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, President of the Family division, (the top United Kingdom family court judge) stated (in &quot;Re L, V, M, H (Contact: Domestic Violence)&quot; [2002] 2 FLR 334 at 351):

:There is, of course, no doubt that some parents, particularly mothers, are responsible for alienating their children from their fathers without good reason and thereby creating this sometimes insoluble problem. That unhappy state of affairs, well known in family courts, is a long way from recognised syndrome requiring mental health professionals to play an expert role.

==Bob Geldof&#x27;s involvement==
Relatively recently, Bob Geldof, organiser of the Live Aid and the Live 8 projects, has become involved in the British fathers&#x27; rights movement. Geldof claims to be an iconoclast, calling his arguments rants which express his feelings towards British family law, as well as towards issues of a more personal matter.

Geldof, and others, argue that without substantial changes, the application of current British custody law will lead to a generation of feral children. Geldof has written:

The law must know it is contributing to the problem. It is creating vast wells of misery, massive discontent, an unstable society of feral children and reckless adolescents who have no understanding of authority or ultimate sanction, no knowledge of a man’s love and how it is different but equal to a woman’s, irresponsible mothers, drifting, hopeless fathers, problem and violent ill-educated sons and daughters, a disconnect from the extended family and society at large,&quot; &quot;vast swathes of cynicism and repeat pattern behaviour in subsequent adult relationships.

Fathers&#x27; rights campaigners question the assumption that it can ever be legitimate for the state to collude in disrupting a loving and natural relationship between a father and his children. Geldof has written on this subject:

I cannot even say the words. A huge emptiness would well in my stomach, a deep loathing for those who would deign to tell me they would ALLOW me ACCESS to my children – those I loved above all, those I created, those who gave meaning to everything I did, those that were the very best of us two and the absolute physical manifestation of our once blinding love. Who the fuck are they that they should ALLOW anything? REASONABLE CONTACT!!! Is the law mad? Am I a criminal? An ABSENT parent. A RESIDENT/NON-RESIDENT parent. This Lawspeak which you all speak so fluently, so unthinkingly, so hurtfully, must go.

<text>Nevern () is both a parish and a community in Pembrokeshire, Wales. The community includes the settlements of Felindre Farchog, Monington, Moylgrove and Bayvil. The small village lies in the Nevern valley near the Preseli Hills of the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park east of Newport on the B4582 road.

==History==
===Neolithic===
The area around Nevern has been occupied since at least neolithic times (about 4,000 years ago); evidence includes barrows revealed in an aerial survey during the 2018 heatwave.

===Norman rule===
When the ruler of Deheubarth, Rhys ap Tewdwr, died in battle and his lands were forfeited to the Normans, Martin de Turribus became the Marcher Lord of Kemes, with his caput at Nevern, where he took over an existing fortification.

===Norman castle===
The early 12th century Nevern Castle stood on a spur of the hill northwest of the church. Under Martin&#x27;s son, Robert fitz Martin, it was the only Norman castle to successfully resist the forces of Rhys ap Gruffydd&#x27;s sons, who were trying to re-establish Deheubarth. Robert&#x27;s son William later established peace with Rhys ap Gruffydd by marrying his daughter, Angharad. The castle changed hands several times over the following 80 years, and was eventually destroyed by Hywel Sais in 1195. In 1197, Robert and Angharad&#x27;s son, William Fitz Martin founded Newport, and built a castle there, abandoning Nevern. In modern times little remains of the castle, but the site has been extensively excavated. It was probably a square building with a bastion at each corner, and may have been one of the earliest stone castles built in Wales.

===Land ownership===
Although the local area is not mentioned, an allegorical poem in the 13th century Black Book of Carmarthen has been extrapolated by some writers to conclude that the area must have once been under the rule of , a descendant of whom was later granted land in the nearby Preseli Hills by charter.

In 1603, the antiquarian George Owen, Lord of Cemais, described Nevern as one of nine Pembrokeshire &quot;boroughs in decay&quot;.

==Nevern Bridge==

Nevern Bridge spans the River Nevern in the centre of the village. The current bridge was built in the late 18th or early 19th century and is a Grade II listed structure. It has two unequal arches, recessed with keystones.

==Parish==

The parish of Nevern was the largest in Pembrokeshire at , and was divided into four &quot;quarters&quot;: Crugiau, Morfa, Trewern and Cilgwyn. Cilgwyn extends to the south side of the Preseli Hills; a 1578 map in the British Library shows &quot;Kilgwin&quot; as a separate parish, and also &quot;Neverne&quot;, but the other quarters are not shown. Before becoming a quarter of Nevern parish, Cilgwyn was reduced from a parish to a chapelry, dedicated to St Mary. Nevern parish church (see below) is in Crugiau Quarter.

In 1833 the population of the parish, at 1,558 inhabitants, was nearly twice that of 2011. Nevern is slightly more than from Newport, Pembrokeshire.

===Parish Church===
The Norman Church of St Brynach is on the site of St Brynach&#x27;s 6th century &quot;clas&quot;, an important ecclesiastical centre. At the time when it is said that Dyfed had seven bishops, this was probably the seat of one. Except for the castellated tower, perilously undercut by the adjacent river Caman, most of the original Norman structure of the present building has been rebuilt. The church and churchyard are remarkable for the Celtic Cross, several inscribed stones and an avenue of yew trees. The church is a Grade II* listed building, as are more than 60 other listed buildings in the community. The churchyard is designated at Grade II on the Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales.

In the churchyard is a &quot;bleeding yew&quot; that leaks red sap at certain times of the year. George Owen is buried here, and is commemorated by a plaque in the Henllys Chapel behind the organ.

==Historical remains==

The Nevern Cross on the south side of the church dates from the 10th century or early 11th century. It consists of two sections fitted together with a mortice and tenon joint, both cut from the local dolerite stone. It has classic braided decorations and inscriptions reading &quot;dns&quot; on one side and &quot;h.an.eh&quot; on the other. Nearby is the Vitalianus Stone, dating from around 500 AD, inscribed in Latin &quot;VITALIANI EMERTO&quot; and in Ogham &quot;vitaliani&quot;. In the Trewern Chapel in the south transept, two inscribed stones are set into the window sills. The Maglocunus Stone is inscribed in Latin &quot;MAGLOCUNI FILI CLUTORI&quot; and in Ogham &quot;maglicunas maqi clutar..&quot; and is of the 5th century or early 6th century. The Braided Cross is of the early 10th century. There is a Pilgrim&#x27;s Cross cut into the rock on the roadside between the village and the castle. Dyfed Archaeological Trust has carried out excavations at the castle site. The Pentre Ifan dolmen and the Castell Henllys hillfort are in the parish, each about from the village. The dolmen is under the care of Cadw, the Welsh Historic Monuments Agency.

<text>A screen pass is a play in gridiron football consisting of a short pass to a receiver who is protected by a screen of blockers. During a screen pass, a number of things happen concurrently in order to fool the defense into thinking a long pass is being thrown, when in fact the pass is merely a short one, just beyond the defensive linemen. Screens are usually deployed against aggressive defenses that rush the passer. Because screens invite the defense to rush the quarterback, they are designed to leave fewer defensive players behind the rushers to stop the play.

==Use==
A screen pass can be effective, but it can also be risky as it is rather easy for a defensive player, even a lineman, to intercept the pass if a defender gets between the quarterback and the intended receiver—something that only happens if the offensive line misses a block, the quarterback takes too long to throw or the defense overwhelms the offensive line. If the pass is intercepted, there are often few offensive players in front of the intercepting player, thus making it much easier for the intercepting team to earn a large return or to score a touchdown.

The frequent use of the screen pass is a distinguishing feature of the West Coast offense.

==Types==
Screens come in many forms. A screen to a running back to either the strong or short side of the field in the flats is often just called a screen. Screens to wide receivers come in four forms: the bubble screen, middle screen, slot screen, and slip screen.

The bubble screen was essentially created by Don Read when he was head coach of the Montana Grizzlies, and Lou Holtz, head coach of the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, brought the play into prominence after calling Read and asking for the play. The bubble screen involves a receiver taking a step forward, then darting toward the quarterback to receive the ball while the offensive linemen release to clear a path for the receiver. The benefit of the bubble screen is that it works against either zone or man-to-man coverage. A downside is that it is dependent on proper timing; a zone blitz or defensive end dropping into coverage can disrupt the timing, and may result in the quarterback being sacked.

The middle screen is similar to the bubble screen, except that the receiver continues his route to the middle of the field. The linemen release up the middle of the field in front of the receiver.

==Shovel pass==
A screen pass is sometimes executed using a shovel pass throwing motion. To throw a shovel pass the quarterback palms the football, and &quot;shovels&quot; the pass directly forward to the receiver, usually with a backhand, underhand, or pushing motion. When a designed play calls for the quarterback to use a shovel pass forward to a receiver it is, by definition, also a screen pass. Because the pass appears to be a fumble if not completed, some defenses attempt to recover the ball as a turnover.

The Utah Pass is an overhand forward shovel pass of the ball popularized by the Utah Utes football team and Lee Grosscup. The play is commonly used by teams that use a spread offense.

==Offensive action during a screen pass play==
The quarterback drops back as if he is going to pass the ball deep. The offensive line sets up in pass protection for usually one to two seconds, then releases and lets the defensive line go. The player receiving the screen pass moves behind the releasing linemen and waits for the ball. The outside receivers run clear-out routes in order to make a path for the screen coming behind them.

If run properly, the defensive backs will be run out of the play by the receivers, and the defensive line will penetrate too far to stop the short pass from being thrown. The only defenders left will be linebackers, which will be picked up by the &quot;screen&quot; of offensive linemen in front of the receiver—hence the name &quot;screen pass&quot;.

==Types of plays==
There are a number of variation on screen pass plays.

The &quot;conventional&quot; screen to the running back (the action described above). This type of play is something of a scripted checkdown.

A tight end screen where the tight end takes the place of the running back in the above description.

The wide receiver screen (or &quot;jailbreak screen&quot;), where the linemen sprint out in front of the wide receiver catching the screen pass. However, the blocking may be as simple as one receiver blocking ahead of another. A wide receiver screen thrown to a receiver moving towards the quarterback, behind one or more blocking receivers, is also commonly called a &quot;tunnel screen&quot;.

The &quot;quarterback throwback&quot; screen, where the quarterback will pitch to a running back or throw a short pass to a wide receiver, and run the opposite direction, with releasing linemen in front of him. The running back or wideout will then lateral, or &quot;throw it back&quot; to the quarterback, with offensive linemen leading him downfield. This is also known as a &quot;Blitz Beater&quot; or &quot;Blitz&quot; for short because it&#x27;s almost always used against a blitz-heavy defense, also called that because when you can tell a blitz is coming, this is a common play called to counter it, and the overpursuing nature of the blitz leaves the running back, and then the quarterback wide open with the possibility of gaining huge chunks of yardage. The &quot;quarterback throwback&quot; has been known to force defenses to blitz less, because one successful play can turn into a quick touchdown with a mobile quarterback.

The &quot;middle screen&quot;, which has the same type of action as a &quot;conventional&quot; screen, but the linemen remain in the middle of the field rather than releasing to either side.

A trick play variant of the screen pass involves an offensive tackle. The tackle must back up so that their hands are even with or behind the passer&#x27;s and receives a lateral or backward pass. In a further evolution of trickery, the pass can be bounced (since any backward pass is a live ball) to fool the defense into thinking it is an incomplete forward pass; this trick can be achieved with either the offensive tackle or an eligible receiver. In turn, because a backward pass is a live ball even after hitting the ground, it increases the risk of a turnover if the intended receiver fails to catch the ball.

<text>Aberdulais is a village and electoral ward in Neath Port Talbot, Wales, lying on the River Neath, in the community of Blaenhonddan. The village grew around the Aberdulais Falls, the site of successive industries and now a hydro-electric station. The National Trust owns and administers the site.

The name Aberdulais is from the Welsh for the mouth of the River Dulais.

==Industrial history==
Aberdulais has a lengthy industrial history thanks to the abundant supply of energy derived from the waterfall and the presence in the vicinity of coal and timber. The first business here was a copper smelting industry, using ore delivered via boat from Cornwall. Over the years the site was successively used as an ironworks, a cornmill and a tinplate works. The Welsh tinplate industry was very successful for a time, until the American government levied heavy duties on imported tinplate.

The present water wheel is a modern steel structure in diameter. It generates electricity for use on the site, any excess current being fed into the national grid.

==Other history==
In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, various artists visited the falls to paint. In 1795, J. M. W. Turner used a sketch he made here of the waterfall and cornmill to paint his watercolour &quot;Aberdulais Mill, Glamorganshire&quot; which hangs at the National Library of Wales. John Ruskin also painted here.

==Amenities and attractions==
Local attractions include a canal and the Cefn Coed Colliery Museum. Aberdulais Falls and the associated industrial infrastructure are in the care of the National Trust in recognition of the site&#x27;s value as a key part of the region&#x27;s industrial heritage. The water wheel at Aberdulais falls produces £20,000 worth of electricity that powers the site, and the surplus is sold back to the national grid.

Several of the old buildings remain, and the tall smokestack of the tinplate works towers above the site. The school house for the children of the workers survives. The remains of a bridge that formerly linked the site by a tramway to the Tennant Canal can be seen.

==Government and politics==
Aberdulais is also the name of an electoral ward covering the village. It is a constituent of the parish of Blaenhonddan. The electoral ward of Aberdulais includes some or all of the settlements of Aberdulais and Cilfrew in the parliamentary constituency of Neath. Most of the ward consists of woodland and farmland with a small residential area to the far south. Aberdulais is bounded by the wards of Crynant to the north; Resolven to the east; Tonna to the south; and Cadoxton and Bryncoch North to the west.

In the 2017 local council elections the results were:
In the 2012 local council elections, the electorate turnout was 40.81%. The results were:

<text>Robert Magaw (1738 – January 7, 1790) was an American politician and lawyer from Carlisle, Pennsylvania, who served as a colonel in the Continental Army during the U.S. Revolutionary War.

==Early life and education==
Robert was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1738. His parents, William and Elizabeth Magaw, had earlier immigrated from Strabane, County Tyrone, Ireland, to the eastern shore of Maryland. He later settled in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and practiced law there. His brother was the Rev. Samuel Magaw.

==Career==
Magaw served several years in the militia, and when the war broke out he was made a colonel in command of the 5th Pennsylvania Battalion.

During the New York campaign he was in command of the U.S. garrison at Fort Washington. He was forced to surrender it, and became a prisoner on November 16, 1776. Based on his parole he was set at liberty in New York City, but could not leave the city until he was exchanged. This did not happen until October 1780.

==Personal life==
While a prisoner on parole, Magaw met and courted Marritje Van Brunt (1762–1803) of Kings County, New York. They married in April 1779, and would later have two children.

==Later life and death==
After he was exchanged, he returned home to New Carlisle and continued his law practice. He served two years in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives (1781–1782) and was for many years a trustee of Dickinson College. He died at home in Carlisle on January 7, 1790. After his death, Marritje returned to New York to live with their son, Robert Van Brunt Magaw, at Gravesend.

<text>Gamelan surakarta is one of two subtly distinct styles of gamelan playing that have emerged in central Java since 1755. In contrast to yogyakarta, the Surakarta style is known for its intricate, soft style of playing. 

== Description ==
A typical large, double gamelan in contemporary solo (Surakarta) will include, in the sléndro set, one saron panerus (or saron peking), two saron barung, one or two saron demung, one gendér panerus, one gender barung, one slenthem (or &quot;gender panembung&quot;), one bonang panerus and one bonang barung (each with twelve gongs), one gambang kayu, one siter or celempung, one rebab, one suling, one pair of kethuk and kempyang, one set of three to five kenong, one set of three to five kempul, one to three gong suwukan, and one gong ageng. 

The complementary set of pelog instruments will include two each of gender panerus, gender barung, gambang and siter or celempung, the first of each pair tuned to the pelog bem subset of five tones (tones 1,2,3,5,6), the second to the pelog barang subset of five tones (2,3,5,6,7). The pelog bonang will each have fourteen gongs. 

The slendro and pelog gamelan will usually share the drums (kendang), including one each of ketipung, kendang ageng (or kendang gendhing), ciblon, kendang wayangan, and, in the largest gamelan, a large hanging drum, the bedug. Archaic ensembles may still include such instruments as the gambang gangsa, slentho (in place of slenthem), and bonang panembung. A typical performance ensemble includes a female vocal soloist (pesinden) and male chorus (gerongan); in certain passages, the singers clap rhythmically (keplok).

==Comparison to Gamelan Yogyakarta==
In Yogyakarta, there is a tendency to have more sarons of each register and it is more likely that the bonang panembung will be present. An archaic instrument, the celuring, a set of struck bells is found only on a few gamelan in the Yogyakarta Kraton and is played in place of the saron panerus. The Solonese style is often considered more refined (or &quot;alus&quot;) than Yogyanese style. One specific difference is in saron peking playing; although the pattern it plays for the balungan is often the same, in the Yogyanese style it is rhythmically shifted earlier, creating a different emphasis in relation to the balungan.

<text>El (Л л or Ʌ ʌ; italics: &quot;Л&quot; &quot;л&quot; or &quot;Ʌ&quot; &quot;ʌ&quot;) is a letter of the Cyrillic script.

El commonly represents the alveolar lateral approximant . In Slavic languages it may be either palatalized or slightly velarized; see below.

==Allography==
In some typefaces the Cyrillic letter El has a grapheme which may be confused with the Cyrillic letter Pe (П п). Note that Pe has a straight left leg, without the hook. An alternative form of El (Ʌ ʌ) is more common in Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, and Serbian.

==History==
The Cyrillic letter El was derived from the Greek letter lambda (Λ λ).

In the Early Cyrillic alphabet its name was (&quot;ljudije&quot;), meaning &quot;people&quot;.

In the Cyrillic numeral system, Л had a value of 30.

==Forms==
El has two forms: one form resembles Greek capital Lambda (Ʌ ʌ), and the other form resembles the Hebrew letter ת (Л л).

==Pronunciation==
As used in the alphabets of various languages, El represents the following sounds:
* alveolar lateral approximant , like the pronunciation of in &quot;lip&quot;
* palatalized alveolar lateral approximant 
* velarized alveolar lateral approximant , like the pronunciation of in &quot;bell&quot; and &quot;milk&quot;
* Labiovelar approximant , like the in &quot;water&quot;
* voiced alveolar lateral fricative and its palatalized equivalent 

The phoneme in Slavic languages has two realizations: hard (, , or , exact pronunciation varies) and soft (pronounced as )see palatalization for details. Serbian and Macedonian orthographies use a separate letter Љ for the soft it looks as a ligature of El with the soft sign (Ь). In these languages, denotes only hard . Pronunciation of hard  is sometimes given as , but it is always more velar than in French or German.

Slavic languages except Serbian and Macedonian use another orthographic convention to distinguish between hard and soft , so can denote either variant depending on the subsequent letter.

The pronunciations shown in the table are the primary ones for each language.
In addition, л was formerly used in Chukchi to represent the voiceless alveolar lateral fricative but has since been replaced by ԓ.

<doc id="679951" wikidata="Q17525400" url="?curid=679951" title="Pe (Semitic letter)">
<text>Pe is the seventeenth letter of the Semitic abjads, including Arabic &quot;fāʾ&quot; , Aramaic &quot;pē&quot; 𐡐, Hebrew &quot;pē&quot; , Phoenician &quot;pē&quot; 𐤐, and Syriac &quot;pē&quot; ܦ. (in abjadi order).

The original sound value is a voiceless bilabial plosive and it retains this value in most Semitic languages, except for Arabic, where the sound changed into the voiceless labiodental fricative , carrying with it the pronunciation of the letter. However, the sound in Arabic is used in loanwords with the letter &quot;pe&quot; as an alternative. Under the Persian influence, many Arabic dialects in the Persian Gulf, as well as in Egypt and in some of the Maghreb under the Ottoman influence uses the letter &quot;pe&quot; to represent the sound which is missing in Modern Standard Arabic. Not to be confused with the Turned g. The Phoenician letter gave rise to the Greek Pi (Π), Latin P, Glagolitic Ⱂ, and Cyrillic П.

==Origins== 
Pe is usually assumed to come from a pictogram of a &quot;mouth&quot; (in Hebrew &quot;pe&quot;; in Arabic, فا &quot;fah&quot;).
D21

== Arabic fāʾ==
The letter is named &quot;&quot; . It is written in several ways depending on its position in the word:
In the process of developing from Proto-Semitic, Proto-Semitic became Arabic , and this is reflected in the use of the letter representing in other Semitic languages for in Arabic.

Examples on usage in Modern Standard Arabic:
* &#x27; ( ) is a multi-function prefix most commonly equivalent to &quot;so&quot; or &quot;so that.&quot; For example: &#x27; (&quot;we write&quot;) → &quot;&quot; (&quot;so we write&quot;).

=== Maghrebi variant ===
In Maghrebi scripts, the i&#x27;ajami dot in &quot; has traditionally been written underneath (). Once the prevalent style, it is now mostly used in countries of the Maghreb in ceremonial situations or for writing Qur&#x27;an, with the exception of Libya and Algeria, which adopted the Mashriqi form (dot above).

The Maghrebi alphabet, to write &#x27; (), a letter that resembles &#x27; () in the initial and medial forms is used, but it is really a &quot; with a single dot ().

===Central Asian variant===
In the Arabic orthographies of Uyghur, Kazakh and Kyrgyz, the letter &#x27; has a descender in the final and isolated positions, much like the Maghrebi version of &#x27;.

Theoretically this shape could be approximated by using , but in practice is used in databases of these languages, and most commercial fonts for these languages give the codepoint of the usual Arabic &quot;&quot; a shape like .

When the Uyghur keyboard layout for Microsoft Windows was first added in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, the key combination resulted in . The Uyghur keyboard layout in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 changed that key combination to give . On the newer systems, the old keyboard layout is still available under the name Uyghur (Legacy).

== Diacriticized Arabic versions ==
Normally, the letter &#x27; renders sound, but may also be used some names and loanwords where it can render , might be arabized as in accordance to its spelling, e.g., (Unilever). It may be used interchangeably with the modified letter - &#x27; (with 3 dots above) in this case. The letter fāʾ with three dots above is no longer used in Persian, as the -sound changed to , e.g. archaic &gt; &#x27;language&#x27;

The character is mapped in Unicode under position U+06A4.

=== Maghrebi variant ===
The Maghrebi style, used in Northwestern Africa, the dots moved underneath (Unicode U+06A5), because it is based on the other style of ():

=== Other similar letters ===

==Hebrew pe==
The Hebrew spelling is . It is also romanized pei or pey, especially when used in Yiddish.

=== Variations on written form/pronunciation ===

The letter Pe is one of the six letters which can receive a Dagesh Kal. The six are Bet, Gimel, Daleth, Kaph, Pe, and Tav.

====Variant forms of Pe/Fe====

A notable variation on the letter Pe is the Pe Kefulah (Doubled Pe), also known as the Pei Lefufah (Wrapped Pe). The Pe Kefulah is written as a small Pe scribed within a larger Pe. This atypical letter appears in Torah scrolls (most often Yemenite Torahs but is also present in Sephardic and Ashkenazi Torahs), manuscripts, and some modern printed Hebrew Bibles. When the Pe is written in the form of a Doubled Pe, this adds a layer of deeper meaning to the Biblical text. This letter variation can appear on the final and non-final forms of the Pe.

There are two orthographic variants of this letter which indicate a different pronunciation:

====Pe with the dagesh====
When the Pe has a &quot;dot&quot; in its center, known as a dagesh, it represents a voiceless bilabial plosive, . There are various rules in Hebrew grammar that stipulate when and why a dagesh is used.

====Fe====
When Pe appears &quot;without&quot; the dagesh dot in its center (), then it usually represents a voiceless labiodental fricative .

====Final form of Pe/Fe====
At the end of words, the letter&#x27;s written form changes to a &quot;Pe/Fe Sophit&quot; (Final Pe/Fe): .

When a word in modern Hebrew borrowed from another language ends with , the non-final form is used (e.g. &quot;Philip&quot;), while borrowings ending in still use the Pe Sofit (e.g. &quot;fun&quot;, from Arabic). This is because native Hebrew words, which always use the final form at the end, cannot end in .

=== Significance ===
In gematria, Pe represents the number 80. Its final form represents 800 but this is rarely used, Tav written twice (400+400) being used instead.

<text>Natasha Bianca Lyonne Braunstein ( ; born April 4, 1979) is an American actress, writer, director, and producer. She is known for her distinctive raspy voice and tough persona, and the accolades she has received include nominations for five Primetime Emmy Awards and two Golden Globe Awards.

After working as a child actress, Lyonne came to prominence in the late 1990s with her roles in &quot;Everyone Says I Love You&quot; (1996), &quot;Slums of Beverly Hills&quot; (1998), &quot;But I&#x27;m a Cheerleader&quot; (1999), and &quot;American Pie&quot; (1999). Following various independent film appearances throughout the 2000s, she achieved wider recognition with her portrayal of Nicky Nichols on Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot; (2013–2019). Her subsequent television work has included Peacock&#x27;s &quot;Poker Face&quot; (2023–present) and Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Russian Doll&quot; (2019–2022). In addition to starring in &quot;Russian Doll&quot;, Lyonne co-created, wrote for, directed, and served as an executive producer of the series. She was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by &quot;Time Magazine&quot; in 2023.

==Early life==
Lyonne was born in New York City, the daughter of Orthodox Jewish parents Ivette Buchinger and Aaron Braunstein, a boxing promoter, race car driver, and radio host. Her mother was born in Paris, to Hungarian-Jewish parents.

Lyonne has joked that her family consists of &quot;my father&#x27;s side, Flatbush, and my mother&#x27;s side, Auschwitz&quot;. Her grandmother, Ella, came from a large family, but only she and her two sisters and two brothers survived, which Lyonne has attributed to their blond hair and blue eyes. Lyonne&#x27;s grandfather, Morris Buchinger, operated a watch company in Los Angeles. During the war, he hid in Budapest as a non-Jew working in a leather factory. Lyonne lived the first eight years of her life in Great Neck, New York. She and her family emigrated to Israel, where she spent a year and a half. While in Israel, Lyonne participated in the 1989 Israeli children&#x27;s film &quot;April Fool&quot; (), which began her interest in acting. Her parents divorced, and Lyonne and her older brother, Adam, returned to the United States with their mother. After moving back to New York City, Lyonne attended the Ramaz School, a private Jewish school, where Lyonne was a scholarship student who took Talmud classes and read Aramaic. She was expelled in her sophomore year for selling marijuana to classmates. Lyonne grew up on the Upper East Side, where she felt she was an outsider. Her mother moved the family to Miami and Lyonne briefly attended Miami Country Day School. She did not graduate from high school, leaving before her senior year to attend a film program at New York University&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts, which she attended for a short time, studying film and philosophy. Her high school graduation depended on completing her first year at Tisch, but she left the program because she could not pay the tuition.

Lyonne was estranged from her father, who was a Democratic candidate for New York City Council for the sixth District of Manhattan in 2013, and lived on the Upper West Side until his death in October 2014. She has said she was not close to her mother, who died in 2013, and has essentially lived independently of her family since age 16.

== Career ==
===1986–1999: Beginnings and film breakout===
As a young child, Lyonne was signed by the Ford Modeling Agency. She was cast as recurring character Opal on &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot; at age seven, where she appeared between September and December 1986, and made her film debut that same year with a small part in the Mike Nichols comedy-drama &quot;Heartburn&quot;. Of her time working as a child actor, Lyonne later said, &quot;I had to become coherent and a businesswoman at six. By 10, I was a jaded professional … I don&#x27;t think [my parents] knew better. It was a decision of [theirs] built on hopeful ignorance&quot;.

After playing a supporting role as Polly in &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; (1993), Lyonne was cast at age 16 in the Woody Allen-directed musical comedy &quot;Everyone Says I Love You&quot; (1996), where she co-starred as D.J., the daughter of main character Joe (played by Allen). This led to a headline role in the independent coming-of-age comedy &quot;Slums of Beverly Hills&quot; (1998), for which she received positive notices for her portrayal of Vivian Abromowitz. Writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Michael O&#x27;Sullivan said, &quot;Lyonne is marvelous in conveying Vivian&#x27;s combination of confusion, curiosity, disgust and desire at what body and psyche are going through. After playing a string of people&#x27;s daughters [in other films], Lyonne really comes into her own here as an actress, registering as a person and not merely someone&#x27;s little girl&quot;.

In 1999, Lyonne starred as Megan Bloomfield, a sexually confused teenager, in the satirical romantic comedy &quot;But I&#x27;m a Cheerleader&quot;. Despite a mixed critical reception upon release, the film was instrumental in raising awareness of the harms of conversion therapy, and has since developed a cult following. In the same year, Lyonne played the small but crucial part of Jessica—a role she reprised in two of the film&#x27;s sequels—in &quot;American Pie&quot; (1999), which grossed over US$230 million at the box office. Other film appearances in 1999 included Christine in &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot; and a headline role in &quot;Freeway II: Confessions of a Trickbaby&quot;. The latter, a follow-up to the 1996 original, was poorly received due to its violence and vulgarity, but Lyonne&#x27;s portrayal of teenage prostitute Crystal Van Meuther was praised for its &quot;earthy, hard-boiled&quot; nature.

===2000–2010: Mainstream and independent films===

Lyonne played the part of Jeanne, a college activist fighting for lesbian equality, in the acclaimed 2000 television film &quot;If These Walls Could Talk 2&quot;. She then appeared in the well-received Holocaust drama &quot;The Grey Zone&quot; (2001), and continued to work steadily through the early 2000s, in mainstream projects such as &quot;Scary Movie 2&quot;, &quot;Kate &amp; Leopold&quot; (both 2001) and &quot;&quot; (2004), as well as smaller productions such as &quot;Zig Zag&quot; (2002), &quot;Die, Mommie, Die!&quot;, &quot;Party Monster&quot; (both 2003), &quot;Madhouse&quot; (2004), and &quot;My Suicidal Sweetheart&quot; (2005). Next, she headlined the 2009 experimental dark comedy &quot;The Immaculate Conception of Little Dizzle&quot;, which was described as &quot;relentlessly strange, courageous, and hyperactive&quot; by &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot;. Her portrayal of Debbie Tennis, a psychotic serial killer, in the 2010 horror parody &quot;All About Evil&quot; was particularly well received, with &quot;Film Threat&quot; commenting, &quot;[its director] rightfully treats Lyonne as the superstar she is, giving us glimpses of the dark residing in [her] that made &quot;Freeway 2: Confessions of a Trick Baby&quot; [sic] the final cult masterpiece of the 20th century&quot;, noting that &quot;her ability to unleash firehoses of ferocity is on full display here&quot;.

===2011–present: Career resurgence and awards success===

Lyonne had a supporting role in Abel Ferrara&#x27;s post-apocalyptic drama &quot;4:44 Last Day on Earth&quot; (2011), which &quot;Movieline&quot; called &quot;weirdly compelling&quot;. Two years later, she began appearing on the Netflix comedy-drama series &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot;; her first television job as a series regular. Critics were effusive about her portrayal of prison inmate Nicky Nichols, for which she received a nomination for the 2014 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series, and was twice awarded—alongside her co-stars—the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Ensemble in a Comedy Series (2015; 2017).

Lyonne&#x27;s work as hard-partying Lou in &quot;Antibirth&quot; (2016), a psychedelic horror feature inspired by the films of David Cronenberg, drew special attention; Alex McLevy wrote in a review for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, &quot;The actor has experienced a remarkable resurgence in the past few years … Here, she channels her storied past to play Lou... drug-addled... plays to Lyonne&#x27;s strengths—a bluntly outsized personality, brash but likable, with a self-destructive streak bigger than the podunk town in which the story unfolds&quot;. Other film credits of hers include &quot;Sleeping with Other People&quot;, &quot;Hello, My Name Is Doris&quot;, &quot;Addicted to Fresno&quot;, &quot;Hashtag Horror&quot; (all 2015); &quot;Yoga Hosers&quot;, &quot;The Intervention&quot; (both 2016); &quot;Handsome&quot; (2017), &quot;Show Dogs&quot; (2018), &quot;Honey Boy&quot; (2019), and James Gray&#x27;s science fiction thriller &quot;Ad Astra&quot; (2019).

After the final season of &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot;, Lyonne began starring as Nadia Vulvokov—a woman trapped in a time loop at her 36th birthday party—on &quot;Russian Doll&quot;, a comedy-drama series she created and produced along with Leslye Headland and Amy Poehler. Debuting on Netflix in February 2019, the show was met with rave reviews, with Lucy Mangan of &quot;The Guardian&quot; calling it &quot;fine [and] impressive,&quot; adding, &quot;Nadia is a magnificent creation and Lyonne gives a performance to match&quot;. Meanwhile, Alan Sepinwall wrote in his review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;:

&quot;Russian Doll&quot; has had two seasons, earning Lyonne three Primetime Emmy nominations: Outstanding Comedy Series, Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series, and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series.

Lyonne portrayed American actress Tallulah Bankhead in Lee Daniels&#x27; &quot;The United States vs. Billie Holiday&quot;, a biographical drama based on the life and career of jazz singer Billie Holiday, in 2021. She made a cameo appearance as herself in the Rian Johnson-directed mystery thriller &quot;Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery&quot; the following year, and hosted the season 47 finale of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, where she performed a five-minute monologue about her career and personal troubles. In January 2023, she starred as Charlie Cale—a casino worker with an innate ability to detect lies—on the Peacock series &quot;Poker Face&quot;. Inspired by television murder mysteries such as &quot;Columbo&quot;, the series was positively reviewed with Nick Hilton of &quot;The Independent&quot; saying it is &quot;satisfyingly pacy and pulpy. Lyonne is a bundle of unhinged charisma.&quot; The show will return for a second season.

In May 2024, it was announced that Lyonne had signed on to star—in an unspecified role—in the MCU superhero film &quot;The Fantastic Four: First Steps&quot;, scheduled to be released in July 2025. In December 2024, Lyonne voiced the character Byrdie in two episodes of the Marvel Animation series What If...?.

=== Theatre work ===
Lyonne made her New York stage debut in the 2008 production of Mike Leigh&#x27;s &quot;Two Thousand Years&quot; at the Acorn Theatre. She was part of the original cast (October 2009–March 2010) of &quot;Love, Loss, and What I Wore&quot;, an off-Broadway play by Nora Ephron and Delia Ephron, based on the book by Ilene Beckerman.

In 2010, Lyonne received positive notices for her performance in Kim Rosenstock&#x27;s comedy &quot;Tigers Be Still&quot; at the Roundabout Theatre Company, with Charles Isherwood commenting in his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;Ms. Lyonne [is] a thorough delight in the flat-out funniest role, the grief-crazed Grace, so deeply immersed in self-pity that she has cast aside any attempts at decorum&quot;.

Lyonne starred in the 2011 production of Tommy Nohilly&#x27;s &quot;Blood from a Stone&quot; at the Acorn Theatre. The following year, she participated in a benefit performance of &quot;Women Behind Bars&quot;.

=== Directing and producing ===
Lyonne made her directorial debut Fall of 2017 with surrealist short film, &quot;Cabiria, Charity, Chastity&quot;, for fashion brand KENZO. Shot by cinematographer Chung-Hoon-Chung, the film follows Chastity, a vaudeville performer, coming to terms with her past. In addition to writing and directing episodes of &quot;Russian Doll&quot; and &quot;Poker Face&quot;, Lyonne directed an episode of &quot;Orange is the New Black&quot; in its final season, and one episode each of the Hulu shows &quot;Shrill&quot; and &quot;High Fidelity&quot;.

Lyonne co-founded the production company Animal Pictures with Maya Rudolph. Its first greenlit project was the sketch comedy special &quot;Sarah Cooper: Everything&#x27;s Fine&quot; (2020), which Lyonne directed. The company also produces &quot;Russian Doll&quot;, &quot;Poker Face&quot;, &quot;Loot&quot;, and the animated series &quot;The Second Best Hospital in the Galaxy&quot;. It was announced in October 2023 that Rudolph had parted ways with the company, leaving Lyonne to operate by herself under the Animal banner. In May 2024, she signed a deal with production company Sister, who will collaborate with Lyonne on upcoming Animal projects.

Regarding her directorial style, Lyonne has expressed frustration with the &quot;simplicity&quot; of modern filmmaking, saying that she likes to counteract this by &quot;filling the frame with an abundance of information&quot;, adding: &quot;I do think there&#x27;s a danger in telling people that brightly lit, crisp things that make perfect sense are good storytelling&quot;. She also believes that research is key to a successful narrative: &quot;Read as many books, watch as many movies, and listen to as much music as you can so that you actually understand the stories that you&#x27;re telling&quot;.

== Public image ==
Lyonne has been featured on the covers of magazines including &quot;Backstage&quot;, &quot;Bust&quot;, &quot;Diva&quot;, &quot;Glamour&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, &quot;Interview&quot;, &quot;Nylon&quot;, &quot;Out&quot;, &quot;Paper&quot;, &quot;Variety&quot;, &quot;Venus&quot;, and &quot;TheWrap&quot;.

Speaking of her &quot;tough guy&quot; persona, Lyonne told a journalist in 2023, &quot;I&#x27;ve been stealing from De Niro my whole life. [As] much as I love Bette Davis and Mae West and Gena Rowlands, I often found myself identifying with the Peter Falks and the Joe Pescis and the Jimmy Cagneys—all the boys. Certainly, by the time I was writing &quot;Russian Doll&quot;, I saw a character who was the perfect mix of feminine and masculine&quot;.

She has been described as a &quot;lesbian icon&quot;, due to playing gay characters in works such as &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot; and &quot;But I&#x27;m a Cheerleader&quot;, and because of her advocacy for the LGBT community, in 2015 Lyonne was awarded the Human Rights Campaign&#x27;s Ally for Equality Award.

== Personal life ==
In 1997, Lyonne used her paycheck from &quot;Everyone Says I Love You&quot; to buy an apartment near Gramercy Park. As of 2023, she lives in New York City&#x27;s East Village and owns a residence in Los Angeles.

=== Relationships ===

Estranged from her biological family, Lyonne has discussed the importance of the chosen family she has developed through friends and collaborators. She counts Amy Poehler, Maya Rudolph, and Janicza Bravo among her personal friends; she is particularly close to Melanie Lynskey and Clea DuVall. She said of her friendship with Chloë Sevigny, &quot;[She is] more than my best friend, she might have actually morphed into [being] my sister&quot;. Lyonne is also close to Aubrey Plaza.

Lyonne identifies as straight, but has also said of her sexuality, &quot;I look at sex more as… &#x27;hmm, what&#x27;s this mischief I can get into?&#x27; I&#x27;m in this third category. My sexuality and gender is more like… merry prankster&quot;.

Lyonne dated Edward Furlong in the late 1990s and Andrew Zipern in the early 2010s. She began dating comedian and actor Fred Armisen in 2014, but confirmed in April 2022 that the relationship had ended. The two remain close friends.

=== Health and legal troubles ===

During the early 2000s, Lyonne experienced legal problems and was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol, and for incidents involving threatening her neighbors. In 2005, she was evicted by her landlord, actor Michael Rapaport, following complaints by other tenants about her behavior.

In 2005, Lyonne was admitted—under a pseudonym—to Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan, suffering from hepatitis C, infective endocarditis, and a collapsed lung; she was also undergoing methadone treatment for heroin addiction. In January 2006, a warrant was issued for her arrest after she missed a court hearing relating to her prior legal problems. Her lawyer said an emergency had arisen but did not give details. Later in the same year, Lyonne was admitted to a drug and alcohol treatment center; she appeared in court afterwards and the judge entered a conditional discharge. She has not used drugs since December 2006, and has been open about her addiction and recovery.

Lyonne underwent open-heart surgery in 2012 to correct heart valve damage caused by her previous heart infection. She quit smoking in 2023.

== Influences and interests ==
Lyonne has cited John Cassavetes, Peter Falk, Lou Reed, Nora Ephron, and Delia Ephron as being professional inspirations. Her favorite film performances include Giulietta Masina in &quot;Nights of Cabiria&quot; (1957), Gena Rowlands in &quot;A Woman Under the Influence&quot; (1974), David Thewlis in &quot;Naked&quot; (1993), and Roy Scheider in &quot;All That Jazz&quot; (1979).

A fan of crossword puzzles, Lyonne designed a crossword for &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2019. During the 2023 WGA strike, she auctioned off the opportunity for fans to solve a &quot;New York Times&quot; crossword with her to raise money for the Union Solidarity Coalition. Her other interests include philosophy and classic cinema.

Lyonne has a pet Maltipoo dog named Rootbeer, who regularly makes appearances on her social media and in interviews.

<text>The Paramount Fine Foods Centre, formerly the Hershey Centre, is a multi-purpose sports and entertainment complex located in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. Its current name was adopted on July 1, 2018, following a new naming rights agreement with Mississauga-based restaurant chain Paramount Fine Foods.

==History==
First opened in 1998 as the Hershey Centre, the complex is located on Rose Cherry Place, which was named after the late wife of Don Cherry, founder and former owner of the Mississauga IceDogs hockey team. The closest major intersection is Kennedy Road and Matheson Boulevard East. In 2007, a new multi-sport facility called SportZone opened just to the north of the main bowl. It houses a full-size indoor soccer field, a full size FIBA basketball court, a gymnastics facility, and two outdoor soccer fields.

The centre is currently the home arena for the Raptors 905 of the NBA G League (basketball). It previously housed the Mississauga Steelheads of the Ontario Hockey League (ice hockey), the Mississauga IceDogs (ice hockey) from 1998 to 2007, the Mississauga Power (basketball) from 2011 to 2015, the Toronto ThunderHawks of the National Professional Soccer League from 2000 to 2001, and the Mississauga MetroStars of the Major Arena Soccer League (indoor soccer) from 2018 to 2019. It has also been the venue for numerous musical acts, including The Tragically Hip, Green Day, The White Stripes, Hatebreed, and Chinese superstar Joker Xue.

In 2024, the city of Mississauga and Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment (owner of Raptors 905) partnered to being construction of a $30 practice facility next to the Paramount Fine Foods Centre, which is scheduled to be completed in January 2026.

==Major events==

===Hockey===
Along with being the home of Mississauga&#x27;s OHL teams since its opening, it has hosted several hockey events. In the year 2000 the Hershey Centre hosted the OHL All-Star Classic as well as the IIHF Women&#x27;s World Hockey Championship. The OHL Championship Series for the J. Ross Robertson Cup has been held at the facility in 2004, 2011 and 2017. In May 2011 the Mississauga St. Michael&#x27;s Majors hosted the 2011 Memorial Cup. The Saint John Sea Dogs defeated Mississauga in the Final 3–1.

===Basketball===
The National Basketball League of Canada announced that the Oshawa Power would relocate to Mississauga and play as the Mississauga Power at the Hershey Centre starting in the 2013–14 season.

The Toronto Raptors announced that beginning in the 2015–16 season, they would have a team in the NBA Development League in Mississauga and play as the Raptors 905 at the Hershey Centre. The Toronto Raptors organization acquired the Power. The team departed from the NBLC to join the NBA D-League as the Raptors 905. In 2017 and 2018 the Raptors 905 hosted both the NBA G League Showcase as well as the G League Finals at the arena.

===Figure skating===
The arena has hosted the Skate Canada International figure skating competition, part of the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating series in 2000, 2003, 2011 and in 2016. The venue is also host to this competition in October 2022.

<text>Mara Elizabeth Wilson (born July 24, 1987) is an American actress. As a child, she played Natalie Hillard in the film &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot; (1993) and went on to play Susan Walker in &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; (1994), the title character in &quot;Matilda&quot; (1996), and Annabel Greening in &quot;A Simple Wish&quot; (1997). Following her role as Lily in &quot;Thomas and the Magic Railroad&quot; (2000), Wilson took a 12-year hiatus from acting to focus on writing. She returned to acting in 2012 and has predominantly worked in web series.

==Early life==
Mara Elizabeth Wilson was born in Burbank, California, on July 24, 1987, the oldest daughter of Burbank PTA school volunteer Suzie () and KTLA broadcast engineer Mike Wilson. Her mother was Jewish, while her father is a Catholic of Irish descent.

Wilson&#x27;s mother was diagnosed with breast cancer on March 10, 1995, and died on April 26, 1996. The film &quot;Matilda&quot; was dedicated to her memory. Wilson later recalled that this affected her interest in acting. At age 12, Wilson was diagnosed with obsessive–compulsive disorder. She has also been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. She attended John Burroughs High School and then transferred to Idyllwild Arts Academy. After graduation in 2005, Wilson relocated to New York City to continue her studies at New York University&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts, graduating in 2009. Wilson appeared in her own one-woman show called &quot;Weren&#x27;t You That Girl?&quot; while in college.

==Career==

When Wilson was five, she became interested in acting after watching her older brother Danny appear in television commercials. Wilson&#x27;s parents were initially opposed, but after appearing in several commercials for businesses, Wilson was invited to audition for the 1993 comedy film &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot;. Producers cast Wilson in the role of Natalie Hillard. The following year, Wilson appeared in a remake of &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot;.

Wilson sang &quot;Make &#x27;Em Laugh&quot; at the 67th Academy Awards broadcast on March 27, 1995, with Tim Curry and Kathy Najimy. In 1995, Wilson won the ShoWest Award for Young Star of the Year.

Wilson&#x27;s film work caught the attention of Danny DeVito, and she was cast as the protagonist Matilda Wormwood in the 1996 film &quot;Matilda&quot;. She was nine years old at the time. Wilson was nominated for three awards for her performance, winning the YoungStar Award for Best Performance by a Young Actress in a Comedy Film.

In 1997, Wilson starred in &quot;A Simple Wish&quot; alongside Martin Short. Although she was nominated for three awards again, the film mostly received negative reviews by critics.

In 1997, Wilson went to a table reading for &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot; starring Robin Williams, but she did not get the part. A year later, she auditioned for the 1998 remake of Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Parent Trap&quot;, but the role was given to Lindsay Lohan after Wilson was deemed too young. In 1999, she portrayed Willow Johnson in the film for The Wonderful World of Disney titled &quot;Balloon Farm&quot;.

In 2000, Wilson appeared in the fantasy film &quot;Thomas and the Magic Railroad&quot;, which was her last film. The film was panned by critics and performed poorly at the box office. Wilson retired from film work shortly afterwards. She received a script for the 2001 film &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; but declined to audition.

Wilson&#x27;s theater credits include &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; and &quot;Cinderella&quot;. She starred in her own live shows &quot;Weren&#x27;t You That Girl?&quot; and &quot;What Are You Afraid Of?&quot;

In 2012, Wilson appeared briefly in one episode of the web series &quot;Missed Connection&quot; in the role of Bitty, and made special appearances on internet review shows for &quot;That Guy with the Glasses&quot;, including a comedic turn playing an adult Matilda during a review of &quot;Matilda&quot; by The Nostalgia Chick, Lindsay Ellis. That year, Wilson explained why she quit film acting: &quot;Film acting is not very fun. Doing the same thing over and over again until, in the director&#x27;s eyes, you &#x27;get it right&#x27;, does not allow for very much creative freedom. The best times I had on film sets were the times the director let me express myself, but those were rare.&quot;

In 2012, she started publishing online writing at a blog called &quot;Mara Wilson Writes Stuff&quot;, where in 2014 she shared memories of working with Robin Williams after his death. In 2018, she moved to Substack with a blog called &quot;Shan&#x27;t We Call the Vicar.&quot;

In April 2013, she attended and shared her impressions of the Broadway production of &quot;Matilda the Musical&quot;.

In May 2013, Wilson wrote an article for Cracked.com, offering her opinion of the delinquency of some former child stars. As of 2013, Wilson worked for Publicolor. Her play &quot;Sheeple&quot; was produced in 2013 for the New York International Fringe Festival. In an interview that December, Wilson stated that her film acting days are over, and that she is instead focusing on writing. Wilson’s book &quot;Where Am I Now?: True Stories of Girlhood and Accidental Fame&quot; was published on September 13, 2016.

Wilson had a recurring role on the podcast &quot;Welcome to Night Vale&quot; as &quot;The Faceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives in Your Home&quot;, as well as her own storytelling show called &quot;What Are You Afraid Of?&quot; In 2016, Wilson made a brief return to television in a &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot;-inspired episode of &quot;Broad City&quot;, in which she played a waitress where the comical Heimlich scene from the film was re-enacted. That same year, Wilson voiced Jill Pill, a writer/director anthropomorphic spider, in season 3 of &quot;BoJack Horseman&quot;. Wilson voiced Liv Amara/Diane &quot;Di&quot; Amara in &quot;Big Hero 6: The Series&quot;.

In a 2017 NPR interview, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; voice actress Nancy Cartwright stated that a young Wilson was the inspiration for a character&#x27;s voice on the episode &quot;Bart Sells His Soul&quot;.

In 2020 she discussed her childhood acting experiences in the HBO documentary &quot;Showbiz Kids.&quot;

In May 2024, she reunited with &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot; cast members Lisa Jakub and Matthew Lawrence for a joint podcast appearance. They had also reunited in 2018 together with Pierce Brosnan on the &quot;Today Show&quot; to mark the film&#x27;s 25th anniversary.

==Charity work==
In 2015, Wilson collaborated with Project UROK, a nonprofit organization whose mission is to aid teens with mental illness.

==Personal life==
Wilson has three older brothers and a younger sister. She is a cousin of political commentator and media host Ben Shapiro, whom she has disavowed due to his conservative views and her left-wing beliefs; the two have no contact with each other. Wilson was raised Jewish. She became an atheist at the age of 15. In a 2020 interview, Wilson described herself as an agnostic. In 2023, she participated in an online discussion with Rabbi Danya Ruttenberg for the 92nd Street Y.

In 2014, she was working for the non-profit Publicolor, a New York City-based nonprofit involved in repainting public schools.

In 2015, Wilson appeared in a video by the mental health charity Project UROK in which she discussed the mental illnesses she has experienced, including anxiety, depression, and obsessive–compulsive disorder. Wilson discussed her history of mental illness on Paul Gilmartin&#x27;s podcast &quot;The Mental Illness Happy Hour&quot;.

Wilson came out as bisexual and queer during an interview with Medium in September 2017. In a 2017 op-ed in &quot;Elle&quot; magazine, she defended the then-13-year-old actress Millie Bobby Brown after commentators sexualized Brown&#x27;s public image. In a 2021 op-ed in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Wilson commented on the documentary &quot;Framing Britney Spears&quot; and the parallels between her own life as a child star and Britney Spears&#x27;. Wilson recalled an incident in which she was asked to comment on the burgeoning sexuality of an 18-year-old Spears when she herself was barely 13, and expressed relief at largely escaping oversexualization of her public image compared to Spears. Wilson described her disappointment when a reporter called her a &quot;spoiled brat&quot; after she stated that she wanted the day off on her 13th birthday instead of granting interviews.

As of 2013, Wilson resided in the Queens borough of New York City, before later moving back to California.

<doc id="679977" wikidata="Q2508461" url="?curid=679977" title="Zaheer Khan">
<text>Zaheer Khan (born 8 October 1978) is an Indian former professional cricketer who played all formats of the game for the Indian national team from 2000 till 2014. A left-arm fast-medium bowler known for his ability to &quot;move the ball both ways off the wicket and swing the old ball at some pace&quot;, he was known for reverse swing with the old ball. Considered one of the best fast bowlers Indian cricket as ever produced, he was the second-most successful Indian pace bowler (tied with Ishant Sharma) in Test cricket, behind Kapil Dev. 

He also has the distinct record of dismissing Graeme Smith, Kumar Sangakkara, Sanath Jayasuriya and Matthew Hayden – some of the game&#x27;s most feared left-handed batsmen – over 10 times each in international cricket, and also holds the record for dismissing the third-most number of left-handed batsmen (237), after Muttiah Muralitharan (325), and Shaun Pollock (252).

Khan started his domestic career by playing for Baroda. In Tests, he was averaged around 36 at home and 31 away from home. With India, he was a member of the team that was one of the joint-winners of the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy, and one of the key members of the 2011 World Cup winning team, leading the pace attack with 21 wickets in just 9 games. In 2011 he was conferred with the Arjuna Award, India&#x27;s second highest sporting honour, by the President of India. 

During the course of his career, Khan sustained recurring injuries, which often interrupted his progress at the international level, and this was the reason he set up ProSport Fitness &amp; Services, a special rehabilitation &amp; training center in association with Adrian Le Roux and Andrew Leipus. 

Khan was selected as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in the year 2008. He announced his retirement from international cricket in October 2015. He played for Worcestershire in County Cricket and played for Royal Challengers Bangalore, Delhi Daredevils and Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League. In 2020, the Government of India honoured him with the Padma Shri. He is presently the mentor of the IPL team Lucknow Super Giants.

==Early and personal life ==

Khan was born on 7 October 1978 in Shrirampur, Ahmednagar district, Maharashtra, in a Marathi Muslim family to Zakia and Bakhtiyar Khan. He has an elder brother, Zeeshan and a younger brother, Anees. He started his coaching under Utsav Yadav, and attended the New Marathi Primary School and the K.J. Somaiyya Secondary School in Shrirampur. He also played in the local Revenue Colony Cricket Club (RCC) in Shrirampur after which he started his career in Pune.

On 24 April 2017, he announced on his Twitter account that he was engaged to actress Sagarika Ghatge. The couple got married on 23 November 2017.

== Domestic career ==
Khan came to Mumbai in 1996 and joined the National Cricket Club that played in Division A in the city. He played in competitions such as the Kanga Cricket League, Comrade Shield and the Purshottam Shield with the team. Sandeep Mahadkar, Khan&#x27;s captain during the time, recalled the latter&#x27;s ability with the ball with an instance where he reverse swung a ball that had been bowled 50 overs with, bowling ten maiden overs and helping his team win a Comrade Shield game. His ability with the bat was recalled by another former teammate with who Khan put together a 102-run stand for ninth wicket making an unbeaten 62 runs taking his team home. His &quot;jaw-dropping spells in the Purshottam Shield&quot; culminated with the 7/74 performance against Shivaji Park Gymkhana in January 1997. he was later sent to the MRF Pace Foundation in Chennai by Sudhir Naik, owner of the National Cricket Club. Impressed by his talent, the bowling coach there, T. A. Sekhar, pushed Khan to play for Baroda.

Khan quickly made his name playing for Baroda in the first-class level. In the final of the 2000–01 season of the Ranji Trophy against Railways, Khan received the man of the match award after he returned figures of 8/145 for the match, including a five-wicket haul in the second innings (5/16), helping his team lift the trophy for the fifth time and a first in 43 years.

Khan transferred to Mumbai at the start of the 2006–07 Indian cricket season his debut for Mumbai until the final of the Ranji Trophy in which he took 9 wickets as Mumbai defeated Bengal.

In 2005 Khan, signed for Worcestershire County Cricket Club in England as one of their two overseas players, replacing Shoaib Akhtar. Although Worcestershire went on to lose the match, Zaheer took ten wickets against Somerset on debut; in doing so he became the first Worcestershire player to take 10 wickets on debut for over 100 years. In June he took the first nine wickets to fall in the first innings against Essex, ending with 9–138; had wicket-keeper Steven Davies not dropped a catch offered by last man Darren Gough he would have become the first bowler ever to take all ten for the county.

Khan has played the Royal Challengers as well as Mumbai Indians before he was picked for the Delhi Daredevils in the 2015 auction. He has captained the Daredevils in 2016 and 2017. In 2017 season, Zaheer became the 10th bowler in the history and 8th Indian bowler, to pick 100 wickets in Indian Premier League. At the age of 38, he is the oldest player to achieve this feat.

==International career==
Zaheer was selected in 2000 for the first intake of the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore. He made his Test debut against Bangladesh and ODI debut against Kenya during the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy in the same year.

===Struggling form===
In late 2005 pacemen Sreesanth and R. P. Singh made their international debuts and became regular members of the Indian team making it difficult for Zaheer to retain his position in the playing eleven. The Board of Control for Cricket in India demoted Zaheer from a B-grade to a C-grade contract at the end of the year. He returned for the 2005 tour of Pakistan, where India fielded three left arm pacemen and had difficulty dismissing Pakistan with a lack of variety in the bowling attack.

===Recall to team===
Late in 2006, Zaheer was recalled to the Test and ODI team for the tour of South Africa, following Irfan Pathan&#x27;s slump in form and an injury to Munaf Patel. After consistent performances on tour, his performance in early 2007 in home ODIs against the West Indies and Sri Lanka, including a career best 5/42, saw him named in the squad for the 2007 World Cup.

He won the Man of the Match award in the first Test between India and Australia in the 2008–2009 series in India for his all round performance with the bat and the ball.

===ODI career===
He has taken 282 ODI wickets at an average of just over 29 runs per wicket taking 4 wickets in a match 6 times (4 times against Zimbabwe) including 32 wickets against Zimbabwe at an average of 17.46 runs per dismissal. He, along with other seamers like Javagal Srinath and Ashish Nehra helped India to make it to the finals of the 2003 World Cup. Zaheer finished the tournament as fourth highest wicket-taker – 18 wickets from 11 matches at an average of 20 runs per wicket. He is also the fourth highest wicket-taker in ODIs for India with 282 scalps behind Anil Kumble (337), Javagal Srinath (315) and Ajit Agarkar (288).

===Test career===
Zaheer has taken 311 Test wickets at an average of just over 32 runs per wicket. South African star all-rounder Jacques Kallis was Zaheer&#x27;s 300th test wicket. In 16 matches from the beginning of the tour of West Indies in April 2002 to the end of the 1st match against Australia in December 2003, Brisbane, Zaheer took 54 wickets from 16 matches at an average of 30 runs. It all turned downhill after the first Test against Australia in Brisbane in December 2003. Having taken 5 of the top 7 Australian batsmen in the first innings (5 for 95), he injured himself in the second during the opening spell. After missing the second Test he returned for the third, but was injured midway through the match and was forced to return home. The injury kept him from the early 2004 tour of Pakistan, India&#x27;s first Test series victory in the country.

Earlier, Zaheer held the world record for the highest Test score by a number 11 when he scored 75 against Bangladesh in 2004. At the time he was batting with Sachin Tendulkar; the pair amassed 133 runs, a new record for India&#x27;s tenth-wicket. This record was broken by Tino Best of the West Indies in 2012. The current record holder is Ashton Agar of the Australia on his debut match in 2013.

===Knuckle Ball===
In international cricket, Zaheer Khan was the first bowler to bowl knuckle ball. Zaheer Khan introduced the knuckle ball way back in 2011 world cup. He used that ball for great effect. He used that ball to get crucial wickets at crucial times like the wickets of Ian Bell and Paul Collingwood against England and the wicket of Devon Smith against the West Indies and the wicket of Michael Hussey in the Quarter Final against Australia.

In an interview he said : &quot;The whole 2011 World Cup, I was looking forward to it, especially playing in front of the home crowd – even if it added that extra bit of pressure. I was preparing a new delivery that I wanted to use, which was the knuckle ball. I was working on it for a year leading up to the tournament. Even though I had perfected it, I was purposely not using it in any of the matches [before the tournament]. It got me a lot of success. When a plan like that works, it gives you extra satisfaction.&quot;

===World Cup===
Zaheer has 44 World Cup wickets, spanning from 2003 to 2011, putting him in ninth place behind Glenn McGrath (71), Muttiah Muralitharan (68), Mitchell Starc(65), Lasith Malinga (56), Wasim Akram (55), Trent Boult(53) and Chaminda Vaas (49) on the list of highest number of wickets by a bowler in the marquee event. He is tied with Srinath in ninth but Srinath has played 34 games as opposed to Zaheer&#x27;s 23.

Zaheer, who was one of India&#x27;s trump cards during their World Cup triumph in 2011, finished as the joint highest wicket-taker along with Shahid Afridi with 21 scalps.

===Later career===
July 2011 India embarked on a tour of England. Having bowled 13.3 overs, Zaheer strained his hamstring and suffered an ankle injury in the first Test of the four-match series and as a result was ruled out of the rest of the tour. Zaheer came back in December and played a test match against Australia on Boxing day. He took two wickets in two consecutive deliveries, dismissing Michael Clarke for 31 and Mike Hussey for a duck. In the second test at Sydney, he took three wickets of the four to fall, Clarke scoring 329*; his were the best figures in both these innings. Zaheer Khan is ranked 22 in the ICC Player Rankings for Test bowlers. He toured South Africa in December 2013 and New Zealand in 2014.

===Retirement===
Zaheer Khan announced his retirement from international and first-class cricket on 15 October 2015 in a tweet saying &quot;I bid adieu to my career in international cricket. I look forward to signing off with IPL 9.&quot;

==Coaching career==
Zaheer was appointed as bowling consultant for the India national cricket team in 2017

==ProSport Fitness &amp; Services==

In 2014 Khan founded a fitness and sports company ProSport Fitness and Services in Mumbai, that offers fitness training and physiotherapy services. Involving personnel such as Andrew Leipus and Adrian Le Roux, the center aims to &quot;maximize potential&quot; of people and athletes by personally assisted fitness programs. Khan stated that the objective was to &quot;bring in world class fitness program to India for sports injury management&quot;. It offers scientifically designed programs and treatment while conducting workshops and sessions for corporates and schools to spread awareness of physical fitness.

<doc id="679982" wikidata="Q2006864" url="?curid=679982" title="Northern Yan">
<text>Yan, known in historiography as the Northern Yan (; 407 or 409–436), Eastern Yan () or Huanglong (), was a dynastic state of China during the era of Sixteen Kingdoms. Some historians consider Gao Yun, a member of the Goguryeo royal family, to be the first Northern Yan monarch, while others consider Feng Ba of Han ethnicity to be the founder.

All rulers of the Northern Yan took the title of &quot;Tiān Wáng&quot; (Heavenly King). The Northern Yan inherited what was left of the preceding Later Yan regime, whose territory occupied western Liaoning and parts of northeastern Hebei. In historiography, they are given the prefix of &quot;Northern&quot; to distinguish it with the contemporaneous Southern Yan, and unlike the Later Yan, their capital remained at Longcheng in the north throughout their existence.

== History ==

=== Background ===
Gao Yun was a descendant of the Goguryeo royal family. When the Former Yan captured the Goguryeo capital, Hwando in 342, they also captured several members of the royal family and moved them to Qingshan (青山, in modern Jinzhou, Liaoning), where Gao Yun was born and grew to become a minor general under the Later Yan. In 397, Gao Yun helped the Yan emperor, Murong Bao quell the rebellion of his son, Murong Hui. As a reward, Bao adopted him as his own son, changing his name to Murong Yun. 

It was around this time when Murong Yun became friends with the general, Feng Ba. Feng Ba was a Han Chinese whose family was originally from Changle Commandery before his grandfather, Feng He (馮和) moved to Shangdang during the Disaster of Yongjia. Ba&#x27;s father, Feng An (馮安) served as a military general under the Western Yan. After Later Yan conquered Western Yan in 394, the Feng clan resettled in Longcheng. Feng Ba appeared to have grown up under heavy Xianbei influence, as his nickname Qizhifa (乞直伐) suggests Xianbei origin.

In 401, Murong Yun&#x27;s adoptive uncle, Murong Xi came to power, and he was described in records as a cruel and arbitrary ruler. Feng Ba and his brother, Feng Sufu were charged with crimes against Xi, forcing them to flee to the countryside where they were determined to overthrow him. In 407, as Murong Xi was holding a funeral for Empress Fu, Feng Ba and his conspirators took control of the capital Longcheng and acclaimed Murong Yun as their leader. Xi initially led an assault on Longcheng but then fled the battle alone in panic. After his forces collapsed, Xi was later found and executed by Yun.

=== Reign of Gao Yun and Feng Ba ===
The founding year of the Northern Yan is up to debate; some historians consider Feng Ba as the first ruler of Northern Yan while others assert that it was Gao Yun. The reason is that Gao Yun was a member of the Later Yan imperial family as Murong Bao&#x27;s adopted son, and so he should be considered the last ruler of Later Yan. On the other hand, he was ethnically Goguryeo and reverted back to his old family name shortly after ascending. Thus, Northern Yan&#x27;s founding year can either be 407 or 409.

Gao Yun took the title of Heavenly King. The Later Yan was previously at war with Goguryeo, but Yun managed to establish friendly relations between them and Northern Yan. However, conflict with the Northern Wei also began as the Yan Inspector of You Province, Murong Yi (慕容懿) defected to Wei. Worried by his lack of reputation, Yun attempted to protect himself by empowering his favourites, but in 409, two of them, Li Ban (離班) and Tao Ren (桃仁) assassinated him. Feng Ba&#x27;s men then had the assassins killed, and the officials acclaimed him as the new Heavenly King.

The Northern Yan was relatively weak compared to Northern Wei, so Feng Ba formed good relations with the Eastern Jin, Hu Xia, Rouran, Khitan and Kumo Xi. He secured the support of his people by actively participating in politics, promoting agriculture and reducing tax burdens. However, he was also wary of handing out higher offices to his retainers, which led to a rebellion by his cousins in 410. On two occasions, Feng Ba had Wei envoys detained. In 416 and 418, Wei clashed with Yan, but due to pressure from stronger neighbours like the Hu Xia, they were unable to launch any substantial campaign throughout Feng Ba&#x27;s reign. Northern Yan also continued Later Yan&#x27;s dual administrative system between their Han Chinese and &quot;Hu&quot; subjects, as Feng Ba appointed his Crown Prince as the Grand Chanyu to supervise the tribes, along with introducing other offices to assist the Grand Chanyu.

=== Decline and fall ===
Feng Ba became deathly ill in 430. Conflict arose between his Crown Prince, Feng Yi (馮翼) and favourite concubine, Consort Song (宋夫人), who wanted her own son to inherit the throne. The situation soon leaked to Feng Ba&#x27;s brother, the Prime Minister Feng Hong, who led his troops and took over the capital. Feng Ba died soon after, and Feng Hong took the throne for himself, slaughtering all of Feng Ba&#x27;s sons including Feng Yi. 

At the time, the Wei had dealt with the Hu Xia threat in the west and began focusing on conquering Northern Yan. From 432 onwards, Yan faced periodic attacks from Wei. In 433, a succession issue led to Feng Hong&#x27;s sons handing over Liaoxi Commandery to Wei. Feng Hong refused to surrender and attempted to secure his position by allying with the Liu Song dynasty, even becoming a vassal to them in 435, but Wei continued their assault nonetheless. Finally, a major Wei invasion in 436 prompted Feng Hong to flee to Goguryeo for protection, ending the Northern Yan.

Feng Hong remained in Goguryeo until 438. While the Goguryeo king, Jangsu initially refused to hand him over to Wei, Feng Hong repeatedly offended him and tried to escape to Liu Song, resulting in Jangsu executing him and his sons. In Northern Wei, Feng Ba&#x27;s granddaughter grew to become Empress Dowager Feng, an important figure in Wei&#x27;s history. In 1965, the tomb of Feng Sufu was discovered in Beipiao, Liaoning, which contained the earliest extant of the double stirrup along with a unique duck-shaped glassware.

<doc id="679984" wikidata="Q937913" url="?curid=679984" title="Doogie Howser, M.D.">
<text>Doogie Howser, M.D. is an American medical sitcom that ran for four seasons on ABC from September 19, 1989, to March 24, 1993, totaling 97 episodes. Created by Steven Bochco and David E. Kelley, the show stars Neil Patrick Harris in the title role as a teenage physician who balances the challenge of practicing medicine with the everyday problems of teenage life.

==Plot==
Dr. Douglas &quot;Doogie&quot; Howser (Harris) is the son of David (James B. Sikking) and Katherine Howser (Belinda Montgomery). As a child, he twice survived early-stage pediatric leukemia after his father—a family physician—discovered suspicious bruising. The experience contributed to the younger Howser&#x27;s desire to enter medicine.

Possessing a genius intellect and a photographic memory, Howser participates in a longitudinal study of child prodigies until his 18th birthday. He earned a perfect score on the SAT at the age of six, completed high school in nine weeks, graduated from Princeton University in 1983 at age 10, and finished medical school four years later. At age 14, Howser was the youngest licensed physician in the country. As a newspaper article (one of several noting some of Doogie&#x27;s aforementioned accomplishments that are shown in the series&#x27; opening title sequence) stated, he &quot;can&#x27;t buy beer... [but] can prescribe drugs&quot;.

The series begins on Howser&#x27;s 16th birthday; the cold open of the pilot episode shows him stopping his field test for his driver&#x27;s license to help an injured person at the scene of a traffic accident. Howser is a second-year resident surgeon at Eastman Medical Center in Los Angeles, and still lives at home with his parents. His best friend and neighbor, Vinnie Delpino (Max Casella), is a more typical teenager—climbing through Howser&#x27;s bedroom window to visit—and connects him to life outside of medicine. Howser has kept a diary on his computer since 1979; episodes typically end with him making an entry in it, making observations about the situations he had experienced or learned in the episode.

Howser seeks acceptance both from children his age and from his professional colleagues. Many episodes also deal with wider social problems: AIDS awareness, racism, antisemitism, homophobia, sexism, gang violence, access to quality medical care, and losing one&#x27;s virginity are topics, along with aging, body issues, and friendship.

Howser initially has a girlfriend, Wanda Plenn (Lisa Dean Ryan), but they break up after she leaves for college; he also begins a trauma surgery fellowship and moves into his own apartment. Bochco intended to end the show with a &quot;season-long story arc for Doogie where he becomes disaffected with the practice of medicine and quits medicine to become a writer&quot;. ABC abruptly canceled the show due to low ratings, preventing Bochco and the show&#x27;s writers from implementing that storyline, other than Howser&#x27;s resignation from Eastman and departure for Europe in the final episode.

==Production==
The weekly, half-hour dramedy was created by Steven Bochco. He originated the concept and asked David E. Kelley to help write the pilot, earning Kelley a &quot;created by&quot; credit. Harris was the first actor the show&#x27;s staff had found that could convincingly play a teenage doctor, but ABC executives opposed his casting. Bochco&#x27;s contract required that the network pay an &quot;enormous&quot; penalty if it canceled the project, so ABC was forced to let him film the pilot. The network still opposed Harris&#x27;s casting and disliked the pilot, but after positive reception during test screenings, ABC greenlit the show.

==Cast==

===Main cast===
* Neil Patrick Harris as Dr. Douglas &quot;Doogie&quot; Howser, the show&#x27;s protagonist.
* Max Casella as Vincent &quot;Vinnie&quot; Salvatore Delpino, Doogie&#x27;s best friend since they were five years old. A typical girl-crazy teenager, Vinnie resists his father&#x27;s demands to join the family business and instead attends film school to pursue a career as a film director.
* Belinda Montgomery as Katherine Howser, Doogie Howser&#x27;s mother. Originally a housewife, she later returns to work as a patient advocate at her son&#x27;s hospital.
* Lawrence Pressman as Dr. Benjamin Canfield, head of Eastman Medical. Canfield is an old friend and classmate of David Howser, and persuades him to join the hospital to run its family practice.
* Mitchell Anderson (seasons 1–2) as Dr. Jack McGuire, a resident at Eastman and Doogie&#x27;s friendly rival. A visit to rural Mexico inspires him to leave the hospital to serve the poor overseas.
* Kathryn Layng as Mary Margaret &quot;Curly&quot; Spaulding, a nurse at Eastman. Spaulding occasionally dates McGuire and, briefly, both Canfield and Howser.
* James B. Sikking as Dr. David Howser, Doogie Howser&#x27;s father. He&#x27;s a Vietnam War MASH veteran with a family practice.
* Lisa Dean Ryan (seasons 1–2, recurring in season 3) as Wanda Plenn, Vinnie&#x27;s high-school classmate and Doogie&#x27;s girlfriend. After her mother dies in an automobile accident, Wanda&#x27;s relationship with Doogie suffers. After she leaves for the School of the Art Institute of Chicago they end their relationship.
* Lucy Boryer (seasons 1–3, two episodes in season 4) as Janine Stewart, Vinnie&#x27;s girlfriend and Wanda&#x27;s best friend. She drops out of college and becomes a buyer for a department store.
* Markus Redmond (seasons 2–4, guest star in season 1) as Raymond Alexander, an orderly (and later an EMT) at Eastman. While he was a gang member, Alexander meets Doogie after taking him hostage during a convenience-store robbery; after finishing his sentence, Doogie helps him get a job at the hospital as an orderly.

===Recurring cast===
* Rif Hutton as Dr. Ron Welch, a fellow doctor who is also friends with Howser.
* Robyn Lively as Michele Faber (seasons 2 and 4), a nursing student. She becomes Howser&#x27;s girlfriend shortly before he decides to leave Eastman and go to Europe.
* Barry Livingston as Dr. Bob Rickett (seasons 2–4), a fellow doctor working at Eastman.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
According to Metacritic, Marvin Kitman of &quot;Newsday&quot; gave season 1 of &quot;Doogie Howser, M.D.&quot; a 40/100 score and commented: &quot;What a wasted childhood my kids have had, I got to thinking while watching this otherwise normal Doogie Howser. It makes you look at your kids differently. What lazy bums they must be, still in high school at 16.&quot; Scott Weinberg of DVD Talk recommended season two: &quot;It&#x27;s not high art, but it&#x27;s a heckuva lot better than what generally passes for your average weeknight sitcom.&quot; Christopher Smith of the &quot;Bangor Daily News&quot; gave season three a &quot;C&quot; grade and commented: &quot;No classic, this series. [...T]he show has become gratingly cute, particularly in the episodes “Doogiesomething,” “Double Doogie with Cheese,” and “Lonesome Doog.” Doog, I&#x27;m Dooged out.&quot;

===Awards and nominations===
==Cultural influence==

* Neil Patrick Harris has satirized his years playing a teenage medical doctor several times:
** In an episode of &quot;Roseanne&quot;, Roseanne Conner (Roseanne Barr) has a dream after having undergone breast reduction surgery. She goes to the mirror and realizes that her breasts are comically larger than before. Doogie Howser (Harris) comes in and asks an upset Roseanne if they were supposed to be bigger.
** Barney Stinson (also played by Harris) writes in his computerized diary at the end of the &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; episode &quot;The Bracket,&quot; while the &quot;Doogie Howser&quot; theme music plays. In the later episode &quot;The Stinsons,&quot; he also comments, &quot;Call me crazy but child actors were way better in the &#x27;80s&quot;.
** In the 2004 comedy &quot;Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle&quot;, Harris – playing a fictionalized version of himself – claims to have &quot;humped every piece of ass ever on that show&quot; (except the hot nurse, over whom he expresses regret). Harris is referred to as &quot;Doogie Howser&quot; while stealing Harold (John Cho)&#x27;s car from the convenience store. In &quot;Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay&quot;, Harris remarks, after taking psychotropic mushrooms, &quot;Dude, I was able to perform an appendectomy at 14, I think I can handle a few &#x27;shrooms&quot;.
** In 2008, Harris appeared in commercials for Old Spice deodorant, claiming to be an expert because he &quot;used to be a doctor for pretends&quot;.
** During the opening of the 2009 &quot;TV Land Awards&quot;, Harris, who hosted the show, travels through &quot;The TV Land Zone&quot; (a spoof of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;), where he finds himself the star of TV classics. At one point, Harris walks into a doctor&#x27;s office, dressed as Doogie, while the &quot;Doogie Howser, M.D.&quot; theme plays. After realizing where he is, he storms out, saying, &quot;No no no, not gonna happen! Check my contract!&quot;
** On the January 10, 2009 episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, an &quot;SNL Digital Short&quot; featured Harris, the episode&#x27;s guest host, leading a full orchestra version of the &quot;Doogie Howser&quot; theme. When the song concludes, he turns toward the camera and sheds a tear.
** On the March 14, 2011 episode of &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, a &quot;real doctor&quot; played by Harris endorses Kimmel&#x27;s Jim-Miracle Diet, as the &quot;Doogie Howser&quot; theme plays.
** Harris in 2017 joined other actors from medical television shows in Cigna&#x27;s &quot;TV Doctors of America&quot; advertising campaign for annual checkups.
* Neil Patrick Harris played Doogie Howser in &quot;The Earth Day Special&quot; in 1990. In the special, Doogie, along with two other doctors (played by Dana Delany and James Brolin), are informed by the &quot;Back to the Future trilogy&quot; scientist Emmett L. Brown (played by Christopher Lloyd) on how to save Mother Nature (played by Bette Midler).
* In Anthony Bourdain&#x27;s book &quot;Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly&quot;, any blond, good-looking waiter working in his restaurant is immediately nicknamed &quot;Doogie Howser&quot;.
* Smart mice obtained by genetic engineering have been named &quot;Doogie mice&quot; in honor of Harris&#x27;s character.

==Real life comparisons==
Balamurali Ambati graduated from the Mount Sinai School of Medicine and obtained his medical license when he was only 17 years old, a Guinness World Record, and has been compared to the fictional Doogie Howser, though Ambati himself disliked the association.

Sho Yano, who became the youngest student to attain an M.D. from the University of Chicago at 21 years old, has also been called a real-life Doogie Howser.

Doogie Howser has been used as a moniker for several people involved in politics. In 2009, 13-year-old author and speaker Jonathan Krohn was nicknamed &quot;Doogie Howser GOP&quot;. 17-year-old Evan Draim, the youngest delegate at the 2012 Republican National Convention, was referred to as a &quot;Doogie Howser of the GOP&quot;. Republican congressman Aaron Schock has been referred to as a Doogie Howser for being the youngest member of Congress in 2009 at 27 years old. In 2015, Jon Stewart called Schock a &quot;Doogie Howser wannabe&quot; for his travel expenses and activities while still in office.

Some teenagers who have impersonated physicians are often referred to as Doogie Howser. Others who have excelled at a young age have been called Doogie Howser.

==Reboot==

In April 2020, it was announced that a reboot titled &quot;Doogie Kameāloha, M.D.&quot;, was in development for Disney+ with Kourtney Kang writing and co-executive producing with Melvin Mar, Jake Kasdan, and Bochco&#x27;s wife, Dayna Bochco and son, Jesse Bochco. The new series focuses on Lahela “Doogie” Kameāloha (Peyton Elizabeth Lee), a female 16-year-old doctor in Hawaii given her nickname by others who have seen &quot;Doogie Howser, M.D.&quot;. Disney+ gave the series a 10-episode straight-to-series order in September 2020.

<text>In arithmetic, Euclidean division – or division with remainder – is the process of dividing one integer (the dividend) by another (the divisor), in a way that produces an integer quotient and a natural number remainder strictly smaller than the absolute value of the divisor. A fundamental property is that the quotient and the remainder exist and are unique, under some conditions. Because of this uniqueness, &quot;Euclidean division&quot; is often considered without referring to any method of computation, and without explicitly computing the quotient and the remainder. The methods of computation are called integer division algorithms, the best known of which being long division.

Euclidean division, and algorithms to compute it, are fundamental for many questions concerning integers, such as the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two integers, and modular arithmetic, for which only remainders are considered. The operation consisting of computing only the remainder is called the &quot;modulo operation&quot;, and is used often in both mathematics and computer science.

==Division theorem==

Euclidean division is based on the following result, which is sometimes called Euclid&#x27;s division lemma.

Given two integers and , with , there exist unique integers and such that 
and 
where denotes the absolute value of .

In the above theorem, each of the four integers has a name of its own: is called the , is called the , is called the and is called the .

The computation of the quotient and the remainder from the dividend and the divisor is called , or in case of ambiguity, . The theorem is frequently referred to as the (although it is a theorem and not an algorithm), because its proof as given below lends itself to a simple division algorithm for computing and (see the section Proof for more).

Division is not defined in the case where ; see division by zero.

For the remainder and the modulo operation, there are conventions other than , see .

=== Generalization ===

Although originally restricted to integers, Euclidean division and the division theorem can be generalized to univariate polynomials over a field and to Euclidean domains. 

In the case of univariate polynomials, the main difference is that the inequalities formula_1 are replaced with
:formula_2 or formula_3
where formula_4 denotes the polynomial degree.

In the generalization to Euclidean domains, the inequality becomes
:formula_2 or formula_6
where formula_7 denote a specific function from the domain to the natural numbers called a &quot;Euclidean function&quot;.

The uniqueness of the quotient and the remainder remains true for polynomials, but it is false in general.

==History==

Although &quot;Euclidean division&quot; is named after Euclid, it seems that he did not know the existence and uniqueness theorem, and that the only computation method that he knew was the division by repeated subtraction.

Before the discovery of Hindu–Arabic numeral system, which was introduced in Europe during the 13th century by Fibonacci, division was extremely difficult, and only the best mathematicians were able to do it. Presently, most division algorithms, including long division, are based on this notation or its variants, such as binary numerals. A notable exception is Newton–Raphson division, which is independent from any numeral system.

The term &quot;Euclidean division&quot; was introduced during the 20th century as a shorthand for &quot;division of Euclidean rings&quot;. It has been rapidly adopted by mathematicians for distinguishing this division from the other kinds of division of numbers.

==Intuitive example==
Suppose that a pie has 9 slices and they are to be divided evenly among 4 people. Using Euclidean division, 9 divided by 4 is 2 with remainder 1. In other words, each person receives 2 slices of pie, and there is 1 slice left over.

This can be confirmed using multiplication, the inverse of division: if each of the 4 people received 2 slices, then 4 × 2 = 8 slices were given out in total. Adding the 1 slice remaining, the result is 9 slices. In summary: 9 = 4 × 2 + 1.

In general, if the number of slices is denoted formula_8 and the number of people is denoted &quot;formula_9&quot;, then one can divide the pie evenly among the people such that each person receives &quot;formula_10&quot; slices (the quotient), with some number of slices formula_11 being the leftover (the remainder). In which case, the equation formula_12 holds.

If 9 slices were divided among 3 people instead of 4, then each would receive 3 and no slice would be left over, which means that the remainder would be zero, leading to the conclusion that 3 &quot;evenly divides&quot; 9, or that 3 &quot;divides&quot; 9.

Euclidean division can also be extended to negative dividend (or negative divisor) using the same formula; for example −9 = 4 × (−3) + 3, which means that −9 divided by 4 is −3 with remainder 3.

== Examples ==

*If &quot;a&quot; = 7 and &quot;b&quot; = 3, then &quot;q&quot; = 2 and &quot;r&quot; = 1, since 7 = 3 × 2 + 1.
*If &quot;a&quot; = 7 and &quot;b&quot; = −3, then &quot;q&quot; = −2 and &quot;r&quot; = 1, since 7 = −3 × (−2) + 1.
*If &quot;a&quot; = −7 and &quot;b&quot; = 3, then &quot;q&quot; = −3 and &quot;r&quot; = 2, since −7 = 3 × (−3) + 2.
*If &quot;a&quot; = −7 and &quot;b&quot; = −3, then &quot;q&quot; = 3 and &quot;r&quot; = 2, since −7 = −3 × 3 + 2.

==Proof==
The following proof of the division theorem relies on the fact that a decreasing sequence of non-negative integers stops eventually. It is separated into two parts: one for existence and another for uniqueness of &quot;formula_10&quot; and &quot;formula_14&quot;. Other proofs use the well-ordering principle (i.e., the assertion that every non-empty set of non-negative integers has a smallest element) to make the reasoning simpler, but have the disadvantage of not providing directly an algorithm for solving the division (see for more).

===Existence===

For proving the existence of Euclidean division, one can suppose formula_15 since, if formula_16 the equality formula_17 can be rewritten formula_18 So, if the latter equality is a Euclidean division with formula_19 the former is also a Euclidean division.

Given formula_20 and formula_21 there are integers formula_22 and formula_23 such that formula_24 for example, formula_25 and formula_26 if formula_27 and otherwise formula_28 and formula_29

Let formula_10 and formula_14 be such a pair of numbers for which formula_14 is nonnegative and minimal. If formula_33 we have Euclidean division. Thus, we have to prove that, if formula_34 then formula_14 is not minimal. Indeed, if formula_34 one has formula_37 with formula_38 and formula_14 is not minimal

This proves the existence in all cases. This provides also an algorithm for computing the quotient and the remainder, by starting from formula_40 (if formula_41) and adding formula_42 to it until formula_43 However, this algorithm is not efficient, since its number of steps is of the order of formula_44

===Uniqueness===
The pair of integers and such that is unique, in the sense that there can be no other pair of integers that satisfy the same condition in the Euclidean division theorem. In other words, if we have another division of by , say with , then we must have that

To prove this statement, we first start with the assumptions that
: 
: 

Subtracting the two equations yields
So is a divisor of . As 

by the above inequalities, one gets 
and 

Since , we get that and , which proves the uniqueness part of the Euclidean division theorem.

== Effectiveness ==
In general, an existence proof does not provide an algorithm for computing the existing quotient and remainder, but the above proof does immediately provide an algorithm (see Division algorithm#Division by repeated subtraction), even though it is not a very efficient one as it requires as many steps as the size of the quotient. This is related to the fact that it uses only additions, subtractions and comparisons of integers, without involving multiplication, nor any particular representation of the integers such as decimal notation.

In terms of decimal notation, long division provides a much more efficient algorithm for solving Euclidean divisions. Its generalization to binary and hexadecimal notation provides further flexibility and possibility for computer implementation. However, for large inputs, algorithms that reduce division to multiplication, such as Newton–Raphson, are usually preferred, because they only need a time which is proportional to the time of the multiplication needed to verify the result—independently of the multiplication algorithm which is used (for more, see Division algorithm#Fast division methods).

== Variants ==

The Euclidean division admits a number of variants, some of which are listed below.

=== Other intervals for the remainder ===

In Euclidean division with as divisor, the remainder is supposed to belong to the interval of length . Any other interval of the same length may be used. More precisely, given integers formula_45, formula_8, formula_47 with formula_48, there exist unique integers formula_10 and formula_14 with formula_51 such that formula_52.

In particular, if formula_53 then formula_54 . This division is called the &quot;centered division&quot;, and its remainder formula_14 is called the &quot;centered remainder&quot; or the least absolute remainder&quot;.

This is used for approximating real numbers: Euclidean division defines truncation, and centered division defines rounding.

=== Montgomery division ===

Given integers formula_8, formula_45 and formula_58 with formula_59 and formula_60 let formula_61 be the modular multiplicative inverse of formula_62 (i.e., formula_63 with formula_64 being a multiple of formula_45), then there exist unique integers formula_10 and formula_14 with formula_68 such that formula_69.
This result generalizes Hensel&#x27;s odd division (1900).

The value formula_14 is the -residue defined in Montgomery reduction.

==In Euclidean domains==

Euclidean domains (also known as Euclidean rings) are defined as integral domains which support the following generalization of Euclidean division:

:Given an element and a non-zero element in a Euclidean domain equipped with a Euclidean function (also known as a Euclidean valuation or degree function), there exist and in such that and either or . 

Uniqueness of and is not required. It occurs only in exceptional cases, typically for univariate polynomials, and for integers, if the further condition is added.

Examples of Euclidean domains include fields, polynomial rings in one variable over a field, and the Gaussian integers. The Euclidean division of polynomials has been the object of specific developments.

<text>Synthetic crude is the output from a bitumen/extra heavy oil upgrader facility used in connection with oil sand production. It may also refer to shale oil, an output from an oil shale pyrolysis. The properties of the synthetic crude depend on the processes used in the upgrading. Typically, it is low in sulfur and has an API gravity of around 30. It is also known as &quot;upgraded crude&quot;.

Synthetic crude is an intermediate product produced when an extra-heavy or unconventional oil source is upgraded into a transportable form. Synthetic crude is then shipped to oil refineries where it is refined into finished products. Synthetic crude may also be mixed, as a diluent, with heavy oil to create synbit. Synbit is more viscous than synthetic crude, but can also be a less expensive alternative for transporting heavy oil to a conventional refinery.

Syncrude Canada, Suncor Energy Inc., and Canadian Natural Resources Limited are the three largest worldwide producers of synthetic crude with a cumulative production of approximately . The NewGrade Energy Upgrader became operational in 1988, and was the first upgrader in Canada, now part of the CCRL Refinery Complex. 

&quot;Synthetic crude&quot; may also refer to crude-like hydrocarbon mixes generated from other processes. Examples are manure-derived synthetic crude oil and greencrude.

<text>During the Napoleonic Wars until 1810, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland were allies in the war against Napoleon. As a result of Sweden&#x27;s defeat in the Finnish War and the Pomeranian War, and the following Treaty of Fredrikshamn and Treaty of Paris, Sweden declared war on the UK. The bloodless war, however, existed only on paper, and the UK was still not hindered in stationing ships at the Swedish island of Hanö and trade with the Baltic states.

==Background==
The Treaty of Paris, concluded on 6 January 1810, forced Sweden to join the Continental System, a trade embargo against the UK. Since the UK was Sweden&#x27;s biggest trade partner this caused economic difficulties, and trade continued to take place through smuggling. On 13 November that year, France delivered an ultimatum to the Swedish government demanding that within five days Sweden:
* Declare war against the UK,
* Confiscate all UK ships in Swedish ports,
* Seize all UK products in Sweden.

France and its allies threatened to declare war against Sweden if it did not meet the French demands. On 17 November the same year, the Swedish government declared war against the UK.

==War==
No acts of war occurred during the conflict and the UK was even allowed to station boats in Hanö, thus &quot;occupying&quot; the island. Sweden did not try to hinder this as the UK used the island to continue trading with Sweden.

==Aftermath==
The elected crown prince of Sweden, Danish Prince Charles August, had died on 28 May 1810, and on 21 August 1810, the French Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte was elected crown prince of Sweden. Although Bernadotte was only the crown prince and technically subservient to King Charles XIII, the king&#x27;s deteriorating health and uninterest made the crown prince the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of Sweden. Under Bernadotte&#x27;s rule, Sweden&#x27;s relationship with Napoleonic France deteriorated. When France occupied Swedish Pomerania and the island of Rügen in 1812, Sweden sought peace with the UK.

After long negotiations, the Treaty of Örebro was signed on 18 July 1812. On the same day and at the same place, the UK and Russia signed a peace treaty to end the Anglo–Russian War (1807–1812).

<doc id="680000" wikidata="Q1030042" url="?curid=680000" title="RS-25">
<text>The RS-25, also known as the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME), is a liquid-fuel cryogenic rocket engine that was used on NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle and is used on the Space Launch System.

Designed and manufactured in the United States by Rocketdyne (later Pratt &amp; Whitney Rocketdyne and Aerojet Rocketdyne), the RS-25 burns cryogenic (very low temperature) liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants, with each engine producing thrust at liftoff. Although RS-25 heritage traces back to the 1960s, its concerted development began in the 1970s with the first flight, STS-1, on April 12, 1981. The RS-25 has undergone upgrades over its operational history to improve the engine&#x27;s thrust, reliability, safety, and maintenance load.

The engine produces a specific impulse (&quot;I&quot;sp) of 452 seconds (4.43 kN-sec/kg) in vacuum, or 366 seconds (3.59 kN-sec/kg) at sea level, has a mass of approximately , and is capable of throttling between 67% and 109% of its rated power level in one-percent increments. Components of the RS-25 operate at temperatures ranging from .

The Space Shuttle used a cluster of three RS-25 engines mounted at the stern of the orbiter, with fuel drawn from the external tank. The engines were used for propulsion throughout the spacecraft ascent, with total thrust increased by two solid rocket boosters and the orbiter&#x27;s two AJ10 orbital maneuvering system engines. Following each flight, the RS-25 engines were removed from the orbiter, inspected, refurbished, and then reused on another mission.

Four RS-25 engines are installed on each Space Launch System, housed in the engine section at the base of the core stage, and expended after use. The first four Space Launch System flights use modernized and refurbished engines built for the Space Shuttle program. Subsequent flights will make use of a simplified RS-25E engine called the Production Restart, which is under testing and development.

== Components ==
The RS-25 engine consists of pumps, valves, and other components working in concert to produce thrust. Fuel (liquid hydrogen) and oxidizer (liquid oxygen) from the Space Shuttle&#x27;s external tank entered the orbiter at the umbilical disconnect valves and from there flowed through the orbiter&#x27;s main propulsion system (MPS) feed lines; whereas in the Space Launch System (SLS), fuel and oxidizer from the rocket&#x27;s core stage flow directly into the MPS lines. Once in the MPS lines, the fuel and oxidizer each branch out into separate paths to each engine (three on the Space Shuttle, four on the SLS). In each branch, pre-valves then allow the propellants to enter the engine.

Once in the engine, the propellants flow through low-pressure fuel and oxidizer turbopumps (LPFTP and LPOTP), and from there into high-pressure turbopumps (HPFTP and HPOTP). From these HPTPs the propellants take different routes through the engine. The oxidizer is split into four separate paths: to the oxidizer heat exchanger, which then splits into the oxidizer tank pressurization and pogo suppression systems; to the low-pressure oxidizer turbopump (LPOTP); to the high-pressure oxidizer pre-burner, from which it is split into the HPFTP turbine and HPOTP before being reunited in the hot gas manifold and sent on to the main combustion chamber (MCC); or directly into the main combustion chamber (MCC) injectors.

Meanwhile, fuel flows through the main fuel valve into regenerative cooling systems for the nozzle and MCC, or through the chamber coolant valve. The fuel passing through the MCC cooling system then passes back through the LPFTP turbine before being routed either to the fuel tank pressurization system or to the hot gas manifold cooling system (from where it passes into the MCC). Fuel in the nozzle cooling and chamber coolant valve systems is then sent via pre-burners into the HPFTP turbine and HPOTP before being reunited again in the hot gas manifold, from where it passes into the MCC injectors. Once in the injectors, the propellants are mixed and injected into the main combustion chamber where they are ignited. The ejection of the burning propellant mixture through the throat and bell of the engine&#x27;s nozzle creates the thrust.

===Turbopumps===

====Oxidizer system====
The low-pressure oxidizer turbopump (LPOTP) is an axial-flow pump which operates at approximately 5,150 rpm driven by a six-stage turbine powered by high-pressure liquid oxygen from the high-pressure oxidizer turbopump (HPOTP). It boosts the liquid oxygen&#x27;s pressure from , with the flow from the LPOTP then being supplied to the HPOTP. During engine operation, the pressure boost permits the high-pressure oxidizer pump to operate at high speeds without cavitating. The LPOTP, which measures approximately , is connected to the vehicle propellant ducting and supported in a fixed position by being mounted on the launch vehicle&#x27;s structure.

Then, mounted before the HPOTP, is the pogo oscillation suppression system accumulator. For use, it is pre-and post-charged with and charged with gaseous from the heat exchanger, and, not having any membrane, it operates by continuously recirculating the charge gas. A number of baffles of various types are present inside the accumulator to control sloshing and turbulence, which is useful of itself and also to prevent the escape of gas into the low-pressure oxidizer duct to be ingested in the HPOTP.

The HPOTP consists of two single-stage centrifugal pumps (the main pump and a pre-burner pump) mounted on a common shaft and driven by a two-stage, hot-gas turbine. The main pump boosts the liquid oxygen&#x27;s pressure from while operating at approximately 28,120 rpm, giving a power output of . The HPOTP discharge flow splits into several paths, one of which drives the LPOTP turbine. Another path is to, and through, the main oxidizer valve and enters the main combustion chamber. Another small flow path is tapped off and sent to the oxidizer heat exchanger. The liquid oxygen flows through an anti-flood valve that prevents it from entering the heat exchanger until sufficient heat is present for the heat exchanger to utilize the heat contained in the gases discharged from the HPOTP turbine, converting the liquid oxygen to gas. The gas is sent to a manifold and then routed to pressurize the liquid oxygen tank. Another path enters the HPOTP second-stage pre-burner pump to boost the liquid oxygen&#x27;s pressure from 30 to 51 MPa (4,300 psia to 7,400 psia). It passes through the oxidizer pre-burner oxidizer valve into the oxidizer pre-burner and through the fuel pre-burner oxidizer valve into the fuel pre-burner. The HPOTP measures approximately . It is attached by flanges to the hot-gas manifold.

The HPOTP turbine and HPOTP pumps are mounted on a common shaft. Mixing of the fuel-rich hot gases in the turbine section and the liquid oxygen in the main pump can create a hazard and, to prevent this, the two sections are separated by a cavity that is continuously purged by the engine&#x27;s helium supply during engine operation. Two seals minimize leakage into the cavity; one seal is located between the turbine section and the cavity, while the other is between the pump section and cavity. Loss of helium pressure in this cavity results in automatic engine shutdown.

====Fuel system====
The low-pressure fuel turbopump (LPFTP) is an axial-flow pump driven by a two-stage turbine powered by gaseous hydrogen. It boosts the pressure of the liquid hydrogen from 30 to 276 psia (0.2 to 1.9 MPa) and supplies it to the high-pressure fuel turbopump (HPFTP). During engine operation, the pressure boost provided by the LPFTP permits the HPFTP to operate at high speeds without cavitating. The LPFTP operates at around 16,185 rpm, and is approximately in size. It is connected to the vehicle propellant ducting and is supported in a fixed position by being mounted to the launch vehicle&#x27;s structure.

The HPFTP is a three-stage centrifugal pump driven by a two-stage hot-gas turbine. It boosts the pressure of the liquid hydrogen from 1.9 to 45 MPa (276 to 6,515 psia), and operates at approximately 35,360 rpm with a power of . The discharge flow from the turbopump is routed to, and through, the main valve and is then split into three flow paths. One path is through the jacket of the main combustion chamber, where the hydrogen is used to cool the chamber walls. It is then routed from the main combustion chamber to the LPFTP, where it is used to drive the LPFTP turbine. A small portion of the flow from the LPFTP is then directed to a common manifold from all three engines to form a single path to the liquid hydrogen tank to maintain pressurization. The remaining hydrogen passes between the inner and outer walls of the hot-gas manifold to cool it and is then discharged into the main combustion chamber. A second hydrogen flow path from the main fuel valve is through the engine nozzle (to cool the nozzle). It then joins the third flow path from the chamber coolant valve. This combined flow is then directed to the fuel and oxidizer pre-burners. The HPFTP is approximately in size and is attached to the hot-gas manifold by flanges.

===Powerhead===
====Preburners====

The oxidizer and fuel pre-burners are welded to the hot-gas manifold. The fuel and oxidizer enter the pre-burners and are mixed so that efficient combustion can occur. The augmented spark igniter is a small combination chamber located in the center of the injector of each pre-burner. Two dual-redundant spark igniters are activated by the engine controller and are used during the engine start sequence to initiate combustion in each pre-burner. They are turned off after approximately three seconds because the combustion process is then self-sustaining. The pre-burners produce the fuel-rich hot gases that pass through the turbines to generate the power needed to operate the high-pressure turbopumps. The oxidizer pre-burner&#x27;s outflow drives a turbine that is connected to the HPOTP and to the oxidizer pre-burner pump. The fuel pre-burner&#x27;s outflow drives a turbine that is connected to the HPFTP.

The speed of the HPOTP and HPFTP turbines depends on the position of the corresponding oxidizer and fuel pre-burner oxidizer valves. These valves are positioned by the engine controller, which uses them to throttle the flow of liquid oxygen to the pre-burners and, thus, control engine thrust. The oxidizer and fuel pre-burner oxidizer valves increase or decrease the liquid oxygen flow, thus increasing or decreasing pre-burner chamber pressure, HPOTP and HPFTP turbine speed, and liquid oxygen and gaseous hydrogen flow into the main combustion chamber, which increases or decreases engine thrust. The oxidizer and fuel pre-burner valves operate together to throttle the engine and maintain a constant 6.03:1 propellant mixture ratio.

The main oxidizer and main fuel valves control the flow of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen into the engine and are controlled by each engine controller. When an engine is operating, the main valves are fully open.

====Main combustion chamber====
The engine&#x27;s main combustion chamber (MCC) receives fuel-rich hot gas from a hot-gas manifold cooling circuit. The gaseous hydrogen and liquid oxygen enter the chamber at the injector, which mixes the propellants. The mixture is ignited by the &quot;Augmented Spark Igniter&quot;, an H/O flame at the center of the injector head. The main injector and dome assembly are welded to the hot-gas manifold, and the MCC is also bolted to the hot-gas manifold. The MCC comprises a structural shell made of Inconel 718 which is lined with a copper-silver-zirconium alloy called NARloy-Z, developed specifically for the RS-25 in the 1970s. Around 390 channels are machined into the liner wall to carry liquid hydrogen through the liner to provide MCC cooling, as the temperature in the combustion chamber reaches 3300 °C (6000 °F) during flight – higher than the boiling point of iron.

An alternative for the construction of RS-25 engines to be used in SLS missions is the use of advanced structural ceramics, such as thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) and ceramic-matrix composites (CMCs). These materials possess significantly lower thermal conductivities than metallic alloys, thus allowing more efficient combustion and reducing the cooling requirements. TBCs are thin ceramic oxide layers deposited on metallic components, acting as a thermal barrier between hot gaseous combustion products and the metallic shell. A TBC applied to the Inconel 718 shell during production could extend engine life and reduce cooling costs. Further, CMCs have been studied as a replacement for Ni-based superalloys and are composed of high-strength fibers (BN, C) continuously dispersed in a SiC matrix. An MCC composed of a CMC, though less studied and farther from fruition than the application of a TBC, could offer unprecedented levels of engine efficiency.

===Nozzle===
The engine&#x27;s nozzle is long with a diameter of at its throat and at its exit. The nozzle is a bell-shaped extension bolted to the main combustion chamber, referred to as a de Laval nozzle. The RS-25 nozzle has an unusually large expansion ratio (about 69:1) for the chamber pressure. At sea level, a nozzle of this ratio would normally undergo flow separation of the jet from the nozzle, which would cause control difficulties and could even mechanically damage the vehicle. However, to aid the engine&#x27;s operation Rocketdyne engineers varied the angle of the nozzle walls from the theoretical optimum for thrust, reducing it near the exit. This raises the pressure just around the rim to an absolute pressure between , and prevents flow separation. The inner part of the flow is at much lower pressure, around or less. The inner surface of each nozzle is cooled by liquid hydrogen flowing through brazed stainless steel tube wall coolant passages. On the Space Shuttle, a support ring welded to the forward end of the nozzle is the engine attach point to the orbiter-supplied heat shield. Thermal protection is necessary because of the exposure portions of the nozzles experience during the launch, ascent, on-orbit and entry phases of a mission. The insulation consists of four layers of metallic batting covered with a metallic foil and screening.

===Controller===
Each engine is equipped with a main engine controller (MEC), an integrated computer which controls all of the engine&#x27;s functions (through the use of valves) and monitors its performance. Built by Honeywell Aerospace, each MEC originally comprised two redundant Honeywell HDC-601 computers, later upgraded to a system composed of two doubly redundant Motorola 68000 (M68000) processors (for a total of four M68000s per controller). Having the controller installed on the engine itself greatly simplifies the wiring between the engine and the launch vehicle, because all the sensors and actuators are connected directly to only the controller, each MEC then being connected to the orbiter&#x27;s general purpose computers (GPCs) or the SLS&#x27;s avionics suite via its own engine interface unit (EIU). Using a dedicated system also simplifies the software and thus improves its reliability.

Two independent dual-CPU computers, A and B, form the controller; giving redundancy to the system. The failure of controller system A automatically leads to a switch-over to controller system B without impeding operational capabilities; the subsequent failure of controller system B would provide a graceful shutdown of the engine. Within each system (A and B), the two M68000s operate in lock-step, thereby enabling each system to detect failures by comparing the signal levels on the buses of the two M68000 processors within that system. If differences are encountered between the two buses, then an interrupt is generated and control turned over to the other system. Because of subtle differences between M68000s from Motorola and the second source manufacturer TRW, each system uses M68000s from the same manufacturer (for instance system A would have two Motorola CPUs while system B would have two CPUs manufactured by TRW). Memory for block I controllers was of the plated-wire type, which functions in a manner similar to magnetic core memory and retains data even after power is turned off. Block II controllers used conventional CMOS static RAM.

The controllers were designed to be tough enough to survive the forces of launch and proved to be extremely resilient to damage. During the investigation of the &quot;Challenger&quot; accident the two MECs (from engines 2020 and 2021), recovered from the seafloor, were delivered to Honeywell Aerospace for examination and analysis. One controller was broken open on one side, and both were severely corroded and damaged by marine life. Both units were disassembled and the memory units flushed with deionized water. After they were dried and vacuum baked, data from these units was retrieved for forensic examination.

====Main valves====
To control the engine&#x27;s output, the MEC operates five hydraulically actuated propellant valves on each engine; the oxidizer pre-burner oxidizer, fuel pre-burner oxidizer, main oxidizer, main fuel, and chamber coolant valves. In an emergency, the valves can be fully closed by using the engine&#x27;s helium supply system as a backup actuation system.

In the Space Shuttle, the main oxidizer and fuel bleed valves were used after shutdown to dump any residual propellant, with residual liquid oxygen venting through the engine and residual liquid hydrogen venting through the liquid hydrogen fill and drain valves. After the dump was completed, the valves closed and remained closed for the remainder of the mission.

A coolant control valve is mounted on the combustion chamber coolant bypass duct of each engine. The engine controller regulates the amount of gaseous hydrogen allowed to bypass the nozzle coolant loop, thus controlling its temperature. The chamber coolant valve is 100% open before the engine start. During engine operation, it is 100% open for throttle settings of 100 to 109%. For throttle settings between 65 and 100%, its position ranged from 66.4 to 100%.

===Gimbal===

Each engine is installed with a gimbal bearing, a universal ball and socket joint which is bolted to the launch vehicle by its upper flange and to the engine by its lower flange. It represents the thrust interface between the engine and the launch vehicle, supporting of engine weight and withstanding over of thrust. As well as providing a means to attach the engine to the launch vehicle, the gimbal bearing allows the engine to be pivoted (or &quot;gimballed&quot;) around two axes of freedom with a range of ±10.5°. This motion allows the engine&#x27;s thrust vector to be altered, thus steering the vehicle into the correct orientation. The comparatively large gimbal range is necessary to correct for the pitch momentum that occurs due to the constantly shifting center of mass as the vehicle burns fuel in flight and after booster separation. The bearing assembly is approximately , has a mass of , and is made of titanium alloy.

The low-pressure oxygen and low-pressure fuel turbopumps were mounted 180° apart on the orbiter&#x27;s aft fuselage thrust structure. The lines from the low-pressure turbopumps to the high-pressure turbopumps contain flexible bellows that enable the low-pressure turbopumps to remain stationary while the rest of the engine is gimbaled for thrust vector control, and also to prevent damage to the pumps when loads were applied to them. The liquid-hydrogen line from the LPFTP to the HPFTP is insulated to prevent the formation of liquid air.

===Helium system===
In addition to fuel and oxidizer systems, the launch vehicle&#x27;s main propulsion system is also equipped with a helium system consisting of ten storage tanks in addition to various regulators, check valves, distribution lines, and control valves. The system is used in-flight to purge the engine and provides pressure for actuating engine valves within the propellant management system and during emergency shutdowns. During entry, on the Space Shuttle, any remaining helium was used to purge the engines during reentry and for repressurization.

==History==

===Development===
The history of the RS-25 traces back to the 1960s when NASA&#x27;s Marshall Space Flight Center and Rocketdyne were conducting a series of studies on high-pressure engines, developed from the successful J-2 engine used on the S-II and S-IVB upper stages of the Saturn V rocket during the Apollo program. The studies were conducted under a program to upgrade the Saturn V engines, which produced a design for a upper-stage engine known as the HG-3. As funding levels for Apollo wound down the HG-3 was cancelled as well as the upgraded F-1 engines already being tested. It was the design for the HG-3 that would form the basis for the RS-25.

Meanwhile, in 1967, the US Air Force funded a study into advanced rocket propulsion systems for use during Project Isinglass, with Rocketdyne asked to investigate aerospike engines and Pratt &amp; Whitney (P&amp;W) to research more efficient conventional de Laval nozzle-type engines. At the conclusion of the study, P&amp;W put forward a proposal for a 250,000 lbf engine called the XLR-129, which used a two-position expanding nozzle to provide increased efficiency over a wide range of altitudes.

In January 1969 NASA awarded contracts to General Dynamics, Lockheed, McDonnell Douglas, and North American Rockwell to initiate the early development of the Space Shuttle. As part of these &#x27;Phase A&#x27; studies, the involved companies selected an upgraded version of the XLR-129, developing , as the baseline engine for their designs. This design can be found on many of the planned Shuttle versions right up to the final decision. However, since NASA was interested in pushing the state of the art in every way they decided to select a much more advanced design in order to &quot;force an advancement of rocket engine technology&quot;. They called for a new design based on a high-pressure combustion chamber running around , which increases the performance of the engine.

Development began in 1970, when NASA released a request for proposal for &#x27;Phase B&#x27; main engine concept studies, requiring development of a throttleable, staged combustion, de Laval-type engine. The request was based on the then-current design of the Space Shuttle which featured two reusable stages, the orbiter and a crewed fly-back booster, and required one engine which would be able to power both vehicles via two different nozzles (12 booster engines with sea level thrust each and 3 orbiter engines with vacuum thrust each). Rocketdyne, P&amp;W and Aerojet General were selected to receive funding although, given P&amp;W&#x27;s already-advanced development (demonstrating a working concept engine during the year) and Aerojet General&#x27;s prior experience in developing the M-1 engine, Rocketdyne was forced to put a large amount of private money into the design process to allow the company to catch up to its competitors.

By the time the contract was awarded, budgetary pressures meant that the shuttle&#x27;s design had changed to its final orbiter, external tank, and two boosters configuration, and so the engine was only required to power the orbiter during ascent. During the year-long &#x27;Phase B&#x27; study period, Rocketdyne was able to make use of their experience developing the HG-3 engine to design their SSME proposal, producing a prototype by January 1971. The engine made use of a new Rocketdyne-developed copper-zirconium alloy (called NARloy-Z) and was tested on February 12, 1971, producing a chamber pressure of . The three participating companies submitted their engine development bids in April 1971, with Rocketdyne being awarded the contract on July 13, 1971—although work did not begin on engine development until March 31, 1972, due to a legal challenge from P&amp;W.

Following the awarding of the contract, a preliminary design review was carried out in September 1972, followed by a critical design review in September 1976 after which the engine&#x27;s design was set and construction of the first set of flight-capable engines began. A final review of all the Space Shuttle&#x27;s components, including the engines, was conducted in 1979. The design reviews operated in parallel with several test milestones, initial tests consisting of individual engine components which identified shortcomings with various areas of the design, including the HPFTP, HPOTP, valves, nozzle, and fuel pre-burners. The individual engine component tests were followed by the first test of a complete engine (0002) on March 16, 1977, after its final assembly line was established in the main Rocketdyne factory in Canoga Park, Los Angeles. NASA specified that, prior to the Shuttle&#x27;s first flight, the engines must have undergone at least 65,000 seconds of testing, a milestone that was reached on March 23, 1980, with the engine having undergone 110,253 seconds of testing by the time of STS-1 both on test stands at Stennis Space Center and installed on the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA). The first set of engines (2005, 2006 and 2007) was delivered to Kennedy Space Center in 1979 and installed on , before being removed in 1980 for further testing and reinstalled on the orbiter. The engines, which were of the first manned orbital flight (FMOF) configuration and certified for operation at 100% rated power level (RPL), were operated in a twenty-second flight readiness firing on February 20, 1981, and, after inspection, declared ready for flight.

===Space Shuttle program===


Each Space Shuttle had three RS-25 engines, installed in the aft structure of the Space Shuttle orbiter in the Orbiter Processing Facility prior to the orbiter being transferred to the Vehicle Assembly Building. If necessary the engines could be changed on the pad. The engines, drawing propellant from the Space Shuttle external tank (ET) via the orbiter&#x27;s main propulsion system (MPS), were ignited at T−6.6 seconds prior to liftoff (with each ignition staggered by 120 ms), which allowed their performance to be checked prior to ignition of the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), which committed the shuttle to the launch. At launch, the engines would be operating at 100% RPL, throttling up to 104.5% immediately following liftoff. The engines would maintain this power level until around T+40 seconds, where they would be throttled back to around 70% to reduce aerodynamic loads on the shuttle stack as it passed through the region of maximum dynamic pressure, or max. &quot;q&quot;. The engines would then be throttled back up until around T+8 minutes, at which point they would be gradually throttled back down to 67% to prevent the stack exceeding 3 g of acceleration as it became progressively lighter due to propellant consumption. The engines were then shut down, a procedure known as main engine cutoff (MECO), at around T+8.5 minutes.

After each flight the engines would be removed from the orbiter and transferred to the Space Shuttle Main Engine Processing Facility (SSMEPF), where they would be inspected and refurbished in preparation for reuse on a subsequent flight. A total of 46 reusable RS-25 engines, each costing around US$40 million, were flown during the Space Shuttle program, with each new or overhauled engine entering the flight inventory requiring flight qualification on one of the test stands at Stennis Space Center prior to flight.

====Upgrades====
Over the course of the Space Shuttle program, the RS-25 went through a series of upgrades, including combustion chamber changes, improved welds and turbopump changes in an effort to improve the engine&#x27;s performance and reliability and so reduce the amount of maintenance required after use. As a result, several versions of the RS-25 were used during the program:
*FMOF (first manned orbital flight): Certified for 100% rated power level (RPL). Used for the orbital flight test missions STS-1 – STS-5 (engines 2005, 2006 and 2007).
*Phase I: Used for missions STS-6 – STS-51-L, the Phase I engine offered increased service life and was certified for 104% RPL. Replaced by Phase II after the Challenger Disaster.
*Phase II (RS-25A): First flown on STS-26, the Phase II engine offered a number of safety upgrades and was certified for 104% RPL &amp; 109% full power level (FPL) in the event of a contingency.
*Block I (RS-25B): First flown on STS-70, the Block I engines offered improved turbopumps featuring ceramic bearings, half as many rotating parts, and a new casting process reducing the number of welds. Block I improvements also included a new, two-duct powerhead (rather than the original design, which featured three ducts connected to the HPFTP and two to the HPOTP), which helped improve hot gas flow, and an improved engine heat exchanger.
*Block IA (RS-25B): First flown on STS-73, the Block IA engine offered main injector improvements.
*Block IIA (RS-25C): First flown on STS-89, the Block IIA engine was an interim model used whilst certain components of the Block II engine completed development. Changes included a new large throat main combustion chamber (which had originally been recommended by Rocketdyne in 1980), improved low-pressure turbopumps, and certification for 104.5% RPL to compensate for a reduction in specific impulse (original plans called for the engine to be certified to 106% for heavy International Space Station payloads, but this was not required and would have reduced engine service life). A slightly modified version first flew on STS-96.
*Block II (RS-25D): First flown on STS-104, the Block II upgrade included all of the Block IIA improvements plus a new high-pressure fuel turbopump. This model was ground-tested to 111% FPL in the event of a contingency abort, and certified for 109% FPL for use during an intact abort.
*RS-25E: It will be used on the Space Launch System for future Artemis program missions beginning with Artemis V, as the RS-25D stock is intentionally being used up. Unlike previous versions, this engine is designed to be expendable. The powerhead is almost completely redesigned ( the specific design changes from the -25D have not been announced), and intended to incorporate various cost-saving measures and innovations in manufacturing. The first testing engine, E10001, passed all its qualifications and tests at NASA&#x27;s Stennis Space Center, and demonstrated both a 113% FPL and a 30% increase in thrust.

====Engine throttle/output====
The most obvious effects of the upgrades the RS-25 received through the Space Shuttle program were the improvements in engine throttle. Whilst the FMOF engine had a maximum output of 100% RPL, Block II engines could throttle as high as 109% or 111% in an emergency, with usual flight performance being 104.5%. Existing engines used on the Space Launch System are throttled to 109% power during normal flight, while new RS-25 engines produced for the Space Launch System are to be run at 111% throttle, with 113% power being tested. These increases in throttle level made a significant difference to the thrust produced by the engine:

Specifying power levels over 100% may seem nonsensical, but there was a logic behind it. The 100% level does not mean the maximum physical power level attainable, rather it was a specification decided on during engine development—the expected rated power level. When later studies indicated the engine could operate safely at levels above 100%, these higher levels became standard. Maintaining the original relationship of power level to physical thrust helped reduce confusion, as it created an unvarying fixed relationship so that test data (or operational data from past or future missions) can be easily compared. If the power level was increased, and that new value was said to be 100%, then all previous data and documentation would either require changing or cross-checking against what physical thrust corresponded to 100% power level on that date. Engine power level affects engine reliability, with studies indicating the probability of an engine failure increasing rapidly with power levels over 104.5%, which was why power levels above 104.5% were retained for contingency use only.

====Incidents====

During the course of the Space Shuttle program, a total of 46 RS-25 engines were used (with one extra RS-25D being built but never used). During the 135 missions, for a total of 405 individual engine-missions, Pratt &amp; Whitney Rocketdyne reports a 99.95% reliability rate, with the only in-flight SSME failure occurring during &#x27;s STS-51-F mission. The engines, however, did suffer from a number of pad failures (redundant set launch sequencer aborts, or RSLSs) and other issues during the course of the program:
*STS-41-D – No. 3 engine caused an RSLS shutdown at T−4 seconds due to loss of redundant control on main engine valve, stack rolled back and engine replaced.
*STS-51-F – No. 2 engine caused an RSLS shutdown at T−3 seconds due to a coolant valve malfunction.
*STS-51-F – No. 1 engine (2023) shutdown at T+5:43 due to faulty temperature sensors, leading to an abort to orbit (although the mission objectives and length were not compromised by the ATO).
*STS-55 – No. 3 engine caused an RSLS shutdown at T−3 seconds due to a leak in its liquid-oxygen preburner check valve.
*STS-51 – No. 2 engine caused an RSLS shut down at T−3 seconds due to a faulty hydrogen fuel sensor.
*STS-68 – No. 3 engine (2032) caused an RSLS shutdown at T−1.9 seconds when a temperature sensor in its HPOTP exceeded its redline.
*STS-93 – An Orbiter Project AC1 Phase A electrical wiring short occurred at T+5 seconds causing an under voltage which disqualified SSME1A and SSME3B controllers but required no engine shut down. In addition, a 0.1-inch diameter, 1-inch long gold-plated pin, used to plug an oxidizer post orifice (an inappropriate SSME corrective action eliminated from the fleet by redesign) came loose inside an engine&#x27;s main injector and impacted the engine nozzle inner surface, rupturing three hydrogen cooling lines. The resulting three breaches caused a leak resulting in a premature engine shutdown, when four external tank LO sensors flashed dry resulting in low-level cutoff of the main engines and a slightly early main engine cut-off with a underspeed, and an 8 nautical mile lower altitude.

=== Constellation ===
During the period preceding final Space Shuttle retirement, various plans for the remaining engines were proposed, ranging from them all being kept by NASA, to them all being given away (or sold for US$400,000–800,000 each) to various institutions such as museums and universities. This policy followed changes to the planned configurations of the Constellation program&#x27;s Ares V cargo-launch vehicle and Ares I crew-launch vehicle rockets, which had been planned to use the RS-25 in their first and second stages respectively. While these configurations had initially seemed worthwhile, as they would use then-current technology following the shuttle&#x27;s retirement in 2010, the plan had several drawbacks:
*The engines would not be reusable, as they would be permanently attached to the discarded stages.
*Each engine would have to undergo a test firing prior to installation and launch, with refurbishment required following the test.
*It would be expensive, time-consuming, and weight-intensive to convert the ground-started RS-25D to an air-started version for the Ares I second stage.

Following several design changes to the Ares I and Ares V rockets, the RS-25 was to be replaced with a single J-2X engine for the Ares I second stage and six modified RS-68 engines (which was based on both the SSME and Apollo-era J-2 engine) on the Ares V core stage; this meant that the RS-25 would be retired along with the Shuttle fleet. In 2010, however, NASA was directed to halt the Constellation program, and with it development of the Ares I and Ares V, instead of focusing on building a new heavy-lift launcher.

=== Space Launch System ===

On 14 September 2011, following the retirement of the Space Shuttle, NASA announced that it would be developing a new launch vehicle, known as the Space Launch System (SLS), to replace the shuttle fleet. The design for the SLS features the RS-25 as part of its core stage, with different versions of the rocket being equipped with between three and five engines. The initial flights of the new launch vehicle are making use of previously flown Block II RS-25D engines, with NASA keeping such engines in a &quot;purged safe&quot; environment at Stennis Space Center, &quot;along with all of the ground systems required to maintain them.&quot; For Artemis I, the RS-25D units with serial numbers E2045, E2056, E2058, and E2060 from all three orbiters were used. They were installed on the core stage by November 6, 2019. For Artemis II, the units with serial numbers E2047, E2059, E2062, and E2063 will be used. They were installed on the core stage by September 25, 2023.

In addition to the RS-25Ds, the SLS program makes use of the Main Propulsion Systems (MPS, the &quot;plumbing&quot; feeding the engines) from the three remaining shuttle orbiters for testing purposes (having been removed as part of the orbiters&#x27; decommissioning), with the first two launches (Artemis I and Artemis II) originally predicted to make use of the MPS hardware from Space Shuttles and in their core stages. The SLS&#x27;s propellants are supplied to the engines from the rocket&#x27;s core stage, which consists of a modified Space Shuttle external tank with the MPS plumbing and engines at its aft, and an interstage structure at the top.

For the first two Artemis missions, the engines are installed on the SLS core stage in Building 103 of the Michoud Assembly Facility; they will be installed in the Space Station Processing Facility at Kennedy beginning with Artemis III.

Once the remaining RS-25Ds are exhausted, they are to be replaced with a cheaper, expendable version designated the RS-25E. In 2023, Aerojet Rocketdyne reported reductions in manufacturing time and labour requirements during manufacturing of new-production RS-25 engines, such as a 15% reduction in fabrication time for the powerhead and a 22-month reduction in the time needed to produce a main combustion chamber.

On 1 May 2020, NASA awarded a contract extension to manufacture 18 additional RS-25 engines, with associated services, for $1.79 billion, bringing the total SLS contract value to almost $3.5 billion.

On 29 August 2022, Artemis I was delayed by a problem with engineering sensors on RS-25D #3 (serial number E2058) erroneously reporting that it hadn&#x27;t chilled down to its ideal operating temperature.

On 16 November 2022, Artemis I launched from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39B, the first time the RS-25 engine had flown since the Space Shuttle&#x27;s final flight, STS-135, on 21 July 2011.

==== Engine tests ====
In 2015, a test campaign was conducted to determine RS-25 engine performance with a new engine controller unit, under lower liquid-oxygen temperatures, with greater inlet pressure due to the taller SLS core-stage liquid-oxygen tank and higher vehicle acceleration; and with more nozzle heating due to the four-engine configuration and its position in-plane with the SLS booster exhaust nozzles. New ablative heat-shield insulation was to be tested as well. Tests occurred on January 9 (500 seconds), May 28 (450 seconds), June 11 (500 seconds), June 25 (650 seconds), July 17 (535 seconds), August 13 (535 seconds) and August 27 (535 seconds).

Following these tests, four more engines were scheduled to enter a new test cycle. A new series of tests designed to evaluate performance in SLS-use cases was initiated in 2017.

On February 28, 2019, NASA conducted a 510-second test burn of a developmental RS-25 at 113 percent of its originally designed thrust for more than 430 seconds, about four times longer than any prior test at this thrust level.

On January 16, 2021, the RS-25 engines were fired again, during a hot-fire test as part of the Artemis program. The test was originally scheduled as an 8-minute test but was terminated at the 67th second due to intentionally conservative test parameters being breached in the hydraulic system of Engine 2&#x27;s (serial number E2056) Core Stage Auxiliary Power Unit (CAPU) during the thrust vector control (TVC) system test. Engine 2&#x27;s CAPU was shut down automatically, although if this issue had occurred during flight, it would not have caused an abort, as the remaining CAPUs are capable of powering the TVC systems of all four engines. The engine also suffered a different &quot;Major Component Failure&quot;, in the engine control system, that was caused by instrumentation failure. This have triggered an abort of the launch countdown during an actual launch attempt.

On March 18, 2021, the four RS-25 core-stage engines were once again fired as part of the second SLS core stage hot-fire test, which lasted the full duration of 500 seconds, successfully certifying the Artemis I core stage for flight.

On December 14, 2022, a single development RS-25E, serial number E10001, attempted a 500-second hot-fire test. The test aborted at T+209.5 due to test systems subsequently interpreting signals from a group of improperly configured accelerometers during the hot fire as exceeding acceptable vibration limits. Tests of the engine continued in 2023; on February 8, 2023, it was fired for 500 seconds at 111% power, fitted with a new-production nozzle. Subsequent tests included a 600-second test at 111% power on February 22, a 520-second test at 113% power on March 8, a 600-second test at 113% power on March 21, a 500-second, 113% power level test on April 5, a 720-second fire that tested the engine&#x27;s thrust vectoring gimbal system on April 26, a 630-second test on May 10, and five more 500-second, 113% power level tests without gimbaling on May 23, June 1, June 8, June 15, and June 22.

The RS-25E developmental unit E0525, with significant inclusion of new components including a redesigned nozzle, hydraulic actuators, flex ducts and turbopumps, was hot fire tested to 111% power levels for 550 seconds in the first in a series of certification tests beginning October 17, 2023. It was tested to 113% power levels for 500 seconds on November 15, and to 113% for 650 seconds with gimbaling on November 29, 2023, to 113% for 500 seconds on January 17, 2024, January 23, and January 29,&lt;ref name=&quot;https://www.wlox.com 2024&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; to 113% for 550 seconds on February 23, to 111% for 615 seconds on February 29, and to 113% for 600 seconds on March 6 and 500 seconds on March 22 and 27, and April 3.

=== XS-1 ===

On May 24, 2017, DARPA announced that they had selected The Boeing Company to complete design work on the XS-1 program. The technology demonstrator was planned to use an Aerojet Rocketdyne AR-22 engine. The AR-22 was a version of the RS-25, with parts sourced from Aerojet Rocketdyne and NASA inventories from early versions of the engine. In July 2018 Aerojet Rocketdyne successfully completed ten 100-second firings of the AR-22 in ten days.

On January 22, 2020, Boeing announced its departure from the XS-1 program, leaving no role for the AR-22.

<text>Louise Woodward, born in , is a British former au pair, who at the age of 18 was charged with murder, but was subsequently convicted of involuntary manslaughter (reduced from the jury trial verdict) of eight-month-old baby Matthew Eappen, in Newton, Massachusetts, United States of America.

Eappen died from a fractured skull and subdural hematoma, and had a previously unnoticed fractured wrist. Although Woodward was initially found guilty of second-degree murder, Judge Hiller B. Zobel reduced her conviction to involuntary manslaughter during a post-conviction relief hearing, leading to her release after serving 279 days.

After her return to the United Kingdom, she began a career in law, and later ballroom and Latin dance teaching. In 2022, a Channel 4 documentary revisited the case, with a civil rights lawyer questioning the validity of the &#x27;shaken baby syndrome&#x27; accusation.

==Background==
Five days after being admitted to Children&#x27;s Hospital in Boston, Matthew Eappen fell into a coma and, after being removed from life support, died on , as a result of a fractured skull and subdural hematoma. He was also found to have a fractured wrist, an unnoticed and unexplained injury from a month earlier. Lois E.H. Smith, an ophthalmologist at the hospital, observed retinal hemorrhages judged characteristic of shaken baby syndrome.

Woodward was arrested by police on 5 February, and held for assault and battery initially, then murder when Matthew died. In a statement to the police, Woodward said that she &quot;popped the baby on the bed&quot;, which she said at trial meant the same as &quot;laid&quot; the baby on the bed. However, a police officer testified that Woodward had said she was rough with the child and dropped him twice that day.

A grand jury decided on a first-degree murder charge in March. She was denied bail and held until trial at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution – Framingham, a maximum-security prison. Before the trial, the defense tried to move it to another city, arguing that a local jury would be too biased to render a fair verdict. The judge disagreed and denied the defence motion.

==Polygraph testing==
Before her trial on 7 May 1997, Woodward decided to undergo a polygraph examination conducted by David C. Raskin, a polygraph examiner hired by her own lawyers. During the course of the examination, she was asked questions about whether she caused injury to Matthew while he was in her care on 4 February 1997. She denied having caused any injuries to him, and Raskin concluded that her answers to these questions were truthful to a confidence level of 95 percent. Raskin&#x27;s results were evaluated by Charles Honts, another polygrapher hired by her defense lawyers, who also claimed that she had answered truthfully when responding to relevant questions about whether she had injured him.

==Trial==
The presiding judge was Hiller B. Zobel. The prosecution, led by Assistant District Attorney Gerard Leone, along with Assistant District Attorney Martha Coakley, presented eight physicians involved in Matthew&#x27;s care, including a neurosurgeon, an ophthalmologist, a radiologist, two pathologists, and an expert in child abuse, who testified to their belief that his injuries had occurred as a result of violent shaking, and from his head impacting with a hard surface. The defense challenged this, among other things, on the grounds that there were no neck injuries to him; injuries that they claimed would have been expected if he had been violently shaken. The prosecution had also claimed initially that his impact injuries were the equivalent of having been thrown from a two-story building, but they equivocated over this claim as the trial progressed. The defense presented expert medical testimony that his injury may have occurred three weeks before the date of death, implying that his parents, Sunil and Deborah Eappen, both of whom were doctors, might be implicated in negligence or abuse of the child. He had old wrist injuries that may have been incurred before Woodward even arrived at the house. She, however, claimed under cross-examination that she never noticed any slight bumps, marks, or any unusual behaviour by him at any time prior to the night he was taken to the hospital.

The lead counsel at Woodward&#x27;s trial, and the architect of her medical and forensic defense, was Barry Scheck, co-founder of the Innocence Project. Scheck was hired and paid for by her employer EF Education First&#x27;s Cultural Care Au Pair. As part of the defense strategy, her attorneys requested that the jury not be given the option of convicting her of manslaughter (a lesser included offense), and instead either convict her of murder or find her not guilty. When personally questioned about this decision by the judge, she agreed with her lawyers. Legal experts speculated that the motivation for this strategy was to help EF Education First avoid a civil lawsuit from the Eappens. EF&#x27;s screening process and training for au pairs had come under scrutiny; she had only received three days of training. If the death had been pre-meditated, then under Massachusetts law, EF Education First could not be held responsible. However, if the death was not pre-meditated, then it would indicate fault with EF Education First&#x27;s Cultural Care Au Pair.

On 30 October 1997, after 26 hours of deliberations, the jury found her guilty of second-degree murder. The following day, Judge Zobel sentenced her to life in prison with a minimum of 15 years to be served.

==Appeal==
Woodward&#x27;s legal team filed post-conviction motions to the trial court, and the hearing opened on 4 November. In the days following the verdict, it emerged that the jury had been split about the murder charge, but those who had favoured an acquittal were persuaded to accept a conviction. However, this was of no legal consequence. One juror claimed that none of the jury &quot;thought she tried to murder him&quot;.

On 10 November, at a post-conviction relief hearing, Judge Zobel reduced the conviction to involuntary manslaughter, stating that &quot;the circumstances in which the defendant acted were characterised by confusion, inexperience, frustration, immaturity and some anger, but not malice in the legal sense supporting a conviction for second-degree murder&quot;, adding: &quot;I am morally certain that allowing this defendant on this evidence to remain convicted of second-degree murder would be a miscarriage of justice&quot;.

Woodward&#x27;s sentence was reduced to time served (279 days) and she was freed. Assistant District Attorney Gerald Leone then appealed the judge&#x27;s decision to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. Woodward&#x27;s lawyers also asked the court to throw out her manslaughter conviction. The court affirmed the guilty verdict by a 7–0 vote. However, in a 4–3 split decision, the court rejected the prosecution&#x27;s appeal against the reduction of the conviction to involuntary manslaughter, and the sentence, on 16 June 1998. Woodward then returned to the United Kingdom.

==Aftermath==
On returning home, Woodward gave a press conference, which was broadcast live in the UK and the USA. She said that she would be giving an interview to the BBC, for no money, and wanted to return to her life. The interview was conducted by Martin Bashir in a special edition of the flagship BBC programme &quot;Panorama&quot;, in which she maintained her innocence. In a later interview, Woodward admitted to &quot;lightly shaking&quot; the baby, an action recommended by the National Institutes of Health.

Matthew&#x27;s parents filed a civil lawsuit to prevent Woodward from earning any profits from selling her story. In July 1998, she lost the lawsuit by default as her legal costs were no longer covered by the au pair agency. In January 1999, a settlement was agreed to which barred Woodward from profiting from Matthew&#x27;s death.

Woodward studied law at London South Bank University, where she graduated with a 2:2 (Hons) degree in July 2002. In 2004, she began a training contract (mandatory work experience at an accredited firm that aspiring solicitors must serve) with the law firm North Ainley Halliwell, in Oldham, Greater Manchester. However, she dropped out of her training contract the following year in order to pursue a career as a ballroom and Latin dance teacher in Chester. She and her husband have a daughter, born in 2014.

In 2007, Woodward was named the &#x27;most notorious criminal convicted in Massachusetts&#x27; by Boston law magazine &quot;Exhibit A&quot;.

The conviction had a side effect of defeating legislation in Massachusetts to restore capital punishment, when in November 1997, the Massachusetts House of Representatives deadlocked 80–80 on a bill to restart the practice; Rep. John P. Slattery said he had changed his mind from support to opposition after the case, saying he did not &quot;want to be the one lying in bed some night wondering if the wrong person is being put to death&quot;.

Patrick Barnes, a paediatric radiologist at Stanford University, was a key prosecution witness in the trial, but in 2011, said he would not give the same testimony today. He said there had been a revolution in the understanding of head injuries in the past decade, partly due to advances in MRI brain scanning technology: &quot;We started realizing there were a number of medical conditions that can affect a baby&#x27;s brain and look like the findings that we used to attribute to shaken baby syndrome or child abuse&quot;, such as infections and &quot;in utero&quot; strokes.

In 2022, Channel 4 in the UK broadcast a documentary called &quot;The Killer Nanny: Did She Do It?&quot;, which looked at the case from both prosecution and defence perspectives. In it, civil rights lawyer Clive Stafford Smith stated that &quot;shaken baby syndrome is bullshit&quot;.

Boston-based pediatrician and child abuse expert Dr. Eli Newberger, who treated Matthew and who was also a key prosecution witness in Woodward&#x27;s trial, died in 2024.

<doc id="680006" wikidata="Q199839" url="?curid=680006" title="The Jungle Book (1967 film)">
<text>The Jungle Book is a 1967 American animated musical adventure film produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by Buena Vista Distribution. Based very loosely on the &quot;Mowgli&quot; stories from Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s 1894 book of the same name, it is the final animated feature film to be produced by Walt Disney, who died during its production. It was directed by Wolfgang Reitherman and written by Larry Clemmons, Ralph Wright, Ken Anderson, and Vance Gerry. Featuring the voices of Phil Harris, Sebastian Cabot, Louis Prima, George Sanders, and Sterling Holloway, the film&#x27;s plot follows Mowgli, a feral child raised in the Indian jungle by wolves, as his friends, Bagheera the panther and Baloo the bear, try to convince him to leave the jungle before the ruthless tiger Shere Khan arrives.

The early versions of both the screenplay and the soundtrack followed Kipling&#x27;s work more closely, with a dramatic, dark, and sinister tone, which Disney did not want in his family film, leading to writer Bill Peet and songwriter Terry Gilkyson being replaced.

&quot;The Jungle Book&quot; was released on October 18, 1967, to positive reception, with acclaim for its soundtrack, featuring five songs by the Sherman Brothers and one by Gilkyson, &quot;The Bare Necessities&quot;. With a gross of $23.8 million worldwide, the film initially became Disney&#x27;s second-highest-grossing animated film in the United States and Canada, the ninth-highest-grossing film of 1967, and was also successful during its re-releases. The film was also successful throughout the world, becoming Germany&#x27;s highest-grossing film by number of admissions. Disney released a live-action adaptation in 1994 and an animated sequel, &quot;The Jungle Book 2&quot;, in 2003; a live-action/animated hybrid remake directed by Jon Favreau was released in 2016, with a sequel to that film in development.

==Plot==
In the jungles of India, Bagheera the black panther discovers an orphaned baby boy and brings him to a pack of wolves, who name him Mowgli. Ten years later, the pack learns that the murderous Bengal tiger Shere Khan has returned to their part of the jungle. Knowing that he hates humans and will stop at nothing to kill Mowgli, the wolves decide that the latter must leave; Bagheera agrees to escort Mowgli to a nearby &quot;man village&quot;, though Mowgli is reluctant to leave the only home he has ever known, as he does not fear the tiger, and believes he can last against him (not to mention that he has never met others of his own kind, thus everyone in the man-village will seem like strangers to him).

Bagheera and Mowgli rest in a tree where Kaa the python attempts to devour Mowgli but is stopped by Bagheera. The next morning, Mowgli encounters Colonel Hathi and his elephant herd. Following an argument where Mowgli refuses to go to the man village, he is abandoned by Bagheera. All alone, Mowgli meets and befriends Baloo, a laid-back and carefree sloth bear who promises Mowgli can stay in the jungle with him. Mowgli is soon kidnapped by monkeys who bring him to their leader, King Louie the orangutan. Louie tries to persuade Mowgli to teach him the ways of man, until Baloo and Bagheera arrive and rescue him, destroying Louie&#x27;s temple in the process. Whilst Mowgli is sleeping that night, Bagheera tries to convince Baloo that Mowgli must be taken to the man village. Baloo remains unconvinced until Bagheera reminds him that Shere Khan will try and kill Mowgli, as he is afraid of guns and fire. This persuades Baloo, who tells Mowgli the next morning that he must take him to the man village. Feeling betrayed, Mowgli runs away. Bagheera later finds Colonel Hathi&#x27;s herd and seeks their help in finding Mowgli. However, unbeknownst to any of them, Shere Khan has overheard this and now decides to hunt and kill Mowgli himself.

Whilst going through the jungle, Mowgli is ambushed by Kaa once more, who hypnotises him into a sleep, intending to devour him. However, before he can, Shere Khan arrives and tells Kaa that he is looking for a man cub; Kaa manages to hide Mowgli. After escaping Kaa, Mowgli reaches the wastelands of the jungle where he meets and befriends a group of vultures. However, Shere Khan soon arrives and tries to kill Mowgli. He tries to fight, but soon loses his nerve after realizing how terrifying the tiger truly is before Baloo intervenes. Whilst Shere Khan attacks and nearly kills Baloo, Mowgli ties a burning branch to Shere Khan&#x27;s tail, forcing him to run away in defeat.

Mowgli now mourns the loss of Baloo; as Bagheera respectfully takes Mowgli away, Baloo reveals he is alive, much to everyone&#x27;s happiness. As they get closer to the man village, Mowgli becomes smitten with a girl getting water from the river. He follows her into the man village, having finally accepted the fact that he is a human. Content that Mowgli is where he belongs, Baloo and Bagheera return to the jungle.

==Production==
===Early development===
Walt Disney first considered making an animated version of Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s 1894 collection of stories &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; in the late 1930s. In the early 1960s, after completing his work on &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot;, story artist Bill Peet proposed &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; as the studio&#x27;s next animated feature, seeing it as a &quot;great chance to develop some good animal characters&quot;. Disney agreed and acquired the film rights to all thirteen &quot;Jungle Book&quot; stories from the estate of Alexander Korda (who had produced the 1942 film adaptation) by April 1962, after having spent the previous ten years in negotiations. At that point, Peet had written an early story treatment and developed the initial character designs. Disney originally intended to closely follow Kipling&#x27;s work, planning to make a film that would be &quot;both naturalistic and fantastic, suggestive of the compelling stag fight in &quot;Bambi&quot;&quot;.

Peet created his treatment with little supervision, as he had done with &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; and &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot;. He tried to make the story more linear, since the novel was very episodic, while preserving its ominous tone and adding more drama and suspense (in particular, Peet&#x27;s story would start with wolves and Bagheera rescuing baby Mowgli from falling from a waterfall). He also decided on Mowgli&#x27;s journey from the jungle back to the Man-Village as the film&#x27;s central storyline. One of the few major departures from Kipling&#x27;s works was the character of Baloo, whom Peet rewrote into a &quot;big playful buffoon of a bear&quot;, with the role of Mowgli&#x27;s serious-minded mentor given to Bagheera. Peet created an original character for the filmKing Louie, the leader of the Bandar-log, who would kidnap Mowgli and try to get him to teach them how to make fire and rebuild the ancient city. Louie was also to show Mowgli the treasure under the ruins (a plot point borrowed from &quot;The Second Jungle Book&quot;), which would serve as a setup for the film&#x27;s climax. After Mowgli had arrived to the Man-Village, he would get into an argument with the local hunter Buldeo, which would cause Mowgli to return to the jungle with a torch and use it to scare those who attacked or mocked him through the journey and confront Shere Khan, before being dragged to the ancient city by Buldeo in search for the treasure. After taking some of the treasures, Buldeo would attempt to burn the jungle to avoid the threat of Shere Khan, only for the tiger to attack and kill him, before being killed by Mowgli with Buldeo&#x27;s rifle. Because of his actions, Mowgli would be hailed as a hero in both the jungle and the village and declared the first human member of the wolves&#x27; council.

After the box-office underperformance of &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot;, Walt Disney decided to get more involved in the story development of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; than he had been with the past two films. Upon reviewing the storyboards, Disney felt that Peet&#x27;s approach was too dark and depressing, and held a meeting, insisting on making the story lighter and more aimed at the family demographic. Peet, who had been working on his treatment for over a year by then, refused, resulting in a long argument between him and Disney. On January 29, 1964, Peet left the studio after another fight with Disney over the preliminary recording for Bagheera&#x27;s voice as well as Disney insulting him claiming that he should see &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; for &quot;real entertainment&quot;. Peet would later admit in his autobiography that he was glad he didn&#x27;t insult back at Disney over the film and left the studio when he did knowing that Disney would die two years after he left.

===Rewriting===

After Peet&#x27;s departure, Disney assigned Larry Clemmons as his new writer and one of the four-story men for the film, giving Clemmons a copy of Kipling&#x27;s book, and telling him: &quot;The first thing I want you to do is not to read it.&quot; Clemmons still looked at the novel and thought it was too disjointed and without continuity, needing adaptations to fit a film script. Clemmons wanted to start in medias res, with some flashbacks afterward, but then Disney said to focus on doing the storyline more straight: &quot;Let&#x27;s do the meat of the picture. Let&#x27;s establish the characters. Let&#x27;s have fun with it.&quot;

Although most of Peet&#x27;s work was discarded, the personalities of the characters remained in the final film. This was because Disney felt that the story should be kept simple, and the characters should drive the story. Disney took an active role in the story meetings, acting out each role and helping to explore the emotions of the characters, helping create gags, and developing emotional sequences. The Sherman Brothers re-imagined Peet&#x27;s darker and more sinister version of King Louie as a more comedic character based around jazz and swing music. As Richard M. Sherman recalled: &quot;...our discussion at the time [was], &#x27;He&#x27;s an ape, what does an ape do? Swings in a tree. The jazz is swing music and a guy literally swings if he&#x27;s an ape&#x27;.&quot; Clemmons also created the human girl with whom Mowgli falls in love, as the animators considered that falling in love would be the best excuse for Mowgli to leave the jungle. Clemmons would write a rough script with an outline for most sequences. The story artists then discussed how to fill the scenes, including the comedic gags to employ. The script also tried to incorporate how the voice actors molded their characters and interacted with each other. &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; also marked the last animated film to have Disney&#x27;s personal touches, before his death on December 15, 1966.

===Casting===
Walt Disney wanted to bring in more well-known performers to voice the key characters of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (which was a rarity in his past works). All the celebrities cast in the film had inspired the animators in creating the characters and helped to shape their personalities. The studio held many auditions for the role of Baloo, initially searching for an Ed Wynn-esque voice. The animators also tried out exchange students from India to see if they could get a voice with an indigenous quality, but the idea did not work out. Disney eventually suggested Phil Harris after meeting him at a benefit in Palm Springs, much to the surprise of the animation staff, who could not imagine Harris (who was a comedian) as Kipling&#x27;s character. Harris nearly turned down the role after doing a test recording, as he could not see himself as the character, but reconsidered after the filmmakers allowed him to perform the way that felt the most comfortable to him. Wolfgang Reitherman said when they &quot;told [Harris] not to be a bear, but to be Phil Harris, he got in front of the microphone and tore that thing apart&quot;. The casting of Harris prompted the story artists to expand the role of Baloo from an episodic part to one of the film&#x27;s main characters. Many of Baloo&#x27;s lines were improvised by Harris.

Disney initially considered Louis Armstrong for the role of King Louie; according to Richard M. Sherman, the idea was discarded after one of the writers said that &quot;&#x27;NAACP is going to jump all over it having a black man playing an apeit would be politically terrible&#x27;. That was the last thing on our minds, nothing we&#x27;d ever thought of, so we said &#x27;okay, we&#x27;ll think of someone else&#x27;&quot;. After Phil Harris was cast as Baloo, Disneyland Records president Jimmy Johnson suggested Disney to get Louis Prima, whom he thought to be great as a foil for Harris&#x27; character.

Disney had vultures bearing a physical and vocal resemblance to The Beatles, including the signature mop-top haircut. It was also planned to have the members of the band to both voice the characters and sing their song, &quot;That&#x27;s What Friends Are For&quot;. However, at the time, The Beatles&#x27; John Lennon refused to work on animated films which led to the idea being discarded. The casting of the vultures still brought a British Invasion musician, Chad Stuart of the duo Chad &amp; Jeremy. In earlier drafts of the scene the vultures had a near-sighted rhinoceros friend named Rocky, who was to be voiced by Frank Fontaine, but Disney decided to cut the character, feeling that the film already had enough action with the monkeys and vultures.

Child actor David Bailey was originally cast as Mowgli, but during the film&#x27;s production he hit puberty, and his voice changed. As a result, Wolfgang Reitherman replaced him with his son Bruce, who had just voiced Christopher Robin in &quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree&quot;. The animators also shot a live-action footage of Bruce Reitherman as a guide for the character&#x27;s animation performance. Child actress Darlene Carr was going around singing in the studio when composers Sherman Brothers asked her to record a demo of &quot;My Own Home&quot;. Carr&#x27;s performance impressed Disney enough for him to cast her as the role of the human girl. Clint Howard was cast as Hathi Jr.

Early in the film&#x27;s development, Bill Peet suggested Howard Morris for the role of Bagheera, but Disney did not approve of the choice, with Wolfgang Reitherman and other animators preferring either Karl Swenson or Sebastian Cabot. Cabot was the final choice. Several of the studio&#x27;s voice regulars were cast in the film, including Sterling Holloway as Kaa, J. Pat O&#x27;Malley as both Colonel Hathi and Buzzie the Vulture, and Verna Felton as Winifred.

===Animation===
Animation on &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; commenced on June 1, 1965. While many of the later Disney feature films had animators being responsible for single characters, in &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; the animators were in charge of whole sequences, since many have characters interacting with one another. The animation was done by xerography, with character design, led by Ken Anderson, employing rough, artistic edges in contrast to the round animals seen in productions such as &quot;Dumbo&quot;.

Anderson also decided to make Shere Khan resemble his voice actor, George Sanders. Backgrounds were hand-painted—with an exception of the waterfall, mostly consisting of footage of the Angel Falls—and sometimes scenery was used in both foreground and bottom to create a notion of depth. One of Reitherman&#x27;s trademarks was repurposing animation from previous animated films, including his. For example, animation of the wolf cubs were redrawn from the dalmatian puppies in &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot;. Animator Milt Kahl based Bagheera and Shere Khan&#x27;s movements on live-action felines, which he saw in two Disney productions, &quot;A Tiger Walks&quot; and the &quot;True-Life Adventure&quot; film &quot;Jungle Cat&quot;.

Baloo was also based on footage of bears, even incorporating the animal&#x27;s penchant for scratching. Since Kaa has no limbs, his design received big expressive eyes, and parts of Kaa&#x27;s body did the action that normally would be done with hands. The monkeys&#x27; dance during &quot;I Wan&#x27;na Be Like You&quot; was partially inspired by a performance Louis Prima did with his band on a Las Vegas soundstage that convinced Disney to cast him.

===Music===

The film&#x27;s score was composed by George Bruns and orchestrated by Walter Sheets. Two of the cues were reused from previous Disney films: the scene where Mowgli wakes up after escaping King Louie used one of Bruns&#x27; themes for &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; (1959); and the scene where Bagheera gives a eulogy to Baloo when he mistakenly thinks the bear was killed by Shere Khan used Paul J. Smith&#x27;s organ score from &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937).

The score features six original songs: five by the Sherman Brothers and one by Terry Gilkyson. Longtime Disney collaborator Gilkyson was the first songwriter to bring several complete songs that followed the book closely but Walt Disney felt that his efforts were too dark. The only piece of Gilkyson&#x27;s work which survived to the final film was his upbeat tune &quot;The Bare Necessities&quot;, which was liked by the rest of the film crew. The Sherman Brothers were then brought in to do a complete rewrite. Disney asked the siblings if they had read Kipling&#x27;s book and they replied that they had done so &quot;a long, long time ago&quot; and that they had also seen the 1942 version by Alexander Korda. Disney said the &quot;nice, mysterious, heavy stuff&quot; from both works was not what he aimed for, instead going for a &quot;lightness, a Disney touch&quot;. Disney frequently brought the composers to the storyline sessions. He asked them to &quot;find scary places and write fun songs&quot; for their compositions that fit in with the story and advanced the plot instead of being interruptive.

==Release==
===Original theatrical run===
&quot;The Jungle Book&quot; premiered at the Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood on October 18, 1967, ten months after Walt Disney&#x27;s death. The premiere served as a fundraiser for the Los Angeles Zoo, which had been founded the year before. By December 1967, &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; was released in theaters; some bookings were in a double feature format with a live-action film &quot;Charlie, the Lonesome Cougar&quot; (1967).

Produced on a budget of $4 million, &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; was a massive box-office success, grossing domestic rentals of $11.5 million by 1968. By 1970, the film had grossed $13 million in domestic rentals, becoming the second highest-grossing animated film in the United States and Canada. &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; also earned over $23.8 million worldwide, becoming the most successful animated film released during its initial run.

===Re-releases===
&quot;The Jungle Book&quot; was re-released theatrically in North America in 1978, 1984, and 1990, and also in Europe throughout the 1970s and 1980s. As part of Disney&#x27;s 100th anniversary the film was re-released in cinemas across the UK on September 15, 2023 for one week. A re-issue in the United Kingdom in 1976 generated rentals of $1.8 million. The 1978 re-release increased its North American rentals to $27.3 million, which surpassed &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; making it the highest grossing animated film in the United States and Canada until &quot;Snow White&quot; was re-released in 1983. The film&#x27;s total lifetime gross in the U.S. and Canada is $141 million. When adjusted for inflation, it is estimated to be equivalent to $671,224,000 in 2018, which would make it the 32nd highest-grossing film in the United States and Canada.

By 1981, &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; was Disney&#x27;s best performer overseas, with rentals of $45 million, including $13 million from a 1980 reissue in Spain. It is Germany&#x27;s biggest film in terms of admissions with 27.3 million tickets sold, nearly 10 million more than &quot;Titanic&quot;″s 18.8 million tickets sold. It has grossed an estimated $108 million in Germany, making it the third highest-grossing film in that country behind only &quot;Avatar&quot; ($137 million) and &quot;Titanic&quot; ($125 million). The film was the seventh most popular sound film of the twentieth century in the UK with admissions of 19.8 million. The film is France&#x27;s ninth biggest film in terms of admissions with 14.8 million tickets sold. The film&#x27;s 1993 re-release set an overseas record for a re-issue, grossing overseas during that year. It opened at number one in Germany with a gross of more than $4 million in its first six days and opened in second place at the UK box office before moving to number one for two weeks.

===Home media===
&quot;The Jungle Book&quot; was released in the United States on VHS on May 3, 1991 as part of the Walt Disney Classics video line and in the United Kingdom in 1993. In the United States, the VHS release sold 7.4 million units and grossed in 1991, making it the year&#x27;s third best-selling home video release, behind only &quot;Fantasia&quot; and &quot;Home Alone&quot;. By 1994, &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; sold 9.5 million units in the United States. Home video sales outside North America reached a record 14 million units and grossed by December 1993. Overseas sales reached 14.8 million units by January 1994, becoming the bestselling international VHS release in overseas markets, including sales of 4.9 million units in the United Kingdom, 4.3 million in Germany, and 1.2 million in France. By August 1994, it had sold 15 million units in international overseas markets, bringing worldwide sales to 24.5 million units by 1994. As of 2002, &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; held the record for the bestselling home video release in the United Kingdom, ahead of &quot;Titanic&quot; which sold 4.8 million units.

It was reissued on video in 1997 as part of the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection for the film&#x27;s 30th anniversary. That one was THX certified and featured an exclusive documentary. A Limited Issue DVD was released by Buena Vista Home Entertainment in 1999. The film was released once again as a 2-disc Platinum Edition DVD on October 2, 2007, to commemorate its 40th anniversary. Its release was accompanied by a limited 18-day run at Disney&#x27;s own El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles, with the opening night featuring a panel with composer Richard Sherman and voice actors Bruce Reitherman, Darlene Carr, and Chad Stuart. The Platinum DVD was put on moratorium in 2010. The film was released in a Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Copy Combo pack on February 11, 2014, as part of Disney&#x27;s Diamond Edition line. The Diamond Edition release went back into the Disney Vault on January 31, 2017. In the United States, the DVD and Blu-ray releases sold 12 million units between 2007 and 2016, and have grossed as of August 2018. A Limited Edition from Disney Movie Club was released on Blu-ray and DVD combo on March 26, 2019. The film was re-released on Blu-ray/DVD/Digital on February 22, 2022, in honor of the film&#x27;s 55th anniversary.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;The Jungle Book&quot; received positive reviews upon release, undoubtedly influenced by a nostalgic reaction to the death of Walt Disney. &quot;Time&quot; magazine noted the film strayed far from the Kipling stories, but &quot;[n]evertheless, the result is thoroughly delightful...it is the happiest possible way to remember Walt Disney&quot;. Howard Thompson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the film as &quot;simple, uncluttered, straight-forward fun, as put together by the director, Wolfgang Reitherman, four screen writers and the usual small army of technicians. Using some lovely exotic pastel backgrounds and a nice clutch of tunes, the picture unfolds like an intelligent comic-strip fairy tale&quot;. Richard Schickel, reviewing for &quot;Life&quot; magazine, referred to it as &quot;the best thing of its kind since &quot;Dumbo&quot;, another short, bright, unscary and blessedly uncultivated cartoon&quot;. Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote the film was &quot;really, really good Disney indeed, and nobody needs to say a great deal more&quot;. Arthur D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; gave the film a favorable review while noting that &quot;the story development is restrained&quot; and that younger audiences &quot;may squirm at times&quot;. The song &quot;The Bare Necessities&quot; was nominated for Best Original Song at the 40th Academy Awards, losing to &quot;Talk to the Animals&quot; from &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot;. Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences president Gregory Peck lobbied extensively for the film to be nominated for Best Picture, but was unsuccessful.

Retrospective reviews were also positive, with the film&#x27;s animation, characters and music receiving much praise throughout the years. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average rating of . The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;With expressive animation, fun characters, and catchy songs, &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; endures as a crowd-pleasing Disney classic&quot;. In 1990, when the film had its last theatrical re-release, Ken Tucker of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; considered that &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; &quot;isn&#x27;t a classic Walt Disney film on the order of, say, &quot;Cinderella&quot; or &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, but it&#x27;s one of Disney&#x27;s liveliest and funniest&quot;. Charles Solomon, reviewing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, thought the film&#x27;s animators was &quot;near the height of their talents&quot; and the resulting film &quot;remains a high-spirited romp that will delight children—and parents weary of action films with body counts that exceed their box-office grosses&quot;. In 2010, &quot;Empire&quot; described the film as one that &quot;gets pretty much everything right&quot;, noting that the vibrant animation and catchy songs overcame the plot deficiencies.

Colin Greenland reviewed &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;the last film the old boy worked on himself and I reckon the last good animated feature in his traditional mode - not least because of some rather jolly jazz which, legend has it, Walt himself resisted, and was added after his death&quot;.

===Criticism of racist presentations===
There has been criticism of the portrayal of King Louie, who some have viewed as a racist caricature of African Americans. However, this was not the filmmakers&#x27; intention as the character and mannerisms of King Louie were largely based on his voice actor, Louis Prima, a well-known Italian American jazz musician and performer, who would have been instantly recognizable to audiences during the late 1960s. While Louis Armstrong was briefly considered for the part, the filmmakers quickly steered away from that direction upon realizing the racist implications.

In 2019, Disney added disclaimers warning of &quot;outdated cultural depictions&quot; at the start of the film on Disney+. In January 2021, Disney removed access to the film for child profiles in Disney+, and strengthened the warning message to read: This program includes negative depictions and/or mistreatment of people or cultures. These stereotypes were wrong then and are wrong now. Rather than remove this content, we want to acknowledge its harmful impact, learn from it and spark conversation to create a more inclusive future together.

==Legacy==

Since its original release in 1967, &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; has been widely acclaimed by the animation industry, with animators such as Brad Bird, Andreas Deja, Glen Keane, and Sergio Pablos citing the film to be their inspiration for entering the business; Eric Goldberg also declared that the film &quot;boasts possibly the best character animation a studio has ever done.&quot; The character design and art direction of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; heavily influenced the animators of &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1992), &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994), &quot;Tarzan&quot; (1999), and &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; (2002) in creating animal characters for each of these films. Elements of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; were recycled in the later Disney feature film, &quot;Robin Hood&quot; (1973), such as Baloo being inspiration for Little John (who not only was a bear, but also voiced by Phil Harris); in particular, the dance sequence between Baloo and King Louie was rotoscoped for Little John and Lady Cluck&#x27;s dance.

In 1968, Jimmy Johnson approached Larry Clemmons to write a sequel to &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; for a story-telling records; the album, titled &quot;More Jungle Book... Further Adventures Of Baloo And Mowgli&quot;, was released by Disneyland Records the following year, with Phil Harris and Louis Prima reprising their film roles. In 2003, DisneyToon Studios released a theatrical sequel to the original film, &quot;The Jungle Book 2&quot;; screenwriter Robert Reece also pitched the idea of a third film to Disney executives in 2005, but the project never materialized.

In 1978, a live-action sketch titled &quot;The Wonderful World of Ernie&quot; from &quot;Morecambe and Wise&quot; parodied &quot;I Wan&#x27;na Be Like You (The Monkey Song)&quot; by doing a full reenactment of the scene with sets and costumes and lip-synching to the song&#x27;s original recording (including the characters&#x27; spoken dialogue in the middle of the song). The sketch starred Danny Rolnick as Mowgli, Derek Griffiths as Bagheera, Eric Morecambe as Baloo and Ernie Wise as King Louie.

The characters from the film have also appeared on animated television series such as &quot;TaleSpin&quot; (1990-91) and &quot;Jungle Cubs&quot; (1996-98), which functioned as a prequel that told the stories of Baloo, Hahti, Bagheera, Louie, Kaa, and Shere Khan when they were children. In 1994, Disney released a live-action adaptation which was more of a realistic action-adventure film with somewhat-more adult themes. The film differs more from the book than its animated counterpart, having been an independent film that Disney acquired distribution rights in exchange for them providing half of the film&#x27;s budget and funding. The film received positive reviews from critics and was a box-office success. While Disney was not involved in the film&#x27;s prequel, they produced a direct to video film entitled &quot;The Jungle Book: Mowgli&#x27;s Story&quot;. A new live-action version of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; was released by Disney in 2016, which even reused most of the songs of the animated film, with some lyrical reworking by original composer Richard M. Sherman.

There are two video games based on the film: &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; was a platformer released in 1993 for Master System, Mega Drive, Game Gear, Super NES, Game Boy and PC. A version for the Game Boy Advance was later released in 2003. &quot;The Jungle Book Groove Party&quot; was a dance mat game released in 2000 for PlayStation and PlayStation 2. Kaa and Shere Khan have also made cameo appearances in another Disney video game, &quot;QuackShot&quot;. A world based on the film was intended to appear more than once in the Square Enix-Disney &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; video game series, but was omitted both times, first in the first game because it featured a similar world based on &quot;Tarzan&quot;, and second in &quot;Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep&quot;, although areas of the world are accessible via hacking codes. Baloo and Mowgli appear as interactive characters in Adventureland on &quot;&quot; released in 2011 and re-released in 2017. Mowgli, Bagheera, Baloo, Shere Khan and King Louie appear as playable characters in the video game &quot;Disney Magic Kingdoms&quot;. Baloo appears as a playable character in &quot;Disney Mirrorverse&quot; released in 2022. Baloo and Mowgli appear as a playable characters in the kart racing game &quot;Disney Speedstorm&quot; released in 2022. Since the film&#x27;s release, many of the film&#x27;s characters appeared in &quot;House of Mouse&quot;, &quot;The Lion King 1½&quot;, &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, and &quot;Aladdin and the King of Thieves&quot;. In December 2010, a piece of artwork by British artist Banksy featuring &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; characters which had been commissioned by Greenpeace to help raise awareness of deforestation went on sale for the sum of £80,000.

===Exhibition===
A behind-the-scenes exhibition titled &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s The Jungle Book: Making a Masterpiece&quot;, guest-curated by Andreas Deja took place at The Walt Disney Family Museum from June 23, 2022, to January 8, 2023. The event celebrated the film&#x27;s 55th anniversary by displaying over 600 pieces of rare artwork, manuscripts, photos, animation drawings and cels as well as ephemera. It also detailed the entire story of the film&#x27;s production, its release and the worldwide recognition it has earned through the years. A Members Only Preview which included a special talk with Andreas Deja, Bruce Reitherman, Darleen Carr and Floyd Norman took place on June 22, 2022. An extensive companion book, &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s The Jungle Book: Making a Masterpiece&quot; also written by Deja was originally slated to be published by Weldon Owen on September 20, 2022, before it was changed to November 1.

Special screenings of the film took place at the museum&#x27;s theater from July 2 to July 31, 2022.

<text>George of the Jungle is an American animated television series produced and created by Jay Ward and Bill Scott, who also created &quot;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends&quot;. The character George was inspired by the story of Tarzan and a cartoon characterization of George Eiferman (Mr. America, Mr. Universe, IFBB Hall of Famer) drawn by a cook on his minesweeper in the Navy during World War II. The series aired first-run for 17 episodes on Saturday mornings from September 9 to December 30, 1967, on the ABC-TV network. Then, rather than commissioning new episodes, the network was content to repeat the 17 episodes, keeping &quot;George of the Jungle&quot; on its Saturday schedule until September 1969 when it moved to Sunday mornings until September 19, 1970. 

==Program format==
Each episode featured three segments in the form of three unrelated cartoons: &quot;George of the Jungle&quot;, &quot;Tom Slick&quot;, and &quot;Super Chicken&quot;. All three theme songs were written by the team of Stan Worth and Sheldon Allman, with Worth primarily composing the music and Allman handling the lyrics. Each of the cartoons ended with a strike on the tympani (kettle drum), which changed to an ascending tone, following a pun. 

Unlike previous Ward series, the animation production was done in Hollywood using veteran animators Phil Duncan, Rod Scribner, and Rudy Zamora, among others. Ward mainstays Bill Scott, June Foray, Paul Frees, and Daws Butler provided most of the character voices over all three segments.

The cartoons are technically more advanced than the animation in Ward&#x27;s earlier series, which originated from Gamma Productions, a Mexican studio sponsored by Ward. He was so pleased with &quot;George of the Jungle&quot; that he allowed production to go over budget, which resulted in considerable financial loss, ultimately limiting the series to 17 episodes.

In 2008, Classic Media and Genius Entertainment released the complete series on DVD.

==Segments==

===&quot;George of the Jungle&quot;===
The title segment, &quot;George of the Jungle&quot;, is a parody of the Tarzan stories of Edgar Rice Burroughs. George (voiced by Bill Scott) is a dim-witted but big-hearted &quot;ape man&quot; who is always called upon by District Commissioner Alistair (voiced by Paul Frees) to save inhabitants of the jungle territory of Mbwebwe Province in Africa from various threats.

In the opening title, George is depicted swinging on vines, repeatedly slamming face-first into trees or other obstacles even as theme-song singers warn him to &quot;watch out for that tree!&quot; Another running gag is that George keeps forgetting that he lives in a treehouse, falling from it to the ground every time he leaves home.

George&#x27;s &quot;beloved mate&quot; is Ursula (voiced by June Foray), a Jane-like character (the character was referred to as Jane in the first episode and original pilot) far brighter than George. George&#x27;s closest friend is an ape named Ape (voiced by Paul Frees impersonating Ronald Colman) who, like Ursula, is far more intelligent than George. George has a pet elephant named Shep, who behaves like a lap dog, or, as George refers to him, a &quot;great big peanut-lovin&#x27; poochie,&quot; and who George thinks is a dog. Also of note is the Tooky Tooky (or Tookie Tookie) bird, famous for his call: &quot;Ah ah ee ee tooky tooky!&quot;

George&#x27;s two most frequent foes are a pair of stereotypical hunters named &quot;Tiger&quot; Titheridge (voiced by Daws Butler) and &quot;Weevil&quot; Plumtree (voiced by Paul Frees). Tiger, the taller of the two, wears a pith helmet and khakis, has a pencil moustache, and speaks in an Oxford accent, while Weevil talks like a pirate and wears a white t-shirt and shorts with a bush hat. Another one of George&#x27;s recurring enemies is a mad scientist named Dr. Chicago (voiced by Daws Butler).

George, though hopelessly unintelligent, possesses substantial strength and jungle instincts that allow him to track down enemies. When trapped in a seemingly hopeless situation, he carries a miniature phrase book with numerous animal calls to summon help—although he usually gives the wrong call.

===&quot;Tom Slick&quot;===
&quot;Tom Slick&quot; features the title character (voiced by Bill Scott), a racecar driver who competes in races with his trusty vehicle, the Thunderbolt Greaseslapper. He is accompanied by his girlfriend Marigold (voiced by June Foray), and his elderly mechanic Gertie Growler (also voiced by Bill Scott). Tom&#x27;s chief antagonists are Baron Otto Matic (voiced by Paul Frees) and his lackey Clutcher (voiced by Daws Butler impersonating Frank Fontaine as &quot;Crazy Guggenheim&quot;), whom the Baron often hits across the head with a monkey wrench when he messes up Otto&#x27;s plots.

===&quot;Super Chicken&quot;===
&quot;Super Chicken&quot; features the title character (voiced by Bill Scott in a Boston Brahmin accent), a superhero (who, in &quot;real life&quot;, is wealthy Henry Cabot Henhouse III) with a vegetarian lion sidekick named Fred (voiced by Paul Frees impersonating Ed Wynn). Super Chicken usually begins his adventures with the battle cry, &quot;To the Super Coop, Fred!&quot;, to which Fred replies, &quot;Roger Willcox!&quot; When Fred comments on his latest injury, Super Chicken responds with a variation on the theme, &quot;You knew the job was dangerous when you took it, Fred!&quot; Following his own mistakes, Super Chicken remarks, &quot;I&#x27;m glad no one was here to see that!&quot;

==Episodes==
Each of the following episodes consists of a George of the Jungle cartoon, a &quot;Super Chicken&quot; cartoon, and a Tom Slick cartoon.

==Home media==
On February 12, 2008, Classic Media released a complete collection of the 1967 series which included, as a bonus feature, the original pilot cartoons for both &quot;George of the Jungle&quot; and &quot;Super Chicken&quot;.

==Reception==
In 2002, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked &quot;George of the Jungle&quot; #30 on its &quot;50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time&quot; list.

==Spin-offs==

===Comic book===
Gold Key Comics published two issues of a comic book based on the series in 1969.

===Films===

In 1997, the segment was adapted into a live-action film, titled &quot;George of the Jungle&quot;. Brendan Fraser played the title role, with Leslie Mann as Ursula, John Cleese as the voice of Ape and Thomas Haden Church as the villain, Lyle Van De Groot. A direct-to-video sequel, &quot;George of the Jungle 2&quot;, starring Christopher Showerman as George and Julie Benz as Ursula, was released in 2003.

===2007 series===

Classic Media developed a new &quot;George of the Jungle&quot; Flash animation series 40 years later in 2007. It now utilizes a co-production. The new version of the series is co-produced with Studio B Productions and Teletoon Canada (with other studios also involved), and currently airs on Teletoon in Canada and on Cartoon Network in the United States (starting with a Christmas-themed episode December 21, 2007). The series was scheduled to air on Nicktoons in the United Kingdom and Disney Channel Asia in Southeast Asia. The series officially premiered on Cartoon Network on January 18. Both seasons are available digitally on iTunes.

The series initially ran 26 episodes, with two &quot;George&quot; stories per episode for a total of 52 stories. In 2016, 26 additional episodes were made, also with two &quot;George&quot; stories per episode.

==Cultural references==
&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic did a cover version of the &quot;George of the Jungle&quot; theme on his 1985 album &quot;Dare to Be Stupid&quot;, the only straight cover Yankovic ever released on an album, and which later appeared on the soundtrack of the 1997 live-action film. The music video for Al&#x27;s song Like A Surgeon, also from the &quot;Dare to be Stupid&quot; album, features a doctor watching a clip of the TV series.

Another cover of the theme by The Presidents of the United States of America also appeared on the soundtrack and was the title theme for the film.

The Rhino Records 1989 release &quot;Rerun Rock: Superstars Sing Television Themes&quot; included a cover version performed in the style of &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; by Led Zeppelin and sung by Scott Shaw.

<text>Empty Nest is an American television sitcom that aired for seven seasons on NBC from October 8, 1988, to June 17, 1995. The series, which was created as a spin-off of &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; by creator and producer Susan Harris, starred Richard Mulligan as recently widowed pediatrician Dr. Harry Weston, whose two adult daughters return home to live with him. The series was produced by Witt/Thomas/Harris Productions in association with Touchstone Television.

==History==
An early version of the series initially appeared in the 1987 &quot;Golden Girls&quot; episode &quot;Empty Nests&quot; which was intended to act as a backdoor pilot for the spin-off, which was to begin during the fall 1987 TV season.

In the episode, George and Renee Corliss (played by Paul Dooley and Rita Moreno), were introduced as the Girls&#x27; neighbors, a middle-aged couple suffering from empty nest syndrome. Their teenage daughter Jenny (Jane Harnick), who had left for college, and Renee&#x27;s brother Chuck (Geoffrey Lewis), also appeared. The Corlisses also had an annoying neighbor played by David Leisure (although in this version his character was named Oliver).

Rita Moreno later criticized the &quot;Empty Nest&quot; pilot, calling it a &quot;very, very bad show.&quot; She explained that the script desperately needed rewrites from creator Susan Harris, but she was very sick the week of shooting so it was left to other writers to fix. According to Moreno, &quot;every day they kept changing my character, to the extent that by the time we got to do it in front of an audience I couldn&#x27;t remember Line 1 because the attitudes had changed so many times. That was the most embarrassing experience...we must have done, I would guess, about 15 takes in front of an audience.&quot;

Ultimately, the series did not go ahead as planned and the premise was later extensively revamped with a new cast before &quot;Empty Nest&quot; debuted in 1988. The set of the Corlisses&#x27; house, however, was exactly the same as the one that later became the Weston residence.

== Premise ==
The show&#x27;s story revolves around Miami pediatrician Dr. Harry Weston, whose life is turned upside down when his wife, Libby, dies and two of his adult daughters move back into the family home. Early episodes establish that the &quot;Golden Girls&quot; characters are neighbors of the Westons. Original &quot;Golden Girls&quot; actors, Bea Arthur, Rue McClanahan, Betty White and Estelle Getty all guest-star as their &quot;Golden Girls&quot; characters, and Mulligan appears occasionally on &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;.

In the show, eldest daughter Carol is a highly-strung recent divorcée, while middle daughter Barbara is a tough undercover police officer. The two sisters frequently bicker and vie for the attention of their father, whom they call &quot;Daddy&quot;, while their father occasionally expresses regret at never having had a son. The Westons&#x27; large dog Dreyfuss also prominently features as a member of the household.

In 1992, Kristy McNichol, who played Barbara, left the show, and Lisa Rieffel joined the cast as the third Weston daughter, Emily. Her character had previously not been shown onscreen, but had been mentioned as being away at college. Rieffel left after one season, and for the show&#x27;s final two seasons only eldest daughter Carol remained of the Weston children. Kristy McNichol returned for the series finale in 1995.

Another main character is the Westons&#x27; neighbor and friend, Charley Dietz (David Leisure), a womanizing cruise ship employee who frequently enters the house uninvited and takes food or makes sexist comments. Charley has a father-son relationship with Harry and a love-hate relationship with Carol.

Harry Weston&#x27;s job is another major focus for the show. For the first five seasons, he works at a hospital, where he is assisted by wisecracking Southern nurse Laverne, played throughout the series by Park Overall. Laverne and Harry are shown to be good friends. In season six, Harry retires, eventually going to work for a struggling inner-city medical clinic run by the tough-talking Dr. Maxine Douglas. Nurse Laverne, having been fired by Dr. Weston&#x27;s replacement, comes to work there as well.

Another character who appears is Carol&#x27;s boyfriend, Patrick, an artist who is almost as eccentric as she is. Patrick convinces the Westons to let him use their empty garage as his new painting studio and, when his relationship with Carol becomes serious, he eventually moves into the house. Carol and Patrick&#x27;s romantic bliss is short-lived, and they break up at the beginning of season six. Carol then finds she is pregnant with Patrick&#x27;s child, and chooses to raise the baby, Scotty, on her own.

Estelle Getty reprised her &quot;Golden Girls&quot; character Sophia Petrillo during &quot;Empty Nest&quot;″s final two seasons (after the cancellation of &quot;The Golden Palace)&quot;. In the show, it is explained that Sophia has moved back into the nearby Shady Pines retirement home.

==Production notes==
In 1991, &quot;Empty Nest&quot; spawned its own spinoff, &quot;Nurses&quot;, a sitcom about a group of nurses working in the same hospital as Dr. Weston. The three series (&quot;Empty Nest&quot;, &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; and &quot;Nurses&quot;) represented one of the few times in American television history that three shows from the same producer, all taking place in the same city and explicitly set up with the characters knowing each other from the very beginning, aired on the same network in one night. On at least two occasions, Harris wrote storylines which carried through all three series as fictional crossovers.

Richard Mulligan and Dinah Manoff (who depict father Harry and daughter Carol in &quot;Empty Nest&quot;) had previously appeared as onscreen father-in-law and daughter-in-law characters in the show &quot;Soap&quot;, created by the same production team. Jay Johnson, who had appeared on &quot;Soap&quot; as Mulligan&#x27;s son, also made a guest appearance.

===Theme song===
The show&#x27;s theme song is &quot;Life Goes On&quot;, written by John Bettis and George Tipton and performed by Billy Vera. For the first three seasons, the song is presented in a slower, more melancholy yet comical arrangement. The original opening titles sequence shows Harry Weston taking Dreyfuss for a walk around town, with still images of the other regular cast members shown as they are credited.

When the third season began, a new opening sequence debuted, made up of footage from the series&#x27; episodes and showing each of the regular cast members.

For the final four seasons the theme song is presented in a higher, more upbeat arrangement with female backup singers, and the same title sequence introduced in the third season.

==Crossovers==

==Syndication==
The series was unsuccessful when it was first syndicated, running in local syndication from September 1993 to September 2000, shortly before the death of star Richard Mulligan. During this time, &quot;Empty Nest&quot; aired on TBS from September 9 to December 6, 1996, and on WGN from September 9, 1996, to March 26, 1999, with both stations airing the series as part of the regular syndication run (both TBS and WGN were superstations).

In the subsequent decade, the series did not air on American television. Hallmark Channel, which also licenses the rights to &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, picked up the rights to the show in early 2011 and aired it from February 26 to June 26 of that year, but eventually removed it altogether.

Upon its launch on April 15, 2015, the new digital sub-channel Laff began airing the series and continued until March 30, 2018.

In Canada, the series was rerun on CBC Television during the 1990s.

In Italy, the series aired on Rai Uno (or Rai 1) under the name &quot;&quot; (&quot;Daddy&#x27;s Dog&quot;) during the 1990s.

In the UK, the series was shown on Channel 4 during the 1990s.

==Awards==
In 1989, Richard Mulligan won both an Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. The series received a number of other Emmy and Golden Globe Award nominations over the years, especially for Mulligan and for Park Overall, who was nominated three times for a Golden Globe Award.

<text>Thomas Lee Kirk (December 10, 1941 − September 28, 2021) was an American actor, best known for his performances in films made by Walt Disney Studios such as &quot;Old Yeller&quot;, &quot;The Shaggy Dog&quot;, &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot;, &quot;The Absent-Minded Professor&quot;, and &quot;The Misadventures of Merlin Jones&quot;, as well as the beach party films of the mid-1960s. He frequently appeared as a love interest for Annette Funicello or as part of a family with Kevin Corcoran as his younger brother and Fred MacMurray as his father.

Kirk&#x27;s career with Disney ended when news of his homosexuality threatened to become public. He struggled with drug addiction and depression for several years, appearing in a series of low-budget films before leaving the acting business in the mid-1970s. Kirk opened a carpet cleaning business and lived a mostly ordinary life, occasionally appearing at fan conventions. He died at his home in Las Vegas, Nevada, in September 2021, aged 79.

==Early life==
Kirk was born in Louisville, Kentucky, one of four sons. His father, Louis, was a mechanic who worked for the highway department; his mother, Lucy, was a legal secretary. Looking for better job opportunities, they moved to Downey, California when Kirk was 15 months old.

In 1954, Kirk accompanied his elder brother Joe to an audition for a production of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;Ah, Wilderness!&quot; at the Pasadena Playhouse in Pasadena, California. &quot;Joe was star struck,&quot; said Kirk. Joe was not cast, losing out to Drisoll, but Tommy was, and he made his stage debut opposite Will Rogers Jr. &quot;It was five lines, it didn&#x27;t pay anything, and nobody else showed up, so I got the part,&quot; recalled Kirk.

The performance was seen by an agent from the Gertz agency, who signed Kirk and succeeded in casting him in an episode of &quot;TV Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, &quot;The Last of the Old Time Shooting Sheriffs&quot;, directed by William Beaudine. Kirk&#x27;s brother went on to become a dentist. Kirk was in demand almost immediately.

==Disney career==
In April 1956, 14-year-old Kirk was cast as Joe Hardy for &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot; serial &quot;The Hardy Boys&quot;, alongside Tim Considine as Frank Hardy. The first of the serials, &quot;The Mystery of the Applegate Treasure,&quot; was filmed in June and early July 1956, and aired in October at the start of the show&#x27;s second season. In the following year, the second serial &quot;The Mystery of Ghost Farm&quot; aired in 1957. The show and Kirk&#x27;s performance were extremely well received and led to a long association between the actor and the Disney studio. A year prior to being cast in &quot;The Hardy Boys&quot;, Kirk first auditioned for another serial &quot;Spin and Marty,&quot; but was unsuccessful. The open audition took the form of a baseball game.

In August 1956, Disney hired him and the former Mouseketeer Judy Harriet to attend both the Republican and Democratic presidential nominating conventions, for newsreel specials that later appeared on the show. Kirk also hosted short travelogues for the serial segment of the show&#x27;s second season, sometimes with Annette Funicello. He did the voice-over narration for &quot;The Eagle Hunters&quot; and dubbing work for the Danish-made film &quot;Vesterhavsdrenge&quot;, shown on the &quot;Mickey Mouse Club&quot; as the serial &quot;Boys of the Western Sea&quot;. Around this time, it was announced that Kirk would appear as Young Davy Crockett, but this did not happen.
Kirk&#x27;s career received its biggest break yet when, in January 1957, Disney cast him as Travis Coates in &quot;Old Yeller&quot; (1957), an adventure story about a boy and his heroic dog. Kirk had the lead role in the film, a success at the box-office, and he became Disney&#x27;s first choice whenever they needed someone to play an all-American teenager. Kevin Corcoran played his younger brother and the two of them were often cast as brothers. Later that year, Kirk and Corcoran were announced for the cast of &quot;The Rainbow Road to Oz&quot;, a feature film based on the stories of L. Frank Baum, but this film was never produced.
In July 1958, Kirk was cast in &quot;The Shaggy Dog&quot; (1959), a comedy about a boy inventor, who under the influence of a magic ring, is repeatedly transformed into an Old English Sheepdog. This teamed him with Corcoran and Considine, and two other Disney stars with whom he regularly worked, Fred MacMurray and Annette Funicello. According to &quot;Diabolique&quot;, &quot;Much of the credit went to MacMurray; a lot of the credit should have gone to Kirk, whose easy-going boy next door charm made him the ideal American teen.&quot; Kirk said that when filming finished, Disney told him they did not have any projects for him and his contract would not be renewed. &quot;I was thin and gangly and looked a mess ... I thought the whole world had fallen to pieces,&quot; he said. (At the same time, &quot;Film Daily&quot; called Kirk one of its five &quot;male juveniles&quot; of the year, the others being Tim Considine, Ricky Nelson, Eddie Hodges, and James MacArthur.)

With his Disney contract completed, Kirk went to Universal Pictures, where he played the male lead in the English dub of a Soviet animated feature, &quot;The Snow Queen&quot;, opposite Sandra Dee.

&quot;Shaggy Dog&quot; turned out to be a hit, gaining significantly larger rentals than &quot;Old Yeller&quot;, and Disney soon contacted Kirk, offering him another long-term contract and a role as middle son Ernst Robinson in another adventure film, &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot; (1960), starring John Mills, Janet Munro, and once again Dorothy McGuire as his onscreen mother and Corcoran. It remained Kirk&#x27;s favorite movie. When he returned from filming in the West Indies, the studio signed him to two more movies.

Kirk followed up with a secondary role in a fantasy comedy starring Fred MacMurray, &quot;The Absent-Minded Professor&quot; (1961), another huge hit. Disney sent Kirk to England for &quot;The Horsemasters&quot; (1961), a youth-oriented horse riding film, which was made for U.S. television, but screened theatrically in some markets. He appeared once more with Munro and Funicello. That same year, Kirk played the support role of Grumio in the fairy tale fantasy &quot;Babes in Toyland&quot;, supporting Funicello, Ray Bolger, Ed Wynn and Tommy Sands. Kirk later described this film as &quot;sort of a clunker ... but it has a few cute moments, it&#x27;s an oddity&quot;, and enjoyed working with Ed Wynn. It was a box-office disappointment; so too was &quot;Moon Pilot&quot; (1962), a satirical comedy where Kirk played the younger brother of Tom Tryon.

Kirk acted in a family comedy with MacMurray, &quot;Bon Voyage&quot; (1962), with other family members played by Jane Wyman, Deborah Walley, and Corcoran. On set, Kirk did not get along with his onscreen parents. He later admitted that his own neediness made him view MacMurray as a surrogate father, a role MacMurray had no wish to fulfill. Kirk also had trouble with Jane Wyman, saying: &quot;She was very mean to me. She went out of her way to be shitty ... but she was a total bitch and I think she was homophobic.&quot;&#x27; Kirk maintained better relationships with his onscreen brothers Kevin Corcoran and Tim Considine, who called Kirk &quot;a monster talent&quot;.

Kirk starred with Funicello in another overseas-shot story which screened in the United States on TV, but was released in some countries theatrically: &quot;Escapade in Florence&quot; (1962). Newspaper columns occasionally linked Kirk and Funicello&#x27;s names romantically, though in fact, they were never anything more than friendly coworkers.

In July 1962, Disney announced they would make &quot;The Happiest American&quot; with Kirk, but it was not made. Instead, he did a sequel to &quot;Absent Minded Professor&quot;, &quot;Son of Flubber&quot; (1963), his last film with MacMurray.

In 1963, Kirk reprised his role as Travis Coates in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Savage Sam&quot; (1963), a sequel to &quot;Old Yeller&quot;, which reunited him with Corcoran and co-starred Brian Keith; it was not as well received as &quot;Old Yeller&quot;.

Disney then cast Kirk as student inventor Merlin Jones in &quot;The Misadventures of Merlin Jones&quot; (1964), again opposite Funicello. The film was directed by Robert Stevenson, who was frequently assigned Disney comedies. It became an unexpected box-office sensation, earning $4 million in rentals in North America, and Disney invited Funicello and him back to make a sequel, &quot;The Monkey&#x27;s Uncle&quot; (1965). &quot;The Monkey&#x27;s Uncle&quot; came out in July 1965 and was almost as successful as &quot;Merlin Jones&quot;.

== Television ==
Kirk began to work steadily in television throughout 1956 and 1957 in episodes of &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot; (&quot;Green Promise&quot;), &quot;Frontier&quot; (&quot;The Devil and Doctor O&#x27;Hara&quot;), &quot;Big Town&quot; (&quot;Adult Delinquents&quot;), &quot;Crossroads&quot; (&quot;The Rabbi Davis Story&quot;), &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; (&quot;Cow Doctor&quot;), &quot;Letter to Loretta&quot; (&quot;But for God&#x27;s Grace&quot;, &quot;Little League&quot;) and &quot;Matinee Theatre&quot; (&quot;The Outing&quot;, &quot;The Others&quot; – a version of &quot;Turn of the Screw&quot;).

Kirk supported Angie Dickinson in a short feature called &quot;Down Liberty Road&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;Freedom Highway&quot; (1956), a short commercial travelogue produced by Greyhound Lines to promote their Scenicruiser buses.

Concurrent with his film career at Disney, Kirk continued to guest star on television series, such as &quot;The O. Henry Playhouse&quot; (&quot;Christmas by Injunction&quot;), &quot;The Californians&quot; (as Billy Kilgore in &quot;Little Lost Man&quot;), &quot;Matinee Theatre&quot; (&quot;Look Out for John Tucker&quot;), &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; (&quot;A Corner of the Garden&quot;),&quot;The Millionaire&quot; (&#x27;Millionaire Charles Bradwell&quot;) (1959) &quot;Bachelor Father&quot; (&quot;A Key for Kelly&quot;), &quot;Mr. Novak&quot;, &quot;Love in the Wrong Season&quot; (1963), &quot;Angel&quot; (&quot;Goodbye Young Lovers&quot;), and &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot; (&quot;Ten Minutes from Now&quot;) (1964).

== Later films ==
The news of Kirk&#x27;s termination from Disney Studios was not made public, but Kirk was soon working for American International Pictures (AIP), which needed a leading man to co-star with Funicello in a musical they were preparing, &quot;The Maid and the Martian&quot;. Kirk was cast as a Martian who arrives on Earth and falls in with a bunch of partying teenagers. The movie was later retitled &quot;Pajama Party&quot; (1964) and was a box-office success. 

AIP then cast him in &quot;The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini&quot; (1966) with Deborah Walley. Soon after, he and Walley were put in &quot;It&#x27;s a Bikini World&quot;, filmed in late 1965 under the direction of Stephanie Rothman. It was not released until 1967. Also for AIP, he appeared in a TV special, &quot;The Wild Weird World of Dr. Goldfoot&quot; (1965), made to promote &quot;Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine&quot;, which aired in November 1965. In December, he announced he would make three more films for Exclusive, starting with &quot;Teacher, Teacher&quot;, alongside Bob Denver and Dawn Wells but the film would not be made.

Following his work for AIP, Kirk spent the remainder of the 1960s making various low-budget films, including &quot;Village of the Giants&quot; (1965) for Bert I. Gordon; &quot;The Unkissed Bride&quot; (1966) for Jack H. Harris; &quot;Track of Thunder&quot; and &quot;Catalina Caper&quot; in 1967&quot;&quot;; and two films for Texan director Larry Buchanan: &quot;Mars Needs Women&quot; (1968) and &quot;It&#x27;s Alive!&quot; (1969). Kirk got along well with Buchanan and the two would often spend time together off-set.

Kirk said he reached bottom in 1970 when he did two movies that were not Screen Actors Guild, &quot;Ride the Hot Wind&quot; and &quot;Blood of Ghastly Horror&quot;, causing him to almost lose his SAG card. &quot;Finally, I said, to hell with the whole thing, to hell with show business, I&#x27;m gonna make a new life for myself, and I got off drugs, completely kicked all that stuff.&quot; In the 1970s, he was in a 1973 episode of &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot; and then starred in low-budget western &quot;My Name Is Legend&quot; (1975). While filming &quot;My Name is Legend&quot;, Kirk was thrown from a horse and injured.

== Singing ==
In the succession of films with Annette Funicello, Kirk recorded a few songs to accompany the films. For &quot;Pajama Party&quot; (1964), they recorded and filmed &quot;There Has to Be a Reason&quot; in a lip-synced performance as a duet. However, the original recording track was heavily altered by the studio engineers, mostly with echo effect. Kirk described his own singing voice as &quot;wispy and adolescent&quot;. For &quot;Merlin Jones&quot;, Kirk featured on the song &quot;The Scrambled Egghead&quot; with Funicello.

Later in his career, Kirk returned to his home state of Kentucky and performed in musical theatre, including &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; (as Horace Vandergelder), &quot;Anything Goes&quot; (as Moonface Martin), &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot; (as Marcus Lycus), and &quot;Little Mary Sunshine&quot; (as General Fairfax).

==Personal life==

=== Sexuality ===
Kirk later recalled being gay and working at Disney as &quot;terrible&quot;. He said the studio:
Were growing aware. They weren’t stupid; they could add two and two, and I think they were beginning to suspect. I noticed people in certain quarters were getting less and less friendly. You know, you can tell. To complicate the thing, I was messing around with drugs and drinking. I wasn’t disciplined; I was kind of a wild Irish person and nobody could tell me what to do. I lived my life exactly as I pleased; I tried to keep my private life private, but I was messing around and I was drinking a lot and going around to wild parties and carrying on, you know 一 and this is all contrary to the Disney image.&quot;

While filming &quot;The Misadventures of Merlin Jones&quot; in 1963, 21-year-old Kirk began a relationship with a 15-year-old boy, and was caught having sex with him at a swimming pool in Burbank. The boy&#x27;s mother informed Disney, who elected not to renew Kirk&#x27;s contract. Walt Disney personally fired Kirk, but when &quot;Merlin Jones&quot; became an unexpected hit, Disney allowed him to return long enough to film a sequel, &quot;The Monkey&#x27;s Uncle.&quot;

Kirk publicly came out as gay in a 1974 interview with John Marvin. At the time he was studying acting at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute, while working as a busboy in a Los Angeles restaurant.

In 2017, while being interviewed for an online talk radio show, Kirk confessed that he regarded himself as bisexual. &quot;I have had relations with women too. I am not just gay, I am—I happen to be &quot;both&quot;, I would say. Like many people.&quot;

===Alcohol and drugs===
Kirk had issues with alcohol and drugs, later saying:
I was drinking from the time I was 14. I always liked it. I started messing with drugs in the last couple of years at Disney—around &#x27;62. I&#x27;d get so tired, and somebody gave me some amphetamines, and they made me feel good and gave me energy, and I got addicted. There were a lot of people mixing them with alcohol. I very nearly died of an overdose a couple of times in 1966. I got off drugs absolutely by 1968, but I continued to drink. During that part of the 60s, I was pretty messed up and I wasn&#x27;t employable; I wasn&#x27;t fit for work. I wouldn&#x27;t go for treatment and nobody could tell me what to do; I just wrecked everything in my life. Thank God I didn&#x27;t do anything that I look back on with horror...I didn&#x27;t kill anybody in a car accident or kill myself, though I very nearly did, drinking and driving... I fell asleep at the wheel on the Ventura Freeway one night about 1967, and drove diagonally across the Freeway. Just missed getting creamed by a truck... It was mainly pills. Speed, uppers, diet pills—and I got thin as a rake, and I was high all the time. It was a terrible period in my life.

===Arrests===
On Christmas Eve 1964, Kirk was arrested for suspicion of possession of marijuana at a house in Hollywood. The district attorney&#x27;s office subsequently refused to file a complaint against him on the marijuana charge. The city attorney&#x27;s office, however, filed an illegal drugs charge, because officers found a vial of barbiturates in his car. This charge was dismissed by a judge in early January when Kirk&#x27;s attorney established that the barbiturates had been prescribed by a physician. However, the damage to his career had been done. He was replaced on &quot;How to Stuff a Wild Bikini&quot; (1965) by Dwayne Hickman (intended as AIP&#x27;s follow-up to &quot;Pajama Party&quot;), on &quot;The Sons of Katie Elder&quot; by Michael Anderson, Jr. and on &quot;Beach Ball&quot; by Edd Byrnes. His initial casting in these films was announced in late 1964.

==Post-acting career==

&quot;I lost everything I had,&quot; Kirk recalled. &quot;I lost my money, my property; I partied it all away. I was very irresponsible financially. I lived my own life; I guess I was just seeking love or pleasure or some kind of illusory or transitory happiness, and I was pretty wild. The first 10 years after leaving Disney were pretty awful.&quot;

Kirk got over his drug addiction and gave up acting in the mid-1970s. He worked as a waiter and a chauffeur before going into the carpet-cleaning business in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles, an operation which he ran for 20 years. 

In 1990, Kirk said he was &quot;poor&quot;, but had &quot;No bitterness. No regrets.&quot; He wrote an unproduced script about Abraham Lincoln and continued to act occasionally, including small roles in &quot;Streets of Death&quot; (1988) and &quot;Attack of the 60 Foot Centerfold&quot; (1995). He also enjoyed writing and occasionally appearing at retro film conventions. He had maintained a lifelong friendship with his Old Yeller co-star Beverly Washburn, since re-meeting at a convention in 1994. He lived a private life and did not believe in &quot;exhibiting&quot; himself, preferring to keep away from the public eye.

In 1993 Kirk said &quot;I’ve quit drugs. I don&#x27;t use anything at all. I don’t smoke; I don’t drink; I don&#x27;t use drugs. I eat a very healthy diet, and I feel pretty good. I enjoy my work and I am a Christian. I’ve found Christianity to be a huge and tremendous help in getting the poison out of my system, purging myself of resentments and bitterness.&quot;
Kirk was inducted as a Disney Legend on October 9, 2006, alongside his former co-stars Tim Considine and Kevin Corcoran. His other repeat co-stars, Annette Funicello and Fred MacMurray, had already been inducted in 1992 and 1987, respectively. Also in 2006, the first of Kirk&#x27;s &quot;Hardy Boys&quot; serials was issued on DVD in the fifth &quot;wave&quot; of the Walt Disney Treasures series. At that point, he was retired with &quot;a nice pension&quot; and living in Redding, California.

==Death==
Kirk was found dead at his Las Vegas apartment on September 28, 2021. He was 79 years old.

<text>The Marrah Mountains or Marra Mountains (Fur, Fugo Marra; , Jebel Marra) are a range of volcanic peaks in a massif that rises up to . They are the highest mountains in Sudan.

==Geography==

The mountains are located in the center of the Darfur region of Sudan on the border of the states of South Darfur and Central Darfur, with a smaller part of the range in the state of North Darfur. The highest point is Deriba Caldera. The upper reaches of the massif is a small area of temperate climate with high rainfall and permanent springs of water amidst the dry savanna and scrub of the Sahel below.

Apart from the Aïr Mountains in Niger which are on the border of the Sahara proper, the Marrah Mountains are the only major mountain range in the otherwise flat Sahel, rising up to above the plain, but are relatively unknown owing to lack of development and political conflict in the region.

The last eruption occurred around 1500 BC. The centre of activity was Deriba Caldera, and involved caldera collapse following the eruption of pumice and pyroclastic flows which travelled over from the volcano.

The vegetation was described by Gerald Wickens.

=== Description of the lakes ===
The two lakes at Deriba, as described by Hobbs&#x27; 1918 notes, were presumably the only two in Jebel Marra. Hobbs situated them at an altitude of approximately 518 m (1700 feet, as indicated in his note) above the plain and 1,463 m (4,804 feet) above sea level (modern measurements, however, indicate 2100 m). They were described as being located within a vast amphitheatre, approximately 4.8 to 6.4 km (3 to 4 miles) in diameter, formed by a continuous circular (or slightly oval) range of steeply sloping heights, varying from about 244 to 610 m (800 to 2,000 feet) above the surrounding area.

The larger lake, known as the &quot;female&quot;, lay in the northeast corner of the amphitheatre. It measured approximately in length, in width, and had a circumference of about . Its water, with a high salinity, appeared murky green and emitted an unpleasant odour. Although time constraints prevented soundings, it was inferred that the lake was shallow except in its northern part. The smaller lake, dubbed as &quot;male&quot;, situated around south, had fresher water. Its dimensions were approximately in length, in width, with a circumference of about . Rising nearly vertically from the water&#x27;s edge, the crater walls reached heights of around , except for the northern rim, which sloped gently. Like its counterpart, this lake exhibited a greenish hue and a faint sulphuric aroma. 

Since the first exploration by Hobbs and Gillan in 1918 (Gillan 1918, Hobbs 1918.), Jebel Marra has been visited by many geologists, botanists and zoologists. In 1964 an expedition made the first biological survey of the streams and two Deriba lakes. The hydrobiological importance of Jebel Marra stems from the isolation of these waters near the geographical centre of the African continent, coupled with the known chemical differences between the various streams and lakes (Hunting Technical Services, 1958). During the five-week expedition, numerous samples were collected from various sites, including the two saline crater lakes. Chemical analyses were conducted both in the field and at the University of Khartoum. The team also conducted the first bathymetric survey of the lakes, using a calibrated echo sounder and an inflatable rubber dinghy. The larger lake was found to be shallow, with a maximum depth of , while the smaller lake featured unique characteristics, including a conical funnel.

Further investigation, including depth checks using a variety of methods, revealed evidence of significant water level rises in both lakes in relatively recent times. Clear evidence of former beach levels suggested abrupt rises, probably caused by large landslides on the unstable inner walls of the crater. Evidence from dead trees and comparison with historical maps and photographs revealed changes in lake dimensions and levels over time. The study concluded by suggesting a steady rise in the level of the great lake due to the influx of sediment, which could lead to its eventual disappearance.

== History ==
During the War in Darfur, the Marrah Mountains came under the control of the rebel Sudan Liberation Movement/Army faction loyal to Abdul Wahid al Nur. The mountains remained one of the group&#x27;s most important strongholds, housing several of its bases, as of 2021.

==Geology==

Jebel Marra, an extinct late Tertiary volcanic massif with a peak elevation of , extends north-south for about , widens to , and continues north for another . The Tagabo Hills and the Meidob Plateau, to the north-east of the range, are thought to be of volcanic origin. The plateau rests on Archean rocks on an uplift between the Chad and Middle Nile basins and extends westwards to the Sudanese border, forming an undulating peneplain called the Basement Complex, with elevations ranging from in the east to in the west. Isolated hills and ridges, such as the Tebella Massif, possibly remnants of an older erosional surface, dot the peneplain.

To the southeast and south of Jebel Marra, the plateau maintains an elevation of , revealing Archaean rocks beneath sand and clay deposits at distances of from the base of the mountain. Similar features are observed in the west, including small plateaus and inselbergs such as the Dagu Hills and the Gennung at . The eastern and northern regions of Zalingei are dominated by acid crystalline schists and gneisses, while the western counterpart consists mainly of paraschists, calc-silicate gneisses and other rock formations.

South of the Tebella massif, the Wadi Debarei basin appears to be a clinal trough intruded and occupied by foliated unfoliated granite. Geologists from the Sudan Geological Survey have recently carried out work near El Fasher and Nyala, but their results are not yet published. Jebel Nyala, the Dagu Jebels and the Wana Hills show granitic and gneissic compositions, while the areas between El Fasher and Nyala show predominantly quartzose rocks.

About east of Jebel Marra, the Archaean rocks are covered by Nubian sandstones, with evidence of a westward extension near El Geneina. Recent geological surveys suggest the extensive presence of Nubian sandstones southwest of El Fasher under wind-borne sands, challenging previous beliefs. Limestone near Zalingei, derived from calcareous waters from springs, is the only recorded sedimentary deposit within the Archaean outcrop.

Andrew (1948) suggests that volcanic activity in Jebel Marra began in the Upper Tertiary (Miocene). The Deriba crater, thought to be a recent culmination, has a diameter of over and contains two lakes with distinct saline characteristics. Lava peaks surround the crater, one of which may be the highest point in the range. The volcanic history shows periods of continuous lava eruption, erosion and explosive events that shaped the existing large crater. Outlying volcanic areas and an intrusive phase represented by dykes near Kutum remain topics for further study.

The region is characterised by widespread surficial deposits of fluviatile and aeolian origin, with the Wadi &#x27;Azum and its tributaries showing broad channels and terraces. The eastward and southeastward flowing rivers have sandy beds that change to silts within of their sources. A large silt or clay plain north-east of Kutum is thought to be a playa, while a former erg, the qoz, retains dune relief, immobilised by the prevailing savannah. The W. Ibra conveys river runoff south of Jebel Marra, and the Qoz Dango continues the extension of the erg, with no western counterpart on the volcanic highlands.

In summary, the geological and topographical features of Jebel Marra include its volcanic origin, diverse rock compositions, sedimentary deposits and history of volcanic activity. Ongoing geological surveys and the need for further investigation underline the complex nature of this region.

<text>Unilineality is a system of determining descent groups in which one belongs to one&#x27;s father&#x27;s or mother&#x27;s line, whereby one&#x27;s descent is traced either exclusively through male ancestors (patriline), or exclusively through female ancestors (matriline). Both patrilineality and matrilineality are types of unilineal descent. The main types of the unilineal descent groups are lineages and clans.

A lineage is a unilineal descent group that can demonstrate their common descent from a known apical ancestor. It is also called the simple unilineal descent.

== Unilineal descent organization and deep Christianization ==

Recent research on the unilineal descent organization has studied variables that are usually regarded as the main causes of the decline of unilineal descent organization – viz. statehood, class stratification and commercialization – along with one not previously considered: deep Christianization, defined here as having been Christianized over 500 years before ethnographic study. The research demonstrated that the traditionally accepted causes of the decline are less significant than deep Christianization, while the presence of unilineal descent groups correlates negatively with communal democracy and is especially strong for complex traditional societies. Its conclusion is that as , Christianization might have contributed to the development of modern democracy by helping to replace unilineal descent organization in Europe.

<text>Hollum is the largest village on Ameland, Netherlands, one of the West Frisian Islands. It is situated on the westernmost part of the island and had, as of January 2017, a population of 1,165.

The village was first mentioned in 1485 as Hollum, and could mean &quot;settlement on a hill/island&quot;, however there are more possiblities. Hollum developed as an &quot;esdorp&quot; in the Late Middle Ages. It was originally two settlements which have grown together.

==Culture==
Prominent in the village is a Dutch Reformed church with foundations from the 12th century and a lighthouse, which is 59 m high, dating from 1880. Another notable feature is the &quot;Commandeur huuskes&quot;. &quot;Commandeur&quot; refers to the captain of a whaling ship, as were used during the 18th century to hunt in the Arctic Ocean.

Another notable tourist attraction is the &quot;Sorgdragersmuseum&quot;, a history museum. The smock mill &quot;De Verwachting&quot; is in working order.

<text>The Gardiner Dam on the South Saskatchewan River in Saskatchewan is the third largest embankment dam in Canada and one of the largest embankment dams in the world. Construction on Gardiner Dam and the smaller Qu&#x27;Appelle River Dam was started in 1959 and completed in 1967, creating Lake Diefenbaker upstream and diverting a considerable portion of the South Saskatchewan&#x27;s flow into the Qu&#x27;Appelle River. The dam rises 64 metres (209 feet) in height, is almost long and has a width of at its base with a volume of 65,000,000 cubic meters. The dam is owned and operated by the Saskatchewan Water Security Agency.

Two main gravity fed aqueducts (canals) from the lake were built in 1967 as part of the &quot;South Saskatchewan River Project&quot; to supply water to downstream reservoirs for irrigation, drinking water, and industrial uses. The Westside Irrigation Project supplies water to the west side of the South Saskatchewan River and the Eastside Irrigation Project supplies water to the east side of the South Saskatchewan River. Notable reservoirs on the Eastside Irrigation Project include Broderick Reservoir, Brightwater Reservoir, Blackstrap Lake, Bradwell Reservoir, and Zelma Reservoir. On July 2, 2020, Premier Scott Moe announced a 10-year, $4 billion irrigation expansion project that would increase the amount of land irrigated from Lake Diefenbaker to up to 500,000 acres. Phase one and two of the project will rehabilitate and expand the existing Westside Irrigation canal system. Phase three will see a system built south from the Qu&#x27;Appelle River Dam called the Qu’Appelle South Irrigation Project.

Danielson Provincial Park has property on both sides of the dam. On the north-east end is the RV park and on the south-west end is a beach, restaurant, and guided tours of the Coteau Creek Hydroelectric Station. The park was named after Gustaf Herman Danielson (former Saskatchewan Liberal Party MLA).

An integrated power generating plant, SaskPower&#x27;s Coteau Creek Hydroelectric Station, produces a net 186 MW of electricity from three 62 MW generators. Highway 44 crosses the river atop the dam.

The dam is named for a former Premier of Saskatchewan and longtime federal cabinet minister, James G. Gardiner.

<doc id="680047" wikidata="Q7875470" url="?curid=680047" title="USS Whipple (FF-1062)">
<text>USS &quot;Whipple&quot; (DE-1062/FF-1062) was a commissioned in the United States Navy from 1970 to 1995. In 2002, &quot;Whipple&quot; was donated to the Mexican Navy and renamed ARM &quot;Mina&quot; (F-214).

==Construction==
&quot;Whipple&quot; was the third ship of the United States Navy named in honor of Captain Abraham Whipple (1733–1819), who served in the Continental Navy. She was laid down on 24 April 1967 at Seattle, Washington, by the Todd Shipyards Corporation; launched on 12 April 1968; sponsored by Mrs. Kirkland B. Alexander; and commissioned on 22 August 1970.

&quot;Whipple&quot; conducted sea trials from 24 to 26 September before returning to the Puget Sound Navy Yard, Bremerton, Washington, for fitting-out availability from 27 to 30 September. On 1 October, the escort ship proceeded to Nanoose Bay, British Columbia, for a visit prior to further trials at Carr Inlet, Washington.

==Operational history==

===1970–1972===
On 9 October, the ship got underway for San Diego and made port four days later. &quot;Whipple&quot; departed the west coast on 16 October, bound for her new home port, Pearl Harbor, and duty with the Cruiser-Destroyer Force, Pacific Fleet. Soon after her arrival on 22 October, she commenced local operations in the Hawaiian area which lasted until 20 November when she tied up alongside tender for availability which ran until 4 December.

Five days later, while engaged in local operations, the destroyer escort investigated an unidentified submarine contact off the Barking Sands Missile Test Range, Kauai. Following that hunt, &quot;Whipple&quot; resumed local cruising through 20 December. Returning to her home port the following day, the escort ship commenced a holiday upkeep period which lasted through 13 January 1971. She then conducted weapons trials off Hawaii before undergoing preshake-down tests.

On 8 February, &quot;Whipple&quot; commenced shakedown which included underway training exercises and the ship&#x27;s first battle problem. Termination of the shakedown period on 19 March was soon followed by availability at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. On 1 April—while undergoing yard work which lasted into July—the escort ship was assigned to newly formed Destroyer Squadron (DesRon) 33.

After sea trials in late August, the ship commenced weapons trials. From 4 to 10 October, the ship performed plane-guard duties for the aircraft carrier , while additionally conducting antiaircraft and surface gunnery exercises. A dependents&#x27; cruise to Lahaina, a Navy Day &quot;open house,&quot; and host-ship duties to Australian destroyer occupied &quot;Whipple&quot; through 25 October, after which time she conducted further trials and gunnery shoots.

&quot;Whipple&quot; underwent upkeep for the first four days of November before she got underway on 5 November for the filming of the at-sea phase of a &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; television episode. From 8 to 18 November, &quot;Whipple&quot; participated in SEATO exercise RIMPAC-4, conducting antisubmarine warfare exercises in company with Australian, New Zealand, Canadian, Japanese, and American units.

Following her return to Hawaiian waters, &quot;Whipple&quot; conducted further trials and began preparations for a Western Pacific (WestPac) deployment. On 27 January 1972, &quot;Whipple&quot; departed Pearl Harbor in company with the rest of DesRon 33 and proceeded via Midway and Guam to the Philippines. The ship&#x27;s subsequent Manila stopover, where she made port on 13 February, coincided with the initial work-up phase for SEATO exercise &quot;Seahawk.&quot; Naval forces of the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, and Thailand, as well as the United States, participated in these exercises. Accordingly, &quot;Whipple&quot;, in company with Australian carrier , took part in the simulated convoy escort operation.

Upon detachment from &quot;Seahawk,&quot; &quot;Whipple&quot; stopped at Subic Bay for maintenance prior to proceeding to the Gulf of Tonkin to relieve the destroyer as Positive Identification and Radar Advisory Zone (PIRAZ) ship. After taking up station on 28 February, &quot;Whipple&quot; performed escort duties besides conducting her regular patrols. Her PIRAZ work during this time was light, as reduced air activity over North Vietnam was accomplished by low visibility and a cancellation of many scheduled flights. While &quot;Whipple&quot; operated in company with the destroyer on PIRAZ duties, the escort ship&#x27;s electronic &quot;eyes&quot; maintained the air &quot;picture&quot; for the northern half of the Gulf of Tonkin. The destroyer escort next took up plane-guard duties for the carrier before providing gunfire support in Military Region 1 for the South Vietnamese Army&#x27;s 3d Division. &quot;Whipple&quot; conducted 52 missions and expended 2,361 rounds of 5-inch ammunition.

Night harassment and interdiction fire against unobserved area targets comprised the majority of the missions. On some occasions, &quot;Whipple&quot; operated in conjunction with aerial spotters who directed the destroyer escort&#x27;s fire on enemy troop movements, coastal defense guns, artillery sites, and tanks. During &quot;Whipple&quot;″s first gunfire support assignment on 11 April, the ship twice dueled enemy shore guns, with enemy shells impacting within 150 and of the ship. For this action, &quot;Whipple&quot; received the Combat Action Ribbon.

From 20 to 24 April, &quot;Whipple&quot; received repairs to her gun from the repair ship and Mobile Technical Unit 13. Moored alongside the repair ship in Danang harbor in the daytime, the ship would patrol off the harbor mouth in the evening. Upon completion of gun repairs, the escort ship joined for &quot;Freedom Porch&quot; strikes.

After a brief period planeguarding on &quot;Dixie&quot; and &quot;Yankee&quot; stations for &quot;Hancock&quot;, &quot;Whipple&quot; received a needed upkeep at Danang from 3 to 10 May while the destroyer tender replaced the escort&#x27;s gun. She then returned to &quot;Yankee&quot; Station where she once more operated with &quot;Hancock&quot;, conducting escort and plane-guarding operations through June.

Following availability at Subic Bay and a visit to Hong Kong, &quot;Whipple&quot; returned to the line and provided gunfire support in the vicinity of Point &quot;Claudia&quot; for the Republic of Vietnam&#x27;s 1st and 3d Divisions. From 17 to 25 June, she fired harassment and interdiction missions at night and made runs during daylight hours in which she was aided by OV-1 Mohawks which pinpointed enemy bunker complexes, rocket sites, and supply routes. On 26 June, &quot;Whipple&quot; moved north to the vicinity of Point &quot;Allison&quot; to provide gunfire support for Operation LAM SON 72. Coastal defense sites in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and point targets in the Cua Viet River region felt the sting of salvos she fired in preparation for a South Vietnamese Marine Corps counter-offensive. Continuing to provide gunfire support for LAM SON 72, &quot;Whipple&quot; received a call for help at dusk on 5 July. Vietnamese marines—under heavy attack by tank-supported North Vietnamese Army infantry—radioed for immediate assistance. The escort ship—the first ship in the vicinity to do so—soon answered the call. Newport News (CA-148) subsequently opened fire with her guns to parry the North Vietnamese thrust.

&quot;Whipple&quot; returned to planeguarding duties from 9 to 17 July—this time for —and continued combat operations in the Gulf of Tonkin. Following this duty, the escort ship returned to Subic Bay on the 18th for upkeep which lasted until 27 July, when the ship departed Philippine waters, bound for Vietnam. En route, heavy seas damaged the fiberglass gun shield, forcing a change of plans and a return to Subic Bay.

Following in-port repairs, &quot;Whipple&quot; joined Task Group (TG) 77.6—based around the carrier —bound for Yankee Station. Upon relief by the destroyer as screen commander, &quot;Whipple&quot; put about for the Philippines and joined her squadron mates for the homeward-bound voyage to Pearl Harbor. After stops en route at Guam and Midway for fuel, the destroyer escort made port at Pearl Harbor on 25 August. Underway training, convoy and antisubmarine warfare exercises, and testing of the ship&#x27;s ASROC occupied &quot;Whipple&quot; during October. November and December saw the ship undergo restricted availability at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard.

===1973–1977===
&quot;Whipple&quot; conducted post-availability shakedown in January 1973 and commenced a period of routine training and exercises which continued until 14 May when the destroyer escort departed Pearl Harbor for her second WestPac deployment. She proceeded to Japan and arrived at Yokosuka on 24 May. Two days later, &quot;Whipple&quot; sailed for Taiwan and arrived there on 30 May. Availability alongside tender preceded the escort ship&#x27;s deployment in Vietnamese waters, and she departed Taiwan on 5 June, bound for &quot;Yankee Station.&quot;

Deployed as picket-escort from 8 to 30 June in the Gulf of Tonkin, &quot;Whipple&quot; returned to Subic Bay for repairs to her rudder. The destroyer escort conducted sea trials before once more returning to &quot;Yankee Station&quot; as an escort for the carrier .

&quot;Whipple&quot; visited Hong Kong from 1 to 8 August and screened &quot;Coral Sea&quot; back to Subic Bay before returning to Tonkin Gulf for picket-escort and PIRAZ duties. This line deployment concluded on 6 September when the vessel departed for upkeep at Singapore.

Following her return to the Philippines, the ship took part in Amphibious Exercise PEGASA II, off Mindoro. At its conclusion on 2 October, &quot;Whipple&quot; headed toward &quot;Yankee Station&quot; for another deployment as picket. During that assignment, typhoons Nora and Opal swirled through the Tonkin Gulf giving &quot;Whipple&quot; plenty of experience in storm evasion.

Following a return to Subic Bay for upkeep, &quot;Whipple&quot; made a 21-day, round-trip voyage to Colombo, Sri Lanka, to &quot;show the flag.&quot; On the passage to Colombo, she carried several tons of bulk foodstuffs and miscellaneous supplies for the small American community in Sri Lanka. Once the escort ship arrived at Colombo, she served as central mailing point for Christmas packages from the Americans there to friends and relatives in the United States and elsewhere. After departing Sri Lanka on 31 October, &quot;Whipple&quot; proceeded to the Philippines and arrived at Subic Bay on 8 November to prepare for a voyage home. She got underway on 20 November; made brief stops at Guam and Midway for refueling; and, in company with her squadron mates, steamed single-file into Pearl Harbor on 7 December. The destroyer escort spent the remainder of the year 1973 in a leave and upkeep stand-down period. &quot;Whipple&quot; resumed local operations out of Pearl Harbor and engaged in routine exercises, inspections, and maneuvers through August. Early in September 1974, the ship commenced preparations for her third WestPac deployment and, on 1 October, got underway for Subic Bay.

Arriving on 16 October, the destroyer escort conducted type training exercises in the Philippines from 23 to 26 October before receiving orders to make for Ambon, Indonesia, for a &quot;showing-the-flag&quot; and goodwill mission (U.S. Navy Project Handclasp). On 27 October, the ship departed Subic and headed south in the teeth of a typhoon. Upon making port at Ambon on the morning of 1 November, &quot;Whipple&quot; began carrying out the diplomacy of a goodwill visit. Her crew distributed &quot;Project-Handclasp&quot; material, painted a school, and topped off her visit with an unusual and time-consuming refuelling operation—a three-day, round-the-clock affair—utilizing tanker trucks. Underway again on 4 November, &quot;Whipple&quot; made for Subic Bay once more. After arriving at the Philippine base on 8 November, the destroyer escort commenced restricted availability which lasted until 16 November when the ship sailed for Kaohsiung, Taiwan.

&quot;Whipple&quot; undertook ASW operations out of Kaohsiung before proceeding via Subic Bay to Hong Kong. The escort ship arrived at the British Crown Colony on 2 December before once more heading for Philippine waters where she remained for the remainder of the year 1974. After celebrating New Year&#x27;s 1975 at Subic Bay, &quot;Whipple&quot; proceeded to Buckner Bay, Okinawa, for local operations which lasted through 10 January. Upon reaching Philippine waters three days later, &quot;Whipple&quot; joined Task Group 77.5, consisting of &quot;Coral Sea&quot;, , and , in local Philippine operating areas.

Detached from TG 77.5 on 27 January, &quot;Whipple&quot; conducted ASW exercises with before rejoining &quot;Coral Sea&quot; and planeguarding and steaming in company with the carrier through 2 February. After one week in port, &quot;Whipple&quot; steamed out of Subic Bay on 9 February, bound for Pearl Harbor. Resuming local operations in the Hawaiian area after her return on 22 February, &quot;Whipple&quot; conducted routine exercises and maneuvers through the summer of the year. On 1 July 1975, &quot;Whipple&#x27;s&quot; designation was changed to FF-1062 during a Navy-wide reclassification. On August, &quot;Whipple&quot; entered Drydock No. 4 at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for a major overhaul which was to include reconfiguring her superstructure to accommodate a LAMPS system.

&quot;Whipple&quot; completed overhaul on 24 March 1976. The ensuing months were spent in refresher training in the Hawaiian area where the ship obtained certification over the full range of her weapons and propulsion systems. The period October to December was spent in preparation for a forthcoming deployment to the western Pacific. On 3 January 1977, &quot;Whipple&quot; departed on her fourth deployment since commissioning. From that date until her return to Pearl Harbor, the frigate operated as a part of the 7th Fleet in various advanced exercises. Following post-deployment standdown, &quot;Whipple&quot; resumed training operations in the Hawaiian area until December when she entered the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for a restricted availability.

===1978–1995===
Completing her repair work on 3 February 1978, &quot;Whipple&quot; resumed the pattern of operations out of her home port which she had assumed following the previous deployment. On 3 April, the ship departed Hawaii for a four-nation naval exercise, &quot;RIMPAC &#x27;78&quot;, which took place in the Central Pacific. She returned on 22 April. Further exercises followed as the ship prepared for another extended deployment to the western Pacific. &quot;Whipple&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 24 June (HSL-37 Detachment 1 embarked). During the period 5 to 10 July, &quot;Whipple&quot; made the first visit to Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands, by a United States Navy ship since 1957. For most of the remainder of the year, the ship operated with the 7th Fleet throughout the reaches of the western Pacific. On 22 August 1978, the crew of &quot;Whipple&quot; rescued 410 Vietnamese refugees from a rickety boat in a storm-tossed South China Sea. The rescue was performed without any injuries more serious than bruises. Of these 410, half were under the age of 16. As &quot;Whipple&quot; turned and dipped into the seas for Hong Kong, one of the English-speaking refugees sloshed through the radar room with an escort to the bridge for an interview with the captain. &quot;After 3 days of hiding in the woods near Vung-Tao, four stormy days at sea, and growing cracks in the hull, they were waiting to die. In addition, not one of these individuals was a mariner. No one knew how to properly sail a vessel.&quot;

Two days later, &quot;Whipple&quot; entered Junk Bay, Hong Kong, and transferred the refugees to the U.N. High Commission for refugees. The incident attracted international attention. &quot;Whipple&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 15 December having met all operational commitments during her deployment. &quot;Whipple&quot; received two battle stars for service in Vietnam.

=== 1998 Movie cameo ===
In the summer of 1998, while undergoing the decommissioning process, &quot;Whipple&quot; remained anchored at Pearl Harbor awaiting her outbound transfer to the inactive fleet. During this time, she briefly took part in the filming of the hit motion picture &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; by Michael Bay, in which she can be seen in various shots throughout the harbor air bombing scenes.

===Transfer to Mexico===

&quot;Whipple&quot; was decommissioned on 14 February 1992 and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 11 January 1995. She was subsequently donated to the Mexican Navy and renamed ARM &quot;Mina&quot; (F-214).

==In popular culture==

&quot;Whipple&quot; appeared in Season 4, Episode 23, of &quot;Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)&quot;, titled, &quot;Follow the White Brick Road,&quot; as the fictional USS John Haskell.

<text>The Second Sex () is a 1949 book by the French existentialist philosopher Simone de Beauvoir, in which the author discusses the treatment of women in the present society as well as throughout all of history. Beauvoir researched and wrote the book in about 14 months between 1946 and 1949. She published the work in two volumes: &quot;Facts and Myths&quot;, and &quot;Lived Experience&quot;. Some chapters first appeared in the journal &quot;Les Temps modernes&quot;.

One of Beauvoir&#x27;s best-known and controversial books (banned by the Vatican), &quot;The Second Sex&quot; is regarded as a groundbreaking work of feminist philosophy, and as the starting inspiration point of second-wave feminism.

== Summary ==

=== Volume One ===

Beauvoir asks, &quot;What is woman?&quot; She argues that man is considered the default, while woman is considered the &quot;Other&quot;: &quot;Thus, humanity is male, and man defines woman not herself, but as relative to him.&quot; Beauvoir describes the relationship of ovum to sperm in various creatures (fish, insects, mammals), leading up to the human being. She describes women&#x27;s subordination to the species in terms of reproduction, compares the physiology of men and women, concluding that values cannot be based on physiology and that the facts of biology must be viewed in light of the ontological, economic, social, and physiological context.

Authors whose views Beauvoir rejects include Sigmund Freud and Alfred Adler, and Friedrich Engels. Beauvoir argues that while Engels, in his &quot;The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State&quot; (1884), maintained that &quot;the great historical defeat of the female sex&quot; is the result of the invention of bronze and the emergence of private property, his claims are unsupported.

According to Beauvoir, two factors explain the evolution of women&#x27;s condition: participation in production, and freedom from reproductive slavery. Beauvoir writes that motherhood left woman &quot;riveted to her body&quot;, like an animal, and made it possible for men to dominate her and Nature. She describes man&#x27;s gradual domination of women, starting with the statue of a female Great Goddess found in Susa, and eventually the opinion of ancient Greeks.&quot; Men succeed in the world by transcendence, but immanence is the lot of women. Beauvoir writes that men oppress women when they seek to perpetuate the family and keep patrimony intact. She compares women&#x27;s situation in ancient Greece with Rome. In Greece, with exceptions like Sparta where there were no restraints on women&#x27;s freedom, women were treated almost like slaves. In Rome, because men were still the masters, women enjoyed more rights, but, still discriminated against on the basis of their sex, had only empty freedom.

Discussing Christianity, Beauvoir argues that, with the exception of the German tradition, it and its clergy have served to subordinate women. She also describes prostitution and the changes in dynamics brought about by courtly love that occurred about the twelfth century. Beauvoir describes, from the early fifteenth century, &quot;great Italian ladies and courtesans&quot;, and singles out the Spaniard Teresa of Ávila as successfully raising &quot;herself as high as a man&quot;. Through the nineteenth century, women&#x27;s legal status remained unchanged, but individuals (like Marguerite de Navarre) excelled by writing and acting. Some men helped women&#x27;s status through their works. Beauvoir finds fault with the Napoleonic Code, criticizes Auguste Comte and Honoré de Balzac, and describes Pierre-Joseph Proudhon as an anti-feminist. The Industrial Revolution of the nineteenth century gave women an escape from their homes, but they were paid little for their work. Beauvoir traces the growth of trade unions and participation by women. She examines the spread of birth control methods and the history of abortion. Beauvoir relates the history of women&#x27;s suffrage, and writes that women like Rosa Luxemburg and Marie Curie &quot;brilliantly demonstrate that it is not women&#x27;s inferiority that has determined their historical insignificance: It is their historical insignificance that has doomed them to inferiority&quot;.

Beauvoir provides a presentation about the &quot;everlasting disappointment&quot; of women, for the most part from a male heterosexual&#x27;s point of view. She covers female menstruation, virginity, and female sexuality, including copulation, marriage, motherhood, and prostitution. To illustrate man&#x27;s experience of the &quot;horror of feminine fertility&quot;, Beauvoir quotes the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; of 1878 in which a member of the British Medical Association writes, &quot;It is an indisputable fact that meat goes bad when touched by menstruating women.&quot; She quotes poetry by André Breton, Léopold Sédar Senghor, Michel Leiris, Paul Verlaine, Edgar Allan Poe, Paul Valéry, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and William Shakespeare, along with other novels, philosophers, and films. Beauvoir writes that sexual division is maintained in homosexuality.

Examining the work of Henry de Montherlant, D. H. Lawrence, Paul Claudel, André Breton,
and Stendhal, Beauvoir writes that these &quot;examples show that the great collective myths are reflected in each singular writer&quot;. &quot;Feminine devotion is demanded as a duty by Montherlant and Lawrence; less arrogant, Claudel, Breton, and Stendhal admire it as a generous choice...&quot; For each of them, the ideal woman is the one who more exactly embodies the &quot;Other&quot; capable of revealing it to himself. Montherlant seeks pure animality in women; Lawrence demands that she summarizes the female gender in her femininity; Claudel calls her soul-sister; Breton trusts the woman-child; Stendhal is looking for an equal. She finds that woman is &quot;the &quot;privileged Other&quot;&quot;, that &quot;Other&quot; is defined in the &quot;way the &quot;One&quot; chooses to posit himself&quot;, and writes that, &quot;But the only earthly destiny reserved to the woman equal, child-woman, soul sister, woman-sex, and female animal is always man.&quot; Beauvoir writes that, &quot;The absence or insignificance of the female element in a body of work is symptomatic... It loses importance in a period like ours in which each individual&#x27;s particular problems are of secondary import.&quot;

Beauvoir writes that &quot;mystery&quot; is prominent among men&#x27;s myths about women. She also writes that mystery is not confined by sex to women, but, instead, by situation, and that it pertains to any slave. She thinks it disappeared during the eighteenth century when men, however briefly, considered women to be peers. She quotes Arthur Rimbaud, who writes that, hopefully, one day, women can become fully human beings when man gives her her freedom.

=== Volume Two ===

Presenting a child&#x27;s life beginning with birth, Beauvoir contrasts a girl&#x27;s upbringing with a boy&#x27;s, who at age 3 or 4 is told he is a &quot;little man&quot;. A girl is taught to be a woman and her &quot;feminine&quot; destiny is imposed on her by society. She has no innate &quot;maternal instinct&quot;. A girl comes to believe in and to worship a male god and to create imaginary adult lovers. The discovery of sex is a &quot;phenomenon as painful as weaning&quot; and she views it with disgust. When she discovers that men, not women, are the masters of the world this &quot;imperiously modifies her consciousness of herself&quot;. Beauvoir describes puberty, the beginning of menstruation, and the way girls imagine sex with a man. She relates several ways that girls in their late teens accept their &quot;femininity&quot;, which may include running away from home, fascination with the disgusting, following nature, or stealing. Beauvoir describes sexual relations with men, maintaining that the repercussions of the first of these experiences informs a woman&#x27;s whole life. Beauvoir describes women&#x27;s sexual relations with women. She writes that &quot;homosexuality is no more a deliberate perversion than a fatal curse&quot;.

Beauvoir writes that &quot;to ask two spouses bound by practical, social and moral ties to satisfy each other sexually for their whole lives is pure absurdity&quot;. She describes the work of married women, including housecleaning, writing that it is &quot;holding away death but also refusing life&quot;. She thinks, &quot;what makes the lot of the wife-servant ungratifying is the division of labor that dooms her wholly to the general and inessential&quot;. Beauvoir writes that a woman finds her dignity only in accepting her vassalage which is bed &quot;service&quot; and housework &quot;service&quot;. A woman is weaned away from her family and finds only &quot;disappointment&quot; on the day after her wedding. Beauvoir points out various inequalities between a wife and husband who find themselves in a threesome and finds they pass the time not in love but in &quot;conjugal love&quot;. She thinks that marriage &quot;almost always destroys woman&quot;. She quotes Sophia Tolstoy who wrote in her diary: &quot;you are stuck there forever and there you must sit&quot;. Beauvoir thinks marriage is a perverted institution oppressing both men and women.

In Beauvoir&#x27;s view, abortions performed legally by doctors would have little risk to the mother. She argues that the Catholic Church cannot make the claim that the souls of the unborn would not end up in heaven because of their lack of baptism because that would be contradictory to other Church teachings. She writes that the issue of abortion is not an issue of morality but of &quot;masculine sadism&quot; toward woman. Beauvoir describes pregnancy, which is viewed as both a gift and a curse to woman. In this new creation of a new life the woman loses her self, seeing herself as &quot;no longer anything ... [but] a passive instrument&quot;. Beauvoir writes that, &quot;maternal sadomasochism creates guilt feelings for the daughter that will express themselves in sadomasochistic behavior toward her own children, without end&quot;, and makes an appeal for socialist child rearing practices.

Beauvoir describes a woman&#x27;s clothes, her girl friends and her relationships with men. She writes that &quot;marriage, by frustrating women&#x27;s erotic satisfaction, denies them the freedom and individuality of their feelings, drives them to adultery&quot;. Beauvoir describes prostitutes and their relationships with pimps and with other women, as well as hetaeras. In contrast to prostitutes, hetaeras can gain recognition as an individual and if successful can aim higher and be publicly distinguished. Beauvoir writes that women&#x27;s path to menopause might arouse woman&#x27;s homosexual feelings (which Beauvoir thinks are latent in most women). When she agrees to grow old she becomes elderly with half of her adult life left to live. A woman might choose to live through her children (often her son) or her grandchildren but she faces &quot;solitude, regret, and ennui&quot;. To pass her time she might engage in useless &quot;women&#x27;s handiwork&quot;, watercolors, music or reading, or she might join charitable organizations. While a few rare women are committed to a cause and have an end in mind, Beauvoir concludes that &quot;the highest form of freedom a woman-parasite can have is stoic defiance or skeptical irony&quot;.

According to Beauvoir, while a woman knows how to be as active, effective and silent as a man, her situation keeps her being &quot;useful&quot;, preparing food, clothes, and lodging. She worries because she does not &quot;do&quot; anything, she complains, she cries, and she may threaten suicide. She protests but doesn&#x27;t escape her lot. Women demand a &quot;Good&quot; that is a living &quot;Harmony&quot; and in which she rests, just because they live. The concept of harmony is one of the keys to the female universe, it implies the perfection of immobility, the immediate justification of each element in the light of the whole, and her passive participation in the totality. In a harmonious way, women thus achieve what men seek in action, as illustrated by Virginia Woolf&#x27;s &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot; and &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot;, and Katherine Mansfield&#x27;s magnum opus. Beauvoir thinks it is pointless to try to decide whether a woman is superior or inferior, and that it is obvious that the man&#x27;s situation is &quot;infinitely preferable&quot;. She writes, &quot;for woman there is no other way out than to work for her liberation&quot;.

Beauvoir describes narcissistic women, who might find themselves in a mirror and in the theater, and women in and outside marriage: &quot;The day when it will be possible for the woman to love in her strength and not in her weakness, not to escape from herself but to find herself, not out of resignation but to affirm herself, love will become for her as for man the source of life and not a mortal danger.&quot; Beauvoir discusses the lives of several women, some of whom developed stigmata. Beauvoir writes that these women may develop a relation &quot;with an unreal: her double or god; or she creates an unreal relation with a real being...&quot;. She also mentions women with careers who are able to escape sadism and masochism. A few women have successfully reached a state of equality, and Beauvoir, in a footnote, singles out the example of Clara and Robert Schumann. Beauvoir says that the goals of wives can be overwhelming: as a wife tries to be elegant, a good housekeeper and a good mother. Singled out are &quot;actresses, dancers and singers&quot; who may achieve independence. Among writers, Beauvoir chooses only Emily Brontë, Woolf and (&quot;sometimes&quot;) Mary Webb (and she mentions Colette and Mansfield) as among those who have tried to approach nature &quot;in its inhuman freedom&quot;. Beauvoir then says that women don&#x27;t &quot;challenge the human condition&quot; and that in comparison to the few &quot;greats&quot;, a woman comes out as &quot;mediocre&quot; and will continue at that level for quite some time. A woman could not have been Vincent van Gogh or Franz Kafka. Beauvoir thinks that perhaps, of all women, only Saint Teresa lived her life for herself. She says it is &quot;high time&quot; a woman &quot;be left to take her own chances&quot;.

In her conclusion, Beauvoir looks forward to a future when women and men are equals, something the &quot;Soviet revolution &quot;promised&quot;&quot; but did not ever deliver. She concludes that, &quot;to carry off this supreme victory, men and women must, among other things and beyond their natural differentiations, unequivocally affirm their brotherhood.&quot;

== Reception and influence ==

The first French publication of &quot;The Second Sex&quot; sold around 22,000 copies in a week. It has since been translated into 40 languages. The Vatican placed the book on its &quot;List of Prohibited Books&quot;. The sex researcher Alfred Kinsey was critical of &quot;The Second Sex&quot;, holding that while it was interesting as a work of literature, it was of no value to science. In 1960, Beauvoir wrote that &quot;The Second Sex&quot; was an attempt to explain &quot;why a woman&#x27;s situation, still, even today, prevents her from exploring the world&#x27;s basic problems.&quot; In a 1974 interview, she remembered that &quot;Camus was furious; he reacted with typical Mediterranean machismo, saying I had ridiculed the French male. Professors hurled the book across the room. People sniggered at me in restaurants. The fact [that] I had spoken about female sexuality was absolutely scandalous at the time. Men kept drawing attention to the vulgarity of the book, essentially because they were furious at what the book was suggesting—equality between the sexes&quot;. The attack on psychoanalysis in &quot;The Second Sex&quot; helped to inspire subsequent feminist arguments against psychoanalysis, including those of Betty Friedan&#x27;s &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; (1963), Kate Millett&#x27;s &quot;Sexual Politics&quot; (1969), and Germaine Greer&#x27;s &quot;The Female Eunuch&quot; (1970). Millett commented in 1989 that she did not realize the extent to which she was influenced by Beauvoir when she wrote &quot;Sexual Politics&quot;.

Philosopher Judith Butler sees &quot;The Second Sex&quot; as potentially providing a radical understanding of gender. They argue that Beauvoir&#x27;s formulation that &quot;One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman&quot; distinguishes the terms &quot;sex&quot; and &quot;gender&quot;, and that the book suggests that &quot;gender&quot; is an aspect of identity which is &quot;gradually acquired&quot;. This reading is contested by Toril Moi, among others. Borde and Malovany-Chevallier, in their complete English version, translated this formulation as &quot;One is not born, but rather becomes, woman&quot; because in this context (one of many different usages of &quot;woman&quot; in the book), the word is used by Beauvoir to mean woman as a construct or an idea, rather than woman as an individual or one of a group.

Biographer Deirdre Bair, writing in her &quot;Introduction to the Vintage Edition&quot; in 1989, relates that &quot;one of the most sustained criticisms&quot; has been that Beauvoir is &quot;guilty of unconscious misogyny&quot;, that she separated herself from women while writing about them. Bair writes that French writer Francis Jeanson and British poet Stevie Smith made similar criticisms: in Smith&#x27;s words, &quot;She has written an enormous book about women and it is soon clear that she does not like them, nor does she like being a woman.&quot; Bair also quotes British scholar C. B. Radford&#x27;s view that Beauvoir was &quot;guilty of painting women in her own colors&quot; because &quot;The Second Sex&quot; is &quot;primarily a middle-class document, so distorted by autobiographical influences that the individual problems of the writer herself may assume an exaggerated importance in her discussion of femininity.

American theorist David M. Halperin criticizes Beauvoir&#x27;s idealizing portrayal of sexual relations between women in &quot;The Second Sex&quot;. Critic Camille Paglia praised &quot;The Second Sex&quot;, calling it &quot;brilliant&quot; and &quot;the supreme work of modern feminism.&quot; Paglia writes that most modern feminists are merely &quot;repeating, amplifying or qualifying&quot; &quot;The Second Sex&quot; without realising their debt to it. In &quot;Free Women, Free Men&quot; (2017) Paglia writes that as a sixteen-year-old, she was &quot;stunned by de Beauvoir&#x27;s imperious, authoritative tone and ambitious sweep through space and time&quot;, which helped inspire her to write her work of literary criticism &quot;Sexual Personae&quot; (1990).

== Censorship ==

The Spanish-language translation of &quot;The Second Sex&quot; (printed in Argentina) was banned in Francoist Spain in 1955. Spanish feminists smuggled in copies of the book and circulated it in secret. A full Castilian Spanish translation of &quot;The Second Sex&quot; was published in 1998.

The Catholic Church&#x27;s Vatican-based leadership condemned &quot;The Second Sex&quot; and added the book in its list of prohibited books, known as &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum.&quot; The book remained banned until the policy of prohibition itself was abolished in 1966.

== Cultural repercussions ==

The rise of second wave feminism in the United States spawned by Betty Friedan’s book, &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot;, which was inspired by Simone de Beauvoir’s, &quot;The Second Sex,&quot; took significantly longer to reach and impact the lives of European women. Even though &quot;The Second Sex&quot; was published in 1949 and &quot;Feminine Mystique&quot; was published in 1963, the French were concerned that expanding equality to include matters of the family was detrimental to French morals. In 1966, abortion in Europe was still illegal and contraception was extremely difficult to access. Many were afraid that legalization would &quot;take from men &#x27;the proud consciousness of their virility&#x27; and make women &#x27;no more than objects of sterile voluptuousness&#x27;&quot;. The French Parliament in 1967 decided to legalize contraception but only under strict qualifications.

Social feminists then went further to claim that women “were fundamentally different from men in psychology and in physiology…” and stressed gender differences rather than simply equality, demanding that women have the right of choice to stay home and raise a family, if they so desired, by issue of a financial allowance, advocated by the Catholic church, or to go into the workforce and have assistance with childcare through government mandated programs, such as nationally funded daycare facilities and parental leave. The historical context of the times was a belief that &quot;a society cut to the measure of men ill served women and harmed the overall interests of society&quot;. As a result of this push for public programs, European women became more involved in politics and by the 1990s held six to seven times more legislative seats than the United States, enabling them to influence the process in support of programs for women and children.

== Translations ==
Many commentators have pointed out that the 1953 English translation of &quot;The Second Sex&quot; by H. M. Parshley, frequently reissued, is poor. A reviewer from &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the zoologist hired to do the translation as having &quot;a college undergraduate&#x27;s knowledge of French.&quot; The delicate vocabulary of philosophical concepts is frequently mistranslated, and great swaths of the text have been excised. The English publication rights to the book are owned by Alfred A. Knopf, Inc and although the publishers had been made aware of the problems with the English text, they long stated that there was really no need for a new translation, even though Beauvoir herself explicitly requested one in a 1985 interview: &quot;I would like very much for another translation of &quot;The Second Sex&quot; to be done, one that is much more faithful; more complete and more faithful.&quot;

The publishers gave in to those requests, and commissioned a new translation to Constance Borde and Sheila Malovany-Chevallier. The result, published in November 2009, has met with generally positive reviews from literary critics, who credit Borde and Malovany-Chevallier with having diligently restored the sections of the text missing from the Parshley edition, as well as correcting many of its mistakes.

Other reviewers, however, including Toril Moi, one of the most vociferous critics of the original 1953 translation, are critical of the new edition, voicing concerns with its style, syntax and philosophical and syntactic integrity.

The &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer cites some confused English in the new edition where Parshley&#x27;s version was smoother, saying, &quot;Should we rejoice that this first unabridged edition of &#x27;The Second Sex&#x27; appears in a new translation? I, for one, do not.&quot;

<doc id="680054" wikidata="Q5042181" url="?curid=680054" title="Carlos Hernández (pitcher, born 1980)">
<text>Carlos Henrique Hernández (; born April 22, 1980) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball starting pitcher. He played for the Houston Astros of Major League Baseball (MLB) from 2001 to 2002 and 2004.

==Career==
In 2001, he suffered a partial tear of his left rotator cuff diving back to second base. Before the injury, he was 1–0 with a 1.02 ERA, allowing only 11 hits in 17.6 innings. Despite pitching in pain, Hernández again showed promise in 2002, but his season was hampered by an ongoing injury with his left shoulder. He finished 7–5 with a 4.38 ERA in 21 starts, but twice was disabled. He missed the 2003 season following surgery. In 2004, Hernández started his rehabilitation with the New Orleans Zephyrs, the Triple-A affiliate of the Astros, and finished with the big club with a 1–3 mark and a 6.43 ERA in nine starts.

After not playing baseball for anybody in 2007, Hernández signed with the Tampa Bay Rays in 2008 and was assigned to their Single-A affiliate, the Vero Beach Devil Rays, where in six starts, he went 2–1 with a 1.04 ERA.

In a three-year career, Hernández posted a 9–8 record with 136 strikeouts and a 4.54 ERA in 172.2 innings.

==Pitching style==
Hernández has a low 90s fastball, a very good curveball, a changeup, and he can throw a decent slider as well.
He is a switch hitter and throws left-handed.

<text>Miguel Joaquín Diego del Carmen Serrano Fernández (10 September 1917 – 28 February 2009), was a Chilean diplomat, writer, neopagan occultist, defender of a doctrine that supposedly would be true Christianity, the &quot;Kristianism&quot; and fascist activist. A Nazi sympathiser in the late 1930s and early 1940s, he later became a prominent figure in the neo-Nazi movement as an exponent of Esoteric Hitlerism.

Born to a wealthy Chilean family of European descent, Serrano was orphaned as a child and raised by his grandmother. After an education at the Internado Nacional Barros Arana, he developed an interest in writing and far-right politics, allying himself with the National Socialist Movement of Chile. During the Second World War, in which Chile remained neutral until 1943, Serrano campaigned in support of Nazi Germany and promoted antisemitic conspiracy theories through his own fortnightly publication, &quot;La Nueva Edad&quot;. In 1942, he joined an occult order founded by a German immigrant which combined pro-Nazi sentiment with ceremonial magic and kundalini yoga. It presented the Nazi German leader Adolf Hitler as a spiritual adept who had incarnated to Earth as a savior of the Aryan race and who would lead humanity out of a dark age known as the Kali Yuga. Serrano became convinced that Hitler had not died in 1945 but had secretly survived and was living in Antarctica. After visiting Antarctica, Serrano travelled to Germany and then Switzerland, where he met the novelist Hermann Hesse and psychoanalyst Carl Jung; in 1965, he published a reminiscence of his time with the pair.

In 1953, Serrano joined the Chilean diplomatic corps and was stationed in India until 1963, where he took a keen interest in Hinduism and wrote several books. He was later made ambassador to Yugoslavia and then Austria, and while in Europe made contacts with various former Nazis and other far-rightists living on the continent. Following Chile&#x27;s election of a Marxist President, Salvador Allende, Serrano was dismissed from the diplomatic service in 1970. After Allende was ousted in a coup and Augusto Pinochet took power, Serrano returned to Chile in 1973. He became a prominent organiser in the Chilean neo-Nazi movement, holding annual celebrations of Hitler&#x27;s birthday, organising a neo-Nazi rally in Santiago, and producing a neo-Nazi political manifesto. He wrote a trilogy of books on Hitler in which he outlined his view of the Nazi leader as an avatar. He remained in contact with neo-Nazis elsewhere in the world and gave interviews to various foreign far-right publications.

In 2008, Serrano was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award (Premio a la Trayectoria) from the Universidad Mayor of Santiago. After Savitri Devi, he has been considered the most prominent exponent of Esoteric Hitlerism within the neo-Nazi movement. In that movement, he gained respect for his devotion to the cause even among neo-Nazis who regarded his ideas as far-fetched.

==Biography==

===Childhood: 1917–1938===

Miguel Joaquín Diego del Carmen Serrano Fernández was born on 10 September 1917. On his maternal line, he was descended from the countesses of Sierra Bella. His mother, Berta Fernández Fernández, died when Serrano was five years old, while his father, Diego Serrano Manterola, died three years later. He had two younger brothers and a sister, who were then all raised by his paternal grandmother, Fresia Manterola de Serrano, moving between a Santiago townhouse and a 17th-century country mansion in the Claro Valley.

Between 1929 and 1934, he studied at the Internado Nacional Barros Arana. The school had been heavily influenced by Prussian staff members who had arrived in the late 19th century, with Serrano attributing his later Germanophilia to this early exposure to German culture. At the school he moved in literary circles. A close friend of his was Hector Barreto, a poet and socialist. Aged 18, Barreto was killed in a brawl with uniformed Nacistas, members of the National Socialist Movement of Chile, a fascist group inspired by the example of the Nazi Party in Germany. This event encouraged Serrano&#x27;s involvement in left-wing politics as he began to take an interest in Marxism and the Chilean Marxist movement. He wrote articles for leftist journals like &quot;Sobre la marcha&quot;, &quot;La Hora&quot;, and &quot;Frente Popular&quot;. His uncle, the poet Vicente Huidobro, encouraged him to join the left-wing Republicans in the ongoing Spanish Civil War, but he did not do so.

===Nazism and occultism: 1939–1952===

Serrano grew critical of Marxism and left-wing politics, instead being drawn to the Nacistas after their failed coup in September 1938. By July 1939, Serrano was publicly associating himself with the Nacista movement, now organised as the Popular Socialist Vanguard. He began writing for their journal, &quot;Trabajo&quot;, and accompanied their leader, Jorge González von Marées, on his speaking tours across Chile. At the outbreak of the Second World War, in which Chile remained neutral, Serrano expressed support for Nazi Germany; from July 1941 he launched a fortnightly pro-Nazi publication, &quot;La Nueva Edad&quot;. Among the magazine&#x27;s regular contributors were the journalist René Arriagada, General Francisco Javier Díaz, and Hugo Gallo, who was the cultural attaché at the Italian Embassy.
Through this work, Serrano developed close links with the German Embassy in Chile and its personnel.

Although Serrano had initially shown little interest in Nazi attitudes towards Jewish people, he became increasingly interested in antisemitic conspiracy theories about Jews manipulating world events. Two Chilean artists gave him a Spanish language translation of the &quot;Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;, a text purporting to expose this alleged international Jewish conspiracy. According to the historian Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, it was this discovery of the &quot;Protocols&quot; which &quot;marked a crucial point in the development of Serrano&#x27;s Nazism&quot;. From November 1941, he began printing excerpts from the &quot;Protocols&quot; in &quot;La Nueva Edad&quot;.

Serrano also developed an interest in forms of religious or spiritual practice, including both Western esotericism and Hinduism. In late 1941, Gallo suggested that Serrano could support the German and Italian war effort not just through his publications, but also on the etheric Inner Planes, introducing him to an esoteric order sympathetic to Nazism. Serrano later claimed that this order had been founded near the start of the 20th century by a German migrant known as &quot;F. K.&quot; Serrano was initiated into the group in February 1942.

F. K. claimed that the group owed its allegiance to a secretive Brahmin elite who resided in the Himalayas. It practiced combined kundalini yoga with ceremonial magic and expressed a pro-Nazi position. It espoused a belief in an astral body which could be awakened through various rituals and meditative practices. The group revered the Nazi German leader Adolf Hitler as the savior of an Aryan race and presented him as a &quot;shudibudishvabhaba&quot;, an initiate of immense willpower who had voluntarily incarnated onto Earth to assist in the overthrow of the Kali Yuga, a present dark age for humanity. F. K. claimed that through the astral realm, he was able to establish a connection with Hitler, during which they had various conversations.

As the Second World War ended in defeat for Nazi Germany in 1945, Serrano was convinced that Hitler had not committed suicide in Berlin as was claimed by the victorious Allies. Instead, Serrano believed that Hitler had escaped and was living in Antarctica, either in a secluded warm environment on the continent or under the ice cap itself. This idea had been suggested to him by F. K.—who claimed that he remained in astral contact with Hitler—but was also widely rumoured in the Latin American press. In 1947, Ladislao Szabó&#x27;s book &quot;Hitler est vivo&quot; had been published, exerting an influence on Serrano. Szabó&#x27;s book alleged that a U-boat convoy had taken Hitler to safety in Queen Maud Land. In 1947–48, Serrano travelled to Antarctica as a journalist with the Chilean Army. In 1948, he wrote his own short book, &quot;La Antártica y otros Mitos&quot;, which repeated Szabó&#x27;s claims about Hitler&#x27;s survival.

In 1951, Serrano travelled to Europe, and in Germany visited various sites associated with the Nazi Party, including Hitler&#x27;s Berlin bunker, Hitler&#x27;s Berghof home, and Spandau Prison, where Rudolf Hess and other prominent Nazis were then imprisoned. During this trip he also visited Switzerland, where he met and befriended the writer Hermann Hesse and the psychoanalyst Carl Jung.

===Diplomatic career: 1953–1970===
In 1953, Serrano—following a number of other family members—joined the Chilean diplomatic corps. He hoped to gain a posting to India, a land which he considered to be a source of great spiritual truths. He was successful in this, and remained in India until 1962. In this period, he visited many Hindu temples and searched for evidence of the secretive Brahmanical order into which F. K. had alleged initiation. In his role as a diplomat, he met various prominent figures, including Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, and the 14th Dalai Lama. It was while in India that he wrote and published two books: &quot;The Visits of the Queen of Sheba&quot; (1960), which had a preface by Jung, and &quot;The Serpent of Paradise&quot; (1963), which discussed his experiences in the country. Serrano had engaged in further correspondence with Jung between 1957 and 1961. In 1965 his book, &quot;C. J. Jung and Hermann Hesse: A Record of Two Friendships&quot;, was published.

Leaving India, from 1962 to 1964 he was posted as the Chilean ambassador to Yugoslavia. From 1964 to 1970 he then served as his country&#x27;s ambassador to Austria, for which he lived in Vienna. During the latter posting, he also represented Chile at the International Atomic Energy Agency and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, both of which were based in Vienna. While in Europe, he had sought out a number of individuals linked to Nazism and to the far-right more broadly; these included visits to the Ahnenerbe co-founder Herman Wirth, the designer and occultist Wilhelm Landig, the poet Ezra Pound, and the Traditionalist thinker Julius Evola. He established friendships with a number of individuals involved in the old Nazi movement, including Léon Degrelle, Otto Skorzeny, Hans-Ulrich Rudel, Marc &quot;Saint-Loup&quot; Augier, and Hanna Reitsch. He also discussed issues with the ancient astronaut proponent Robert Charroux.

In the 1970 Chilean presidential election, the Socialist Salvador Allende was elected president. Later that year, Serrano was dropped from the country&#x27;s diplomatic service. Rather than returning to Chile, he moved to Switzerland, renting an apartment in the Casa Camuzzi—where Hesse had lived from 1912 to 1931—at Montagnola in the Swiss Ticino.

===Later life: 1973–2009===

The loss of his diplomatic position, coupled with the establishment of a Marxist government in Chile, led Serrano to take a revived interest in Nazism. He began reading a number of recently published books that purported to identify links between Nazism and occultism. In 1973, his book &quot;El/Ella: Book of Magic Love&quot; was published. After Allende was ousted in a September 1973 coup and a right-wing military regime under Augusto Pinochet took power, Serrano returned to Chile. He nevertheless found that the Pinochet administration was not interested in his neo-Nazi and Esoteric Hitlerist ideas. In 1980, his book &quot;Nos: A Book of the Resurrection&quot; was published, a form of autobiography influenced by Jungian psychology. He also produced a trio of books that came to be known as his &quot;Hitler Trilogy&quot;: &quot;El Cordón Dorado: Hitlerismo Esotérico&quot; (1978), &quot;Adolf Hitler, el Ultimo Avatãra&quot; (1984), and &quot;Manú: &quot;Por el hombre que vendra&quot;&quot; (1991).

He increasingly associated with old Nazis living in Chile as well as with their neo-Nazi sympathisers. In May 1984 he attended the funeral of Walter Rauff—a member of the Waffen SS who had played a role in organising the early stages of the Holocaust and who had fled to Chile after the Second World War—and there gave the Nazi salute. In 1986 he published a political manifesto for Nazism in the Southern Cone of South America. He began organising annual celebrations of Hitler&#x27;s birthday at a rural retreat in Chile. In September 1993, he led a neo-Nazi rally in Santiago—dressed in what had become his trademark black leather coat—in honor of the Nazi Rudolf Hess and the Nacistas summarily executed by Chilean police officers following their 1938 coup attempt. As well as playing a role in organising the Chilean neo-Nazi movement, Serrano maintained correspondences with neo-Nazis elsewhere in the world, such as the American Matt Koehl.

Serrano was the subject of an extensive interview in the Greek far-right magazine &quot;ΤΟ ΑΝΤΙΔΟΤΟ&quot;. Here, he sought to engage a younger audience by contrasting his millennial vision of Nazism with his perception of the corruption of modern liberalism. He was also the subject of a feature in &quot;The Flaming Sword&quot;, a magazine issued by the Black Order, a neo-Nazi Satanist group established by the New Zealander Kerry Bolton. Bolton had also written his own study of Serrano&#x27;s Esoteric Hitlerism, and the Black Order&#x27;s occult framework was influenced by Serrano&#x27;s ideas.
Despite the interest that Nazi Satanists took in Serrano&#x27;s work, he was critical of attempts to combine Satanism with Nazism, in 2001 stating that individuals who did so &quot;will only damage our sacred fight with all the kookiness from California, like Satanism&quot;. He added that &quot;Many Satanists do not know that they are manipulated, psychotronically, in fact hypnotized, when not infiltrated by the CIA, Mossad and other such secret organisations.&quot;

By the early 1990s, Serrano&#x27;s Esoteric Hitlerist ideas were spreading among modern pagans, gaining particular popularity among far-right Germanic heathens in the United States.
The American Heathen Katja Lane of the Wotansvolk group secured the rights to publish English translations of Serrano&#x27;s work, with Wotansvolk becoming the main promoter of Serrano&#x27;s writings in the Anglophone world through their 14 Word Press. One of the prominent far-right Heathens to be influenced by Serrano&#x27;s ideas was Jost Turner. Another American occultist to cite an influence from Serrano&#x27;s ideas was Michael Moynihan, who also cited having been influenced by Evola, Muammar Gaddafi, Mikhail Bakunin, and James Mason.

In 1994, Serrano, a close friend of Degrelle, wrote a book dedicated to him titled &quot;Nuestro Honor Se Llama Lealtad&quot;. Serrano had three children with his first wife. On 28 February 2009, Serrano died after suffering a stroke in his apartment in the Santa Lucía Hill sector of Santiago, the capital. During his funeral at the General Cemetery, the procession paused at Irene Klatt Getta&#x27;s crypt, where his coffin and the crowd of over 100 people stopped momentarily before continuing.

==Personal life==
At the age of 25, Serrano married Carmen Rosselot Bordeau on 11 September 1942, in Santiago. They had their first son, José Miguel Diego, in 1943. He currently works as a journalist for &quot;La Tercera&quot; newspaper. In 1944, their daughter Carmen was born, and in 1948, they had another son, Cristián Alvaro. In 1951, Serrano met Irene Klatt Getta in Santiago, who played a significant role in his life and to whom he dedicated a large part of his work. However, in 1952, Irene died. Serrano expressed, &quot;From that day, I destroyed everything, any possibility of another love like that, even my own marriage. I have never been able to love anyone like Irene. I only loved Irene.&quot;

According to Andrea Sierra&#x27;s article in &quot;El Mercurio&quot;, Serrano referred to Irene as &quot;Allouine&quot; and considered her the only person he truly loved. In 1985, Carmen Rosselot Bordeau died. Sierra&#x27;s article mentions Rosario Duarte as Serrano&#x27;s first wife, while the official Serrano website does not mention her but acknowledges Serrano&#x27;s marriage to Carmen Rosselot Bordeau and a subsequent marriage to María Isabel Pérez Quintela.

In 2000, Serrano married his second wife, María Isabel Pérez Quintela, also known as Sabela P. Quintela, who currently serves as his literary executor. The wedding took place in Valparaíso. Following Serrano&#x27;s death, Quintela inherited two apartments in Santa Lucía Street, Santiago, in front of Santa Lucía Hill: Santa Lucía 282, apartment 71, and Santa Lucía 382, 6 &quot;C&quot;. Sabela first met Serrano in Spain in 1989 and moved to Chile in 1994. During those years, they shared a house in Valparaíso located at Avenida Alemania 5558.

==Reception and legacy==

The historian of religion Mattias Gardell described Serrano as &quot;one of the most important occult fascist ideologues in the Spanish-speaking world&quot;.
The historian of religion Arthur Versluis noted that Serrano was &quot;the most important figure&quot; in esoteric Hitlerism after Savitri Devi.

According to Goodrick-Clarke, Serrano&#x27;s &quot;mystical Nazism&quot; was &quot;a major example of the Thulean mythology&#x27;s successful migration to South America in the post-war period&quot;. Goodrick-Clarke thought it &quot;likely that old Nazis welcome[d] Serrano&#x27;s enthusiasm and unswerving loyalty to their hero, Adolf Hitler&quot;, even if they found the Esoteric Hitlerist mythology that he promoted to be farfetched. Conversely, Goodrick-Clarke thought, for younger neo-Nazis, &quot;a coloring of pop mythology, Hinduism, and extraterrestrial Aryan gods adds sensational appeal to the powerful myths of elitism, planetary destiny and the cosmic conspiracy of the Jews.&quot;

The historian Rafael Videla Eissman proposed that a plaque commemorating Serrano be erected on the western side of the Cerro Santa Lucía, although in June 2014 the municipality of Santiago rejected the idea. In February 2016, the newspaper &quot;La Segunda&quot; published an interview with Serrano&#x27;s grandson, Sebastián Araya, in which he discussed his relationship with his grandfather. In December 2017, the author and journalist Gonzalo León published a fictionalized novelisation of Serrano&#x27;s life.

Serrano is the subject of the 2024 film &quot;The Hyperboreans&quot; (&quot;Los hiperbóreos&quot;) by Cristobal León &amp; Joaquín Cociña.

==Ideas==
Serrano termed his philosophy Esoteric Hitlerism, which he has described as a new religious faith &quot;able to change the materialistic man of today into a new idealistic hero&quot;, and also as &quot;much more than a religion: It is a way to transmute a hero into God.&quot;

In 1984 he published his 643-page tome, &quot;Adolf Hitler, el Último Avatãra&quot; (&quot;Adolf Hitler: The Last Avatar&quot;), which is dedicated &quot;To the glory of the Führer, Adolf Hitler&quot;. In this arcane work, Serrano unfolds his ultimate philosophical testament through elaborate esoteric and mythological symbolism. He insists that there has been a vast historical conspiracy to conceal the origins of evolved humankind. Serrano&#x27;s epic vista opens with extragalactic beings who founded the First Hyperborea, a terrestrial but non-physical realm, which was neither geographically limited nor bound by the circles of reincarnation. The Hyperboreans were asexual and reproduced through &quot;plasmic emanations&quot; from their ethereal bodies; the Vril power was theirs to command, the light of the Black Sun coursed through their veins and they saw with the third eye. Serrano contends that the last documents relating to them were destroyed along with the Alexandrian Library, and that, latterly, these beings have been misunderstood as extraterrestrials arriving in spaceships or UFOs. However, the First Hyperborea was immaterial and altogether outside our mechanistic universe.

The latter is under the jurisdiction of the Demiurge, an inferior godlet whose realm is the physical planet Earth. The Demiurge had created a bestial imitation of humanity in the form of proto-human &quot;robots&quot; like Neanderthal Man, and intentionally consigned his creatures to an endless cycle of involuntary reincarnation on the earthly plane to no higher purpose. The Hyperboreans recoiled in horror from this entrapment within the Demiurge&#x27;s cycles. They themselves take the &quot;devayana&quot;, the Way of the Gods, at death and return to the earth (as Bodhisattvas) only if they are willing.

Determined upon a heroic war to reclaim the Demiurge&#x27;s deteriorating world, the Hyperboreans clothed themselves in material bodies and descended on to the Second Hyperborea, a ring-shaped continent around the North Pole. During this Golden Age or Satya Yuga, they magnanimously instructed the Demiurge&#x27;s creations (the Black, Yellow and Red races native to the planet) and began to raise them above their animal condition. Then disaster struck; some of the Hyperboreans rebelled and intermingled their blood with the creatures of the Demiurge, and through this transgression Paradise was lost. Serrano refers to Genesis 6.4: &quot;the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them&quot;. By diluting the divine blood, the primordial miscegenation accelerated the process of material decay. This was reflected in outward catastrophes and the North and South Poles reversed positions as a result of the fall of a comet or moon. The polar continent disappeared beneath the deluge and Hyperborea became invisible again. The Hyperboreans themselves survived, some taking refuge at the South Pole. Serrano regards the mysterious appearance of the fine and artistic Cro-Magnon Man in Europe as evidence of Hyperboreans driven southward by the Ice Age. In the then-fertile Gobi Desert, another group of exiled Hyperboreans established a fantastic civilization.

The world thus becomes the combat zone between the dwindling Hyperboreans and the Demiurge and his forces of entropy. But Serrano claims that the Golden Age can be reattained if the Hyperboreans&#x27; descendants, the Aryans, consciously repurify their blood to restore the divine blood-memory:

There is nothing more mysterious than blood. Paracelsus considered it a condensation of light. I believe that the Aryan, Hyperborean blood is that – but not the light of the Golden Sun, not of a galactic sun, but of the light of the Black Sun, of the Green Ray.

<text>The Qu&#x27;appelle River Dam is the smaller of two embankment dams along the South Saskatchewan River that created Lake Diefenbaker in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. The bigger of the two dams is Gardiner Dam, which is the largest embankment dam in Canada and one of the largest in the world. Construction of both dams began in 1959 and was completed in 1967. Lake Diefenbaker is the largest lake in southern Saskatchewan.

The dam is the source of the Qu&#x27;Appelle River and it keeps the flow of water down the river relatively constant. Formerly, the Qu&#x27;Appelle River dried up in many places every summer at the conclusion of the spring freshet from the Rocky Mountains. Constant, steady flows down the Qu&#x27;Appelle River are important as downstream there are several smaller dams and reservoirs that supply water for irrigation, industry (such as the Mosaic potash mine at Belle Plaine), and drinking water for cities such as Regina and Moose Jaw. The dam is long, high, and, along with the Gardiner Dam, holds back a reservoir that contains of water.

== Qu&#x27;Appelle River ==

During the time of glaciation on North America, the retreating glacier would block the flow north and would force the water flow down the Qu&#x27;Appelle River. When the glaciers retreated further, water would then flow north. Before the Gardiner Dam was built, spring flows were high enough to allow water down the Qu&#x27;Appelle but would dry up later in the fall. Now as the Qu&#x27;Appelle Dam always retains the water of Lake Diefenbaker, water is released into the Qu&#x27;Appelle River in order to maintain flows throughout the entire year. This serves the farmers along the Qu&#x27;Appelle who use it for irrigation and watering their livestock.

There are multiple dams and lakes along the Qu&#x27;Appelle River as it meanders through the glacial meltwater-carved Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley en route to its mouth at the Assiniboine River in Manitoba. These lakes and dams provide a stable water source for consumption and recreation. Some of these include Eyebrow Lake, Buffalo Pound Lake, Craven Dam, the Fishing Lakes, Crooked Lake, and Round Lake.

== Tourism and access ==
Public access to the Qu&#x27;Appelle Dam is from a scenic viewpoint that provides views of the dam itself, Lake Diefenbaker, and the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley. A short road from Highway 19 leads to the viewpoint. Along the top of the dam runs the Canadian Pacific Railway; the dam was designed with this type of loading in mind.

Douglas Provincial Park (named after former premier of Saskatchewan Tommy Douglas) extends from the dam to the community of Mistusinne to the north. Lake Diefenbaker has over of shoreline and around the lake there are many communities, parks, and recreational facilities, such as campgrounds, beaches, golf courses, and marinas.

<text>Carl Nielsen&#x27;s Concerto for Clarinet and orchestra, op. 57 [D.F.129] was written for Danish clarinetist Aage Oxenvad in 1928. The concerto is presented in one long movement, with four distinct theme groups.

==History==
In 1921, Nielsen heard the Copenhagen Wind Quintet rehearsing some music by Mozart. He was struck by the tonal beauty and musicianship of this group, and he soon became intimately acquainted with its members. That same year, he wrote his Wind Quintet expressly for this ensemble. The last movement of this work is a theme and variations depicting in music the personalities of the five players and their respective instruments, much in the manner that Elgar portrayed his friends in the Enigma Variations.

Nielsen planned to carry the idea further; he wanted to write a concerto for each of his five friends. Only two of these compositions ever came into being. For Gilbert Jespersen, who succeeded Paul Hagemann as flautist of the Copenhagen Quintet, he wrote his Flute Concerto in 1926; two years later, he composed his Clarinet Concerto for the group&#x27;s clarinettist, Aage Oxenvad. The latter work, completed August 15, 1928, was first heard in a private concert at the summer home of Carl Johan Michaelsen, in Humlebaek, on September 14, with Oxenvad as soloist and Emil Telmányi conducting. The same performers gave the premiere in Copenhagen on October 11 of that same year, when it met with a decidedly mixed reception. Since that time, it has gained much wider acceptance.

The Clarinet Concerto was conceived during the most difficult period in Nielsen&#x27;s life. He was sixty-three, and had achieved considerable renown throughout Scandinavia; yet he was disappointed that his music had not reached a wider audience, he was deeply concerned with the unsettled state of the world, and he knew that his days were numbered. Perhaps this accounts for the bitter struggle which occurs throughout this concerto—a war between the tonalities of F major and E major. Every time hostilities seem to be at an end, a snare drum incites the combatants to renewed conflict. Another explanation for this is that the clarinetist for whom he was writing the concerto had a bi-polar disorder. Therefore, the concerto was poking fun at his constant mood swings.

This is how things went according to sources close to Nielsen:

Carl Nielsen’s friend Carl Johan Michaelsen had to urge him several times before he started composing a second concerto for a member of the Copenhagen Wind Quintet. This time it revolved around clarinettist Aage Oxenvad. Nielsen started composing in the spring of 1928. On 15 August he completed the score at Damgaard. Emil Telmányi had already started on an arrangement for piano for the benefit of Oxenvad, who grumbled that Nielsen must be able to play the clarinet since he had systematically used the notes that are most difficult to play.

The Concerto was performed for the first time on 14 September at a private concert in Carl Johan Michaelsen’s summer villa Højtofte, in Humlebæk, north of Copenhagen. The soloist was Oxenvad, to whom the Concerto is dedicated. Twenty-two members of the Chapel Royal were conducted by Emil Telmányi. The first public performance took place in Copenhagen on 11 October with the same players, and received a generally positive reception. Politiken wrote:

“... he has liberated the soul of the clarinet, not only the wild animal aspect but also its special brand of ruthless poetry... This work could hardly have found a more homogeneous interpretation. Oxenvad’s sonority is in tune with the trolls and the giants, and he has soul, a rough and stocky primordial force mixed with naive Danish mildness. Certainly Carl Nielsen must have had his particular clarinet sound in mind while composing this Concerto.”
==Structure==
Eschewing the large classical concerto form, Nielsen has cast the Clarinet Concerto in one continuous movement. It begins with a firm Allegretto un poco, relieved by a somewhat more songful second theme. There is much stormy strife between the soloist and the orchestra and between the two principal competing keys. This is followed by a Poco adagio, interrupted several times by quicker, more disturbed sections. The final part is an energetic vivace, but a return to the Adagio brings the work to what Robert Simpson calls an ending of &quot;calm severity,&quot; with the key of F major ultimately triumphant.

In his admirably thorough study of Carl Nielsen and his music, Robert Simpson points out what inventive use the composer made of tonality, and this at a time when other composers threw it over for atonality.

Despite the storm and stress in the concerto, the composer has kept his forces down almost to chamber music proportions. In addition to the solo clarinet, the only other instruments called for in the score are two bassoons, two horns, snare drum and strings. Because of the prominence of the snare drum line in the piece, a snare drum is still called for in the piano reduction.

==Celebration concert==
The Clarinet Concerto was one of the three items chosen for the gala concert in Copenhagen celebrating the 150th anniversary of Carl Nielsen&#x27;s birth. Accompanied by Danmark Radio&#x27;s Symphony Orchestra conducted by Juanjo Mena, the soloist was the Finnish clarinetist Olli Leppäniemi (born 1980).
