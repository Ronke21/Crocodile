<text>Mirsad Fazlagić (born 4 April 1943) is a Bosnian retired professional football player and manager. He played as a full-back.

==Club career==
Fazlagić started his football career in the youth setup of his local hometown team Čapljina in 1957. As a talented seventeen year old, he was acquired by Yugoslav First League side FK Željezničar, where he also made his debut in the top tier of Yugoslav football. After one season with the blues he made a switch to bitter city rivals FK Sarajevo in the summer of 1960. The team led by prolific scorer Asim Ferhatović finished fourth in the league during the 1963–64 season, with Fazlagić establishing himself as the team&#x27;s starting right-back. Two years later the maroon-whites finished runners-up behind FK Partizan and eventually went on to win the league during the 1966–67 season, with him captaining the outfit. FK Sarajevo was narrowly beaten by Manchester United in the 1967–68 European Cup second round, despite hosting a goalless draw in the first leg. The second leg played at Old Trafford ended in controversy after the ball went out of bounds prior to the hosts scoring the winning goal. After signing a pre-contract with Juventus in the fall of 1971, which would have made him the most expensive defender in history until that point, he suffered a horrendous knee injury and the transfer fell through. After recovering for nearly a year, he was again fielded by then-FK Sarajevo manager Srboljub Markušević. He retired prematurely in 1975 having played 404 matches for FK Sarajevo while finding the back of the net 10 times. His farewell match for the club was against Sporting CP at the Stadium Koševo, a 2–2 draw.

==International career==
On the international stage, Fazlagić made 19 appearances for Yugoslavia, earning his first cap in a European Championship qualification match on 31 March 1963 against Belgium (1–0). He is especially known internationally for being the captain of Yugoslavia during the 1968 European Football Championship, where the side took silver after a tight loss to the home team Italy after a two-legged final at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome. He was named part of the tournament&#x27;s All-star team. He also took part in the 1964 Summer Olympics. His final international was that June 1968 final loss against Italy.

==Managerial career==
In 1974, Fazlagić was named player-manager of FK Sarajevo, which he led for one season, eventually being transferred to the club&#x27;s youth department in order to gain more coaching experience. After eight years of managing the youth teams, he was named assistant manager to former club and international teammate Boško Antić. The pair led a talented team of youngsters, including the likes of Faruk Hadžibegić, Husref Musemić, Slaviša Vukičević, Predrag Pašić and Zijad Švrakić, to the Yugoslav First League title in 1985, thus becoming champions both as players and as managers. In 1986, he was named assistant to Mirko Jozić in the Yugoslavia under-20 team, taking the side to the 1987 FIFA World Youth Championship in Chile. The team, fielding many future European stars including Zvonimir Boban, Robert Prosinečki, Davor Šuker and Predrag Mijatović, lifted the trophy. In 1988, he had a brief stint in Melbourne, Australia with Footscray JUST in the National Soccer League. From 1989 to 1990, he also managed Anorthosis Famagusta FC in the Cypriot First Division. With the start of the Bosnian war and the Siege of Sarajevo in 1992, Fazlagić rejoined FK Sarajevo and took part in the club&#x27;s famous 1993–94 World tour, with the goal of garnering support and international aid for the newly independent state. After the end of the war he worked as a manager in Kuwait.

==Personal life==
His son-in-law, Mirza Varešanović is a former Bosnia and Herzegovina international player and current manager. His grandsons Mak and Dal Varešanović are professional footballers.

<text>In graph theory, list edge-coloring is a type of graph coloring that combines list coloring and edge coloring.
An instance of a list edge-coloring problem consists of a graph together with a list of allowed colors for each edge. A list edge-coloring is a choice of a color for each edge, from its list of allowed colors; a coloring is proper if no two adjacent edges receive the same color.

A graph is -edge-choosable if every instance of list edge-coloring that has as its underlying graph and that provides at least allowed colors for each edge of has a proper coloring. In other words, when the list for each edge has length , no matter which colors are put in each list, a color can be selected from each list so that is properly colored.
The edge choosability, or &quot;list edge colorability&quot;, &quot;list edge chromatic number&quot;, or &quot;list chromatic index&quot;, of graph is the least number such that is -edge-choosable. It is conjectured that it always equals the chromatic index.

==Properties==
Some properties of :
# formula_1
# formula_2 This is the Dinitz conjecture, proven by .
# formula_3 i.e. the list chromatic index and the chromatic index agree asymptotically .
Here is the chromatic index of ; and , the complete bipartite graph with equal partite sets.

==List coloring conjecture==
The most famous open problem about list edge-coloring is probably the &quot;list coloring conjecture&quot;.

formula_4

This conjecture has a fuzzy origin; overview its history. The Dinitz conjecture, proven by , is the special case of the list coloring conjecture for the complete bipartite graphs .

<doc id="690687" wikidata="Q5015619" url="?curid=690687" title="Cable &amp; Deadpool">
<text>Cable &amp; Deadpool was a comic book series published by Marvel Comics beginning in 2004. The title characters, Cable and Deadpool, share the book&#x27;s focus. The series was launched following the cancellation of the characters&#x27; previous ongoing solo series. The book&#x27;s mix of humor, action, and intricate plotting has won it a devoted fanbase. Marvel Comics canceled the series with issue #50 to make way for a new &quot;Deadpool&quot; ongoing series that began on September 10, 2008, and a new Cable ongoing series launched in March 2008. Cable &amp; Deadpool were ranked #7 on Marvel.com&#x27;s list of &quot;The 10 Greatest Buddy Teams&quot; of all time.

==Main characters==
*Cable (Nathan Dayspring Askani’son Summers) is the time-traveling son of Cyclops and Madelyne Pryor (a clone of Jean Grey). Cable, having mutant powers and knowing what the future could be, is trying to bring about a better world.
*Deadpool (Wade Wilson) is a talkative mercenary for hire known as the &quot;Merc with a Mouth&quot;. Like Wolverine, he is a subject of the Weapon X experiment for which he volunteered in the hopes of finding a cure for his cancer. Although he received an enhanced body from the project, the cancer was not cured, he went insane, and his skin became covered in hideous scars. Deadpool helps to further Cable&#x27;s plans, sometimes unwittingly.

==Minor and recurring characters==
* Agent X (Alex Hayden) was injected with the &quot;American Gene&quot; during a botched mission infiltrating a HYDRA base, making him incredibly obese. He appointed Deadpool as the head of his mercenary organization, Agency X, while he is getting back in shape.
* The Black Box (Garabed Bashur), a one-time information broker, worked for Cable in hopes of changing the world. He was killed by Sabretooth.
* Bob, Agent of HYDRA is an average HYDRA agent pressed into service by Deadpool during his mission to rescue Agent X. He now works with Agency X.
* Domino is the on/off confidante, lover, and teammate of Cable. She knows Cable better than most and is scared and excited about what might happen if he succeeds.
* Nick Fury is the former Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Fury appears early in the series after Cable threatens to use his out-of-control telekinesis to throw all the world&#x27;s nuclear weapons into space. Later, he sends Captain America to infiltrate Providence.
* Prester John, time-displaced from the past, operates Providence&#x27;s multi-religious studies program and occasionally ends up fighting to defend Providence.
* Johann Kriek, a former Interpol operative, is now the Chief of Security for Providence.
* Irene Merryweather, a former reporter for the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;, is now the Chief of Staff on Providence and Cable&#x27;s chronicler.
* Rabbi Rosen is a Rabbi aboard Providence. Rosen tends to offer advice where he can.
* Weasel is a technological genius and one of Deadpool&#x27;s best friends. Weasel aids in some of Deadpool&#x27;s activities.
* Outlaw (Inez Temple) is an attractive and short-tempered mercenary from Texas who is currently employed by Agency X. She is a mutant with enhanced durability, speed, and incredible accuracy with firearms (even rivaling Bullseye in terms of targeting skills). She is a descendant of the Outlaw Kid and dresses in a cowgirl motif.
* Sandi Brandenberg is the secretary of Agency X, as well as a former love interest to both Deadpool and Agent X. She is currently the girlfriend of the Taskmaster. She was recently kidnapped and kept bound and gagged along with Outlaw by T-Ray, but was rescued by Deadpool.
* Six Pack is a group of mercenaries hired by S.H.I.E.L.D. to watch over Cable. They are: G. W. Bridge, Hammer, Domino, Solo, Anaconda, and Constrictor.

==Features==

=== Recap page===
Starting with issue #11, &quot;Cable &amp; Deadpool&quot; opens each book with a unique recap page. This page, usually presented by Deadpool and occasionally with Cable or by/with the book&#x27;s supporting characters, villains, and guest stars, breaks the fourth wall and literally talks to the audience. Keeping with the book&#x27;s tone, the recap page is usually funny, often with Deadpool having to explain what the fourth wall is to other characters on the page. From issue #44, the recap pages have been in the form of an online blog as written by Bob, Agent of HYDRA.

===Dear Deadpool===
Issue #13 saw the start of &quot;Dear Deadpool&quot;, a letters page seemingly hosted by Deadpool himself. Like the recap page, &quot;Dear Deadpool&quot; is often comical and has Deadpool breaking the fourth wall. In this section, Deadpool frequently refers to not only the characters in this comic, but often mentions (and makes fun of) the creators, as well as various conventions of Marvel Comics and the comics industry in general. He even goes so far as to refer to &quot;the man who types my answers&quot;. A running gag features Deadpool&#x27;s excitement over a typical feature of comic book fan letters: a numbered list of questions. This would prompt the response, &quot;Ooh, numbered questions!&quot; In 2006, &quot;Wizard Magazine&quot; named &quot;Dear Deadpool&quot; as &quot;the Funniest Letters Page in Comics&quot;.

==Story arcs==

===If Looks Could Kill===
&quot;If Looks Could Kill&quot; (issues #1-6) brings Cable and Deadpool together (literally). In this first story arc, Deadpool is hired by &quot;The One World Church&quot; to steal a virus that will allow them to turn everyone on Earth blue. Meanwhile, Cable is trying to figure how to best use his newly enhanced mutant powers to help change the world. Through a series of events, both Cable and Deadpool end up back at &quot;The One World Church&quot; where they are both infected by the virus. In order for them both to survive, Cable absorbs and then throws up Deadpool which ends up mixing their DNA. Cable eventually takes control of the virus and uses it to turn the entire world pink. A couple of days later, Cable restores everyone to their original color, and takes credit for this calling himself their &quot;Saviour&quot;. During this, Cable uses his enhanced powers to rebuild his space station, Graymalkin, which includes a teleportation system. Because of the mixing of their DNA, both Cable and Deadpool can teleport, but when one does it he takes the other with him.

===Burnt offering===
In &quot;The Burnt Offering&quot; (issues #7-10, originally known as &quot;The Passion of the Cable&quot;), Cable continues with his plan to espouse a philosophy of moderation, and offers invitations to the world&#x27;s top thinkers, scientists and philosophers to live on Providence (the recently rebuilt Graymalkin) in the face of a nervous S.H.I.E.L.D. Delivering a stark message to the world&#x27;s leaders, he deliberately sets them all against him by threatening to throw their missiles into the sun. Meanwhile, the X-Men, including Cable’s father Cyclops, hire Deadpool to gather pieces of a mini-teleporter in order to stop Cable. After they mounted an attack on Providence, Cable confesses to Deadpool that he&#x27;d wanted to be killed in order to set an example of how the world could work together, even if it were against him. After being injured by the Silver Surfer, Cable has Deadpool use the mini-teleporter to lobotomize Cable in order to save him from burning out as X-Man had. With the last of his powers, Cable left the world a final message of what the world could be if everyone tried a bit harder to make it a better place.

===Thirty pieces===

During &quot;Thirty Pieces&quot; (issues #11-12), Deadpool goes on a quest to save Cable’s life. After obtaining a techno-organic alien from MODOK, Deadpool tracks down the Fixer in hopes that he would be able to fix Cable. Along the way, Deadpool battles Agent X who was hired by what appears to be a religious organization to track Deadpool in order to prevent the ‘resurrection’ of Cable. After having the alien grafted to his body, Cable, who is comatose and trapped in a dreamscape with the Six Pack, overcomes the alien’s brain and heals himself, though he still extremely depowered.

===Murder in Paradise===
&quot;A Murder in Paradise&quot; (issues #13-14) starts on Providence with the murder mystery of Haji Bin Barat, the world’s most wanted terrorist. Deadpool insists on being involved in the investigation, but Irene Merryweather takes charge. Eventually Deadpool, and everyone else, realizes that he was the only person that could have killed Barat. Following a fight with Prestor John, Cable confronts Deadpool, who admits he cannot remember killing Barat. Although Cable wants to help Deadpool, he tells him he has to leave the island until he gets back from a mission with X-Force. Deadpool leaves Providence in search of the Black Box whom he hopes can find a way to kill him.
===Enema of the State===

&quot;Enema of the State&quot; (issues #15-18) takes place after the end of the &quot;X-Force&quot; miniseries where Cable vanished after defeating the mutant-hunting Skornn. After finding and being brainwashed by the Black Box to kill Cable, Deadpool returns to Providence where he finds Siryn and &#x27;Cannonball&#x27; (Deadpool loses some respect for Sam Guthrie on learning his true codename) who are also looking for Cable. With the help of Forge, Deadpool uses a modified version of the teleportation device to track down Cable through various dimensions with Siryn and Cannonball following three minutes behind. The group travels through these dimensions finding Cable as a Horseman of Apocalypse (War); a messiah-like, benevolent dictator; and the central conscience of a Phalanx invasion of Earth. Finally in the House of M reality, Deadpool finds a baby version of Cable in the care of Mister Sinister. After the &quot;House of M&quot; reality fades, Cable starts to age and his memory is restored. He then burns out his restored powers to ‘fix’ Deadpool’s mind. With Cable depowered and still in his teens, Deadpool teleports them both to Intercourse, PA.

===Why, When I Was Your Age===
&quot;Why, When I Was Your Age...&quot; (issue #19) picks up with Deadpool taking Cable to Intercourse, PA, with hopes that the city will live up to its name. While at a bar, Cable talks about growing up in the future, and Deadpool discusses the death of his father. At the end of the night, Cable is fully aged, and neither of the two wish to discuss what actually happened in their past.

===Bosom Buddies===
In &quot;Bosom Buddies&quot; (issues #20-23), Deadpool is hired to steal the Dominus Objective, a secondary hard drive that acts like a virus that acts like a server. While Deadpool is out to steal the Objective, he ends up fighting both the B.A.D. Girls, Luke Cage and Iron Fist only to discover that the Dominus Project had already been stolen. Later, The B.A.D. Girls confront Shen Kuei (The Cat) who actually stole the Dominus Objective. The Cat reveals to them it was the Black Box who hired him originally, though it was Cable who paid him, as well as who hired them and Deadpool. In the final confrontation, Cable links with Dominus Objective which gives him a new power similar to his telepathy. When everything is settled, Black Box decides to work for Cable.

===Sticky Situations and Living Legends===
In &quot;Sticky Situations&quot; and &quot;Living Legends&quot; (issues #24 &amp; 25), Deadpool is hired to steal plans for a secret government project called the &quot;Cone of Silence&quot;, which was originally designed as a force field to cut off Providence from the rest of the world. During his escapades, Deadpool ends up briefly fighting Spider-Man before finally getting the plans. After realizing that it was probably Cable who had the plans stolen, Nick Fury sends Captain America to infiltrate Providence. Captain America finds Providence to be a peaceful place and learns of Cable&#x27;s past and his plans to change the future. During a fight between Cable and Captain America, Cable reveals that he has used the &quot;Cone of Silence&quot; to create a technological replacement for his telekinesis.

===Born Again===
In &quot;Born Again&quot; (issues #26 &amp; 27), the story reveals the hidden past connections between Apocalypse and Cable, specifically that it was Cable who infected Apocalypse with the techno-organic virus that Apocalypse would pass on to Cable as an infant.

===The Domino Principle===
In &quot;The Domino Principle&quot; (issues #28 &amp; 29), Cable employs Deadpool to remove Flag-Smasher as the ruler of Rumekistan. Flag-Smasher had become ruler in the mini-series &quot;Citizen V &amp; The V-Battalion: The Everlasting&quot;, also written by Fabian Nicieza. The coup becomes complicated with the separate interferences of Citizen V and Cable&#x27;s old love interest, Domino. Although Cable successfully manipulates Domino into assassinating Flag-Smasher, he finds his own resolve shaken when faced with his ex-lover&#x27;s doubts about his agenda.

===Civil War===
In the &quot;Civil War&quot; story arc, Deadpool has been given the job of hunting down super-powered individuals who have not signed the Superhuman Registration Act. There is a confrontation between Cable and Deadpool in which Cable reveals that he will be fostering superheroes in Providence. When Cable meets Captain America to extend this offer, Cap refuses. Cable tries to convince him by revealing what he knows about the Secret Avengers&#x27; secret identities. This gesture does not go unnoticed by Deadpool, who is watching them from a nearby rooftop and notes Daredevil&#x27;s new identity. He attacks Daredevil in a warehouse, and is himself attacked by members of the Secret Avengers and the Young Avengers. Cable attempts to intervene and convince Deadpool to join their cause by offering him a bigger paycheck (and when Deadpool refuses, a bigger badge). This fails when Deadpool tries to shoot Cable with tranquilizer darts, which Cable deflects into Wade&#x27;s face. Wade wakes up bound and gagged (with a full body covering of duct tape, after Cable suggested an entire roll for his mouth alone) in the warehouse before Cable reappears, setting him free and taking him along to the White House to meet with the American President about the possible repercussions of the superhero registration act. When the President orders hostilities on Cable (Deadpool had briefly left to go to the bathroom), he and Deadpool shift out before anyone can get harmed. They arrive in the countryside, where Deadpool attacks (following the President&#x27;s orders) Cable. After a brief fight, Cable reveals the fight to have been staged and televised in order to lose Deadpool his job as a government agent. The arc ends with a very uneasy truce between the two men.

===Six Packs and Powder Kegs===
In &quot;Six Packs and Powder Kegs&quot; (issue 33 - 35) story arc, a massive explosions rocks Cable&#x27;s island paradise of Providence. Bodysliding back from Rumekistan (which he has been working to install democracy within), Cable finds that a saboteur may still be hidden on the island. His search for the bomber is stopped when he finds reports that the United States, along with several European allies, have sent the mercenary group Six Pack into Rumekistan to disrupt the peace. Cable arrives and attempts to stop the group, only to note that there are five members present. The mysterious sixth member and the terrorist bomber on Providence? Deadpool, who shoots Cable in the back of the head while his personal force field is down. Cable is knocked unconscious, but not killed. Domino is upset at Deadpools actions, and the Six Pack leaves Cable lying in the street. He is recovered by the citizens of the city while the Six Pack plan to de-power the country goes through. While news reports of the happenings in both Rumekistan and Providence are aired, Cable&#x27;s seemingly unconscious body seems to take power from one of the few remaining sources, the hospital that his citizens were taking him to. Cable&#x27;s body levitates, and he ends up using his technology to repair the damage done by the Six Pack. Conscious again, he tracks down the Six Pack. Domino asserts that Cable acts as if he&#x27;d planned the entire thing from the start. Cable tells them that in order to do so, he&#x27;d need the ability to read minds or at least be &quot;able to predict the future.&quot; Telling Deadpool to &quot;Get the Hell out of my country and never come back!&quot; he throws Deadpool from Rumekistan, while keeping the rest of the Six Pack disabled. He then has Domino explain the happenings on TV, while Deadpool thinks it was all to punish him for opposing Cable during the Civil War. Cable and Domino then share a kiss. In the letters page, Deadpool is upset at his depiction on the next issue&#x27;s cover, and asserts that it should be both an epilogue to this arc and a prologue to the next arc which should center around him.

===Unfinished Business===
In &quot;Unfinished Business&quot; (issue 36 - 39) Deadpool has to find a way to get his reputation back for being one of the best mercenaries for hire. After consulting Blind Al for validation of his plan, and getting Weasel to help him with the preparations, he kidnaps a mother and two children from a highway rest stop at 2 in the morning, setting them tied up in the middle of the road forcing a large armored truck to stop and investigate. He then proceeds to knock out the guards and blow a hole in the back of the truck with a bazooka, thus freeing a well known mercenary and trainer of supervillain henchmen, Taskmaster. He tells Taskmaster (whom he affectionately calls &#x27;Tasky&#x27;) that he won&#x27;t owe him anything. He simply wants a trade. His freedom, in exchange for a fight with Deadpool. He explains that he wants to have the bout where &quot;Insidious, malevolent, Machiavellian people who do the hiring for our kind are gathered.&quot; He then promptly knocks Taskmaster unconscious so as to skip a lot of explaining and move right onto the fight. It turns out that he kidnapped a select group of the kinds of people who hire mercenaries, and has Weasel show them the fight on a projector. He has himself manacled and fights Taskmaster, all the while spouting comments about his abilities as though the captives were watching an advertisement. Even though Taskmaster stabs him straight through the chest, Deadpool comes out on top, returning the battered opponent and himself to the room where the men are held. His plan fails however, as they are just as reluctant to hire him as ever. Taskmaster re-awakens and Deadpool thanks him for letting him win. Taskmaster then tells Deadpool that he didn&#x27;t let him win, saying &quot;The truth is... You&#x27;re that good. You&#x27;ve always been that good. Which won&#x27;t get you a cup of coffee until you figure out how to be a professional...&quot; He then leaves and Deadpool is left to reflect on this as he realizes that neither he nor Weasel have the keys to his handcuffs. Two weeks later, a still handcuffed Deadpool struggled with a twist top beer, and while watching the news, hears that Rhino has escaped. This strikes him with the revelation that if he can&#x27;t be a mercenary, he&#x27;ll become a superhero.

However, Rhino has hired someone to feed Deadpool Henry Pym&#x27;s pills after hearing that Deadpool was after him, which result in Deadpool shrinking, since Rhino planned to turn Deadpool into a keychain as retaliation to the same that Deadpool did to him during the first Deadpool running series. Although, Deadpool soon beats up and defeats Rhino, along with various bar goers to who Rhino was showing off his &quot;deadpool-keychain&quot; to.

While still shrunken, Deadpool is informed by Sandi and Outlaw that Agent X was captured by Hydra while he was fighting Hydra, a terrorist organization, to steal a &quot;morphogenic actuator&quot;, which can be used to cure or cause diseases. Deadpool, with Weasel, goes to the Hydra Headquarters where Agent X is being held, in Pakistan. Using his small size to his advantage, Deadpool infiltrates the Headquarters and captures Bob, Agent of HYDRA, to help him get to Agent X. It is then found that the actuator has been used to give Agent X morbid obesity by scientists experimenting with the actuator, and that it can not be removed by the actuator. Deadpool then forces the scientists to turn him back to his normal size (&quot;They had some Pym Particles lying around. Figured they must. Who doesn&#x27;t, right?&quot;) and gets Bob to drive a plane with Deadpool, obese Agent X and the actuator towards home. However, they forgot to get Weasel. During the journey home, Agent X levels with Deadpool, asking him if he could take over Agency X (Agent X&#x27;s company of hireling mercenaries) while he deals with his weight problem. However, T-Ray has returned and captured Sandi and Outlaw, using them in his plan to kill Deadpool and Agent X for stealing his identity. Deadpool succeeds in killing T-Ray with his katana. Deadpool then recounts how Cable healed him of his insanity and that T-Ray and Deadpool had shared memories and that Deadpool spotted many holes in his story.

===Fractured===
In &quot;Fractured&quot; (#40-42) Cable&#x27;s island of Providence is attacked by the creature Hecatomb, who Cable&#x27;s X-Men are fighting. When Deadpool and the Agency X gang hear of this, they travel to Providence to help Cable. However, Rogue has already defeated Hecatomb by absorbing the 8 billion people&#x27;s minds it absorbed. Sabretooth attacks the building where Irene Merryweather and the Black Box are. Domino heads for the building to rescue them as Cable heads for the Power Core. Domino gets to the building to discover that Sabretooth has killed Black Box and is holding Irene hostage by using her as a human shield. Deadpool, who has parachuted from the Angency X jet, shoots Sabretooth and Irene manages to roll away. Domino takes Irene to the evacuation boats. Deadpool then proceeds to shoot Sabretooth repeatedly, stating that he knows he&#x27;s running out of bullets, but he wonders if there will be anything left of Sabretooth for his healing factor to heal, just as he runs out bullets. Domino gets Irene to the evacuation boats as Cable joins them after he added just enough energy to the island to &quot;finish the job.&quot; Domino makes Cable promise not to commit suicide, as Providence has a fail-safe system should Cable die. As Domino leaves, Cable wonders how many promises he&#x27;s broken. Cable goes to help Deadpool get rid of Sabretooth by hurling him out to the middle of the ocean. Cable then sends Deadpool to obtain secrets about the future (in the form of a mini statue of Anton Krutch) that could be dangerous if in the wrong hands. Cable heads for the Core, where he is attacked by Gambit and Sunfire. Meanwhile, Deadpool succeeds in locating the statue, but is attacked by Senyaka, former Acolyte.

As Cable makes a run for the Core, Deadpool continues to fight Senyaka for the mini statue. Cable makes it to the Core and activates the self-destruct system as Deadpool finally gets his hands on the mini statue, which turns out to be a teleport matrix. Gambit and Sunfire escape as Providence explodes. Deadpool is teleported to his apartment where Deadpool claims he wasn&#x27;t worth it and that he won&#x27;t let Cable down.

===Alone Again, Naturally===
In &quot;Alone Again, Naturally&quot; (#43-50), after meeting Cyclops at a memorial statue of Cable, Deadpool goes to the Hydra base to finally save Weasel because if he doesn&#x27;t, Wolverine will kill him and everyone else in the base. He almost succeeds but after trying to reason with Wolverine, Deadpool is decapitated. However Bob finally proves his worth by placing Deadpool&#x27;s head back on his shoulders while Wolverine deals with the offending Hydra agents. Deadpool, Weasel, and Bob leave the Hydra base after Weasel&#x27;s sabotage imprisons the remaining Hydra soldiers; however, the same device malfunctions as they head home, teleporting Deadpool and Bob to World War II Germany.

Having found themselves alongside Captain America and a foul-mouthed Bucky, Deadpool and Bob join in on the fight against the Nazis. All goes well but due to &#x27;temporal hiccups&#x27;, Captain America and Bucky seem to repeatedly forget who Deadpool and Bob are. The group heads off to find Doctor Zola and do battle with a Frankenstein Monster of his, but seem to be trapped in the past. Meanwhile, in the present time, Weasel has convinced the Fantastic Four to let him use their time machine, pointing out how bad an idea it is to have Deadpool and a rogue Hydra agent remain lost in time. He is unsuccessful however, and the Fantastic Four offer to help bring Deadpool home instead.

Using the technology provided by the Fantastic Four of the present day Weasel managed to pull Deadpool and Bob to the Baxter Building although at an earlier point in time where he meets the older iteration of the Fantastic Four (although appearing through Doctor Doom&#x27;s time platform doesn&#x27;t help matters, also with the &#x27;temporal hiccups&#x27; still in effect the team gets quite confused about why there is a HYDRA agent at their breakfast table). Eventually they agree to help Deadpool return to the future, although complications mean he and Bob end up falling further and further into the time-stream until they are rescued at the last minute by both time periods versions of the Fantastic Four. After being dismissed from the Baxter Building for his mercenary lifestyle (although Sandi and Outlaw, who also work for Agency X are invited to stay for poker) Deadpool, Bob and Weasel return to the Agency X offices. Here they find Doctor Strange who has come to recruit Deadpool to save the multiverse from a problem he apparently created.

Unfortunately for Deadpool this involves finding T-Ray&#x27;s body, so he and Bob sent to fight their way through various mystical realms by Dr. Strange to search for it. Upon finding T-Ray, Dr Strange reveals that at the moment Deadpool killed him he had used his black magic to try to escape through a &#x27;mystical burrow&#x27;, this sent him tumbling through various magical planes leaving the barriers between frayed. Deadpool had been sent to collect the portions of life essence he left in each realm, which he now has to use to restore T-Ray to life. After replacing the life essence, Dr Strange informs Deadpool and Bob that although T-Ray&#x27;s body is complete, his soul is still missing. He then sends them to the Louisiana swamps where they meet Brother Voodoo, who arranges for Deadpool to confront T-Ray&#x27;s soul and try to restore it to his body. After an antagonistic encounter, Deadpool succeeds and, as both had to be kept alive, they somewhat amicably part ways.

Deadpool is later contacted by Irene Merryweather who asks him to retrieve an &quot;electro-polarity reconfiguration engine&quot; left over in the Savage Land by Magneto to help power Rumekistan since Cable&#x27;s death. After being attacked by a mind-controlled Ka-Zar and eventually freeing him, Deadpool, Weasel and Bob discover Brainchild has taken over. After Deadpool breaks in and finds the &quot;reconfigurator&quot; Weasel and Bob teleport to him. Brainchild then sends an army of dinosaurs to attack them which Deadpool teleports to Genosha using Weasels pene-traitor technology. After Deadpool shoots down Brainchild&#x27;s escape dinosaur Ka-zar agrees to let him take the &quot;reconfigurator&quot;. Weasel then points out that Deadpool sent the dinosaurs not to Genosha but the Genoshan embassy in New York City where they break open a van which the Mighty Avengers and Fantastic Four were using to transport the Venom symbiote, this quickly combines with the dinosaurs leaving an army of loose in Manhattan.

Deadpool then returns to New York to fight the . At first, he and Spider-Man fight them, but Weasel, the Fantastic Four and the Mighty Avengers all help Deadpool clean up the mess that he made. Agent X even gets in on the action, and Bob manages to bring down one of the bigger , regaining the respect of his wife, who saw it on TV. After much fighting, Deadpool is eventually knocked far away from the action. Cable (from the future) manages to send a , which can destroy the symbionts on the dinosaurs. Deadpool takes on the last , and almost gets absorbed by the symbiote. However, Deadpool stabs himself in the head with the , and is released from the grip of the symbiote. Deadpool awakes to find out from the Avengers that the dinosaurs have been returned to the jungle thanks to Weasel.

It all ends with Deadpool back at his apartment watching TV. Deadpool had been blamed for the incident by the media on TV. Weasel, Bob, Irene Merryweather, Agent X, Sandi, and Outlaw all come in to hang out with Deadpool. The series ends with Deadpool asking his friends, &quot;So... whaddyou guys want to watch?&quot;

In the 1950s, McDonnell Hall was added to the existing Adelphia Hall (the name of which refers to Adelphia College, previously on the site). In the 1960s, Peyton Hall was added across the parking lot from McDonnell and Adelphia Halls. The McHugh Gymnasium was built in front of Adelphia Hall and opened in 1983, a result of the school&#x27;s first major fundraising campaign. Funds from this campaign were used to remodel the third floor of Adelphia Hall for improved science facilities. During this time the library, which then became known as Loyola Library, was moved to Peyton Hall.

There were several major additions to Seattle Prep in the late 1990s. A new underground parking garage was built to replace the old parking lot, which was replaced by a grass quad. In addition, St. Ignatius Hall was erected across from Peyton and McDonnell Halls.

In 2007, the PACCAR Commons (Donated by the Pigott family) were completed, including new office space with reception desks and also a sick room. Also construction was completed on the Thomas Healy, S.J., Theater and Classrooms. This was the first major renovation since the addition of St. Ignatius Hall. The theater, which also accommodates school Masses, features an orchestra pit with hydraulics moving it up and down for various uses, including the transportation of heavy equipment. The workout rooms and locker rooms were also altered in this remodel. The space below the theater is used for arts classes, a sacristy (to be used for liturgies and masses), and weight/workout rooms. In 2008, sections of pathway around the campus plaza were redone and electronic doors were installed on several major entrances.

<doc id="690691" wikidata="Q3575499" url="?curid=690691" title="Zig-Zag (company)">
<text>Zig-Zag is a brand of rolling papers that originated in France. The Zig-Zag brand produces primarily hand-rolled tobacco-related products such as cigarette rolling papers, cigarette tubes and rolling accessories.

== History ==
The company was founded in 1855 by Maurice and Jacques Braunstein. Based in Paris, in 1882 the company built the Papeterie de Gassicourt, a cigarette paper production plant near the town of Mantes-la-Jolie. In 1894, they invented the process of &quot;interleaving&quot; rolling papers. They called their papers Zig-Zag after the zigzag alternating packaging process. In 1900, Zig-Zag was awarded a gold medal at the Universal Exposition in Paris.

Success led to expansion in 1919 to a new mill in Thonon-les-Bains. During World War II, the company&#x27;s original facility in Mantes-la-Jolie was destroyed and at war&#x27;s end, all production was shifted to the Thonon factory.

With the death of Jacques Braunstein, in the 1950s Zig-Zag was sold to a partnership of the Group Bolloré and competitor JOB. In 2000, Zig-Zag became part of Republic Technologies of which Group Bolloré owns 19 percent.

American company Turning Point Brands, Inc. acquired North American distribution rights for Zig Zag products in 1997. In 2021, Zig Zag and Turning Point announced they would be collaborating and launching a studio, Zig Zag Studios. Their focus is on a media platform featuring a wide range of artists, culture, art, and lifestyle content.

== Marketing ==

=== The &quot;Zig-zag man&quot; ===
The zouave soldier portrayed on the front of Zig-Zag products is colloquially known as the &quot;Zig-Zag man&quot;. The choice of a member of this French North African regiment as a Zig-Zag icon originates from a folk story about an incident in the battle of Sevastopol. When the soldier&#x27;s clay pipe was destroyed by a bullet, he attempted to roll his tobacco using a piece of paper torn from a musket cartridge. 
== In popular culture ==
*Zig-Zag rolling papers went on to inspire the single cover of We Want Eazy by Eazy-E
*Zig-Zag rolling papers went on to inspire the album cover for &quot;The Chronic&quot; by Dr. Dre.

<doc id="690696" wikidata="Q94487" url="?curid=690696" title="Rose Marie">
<text>Rose Marie (born Rose Marie Mazzetta; August 15, 1923 – December 28, 2017) was an American actress, singer, comedian, and vaudeville performer with a career ultimately spanning nine decades, which included film, radio, records, theater, night clubs and television. As a child performer during the years just after the silent film era, she had a successful singing career under the stage name Baby Rose Marie.

Rose Marie was widely known for her role on the CBS situation comedy &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; (1961–1966) as television comedy writer Sally Rogers, &quot;who went toe-to-toe in a man&#x27;s world&quot;. Later, she portrayed Myrna Gibbons on &quot;The Doris Day Show&quot; and was a featured celebrity on &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; for 14 years.

She is the subject of a 2017 documentary film, &quot;Wait for Your Laugh&quot;, which includes interviews with her and her co-stars including Carl Reiner, Dick Van Dyke, Peter Marshall, and Tim Conway.

==Early life and childhood career==
Rose Marie was born Rose Marie Mazzetta in Manhattan, New York, on August 15, 1923, to Polish-American Stella Gluszcak and Italian-American vaudeville actor Frank Mazzetta, who went by the name of Frank Curley. Her mother took her to see local vaudeville shows regularly and afterwards, Rose Marie would sing what she had heard for neighbors, who eventually entered her in a talent contest. At the age of three, Marie started performing under the name &quot;Baby Rose Marie&quot;. At five, she was offered a seven-year contract and became a radio star on the NBC Radio Network and made a series of films.

Rose Marie later recalled:


To counteract these rumors, NBC arranged for her to undertake a national stage tour, and she appeared in a few short films including &quot;Baby Rose Marie the Child Wonder&quot; (1929), a Vitaphone sound short. Between 1930 and 1938, she made 17 recordings, three of which were not issued. Her first issued record, recorded on March 10, 1932, featured accompaniment by Fletcher Henderson&#x27;s orchestra, one of the leading African American jazz orchestras of the day. Henderson and the band were said to be in the RCA Victor studios recording the four songs they were intending to produce that day and were asked to accompany Baby Rose Marie, reading from a stock arrangement.

Rose Marie&#x27;s recording of &quot;Say That You Were Teasing Me&quot; (backed with &quot;Take a Picture of the Moon&quot;, Victor 22960), featuring Henderson&#x27;s orchestra, was a national hit in 1932. According to Joel Whitburn, Rose Marie was the last surviving entertainer to have charted a hit before World War II.

She continued to appear in films through the mid-1930s, making shorts and one feature picture, &quot;International House&quot; (1933), with W. C. Fields for Paramount.

==Adult career==
As she entered adulthood, Rose Marie turned to nightclub and lounge performances. According to her autobiography &quot;Hold the Roses,&quot; she was assisted in her career by many members of organized crime, including Al Capone and Bugsy Siegel. Rose Marie secured work at the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, which was built by Siegel. Because of the Flamingo&#x27;s organized crime ties, she had to seek permission to perform in other casinos and remained loyal to &quot;the boys&quot; at the Flamingo for the rest of her life.

Concurrently with her nightclub work, Rose Marie continued to work in radio, earning the nickname &quot;Darling of the Airwaves&quot;.

===Television===
In the 1960–1961 season, Marie co-starred with Shirley Bonne, Elaine Stritch, Jack Weston, Raymond Bailey, and Stubby Kaye in &quot;My Sister Eileen&quot;.

After five seasons (1961–1966) as Sally Rogers on &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;, Rose Marie co-starred in two seasons (1969–1971) of &quot;The Doris Day Show&quot; as Doris Martin&#x27;s friend and co-worker Myrna Gibbons. She also appeared in two episodes of &quot;The Monkees&quot; in the mid-1960s. She later had a semi-regular seat in the upper center square on the original version of &quot;The Hollywood Squares.&quot; Because contestants tended to pick corner squares first, the phrase &quot;Rose Marie to block&quot; was uttered so often she frequently joked that she should legally change her name to that.

Rose Marie performed on three 1966 and 1967 episodes of &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot; on NBC and also twice (1964 and 1968) on &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot; on ABC.

In the mid-1970s, Rose Marie appeared in the recurring role of Hilda on the police drama &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot; Hilda brought fresh doughnuts, made coffee for the team, and provided some comic relief.

In the March 8th, 1986, episode of &quot;Remington Steele&quot;, Rose Marie played a key role in &quot;Steele in the Spotlight&quot;.

In the early 1990s, Rose Marie had a recurring role as Frank Fontana&#x27;s mother on &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;.

She appeared as Roy Biggins&#x27; domineering mother Eleanor &quot;Bluto&quot; Biggins in an episode of &quot;Wings&quot;.

Rose Marie and &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; co-star Morey Amsterdam appeared together in an October 1993 episode of &quot;Herman&#x27;s Head&quot; and guest-starred in a February 1996 episode of &quot;Caroline in the City&quot;, shortly before Amsterdam&#x27;s death in October of that same year.

===Theater===
Rose Marie appeared opposite Phil Silvers in the hit Broadway musical &quot;Top Banana&quot; in 1951, also appearing in the well-received 1954 film adaptation. She later claimed that her musical numbers were cut from the film in retaliation for her publicly refusing the producer&#x27;s sexual advances. Near the end of her life, she testified that it was the only time she had ever experienced sexual harassment in the entertainment industry in her 90-year career.

In 1965, Rose Marie appeared in the Dallas production of &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; as Mae Peterson, the mother of the character played by Dick Van Dyke on Broadway and in the film.

From 1977 to 1985, Rose Marie co-starred with Rosemary Clooney, Helen O&#x27;Connell, and Margaret Whiting in the musical revue &quot;4 Girls 4&quot;, which toured the United States and appeared on television several times.

Rose Marie was the celebrity guest host of a comedy play, &quot;Grandmas Rock!&quot;, written by Gordon Durich. It was originally broadcast on radio in 2010 on KVTA and KKZZ, and rebroadcast on KVTA and KKZZ again in September 2012 in honor of National Grandparents Day.

==Personal life==
Rose Marie was married to trumpeter Bobby Guy from 1946 until his death in 1964. The couple had one daughter, television producer Georgiana Guy Rodrigues.

Though it was presented in the press as romantic, in the 1970s Rose Marie maintained a platonic relationship with Pussycat Theaters co-owner Vince Miranda.

In her later years, Rose Marie was active on social media, particularly developing a following on Twitter, where she offered support for women who, like her, had suffered from sexual harassment.

==Death==
Rose Marie died at her home in the Van Nuys neighborhood of Los Angeles on December 28, 2017, at the age of 94. Nell Scovell memorialized her as &quot;the patron saint of female comedy writers&quot;.

Rose Marie&#x27;s long-time friend and agent, Harlan Boll, says that the legendary actress&#x27;s death had to do with &quot;age problems.&quot; Boll was with Marie shortly before she died. He explained to reporters that Marie had lain down to rest on Thursday afternoon, and by the time her caregiver checked in on her, to see if she wanted something to eat, she discovered she had stopped breathing.

<text>Asim Ferhatović &quot;Hase&quot; (; 24 January 1933 – 23 January 1987) was a Bosnian professional footballer who played as a striker.

He started his football career in 1948 with hometown club FK Sarajevo, for whom he made his first-team debut in 1952. Ferhatović remained with the club until his retirement in 1967, although he represented Fenerbahçe in the 1962–63 Turkish league season. He won a solitary cap for the Yugoslavia national team in 1961.

==Club career==
During the 1950s and 1960s, Ferhatović led FK Sarajevo to great heights, and became the club&#x27;s best and most famous player, scoring 198 goals in 422 games. He also had a short stint at Fenerbahçe where he played only seven league games and scored one goal. After only half a season he left Fenerbahçe and went back to Sarajevo. His greatest personal achievement was becoming the lead scorer in the Yugoslav First League with 19 goals for FK Sarajevo in the 1963–64 season. His last season, (1966–67) saw Sarajevo win their first-ever First League title and qualify for the European Cup.

Ferhatović&#x27;s retirement was one of the most important events in Sarajevo&#x27;s sporting history, and the local newspapers ran the headline &quot;Jedan je Hase!&quot; (&quot;There is Only One Hase!&quot;) in his honour that day.

==International career==
Ferhatović played once for the Yugoslavia national team, on 8 October 1961 against South Korea in a qualification match for the 1962 FIFA World Cup.

==Death and legacy==
Ferhatović died on 23 January 1987, a day before his 54th birthday, of a heart attack.

Sarajevo&#x27;s Asim Ferhatović Hase Stadium, the site of the Opening Ceremonies of the 1984 Winter Olympics and the home of FK Sarajevo, is named in his honour. The Bosnia and Herzegovina national team often used the stadium for their international matches in the past. It is also the largest stadium in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

==In popular culture==
The Bosnian rock band Zabranjeno Pušenje wrote a song in honour of Ferhatović called &quot;Nedjelja kad je otišao Hase&quot; (&quot;The Sunday When Hase Left&quot;) and was included in their 1985 album &quot;Dok čekaš sabah sa šejtanom&quot;.

<text>In graph theory, total coloring is a type of graph coloring on the vertices and edges of a graph. When used without any qualification, a total coloring is always assumed to be &quot;proper&quot; in the sense that no adjacent edges, no adjacent vertices and no edge and either endvertex are assigned the same color. The total chromatic number of a graph is the fewest colors needed in any total coloring of .

The total graph of a graph is a graph such that (i) the vertex set of corresponds to the vertices and edges of and (ii) two vertices are adjacent in if and only if their corresponding elements are either adjacent or incident in . Then total coloring of becomes a (proper) vertex coloring of . A total coloring is a partitioning of the vertices and edges of the graph into total independent sets.

Some inequalities for :
# formula_1
# formula_2 (Molloy, Reed 1998)
# formula_3 for sufficiently large . (Hind, Molloy, Reed 1998)
# formula_4
Here is the maximum degree; and , the edge choosability.

Total coloring arises naturally since it is simply a mixture of vertex and edge colorings. The next step is to look for any Brooks-typed or Vizing-typed upper bound on the total chromatic number in terms of maximum degree.

The total coloring version of maximum degree upper bound is a difficult problem that has eluded mathematicians for 50 years. A trivial lower bound for is . Some graphs such as cycles of length formula_5 and complete bipartite graphs of the form need colors but no graph has been found that requires more colors. This leads to the speculation that every graph needs either or colors, but never more:

:Total coloring conjecture (Behzad, Vizing). formula_6

Apparently, the term &quot;total coloring&quot; and the statement of total coloring conjecture were independently introduced by Behzad and Vizing in numerous occasions between 1964 and 1968 (see Jensen &amp; Toft). The conjecture is known to hold for a few important classes of graphs, such as all bipartite graphs and most planar graphs except those with maximum degree 6. The planar case can be completed if Vizing&#x27;s planar graph conjecture is true. Also, if the list coloring conjecture is true, then formula_7

Results related to total coloring have been obtained. For example, Kilakos and Reed (1993) proved that the fractional chromatic number of the total graph of a graph is at most .

<doc id="690708" wikidata="Q13220650" url="?curid=690708" title="Comic opera">
<text>Comic opera, sometimes known as light opera, is a sung dramatic work of a light or comic nature, usually with a happy ending and often including spoken dialogue.

Forms of comic opera first developed in late 17th-century Italy. By the 1730s, a new operatic genre, &quot;opera buffa&quot;, emerged as an alternative to &quot;opera seria&quot;. It quickly made its way to France, where it became &quot;opéra comique&quot;, and eventually, in the following century, French operetta, with Jacques Offenbach as its most accomplished practitioner.

The influence of Italian and French forms spread to other parts of Europe. Many countries developed their own genres of comic opera, incorporating the Italian and French models along with their own musical traditions. Examples include German &quot;singspiel&quot;, Viennese operetta, Spanish &quot;zarzuela&quot;, Russian comic opera, English ballad and Savoy opera, North American operetta and musical comedy.

== Italian &quot;opera buffa&quot; ==

In late 17th-century Italy, light-hearted musical plays began to be offered as an alternative to weightier &quot;opera seria&quot; (17th-century Italian opera based on classical mythology). &quot;Il Trespolo tutore&quot; (1679) by Alessandro Stradella was an early precursor of &quot;opera buffa&quot;. The opera has a farcical plot, and the characters of the ridiculous guardian Trespolo and the maid Despina are prototypes of characters widely used later in the &quot;opera buffa&quot; genre.

The form began to flourish in Naples with Alessandro Scarlatti&#x27;s &quot;Il trionfo dell&#x27;onore&quot; (1718). At first written in Neapolitan dialect, these works became &quot;Italianized&quot; with the operas of Scarlatti, Pergolesi (&quot;La serva padrona&quot;, 1733), Galuppi (&quot;Il filosofo di campagna&quot;, 1754), Piccinni (&quot;La Cecchina&quot;, 1760), Paisiello (&quot;Nina&quot;, 1789), Cimarosa (&quot;Il matrimonio segreto&quot;, 1792), and then the great comic operas of Mozart and, later, Rossini and Donizetti.

At first, comic operas were generally presented as intermezzi between acts of more serious works. Neapolitan and then Italian comic opera grew into an independent form and became the most popular form of staged entertainment in Italy from about 1750 to 1800. In 1749, thirteen years after Pergolesi&#x27;s death, his &quot;La serva padrona&quot; swept Italy and France, evoking the praise of such French Enlightenment figures as Rousseau.

In 1760, Niccolò Piccinni wrote the music to &quot;La Cecchina&quot; to a text by the great Venetian playwright, Carlo Goldoni. That text was based on Samuel Richardson&#x27;s popular English novel, &quot;Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded&quot; (1740). Many years later, Verdi called &quot;La Cecchina&quot; the &quot;first true Italian comic opera&quot; – that is to say, it had everything: it was in standard Italian and not in dialect; it was no longer simply an intermezzo, but rather an independent piece; it had a real story that people liked; it had dramatic variety; and, musically, it had strong melodies and even strong supporting orchestral parts, including a strong &quot;stand-alone&quot; overture (i.e., you could even enjoy the overture as an independent orchestral piece). Verdi was also enthusiastic because the music was by a southern Italian and the text by a northerner, which appealed to Verdi&#x27;s pan-Italian vision.

The genre was developed further in the first half of the 19th century by Gioachino Rossini in his works such as &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot; (1816) and &quot;La Cenerentola&quot; (1817) and by Gaetano Donizetti in &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot; (1832) and &quot;Don Pasquale&quot; (1843), but declined in the mid-19th century, despite Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Falstaff&quot; staged in 1893.

== French &quot;opéra comique&quot; and operetta ==

French composers eagerly seized upon the Italian model and made it their own, calling it &quot;opéra comique&quot;. Early proponents included the Italian Egidio Duni, François-André Philidor, Pierre-Alexandre Monsigny, André Grétry, François-Adrien Boïeldieu, Daniel François Auber and Adolphe Adam. Although originally reserved for less serious works, the term &quot;opéra comique&quot; came to refer to any opera that included spoken dialogue, including works such as Cherubini&#x27;s &quot;Médée&quot; and Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; that are not &quot;comic&quot; in any sense of the word.

Florimond Hervé is credited as the inventor of French &quot;opéra bouffe&quot;, or &quot;opérette&quot;. Working on the same model, Jacques Offenbach quickly surpassed him, writing over ninety operettas. Whereas earlier French comic operas had a mixture of sentiment and humour, Offenbach&#x27;s works were intended solely to amuse. Though generally well crafted and full of humorous satire and grand opera parodies, plots and characters in his works were often interchangeable. Given the frenetic pace at which he worked, Offenbach sometimes used the same material in more than one opera. Another Frenchman who took up this form was Charles Lecocq.

== German &quot;singspiel&quot; and Viennese operetta ==
The &quot;singspiel&quot; developed in 18th-century Vienna and spread throughout Austria and Germany. As in the French &quot;opéra comique&quot;, the &quot;singspiel&quot; was an opera with spoken dialogue, and usually a comic subject, such as Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot; (1782) and &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; (1791). Later &quot;singspiels&quot;, such as Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fidelio&quot; (1805) and Weber&#x27;s &quot;Der Freischütz&quot; (1821), retained the form, but explored more serious subjects.

19th century Viennese operetta was built on both the &quot;singspiel&quot; and the French model. Franz von Suppé is remembered mainly for his overtures. Johann Strauss II, the &quot;waltz king&quot;, contributed &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; (1874) and &quot;The Gypsy Baron&quot; (1885). Carl Millöcker a long-time conductor at the Theater an der Wien, also composed some of the most popular Viennese operettas of the late 19th century, including &quot;Der Bettelstudent&quot; (1882), &quot;Gasparone&quot; (1884) and &quot;Der arme Jonathan&quot; (1890).

After the turn of the 20th century, Franz Lehár wrote &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; (1905); Oscar Straus supplied &quot;Ein Walzertraum&quot; (&quot;A Waltz Dream&quot;, 1907) and &quot;The Chocolate Soldier&quot; (1908); and Emmerich Kálmán composed &quot;Die Csárdásfürstin&quot; (1915).

== Spanish &quot;zarzuela&quot; ==
&quot;Zarzuela&quot;, introduced in Spain in the 17th century, is rooted in popular Spanish traditional musical theatre. It alternates between spoken and sung scenes, the latter incorporating dances, with chorus numbers and humorous scenes that are usually duets. These works are relatively short, and ticket prices were often low, to appeal to the general public. There are two main forms of &quot;zarzuela&quot;: Baroque &quot;zarzuela&quot; (–1750), the earliest style, and Romantic &quot;zarzuela&quot; (–1950), which can be further divided into the two subgenres of &quot;género grande&quot; and &quot;género chico&quot;.

Pedro Calderón de la Barca was the first playwright to adopt the term &quot;zarzuela&quot; for his work entitled &quot;El golfo de las sirenas&quot; (&quot;The Gulf of the Sirens&quot;, 1657). Lope de Vega soon wrote a work titled &quot;La selva sin amor, drama con orquesta&quot; (&quot;The Loveless Jungle, A Drama with Orchestra&quot;). The instruments orchestra was hidden from the audience, the actors sang in harmony, and the musical composition itself was intended to evoke an emotional response. Some of these early pieces were lost, but &quot;Los celos hacen estrellas&quot; (&quot;Jealousies Turn Into Stars&quot;) by Juan Hidalgo and Juan Vélez, which premiered in 1672, survives and gives us some sense of what the genre was like in the 17th century.

In the 18th century, the Italian operatic style influenced &quot;zarzuela&quot;. But beginning with the reign of Bourbon King Charles III, anti-Italian sentiment increased. &quot;Zarzuela&quot; returned to its roots in popular Spanish tradition in works such as the sainetes (or Entr&#x27;actes) of Don Ramón de la Cruz. This author&#x27;s first work in this genre was &quot;Las segadoras de Vallecas&quot; (&quot;The Reapers of Vallecas&quot;, 1768), with music by Rodríguez de Hita.

Single act &quot;zarzuelas&quot; were classified as &quot;género chico&quot; (the &quot;little genre&quot; or &quot;little form&quot;) and &quot;zarzuelas&quot; of three or more acts were &quot;género grande&quot; (the &quot;big genre&quot; or &quot;big form&quot;). &quot;Zarzuela grande&quot; battled on at the Teatro de la Zarzuela de Madrid, but with little success and light attendance. In spite of this, in 1873 a new theater, the Teatro Apolo, was opened for &quot;zarzuela grande&quot;, which shared the failures of the Teatro de la Zarzuela, until it was forced to change its program to &quot;género chico&quot;.

== Russian comic opera ==
The first opera presented in Russia, in 1731, was a comic opera (or &quot;commedia per musica&quot;), &quot;Calandro&quot;, by an Italian composer, Giovanni Alberto Ristori. It was followed by the comic operas of other Italians, like Galuppi, Paisiello and Cimarosa, and also Belgian/French composer Grétry.

The first Russian comic opera was &quot;Anyuta&quot; (1772). The text was written by Mikhail Popov, with music by an unknown composer, consisting of a selection of popular songs specified in the libretto. Another successful comic opera, &quot;The miller who was a wizard, a cheat and a matchmaker&quot;, text by Alexander Ablesimov (1779), on a subject resembling Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;Devin&quot;, is attributed to Mikhail Sokolovsky. Ivan Kerzelli, Vasily Pashkevich and Yevstigney Fomin also wrote a series of successful comic operas in the 18th century.

In the 19th century, Russian comic opera was further developed by Alexey Verstovsky who composed more 30 opera-vaudevilles and 6 grand operas (most of them with spoken dialogue). Later, Modest Mussorgsky worked on two comic operas, &quot;The Fair at Sorochyntsi&quot; and &quot;Zhenitba&quot; (&quot;The Marriage&quot;), which he left unfinished (they were completed only in the 20th century). Pyotr Tchaikovsky wrote a comic opera, &quot;Cherevichki&quot; (1885). Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov composed &quot;May Night&quot; 1878–1879 and &quot;The Golden Cockerel&quot; 1906–1907.

In the 20th century, the best examples of comic opera by Russian composers were Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Mavra&quot; (1922) and &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1951), Sergey Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;The Love for Three Oranges&quot; (1919) and &quot;Betrothal in a Monastery&quot; (1940–1941, staged 1946), and Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s &quot;The Nose&quot; (1927–1928, staged 1930). Simultaneously, the genres of light music, operetta, musical comedy, and later, rock opera, were developed by such composers as Isaak Dunayevsky, Dmitri Kabalevsky, Dmitri Shostakovich (Opus 105: &quot;Moscow, Cheryomushki&quot;, operetta in 3 acts, (1958)), Tikhon Khrennikov, and later by Gennady Gladkov, Alexey Rybnikov and Alexander Zhurbin.

The 21st century in Russian comic opera began with the noisy premieres of two works whose genre could be described as &quot;opera-farce&quot;: &quot;Tsar Demyan&quot; (&quot;Царь Демьян&quot;) – &quot;A frightful opera performance&quot;. A collective project of five authors wrote the work: Leonid Desyatnikov and Vyacheslav Gaivoronsky from St. Petersburg, Iraida Yusupova and Vladimir Nikolayev from Moscow, and the creative collective &quot;Kompozitor&quot;, which is a pseudonym for the well-known music critic Pyotr Pospelov. The libretto is by Elena Polenova, based on a folk-drama, &quot;Tsar Maksimilyan&quot;, and the work premiered on June 20, 2001, at the Mariinski Theatre, St Petersburg. Prize &quot;Gold Mask, 2002&quot; and &quot;Gold Soffit, 2002&quot;.

&quot;The Children of Rosenthal&quot; (&quot;Дети Розенталя&quot;), an opera in two acts by Leonid Desyatnikov, with a libretto by Vladimir Sorokin. This work was commissioned by the Bolshoi theatre and premiered on March 23, 2005. The staging of the opera was accompanied by juicy scandal; however it was an enormous success.

== English ballad and Savoy opera ==
England traces its light opera tradition to the ballad opera, typically a comic play that incorporated songs set to popular tunes. John Gay&#x27;s &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; was the earliest and most popular of these. Richard Brinsley Sheridan&#x27;s &quot;The Duenna&quot; (1775), with a score by Thomas Linley, was expressly described as &quot;a comic opera&quot;.

By the second half of the 19th century, the London musical stage was dominated by pantomime and musical burlesque, as well as bawdy, badly translated continental operettas, often including &quot;ballets&quot; featuring much prurient interest, and visiting the theatre became distasteful to the respectable public, especially women and children. Mr. and Mrs. Thomas German Reed, beginning in 1855, and a number of other Britons, deplored the risqué state of musical theatre and introduced short comic operas designed to be more family-friendly and to elevate the intellectual level of musical entertainments. Jessie Bond wrote,

The stage was at a low ebb, Elizabethan glories and Georgian artificialities had alike faded into the past, stilted tragedy and vulgar farce were all the would-be playgoer had to choose from, and the theatre had become a place of evil repute to the righteous British householder... A first effort to bridge the gap was made by the German Reed Entertainers.
Nevertheless, an 1867 production of Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein&quot; (seven months after its French première) ignited the English appetite for light operas with more carefully crafted librettos and scores, and continental European operettas continued to be extremely popular in Britain in the 1860s and 1870s, including &quot;Les Cloches de Corneville&quot;, &quot;Madame Favart&quot; and others into the 1880s, often adapted by H. B. Farnie and Robert Reece. F. C. Burnand collaborated with several composers, including Arthur Sullivan in &quot;Cox and Box&quot;, to write several comic operas on English themes in the 1860s and 1870s.

In 1875, Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte, one of the impresarios aiming to establish an English school of family-friendly light opera by composers such as Frederic Clay and Edward Solomon as a countermeasure to the continental operettas, commissioned Clay&#x27;s collaborator, W. S. Gilbert, and the promising young composer, Arthur Sullivan, to write a short one-act opera that would serve as an afterpiece to Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;La Périchole&quot;. The result was &quot;Trial by Jury&quot;; its success launched the Gilbert and Sullivan partnership. &quot;Mr. R. D&#x27;Oyly Carte&#x27;s Opera Bouffe Company&quot; took &quot;Trial&quot; on tour, playing it alongside French works by Offenbach and Alexandre Charles Lecocq. Eager to liberate the English stage from risqué French influences, and emboldened by the success of &quot;Trial by Jury&quot;, Carte formed a syndicate in 1877 to perform &quot;light opera of a legitimate kind&quot;. Gilbert and Sullivan were commissioned to write a new comic opera, &quot;The Sorcerer&quot;, starting the series that came to be known as the Savoy operas (named for the Savoy Theatre, which Carte later built for these works) that included &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;, &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; and &quot;The Mikado&quot;, which became popular around the world. The D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company continued to perform Gilbert and Sullivan almost continuously until it closed in 1982.

The Gilbert and Sullivan style was widely imitated by their contemporaries (for example, in &quot;Dorothy&quot;), and the creators themselves wrote works in this style with other collaborators in the 1890s. None of these, however, had lasting popularity, leaving the Savoy Operas as practically the sole representatives of the genre surviving today. Only recently, some of these other English light operas have begun to be explored by scholars and to receive performances and recordings.

== North American operetta and musical comedy ==

In the United States, Victor Herbert was one of the first to pick up the family-friendly style of light opera that Gilbert and Sullivan had made popular, although his music was also influenced by the European operetta composers. His earliest pieces, starting with &quot;Prince Ananias&quot; in 1894, were styled &quot;comic operas&quot;, but his later works were described as &quot;musical extravaganza&quot;, &quot;musical comedy&quot;, &quot;musical play&quot;, &quot;musical farce&quot;, and even &quot;opera comique&quot;. His two most successful pieces, out of more than half a dozen hits, were &quot;Babes in Toyland&quot; (1903) and &quot;Naughty Marietta&quot; (1910).

Others who wrote in a similar vein included Reginald de Koven, John Philip Sousa, Sigmund Romberg and Rudolf Friml. The modern American musical incorporated elements of the British and American light operas, with works like &quot;Show Boat&quot; and &quot;West Side Story&quot;, that explored more serious subjects and featured a tight integration among book, movement and lyrics.

In Canada, Oscar Ferdinand Telgmann and George Frederick Cameron composed in the Gilbert and Sullivan style of light opera. &quot;Leo, the Royal Cadet&quot; was performed for the first time on 11 July 1889 at Martin&#x27;s Opera House in Kingston, Ontario.

The line between light opera and other recent forms is difficult to draw. Several works are variously called operettas or musicals, such as &quot;Candide&quot; and &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot;, depending on whether they are performed in opera houses or in theaters. In addition, some recent American and British musicals make use of an operatic structure, for example, containing recurring motifs, and may even be sung through without dialogue. Those with orchestral scores are usually styled &quot;musicals&quot;, while those played on electronic instruments are often styled rock operas.

<doc id="690709" wikidata="Q317536" url="?curid=690709" title="Safet Sušić">
<text>Safet &quot;Pape&quot; Sušić (; born 13 April 1955) is a Bosnian professional football manager and former player. He was a gifted midfielder known for his dribbling skills and technical ability, and is strongly reputed to have been one of the finest European players of his generation. Sušić played for Yugoslavia in two FIFA World Cups, 1982 and 1990, and at UEFA Euro 1984. As a manager, he qualified the Bosnia and Herzegovina national team to the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

Sušić played as an attacking midfielder, often in a role of &quot;trequartista&quot; or &quot;fantasista&quot; (i.e. a creative playmaker) and rarely as a second striker for Sarajevo, Paris Saint-Germain and Red Star, and internationally for Yugoslavia. Even more later during his career, he was utilized more in a role of a deep-lying playmaker, both for club and national team. In 2010, &quot;France Football&quot; voted Sušić as Paris Saint-Germain&#x27;s best player of all time and the best foreign player of Ligue 1 of all time, with his compatriot and friend who also had a spell with PSG, Vahid Halilhodžić, being voted seventh. As part of the UEFA Jubilee Awards in 2004, the Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina chose Sušić as the nation&#x27;s greatest ever player.

Following his retirement from playing, Sušić started working as a manager. He worked for a number of club sides: Cannes, İstanbulspor, Al Hilal, Konyaspor, Ankaragücü, Çaykur Rizespor, Ankaraspor, Évian, Alanyaspor, Akhisarspor and the Bosnia and Herzegovina national team. Sušić won his only trophy as manager with Akhisarspor, the 2018 Turkish Super Cup.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Born in Zavidovići, FPR Yugoslavia, present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina, Sušić started playing football in the youth team of his hometown club Krivaja. In 1972, he joined the youth team of Sarajevo.

===Sarajevo===
Sušić made his senior debut for Sarajevo in 1973, one year after joining the youth team. During the 1979–80 season, he was the top scorer in the Yugoslav First League with 17 goals. In 1979, he was honoured as the Yugoslav Footballer of the Year, also being selected as the best athlete hailing from SR Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1981, Sušić was awarded the Sixth April Award of Sarajevo.

===Paris Saint-Germain===
In 1982, Sušić signed with Paris Saint-Germain, where he became a star on the European stage. During his first season with the club, Sušić helped PSG to win the 1982–83 Coupe de France, scoring three goals over two legs in the semi-final against Tours, and once in 3–2 victory over Nantes in the final. During the 1985–86 season, Sušić scored ten goals as the Parisiens won their first ever national league title.

Overall, Sušić scored 85 goals and made a record 95 assists for PSG between 1982 and 1991. He is fifth in the club&#x27;s all-time appearance list with 344 appearances, tied with Paul Le Guen. On 22 September 1984, in a 7–1 home drubbing of Bastia, he assisted on five of the side&#x27;s goals. At 36, Sušić went to the second Paris-based club for a final year with Red Star.

On 5 February 2010, &quot;France Football &quot;chose Sušić as the best player in the history of Paris Saint-Germain, ahead of players such as Carlos Bianchi, Mustapha Dahleb, Ronaldinho, George Weah, Joël Bats, Raí and Luis Fernández.

===Red Star===
In his only season with Red Star, he played in Ligue 2, the second division of French Football. He played in 17 league games for the club in that season campaign, scoring 3 goals in the process. Shortly after leaving Red Star, Sušić announced his retirement from football in 1992.

==International career==
During Sušić&#x27;s playing career, Bosnia and Herzegovina was part of SFR Yugoslavia and thus he represented the Yugoslavia national team at international level.

Between 1977 and 1990, Sušić appeared 54 times for Yugoslavia, scoring 21 times. He debuted for his country in 1977 and scored his first goals for the team against Hungary in October of that year. A month later, he scored a hat-trick in a 6–4 victory against Romania during the 1978 FIFA World Cup qualification. However, this was Yugoslavia&#x27;s only victory of their group and they failed to qualify for the tournament finals.

In June 1979, Sušić scored his second international hat-trick as Yugoslavia beat Italy 4–1 in a friendly match held in Zagreb. In September, he again scored three times in a 4–2 win over world champions Argentina.

Sušić was a member of the Yugoslav team that qualified for the 1982 FIFA World Cup, scoring once in a 5–0 win against Luxembourg.

Sušić was top scorer of Yugoslavia in qualification for UEFA Euro 1984. His two goals in a 3–2 win over Bulgaria in the final qualification fixture helped Yugoslavia to finish three points ahead of the Bulgarians and one point ahead of Wales and advance to the tournament finals. Yugoslavia ultimately finished bottom of their group in France, losing all three matches.

At the age of 35, Sušić made his second appearance at a World Cup finals as a member of Yugoslavia&#x27;s squad for the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy. He scored his only World Cup goal in the team&#x27;s 4–1 win against the United Arab Emirates during the group stage. He played 61 minutes before being substituted for Dejan Savićević in the penalty shootout loss to eventual runners-up Argentina at the quarter-final stage. His final international was a November 1990 European Championship qualification match away against Denmark.

In 2004, to celebrate UEFA&#x27;s Jubilee, Sušić was selected as the Golden Player of Bosnia and Herzegovina by the Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina as their most outstanding player of the past 50 years.

His former international teammate, Darko Pančev declared: 

==Managerial career==
===Early career===
Sušić first managed French club Cannes during the 1994–95 season and the beginning of the 1995–96. From 1996 until 1999, he managed İstanbulspor, then Al Hilal in 2001, Konyaspor from 2004 to 2005, Ankaragücü from 2005 until 2006, Çaykur Rizespor on two occasions, first in 2006 and the second time from 2007 to 2008. Sušić was then hired by Ankaraspor in March 2008. He left Ankaraspor in June 2008.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
====UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying====
On 28 December 2009, Sušić was named head coach of the Bosnia and Herzegovina national team. His debut was a friendly match against Ghana in Sarajevo. Bosnia and Herzegovina won the game 2–1 after goals from Vedad Ibišević and Miralem Pjanić. After only 2 wins in Sušić&#x27;s 6 first matches in charge of the national team, including an important 2–0 loss against France in the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying, Sušić came under a lot of criticism from several journalists and columnists who called for his head. Sušić recorded a 1–1 draw against France during a second game in Paris and ensured Bosnia and Herzegovina qualified for their second consecutive qualification play-off berth for UEFA Euro 2012 which was played against Portugal in November of that year.

====2014 FIFA World Cup====
From August 2012 to August 2013, Sušić&#x27;s Bosnia and Herzegovina side was on a nine-game unbeaten streak run. On 8 August 2013, the Bosnia and Herzegovina national team achieved their highest ever FIFA ranking, 13th place. On 15 October 2013, the country qualified for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, their first major tournament in the country&#x27;s history as an independent nation. Sušić&#x27;s side fared well in their first World Cup match against Argentina despite losing 2–1. An unlucky own goal and some brilliance from football legend Lionel Messi saw them to a defeat. However, highs taken from the match were the good play the team demonstrated and the materialisation of their first World Cup goal scored by Vedad Ibišević. The team however controversially exited the competition at the group stage of the tournament after their second game against Nigeria having an equaliser scored by Edin Džeko wrongly disallowed for offside. This revitalised the calls for reformation of the FIFA governing body and the replacement of linesmen with technology so as to remove human error from lines decisions. Bosnia and Herzegovina won their last game in the competition against Iran with a healthy 3–1 victory which would&#x27;ve seen them through instead of Nigeria, who incidentally failed to defeat Iran, to a round of 16 match with France.

====Contract extension and sacking====
In July 2014, Sušić signed a two-year contract to continue as head coach, after he withdrew his resignation. On 17 November 2014, the Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Sušić parted ways after poor showing of the national team in the first four games of the UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying.

===Évian===
On 13 July 2015, Sušić was named manager of French Ligue 2 club Évian. On his debut he registered a draw. After the first four rounds, his new side registered four drawn games.

On 11 January 2016, Sušić was sacked by Évian due to a run of poor results at the club. After 20 rounds, the club was placed 13th on the table and were eliminated from the Coupe de la Ligue at the third round. He was replaced by Romain Revelli.

===Alanyaspor===
On 27 January 2017, Sušić signed a contract with Alanyaspor until June 2018. He was sacked on 25 December 2017 because of a string of poor results.

===Akhisarspor===
On 30 June 2018, Sušić was named new manager of Turkish Cup winner Akhisarspor.

After about a month and a half, Akhisarspor as cup winners, participated in the Turkish Super Cup match against league champions Galatasaray. The result after full-time was 1–1, but Akhisar won 5–4 on penalties. That was Akhisar&#x27;s second mayor trophy in the club&#x27;s history and the first in Sušić&#x27;s managerial career.

On 17 September 2018, after only collecting two points in five games in the league, Sušić was sacked.

==Legacy==
&quot;Safet Sušić Pape&quot; is a bestseller novel written by Bosnian novelist Zlatko Topčić, and published in 2007. Popular Sarajevo sketch comedy and variety TV series, Top Lista Nadrealista, also on occasion treated a subject of football and popular sportsmen-women in their program, with songs dedicated to Sušić and Yugoslav national football team under management of another Sarajevan, Ivica Osim, being prominent feature of couple episodes.

==Personal life==
Sušić comes from a sporting family. Sead Sušić, a former footballer, is Safet&#x27;s older brother. Safet&#x27;s nephew, Tino-Sven Sušić, is also a footballer, formerly even a player of Sarajevo who also alongside Safet appeared at the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. Safet&#x27;s mother Paša died on 28 April 2018 at the age of 96.

<text>Operation Desert Lion began on 27 March 2003. Soldiers from the U.S. 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment and 82nd Airborne Division launched the operation in the Kohe Safi Mountains and surrounding areas in the Kandahar province of Afghanistan, near Bagram Air Base. Their mission was to hunt for supplies and members of the Taliban and Al-Qaida. The action began with soldiers debouching from Chinook and Black Hawk helicopters. The soldiers found two caches of weapons that included 107mm rockets, mortar rounds, recoilless rocket rounds, and cases of machine-gun ammunition just five kilometers from the air base. Disposal experts blew up the caches in place.

Combined Joint Task Force 180 spokeswoman Capt. Alayne Cramer said coalition troops had searched the area before. &quot;Intelligence sources and tips from local Afghans suggested we revisit the area,&quot; Cramer said.

On 29 March 2003 forces engaged in Operation Desert Lion received air support from two Norwegian F-16 fighter bombers flying on a routine patrol over the area. Operation Desert Lion was concluded on 30 March 2003.

<text>Zabranjeno Pušenje () is a Bosnian rock band formed in Sarajevo in 1980. The group&#x27;s musical style primarily consists of a distinctive garage rock sound with folk influences, often featuring innovative production and complex storytelling. Currently, the band consists of founding member, vocalist and guitarist Sejo Sexon, longtime drummer Branko Trajkov, guitarist Toni Lović, bassist Dejan Orešković, and violinist and keyboardist Robert Boldižar.

The band was formed contrary to the then prevalent Yugoslav punk rock and new wave, closely associated with the New Primitivism cultural movement and the radio and television satire and sketch comedy show &quot;Top lista nadrealista&quot;. They were one of the most popular musical acts of the 1980s in Yugoslavia, selling hundreds of thousands of records. Many times they got in trouble with the authorities for their, usually mild and sympathetic, criticism of the socialist system, and the habit of making light of issues considered sensitive at the time. The band&#x27;s first lineup, originally named Pseudobluz bend Zabranjeno Pušenje, featured guitarist Sejo Sexon and vocalist Nele Karajlić, alongside drummers Fu-Do then Šeki Gayton, bassist Munja Mitić, keyboardist Seid Mali Karajlić, saxophonist and flutist Ognjen Gajić, guitarist Mustafa Čengić, and synthesizerist Zoran Degan. Their debut studio album &quot;Das ist Walter&quot; (1984) was initially released in limited circulation; the final count was 100,000 copies sold, setting a record for exceeding the initial release by 30 times. Their subsequent album &quot;Dok čekaš sabah sa šejtanom&quot; (1985), also released through Jugoton, was boycotted by the mainstream media due to troubles with Communist authorities. In 1986, Šeki Gayton, Mitić and Čengić chose to leave the group, while drummer Faris Arapović, bassist Darko Ostojić, guitarist Kowalski and keyboardist Dado Džihan joined in. During the second half of 1980s with the new lineup of the band released two albums &quot;Pozdrav iz zemlje Safari&quot; (1987) and &quot;Male priče o velikoj ljubavi&quot; (1989) through Diskoton.

During 1992, the band split followed the Bosnian War, Nele Karajlić continued working in Belgrade under the names Nele Karajlić &amp; Zabranjeno Pušenje and Emir Kusturica &amp; The No Smoking Orchestra, while Sejo Sexon and other members rejoined in Sarajevo, using the original name, continuing the band&#x27;s career released the fifth studio album &quot;Fildžan viška&quot; (1997) with the changed lineup. The band&#x27;s 1990s lineup alongside Sejo Sexon featured the leader of the New Primitivism movement Elvis J. Kurtović, vocalist Marin Gradac, a guest on the 1987 album bassist Dragan Bobić, guitarist Sejo Kovo and violinist Bruno Urlić. After one temporary drummer, Branko Trajkov joined the group in 1996. The same lineup recorded the album &quot;Agent tajne sile&quot; (1999). In 2000, Kurtović, Kovo, and Gradac left the group, while guitarist and producer Dragianni joined the group and played on their subsequent album, &quot;Bog vozi Mercedes&quot; (2001). That album was followed five years later by &quot;Hodi da ti čiko nešto da&quot; (2006). In the mid-2000s, Dragianni, Bobić, and Urlić chose to leave the group, while guitarist Toni Lović, bassist Dejan Orešković, and violinist Robert Boldižar came to their seats. The band&#x27;s ninth studio album, &quot;Muzej revolucije&quot; (2009), was released on the Anniversary of the October Revolution in almost all former Yugoslav countries, on the same day. The band released their tenth studio album, &quot;Radovi na cesti&quot;, in 2013. Their eleventh studio album was released in 2018, titled &quot;Šok i nevjerica&quot;. The twelfth and another double studio album &quot;Karamba!&quot; was released in 2022.

== History ==
===Background===
What would eventually become Zabranjeno Pušenje was started in 1979 by sixteen-year-old Nenad Janković (later to become known as dr. Nele Karajlić) and eighteen-year-old Davor Sučić (later Mr. Sejo Sexon), two teenage friends and neighbors who had been attending Sarajevo Second Gymnasium secondary school while residing in the same apartment building on Fuad Midžić Street in the Sarajevo neighborhood of Koševo. Already infatuated with and deeply immersed in rock and roll, the two fanatically absorbed various musical influences from Yugoslavia and abroad, all the while desperately trying to achieve a basic level of technical proficiency on their instruments—at this stage, Nele Karajlić played the piano, an instrument he had previously studied in music school for a short time before dropping out, while Sejo Sexon played the guitar. Both possessing very limited musical knowledge, despite displaying boundless enthusiasm, the duo struggled with everything from simply tuning their instruments to producing the simplest of melodies.

Sexon and Karajlić soon expanded their setup by adding Ognjen Gajić, another neighborhood teenage friend who possessed some basic musical knowledge having attended a music school. Though by Karajlić&#x27;s own admission, Gajić played the piano better than him, Gajić decided to switch over to flute as an homage to his favorite band Jethro Tull. He managed to become comfortable on a new instrument fairly quickly, soon becoming a bit of a musical authority among this now three-piece.

Since each of the three teenage members of the group (by now informally known as Pseudobluz bend) lived with their parents, the band rehearsals also took place in their parents&#x27; apartments, mostly Karajlić&#x27;s and Gajić&#x27;s.

Before long, Sexon brought in Zenit Đozić (a.k.a. Zena, later to become known as Fu-Do), his new classmate at Second Gymnasium who had recently moved to Sarajevo from Bugojno, to be the band&#x27;s drummer. Adding percussions, that actually consisted of pots and pans, to their setup created new problems as the noise during rehearsals became unbearable for Karajlić&#x27;s parents and Gajić&#x27;s mother so the members set about looking for a suitable rehearsal space.

=== 1980–1983: Early years ===
In fall 1980, in accordance with the newly-passed Yugoslav law requiring high school graduates to immediately report for their compulsory military service in the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army, nineteen-year-old Sexon left Sarajevo and was away from the band for a whole year. With Sexon temporarily gone, the band got a new member – Mustafa Čengić (a.k.a. MuČe or Mujo Snažni) who, in turn, brought in Mladen Mitić (a.k.a. Munja or Mitke) on bass guitar. They were occasionally accompanied by Mirko Srdić (later to become known as Elvis J. Kurtović), Zoran Degan, Boris Šiber, Samir Ćeremida, etc. In December 1980, MuČe and Munja managed to get the band on the bill of a Želimir Altarac Čičak-organized new music showcase at Sarajevo&#x27;s Dom mladih, held under the &quot;Nove nade, nove snage&quot; (&#x27;New Blood, New Hopefuls&#x27;) mantra. The event would be the band&#x27;s first-ever live public performance though they did play a small show at Sarajevo&#x27;s Fifth Gymnasium for their social circle a few days earlier on 30 November 1980 as preparation for the Dom mladih gig. Shortly before Čičak&#x27;s show at Dom mladih, the band changed its name to Pseudobluz bend Zabranjeno Pušenje. Over time, they dropped the first part and continued as just Zabranjeno Pušenje for brevity.

Their first recording, song &quot;Penzioneri na more idu zimi&quot; (), was made for Radio Sarajevo in early 1981. Additionally, from May 1981, Karajlić and occasionally a few other band members became involved with the &quot;Top lista nadrealista&quot; radio segment, which aired weekly as part of the &quot;Primus&quot; program on Radio Sarajevo&#x27;s channel two. &quot;Penzioneri na more idu zimi&quot; began getting some modest airplay on Radio Sarajevo throughout the year, leading to an increasing number of youths in the city making the connection between the band and the weekly comedy radio segment. In early fall 1981, along with a number of upstart Sarajevo bands such as , , Ema, , , Super 98, Negra, Žaoka, Ozbiljno Pitanje, Linija Života, Lucifer, Tečni Kristal, Tina, and Bedž, Zabranjeno Pušenje were booked for a multi-act gig as opening acts for headliners Indexi, Bulevar, Paraf, Zana, Aerodrom, Laboratorija Zvuka, and Bijelo Dugme – all part of the &#x27;Mladost Sutjeske&#x27; event commemorating and celebrating the Battle of Sutjeska from World War II. Held at Skenderija sports arena on 3 October 1981, it was the band&#x27;s biggest show to date and the youngsters left a memorable impression as singer Karajlić and drummer Đozić were about to leave for their mandatory army services just as guitarist Sexon was completing his.

=== 1984–1989: Breakthrough and rising fame in Yugoslavia===
The band performed around Sarajevo for two years before beginning to record material for a debut album during Fall 1983 in producer a modest studio owned by &quot;Paša&quot; Ferović. The shambolic recording process took seven months before the album named &quot;Das ist Walter&quot; got released by Jugoton in April 1984 in the small print of 3,000 copies, clearly indicative of the label&#x27;s extremely low commercial expectations. The line-up was altered and now Nenad Janković&#x27;s younger brother keyboardist Dražen Janković (a.k.a. Seid Mali Karajlić) and drummer Predrag Rakić (a.k.a. Šeki Gayton). Though the album was initially released in the small print, the final count was 100,000 copies sold, setting a record for exceeding the initial release by 30 times. In Autumn 1984, they embarked on a 60-concert nationwide concert tour, making them one of the biggest Yugoslav rock attractions after just one album.

During that tour, at their concert in Rijeka on November 27, 1984, Nele Karajlić declared, referring to an amplifier that had just broken down, &quot;Crk&#x27;o Maršal. Mislim na pojačalo.&quot; (), which was recognized as a pun on Marshal Tito&#x27;s death, landing the band in trouble. They were criticized by the media and a campaign against them resulted in the canceling of their concerts and the removal of &quot;Top lista nadrealista&quot; from the air. The affair got attention of the Yugoslav Security Administration (UDBA), as well. They were rescued by some leading liberal intellectuals, and magazines such as Polet, Mladina and Slobodna Dalmacija, who raise their voices in the defense of the group members and that affair snaps without prison sentences. Later, Sexon said that their amplifiers weren&#x27;t even Marshall, and that it was a joke.

In this atmosphere, the band recorded their second, double album &quot;Dok čekaš sabah sa šejtanom&quot; () in the infamous SIM studio and released it in July 1985. The album has received widespread acclaim from critics, but was boycotted by the media. Following promotional tour had extreme difficulties due to concern of the concert hosts and the enormous presence of the state police, as a reflection of the Marshall Affair. Despite several top concerts such as at Pionir Hall in Belgrade, Poljud in Split or Dom Sportova in Zagreb, tens of thousands sold tickets, the tour had a rather disappointing conclusion as the following year Šeki Gayton and Mustafa Čengić left the band in search of a more secure means of making a living. Mladen Mitić left in late 1986 after contributing to the development of the third album.

The rest of the band was working on a subsequent album and slowly assembled a new band lineup, featured drummer Faris Arapović and guitarist Predrag Kovačević (a.k.a. Kova or Kowalski) and bassist Emir Kusturica. At the time, Kusturica was notable filmmaker who won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1985 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film with the &quot;When Father Was Away on Business&quot;. This refreshed lineup, in collaboration with some studio musicians such as bassist Dragan Bobić and back-vocalists Dado Džihan and Darko Ostojić, released &quot;Pozdrav iz zemlje Safari&quot; () through Diskoton in 1987. Diskoton censors had some objections and the song &quot;Our Proposal for the Eurovision Song Contest&quot; had to be renamed, since the song included comments on the depressed state of the economy and the lack of freedom of expression. The album again included a number of hit songs, such as &quot;Pišonja i Žuga&quot;, &quot;Hadžija ili bos&quot;, &quot;Fikreta&quot;, &quot;Dan Republike&quot;, and returned the band to stardom. The album was recorded in Sarajevo and mixed in London, UK, while the record producer was Sven Rustempašić, a Seattle-based producer born in Sarajevo. The following tour, which included 87 concerts, was the largest Zabranjeno Pušenje tour thus far and the band was by that time regarded as one of the Yugoslav rock powerhouse alongside Azra, Bijelo Dugme and Parni Valjak. In January 1988, the band received a gold record for 100,000 copies sold.

In October 1988, the band released their fourth album &quot;Male priče o velikoj ljubavi&quot; (). The songs were mostly written and produced by Sejo Sexon. The album featured opera singer Sonja Milenković, violinist Dejan Sparavalo and Goran Bregović as backing vocal and guitar player. The album was an average success. The band embarked on the tour with Bombaj štampa and the rest of &quot;Top lista nadrealista&quot; crew (those who didn&#x27;t play in the band already). The tour (a combination of theatre and rock and roll, an idea by Sejo Sexon, was a great success and regarded as the best tour of 1989 with around 60 concerts and more than 200,000 visitors.

=== 1990–1995: Band split and transitional period ===

Nele Karajlić and Sejo Sexon, the band&#x27;s leading duo, were getting on increasingly colder terms and the Yugoslavia-wide tour with Bombaj Štampa and &quot;Top lista nadrealista&quot; during early 1990, though hugely commercially successful, only exacerbated their fractured business and personal relationship. The band broke up in late summer 1990 when Sejo Sexon informed Karajlić about no longer being interested in playing with him. Sejo Sexon, Darko Ostojić and Faris Arapović left the band due to different views on the band vision more than the political differences in Yugoslav leadership in the late 1980s. In that time, Sejo Sexon and Ostojić worked on their solo record for Diskoton, but that studio album went unreleased due to the start of the Bosnian War. Arapović joined the Sarajevo-based alternative rock band Sikter.

In April 1992, the Bosnian War began. Nele Karajlić had fled to Belgrade and continued working under the name Nele Karajlić &amp; Zabranjeno Pušenje, later better known as Emir Kusturica &amp; The No Smoking Orchestra. Sejo Sexon, along with Elvis J. Kurtović, Zenit Đozić, Boris Šiber and the band&#x27;s album cover designer Srđan Velimirović, remained in besieged Sarajevo, taking part in the wartime spinoff of &quot;Top lista nadrealista&quot;. In late June 1992, &quot;Top lista nadrealista&quot; crew started to work on a 15-minute weekly radio shows. In August 1993, after 50 odd shows on radio, the group shot and aired four television episodes. Sejo Sexon produced a soundtrack for TV series and a theater play &quot;Top lista nadrealista&quot;. After the Bosnian War Sejo Sexon moved to Zagreb, Croatia where he lived for some time. Later he came back to Sarajevo and together with Elvis J. Kurtović, who occasionally worked on the band&#x27;s recordings, restored Zabranjeno Pušenje. After reunion of the band in 1996, Sejo Sexon and Elvis J. Kurović had more than 300 occasions where then performed live &quot;Top lista nadrealista&quot; across Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Slovenia, Germany, Austria, Denmark, and Switzerland. That tour was supported by the USAID office in Sarajevo.

=== 1996–2001: New beginnings in the post-Yugoslav area===
In 1996, Sejo Sexon and Elvis J. Kurović accompanied with members of the &quot;Top lista nadrealista&quot; pit orchestra such as Sejo Kovo, Đani Pervan, Dušan Vranić, and Samir Ćeremida had become the core of the renewed band&#x27;s lineup. During that time, the band works on their new studio album. The fifth album of Zabranjeno Pušenje &quot;Fildžan viška&quot; () is released through Dallas Records and Nimfa Sound in 1997. Sejo Sexon produced the album and wrote all songs with some help of Elvis J. Kurtović. &quot;Fildžan viška&quot; was produced four singles; &quot;Možeš imat&#x27; moje tijelo&quot;, &quot;Mile Hašišar&quot;, &quot;Pubertet&quot; and &quot;Fildžan viška&quot;. Music videos for those single are produced by the band members. Production know-how from &quot;Top lista nadrealista&quot; has proven to be valuable in recording music videos, which were rated very well in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Slovenia where the band performed regularly. Touring musicians were Sejo Sexon, Elvis J. Kurtović, Predrag Bobić, Zoran Stojanović, Nedžad Podžić, Marin Gradac, Bruno Urlić and Branko Trajkov, while Samir Ćeramida and Đani Pervan performed occasionally. The same lineup released the first live album &quot;Hapsi sve!&quot; through Croatia Records and A Records in 1998. The songs are recorded over two nights at Dom Sportova, in Zagreb on July 10, 1997, and at the Metalac schoolyard in Sarajevo on September 25, 1997. In the same time, the band had two guest appearances of Rambo Amadeus at their concerts for the &quot;Fildžan viška&quot; album promotion in Sarajevo. Those appearances were the first post-war performance by a Serbian-Montenegrin artist to the Bosnian Federation. In early 1997, Dario Vitez became executive producer, public relations manager and tour manager of the band.

The writing and formation of the band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Agent tajne sile&quot; () began immediately following the culmination of the promotional tour for &quot;Fildžan viška&quot;, in the start of 1999, at the Bjelolasica Olympic Centre in Gorski kotar, Croatia. The album was recorded in Rent-A-Cow Studio in Amsterdam, the Netherlands in March 1999 and produced by Sejo Sexon and Zlaja Jeff Hadžić. &quot;Agent tajne sile&quot; is released in June 1999 through TLN-Europa, an independent record label founded and own by Sejo Sexon. The record produced four singles; &quot;Pos&#x27;o, kuća, birtija&quot;, &quot;Agent tajne sile&quot;, &quot;Jugo 45&quot; and &quot;Pupoljak&quot;. The record&#x27;s third single, &quot;Jugo 45&quot;, was the band&#x27;s fastest-selling single, debuting on top of the Bosnian and Croatian charts. The band began another tour in support of &quot;Agent tajne sile&quot; in 1999, beginning with promotional concerts in Bosnia and Croatia with the touring lineup: Sejo Sexon, Marin Gradac, Elvis J. Kurtović, Predrag Bobić, Bruno Urlić, Dragomir Herendić, and Branko Trajkov. In a short while, Marin Gradac and Elvis J. Kurtović chose to leave the group due to other commitments. Gradac went to finish Sarajevo Music Academy and joined Radio Sarajevo Orchestra, while Elvis J. Kurtović began writing his solo album.
In early 2000, the band came back to the Bjelolasica Olympic Centre to work on the band&#x27;s seventh album. In the meantime, the band got a new member; world-class percussionist Albin Jarić, better known as Jimi Rasta, who worked previously with musicians such as Dave Stewart and Eric Clapton. &quot;Bog vozi Mercedes&quot; () was record by home made production in improvised studios in Bjelolasica and Ivanić Grad from March to June 2001. This record was planned to be a noncommercial break from the major music projects. No one expected that it would become one of the most selling Zabranjeno Pušenje albums. The album is released in December 2001 through TLN-Europa and Menart Records, and went on to sell more than 35,000 copies. Sejo Sexon wrote and produced four music videos, out of six released. For the song &quot;Arizona Dream&quot; the band won the 2002 Davorin Award for the best rock song. The concert tour by the band in support of their seventh studio album had 250 concerts.

In 2001, the band members took a part in a social responsibility project in which they organized music workshops for children and youth who were victims of land mines. Project was supported by embassies of Canada, Norway and the U.S. in Zagreb.

=== 2002–2011: Continued success ===
In 2002, the band went on the North American tour. On May 26, they had recorded the band&#x27;s second live album at the Casa Loma Ballroom in St. Louis, Missouri. In 2004, the band released &quot;Live in St. Louis&quot;. This live album featured two new music videos, &quot;Zenica Blues&quot; and &quot;Posljednja oaza (Fikreta)&quot;. They made the video for their 1980s hit &quot;Zenica Blues&quot; following the 20th Anniversary of the song&#x27;s release. The video was shot in the Zenica prison. In 2003, Zabranjeno Pušenje was awarded for their outstanding live performance on the Baščaršija Nights festival in Sarajevo. During 2004, Albin Jarić, Bruno Urlić and Dragomir Herendić left the group due to other commitments. Jarić devotes himself to family life in Kranj, Slovenia. Herendić completed his own studio in Ivanić Grad and get focused on his production career. Urlić took over band-leadership of the Macedonian folk band Ezerki &amp; 7/8 from Zagreb. and started his studio music and production career.

In a short period without guitarists and violinists, Sejo Sexon, Trajkov, and Bobić began the writing and formation on sketches of something that will evolve in three years to the double-full-length studio album. In a short period of time, violinist Robert Boldižar and guitarist Toni Lović joined in. Boldižar was touring musician in 1997, while the band&#x27;s violinist Urlić was on leave to Paris, France. The new lineup immediately began to wrap up music for the next album and went on a short tour. Meanwhile, keyboardist Paul Kempf step in the empty seat. In 2005, right after record producer Denis Mujadžić (a.k.a. Denyken) joined the record project, Sejo Sexon got the opportunity to write a film score for the 2006 Bosnian action comedy film &quot;Nafaka&quot; directed by Jasmin Duraković. On that project he got an opportunity to collaborate with prominent musicians of different genres, such as: Halid Bešlić, Arsen Dedić, Lucija Šerbedžija, and the Mosque Choir Arabeske. On June 26, 2006, the song &quot;Nema više&quot;, the first single from their upcoming album and &quot;Nafaka Soundtrack&quot; as well, was released and became a hit single. Sejo Sexon wrote this song with a Bosnian prose writer and playwright Nenad Veličković. On November 16, 2006, the band released their eighth studio album &quot;Hodi da ti čiko nešto da!&quot; (), their first double album since &quot;Dok čekaš sabah sa šejtanom&quot; (1985).

Although the concert tour was truly enviable as in the time before, the period after the 2006 album release, next to the Australian Tour and the concerts in Paris and London, brought two great disappointments to the band, cancellations of the significant concerts in Belgrade and Sarajevo. At the first, there was a cancellation of the Sarajevo Concert as a result of the voracity of the Sarajevo Film Festival Board, who managed to redirect the concert&#x27;s sponsorships to the Festival&#x27;s budget. Next hit was wresting the 29 November Concert in Belgrade by former band members settled in Belgrade and gathered around The No Smoking Orchestra. The band had the &quot;Day of the Republic&quot; project in which 29 November should become the traditional concert date for Belgrade fans.

In September 2008, a longtime bassist Predrag Bobić left the bend after a farewell concert at Zagreb&#x27;s lake Bundek. Afterwards, guitarist Dejan Orešković, former bassist of Divlje jagode, joined the group and played on their subsequent album.

The ninth studio album &quot;Muzej revolucije&quot; () is released on November 7, 2009, on the 92nd anniversary of the October Revolution. The album is released on the same day through various record labels in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia. The record produced five singles; &quot;Modni Guru&quot;, &quot;Kladimo se&quot;, &quot;Kada Sena pleše&quot;, &quot;Tvoja bosa stopala&quot; and &quot;Samir-time&quot;. In 2011, Sejo Sexon directed a music video for the third single of &quot;Muzej revolucije&quot;, entitled &quot;Kada Sena pleše&quot;. It was his directorial debut. Also, he wrote the script for the same music video. On June 25, 2012, the band released the video for &quot;Samir-time&quot;, the fifth and last single of &quot;Muzej revolucije&quot;.

=== 2012–present: Tenth studio album and recent years ===
In 2012, Sejo Sexon and Toni Lović entered the studio to begin writing for their tenth studio album. On October 10, 2013, &quot;Radovi na cesti&quot; () was released through Croatia Records and Dallas Records. The album was met with mostly positive reviews from the critics. The record produced six singles; &quot;Boško i Admira&quot;, &quot;Ti voliš sapunice&quot;, &quot;Tri kile, tri godine&quot;, &quot;U Tvoje ime&quot;, &quot;Klasa optimist&quot; and &quot;Kafana kod Keke&quot;.

On December 28, 2013, Sejo Sexon and Zabranjeno Pušenje celebrated 30th Anniversary of the band with their fans on a concert in Skenderija, Sarajevo. In January 2016, saxophonist and flautist Lana Škrgatić joined the band. As a new band member, she appeared for the first time in the 2016 music video for the fifth &quot;Radovi na cesti&quot; single &quot;Klasa optimist&quot;. Keyboardist Paul Kempf left the band in early 2017. The band appeared on two biggest Serbian music festivals in 2017, they performed live at the EXIT Summer of Love 2017 in Novi Sad, and at the Belgrade Beer Fest.

On October 31, 2018, the band released their eleventh studio album &quot;Šok i nevjerica&quot; (). The songs were mostly written and produced by Sejo Sexon and Toni Lović. The album featured Bosnian rapper Sassja and Bosnian singer and composer Damir Imamović. In November 2019, Lana Škrgatić parted ways with the band to join a female music band.

In 2020 and 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic, band members recorded 16 new songs for the new studio album. All songs were written and produced by Sejo Sexon and Toni Lović, while the arrangement is jointly signed with other band members. For the first time in 15 years, they collaborated with Elvis J. Kurtović, a former band member. Thus, in June 2020, they released a single and a music video for the song &quot;Korona hit pozitivan&quot; (), which was made in collaboration with Kurtović.

== Musical style ==
In the early 1980s, when the rest of the Yugoslav popular music scene followed the trends in Europe of the early 1980s, chiefly punk rock and new wave, Zabranjeno Pušenje were part of a unique rock movement centered in Sarajevo that forged its own path. This movement, for the most part, centered on simple, youthful, garage rock, with folk influences and a distinctive Sarajevo urban feel called New Primitivism.

The songs range from punk rock to rock, frequently arranged to feature trumpets and saxophones, adding to the band&#x27;s unique sound, along with many samples and soundbites from the period. Zabranjeno Pušenje captured the feel of Sarajevo, its idols and local heroes along with tales of love and loss, in a distinctive and often humorous way. Very visual and cynical, the band&#x27;s lyrics were progressive enough to show the last stages of Yugoslav socialism (songs &quot;Dan republike&quot;, &quot;Srce ruke i lopata&quot;, &quot;Abid&quot;, &quot;Guzonjin sin&quot;), alternate clubs (&quot;Pišonja i Žuga u paklu droge&quot;, &quot;Javi mi&quot;), as well as providing morbid hints for the Yugoslav Wars (&quot;Kanjon Drine&quot;, &quot;Zvijezda nad Balkanom&quot;).

<text>Sergej Barbarez (; born 17 September 1971) is a Bosnian professional football manager and former player who is the manager of the Bosnia and Herzegovina national team. 

A forward, Barbarez played for several clubs in the German Bundesliga. He is considered one of the all-time greatest players of Hamburger SV where he scored 65 goals in 174 Bundesliga games. Mainly used as a second striker, Barbarez also played as an attacking midfielder or left winger. In the 2000–01 Bundesliga season while playing for Hamburger SV, he was joint top scorer with 22 goals with Ebbe Sand of Schalke 04 at the end of the season.

Barbarez made his senior international debut for the Bosnia and Herzegovina national team in 1998, earning 47 caps and scoring 17 goals until 2006. He was the captain of the national team between 2004 and 2006.

==Early life==
Barbarez was born in Mostar, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, SFR Yugoslavia, present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina to a Bosnian Serb father and a half-Croat and half-Bosniak mother.

As a young child, he was actually not very interested in football but in basketball and athletics. However, at the age of eleven, Barbarez started playing football though mostly for fun with friends after school.

==Club career==
In 1984, Barbarez took a step further and started playing football for the youth team of Velež in his native city of Mostar.

Some six years later, he signed with the first team of Velež at the age of 19. However, briefly after, Barbarez served in the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army in Zagreb in 1991 before returning to Mostar to continue his career. In 1991, he returned to Velež and soon after everyone realized that Barbarez was a true talent.

The same year, he visited his uncle who was living in Germany. Some time later, Barbarez was preparing to return to Mostar but his uncle surprised him by extending his stay in Germany for two weeks. The uncle had arranged for him a two weeks try-out practise with Hannover 96. The coach of Hannover 96 was so impressed by Barbarez that he signed him for the club. During those same two weeks the political situation throughout former Yugoslavia was deteriorating by the minute and fighting was even occurring in some places. So Barbarez came to an agreement with his father to stay with his uncle in Germany for the near future.

In April 1992, the Bosnian War escalated in the city of Mostar. A month prior of the actual war, the father and sister of Barbarez fled with his high school sweetheart Ana to the city of Hanover in Germany. His mother Zlata stayed in Mostar throughout the whole war.

Barbarez played for Hannover 96 during the second half of the 1991–92 and the whole 1992–93 season. Between 1993 and 1996, he played for Union Berlin at the third level before signing with Hansa Rostock. Barbarez played there between 1996 and 1998.

In 1998, he signed with Borussia Dortmund and played there until joining Hamburger SV in July 2000.

During the first season with Hamburger SV, Barbarez became the top scorer for his club with 22 goals and joint top scorer of the Bundesliga with Ebbe Sand. Though, he could not help Hamburg&#x27;s elimination from the 2000–01 UEFA Champions League at the group stages despite his two goals, when the club qualified for that competition for the first time, after a third place in the previous domestic Bundesliga season.

On 17 May 2006, Barbarez signed a two-year deal with Bayer Leverkusen. He finished his career at Bayer after his contract with the club expired in June 2008.

==International career==

On 14 May 1998, Barbarez made his debut for the Bosnia and Herzegovina national team against Argentina in a friendly match.

Barbarez scored two goals against Liechtenstein in a World Cup qualification match on 28 March 2001. He was denied a hat-trick as his second-half penalty was saved by Lichtenstein goalkeeper Peter Jehle.

Before retiring from international football in October 2005, Barbarez was the captain of the Bosnian national team.

On 2 December 2005, he announced his comeback to the national team and played in the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifiers. He became captain of the team once again.

On 12 October 2006, Barbarez officially stepped down from playing for the Bosnia and Herzegovina national team and retired permanently from professional football in June 2008. His final international was an October 2006 European Championship qualification match against Moldova.

==Managerial career==
Barbarez announced on 14 December 2009 that he wanted to be the head coach of the Bosnia and Herzegovina national team in the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifiers. However, the Football Association of Republika Srpska blocked his entry and later on, Safet Sušić was selected as the new head coach of the Bosnia and Herzegovina national team.

On 5 January 2011, Barbarez received his UEFA Pro Licence in the Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s educational facility in Jablanica.

On 19 April 2024, Barbarez was appointed as the new head coach of the Bosnia and Herzegovina national team, signing a four-year contract with the Bosnian FA.

==Personal life==
Barbarez is married to his high-school sweetheart Ana, who is also from Mostar. They have two sons together, Filip-André (born 1994) and Sergio-Luis (1999). Barbarez was a member of the board of directors of Hamburger SV between 25 January 2009 and 28 May 2010.

<text>In graph theory, a harmonious coloring is a (proper) vertex coloring in which every pair of colors appears on &quot;at most&quot; one pair of adjacent vertices. It is the opposite of the complete coloring, which instead requires every color pairing to occur &quot;at least&quot; once. The harmonious chromatic number of a graph is the minimum number of colors needed for any harmonious coloring of .

Every graph has a harmonious coloring, since it suffices to assign every vertex a distinct color; thus . There trivially exist graphs with (where is the chromatic number); one example is any path of , which can be 2-colored but has no harmonious coloring with 2 colors.

Some properties of :
:formula_1
where is the complete -ary tree with 3 levels. (Mitchem 1989)

Harmonious coloring was first proposed by Harary and Plantholt (1982). Still very little is known about it.

<text>Gbadolite or Gbado-Lite () is the capital of Nord-Ubangi Province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The town is located south of the Ubangi River at the border to the Central African Republic and northeast of the national capital Kinshasa. Gbadolite was the ancestral home and residence of Joseph-Désiré Mobutu, later self-styled as Mobutu Sese Seko where airport, colleges, malls, supermarkets and libraries were built by the President in a program of modernization. Gbadolite is where Mobutu led the summit that would produce the Gbadolite Declaration, a short lived ceasefire in the Angolan Civil War, in 1989.

==History==
Mobutu built Gbadolite into a luxurious town often nicknamed &quot;Versailles of the Jungle&quot;. He built a hydroelectric dam on the nearby Ubangi River in Mobayi Mbongo, an international airport, Gbadolite Airport, which could accommodate a Concorde, and three large palaces. As a result, the people of the town had no trouble finding jobs. During Mobutu&#x27;s regime, Gbadolite also had companies such as CDIA Zaire for farming productions, SOZAGEC for road construction, and SAFRICAS for house construction. The town had a general hospital with high tech facilities, supermarkets or malls, which were destroyed in 1997. Gbadolite had also College Presidentiel, a high school famous for its academic excellence and administered by Jesuit Fathers to whom Mobutu gave the school. This school had a chemistry lab, physics lab, computer lab, Olympic game facilities, and band instruments of all kinds. The town was also famous for its Chapelle Marie la Misericorde, a luxurious church in which Mobutu buried his first wife, Mama Mobutu.

Two palaces were built outside Gbadolite at Kawele. One was an elaborate complex of Chinese pagodas, while the other was a modern mansion. Both were used as residences for Mobutu and guests. The three-story palace in Gbadolite was used primarily for public functions.

Mobutu also built a nuclear bunker that could house more than 500 people and was the largest in Africa; this was the only nuclear bunker in Central Africa. The bunker was connected to the Ubangui River by a secret tunnel, giving access to the military harbour at the village of N&#x27;dangi.

When Laurent Kabila successfully led a rebellion and ousted Mobutu in 1997, Gbadolite was raided, and most of what was in the palaces was looted. The palaces are now being overrun by vegetation.

In 1998, the Ugandan backed MLC (Mouvement de Libération du Congo) rebel group, led by Jean-Pierre Bemba, captured Gbadolite from Kabila&#x27;s government and it became the MLC&#x27;s headquarters.

<text>In graph theory, a complete coloring is a (proper) vertex coloring in which every pair of colors appears on &quot;at least&quot; one pair of adjacent vertices. Equivalently, a complete coloring is minimal in the sense that it cannot be transformed into a proper coloring with fewer colors by merging pairs of color classes. The achromatic number of a graph is the maximum number of colors possible in any complete coloring of .

A complete coloring is the opposite of a harmonious coloring, which requires every pair of colors to appear on &quot;at most&quot; one pair of adjacent vertices.

==Complexity theory==
Finding is an optimization problem. The decision problem for complete coloring can be phrased as:

:INSTANCE: a graph and positive integer 
:QUESTION: does there exist a partition of into or more disjoint sets such that each is an independent set for and such that for each pair of distinct sets is not an independent set.

Determining the achromatic number is NP-hard; determining if it is greater than a given number is NP-complete, as shown by Yannakakis and Gavril in 1978 by transformation from the minimum maximal matching problem.

Note that any coloring of a graph with the minimum number of colors must be a complete coloring, so minimizing the number of colors in a complete coloring is just a restatement of the standard graph coloring problem.

==Algorithms==
For any fixed &quot;k&quot;, it is possible to determine whether the achromatic number of a given graph is at least &quot;k&quot;, in linear time.

The optimization problem permits approximation and is approximable within a formula_1 approximation ratio.

==Special classes of graphs==
The NP-completeness of the achromatic number problem holds also for some special classes of graphs:
bipartite graphs,
complements of bipartite graphs (that is, graphs having no independent set of more than two vertices), cographs and interval graphs, and even for trees.

For complements of trees, the achromatic number can be computed in polynomial time. For trees, it can be approximated to within a constant factor.

The achromatic number of an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional hypercube graph is known to be proportional to formula_2, but the constant of proportionality is not known precisely.

<doc id="690742" wikidata="Q5419220" url="?curid=690742" title="Exact coloring">
<text>In graph theory, an exact coloring is a (proper) vertex coloring in which every pair of colors appears on exactly one pair of adjacent vertices.
That is, it is a partition of the vertices of the graph into disjoint independent sets such that, for each pair of distinct independent sets in the partition, there is exactly one edge with endpoints in each set.

==Complete graphs, detachments, and Euler tours==

Every &quot;n&quot;-vertex complete graph &quot;K&quot;&quot;n&quot; has an exact coloring with &quot;n&quot; colors, obtained by giving each vertex a distinct color.
Every graph with an &quot;n&quot;-color exact coloring may be obtained as a &quot;detachment&quot; of a complete graph, a graph obtained from the complete graph by splitting each vertex into an independent set and reconnecting each edge incident to the vertex to exactly one of the members of the corresponding independent set.

When &quot;k&quot; is an odd number, A path or cycle with formula_1 edges has an exact coloring, obtained by forming an exact coloring of the complete graph &quot;K&quot;&quot;k&quot; and then finding an Euler tour of this complete graph. For instance, a path with three edges has a complete 3-coloring.

==Related types of coloring==
Exact colorings are closely related to harmonious colorings (colorings in which each pair of colors appears at most once) and complete colorings (colorings in which each pair of colors appears at least once). Clearly, an exact coloring is a coloring that is both harmonious and complete. A graph &quot;G&quot; with &quot;n&quot; vertices and &quot;m&quot; edges has a harmonious &quot;k&quot;-coloring if and only if formula_2 and the graph formed from &quot;G&quot; by adding formula_3 isolated edges has an exact coloring. A graph &quot;G&quot; with the same parameters has a complete &quot;k&quot;-coloring if and only if formula_4 and there exists a subgraph &quot;H&quot; of &quot;G&quot; with an exact &quot;k&quot;-coloring in which each edge of &quot;G&quot; − &quot;H&quot; has endpoints of different colorings. The need for the condition on the edges of &quot;G&quot; − &quot;H&quot; is shown by the example of a four-vertex cycle, which has a subgraph with an exact 3-coloring (the three-edge path) but does not have a complete 3-coloring itself.

==Computational complexity==
It is NP-complete to determine whether a given graph has an exact coloring, even in the case that the graph is a tree. However, the problem may be solved in polynomial time for trees of bounded degree.

<text>Thabana Ntlenyana () is the highest mountain in southern Africa. It stands tall within the lofty Maloti Mountains that crest Lesotho. The peak&#x27;s name means &quot;beautiful little mountain&quot; in the Sesotho language, from &quot;thaba&quot; (mountain), the diminutive &quot;-na&quot;, and &quot;ntlenyana&quot; (beautiful).

== Geography ==

Thabana Ntlenyana is situated on the Mohlesi ridge, north of the treacherous Sani Pass. The peak is climbed as part of a &quot;Grand Traverse&quot; of the Maloti, which follows a large system of peaks within the Maloti (Maluti) and the broader Drakensberg. Thabana Ntlenyana, like the broader highlands around it, is made of amygdaloidal flood basalt that formed during the Upper Triassic and Lower Jurassic epochs. Nearby the mountain are the headwaters of the Orange River, which runs approximately to the west before draining into the Atlantic Ocean. Together with its main tributary, the Vaal River, the Orange River&#x27;s catchment spans around of land across Southern Africa.

== Ecology ==

The high-elevation treeless areas in the Drakensberg like Thabana Ntlenyana are categorized by the World Wide Fund for Nature as part of the &quot;Drakensberg alti-montane grasslands and woodlands&quot; ecoregion. This ecoregion is characterized by high elevation and high rainfall, but also by cooler temperatures than more equatorial montane areas. Rainfall comes in summer, often exceeding per year. Snowfall can occur in winter. Temperature varies from to , with an average of . 
Vegetation in the Maloti is known to vary with the surface geomorphic features beneath it, such as the soil&#x27;s grain size, carbon content, and depth. Flora communities are composed largely of tussock grasses and ericoid shrubs. Some of the most prevalent grass, sedge, and ericoid species are &quot;Merxmuellera disticha&quot;, &quot;M. drakensbergensis&quot;, &quot;Poa banana&quot;, &quot;Carex clavata&quot;, and &quot;Scirpus falsus&quot;.

The unique faunal communities of the Drakensberg grasslands have not yet been fully described by the scientific community. However, a 2001 study surveyed avian populations on Thabana Ntlenyana in particular. It found relatively low species diversity (23 spp.), with about a dozen living at the summit and more living in the peak&#x27;s foothills. The majority of breeding pairs recorded were insectivores, with the remaining mostly being granivores. The most dominant species across Thabana Ntlenyana was the Cape bunting (&quot;Emberiza capensis&quot;). At the summit, the African stonechat (&quot;Saxicola torquata&quot;), sickle-winged chat (&quot;Cercomela sinuata&quot;), and African pipit (&quot;Anthus cinnamomeus&quot;) dominated, while the lower foothills were home to more of the sentinel rock thrush (&quot;Monticola explorator&quot;), Drakensberg siskin (&quot;Pseudochlor. symonsi&quot;), and Drakensberg rockjumper (&quot;Chaetops aurant.&quot;).

== Access ==

The peak is often climbed from Sani Top Chalet or from Vergelegen Nature Reserve. The first recorded ascent by Western-tradition mountaineers was achieved in March 1951 by a South African-English team of leader Desmond Watkins, surveyors Barry Anderson and Roy Goodwin, mountaineer C. W. Jorgensen, and least three other assistants, described by Jorgensen only as &quot;cooks, bottlewashers and scarecrows.&quot;

<text>Pedro Arias de Ávila (c. 1440 – 6 March 1531; often Pedro Arias Dávila or Pedrarias Dávila) was a Spanish soldier and colonial administrator. He led the first great Spanish expedition to the mainland of the New World. There, he served as governor of Panama (1514–1526) and Nicaragua (1527–1531), and founded Panama City (1519). He died in 1531 aged around 90 or 91.

==Family==
Pedrarias was the son of Pedro Arias and María Ortiz de Cota. He was born into a prominent and well-connected Spanish family. His grandfather, Diego Arias de Ávila, was chief comptroller and a key adviser to King Enrique IV; his older brother was the Count of Puñonrostro; and his uncle was the Bishop of Segovia, a wealthy man who left Pedrarias a fortune.

==Early life==
As a boy, he was a &quot;page&quot; in the court of King Juan II of Castile. Physically imposing and athletic, he was nicknamed &quot;the jouster&quot; for his skill in tournaments and &quot;the gallant&quot; in reference to his extravagant wardrobe and spendthrift habits. In later life, he served in the war against the Moors in Granada (1482–1492) and distinguished himself as a colonel of infantry fighting in North Africa (1508–1511). When he returned to Spain, he received a promotion, a citation for valor, and another nickname: &quot;the lion of Bugia&quot;.

Towards the end of 1485, he married an intimate friend of queen Isabella I of Spain, Isabel de Bobadilla y Peñalosa, the daughter of Francisco de Bobadilla who was appointed to succeed Christopher Columbus as the second governor of the Indies in 1499.

A few years before 1513, he collapsed of some unrecorded illness. As he was about to be lowered to his grave, a tearful servant who was embracing the casket was astonished to hear movement inside. Incredibly, Arias was breathing and very much alive. Thereafter, he ordered an annual Requiem Mass sung for him in the cathedral at Torrejón, and stood in his own unused grave to listen to it. He took his coffin everywhere he went, even to the New World. 

In 1514, at the age of nearly seventy, he was made commander by King Ferdinand II of Aragon of the largest Spanish expedition (19 vessels and 1,500 men) hitherto sent to America.

==America==
They reached Santa Marta in Colombia in July 1514. They then proceeded to Darién, where Vasco Núñez de Balboa ruled as governor.

Arias Dávila superseded him and promised him his daughter in wedlock but he had Balboa judicially murdered at age 44 on 15 January 1519, being thus a potential bridegroom but never a son-in-law. Arias Dávila&#x27;s daughter was known as &quot;María de Peñalosa&quot; to honor her female ancestors, something by no means uncommon between the High Spanish Nobility at the time. In 1524, she married Rodrigo de Contreras, (Segovia, 1502 - 1558). They had 11 children. María died at Ciudad de los Reyes on 25 May 1573.

Another of Arias Dávila&#x27;s daughters, who was born when he was elderly, Isabel Arias or Isabel de Bobadilla (to mark the female ancestors of the family), was married in Valladolid, Spain, 1537, to his loyal lieutenant Hernando de Soto, the successful &quot;conquistador&quot; and explorer of Florida and Mississippi and Governor of Cuba.

In 1519, Arias Dávila founded Panama City and moved his capital there in 1524, abandoning Darién. Dávila sent Gil González Dávila to explore to the north. In 1524, he sent another expedition under Francisco Hernández de Córdoba, who was executed there in 1526 by order of Dávila, by then aged over 85.

María Ortiz Cota, the mother of Dávila, was the daughter of Toledo family member and Royal Treasurer Alonso Cota (died 1468) who was married to one Teresa Ortiz, their children being known however as &quot;Ortiz Cota&quot; under the Portuguese family style, whereas, following the Spanish succession style, they would have been known as &quot;Cota Ortiz&quot;. 

Moreover, he was a party to the original agreement with Francisco Pizarro and Diego de Almagro which brought about the discovery of Peru, but he withdrew (1526) for a small compensation, having lost confidence in the outcome. In the same year, he was superseded as Governor of Panama by Pedro de los Ríos and retired to León, Nicaragua, where he was named its new governor on 1 July 1527. Here he lived for the rest of his life until his death on 6 March 1531. He left an unenviable record, as a man of unreliable character, and who was cruel and unscrupulous. 

Through his foundation of Panama, however, he laid the basis for the discovery of South America&#x27;s west coast and the subsequent conquest of Peru.

<text>The differential analyser is a mechanical analogue computer designed to solve differential equations by integration, using wheel-and-disc mechanisms to perform the integration. It was one of the first advanced computing devices to be used operationally.
The original machines could not add, but then it was noticed that if the two wheels of a rear differential are turned, the drive shaft will compute the average of the left and right wheels. Addition and subtraction are then achieved by using a simple gear ratio of 1:2; the gear ratio provides multiplication by two, and multiplying the average of two values by two gives their sum. Multiplication is just a special case of integration, namely integrating a constant function.

==History==

Research on solutions for differential equations using mechanical devices, discounting planimeters, started at least as early as 1836, when the French physicist Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis designed a mechanical device to integrate differential equations of the first order.

The first description of a device which could integrate differential equations of any order was published in 1876 by James Thomson, who was born in Belfast in 1822, but lived in Scotland from the age of 10. Though Thomson called his device an &quot;integrating machine&quot;, it is his description of the device, together with the additional publication in 1876 of two further descriptions by his younger brother, Lord Kelvin, which represents the invention of the differential analyser.

One of the earliest practical uses of Thomson&#x27;s concepts was a tide-predicting machine built by Kelvin starting in 1872–3. On Lord Kelvin&#x27;s advice, Thomson&#x27;s integrating machine was later incorporated into a fire-control system for naval gunnery being developed by Arthur Pollen, resulting in an electrically driven, mechanical analogue computer, which was completed by about 1912. Italian mathematician Ernesto Pascal also developed integraphs for the mechanical integration of differential equations and published details in 1914.

However, the first widely practical general-purpose differential analyser was constructed by Harold Locke Hazen and Vannevar Bush at MIT, 1928–1931, comprising six mechanical integrators. In the same year, Bush described this machine in a journal article as a &quot;continuous integraph&quot;. When he published a further article on the device in 1931, he called it a &quot;differential analyzer&quot;. In this article, Bush stated that &quot;[the] present device incorporates the same basic idea of interconnection of integrating units as did [Lord Kelvin&#x27;s]. In detail, however, there is little resemblance to the earlier model.&quot; According to his 1970 autobiography, Bush was &quot;unaware of Kelvin’s work until after the first differential analyzer was operational.&quot; Claude Shannon was hired as a research assistant in 1936 to run the differential analyzer in Bush&#x27;s lab.

Douglas Hartree of Manchester University brought Bush&#x27;s design to England, where he constructed his first &quot;proof of concept&quot; model with his student, Arthur Porter, during 1934. As a result of this, the university acquired a full scale machine incorporating four mechanical integrators in March 1935, which was built by Metropolitan-Vickers, and was, according to Hartree, &quot;[the] first machine of its kind in operation outside the United States&quot;. During the next five years three more were added, at Cambridge University, Queen&#x27;s University Belfast, and the Royal Aircraft Establishment in Farnborough. One of the integrators from this proof of concept is on display in the History of Computing section of the Science Museum in London, alongside a complete Manchester machine.

In Norway, the locally built Oslo Analyser was finished during 1938, based on the same principles as the MIT machine. This machine had 12 integrators, and was the largest analyser built for a period of four years.

In the United States, further differential analysers were built at the Ballistic Research Laboratory in Maryland and in the basement of the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania during the early 1940s. The latter was used extensively in the computation of artillery firing tables prior to the invention of the ENIAC, which, in many ways, was modelled on the differential analyser. Also in the early 1940s, with Samuel H. Caldwell, one of the initial contributors during the early 1930s, Bush attempted an electrical, rather than mechanical, variation, but the digital computer built elsewhere had much greater promise and the project ceased. In 1947, UCLA installed a differential analyser built for them by General Electric at a cost of $125,000. By 1950, this machine had been joined by three more. The UCLA differential analyzer appeared in 1950&#x27;s &quot;Destination Moon&quot;, and the same footage in 1951&#x27;s &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot;, where it was called &quot;DA&quot;. A different shot appears in 1956&#x27;s &quot;Earth vs. the Flying Saucers&quot;.
At Osaka Imperial University (present-day Osaka University) around 1944, 
a complete differential analyser machine was developed (illustrated) to calculate the movement of an object and other problems with mechanical components, and then draws graphs on paper with a pen. It was later transferred to the Tokyo University of Science and has been displayed at the school&#x27;s Museum of Science in Shinjuku Ward. Restored in 2014, it is one of only two still operational differential analyzers produced before the end of World War II.

In Canada, a differential analyser was constructed at the University of Toronto in 1948 by Beatrice Helen Worsley, but it appears to have had little or no use.

A differential analyser may have been used in the development of the bouncing bomb, used to attack German hydroelectric dams during World War II. Differential analysers have also been used in the calculation of soil erosion by river control authorities.

The differential analyser was eventually rendered obsolete by electronic analogue computers and, later, digital computers.

==Use of Meccano==

The model differential analyser built at Manchester University in 1934 by Douglas Hartree and Arthur Porter made extensive use of Meccano parts: this meant that the machine was less costly to build, and it proved &quot;accurate enough for the solution of many scientific problems&quot;. A similar machine built by J.B. Bratt at Cambridge University in 1935 is now in the Museum of Transport and Technology (MOTAT) collection in Auckland, New Zealand. A memorandum written for the British military&#x27;s Armament Research Department in 1944 describes how this machine had been modified during World War II for improved reliability and enhanced capability, and identifies its wartime applications as including research on the flow of heat, explosive detonations, and simulations of transmission lines.

It has been estimated, by Garry Tee that &quot;about 15 Meccano model Differential Analysers were built for serious work by scientists and researchers around the world&quot;.

<text>Champagne Castle is a mountain in the central Drakensberg range, and is the second highest peak in South Africa. It contains a series of subsidiary peaks, amongst them, Cathkin Peak (3149 m), Sterkhorn (previously called Mount Memory), Monk&#x27;s Cowl and Dragon&#x27;s Back.

It is said that when two intrepid mountaineers, David Gray and Major Grantham, climbed the peaks directly in front of Cathkin, they were about to celebrate their long haul by popping a bottle of champagne. But as fate would have it, the guide dropped the bottle on a rock – and in that moment Champagne Castle in the heart of the Drakensberg was christened.

Cathkin Peak was named after the residence of a Lanarkshire immigrant, Stephan Snyman, who named his home after Cathkin Braes, a hill in Glasgow.
As is the common trend in the Drakensberg, surrounding hotels and resorts have been named after Champagne Castle, Monk&#x27;s Cowl and Cathkin Peak.

<text>The Sultanate of Sulu (; ; ) is a Sunni Muslim monarchy and state in the Philippines that includes the Sulu Archipelago, coastal areas of Zamboanga City and certain portions of Palawan in the today&#x27;s Philippines, alongside parts of present-day Sabah and North Kalimantan in north-eastern Borneo.
The sultanate was founded either on 17 November 1405 or 1457 by Johore-born explorer and Sunni religious scholar Sharif ul-Hashim. &quot;Paduka Mahasari Maulana al Sultan Sharif ul-Hashim&quot; became his full regnal name; &quot;Sharif-ul Hashim&quot; is his abbreviated name. He settled in Buansa, Sulu. The sultanate gained its independence from the Bruneian Empire in 1578.

At its peak, it stretched over the islands that bordered the western peninsula of Zamboanga in Mindanao in the east to Palawan in the north. It also covered areas in the northeast of Borneo, stretching from Marudu Bay, Sabah to Tepian, Sembakung subdistrict, North Kalimantan. Another source stated the area included stretched from Kimanis Bay, which also overlaps with the boundaries of the Bruneian Sultanate. Following the arrival of western powers such as the Spanish, the British, the Dutch, French, Germans, the Sultan thalassocracy and sovereign political powers were relinquished by 1915 through an agreement that was signed with the United States. In 1974, the Filipino government officially recognised the historical territories of the Sultanate and the head of the royal house as the Sultan of Sulu.

In Kakawin Nagarakretagama, the Sultanate of Sulu is referred to as Solot, one of the countries in the Tanjungnagara archipelago (Kalimantan-Philippines), which is one of the areas that is under the influence of the mandala area of the Majapahit kingdom in the archipelago.

==History==

===Pre-establishment===

The present area of the Sultanate of Sulu was once under the influence of the Bruneian Empire before it gained its own independence in 1578. During the 13th century the people of Sulu began migrating to present-day Zamboanga and Sulu archipelago from their homelands in northeastern Mindanao. Scott (1994) writes that the Sulu are the descendants of ancient Butuanons and Surigaonons from the Rajahnate of Butuan, which was then Hindu, like pre-islamic Sulu. They moved south and established a spice trading port in Sulu. Sultan Batarah Shah Tengah, who ruled as sultan in 1600, was said to be an actual native of Butuan. The Butuanon-Surigaonon origins of the Tausugs are suggested by the relationship of their languages, as the Butuanon, Surigaonon and Tausug languages are all members of the Southern sub-family of Visayan. Later, the earliest known settlement in this area soon to be occupied by the sultanate was in Maimbung, Jolo. During this time, Sulu was called Lupah Sug. The principality of Maimbung, populated by Buranun people (or &quot;Budanon&quot;, literally means &quot;mountain-dwellers&quot;), was first ruled by a certain rajah who assumed the title Rajah Sipad the Older. According to Majul, the origins of the title &quot;rajah sipad&quot; originated from the Hindu sri pada, which symbolises authority. The principality was instituted and governed using the system of rajahs. Sipad the Older was succeeded by Sipad the Younger.

Some Chams who migrated to Sulu were called Orang Dampuan. The Champa civilization and the port-kingdom of Sulu engaged in commerce with each other which resulted in merchant Chams settling in Sulu, where they were known as Orang Dampuan in the 10th–13th centuries. In contrast to their cousins in the Butuan Rajahnate, who considered themselves diplomatic competitors of Champa for China trade, (under Butuan&#x27;s Rajah Kiling); instead, Sulu freely traded with the Champa civilization. The Orang Dampuans from Champa however were eventually slaughtered by envious native Sulu Buranuns due to the wealth of the Orang Dampuan. The Buranun were then subjected to retaliatory slaughter by the Orang Dampuan. Harmonious commerce between Sulu and the Orang Dampuan was later restored. The Yakans were descendants of the Taguima-based Orang Dampuan who came to Sulu from Champa. Sulu received civilization in its Indic form from the Orang Dampuan.

During the reign of Sipad the Younger, a Sunni Sufi scholar and mystic named &quot;Tuan&quot; Mashā′ikha arrived in Jolo in 1280 CE. Little is known to the origins and early biography of Tuan Mashā′ikha, except that he is a Muslim &quot;who came from foreign lands&quot; at the head of a fleet of Muslim traders, or he was issued from a stalk of bamboo and was considered a prophet, thus well respected by the people. Other reports, however, insisted that Tuan Mashā′ikha together with his parents, Jamiyun Kulisa and Indra Suga, were sent to Sulu by Alexander the Great (who is known as &quot;Iskandar Zulkarnain&quot; in Malay Annals). However, Najeeb Mitry Saleeby, a Lebanese American doctor who wrote &quot;A History of Sulu&quot; in 1908 and other studies of the Moros, dismisses this claim by concluding that Jamiyun Kulisa and Indra Suga were mythical names. According to &quot;tarsila&quot;, during the coming of Tuan Mashā′ikha, the people of Maimbung worshipped tombs and stones of any kind. After he preached Islam in the area, he married Sipad the Younger&#x27;s daughter, Idda Indira Suga, who bore three children: Tuan Hakim, Tuan Pam and &#x27;Aisha. Tuan Hakim, in turn, begot five children. From the genealogy of Tuan Mashā′ikha, another titular system of aristocracy called &quot;tuanship&quot; started in Sulu. Apart from the Idda Indira Suga, Tuan Mashā′ikha also married another &quot;unidentified woman&quot; and begot Moumin. Tuan Mashā′ikha died in 710 A.H. (equivalent to 1310 AD), and was buried in Bud Dato near Jolo, with an inscription of &quot;Tuan Maqbālū&quot;.

A descendant of the Sunni Sufi Shaykh Tuan Mashā′ikha named Tuan May also begot a son named &quot;Datu&quot; Tka. The descendants of Tuan May did not assume the title of &quot;tuan&quot;, but instead, used &quot;datu&quot;. This was the first time &quot;datu&quot; was used as a political institution. During the coming of Tuan Mashā′ikha, the Tagimaha people (literally means &quot;the party of the people&quot;) from Basilan and several places in Mindanao, also arrived and settled in Buansa. After the Tagimaha came the Baklaya people, (which means &quot;seashore dwellers&quot;), who are believed to have originated from Sulawesi, and settled in Patikul. After these came the Bajau people (or &quot;Samal&quot;) from Johor. The Bajau were driven towards Sulu by a heavy monsoon, some of them to the shores of Brunei and others to Mindanao. The population of Buranun, Tagimaha, and Baklaya in Sulu created three parties with distinct systems of government and subjects. In the 1300s the Chinese annals, &quot;Nanhai zhi&quot;, reported that Brunei invaded or administered the Philippine kingdoms of Butuan, Sulu and Ma-i (Mindoro), which did not regain their independence 
until later date. According to the Nagarakretagama, the Majapahit Empire under Emperor Hayam Wuruk invaded Sulu in 1365. However in 1369, the Sulus rebelled and regained independence and in vengeance assaulted the Majapahit Empire and its province &quot;Po-ni&quot; (Brunei), as well as the northeast coast of Borneo and thereafter went to the capital, looting it of treasure and gold. In the sacking of Brunei, the Sulus stole two sacred pearls from the Bruneian king. A fleet from the Majapahit capital succeeded in driving away the Sulus, but &quot;Po-ni&quot; was left weaker after the attack. Since Chinese historiographies later recorded there to be a Maharaja of Sulu, it is assumed that the Majapahit did not take it back, and it was a rival to it. By 1390 CE, Rajah Baguinda Ali, a prince of the Pagaruyung Kingdom, arrived at Sulu and married into the local nobility. At least in 1417, when Sulu rivaled Majapahit according to Chinese annals, three kings (or monarchs) ruled three civilised kingdoms in the island. Patuka Pahala (Paduka Batara) ruled the eastern kingdom (Sulu Archipelago) -- he was the most powerful; the western kingdom was ruled by Mahalachi (Maharajah Kamal ud-Din), ruler of Kalimantan in Indonesia; and the kingdom near the cave (or Cave King) was Paduka Patulapok from Palawan Island. The Bajau settlers were distributed among the three kingdoms. During this time, Sulu avenged itself for Majapahit Imperialism by encroaching upon the Majapahit Empire as the alliance of the three Sulu kings had territory that reached East and North Kalimantan, which were former Majapahit provinces.

Moumin&#x27;s descendants the son of Tuan Mashā′ikha populated Sulu. After some time, a certain Timway Orangkaya Su&#x27;il was mentioned by the second page of tarsila; he received four Bisaya slaves (people from the Kedatuan of Madja-as) from Manila (presumably Kingdom of Maynila) as a sign of friendship between the two countries. The descendants of Su&#x27;il also inherited the title Timway, which means &quot;chief&quot;. On tarsila&#x27;s third page, it accounts the fact that the slaves were the ancestors of the inhabitants in the island to Parang, Lati, Gi&#x27;tung, and Lu&#x27;uk respectively.

The fourth page then narrates the coming of the Buranun (addressed in the &quot;tarsila&quot; as &quot;the Maimbung people&quot;), Tagimaha, Baklaya, and finally the drifted Bajau immigrants from Johor. The condition of Sulu before the arrival of Islam can be summarised as such: The island was inhabited by several cultures, and was reigned over by three independent kingdoms ruled by the Buranun, Tagimaha, and Baklaya peoples. Likewise, the socio-political systems of these kingdoms were characterised by several distinct institutions: rajahship, datuship, tuanship and timwayship. The arrival of Tuan Mashā′ikha afterwards established a core Islamic community in the island.

===Islamisation and establishment===
The Sulu Archipelago was an entrepôt that attracted merchants from south China and various parts of Southeast Asia beginning in the 14th century. The name &quot;Sulu&quot; is attested in Chinese historical records as early as 1349, during the late Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), suggesting trade relations around this time. Trade continued into the early Ming dynasty (1368–1644); envoys were sent in several missions to China to trade and pay tribute to the emperor. Sulu merchants often exchanged goods with Chinese Muslims, and also traded with Muslims of Arab, Persian, Malay, or Indian descent. Islamic historian Cesar Adib Majul argues that Islam was introduced to the Sulu Archipelago in the late 14th century by Chinese and Arab merchants and missionaries from Ming China. The seven Arab missionaries were called &quot;Lumpang Basih&quot; by the Tausug, and were Sunni Sufi scholars from the Ba &#x27;Alawi sada of Yemen.

Around this time, a notable Arab judge, Sunni Sufi and religious scholar Karim ul-Makhdum from Mecca arrived in Malacca. He preached Islam, particularly the Ash&#x27;ari Aqeeda and Shafi&#x27;i Madh&#x27;hab as well as the Qadiriyya Tariqa, and many citizens, including the ruler of Malacca, converted to Islam. Sulu leader Paduka Pahala and his sons moved to China, where he died. Chinese Muslims brought up his sons in Dezhou, where their descendants live and have the surnames An and Wen. In 1380 CE, Karim ul-Makhdum arrived in Simunul island from Malacca, again with Arab traders. Apart from being a scholar, he operated as a trader; some see him as a Sufi missionary from Mecca. He preached Islam, and was accepted by the core Muslim community. He was the second person to preach Islam in the area, after Tuan Mashā′ikha. To facilitate conversion of nonbelievers, he established a mosque in Tubig-Indagan, Simunul, the first Islamic temple to be constructed in the area, or in the Philippines. This later became known as the Sheik Karimal Makdum Mosque. He died in Sulu, although the exact location of his grave is unknown. In Buansa, he was known as Tuan Sharif Awliyā. On his alleged grave in Bud Agad, Jolo, an inscription reads &quot;Mohadum Aminullah Al-Nikad&quot;. In Lugus, he is referred to as Abdurrahman. In Sibutu, he is known by his name. The differing beliefs about his grave&#x27;s location came about because the Qadiri Shaykh Karim ul-Makhdum travelled to several islands in the Sulu Sea to preach Islam. In many places in the archipelago, he was beloved. It is said that the people of Tapul built a mosque honouring him and that they claim descent from Karim ul-Makhdum. The customs, beliefs and political laws of the people changed and adapted to adopt the Islamic tradition.

Sulu abruptly stopped sending tributes to the Ming in 1424. Antonio Pigafetta recorded in his journals that the sultan of Brunei invaded Sulu to retrieve the two sacred pearls Sulu had previously pillaged from Brunei. A sultan of Brunei, Sultan Bolkiah married a princess (&quot;dayang-dayang&quot;) of Sulu, Puteri Laila Menchanai, and they became the grandparents of the Muslim prince of Maynila, Rajah Matanda. Manila was a Muslim city-state and vassal to Brunei before the Spanish colonized it and converted it from Islam to Christianity. Islamic Manila ended after the failed attack of Tarik Sulayman, a Muslim Kapampangan commander, in the failure of the Conspiracy of the Maharlikas, when the formerly Muslim Manila nobility attempted a secret alliance with the Japanese shogunate and Bruneiean sultanate (together with her Manila and Sulu allies) to expel the Spaniards from the Philippines. Many Tausugs and other native Muslims of Sulu Sultanate already interacted with Kapampangan and Tagalog Muslims called Luzones based in Brunei, and there were intermarriages between them. The Spanish had native allies against the former Muslims they conquered like Hindu Tondo which resisted Islam when Brunei invaded and established Manila as a Muslim city-state to supplant Hindu Tondo.

===Maritime power===
The Sulu sultanate became notorious for its so-called &quot;Moro Raids&quot; or acts of piracy on Spanish settlements in the Visayan areas with the aim of capturing slaves and other goods from these coastal towns. Tausug pirates used boats known collectively by Europeans as &quot;proas&quot; (predominantly the &quot;lanong&quot; and &quot;garay&quot; warships), which varied in design and were much lighter than the Spanish galleons and could easily out-sail these ships, and also often carried large swivel guns or &quot;lantaka&quot; and also carried a crew of pirates from different ethnic groups throughout Sulu, such as the Iranun, Bajaus and Tausugs alike. By the 18th century, Sulu pirates had become virtual masters of the Sulu seas and the surrounding areas, wreaking havoc on Spanish settlements. This prompted the Spaniards to build a number of fortifications across the Visayan islands of Cebu and Bohol; churches were built on higher ground, and watchtowers were built along coastlines to warn of impending raids.

The maritime supremacy of Sulu was not directly controlled by the sultan; independent &quot;datu&quot;s and warlords waged their own wars against the Spaniards and even with the capture of Jolo on numerous occasions by the Spaniards, other settlements like Maimbung, Banguingui and Tawi-Tawi were used as assembly areas and hideouts for pirates.

The sultanate&#x27;s control over the Sulu seas was at its height around the late 17th to early 18th centuries when Moro raids became very common for the Visayans and Spaniards.

In Sulu and in the Mindanao interior, the slave trade flourished and majority of the slaves that were being imported and exported were of Visayan ethnicity; the term &quot;Bisaya&quot; eventually became synonymous to &quot;slave&quot; in these areas. Its maritime supremacy over the Spaniards, at the time, the Spaniards acquired steam-powered ships that began to curb Muslim piracy in the region, the Moro piratical raids began to decrease in number until Governor Narciso Clavería launched the Balanguingui expedition in 1848 to crush the pirate settlements there, effectively ending the Moro pirate raids. By the last quarter of the 19th century, Moro pirates had virtually disappeared and the maritime influence of the sultanate became dependent on the Chinese junk trade.

=== Conquest of Northeastern Borneo ===

In 1746, Sultan Azim ud-Din I, with Spanish assistance, carried out punitive expeditions around the Sebuku region against the Tidungs to reconsolidate his power in Borneo. By April 1747, the expeditions were declared a success and the chief of Tarakan declared his allegiance to Sulu. After the Sultan returned to Sulu, he brought back 50 captives who were previously under the hands of the Tidung and among them was a friar, while others were Tidung chiefs. Two of the Tidung chiefs were left in Jolo while the rest were brought to Zamboanga. Tausug traders began settling in Tarakan. However, things began to complicate after the Tidungs made a political marriage with Bulungan, placing the Tidungs also under the Sultanate of Bulungan.

In 1789, amidst the civil war in Berau, Sultan Azim ud-Din II raided Berau and Tarakan, which led to the de facto independence of Bulungan from Berau by the 18th-19th century. Sulu became the dominant power in the region and Bulungan was placed under the sphere of influence of the former. Tausug vessels began arriving in the region at a large scale to conduct trade. The status of Bulungan as a subject of Sulu however would later change after they stopped paying tribute to Sulu in 1855. This would later become official after the British annexation of North Borneo and the Dutch annexation of Bulungan in 1878.

===Spanish and British annexations===

In the 18th century, Sulu&#x27;s dominion covered most of northeastern part of Borneo. However areas like Tempasuk and Abai had never really shown much allegiance to its earlier ruler, Brunei, subsequently similar treatment was given to Sulu. Alexander Dalrymple, who made a treaty of allegiance in 1761 with Sulu, had to make a similar agreement with the rulers of Tempasuk and Abai on the north Borneo coast in 1762. The Sultanate of Sulu totally gave up its domain over Palawan to Spain in 1705 and Basilan to Spain in 1762. The territory ceded to Sulu by Brunei initially stretched south to Tapean Durian (now Tanjong Mangkalihat) (another source mentioned a southernmost boundary at Dumaring), near the Straits of Macassar (now Kalimantan). From 1726 to 1733, the Sulu sultanate restarted their tributary relationship with China, now the Qing Empire, about 300 years after it had ended.

By 1849, the areas gained from Brunei had been effectively controlled by the Sultanate of Bulungan in Kalimantan, reducing the boundary of Sulu to a cape named Batu Tinagat and the Tawau River.

In 1848 and 1851, the Spanish launched attacks on Balanguingui and Jolo respectively. A peace treaty was signed on 30 April 1851 in which the sultan could only regain the capital if Sulu and its dependencies became a part of the Philippine Islands under the sovereignty of Spain. There were different understandings of this treaty; although the Spanish interpreted it as the sultan accepting Spanish sovereignty over Sulu and Tawi-Tawi, but the sultan took it as a friendly treaty amongst equals. These areas were only partially controlled by the Spanish, and their power was limited to military stations and garrisons and pockets of civilian settlements. This lasted until they had to abandon the region as a consequence of their defeat in the Spanish–American War. On 22 January 1878, an agreement was signed between the Sultanate of Sulu and British commercial syndicate of (Alfred Dent and Baron de Overbeck), which stipulated that North Borneo was either ceded or leased (depending on translation used) to the British in return for payment of five thousand Malayan dollars per year.

On 22 April 1903, Sultan Jamalul Kiram II signed a document known as &quot;Confirmation of cession of certain islands&quot;, in which he granted and ceded additional islands in the neighbourhood of the mainland of North Borneo from Banggi Island to Sibuku Bay to the British North Borneo Company. The confirmatory deed of 1903 makes it known and understood between the two parties that the islands mentioned were included in the cession of the districts and islands mentioned on 22 January 1878 agreement. Additional cession money was set at 300 dollars a year with arrears due for past occupation of 3,200 dollars. The originally agreed 5,000 dollars increased to 5,300 dollars per year payable annually.

===Madrid Protocol===

The Sulu sultanate later came under the control of Spain in Manila. In 1885, Great Britain, Germany, and Spain signed the Madrid Protocol to cement Spanish influence over the islands of the Philippines. In the same agreement, Spain relinquished all claim to North Borneo which had belonged to the sultanate in the past to the British government.
===Decline===

The sultanate&#x27;s political power was relinquished in March 1915 after American commanders negotiated with Sultan Jamalul Kiram II on behalf of Governor-General Francis Burton Harrison. An agreement was subsequently signed, called the &quot;Carpenter Agreement&quot;. By this agreement, the sultan relinquished all political power over territory within the Philippines (except for certain specific land granted to Sultan Jamalul Kiram II and his heirs), with the religious authority as head of Islam in Sulu.

==Legacy==
===Status within the Philippines===
In 1962, the Philippine government under the administration of President Diosdado Macapagal officially recognised the continued existence of the Sultanate of Sulu. It has been asserted that Macapagal was a cousin of the Sulu sultan due to his royal descent tracing to Lakandula of Tondo, Lakandula was the uncle of the Muslim king of Manila, Rajah Sulayman, and they had a grandmother from Sulu in the person of the Tausug princess, Laila Mechanai, wife of Sultan Bolkiah of Brunei and ancestor of Rajah Matanda and Rajah Sulayman of Manila. On 24 May 1974, the reign of Sultan Mohammed Mahakuttah Kiram began and lasted until 1986. He was the last officially recognized Sulu sultan in the Philippines, having been recognized by President Ferdinand Marcos.

====Pretenders====
After the death of Mahakuttah A. Kiram, the Philippine national government did not formally recognised a new sultan. Mahakutta&#x27;s crown prince Muedzul Lail Kiram, the heir to the throne according to the line of succession as recognised by the Philippine governments from 1915 to 1986, was 20 years old upon his father&#x27;s death. Due to his young age, he failed to claim the throne in a time of political instability in the Philippines that led to the peaceful revolution and subsequent removal of President Marcos. The gap in the sultanate leadership was filled by claimants of rival branches. Therefore, the succeeding claimants to the Sultanship were not crowned with the support of the Philippine government nor received formal recognition from the national government as their predecessors had until 1974, when Muedzul Lail Tan Kiram was formally recognised as the legitimate successor as the 35th sultan of Sulu by Memorandum Order 427, signed by Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos. 
The then-Acting Secretary of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of the Philippines officially further recognized the sovereignty of the Sultanate of Sulu over North Borneo (now Sabah), clarifying that &quot;for the last two hundred years or more the title of sovereignty and dominion over the Territory of North Borneo has been vested in the Sultanate of Sulu.&quot;

===North Borneo dispute===
The dispute is based on a territorial claim by the Philippines since the era of President Diosdado Macapagal over much of the eastern part of Sabah in Malaysia. Sabah was known as North Borneo prior to the formation of the Malaysian federation in 1963. The Eastern Sabah territory was allegedly gifted by the Brunei Sultanate to the Sulu Sultanate due to Sulu intervention in the Brunei Civil War. However Brunei historian Leigh R. Wright has claimed that Sulu never really provided assistance during the civil war. The Philippines, via the heritage of the Sultanate of Sulu, claim Sabah on the basis that Sabah was only leased to the British North Borneo Company with the sultanate&#x27;s sovereignty never being relinquished. The dispute stems from the difference in the interpretation used on an agreement signed between Sultanate of Sulu and the British commercial syndicate (Alfred Dent and Baron von Overbeck) in 1878, which stipulated that North Borneo was either ceded or leased (depending on translation used) to the British chartered company in return for payment of 5,000 dollars per year. Malaysia views the dispute as a &quot;non-issue&quot;, as it not only considers the agreement in 1878 as one of cession, but it also deems that the residents had exercised their act of self-determination when they joined to form the Malaysian federation in 1963. As reported by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the independence of North Borneo was brought about as the result of the expressed wish of the majority of the people of the territory as supported by the findings of the Cobbold Commission.

Moreover, a later 1903 Confirmation of Cession agreement between the sultan of Sulu and the British government, has provided reaffirmation regarding the understanding of the sultan of Sulu on the treaty in 1878, i.e. it is of the form of a cession. Throughout the British administration of North Borneo, the British government continued to make the annual &quot;cession money&quot; payment to the sultan and its heir and these payments were expressly shown in the receipts as &quot;cession money&quot;. In a 1961 conference in London, a Philippine and British panel met to discuss the Philippine claim to North Borneo, the British informed the Congressman Salonga that the wording of the receipts had not been challenged by the sultan or his heirs. During a meeting of Maphilindo between the Philippine, Malayan and Indonesian governments in 1963, the Philippine government said the sultan of Sulu wanted the payment of 5,000 from the Malaysian government. The first Malaysian Prime Minister at the time, Tunku Abdul Rahman said he would go back to Kuala Lumpur and get on the request. Since then, the Malaysian Embassy in the Philippines issues a cheque in the amount of RM5,300 (approx. ₱77,000 or US$1,710) to the legal counsel of the heirs of the sultan of Sulu. Malaysia considers the settlement an annual &quot;cession payment&quot; for the disputed state, while the sultan&#x27;s descendants consider it &quot;rent&quot;. These payments however have been stopped as of 2013 in light of the attempted invasion of Sabah since Malaysia viewed that as an act of violation of the 1903 Confirmation of Cession agreement and its earlier 1878 agreement.

Republic Act 5446 in the Philippines, which took effect on 18 September 1968, regards Sabah as a territory &quot;over which the Republic of the Philippines has acquired dominion and sovereignty&quot;. On 16 July 2011, the Supreme Court of the Philippines ruled that the Philippine claim over Sabah is retained and may be pursued in the future. , Malaysia maintains that their Sabah claim is a non-issue and non-negotiable, thereby rejecting any calls from the Philippines to resolve the matter in the International Court of Justice. Sabah authorities sees the claim made by the Philippines&#x27; Moro leader Nur Misuari to take Sabah to International Court of Justice as a non-issue and thus dismissed the claim.

In February 2022, an international court ruled that Malaysia had violated a treaty signed in 1878 of annual cession payment and would have to pay at least US$14.92 billion (RM62.59 billion) to the descendants of the Sulu sultan, which Malaysia ceased payment in 2013 as it deemed that the Sulu counterpart had first violated the treaty through the 2013 Sabah incursion. The award was reportedly issued in an arbitration court in Paris, France by Spanish arbitrator Gonzalo Stampa. In March 2022, Malaysia filed an application to annul the final award over claims by Sulu sultan’s heirs since the appointment of Stampa had itself been annulled by Madrid High Court in June 2021, rendering any decisions by him to be invalid including the 2022 award. Lawyers for the heirs indicated that they will seek the award’s recognition and execution, citing a 1958 U.N. Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards. In July 2022, court bailiffs in Luxembourg served Petronas Azerbaijan (Shah Denis) and Petronas South Caucus with a &quot;saiseie-arret,&quot; or a size order or behalf of descendants of the Sulu sultan. Petronas said it would defend its legal position.

In June 2023, the Paris Court of Appeal ruled in favour of the Malaysian Government&#x27;s appeal against the French arbitration court&#x27;s 2022 decision to award US$15 billion to the claimants to the Sultanate of Sulu. The Court of Appeal also ruled that Stampa and the arbitration tribunal did not have jurisdiction over the case. In addition, the Court of Appeal annulled the US$15.9 billion award. The decision was welcomed by Malaysian law minister Datuk Seri Azalina Othman. Stampa also faces legal proceedings in Spain for ignoring the decisions of earlier Spanish courts. However, Stampa&#x27;s award remains enforceable outside of France due to a United Nations treaty on international arbitration. The Sulu claimants have also filed claims to seize Malaysian assets in the Netherlands and Luxembourg.

On 27 June 2023, a Dutch court of appeal dismissed a bid by the claimants to the Sultanate to enforce the US$15 billion arbitration award against the Malaysian Government. While the Malaysian Government welcomed the court&#x27;s ruling, the Sulu heirs&#x27; lawyer Paul Cohen expressed disappointment. On 9 November 2023, the Paris Court of Appeal dismissed legal attempts by the Sultanate&#x27;s claimants to seize Malaysian diplomatic properties in Paris. On 10 November, the Madrid Court filed criminal charges against Stampa over his role in handing the US$14.92 billion arbitration award to the eight Sulu claimants. On 5 January 2024, Stampa was convicted for contempt of court. He was sentenced to six months in prison and banned from acting as an arbitrator for one year for “knowingly disobeying rulings and orders from the Madrid High Court of Justice”. According to Law360, the Spanish courts’ decision to move ahead with criminal proceedings against Stampa marked a significant “victory for the Malaysian government”.

On May 17, 2024 the Madrid Court of Appeal upheld the contempt of court conviction and sentence against Stampa, upholding his six-month prison sentence, and a one-year ban from practicing as an arbitrator.

The Madrid Court highlighted that the arbitrator&#x27;s appointment was a judicial decision made before the arbitration process. Consequently, once the nullification of the appointment was confirmed, all subsequent arbitral proceedings stemming from that appointment were rendered invalid, as if they had never occurred.

Malaysian Minister Azalina Othman said, “In its judgment, the Madrid Court of Appeal confirms that Stampa knowingly and wilfully disobeyed the clear rulings and orders of the Madrid High Court of Justice resulting from the nullification of his appointment as arbitrator.”

Later on May 30, 2024, Malaysian state-owned petroleum firm Petronas moved a Manhattan court to seek directions for litigation funding firm Therium and its parent company to turn over subpoenaed financial documents and communications.

Petronas’ Azerbaijani arm said it would sue the companies and their lawyers in Spain over losses from the seizure of assets in Luxembourg.

Former Spanish Judge Josep Galvez – barrister at 4–5 Gray&#x27;s Inn Square Chambers, which the lawyers of Sulu claimants Paul Cohen and Elisabeth Mason also associate with – said the Madrid Court’s ruling underscored the importance of rigorous compliance with procedural requirements and judicial orders under Spanish law, as failure to do so could invite severe penalties. “The conviction of Stampa serves as a lesson for international arbitration practitioners, emphasizing the paramount importance of adhering to judicial orders in Spain,” he wrote.

On 6 September 2024, the Dutch Supreme Court rejected an appeal by the Sulus to enforce the US$15 billion arbitration award against Malaysia. The ruling came as a continuation of previous decisions in Malaysia’s favor, such as those by the Hague Court of Appeal upholding Malaysia’s challenge against the award, and the Paris Court of Appeal annulling an attempt by the Sulu group to mortgage a Malaysian diplomatic building in Paris.

On 3 October 2024, Malaysia&#x27;s Federal Court upheld the death sentences of seven Filipino men involved in the 2013 Lahad Datu invasion, which had resulted in the deaths of nine Malaysian security personnel. The ruling was seen as a step toward ensuring justice and strengthening national security in Malaysia. 

On November 7, 2024, the French Court of Cassationthe highest court in the French judicial systemannulled a $15 billion arbitration ruling against Malaysia. This decision marked a significant legal victory for Malaysia and reinforced its sovereignty in a dispute with the self-proclaimed Sulu heirs. The ruling highlighted irregularities in the arbitration process led by Gonzalo Stampa and raised concerns about practices such as forum shopping and unregulated litigation funding in European courts. 

The French court’s decision was deemed a significant “win” for Malaysia that effectively marked the end of the Sulu case by several publications, including Law.com and Law360.  Keith Ellison, former vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee and Minnesota attorney general, pointed out that the case highlighted the enormous scope for “corruption,” irresponsible profiteering, and foreign influence operations to subvert arbitration proceedings”.

Following Malaysia&#x27;s legal victory in the French Court, Paul Cohen argued that the ruling allows the Sulu heirs to lease Sabah to other nations, such as China and the Philippines. Cohen also suggested that accepting the French court&#x27;s decision implies recognition of the Sulu Sultanate descendants&#x27; sovereignty over Sabah, which Malaysia disputes. In response, Datuk Seri Azalina Othman Said dismissed Cohen&#x27;s statements as baseless and reaffirmed Sabah’s status as part of Malaysia, citing historical and legal foundations such as the Cobbold Commission and the 1963 referendum.

In early November 2024, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. signed the &quot;Philippine Maritime Zones Act&quot; and the &quot;Philippine Archipelagic Sea Lanes Act&quot;. These laws reaffirmed the Philippines&#x27; maritime territories and rights to natural resources across the South China Sea, including Sabah, drawing strong criticism from Malaysia. On November 15, 2024, Kuala Lumpur lodged a diplomatic protest against the two maritime laws, arguing that they infringed upon Malaysia&#x27;s territorial boundaries in the South China Sea. 

===Other===
Outside the North Borneo dispute, the heirs and claimants of the Sulu sultanate have been involved in contemporary Philippine politics such as the lobbying for the creation of a constituent state called Zambasulta within the Philippines under a federal form of government.

==Economy==

===Weapons and slave trade===

Chinese who lived in Sulu ran guns across a Spanish blockade to supply the Moro datus and sultanates with weapons to fight the Spanish, who were engaging in a campaign to subjugate the Moro sultanates on Mindanao. A trade involving the Moros selling slaves and other goods in exchange for guns developed. The Chinese had entered the economy of the sultanate, taking almost total control of the sultanate&#x27;s economies in Mindanao and dominating the markets. Though the sultans did not like one group of people exercising exclusive control over the economy, they did business with them.

The Chinese set up a trading network between Singapore, Zamboanga, Jolo and Sulu. The Chinese sold small arms like Enfield and Spencer Rifles to the Buayan Datu Uto. They were used to battle the Spanish invasion of Buayan. The datu paid for the weapons in slaves. The population of Chinese in Mindanao in the 1880s was 1,000. The Chinese ran guns across a Spanish blockade to sell to Mindanao Moros. The purchases of these weapons were paid for by the Moros in slaves in addition to other goods. The main group of people selling guns were the Chinese in Sulu. The Chinese took control of the economy and used steamers to ship goods for exporting and importing. Opium, ivory, textiles, and crockery were among the other goods which the Chinese sold.

The Chinese on Maimbung sent the weapons to the Sulu sultanate, who used them to battle the Spanish and resist their attacks. A Chinese-Mestizo was one of the sultan&#x27;s brothers-in-law, the sultan was married to his sister. He and the sultan both owned shares in the ship (named the Far East) which helped smuggle the weapons. The Spanish launched a surprise offensive under Colonel Juan Arolas in April 1887 by attacking the sultanate&#x27;s capital at Maimbung in an effort to crush resistance. Weapons were captured and the property of the Chinese were destroyed while the Chinese were deported to Jolo.

===Pearling industry===

After the destruction of the pirate haunts of Balanguingui effectively ending the centuries of slave raids, which the Sulu sultanate&#x27;s economy had so depended on, along with the economy of mainland Mindanao, the sultanate&#x27;s economy experienced a sharp decline as slaves became more inaccessible and the islands&#x27; agricultural produce wasn&#x27;t enough, thus it became dependent on the Mindanao interior even for rice and produce. Although the Spaniards thought they had dealt the death blow for the sultanate when they captured Jolo in 1876, rather, the sultanate&#x27;s capital and economic and trading hub was moved to Maimbung on the other side of the island. Up until the American occupation, this was the residence and economic centre of Sulu. This is where the Sultan Jamalul Kiram II and his adviser Hadji Butu began the Sulu pearling industry to increase the sultan&#x27;s wealth, they organised the Sulu pearling fleet, which remained active well into the early 20th century. In 1910, the sultan reportedly sold a giant pearl in London for $100,000.
==Culture==
===Social class system===
Among the people of the Sultanate of Sulu, nobility could be acquired only by lineage, a closed hereditary system.
There were two royal classes:
* Datu (&quot;susultanun&quot;), acquired purely by lineage. All male members of the royal house of Sulu held this title and style &quot;His Royal Highness (HRH)&quot;. Their spouses automatically held the title of &quot;Dayangdayang&quot; (princess of the first degree). Adopted members of the royal house of Sulu were styled &quot;His Highness (HH)&quot; and their spouses also held the title of Dayangdayang and the style: &quot;Her Highness&quot;.
* Datu sadja, which may be acquired through confirming the titles (&quot;gullal&quot;) on the middleman of the sultan. The gullal is made if a commoner has achieved outstanding feats or services in line of duty through display of bravery, heroism, etc. Datu sadja is a life title of nobility and the title holders hold the style &quot;His Excellency&quot; and their spouses should hold the title of &quot;dayang&quot; the style &quot;Her Excellency&quot;.
Maharlika, or commoners, do not trace their descent from royalty. The upper subclasses held administrative roles:

* Wakil Kesultanan – regional representative outside the sultanate
* Panglima – regional representative inside the sultanate
* Parkasa – aide-de-camp of region representative inside the sultanate
* Laksaman– subregional representative inside the sultanate

The males who hold the offices above were addressed by the title of nobility &quot;Tuan&quot; (the title is directly attached to the office), followed by the rank of the office they hold, their given name, surname and region. The females who held offices above shall be addressed by the title of nobility &quot;Sitti&quot; (the title is directly attached to the office), followed by the same name order.

A very large part of the Sulu society, as well as in the Sultanate of Maguindanao were slaves captured from slave raids or bought from slave markets. They were known as the &quot;bisaya&quot;, reflecting their most common origin – Christianized Visayans from Spanish territories in the Philippines – although they also included captured slaves from other ethnic groups throughout Southeast Asia. They were also known as &quot;banyaga&quot;, &quot;ipun&quot;, or &quot;ammas&quot;. It is estimated that as much as 50% of the population of Sulu in the 1850s were &quot;bisaya&quot; slaves and dominated the Sulu economy. For the most part, they were treated like commoners, with their own houses and were responsible for cultivating farms and fisheries of Tausug nobility. But there were harsh punishments for attempts to escape, and a large number of the slaves were sold to European, Chinese, Makassar, and Bugis slavers in the Dutch East Indies.

===Visual arts===

The Sultanate of Sulu, along with the rest of Mindanao, has a long tradition of decorative arts known as &quot;ukkil&quot; or &quot;okir&quot;. Ukkil is the Tausug word for &quot;wood carving&quot; or &quot;engraving&quot;. The Tausug and Maranao peoples traditionally carved and decorated their boats, houses and even grave markers with ukkil carvings. Aside from wood carvings, ukkil motifs were found on various clothing in the Sulu archipelago. Ukkil motifs tend to emphasise geometric patterns and a flowing design, with floral and leaf patterns as well as folk elements. The Tausug also decorated their weapons with these motifs, and various &quot;kris&quot; and &quot;barong&quot; blades have finely decorated handles as well as blades covered in floral patterns and the like. Bronze &quot;lantaka&quot; also bear some ukkil patterns.

<text>Grænalón (, &quot;Green Lagoon&quot;) was one of the glacial lakes of the Icelandic glacier Vatnajökull. It was situated in the south of Iceland. Its surface measured 18 km2 during the 20th Century.

Grænalón was bound and naturally dammed by the northwestern edge of &quot;Skeiðarájökull&quot; glacier, which is a Southbound downhill glacial flow from the body of Vatnajökull. Because of the glacier&#x27;s considerable thinning and shortening in the last few decades, Grænalón has almost completely drained and disappeared. At present, the lake does not exist as more than pond, as seen in Google Timelapse.

<text>Francisco Manuel Oller y Cestero (June 17, 1833 – May 17, 1917) was a Puerto Rican painter, the only Latin American painter to have played a role in the development of Impressionism. One of the most distinguished transatlantic painters of his day, Oller helped transform painting in the Caribbean.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Francisco Manuel Oller y Cestero was born in Bayamón, Puerto Rico, the third of four children of aristocratic and wealthy Spanish parents Cayetano Juan Oller y Fromesta and María del Carmen Cestero Dávila. When he was eleven he began to study art under the tutelage of Juan Cleto Noa, a painter who had an art academy in San Juan, Puerto Rico. There, Oller demonstrated that he had an enormous talent in art and in 1848, when Oller was fifteen years old, General Juan Prim, Governor of Puerto Rico, offered Oller the opportunity to continue his studies in Rome. However, the offer was not accepted as Oller&#x27;s mother felt that he was too young to travel abroad alone.

When Oller was eighteen, he moved to Madrid, Spain, where he studied painting at the Royal Academy of San Fernando, under the tutelage of Don Federico de Madrazo y Kuntz, director of the Prado Museum. In 1858, he moved to Paris, France where he studied under Thomas Couture. Later he enrolled to study art in the Louvre under the instruction of Gustave Courbet. During his free time, Oller, who had a baritone type of singing voice, worked and participated in local Italian operas. He frequently visited cafés where he met with fellow artists. He also became a friend of fellow Puerto Ricans Ramón Emeterio Betances y Alacán and Salvador Carbonell del Toro, who were expatriates in France because of their political beliefs. In 1859, Oller exhibited some of his artistic works next to those of Bazille, Renoir, Monet, and Sisley.

For a short time, Paul Cézanne was one of Oller&#x27;s students, although their professional relationship deteriorated with time. By 1865, Oller was the first Puerto Rican and Hispanic Impressionist artist. In 1868, he founded The Free Academy of Art of Puerto Rico.

=== Realism Period (1840–1903) ===
Oller’s paintings were a big contribution of history during this time.  His paintings showed conflicts and daily lives of people outside of his home country as well as subjects internally. The author Edward J. Sullivan describes in his book, &quot;From San Juan to Paris and Back: Francisco Oller and Caribbean Art in the Era of Impressionism&quot;:In the normal course of his day, the artist would have observed objects of quotidian use to the slaves and free persons of color with whom he regularly interacted. His world was not only the cultivated, Europeanized milieus of the Puerto Rican bourgeoisie, but also the realities of the relatively small city of San Juan, where he was born and where most of his career developed. Even during his many years of residence in Madrid and Paris, he would have carried with him the cultural baggage of his place of origin. His familiarity with the different strata of society on the Caribbean island of his birth was a constant reality as he intermingled with Realist and Impressionist artists and others who constituted his world on the other side of the Atlantic. This aspect of his personality cannot be easily separated from the other. Oller was a person of multiple cultural affinities, which allowed him to embrace what he saw abroad, but also to interiorize and reformulate those elements for purposes that conformed to his vision of tropical reality.
Upon his return to Puerto Rico from France in 1866 he found himself face-to-face with slavery and he would create a number of works including (The negro being flogged), (the punishment of the negro in love), and others depicting slavery in Puerto Rico.

===Impression Period (1874–1893)===
Oller spent nearly two decades in Europe working alongside the pioneers of Impressionism, and, through his travels, participated in a vibrant exchange of aesthetic ideas, forging his own brand of international modernism while engaging social issues unique to the Caribbean. During his three trips to Paris, Oller affiliated himself with Paul Cézanne, fellow Caribbean artist Camille Pissarro (born in St. Thomas), and other members of the Impressionist and Post-Impressionist movements.

===Later years===
Throughout his later life and after his death, Oller was compared to Jose Campeche as one of the most outstanding figures of the arts in his country. Campeche created an impressive body of portraits and religious subjects.

In 1884, he founded an art school for young women which was later to be known as the Universidad Nacional. In 1871, Spain honored Oller by naming him a member of the Caballeros de la Orden de Carlos III (which translates to Knighthood of the Order of Carlos III), and a year later he became the official painter of the Royal Court of Amadeo I. Oller developed an interest in bringing out the reality of Puerto Rico&#x27;s landscape, its people, and culture through his works of art. Oller&#x27;s paintings can be found in museums worldwide, including the Musée d&#x27;Orsay in France.

Oller died on May 17, 1917, in San Juan, Puerto Rico. He was buried at the Santa María Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

==Styles and influences==
Oller was a prolific painter with works ranging in topic from still-lifes and landscapes to historical events and portraiture. While he was involved with several painting movements, Realism, Naturalism and Impressionism; he is best known for his Impressionist works. Oller’s style of painting made him stand out among the many artists that took part in the depiction of Puerto Rico’s lush tropical landscapes of both rural and urban landscapes and provided a realistic image of Puerto Rico compared to the European artists that flocked over to the Caribbean to paint lush, idealized landscapes of the environment. Oller’s main subject matter of focus was everything within Puerto Rico, whether it was still life paintings of plantains and bananas or historical battle scenes. Oller&#x27;s painting style provided a historical context for his painting, providing a cultural view through his own lens. Oller was involved with many art movements from the realist art movement, the naturalist art movement, and the impressionist art movement of which he is best known for. In his life, Oller spent nearly two decades in Europe working alongside the pioneers of these art movements, drawing influence from them in the evolution of his artwork. One characteristic that is quite apparent in his work that he drew influence from another artist is his sober, unidealized depictions of rural workers in Puerto Rico.The &quot;plantation portraits&quot; by Oller, as well as those by Mendes Belisario in Jamaica and dozens of others throughout the Caribbean and the southern United States (where the plantations mostly served the cotton industry), were part of a long tradition of depictions of agriculture and servitude. Rarely, if ever, depicting the negative associations of enslaved or indentured labor, they attempted to create nostalgic views of the &quot;old homestead,&quot; or a faraway venue of nostalgia. While Oller’s plantation pictures were executed in a somewhat different spirit, they nonetheless pertain to this genre that played a significant role throughout the development of visualization in a Caribbean context over a period of some 150 years. Oller was influenced by Barbizon school painter Jean-François Millet to paint in this way, allowing him to provide a realistic depiction of the life of Puerto Ricans in their historical context. In his early years, Francisco Oller was taught by European painters at the Academia, including French neoclassical painter Jean Baptiste Vermay. His main source of influence in his early years comes from two painters, the Spaniard Luis Paret y Alcázar and, most significantly, the Puerto Rican José Campeche y Jordán. The artwork of José Campeche provided Oller a major point of reference for him in his young years as a developing artist. Francisco Oller was compared to Campeche as one of the most prominent artists in his country’s history. Oller not only drew inspiration from the work of Campeche but copied works of art by him and even lived in the artist’s former house.

==Selected works==
* &quot;El pleito de la herencia&quot; (1854–1856)
* &quot;Retrato de Manuel Sicardó&quot; (1866–1868)
* &quot;El Estudiante&quot; (1874)
* &quot;Las lavanderas&quot; (1887–1888)
* &quot;Battle of Treviño&quot; (1879)
** Oller painted Colonel Juan Contreras as the central figure during a battle that took place on July 8, 1875. The battle was part of the Carlist Wars, a 19th-century war over the succession of the Spanish throne. Oller painted this during his final visit to Europe, where he was appointed as the official painter of the Spanish Court of King Alfonso XII. The artist opposed the conventions of realism and precision of more traditional military paintings. Instead, he uses Impressionistic style to capture the atmosphere and drama of the moment. Dabs of color blend together to create an out-of-focus effect. Oller also effectively used lines to draw attention to Colonel Contreras; the clouds, hills, and soldiers direct focus to the central figure. The author Edward J. Sullivan wrote:

The Battle of Treviño denotes a significant moment for Oller within the world of Spanish art. The painting represents an official theme of recent national history, through which the artist places himself in the tradition of military images that was of great importance in later nineteenth-century Iberian painting. The genre of battle painting is one of the least avant-garde artistic forms. Oller, an artist often associated with the &quot;new&quot; in art, is here going against that grain and inserting himself directly within a mode most often practiced by artists of a decidedly conservative personality. Nevertheless, he used this form as a way to experiment with the possibilities of a spontaneity and pictorial freedom within the framework of traditional subject matter.

* &quot;La Escuela del Maestro Rafael Cordero&quot; (1890–1892)
** The subject of this painting, Rafael Cordero, was the founder of the first school in Puerto Rico for both the formerly enslaved and children of enslaved persons. By the late 1820s, the school admitted male children of all races and social strata. Cordero was both the sole instructor and manual laborer, making cigars and cigarettes in his workshop, where class took place. We can see his tobacco work table in the bottom right-hand corner. The children are of different socioeconomic classes and skin tones; the artist portrays the importance and accessibility of education to all races. The two children in the foreground, one holding an egg and the other holding bread, suggests the intermingling of race. As an abolitionist himself, Oller portrays the acceptance of race in the developing country during this time. Cordero&#x27;s expression is exasperated and exhausted; despite this, he persists to provide education to the children. The setting is very conservative with religious symbolism on the walls. The walls are plain and cracked. Oller portrayed his subject as glamorous, as an &quot;unsung hero&quot;.
* &quot;El Velorio&quot; (&quot;The Wake&quot;) (1893)
** This 8-by-13-foot painting was one of the few that had survived while many of his works were lost or damaged beyond repair.  &quot;El Velorio&quot; was not seen as the most glamorous but was shown in the Paris Salon in 1895. Oller uses small, visible brush strokes and an emphasis on an accurate depiction of light and mastery of color in its changing qualities in his paintings. The painting depicts the wake or, in Puerto Rican Spanish, &quot;baquiné&quot; of a dead child laid on a table covered with flowers. Participants totally ignore the child and instead celebrate with food, drink, games, songs, dancing and prayer. The reason for this is that they believe it is a time for celebration for the child has become an angel and should be properly sent off. All the while the parents are mourning over the loss of their child and some are consoling the mother.  Oller’s painting is considered a Puerto Rican national treasure and is not allowed to leave the Museum of History, Anthropology, and Art at the University of Puerto Rico&#x27;s Río Piedras campus.

==Legacy and remembrance==
Oller was responsible for bringing Realism and Impressionism to San Juan, Puerto Rico. Combining them with the artistic traditions of San Juan, he revolutionized the school of painting in Puerto Rico and throughout the Caribbean region. Oller also helped bring outside world events by drawing them and displaying them publicly. Many Puerto Rican artists have followed in Oller&#x27;s footsteps, including Ramón Fradé (1875-1954) and Miguel Pou (1880-1968).

The town of Cataño in Puerto Rico, named a high school after him and the City of New York renamed P.S.61 in The Bronx P.S. Francisco Oller. There is also a Francisco Oller Library in the Escuela de Artes Plásticas (School of Plastic Arts) in San Juan. The Francisco Oller Museum where many artists, such as Tomás Batista, exhibit their work is located in the city of Bayamón. In Buffalo, New York there is a Francisco Oller and Diego Rivera Museum of Art where Manuel Rivera-Ortiz and other artists have exhibited their work.

<text>In graph theory, an acyclic coloring is a (proper) vertex coloring in which every 2-chromatic subgraph is acyclic. The acyclic chromatic number of a graph is the fewest colors needed in any acyclic coloring of .

Acyclic coloring is often associated with graphs embedded on non-plane surfaces.

== Upper bounds ==
A(&quot;G&quot;) ≤ 2 if and only if &quot;G&quot; is acyclic.

Bounds on A(&quot;G&quot;) in terms of Δ(&quot;G&quot;), the maximum degree of &quot;G&quot;, include the following:
* A(&quot;G&quot;) ≤ 4 if Δ(&quot;G&quot;) = 3. 
* A(&quot;G&quot;) ≤ 5 if Δ(&quot;G&quot;) = 4. 
* A(&quot;G&quot;) ≤ 7 if Δ(&quot;G&quot;) = 5. 
* A(&quot;G&quot;) ≤ 12 if Δ(&quot;G&quot;) = 6. 

A milestone in the study of acyclic coloring is the following affirmative answer to a conjecture of Grünbaum:

:Theorem A(&quot;G&quot;) ≤ 5 if &quot;G&quot; is planar graph.

 introduced acyclic coloring and acyclic chromatic number, and conjectured the result in the above theorem. Borodin&#x27;s proof involved several years of painstaking inspection of 450 reducible configurations. One consequence of this theorem is that every planar graph can be decomposed into an independent set and two induced forests. 

== Algorithms and complexity ==
It is NP-complete to determine whether A(&quot;G&quot;) ≤ 3. 

 showed that the decision variant of the problem is NP-complete even when &quot;G&quot; is a bipartite graph.

 demonstrated that every proper vertex coloring of a chordal graph is also an acyclic coloring.
Since chordal graphs can be optimally colored in O(&quot;n&quot; + &quot;m&quot;) time, the same is also true for acyclic coloring on that class of graphs.

A linear-time algorithm to acyclically color a graph of maximum degree ≤ 3 using 4 colors or fewer was given by .

<text>Giant&#x27;s Castle is a mountain located within the Drakensberg range in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. It includes a grassy plateau nestled among the deep valleys of the southern end of the central Drakensberg. Together, the shape of the peaks and escarpment are thought to resemble a sleeping giant&#x27;s profile; hence, its name.

Giant&#x27;s Castle is best known for its nature reserve and the bushman rock art preserved at its main caves, and the game reserve is home of the eland as well as the bearded vulture and Cape vulture. The area is considered one of South Africa&#x27;s many adventure areas, and attracts hikers, nature enthusiasts, and other tourists. It also hosts the Giant&#x27;s Challenge marathon in April each year. The Treverton Grade 10s take a 15 day hike to summit this peak in their 3rd term. 

==Hiking Trails==
There are in excess of 25 walks in the Giant&#x27;s Castle Game Reserve. The network of trails here includes to hikes, spanning from 1 hour to overnight.

There are currently 14 recognized escarpment passes in the region (listed north to south):
* Corner Pass 
* Around the Corner Pass (variation route on Corner Pass with alternative summit)
* Judge Pass 
* Gypaetus Pass (opened in September 2012) 
* Bannerman Pass
* Thumb Pass (opened in 1997)

<doc id="690775" wikidata="Q7624545" url="?curid=690775" title="Strong coloring">
<text>In graph theory, a strong coloring, with respect to a partition of the vertices into (disjoint) subsets of equal sizes, is a (proper) vertex coloring in which every color appears exactly once in every part. A graph is strongly &quot;k&quot;-colorable if, for each partition of the vertices into sets of size &quot;k&quot;, it admits a strong coloring. When the order of the graph &quot;G&quot; is not divisible by &quot;k&quot;, we add isolated vertices to &quot;G&quot; just enough to make the order of the new graph &#x27; divisible by &quot;k&quot;. In that case, a strong coloring of&#x27; minus the previously added isolated vertices is considered a strong coloring of &quot;G&quot;. 

The strong chromatic number sχ(&quot;G&quot;) of a graph &quot;G&quot; is the least &quot;k&quot; such that &quot;G&quot; is strongly &quot;k&quot;-colorable.
A graph is strongly &quot;k&quot;-chromatic if it has strong chromatic number &quot;k&quot;.

Some properties of sχ(&quot;G&quot;):
# sχ(&quot;G&quot;) &gt; Δ(&quot;G&quot;).
# sχ(&quot;G&quot;) ≤ 3 Δ(&quot;G&quot;) − 1.
# Asymptotically, sχ(&quot;G&quot;) ≤ 11 Δ(&quot;G&quot;) / 4 + o(Δ(&quot;G&quot;)).
Here, Δ(&quot;G&quot;) is the maximum degree.

Strong chromatic number was independently introduced by Alon (1988) and Fellows (1990).

== Related problems ==
Given a graph and a partition of the vertices, an independent transversal is a set &quot;U&quot; of non-adjacent vertices such that each part contains exactly one vertex of &quot;U&quot;. A strong coloring is equivalent to a partition of the vertices into disjoint independent-transversals (each independent-transversal is a single &quot;color&quot;). This is in contrast to graph coloring, which is a partition of the vertices of a graph into a given number of independent sets, without the requirement that these independent sets be transversals.

To illustrate the difference between these concepts, consider a faculty with several departments, where the dean wants to construct a committee of faculty members. But some faculty members are in conflict and will not sit in the same committee. If the &quot;conflict&quot; relations are represented by the edges of a graph, then:

* An independent set is a committee with no conflict.
* An independent transversal is a committee with no conflict, with exactly one member from each department.
* A graph coloring is a partitioning of the faculty members into committees with no conflict.
* A strong coloring is a partitioning of the faculty members into committees with no conflict and with exactly one member from each department. Thus this problem is sometimes called the happy dean problem.

<text>Grímsvötn (; &quot;vötn&quot; = &quot;waters&quot;, singular: ) is an active volcano with a (partially subglacial) fissure system located in Vatnajökull National Park, Iceland. The central volcano is completely subglacial and located under the northwestern side of the Vatnajökull ice cap. The subglacial caldera is at , at an elevation of . Beneath the caldera is the magma chamber of the Grímsvötn volcano.

Grímsvötn is a basaltic volcano which has the highest eruption frequency of all the volcanoes in Iceland. It has a southwest-northeast-trending fissure system. The massive climate-impacting Laki fissure eruption of 1783–1784 took place in a part of the same Grímsvötn-Laki volcanic system. Grímsvötn was erupting at the same time as Laki during 1783, but continued to erupt until 1785. Because most of the volcanic system lies underneath Vatnajökull, most of its eruptions have been subglacial and the interaction of magma and meltwater from the ice causes phreatomagmatic explosive activity. Within the Grímsvötn-Laki volcanic system is a second central volcano called Thordarhyrna (Þórðarhyrna).

== Jökulhlaup ==
Eruptions in the caldera regularly cause glacial outbursts known as jökulhlaup. Eruptions or geothermal activity, melt enough ice to fill the Grímsvötn caldera with water, and the pressure may be enough to suddenly lift the ice cap, allowing huge quantities of water to escape rapidly. Earthquakes and seismic tremor may occur. Jökulhlaup can occur independent of eruptions or be followed by eruptions. Jökulhlaup independent of eruptions occurred in November, December 2021 and October 2022. Jökulhlaup which were followed by eruptions occurred in 1922, 1934 and 2004. Consequently, the Grímsvötn caldera is monitored very carefully.

When a large eruption occurred in 1996, geologists knew well in advance that a glacial burst was imminent. It did not occur until several weeks after the eruption finished, but monitoring ensured that the Icelandic ring road (Hringvegur) was closed when the burst occurred. A section of road across the Skeiðará sandur was washed away in the ensuing flood, but no one was hurt.

== Eruption history between 1990 and today ==
=== Gjálp 1996 ===
&quot;(See also the main article: 1996 eruption of Gjálp&quot;

The Gjálp fissure vent eruption in 1996 revealed that an interaction may exist between Bárðarbunga and Grímsvötn. A strong earthquake at Bárðarbunga, about magnitude 5, is believed to have been related to the triggering of the eruption in Gjálp. On the other hand, because the magma erupted showed strong connections to the Grímsvötn Volcanic System according to petrology studies, the 1996 as well as a former eruption at Gjálp in the 1930s are thought to have taken place within Grímsvötn Volcanic system.

=== 1998 and 2004 eruptions ===
A week-long eruption occurred at Grímsvötn starting on 28 December 1998, but no glacial burst occurred. In November 2004, a week-long eruption occurred. Volcanic ash from the eruption fell as far away as mainland Europe and caused short-term disruption of airline traffic into Iceland, but again no glacial burst followed the eruption.

=== 2011 eruption ===

Harmonic tremors were recorded twice around Grímsvötn on 2 and 3 October 2010, possibly indicating an impending eruption. At the same time, sudden inflation was measured by GPS in the volcano, indicating magma movement under the caldera. On 1 November 2010 meltwater from the Vatnajökull glacier was flowing into a lake, suggesting that an eruption of the underlying volcano could be imminent.

On 21 May 2011 at 19:25 UTC, an eruption began, with high plumes accompanied by multiple earthquakes, Until 25 May, the eruption scale had been larger than that of the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull.
The ash cloud from the eruption rose to , and was so far 10 times larger than the 2004 eruption, and the strongest in Grímsvötn in the last 100 years.
Disruption to air travel in Iceland commenced on 22 May, followed by Greenland, Scotland, Norway, Svalbard and a small part of Denmark on subsequent days. On 24 May the disruption spread to Northern Ireland and to airports in northern England. The cancellation of 900 out of 90,000 European flights in the period 23–25 May was much less widespread than the 2010 disruption after the Eyjafjallajökull eruption.

The eruption stopped at 02:40 UTC on 25 May 2011, although there was some explosive activity from the eruptive vents affecting only the area around the crater.

=== 2020 onward threats of eruption ===
In June 2020, the Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO) issued a warning that an eruption might take place in the coming weeks or months, following scientists reporting high levels of sulfur dioxide, which is indicative of the presence of shallow magma. IMO warned that a glacial flood as a result of melting ice could trigger an eruption. No eruption occurred.

In September 2021, an increase in water outflow from under the Vatnajökull ice cap was reported. The water contains elevated levels of dissolved hydrogen sulfide, suggesting increased volcanic activity under the ice. Jökulhlaup (glacial lake flooding) can occur before or after an eruption.

On 4 December 2021, a jökulhlaup occurred from Grímsvötn into the Gígjukvísl river, with an average flow of . Two days later, the Icelandic Meteorological Office increased the alert level for Grímsvötn from yellow to orange, after a series of earthquakes was detected. On 7 December, the alert level was lowered back to yellow, after seismic activity decreased and no signs of eruptive activity were detected.

On 11 December 2023, a jökulhlaup followed in time, a earthquake.

== Eruption history before 1990 ==
Tephra studies on soil samples from around the Vatnajökull ice-cap, show that the Grímsvötn volcanic system has high activity for Iceland, and had between 4 to 14 explosive eruptions every 100 years (mean about 7 eruptions every 100 years) between 7600 years ago and 870 AD. For technical reasons only the last 10,200 years of explosive eruptions have been characterised locally, and the record gets more inaccurate with time especially prior to 1598, which is first eruption timed to the day. The Laki eruptions which were both effusive and explosive between June 1783 and February 1784, produced the Skaftáreldahraun lava flows, which cover a large part of south-east Iceland. Before this the tip of the Rauðhólar-Eldgígur fissure system was active with the production of the 4550 BCE Botnahraun lava flow which extends beyond the furtherest extent to the south of the Laki lava field. The Rauðhólar-Eldgígur fissure system also formed the Núpahraun lava flows around 4000 that extend from the Vatnajökull glacier towards the south east coast and are covered in part by the northern Laki Skaftáreldahraun lava flow. There are two recent pre-historic but undated Bergvatnsárhraun lava flows just on the south-eastern edge of the Vatnajökull glacier, related to the line of the Rauðhólar-Eldgígur fissures.

== Bacteria in the subglacial lakes ==
In 2004, a community of bacteria was detected in water of the Grímsvötn lake under the glacier, the first time that bacteria have been found in a subglacial lake. The lakes never freeze because of the volcanic heat. The bacteria can also survive at low concentrations of oxygen. The site is a possible analogue for life on the planet Mars, because there are also traces of volcanism and glaciers on Mars and thus the findings could help identify how to look for life on Mars.

== Geology ==
There is the potential for mechanical interaction such as dyke propagation between Grímsvötn and Thordarhyrna. Interactions can also occur with the nearby Bárðarbunga volcano, which is part of a separate volcanic system. The volcano erupts predominantly tholeiitic basalt, and a close chemical affinity exists with the other lavas of the Grímsvötn-Laki volcanic system. The compositional separation from nearby systems has been studied in some detail, and is used to assign lava and tephra deposits to the volcanic system. Some of the tephra&#x27;s erupted have transpired to have mixed compositions with nearby volcanic systems and it is not known if this is due to dual eruptions or intusions crossing magma reserviors. The volcanic system is part of the Eastern volcanic zone of Iceland, and is directly over the Iceland mantle plume. The volcanic system has crater rows extending to the south east; the long Laki–Grímsvötn fissure system and the long Rauðhólar-Eldgígur fissure system. The Rauðhólar-Eldgígur fissure system has been related by some authors to an alignment with the Thordarhyrna central volcano with the Laki–Grímsvötn more in alignment with the Grímsvötn central volcano. Eruptives from Grímsvötn and Thordarhyrna are able to be geochemically distinguished between, so it is possible that the two central volcanoes are not one system. Thordarhyrna has rhyolite formations which have not been found at Grímsvötn.

== Future trends ==
Studies indicate that volcanic activity in Iceland rises and falls so that the frequency and size of eruptions in and around the Vatnajökull ice cap varies with time. It is believed that the four eruptions between 1996 and 2011 could mark the beginning of an active period, during which an eruption in Grímsvötn in Vatnajökull may be expected every 2–7 years. Parallel volcanic activity in nearby Bárðarbunga is known to be associated with increased activity in Grímsvötn. Seismic activity has been increasing in the area in recent years, indicating the entry of magma.

<doc id="690780" wikidata="Q1053368" url="?curid=690780" title="Artocarpus integer">
<text>Artocarpus integer, commonly known as chempedak or cempedak, is a species of tree in the family Moraceae, in the same genus as breadfruit and jackfruit. It is native to Southeast Asia. Cempedak is an important crop in Malaysia and is also popularly cultivated in southern Thailand and parts of Indonesia, and has the potential to be utilized in other areas. It is currently limited in range to Southeast Asia, with some trees in Australia and Hawaii.

==Description==
Cempedak trees are large, evergreen trees. They can grow to a height of 20 m, although most reach only a dozen meters. The trees are monoecious, with male and female flowers growing on the same tree. There are many varieties, although few are named. The vigorously growing tree can bear heavy crops of fruit once or twice a year.

===Fruit===
The syncarp may be cylindrical to spherical in shape, and ranges from 10 to 15 cm across and 20 to 35 cm in length. The thin and leathery skin is greenish, yellowish to brownish in color, and patterned with pentagons that are either raised protuberances or flat eye facets.

Fleshy, edible arils surround the large seeds in a thick layer. The arils are edible raw, or they can be prepared in a number of ways. They are yellowish-white to orange in color, sweet and fragrant, soft, slippery and slimy on the tongue and slightly fibrous. Ripe cempedak fruit has a pungent smell that has been described as harsh and penetrating like that of durian. The taste of the fruit is similar to the related jackfruit and breadfruit with a hint of durian. The seeds, which are also edible, are flattened spheres or elongated, about 2–3 cm in length.

Cempedak is similar to jackfruit in many ways, but is smaller than jackfruit and the peduncle is thinner. The male inflorescence of cempedak is pale green to yellow compared to the dark green of jackfruit. The cempedak flesh is darker yellow and juicier when ripe.

==Cultivation==
===Conditions===
Cempedak trees are normally planted in non-eroded and well-drained soils, although they can tolerate temporary flooding. They can be grown from sea level to altitude at temperatures between and with annual rainfall of .

===Propagation===
In the Malay Archipelago, cempedak is usually cultivated with other fruit trees in mixed orchard systems of small farmers and occasionally in large fruit plantations. The trees are normally propagated by bud-grafting to maintain desired genetic traits. Plants are also propagated by seed, but the seeds spoil quickly after removal from the fruit, so they must be planted immediately after cleaning.

===Flowering and fruit===
Trees begin to bear fruit at 3–6 years for trees planted by seed and at 2–4 years for clonal trees. Blossoms are common from February to April and then again in August to October in southern Malaysia, as opposed to in western Java, where cempedak tend to flower in July and August. From flowering to ripening fruit takes about 2–4 months.

===Harvest===
The timing of harvest is critical in assuring fruit quality. One of the most reliable ways to determine the maturity of cempedak is to tap the fruit and listen for a dull hollow sound. Skin color can also be an indicator of maturity, as ripened skins turn from green to a yellower color. The development of a characteristic odor similar to that of durian can also mark maturity of the fruit, in addition to the spines of the fruits&#x27; skin becoming flattened. Fruit are harvested ideally before falling to avoid damage, loss of shelf life and premature ripening. The harvested fruit produces a latex exudate, and is left to drain in the field before being moved from the orchard. The fruit has a short shelf life of 2–3 days.

==Uses==
Cempedak is sought after for its edible, pulpy flesh that is typically yellow/orange and rich in beta-carotene. It has a sweetly unique flavor akin to that of durian and mango.

The fruit is normally consumed in the areas where it is cultivated and can be eaten fresh or cooked. The large fruit are often cut open and sliced into pieces for sale. The seeds can be fried, boiled or grilled, then peeled and eaten with salt. The taste of the seeds is similar to water chestnuts. The young fruit, like young jackfruit, can be used as a vegetable. In this case, the young fruit is peeled, sliced and boiled, then sometimes seasoned or added as an ingredient to other foods, such as curries. In South and East Kalimantan, Indonesia, people historically consume cempedak&#x27;s lactic acid bacteria-fermented inner skin, traditionally termed &quot;dami&quot; or &quot;mandai.&quot; The skin can be processed by peeling the fruit until it looks white, then fermenting the inner skin. &quot;Mandai&quot; is usually consumed after frying.

The wood is of good quality, strong and durable, and used as building material for home furnishings or boats. The fibrous bark can be used to make ropes. Yellow dye can also be produced from the wood.

<doc id="690781" wikidata="Q1445155" url="?curid=690781" title="Garfield Barwick">
<text>Sir Garfield Edward John Barwick (22 June 190313 July 1997) was an Australian judge who was the seventh and longest serving Chief Justice of Australia, in office from 1964 to 1981. He had earlier been a Liberal Party politician, serving as a minister in the Menzies government from 1958 to 1964.

Barwick was born in Sydney, and attended Fort Street High School before going on to study law at the University of Sydney. He was called to the bar in 1927 and became one of Australia&#x27;s most prominent barristers, appearing in many high-profile cases and frequently before the High Court. He served terms as president of the NSW Bar Association and the Law Council of Australia. Barwick entered politics only at the age of 54, winning election to the House of Representatives at the 1958 Parramatta by-election. Prime Minister Robert Menzies made him Attorney-General by the end of the year, and in 1961 he was additionally made Minister for External Affairs.

In 1964, Menzies nominated Barwick as his choice to replace the retiring Owen Dixon as Chief Justice. Over the next 17 years, the Barwick court decided many significant constitutional cases, including a significant broadening of the corporations power and several cases regarding the constitutional basis of taxation. Barwick also played a small but significant role in the 1975 constitutional crisis, advising Governor-General John Kerr that it was within his powers to dismiss Prime Minister Gough Whitlam from office. He retired from the court at the age of 77, but remained a public figure until his death at the age of 94. Outside of his professional career, he also served as the inaugural president of the Australian Conservation Foundation.

==Early life and education==
Barwick was one of three brothers born to Methodist parents, of Cornish origin; he was later very insistent on his Cornish identity. He was raised in Stanmore, an inner-city suburb of Sydney, and attended Fort Street High School. He graduated from the University of Sydney with a University Medal in law.

==Legal career==
A very diligent student, Barwick was admitted to legal practice soon after finishing university, although (on his own later admission) he suffered severely in financial terms during the Great Depression. He was guarantor for a bank loan to his younger brother to operate a service station in Ashfield, but was unable to repay the bank when the loan was forfeited, and was made bankrupt after he sued the oil companies for defamation. This was held against him by many throughout his career.

Nevertheless, he practised as a barrister from 1927 in many jurisdictions, achieving considerable recognition and the reluctant respect of opponents. At the beginning of World War 2, Barwick&#x27;s challenges to the National Security Act 1939, which centralised the power to the Australian government, propelled him to the front rank of the Bar.

He became publicly prominent in the 1943 case over the artistic merits of William Dobell&#x27;s Archibald Prize-winning portrait of the painter Joshua Smith; a losing entrant claimed the picture was caricature, not portraiture. Barwick represented the plaintiff, and although they lost, the judges commended him for the brilliance of his arguments and his name became well known from that point onwards.

Having been briefed in many of Australia&#x27;s defining constitutional cases (e.g., the Airlines case, and the Bank Nationalisation case), he was knighted in 1953.

A famous example of his astute advocacy involved thirteen Malaysians sentenced to death who appealed to the Privy Council. Twelve retained Barwick, who duly found a technical deficiency in the arrest warrants and secured their freedom. The last, whose counsel was not so thorough, was hanged.

A member of the Liberal Party, Barwick was elected to the House of Representatives at the 1958 Parramatta by-election, beginning his parliamentary career at the relatively late age of 54. He was re-elected in the general elections of 1958, 1961, and 1963.

After the 1958 election, Barwick was promoted to cabinet as Attorney-General, replacing the retiring Neil O&#x27;Sullivan. In that position, he guided through legislation amending the &quot;Matrimonial Causes Act&quot; and the &quot;Crimes Act&quot;, and established a model for restrictive trade practices legislation. He also gained public notice for his role in the case of an alleged Estonian war criminal, Ervin Viks, who had settled in Australia and was being pursued by the Soviet Union. Barwick refused to accept the USSR&#x27;s extradition request, as there was no extradition treaty between the two countries; Viks had passed immigration screening processes and it was argued any such extradition would undermine Australian sovereignty. After the 1961 election, Barwick was additionally made Minister for External Affairs. He led the Australian delegation to the General Assembly of the United Nations for its 15th, 17th, and 18th sessions.

For some time, Barwick was seen as a likely successor to Robert Menzies as Liberal leader and prime minister. When the news broke that he was entering parliament, Frank Browne confidently wrote:

However, Barwick struggled to adapt to the cut and thrust of political life. There were reports that he was reduced to tears by a vitriolic debate over what became the &quot;Crimes Act 1959&quot;, which he later confirmed had been accurate. In retirement, Menzies said that he &quot;didn&#x27;t understand parliament [...] he was a disappointing politician&quot;. An opinion poll in 1960 found that only three percent of the general public supported him as Menzies&#x27; replacement. He had little support from other Liberal MPs, and speculation about his leadership prospects was largely media-driven. Barwick&#x27;s elevation to the High Court further &quot;cleared the space&quot; for Harold Holt, the deputy leader, and he eventually replaced Menzies as leader unopposed in 1966.

==Chief Justice==

On 27 April 1964, Barwick was appointed Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, succeeding Sir Owen Dixon, being the first law graduate from the University of Sydney to hold the position. He was instrumental in the construction of the High Court building in Canberra (unofficially known, as a result, as &quot;Gar&#x27;s Mahal&quot;), and became the first president of the Australian Conservation Foundation in 1966.

Barwick was one of only eight justices of the High Court to have served in the Parliament of Australia prior to his appointment to the Court; the others were Edmund Barton, Richard O&#x27;Connor, Isaac Isaacs, H. B. Higgins, Edward McTiernan, John Latham, and Lionel Murphy.

In 1972, he became President of the Australian Institute for International Affairs. He was an &quot;ad hoc&quot; judge of the International Court of Justice in 1973–74 in the &quot;Nuclear Tests (Australia v. France)&quot; and &quot;Nuclear Tests (New Zealand v. France)&quot; cases, representing Australia and New Zealand jointly.

A significant decision of the Barwick court marked the beginning of the modern interpretation of the corporations power, which had been interpreted narrowly since 1909. The Concrete Pipes case (1971) established that the federal parliament could exercise the power to regulate at least the trading activities of corporations, whereas earlier interpretations had allowed only the regulation of conduct or transactions with the public.

The court decided many other significant constitutional cases, including the Seas and Submerged Lands case (1975), upholding legislation asserting sovereignty over the territorial sea; the First (1975) and Second (1977) Territory Senators cases, which concerned whether legislation allowing for the mainland territories to be represented in the Parliament of Australia was valid; and &quot;Russell v Russell&quot; (1976), which concerned the validity of the &quot;Family Law Act 1975&quot;. The court also decided several cases relating to the historic 1974 joint sitting of the Parliament of Australia, including &quot;Cormack v Cope&quot; (1974) and the Petroleum and Minerals Authority case (1975).

The Barwick court decided several infamous cases on tax avoidance and tax evasion, almost always deciding against the taxation office. Led by Barwick himself in most judgments, the court distinguished between avoidance (legitimately minimising one&#x27;s tax obligations) and evasion (illegally evading obligations). The decisions effectively nullified the anti-avoidance legislation and led to the proliferation of avoidance schemes in the 1970s, a result which drew much criticism upon the court.

During the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, he controversially advised Governor-General Sir John Kerr on the constitutional legality of dismissing a prime minister who declined to advise an election when unable to obtain passage of supply. That was significant, because Barwick and Gough Whitlam, whose government Kerr dismissed, had a history of antipathy dating from the mid-1950s. Further, Whitlam had refused Kerr&#x27;s request for permission to consult Barwick, or to act on any advice except his own.

The High Court was due to move to new premises in Canberra in May 1980. A year earlier, in anticipation of the move, Barwick wrote to Malcolm Fraser (who had become prime minister as a result of the dismissal and who was confirmed in office by the December 1975 election), seeking an official residence in the national capital. His request &quot;went down like a lead balloon with the cabinet which had run into trouble with the High Court&#x27;s burgeoning costs while urging economic restraint on other Australians&quot;, and was rejected. The $46.5 million High Court building in Canberra was opened by the Queen in May 1980, and is today still referred to as &quot;Gar&#x27;s Mahal&quot;.

Barwick retired from the bench in 1981, a few months after passing Sir John Latham&#x27;s record as the longest-serving Chief Justice. He retained excellent health and continued to be active as a much-sought-after expert on legal issues until the end of his life. His writings included &quot;Sir John Did His Duty&quot; (a commentary on Kerr&#x27;s dismissal of Whitlam) and his 1995 memoir &quot;A Radical Tory&quot;.

===Privy Council===

Barwick was appointed a Privy Counsellor in 1964 and sat as a member of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on 22 occasions, between 1966, and 1980. Barwick insisted on an amendment to Privy Council procedure to allow dissent, however he exercised that only once. The appeals mostly related to decisions from other Commonwealth countries, although they occasionally included appeals from a State Supreme Court.

Barwick supported the passage of the &quot;Privy Council (Limitation of Appeals) Act 1968&quot;, which closed off appeals from the High Court to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. He said that &quot;Australia needed to make its own legal mistakes&quot;. However, it remained possible to appeal to the Privy Council from state supreme courts until the passage of the &quot;Australia Act 1986&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1929, Barwick married Norma Symons, with whom he had one son and one daughter.

He was the double cousin of Robert Ellicott, also an Attorney-General, and later Justice of the Federal Court of Australia, and who like Barwick attended Fort Street and Sydney University. On 13 July 1997, aged 94, Barwick died. He was cremated and his ashes interred at Northern Suburbs Memorial Gardens.

==Honours==
In June 1953, he was made a Knight Bachelor, &quot;in recognition of service to the Public service&quot;.

In January 1965, he was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG), honouring his contribution as Chief Justice of the High Court.

In June 1981, he was appointed a Knight of the Order of Australia (AK), &quot;in recognition of service to the Australian Parliament, government and the law&quot;.

<text>2C-C is a psychedelic drug of the 2C family. It was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin, sometimes used as an entheogen. In his book &quot;PiHKAL (Phenethylamines i Have Known And Loved)&quot;, Shulgin lists the dosage range as 20–40 mg. 2C-C is usually taken orally, but may also be insufflated. 2C-C is schedule I of section 202(c) of the Controlled Substances Act in the United States, signed into law as of July, 2012 under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act.

Not much information is known about the toxicity of 2C-C.

==Effects==
Over the approximate dose range 20–40 mg, visual effects last approximately 4 to 8 hours.

==Pharmacology==
2C-C acts as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors. It also binds to the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor with 15-fold lower affinity than for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. The drug shows little or no affinity for the monoamine transporters (MATs) and shows very weak or negligible monoamine reuptake inhibition. It shows high affinity for the rat trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), but only weak affinity for the mouse TAAR1.

In contrast to many other psychedelics, 2C-C, as well as 2C-P and certain 2C NBOMe analogues, has shown reinforcing effects in rodents. It produces dose-dependent conditioned place preference (CPP) in mice and self-administration in rats. These findings suggest that 2C-C may have misuse potential. The mechanism by which these effects are produced is unknown. However, 2C-C was found to decrease dopamine transporter (DAT) expression and to increase DAT phosphorylation in the nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) similarly to methamphetamine in rodents. Decreased DAT expression may result in reduced dopamine reuptake, while DAT phosphorylation is associated with dopamine reverse transport and efflux, in turn increasing extracellular dopamine levels.

2C-C has also been found to produce neurotoxicity at high doses in rodents, which appears to be mediated via neuroinflammation.

==Legal status==

===China===
As of October 2015 2C-C is a controlled substance in China.

===Canada===
As of October 31, 2016; 2C-C is a controlled substance (Schedule III) in Canada.

===Germany===
2C-C is an Anlage I controlled drug.

===Sweden===
&quot;Sveriges riksdags&quot; health ministry &quot;Statens folkhälsoinstitut&quot; classified 2C-C as &quot;health hazard&quot; under the act &quot;Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor&quot; (translated &quot;Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health&quot;) as of Mar 1, 2005, in their regulation SFS 2005:26 listed as 2,5-dimetoxi-4-klorfenetylamin (2C-C), making it illegal to sell or possess.

===United States===
As of July 9, 2012, in the United States 2C-C is a Schedule I substance under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, making possession, distribution and manufacture illegal.

<text>Hvítavatn () is a small lake in the southern Highlands of Iceland. It is situated between Sídujökull and Skeiðarájökull, two of the southern arms of the big glacier Vatnajökull, and lies 15 km to the north of the infamous Skeiðará sander.

There are some lakes and rivers with the adjective &quot;hvíta&quot; (meaning &quot;white&quot;) in their name in Iceland. This comes from the origin of most of the freshwater on this island: the glaciers.

<doc id="690793" wikidata="Q470019" url="?curid=690793" title="Terry Funk">
<text>Terrance Dee Funk (June 30, 1944 – August 23, 2023) was an American professional wrestler. Widely considered one of the most influential 
and greatest professional wrestlers of all time, Funk was known for the longevity of his career – which spanned more than 50 years and included multiple short-lived retirements – and the influential hardcore wrestling style he pioneered in the latter part of his career.

Over the course of his career, Funk wrestled for numerous major promotions, among them All Japan Pro Wrestling, Extreme Championship Wrestling, the International Wrestling Association of Japan, Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling, the United States Wrestling Association, World Championship Wrestling, the World Wrestling Federation and multiple National Wrestling Alliance territories including Big Time Wrestling, Championship Wrestling from Florida, Georgia Championship Wrestling and Stampede Wrestling. He was the promoter of the Amarillo-based Western States Sports promotion.

Championships held by Funk included the ECW World Heavyweight Championship, NWA World Heavyweight Championship, USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship, WWF World Tag Team Championship, and ECW World Television Championship. He headlined ECW&#x27;s premier annual pay-per-view event, November to Remember, three times. Funk was inducted into multiple halls of fame, among them WWE, WCW, NWA, and Hardcore.

==Early life==
Funk was born on June 30, 1944, in Hammond, Indiana. He was the son of Dorothy (Culver) and Dory Funk, a professional wrestler and promoter. Following the end of World War II, the family relocated to Amarillo, Texas, where Terry and his brother, known professionally as Dory Jr., grew up in the professional wrestling business. After graduating from Canyon High School, Funk attended West Texas State University (now West Texas A&amp;M University), where he competed in amateur wrestling and football.

==Professional wrestling career==

=== Western States Sports (1965–1979)===

Funk started his career in 1965, working in his father Dory Funk&#x27;s Western States Sports promotion in Amarillo, Texas. His debut match was against Sputnik Monroe on December 9. He and his brother, Dory Funk Jr., quickly rose up the ranks as a team and in single matches against top names like Ernie Ladd and Hank James. They became big money wrestlers by the end of the decade.

=== Championship Wrestling from Florida (1970–1982) ===

In 1975, Terry defeated Jack Brisco for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in Miami, when Dory failed to appear for a title shot. He began a 14-month title reign defending the title against Jack Brisco, Dusty Rhodes, Carlos Rocha, Giant Baba, and Pat O&#x27;Connor. In addition to North America, he defended the belt in Australia, Japan and Singapore. The historic reign ended in Toronto when he was defeated by &quot;Handsome&quot; Harley Race, who had earlier beaten Dory, Jr., for NWA World Heavyweight Championship before losing it to Jack Brisco. Race lifted Funk for a shinbreaker and then trapped him in an Indian death leglock. When Funk failed to respond to referee Fred Atkins the match was stopped.

During 1981, Terry spent some time in the Continental Wrestling Association feuding with Jerry Lawler. The most memorable match in this feud happened in April 1981 at the Mid South Coliseum in Memphis, Tennessee. The match took place in the empty arena, with only Lance Russell, a cameraman, and a photographer present. Funk had challenged Lawler to this match at this time because he felt he was getting unfairly treated in Memphis. The confrontation only lasted a few minutes, and ended with Funk trying to put Lawler&#x27;s eye out with a broken 2x4. But Lawler kicked Funk&#x27;s elbow, causing him to hit himself in the eye. The tape aired on April 25, 1981.

=== All Japan Pro Wrestling (1972–1991) ===
Terry and Dory, Jr. also made a name for themselves in Japan. Terry became a star in the eyes of the Japanese fans with his over the top mannerisms, sometimes colorful get-ups, and his brawling ability. In Japan, the Funks were heels until they faced The Sheik and Abdullah The Butcher in Tokyo. The two later faced Stan Hansen, Bruiser Brody, and Giant Baba in memorable feuds as well.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1985–1986) ===
Terry Funk made his World Wrestling Federation (WWF) debut in June 1985 after a brief run in the AWA. In his televised debut on &quot;Championship Wrestling&quot;, he not only beat Aldo Marino, but he also beat on ring announcer Mel Phillips. Funk attacked Phillips, after Phillips made the mistake of putting on Funk&#x27;s cowboy hat. Funk also had a gimmick of carrying a branding iron with him to ringside and using it to &quot;brand&quot; his fallen opponents. The attack on Phillips led to a feud with Junkyard Dog. In the mid-1980s, Funk teamed with Dory (calling himself &quot;Hoss&quot; Funk) and Jimmy Jack Funk, a storyline &quot;brother.&quot; They were managed by Jimmy Hart. At the time, he had a heated rivalry with the Junkyard Dog which led to a match between Terry Funk and Hoss Funk and the team of Tito Santana and Junkyard Dog at WrestleMania 2. Terry also had a series of WWF title matches against Hulk Hogan. Funk left the WWF in April 1986.

=== World Championship Wrestling (1989–1990, 1994) ===

==== J-Tex Corporation; Funk&#x27;s Grill (1989–1990) ====
Funk joined World Championship Wrestling in 1989 and became part of the J-Tex Corporation. He began feuding with Ric Flair, who had defeated Ricky Steamboat at WrestleWar for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Funk, who was one of three judges for the main event, challenged Flair to a title match. Flair refused, saying that Funk was &quot;spending time in Hollywood&quot; instead of focusing on wrestling. Funk then attacked, piledriving Flair on a ringside table. This put the champion, Flair, out of action until the Great American Bash in July 1989 where he faced Funk. Flair won the match by reversing a small package into one of his own, but shortly after was attacked by Gary Hart and The Great Muta. Sting came to aid Flair and the two brawled with Funk and Muta to close the show. At &quot;Clash of the Champions VIII&quot; in September 1989, Flair and Sting defeated Muta and Dick Slater. After the match, Funk used a plastic shopping bag to suffocate Flair. At Halloween Havoc in October 1989, Funk (who entered the ring to Ennio Morricone&#x27;s &quot;Man With a Harmonica&quot;) and The Great Muta lost to Flair and Sting in a Thunderdome match. The feud then culminated in an &quot;I Quit&quot; match between Funk and Flair at &quot;Clash of the Champions IX&quot; in November 1989, which Funk lost after yelling &quot;Yes, I quit!&quot; after Flair put on the figure four leglock. After losing, Funk shook Flair&#x27;s hand, and was attacked by Gary Hart&#x27;s stable. This match received a 5-star rating from Dave Meltzer.

Soon after he became a color commentator and the host of his own segment, Funk&#x27;s Grill, on &quot;NWA Power Hour&quot; where a tuxedo-clad Funk would amiably interview the top stars of WCW, both face and heel. This did not last long and he left soon after for the USWA.

==== Stud Stable (1994) ====
In May 1994, Funk reappeared in WCW. He wrestled Tully Blanchard to a double disqualification at Slamboree 1994 and later that night, he became a member of Colonel Robert Parker&#x27;s Stud Stable. Along with Bunkhouse Buck, Arn Anderson and Meng, the stable would focus their energies on Dusty and Dustin Rhodes, as well as The Nasty Boys, culminating in a War Games match at Fall Brawl. Funk left WCW once more in October 1994.

=== International Wrestling Association of Japan (1994–1995)===
In 1994, Funk joined the fledgling International Wrestling Association of Japan promotion. Funk would go on to be a participant in IWA&#x27;s most famous event the King of the Death Match Tournament, held on August 20, 1995, in Kawasaki. Funk would first defeat Leatherface and Tiger Jeet Singh in extreme-style matches which featured barbed wire covered boards, glass, and chains before moving on to the finals of the tournament. In the finals, Funk was defeated by protégé Cactus Jack, later known by US audiences as Mick Foley, in a No Ropes Barbed Wire Exploding Barbed Wire Boards &amp; Exploding Ring Time Bomb Death Match. Terry would also participate in several other deathmatches throughout 1995.

=== Eastern/Extreme Championship Wrestling (1993–1997)===
Later in Funk&#x27;s career, his style changed from wrestling traditional southern style wrestling matches to the more violent style of hardcore wrestling. In 1993, after a special appearance against Blanchard at World Championship Wrestling&#x27;s Slamboree, Funk promised to help the fledgling Eastern Championship Wrestling (later renamed Extreme Championship Wrestling or ECW) by lending his talent and notoriety to the promotion. On July 16, Terry and Dory Funk lost a barbed wire match against The Public Enemy. Funk maintained a regular schedule of wrestling for ECW in its early days while also competing in Japan. He had many feuds and wrestled programs with wrestlers such as Cactus Jack, &quot;The Franchise&quot; Shane Douglas, The Sandman, Sabu, and Terry&#x27;s own protege, Tommy Dreamer.

Funk further elevated ECW by headlining their first pay-per-view, Barely Legal on April 13, 1997, winning the ECW World Heavyweight Championship from Raven. Earlier in the night, he defeated The Sandman and Stevie Richards in a Triple Threat match, thus earning him the match with Raven. Funk went on to successfully defend the title in bouts at Chapter 2, The Buffalo Invasion, Wrestlepalooza, and Heat Wave. He was ultimately defeated for the title by Sabu in a barbed wire match at Born to be Wired in August 1997, in which the ropes of the ring were taken down and replaced with barbed wire. Both men had to be cut out of the wires at the end of the match. Sabu had his biceps visibly torn open by the barbed wire – as a result, the wound was taped up and the match continued.

In September 1997, a show was held in Funk&#x27;s hometown of Amarillo. It was called &quot;Terry Funk&#x27;s WrestleFest&quot; and was both his own show and a celebration of the careers of Terry, his father, and his brother. Terry lost to then-WWF Champion Bret Hart in the main event, a non-title match. Beforehand, ECW owner Paul Heyman presented Terry with a belt, paid for through a collection taken up by wrestlers on the ECW roster, that declared him the &quot;Lifetime ECW World Heavyweight Champion&quot;.

=== Return to WWF (1997–1998)===
Funk appeared in the 1997 Royal Rumble match appearing at number 24 and lasting fifteen minutes and eighteen seconds before being eliminated by Mankind. Funk then returned to ECW before his retirement.
Funk&#x27;s retirement lasted just 11 days before he returned to the ring. After wrestling in Japan with Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling and on the United States independent circuit (most notably a bout with Rik Ratchet that drew many fans on the east coast), Funk rejoined the World Wrestling Federation.

Funk made his return to the WWF on the December 29, 1997, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; as the masked &quot;Chainsaw Charlie&quot; (although his true identity was soon acknowledged by the announcers), teaming with Mick Foley, who was wrestling under his Cactus Jack persona. Charlie and Jack began feuding with the New Age Outlaws, who defeated them by disqualification on the January 26, 1998 episode of &quot;Raw.&quot;

The following week on &quot;Raw&quot;, Charlie and Jack had a match against each other, with the match ending in a no contest after the New Age Outlaws attacked both men, placing them both in a dumpster and then pushing it off the stage. At No Way Out of Texas: In Your House, Charlie and Jack teamed with Stone Cold Steve Austin and Owen Hart, defeating the team of Triple H, Savio Vega and the New Age Outlaws. At WrestleMania XIV, Charlie and Jack defeated the New Age Outlaws in a dumpster match to win the WWF Tag Team Championship. The following night, on the March 30 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Charlie and Jack lost the titles back to the New Age Outlaws in a cage match.

On the April 13 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Funk began wrestling as himself and formed a tag team with 2 Cold Scorpio. The team was short lived but did defeat the likes of the Quebecers and the Midnight Express. On the May 4 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Funk was defeated by Foley in a falls count anywhere match. On the June 1 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Funk was defeated by Mark Henry in a King of the Ring qualifying match. During the King of the Ring pay-per-view, Funk interfered in the Mankind vs. The Undertaker Hell in a Cell match, receiving a chokeslam from The Undertaker.

Funk then formed a short lived tag team with Justin Bradshaw, which defeated Too Much on the July 25 episode of &quot;WWF Shotgun Saturday Night&quot;. At Fully Loaded: In Your House, Funk and Bradshaw were defeated by Faarooq and 2 Cold Scorpio, with Bradshaw attacking Funk after the match. Funk left the WWF once again the following month.

=== Return to ECW (1998–1999)===
At ECW November to Remember, Funk was believed to have been Tommy Dreamer&#x27;s mystery partner against Justin Credible and Jack Victory. However, it turned out to be Jake Roberts. An enraged Funk attacked Dreamer at every opportunity in late 1998 and early 1999, came down ill before they could have a match, and &quot;retired&quot; yet again in mid-1999.

===Return to WCW (2000–2001)===
Funk returned to World Championship Wrestling in January 2000 after an absence of five years, being named the WCW Commissioner by WCW President Bill Bush. Shortly after arriving, Funk formed a stable dubbed the &quot;Old Age Outlaws&quot; (a play on the New Age Outlaws) alongside Arn Anderson, Larry Zbyszko, and Paul Orndorff to oppose the New World Order (nWo). His first match upon returning saw him wrestle nWo member Bret Hart to a no contest in a hardcore match that aired on &quot;WCW Thunder&quot;. At Souled Out on January 16, Funk faced nWo leader Kevin Nash in a hardcore match with the stipulation that if Funk won, the nWo would disband, but if Nash won, he would replace Funk as WCW Commissioner. The match was won by Nash.

Funk went on to feud with Ric Flair, including losing to Flair&#x27;s son David in an &quot;I Quit&quot; match on &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot;. The feud culminated in a Texas death match at SuperBrawl in February 2000 that was won by Flair. Funk then went on to feud with Dustin Rhodes, losing to Rhodes in a bullrope &quot;I Quit&quot; match at Uncensored in March 2000.

In April 2000, Funk began competing in WCW&#x27;s hardcore division. At Spring Stampede later that month he defeated Norman Smiley to win the vacant WCW Hardcore Championship. At Slamboree, Funk defeated Smiley and Ralphus to successfully defend the title. He lost the title to Shane Douglas the following month, but regained it several days later. His second reign ended in June 2000 when he lost to Eric Bischoff. In September 2000, Funk defeated Lance Storm for the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship at a house show in Amarillo, Texas. He lost the title back to Storm the following day. In December 2000 at Starrcade, Funk defeated Crowbar to win the WCW Hardcore Championship for a record third time.

Vicky died on March 29, 2019. Funk was close friends with NFL player John Ayers and Hollywood actor Sylvester Stallone. On September 12, 2016, Funk underwent surgery for an inguinal hernia, and was supposed to be resting and in bed for a couple of weeks, but chose to attend Tommy Dreamer&#x27;s House of Hardcore shows.

In June 2021, fellow wrestling legend Don Muraco reported Funk was diagnosed as living with dementia and was living in an assisted living facility. On December 29, 2021, Ric Flair announced on his podcast with Mark Madden that Funk had returned home and was doing well.

<text>Þingvallavatn (, ), anglicised as Thingvallavatn, is a rift valley lake in southwestern Iceland. With a surface of 84 km2 it is the largest natural lake in Iceland. Its greatest depth is 114 m. At the northern shore of the lake, at Þingvellir (after which the lake is named), the Alþingi, the national parliament, was founded in the year 930, and held its sessions there until 1799 and still as of today the name Alþingi Íslendinga is carried by the parliament of Iceland.

The lake lies partially within Þingvellir National Park. The volcanic origin of the islands in the lake is clearly visible. The cracks and faults around it, of which the Almannagjá ravine is the largest, is where the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates meet. Silfra fissure is a popular scuba and snorkeling site. The only outflow from lake Þingvallavatn is the river Sog.

One of the noted features of the lake is the presence of four morphs of the Arctic charr.

<text>Lincoln Memorial Bridge is a reinforced concrete, open-spandrel deck arch bridge built carrying U.S. Route 50 Business over the Wabash River between Vincennes, Indiana and Lawrence County, Illinois. It is said to mark the point where Abraham Lincoln crossed the Wabash River on his way to Illinois in 1830, and a sculptural installation, the Lincoln Trail State Memorial, marks the western end of the bridge.
==Lincoln Memorial Bridge Pylons==
The Lincoln Memorial Bridge Pylons are a public artwork by French artist Raoul Josset, located on the Lincoln Memorial Bridge on U.S. Route 50 on the grounds of the George Rogers Clark National Historical Park. The pylons feature two full-length reliefs of Native American chiefs, Tecumseh and his younger brother The Prophet. The two pylons are made of granite and the figures are on the front faces of the pylons at the entrance to the bridge. The southern figure is dressed in ceremonial regalia with a club in his right hand. The northern figure is also dressed in similar regalia and holds a blanket. The south side of the proper right relief is signed by the artist: RAOUL/JOSSET/SC. They stand at 9.38 × 2.03 × 1.08 ft (286 cm × 62 × 33) and were installed in 1936.

<text>Winifred &quot;Fred&quot; Burkle is a fictional character created by Joss Whedon and introduced by Shawn Ryan and Mere Smith on the television series &quot;Angel&quot;. The character is portrayed by Amy Acker.

==Biography==

===Character history===
Fred was born in San Antonio, Texas to Roger and Patricia &quot;Trish&quot; Burkle. When she finished college, she moved to Los Angeles for graduate school at UCLA. Originally majoring in history, Fred took a physics class with Professor Seidel, which inspired her to take another path. Around this time, she began working at Stewart Brunell Public Library. In 1996, while shelving a demon language book, a curious Fred recited the text out loud and was accidentally sucked into a dimensional portal to Pylea (her future friend Lorne was sucked into the same portal on his side and ended up in Los Angeles). It was later discovered that the portal was actually opened by Fred&#x27;s jealous college professor, Professor Seidel, who had sent every promising student to it, essentially sending them to their death. Fred was the only one of at least six to return (cf. &quot;Supersymmetry&quot;). In high school or college, Fred was a marijuana user as shown in the episode &quot;Spin the Bottle&quot;. In that episode, she asks Wesley and &quot;Liam&quot; for weed and was also revealed to have had to take a personality disorder test and to be something of a conspiracy theorist.

===Angel Investigations===
For five years, Fred spent an arduous life as a &quot;cow&quot;, the Pylean word for humans who are kept as slaves, and then as a fugitive. The harsh life of solitude and serfdom took a serious toll on her social skills, as well as her mental health; when Angel meets Fred, she is curled up in a cave, scribbling on the already-covered walls, having seemingly convinced herself that her previous life in L.A. had not been real.

It was revealed that Fred had once been forced to wear an explosive shock collar. Fred&#x27;s salvation comes when Angel and his crew arrive in Pylea to find Cordelia Chase, who had become trapped there. It is notable that when Angel&#x27;s demon came fully to the fore, it attacked just about everyone &quot;but&quot; Fred – including Gunn and Wesley. Despite this shocking display of violence, Angel never seemed to scare Fred, and even at his most demonic, he never attacked her. In fact, her presence seemed to have a calming effect on him.

When Pylea is liberated, Fred accompanies Angel and the rest of the gang back to Los Angeles and stays in the Hyperion Hotel to re-adjust to life on Earth and regain her mental stability. Despite several traumatic instances, such as being held hostage by Gunn&#x27;s old vampire-hunting crew, she adjusts quite well to &quot;normal&quot; life.

Her knowledge of physics and mathematics make her an excellent asset when researching and developing strategies. Fred quickly develops a romantic relationship with Gunn, which lasts roughly one year. She is also the object of affection of Wesley Wyndam-Pryce, who attempts to step aside after Gunn and Fred started dating, but is still drawn to her. Near the end of her relationship with Gunn, Fred and Wesley share a kiss, but after discovering that Wesley had been in a relationship – albeit a rather complex one – with Lilah Morgan, her feelings for Wesley cool considerably.

Eventually, Fred discovers that it was actually her former professor&#x27;s fault that she had been trapped in Pylea, and indeed, Professor Seidel had attempted to trap her in another world yet again. Furious, she plots to kill him with Wesley&#x27;s help. Gunn feels that such a brutal act, even against Seidel, will ultimately destroy her. As a result, in a battle where she is trying to trap him in a hell dimension, Gunn snaps Seidel&#x27;s neck himself and drops the body into the portal. Unfortunately, this causes a rift between Fred and Gunn, and ultimately ends their relationship.

===Wolfram &amp; Hart===
However, everything changes for Fred when she and the rest of Angel&#x27;s crew join Wolfram &amp; Hart. (While Angel accepts a suite of rooms at Wolfram &amp; Hart as his new home, Fred, and maybe others of the inner circle, find a home in the Los Angeles area: hers is at 511 Windward Circle. This seems to be forgotten with the advent of Illyria.) Her memory is altered by a spell cast in season 4&#x27;s last episode, &quot;Home&quot;, and it is unclear how much of the events of seasons 3 and 4 she remembers differently or at all (everything specific to Angel&#x27;s son Connor is definitely lost). Fred receives her own laboratory and becomes the head of Wolfram &amp; Hart&#x27;s Science Division. She is a major asset to the team; Angel consistently relies on her department to quickly and efficiently solve problems. After going on a few dates with co-worker Knox, Fred begins to have feelings for Wesley again. The pair are together for about a week, but the couple&#x27;s happiness is not to last.

A mysterious sarcophagus, allowed through customs by a signature from Gunn, appears in the lab. As Fred examines it, a hole opens in the cover and a breath of wind blows into her face. It turns out that the sarcophagus is a holding cell for one of the original, pure-breed demons known as the Old Ones, which is predestined to rise again. The air Fred inhales is actually Illyria&#x27;s essence, which immediately begins a parasitic existence in her body, eating away at it and making her a shell. Worse still, Knox had worshipped Illyria for years and worked at Wolfram &amp; Hart for the sole purpose of bringing the demon back. Because of his affections for Fred, he chose her as the only one &quot;worthy&quot; to house his god.

As Angel and Spike travel to England to find a cure, Wesley remains in Fred&#x27;s bedroom with her, comforting her as she fights bravely, but slowly begins to die. Angel learns that the only way to save Fred would be to draw Illyria back to the Deeper Well in England by using her sarcophagus as a beacon. However, thousands of others would die as Illyria&#x27;s essence cut across the world back to the Well. Thus, Angel and Spike are forced to do nothing, deciding that Fred would not want this.

As she lies dying, Fred&#x27;s mind begins to give way. Nearing the end, she panics, stating that Feigenbaum, a stuffed rabbit named for mathematical physicist Mitchell Feigenbaum who studied chaos theory, should be there. When Wesley asks her who Feigenbaum is, Fred replies that she doesn&#x27;t know. Cradling her in his arms, Wesley stays with Fred until the moment she dies, after which her body is taken over by Illyria. &quot;Wesley, why can&#x27;t I stay?&quot; are Fred&#x27;s last words.

According to Dr. Sparrow, Fred&#x27;s soul is consumed by the fires of resurrection, which Wesley interprets upon overhearing as soul destruction, seemingly making it impossible for her to return from the dead or enjoy an afterlife, although the specifics of this process are not elaborated. Later, though, Illyria states that there are remnants of Fred in the form of her memories, which are a source of confusion for Illyria. On occasion, Illyria takes on the appearance of Fred in order to go about unnoticed and to deal with Fred&#x27;s parents. When Wesley dies, Illyria takes on Fred&#x27;s form to comfort him and because she has Fred&#x27;s form, the evil warlock Cyvus Vail underestimates her and she easily kills him.

Had &quot;Angel&quot; gotten a sixth season, Joss Whedon originally intended for Fred and Illyria to either be split in two as revealed by Amy Acker in an interview: &quot;As I’m playing this new character now, it was just some stuff that he was going to do with her and bringing Fred back and getting to work with both characters&quot;, or for Illyria to take on more and more of Fred&#x27;s memories.

=== After the Fall ===
(This section does not describe the character in the television series, but rather a character from a series of books published after the series ended.)

Fred seemingly reappears in the fifth, sixth and ninth issues of &quot;&quot;, manifesting as a transformation of Illyria into not just the physical appearance of Fred, but also her personality. This happens a first time upon the initial fusion of Hell and L.A. and then a second time upon a reunion of Illyria and Wesley. Issue #9 reveals that the Illyria and Fred essences have been struggling for dominance over their shared body, and that Spike has been trying to suppress Fred&#x27;s manifestations (even going so far as to ask Angel for help), and admits that he would have kept Illyria away from the battle had he known Wesley was going to be present. It is later revealed in &quot;Spike: After the Fall&quot; that seeing someone Fred cared for triggers the change, while dangerous situations transform her back into Illyria. However, issue #14 explains that the Fred manifestations were just Illyria&#x27;s interpretation of Fred; with these remnants lost, Illyria reverts to her true form. Later the telepath Betta George puts Wesley and Spike&#x27;s memories (of Fred) into Illyria&#x27;s brain to make her question her own actions. Illyria later tries to behave in such a way as Fred would have wanted, and has taken on more of her characteristics (for example, in the &quot;After the Fall Epilogue&quot; she has scrawled on the walls of her rooms as Fred did, albeit listing methods of killing).

After the Senior Partners rewind time after Angel is killed by Gunn, Angel renames a wing of the L.A. public library the &quot;Burkle Wyndam-Pryce Wing&quot; in honor of Fred and Wesley.

=== &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; Season Nine ===

In &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; Season Nine, Illyria is drained of her mystical energy and powers and is stuck in the physical appearance of Fred. Illyria believes she should be dead and something inside her must be keeping her alive, and is able to scientifically read graphs to determine why Dawn Summers is dying. Illyria expresses human compassion for Severin, the person who drained her and who is now about to explode with power. Illyria stays with Severin as he uses his powers to restore magic to the world which also vaporizes himself and Illyria. Scott Allie later stated it was intentionally left open to interpretation as to whether Fred was influencing Illyria.

Buffy later expresses regret to her noble companion Eldre Koh on the need to destroy Illyria. Koh casts doubt on Buffy&#x27;s knowledge of the elder ones.

=== Resurrection ===

Fred is later discovered alive on the streets of London by Angel. It transpires that, when magic was restored, many aspects of the supernatural were &quot;reset&quot;, resulting in the resurrection of both Fred and Illyria, sharing the same body. Fred and Illyria thereafter remain with Angel for the remainder of Season 10 and throughout &quot;Angel&quot; Season 11.

==Powers and abilities==
Fred is a normal human woman with no supernatural abilities; her brilliant mathematical mind, immense knowledge of quantum physics and science, and a natural ability in designing inventions make her an important asset of Angel&#x27;s team; Wesley once says, while addressing most of Angel&#x27;s crew, &quot;She&#x27;s smarter than all of us put together&quot;. Due to spending so many years in Pylea, she also has a limited knowledge of the Pylean language and culture.

During this time, Fred also acquires some reasonably good fighting skills, mainly with weapons such as stakes, guns, swords, knives, etc. Later, when Jasmine takes over Los Angeles, she&#x27;s forced to face down all of Los Angeles on her own, and it is shown that she is also able to hold her own unarmed, effortlessly taking out a few armed Jasminites, including one armed SWAT member.

It&#x27;s seen in season 3 that she likes plants, actually talking to them during her period of mild insanity. In the episode &quot;Spin the Bottle,&quot; while she&#x27;s under the effect of a magical spell, Fred is briefly fascinated with a fern. After undergoing the transformation to Illyria, she can talk to plants while at full power.

Fred is also portrayed as an innocent, unassuming young woman, which often leads people to underestimate her. On many occasions, she has used this to her advantage, such as shocking Connor with a stun gun and knocking out a suspicious lab assistant at Wolfram &amp; Hart or in the third season in &quot;That Old Gang of Mine&quot; when she tricks Gunn&#x27;s old gang into thinking she was going to kill Angel. Also, she shows signs of great inner strength and an innate ability to survive on her own despite overwhelming circumstances. This is shown in season 4 as she attempts to flee from Jasmine&#x27;s followers, and earlier with her experiences in Pylea.

<text>Þórisvatn (; sometimes anglicized to Thorisvatn) is the largest lake of Iceland, situated at the south end of the Sprengisandur plateau within the highlands of Iceland.

It is a reservoir with a surface area of about and is fed by the river Þjórsá, which comes down from the glacier Hofsjökull. On its southern end, Þórisvatn is used to generate electricity at a power station. It is like other Icelandic lakes, which are mostly glacial lakes or volcanic lakes.

The lake grew from about 70 km2 to 86 km2 with the construction of the power station and was previously only the second largest lake in the country.

<text>The Arlington Memorial Bridge, often shortened to Memorial Bridge, is a Neoclassical masonry, steel, and stone arch bridge with a central bascule (or drawbridge) that crosses the Potomac River in Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States. First proposed in 1886, the bridge went unbuilt for decades thanks to political quarrels over whether the bridge should be a memorial, and to whom or what. Traffic problems associated with the dedication of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in November 1921 and the desire to build a bridge in time for the bicentennial of the birth of George Washington led to its construction in 1932.

Designed by the architectural firm McKim, Mead, and White, decorated with monumental statues depicting valor and sacrifice by sculptor Leo Friedlander, and cast by Ferdinando Marinelli Artistic Foundry of Florence, Italy, Arlington Memorial Bridge defines the western end of the National Mall. The bridge&#x27;s draw span was permanently closed in 1961 and replaced in 2018 by one that does not open.
==Early attempts to build a bridge==

===Early memorial bridge proposals===
Congress first proposed a bridge at the site of the current structure on May 24, 1886. The resolution required that the United States Department of War study the feasibility of a bridge at the site, and a wide design was proposed later that year. The following year, the War Department suggested a &quot;Lincoln-Grant Memorial Bridge&quot;. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; supported the idea of naming the bridge after both Robert E. Lee and Grant. Congress again passed a resolution requesting another design, and in late 1887 the department proposed a &quot;General Ulysses S. Grant Memorial Bridge&quot;. The new bridge would be a suspension bridge high, with of clearance below it. Designs for the bridge at this time included a bare steel truss bridge, a low masonry arch bridge, and a Romanesque Revival structure by Paul J. Pelz with two massive central towers, two barbicans on each end, and exuberant ornamentation. Senator John W. Daniel sponsored legislation in 1897 funding a survey of the bedrock in the Potomac River. Congress approved the legislation the same year, and the United States Army Corps of Engineers began the survey in July. The survey was delivered in March 1898.

Because the bridge was conceived as a memorial to Grant, Congress repeatedly blocked funding for the bridge. But after the Corps&#x27; survey was complete, Congress authorized the Secretary of War to expend $5,000 ($ in dollars) on a bridge design competition. To help improve the prospects for a bridge, a &quot;National Memorial Bridge Association&quot; was formed. In July, four prominent bridge engineers from New York City — George S. Morrison, Leffert L. Buck, William H. Burr, and William R. Hutton — were invited to submit designs for a memorial bridge to honor American war dead. A five-member board appointed by the Secretary of War selected a design by William H. Burr and architect Edward P. Casey (designer of the Taft Bridge). Their design, based on the 1887 winning plan, called for a drawbridge made of steel and stone with 36 arches. A &quot;classical&quot; tower sat over each end of the draw span, on top of which would stand bronze statues of Victory. Statues of famous generals and statesmen (in either bronze or granite) would line both sides of the bridge.

Senator George F. Hoar blocked the bridge from being built in June 1900 because he opposed the design. The National Memorial Bridge Association began pushing again for a bridge in October 1900, and commissioned Connecticut architect George Keller to design plans. Keller&#x27;s design went on display in Washington in November. Contrary to almost all previous designs, his bridge was low to the water and eliminated a draw span. His design featured a monumental Romanesque Revival arch for the D.C. approaches and a memorial column celebrating the Union on the Virginia side, both to be placed in traffic circles. Keller&#x27;s design was published in architectural magazines, and by 1901 was widely seen as the appropriate design for the bridge.

In 1901, the American Institute of Architects proposed that the bridge extend New York Avenue NW (which then ended at 23rd Street NW) over the Potomac to Arlington National Cemetery. But once more, Congress did not act.

===McMillan Plan proposal===

In 1900, the U.S. Senate created the Senate Park Commission to reconcile competing visions for the development of Washington, D.C., and especially the National Mall and nearby areas. Popularly known as the McMillan Commission after its chairman, Senator James McMillan of Michigan, the commission issued its report (commonly referred to as the &quot;McMillan Plan&quot;) on January 15, 1902.

The McMillan Plan proposed siting a major new bridge and memorial at the western end of the National Mall, an area also known as West Potomac Park. Almost none of the National Mall west of the Washington Monument grounds and below Constitution Avenue NW existed prior to 1882. After terrible flooding inundated much of downtown Washington, D.C., in 1881, Congress ordered the Army Corps of Engineers to dredge a deep channel in the Potomac and use the material to fill in the Potomac shoreline (creating the current banks of the river) and raise this and much of the land near the White House and along Pennsylvania Avenue NW by nearly to prevent future flooding. This &quot;reclaimed land&quot; — which included West Potomac Park, East Potomac Park, the Tidal Basin — was largely complete by 1890, and designated Potomac Park by Congress in 1897. Congress first appropriated money for the beautification of the reclaimed land in 1902, which led to the planting of sod, bushes, and trees; grading and paving of sidewalks, bridle paths, and driveways; and the installation of water, drainage, and sewage pipes.

Although Congress did not formally adopt the McMillan Plan, it began to implement it piecemeal over the next several years. In 1910, Congress enacted legislation establishing the United States Commission of Fine Arts, a body of federally-appointed architects, landscape architects, and others who began to formally push for construction of the bridge envisioned by the McMillan Plan. On March 4, 1913, Congress enacted the Public Buildings Act which, among other things, created and funded an Arlington Memorial Bridge Commission whose purpose was to settle on a design for the bridge and report back to Congress. Its members included the President of the United States, President of the Senate, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the chairs of the committees on public grounds and buildings of the House and Senate (or their designees). But Congress appropriated no money for the commission&#x27;s operation due to the onset of World War I, and it remained inactive.

==Construction: 1922–1932==

On November 11, 1921, President Warren G. Harding traveled to the dedication ceremony for the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery. He became caught in a three-hour traffic jam because Highway Bridge (on which he traveled) could not handle the traffic. Resolving to prevent that from happening again, Harding sought an appropriation of $25,000 in 1922 to fund the work of the bridge commission. Congress approved his request on June 12, 1922.

Initially, the Arlington Memorial Bridge Commission proposed a site for the bridge at the New York Avenue site, upstream from its current position. But the Commission of Fine Arts (CFA), which had legislative authority to approve the siting and design of memorials, opposed the plan. With President Harding presiding, the Arlington Memorial Bridge Commission held a joint meeting with Vice President Calvin Coolidge and the Commission of Fine Arts on December 18, 1922, at which time it was unanimously decided to adhere to the McMillan Plan and site the bridge on a line of sight between the Lincoln Memorial and Arlington House in Arlington National Cemetery. The parties also agreed to seek to construct a low (rather than monumental) bridge with a bascule (drawbridge) in the center to permit ship traffic to reach the Georgetown waterfront.

===Bridge design considerations===

The bridge commission asked the Commission of Fine Arts whether there should be an open design competition (as in the past) or whether the bridge commission should pick a designer itself. The CFA recommended a direct selection, and provided the names of three firms: Charles A. Platt, who designed the Freer Gallery of Art; Paul Philippe Cret, who designed the Pan-American Union Building; and the firm of McKim, Mead and White. The bridge commission chose a direct selection, and picked the firm of McKim, Mead and White on April 4, 1923. Architect William Mitchell Kendall was the lead designer.

Members of the D.C. business community immediately pressed for resolution on whether the bridge would have a draw span. Merchants in Georgetown wanted their small harbor to be reachable by large ships. On February 17, 1923, Colonel C.O. Sherrill of the Army Corps of Engineers stated that the Corps would only approve a bridge with a draw span.

Kendall&#x27;s first design, submitted to the CFA in May 1923, was generally well received. His plan envisioned a low, Neoclassical arch bridge. Two statues stood atop each pier on both sides of the bridge. The D.C. approaches consisted of a traffic circle around the Lincoln Memorial linked to the Potomac River by a plaza and monumental steps (the &quot;watergate&quot;). Two memorial columns were placed in this plaza. On the Columbia Island landing, Kendall envisioned a gigantic crossarm circumscribed by a grassy ellipse, with traffic circles at the terminus of the north and south arms. The traffic circles would accommodate Lee Highway and the Mt. Vernon Memorial Parkway. Within the ellipse were placed two tall memorial columns. Two circular Greek Revival temples were planned for the western shoreline. The commission was especially pleased that Kendall had the Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway linked to the traffic circle around the Lincoln Memorial rather than passing beneath the bridge via an arch. (Kendall had, in fact, intended to pass it through one of the bridge&#x27;s arches but forgot to make the change.) However, CFA members asked that he consider widening the bridge to from the proposed . The CFA also discussed at length its long-standing proposal for a major traffic circle on Columbia Island, within which would be placed a memorial to Robert E. Lee. There was also concern whether enough space had been allotted to permit the Mount Vernon Memorial Parkway, Lee Highway, and Memorial Drive (which was planned to cross the Boundary Channel via the Boundary Channel Bridge into Virginia and link with the main gate to Arlington National Cemetery). When the CFA gave its preliminary approval to the bridge design (but withheld a resolution on the approaches), models of the bridge went on public display in February 1924.

===Legislative approval===

A bill authorizing construction of Arlington Memorial Bridge was introduced in the U.S. Senate on April 25, 1924, by Senator Bert M. Fernald. The Senate Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds reported out the bill in mid-May. But the legislation languished. With Congress due to adjourn on March 4, 1925, the Senate finally passed the bridge bill on December 30, 1924. Senator William Borah made a motion to reconsider the bill in late January 1925, Borah&#x27;s motion did not ask the House to return the Senate-passed bill, so his motion would not affect the bill&#x27;s passage either way.

The bridge authorization faced a far more difficult time in the U.S. House of Representatives. The House Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds speedily approved the bill and reported it on January 27, 1925, less than a month after receiving it from the Senate. But with a legislative logjam in the House and only about 30 days left in the legislative session, the bill&#x27;s chances for approval seemed slim. Floor managers helping to guide the bill through the final approval process tried to bring the bill up for approval on January 30, believing they had the necessary two-thirds majority to suspend the rules to allow the bill to be considered. Instead, the House voted to suspend the legislative calendar — blocking all legislative except for appropriations bills.

Floor managers won a major victory, however, when the House quickly passed the appropriations legislation and allowed the bridge bill to be considered on February 18. There was significant opposition to the bill on the House floor. Many Democrats opposed the bill, and several Republicans felt it went against President Calvin Coolidge&#x27;s budgetary restraint program. Many members of Congress received feedback from their constituents, who did not want their tax dollars to pay for a bridge in the District of Columbia. Representative Louis C. Cramton offered an amendment to the District of Columbia pay an &quot;equitable amount&quot; of the bridge&#x27;s cost. (The amount was to be established by Congress at a future date.) His amendment passed by a vote of 103–89. Amendments to make the city pay 60 percent of the cost, to make the state of Virginia pay half the cost, and require the Army Corps of Engineers to build the bridge were defeated. Finally, the House approved the Arlington Memorial Bridge bill by a vote of 204–125.

The Senate agreed to the House amendments on February 20, and President Coolidge signed it into law on February 24, 1925. In 1926 Comptroller General John R. McCarl voided contracts for the construction of the $12.5 million bridge because they called for the hiring of a general contractor and not specific individuals, as he believed the law required. In 1927, Congress changed the law so the contracts could proceed.

===Bridge construction===
The Arlington Memorial Bridge Commission oversaw the design and construction of the bridge. Arlington Memorial Bridge informally opened on January 16, 1932. The dedication ceremony was headed by President Herbert Hoover who became the first person to drive across it, leading a small party of 12 cars down the George Washington Parkway to Mt. Vernon as a kick-off for Washington&#x27;s 200th birthday celebration. Due to a lack of lights, ongoing construction and poor connections on the Virginia side, the bridge and highway were only open during daylight hours on Saturday and Sunday. Weekend-only operations ended on March 16, 1932. Though temporary lights were added in time for the 200th birthday, the bridge wasn&#x27;t opened for day and night use until both the bridge and highway were officially illuminated on May 6, 1932.

Designed by architectural firm McKim, Mead, and White, the neoclassical bridge is long. The bridge cost $7.25 million to build, of which $900,000 was attributed to the center draw span.
Construction of the Virginia approaches to the bridge took six years. The National Capital Parks Commission (NCPC) had authority to plan and approve regional transportation plans, and wanted the Virginia approaches to the bridge to be new roads. This would help stimulate housing and economic growth in Arlington County. The state of Virginia (which would provide some of the funding for the approaches) and Arlington County officials wrestled with the problems of cost and development. New roads and approaches would be the most costly (largely due to the need to obtain rights-of-way), a major consideration in the Great Depression. Yet, connecting the bridge to existing roadways would not stimulate development. The choice of a route also had political considerations, as neighborhoods vied to be the recipient of this economic stimulus. The construction of Lee Boulevard (now known as Arlington Boulevard) and Washington Boulevard eastward both provided an opportunity for economic stimulus. The state and county eventually agreed to push Lee Boulevard north around Arlington National Cemetery. When this project ran into rights-of-way problems, the state and county constructed Washington Boulevard south around the cemetery. When the Lee Boulevard problems were resolved, and with the addition of large amounts of new federal dollars, the state and county resumed construction of the Lee Boulevard approaches. The Lee Boulevard approach finally opened in October 1938. The construction of The Pentagon in 1941 and extensive war-related building south of the cemetery in 1942 led the federal government to approve a second connection by extending Washington Boulevard past Arlington National Cemetery and over Boundary Channel as well.

At the time it opened, the Arlington Memorial Bridge bascule span was the longest, heaviest (), and fastest-opening bascule span in the world.

==About the bridge==
The bridge&#x27;s northeastern approaches frame, in part, the Lincoln Memorial, while the bridge&#x27;s southwestern landing is on Columbia Island. The northeastern end of the bridge marks the western edge of the National Mall. The southwestern end connects with Memorial Drive, which crosses the Boundary Channel Bridge into Virginia and travels to Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington County.

In 2011, the bridge carried about 54,000 vehicles a day.

===Architecture===
The northeastern entrance to the Arlington Memorial Bridge features &quot;The Arts of War&quot; sculptures, &quot;Sacrifice&quot; and &quot;Valor&quot;, which were completed by Leo Friedlander in 1951. One of which was cast by Ferdinando Marinelli Artistic Foundry of Florence, Italy. On the pylons of each pier of the bridge are large circular discs with eagles and fasces designed by sculptor Carl Paul Jennewein.

The closest Metro station to the bridge is Arlington Cemetery. The bridge connects, both literally and symbolically, the Lincoln Memorial and Arlington House, the former home of Civil War General Robert E. Lee. This placement was done intentionally to represent the reunification of the North and the South.

At the southwestern terminus on Columbia Island, the bridge and its connecting roadways connect with the George Washington Memorial Parkway, State Route 27 and State Route 110. At the northeastern terminus, the bridge and its connecting roadways connect with Constitution Avenue, Independence Avenue, the Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway, and the District of Columbia segment of Interstate 66.

A peculiarity of the traffic circle at the southwestern terminus is that traffic already in the circle must yield to traffic entering the circle — the opposite of the standard rule. During morning rush hour, a portion of the traffic circle is closed to prevent mergers that would otherwise tie up rush hour traffic.

The center portion of the bridge was originally a metal draw span, intended to allow large vessels to pass upriver to Georgetown. However, with the construction of the Theodore Roosevelt Bridge immediately upstream, which has no such provision, the draw mechanism was abandoned. It was opened for the last time on February 28, 1961. The bascule leaves were to be counterbalanced with scrap steel embedded in concrete, but during the Great Depression there was not enough scrap available for the project. A ship load of Swedish iron ore eventually provided the needed for the counterweights.

Arlington Memorial Bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 4, 1980.
==Renovation history==
The bridge was damaged during floods in March 1936 when water infiltrated and caused shorts in the bridge&#x27;s electrical equipment. Repairs were made in late 1938 and early 1939. The Electrical Underground Construction Co. of New York City received $9,245 to replace damaged electrical equipment and wiring, install new electrical conduits, and install two sump pumps. In October 1936, a gear and a crankshaft in the drawbridge broke. The bridge was closed for nine hours while crews rushed to repair the span, which was open and unable to permit traffic. The closing, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported, was the longest since the bridge opened.

Major maintenance and repair work on the bridge first occurred in 1939. The draw span was repainted, the bridge repaved, the west engine room heated, and the granite on the Virginia abutments repointed and cleaned. This led to complete six-hour closures on August 30, August 31, and September 1.

In 1945, the bridge closed for two hours while workers attended to a jammed draw span. The bridge closed again on the evening of August 2, 1947, and most of the day on August 3 while workers replaced a gear and shaft that kept the draw span from vibrating when crossed by traffic. The National Park Service (NPS) said it was the second-longest closing in the bridge&#x27;s history.

Major work occurred again in 1951. The granite blocks on the roadway surface were removed, and the bridged replaced with asphalt (a safer material) in a $207,000 repaving project. The work began on July 16, 1951. Several of the bridge&#x27;s six lanes were closed during the work week, and the entire bridge closed to traffic on weekends for four weeks in a row. The Corson and Gruman Co. performed the work. Minor repaving occurred again in July 1957.

Beginning in March 1964, at least one lane of the six-lane bridge was closed every day while repairs were made to the draw span. However, the bridge never fully closed.

Additional work on the bridge occurred in November 1976. The draw span was immobilized and sealed, and the approaches on both ends of the bridge repaired. Three lanes in the direction of heaviest traffic flow were kept open during rush hour, but only one lane in the opposite direction. At all other times, only one lane in each direction was open. These repairs lasted several weeks.

A major repair effort occurred in the summer of 1985. The work involved resurfacing the bridge and renovating some of its safety and other features. The $4.7 million construction project, which involved the closure of two lanes in each direction, was conducted by A.A. Beiro Construction Co. To help speed work, the company received a $4,000-a-day bonus for each day it finished ahead of schedule.

Work began the first week of April 1985 and ended September 25.

Preservation and repair work was performed on the bridge&#x27;s sidewalks in January 2011, which led to the closure of two lanes in each direction during daytime non-rush hours. The center lanes were closed for a few days in March 2012 for additional rehabilitation work. In June 2012, Cianbro Corp. oversaw an eight-week, $788,000 project to repair the bridge&#x27;s deck, restore granite curbs, and replace sidewalks at both approaches. At least one lane (and sometimes two) in each direction was closed in September, October, and November.

Despite these various projects, as of 2012 the bridge had never had a major overhaul. That year, a report by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) called for a complete overhaul of Arlington Memorial Bridge.

===2013 and 2015 inspections===

In February 2013, the FHWA launched a major inspection of the bridge&#x27;s deck. In April, National Park Service transportation division head Charles N. Borders II declared, &quot;The bridge ... is really at the end of, and beyond, its life cycle&quot;. The inspection was performed on April 24, 2013, by the Federal Lands Bridge Office, an arm of the FHWA. In its post-inspection report, the FHWA declared the bridge to be &quot;in poor condition overall due to continuing problems related to corrosion of the steel in the bascule span, deterioration of the concrete in the arch spans, and deterioration of the sidewalks and wearing surface.&quot; Among the problems noted in the report: moderate amounts of rusting were found on all the bridge&#x27;s load-bearing beams, there were moderate to widespread cracks in the reinforced concrete arch spans, metal flakes (or &quot;spalls&quot;) were coming off the steel beams on the road deck&#x27;s underside, and the drainage system was clogged in many places by debris or rust.

The &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported that without immediate action, truck and bus traffic over the bridge could be banned within five years. However, the park service had yet to budget for any repairs. Borders suggested that if Congress were to immediately fund the bridge&#x27;s complete overhaul, a two- to four-year reconstruction could begin as early as 2016. Repair options, which ranged from $125 million to $250 million in cost, included replacing the draw span with a fixed span and either closing the bridge completely for 40 to 100 days or keeping it partially open for four years.

In January 2015, the FHWA and NPS released an Arlington Memorial Bridge rehabilitation environmental assessment. It declared the bridge safe for all traffic, but warned that deterioration &quot;continues to progress at a rapid pace.&quot; The report cautioned that the bascule span was in particularly bad shape: &quot;Overall, the superstructure of the bascule span of Arlington Memorial Bridge is in fair to poor condition with areas of severe deterioration.&quot;

===2015 lane closures===
On May 15, 2015, the National Park Service suddenly closed one lane of the bridge for an indeterminate amount of time to conduct a critical corrosion inspection of the bridge.

The inspection uncovered corrosion to the bascule span. FHWA engineers determined that it was no longer safe for traffic to pass along the outer lanes of the bascule span; consequently, these two lanes were closed to traffic on the evening of May 28, 2015. Moreover, experts discovered that corrosion had so affected secondary support beams throughout the rest of the bridge that they imposed a limit of per vehicle, essentially barring most buses from crossing. Law enforcement agencies with jurisdiction over the bridge said they would begin stopping overweight vehicles to educate drivers about the new load limits, but would not ticket drivers for several weeks to give the &quot;education period&quot; time to work. Engineers also closed a strip of sidewalk on either side of the bridge out of structural concerns.

While the weight limit was indefinite (pending full rehabilitation of the bridge), NPS officials said the lanes and sidewalks would be closed six to nine months to allow workers to shore up the corroded beams and bascule span. The Department of Transportation issued a call for bids on May 26, 2015, and said a contractor will be chosen on June 18. The $5 million project is to cover repair or replacement of expansion joints, steel, structural concrete; drainage improvements; concrete sidewalk repair; restoration of the asphalt atop the bridge deck; and debris removal. Cianbro Corp. of Maine, which rehabbed the bridge a decade earlier, won a $2.5 million contract to begin the repairs, which were estimated to take about six months to complete. (The work was only to allow lane re-openings, but not remove the 10-ton weight limit.) Work was to begin on the bridge in late August or early September 2015.

In a July 2016 statement issued jointly by the offices of Senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine; Representatives Don Beyer, Gerald Connolly, and Barbara Comstock; and Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, the NPS planned to repair the bridge in two phases. The first phase, which addressed the bridge&#x27;s most urgent repairs, refurbished and reinforced the approach spans on either end of the bridge at a cost of $166 million. These repairs will permit the bridge to stay open until 2030. The second phase, whose cost was estimated at $94 million, were to replace the bascule span and make other repairs to the bridge.

On July 5, 2016, the U.S. Department of Transportation awarded a $90 million grant from its Fostering Advancements in Shipping and Transportation for the Long-term Achievement of National Efficiencies (FASTLANE) program to the National Park Service and the District of Columbia to permit repairs to the bridge to begin. The grant was conditional on finding an additional $36 million in matching funds for project, funds which can come from other federal non-transportation funds or from local funds. A joint statement by the group of congresspeople said the FASTLANE grant would enable NPS to begin engineering planning and issue contracts, with an eye toward beginning construction in early 2017.

===2018 major renovation===

On November 30, 2017, a major renovation of the bridge was announced by the U.S. Department of the Interior. The $227 million ($ in dollars) project was paid for from a wide range of federal funding sources, including a $30 million appropriation. The Federal Highway Administration said that Kiewit Infrastructure had received the contract for the work, which involved replacing the draw span, repairing the approaches, and replacing the deck. Construction began in 2018, and the renovated bridge fully reopened on December 4, 2020.

==In popular culture==
Memorial Bridge is commonly depicted in films, television shows, and books set in the Washington, D.C. area. Among the films in which it makes an appearance include No Way Out, &quot;Argo&quot;, &quot;A Few Good Men&quot;, &quot;Evan Almighty&quot;, &quot;Airline Disaster&quot;, and &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot;.

<text>Parliament railway station is a commuter railway station in the Melbourne central business district, serving the Melbourne suburb of East Melbourne in Victoria, Australia. Parliament is an underground premium station, featuring four platforms, two island platforms on two floors connected to street level via two underground concourses. It opened on 22 January 1983.

Parliament is one of the three underground stations on the City Loop. As of 2023-24 it carries 5.863 million passengers per year, making it the fourth-busiest station on the metropolitan network, approximately half of its usage prior to the COVID-19 Pandemic.

Parliament is served by eleven lines organised into four groups. It is served by Burnley, Caulfield, Clifton Hill and Northern group lines, part of the Melbourne railway network. The station is also served by two tram routes on Bourke Street, four tram routes on Macarthur Street, and three tram routes on Spring Street.

Parliament station opened in 1983, and it was named after the Parliament House, which is located just east of the station. During the station&#x27;s construction, the platforms of the station were built through tunneling. When the station opened, it had the longest escalator in the Southern Hemisphere but were surpassed, in 2022 and 2024, by the escalators at Airport Central station in Perth and Central Station in Sydney.

== Description ==

Parliament station is on the border of the Melbourne CBD and the suburb of East Melbourne. East of the main entrance is Macarthur Street and Spring Street, and Collins Street is to the south. The station is near Parliament House, hence the station&#x27;s name. Parliament station is owned by VicTrack, a state government agency, and is operated by Metro Trains Melbourne. The station is approximately , or around a 7-minute train journey, from Flinders Street.

Parliament station has two island platforms in a two-level configuration. The platforms are approximately long, which can accommodate a 7-car HCMT. In addition to the two platform levels, there are two underground concourses. The northern concourse is connected to street level via an exit on Lonsdale Street, and the southern concourse is connected to street level via an exit on Macarthur Street and two exits on Spring Street.

The station is compliant with the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 as there are lifts linking the concourse with both the platforms and street level. It has no parking facilities.

== History ==
Parliament station was one of three underground stations included in the construction plan of the new City Loop, overseen by the Melbourne Underground Rail Loop Authority (MURLA), formed in 1971.

The station platforms were constructed using tunnelling methods. A pilot tunnel was made, enabling the walls to be constructed ahead of the main excavation. Each platform is an individual tunnel and is linked to the other platforms at the same level by several cross tunnels. That choice of design mean that the remaining pillar of rock between the tunnels too weak to support the required loads, so it was replaced with concrete.

The booking hall to the south was constructed &quot;upside down&quot;, with the support columns being dug with augers from ground level, then filled with concrete. The roof was constructed over the piles from ground level, during a series of staged road closures. Once complete, the excavation of the booking hall was carried out underneath, while road traffic continued overhead. During construction, the fence around Parliament House had to be removed and stored, then re-erected.

The station opened on 22 January 1983. At the time of opening, the station had the longest escalators in the Southern Hemisphere, but they have since been surpassed by Airport Central railway station in Perth, opened in October 2022.

On 31 January 2021, a major timetable revision occurred to allow for the operation of the High Capacity Metro Trains, as well as more frequent services on both the Northern and Caulfield Groups. That included the removal of Frankston, Sandringham and Werribee lines from the City Loop., However, the Victorian State Government intends that the Frankston line will recommence operations through the City Loop in 2025, once the new Metro Tunnel is opened.

In 2022 and early 2023, works began to upgrade safety features at the three city loop stations. In 2022, a new intruder alarm system was installed. On 6 February 2023, early works commenced for stage 2 at Parliament station, which were expected to be complete by late 2023.The improvements include:
* Upgrading ventilation shafts
* Replacing existing ceiling panels
* Upgrading fire sprinkler systems
* Installation of new fire detection systems

== Platforms and services ==
Parliament station is served by 11 lines which are separated into four groups and are operated by Metro Trains Melbourne.

Platform 1 is served by the Clifton Hill group, which consists of the Hurstbridge and Mernda lines. Services run clockwise, first stopping at Jolimont and then travelling together until Clifton Hill where the line splits into two.

Platform 2 is served by the Caulfield group, which consists of the Cranbourne and Pakenham lines. Services operate anticlockwise through the City Loop, first travelling towards Flinders Street before travelling together towards Dandenong where the line splits into two. Services on both lines run express between South Yarra and Caulfield (Malvern during off-peak). From 2025, the Cranbourne and Pakenham lines will be removed from the City Loop and will be rerouted through the Metro Tunnel. Services on the Frankston line will serve the Loop instead.

Platform 3 is served by the Northern Group, which consists of the Craigieburn, Sunbury and Upfield lines. Service patterns alternate during the day between clockwise and anticlockwise operation. Services run through the loop together before splitting off at North Melbourne. From 2025, the Sunbury line will not run through the City Loop and will be rerouted through the Metro Tunnel.

Platform 4 is served by the Burnley Group, which consists of Alamein, Belgrave, Glen Waverley and Lilydale lines. Service patterns alternate during the day between clockwise and anticlockwise operation. Services on the Burnley group split off three times, first at Burnley where the Glen Waverley line branches off, then at Camberwell where the Alamein line branches off, and Ringwood where the Belgrave and Lilydale lines split into two.

<text>2C-D (2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenethylamine or 2C-M) is a psychedelic drug of the 2C family that is sometimes used as an entheogen. It was first synthesized in 1970 by a team from the Texas Research Institute of Mental Sciences, and its activity was subsequently investigated in humans by Alexander Shulgin. In his book &quot;PiHKAL&quot;, Shulgin lists the dosage range as being from 20 to 60 mg. Lower doses of 10 mg or less have been explored for microdosing.

Not much information is known about the toxicity of 2C-D, as no major studies have been conducted. According to Shulgin, the effects of 2C-D typically last for 4–6 hours. Shulgin himself referred to this substance as a “pharmacological tofu,” meaning that when mixed with other substances, it can extend or potentiate their effects without coloring the experience too much, in a manner similar to how tofu absorbs the flavors of sauces or spices it is cooked with. Hanscarl Leuner, working in Germany, explored the use of 2C-D under the name LE-25 in psychotherapeutic research.

==Drug prohibition laws==

===China===

<text>Seward Park is a municipal park in Seattle, Washington, United States. Located in the city neighborhood of the same name, it covers . The park occupies all of Bailey Peninsula (), a forested peninsula that juts into Lake Washington. It contains one of the last surviving tracts of old-growth forest within the city of Seattle. The park is named after U.S. Secretary of State William Seward.

==Geography==
The park is accessible from the north by Lake Washington Boulevard S, from the south by Seward Park Avenue S., and from the west by S Orcas Street. The main parking lot and a tennis court are located in the southwest corner. The most commonly used trail is a car-free loop around the park. It is flat and in length. The perimeter trail was repaved in 2007. Other trails run through the interior, including a few car-accessible roads that lead to amenities including an amphitheater and picnic area. Seward Park features numerous small beaches, the largest one on its southwest side, as well as a playground and an arts center.

The of Seward Park have roughly of surviving old growth forest, providing a glimpse of what some of the lake shore looked like before the city of Seattle was founded. With trees older than 250 years and many less than 200, the Seward Park forest is relatively young (the forests of Seattle before the city was fully mature were usually 1,000–2,000 years old).

==History==
The area has been inhabited since the end of the last glacial period (c. 8000 BCE—10,000 years ago). The (who is today a subgroup of the Duwamish people) traditionally conducted resource gathering in the area. The Lushootseed word for Bailey Peninsula is , specifically referring to the rocky points, or &quot;noses,&quot; at the north and south ends evident before the completion of the Lake Washington Ship Canal in 1916, which lowered the level of Lake Washington. The marshy isthmus connecting the peninsula to the mainland is called &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;neck&quot;.

The purchase of the park was suggested as early as 1892, but was sidelined due to its distance from what was then the city. However, the Olmsted Brothers assimilated it into its plan for Seattle parks, and the city of Seattle bought Bailey Peninsula in 1911 for $322,000, and named the park after William H. Seward, former United States Secretary of State, who was known for negotiating the Alaska Purchase

At the entrance to the park, in a wooded island filled with flowers between the circular entrance and exit road, there is a little-known monument: a &quot;taiko-gata&quot; stone lantern (tōrō), a gift of friendship from the City of Yokohama, Japan, which was given to the city in 1931 in gratitude to Seattle&#x27;s assistance to Yokohama after the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake.
Originally built for Seattle&#x27;s Potlatch festival in 1934, a Japanese style wooden torii stood near the entrance to Seward Park from 1936 to the mid 1980s, when it was removed due to decay. It was designed by Kichio Allen Arai, the first Asian American architect in Seattle to be credited for his work. A replacement made with stone columns and timber cross beams was completed by early 2021 and formally dedicated in 2022.

Since at least July 2004, the park has become a home to wild rabbits and a growing colony of feral Peruvian conures (parrots, either the Chapman&#x27;s mitred or the scarlet-fronted), who were released into the wild by their owners (or some escaped). They fly between Seward Park and Maple Leaf in northeast Seattle. The park is also home to two nesting pairs of bald eagles, who can frequently be seen flying over Lake Washington and diving to the water&#x27;s surface to catch fish and ducks.

Renovation on the Tudor-style house at the entrance to Seward Park—originally the Seward Park Inn, a Seattle city landmark—was completed early in 2008. It is now home to the Seward Park Audubon Center. Programs at the Center and in the park include school, youth, community, arts in the environment, and special events. The Center also includes exhibits, an extensive library, a laboratory, and a small gift shop.

On April 22, 2022, President Joe Biden visited Seward Park and signed an executive order to create an inventory of &quot;mature and old-growth trees&quot; for conservation purposes.

==Description==


Seward Park offers at least five distinct areas, including the beach on Andrews&#x27; Bay, which is flanked by a broad lawn and other facilities. It is one of several lakeshore beaches in Seattle&#x27;s parks system.

On the other side of this beach is a playground, tennis courts, and several large parking lots. The parking lots often feature neighboring residents sometimes throw impromptu parties in this area of the park. The upper area of the park includes a large picnic area and an outdoor amphitheater, where civic events are held. The amphitheater also has views of the old-growth forest, which is bisected by a trail with granite markers.

The paved perimeter of the park is home to a multi-use path for walking, hiking, running, bicycling, and rollerblading. It includes views of Mount Rainier, Lake Washington, Mercer Island, and Leschi/Mount Baker Ridge, among other areas. To the west of the park are several rows of homes on a nameless ridge, sometimes referred to as &quot;Graham Hill&quot;.

<text>Ryan Francis Atwood (born March 19, 1988) is a fictional character and the protagonist of the Fox television series &quot;The O.C.&quot;, portrayed by Ben McKenzie. Atwood is an outcast and troubled teenager from Chino, California, who is given a second chance when the wealthy Cohen family takes him in.

==Concept and creation==

===Casting===

&quot;The O.C.&quot;&#x27;s casting director Patrick Rush found the role of Ryan particularly hard to cast. Chad Michael Murray refused the role in favor of playing Lucas Scott on &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;. Rush invited Benjamin McKenzie to audition after Warner Bros. introduced him following an unsuccessful audition for a UPN sitcom. McKenzie, who had spent two years in New York City and Los Angeles seeking acting work, lacked experience and later described his selection as &quot;a tremendous leap of faith&quot; on the producers&#x27; part. Show creator Josh Schwartz said in 2014, &quot;[McKenzie] took it really seriously, and brought a lot of integrity, and integrity is not always required in a Fox teen drama&quot;.

==Characterization==

===Background===
The character Ryan was physically abused by his biological father Frank and some of his mother Dawn&#x27;s boyfriends. He has a complicated, love-hate relationship with his older brother Trey. Both parents struggled with alcohol – Frank became physically abusive, while Dawn neglected and verbally abused him – and it left a deep impression on him, as shown by his aversion to strong alcoholic drinks. Coined from his own statements, Ryan never had a father figure for much of his life, before being adopted by the Cohens due to Frank&#x27;s prison sentence and his mother&#x27;s revolving door of boyfriends. The Atwoods lived in Fresno but moved to Chino after Frank was imprisoned.

In season 4, it is stated that Ryan had not seen Frank in eight years. Regarding Ryan&#x27;s biological family, a major recurring theme revolved around abandonment. His mother abandoned him twice, his brother left for Las Vegas without telling him and his father left the brothers and their mom &quot;with nothing&quot; after serving his prison sentence. This is contrasted by the character&#x27;s adopted family—the Cohens—who stood by Ryan despite his juvenile record, vocal criticisms and disdain from the other &quot;Newpsies&quot; about his adoption and his multiple attempts to run away from them. Although he does not address Mr. and Mrs. Cohen (Sandy and Kirsten respectively) as Dad or Mom, he makes it clear that he considers them to be his parents.

Ryan generally dislikes speaking about his biological family and hints during Christmas and Thanksgiving that the holidays bring up painful memories for him. During his first Chrismukkah in Newport Beach, he tells the Cohens that his holidays mainly consisted of him &quot;getting [his] ass kicked&quot; and sums up his Christmas memories in three words: drinking, crying and cops.

===Personality===
Ryan was born to and then raised in a working class family, as such he knew the lifestyle and attitudes of people from his neighborhood of Chino, California, as well as the dangers that occurred in cases where outsiders are influenced by its environment. His abusive past enabled him to develop an extremely high pain threshold, and he displays an impassive expression after being physically abused. He is tough, cynical and quick-tempered, yet compassionate and empathetic toward people in trouble and those less fortunate than himself.

During his first months in Newport, he expressed his anger physically after incessant teasing from his schoolmates, which led them to intentionally goad him more. Ryan gradually calmed, after a lecture from Sandy and a stint at an anger management counseling session. He at times appears burdened by an almost compulsive need to rescue others at the expense of his own well-being, and as a result, is overly protective of Marissa, who is his main love interest on the show. Ryan displays intimacy issues—an inability to form close relationships—due to his birth family&#x27;s collective problems. He is extremely loyal to his family (both biological and adopted) and those he cares about. He is quiet and rarely smiles, which is a running joke among other members of the Cohen household. Early in the first season when he first moves in with the Cohens, he avoids making eye contact, and would stiffen when hugged, but by the final season, he moves past these issues with his adoptive family. Despite his reticent nature and emotionless exterior, Ryan is transparent, often &quot;convey[ing] everything with just a look&quot;, and is virtually incapable of lying. Dad Sandy proved this in the episode &quot;The O.Sea&quot; when he caught Ryan trying to cover up for Seth but Ryan&#x27;s &quot;guilty face&quot; gave it away.

Ryan&#x27;s personality is the opposite of the socially awkward, sheltered and sometimes naïve adopted brother Seth, and Ryan frequently uses his street-savvy skills to get Seth out of trouble. Seth often jokes about how he knew both Summer and Marissa since elementary school despite having never spoken to them.

As a student, Ryan is described as highly intelligent despite his behavior problems (he was suspended multiple times for fighting and truancy). In the pilot episode, the audience learns that he took his SATs (the only sophomore doing so) and scored in the 98th percentile. According to his mother Dawn, Ryan was always &quot;the smart one, the good one&quot; in the family.

Ryan&#x27;s favorite fruit is peaches, and his favorite band is Journey and he suffers from acrophobia. Athletically, he plays football (safety) and soccer (striker) in school. Despite the generosity of his adoptive family, Ryan earns money at various part-time jobs around town—as a busboy at the Crab Shack, a construction worker, an intern at the Newport Group, and a barback position. Ryan is an ex-smoker.

Of the characters in the show, Ryan is closest to his adoptive brother Seth, and their respective love interests—Marissa and Summer. This &quot;core four&quot; group of friends is the basis of Seth&#x27;s &quot;Atomic County&quot; comic series. Ryan and Seth often finish each other&#x27;s sentences, according to Summer, &quot;like they&#x27;re composing a lie on the spot&quot;, and they also read each other&#x27;s body language and facial expressions.

<text>2C-T-21 (4-(2-fluoroethylthio)-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine) is a psychedelic phenethylamine of the 2C family sometimes used as an entheogen. It was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin.

==Dosage==

In his book &quot;PiHKAL (Phenethylamines i Have Known And Loved)&quot;, Shulgin lists the dosage range as 8–12 mg.

==Effects==

2C-T-21 is generally taken orally and effects typically last 7 to 10 hours. The potential psychotherapeutic applications of this chemical were explored by Myron Stolaroff.

==Pharmacology==

The mechanism that produces 2C-T-21&#x27;s hallucinogenic and entheogenic effects has not been established; however, it may result from action as a 5-HT2A serotonin receptor agonist in the brain, a mechanism of action shared by all of the hallucinogenic tryptamines and phenethylamines for which the mechanism of action is known.

==Dangers==

On March 9, 2004, a 22-year-old quadriplegic man named James Edwards Downs in St. Francisville, Louisiana, consumed an unknown dose of 2C-T-21 by sticking his tongue into a vial of powder he had purchased online. He developed a temperature of ,&lt;ref name=&quot;urlNews from DEA, News Releases, 07/22/04&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; had a tonic-clonic seizure, and slipped into a coma. Four days later, on March 13, Downs died at Lane Memorial Hospital in Zachary, LA.

This death became part of a two-year DEA investigation called Operation Web Tryp which was launched in 2002. On July 22, 2004, the owners of American Chemical Supply were arrested on federal charges relating to distribution of controlled substance analogues and the death of James Edwards Downs. Little is known about the toxicity of 2C-T-21 beyond this incident.

==Legality==

2C-T-21 is unscheduled and uncontrolled in the United States, but possession and sales of 2C-T-21 would probably be prosecuted under the Federal Analog Act because of its structural similarities to 2C-T-7 and its known potential to cause death. In the wake of Operation Web Tryp in July 2004, at least one distributor faced charges as a consequence of the death of James Downs from 2C-T-21 overdose.

===Canada===
As of October 31, 2016, 2C-T-21 is a controlled substance (Schedule III) in Canada.

<doc id="690824" wikidata="Q2479508" url="?curid=690824" title="Marissa Cooper">
<text>Marissa Cooper is a fictional character on the FOX television series &quot;The O.C.&quot;, portrayed by Mischa Barton. Marissa was among the original &quot;core four&quot; characters on &quot;The O.C.&quot; She is a privileged California native born into a wealthy family, residing next to the Cohen family&#x27;s house. Throughout &quot;The O.C.&quot;&#x27;s storyline, Marissa is introduced to new characters who influence her perspective on life and her personality.

==Characterization==

===Personality===
Marissa Cooper is characterized as the privileged yet troubled girl next door. Her designer-label-packed wardrobe masks her turbulent mood swings and hard-partying ways. Although Marissa is tall, thin and pretty, sadly, she is not much else. She is afforded all the privileges of a Newport Beach lifestyle, yet she fails to show any interest or engagement with the world around her. Like many of her peers, she is emotionally distant from her mother and becomes disillusioned with her mother&#x27;s materialistic ways. As a result, she, like her sister Kaitlin, often rebelled against her mother. She is closer to her father, whom she stated was the &quot;last thing keeping [her] sane&quot; through the tumult of the first two seasons. Marissa was the social chair of The Harbor school. She organized the debutante ball rehearsals, school dances, carnivals, and other charity events. Simultaneously engaging in problematic romance and risky behavior, which in her case often go together.

Marissa&#x27;s risky behavior was a factor in her on-off relationship with Ryan Atwood. For example, during Ryan&#x27;s first Christmas in Newport Beach, he was furious to find her drunk due to his painful experiences as the child of alcoholic parents, but she did not understand his aversion to alcohol and thought that he was overreacting.

===Storyline===
Marissa is introduced as a wealthy, beautiful socialite in Newport Beach, California, whose family (mother Julie, father Jimmy, and younger sister Kaitlin) go through dramatic changes over the seasons. She is a troubled person before the series begins, with a history of substance abuse and rebellious behavior. This is evident from a scene in the pilot where she is left on her front door by her friends, passed out from drinking. The backstory on her friendship with Summer Roberts showcases it as a powerful bond, forged during second grade. One of her most profound connections, the friendship is a central element on the show for three seasons. The show significantly focuses on Marissa&#x27;s on-and-off again relationship with Ryan Atwood.

===Sexuality===
Viewers of the series have debated Marissa&#x27;s sexuality. When she hooked up with Alex Kelly, her heterosexual identity became the source of speculation. Fans questioned whether Marissa was bisexual or just bi-curious. The question became one of the top queries that viewers wanted &quot;The O.C.&quot; creator Josh Schwartz to answer.

Schwartz insisted that the relationship between Marissa and Alex was not a rating stunt and that Marissa developed real feelings for Alex. Sarah Warn of AfterEllen.com said that despite Schwartz&#x27;s statements, &quot;Marissa&#x27;s predominantly heterosexual past, the huge fan support for the Marissa and Ryan (Benjamin McKenzie) pairing, and the controversy &quot;The O.C.&quot; would court by making one of its principal characters bisexual, it&#x27;s likely that her &#x27;real feelings&#x27; for Alex will only last a few episodes.&quot; Within the series, Marissa refers casually to Alex as her ex-girlfriend.

Marissa&#x27;s sexual orientation, other than her known heterosexual identity, was never confirmed by the series, and was reported to be &quot;Marissa just experimenting with the fairer sex and not committing to a full-on romantic, sapphic relationship.&quot; The executives did, however, cite her relationship with Alex as an important one, and one that was successful with viewers.

Schwartz said that the network was &quot;nervous&quot; about the storyline and wanted it &quot;wrapped up as fast as humanly possible and Alex moving on out of the OC.&quot;

===Character&#x27;s exit===
The decision to kill Barton&#x27;s character came from the producers. Josh Schwartz relays that it was entirely a creative decision: &quot;It had as much to do with creatively feeling like this was always in the cards for this character and she was an inherently tragic heroine, and part of the Ryan/Marissa story was him trying to save her from a fate that she couldn&#x27;t be rescued from.&quot; Commenting on her character&#x27;s death, Barton said: &quot;My character has been through so, so much and there&#x27;s really nothing more left for her to do.&quot; She added, &quot;I was really excited that I get to die, to be honest. [...] It was better than one of those lame farewells.&quot;

==Character arc==

===Season 1===

Marissa&#x27;s father is caught committing fraud and eventually files for bankruptcy. The first episode sees sparks from between Marissa and Ryan Atwood. &quot;Who are you?&quot; asks Marissa. &quot;Whoever you want me to be,&quot; replies Ryan. Luke Ward, Marissa&#x27;s long-term boyfriend, shows animosity towards Ryan from the moment he steps foot into Orange County. Soon after, on vacation in Tijuana with Ryan, Seth Cohen and best friend Summer Roberts, Marissa discovers that her parents are separating. In the aftermath, she catches Luke cheating on her with one of her best friends, Holly Fischer. Marissa then separates from her friends and overdoses on painkillers. Ryan finds her unconscious in an alleyway in Tijuana and summons help just in time. After this, Marissa battles with her mother, who wants to send her to rehab. She eventually gets through to Julie but has to agree to see a therapist in Newport Beach after she is caught shoplifting. She meets Oliver Trask during her first session, and they soon become good friends, much to Ryan&#x27;s displeasure.

Throughout the first season, Marissa is involved in an on-again, off-again relationship with Ryan, with the relationship jeopardized by Luke and Oliver. Oliver is initially discovered by Ryan to be mentally unstable and harboring an unhealthy obsession for Marissa. Ryan and Marissa break up because of his interference. Oliver is arrested after he keeps Marissa as a hostage and threatens to kill himself if she does not leave Ryan for good. After Oliver&#x27;s arrest, Marissa attempts reuniting with Ryan, he refuses and they remain friends.

During this time, her mother is romantically involved with Kirsten Cohen&#x27;s father, Caleb Nichol. During a brief breakup with Caleb, Marissa&#x27;s mother has a fling with Luke, which causes Marissa to run away to Chino, California, to Ryan&#x27;s ex-girlfriend Theresa Diaz&#x27;s house. This leads to Ryan and Marissa again becoming romantically involved. Marissa uses the affair between Julie and Luke as blackmail to get out of counseling or living with her mother because Julie does not want anyone to find out.

Marissa and Ryan&#x27;s relationship is strained once more when Theresa comes to Newport Beach towards the end of the season after suffering domestic abuse from her boyfriend Eddie. Theresa reveals to Marissa that she is pregnant and does not know whether the baby&#x27;s father is Ryan or Eddie. In the season finale, Ryan leaves Marissa to move back to Chino and help Theresa raise the baby. Marissa moves into Caleb Nichol&#x27;s home after he and her mother marry in the season finale. Marissa&#x27;s grief over Ryan&#x27;s departure makes her turn back to alcohol.

===Season 2===
During the second season, Marissa struggles with alcohol and depression, caused largely by Ryan&#x27;s departure from her life. When Ryan returns, it looks as though they may have rekindled their relationship, but after finding out about her relationship with D.J., the &quot;yard guy,&quot; Ryan decides that they should just be friends, which they remain throughout most of the season. Marissa&#x27;s relationships in the interim period seem somewhat specifically chosen to take stabs at her mother—first with D.J. and then a lesbian romance with Alex Kelly. Her relationship with her parents sinks to an all-time low when she discovers that they were back together again. At Jimmy&#x27;s farewell party, she confronts her parents in public and loudly calls Julie a whore and herself &quot;the daughter of a thief and a slut.&quot;

Towards the end of the season, Marissa gets back together with Ryan and becomes friends with his brother, Trey, who was recently let out of jail. After Trey snorts cocaine, he tries to rape Marissa. Marissa does not want to tell Ryan because she did not want him to worry, and Trey does not want her to tell him because he and Ryan were getting along again. Marissa breaks down and tells Summer, who tells Seth. Seth is initially reluctant to tell his foster brother, knowing Ryan&#x27;s volatile temperament and tendency to physically lash out when it comes to people he cared about. When Ryan finds out, he and Trey get into a fist fight at Trey&#x27;s apartment. The scene ends with Marissa shooting Trey in order to save Ryan, who is pinned on the floor.

===Season 3===
As the series&#x27; third season opens, Marissa is under investigation regarding the shooting of Trey Atwood, who is in a coma as a result of the wound. When he awakens, Julie threatens to smother Trey if he does not tell the authority that Ryan shot him, in order to keep Marissa out of trouble. Marissa finds out and convinces Trey to tell the truth. Ryan is let free, and Marissa faces no legal liability as she was defending another person&#x27;s life using proportional force in the circumstances.

Despite a lack of legal repercussions, the event results in Marissa&#x27;s expulsion from the prestigious Harbor School, as it is cited along with her past of flagrant shoplifting and substance abuse. Following her expulsion, she attends the local public school Newport Union and has difficulty fitting in. She befriends one of her schoolmates, a local surfer named Johnny Harper. Johnny causes rifts in her relationship with Ryan, who ironically befriends Johnny due to their similar backgrounds, initially because Marissa feels she cannot talk to Ryan about what happened with Trey and later because Johnny falls in love with her. She is readmitted to Harbor after a campaign led by Ryan, Seth, Summer, and Marissa&#x27;s former rival for power at Harbor, Taylor Townsend. Marissa confirms her commitment to Ryan and writes Johnny a letter saying that while he is her friend and she cares for him, she will never love him. This results in Johnny falling to his death from a cliff after a drinking binge, and the tragedy causes Ryan and Marissa&#x27;s final breakup.

In the wake of Johnny&#x27;s death, Marissa struggles to find closure, as well as her own place and purpose in Newport Beach. She develops a relationship with Kevin Volchok after she and Ryan break up, which causes her to go back to her rebellious ways. She begins to abuse alcohol again and tries cocaine. Marissa distances herself from Ryan, Summer, and Seth and becomes argumentative again with her mother. After some time, she comes to her senses and decides to leave Kevin. But when she finds him watching &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, she realizes he has a sensitive side and decides she may be able to have a relationship with him. During their senior prom, though, she catches him cheating on her and breaks things off.

In the season finale, Marissa receives a letter from her father inviting her to live for a year on a boat with him in Greece, and she accepts. The day she graduates from Harbor along with her friends Summer, Ryan, Seth, and Taylor, Kevin begins calling her and asks to see her, but she declines. Marissa pays Kevin to get out of town and to leave her and Ryan alone. She says her goodbyes to her family and friends and prepares to leave for Greece. After their time together, Ryan drives her to the airport. On the way to the airport, a drunken Kevin begins hitting their car, causing them to go off the road.

The car flips over several times and lands upside down on another street. Marissa is unconscious, but Ryan pulls her out of the car, which begins to drip gasoline. Ryan takes Marissa into his arms and away from the car as it explodes. He tells her that he will need to go get help, but knowing that nothing can be done, she asks him to stay. After a few moments of looking into each other&#x27;s eyes, she dies while in Ryan&#x27;s arms.

===Season 4===
In &quot;The Avengers,&quot; Summer believes she sees Marissa - as a ghost - when she returns to the adjoining bedrooms they shared together for the first time since Marissa&#x27;s death. This causes Summer to fast track her trip back to Brown and leave Newport Beach. Moreover, many characters throughout Season 4 catch glimpses of Marissa, whether they be similar-looking girls in passing or a ghostly imagination of Marissa while reminiscing about her in a familiar place.

Marissa&#x27;s death has a significant impact on the fourth season, as various characters, particularly her mother Julie and Ryan, struggle to deal with their grief over her death. In the episode &quot;The Cold Turkey&quot;, Julie decides that it was time to move on after learning that Volchok turned himself over to the police and had been arrested. Later in the episode, during Thanksgiving dinner, Ryan reminisces to Julie about the first time he saw Marissa out on the driveway and thought that &quot;she was really hot&quot;. Marissa&#x27;s death is most explicitly examined in the episode &quot;The Chrismukk-huh?&quot; where Ryan and Taylor Townsend, both in comas, enter into an alternate universe where he has never moved to Newport Beach, and the lives of most major characters are completely changed.

While trying to find out what is happening in this reality, Taylor stumbles into Marissa&#x27;s bedroom. She surprises Julie&#x27;s maid, who tells Taylor that &quot;Miss Cooper&#x27;s&quot; plane arrives at 3 o&#x27;clock from Berkeley. Taylor then sees a photograph of Marissa and Julie on her desk, which leads her to believe that Marissa is still alive in this alternate universe.

After Taylor tells Ryan the news, he immediately wants to go to the airport to see Marissa. Taylor does not want him too, in fear that Ryan, who is still recovering from Marissa&#x27;s death, would be willing to spend the rest of his life in a coma if he could be with Marissa. At the airport, Ryan catches a glimpse of a girl with a pink Berkeley sweatshirt tied around her waist. The sweatshirt resembles the one worn by Marissa in &quot;The Day After Tomorrow.&quot; Ryan grabs her shoulder and realizes that it is not Marissa, but her sister, Kaitlin. Kaitlin then explains to Ryan that her sister died three years ago in an overdose in Tijuana (a parallel of her non-fatal overdose in the episode &quot;The Escape&quot;). 

Ryan then returns to Newport Beach, realizing that he can never be with Marissa again, alternate universe or not. At first, Ryan and Taylor believe they need to restore the relationships that existed before Marissa&#x27;s death in order to wake up. However, it becomes apparent that both Ryan and Taylor need to battle their internal demons instead. For Taylor, her demon is her mother (whom she confronts along with her alternate male self at the Christmas party), and for Ryan, it is getting over Marissa.

Back in the real world, Kirsten finds a letter from Marissa addressed to Ryan but does not read it. She hands it over to Julie, who reads the letter. Marissa wrote that she still loved Ryan, but would be leaving Newport Beach because she knew that it was the best thing to do, so that they could both move on. She stated that when she got back, they might try again, as they would both be older and wiser. The letter is eventually placed right beside Ryan, which allows the letter to be &quot;delivered&quot; to Ryan in the alternate universe.

Ryan then goes to the beach, and upon discovering the letter, reads it. He finally says goodbye to Marissa and exits the alternate universe.

In the final episode, Marissa appears as Ryan&#x27;s final flashback as he reflects on his life in Newport Beach. As he backs out of the driveway, Ryan remembers seeing Marissa standing on the corner watching as he and Sandy drive away when Ryan thought he was not coming back to Newport Beach (as seen in &quot;The Premiere&quot;).
==Relationships==

===Ryan Atwood===
Ryan Atwood is Marissa&#x27;s second boyfriend on &quot;The O.C.&quot; Although extremely on-and-off-again throughout the show&#x27;s course - their relationship originated as a platonic friendship in the pilot episode, which later escalated into romantic feelings. By the 10th episode of the first season, the couple officially began their romantic relationship. The beginning of this relationship sees its first end when Marissa feels that Ryan has overreacted to Marissa and Oliver Trask&#x27;s friendship. The second course of Marissa and Ryan&#x27;s relationship fails because of Theresa Diaz and Ryan&#x27;s illegitimate child together, whom Ryan agrees to help raise – returning to Theresa&#x27;s arms and leaving Marissa to return to her alcoholic behavior. The third attempt of Marissa and Ryan&#x27;s relationship terminates after the suicide of Johnny Harper where they struggle to mourn him and need a break from each other. The couple&#x27;s last attempt at a relationship ends when Marissa is killed by a drunken Kevin Volchok who sends Ryan and Marissa&#x27;s car off the road, sending her to her death.

===Julie Cooper===
The overall relationship between Marissa and her mother, Julie Cooper, is full of angst, rebellion, misunderstanding and miscommunication. Beginning with the fling between Julie and Marissa&#x27;s ex-boyfriend Luke Ward, the strain in the two&#x27;s relationship increases throughout the course of the show. After Marissa&#x27;s father Jimmy Cooper and Julie divorce, Julie treats Marissa as second tier to her many wealthy, successful boyfriends and fiancés in an attempt to save her own social and monetary status. The troubled Marissa is then left to deal with her friendship, alcoholic, and depression issue alone, without the help of Julie. The mother-daughter duo move from their home neighboring the Cohens, to Caleb Nichol&#x27;s home, to a mobile home during their time of financial hardship.

===Summer Roberts===
Summer Roberts, Marissa&#x27;s best friend, is a girl that Marissa often leans on in both happy and sad times. Marissa&#x27;s nickname for Summer, “Sum,” emphasizes the two&#x27;s bond. Together, Marissa and Summer are the popular girls at school: Summer the socialite, and Marissa the over-achieving, beautiful girl many long to be. The friendship between Summer and Marissa is further strengthened by the boyfriends they often have: best friends, and “brothers,” Seth Cohen and Ryan Atwood, as many group hang-outs and double dates occur. After every fight between Marissa&#x27;s on-and-off-again boyfriend, Ryan, Summer is the first by Marissa&#x27;s side – a supportive and comforting friend asking what went wrong. Summer becomes a positive force in Marissa&#x27;s life. For instance, Summer helps Marissa out of the hospital in episode 8, is open to Marissa&#x27;s fluid sexuality in episode 24, and has enough faith in Marissa despite her problematic behavior that she buys her a Berkeley sweatshirt in episode 71. Their friendship offers strong signs of female solidarity and is unique in that it is shown as a source of support and a catalyst for empowerment.

===Luke Ward===
Marissa&#x27;s first romantic relationship on the show is with water polo player Luke Ward. Their relationship begins prior to the Premiere. Marissa and Luke&#x27;s relationship stems back to the fifth grade on a class trip to the Museum of Tolerance. After much hesitation, Marissa decides to lose her virginity to Luke. Issues in Marissa and Luke&#x27;s relationship constantly arise, making the viewer question if they really are in love. On a trip to Tijuana, Marissa discovers Luke cheating on her with one of her friends, Holly Fischer, on the dance floor in a club. Marissa breaks up with Luke, who later begins an affair with her mother, Julie Cooper. 
Luke and Marissa&#x27;s tumultuous relationship evolves into a mature friendship by the second season. The two realize that they may not be the most compatible couple but can benefit from each other&#x27;s friendship and support.

<doc id="690834" wikidata="Q1333499" url="?curid=690834" title="Rappahannock River">
<text>The Rappahannock River is a river in eastern Virginia, in the United States, approximately in length. It traverses the entire northern part of the state, from the Blue Ridge Mountains in the west where it rises, across the Piedmont to the Fall Line, and onward through the coastal plain to flow into the Chesapeake Bay, south of the Potomac River.

An important river in American history, the Rappahannock was long an area of occupation by indigenous peoples, including the Rappahannock Tribe. Similarly, during the colonial era, early settlements in the Virginia Colony were formed along the river.

During the American Civil War, due to the river&#x27;s acting as a barrier to north–south troop movements, it effectively functioned as the boundary of the eastern theater of the war, between the &quot;North&quot; (the Union) and the &quot;South&quot; (the Confederate States of America). It was at the center of a major theater of battle where tens of thousands of troops fought against each other. In this period some 10,000 enslaved African Americans escaped to freedom across the river to Union lines, after the first Battle of Fredericksburg.

The river drains an area of , approximately 6% of Virginia. Much of the watershed is rural and forested. Development in the area has increased since the late 20th century with the southward expansion of the metropolitan Washington, D.C. suburbs.

==Course==
The Rappahannock River rises at Chester Gap, a wind gap in the Blue Ridge Mountains a few miles southeast of Front Royal, Virginia, near the single point where Warren, Fauquier, and Rappahannock counties come together. (Source Coordinates 38°49&#x27;40.1&quot;N 78°06&#x27;08.8&quot;W.) It flows southeastward, past Remington, Kelly&#x27;s Ford, and Richardsville, before it is joined from the right by the Rapidan River, its largest tributary. The Rappahannock passes through the city of Fredericksburg.

Southeast of Fredericksburg, the river begins to slow and widens into a brackish tidal estuary approximately long. It passes two small, important historic, river towns, Port Royal and Port Conway, which developed opposite each other, the former on the south bank, the latter on the north. The last navigable points for ocean-going ships, they were early ports for the export of tobacco, the major commodity crop.

As it flows past Tappahannock on its southern bank, the river is well over a mile wide. The last settlements of any size before it reaches the Chesapeake Bay are Irvington, Urbanna, Stingray Point, and White Stone Beach.

The broad river enters the Chesapeake Bay approximately south of the mouth of the Potomac River and approximately east of the state capital, Richmond. At the point where the river enters the bay, between Windmill Point, on the north, and Stingray Point, on the south, it is more than wide. This estuary, south of the Northern Neck peninsula, is a productive oyster and crab fishery.

Above Fredericksburg, the Rappahannock provides fine opportunities for recreational canoeing and kayaking. Most of the rapids are Class I and Class II in difficulty, but, near Remington, there are some rapids that are considered to be Class III.

The river&#x27;s watershed is protected in various places as parcels of the Rappahannock River Valley National Wildlife Refuge.

==Oysters==
The oysters that thrive in the estuary of the Rappahannock River are the least salty oysters of the East Coast. They are renowned for their sweet and smooth flavor, described as almost buttery. The low salinity allows a Blue Ridge minerality to come through. These oysters are known for being good to consume with wine.

The nutritious oysters were eaten on a large scale in 19th-century Washington. They were served fresh, grilled, stewed, or as part of a pie.

==History==
The name of the river comes from an Algonquian word, &quot;lappihanne&quot; (also recorded as &quot;toppehannock&quot;), meaning &quot;river of quick, rising water&quot; or &quot;where the tide ebbs and flows,&quot; the name used by the local Rappahannock tribe. In 2018 it became one of the federally recognized tribes in Virginia.

Although a few small hamlets developed along the lower Rappahannock during early colonial times, the settlement of the Rappahannock River valley began in earnest during the first years of the eighteenth century, at the urging of Governor Alexander Spotswood. The James River had been surveyed up to its fall line, the point where, geologically, continental bedrock of the Piedmont meets the sedimentary rocks and alluvial soils of the coastal plain. It is usually the last navigable portion of a river from the sea.

Spotswood encouraged settlement in a river valley other than that of the James. In 1714, he began recruiting Protestant immigrants from the Rhineland-Palatinate and Switzerland to homestead on lands he controlled near the confluence of the Rappahannock and the Rapidan. Known as the Germanna settlement(s), these villages were founded in order to exploit the iron ore deposits of the region.

During the War of 1812, the Battle of Rappahannock River was fought on the river. Seventeen British boats filled with hundreds of marines and sailors captured four American privateers.
During the American Civil War, the river, with few convenient fords and fewer bridges, provided a barrier and defensive line behind which movements of troops could be accomplished with little fear of attack from the river-side flank. It was an especially difficult barrier for Union troops to overcome in their attempts to thrust into southern Virginia, as they were vulnerable to attack while trying to cross the river on temporary bridges. Control of the river changed hands many times during the course of the war. Significant battles fought along the river include the Battle of Fredericksburg and two Battles of Rappahannock Station. The defensive line at the river was finally circumvented by General Ulysses S. Grant in the Wilderness (or Overland) Campaign of 1864, ending in the ultimate Union victory.

During and after the first battle at Fredericksburg in late December 1862, about 10,000 enslaved African Americans from area plantations and the city reached for their futures, crossing the river to gain freedom behind Union lines. This exodus and its &quot;Trail of Freedom&quot; was commemorated in 2010 by installation of historical markers on both sides of the river, in Fredericksburg and in Stafford County. The exodus to freedom is now celebrated in an annual re-enactment starting in Fredericksburg.

In some 18th- and 19th-century documents, including some Civil War records, the Rappahannock River was referred to as &quot;Hedgeman&#x27;s River&quot;. A 1736–1737 survey labeled the Rappahannock above the mouth of the Rapidan as &quot;Cannon&quot;, and further upstream it was identified as &quot;Hedgeman&#x27;s River,&quot; named after Nathaniel Hedgeman, an early settler of the region.

<doc id="690842" wikidata="Q133641" url="?curid=690842" title="Age of Discovery">
<text>The Age of Discovery (), also known as the Age of Exploration, was part of the early modern period and largely overlapped with the Age of Sail. It was a period from approximately the late 15th century to the 17th century, during which seafarers from a number of European countries explored, colonized, and conquered regions across the globe. The Age of Discovery was a transformative period in world history when previously isolated parts of the world became connected to form the world-system and laid the groundwork for globalization. The extensive overseas exploration, particularly the opening of maritime routes to the Indies and the European colonization of the Americas by the Spanish and Portuguese, later joined by the English, French and Dutch, spurred in the international global trade. The interconnected global economy of the 21st century has its origins in the expansion of trade networks during this historic era.

The exploration also created colonial empires and marked an increased adoption of colonialism as a government policy in several European states. As such, it is sometimes synonymous with the first wave of European colonization. The colonization reshaped power dynamics causing geopolitical shifts in Europe and creating new centers of power beyond Europe. Having set human history on the global common course, the legacy of the Age still shapes the world today.

European oceanic exploration started with the maritime expeditions of Portugal to the Canary Islands in 1336, and later with the Portuguese discoveries of the Atlantic archipelagos of Madeira and Azores, the coast of West Africa in 1434, and the establishment of the sea route to India in 1498 by Vasco da Gama, which initiated the Portuguese maritime and trade presence in Kerala and the Indian Ocean.

During the Age of Discovery, Spain sponsored and financed the transatlantic voyages of the Italian navigator Christopher Columbus, which from 1492 to 1504 marked the start of colonization in the Americas, and the expedition of the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan to open a route from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific, which later achieved the first circumnavigation of the globe between 1519 and 1522. These Spanish expeditions significantly impacted the European perceptions of the world. These discoveries led to numerous naval expeditions across the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, and land expeditions in the Americas, Asia, Africa, and Australia that continued into the late 19th century, followed by the exploration of the polar regions in the 20th century.

European exploration initiated the Columbian exchange between the Old World (Europe, Asia, and Africa) and the New World (the Americas and Australia). This exchange involved the transfer of plants, animals, human populations (including slaves), communicable diseases, and culture across the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. The Age of Discovery and European exploration involved mapping of the world, shaping a new worldview and facilitating contact with distant civilizations. The continents drawn by European mapmakers of the Age developed from abstract &quot;blobs&quot; into the outlines more recognizable to us today. Simultaneously, the spread of new diseases, especially affecting American Indians, led to rapid population declines. The era saw widespread enslavement, exploitation and military conquest of native populations, concurrent with the growing economic influence and spread of western and European culture, science and technology leading to a faster-than-exponential population growth world-wide.
==Concept==
The concept of discovery has been scrutinized, critically highlighting the history of the core term of this periodization. The term &quot;age of discovery&quot; is in historical literature and still commonly used. J. H. Parry, calling the period the &quot;Age of Reconnaissance&quot;, argues that not only was the era one of European explorations, but it also produced the expansion of geographical knowledge and empirical science. &quot;It saw also the first major victories of empirical inquiry over authority, the beginnings of that close association of science, technology, and everyday work which is an essential characteristic of the modern western world.&quot; Anthony Pagden draws on the work of Edmundo O&#x27;Gorman for the statement that &quot;For all Europeans, the events of October 1492 constituted a &#x27;discovery&#x27;. Something of which they had no prior knowledge had suddenly presented itself to their gaze.&quot; O&#x27;Gorman argues that the physical encounter with new territories was less important than the Europeans&#x27; effort to integrate this new knowledge into their worldview, what he calls &quot;the invention of America&quot;. Pagden examines the origins of the terms &quot;discovery&quot; and &quot;invention&quot;. In English, &quot;discovery&quot; and its forms in romance languages derive from &quot;&quot;disco-operio&quot;, meaning to uncover, to reveal, to expose to the gaze&quot;, what was revealed existed previously. Few Europeans during the period used the term &quot;invention&quot; for the European encounters, with the exception of Martin Waldseemüller, whose map first used the term &quot;America&quot;.

A central legal concept of the discovery doctrine, expounded by the US Supreme Court in 1823, draws on assertions of European powers&#x27; right to claim land during their explorations. The concept of &quot;discovery&quot; has been used to enforce colonial claiming and discovery, but has been challenged by indigenous peoples and researchers. Many indigenous peoples have fundamentally challenged the concept of colonial claiming of &quot;discovery&quot; over their lands and people, as forced and negating indigenous presence.

The period alternatively called the &quot;Age of Exploration&quot;, has been scrutinized through reflections on the exploration. Its understanding and use, has been discussed as being framed and used for colonial ventures, discrimination and exploitation, by combining it with concepts such as the &quot;frontier&quot; (as in Frontier Thesis) and manifest destiny, up to the contemporary age of space exploration. Alternatively, the term &quot;contact&quot;, as in first contact, has been used to shed more light on the age of discovery and colonialism, using the alternative names of &quot;Age of Contact&quot; or &quot;Contact Period&quot;, discussing it as an &quot;unfinished, diverse project&quot;.

==Overview==
The Portuguese began systematically exploring the Atlantic coast of Africa in 1418, under the sponsorship of Prince Henry the Navigator. In 1488, Bartolomeu Dias reached the Indian Ocean by this route.

In 1492, the Catholic Monarchs of Spain funded Genoese mariner Christopher Columbus&#x27;s () plan to sail west to reach the Indies, by crossing the Atlantic. Columbus encountered a continent uncharted by Europeans (though it had been explored and temporarily colonized by the Norse 500 years earlier). Later, it was called America after Amerigo Vespucci, a trader working for Portugal. Portugal quickly claimed those lands under the terms of the Treaty of Alcáçovas, but Castile was able to persuade the Pope, who was Castilian, to issue four papal bulls to divide the world into two regions of exploration, where each kingdom had exclusive rights to claim newly discovered lands. These were modified by the Treaty of Tordesillas, ratified by Pope Julius II.

In 1498, a Portuguese expedition commanded by Vasco da Gama reached India by sailing around Africa, opening up direct trade with Asia. While other exploratory fleets were sent from Portugal to northern North America, Portuguese India Armadas also extended this Eastern oceanic route, touching South America and opening a circuit from the New World to Asia (starting in 1500 by Pedro Álvares Cabral), and explored islands in the South Atlantic and Southern Indian Oceans. The Portuguese sailed further eastward, to the valuable Spice Islands in 1512, landing in China one year later. Japan was reached by the Portuguese in 1543. In 1513, Spanish Vasco Núñez de Balboa crossed the Isthmus of Panama and reached the &quot;other sea&quot; from the New World. Thus, Europe first received news of the eastern and western Pacific within a one-year span around 1512. East and west exploration overlapped in 1522, when a Spanish expedition sailing westward, led by Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan (and, after his death in what is now the Philippines, by navigator Juan Sebastián Elcano), completed the first circumnavigation of the world. Spanish &quot;conquistadors&quot; explored the interior of the Americas, and some of the South Pacific islands. Their main objective was to disrupt Portuguese trade in the East.

From 1495, the French, English, and Dutch entered the race of exploration, after learning of Columbus&#x27; exploits, defying the Iberian monopoly on maritime trade by searching for new routes. The first expedition was led by John Cabot in 1497 to the north, in the service of England, followed by French expeditions to South America and later to North America. Later expeditions went to the Pacific Ocean around South America, and eventually by following the Portuguese around Africa, into the Indian Ocean; discovering Australia in 1606, New Zealand in 1642, and Hawaii in 1778. From the 1580s to the 1640s, Russians explored and conquered almost the whole of Siberia, and claimed Alaska in the 1730s.

==Background==
===Rise of European trade===
After the fall of the Western Roman Empire largely severed the connection between Europe and lands further east, Christian Europe was largely a backwater compared to the Arab world, which conquered and incorporated large territories in the Middle East and North Africa. The Christian Crusades to retake the Holy Land from the Muslims were not a military success, but they did bring Europe into contact with the Middle East and the valuable goods manufactured or traded there. From the 12th century, the European economy was transformed by the interconnecting of river and sea trade routes.

Before the 12th century, an obstacle to trade east of the Strait of Gibraltar, which connected the Mediterranean to the Atlantic Ocean, was Muslim control of territory, including the Iberian Peninsula, as well as the trade monopolies of Christian city-states on the Italian Peninsula, especially Venice and Genoa. Economic growth of Iberia followed the Christian reconquest of Al-Andalus in what is now southern Spain and the siege of Lisbon (1147 AD), in Portugal. The decline of the Fatimid Caliphate&#x27;s naval strength, which started before the First Crusade, helped the maritime Italian states, mainly Venice, Genoa and Pisa, dominate trade in the Eastern Mediterranean, with merchants there becoming wealthy and politically influential. Further changing the mercantile situation in the eastern Mediterranean was the waning of Christian Byzantine naval power following the death of Emperor Manuel I Komnenos in 1180, whose dynasty had made notable treaties and concessions with Italian traders, permitting the use of Byzantine Christian ports. The Norman Conquest of England, in the late 11th century, allowed for peaceful trade on the North Sea. The Hanseatic League, a confederation of merchant guilds and their towns in north Germany, along the North Sea and Baltic Sea, was instrumental in the commercial development of the region. In the 12th century, the regions of Flanders, Hainault, and Brabant produced the finest quality textiles in northwest Europe, which encouraged merchants from Genoa and Venice to sail there from the Mediterranean, through the Strait of Gibraltar, and up the Atlantic coast. Nicolòzzo Spinola made the first recorded direct voyage from Genoa to Flanders in 1277.

===Technology: Ship design and the compass===
Technological advancements that were important to the Age of Exploration were the adoption of the magnetic compass and advances in ship design.

The compass was an addition to the ancient method of navigation based on sightings of the sun and stars. It was invented during the Chinese Han dynasty and had been used for navigation in China by the 11th century. It was adopted by Arab traders in the Indian Ocean. The compass spread to Europe by the late 12th or early 13th century. Use of the compass for navigation in the Indian Ocean was first mentioned in 1232. The first mention of use of the compass in Europe was in 1180. The Europeans used a &quot;dry&quot; compass, with a needle on a pivot. The compass card was also a European invention.

The ships of the Age of Discovery post-dated the fusion of the northern European and Mediterranean ship-building traditions. Prior to the late 13th/early 14th centuries, northern European ships were typically clinker built, with a single mast setting a square sail and a centre-line hung on the with pintles and gudgeons. Their counterparts in the Mediterranean were built with carvel hulls, had one or more masts (depending on size) which set lateen sails, and were steered with quarter-rudders positioned on the side of the hull. 

Trade, pilgrimage and war brought ships from each tradition into the other&#x27;s region, ultimately leading to the copying of features that were new to each. Over the early 14th century, square sails started to be used in the Mediterranean, with the mainmast setting square rig and the mizzen carrying a lateen sail. In the first two decades of the 15th century this arrangement was copied in northern Europe where, by the late 1430s, some ships were built with carvel hulls. The end result of this merging of traditions was the full-rigged ship, a carvel hull with a sternpost-hung pintle-and-gudgeon rudder and three masts: the foremast and mainmast setting square sails and the mizzen a lateen sail. Alongside this type of vessel, the caravel was used. This type was also carvel built with a sternpost-hung rudder but could be completely lateen rigged or have some square sails.

Very few wrecks of Age of Discovery ships have been found and archaeologically investigated. More is known about Roman and Greek ships of classical antiquity than those of this period. The caravel is particularly poorly understood, despite the number of &quot;replicas&quot; that have been constructed. However, a particular set of hull construction characteristics have been identified from wrecks of this time, referred to as Iberian Atlantic shipbuilding tradition. They are found in the Molasses Reef wreck, Highbourne Cay wreck, the Red Bay wreck and some sites in European waters.

===Early geographical knowledge and maps===

The &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot;, a document from 40–60 AD, describes a newly discovered route through the Red Sea to India, with descriptions of the markets in towns around Red Sea, Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean, including along the east coast of Africa, which states &quot;for beyond these places the unexplored ocean curves around toward the west, and running along by the regions to the south of Aethiopia and Libya and Africa, it mingles with the western sea (possible reference to the Atlantic Ocean)&quot;. European medieval knowledge about Asia beyond the reach of the Byzantine Empire was sourced in partial reports, often obscured by legends, dating back from the conquests of Alexander the Great and successors. Another source was the Radhanite Jewish trade networks of merchants established as go-betweens between Europe and the Muslim world during the time of the Crusader states.
In 1154, the Arab geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi created a description of the world and a world map, the Tabula Rogeriana, at the court of King Roger II of Sicily, but still Africa was only partially known to either Christians, Genoese and Venetians, or the Arab seamen, and its southern extent was unknown. There were reports of great African Sahara, but the knowledge was limited for the Europeans, to the Mediterranean coast and little else, since the Arab blockade of North Africa precluded exploration inland. Knowledge about the Atlantic African coast was fragmented and derived mainly from old Greek and Roman maps based on Carthaginian knowledge, including Roman exploration of Mauritania. The Red Sea was barely known and only trade links with the Maritime republics, Venice especially, fostered the collection of accurate maritime knowledge. Indian Ocean trade routes were sailed by Arab traders.

By 1400, a Latin translation of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geographia&quot; reached Italy from Constantinople. The rediscovery of Roman geographical knowledge was a revelation, both for map-making and worldview, although reinforcing the idea that the Indian Ocean was landlocked.

=== Medieval European travel (1241–1438) ===

A prelude to the Age of Discovery was a series of European expeditions crossing Eurasia by land in the late Middle Ages. The Mongols had threatened Europe, but Mongol states also unified much of Eurasia and, from 1206 on, the &quot;Pax Mongolica&quot; allowed safe trade routes and communication lines from the Middle East to China. The close Italian links to the Levant raised curiosity and commercial interest in countries which lay further east. There are a few accounts of merchants from North Africa and the Mediterranean, who traded in the Indian Ocean in late medieval times (see also: Indo-Mediterranean#Medieval era).

Christian embassies were sent as far as Karakorum during the Mongol invasions of the Levant, from which they gained a greater understanding of the world. The first of these travellers was Giovanni da Pian del Carpine, dispatched by Pope Innocent IV to the Great Khan, who journeyed to Mongolia and back from 1241 to 1247. Russian prince Yaroslav of Vladimir, and his sons Alexander Nevsky and Andrey II of Vladimir, travelled to the Mongolian capital. Though having strong political implications, their journeys left no detailed accounts. Other travellers followed, like French André de Longjumeau and Flemish William of Rubruck, who reached China through Central Asia. Marco Polo, a Venetian merchant, dictated an account of journeys throughout Asia from 1271 to 1295, describing being a guest at the Yuan dynasty court of Kublai Khan in &quot;Travels&quot;. It was read throughout Europe.

The Muslim fleet guarding the Strait of Gibraltar was defeated by Genoa in 1291. In that year, the Genoese attempted their first Atlantic exploration when merchant brothers Vadino and Ugolino Vivaldi sailed from Genoa with two galleys, but disappeared off the Moroccan coast, feeding fears of oceanic travel. From 1325 to 1354, a Moroccan scholar from Tangier, Ibn Battuta, journeyed through North Africa, the Sahara desert, West Africa, Southern Europe, Eastern Europe, the Horn of Africa, the Middle East and Asia, having reached China. After returning, he dictated an account to a scholar he met in Granada, &quot;The Rihla&quot; (&quot;The Journey&quot;), the unheralded source on his adventures. Between 1357 and 1371 a book of supposed travels compiled by John Mandeville acquired popularity. Despite the unreliable and often fantastical nature of its accounts, it was used as a reference for the East, Egypt, and the Levant in general, asserting the old belief that Jerusalem was the centre of the world. Following the period of Timurid relations with Europe, in 1439, Niccolò de&#x27; Conti published an account of his travels as a Muslim merchant to India and Southeast Asia. In 1466–1472, Russian merchant Afanasy Nikitin of Tver travelled to India, which he described in his book &quot;A Journey Beyond the Three Seas&quot;.

These overland journeys had little immediate effect. The Mongol Empire collapsed almost as quickly as it formed and soon the route to the east became more difficult and dangerous. The Black Death of the 14th century also blocked travel and trade for a time.

=== Religion ===
Religion played a critical role in motivating European expansionism. In 1487, Portuguese envoys Pero da Covilhã and Afonso de Paiva were sent on a covert mission to gather intelligence on a potential sea route to India and inquire about Prester John, a Nestorian patriarch and king, believed to rule over parts of the subcontinent. Covilhã was warmly received upon his arrival in Ethiopia, but forbidden from leaving.
During the Middle Ages, the spread of Christianity throughout Europe fueled the desire to sermonise in lands beyond. This evangelical effort became a significant part of the military conquests of European powers, like Portugal, Spain, and France, often leading to the conversion of indigenous peoples, voluntarily or forced.

Religious orders such as the Franciscans, Dominicans, Augustinians, and Jesuits partook in most missionary endeavours in the New World. By the late 16th and 17th centuries, the latter&#x27;s presence increased as they sought to reassert their power and revive the Catholic culture of Europe, which had been damaged by the Reformation.

===Chinese missions (1405–1433)===
The Chinese had wide connections through trade in Asia and been sailing to Arabia, East Africa, and Egypt since the Tang dynasty (AD 618–907). Between 1405–21, the third Ming emperor Yongle sponsored long range tributary missions in the Indian Ocean under the command of admiral Zheng He. 

A large fleet of new junk ships was prepared for the international diplomatic expeditions. The largest of these junks—that the Chinese termed &quot;bao chuan&quot; (treasure ships)—may have measured 121 metres, and thousands of sailors were involved. The first expedition departed in 1405. At least seven well-documented expeditions were launched, each bigger and more expensive than the last. The fleets visited Arabia, East Africa, India, Malay Archipelago and Thailand (then called Siam), exchanging goods along the way. They presented gifts of gold, silver, porcelain and silk; in return, received such novelties as ostriches, zebras, camels, ivory and giraffes. After the emperor&#x27;s death, Zheng He led a final expedition departing from Nanking in 1431 and returning to Beijing in 1433. It is likely this last expedition reached as far as Madagascar. The travels were reported by Ma Huan, a Muslim voyager and translator who accompanied Zheng He on three of the expeditions, his account published as the &quot;Yingya Shenglan&quot; (Overall Survey of the Ocean&#x27;s Shores) (1433).

The voyages had a significant and lasting effect on the organization of a maritime network, using and creating nodes and conduits in its wake, thereby restructuring international and cross-cultural relationships and exchanges. It was especially impactful as no other polity had exerted naval dominance over all sectors of the Indian Ocean, prior to these voyages. The Ming promoted alternative nodes as a strategy to establish control over the network. For instance, due to Chinese involvement, ports such as Malacca (in Southeast Asia), Cochin (Malabar Coast), and Malindi (Swahili Coast) had grown as key alternatives to other established ports. The appearance of the Ming treasure fleet generated and intensified competition among contending polities and rivals, each seeking an alliance with the Ming. The expeditions developed into a maritime trade enterprise, with imperial control over local markets and court-monitored transactions, generating revenue for China and its partners. They boosted regional trade and production, caused a supply shock in Eurasia and led to price spikes in Europe in the early 15th century. 

The tributary relations promoted during the voyages manifested a trend toward cross-regional interconnections and early globalization in Asia and Africa. Diplomatic relations were built on mutually beneficial maritime trade and China&#x27;s strong naval presence in foreign waters, with Chinese naval superiority being a key factor in these interactions. The voyages brought about the Western Ocean&#x27;s regional integration and increase in international circulation of people, ideas, and goods. It provided a platform for cosmopolitan discourses, which took place in locations such as the ships of the Ming treasure fleet, the Ming capitals of Nanjing as well as Beijing, and the banquet receptions organized by the Ming court for foreign representatives. Diverse groups of people from maritime countries congregated, interacted, and traveled together as the treasure fleet sailed from and to China. For the first time, the maritime region from China to Africa was under the dominance of a single imperial power and allowed for the creation of a cosmopolitan space.

These long-distance journeys were not followed up, as the Ming dynasty retreated in the &quot;haijin&quot;, a policy of isolationism, having limited maritime trade. Travels were halted abruptly after the emperor&#x27;s death, as the Chinese lost interest in what they termed barbarian lands, turning inward, and successor emperors felt the expeditions were harmful to the Chinese state; Hongxi Emperor ended further expeditions and Xuande Emperor suppressed much of the information about Zheng He&#x27;s voyages.

==Atlantic Ocean (1419–1507)==


From the 8th until the 15th century, the Republic of Venice and neighboring maritime republics held the monopoly of European trade with the Middle East. The silk and spice trade, involving spices, incense, herbs, drugs and opium, made these Mediterranean city-states phenomenally rich. Spices were among the most expensive and demanded products of the Middle Ages, as they were used in medieval medicine, religious rituals, cosmetics, perfumery, as well as food additives and preservatives. They were all imported from Asia and Africa.

Muslim traders dominated maritime routes throughout the Indian Ocean, tapping source regions in the Far East and shipping for trading emporiums in India, mainly Kozhikode, westward to Ormus in the Persian Gulf and Jeddah in the Red Sea. From there, overland routes led to the Mediterranean coasts. Venetian merchants distributed the goods through Europe until the rise of the Ottoman Empire, which eventually led to the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, barring Europeans from some important combined-land-sea routes in areas around the Aegean, Bosporus, and Black Sea. The Venetians and other maritime republics maintained more limited access to Asian goods, via south-eastern Mediterranean trade, in such ports as Antioch, Acre, and Alexandria.

Forced to reduce their activities in the Black Sea, and at war with Venice, the Genoese had turned to North African trade of wheat, olive oil and a search for silver and gold. Europeans had a constant deficit in silver and gold, as it only went out, spent on eastern trade now cut off. Several European mines were exhausted, The lack of bullion led to the development of a complex banking system to manage the risks in trade (the first state bank, &quot;Banco di San Giorgio&quot;, was founded in 1407 at Genoa). Sailing also into the ports of Bruges (Flanders) and England, Genoese communities were then established in Portugal, who profited from their enterprise and financial expertise.

European sailing had been primarily close to land cabotage, guided by portolan charts. These charts specified proven ocean routes guided by coastal landmarks: sailors departed from a known point, followed a compass heading, and tried to identify their location by its landmarks. For the first oceanic exploration Western Europeans used the compass, as well as progressive new advances in cartography and astronomy. Arab navigational tools like the astrolabe and quadrant were used for celestial navigation.

The Muslim lands in Asia were generally more economically developed and had better infrastructure than Europe at this time, despite Europe&#x27;s economic changes brought about by the Black Death allowing for more freedoms for lower- and upper-class people. The gunpowder empires concealed knowledge to European Christian traders about where lucrative locations such as Indonesia were, spurring a further desire for Christian trade with other Muslim nations besides the gunpowder empires despite European Christians generally having antipathy towards Muslims.

===Portuguese exploration===

In 1297, King Denis of Portugal took a personal interest in exports. In 1317, he made an agreement with Genoese merchant sailor Manuel Pessanha, appointing him first admiral of the Portuguese Navy, to defend the country against Muslim pirate raids. Outbreaks of bubonic plague led to severe depopulation in the second half of the 14th century: only the sea offered alternatives, with most population settling in fishing and trading coastal areas. Between 1325 and 1357, Afonso IV of Portugal encouraged maritime commerce and ordered the first explorations. The Canary Islands, already known to the Genoese, were claimed as officially discovered under the patronage of the Portuguese, but in 1344 Castile disputed them, expanding their rivalry into the sea.

To ensure their monopoly on trade, Europeans (beginning with the Portuguese) attempted to install a Mediterranean system of trade which used military might and intimidation, to divert trade through ports they controlled; there it could be taxed. In 1415, Ceuta was conquered by the Portuguese aiming to control navigation of the African coast. The young prince Henry the Navigator was there and became aware of profit possibilities in the trans-Saharan trade routes. For centuries slave and gold trade routes linking West Africa with the Mediterranean passed over the Western Sahara Desert, controlled by the Moors of North Africa.

Henry wished to know how far Muslim territories in Africa extended, hoping to bypass them and trade directly with West Africa by sea, find allies in legendary Christian lands to the south like the supposed long-lost Christian kingdom of Prester John and probe whether it was possible to reach the Indies by sea, the source of the lucrative spice trade. He invested in sponsoring voyages down the coast of Mauritania, gathering a group of merchants, shipowners and stakeholders interested in new sea lanes. Soon the Atlantic islands of Madeira (1419) and the Azores (1427) were reached. The expedition leader who established settlements on Madeira, was Portuguese explorer João Gonçalves Zarco.

Europeans did not know what lay beyond Cape Non (Cape Chaunar) on the African coast, and whether it was possible to return once it was crossed. Nautical myths warned of oceanic monsters or an edge of the world, but Henry&#x27;s navigation challenged such beliefs: starting in 1421, systematic sailing overcame it, reaching the difficult Cape Bojador that in 1434 one of Henry&#x27;s captains, Gil Eanes, finally passed.

From 1440 onwards, caravels were extensively used for the exploration of the coast of Africa. This was an existing Iberian ship type, used for fishing, commerce and military purposes. Unlike other vessels of the time, the caravel had a sternpost-mounted rudder (as opposed to a side-mounted steering oar). It had a shallow draft, which was helpful in exploring unknown coastlines. It had good sailing performance, with a windward ability that was notable by the standards of the time. The lateen rig was less useful when sailing downwind – which explains Christopher Columbus () re-rigging the with square rig.

For celestial navigation the Portuguese used the ephemerides, which experienced a remarkable diffusion in the 15th century. These were astronomical charts plotting the location of the stars over a distinct period of time. Published in 1496 by the Jewish astronomer, astrologer, and mathematician Abraham Zacuto, the Almanac Perpetuum included some of these tables for the movements of stars. These tables revolutionized navigation, allowing the calculation of latitude. Exact longitude remained elusive from mariners for centuries. Using the caravel, systematic exploration continued ever more southerly, advancing on average one degree a year. Senegal and Cape Verde Peninsula were reached in 1445 and in 1446, Álvaro Fernandes pushed on almost as far as present-day Sierra Leone.

In 1453, the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans was a perceived blow to Christendom and established business links with the East. In 1455, Pope Nicholas V issued the bull &quot;Romanus Pontifex&quot; reinforcing the previous &quot;Dum Diversas&quot; (1452), granting all lands and seas discovered beyond Cape Bojador to King Afonso V of Portugal and his successors, as well as mostly cutting off trade to and permitting conquest and increased war against Muslims and pagans, initiating a &quot;mare clausum&quot; policy in the Atlantic. The king, who had been inquiring of Genoese experts about a seaway to India, commissioned the Fra Mauro world map, which arrived in Lisbon in 1459. In 1456, Diogo Gomes reached the Cape Verde archipelago. In the next decade captains at the service of Prince Henry, discovered the remaining islands which were occupied during the 15th century. The Gulf of Guinea would be reached in the 1460s.

==== Portuguese exploration after Prince Henry ====
In 1460, Pedro de Sintra reached Sierra Leone. Prince Henry died in November of that year after which, given the meagre revenues, exploration was granted to Lisbon merchant Fernão Gomes in 1469, who in exchange for the monopoly of trade in the Gulf of Guinea had to explore each year for five years. With his sponsorship, explorers João de Santarém, Pedro Escobar, Lopo Gonçalves, Fernão do Pó, and Pedro de Sintra made it beyond those goals. They reached the Southern Hemisphere and islands of the Gulf of Guinea, including São Tomé and Príncipe and Elmina on the Gold Coast in 1471. There, in what came to be called the &quot;Gold Coast&quot; in what is today Ghana, a thriving alluvial gold trade was found among the natives, Arab and Berber traders.

In 1478, during the War of the Castilian Succession, near the coast at Elmina a large battle was fought between a Castilian armada of 35 caravels, and a Portuguese fleet for the hegemony of the Guinea trade (gold, slaves, ivory, and malagueta pepper). The war ended with a Portuguese naval victory, followed by the official recognition by the Catholic Monarchs of Portuguese sovereignty over most of the disputed West African territories embodied in the Treaty of Alcáçovas, 1479. This was the first colonial war among European powers.

In 1481, João II decided to build São Jorge da Mina factory. In 1482 the Congo River was explored by Diogo Cão, who in 1486 continued to Cape Cross (modern Namibia).
The next crucial breakthrough was in 1488, when Bartolomeu Dias rounded the southern tip of Africa, which he named Cabo das Tormentas, &quot;Cape of Storms&quot;, anchoring at Mossel Bay and then sailing east as far as the mouth of the Great Fish River, proving the Indian Ocean was accessible from the Atlantic. Simultaneously Pero da Covilhã, sent out travelling secretly overland, had reached Ethiopia having collected important information about the Red Sea and Quenia coast, suggesting a sea route to the Indies would soon be forthcoming. Soon the cape was renamed by King John II of Portugal the &quot;Cape of Good Hope&quot;, because of the great optimism engendered by the possibility of a sea route to India, proving false the view that had existed since Ptolemy that the Indian Ocean was land-locked.

Based on many later stories of the phantom island known as Bacalao and the carvings on Dighton Rock some have speculated that Portuguese explorer João Vaz Corte-Real discovered Newfoundland in 1473, but the sources are considered unreliable.

===Spanish exploration: Columbus&#x27;s landfall in the Americas===

Portugal&#x27;s Iberian rival, Castile, had begun to establish its rule over the Canary Islands in 1402 but became distracted by internal Iberian politics and the repelling of Islamic invasion attempts and raids through most of the 15th century. Late in the century, following the unification of the crowns of Castile and Aragon, an emerging modern Spain became fully committed to the search for new trade routes overseas. The Crown of Aragon had been an important maritime power in the Mediterranean, controlling territories in eastern Spain, southwestern France, major islands like Sicily, Malta, and the Kingdom of Naples and Sardinia, with mainland possessions as far as Greece. In 1492 the joint rulers conquered the Moorish kingdom of Granada, which had been providing Castile with African goods through tribute, and decided to fund Christopher Columbus&#x27;s expedition in the hope of bypassing Portugal&#x27;s monopoly on west African sea routes, to reach &quot;the Indies&quot; (east and south Asia) by travelling west. Twice before, in 1485 and 1488, Columbus had presented the project to the king John II of Portugal, who rejected it.

On the evening of 3 August 1492, Columbus departed from Palos de la Frontera. The land was sighted on 12 October 1492, and Columbus called the island (one of the islands now comprising The Bahamas) &quot;San Salvador&quot;, in what he thought to be the &quot;East Indies&quot;. Columbus explored the northeast coast of Cuba and the northern coast of Hispaniola, by 5 December. He was received by the native cacique Guacanagari, who gave him permission to leave some of his men behind.
 Columbus left 39 men and founded the settlement of &quot;La Navidad&quot; in what is now Haiti. Before returning to Spain, he kidnapped some ten to twenty-five natives and took them back with him. Only seven or eight of the native &#x27;Indians&#x27; arrived in Spain alive, but they made an impression on Seville. On 15 March 1493 he arrived in Barcelona, where he reported to Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand. Word of his discovery of new lands rapidly spread throughout Europe.

Columbus and other Spanish explorers were initially disappointed with their discoveries—unlike Africa or Asia, the Caribbean islanders had little to trade with the Castilian ships. The islands thus became the focus of colonization efforts. It was not until the continent itself was explored that Spain found the wealth it had sought.

===Treaty of Tordesillas (1494)===

Shortly after Columbus&#x27;s return from what would later be called the &quot;West Indies&quot;, a division of influence became necessary to avoid conflict between the Spanish and Portuguese. On 4 May 1493, two months after Columbus&#x27;s arrival, the Catholic Monarchs received a bull (&quot;Inter caetera&quot;) from Pope Alexander VI stating all lands west and south of a pole-to-pole line 100 leagues west and south of the Azores or the Cape Verde Islands should belong to Castile and, later, all mainlands and islands then belonging to India. It did not mention Portugal, which could not claim newly discovered lands east of the line.

King John II of Portugal was displeased with the arrangement, feeling that it gave him far too little land—preventing him from reaching India, his main goal. He then negotiated directly with King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain to move the line west, allowing him to claim newly discovered lands east of it. In 1494, the Treaty of Tordesillas divided the world between Portugal and Spain. Portugal gained control over Africa, Asia, and eastern South America (Brazil), encompassing everything outside Europe east of a line drawn 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands (already Portuguese). The Spanish (Castile) received everything west of this line, including the islands discovered by Columbus on his first voyage, named in the treaty as Cipangu and Antilia (Cuba and Hispaniola). The dividing line, situated about halfway between Portuguese Cape Verde and Spanish discoveries in the Caribbean, split the known world of Atlantic islands evenly.

In 1500, Pedro Álvares Cabral, initially considering the Brazilian coast as a large island, claimed it for Portugal east of the dividing line. This claim was acknowledged by the Spanish. Cabral, heading towards India, followed a corridor in the Atlantic negotiated by the treaty for favorable winds. While some speculate earlier secret Portuguese discovery of Brazil, there is no credible evidence for this. Similarly, suspicions about Duarte Pacheco Pereira alleged 1498 discovery lack credibility among historians.

Later the Spanish territory would prove to include huge areas of the continental mainland of North and South America, though Portuguese-controlled Brazil would expand across the line, and settlements by other European powers ignored the treaty.

===The Americas: The New World===

Little of the divided area had actually been seen by Europeans, as it was only divided by a geographical definition rather than control on the ground. The desire to compete with the Ottoman Empire and Columbus&#x27;s first voyage in 1492 spurred further maritime exploration and, from 1497, several other explorers headed west.

====North America====
That year John Cabot (), also a commissioned Italian, got letters patent from King Henry VII of England. Sailing from Bristol, probably backed by the local Society of Merchant Venturers, Cabot crossed the Atlantic from a northerly latitude hoping the voyage to the &quot;West Indies&quot; would be shorter and made landfall somewhere in North America, possibly Newfoundland.

In 1499 João Fernandes Lavrador was licensed by the King of Portugal and together with Pero de Barcelos they first sighted Labrador, which was granted and named after him. After returning he possibly went to Bristol to sail in the name of England.

Between 1499 and 1502 the brothers Gaspar and Miguel Corte Real explored and named the coasts of Greenland and Newfoundland. Both explorations are noted in the 1502 Cantino planisphere.

====The &quot;True Indies&quot; and Brazil====
In 1497, newly crowned King Manuel I of Portugal sent an exploratory fleet eastwards, fulfilling his predecessor&#x27;s project of finding a route to the Indies. In July 1499, news spread that the Portuguese had reached the &quot;true Indies&quot;, as a letter was dispatched by the Portuguese king to the Spanish Catholic Monarchs.

The third expedition by Columbus in 1498 was the beginning of the first successful Castilian (Spanish) colonization in the West Indies, on the island of Hispaniola. Despite growing doubts, Columbus refused to accept he had not reached the Indies. During the voyage he discovered the mouth of the Orinoco River on the north coast of South America (now Venezuela) and thought that the huge quantity of fresh water coming from it could only be from a continental land mass, which he was certain was the Asian mainland.

As shipping between Seville and the West Indies grew, knowledge of the Caribbean islands, Central America and the northern coast of South America increased. One of these Spanish fleets, that of Alonso de Ojeda and Amerigo Vespucci in 1499–1500 reached land at the coast of what is now Guyana, where the two explorers seem to have separated in opposite directions. Vespucci sailed southward, discovering the mouth of the Amazon River in July 1499, and reaching 6°S, in present-day north east Brazil, before turning around.

In the beginning of 1500, Vicente Yáñez Pinzon was blown off course by a storm and reached what is now the northeast coast of Brazil on 26 January 1500, exploring as far south as the present-day state of Pernambuco. His fleet was the first to fully enter the Amazon River estuary, which he named &quot;Río Santa María de la Mar Dulce&quot; (&quot;Saint Mary&#x27;s River of the Freshwater Sea&quot;). The land was too far east for the Castilians to claim under the Treaty of Tordesillas, but the discovery created Castilian interest, with a second voyage by Pinzon in 1508 (the Pinzón–Solís voyage, which navigated the northern coast to the Central American mainland in search of a passage to the East) and a voyage in 1515–16 by a navigator of the 1508 expedition, Juan Díaz de Solís. The 1515–16 expedition was spurred on by reports of Portuguese exploration of the region (see below). It ended when de Solís and some of his crew disappeared when exploring the River Plata in a boat, but what they found reignited Spanish interest, and colonization began in 1531.

In April 1500, the second Portuguese India Armada, headed by Pedro Álvares Cabral, with a crew of expert captains, encountered the Brazilian coast as it swung westward in the Atlantic while performing a large &quot;volta do mar&quot; to avoid becalming in the Gulf of Guinea. On 21 April 1500, a mountain was seen and named &quot;Monte Pascoal&quot;, and on 22 April Cabral landed on the coast. On 25 April, the entire fleet sailed into the harbour they named &quot;Porto Seguro&quot; (Port Secure). Cabral perceived that the new land lay east of the line of Tordesillas, and sent an envoy to Portugal with the discovery in letters, including the letter of Pero Vaz de Caminha. Believing the land to be an island, he named it Ilha de Vera Cruz (Island of the True Cross). Some historians have suggested that the Portuguese may have encountered the South American bulge earlier while sailing the &quot;volta do mar&quot;, hence the insistence of John II in moving the line west of Tordesillas in 1494—so his landing in Brazil may not have been an accident; although John&#x27;s motivation may have just been to claiming new lands in the Atlantic easier. From the east coast, the fleet then turned eastward to resume the journey to the southern tip of Africa and India. Cabral was the first captain to touch four continents, leading the first expedition that connected and united Europe, Africa, the New World, and Asia.

At the invitation of King Manuel I of Portugal, Amerigo Vespucci participated as an observer in these exploratory voyages to the east coast of South America. The expeditions became widely known in Europe after two accounts attributed to him, published between 1502 and 1504, suggested the newly discovered lands were not the Indies but a &quot;New World&quot;, the &quot;Mundus novus&quot;; this is also the Latin title of a contemporary document based on Vespucci letters to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de&#x27; Medici, which had become popular in Europe. It was soon understood that Columbus had not reached Asia but found a new continent, the Americas. The Americas were named in 1507 by cartographers Martin Waldseemüller and Matthias Ringmann, after Amerigo Vespucci.

From 1501 to 1502, one of these Portuguese expeditions, led by Gonçalo Coelho (and/or André Gonçalves or Gaspar de Lemos), sailed south along the coast of South America to the bay of present-day Rio de Janeiro. Vespucci&#x27;s account states that the expedition reached the latitude &quot;South Pole elevation 52° S&quot;, in the &quot;cold&quot; latitudes of what is now southern Patagonia, before turning back. Vespucci wrote that they headed toward the southwest and south, following &quot;a long, unbending coastline&quot;, apparently coincident with the southern South American coast. This seems controversial, since he changed part of his description in the subsequent letter, stating a shift, from about 32° S (Southern Brazil) to the south-southeast, to open sea, maintaining that they reached 50°/52° S.

In 1503, Binot Paulmier de Gonneville, challenging the Portuguese policy of &quot;mare clausum&quot;, led one of the earliest French Normand and Breton expeditions to Brazil. He intended to sail to the East Indies, but near the Cape of Good Hope, his ship was diverted to the west by a storm, and landed in the present-day state of Santa Catarina (southern Brazil), on 5 January 1504.
From 1511 to 1512, Portuguese captains João de Lisboa and Estevão de Fróis reached the River Plata estuary in present-day Uruguay and Argentina, and went as far south as the present-day Gulf of San Matias at 42°S. The expedition reached a cape extending north to south which they called Cape of &quot;Santa Maria&quot; (Punta del Este, keeping the name the Cape nearby); and after 40°S they found a &quot;Cape&quot; or &quot;a point or place extending into the sea&quot;, and a &quot;Gulf&quot; (in June and July). After they had navigated for nearly to round the cape, they again sighted the continent on the other side and steered towards the northwest, but a storm prevented them from making any headway. Driven away by the &quot;Tramontane&quot; or north wind, they retraced their course. Also gives the first news of the &quot;White King&quot; and the &quot;people of the mountains&quot; to the interior (the Inca Empire), and a gift, an ax of silver, obtained from the Charrúa natives on their return (&quot;to the coast or side of &quot;Brazil&quot;&quot;), and &quot;to West&quot; (along the coast and the River Plata estuary), and offered to King Manuel I. Christopher de Haro, a Flemish of Sephardic origin (one of the financiers of the expedition along with D. Nuno Manuel), who would serve the Spanish Crown after 1516, believed the navigators had discovered a southern &quot;strait&quot; to west and Asia.

In 1519, an expedition sent by the Spanish Crown to find a way to Asia was led by the experienced Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan. The fleet explored the rivers and bays as it charted the South American coast until it found a way to the Pacific Ocean through the Strait of Magellan.

From 1524 to 1525, Aleixo Garcia, a Portuguese conquistador, led a private expedition of shipwrecked Castilian and Portuguese adventurers, who recruited about 2,000 Guaraní Indians. They explored the territories of present-day southern Brazil, Paraguay, and Bolivia, using the native trail network, the &quot;Peabiru&quot;. They were the first Europeans to cross the Chaco and reach the outer territories of the Inca Empire on the hills of the Andes.

==Indian Ocean (1497–1513)==

===Vasco da Gama&#x27;s route to India===

Protected from direct Spanish competition by the Treaty of Tordesillas, Portuguese eastward exploration and colonization continued apace. Twice, in 1485 and 1488, Portugal officially rejected Genoese Christopher Columbus&#x27;s idea of reaching India by sailing westwards. King John II of Portugal&#x27;s experts rejected it, for they held the opinion that Columbus&#x27;s estimation of a travel distance of was low, and in part because Bartolomeu Dias departed in 1487 trying the rounding of the southern tip of Africa. They believed that sailing east would require a far shorter journey. Dias&#x27;s return from the Cape of Good Hope in 1488, and Pero da Covilhã&#x27;s travel to Ethiopia overland indicated that the richness of the Indian Ocean was accessible from the Atlantic. A long-overdue expedition was prepared.

In July 1497, a small exploratory fleet of four ships and about 170 men left Lisbon under the command of Vasco da Gama. By December the fleet passed the Great Fish River—where Dias had turned back—and sailed into waters unknown to the Europeans. Sailing into the Indian Ocean, da Gama entered a maritime region that had three different and well-developed trade circuits. The one da Gama encountered connected Mogadishu on the east coast of Africa; Aden, at the tip of the Arabian peninsula; the Persian port of Hormuz; Cambay, in northwestern India; and Calicut, in southwestern India. On 20 May 1498, they arrived at Calicut. The efforts of Vasco da Gama to get favorable trading conditions were hampered by the low value of their goods, compared with the valuable goods traded there. Two years and two days after departure, Gama and a survivor crew of 55 men returned in glory to Portugal as the first ships to sail directly from Europe to India. Da Gama&#x27;s voyage is romanticized in the Os Lusíadas, an epic poem by fellow discovery-era traveler Luís de Camões. The poem is widely regarded as Portugal&#x27;s greatest literary achievement.

In 1500, a second, larger fleet of thirteen ships and about 1500 men were sent to India. Under the command of Pedro Álvares Cabral, they made the first landfall on the Brazilian coast, giving Portugal its claim. Later, in the Indian Ocean, one of Cabral&#x27;s ships reached Madagascar (1501), which was partly explored by Tristão da Cunha in 1507; Mauritius was discovered in 1507, Socotra occupied in 1506. In the same year Lourenço de Almeida landed in Sri Lanka, the eastern island named &quot;Taprobane&quot; in remote accounts of Alexander the Great&#x27;s and 4th-century BC Greek geographer Megasthenes. On the Asiatic mainland, the first factories (trading-posts) were established at Kochi and Calicut (1501) and then Goa (1510).
===The &quot;Spice Islands&quot; and China===
The Portuguese continued sailing eastward from India, entering a second existing circuit of the Indian Ocean trade, from Calicut and Quillon in India, to southeast Asia, including Malacca, and Palembang. In 1511, Afonso de Albuquerque conquered Malacca for Portugal, then the center of Asian trade. East of Malacca, Albuquerque sent several diplomatic missions: Duarte Fernandes as the first European envoy to the Kingdom of Siam (modern Thailand).

Learning the location of the so-called &quot;spice islands&quot;, heretofore a secret from the Europeans, were the Maluku Islands, mainly the Banda, then the world&#x27;s only source of nutmeg and cloves. Reaching these was the main purpose for the Portuguese voyages in the Indian Ocean. Albuquerque sent an expedition led by António de Abreu to Banda (via Java and the Lesser Sunda Islands), where they were the first Europeans to arrive in early 1512, after taking a route through which they also reached first the islands of Buru, Ambon and Seram. From Banda Abreu returned to Malacca, while his vice-captain Francisco Serrão, after a separation forced by a shipwreck and heading north, reached once again Ambon and sank off Ternate, where he obtained a license to build a Portuguese fortress-factory: the Fort of São João Baptista de Ternate, which founded the Portuguese presence in the Malay Archipelago.

In May 1513 Jorge Álvares, one of the Portuguese envoys, reached China. Although he was the first to land on Lintin Island in the Pearl River Delta, it was Rafael Perestrello—a cousin of the famed Christopher Columbus—who became the first European explorer to land on the southern coast of mainland China and trade in Guangzhou in 1516, commanding a Portuguese vessel with crew from a Malaccan junk that had sailed from Malacca. Fernão Pires de Andrade visited Canton in 1517 and opened up trade with China. The Portuguese were defeated by the Chinese in 1521 at the Battle of Tunmen and in 1522 at the Battle of Xicaowan, during which the Chinese captured Portuguese breech-loading swivel guns and reverse engineered the technology, calling them &quot;Folangji&quot; 佛郎機 (Frankish) guns, since the Portuguese were called &quot;Folangji&quot; by the Chinese. After a few decades, hostilities between the Portuguese and Chinese ceased and in 1557 the Chinese allowed the Portuguese to occupy Macau.

To enforce a trade monopoly, Muscat and Hormuz in the Persian Gulf were seized by Afonso de Albuquerque in 1507 and in 1515, respectively. He also entered into diplomatic relations with Persia. In 1513, while trying to conquer Aden, an expedition led by Albuquerque cruised the Red Sea inside the Bab al-Mandab and sheltered at Kamaran island. In 1521, a force under António Correia conquered Bahrain, ushering in a period of almost eighty years of Portuguese rule of the Gulf archipelago. In the Red Sea, Massawa was the most northerly point frequented by the Portuguese until 1541, when a fleet under Estevão da Gama penetrated as far as Suez.

==Pacific Ocean (1513–1529)==
===Balboa&#x27;s expedition to the Pacific Ocean===
In 1513, about south of Acandí, in present-day Colombia, Spanish Vasco Núñez de Balboa heard unexpected news of an &quot;other sea&quot; rich in gold, which he received with great interest. With few resources and using information given by &quot;caciques&quot;, he journeyed across the Isthmus of Panama with 190 Spaniards, a few native guides, and a pack of dogs.

Balboa, using a brigantine and ten native canoe, explored the coast, facing battles and dense jungles. On September 25, after crossing the Chucunaque River mountains, he became the first European to see the Pacific Ocean from the New World. The expedition briefly navigated the Pacific, naming the bay &quot;San Miguel&quot; and the sea &quot; Mar del Sur&quot; (South Sea). Seeking gold, Balboa traversed cacique lands to the islands, naming the largest Isla Rica (now Isla del Rey) and the group &quot;Archipiélago de las Perlas&quot;, names still in use today.

===Subsequent developments to the east===
From 1515 to 1516, the Spanish fleet led by Juan Díaz de Solís sailed down the east coast of South America as far as Río de la Plata, which Solís named shortly before he died while trying to find a passage to the &quot;South Sea&quot;.

===First circumnavigation===

By 1516, several Portuguese navigators conflicting with King Manuel I of Portugal gathered in Seville to serve the newly crowned Charles I of Spain. Among them were explorers Diogo and Duarte Barbosa, Estêvão Gomes, João Serrão and Ferdinand Magellan, cartographers Jorge Reinel and Diogo Ribeiro, cosmographers Francisco and Ruy Faleiro and the Flemish merchant Christopher de Haro. Ferdinand Magellan had sailed in India for Portugal up to 1513, when the Maluku Islands were reached, and had kept contact with Francisco Serrão who was living there. Magellan developed the theory that the Maluku Islands were in the Tordesillas Spanish area, based on studies by Faleiro brothers.

Aware of the efforts of the Spanish to find a route to India by sailing west, Magellan presented his plan to Charles I of Spain. The king and Christopher de Haro financed Magellan&#x27;s expedition. A fleet was put together, and Spanish navigators such as Juan Sebastián Elcano joined the enterprise. On August 10, 1519, they departed from Seville with a fleet of five ships—the caravel flagship &quot;Trinidad&quot; under Magellan&#x27;s command, and carracks &quot;San Antonio&quot;, &quot;Concepcion&quot;, &quot;Santiago&quot; and &quot;Victoria&quot;. They contained a crew of about 237 European men from several regions, with the goal of reaching the Maluku Islands by travelling west, trying to reclaim it under Spain&#x27;s economic and political sphere.
The fleet sailed south, avoiding Portuguese Brazil, and became the first to reach Tierra del Fuego. Starting on October 21, they navigated the 373-mile (600 km) Strait of Magellan, entering the Pacific on November 28, which Magellan named Mar Pacífico for its calm waters. After crossing the Pacific, Magellan was killed in the battle of Mactan in the Philippines. Juan Sebastián Elcano completed the voyage, reaching the Spice Islands in 1521. On September 6, 1522, the &quot;Victoria&quot; returned to Spain, completing the first circumnavigation of the globe. Of the original crew, only 18 men completed the circumnavigation; 17 returned later, including twelve captured by the Portuguese and five survivors of the Trinidad. Antonio Pigafetta, a Venetian scholar, kept a detailed journal that is a key source of information about the voyage.

This round-the-world voyage gave Spain valuable knowledge of the world and its oceans which later helped in the exploration and settlement of the Philippines. Although this was not a realistic alternative to the Portuguese route around Africa (the Strait of Magellan was too far south, and the Pacific Ocean too vast to cover in a single trip from Spain) successive Spanish expeditions used this information to explore the Pacific Ocean and discovered routes that opened up trade between Acapulco, New Spain (present-day Mexico) and Manila in the Philippines.

===Westward and eastward exploration meet===
Soon after Magellan&#x27;s expedition, the Portuguese rushed to seize the surviving crew and built a fort in Ternate. In 1525, Charles I of Spain sent another expedition westward to colonize the Maluku Islands, claiming that they were in his zone of the Treaty of Tordesillas. The fleet of seven ships and 450 men was led by García Jofre de Loaísa and included the most notable Spanish navigators: Juan Sebastián Elcano and Loaísa, who died then, and the young Andrés de Urdaneta.

Near the Strait of Magellan one of the ships was pushed south by a storm, reaching 56° S, where they thought seeing &quot;earth&#x27;s end&quot;: so Cape Horn was crossed for the first time. The expedition reached the islands with great difficulty, docking at Tidore. The conflict with the Portuguese established in nearby Ternate was inevitable, starting nearly a decade of skirmishes.

As there was not a set eastern limit to the Tordesillas line, both kingdoms organized meetings to resolve the issue. From 1524 to 1529, Portuguese and Spanish experts met at Badajoz-Elvas trying to find the exact location of the antimeridian of Tordesillas, which would divide the world into two equal hemispheres. Each crown appointed three astronomers and cartographers, three pilots, and three mathematicians. Lopo Homem, Portuguese cartographer and cosmographer was on the board, along with cartographer Diogo Ribeiro of the Spanish delegation. The board met several times without reaching an agreement: the knowledge at that time was insufficient for an accurate calculation of longitude, and each group gave the islands to its sovereign. The issue was settled only in 1529, after a long negotiation, with the signing of Treaty of Zaragoza, which allocated the Maluku Islands to Portugal and the Philippines to Spain.

From 1525 to 1528, Portugal sent several expeditions around the Maluku Islands. Gomes de Sequeira and Diogo da Rocha were sent north by the governor of Ternate Jorge de Menezes, being the first Europeans to reach the Caroline Islands, which they named &quot;Islands de Sequeira&quot;. In 1526, Jorge de Meneses docked on Biak and Waigeo islands, Papua New Guinea. Based on these explorations stands the theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia, one among several competing theories about the early discovery of Australia, supported by Australian historian Kenneth McIntyre, stating it was discovered by Cristóvão de Mendonça and Gomes de Sequeira.

In 1527, Hernán Cortés fitted out a fleet to find new lands in the &quot;South Sea&quot; (Pacific Ocean), asking his cousin Álvaro de Saavedra Cerón to take charge. On 31 October 1527, Saavedra sailed from New Spain, crossing the Pacific and touring the north of New Guinea, then named &quot;Isla de Oro&quot;. In October 1528, one of the vessels reached the Maluku Islands. In his attempt to return to New Spain he was diverted by the northeast trade winds, which threw him back, so he tried sailing back down, to the south. He returned to New Guinea and sailed northeast, where he sighted the Marshall Islands and the Admiralty Islands, but again was surprised by the winds, which brought him a third time to the Moluccas. This westbound return route was hard to find but was eventually discovered by Andrés de Urdaneta in 1565.

==Inland Spanish expeditions (1519–1532)==
Rumors of undiscovered islands northwest of Hispaniola reached Spain by 1511, ushering King Ferdinand&#x27;s interest in forestalling further exploration. While the Portuguese were making huge gains in the Indian Ocean, the Spanish invested in exploring inland in search of gold and other valuable resources. The members of these expeditions, the &quot;conquistadors&quot;, were not soldiers in an army, but more like soldiers of fortune; they came from a variety of backgrounds including artisans, merchants, clergy, lawyers, lesser nobility and a few freed slaves. They usually supplied their own equipment or were extended credit to purchase it in exchange for a share in profits. They usually had no professional military training, but a number of them had previous experience on other expeditions.

In the Americas, the Spanish encountered large indigenous empires and formed alliances with indigenous people through small expeditions. After establishing Spanish sovereignty and discovering wealth, the crown focused on implementing Spanish state and church institutions. A key element was the &#x27;spiritual conquest&#x27; through Christian evangelization. The initial economy relied on a tribute and forced labor under the &quot;encomienda&quot; system. The discovery of vast silver deposits transformed both the colonial economies of Mexico and Peru and Spain&#x27;s economy. With global trade networks and valuable American crops, Spain&#x27;s economy strengthened, enhancing its status as a world power.

During this time, pandemics of European diseases such as smallpox decimated the indigenous populations.

In 1512, to reward Juan Ponce de León for exploring Puerto Rico in 1508, King Ferdinand urged him to seek these new lands. He would become governor of discovered lands but was to finance himself all exploration. With three ships and about 200 men, Léon set out from Puerto Rico in March 1513. In April they sighted land and named it &quot;La Florida&quot;—because it was Easter (Florida) season—believing it was an island, becoming credited as the first European to land in the continent. The arrival location has been disputed between St. Augustine, Ponce de León Inlet and Melbourne Beach. They headed south for further exploration and on April 8 encountered a current so strong that it pushed them backward: this was the first encounter with the Gulf Stream that would soon become the primary route for eastbound ships leaving the Spanish Indies bound for Europe. They explored down the coast reaching Biscayne Bay, Dry Tortugas and then sailing southwest in an attempt to circle Cuba to return, reaching Grand Bahama on July.

===Cortés&#x27; Mexico and the Aztec Empire===

In 1517, Cuba&#x27;s governor Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar commissioned a fleet under the command of Hernández de Córdoba to explore the Yucatán peninsula. They reached the coast where Mayans invited them to land. They were attacked at night and only a remnant of the crew returned. Velázquez then commissioned another expedition led by his nephew Juan de Grijalva, who sailed south along the coast to Tabasco, part of the Aztec empire.

In 1518, Velázquez gave the mayor of the capital of Cuba, Hernán Cortés, the command of an expedition to secure the interior of Mexico but, due to an old gripe between them, revoked the charter. In February 1519, Cortés went ahead anyway, in an act of open mutiny. With about 11 ships, 500 men, 13 horses and a small number of cannons he landed in Yucatán, in Mayan territory, claiming the land for the Spanish crown. From Trinidad he proceeded to Tabasco and won a battle against the natives. Among the vanquished was Marina (La Malinche), his future mistress, who knew both (Aztec) Nahuatl language and Maya, becoming a valuable interpreter and counsellor. Cortés learned about the wealthy Aztec Empire through La Malinche,

In July, his men took over Veracruz and he placed himself under direct orders of new king Charles I of Spain. There Cortés asked for a meeting with Aztec Emperor Montezuma II, who repeatedly refused. They headed to Tenochtitlan and on the way made alliances with several tribes. In October, accompanied by about 3,000 Tlaxcaltec they marched to Cholula, the second largest city in central Mexico. Either to instill fear upon the Aztecs waiting for him or (as he later claimed) wishing to make an example when he feared native treachery, they massacred thousands of unarmed members of the nobility gathered at the central plaza and partially burned the city.
On November 8, Cortés and his large army were welcomed by Moctezuma II in Tenochtitlan, who hoped to learn about them to eventually defeat them. Moctezuma gave lavish gifts, which led Cortés to plunder the city. Cortés claimed the Aztecs saw him as an emissary or incarnation of the god Quetzalcoatl, though this is contested by few historians. Upon learning that his men had been attacked on the coast, Cortés took Moctezuma hostage in his palace, demanding tribute for King Charles.

Meanwhile, Velasquez sent another expedition, led by Pánfilo de Narváez, to oppose Cortès, arriving in Mexico in April 1520 with 1,100 men. Cortés left 200 men in Tenochtitlan and took the rest to confront Narvaez, whom he overcame, convincing his men to join him. In Tenochtitlán one of Cortés&#x27;s lieutenants committed a massacre in the Great Temple, triggering local rebellion. Cortés speedily returned, attempting the support of Moctezuma but the Aztec emperor was killed, possibly stoned by his subjects. The Spanish fled for the Tlaxcaltec during the &quot;Noche Triste&quot;, where they managed a narrow escape while their back guard was massacred. Much of the treasure looted was lost during this panicked escape. After a battle in Otumba they reached Tlaxcala, having lost 870 men. Having prevailed with the assistance of allies and reinforcements from Cuba, Cortés besieged Tenochtitlán and captured its ruler Cuauhtémoc in August 1521. As the Aztec Empire ended he claimed the city for Spain, renaming it Mexico City.

===Pizarro&#x27;s Peru and the Inca Empire===

A first attempt to explore western South America was undertaken in 1522 by Pascual de Andagoya. Native South Americans told him about a gold-rich territory on a river called Pirú. Having reached San Juan River (Colombia), Andagoya fell ill and returned to Panama, where he spread the news about &quot;Pirú&quot; as the legendary El Dorado. These, along with the accounts of the success of Hernán Cortés, caught the attention of Pizarro.

Francisco Pizarro had accompanied Balboa in the crossing of the Isthmus of Panama. In 1524 he formed a partnership with priest Hernando de Luque and soldier Diego de Almagro to explore the south, agreeing to divide the profits. They dubbed the enterprise the &quot;Empresa del Levante&quot;: Pizarro would command, Almagro would provide military and food supplies, and Luque would be in charge of finances and additional provisions.

On 13 September 1524, the first of three expeditions set out to conquer Peru with 80 men and 40 horses. The venture failed, halting in Colombia due to bad weather, hunger, and conflicts with locals; Almagro lost an eye. Their route was marked by &quot;Puerto Deseado&quot; (desired port), &quot;Puerto del Hambre&quot; (port of hunger), and &quot;Puerto quemado&quot; (burned port). Two years later, a second expedition began with reluctant permission from the Governor of Panama. In August 1526, they departed with two ships, 160 men, and horses. Upon reaching the San Juan River, Pizarro explored swampy coasts, while Almagro sought reinforcements. Pizarro&#x27;s pilot, sailing south and crossing the equator, captured a raft from Tumbes. To his surprise, the raft carried coveted textiles, ceramics, gold, silver, and emeralds, becoming the expedition&#x27;s main focus. Almagro later joined with reinforcements, and despite challenging conditions, they reached Atacames, where a sizable native population under Inca rule was observed, though they did not land.

Pizarro, safe near the coast, sent Almagro and Luque for reinforcements with proof if the rumoured gold. The new governor rejected a third expedition, ordering everyone back to Panama. Almagro and Luque seized the chance to rejoin Pizarro. At &quot;Isla de Gallo&quot;, Pizarro drew a line, presenting the choice between Peru&#x27;s riches and Panama&#x27;s poverty. Thirteen men, The Famous Thirteen, stayed and headed to &quot;La Isla Gorgona&quot;, staying seven months until provisions arrived.

They sailed south and by April 1528, reached northwestern Peru&#x27;s Tumbes Region, warmly received by the &quot;Tumpis&quot;. Pizarro&#x27;s men reported incredible riches, llama sightings, and the natives named them &quot;Children of the Sun&quot; for their fair complexion and brilliant armour. They decided to return to Panama to prepare a final expedition, sailing south through named territories like Cabo Blanco, port of Payta, Sechura, Punta de Aguja, Santa Cruz, and Trujillo, reaching the ninth degree south.

In the spring of 1528, Pizarro sailed for Spain, where he had an interview with king Charles I. The king heard of his expeditions in lands rich in gold and silver and promised to support him. The &quot;Capitulación de Toledo&quot; authorized Pizarro to proceed with the conquest of Peru. Pizarro was then able to convince many friends and relatives to join: his brothers Hernándo Pizarro, Juan Pizarro, Gonzalo Pizarro and also Francisco de Orellana, who would later explore the Amazon River, as well as his cousin Pedro Pizarro.

Pizarro&#x27;s third and final expedition left Panama for Peru on 27 December 1530. With three ships and one hundred and eighty men, they landed near Ecuador and sailed to Tumbes, finding the place destroyed. They entered the interior and established the first Spanish settlement in Peru, San Miguel de Piura. One of the men returned with an Incan envoy and an invitation for a meeting. Since the last meeting, the Inca had begun a civil war and Atahualpa had been resting in northern Peru following the defeat of his brother Huáscar. After marching for two months, they approached Atahualpa. He refused the Spanish, saying he would be &quot;no man&#x27;s tributary&quot;. There were fewer than 200 Spanish to his 80,000 soldiers, but Pizarro attacked and won the Incan army in the Battle of Cajamarca, taking Atahualpa captive at the so-called ransom room. Despite fulfilling his promise of filling one room with gold and two with silver, he was convicted for killing his brother and plotting against Pizarro, and was executed.

In 1533, Pizarro invaded Cuzco with indigenous troops and wrote to King Charles I: &quot;This city is the greatest and the finest ever seen in this country or anywhere in the Indies ... it is so beautiful and has such fine buildings that it would be remarkable even in Spain.&quot; After the Spanish had sealed the conquest of Peru, Jauja in fertile Mantaro Valley was established as Peru&#x27;s provisional capital, but it was too far up in the mountains, and Pizarro founded the city of Lima on 18 January 1535, which Pizarro considered one of the most important acts in his life.

==Major new trade routes (1542–1565)==
In 1543, three Portuguese traders accidentally became the first Westerners to reach and trade with Japan. According to Fernão Mendes Pinto, who claimed to be in this journey, they arrived at Tanegashima, where the locals were impressed by firearms that would be immediately made by the Japanese on a large scale.

The Spanish conquest of the Philippines was ordered by Philip II of Spain, and Andrés de Urdaneta was the designated commander. Urdaneta agreed to accompany the expedition but refused to command and Miguel López de Legazpi was appointed instead. The expedition set sail on November 1564. After spending some time on the islands, Legazpi sent Urdaneta back to find a better return route. Urdaneta set sail from San Miguel on the island of Cebu on 1 June 1565, but was obliged to sail as far as 38 degrees North latitude to obtain favorable winds.
He reasoned that the trade winds of the Pacific might move in a gyre as the Atlantic winds did. If in the Atlantic, ships made the &quot;Volta do mar&quot; to pick up winds that would bring them back from Madeira, then, he reasoned, by sailing far to the north before heading east, he would pick up trade winds to bring him back to North America. His hunch paid off, and he hit the coast near Cape Mendocino, California, then followed the coast south. The ship reached the port of Acapulco, on 8 October 1565, having traveled in 130 days. Fourteen of his crew died; only Urdaneta and Felipe de Salcedo, nephew of López de Legazpi, had strength enough to cast the anchors.

Thus, a cross-Pacific Spanish route was established, between Mexico and the Philippines. For a long time, these routes were used by the Manila galleons, thereby creating a trade link joining China, the Americas, and Europe via the combined trans-Pacific and trans-Atlantic routes.

==Northern European involvement (1595–17th century)==
European nations outside Iberia did not recognize the Treaty of Tordesillas between Portugal and Castile, nor did they recognize Pope Alexander VI&#x27;s donation of the Spanish finds in the New World. France, the Netherlands and England each had a long maritime tradition and had been engaging in privateering. Despite Iberian protections, the new technologies and maps soon made their way north.

After the marriage of Henry VIII of England and Catherine of Aragon failed to produce a male heir and Henry failed to obtain a papal dispensation to annul his marriage, he broke with the Roman Catholic Church and established himself as head of the Church of England. This added religious conflict to political conflict. When much of The Netherlands became Protestant, it sought political and religious independence from Catholic Spain. In 1568, the Dutch rebelled against the rule of Philip II of Spain leading to the Eighty Years&#x27; War. The war between England and Spain also broke out. In 1580, Philip II became King of Portugal, as heir to its Crown. Although he ruled Portugal and its empire as separate from the Spanish Empire, the union of the crowns produced a Catholic superpower, which England and the Netherlands challenged.

In the eighty-year Dutch War of Independence, Philip&#x27;s troops conquered the important trading cities of Bruges and Ghent. Antwerp, then the most important port in the world, fell in 1585. The Protestant population was given two years to settle affairs before leaving the city. Many settled in Amsterdam. Those were mainly skilled craftsmen, rich merchants of the port cities and refugees that fled religious persecution, particularly Sephardi Jews from Portugal and Spain and, later, the Huguenots from France. The Pilgrim Fathers also spent time there before going to the New World. This mass immigration was an important driving force: a small port in 1585, Amsterdam quickly transformed into one of the most important commercial centres in the world. After the failure of the Spanish Armada in 1588, there was a huge expansion of maritime trade even though the defeat of the English Armada would confirm the naval supremacy of the Spanish navy over the emergent competitors.

Dutch maritime power rose quickly as Dutch sailors, skilled in navigation and mapmaking, engaged with Portuguese voyages. In 1592, Cornelis de Houtman gathered information on the Spice Islands in Lisbon. The same year, Jan Huyghen van Linschoten published a detailed travel report in Amsterdam, providing navigation instructions for reaching the East Indies and Japan. Following this, Houtman led the Dutch&#x27;s first exploratory voyage, discovering a new route from Madagascar to the Sunda Strait and securing a treaty with the Banten Sultan. The Dutch also demonstrated their maritime strength by seizing Malacca from Portugal in 1641, following a series of battles that began in 1602.

Dutch and British interest, fed on new information, led to a movement of commercial expansion, and the foundation of English (1600), and Dutch (1602) chartered companies. Dutch, French, and English sent ships which flouted the Portuguese monopoly, concentrated mostly on the coastal areas, which proved unable to defend against such a vast and dispersed venture.

===Exploring North America===
The 1497 English expedition authorized by Henry VII of England was led by Italian Venetian John Cabot (Giovanni Caboto); it was the first of a series of French and English missions exploring North America. Mariners from the Italian peninsula played an important role in early explorations, most especially Genoese mariner Christopher Columbus. With its major conquests of central Mexico and Peru and discoveries of silver, Spain put limited efforts into exploring the northern part of the Americas; its resources were concentrated in Central and South America where more wealth had been found. These other European expeditions were initially motivated by the same idea as Columbus, namely a westerly shortcut to the Asian mainland. After the existence of &quot;another ocean&quot; (the Pacific) was confirmed by Balboa in 1513, there still remained the motivation of potentially finding an oceanic Northwest Passage for Asian trade. This was not discovered until the early twentieth century, but other possibilities were found, although nothing on the scale of the spectacular ones of the Spanish. In the early 17th century colonists from a number of Northern European states began to settle on the east coast of North America. Between 1520 and 1521, the Portuguese João Álvares Fagundes, accompanied by couples of mainland Portugal and the Azores, explored Newfoundland and Nova Scotia (possibly reaching the Bay of Fundy on the Minas Basin), and established a fishing colony on the Cape Breton Island that would last until at least the 1570s or near the end of the century.

In 1524, Italian Giovanni da Verrazzano sailed under the authority of Francis I of France, who was motivated by indignation over the division of the world between Portuguese and Spanish. Verrazzano explored the Atlantic Coast of North America, from South Carolina to Newfoundland, and was the first recorded European to visit what would later become the Virginia Colony and the United States. In the same year Estevão Gomes, a Portuguese cartographer who had sailed in Ferdinand Magellan&#x27;s fleet, explored Nova Scotia, sailing South through Maine, where he entered what is now New York Harbor, the Hudson River and eventually reached Florida in August 1525. As a result of his expedition, the 1529 Diogo Ribeiro world map outlines the East coast of North America almost perfectly. From 1534 to 1536, French explorer Jacques Cartier, believed to have accompanied Verrazzano to Nova Scotia and Brazil, was the first European to travel inland in North America, describing the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, which he named &quot;The Country of Canadas&quot;, after Iroquois names, claiming what is now Canada for Francis I of France.

Europeans explored the Pacific Coast beginning in the mid-16th century. Spaniards Francisco de Ulloa explored the Pacific coast of present-day Mexico including the Gulf of California, proving that Baja California was a peninsula. Despite his report based on first-hand information, the myth persisted in Europe that California was an island. His account provided the first recorded use of the name &quot;California&quot;. João Rodrigues Cabrilho, a Portuguese navigator sailing for the Spanish Crown, was the first European to set foot in California, landing on September 28, 1542, on the shores of San Diego Bay and claiming California for Spain. He also landed on San Miguel, one of the Channel Islands, and continued as far north as Point Reyes on the mainland. After his death, the crew continued exploring as far north as Oregon.

The English privateer Francis Drake sailed along the coast in 1579 north of Cabrillo&#x27;s landing site while circumnavigating the world. Drake had a long and largely successful career attacking Spanish settlements in the Caribbean islands and the mainland so for the English, he was a great hero and fervent Protestant, but for the Spanish, he was &quot;a frightening monster.&quot; Drake played a major role in the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 but led an armada himself to the Spanish Caribbean that was unsuccessful in dislodging the Spanish. On 5 June 1579, the ship briefly made first landfall at South Cove, Cape Arago, just south of Coos Bay, Oregon, and then sailed south while searching for a suitable harbor to repair his damaged ship. On 17 June, Drake and his crew found a protected cove when they landed on the Pacific coast of what is now Northern California near Point Reyes. While ashore, he claimed the area for Queen Elizabeth I of England as Nova Albion or New Albion. To document and assert his claim, Drake posted an engraved plate of brass to claim sovereignty for Queen Elizabeth and her successors on the throne. Drake&#x27;s landfalls on the west coast of North America are one small part of his 1577–1580 circumnavigation of the globe, the first captain of his own ship to do so. Drake died in 1596 off the coast of Panama, following injuries from a raid.

From 1609 to 1611, after several voyages on behalf of English merchants to explore a prospective Northeast Passage to India, English mariner Henry Hudson, under the auspices of the Dutch East India Company (VOC), explored the region around present-day New York City, while looking for a western route to Asia. He explored the Hudson River and laid the foundation for Dutch colonization of the region. Hudson&#x27;s final expedition ranged farther north in search of the Northwest Passage, leading to his discovery of the Hudson Strait and Hudson Bay. After wintering in James Bay, Hudson tried to press on with his voyage in the spring of 1611, but his crew mutinied and they cast him adrift.

===Search for a northern route===

France, the Netherlands, and England sought a sea route to Asia after finding none through Africa or South America. With no route through the Americas, they focused on northern passages, driving European exploration of the Arctic coasts. The idea of a link between the Atlantic and Pacific was first proposed by Russian diplomat Gerasimov in 1525, though Russian Pomors had explored parts of the route as early as the 11th century.

In 1553, English explorer Hugh Willoughby with chief pilot Richard Chancellor were sent out with three vessels in search of a passage by London&#x27;s Company of Merchant Adventurers to New Lands. During the voyage across the Barents Sea, Willoughby thought he saw islands to the north, and islands called Willoughby&#x27;s Land were shown on maps published by Plancius and Mercator into the 1640s. The vessels were separated by &quot;terrible whirlwinds&quot; in the Norwegian Sea and Willoughby sailed into a bay near the present border between Finland and Russia. His ships with the frozen crews, including Captain Willoughby and his journal, were found by Russian fishermen a year later. Richard Chancellor was able to drop anchor in the White Sea and make his way overland to Moscow and Ivan the Terrible&#x27;s Court, opening trade with Russia and the Company of Merchant Adventurers became the Muscovy Company.

In June 1576, English mariner Martin Frobisher led an expedition consisting of three ships and 35 men to search for a north-west passage around North America. The voyage was supported by the Muscovy Company, the same merchants that hired Hugh Willoughby to find a northeast passage above Russia. Violent storms sank one ship and forced another to turn back but Frobisher and the remaining ship reached the coast of Labrador in July. A few days later they came upon the mouth of what is now Frobisher Bay. Frobisher believed it to be the entrance to a north-west passage and named it Frobisher&#x27;s Strait and claimed Baffin Island for Queen Elizabeth. After some preliminary exploration, Frobisher returned to England. He commanded two subsequent voyages in 1577 and 1578 but failed to find the hoped-for passage. Frobisher brought to England his ships laden with ore, but it was found to be worthless and damaged his reputation as an explorer. He remains an important early historical figure in Canada.

====Barentsz&#x27; Arctic exploration====
On 5 June 1594, Dutch cartographer Willem Barentsz departed from Texel in a fleet of three ships to enter the Kara Sea, with the hopes of finding the Northeast Passage above Siberia. At Williams Island the crew encountered a polar bear for the first time. They managed to bring it on board, but the bear rampaged and was killed. Barentsz reached the west coast of Novaya Zemlya and followed it northward, before being forced to turn back in the face of large icebergs.

The following year, Prince Maurice of Orange named him chief pilot of a new expedition of six ships, loaded with merchant wares that the Dutch hoped to trade with China. The party came across Samoyed &quot;wild men&quot; but eventually turned back upon discovering the Kara Sea frozen. In 1596, the States-General offered a high reward for anybody who &quot;successfully&quot; navigated the Northeast Passage. The Town Council of Amsterdam purchased and outfitted two small ships, captained by Jan Rijp and Jacob van Heemskerk, to search for the elusive channel, under the command of Barents. They set off in May, and in June discovered Bear Island and Spitsbergen, sighting its northwest coast. They saw a large bay, later called Raudfjorden and entered Magdalenefjorden, which they named &quot;Tusk Bay&quot;, sailing into the northern entrance of Forlandsundet, which they called &quot;Keerwyck&quot;, but were forced to turn back because of a shoal. On 28 June they rounded the northern point of Prins Karls Forland, which they named &quot;Vogelhoek&quot;, on account of a large number of birds, and sailed south, passing Isfjorden and Bellsund, which were labelled on Barentsz&#x27;s chart as &quot;Grooten Inwyck&quot; and &quot;Inwyck&quot;.

The ships once again reached Bear Island on 1 July, which led to a disagreement. They parted ways, with Barentsz continuing northeast, while Rijp headed north. Barentsz reached Novaya Zemlya and, to avoid becoming entrapped in ice, headed for the Vaigatch Strait but became stuck within the icebergs and floes. Stranded, the 16-man crew was forced to spend the winter on the ice. The crew used lumber from their ship to build a lodge they called &quot;Het Behouden Huys&quot; (The Kept House). Dealing with extreme cold, they used merchant fabrics to make additional blankets and clothing and caught Arctic foxes in primitive traps, as well as polar bears. When June arrived, and the ice had still not loosened its grip on the ship, scurvy-ridden survivors took two small boats out into the sea. Barentsz died at sea on 20 June 1597, while studying charts. It took seven more weeks for the boats to reach Kola where they were rescued by a Russian merchant vessel. Only 12 crewmen remained, reaching Amsterdam in November. Two of Barentsz&#x27; crewmembers later published their journals, Jan Huyghen van Linschoten, who had accompanied him on the first two voyages, and Gerrit de Veer who had acted as the ship&#x27;s carpenter on the last.

In 1608, Henry Hudson made a second attempt, trying to go across the top of Russia. He made it to Novaya Zemlya but was forced to turn back. Between 1609 and 1611, Hudson, after several voyages on behalf of English merchants to explore a prospective Northern Sea Route to India, explored the region around modern New York City while looking for a western route to Asia under the auspices of the Dutch East India Company (VOC).

===Dutch Australia and New Zealand===
&quot;Terra Australis Ignota&quot; (Latin, &quot;the unknown land of the south&quot;) was a hypothetical continent appearing on European maps from the 15th to the 18th centuries, with roots in a notion introduced by Aristotle. It was depicted on the mid-16th-century Dieppe maps, where its coastline appeared just south of the islands of the East Indies; it was often elaborately charted, with a wealth of fictitious detail. The discoveries reduced the area where the continent could be found. Many cartographers held to Aristotle&#x27;s opinion, like Gerardus Mercator (1569) and Alexander Dalrymple even so late as 1767 argued for its existence, with such arguments as that there should be a large landmass in the Southern Hemisphere as a counterweight to the known landmasses in the Northern Hemisphere. As new lands were discovered, they were often assumed to be parts of this hypothetical continent.

Juan Fernández, sailing from Chile in 1576, claimed he had discovered the Southern Continent. Luis Váez de Torres, a Galician navigator working for the Spanish Crown, proved the existence of a passage south of New Guinea, now known as Torres Strait. Pedro Fernandes de Queirós, a Portuguese navigator sailing for the Spanish Crown, saw a large island south of New Guinea in 1606, which he named La Australia del Espiritu Santo. He represented this to the King of Spain as the Terra Australis incognita. It was not Australia but an island in present-day Vanuatu.

Dutch navigator and colonial governor, Willem Janszoon sailed from the Netherlands for the East Indies for the third time on December 18, 1603, as captain of the &quot;Duyfken&quot; (or &quot;Duijfken&quot;, meaning &quot;Little Dove&quot;), one of twelve ships of the great fleet of Steven van der Hagen. Once in the Indies, Janszoon was sent to search for other outlets of trade, particularly in &quot;the great land of Nova Guinea and other East and Southlands.&quot; On November 18, 1605, the &quot;Duyfken&quot; sailed from Bantam to the coast of western New Guinea. Janszoon then crossed the eastern end of the Arafura Sea, without seeing the Torres Strait, into the Gulf of Carpentaria. On February 26, 1606, he made landfall at the Pennefather River on the western shore of Cape York in Queensland, near the modern town of Weipa. This is the first recorded European landfall on the Australian continent. Janszoon proceeded to chart some of the coastline, which he thought was a southerly extension of New Guinea. In 1615, Jacob Le Maire and Willem Schouten&#x27;s rounding of Cape Horn proved that Tierra del Fuego was a relatively small island.

From 1642 to 1644, Abel Tasman, also a Dutch explorer and merchant in the service of the VOC, circumnavigated New Holland proving that Australia was not part of the mythical southern continent. He was the first known European expedition to reach the islands of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (now Tasmania) and New Zealand and to sight the Fiji islands, which he did in 1643. Tasman, his navigator Visscher, and his merchant Gilsemans also mapped substantial portions of Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific Islands.

==Russian exploration of Siberia (1581–1660)==
In the mid-16th century, the Tsardom of Russia conquered the Tatar khanates of Kazan and Astrakhan, thus annexing the entire Volga Region and opening the way to the Ural Mountains. The colonization of the new easternmost lands of Russia and further onslaught eastward was led by the rich merchants Stroganovs. Tsar Ivan IV granted vast estates near the Urals as well as tax privileges to Anikey Stroganov, who organized large-scale migration to these lands. Stroganovs developed farming, hunting, saltworks, fishing, and ore mining on the Urals and established trade with Siberian tribes.

===Conquest of the Khanate of Sibir===
Around 1577, Semyon Stroganov and other sons of Anikey Stroganov hired a Cossack leader called Yermak to protect their lands from the attacks of Khan Kuchum. By 1580, Stroganovs and Yermak came up with the idea of a military expedition to Siberia, to fight Kuchum in his own land. In 1581, Yermak began his voyage into the depths of Siberia. After a few victories over the Khan&#x27;s army, Yermak&#x27;s people defeated the main forces of Kuchum on Irtysh River in a 3-day Battle of Chuvash Cape in 1582. The remains of the Khan&#x27;s army retreated to the steppes, and thus Yermak captured the Khanate of Sibir, including its capital Qashliq near modern Tobolsk. Kuchum still was strong and suddenly attacked Yermak in 1585 in the dead of night, killing most of his people. Yermak was wounded and tried to swim across the Wagay River (Irtysh&#x27;s tributary), but drowned under the weight of his own chain mail. The Cossacks had to withdraw from Siberia completely, but thanks to Yermak&#x27;s having explored all the main river routes in West Siberia, Russians successfully reclaimed all his conquests just several years later.
===Siberian river routes===
In the early 17th century, the eastward movement of Russians was slowed by the internal problems in the country during the Time of Troubles. Very soon, exploration and colonization of the huge territories of Siberia resumed, led mostly by Cossacks hunting for valuable furs and ivory. While Cossacks came from the Southern Urals, another wave of Russians came by the Arctic Ocean. These were Pomors from the Russian North, who already had been making fur trade with Mangazeya in the north of Western Siberia for quite a long time. In 1607, the settlement of Turukhansk was founded on the northern Yenisey River, near the mouth of Lower Tunguska. In 1619, Yeniseysk ostrog was founded on the mid-Yenisey at the mouth of the Upper Tunguska.

Between 1620 and 1624, a group of fur hunters led by Demid Pyanda left Turukhansk and explored some of the Lower Tunguska, wintering in the proximity of the Vilyuy and Lena Rivers. According to later legendary accounts (folktales collected a century after the fact), Pyanda discovered the Lena. He allegedly explored some of its length, reaching as far as central Yakutia. He returned up the Lena until it became too rocky and shallow, and portaged to the Angara River. In this way, Pyanda may have become the first Russian to meet Yakuts and Buryats. He built new boats and explored some of the Angara, finally reaching Yeniseysk and discovering that the Angara (a Buryat name) and Upper Tunguska (Verkhnyaya Tunguska, as initially known by Russians) are one and the same river.

In 1627, Pyotr Beketov was appointed Yenisei voevoda in Siberia. He successfully carried out the voyage to collect taxes from the Zabaykalye Buryats, becoming the first Russian to step in Buryatia. He founded the first Russian settlement there, Rybinsky ostrog. Beketov was sent to the Lena River in 1631, where in 1632 he founded Yakutsk and sent his Cossacks to explore the Aldan River and farther down the Lena, to found new fortresses, and to collect taxes.

Yakutsk soon turned into a major starting point for further Russian expeditions eastward, southward and northward. Maksim Perfilyev, who earlier had been one of the founders of Yeniseysk, founded Bratsk ostrog on the Angara in 1631. In 1638, Perfilyev became the first Russian to step into Transbaikalia, travelling there from Yakutsk.
In 1643, Kurbat Ivanov led a group of Cossacks from Yakutsk to the south of the Baikal Mountains and discovered Lake Baikal, visiting its Olkhon Island. Ivanov later made the first chart and description of Baikal.

===Russians reach the Pacific===
In 1639, a group of explorers led by Ivan Moskvitin became the first Russians to reach the Pacific Ocean and to discover the Sea of Okhotsk, having built a winter camp on its shore at the Ulya River mouth. The Cossacks learned from the locals about the large Amur River far to the south. In 1640, they apparently sailed south, and explored the south-eastern shores of the Okhotsk Sea, perhaps reaching the mouth of the Amur River and possibly discovering the Shantar Islands on their way back. Based on Moskvitin&#x27;s account, Kurbat Ivanov drew the first Russian map of the Far East in 1642.

In 1643, Vasily Poyarkov crossed the Stanovoy Range and reached the upper Zeya River in the country of the Daurs, who were paying tribute to the Manchu Chinese. After wintering, in 1644, Poyarkov pushed down the Zeya and became the first Russian to reach the Amur River. He sailed down the Amur and finally discovered the mouth of that great river from land. Since his Cossacks provoked the enmity of the locals behind, Poyarkov chose a different way back. They built boats and in 1645, sailed along the Sea of Okhotsk coast to the Ulya River and spent the next winter in the huts that had been built by Ivan Moskvitin six years earlier. In 1646, they returned to Yakutsk.
In 1644, Mikhail Stadukhin discovered the Kolyma River and founded Srednekolymsk. A merchant named Fedot Alekseyev Popov organized a further expedition eastward, and Semyon Dezhnyov became a captain of one of the kochi. In 1648, they sailed from Srednekolymsk down to the Arctic and after some time they rounded Cape Dezhnyov, thus becoming the first explorers to pass through the Bering Strait and discover Chukotka and the Bering Sea. All their Kochi and most of their men (including Popov himself) were lost in storms and clashes with the natives. A small group led by Dezhnyov reached the mouth of the Anadyr River and sailed up it in 1649, having built new boats from the wreckage. They founded Anadyrsk and were stranded there until Stadukhin found them, coming from Kolyma by land. Subsequently, Stadukhin set off south in 1651 and discovered Penzhin Bay on the northern coast of the Okhotsk Sea. He also may have explored the western shores of Kamchatka.

From 1649 to 1650, Yerofey Khabarov became the second Russian to explore the Amur River. Through Olyokma, Tungir and Shilka Rivers he reached Amur (Dauria), returned to Yakutsk and then back to Amur with a larger force in 1650–1653. This time he was met with armed resistance. He built winter quarters at Albazin, then sailed down Amur and found Achansk, which preceded the present-day Khabarovsk, defeating or evading large armies of Daurian Manchu Chinese and Koreans on his way. He charted the Amur in his &quot;Draft of the Amur river&quot;. Subsequently, Russians held on to the Amur region until 1689, when by the Treaty of Nerchinsk this land was assigned to the Chinese Empire. It was returned by the Treaty of Aigun in 1858.

From 1659 to 1665, Kurbat Ivanov was the next head of Anadyrsky ostrog after Semyon Dezhnev. In 1660, he sailed from Anadyr Bay to Cape Dezhnyov. Atop his earlier pioneering charts, Ivanov is credited with the creation of the early map of Chukotka and the Bering Strait, which was the first to show on paper (very schematically) the yet undiscovered Wrangel Island, both Diomede Islands and Alaska, based on the data collected from the natives of Chukotka.

By the mid-17th century, Russians established the borders of their country close to modern ones, and explored almost the whole of Siberia, except the eastern Kamchatka and some regions north of the Arctic Circle. The conquest of Kamchatka later would be achieved in the early 1700s by Vladimir Atlasov, while the discovery of the Arctic coastline and Alaska would be completed by the Great Northern Expedition in 1733–1743.

==Global impact==

European overseas expansion led to contact between the Old and New Worlds producing the Columbian exchange. It started the global silver trade and led to direct European involvement in the Chinese porcelain trade. It involved the transfer of goods unique from one hemisphere to another. Europeans brought cattle, horses, and sheep to the New World, and from the New World Europeans received tobacco, potatoes, tomatoes, and maize. Other items and commodities becoming important in global trade were the tobacco, sugarcane, and cotton crops of the Americas, along with the gold and silver brought from the American continent not only to Europe, but elsewhere in the Old World.

The formation of new transoceanic links and expansion of European influence led to the Age of Imperialism, which began during the Age of Discovery, during which colonial powers from Europe colonized most territory on the planet. European demand for trade, commodities, colonies and slaves had a drastic impact on the rest of the world; during European colonization of the Americas, European colonial powers conquered and colonized numerous indigenous nations and cultures, and conducted numerous conversions and attempts at cultural assimilation both voluntary or forced. Combined with the introduction of infectious diseases from Europe, these events led to a drastic decrease of the indigenous American population. Indigenous accounts of European colonization were summarized by scholar Peter Mancall: &quot;The arrival of Europeans brought death, displacement, sorrow, and despair to Native Americans&quot;. In some areas, like North America, Central America, Australia, New Zealand, and Argentina, indigenous peoples were badly treated, driven off their lands, and reduced to dependent minorities in the territory.

Similarly, in East and West Africa, local states supplied the appetite of European slave traders, changing the complexion of coastal African states and fundamentally altering the nature of slavery in Africa, causing impacts on societies and economies deep inland.

In North America, there were many conflicts between Europeans and indigenous peoples. The Europeans had many advantages over the indigenous people. Introduced Eurasian diseases wiped out 50–90% of the indigenous population because they had not been exposed before and lacked acquired immunity.

Maize and manioc were introduced into Africa in the 16th century by the Portuguese. They are now important staple foods, replacing native African crops. Alfred W. Crosby speculated that increased production of maize, manioc, and other New World crops led to heavier concentrations of population in the areas from which slavers captured their victims.

In the global silver trade, the Ming dynasty was stimulated by trade with the Portuguese, Spanish, and Dutch. Although global, much of that silver ended up with the Chinese, and China dominated silver imports. Between 1600 and 1800 China received 100 tons of silver on average per year. A large populace near the Lower Yangtze averaged hundreds of taels of silver per household in the late 16th century. More than 150,000 tons of silver were shipped from Potosí by the end of the 18th century. From 1500 to 1800, Mexico and Peru produced about 80% of the world&#x27;s silver, with more than 30% of it eventually ending up in China (largely because European merchants used it to purchase exotic Chinese commodities). In the late 16th and early 17th century, Japan was exporting heavily into China and foreign trade at large. Trade with European powers and the Japanese brought in significant amounts of silver, which then replaced copper and paper banknotes as the common medium of exchange in China. During the last decades of the Ming Dynasty, the flow of silver into China was greatly diminished, thereby undermining state revenues and the entire Ming economy. This damage to the economy was compounded by the effects on agriculture of the incipient Little Ice Age, natural calamities, crop failure, and sudden epidemics. The ensuing breakdown of authority and people&#x27;s livelihoods allowed rebel leaders such as Li Zicheng to challenge Ming authority.

New crops that had come to Asia from the Americas, via the Spanish colonizers in the 16th century, contributed to Asia&#x27;s population growth. Although the bulk of imports to China were silver, the Chinese also purchased New World crops from the Spanish Empire. This included sweet potatoes, maize, and peanuts, foods that could be cultivated in lands where traditional Chinese staple crops—wheat, millet, and rice—could not grow, hence facilitating a rise in the population of China. In the Song dynasty (960–1279), rice had become the major staple crop of the poor; after sweet potatoes were introduced to China around 1560, it gradually became the traditional food of the lower classes.

The arrival of the Portuguese to Japan in 1543 initiated the Nanban trade period, with the Japanese adopting technologies and cultural practices, like the arquebus, European-style cuirasses, European ships, Christianity, decorative art, and language. After the Chinese had banned direct trade by Chinese merchants with Japan, the Portuguese filled this commercial vacuum as intermediaries. The Portuguese bought Chinese silk and sold it to the Japanese in return for Japanese-mined silver; since silver was more highly valued in China, the Portuguese could then use Japanese silver to buy even larger stocks of Chinese silk. By 1573, after the Spanish established a trading base in Manila, the Portuguese intermediary trade was trumped by the prime source of incoming silver to China from the Spanish Americas. Although China acted as the cog running the wheel of global trade during the 16th to 18th centuries, Japan&#x27;s huge contribution of silver exports to China was critical to the world economy and China&#x27;s liquidity and success with the commodity.

===Economic impact in Europe===
As a wider variety of global luxury commodities entered the European markets by sea, previous European markets for luxury goods stagnated. The Atlantic trade largely supplanted pre-existing Italian and German trading powers which had relied on their Baltic, Russian, and Islamic trade links. The new commodities also caused social change, as sugar, spices, silks and chinawares entered the luxury markets of Europe.

The European economic centre shifted from the Mediterranean to Western Europe. The city of Antwerp, part of the Duchy of Brabant, became &quot;the centre of the &quot;entire&quot; international economy&quot;, and the richest city in Europe. Centred in Antwerp first and then Amsterdam, the &quot;Dutch Golden Age&quot; was tightly linked to the Age of Discovery.

By 1549 the Portuguese were sending annual trade missions to Shangchuan Island in China. In 1557 they managed to convince the Ming court to agree on a legal port treaty that would establish Macau as an official Portuguese trade colony. The Portuguese friar Gaspar da Cruz (c. 1520–70) wrote the first complete book on China published in Europe; it included information on its geography, provinces, royalty, official class, bureaucracy, shipping, architecture, farming, craftsmanship, merchant affairs, clothing, religious and social customs, music and instruments, writing, education, and justice.

From China, the major exports were silk and porcelain, adapted to meet European tastes. The Chinese export porcelains were held in such great esteem in Europe that, in English, &quot;&quot; became a commonly-used synonym for &quot;porcelain&quot;. Kraak porcelain was among the first Chinese ware to arrive in Europe in significant quantities; only the richest could afford these early imports. Soon the Dutch East India Company established trade with the East, having imported 6 million porcelain items from China to Europe between the years 1602–82. Kraak, mainly the blue and white porcelain, was imitated all over the world by potters in Arita, Japan and Persia—where Dutch merchants turned when the fall of the Ming dynasty rendered Chinese originals unavailable—and ultimately in Delftware. Dutch and later English Delftware inspired by Chinese designs persisted from about 1630 to the mid-18th century alongside European patterns.

Antonio de Morga (1559–1636), a Spanish official in Manila, listed an extensive inventory of goods that were traded by Ming China at the turn of the 16th to 17th century, noting there were &quot;rarities which, did I refer to them all, I would never finish, nor have sufficient paper for it&quot;. Ebrey writes of the considerable size of commercial transactions: In one case a galleon to the Spanish territories in the New World carried over 50,000 pairs of silk stockings. In return China imported mostly silver from Peruvian and Mexican mines, transported via Manila. Chinese merchants were active in these trading ventures, and many emigrated to such places as the Philippines and Borneo to take advantage of the new commercial opportunities.

The increase in gold and silver experienced by Spain coincided with a major inflationary cycle within Spain and Europe, known as the price revolution. Spain had amassed large quantities of gold and silver from the New World. In the 1540s large scale extraction of silver from Mexico began. During the 16th century, Spain held the equivalent of US$1.5 trillion (1990 terms) in gold and silver from New Spain. Being the most powerful European monarch at a time full of war and religious conflicts, the Habsburg rulers spent their wealth in wars and arts across Europe. &quot;I learnt a proverb here&quot;, said a French traveller in 1603: &quot;Everything is dear in Spain except silver&quot;. The spent silver, spread throughout a cash-starved Europe, caused widespread inflation. The inflation was worsened by a growing population with a static production level, low salaries and a rising cost of living, which damaged local industry. Increasingly, Spain became dependent on the revenues flowing in from the mercantile empire, leading to Spain&#x27;s first bankruptcy in 1557 due to rising military costs. Philip II of Spain defaulted on debt payments in 1557, 1560, 1575, and 1596. The increase in prices as a result of currency circulation fuelled the growth of the commercial middle class in Europe, the &quot;bourgeoisie&quot;, which came to influence the politics and culture of many countries. One effect of the inflation, particularly in Great Britain, was that tenant farmers who held long-term leases from lords saw real decreases in rent. Some lords opted to sell their leased land, giving rise to small, landowning farmers such as yeoman and gentlemen farmers.

<text>The suling (Sundanese: ) is a musical instrument of the Sundanese people in Indonesia. It is used in the Degung ensemble. Bamboo ring flute can also be found in Southeast Asia, especially in Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore.

==Construction==
Sulings are made mainly of &quot;tamiang&quot; bamboo (&quot;Schizostachyum blumei&quot;, Nees), a long, thin-walled bamboo tube. The mouthpiece of the suling is circled with a thin band made of rattan near a small hole.

==Playing method==
To play the suling, performers blow into a gap between the rattan band and the bamboo tube at one end of the instrument.

There are two factors that affect a fine suling&#x27;s tone:
#Fingering position.
#Speed of the airflow blown by the mouth. This factor also should be supported with the position of the mouth around the blowing hole.

The fingering position changes the wavelength of sound resonance inside the suling&#x27;s body. Depending on the distance of nearest hole to the suling&#x27;s head, different notes can be produced. The airflow speed also can modify the tone&#x27;s frequency. A note with twice frequency can be produced mostly by blowing the air into suling&#x27;s head&#x27;s hole with twice speed.

In the music of Bali, the suling is an essential instrument and it appears to be similar to other forms of Javanese suling. The way it is played, however, sets it apart from other forms of Indonesian suling. Namely, it is necessary for the performers to use the technique circular breathing in order to create a highly strung sense of constancy that continues even at moments of dramatic climax by the percussive gamelan instruments.
===Special effects===
*Slur, is dynamically changing note from one tone position to another position without stopping the airflow. For example, changing from 5 to 4, 4 to 5, 2 to 1 etc.
*Puruluk, (Sundanese term) is an effect produced by a-repeatedly-fast opening-and-closing of suling&#x27;s hole by one or more fingers. The produced sound is similar to voice of a pigeon. The easiest puruluk can be produced by opening and closing mid-finger as shown by the following picture:


*In Sundanese technique, there are other known effects such as &quot;wiwiw&quot;, &quot;keleter&quot;, &quot;lelol&quot;, &quot;gebos&quot;, &quot;petit&quot;, &quot;jengkat&quot;, and &quot;betrik&quot;.

==Types==
===Sundanese===

In the Sundanese region, a suling is used as
*one of the main instruments in kacapi suling
*accompanying instrument in Gamelan Degung, Tembang Sunda

====Tuning====
Sulings can have either 4 holes or 6 holes. The 4-holed sulings are made for single scale usage. The 6-holed Sundanese suling can play at least three different scales. Some custom sulings have 7, 8, and 9 holes as additional holes for playing extended scales such as Mandalungan, the transposed version of Degung.
*Pelog/Degung: da mi na ti la da [1 2 3 4 5 1], nearly corresponds to do si sol fa mi do [1&#x27; 7 5 4 3 1] in the Western diatonic scale.
*Madenda/Sorog: da mi na ti la da [1 2 3 4 5 1], nearly similar to fa mi do si la fa [4’ 3’ 1’ 7 6 4] in the Western diatonic scale. Madenda conceptually played by changing the 3rd note of Degung [1&#x27; 7 5 4 3 1] in diatonic scale to [1&#x27; 7 6 4 3 1], and move the Sundanese 1/da to the Western 4/fa position. 
*Saléndro: da mi na ti la da [1 2 3 4 5 1], nearly similar to re do la sol fa re [2’ 1’ 6 5 4 2] in the Western diatonic scale. Saléndro tone are almost five-equally divided tones, called as Saléndro Padantara (equal interval). Unequal division of Saléndro notes called as Saléndro Bédantara (unequal interval).
*Mandalungan: a rarely used scale, similar to Degung scale, but it is actually a transposed Degung via changing the 4th tone of Madenda [4&#x27; 3&#x27; 1&#x27; 7 6 4] in Western diatonic scale to [4&#x27; 3&#x27; 1&#x27; ♭7 6 4]. Basically sounds the same as Degung, just with a different transposition. This scale needs an extra hole (usually in the back of suling) to play.
*Wisaya: this scale is the same as Madenda/Sorog, but on different transposition. This scale is only playable with additional hole, usually on the back and top most position. Its notation [1 2 3 4 5 1] corresponds to western [1&#x27; 7 5 ♯4 3 1]. Both Mandalungan and Wisaya can be played on a single suling with at least eight holes, which two holes are placed in the back, closed with thumbs.
While playing with kacapi, the order of pieces played are usually played in this sequence (the displayed notes are in Western scale degree): Salendro [2’ 1’ 6 5 4 2], Wisaya [1&#x27; 7 5 ♯4 3 1], Degung [1&#x27; 7 5 4 3 1], Madenda [4’ 3’ 1’ 7 6 4], and then Mandalungan [4&#x27; 3&#x27; 1&#x27; ♭7 6 4]. The order makes minimal retuning the number of the kacapi strings. Saléndro is a distinct scale in this case, with the most different notes set compared the rest of the scales. From Wisaya to Mandalungan, we can notice there&#x27;s only one change of note from each previous scale to the next scale: Wisaya to Degung [♯4] to [4], Degung to Madenda [5] to [6], and Madenda to Mandalungan [7] to [♭7]. Regular six holes suling can only access Saléndro, Degung, and Madenda.

The following picture shows the fingering for a six-holed Sundanese suling.
And below is the example of &#x27;more realistic&#x27; view of finger positioning for the pelog degung scale.
====Famous Sundanese suling players====
*Endang Sukandar, 1996 2nd Winner of International Festival of Wind Instruments in Seoul, South Korea
*Burhan Sukarma
*Uking Sukri
*Bang Saat (Additional player of Dewa Budjana, He came from kalimantan) He also called as &quot;saat&quot;
The Suling can be in many sizes. Sundanese traditional suling are sold in based on tunings which usually determined from each size lable such as 54, 56, 60, etc. Suling 56 means that the length of the suling corresponds to roughly 56cm, and usually tuned to 1/da=G, which resulting Degung scale have this collection of notes: G F♯ D C B.

==Suling outside Indonesia==
In Brunei, the suling today is played during a cultural festival and other events together with other Bruneian traditional instruments especially the &quot;Gulintangan&quot;. While in East Malaysia, especially in Sabah with a wide variety of aerophone, the instrument is played by all the interior ethnic groups in the state of Kadazan-Dusun, Murut, Rungus and Lun Bawang/Lundayeh. In Sarawak, the suling is mostly played by men in a Dayak people longhouse.

It is also called as suling by the Tausug, Yakan, B&#x27;laan, and Tiruray. Other names for the suling include the lantey (Ata), kinsi (Bukidnon), dagoyong (Higanon) and a babarak (Palawan)

The Maguindanaon suling is the smallest bamboo flute of the Maguindanaon and the only one classified as a ring-flute (the other two bamboo flutes of the Maguindanaon, the tumpong and the palendag are both lip-valley flutes). Air is passed through the suling via a blowing hole found at the bottom of the instrument and pitch is controlled via five finger holes on the top and one finger hole located on the bottom. Traditionally only the palendag was commonly played but because of the difficult nature of playing the palendag, both the tumpong and the suling have come to replace the palendag as the Maguindanaon’s most common aerophones.

<doc id="690849" wikidata="Q3400935" url="?curid=690849" title="Cunning folk in Britain">
<text>The cunning folk were professional or semi-professional practitioners of magic in Europe from the medieval period through the early 20th century. In Britain they were known by a variety of names in different regions of the country, including wise men and wise women, pellars, wizards, dyn hysbys, and sometimes white witches. 

These people practised folk and low magic – although often combined with elements of &quot;high&quot; or ceremonial magic – which they learned through the study of grimoires. Primarily using spells and charms as a part of their profession, they were most commonly employed to use their magic to combat malevolent witchcraft, to locate criminals, missing persons or stolen property, for fortune telling, for healing, for treasure hunting and to influence people to fall in love. Belonging &quot;to the world of popular belief and custom&quot;, the cunning folk&#x27;s magic has been defined as being &quot;concerned not with the mysteries of the universe and the empowerment of the magus [as ceremonial magic usually is], so much as with practical remedies for specific problems.&quot; However, other historians have noted that in some cases, there was apparently an &quot;experimental or &#x27;spiritual&#x27; dimension&quot; to their magical practices, something which was possibly shamanic in nature.

Although the British cunning folk were in almost all cases Christian themselves, certain Christian theologians and Church authorities believed that, being practitioners of magic, the cunning folk were in league with the Devil and as such were akin to the more overtly Satanic and malevolent witches. Partly because of this, laws were enacted across England, Scotland and Wales that often condemned cunning folk and their magical practices, but there was no widespread persecution of them akin to the witch hunt, largely because most common people firmly distinguished between the two: witches were seen as being harmful and cunning folk as useful.

Comparable figures were found in other parts of Western Europe: in France, such terms as and were used for them, whilst in the Netherlands they were known as or , in Germany as and in Denmark as . In Spain they were &quot;curanderos&quot; whilst in Portugal they were known as . It is widely agreed by historians and folklorists, such as Willem de Blécourt, Robin Briggs and Owen Davies, that the term &quot;cunning folk&quot; could be applied to all of these figures as well to reflect a pan-European tradition.

== Societal role ==
In Britain in the late medieval and Early Modern periods, folk magic was widely popular. Many individuals knew of some magical charms and spells, but there were also professionals who dealt in magic, including charmers, fortune tellers, astrologers and cunning folk, the last of whom were said to &quot;possess a broader and deeper knowledge of such techniques and more experience in using them&quot; than the average person; it was also believed that they &quot;embodied or could work with supernatural power which greatly increased the effectiveness of the operations concerned.&quot;

The terms &quot;cunning man&quot; and &quot;cunning woman&quot; were most widely used in southern England, the Midlands, and in Wales. Such people were also frequently known across England as &quot;wizards&quot;, &quot;wise men&quot; or &quot;wise women&quot;, or in southern England and Wales as &quot;conjurers&quot; or as &quot;&quot; in the Welsh language. In Cornwall they were sometimes referred to as &quot;pellars&quot;, which some etymologists suggest originated from the term &quot;expellers&quot;, referring to the practice of expelling evil spirits. Nineteenth-century folklorists often used the term &quot;white witch&quot; to refer to cunning folk, although this was infrequently used amongst the ordinary people themselves, as for them the term &quot;witch&quot; had general connotations of malevolence and evil.

===Demographics===
The number of cunning folk in Britain at any one time is uncertain. Nevertheless historian Owen Davies has speculated that, based on his own research into English cunning folk (which excluded those in Scotland and Wales), that &quot;Up until the mid nineteenth century there may have been as many as several thousand working in England at any given time.&quot; Although there was a twentieth-century stereotype that cunning folk usually lived and worked in rural areas of Britain, evidence shows that there were also many in towns and cities. Around two-thirds of recorded cunning folk in Britain were male, although their female counterparts were &quot;every bit as popular and commercially successful as the men, and indeed this was one of the few means by which ordinary women could achieve a respected and independent position&quot; in the British society of the time.

The cunning folk of Britain were often from the societal class that included artisans, tradesmen, and farmers, and as such were commonly at least semi-literate and of a higher social position than common labourers. In many cases they continued in their ordinary line of work alongside earning money as a professional cunning man or woman. In almost all cases, cunning folk worked either alone, as a solitary magical practitioner, or with one other person, such as a spouse or sibling. The only known exception was in early nineteenth-century Manchester, where several cunning men used to meet in a group, centred around the most prominent of their members, a cunning fellow called Rawlinson. This method of working alone was one factor that separated the cunning folk from the stereotype of witches then prevalent in Britain, which often held that these witches met together in groups, sometimes known as covens, and at times flew through the air to get to their meeting points.

===Becoming a cunning person===

In most cases, it seems that individuals set themselves up as cunning folk with no former basis or training, although others came from a family background of professional magical practitioners. One of the most prominent examples of a family dynasty of cunning people was the Harries family from Cwrt y Cadno in Wales: Henry Harries (1739–1805) was a yeoman farmer who had interests in astrology and medicine but did not practice as a cunning man, whilst his son John (1785–1839) and two grandsons Henry and John instead became professionals in the field. As Owen Davies remarked, &quot;There are a number of reasons why people may have wanted to become cunning-folk. The desire for money, power or social prestige, and even to do good, all undoubtedly played their part.&quot; Some practitioners genuinely believed they had magical powers, while some later admitted in court that they had no such powers but were simply pretending that they did to fool people for their money. Indeed, there was a great deal of variability amongst the British cunning folk, with historian Ronald Hutton remarking that &quot;they appear as a remarkably heterogeneous collection of individuals, divided by at least as many characteristics as those which they had in common.&quot;

&quot;Cunning-folk operated in a competitive market where reputations and first impressions were very important&quot;, and as such often worked on their personal promotion. Some were known to travel relatively large distances to visit their clients as well as making calls during the night if requested. Some, though by no means all, were also known to wear &quot;striking costume or home decorations&quot; to enhance their reputations as magical individuals-- a nineteenth-century cunning woman, for instance, might wear a conical hat and a robe with mystical signs on it, as well as hanging herbs and papers from the ceiling of her home. Similarly, James &quot;Cunning&quot; Murrell, the nineteenth-century cunning man of Hadleigh in south-east Essex, wore iron goggles and carried a whalebone umbrella whenever he went out, whilst Mother Merne, the late 19th and early 20th-century wise woman of Milborne Down in Dorset, kept guinea pigs, black hens, a black goat and a black cat; the cat would sit on her shoulder during consultations with clients.

== Services ==
The cunning folk typically performed several different services in their local communities, using what they claimed to be their own magical powers.

=== Opposing witchcraft ===

One of the most common services that the cunning folk provided was in combating the effects of malevolent witchcraft and the curses which these witches had allegedly placed upon people. Alongside this, they were also known at times for identifying witches, and in this manner they were &quot;the only healers to offer a comprehensive package of anti-witch measures.&quot; British cunning folk were known to use a variety of methods to cure someone of malevolent sorcery, including tackling the witch either physically or through the law courts, breaking the spell over the individual by magical means, and by using charms and potions to remove the witchcraft from the afflicted person&#x27;s body. As historian Owen Davies noted, &quot;Most cunning-folk employed a multi-pronged approach to curing witchcraft, using a combination of written charms, magic rituals, prayers and herbal medicines, thereby appealing to the physical, psychological and spiritual needs of the sick.&quot;

One of the best known means by which the cunning folk opposed witchcraft was through the use of witch bottles; ceramic bottles containing such items as urine, nails, hair and nail clippings which it was believed, when put together, would cause harm to the malevolent witch. Another commonly used method was to take the heart of an animal, and to pierce it with pins, to do harm to the witch, whilst other cunning folk preferred to make dolls of the witch out of rags and other materials and then pierce them with pins, again with the intention of inflicting physical harm on the witch, and breaking their bewitchment.

Amongst the common people who often went to the cunning folk for aid, these magical practitioners were seen as being very much distinct from witches; as Davies noted, to the average person &quot;witches were evil but cunning-folk were useful&quot;. Some theologians and figures of Church authority nonetheless believed that the cunning-folk, in practising magic, were also, like the witches, following the Devil, a malevolent supernatural entity in Christian mythology. Such a viewpoint was not constrained to any one particular form of Christianity in this period, but was found amongst the Roman Catholic Church, the Anglican Church of England and also various forms of Protestantism. Some early Quakers, a Protestant denomination founded in the seventeenth century, were particularly vocal against the cunning folk, perhaps because they themselves were accused by their critics of using sorcery to attract new members, and so wanted to heavily distance themselves from such practices.

=== Locating property and criminals ===
The cunning folk were also commonly employed to locate missing or stolen property and uncover the perpetrator: this was of particular importance throughout the Early Modern period, when peoples&#x27; possessions were far more valued than in later centuries as they were expensive to replace, particularly for the poor. There are recorded cases where the cunning folk would also promise to ensure that the stolen property was returned, and in some of these they did prove successful, with the thief promptly returning what they had taken, something which may have been out of their own fear of being cursed by the cunning folk. At times, such cunning individuals were also known to locate missing persons: an example of this was reported in 1617, as John Redman of Sutton discovered that his wife had left him, and &quot;went from wizard to wizard, or, as they term them &#x27;wise men&#x27;, to have them bring her again&quot;.

The methods used to perform this service differed amongst the cunning folk, although astrology was one of the most commonly used ways. In some cases, the cunning man or woman would instead get their client to give them a list of names of people whom they suspected of having stolen their property, and from which they would use various forms of divination to come to a conclusion regarding who was the guilty party, or alternately they would get their client to scry with a reflective surface such as a mirror, crystal ball, piece of glass or bowl of water, and then allow them to see an image of the culprit themselves. According to historian Owen Davies, this was an &quot;alternative, less risky strategy&quot; than divination or astrology because it allowed the client to confirm &quot;their own suspicions without cunning-folk having to name someone explicitly.&quot; Other techniques could be described by today&#x27;s standards as psychological or even downright deceptive. Cunning folk might use these methods to &quot;intimidate the guilty&quot; or &quot;prompt their clients into identifying criminal suspects&quot;; for example cunning woman Alice West would hide in a closet near the front door and eavesdrop on small-talk before greeting a client, then upon meeting the client she would explain that already knew their business because the fairies told her.

The concept of cunning folk locating criminals using magical means concerned some people in power in England, and there are records from London in the fourteenth century showing that certain cunning folk themselves were brought to trial because of their accusations against other members of the community: for instance, in 1382 a cunning man named Robert Berewold was brought to court after accusing a woman named Johanna Wolsy of stealing a drinking bowl from a house in St Mildred Poultry. In the trial, it emerged that Berewold had come to his conclusion through a form of divination known as &quot;turning the loaf&quot; where a wooden peg was stuck into the top of a loaf of bread with four knives then stuck into the sides. A list of names would then be spoken, and according to the theory, the loaf would supposedly turn when the name of the thief was spoken. Berewold was found guilty of making unsubstantiated and damaging claims, and punished in the pillory.

=== Healing ===
The cunning folk were widely visited for aid in healing various ailments for both humans and their livestock, particularly from poorer members of the community who could not afford the fees charged by apothecaries and physicians. Records indicate that the cunning folk used a wide variety of different methods to cure their clients, &quot;from the simply laying on of hands to the use of elaborate rituals.&quot;

In 1846, the Chelmsford Chronicle reported that an ill young man, that physians had been unable to help, followed the advice of a cunning woman who resided between the Epping Forest and Ongar, Essex to cure his illness:
That a small nut should be cut in twain, the kernel extracted, and a live spider placed in the shell, which was to be sewn up in a bag and worn round his neck, and as the spider wasted, so would the fever leave him.

At times, they would use various herbs and plants to develop medicines and folk cures that they believed would help. At other times, they employed more overtly magical means, such as the use of charms and prayers, which were usually very much Christian in nature, commonly invoking the power of the Christian Trinity to heal the sick. In keeping with this Christian basis, sometimes religious objects like holy water, candle wax or Eucharist wafers were used in healing. On occasion, live animals would be used as a part of the treatment, for instance in 1604, the Northumberland cunning women Katherine Thompson and Anne Nevelson were convicted by a court for placing a duck&#x27;s beak to a woman&#x27;s mouth whilst reciting charms as a form of healing.

Cunning folk at times were also known to offer abortions, usually via a poisonous potion that would kill the foetus, but there were cases where the potion also made the pregnant woman very ill.

=== Other services ===

British cunning folk would also often be involved in love magic, offering services pertaining to sex and relationships. One form of this was a form of fortune telling where they would divine the name or appearance of a client&#x27;s future lover, often using palmistry, scrying or astrology. Another popular practice of the cunning folk was the casting of spells or charms to ensure a spouse&#x27;s fidelity, preventing them from committing adultery; for instance, a cunning man from Newcastle upon Tyne, Peter Banks, was charged in 1673–74 with offering to draw up a magical contract which would bind a husband to staying loyal to his wife for a year.

Some cunning folk claimed to have the ability to locate treasure, and at times were employed by people in this capacity. In some of these cases it was believed that a supernatural entity, such as a demon, spirit or fairy, was guarding the hidden treasure, and that a cunning practitioner was needed to overcome them using magical means.

There were also claims that certain cunning folk occasionally performed bewitching or cursing for a fee, which under some definitions would make them witches as well as cunning people. The folklorist Eric Maple, after examining several 19th-century cunning folk in Essex, noted that one of them, George Pickingill, also performed cursing for clients, but that the other whom he examined, James Murrell, considered it immoral and so did not. Indeed, other Essex cunning folk were associated with witchcraft, notably in the village of Sible Hedingham, where there lived an elderly French cunning man who had previously had his tongue cut out, and was consequently dumb, as well as being deaf. As a result he was known as &quot;Dummy&quot; in the local community, who generally disliked him, largely because of his &#x27;otherness&#x27; in being both foreign and disabled, and rumours spread that he was a witch who would curse them. In 1863 a drunken mob attacked him, throwing him in a river to see if he would sink or float (a traditional method of identifying a witch, who it was believed would float, whereas an innocent would sink), but the resulting shock killed the elderly man, who was in his eighties. Another notable case of a cunning person performing cursing and malevolent witchcraft comes from nineteenth-century Norwich, where a wise woman who went by the pseudonym of &quot;Virtue&quot; used to demand gifts from her neighbours, threatening them with cursing if they refused.

== Magical beliefs and praxes ==
As historian Willem de Blécort noted, &quot;the different services the [cunning-folk] provided did not form part of an overall &#x27;magic&#x27; system&quot;. Indeed, whilst the magical practices of the cunning folk were typically folk magical in content, there were also those who dabbled in ceremonial magic, or &quot;high magic&quot;, based primarily on what they had gleaned from books of magic, or grimoires.

=== Spellcasting and charms ===
The cunning folk often produced written charms for their clients, which would be used in many ways, such as to protect from witchcraft or to help procure love. These typically contained a series of words that were believed to have magical powers, and which were commonly drawn either from grimoires or from the Bible. These might be produced on paper, which was the cheaper option, or, in certain cases, parchment, which according to certain magical texts should have been made from the skin of a virgin or unborn calf. &quot;Most written charms contained a strong religious content&quot;, typically invoking various names of God (such as Elohim, Adonai, Tetragrammaton etc) or of His angels to help the particular charm to be effective. In some cases they quoted whole sections from the Bible, sometimes in either Latin, Greek or Hebrew rather than the vernacular English. Or they used &quot;magic&quot; words, such as &quot;Abracadabra&quot; or the palindrome &quot;sator arepo tenet opera rotas&quot;. Such charms were then sometimes sewn into a bag, or placed within a bottle, and either carried about by the client or placed somewhere in their home.

In the 19th century, a ritual known as the toad bone rite became popular, particularly in East Anglia but also in other areas of the country, amongst both cunning folk and members of magical organizations such as the Scottish Society of the Horseman&#x27;s Word and the East Anglian Society of Horsemen. Originally based upon an ancient southern European magical practice documented by Pliny, it had later been purported in the works of Cornelius Agrippa and Reginald Scot, which were read by several literate cunning folk. Although there were many variations, the ritual typically involved the killing of a toad or frog, having its flesh stripped from the bones by ants, and then throwing the bone into a stream at night. It was believed that this would grant the practitioner, who was known as a Toad Man, the ability to perform certain magical tasks.

=== Grimoires ===

When printed books on the occult, particularly in the English language, had begun to be produced, some cunning folk obtained, and used, grimoires, or books of magic. In many cases they made a big show of the fact that they owned such tomes, which would have appeared impressive in the minds of many of their customers in a period where only a minority of people were able to read and write in Britain. Indeed, some cunning folk appeared to own these grimoires purely for cosmetic reasons, to impress their clients, and did not actually make use of any of the magical rituals contained within them.

Whilst grimoires had been around in Europe since the ancient period, and many new grimoires had been produced during the Medieval, they had remained highly expensive and hand written items that the average person would not have had access to. In the Early Modern period, this began to change as the invention of printing allowed grimoires to be produced in greater numbers; initially this had primarily been in languages other than English, particularly Latin, but in the mid-sixteenth century, English translations of Albertus Magnus&#x27; &quot;Book of Secrets&quot; were produced, whilst the printing of English-language grimoires increased in the seventeenth century. Another significant grimoire to be published in English was James Freake&#x27;s translation of Cornelius Agrippa&#x27;s &quot;Three Books of Occult Philosophy&quot;, which &quot;must have generated a good deal of interest among [the cunning folk] and other less well-educated magical practitioners at the time.&quot; Equally popular was the English astrologer Robert Turner&#x27;s translation of the &quot;Fourth Book of Occult Philosophy&quot; (1655), which was erroneously attributed to having been written by Agrippa.

However, perhaps &quot;the most influential vehicle for the dissemination of high magic to a wider audience was, in fact, Reginald Scot&#x27;s &quot;Discoverie of Witchcraft&quot;&quot;, a book first published in the early seventeenth century in which Scot condemned the cunning folk as liars and tricksters, but in which he had also provided a wide variety of talismans, charms and rituals as examples of what the cunning folk and ceremonial magicians used and performed. This book was subsequently republished on several occasions, and copies were obtained by a wide variety of cunning craft practitioners who used the information in the work to enhance their own magical praxes.

=== Familiar spirits and Fairyland ===
Some cunning folk were said to employ supernatural entities known as familiar spirits to aid them in their practice of magic. These spirits, which were also believed to work for witches as well, are referenced in many of the witch trial records from the Early Modern period. After examining these accounts, historian Emma Wilby noted how in the descriptions given of familiar spirits by both cunning folk and those accused of witchcraft, there was &quot;a pervading sense of naturalism&quot;, with most familiars resembling &quot;relatively ordinary humans or animals with only slight, if any, visual anomalies.&quot; For instance, folklorist Eric Maple noted that in the English region of East Anglia during the latter nineteenth century, it was commonly thought that familiar spirits, which were often referred to as &quot;imps&quot; in that region, took the form of white mice. There were however some exceptions to these naturalistic familiars, for instance a woman in Cambridgeshire was believed to have a familiar spirit that was a cross between a frog and a rat.
Wilby identified many similarities between the familiars recorded as serving cunning folk and those serving witches, with a general, though by no means universal, attribution of cunning folk&#x27;s familiars with being benevolent and helping people, whilst those belonging to witches were more often thought of as being malevolent and causing harm. Again, in general the former were often referred to as &quot;fairies&quot; and the latter as &quot;demons&quot;. Wilby noted how both British cunning folk and witches often described similar scenarios for how they had first encountered their familiar: most prominent of these was the claim that the familiar had simply appeared spontaneously whilst they went about their everyday activities, whilst other claims held that the witch or cunning person had inherited it from another magical practitioner, who was usually a family member, or that they had been given it by a more powerful spirit. The magical practitioner and the familiar then set about establishing a working relationship, sometimes solidified in a pact.

At times, the familiar spirit was believed to take the cunning person on a visionary journey to a place called &quot;Elfhame&quot; (literally meaning &quot;elf-home&quot;), which is now often referred to as Fairyland. In these trips, the cunning folk&#x27;s soul was typically believed to go with their familiar on a journey into a hill, within which they would find a great subterranean fairy hall. In the hall, they would find a company of fairies, led by a king and queen, and would take part in feasting, drinking and dancing. Wilby connected the cunning folk&#x27;s trip to Fairyland with the witches&#x27; believed trip to the sabbat meeting, which she also believed was a visionary journey. She accepted the theory, based upon the ideas of earlier historians such as Carlo Ginzburg and Éva Pócs, that the concept of the Witches&#x27; Sabbath was developed through the Christian demonizing of earlier pre-Christian concepts of the visit to Fairyland.

Historian Ronald Hutton remarked that &quot;It is quite possible that pre-Christian mythology lies behind this tradition&quot; of a belief in familiar spirits. Such an idea was supported by Wilby, who compared the accounts of familiar spirits in Britain with anthropological and ethnographic accounts of helper spirits given by shamans in both Siberia and North America. Noting a wide range of similarities between the two, she came to the conclusion that British belief in familiars must have been a surviving remnant of earlier animistic and shamanic beliefs in the pre-Christian religions of the island.

=== Christian elements ===

Britain throughout the late medieval and Early Modern periods was an almost entirely Christian society (with the only exception being a small Jewish population), although during this period there was a gradual shift from adherence to Roman Catholicism to forms of Anglicanism and Protestantism following the English Reformation in the sixteenth century. It was because of this that the cunning folk operating in this era typically worked within a Christian framework and world view.

This Christian influence was evident in much of their magical praxes. For instance, the historian Owen Davies believed that the written charms supplied by cunning folk displayed the &quot;intrinsic Christian content of [their] magic&quot; and the influence of mystical and magical words taken from the Bible. Historian Ronald Hutton concurred with this assessment, remarking that &quot;Looking at the recorded charms dispensed by magical practitioners, it is obvious that many – perhaps the majority – are Christian in character. They quote from the Bible, or appeal to the Trinity, or to Jesus, or to saints. In most cases, to be sure, they are using the trappings and symbols of Christianity with little regard to what the churchmen would have regarded as its essence; the Bible ... This is, however, a large part of what popular Christianity had always been about, and something that had caused learned and devout members of the faith to tear their hair at intervals ever since the time of the Church Fathers.&quot;

In keeping with the general population of the time, there were those cunning folk who were little more than nominal in their Christian belief as well as those that were devout. This was illustrated by historian James Obelkevitch in his examination of nineteenth-century popular religion in the southern part of the Lincolnshire chalk hills, when he note that the three main cunning people of the area, whilst each holding to a Christian worldview, each had different particular religious attachment. One of these, &quot;Fiddler&quot; Fynes, regularly attended church services and was an essentially conventional Christian for that period, whilst the second, John Worsdale of Lincoln, was similarly devout but was unconventional in that he rejected the need for a professional clergy. The third, Stainton of Louth, believed in a Christian theology and cosmology, but saw little point in worshipping the Christian God because he felt that in working with magic, &quot;the Devil has hold&quot; of him.

Although some twentieth and twenty-first century Neopagan authors, such as Rae Beth, have claimed that the British cunning folk were followers of a surviving, pre-Christian &quot;pagan&quot; religion, this is something rejected by historians. As Ronald Hutton noted, whilst there was pagan influences in some folk magical charms and a possible connection through the belief in familiar spirits, there is &quot;no known case of a cunning person or a charmer calling upon a pagan deity.&quot;

== History ==

=== Medieval period ===
In England during the early medieval period, various forms of folk magic could be found amongst the Anglo-Saxons, who referred to such practitioners as &quot;wicca&quot; (male) or &quot;wicce&quot; (female), or at times also as &quot;dry&quot;, practitioners of &quot;drycraeft&quot;, the latter of which have been speculated as being anglicised terms for the Irish , a term referring to druids, who appeared as anti-Christian sorcerers in much Irish literature of the period. Some of the spells and charms that had been used in the Anglo-Saxon pagan era continued to be used following Christianization. However, as historian Owen Davies noted, &quot;although some such pre-Christian magic continued, to label it pagan is to misrepresent the people who used it and the context in which it was used.&quot;

The extent to which elements from pre-Christian pagan religions influenced the cunning folk is debatable. Owen Davies believed that &quot;few historical insights are to be gained from seeking an archaic or shamanic lineage for cunning-folk.&quot; Such a claim has subsequently been challenged by Emma Wilby, who has put forward the case that the belief in familiar spirits, and the visionary journeys into Fairyland that sometimes accompanied them, were survivals from &quot;pre-Christian animism&quot;.

=== Early Modern period ===

==== England and Wales ====
In England and Wales, which were politically united by the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542, cunning folk had operated throughout the latter part of the medieval and into the Early Modern period. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, there had been no attempt to illegalise the cunning craft, although private lawsuits had been brought against some of them by those clients who felt that they had been cheated out of their money. This changed with the Witchcraft Act 1541, enacted under the reign of Henry VIII, which targeted both witches and cunning folk, and which prescribed the death penalty for such crimes as using invocations and conjurations to locate treasure or to cast a love spell. This law was repealed no later than 1547, under the reign of Henry&#x27;s son Edward VI, something that the historian Owen Davies believed was due to those in power changing their opinion on the law: they believed that either the death penalty was too harsh for such crimes or that the practice of the cunning craft was a moral issue that was better for the Church to deal with in ecclesiastic courts rather than a problem that had to be sorted out by the state.

For the following few decades, the magical practices of the cunning folk remained legal, despite opposition from certain religious authorities. It was a time of great religious upheaval in the country as Edward&#x27;s successor, his sister Mary I, reintroduced Roman Catholicism, before Anglicanism was once again reimposed under Elizabeth I. In 1563, after the return of power to the Anglican Church of England, a bill was passed by parliament designed to illegalise &quot;Conjurations, Enchantments and Witchcrafts&quot;, again being aimed at both the alleged witches and the cunning folk. However, this law was not as harsh as its earlier predecessor, with the death penalty being reserved for those who were believed to have conjured an evil spirit or murdered someone through magical means, whilst those for whom the use of magic was a first offence faced a year&#x27;s imprisonment and four stints in the pillory. Nonetheless, this law would have little effect on the cunning folk, as &quot;the attention and focus of the courts shifted away from the activities of cunning-folk and towards the &quot;maleficium&quot; of supposed witches&quot; – the Witch Hunt that had been raging in Scotland and in many parts of continental Europe had finally arrived in England.

Whilst across England, many people were accused of witchcraft by members of their local communities and put on trial, the cunning folk very rarely suffered a similar fate. It was unusual for a cunning man or woman to actually be accused of witchcraft; in the county of Essex for instance, whereas around four hundred people had been put on trial for witchcraft, only four of those were identifiably cunning folk. However, many of the professional witch-hunters and theologians continued to proclaim the cunning craft as being the same as witchcraft, with them both being caused by the Devil. One pamphlet published that espoused these views claimed that the cunning folk should be &quot;most cruelly executed: for that no punishment can bee [sic] thought upon, be it never so high a degree of torment, which may be deemed sufficient for such a divelish [sic] and danable [sic] practise.&quot; Their views however were not supported by the general population, who continued to see a distinct difference between witchcraft and cunning craft, with the witch-hunter John Stearne, an associate of Matthew Hopkins, remarking that whilst he and Hopkins wanted to prosecute the cunning folk, they could not because &quot;men rather uphold them, and say, why should any man be questioned for doing good.&quot;

Meanwhile, the idea of the cunning folk began to appear in the literature of the period. In 1638, the playwright Thomas Heywood published his comedy, &quot;The Wise Woman of Hogsdon&quot;, whilst in 1684 another playwright, Edward Ravenscroft, published his own play about a cunning woman. With the decline in the witch trials in the latter part of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, partly due to the rise of the Enlightenment amongst the educated elite, a new law was introduced, the Witchcraft Act 1735. Unlike earlier laws, this did not accept the existence of magic, and was designed to be used to prosecute those who claimed magical powers as being fraudulent; it could therefore be very damaging to the cunning profession. The new regulations imposed by the Witchcraft Act 1735 laid down a maximum penalty of a year&#x27;s imprisonment for the crime of deceiving people by claiming magical powers, but in effect, during the rest of the eighteenth century, there were very few prosecutions, with most authorities not bothering to enforce this particular law.

====Scotland====
Throughout the Early Modern period, Scotland remained a distinct political entity from England and Wales, having its own independent government and monarchy. However, like the rest of Britain, it also saw cunning folk operating within its borders.

A 1932 article by Lewis Spence in &quot;The Weekly Scotsman&quot;, responding to the popularization of Margaret Murray&#x27;s Witch-cult hypothesis, stated that &quot;the Saxon word &#x27;wicca&#x27;, a witch, as well as the term &#x27;carline&#x27; were of immemorial usage&quot; in lowland Scotland while in the highlands, where English words were less known, &#x27;wise women&#x27; or &quot;Nicnevins&quot; (&quot;daughters of heaven&quot;) were used. Spence argued that a native tradition had &quot;flourished&quot; in Scotland, and elsewhere in Britain, and, while it maintained many differences, had been greatly influenced by French practices from the mid-fifteenth century and this saw the introduction of the word &#x27;witch&#x27;. While still associating folk tradition with &#x27;witchcraft&#x27; he suggested it was &quot;a widespread cult of pagan origin, having a well-digested system of medical and magical lore of its own, a distant ritual, and with affiliations throughout the whole of the Lowlands and a certain part of the Highlands&quot;.

=== 19th and 20th centuries ===
By the 19th century, Scotland had been politically united with England, Wales and also Ireland as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, controlled by a central government in London. Such a political union also brought about an increase in cultural diffusion and unity between the various nations. It was in nineteenth-century Scotland that an agricultural organization that acted as both a trade union and a magical fraternity known as the Society of the Horseman&#x27;s Word was founded. Its members, whilst not being cunning folk, practiced folk magic, and soon an English alternative, the Society of Horsemen, had also been founded. The spread of such magical groups and their ideas could be seen in the diffusion of the toad bone rite, which was used by such horseman&#x27;s groups and various cunning folk, and examples of which could be found scattered across Britain, from Nevern in Pembrokeshire, Wales, to East Anglia in England.

At the start of the 19th century, the popularity of cunning folk continued, and there was still a large and lucrative market for their services, for instance in 1816, there were eight different wise women working independently in the English coastal town of Whitby. Nonetheless, the 19th century also saw an increase in the numbers of those cunning folk being prosecuted under the Witchcraft Act 1735, possibly because &quot;members of the social elite came to perceive that a faith in magic [far from having been eradicated as they had hoped,] seemed to be as prevalent among the populace as it had been a hundred years before, even while a growing political turbulence among commoners gave their rulers a new interest in the idea of education and civility as stabilizing forces.&quot; Soon after this, in 1824, a new law commonly referred to as the Vagrancy Act 1824 was introduced, bringing about a further blow to the cunning profession by outlawing &quot;persons pretending or professing to tell fortunes, or using any subtle craft, means and device, by palmistry or otherwise, to deceive and impose.&quot; The enacting of the law led to the increased prosecutions of cunning folk, something that would only begin to wane in the 1910s.

A news report from 1870 detailed a number of cases brought before authorities in the nineteenth century where claims of powers were made, but it ridiculed the belief, and closed with an example where &#x27;the charge was settled down to the more definite one of obtaining a shilling under false pretenses&#x27;.

By the beginning of the 20th century, the number of cunning folk across Britain had dropped markedly from that of a century before, and by the 1940s they had essentially vanished from the country. Despite this, other professional practitioners of popular magic, such as astrologers and fortune tellers, continued to remain popular. The historian Owen Davies believed that the primary reason for the decline in the cunning craft was the declining belief in the existence of malevolent witchcraft in the country (something brought about by modernization and increasing education and literacy rates), and therefore the collapse of any need for the anti-witchcraft measures that the cunning folk offered as their primary service. Whilst many of their magical practices continued to be used, being performed by folk and ceremonial magicians or being absorbed into new religious movements that used magic such as Wicca, Davies concluded that the actual profession itself died out. Historian Ronald Hutton however believed that it was more accurate to state that the cunning craft, rather than dying out, &quot;changed character&quot; by being absorbed into other magical currents. The decline of the cunning craft in Britain was not however indicative of other European nations: in Italy for example, cunning practitioners continued operating right into the early 21st century.

== Legacy ==

=== Modern occultists ===
Some of the magical practices and charms of the cunning-folk were passed down and continued to be used after the decline of the profession, although because they were no longer typically used to fight malevolent witchcraft in a professional sense, historian Owen Davies did not believe that those who practiced them could be accurately seen as cunning-folk. As he noted:

He noted that many of those currently referring to themselves as cunning-folk, wise women, white witches and the like during the 1990s and 2000s were explicitly Neopagan in their faith, which influenced their magical workings. He also noted that many of them referred to themselves as &quot;hedge witches&quot;, a term that was first developed by the writer Rae Beth in her book &quot;Hedge Witch: A Guide to Solitary Witchcraft&quot; (1990). Beth explicitly stated that the magical practices that she was purporting were the original practices of the cunning-folk, but she had incorrectly connected them to ancient paganism and the Witch-Cult. This was something Davies criticised, stating that:

Historian Ronald Hutton noted that the low magic of the cunning folk was one of the lesser influences upon the development of the Neopagan religion of Wicca and related witchcraft-based groups in the early twentieth century. For instance, one of the pioneering English Neopagan Witches, Robert Cochrane, who would describe himself under such titles as &quot;pellar&quot; and who led a coven known as the Clan of Tubal Cain in the early 1960s, allegedly incorporated elements borrowed from the cunning craft in his tradition, known as Cochrane&#x27;s Craft. Indeed, Shani Oates, one of his later followers, claimed that his tradition &quot;preserves many elements of 19th century cunning and folk magics&quot;. Hutton however also noted that although many Neopagan witches consider themselves to be the heirs of the cunning people, they &quot;have much more in common with the stereotypical images of witches in nineteenth-century popular culture; the very beings who were regarded as the natural enemies of the charmers and cunning people.&quot;

Whilst the historian Keith Thomas had touched upon the subject of English popular magic in his &quot;Religion and the Decline of Magic&quot; (1971), in a 1994 article on the subject of the cunning folk, the historian Willem de Blécourt stated that the study of the subject, &quot;properly speaking, has yet to start.&quot; These ideas were echoed in 1999, when the historian Ronald Hutton, in his &quot;The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft&quot;, remarked that the study of the cunning folk and European folk magic was &quot;notoriously, an area that has been comparatively neglected by academic scholars.&quot; Nonetheless, articles on the subject were published in the late 1990s, primarily by the historian Owen Davies, who in 2003 published &quot;Cunning-Folk: Popular Magic in English History&quot; (which was later republished under the altered title of &quot;Popular Magic: Cunning-folk in English History&quot; in 2007). This was followed in 2005 with the publication of Emma Wilby&#x27;s &quot;Cunning Folk and Familiar Spirits: Shamanistic Visionary Traditions in Early Modern British Witchcraft and Magic&quot;, which took an attitude to the cunning craft somewhat different from those of Hutton and Davies, emphasising a spiritual dimension to the magic of the cunning folk complementary to - and underpinning - its more practical aspects.

There are also examples of academic studies into specific British cunning folk. In 1960, the folklorist Eric Maple published articles on two nineteenth-century cunning men in East Anglia, James Murrell and George Pickingill. In 2004, Jason Semmens published a study of a nineteenth-century Cornish cunning-woman as &quot;The Witch of the West: Or, The Strange and Wonderful History of Thomasine Blight&quot;.

<text>The Skjálfandafljót River () is situated in the north of Iceland. Skjálfandafljót is long, and is the fourth longest river of Iceland.

It has its source at the northwestern border of the icecap Vatnajökull on the Highlands of Iceland. From there it streams parallel to the Sprengisandur Highland road in a northern direction, flowing finally into Skjálfandi bay.

By following the river from its source at the Vatnajökull glacier all the way to the river mouth at Skjálfandi bay it&#x27;s possible to see many waterfalls. Skjálfandafljót possesses a number of waterfalls, including Goðafoss. Other well-known waterfalls in Skjálfandafljót include Hrafnabjargafoss, Aldeyjarfoss, Barnafoss and Ullarfoss. 1

It was first descended by kayak by a team from the University of Sheffield (UK) in 1989.

At the north end of the Sprengisandur road, the river drops down 10m over Aldeyjarfoss. Goðafoss is in the lowlands, very near Route 1.

There have been proposals to build a hydroelectricity power station along the river.

<text>Kamala Markandaya (23 June 1924 – 16 May 2004), pseudonym of Kamala Purnaiya, married name Kamala Taylor, was a British Indian novelist and journalist. She has been called &quot;one of the most important Indian novelists writing in English&quot;.

==Life==
===Early life===
Markandaya was born into an upper-middle-class Deshastha Madhva Brahmin family. A native of Mysore, India, Markandaya was a graduate of Madras University, and afterwards published several short stories in Indian newspapers. After India declared its independence, Markandaya moved to Britain, though she still labelled herself an Indian expatriate long afterwards. Kamala was a descendant of diwan Purnaiya and was fluent in Kannada and Marathi.

===Career===
She was well-known for writing about culture clash between Indian urban and rural societies, Markandaya&#x27;s first published novel, &quot;Nectar in a Sieve&quot; (1954), was a bestseller and cited as an American Library Association Notable Book in 1955. Her other novels include &quot;Some Inner Fury&quot; (1955), &quot;A Silence of Desire&quot; (1960), &quot;Possession&quot; (1963), &quot;A Handful of Rice&quot; (1966), &quot;The Coffer Dams&quot; (1969), &quot;The Nowhere Man&quot; (1972), &quot;Two Virgins&quot; (1973), &quot;The Golden Honeycomb&quot; (1977), and &quot;Pleasure City&quot; (1982). Her last novel, &quot;Bombay Tiger&quot;, was published posthumously (2008) by her daughter Kim Oliver.
Her First Published Novel&#x27;s Title &quot;Nectar in a Sieve&quot; (1954) had been taken from S.T. Coleridge&#x27;s Poem &quot;Work without Hope&quot; - &quot;Work without Hope draws nectar in a sieve,
And Hope without an object cannot live.&quot;

===Death===
Kamala Markandaya died aged 79 on 16 May 2004.
