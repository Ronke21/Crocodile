<doc id="668265" wikidata="Q452563" url="?curid=668265" title="Colin Bell (footballer, born 1946)">
<text>Colin Bell (26 February 1946 – 5 January 2021) was an English professional footballer who played as a midfielder. Bell, known for his thirteen-year spell at Manchester City, is regarded as one of the club&#x27;s greatest-ever players, and was part of the Bell–Lee–Summerbee trio in the late 1960s and 1970s. Bell made 48 appearances for the England national football team; he was an unused squad member at UEFA Euro 1968 and played in three matches at the 1970 FIFA World Cup.

During his playing career, he was nicknamed &quot;The King of the Kippax&quot; (after Maine Road&#x27;s Kippax Street terraced stand renowned for its singing) and Nijinsky (after the famous racehorse, due to his renowned stamina). In 2004, the West Stand of City of Manchester Stadium was later named in his honour.

==Club career==
Bell began his career at Bury where he was swiftly made club captain. In total, Bell made 82 league appearances for Bury (in three seasons) and scored 25 goals. In 1966, he moved to Manchester City (who were managed by Joe Mercer) for £45,000. When trying to sign him for Manchester City, assistant manager Malcolm Allison misled other clubs interested in Bell (including Leicester City) by claiming that the player was &quot;hopeless&quot;. Allison&#x27;s stratagem succeeded as Bell ultimately signed for City. In the 1965–66 season, Bell helped City finish first in the Second Division, earning the team promotion to the First Division. Bell scored the only goal (via a header) in a 1–0 victory against Rotherham which ensured promotion. In the 1966–67 season, Bell was City&#x27;s top scorer with 14 league goals, and the team finished in 15th place in the First Division. Bell scored a hat trick in a 3–1 victory against Stoke City in April that season.

In the 1967–68 season, Bell helped City win their second League Championship (they had won their first in 1937). Bell scored 14 league goals that season. One of his goals came in the famous 4–1 victory against Tottenham Hotspur, at Maine Road, which was dubbed the &quot;Ballet on Ice&quot; due to the snowy conditions in which the game was played. Mike Summerbee, Tony Coleman and Neil Young scored City&#x27;s other goals while Jimmy Greaves scored the goal for Spurs. After the game, legendary centre forward Dixie Dean informed Allison that the City team which had beaten Spurs was &quot;the most brilliant side I have ever seen&quot;. In the penultimate game of the season, Bell scored twice in a 3–1 victory against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane. In the game, Lee and Summerbee stretched the Spurs defence allowing Bell a clear run at a slowing Dave Mackay which overwhelmed the Scotsman. In the final game of the season, City defeated Newcastle United 4–3, to clinch the title. Bell assisted Lee with the &quot;best pass of the afternoon&quot; to score City&#x27;s fourth goal.

In the 1968–69 season, Bell again scored 14 league goals as City finished 13th in the First Division. Manchester City won the FA Cup that season with a 1–0 victory over Leicester City in the final thanks to a goal by Neil Young. In the 1969–70 season, Bell scored eleven league goals for City, who finished tenth in the league. Manchester City and Bell won two trophies, in 1970, the League Cup and the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. City defeated West Bromwich Albion 2–1 in the 1970 Football League Cup Final, in which Mike Doyle and Glyn Pardoe scored City&#x27;s goals. City defeated Górnik Zabrze 2–1 in the 1970 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup Final with goals from Young and Francis Lee.

In the 1970–71 season, Bell scored 13 goals for City, who finished eleventh in the First Division. In the following season, City challenged for the title but ultimately lost out to Derby County and finished fourth in the league. Bell scored 13 goals that season. In the 1972–73 season, City finished eleventh in the league. In the 1973–74 season, Bell helped City reach the 1974 Football League Cup Final, in which he scored in a 2–1 defeat to Wolverhampton Wanderers. Bell played for City in a 1–0 victory against Manchester United in the final game of the season. Denis Law scored the only goal in the game which confirmed United&#x27;s relegation from the First Division. In the 1974–75 season, Bell scored 15 league goals. He was named in the 1974–75 Football League First Division PFA Team of the Year. In November 1975, at the age of 29, Bell severely injured his right knee against Manchester United in a challenge with Martin Buchan during a League Cup match at Maine Road. City went on to win the League Cup that season, defeating Newcastle 2–1 in the 1976 Football League Cup Final. Bell&#x27;s prolonged absence due to his injury was a blow to Don Revie, who quit as manager of England in 1977. Bell returned to action in a 4–0 victory against Newcastle on Boxing Day in 1977. His introduction to the game, at half time, was greeted with rapturous applause. However, Bell&#x27;s return to City was fleeting as he left City in the 1978–79 season. Malcolm Allison, who returned to City for a second spell as manager in 1979, convinced Bell that it was time to go. The then-chairman Peter Swales described Bell as the &quot;finest tuned athlete&quot; and &quot;irreplaceable&quot;. This latter sentiment turned out to be true as Allison was not able to find a trio of talented players of the calibre of Bell, Summerbee and Lee as he had done in the past with Joe Mercer. Bell&#x27;s testimonial took place in December 1978 and involved a Manchester team combining players from both Manchester City (such as Joe Corrigan, Willie Donachie, David Watson, Gary Owen, Asa Hartford and Peter Barnes) and Manchester United (such as Brian Greenhoff, Martin Buchan, Steve Coppell and Joe Jordan) and a Merseyside team combining players from both Liverpool (such as Ray Clemence, Kenny Dalglish and Graeme Souness) and Everton (such as Mick Lyons and Bob Latchford). A crowd of 23,936 watched the game. The Manchester team won 2–1. Bell tried to resurrect his career in 1980 with NASL side San Jose Earthquakes, where he joined former Manchester United player George Best. However, Bell ended up playing only five games for the club before retiring from football altogether.

==International career==
Bell played twice for the England Under 23 team in 1968. He played in a 2–1 victory against Scotland Under 23 team in which Martin Chivers and Rodney Marsh scored for the England Under 23 team. He also played in a 4–0 victory against the Hungary Under 23 team. Bell scored one of the four goals. The other scorers were Chivers, Marsh and Joe Royle. In the same year, Bell was selected for the senior England squad for a match against Spain, in May, but was forced to withdraw from the squad due to injury. Bell was replaced by Peter Thompson. Later in the same month, Bell won his first cap for the senior England team against Sweden, where he helped inspire goals from Martin Peters, Bobby Charlton and Roger Hunt in a 3–1 victory. One journalist stated that Bell &#x27;revealed high promise and fitted in splendidly&#x27;. Bell won his second cap in a 1–0 defeat to West Germany in which Brian Labone scored an own goal. Bell was part of the England squad for UEFA Euro 1968, which was ultimately won by Italy. England finished third in the tournament after defeating the Soviet Union in the third-place match.

In 1969, Bell distinguished himself in the national team, scoring England&#x27;s only goal in a 1–0 victory over the Netherlands in an &quot;all-action display&quot;. Bell was part of the England squad which toured South America in 1969. Brian Glanville contended that both Bell and Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Alan Mullery excelled on the tour. Bell gave England an early lead in a game against Brazil, but late goals from Tostão and Jairzinho gave Brazil a 2–1 victory. Bell also played in a 2–1 victory against Uruguay on the tour. He also helped England to win the 1968–69 British Home Championship. He played in a 2–1 victory against Wales in which Bobby Charlton and Francis Lee scored England&#x27;s goals.

===1970 FIFA World Cup===
Bell played in the 1969–70 British Home Championship, which was shared between England, Wales and Scotland. He replaced Keith Newton in a 3–1 victory against Northern Ireland. He was subsequently included in the England squad for the World Cup in Mexico. Glanville contends that Bell&#x27;s excellence was threatening Bobby Charlton&#x27;s place in the England team. England were seeking to replicate their performance in the 1966 FIFA World Cup, which they had won. Bell&#x27;s City teammate Francis Lee was also included in the squad. In order to help the players acclimatise to the heat of Mexico, the team staged an intra-squad mini-olympics which saw Bell win every event. In the group stage, Bell came on as a substitute in a 1–0 defeat to Brazil, in which Jairzinho scored the only goal. Bell &quot;added spark to the England offence in the latter stages&quot; of the game. Bell started in the next game, a 1–0 victory against Czechoslovakia, in which Allan Clarke scored the only goal.

In the quarter-final, Bell replaced Bobby Charlton in a 2–3 defeat to West Germany. England had taken a 2–0 lead in the game through goals from Alan Mullery and Martin Peters. Franz Beckenbauer had pulled a goal back for West Germany before the substitution. Following the substitution of Charlton and another substitution (Peters was replaced by Norman Hunter), the Germans scored twice (Uwe Seeler and Gerd Müller were the scorers). Bell was involved in creating chances for England following his introduction. At one point in the game, Bell sent in a low cross to the near post, but Hurst headed the ball just wide of the far one. At another point in the game, Bell beat Beckenbauer in the German penalty area and was then knocked down by the German player, but England were not awarded a penalty. The substitution was deemed by some to be the negative (for England) turning point of the game. However, West Germany scored their first goal before Charlton was substituted, and the fact that the German team at the time had a habit of coming back in games indicates that it was questionable to blame the substitutions for England&#x27;s defeat. West Germany were subsequently defeated by Italy 4–3 in the semi-final. Italy were eventually defeated 4–1 by Brazil in the final. Charlton asserted that the absence of Gordon Banks (he was replaced in goal by Peter Bonetti) through sickness was the most important factor in England&#x27;s defeat to the West Germans. Similarly, Glanville argued that &quot;had Banks played, England would surely have won&quot;. Geoff Hurst stated that &quot;to suggest that Colin Bell&#x27;s inclusion weakened the team is patently unfair&quot;. Alan Ball described the substitutions as wise given the need to rest players for the prospective semi-final.

===Failure to qualify after 1970===
Bell also played for England in the 1971–72 British Home Championship which was shared with Scotland. Bell scored in a 3–0 victory against Wales (with Rodney Marsh and Emlyn Hughes scoring England&#x27;s other goals). Bell also captained England (in Bobby Moore&#x27;s absence) in a 1–0 defeat to Northern Ireland. In addition, Bell played in a 1–0 victory over Scotland (in which Alan Ball scored the winner). Bell also played in a 3–1 defeat and a 0–0 draw with West Germany in 1972, which meant that England failed to qualify for UEFA Euro 1972. In the first game, Sepp Maier had spilled a shot from Bell which Lee tapped in to equalise Uli Hoeneß&#x27; first half goal. However, late goals from Günter Netzer and Gerd Müller secured victory for the West Germans. In November 1972, Bell &quot;cashed in on clever approach work by Alan Ball to score the decisive winning goal&quot; in a 1–0 victory over Wales in a World Cup qualification game at Ninian Park. Bell played in the other qualification game against Wales at Wembley, which ended 1–1. Bell was described as having &#x27;excellent technique&#x27; and rated as the &#x27;best England player&#x27; in the game as he &#x27;was always trying to find a way through the packed Welsh defence&#x27;.

In 1973, Bell scored in the 7–0 demolition of Austria. In the game Bell, along with Martin Peters and Tony Currie &quot;dictated the pace and pattern of the match from midfield&quot;. Bell also helped England to win the 1972–73 British Home Championship. He played in a 2–1 victory against Northern Ireland, a 3–0 victory against Wales and a 1–0 victory against Scotland. Despite these successes, Bell was upset that he was unable to better make his name on the world stage when England failed to qualify for the 1974 FIFA World Cup. England had needed to defeat Poland to qualify.
Poland&#x27;s goalkeeper Jan Tomaszewski had been labelled &quot;a clown&quot; by Brian Clough before the match but turned in a man-of-the-match performance in which he repeatedly denied England&#x27;s attackers (including Bell). The only goal that Tomaszewski conceded was an equalizing penalty from Allan Clarke. In drawing the game, Poland qualified for the finals in West Germany at the expense of England. England&#x27;s failure led to manager Alf Ramsey&#x27;s departure. Bell&#x27;s former manager at Manchester City, Joe Mercer (who had left City in 1971), took over as caretaker of the national side and chose Bell to play in every game that he was in charge.

Bell also played for England in the 1973–74 British Home Championship which was shared with Scotland. Bell played in a 2–0 victory against Wales (in which Stan Bowles and Kevin Keegan were the scorers), a 1–0 victory against Northern Ireland and a 2–0 defeat to Scotland. Bell played for England in a 2–2 draw against Argentina in which Mick Channon and Frank Worthington scored for England and Mario Kempes scored twice for Argentina. He was also part of the England squad that toured Eastern Europe in the summer of 1974. This included a 1–1 draw with East Germany, in &quot;which Martin Dobson, (Colin) Bell and Trevor Brooking dominated the match in midfield&quot;. In the second game of the tour, England defeated Bulgaria 1–0. The performance of England&#x27;s midfield trio (Bell, Brooking and Dobson) in the game was described as &quot;tremendous&quot;. In the last game of the tour (which was Mercer&#x27;s last game as England manager), England drew 2–2 with Yugoslavia.

Bell scored a brace in Don Revie&#x27;s first game in charge of England, a 3–0 victory over Czechoslovakia. Bell was described as &#x27;one of the outstanding successes for England in their European Championship game with Czechoslovakia at Wembley&#x27;. A &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; journalist described Bell as the &#x27;man of the match&#x27;. 
One journalist described &#x27;Bell&#x27;s first goal as one of the best I&#x27;ve seen at Wembley. It began with a superb 30-yard pass through the Czech defence by Channon and Bell, running like an antelope, slid the ball past the goalkeeper&#x27;. In Revie&#x27;s third game in charge, Bell helped England defeat the then World Champions, Germany, 2–0, in 1975, at the one hundredth international game played at Wembley Stadium. The team that beat the Germans in that game consisted of a forward line-up of Channon, Keegan, Malcolm Macdonald, Alan Hudson and Alan Ball, as well as Bell. Channon commented that he did not understand why Revie did not continue with this line-up which he considered was as good as any forward line England had had since 1970. In the game against the West Germans, the energy and tackling of Bell and Ball had freed Hudson to show his full range of playmaking skills. Bell also helped England to win the 1974–75 British Home Championship. Bell played in a 0–0 draw with Northern Ireland, and a 5–1 victory against Scotland (in which he also scored). Bell was rested for the game with Wales, which ended in a 2–2 draw. One journalist commenting about Bell&#x27;s absence before that game stated that &#x27;England will undoubtedly miss the non-stop running and 100 per cent effort of the consistent Colin Bell&#x27;. Bell won his last cap in a 2–1 defeat to Czechoslovakia in October 1975. Bell was named in the provisional squad for the 1975–76 British Home Championship but was unable to feature due to injury.

====Other international appearances====
In January 1973, Bell played for the New European Common Market (NECM), alongside Peter Storey, Emlyn Hughes, Bobby Moore, Bobby Charlton and Alan Ball, in the match celebrating the admission to the European Common Market of the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and Denmark. NECM defeated the Old European Common Market (OECM) 2–0. In addition, in March 1974, Bell scored a goal in a 5–0 victory for The Football League XI against the Scottish Football League XI at Maine Road.

==Later life==
Bell subsequently became a coach for the youth and reserve teams of Manchester City, as well as one of its club ambassadors. He was awarded an MBE in 2004 for services to the community.

Bell was diagnosed with bowel cancer shortly after his autobiography, &quot;Reluctant Hero&quot;, was released in 2005. He detailed how his mother died from that same disease and was encouraged to have it examined himself. He was operated on within three weeks of the diagnosis. He died on 5 January 2021 at the age of 74. He suffered from a short illness in the time leading up to his death. On 6 January 2021, Manchester City&#x27;s players walked out in retro shirts bearing Bell&#x27;s No 8 for a Carabao Cup semi-final against Manchester United. City won the game 2-0 with goals from John Stones and Fernandinho. Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola dedicated the victory to Bell, stating that &#x27;it&#x27;s an honour to dedicate this victory to Colin Bell and his family&#x27;. Guardiola also stated that &#x27;when Colin Bell has a stand at the Etihad, when his name is the King [of the Kippax], it&#x27;s because he was something special&#x27;. Stones also dedicated the victory to Bell stating that &#x27;how we played in this match was a reflection of him&#x27;. On 9 January 2021, the actor Timothy Dalton narrated a tribute to Bell on the BBC programme &quot;Football Focus&quot;. In May 2022, Manchester City unveiled a new home kit inspired by Bell.

==Legacy==
Bell is regarded as one of England&#x27;s finest-ever midfield players, being described by one commentator as &quot;the most finished article in the modern game&quot;. Bell has been inducted into both the English Football Hall of Fame and the Manchester City Hall of Fame. In 1998 he was selected as one of the Football League 100 Legends. In his foreword to Colin Bell&#x27;s autobiography, Bobby Charlton has stated that &quot;Colin Bell was unquestionably a great player&quot;. Alan Mullery, another of Bell&#x27;s former England teammates stated that Bell would &quot;still be a star in today&#x27;s football&quot; and &quot;would fit into any team&quot;. Another England teammate of Bell&#x27;s, Kevin Keegan, has stated that Bell &quot;had it all&quot;. England legend Tom Finney stated that &quot;Colin Bell was as good as anything I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;. George Best described Bell as a &quot;brilliant player&quot;. Joe Royle described Bell as a &quot;phenomenal natural athlete&quot; and &quot;a wonderful footballer&quot;. Steven Gerrard has been compared to Bell. Journalist Dave Maddock described Bell as &quot;possibly the greatest midfield talent England has ever unearthed&quot;. In 2003, Manchester City moved into the new City of Manchester Stadium, and in February 2004, one of the ends, the west stand, was named after Bell as a tribute. Only three players have scored more goals than Bell for Manchester City in all competitions: Sergio Agüero with 252 goals, Eric Brook with 177 goals and Tommy Johnson with 166 goals. Bell scored 152 goals for Manchester City in all competitions. He was deemed by Goal.com to be England&#x27;s twenty-sixth best-ever footballer. He is listed as the greatest-ever City player on the &quot;Times&quot; website, in Ian Penney&#x27;s book &quot;The Essential History of Manchester City&quot;, and in the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot;.

<text>George Dickel is a brand of Tennessee whisky produced in Tullahoma, in Coffee County, Tennessee. Today owned by Diageo, the modern brand was introduced in 1964, though the distillery has a longer history. Whisky production and aging takes place at the Cascade Hollow Distillery, which offers tours to the public and is part of the American Whiskey Trail. George Dickel operates the second-largest distillery in Tennessee, selling 130,000 cases in 2013, while the largest is Jack Daniel&#x27;s, which sold 11.5 million cases the same year.

The brand&#x27;s labels use the traditional Scottish spelling of &quot;whisky&quot;, instead of the more common American English spelling: &quot;whiskey&quot;. According to the company, this is because Dickel believed his product to be as smooth and high in quality as the best Scotch whiskies.

==History==
George A. Dickel was born in Germany in 1818, and immigrated to the United States in 1844. He founded a retail business in Nashville, Tennessee, in the 1850s, and began selling liquor in 1861. After the Civil War, he operated a liquor store on South College Street in Nashville. In the late 1860s, he founded George A. Dickel and Company, a wholesaling firm which bought whiskey from regional distillers and distributed it in barrels, jugs and bottles. In 1871, Meier Saltzkotter, who had worked as a superintendent for Dickel, became a partner in the company. Victor Emmanuel Shwab (1847–1924), a brother-in-law of Dickel who had initially worked for the company as a bookkeeper, became a partner in 1881.

George A. Dickel and Company was selling whiskey produced in Cascade Hollow, near Normandy, Tennessee, by John F. Brown and F.E. Cunningham in the 1870s. In 1879, Matthew Sims, a local businessman, bought Brown&#x27;s share of the operation. In 1883, another local businessman, McLin Davis (1852–1898), joined the partnership. Davis became the operation&#x27;s distiller, and is credited with the whisky&#x27;s recipe. By the early 1890s, Cascade Whisky was one of the more popular brands in the region. The Cascade label included the phrase, &quot;Mellow as Moonlight&quot;, which was rooted in Davis&#x27;s method of cooling mash at night.
Following an accident in 1886, Dickel&#x27;s health declined, and Shwab gradually took control of the wholesaling firm&#x27;s daily operations. In 1888, Shwab purchased Sims&#x27;s share of the Cascade Distillery, whose whiskey Dickel and Company had been selling for years. The terms of the purchase made Dickel and Company the sole distributor of Cascade. Shwab also purchased the popular Climax Saloon in Nashville, and afterward advertised the saloon as the &quot;headquarters&quot; of Cascade Whisky. After Davis&#x27;s death in 1898, his son, Norman Davis, briefly ran the distillery, but was sued by Shwab and forced to sell his share in the operation.

Following Dickel&#x27;s death in 1894, his share of Dickel and Company was willed to his wife, Augusta. Though he had advised her to sell out, she retained her share of the company, but did not participate in its operations. Upon her death in 1916, she willed her share to Shwab.

Throughout the early 1900s, Shwab fought vehemently against the rising calls for prohibition, spending thousands of dollars on lobbying campaigns in Nashville, and thwarting legislation aimed at curtailing the sale of alcohol on at least one occasion. In spite of his efforts, Tennessee enacted prohibition in 1910, forcing the Cascade operation to relocate to the Stitzel Distillery in Louisville, Kentucky. It was produced here until Kentucky enacted statewide prohibition in 1917. The operation shut down altogether with the onset of nationwide prohibition in 1920.

In 1933, national prohibition was repealed. Four years later, Shwab&#x27;s heirs sold the Cascade brand to the Schenley Distilling Company. The recipe had never been written down, and had to be obtained from two former distillers at the Cascade Hollow site. In the 1940s and 1950s, Schenley&#x27;s product, produced at the OFC Distillery in Frankfort, Kentucky, was marketed as &quot;Geo. A. Dickel&#x27;s Cascade Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whisky&quot;.

In 1956, Schenley attempted to buy the Jack Daniel&#x27;s brand. After its offer was refused, Schenley decided instead to return one of their own brands to its roots and compete against Jack Daniel&#x27;s. In 1958, after the passage of enabling legislation making it legal to produce liquor in Coffee County, Tennessee, Schenley&#x27;s Ralph Dupps reconstructed the Cascade Hollow distillery. The new distillery is located about a mile from the old distillery site, but still utilizes the waters of Cascade Branch and the Lincoln County Process for mellowing. The first mash was produced at the new distillery on July 4, 1959, and George Dickel Tennessee Whisky was first bottled in 1964. Schenley opted to use George Dickel&#x27;s name as the trademark because of Cascade&#x27;s reputation as a value brand. Various mergers and buyouts have resulted in Diageo owning the Dickel brand.
Increased production of George Dickel in the 1990s caused supply to exceed demand. In response, the distillery closed to allow the whisky&#x27;s value to rebound and mitigate some wastewater issues at the distillery. The original site of the distillery at the south end of Cascade Hollow was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. The distillery reopened in 2003, almost too late to prevent a shortage of Old No. 8 in the market by 2007. Diageo introduced a younger, three-year-old version branded &quot;Old-Fashioned Cascade Hollow Batch Recipe&quot; to meet demand. It was discontinued in 2013, after aged stocks rebounded sufficiently.

&quot;George Dickel Rye&quot;, introduced in 2012, is the only Dickel product not produced at the Cascade Hollow Distillery. It is produced under contract by MGP Ingredients in Lawrenceburg, Indiana, and is mashed, distilled and aged there before being trucked to the Diageo facility in Plainfield, Illinois, for charcoal filtering and bottling.

In early 2014, Diageo introduced a Dickel &quot;No. 1 Foundation Recipe&quot;, using an unaged version of its standard mashbill of more than 80% corn, allowing for its sale as &quot;corn whisky&quot;. Also around 2014, a new bottling line was installed at the distillery.

From 2005 to 2015, Cascade Distillery operated under the supervision of Master Distiller John Lunn. In March 2015, the company announced Lunn was leaving to become the master distiller for Popcorn Sutton microdistillery. Nicole Austin took over as general manager and distiller of Cascade Hollow Distilling Co. in March 2018. Prior to joining the Dickel team, she spent two years in Ireland serving as Tullamore D.E.W.&#x27;s commissioning engineer at its grain distillery in Offaly. Austin began her distilling career in 2010 as a master blender for Kings County Distillery.

==Production process==
The mash for George Dickel is composed of 84% corn, 8% rye, and 8% malted barley. Distillate is chilled to and mellowed in vats filled with of charcoal for several days (their implementation of the Lincoln County process) before being placed in barrels at 55 proof.

The distillery&#x27;s barrel warehouses are one story high, minimizing variation in barrel aging. Whisky is aged for at least five years before it is considered for bottling. all products were further chill filtered and calcium imparted by the barrel aging is removed.

==Products==

Several whiskies are produced under the George Dickel brand: 
*&quot;Old No. 8 Brand&quot; with a black label, at 80 proof
*&quot;Superior No. 12 Brand&quot; with a beige label, at 90 proof
And others.

They also produce a very small selection of George Dickel Hand Selected Barrel aged at 9 years, solely produced for barrel purchasing members.

==Reviews and awards==
Food critic Morgan Murphy said &quot;Distilled twice, the white dog (No. 1 Foundation Recipe) at Dickel is chilled then filtered through wool blankets and maple sugar charcoal before it is put into the barrel and the result is smooth, sweet (but not overly so), and peppery.&quot;

In 2015, several George Dickel brands won awards at the 15th Annual San Francisco World Spirits Competition. George Dickel No. 12 was named &quot;Best Tennessee Whiskey&quot; and won a double gold medal. George Dickel Rye Whisky also won double gold, while George Dickel Barrel Select Tennessee Whisky earned a gold designation.

<text>The Other Two are an English dance band consisting of husband-and-wives Stephen Morris and Gillian Gilbert, who both of them are from New Order. The band name refers to the fact that the other New Order members, Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook, had already embarked on side projects by the time the first The Other Two record was released. Their debut single &quot;Tasty Fish&quot; was released in 1991 and peaked at 41 in the UK Singles Chart.

The Other Two have released two albums, &quot;The Other Two &amp; You&quot; (1993) and &quot;Super Highways&quot; (1999).

== Albums ==
===&quot;The Other Two and You &quot;===
Initially conceived from the remnants of unused soundtrack work and various studio experiments, The Other Two began during a hiatus in New Order activity. They decided to feature a female vocalist, and in early stages Kim Wilde was recruited as a potential singer for the group. Ultimately however, Gilbert would take over on vocals, and performs on both Other Two albums.

Lead single &quot;Tasty Fish&quot; was released in 1991 to positive reviews. However, due to the collapse of Factory Records, &quot;The Other Two &amp; You&quot; could not be released as initially planned. The release of New Order&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot; in the meantime meant that &quot;The Other Two &amp; You&quot; was delayed until November 1993, finally being released on London Records. &quot;Selfish&quot; was chosen as a second single, and &quot;Innocence&quot; was also released as a club 12-inch in the US.

===&quot;Super Highways &quot;===
A follow-up album, &quot;Super Highways&quot; was released by London in March 1999. The album featured guest vocalist and co-writer Melanie Williams from dance act Sub Sub on selected tracks (&quot;You Can Fly&quot;, &quot;One Last Kiss&quot;, &quot;Super Highways&quot;).

== Soundtracks ==
The Other Two have been involved in motion picture scoring; particularly TV soundtracks. Most notably they created a theme song for the TV series &quot;Common As Muck&quot; (the track &quot;New Horizons&quot; has elements of this theme tune), as well as the theme for &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;. Other soundtrack work includes the series &quot;Cold Feet&quot;, &quot;Making Out&quot; and series two of &quot;Cracker&quot;. The Other Two also created music for the UK TV programme &quot;Reportage&quot;, although this was credited as New Order and would be adapted into their 1990 World Cup song &quot;World in Motion.&quot;

==Other work==
Morris and Gilbert reportedly considered assembling a third album around 2010 from other production work, although this did not materialise. The name was also used for Morris and Gilbert&#x27;s 2014 remix of a Tim Burgess track. 
In 2022, the duo did a remix of a LoneLady track, &quot;(There Is) No Logic&quot;.

<text>Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), also called frontotemporal degeneration disease or frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder, encompasses several types of dementia involving the progressive degeneration of the brain&#x27;s frontal and temporal lobes. Men and women appear to be equally affected. FTD generally presents as a behavioral or language disorder with gradual onset. Signs and symptoms tend to appear in late adulthood, typically between the ages of 45 and 65, although it can affect people younger or older than this. Currently, no cure or approved symptomatic treatment for FTD exists, although some off-label drugs and behavioral methods are prescribed.

Features of FTD were first described by Arnold Pick between 1892 and 1906. The name &quot;Pick&#x27;s disease&quot; was coined in 1922. This term is now reserved only for the behavioral variant of FTD, in which characteristic Pick bodies and Pick cells are present. These were first described by Alois Alzheimer in 1911. Common signs and symptoms include significant changes in social and personal behavior, disinhibition, apathy, blunting and dysregulation of emotions, and deficits in both expressive and receptive language. 

Each FTD subtype is relatively rare. FTDs are mostly early onset syndromes linked to frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), which is characterized by progressive neuronal loss predominantly involving the frontal or temporal lobes, and a typical loss of more than 70% of spindle neurons, while other neuron types remain intact. The three main subtypes or variant syndromes are a behavioral variant (bvFTD) previously known as &quot;Pick&#x27;s disease&quot;, and two variants of primary progressive aphasia (PPA): semantic (svPPA) and nonfluent (nfvPPA). Two rare distinct subtypes of FTD are neuronal intermediate filament inclusion disease (NIFID) and basophilic inclusion body disease (BIBD). Other related disorders include corticobasal syndrome (CBS or CBD), and FTD with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

==Signs and symptoms==
Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is an early onset disorder that mostly occurs between the ages of 45 and 65, but can begin earlier, and in 20–25% of cases onset is later. Men and women appear to be equally affected. It is the most common early presenting dementia. FTD is the second most prevalent type of early onset dementia after Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

The International Classification of Diseases recognizes the disease as causative to disorder affecting mental and behavioural aspects of the human organism. Dissociation from family, compulsive buying disorder (oniomania), vulgar speech characteristics, screaming, inability to control emotions, behavior, personality, and temperament are characteristic social display patterns. A gradual onset and progression of changes in behavior or language deficits are reported to have begun several years prior to presentation to a neurologist.

==Subtypes and related disorders==
The main subtypes of frontotemporal dementia are behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD), two variants of primary progressive aphasia – semantic dementia (svPPA) and progressive nonfluent aphasia (nfvPPA) – as well as FTD associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FTD–ALS or FTD-MND). Two distinct rare subtypes are neuronal intermediate filament inclusion disease (NIFID), and basophilic inclusion body disease (BIBD). Related disorders are corticobasal syndrome (CBS or CBD), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).

===Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia===
Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (BvFTD) was previously known as &quot;Pick&#x27;s disease&quot;, and is the most common of the FTD types. BvFTD is diagnosed four times as often as the PPA variants. Behavior can change in BvFTD in either of two ways—it can change to being impulsive and disinhibited, acting in socially unacceptable ways; or it can change to being listless and apathetic. About 12–13% of people with bvFTD develop motor neuron disease.

The Pick bodies which are present in behavioral variant FTD are spherical inclusion bodies found in the cytoplasm of affected cells. They consist of tau fibrils as a major component together with a number of other protein products including ubiquitin and tubulin.

===Semantic dementia===
Semantic dementia (SD) is characterized by the loss of semantic understanding, resulting in impaired word comprehension. However, speech remains fluent and grammatical.

===Progressive nonfluent aphasia===
Progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) is characterized by progressive difficulties in speech production.

===Neuronal intermediate filament inclusion disease===
Neuronal intermediate filament inclusion disease (NIFID) is a rare distinct variant. The inclusion bodies that are present in NIFID are cytoplasmic and made up of type IV intermediate filaments. NIFID has an early age of onset between 23 and 56. Symptoms can include behavioural, and personality changes, memory and cognitive impairments, language difficulties, motor weakness, and extrapyramidal symptoms. NIFID is one of the frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD)-FUS proteopathies. Imaging commonly shows atrophy in the frontotemporal region, and in part of the striatum in the basal ganglia. Post-mortem studies show a marked reduction in the caudate nucleus of the striatum; frontotemporal gyri are narrowed, with widened intervening sulci, and the lateral ventricles are enlarged.

===Basophilic inclusion body disease===
Another rare FTD variant, also a FTLD-FUS proteopathy, is basophilic inclusion body disease (BIBD).

==Other characteristics==
In later stages of FTD, the clinical phenotypes may overlap. People with FTD tend to struggle with binge eating and compulsive behaviors. Binge eating habits are often associated with changes in food preferences (cravings for more sweets, carbohydrates), eating inedible objects and snatching food from others. Recent findings from structural MRI research have indicated that eating changes in FTD are associated with atrophy (wasting) in the right ventral insula, striatum, and orbitofrontal cortex.

People with FTD show marked deficiencies in executive functioning and working memory. Most become unable to perform skills that require complex planning or sequencing. In addition to the characteristic cognitive dysfunction, a number of primitive reflexes known as frontal release signs are often able to be elicited. Usually the first of these frontal release signs to appear is the palmomental reflex which appears relatively early in the disease course whereas the palmar grasp reflex and rooting reflex appear late in the disease course.

In rare cases, FTD can occur in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a motor neuron disease. , the prognosis for people with ALS was worse when combined with FTD, shortening survival by about a year.

==Genetics==
A higher proportion of frontotemporal dementias seem to have a familial component than other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. More and more mutations and genetic variants are being identified all the time, needing constant updating of genetic influences.
* Tau-positive frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) is caused by mutations in the MAPT gene on chromosome 17 that encodes the tau protein. It has been determined that there is a direct relationship between the type of tau mutation and the neuropathology of gene mutations. The mutations at the splice junction of exon 10 of tau lead to the selective deposition of the repetitive tau in neurons and glia. The pathological phenotype associated with mutations elsewhere in tau is less predictable, with both typical neurofibrillary tangles (consisting of both 3-repeat and 4-repeat tau) and Pick bodies (consisting of 3-repeat tau) having been described. The presence of tau deposits within glia is also variable in families with mutations outside of exon 10. This disease is now informally designated FTDP-17T. FTD shows a linkage to the region of the tau locus on chromosome 17, but it is believed that there are two loci leading to FTD within megabases of each other on chromosome 17. The only other known autosomal dominant genetic cause of FTLD-tau is a hypomorphic mutation in VCP which is associated with a unique neuropathology called vacuolar tauopathy.
* FTD caused by FTLD-TDP43 has numerous genetic causes. Some cases are due to mutations in the GRN gene, also located on chromosome 17. Others are caused by hypomorphic VCP mutations, although these patients present with a complex picture of multisystem proteinopathy that can include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, inclusion body myopathy, Paget&#x27;s disease of bone, and FTD. The most recent addition to the list () was a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in intron 1 of C9ORF72. Only one or two cases have been reported describing TARDBP (the TDP-43 gene) mutations in a clinically pure FTD (FTD without ALS).
* Several other genes have been linked to this condition. These include CYLD, OPTN, SQSTM1 and TBK1. These genes have been implicated in the autophagy pathway.
* No genetic causes of FUS pathology in FTD have yet been reported.
* Major alleles of TMEM106B SNPs have been found to be associated with risk of FTLD.

==Pathology==

There are three main histological subtypes found at post-mortem: FTLD-tau, FTLD-TDP, and FTLD-FUS. In rare cases, patients with clinical FTD were found to have changes consistent with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease on autopsy. The most severe brain atrophy appears to be associated with behavioral variant FTD, and corticobasal degeneration.

With regard to the genetic defects that have been found, repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene is considered a major contribution to FTLD, although defects in the GRN and MAPT genes are also associated with it.

DNA damage and the defective repair of such damages have been etiologically linked to various neurodegenerative diseases including FTD.

==Diagnosis==
FTD is traditionally difficult to diagnose owing to the diverse nature of the associated symptoms. Signs and symptoms are classified into three groups based on the affected functions of the frontal and temporal lobes: These are behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, semantic dementia, and progressive nonfluent aphasia. An overlap between symptoms can occur as the disease progresses and spreads through the brain regions.

Structural MRI scans often reveal frontal lobe and/or anterior temporal lobe atrophy, but in early cases the scan may seem normal. Atrophy can be either bilateral or asymmetric. Registration of images at different points of time (e.g., one year apart) can show evidence of atrophy that otherwise at individual time points may be reported as normal. Many research groups have begun using techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy, functional imaging, and cortical thickness measurements in an attempt to offer an earlier diagnosis to the FTD patient. Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scans classically show frontal and/or anterior temporal hypometabolism, which helps differentiate the disease from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, as the PET scan in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease classically shows biparietal hypometabolism.

Meta-analyses based on imaging methods have shown that frontotemporal dementia mainly affects a frontomedial network discussed in the context of social cognition or &quot;theory of mind&quot;. This is entirely in keeping with the notion that on the basis of cognitive neuropsychological evidence, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is a major locus of dysfunction early on in the course of the behavioural variant of frontotemporal degeneration. The language subtypes of FTLD (semantic dementia and progressive nonfluent aphasia) can be regionally dissociated by imaging approaches &quot;in vivo&quot;.

The confusion between Alzheimer&#x27;s and FTD is justifiable due to the similarities between their initial symptoms. Patients do not have difficulty with movement and other motor tasks. As FTD symptoms appear, it is difficult to differentiate between a diagnosis of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and FTD. There are distinct differences in the behavioral and emotional symptoms of the two dementias, notably, the blunting of affect seen in FTD patients. In the early stages of FTD, anxiety and depression are common, which may result in an ambiguous diagnosis. However, over time, these ambiguities fade away as this dementia progresses and defining symptoms of apathy, unique to FTD, start to appear.

Recent studies over several years have developed new criteria for the diagnosis of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). The confirmatory diagnosis is made by brain biopsy, but other tests can be used to help, such as MRI, EEG, CT, and physical examination and history. , six distinct clinical features have been identified as symptoms of bvFTD.
# Disinhibition
# Apathy / Inertia
# Loss of Sympathy / Empathy
# Perseverative / Compulsive behaviors
# Hyperorality
# Dysexecutive neuropsychological profile

Of the six features, three must be present in a patient to diagnose one with possible bvFTD. Similar to standard FTD, the primary diagnosis stems from clinical trials that identify the associated symptoms, instead of imaging studies. The above criteria are used to distinguish bvFTD from disorders such as Alzheimer&#x27;s and other causes of dementia. In addition, the criteria allow for a diagnostic hierarchy distinguished possible, probable, and definite bvFTD based on the number of symptoms present.

A 2021 study, determined that using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of pathologic amyloid plaques, tangles, and neurodegeneration, collectively called ATN, can be useful in diagnosing FTD.

===Neuropsychological tests===
The progression of the degeneration caused by bvFTD may follow a predictable course. The degeneration begins in the orbitofrontal cortex and medial aspects such as ventromedial prefrontal cortex. In later stages, it gradually expands its area to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the temporal lobe. Thus, the detection of dysfunction of the orbitofrontal cortex and ventromedial cortex is important in the detection of early stage bvFTD. As stated above, a behavioural change may occur before the appearance of any atrophy in the brain in the course of the disease. Because of that, image scanning such as MRI can be insensitive to the early degeneration and it is difficult to detect early-stage bvFTD.

In neuropsychology, there is an increasing interest in using neuropsychological tests such as the Iowa gambling task or Faux Pas Recognition test as an alternative to imaging for the diagnosis of bvFTD. Both the Iowa gambling task and the Faux Pas test are known to be sensitive to dysfunction of the orbitofrontal cortex.

The Faux Pas Recognition test is intended to measure one&#x27;s ability to detect faux pas types of social blunders (accidentally making a statement or an action that offends others). It is suggested that people with orbitofrontal cortex dysfunction show a tendency to make social blunders due to a deficit in self-monitoring. Self-monitoring is the ability of individuals to evaluate their own behavior to make sure that their behavior is appropriate in particular situations. The impairment in self-monitoring leads to a lack of social emotion signals. The social emotions such as embarrassment are important in the way that they alert the individual to adapt social behavior in an appropriate manner to maintain relationships with others. Though patients with damage to the OFC retain intact knowledge of social norms, they fail to apply it to actual behavior, because they fail to generate social emotions that promote adaptive social behavior.

The other test, the Iowa gambling task, is a psychological test intended to simulate real-life decision making. The underlying concept of this test is the somatic marker hypothesis. This hypothesis argues that when people have to make complex uncertain decisions, they employ both cognitive and emotional processes to assess the values of the choices available to them. Each time a person makes a decision, both physiological signals and evoked emotion (somatic markers) are associated with their outcomes, and this accumulates as experience. People tend to choose the choice which might produce the outcome reinforced with positive stimuli; thus it biases decision-making towards certain behaviors while avoiding others. It is thought that somatic markers are processed in the orbitofrontal cortex.

The symptoms observed in bvFTD are caused by dysfunction of the orbitofrontal cortex; thus these two neuropsychological tests might be useful in detecting early-stage bvFTD. However, as self-monitoring and somatic marker processes are so complex, it likely involves other brain regions. Therefore, neuropsychological tests are sensitive to the dysfunction of orbitofrontal cortex, yet are not specific to it. The weakness of these tests is that they do not necessarily show dysfunction of the orbitofrontal cortex.

In order to solve this problem, some researchers have combined neuropsychological tests which detect the dysfunction of orbitofrontal cortex into one grouping, so that it increases its specificity to the degeneration of the frontal lobe, in order to detect early-stage bvFTD. They invented the &quot;Executive and Social Cognition Battery&quot; which comprises five neuropsychological tests:
* Faux Pas test
* Hotel task
* Iowa gambling task
* Mind in the Eyes
* Multiple Errands task

The result has shown that this combined test is more sensitive in detecting the deficits in early bvFTD.

==Management==
Currently, there is no cure for FTD. Treatments are available to manage the behavioral symptoms. Rehabilitiation services supporting every day functioning have demonstrated some positive results, in particular the Tailored Activity Programme, which is occupational therapy based. Positive Behaviour Support (PBS) has also been identified as potentially beneficial for people with bvFTD. Disinhibition and compulsive behaviors can be controlled by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Agitation can be controlled with small doses of atypical antipsychotics. Although Alzheimer&#x27;s and FTD share certain symptoms, they cannot be treated with the same pharmacological agents because the cholinergic systems are not affected in FTD.

Because FTD often occurs in relatively younger adults (i.e. in their 40s or 50s), it can severely affect families. Patients often still have children living in the home.

==Prognosis==
Symptoms of frontotemporal dementia progress at a rapid, steady rate. Patients with the disease can survive for 2–20 years. Eventually patients will need 24-hour care for daily function.

Cerebrospinal fluid leaks are a known cause of reversible frontotemporal dementia.

== History ==
Features of FTD were first described by the Czech psychiatrist Arnold Pick between 1892 and 1906. The name &quot;Pick&#x27;s disease&quot; was coined in 1922. This term is now reserved only for behavioral variant FTD which shows the presence of the characteristic Pick bodies and Pick cells, which were first described by Alois Alzheimer in 1911.

In 1989, Snowden suggested the term &quot;semantic dementia&quot; to describe the patient with predominant left temporal atrophy and aphasia that Pick described. The first research criteria for FTD, &quot;Clinical and neuropathological criteria for frontotemporal dementia. The Lund and Manchester Groups&quot;, was developed in 1994. The clinical diagnostic criteria were revised in the late 1990s, when the FTD spectrum was divided into a behavioral variant, a nonfluent aphasia variant, and a semantic dementia variant. The most recent revision of the clinical research criteria was by the International Behavioural Variant FTD Criteria Consortium in 2011.

<text>The blue star tattoo legend is an urban legend which states that a temporary lick-and-stick tattoo soaked in LSD and made in the form of a blue star, or of popular children&#x27;s cartoon characters, is being distributed to unknowing children in any given area.

==Propagation==

The legend commonly surfaces in American elementary and middle schools in the form of a flyer which is distributed to parents by concerned school officials. In the past it was often in the form of poor quality photocopy, clearly many generations old, but it has now also become popular on Internet mailing lists and websites.

The legend states that a temporary lick-and-stick tattoo soaked in LSD and made in the form of a blue star (the logo of the Dallas Cowboys is often mentioned), or of popular cartoon characters, such as Mickey Mouse and Bart Simpson, is being distributed to children in the area in order to get them &quot;addicted to LSD&quot; (see ).

Generally some attribution is given, typically to a well-regarded hospital or a vaguely specified &quot;advisor to the president&quot;, and instructions are given that parents should contact police if they come across the blue star tattoos.

==Origin==
The legend possibly originated from the fact that an LSD solution is sometimes sold on blotter paper with various designs, including cartoons.

No actual cases of LSD distribution to children in this manner have been documented. Although LSD does not penetrate through skin in sufficient quantities so as to induce a psychedelic experience, the concern was over children licking the tattoo paper before transferring to the skin.

==Other countries==
The legend has surfaced in many other places, including:
* Brazil
* Hungary
* Italy
* Peru
* Mexico
* Portugal
* Sweden
* UK
* Germany
* Canada

<doc id="668324" wikidata="Q5202642" url="?curid=668324" title="César Tovar">
<text>César Leonardo Tovar (July 3, 1940 – July 14, 1994), nicknamed &quot;Pepito&quot; and &quot;Mr. Versatility&quot;, was a Venezuelan professional baseball player and coach. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from to , most notably as the leadoff hitter for the Minnesota Twins teams that won two consecutive American League Western Division titles in 1969 and 1970. He later played for the Philadelphia Phillies, Texas Rangers, Oakland Athletics, and New York Yankees.

Although Tovar began his career as a second baseman, he was an extremely versatile utility player who could play any defensive position. In 1968, he became only the second player in MLB history to play all nine field positions during a single game, a feat first accomplished by Bert Campaneris, in 1965. Although he was a small player, listed at 5-feet-9 and 150 pounds, he was muscular and tough-bodied. Tovar played baseball with such speed and aggressiveness that manager Billy Martin considered him one of his favorite players. He was also a very good contact hitter, striking out only 7% of the time he appeared at the plate as a major league player. He led the American League (AL) in doubles (36) and in triples (13) in , and in hits (204) in .

Tovar also had a prolific career in the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League (VPBL), where he played 26 seasons – second only to the 30 seasons played by Vic Davalillo. He was inducted into the Venezuelan Sports Hall of Fame in 1996 and the Venezuelan Baseball Hall of Fame as part of its inaugural class in 2003. In 2022, Tovar was inducted into the Minnesota Twins Hall of Fame.

==Baseball playing career==

===Minor leagues===
Tovar was born and raised in Caracas, Venezuela, where as a child, he shined shoes to earn extra income for his family. At the age of 15, he befriended Gus Gil, another Venezuelan who went on to play in Major League Baseball. In January 1959, Cincinnati Reds General Manager, Gabe Paul, attempted to sign Gil to a contract however, Gil insisted that Paul should also have Tovar sign a contract. Paul relented in order to make Gil agree to sign.

Tovar began his professional baseball career when he was assigned to the Geneva Redlegs in the New York–Penn League. He hit .252 in 87 games as an infielder for Geneva in 1959. That winter, he returned to Venezuela to play for the Leones del Caracas, and won the league&#x27;s rookie of the year award.

In 1960, he played with the Missoula Timberjacks of the Pioneer League where he produced a promising .304 batting average along with 12 home runs and 68 runs batted in. After being selected to the league&#x27;s All-Star team, he was rewarded by getting to play two games at the top level of the Reds&#x27; minor league system with the Seattle Rainiers. Tovar was sent back to Geneva in 1961, where he batted .338 with 19 home runs and 78 runs batted in. He stole 88 bases in 100 attempts to lead the league while setting a new league record for stolen bases. In 1962, he played for the Rocky Mount Leafs of the Carolina League, and led the league in batting with a .329 batting average along with 10 home runs and 78 runs batted in.

The Reds had a promising second baseman in Pete Rose, who would win the 1963 National League Rookie of the Year Award, with future Gold Glover Cookie Rojas on the bench and second basemen Bobby Klaus and Gus Gil in their minor league system, there was little room left for Tovar to progress. The Reds sent him on loan to play for the Minnesota Twins minor league affiliate, the Dallas-Fort Worth Rangers. Tovar first met his future manager Billy Martin at spring training in 1963 where Martin was working as a minor-league instructor. Martin took a liking to Tovar&#x27;s aggressiveness on the base paths and took him under his wing. He also met future Hall of Fame member Tony Oliva in 1963 and the two became friends and later became roommates for seven years while playing for the Twins.

In 1964, Tovar returned to the Reds organization, where he played for the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League. He helped the Padres win the league championship by hitting for a .275 average with 7 home runs and 52 runs batted in, while playing as a third baseman, shortstop, second baseman, and as an outfielder.

===Minnesota Twins===
Before the start of the 1965 season, the Twins traded pitcher Gerry Arrigo to the Reds for Tovar. The Twins had originally sought to get Tommy Helms from the Reds, but they refused to trade him and the Twins settled for Tovar. At the age of 24, Tovar made his major league debut on April 12, 1965, becoming the ninth Venezuelan to play in Major League Baseball. At that time, the only other Venezuelan players in MLB were Luis Aparicio and Vic Davalillo. However, he would soon be sent back to the minor leagues with the Denver Bears, where he hit for a .328 average. Tovar received a September call-up and played in a total of 18 games in the season however, he would be left off the postseason roster and would watch the Twins&#x27; seven-game World Series loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers from home.

The peak of Tovar&#x27;s playing career came between 1966 and 1972. Starting in 1966, the Twins began to make ample use of Tovar&#x27;s ability to play a variety of defensive positions. Although he was known as a utility player, he averaged 153 games per year during his tenure with the Twins. As a leadoff hitter, he averaged 92 runs scored a year while batting ahead of power hitters Tony Oliva and Harmon Killebrew in the Twins&#x27; batting order.

When rookie second baseman Rod Carew arrived in 1967, the Twins began to use Tovar predominately as an outfielder and a third baseman. The 1967 season was memorable for the tight, four-way pennant race between the Twins, the Boston Red Sox, the Detroit Tigers, and the Chicago White Sox, with all four teams still in contention entering the final week of the season. The Twins were in first place with two games left in the season, but lost their final two games to the Red Sox and finished the season in second place.

Tovar played an integral role as a utility player during the Twins&#x27; 1967 pennant run, dividing his playing time between third base (70 games), center field (64), second baseman (36), left field (10), shortstop (9) and right field (5). He set an American League record of 164 games played (the Twins had two tie games in the 1967 season) and led the league with 726 plate appearances and 649 at-bats. He was also among the top 10 batters in runs, hits, doubles, triples, stolen bases, hit by pitch and sacrifice hits. At the end of the 1967 season, the Triple Crown winner, Carl Yastrzemski, received all but one vote for the American League Most Valuable Player Award; the lone dissenting ballot (cast by Minneapolis Star sports writer Max Nichols) was marked in favor of Tovar, who would finish 7th in the MVP voting.

On September 22, 1968, Tovar became the second player after Bert Campaneris (Kansas City Athletics, 1965) to play all nine fielding positions in a game. The two were later joined by Scott Sheldon (Texas Rangers, 2000), Shane Halter (Detroit Tigers, 2000), and Andrew Romine (Detroit Tigers, 2017) as the only five players in MLB history to have accomplished the feat. Tovar started the game on the mound against Oakland and pitched one scoreless inning in which he struck out Reggie Jackson. As fate would have it, the first batter he faced was Campaneris.
Billy Martin became the Twins manager in 1969 and he extolled Tovar&#x27;s leadership and motivation among his teammates. During a game against the Detroit Tigers on May 18, 1969, Tovar combined with Rod Carew to set a major league record for most steals by a club in one inning with five. In the third inning against the Detroit battery of Mickey Lolich and Bill Freehan, Tovar stole third base and home. Carew followed by stealing second base, third base and home. The two steals of home in the same inning also tied a record. He ended the year with a career-high 45 stolen bases.

In 1970, Tovar ended the season with a .300 batting average and posted career highs in doubles (36), triples (13), runs (120), on-base percentage (.356), slugging percentage (.442), and on-base plus slugging (.798). His 36 doubles and 13 triples led the American League and his 120 runs scored ranked second behind Carl Yastrzemski (125). His 195 hits ranked third in the league behind teammate Tony Oliva (204) and Alex Johnson (202) of the California Angels.

The Twins won the American League Western Division title in both 1969 and 1970, but each time were swept in three games by the Baltimore Orioles during the play-offs. Tovar hit for only a .077 batting average in the 1969 American League Championship Series, but improved with a .385 average and scored two runs in the 1970 American League Championship Series.

As he improved at the plate, Tovar also moved less around the diamond – playing primarily center field in 1970, left field in 1971, and right field in 1972. He improved his hitting through 1971, when he hit for a .311 batting average and led the league with a career-high 204 hits, the highest one-year total by a Venezuelan player in MLB until Magglio Ordóñez had 216 hits in .

In 1971, SPORT magazine polled major league players to identify the game&#x27;s most competitive player. Pete Rose won; the runners-up were Frank Robinson, Bob Gibson, and César Tovar. On September 19, 1972, Tovar hit a walk-off home run to hit for the cycle. Only five other players in major league baseball history have completed a cycle with a game-ending homer: Ken Boyer (1961), George Brett (1979), Dwight Evans (1984), Carlos González (2010) and Nolan Arenado (2017).

After a subpar season in 1972, the Twins traded Tovar to the Philadelphia Phillies for Ken Sanders, Ken Reynolds and Joe Lis on December 1. Tovar would then spend the 1973 season platooning with a young Mike Schmidt at third base.

When Billy Martin became the manager of the Texas Rangers in 1973, he requested that the team purchase Tovar&#x27;s contract from the Phillies, which they did on December 7, 1973. Tovar&#x27;s career experienced a brief resurgence as Martin&#x27;s leadoff hitter for the Rangers in 1974, hitting .292 with a .354 on-base percentage. After the Rangers released Martin in July 1975, they sold Tovar&#x27;s contract to the Oakland Athletics in August 1975.

The Athletics were in first place in the American League Western Division and went on to win the division title. Tovar appeared in two games of the 1975 American League Championship Series, getting one hit in two at-bats and scoring two runs. He was a pinch hitter and defensive replacement for the Athletics in 1976, before breaking his wrist while making a diving catch on May 31. He was activated in mid-August, only after a complaint from the Major League Baseball Players Association. The Athletics&#x27; temperamental owner, Charlie Finley, then released Tovar on August 25.

Less than one week after being released by the Athletics, Tovar was signed as a free agent by the New York Yankees on September 1, once again with the assistance of Billy Martin who was then the Yankees manager. His signing made him the first Venezuelan to play for the Yankees. He appeared in 13 games for them before playing in his final major league game on September 29, 1976, at the age of 35. He joined the club too late to be eligible for the postseason. The Yankees released him in December 1976.

==Career statistics==
In his 12-year major league career, Tovar played in 1,448 games with 1,546 hits in 5,569 at bats for a .278 batting average along with 46 home runs, 435 RBI, 834 runs, 253 doubles, 55 triples, 226 stolen bases and a .335 on-base percentage.

Along with former Reds center fielder Eddie Milner, Tovar is regarded as the major league&#x27;s all-time leader in breaking up no-hit attempts with five. On April 30, 1967, Tovar&#x27;s single was the only hit against the Washington Senators&#x27; Barry Moore. On May 15, 1969, he broke up the no-hit bid of Baltimore pitcher, Dave McNally. Later that same season on August 10, 1969, Mike Cuellar of the Baltimore Orioles extended his streak of consecutive batters retired to 35 before surrendering a ninth-inning single to Tovar, which also broke up Cuellar&#x27;s bid for a no-hitter. Tovar was responsible for spoiling two other no-hitters during his career: against the Washington&#x27;s Dick Bosman (August 13, 1970) and the Yankees&#x27; Jim &quot;Catfish&quot; Hunter (May 31, 1975). He had the opportunity to break up a sixth no-hitter, but recorded the last out in Vida Blue’s no-hitter on September 21, 1970.

==Later life==
After retiring from the major leagues, Tovar played in the Mexican League where he hit .345 in 121 games for the Pericos de Puebla. In 1978, he appeared in only 31 games for the Olmecas de Tabasco with a .336 batting average. In 1979, Tovar played in the short-lived Inter-American League for the Caracas Metropolitanos and hit .285 for manager Jim Busby.

Tovar also continued to play in the Venezuelan Winter League. He was a player-coach for the Águilas del Zulia team that won the 1984 league championship before going on to win the 1984 Caribbean Series. He retired as a player at the age of 45 after two final games in the winter of 1985–86. Over a 26-season career in the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League, Tovar appeared in 1,116 games posting a .286 batting average, along with 23 home runs and 399 runs batted in. His 1,224 career hits and 1,116 games played ranks fourth in league history. As of 2014, he ranked second in runs scored (635) and stolen bases (146), and third in doubles (191).

After his playing career, Tovar continued to serve with the Águilas del Zulia as a coach where his protégé was future MLB player, Carlos Quintana who called him his &quot;second father&quot;. He helped support children&#x27;s charities in Venezuela by collecting baseball uniforms and equipment. He also worked as a softball coach for the Venezuelan Horse Racing Authority, which sponsored recreation for its workers and their families. In August 1990, he managed the Venezuelan team to a 1–7 last place finish in the Baseball World Cup, which was held in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

Tovar died on July 14, 1994, of pancreatic cancer in Caracas at age 54. The level of pride and admiration with which the Venezuelan public held for Tovar&#x27;s playing career was such that the nation&#x27;s president, Rafael Caldera, attended his funeral. He was inducted into the Venezuelan Sports Hall of Fame in 1996 and the Venezuelan Baseball Hall of Fame in 2003 as part of its inaugural class. Tovar was posthumously inducted into the Minnesota Twins Hall of Fame in 2022.

<doc id="668326" wikidata="Q2912172" url="?curid=668326" title="Sole proprietorship">
<text>A sole proprietorship, also known as a sole tradership, individual entrepreneurship or proprietorship, is a type of enterprise owned and run by only one person and in which there is no legal distinction between the owner and the business entity. A sole trader does not necessarily work alone and may employ other people.

The sole trader receives all profits (subject to taxation specific to the business) and has unlimited responsibility for all losses and debts. Every asset of the business is owned by the proprietor, and all debts of the business are that of the proprietor; the business is not a separate legal entity. The arrangement is a &quot;sole&quot; proprietorship in contrast with a partnership, which has at least two owners.

Sole proprietors may use a trade name or business name other than their legal name. They may have to trademark their business name legally if it differs from their own legal name, with the process varying depending upon country of residence.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
Registration of a business name for a sole proprietor is generally uncomplicated, unless it involves the selection of a name that is fictitious, or assumed. In many countries, the business owner is required to register with the appropriate local authorities, who will determine that the name submitted is not duplicated by another business entity.

The owner may hire employees and enlist the services of independent consultants. Although an employee or consultant may be requested by the owner to complete a specific project, or participate in the company&#x27;s decision-making process, their contribution to the project or decision is considered a &quot;recommendation&quot; under the law. Under the legal doctrine &quot;respondeat superior&quot; (Latin: &quot;let the master answer&quot;), the legal liability for any business decision arising from such a contribution remains upon the owner and cannot be renounced or apportioned.

This is transposed by the unlimited liability attached to a sole proprietary business. The owner carries the financial responsibility for all debts and/or losses suffered by the business, to the extent of using personal or other assets to discharge any outstanding liabilities. Thus, the owner of a sole proprietorship may be forced to use his/her personal holdings, such as his/her car, to pay the debts. The owner is exclusively liable for all business activities conducted by the sole proprietorship and, accordingly, entitled to full control and all earnings associated with it.

==Rules for sole proprietorships in various countries==
=== Netherlands===

In the Netherlands, a sole trader can be categorized as a &quot;ZZPer&quot;, and must register with the Chamber of Commerce and get a VAT ID. Not all ZZPers are sole traders. A ZZPer (meaning Zelfstandige Zonder Personeel or self-employed without staff) is an entrepreneur who does not employ any staff to run their business. A business can be a sole proprietorship and also employ staff in which case the entrepreneur does not qualify as a ZZPer. 

===Ireland===
In Ireland, a sole trader who wishes to trade using a business name other than their true surname must register that name with the Companies Registration Office (CRO).

=== Malaysia ===
==== Registration of sole proprietorships ====
In Malaysia, there are three laws governing the registration and administration of sole proprietors:-
# West Malaysia and the Federal Territory of Labuan: Registration of Business Act 1956 (Act 197);
# Sarawak: Businesses, Professions and Trade Licensing Ordinance [Sarawak Chapter 33]; and Business Names Ordinance for the State of Sarawak [Sarawak Chapter 64] and
# Sabah: Trades Licensing Ordinance for the State of Sabah [Sabah Chapter 144].
In West Malaysia, the registration of sole proprietors come under the purview of the Companies Commission of Malaysia (&quot;Suruhanjaya Syarikat Malaysia&quot;, abbreviated as &quot;SSM&quot;). In Sabah and Sarawak (with the exception of Kuching), the registrations of businesses are done at the local authorities (e.g. municipal councils or district offices), while in Kuching, sole proprietors are registered with the Kuching Office of the Malaysian Inland Revenue Board.

Sole proprietors, which includes the self-employed, must register with the relevant authority within thirty days from the commencement of their business. Sole proprietors may register their business using one of two names: their legal name following the registrant&#x27;s identity card or a trade name. Registration of a business lasts for either one or two years, and must be renewed thirty days before its expiry.

In the event of termination of business, the proprietor has thirty days from the termination date to file the notice with the relevant authority. If the termination is caused by the death of the proprietor, the administrators of the estate have four months from the death date to file a notice of termination.

==== Goods and services tax (GST) ====
Sole proprietors must register with the Royal Malaysian Customs Department to charge and collect goods and services tax (GST) once their taxable turnover within a 12 month-period exceeds RM500,000.

==== Sole proprietors as employers ====
Similar to other Common Law jurisdiction, proprietors may enter into contracts of employment and/or apprenticeship with their employees. Sole proprietors, as employers are responsible to:
* Make contribution to their employees&#x27; Employees Provident Fund; and
* Pay contribution to their employees&#x27; Social Security.

==== Online businesses ====
In 2016, the SSM took legal action against 478 online businesses that failed to register their businesses, whether as sole proprietors, partnerships, or private limited companies. As at May 12, 2017, a total of 50,882 online businesses have registered with the SSM since 2015.

===New Zealand===
Sole traders in New Zealand must notify the Inland Revenue Department that they are trading and must register for Goods and Services Tax purposes if their income exceeds $60,000 per year. Sole traders may obtain a unique New Zealand Business Number (NZBN), which any business in New Zealand can use to identify the business in commercial relationships and dealings with the government.

===United Kingdom ===
A sole trader is the simplest type of business structure defined in UK law. It refers to an individual who owns their own business and retains all the profits from it. When starting up, sole traders must complete a straightforward registration with HM Revenue and Customs as self-employed for tax and National Insurance purposes. They are responsible for maintaining the business&#x27;s records and submitting an annual tax return for all income from self-employment and other work. If revenue is expected to be more than £85,000 a year, they must also register for Value Added Tax. A sole trader can employ staff, but is personally responsible for any losses the business takes.

==== Advantages ====
Becoming a sole trader is relatively simple compared to other business structures. It can rapidly enable a business to begin trading; the requirements for record-keeping are far more straightforward than other business structures. Sole traders make all operational decisions and are solely responsible for raising business finance. They can invest their own capital into the business, or may be able to access business loans and/or overdrafts. Unlike limited companies or partnerships, it is not necessary to share decision-making or the profits.

==== Disadvantages ====
Unlike many other business entities, the sole proprietorship lacks a clear distinction between personal and business income. The business owner is personally liable for income tax and National Insurance contributions due on the business profits in each tax year. They are also personally liable for any debts the business incurs. Business analysts may advise sole traders to form a limited company in order to access greater levels of financing, for example for expansion plans. This can limit their personal liability, and business lenders may be more inclined to co-operate with a limited company. It can also be the case that within certain industries, it is easier to secure work if presenting potential business partners with a limited company structure.

===United States===
In the United States, there are no formalities that must be followed to start a sole proprietorship or commence business as a sole proprietor. However, depending upon the business activity of the sole proprietorship, sole proprietors may require licenses and permits in order to conduct business.

According to the Small Business Administration (SBA), a sole proprietor and their business are considered as one and the same; therefore, the business is not subjected to separate taxation and regarded as the direct income of the owner. Income, losses and expenses may be listed on a Schedule C, which is then transferred to the personal tax return of the owner. It is the responsibility of the owner to ensure all due income taxes and self-employment contributions are paid.

A permitted exception to the sole proprietor (single owner) stipulation is made by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) permitting the spouse of a sole proprietor to work for the business. They are not classified as partners in the enterprise, or an independent contractor, enabling the business to retain its sole proprietorship status and not be required to submit a partnership income tax return. If an individual elects to incorporate as a Limited liability company but elects to be taxed as a Corporation, the IRS no longer recognizes the individual as a sole proprietorship.

====Foundation and development====
The setting-up process of a sole proprietorship to comply with local laws and regulations, is obtainable from the Small Business Development Center (SBDC), using their locator facility. A sole proprietor must be prepared to devote their time, utilizing business methods towards establishing a sound and appropriate foundation. Doing so may contribute to increased turnover, profits, minimize taxes, and avoid other potential adversities.

Sole owners are engaged in many varieties of industry and commerce, and a comprehensive list of the primary categories is found in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The selection of a business type, by a new sole proprietor, is in many instances, motivated by appropriate business experience in a particular field, especially those pertaining to enterprises involving the marketing and selling of defined products and services.

A crucial component of a sole proprietorship within a business plan is the provision of an inherent guideline, for actions that require implementing for a business to achieve growth. The business name and products are critical aspects in the founding of a sole proprietorship and once selected, should be protected. In the event of a determined brand name being legalized, information regarding trademark protection is available from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

====Finance====
For the sole proprietor, there are a variety of options in obtaining financial support for their business, including loan facilities available from the U.S. Small Business Administration. The loans are not originated by the SBA, but the administration does guarantee loans made by various independent lending institutions. The primary loan facility for small businesses offered by this agency is the 7(a) loan program, designed for general applications. Sole proprietors are able to finance legitimate operating expenses; for example, working capital, furniture, leasehold improvements and building renovations.

Many and varied private organizations and individuals seek opportunities to invest and fund a business that may not qualify for traditional financing from institutions, such as banks. For the sole proprietor seeking to take advantage of this facility, there are various factors that must be understood and adhered to regarding the loan application.

The Small Business Administration (SBA) advises that there are traditionally two forms of financing: debt and equity. For any small business owner seeking funding, they must consider the debt-to-equity ratio of their enterprise.

According to the SBA, there are various private organizations prepared to fund sole proprietor business operations that do not qualify for traditional financing from banks. These private investors can provide loans, credit lines, leasing facilities for equipment, or other forms of capital, to sole proprietorships that have exhausted alternative financial resources. It is also possible for these owners to obtain financing by way of business partners or others, with cash to invest. Financial partners are frequently &quot;silent&quot; and although they do not participate in any business related decisions, they generally receive a percentage of the profits, generated by the business.

To assist sole proprietors, there are business grants available from the Federal Government or private organizations, providing certain criteria are met. To qualify for Federal grants, small businesses must comply with determined business size and income standards. For consideration regarding various grant opportunities, sole proprietors may apply for a grant in their capacity as an individual. Local governments and state economic development agencies frequently make grants available, for businesses that stimulate their local economies.

For any sole proprietor applying for a loan, before starting the loan procedure, it is essential that their personal and business credit history is in order and up-to-date. A personal credit report should be obtained from a credit bureau; for example, Trans-Union, Equifax or Experian. This action should be initiated by a business owner well before starting the borrowing process. The Small Business Administration specifies that all credit reports received from any source should be carefully reviewed to ensure that all relevant personal information is correct. Other content in the report should also be examined particularly that related to the past credit obtained, from sources such as credit cards, mortgages, and student loans, as well as details pertaining to how the credit was repaid.

===Other countries ===
An exact equivalent of &quot;sole proprietorship&quot; is often absent, because the focus of the concept can change. An example is the Brazilian concept of &quot;sole business&quot; that was split into two main kinds of formal freelancer:
*sole professional: with higher level academic certificate and regulations for formal control of autonomous exercise (e.g. sole doctor&#x27;s office)
*sole entrepreneur: &quot;little entrepreneurs&quot;, such as a craftsman, autonomous taxi driver, and many others, that can be formal. An informal freelancer, through a simple process, can be formalized as &quot;sole microentrepreneur.&quot;

German and Austrian tax laws also differentiate between sole professionals and other sole proprietors.

<doc id="668330" wikidata="Q7176199" url="?curid=668330" title="Peter O. Knight Airport">
<text>Peter O. Knight Airport is an airport on Davis Islands, five minutes () from downtown Tampa, Florida. Built as a Works Progress Administration project, it was Tampa&#x27;s main airport from 1935 to 1945, and is still used by general aviation operators today because of its proximity to the central city. The airport was named for prominent attorney and businessman Peter O. Knight, namesake of Holland &amp; Knight.

The airport&#x27;s original administration building was torn down in the 1960s and replaced by the current building. Although seaplanes aren&#x27;t as popular anymore, the basin is still there at Davis Islands.

In June 2004, the local fixed-base operator (FBO) was sold by Tampa Flying Service and is now operated by Atlas Aviation.

The residents of Davis Island, where the airport is located, have complained about the noise and appearance of the facilities. The current plan is to extend the northeast end of the runway by and add to the south end of the runway. During a meeting on September 18, 2007, some residents voiced concerns about larger aircraft using the longer runway and any related increase in the volume of noise generated there.

Sound tests conducted by the Aviation Authority showed an increase of 3 dB or less over current usage at the closest residences, or an average of about 58 dB during run ups to take off. During the same tests, nearby lawn mowers, motorcycles, and automobiles frequently reached over 75 dB.

The extension of the northeast and southwest ends were completed in 2008 with no noticeable impact to the local area. The improvements to the runway have added to the safety of pilots utilizing this facility.

== Events ==
Islands Fest is held in April. It first started in 2006. It is a joint venture located at the Seaplane Basin Park and Peter O. Knight Airport. Peter O. Knight has on display a variety of aircraft, car club participants, and other local sponsors. The 2013 Islands Fest featured several organizations devoted to animal welfare including shelters, animal adoption organizations and a pet contest. This year the event was held on airport property along the seawall adjacent to the approach end of runway 22.

Tampa&#x27;s annual Gasparilla Pirate Fest- a Mardi Gras-like festival held in January, includes a Pirate Flotilla that sails up the channel into Tampa - the symbolic beginning of the Pirate&#x27;s reign over the city. The flotilla passes directly alongside the airport, making the airport an ideal viewing area for this event.

== Facilities and aircraft ==

Peter O. Knight Airport covers an area of at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has two asphalt paved runways: 4/22 measuring and 18/36 measuring . On January 13, 2011, the runway designations have been change due to a shift in the Earth&#x27;s magnetic headings. Runway 3/21 has become 4/22 and runway 17/35 has become 18/36. As of mid 2009 UNICOM Frequency is 122.725

For the 12-month period ending June 8, 1999, the airport had 66,000 aircraft operations, an average of 180 per day: 99% general aviation and 1% air taxi. At that time there were 102 aircraft based at this airport: 82% single-engine, 11% multi-engine, 2% jet and 5% helicopter.

The Hillsborough Aviation Authority has authorized an expenditure of over $1.8 million to add the required runway extension completed in 2009, and to build additional hangar space on the east side of the runway, adjacent to Seddon Channel. Plans are for 13 new hangar spaces completed the end of 2009, and an additional 8 in 2011.

April 2011 a major redevelopment of the ramp area has completed. The ramp area was extended and the taxiway Bravo pushed further away from the ramp area, providing a safer transition from east to west and west to east on the airfield.

==Incidents==
*On September 13, 1945, a Lockheed 18-50 Lodestar (NC33349) of National Airlines with 14 onboard, was landing on a flight from Miami while the runway was wet from rain; the plane could not decelerate, forcing the pilot to do a full left rudder and ground-loop. The plane went off the runway and the nose ended up in the water; there were no fatalities, but the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.
*On February 20, 1975, professional wrestler Buddy Colt, while attempting to land in bad weather, crashed into Hillsborough Bay short of the runway. Passenger Robert Shoenberger (&quot;Bobby Shane&quot;) was killed.,
*On June 12, 2006, a King Air 90 attempting to make an emergency landing at the airport skidded off a runway, through a retaining fence, and into the residence of a local business owner, causing complete destruction of the home. The pilot, Steve Huisman, was killed and the co-pilot, Sean Lauder, was hospitalized with serious injuries. Only one person was in the house at the time of impact, escaping without injury. The home was later demolished and rebuilt by ABC&#x27;s &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot;.
*On November 28, 2008, a local plastic surgeon and a 19-year-old man were injured when an Extra 300 single engine plane was making its final approach. It hit a sailboat mast and hit the seawall before the runway. The plane flipped onto a grassy area short of the runway.
*On July 20, 2012, a Boeing C-17 Globemaster III of the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s 305th Air Mobility Wing, from McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey mistakenly landed at Peter O. Knight Airport following an extended duration flight from Europe, to a location in Southwest Asia to embark military passengers, and then return to the United States. There were no injuries and no damage to either the airfield&#x27;s runway or to the aircraft. Although the C-17 is a large aircraft, it is designed for operation from airfields as short as 3,500 ft and consequently it took off a short time later with ease and made the short flight to MacDill Air Force Base, the aircraft&#x27;s original intended destination. With both airfields only a few miles apart and both of the main runways having the same magnetic heading, the Air Force blamed the mistaken landing on a combination of pilot error and fatigue.
*On March 18, 2016, a twin-engine Cessna 340A crashed, killing both the ATP rated pilot and private rated co-pilot. The 340 and a Cessna 172M took off on Runways 4 and 36 respectively. These two runways intersect at their northern section. The 172 had already begun its ascent as the 340 started its takeoff roll. The 340 attempted to avoid a collision and entered a steep left-hand bank and impacted the ground inverted. The aircraft was destroyed in the post-crash fire. The two aircraft did not collide and the 172 flew to its home airport of Tampa Executive.
*On December 29, 2022, a helicopter crashed into Hillsborough Bay on approach to the airport. All four occupants were rescued safely by Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Blaine Gabbert and his brothers, who transported them on jet skis to marine rescue boats.

==World War II==
During World War II, the airport was used as an auxiliary fighter landing field for several Army airfields including, Clearwater; Drew and MacDill fields supporting Third Air Force group and replacement training activities. The airport was also the original location of Coastal Patrol Base 13 of the Civil Air Patrol, before operations were moved to Sarasota.

<text>The terms &quot;star-crossed&quot; and &quot;star-crossed lovers&quot; refer to two people who are not able to be together for some reason. These terms also have other meanings, but originally mean that the pairing is being &quot;thwarted by a malign star&quot; or that the stars are working against the relationship. Astrological in origin, the phrase stems from the belief that the positions of the stars ruled over people&#x27;s fates, and is best known from the play &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; by the Elizabethan playwright William Shakespeare. Such pairings are often said to be doomed from the start.

==Definitions==
The phrase was coined in the prologue of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;:
It also refers to destiny and the inevitability of the two characters&#x27; paths crossing. It usually but not always refers to &quot;unlucky&quot; outcomes, since Romeo and Juliet&#x27;s affair ended tragically. Further, it connotes that the lovers entered into their union without sufficient forethought or preparation; that the lovers may not have had adequate knowledge of each other or that they were not thinking rationally.

(The original texts of the prologue, Q1 and Q2, use the spelling &quot;starre-crost&quot;, but the version &quot;star-cross&#x27;d&quot; is normally used in modern versions.)

==Classical examples==
Examples of famous star-crossed lovers vary in written work. Pyramus and Thisbe are usually regarded as the source for &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, and is featured in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, considered to be one of the greatest love stories in literary works, is a tale of all-encompassing and passionate, yet thwarted, love between the star-crossed Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, and how this unresolved passion eventually destroys them and many around them.

In Virgil&#x27;s Aeneid, the Trojan exile prince Aeneas and Dido, queen of Carthage, fall passionately in love – but the gods order Aeneas away to Italy and the spurned Dido commits suicide. Of course, Virgil&#x27;s readers in Rome in the first century BC would know in advance that this love was doomed, since Aeneas&#x27; and Dido&#x27;s progeny – respectively the Romans and the Carthagenians – would eventually become mortal enemies.

Lancelot, a trusted knight of King Arthur&#x27;s Round Table, and Guinevere, the queen of Camelot and wife of Arthur, were involved in a star-crossed affair. In some versions of the tale, she is instantly smitten, and when they consummate their adulterous passion, it is an act which paves the way for the fall of Camelot and Arthur&#x27;s death.

The legend of Tristan and Iseult (also known as Tristan and Isolde) is an influential romance and tragedy, retold in numerous sources with as many variations. The tragic story is of the adulterous love between the lovers. The narrative predates and most likely influenced the Arthurian romance of Lancelot and Guinevere, and has had a substantial impact on Western art and literature since it first appeared in the 12th century. While the details of the story differ from one author to another, the overall plot structure remains much the same.

Pedro of Portugal and Inês de Castro shared a true and tragic love in the Portuguese 14th century. The dramatic circumstances of their relationship, forbidden by Peter&#x27;s father, King Afonso IV, Inês&#x27; murder at the orders of Afonso, Peter&#x27;s bloody revenge on her killers and the legend of the coronation of her exhumed corpse by Peter, have turned their story into a frequent subject of art, music, and drama through the ages.

Hero and Leander is a Greek myth, relating the story of Hero (Greek: Ἡρώ), a priestess of Aphrodite who dwelt in a tower in Sestos, at the edge of the Hellespont, and Leander (Greek: Λέανδρος, Leandros), a young man from Abydos on the other side of the strait. Leander fell in love with Hero and would swim every night across the Hellespont to be with her. Hero would light a lamp at the top of her tower to guide his way.

Pelléas and Mélisande (French: Pelléas et Mélisande) is a Symbolist play by Maurice Maeterlinck about the forbidden, doomed love of the title characters. A classical myth, was a common subject for art during the Renaissance and Baroque eras.

Troilus and Cressida is a tragedy by Shakespeare, believed to have been written in 1602. The play (also described as one of Shakespeare&#x27;s problem plays) is not a conventional tragedy, since its protagonist (Troilus) does not die. The play ends instead on a very bleak note with the death of the noble Trojan Hector and destruction of the love between Troilus and Cressida.

Venus and Adonis is a classical myth during the Renaissance.

Heer Ranjha is one of the four popular tragic romances of the Punjab.
Popocatépetl and Iztaccíhuatl refers to a number of mythical and folkloric explanations of the origins of the volcanoes Popocatépetl (&quot;the Smoking Mountain&quot;) and Iztaccíhuatl (&quot;white woman&quot; in Nahuatl, sometimes called the Mujer Dormida &quot;sleeping woman&quot; in Spanish) which overlook the Valley of Mexico.

Layla and Majnun (by the Persian poet Nizami Ganjavi) is a classical Arabian love story. It is based on the real story of a young man called Qays ibn al-Mulawwah from the northern Arabian Peninsula, in the Umayyad era during the 7th century. There were two Arabic versions of the story at the time. In one version, he spent his youth together with Layla, tending their flocks. In the other version, upon seeing Layla he fell passionately in love with her. In both versions, however, he went mad when her father prevented him from marrying her; for that reason he came to be called Majnun Layla, which means &quot;Driven mad by Layla&quot;. To him were attributed a variety of incredibly passionate romantic Arabic poems, considered among the foremost examples of the Udhari school.

The Butterfly Lovers is a Chinese legend about the tragic romance between two lovers, Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai. The legend is sometimes regarded as the Chinese equivalent to Romeo and Juliet.

Other classic star-crossed lovers include Devdas and Paro (Parvati) in &quot;Devdas&quot;, Paris of Troy and Helen of Sparta in &quot;The Iliad&quot;, Oedipus and Jocasta in &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;, Mark Antony and Cleopatra during the time of the Roman Empire, Khosrow and Shirin during the time of Sassanid Persia, Heloise and Peter Abelard during the Middle Ages, and Emperor Jahangir and Anarkali, Cyrano and Roxane in &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;, Hagbard and Signy, and Maratha Peshwa (Prime Minister) Bajirao and Mastani during the peak of Maratha Empire.

==Modern examples==
Prime time television has had various star-crossed lovers labeled as notable and &quot;unforgettable&quot; love stories. IGN considers Buffy Summers and Angel from &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; to be one of the genre&#x27;s most tragic and notable star-crossed pairings. The Doctor bidding farewell to his companion Rose Tyler in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; has been named one of the greatest love scenes in science fiction. Cole Turner and Phoebe Halliwell from &quot;Charmed&quot;, Michael and Nikita from &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot;, Kara Thrace and Lee Adama from &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, Clark Kent and Lana Lang from &quot;Smallville&quot;, as well as Lucas Scott and Peyton Sawyer from &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; are other notable star-crossed couples from the genre. Commander Lexa and Clarke Griffin from the TV series &quot;The 100&quot; are also considered star-crossed lovers, as well as Nancy and Ace in &quot;Nancy Drew&quot;.

With film or within modern novels and books, such star-crossed couples as Jack Dawson and Rose DeWitt Bukater from &quot;Titanic&quot;, Landon Carter and Jamie Sullivan from &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot;, Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala and Kylo Ren and Rey from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; saga, Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist from &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;, and Jake and Neytiri from &quot;Avatar&quot; have been included.

In soap opera, modern examples of star-crossed lovers have included couples such as Cliff Warner and Nina Cortlandt, JR Chandler and Babe Carey and Bianca Montgomery and Maggie Stone from &quot;All My Children&quot;. In 2008, a web-based reality soap opera was created based on the concept of being star-crossed. In &quot;Starcrossed&quot;, Fox News astrologer Greg Tufaro takes a couple in crisis and separates them for one cycle of the moon. Each is then set up with individuals who are a better match astrologically. The show puts the question &quot;Is love written in the stars?&quot; to the test with the couple deciding on the 28th day of their separation whether they will stay together or remain apart.

In comics, the decision of Marvel Comics to kill off Gwen Stacy, the girlfriend of Spider-Man, made the two of them into star-crossed lovers - though that was not the original intention.

Video games too have featured star-crossed couples across different genres, particularly role-playing video games: Cloud Strife and Aerith Gainsborough from &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; have been cited as a well-known star-crossed love story. Tidus and Yuna from &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; have also been called star-crossed lovers. Zero and Iris from &quot;Mega Man X4&quot; are another notable example.

<text>Þingvellir (, anglicised as Thingvellir) was the site of the Alþing, the annual parliament of Iceland from the year 930 until the last session held at in 1798. Since 1881, the parliament has been located within Alþingishúsið in Reykjavík.

 is now a national park in the municipality of in southwestern Iceland, about 40 km (25 miles) northeast of Iceland&#x27;s capital, . is a site of historical, cultural, and geological significance, and is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Iceland. The park lies in a rift valley that marks the crest of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the boundary between the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates. To its south lies , the largest natural lake in Iceland.

 National Park ( ) was founded in 1930, marking the 1000th anniversary of the Althing. The park was later expanded to protect the diverse and natural phenomena in the surrounding area and was designated as a World Heritage Site in 2004.

==Toponymy==
The name is derived from the Old Norse (), from (“thing, assembly”) and (“field”), meaning &quot;assembly fields&quot;. Compare the English &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; (“Thingweald”) from Anglo-Saxon and . The site takes its name from (&quot;Althing&quot;), the national parliament of Iceland, which was founded at in 930 and held its sessions there until 1798. A &quot;thing&quot; was a form of governing assembly found in Germanic societies, and a tradition that endures to this day in one form or another across Northern Europe.

Although the name is plural, the older form is singular, and the modern singular form can still be heard.

The name is most commonly anglicised as &quot;Thingvellir&quot;, and might appear as &quot;Tingvellir&quot;, &quot;Thingvalla&quot; or &quot;Tingvalla&quot; in other languages. The spelling &quot;Pingvellir&quot; is also seen, although the letter “p” does not correspond to the letter “þ” (thorn), which is pronounced , like the &quot;th&quot; in &quot;thirst&quot;.

Dingwall and Tingwall in Scotland, Thingwall in England, Tynwald on the Isle of Man, Dinklage in Germany, and Tingvoll in Norway bear names of the same root and meaning.

==History==
 became a national park as a result of legislation passed in 1928 to protect the remains of the parliament site, thus creating the first national park in Iceland. The park was decreed &quot;a protected national shrine for all Icelanders, the perpetual property of the Icelandic nation under the preservation of parliament, never to be sold or mortgaged.&quot;

===Founding of Iceland&#x27;s parliament===

According to the Book of Settlements (), the settlement of Iceland began in 874, when the Norwegian chieftain became the first permanent Norwegian settler on the island. Over the next centuries, people of Norse and Celtic origin settled in Iceland. Early on, district assemblies were formed, but as the population grew, there was a need for a general assembly. The descendants of Ingólfur who dominated the region of southwest Iceland had become the most powerful family in the country, and other chieftains felt a need for a general assembly to limit their power.

 was allotted the role of rallying support and finding a suitable location for the assembly. At about the same time, the owner of (the contemporary name for the region) was found guilty of murder. His land was declared public, and then obligated to be used for assembly proceedings, and the building of temporary dwellings, and the forest to be used for kindling and the grazing of horses. The area was chosen for this reason and its accessibility to the most populous regions of the north, south, and west. The longest journey a (chieftain) had to travel was 17 days, from the easternmost part of the country where mountains and glacial rivers proved bothersome obstacles.

The foundation of the Icelandic parliament is said to be the founding of the nation of Iceland, and the first parliamentary proceedings in the summer of 930 laid the ground for a common cultural heritage and national identity. played a central role in the history of the country, and its history runs almost parallel with the history of the Icelandic Commonwealth.

===From commonwealth to foreign rule===

The (assembly) at was Iceland&#x27;s supreme legislative and judicial authority from its establishment in 930 until 1271. The or Law Rock was the focal point of the and a natural platform for holding speeches. The Lawspeaker, elected for three years at a time, presided over the assembly and recited the law of the land. Before the law was written down, he was expected to recite it from memory on the throughout three summers along with the complete assembly procedures every summer. Inauguration and dissolution of the assembly took place at the , where rulings made by the Law Council were announced, the calendar was confirmed, legal actions were brought and other announcements made which concerned the entire nation. Anyone attending the assembly was entitled to present his case on important issues from the Lögberg.

The Law Council served as both parliament and supreme court. Laws were passed and approved there, and rulings were made on points of law. The Law Council appointed members of the Fifth Court (a kind of appellate court) and the Lawspeaker and took part in the election of the bishop. Unlike the , the Law Council was a closed body in which only certain people enjoyed full rights: chieftains who held the office of , their and later also bishops. However, everyone at the assembly was entitled to watch and listen to the Law Council at work.

From the earliest times until the 15th century, the Law Council met at on the east bank of , but when the river changed its course around 1500, the council was moved to an islet in the river. In 1594, the Law Council was relocated to the foot of the ancient Law Rock, where it remained until the was finally transferred from it in 1798.

The was Iceland&#x27;s legislative and chief judicial authority for the duration of the Commonwealth, until 1271. Executive power was in the hands of the chieftains and parties to individual cases. This proved to be quite an adequate arrangement for as long as the balance of power remained, but flaws emerged when it was disrupted.

In the final decades of the Commonwealth, there were clashes between chieftain families, which resulted in Iceland coming under the Norwegian crown. Executive power was strengthened under this new order, while legislative and judicial authority at first remained in the hands of the , but was gradually transferred to the Norwegian and later the Danish rulers, until in 1662 when the King of Denmark became the absolute monarch of Iceland.
===Social centre===

 was the centre of Icelandic culture. Every year during the Commonwealth period, people would flock to from all over the country, sometimes numbering in the thousands.

They set up temporary dwellings ( , pl. ) with walls of turf and rock and temporary roofing of homespun cloth, and stayed in them for the two weeks of the assembly. There were no permanent buildings on apart from a farm and, later, two churches.

Although the duties of the assembly were the main reason for going there, ordinary people gathered at for a wide variety of reasons. Merchants, sword-sharpeners, and tanners would sell their goods and services, entertainers performed, and ale-makers brewed drinks for the assembly guests. News was told from distant parts; games and feasts were held. Young people met to make their plans, no less than leading national figures and experts in law. Itinerant farmhands looked for work and vagrants begged. was a meeting place for everyone in Iceland, laying the foundation for the language and literature that have been a prominent part of people&#x27;s lives right up to the present day.

=== Nationalist symbol ===
During the 19th century, emerged as a nationalist symbol. According to Icelandic political scientist , &quot;Thingvellir can be likened to a church or building which serves as a pilgrimage destination and as a site for the nation-state’s ritual ceremonies.&quot;

==Geology==

 is notable for its unusual tectonic and volcanic environment in a rift valley.

The continental drift between the North American and Eurasian Plates can be clearly seen in the cracks or faults which traverse the region, the largest one, , being a veritable canyon. This also causes the often measurable earthquakes in the area.

Some of the rifts are full of clear water. One, , was bridged for the occasion of the visit of King Frederik VIII of Denmark in 1907. On this occasion, visitors began to throw coins from the bridge into the fissure, a tradition based on European legends. The bottom has become littered with sparkling coins, and the rift is now better known as , or &quot;coin fissure&quot;.

 is situated on the northern shore of , the largest natural lake of Iceland. The river traverses the national park and forms a waterfall at the , called . On the lake&#x27;s northern shore, the Silfra fissure is a popular diving and snorkelling tour location. 

 was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site based on cultural criteria. It may also qualify on geological criteria in the future, as there has been ongoing discussion of a possible &quot;serial transboundary nomination&quot; for the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which would include other sites in the Atlantic such as Pico Island.

Together with the waterfall Gullfoss and the geysers of , is part of a group of the most famous sights of Iceland, the Golden Circle.

== Art ==
Because of its natural environment, Þingvellir has been a subject in the works of several Icelandic painters, including and . The National Gallery of Iceland owns more than 150 paintings by that have as their subject. grew popular among artists not only for its natural environment but also because it was close to the capital of Iceland, and thus relatively inexpensive to travel there.

==Tourism==

 National Park is popular with tourists and is one of the three key attractions within the famous Golden Circle. There is a visitor centre, where visitors can obtain an interpretation of the history and nature of . There is an information centre near the camping grounds. There are hiking trails, such as the Execution Trail and the nearby Leggjabrjótur . Scuba diving has also become popular at Silfra Lake as the continental drift between the tectonic plates made it wide enough for divers to enjoy unparalleled visibility.

<text>Richard Marvin Butkus (December 9, 1942 – October 5, 2023) was an American professional football linebacker, sports commentator, and actor. He played football for the Chicago Bears of the National Football League (NFL) from 1965 to 1973. He was invited to eight Pro Bowls in nine seasons, named a first-team All-Pro five times, and was twice recognized by his peers as the NFL&#x27;s Defensive Player of the Year. Butkus was renowned as a fierce tackler and for the relentless effort with which he played. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most intimidating linebackers in professional football history.

Butkus was born in Chicago and played his entire football career in his home state of Illinois, which began at Chicago Vocational High School. He was a linebacker and a center for the Illinois Fighting Illini. He was a twice consensus All-American, and he led the Illini to a Rose Bowl victory in 1963 and was deemed the most valuable player in the Big Ten Conference. Butkus was named college football&#x27;s Lineman of the Year in 1964. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1983.

Butkus was selected by the Bears as the third overall pick in the 1965 NFL draft. He soon established himself as a ball hawk with his penchant for forcing turnovers. During his NFL career, he intercepted 22 passes and recovered 27 fumbles (a record when he retired), and he was responsible for causing many more fumbles with his jarring tackles. His tackling ability earned him both admiration and trepidation from opposing players. In 2009, the NFL Network named Butkus the most feared tackler of all time.

Butkus is credited with having defined the middle linebacker position and is still viewed as the &quot;gold standard by which other middle linebackers are measured&quot;. In his honor, the Butkus Award recognizes American football&#x27;s most outstanding linebacker. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1979, and his No. 51 jersey was retired by the Bears. Following his playing career, Butkus worked in acting, sports commentary, and celebrity endorsement. He was active in philanthropy through the Butkus Foundation, which manages various charitable causes.

==Early life==
Butkus was born in Chicago, the youngest of eight children, and first to be born in a hospital. He was a very large baby, weighing at birth. His father John, a Lithuanian immigrant to Ellis Island who spoke broken English, was an electrician and worked for the Pullman-Standard railroad car manufacturing company. His mother, Emma, worked 50 hours a week at a laundry. Butkus grew up in the Roseland neighborhood on Chicago&#x27;s South Side. He was a fan of the Chicago Cardinals of the National Football League (NFL) and attended their games at Comiskey Park. His older brother Ron played football for three colleges and tried out for the Cardinals before quitting due to a bad knee. For four years starting at age 15, Butkus worked with his four brothers as a mover.

Butkus played high school football as a fullback, linebacker, punter, and placekicker for coach Bernie O&#x27;Brien at Chicago Vocational High School. He averaged five yards per carry as a fullback, but preferred playing linebacker, where he made 70 percent of his team&#x27;s tackles. In Butkus&#x27;s first year on the varsity team, Chicago Vocational surrendered only 55 points in eight games. In 1959, he was the first junior to be honored by the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; as Chicago&#x27;s high school player of the year. Injuries limited his play as a senior, but he was still heavily recruited by colleges to play football.

In the summer of 1960, Butkus was the starting catcher on a Chicago Park District baseball team known as the Sundodgers. An article in the Daily Calumet credits Butkus with driving in all of the Sundodgers&#x27; runs in a loss by hitting a home run to center field.

==College career==
Butkus chose to attend the University of Illinois, and played center and linebacker from 1962 through 1964 for the Illinois Fighting Illini football team. He initially wanted to play for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, however the team frowned upon married players at the time. In his first year on the varsity team, he was named to the 1962 All-Big Ten Conference football team as the third-team center by the Associated Press (AP) and second-team center by United Press International (UPI). In 1963, Illinois compiled an 8–1–1 record and defeated Washington in the 1964 Rose Bowl. Butkus was named the team&#x27;s most valuable player for the season, and was awarded the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; Silver Football as the Big Ten&#x27;s most valuable player. He was a unanimous choice as a center for the 1963 College Football All-America Team, earning first-team honors from all seven major selectors.

As a senior in 1964, Butkus was named the team&#x27;s co-captain along with safety George Donnelly. UPI deemed Butkus college football&#x27;s Lineman of the Year for 1964, and he was named the player of the year by the American Football Coaches Association and &quot;The Sporting News&quot;. For the second consecutive season he was deemed the Illini&#x27;s most valuable player. He was chosen for the 1964 All-America team by five of the six major selectors. In a cover story for &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; that season, sportswriter Dan Jenkins remarked, &quot;If every college football team had a linebacker like Dick Butkus of Illinois, all fullbacks soon would be three feet tall and sing soprano.&quot; Butkus also finished sixth in Heisman Trophy balloting in 1963 and third in 1964, rare results both for a lineman and a defensive player. According to statistics kept by the university, he completed his college career with 374 tackles: 97 in 1962, 145 in 1963, and 132 in 1964.

==Professional career==
Butkus was the third overall selection of the 1965 NFL draft, taken by the Chicago Bears, and also in the second round of the 1965 AFL draft by the Denver Broncos of the American Football League. After several days of recruiting by both the teams and leagues, his decision to sign with the Bears was viewed as a major victory for the NFL. Although the Bears offered him less money than the Broncos, playing for his hometown team and coach George Halas was more enticing. His rookie contract was worth $200,000. Along with fellow future Hall of Famer Gale Sayers (fourth overall), Butkus was one of three first-round picks for the Bears that NFL draft. The pick they used for Butkus had been acquired in a trade with the Pittsburgh Steelers.

===1965–1970===
Succeeding hall of famer Bill George at middle linebacker, Butkus made an immediate impact as a rookie in 1965. He established himself as a ball hawk by intercepting five passes and recovering six opponents&#x27; fumbles, and he was also credited unofficially with having forced six fumbles. Against the New York Giants on November 28, he intercepted a pass and recovered a fumble, and was named the NFL Defensive Player of the Week by the AP for the first of four times in his career.

He finished third in balloting for the AP&#x27;s rookie of the year award, behind Sayers and Ken Willard of the San Francisco 49ers, with AP sportswriter Jack Hand remarking that Butkus would have certainly won if there was a separate award for defenders. He was named a first-team All-Pro by the AP and was invited to his first of eight straight Pro Bowls.

In 1966, Butkus was named the second-team middle linebacker on the All-Pro teams of the AP, UPI, Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA), and &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, with each selector placing him behind Ray Nitschke of the Green Bay Packers. He reclaimed the first-team spot on the UPI and NEA teams in 1967, the AP team in 1968, and the &quot;Daily News&quot; team in 1969, all of which he occupied through the 1970 season.

Butkus scored the first points of his career in 1969, when he tackled Steelers&#x27; quarterback Dick Shiner in the end zone for a safety on November 9. He also recorded 25 tackles in the game, and for his efforts was recognized as the NFL Defensive Player of the Week by the AP. That 38–7 win for the Bears was their only one of the season; they finished with a 1–13 record, which was the worst in franchise history. Additionally, Butkus&#x27;s five-year contract had reached its end. A number of Bears players, including Butkus, expressed interest in being traded or cut by the team, but he signed a multi-year contract extension prior to the 1970 season to remain in Chicago. The contract raised his salary from $50,000 per year to around $80,000 to $100,000 per year.

Despite the ineptitude of the Bears as a team, Butkus developed a reputation around the league as one of its best players. In both 1969 and 1970, he was named the NFL Defensive Player of the Year by the NEA, which was voted on by NFL players. He appeared on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; in September 1970 with the caption, &quot;The Most Feared Man in the Game&quot;. A panel of NFL coaches that year named Butkus the player they would most prefer to start a team with if they were building one from the ground up.

===1971–1973===
Prior to the 1971 season, Butkus underwent preventive surgery on his right knee; he had torn ligaments in high school, but was able to continue playing due to strong muscles compensating for the injury. In the Bears&#x27; first ever game at Soldier Field on September 19 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Butkus turned in a great performance. With the Bears down 15–3 in the 4th, Butkus picked off quarterback Terry Bradshaw twice. Butkus did intercept a pass from Bradshaw a third time but was called back by a penalty against the Bears. In the final minutes with the Bears down 15–10, Butkus forced a fumble on running back Warren Bankston which was recovered by Bears defensive end Ed O&#x27;Bradovich on the Steelers&#x27; 12-yard line. The turnover led the Bears to score and win 17–15. In 1971, he recorded 117 tackles and four interceptions, leading the Bears in both statistics. On November 14, he scored a point; in the closing minutes of a game against the Washington Redskins, the score was tied at 15 and the Bears had lined up to kick an extra point. The snap was low and went past holder Bobby Douglass, who then raced back to retrieve the ball and looked to pass it. Butkus, who was playing as a blocking back, ran into the end zone and leapt to receive the pass for the winning score. Butkus later called the play his favorite of his career. Despite the statistical output, for the first time since 1966 Butkus was not named to a major All-Pro first-team, instead earning second-team honors from the NEA and Pro Football Writers Association.

Butkus sparked controversy in 1972 with the release of &quot;Stop-Action&quot;, a memoir describing the final week of the 1971 season. The Bears had lost their final five games in 1971, and Butkus used the memoir as an outlet for his frustrations and grievances. In particular, he harshly criticized the Detroit Lions organization, saying, &quot;I think they are a lot of jerks, from the owner, the general manager, the coach on down... If we were voting for a jerk team or organization they&#x27;d have my vote all the way.&quot; The Lions responded with a 38–24 win over the Bears in Week 3 of 1972. After the game Lions linebacker Mike Lucci, whom Butkus had labeled a &quot;crybaby&quot;, denied that the book had any bearing on the game&#x27;s outcome, but told reporters, &quot;Butkus should just keep his mouth shut and play football.&quot; Butkus, who was notoriously surly with reporters, also denied any connection and accused the media of sensationalism. Bears teammate Gale Sayers later said he did not like the book, feeling Butkus was above such name-calling. The season as a whole was another productive one for Butkus, who reclaimed the first-team middle linebacker spot on the major All-Pro teams and was invited to his final Pro Bowl.

Early in the first quarter against the Houston Oilers in 1973, Butkus pounced on a fumble in the end zone for the only touchdown of his career. Houston tight end Mack Alston accused Butkus of intimidating the officials, saying he &quot;grabbed the ball and started yelling &#x27;touchdown, touchdown, after which &quot;the officials looked at each other, shrugged their shoulders and called it a touchdown.&quot; His season was cut short after nine games by a lingering right knee injury, which he had been playing through for years, but was further aggravated after it gave out in Week 5 against the Atlanta Falcons. Prior to the 1974 season an orthopedic surgeon told him, &quot;I don&#x27;t know how a man in your shape can play football or why you would even want to.&quot; The injury ultimately forced him to retire in May 1974 at age 31.

==Lawsuit against Bears==
Butkus&#x27;s retirement came with four years remaining on a five-year contract with the Bears, which was to pay him $115,000 per year through 1977. It came with a no-cut, no-trade clause, and was payable even if surgery was needed. The contract also promised necessary medical and hospital care which, according to Butkus, the Bears neglected to provide him, causing irreparable damage to his knee. The Bears then told him he would not be paid if he could not play. Butkus filed suit against the Bears&#x27; team doctor in May 1974 asking for $600,000 in compensatory damages and $1 million in punitive damages. It was eventually settled out of court when the Bears agreed to pay Butkus the full value of his contract. The episode caused a rift between Butkus and Bears owner George Halas, and the two did not speak for the next five years.

==Profile and reputation==
Standing tall and weighing , Butkus was a large linebacker for the era in which he played football. This size was a common trait in his family, as all four of his brothers and his father each stood over six feet tall and weighed over 200 pounds. He was also diligent with his conditioning. In high school he would push a car up and down a street to strengthen his legs, and in college he developed a routine of running at trees and dodging them to emulate avoiding blockers. Despite his size, he also had the speed and agility to make tackles from sideline to sideline and cover tight ends and running backs on pass plays.

Hall of Famer Bill George, whom Butkus succeeded as the Bears&#x27; middle linebacker, said, &quot;The first time I saw Butkus, I started packing my gear. I knew my Bear days were numbered. There was no way that guy wasn&#x27;t going to be great.&quot;

Consistently cited as one of football&#x27;s meanest, toughest, and most feared players, Butkus was renowned for his intimidating profile and style of play. He was known to snarl at the opposition prior to plays. Quarterbacks would complain of Butkus biting them in pileups. Lions tight end Charlie Sanders recalled Butkus poking him in the eyes with his fingers through his face mask. He once intercepted a pass from Minnesota Vikings quarterback Fran Tarkenton near the goal line, and instead of taking the ball into the end zone for an easy touchdown, he took aim at Tarkenton to run him over. When asked by a reporter if he was as mean as the rumors suggested, Butkus replied, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t ever go out to hurt anybody deliberately. Unless it was, you know, important—like a league game or something.&quot;

He played angry, often &quot;manufacturing&quot; things to make him mad, because he felt it gave him a competitive edge. After the Bears lost to the Lions in their first matchup of 1969, Lions rookie running back Altie Taylor told reporters that Butkus was overrated. The next time the teams played that season, Butkus responded by chasing Taylor out of bounds after a play and causing him to jump into the stands at Wrigley Field.

Butkus became most noted for his tackling ability, and the ferocity with which he tackled opponents. He was named the most feared tackler of all time by the NFL Network in 2009. Once during practice, he hit a metal football sled so hard that he crumpled it and left a piece of it dangling off. &quot;Tackling wasn&#x27;t good enough,&quot; recalled former Bears defensive end Ed O&#x27;Bradovich. &quot;Just to hit people wasn&#x27;t good enough&quot;, he continued. &quot;He loved to crush people.&quot; Butkus is credited with 1,020 tackles in his NFL career.

Butkus recovered 27 fumbles in his career, an NFL record at the time of his retirement. One of his greatest strengths was his ability to rip the ball from a ball carrier&#x27;s hands. Although not an official statistic at the time, it has been noted that Butkus would certainly be one of the all-time leaders in forced fumbles.

In spite of all he could do on defense, Butkus could not turn the Bears into a winner: during his time there, the team only won 48 games, lost 74, and tied 4.

==Legacy and honors==
&quot;USA Today&quot; called Butkus the &quot;gold standard by which other middle linebackers are measured.&quot; Although not the creator of the middle linebacker position—which is credited to his predecessor Bill George—Butkus is recognized as having defined the role. He is also recognized for having set the benchmark for the success of Bears middle linebackers, which continued with Mike Singletary and Brian Urlacher. Hall of Fame running back Earl Campbell, known for his hard-hitting running style, cited Butkus as his hero growing up.

After his university years, Butkus continued to receive recognition for his college career. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1983. His No. 50 jersey is one of only two retired by the Illinois Fighting Illini football program, the other being the No. 77 of Red Grange, and he was an inaugural inductee into the Illinois Athletics Hall of Fame in 2016. Butkus was named to the Walter Camp Football Foundation&#x27;s All-Century Team in 1999, compiled to honor the best college players of the 20th century. In November 2017, Illinois announced it would erect a statue of Butkus on campus to overlook a future football performance center.

Butkus was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1979, his first year of eligibility. The Hall&#x27;s voters also named him to the NFL&#x27;s 1960s All-Decade Team and 1970s All-Decade Team, deeming him one of the best players of both decades. On October 31, 1994, the Bears retired Butkus&#x27;s No. 51 jersey along with Sayers&#x27;s No. 40 jersey during a ceremony at Soldier Field. In 2004, a sculpture featuring Butkus, Halas, and seven other former Bears greats was unveiled at Soldier Field.

Butkus has been repeatedly ranked among the top players in NFL history, being named the ninth-best player in NFL history by &quot;The Sporting News&quot; in 1999, the tenth-best by the NFL Network in its &quot;The Top 100: NFL&#x27;s Greatest Players&quot; series in 2010, and the eighth-best by the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; in 2014. In 2017, NFL senior analyst Gil Brandt ranked Butkus as the third greatest linebacker of all time, behind Derrick Thomas and Lawrence Taylor. He was also selected the 70th greatest athlete of the 20th century by ESPN. In 1994, he was named to the NFL 75th Anniversary All-Time Team, compiled to recognize the best players of the NFL&#x27;s first 75 years as adjudged by NFL officials and media personnel. In 2019, Butkus was named to the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team.

Butkus was ranked No. 1 on &quot;NFL Top 10: Most Feared Tacklers&quot; when the episode aired in 2008.

Honoring his contributions to Chicago sports, Butkus was inducted into the Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame in 2008. On August 24, 2013, he was inducted into the National Lithuanian American Hall of Fame. In 2018 Butkus was inducted as a laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln, the state&#x27;s highest honor, by the Governor of Illinois.

In 1985, the Downtown Athletic Club of Orlando, Florida, created the Butkus Award, which is given annually to the most outstanding linebacker at the high school, college, and professional levels as chosen by a nationwide panel of 51 coaches and sportswriters. Butkus sued the Downtown Athletic Club for rights to the award in 2007, which it relinquished after a yearlong court battle. It has since been presented by the Butkus Foundation.

As an homage, actor Sylvester Stallone named his pet Bullmastiff &quot;Butkus&quot; after the dog ate a security blanket. He decided to name him after &quot;possibly the fiercest football player in history&quot;. The dog later starred alongside Stallone in the &quot;Rocky&quot; film series.

==Film and television career==
After his career as a player, Butkus became a celebrity endorser, broadcaster, and actor. He appeared in films such as &quot;The Longest Yard&quot; (1974), &quot;Cry, Onion!&quot; (1975), &quot;Mother, Jugs &amp; Speed&quot; (1976), &quot;Gus&quot; (1976), &quot;Superdome&quot; (1978), &quot;Cracking Up&quot; (1983), &quot;Johnny Dangerously&quot; (1984), &quot;&quot; (1986), &quot;The Stepford Children&quot; (1987), &quot;Spontaneous Combustion&quot; (1990), &quot;Gremlins 2: The New Batch&quot; (1990), &quot;Necessary Roughness&quot; (1991), and &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot; (1999), and as a regular character on TV shows such as &quot;Blue Thunder&quot;, &quot;My Two Dads&quot;, &quot;MacGyver,&quot; and &quot;Hang Time&quot;, as well as in a guest roles on &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; and &quot;Matlock&quot;. He portrayed himself in both the critically acclaimed TV movie &quot;Brian&#x27;s Song&quot; (1971) and the 2002 comedy &quot;Teddy Bears&#x27; Picnic&quot;. Butkus portrayed Officer Alvin Dimsky in &quot;Cass Malloy&quot;, the 1982 CBS pilot for what later became the syndicated situation comedy &quot;She&#x27;s the Sheriff&quot;, and also made cameo appearances in episodes of several television shows.

Butkus endorsed Prestone, a brand of antifreeze, in a commercial during Super Bowl IV in 1970. The ad marked the first highly successful celebrity endorsement in Super Bowl advertising. Throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, Butkus appeared alongside fellow former NFL star (and later &quot;Blue Thunder&quot; co-star) Bubba Smith in a series of ads for Miller Lite, which were released to high acclaim. In 1985, he was a pitchman for Echo Tools, a producer of outdoor power equipment. In the 1990s, Butkus promoted the &quot;Qwik-Cook Grill&quot;, a grill using newspaper as its main fuel.

Butkus returned to the Bears as a color analyst on radio broadcasts in 1985, teaming with first-year play-by-play man Wayne Larrivee and former St. Louis Cardinals quarterback Jim Hart. He was hired as the replacement for Jimmy &quot;The Greek&quot; Snyder on CBS&#x27;s pregame show &quot;The NFL Today&quot; in 1988, serving as an analyst through 1989. He was named as head coach of the XFL&#x27;s Chicago Enforcers franchise, but was replaced by coach Ron Meyer for the league&#x27;s only season in 2001. Instead, Butkus served as the league&#x27;s director of competition and, during the second half of the season, a color commentator for the league&#x27;s regional telecasts.

In 2005, as part of the ESPN reality series &quot;Bound for Glory&quot;, Butkus served as head football coach of Montour High School in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. He coached the team to a 1–6 record before departing with two games remaining in the season, saying he had fulfilled his contract for the show.

==Personal and later life==
Butkus married his high school sweetheart, Helen Essenberg, in 1963 while they were students at the University of Illinois. After his retirement, Butkus moved to Florida, and later to Malibu, California. He was an avid fan and frequent media image for the Bears.

Butkus had three children: Ricky, Matt, and Nikki. Matt played college football for the USC Trojans as a defensive lineman, and joined his father in philanthropic activities. Butkus&#x27;s nephew Luke Butkus has been an assistant coach in the NFL for the Bears, Seattle Seahawks, and Jacksonville Jaguars, he also coached for the University of Illinois, his alma mater, and as of 2023 is the offensive line coach for the Green Bay Packers. Butkus&#x27;s grandson Ian Parish plays volleyball for the UCLA Bruins.

Injuries sustained during Butkus&#x27;s playing career compounded with time. He had his knee replaced with a metal unit. An osteotomy left him with one leg 1.5 inches shorter than the other, which affected his hips, back, and neck. Around 2002, nerve damage in his spine caused him to develop foot drop. He lost strength in his hands, needing both to lift a coffee cup. Still, Butkus maintained that football had a largely positive impact on his life, and that its benefits should not be overlooked.

In August 2001, Butkus underwent quintuple bypass surgery to remove blockages in his arteries. After the surgery, he co-authored a book titled &quot;The OC Cure For Heart Disease&quot; with Lawrence J. Santora, the doctor who performed the procedure.

Butkus died in his sleep at his home in Malibu, California, on October 5, 2023, at the age of 80. The cause of death was a stroke, with atrial fibrillation, atherosclerosis, and hypercholesterolemia listed as underlying causes. His death came hours before the Bears were scheduled to play a Thursday Night Football game against the Washington Commanders. The Commanders held a moment of silence prior to the game.

==Philanthropy==
Through The Butkus Foundation, Butkus has supported many charitable causes. The foundation was formed to manage the receipt and disbursement of funds for his charitable causes. These include:
* The Butkus Award, instituted in 1985, is one of the elite individual honors in football. The Butkus Foundation takes stewardship of the award recognizing athletic achievement and service to the community while honoring the nation&#x27;s best high school, college, and professional linebackers. An independent selection committee is composed of 51 people, including professional, college, and high school scouts, and sports journalists.
* The Dick Butkus Center for Cardiovascular Wellness is a nonprofit organization in Orange County, California, with a cardiac screening program that uses specialized testing to help identify those at risk of heart disease and sudden cardiac death.
* The I Play Clean Campaign addresses the issue of steroids among high school athletes. The campaign educates and encourages high school athletes to train and eat well, without resorting to illegal steroids and performance-enhancing products.

<text>Coahuila y Tejas, officially the Estado Libre y Soberano de Coahuila y Tejas (), was one of the constituent states of the newly established United Mexican States under its 1824 Constitution.

It had two capitals: first Saltillo (1822–1825) for petition of Miguel Ramos Arizpe, that changing the capital for dispute of political groups, but Monclova recovered primacy because it was the colonial capital since 1689; this action provoked a struggle between the residents of Saltillo and Monclova in 1838–1840, but the political actions of Santa Anna convinced the monclovitas to accept the final change of political powers to Saltillo. In the case of Tejas its territory was organized for administrative purposes, with the state being divided into three districts: Béxar, comprising the area covered by Texas; Monclova, comprising northern Coahuila; and Río Grande Saltillo, comprising southern Coahuila.

The state remained in existence until the adoption of the 1835 &quot;Constitutional Bases&quot;, whereby the federal republic was converted into a unitary one, and the nation&#x27;s states (&quot;estados&quot;) were turned into departments (&quot;departamentos&quot;). The State of Coahuila and Texas was split in two and became the Department of Coahuila and the Department of Texas.

Both Coahuila and Texas seceded from Mexico because Antonio López de Santa Anna attempted to collect taxes, end slavery, and centralize the government, and groups of rebels, led primarily by immigrants and slave-owners, were unwilling to obey the laws of the rest of Mexico. Texas eventually became the independent Republic of Texas, which in 1845 became a state of the United States of America. Coahuila joined with Nuevo León and Tamaulipas, to form the short-lived Republic of the Rio Grande.

==History==

===Formation===

In 1821, the Mexican War of Independence severed the control that Spain had exercised on its North American territories, and the new country of Mexico was formed from much of the lands that had comprised New Spain. In the early days of the country, there was much disagreement over whether Mexico should be a federal republic or a constitutional monarchy. In 1824, a new constitution restructured the country as a federal republic with nineteen states and four territories. One of the new states was Coahuila y Tejas, which combined the sparsely populated Spanish provinces of Texas and Coahuila. The poorest state in the Mexican federation, Coahuila y Tejas covered the boundaries of Spanish Texas but did not include the area around El Paso, which belonged to the state of Chihuahua and the area of Laredo, which became part of Tamaulipas.

Erasmo Seguin, Texas&#x27;s representative to Congress during the constitutional deliberations, originally advocated for Texas to become a federal territory. He knew that Texas&#x27;s small population and insufficient resources made the region ill-prepared to be an independent state, and that the federal government had an obligation to assist territories. Because Coahuila was more populous than Texas, he feared that in a combined state Coahuila would wield greater power in decision making. The representative from Coahuila, Miguel Ramos Arizpe, was likewise concerned that his region was ill-equipped to become an independent state. Ramos Arizpe was unwilling to join with other nearby states, as Coahuila compared unfavorably to those states in either population or economy and would thus be a weaker partner. To convince the Texans to join forces with Coahuila, Ramos Arizpe wrote to the &quot;ayuntamiento&quot; in Bexar to warn the political leaders that a territory would lose its ownership of public lands to the federal government. State governments retained ownership of public land. This was enough to persuade the Texans to drop their opposition to the merger.

===Immigration and slavery===
The federal government had little money to spare for the military, so settlers were empowered to create their own militias to help control hostile native tribes. The border region of Texas faced frequent raids by Apache and Comanche tribes. In the hopes that an influx of settlers could control the raids, the government liberalized its immigration policies, and settlers from the United States were permitted to move to Mexico.

States were responsible for implementing the General Colonization Law. Officials in Saltillo, the capital of Coahuila y Tejas, were soon besieged by foreign land speculators who wanted to claim land in Texas. The state passed its own colonization law in 1825. Approximately 3,420 land grant applications were submitted by immigrants and naturalized citizens, many of them Anglo-Americans. Only one of the twenty-four &quot;empresarios&quot;, Martín De León settled citizens from within Mexico; the others came primarily from the United States.

From the time Mexico became independent from Spain, there was public support for abolishing slavery. Fears of an economic crisis if all of the slaves were simultaneously freed led to a gradual emancipation policy. In 1823, Mexico forbade the sale or purchase of slaves, and required that the children of slaves be freed when they reached fourteen. Any slave introduced into Mexico by purchase or trade would also be freed. Many of the colonists in Texas, however, had already owned slaves and brought them to the new territory when they immigrated from the United States.

In 1827, the legislature of Coahuila y Tejas banned the admission of additional slaves into the state and granted freedom at birth to all children born to a slave. The new laws also stated that any slave brought into Texas should be freed within six months. Two years later, slavery was officially prohibited in Mexico. American settlers in Texas began to discuss revolt. The governor of Coahuila y Tejas, Jose Maria Viesca, wrote to the president to explain the importance of slavery to the east Texas economy, and the importance of the Texas economy to the development of the state. Texas was temporarily exempted from the slavery prohibition rule. By 1830, the state was ordered to comply in full with the emancipation law. Many colonists converted their slaves to indentured servants with 99-year terms, a practice which the state also banned in 1832.

===Tensions===
As the number of Americans living in Texas blossomed, Mexican authorities became apprehensive that the United States might wish to annex the area, possibly using force. On April 6, 1830, the Mexican government passed a series of laws restricting immigration from the United States into Texas. The laws also cancelled all unfilled &quot;empresario&quot; contracts and called for the first enforcement of customs duties. Implementation of the new laws angered colonists in Texas, and in June 1832 a group of armed settlers marched on the military base at Anahuac, and deposed the commander, Juan Davis Bradburn. A second group forced the surrender of another Mexican military commander at the Battle of Velasco. The small rebellion coincided with a revolt led by General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna against the centralist policies of Mexican president Anastasio Bustamante. Texans aligned themselves with Santa Anna&#x27;s federalist policies.

Settlers in Texas continued to press for changes in Mexican law. In 1833, they requested separate statehood, going so far as to draft a proposed state constitution.

In March 1833, the capital of the state was transferred from Saltillo to Monclova, which was closer to Tejas. Shortly thereafter, civil war erupted as the federal government moved away from federalism and towards a more centralized government. As fighting erupted, residents in Saltillo declared that Monclova had been illegally made the state capital and selected a new governor. Texans in Saltillo recommended establishing a provisional government in Bexar during the unrest to strengthen the autonomy of Texas. Juan Seguin, political chief of Bexar, called for a town meeting to create a government but was forced to postpone it when Mexican troops advanced in the direction of Texas.

===Disestablishment===
In 1835, President Santa Anna revoked the Constitution of 1824 and began consolidating his power. In various parts of the country federalists revolted, and in May 1835 Santa Anna brutally crushed a revolt in Zacatecas. The federalists, including Agustín Viesca, the governor of Coahuila y Tejas, were afraid that Santa Anna would march against Coahuila after subduing the rebels in Zacatecas, so they disbanded the state legislature on May 21, 1835, and authorized the governor to set up an office in a different part of the state. Viesca was arrested as he traveled to San Antonio. When Viesca escaped and reached Texas, no one recognized him as governor. In October 1835, Santa Anna abolished all state governments, replacing them with administrative divisions from Mexico City. Settlers in Texas revolted the same month, and, at the conclusion of the Texas Revolution in April 1836, Texas had become self-established as the independent Republic of Texas.

==Government==
Coahuila y Tejas was divided into several departments, each of which was governed by a political chief. Departments were further subdivided into municipalities, which were governed by &quot;alcaldes&quot;, similar to a modern-day mayor. Each municipality also had an elected &quot;ayuntamiento&quot;, similar to a city council. Originally, all of Texas was included in the Department of Béxar, while Coahuila comprised several departments. After many protests from residents of Texas, in early 1834 the region was divided into three departments, Béxar, Brazos, and Nacogdoches. At the same time, Texas was granted three representatives to the state legislature from the original two.

Laws were set by a state legislature. Ten of the 12 members were elected from Coahuila, with two coming from Texas. Legislators met at the state capital, originally Saltillo, Coahuila, later Monclova, Coahuila. The choice of capital city was controversial; Saltillo was located in the extreme south of the state, more than 300 leagues from the northernmost part of Texas.

===Defense===
The federal government recognized that border states required a different military model than other states. In 1826, Coahuila y Tejas and the nearby states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo León were placed under a single military commandant general, who was stationed near Laredo. According to the regulations, each of the garrisons in Texas (at the Alamo Mission in Bexar and at Presidio La Bahia in Goliad) should have 107 soldiers, not including officers. By 1832 there were a combined 70 soldiers with guns (with an additional 70 who had no weapons). The federal government occasionally established other garrisons within Texas, but when the immediate threat was considered to be gone the garrisons were usually disbanded. The bulk of the rest of the army remained in Mexico City, in large part so its leaders could curry political favor.

The government had little money, and troops were often unpaid, with ammunition, guns, and food in short supply. In many cases townspeople were forced to provide food and other supplies to the soldiers. Few men volunteered for military service in the frontier, so many garrisons were composed of convicts or others forcibly recruited.

In 1828, Coahuila y Tejas passed legislation authorizing an official state militia. Texas had at least three militia units – at Bexar, Goliad, and in Stephen F. Austin&#x27;s colony along the Brazos River.

==Demographics==
Despite the influx of settlers from the United States after the colonization laws were passed, the majority of settlers within Coahuila y Tejas were either Mexican citizens or Tejanos. Within Texas, however, by 1830 approximately 80% of the population was from the United States or Europe.

In the frontier areas of the state, similar to the rest of the Mexican frontier, there was more ethnic intermarriage than in the interior regions. Although both the federal and state constitutions established the Catholic Church as the official religion, the frontier areas often disobeyed the rule.

==Economy==
For the most part, only enough food was grown for use in the area; little was exported. This was partially due to labor shortages and partly due to raids from native tribes. Wild game was abundant, and many families survived by hunting, keeping a few head of livestock, and subsistence farming.

Within Texas, the economy depended heavily on the cultivation of cotton. In 1834, Texas exported over 7,000 bales of cotton. Ranching was also lucrative, and Texas exported over 5,000 head of cattle in 1834. Lumber was exported in small quantities, primarily to Matamoros. In the mid-1830s, Texas imported approximately $630,000 worth of goods. Exports amounted to only about $500,000. The trade deficit resulted in a lack of currency in Texas; in a report to his superiors Juan Almonte estimated that only about 10% of transactions within Texas were conducted with specie.

Much of the trade was run by recent immigrants; few &quot;Tejanos&quot; were involved in exporting or industry. The newcomers may have had increased access to capital markets and to transportation, and may have had closer ties with, or at least a better understanding of, foreign markets.

Many inhabitants of the Mexican frontier chafed at rules that limited trade with the United States. As these areas, including Texas, were far from federal – and often state – control, smuggling was rampant. Coahuila did not have a coastline, and thus could not import goods from other countries. From 1823 through 1830, Texas settlers had an exemption on tariffs for some goods. Tariffs could not be collected on other goods because there was no customs house to collect the duties. A customs house was established in Anahuac in 1830, but the soldiers were expelled by settlers in 1832. A similar incident occurred in 1835, again resulting in the closure of the customs house. Texas continued to serve as a smuggling haven, with some of the goods being sent into the Mexican interior and into the territory of New Mexico.

<text>Finn and Hengest is a study by J. R. R. Tolkien, edited by Alan Bliss and published posthumously in book form in 1982.

Finn and Hengest are two Anglo-Saxon heroes appearing in the Old English epic poem &quot;Beowulf&quot; and in the fragment of &quot;The Fight at Finnsburg&quot;. Hengest has sometimes been identified with the Jutish king of Kent. He and his brother Horsa (the names meaning &quot;stallion&quot; and &quot;horse&quot;) were the legendary leaders of the first Anglo-Saxon immigrants to Britain as mercenaries in the 5th century.

==Synopsis==

Hnæf, son of Hoc Half-Dane, is the lord of a Danish people who have conquered part of Jutland (probably the northern part of the Cimbrian Peninsula) and exiled its former Jutish rulers. Finn, king of Frys-Land (modern-day Friesland in the Netherlands) has allowed dispossessed Jutes to settle in his lands and enter his service. Finn marries Hnæf&#x27;s older sister Hildeburh, and sends their son (whose name was probably Friðuwulf) to be fostered in Hnæf&#x27;s household.

Around the year AD 450, Hnæf sails to Frys-Land in the autumn, His purpose is to return Finn&#x27;s now-grown son and spend the winter in Finn&#x27;s citadel, celebrating Yule. Hnæf brings a retinue of some sixty thanes. Chief among these thanes is a Jute named Hengest, leader of a band of Jutes who have taken service under Hnæf. Unfortunately, and foreseen by no one, when they arrive at Finn&#x27;s stronghold they find that many of Finn&#x27;s thanes are also Jutes, particularly one Garulf, who seems to be the rightful heir to the kingdom conquered by Hnæf&#x27;s people; and these Frisian Jutes are at blood feud with Hengest and his band, because Hengest supports the conquering Danes, if for no other reason. This would explain why Hildeburh &quot;had no cause to praise the fealty of the Jutes,&quot; since that fealty led to the re-awakening of the feud, which killed her brother, husband, and son.

Finn (who seems guiltless in Tolkien&#x27;s interpretation) tries to prevent trouble by separating the parties, and allowing Hnæf and his thanes to occupy the royal hall, while he removes his own thanes to a different building. However, the Frisian Jutes make a pre-dawn attack, hoping to take Hengest and his band by surprise. But the Danes have been expecting trouble, and a watchman sees the light of their approaching torches. He asks rhetorically, &quot;What is this light? Is it the dawn in the East, or is it the flight of a dragon, or are the gables burning?&quot; Hnæf answers, &quot;Neither is this the dawn in the East, nor is it the flight of a dragon, nor are the gables of this hall burning,&quot; it is an attack.
Prepared, the Danes and Hengest&#x27;s Jutes barricade the two doors of the hall against attack. Garulf is warned by one Guðhere not to risk his &quot;precious life&quot; in the assault, but he attacks and is the first to fall. Finn&#x27;s Frisian thanes, who have ties of marriage and friendship to Finn&#x27;s Jutish thanes, join in the fight against the Danes. The Danes hold the hall for five days without losing a man. On the morning of the fifth day the Frisians force their way into the hall, and in the battle, both Hnæf and Friðiwulf are killed. (It is not clear which side Friðiwulf was fighting on, but Tolkien thinks it likely he was staying in the hall with Hnæf, his foster-father and uncle; this would explain why &quot;Beowulf&quot; emphasises that Friðiwulf was laid on the funeral pyre at Hnæf&#x27;s side.) The surviving Danes, and those Jutes allied with Hengest, drive the Frisians and Jutes out of the hall and re-barricade the door.

At this point Finn (who may not have joined in the fight personally) intervenes and offers to make a bargain with the survivors. As Tolkien points out, the Danes now had several advantages:
#Finn had lost so many men that he could not force his way into the hall again.
#The Danes were occupying his royal hall, and he was unwilling to burn it to get them out.
#Finn must have felt both guilty and ashamed that his feuding thanes had killed Hnæf, who was his brother-in-law and guest.

Inside the hall, the survivors gather in two groups: Danes, led by a chief thane who is described as &quot;Hunlafing&quot; (&quot;the son of Hunlaf&quot;) and Jutes, led by Hengest. The Jutes are Hengest&#x27;s own band, and owed loyalty to Hnæf only because Hengest followed him. Finn at first tries to make peace with the Danes only, but the Danes loyally insist that any peace agreement must include Hengest and his men. Finn agrees, and swears an oath of peace: the Danes and Hengest&#x27;s men will lay down their arms, and since they cannot leave Frys-Land until the winter ends, they will sit at Finn&#x27;s table and technically accept him as their protector (since he was now their only possible source of food and maintenance, and they had intended to be his guests throughout the winter anyway.) Finn gives the Danes a separate hall to dwell in for the winter, specifying that they shall share it with the sons of the Jutes (meaning Hengest and his band.) He also swears that any one of his own thanes who tries to renew the feud (by taunting the Danes that they now follow the slayer of their lord) will be punished, possibly with death, by Finn himself. The bodies of Hnæf and Friðiwulf are honourably burned.

Over the winter, the Danes and their Jutish allies brood over the fall of Hnæf. Hengest is faced with a conflict of duty: whether to honour the peace-treaty with Finn, or to honour his duty to avenge his fallen lord. Finally the son of Hunlaf takes a sword &quot;Hildeleoma&quot; (&quot;Battleflame&quot;) which was probably Hnæf&#x27;s sword, and lays it in Hengest&#x27;s lap. Hengest &quot;does not refuse the world&#x27;s counsel&quot; (that is, he goes along with what everyone agrees is right) and decides that his loyalty to Hnæf must outweigh his obligation to Finn. (In any case, Tolkien points out that we do not see Hengest swearing any oath to Finn; we only see Finn swearing oaths to Hengest and the Danes.) When the spring comes, the Danes sail home and tell the story of the downfall of Hnæf. They return to Finn&#x27;s stronghold in force. Hengest, having remained in Frys-Land under the guise of upholding the terms of the peace-treaty, opens the gates to the invaders and the Danes sack Finn&#x27;s stronghold, kill Finn and all his men, loot and burn the city and return home, taking Hildeburh with them.

== Analysis ==

The book is based on an edited series of lectures Tolkien made before and after World War II. In his lectures, Tolkien argued that the Hengest of &quot;The Fight at Finnsburg&quot; and &quot;Beowulf&quot; was a historical rather than a legendary figure, and that these works record episodes from an orally composed and transmitted history of the Hengest named in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;. This view has gained acceptance from some medieval historians and Anglo-Saxon scholars, both since Tolkien&#x27;s initial lectures and since the publication of this posthumous collection.

Tolkien&#x27;s lectures describe what he called the &quot;Jutes-on-both-sides theory&quot;, which was his explanation for the puzzling occurrence of the word &quot;ēotenas&quot; in the episode in &quot;Beowulf&quot;. Tolkien read the word as Jutes, and theorised that the fight was a purely Jutish feud, and Finn and Hnæf were simply caught up by circumstance. Tolkien explained both their presence and their ambiguous loyalty with his interpretation of the story. Recent scholarship has examined how Tolkien&#x27;s views on Hengest have influenced his fictionalization of early English origins in his legendarium.

<text>Mr. Bliss is a children&#x27;s picture book by J. R. R. Tolkien, published posthumously in book form in 1982. One of Tolkien&#x27;s least-known short works, it tells the story of Mr. Bliss and his first ride in his new motor-car. Many adventures follow: encounters with bears, angry neighbours, irate shopkeepers, and assorted collisions.

== Narrative ==

&quot;Mr. Bliss&quot; tells the story, in pictures and handwritten text, of Mr. Bliss and his first ride in his new motor-car. Many adventures follow: encounters with bears, angry neighbours, irate shopkeepers, and assorted collisions.

== Concept and creation ==

The story was inspired by Tolkien&#x27;s own vehicular mishaps with his first car, purchased in 1932. The bears were based on toy bears owned by Tolkien&#x27;s sons. Tolkien was both author and illustrator of the book. His narrative binds the story and illustrations tightly together, as the text often comments directly on the pictures.

Several commentators have compared &quot;Mr. Bliss&quot; with the works of Beatrix Potter and Edward Lear, and also to &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;.

&quot;Mr. Bliss&quot; was not published during Tolkien&#x27;s lifetime. He submitted it to his publishers as a balm to readers who were hungry for more from him after the success of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. The ink and coloured pencil illustrations would have made production costs prohibitively expensive. Tolkien agreed to redraw the pictures in a simpler style, but then found he didn&#x27;t have time to do it. The manuscript lay in a drawer until 1957, when he sold it (as well as the original manuscripts of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, and &quot;Farmer Giles of Ham&quot;) to Marquette University for £1,250. It was first published by George Allen &amp; Unwin in hardback in 1982. It had Tolkien&#x27;s difficult-to-read handwritten story and illustrations on one page, and a typeset transcription on the facing page.

Alex Lewis, in &quot;Mallorn&quot;, writes that Tolkien lamented the loss of the countryside in and around Oxfordshire. Tolkien loved nature, especially trees, and had what Lewis calls &quot;well-founded&quot; fears for the environment, &quot;verg[ing] on the prophetic&quot;. Lewis analyses the factors that were causing this loss. They included the growth in Oxfordshire&#x27;s population in the 20th century (doubling between 1920 and 1960); the area&#x27;s industrialisation by Morris Motors, and the concomitant increase in motor traffic in the city of Oxford; the building of roads, including the M40 motorway cutting across the countryside; and the suburbanisation of Oxford as commuters started to use the railway to allow them to live in Oxford but work in London. The Second World War increased the number of airfields in the area from 5 to 96, causing the Oxfordshire countryside to be &quot;gutted&quot;. Tolkien found that it was &quot;difficult [in 1949] to recapture the spirit of the former days, when we used to beat the bounds of the L[ittle] K[ingdom] [as in &quot;Farmer Giles of Ham&quot;] in an ancient car.&quot; Tolkien was horrified by the change that motor traffic wreaked on Oxford, and the air pollution; he gave up his happy but dangerous driving, as depicted in &quot;Mr. Bliss&quot;, at the start of the war.

Tolkien used two names from &quot;Mr. Bliss&quot; for hobbits in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;: Gaffer Gamgee and Boffin.

<text>Dynamo Joe was a comic book series published by First Comics from 1986 to 1988. Created, plotted and drawn by Doug Rice, it was scripted first by John Ostrander then by Phil Foglio. Ben Dunn sometimes filled in for Rice on the art.

The series occurred in the future, involving a war in which three star-faring civilizations are being invaded by the alien and seemingly mindless Mellenares, huge green killing machines traveling in a straight line and destroying everything in their path. The brunt of the human defenses are giant, fusion-powered robots (&quot;battle suits&quot;) called &quot;Dynamo Class Robosoldiers&quot; and crewed by living individuals. These battle suits can be configured for either planetary or space combat, and contain or use a wide variety of weaponry. &quot;Dynamo Joe&quot; focuses on the crew of one such suit: Imperium soldier Elanian Daro and Tavitan (humanoid feline) mechanic Pomru Purrwakkawakka, and their critical contributions to the war effort. &quot;Dynamo Joe&quot; ranged in tone from action-packed space opera to slapstick humor.

== Publication history ==
The series premiered as a back-up in the comic book series &quot;Mars&quot; published by FIRST COMICS, INC., then ran as a staple for the five-issue run of the anthology &quot;First Adventures&quot;, before moving to its own series. The back-up shorts found in MARS comic issues #10-12 were reprinted (with additional pages added) in &quot;Dynamo Joe Special #1&quot;. &quot;Dynamo Joe&quot; was supposed to be a three-issue limited series, but ended up running for 15 issues, reaching a sort of resolution before cancellation. Rice was a fan of Japanese giant robot adventures, such as &quot;Robotech&quot;, and the battle suits were designed in that spirit.

== Characters ==
===Elanian Daro===
Elanian Daro was once a captain in the Imperium Officer Corp, and for some undisclosed reason was busted down to the rank of sergeant. It is known that the Magna Khan himself takes personal interest in Elanian Daro and considers him to be of great value. When busted out of the Imperium military, he was quickly snatched up by the Earth forces and attained the rank of Over Sergeant and placed in a command position. Elanian once held the temporary rank of general when the asteroid used for a command base was taken over by the &quot;dreamers&quot; that had been taken over by the Mellenares. Daro came to be a personal friend of the base commander, who apparently had more data on Daro than he himself did.

Daro had a sister who was consort to the Imperium prince that oversaw the Imperium fleet. She was killed when the prince attempted to overthrow the Magna Khan.

===Pomru Purrwakkawakka===
Pomru Purrwakkawakka was given great leniency in modifying the Dynamo Joe battlesuit and was known for pilfering objects and performing frequent modifications, despite the fact that he had clearance to nearly anything he wanted. He figured it was easier to ask forgiveness than permission—he also considered petty larceny to be part of the &quot;fun&quot; involved. Dynamo Joe was the most advanced robosoldier suit on the front line as a result of his ongoing upgrades, many of which were derived from observing/studying the extra-dimensional, sentient battlesuit &quot;Wolf-1&quot;, which was operated by a mercenary from the pan-dimensional city of Cynosure.

== In-story information ==
===Human culture===
The Earth-based human culture was delineated by Earth-colonized worlds, held together by interstellar travel utilizing hyperspace, and the &quot;Blood Nations&quot;, consisting of the Native American diaspora to the stars. The Blood Nations appeared to generally engage in constant warfare and piracy, while the colonized worlds reflected various ethnic settlements and were preyed upon by the Blood Nations.

Previous to the war with the Mellenares, the Earth military forces were engaged with anti-piracy operations against various Blood Nation factions. Upon contact with the planet eating Mellenares the Blood Nations reached an uneasy alliance with the Earth military forces and joined in combat against the mutual enemy.

===Imperium culture===
The Imperium is ruled by the Magna Khan, who left Earth with his harem in a starship for parts unknown in the 22nd century. The Magna Khan is immortal and uses his various princes and princesses to be his imperial government. As only the Magna Khan is immortal, it is the goal of each citizen to become so famous that the Magna Khan will remember his name, thus sharing in his immortality. Imperium subjects are commanded to be fit both mentally and physically - there are no fat or stupid Imperium citizens. Additionally, the Khan is involved in some sort of breeding/genetics program that appears to involve Elanian Daro, who happens to resemble the Magna Khan a great deal.

The Imperium is extremely advanced in technology and culture, focusing greatly on martial arts training. Imperium citizens are physically distinguished by their hair color (blue, green, white, etc.) and their eyebrows, which are forked as they approach the temple.

===Tavitan culture===
The Tavitans are a matriarchal society ruled by a &quot;Great Mother&quot;. They are also known for some psychic ability as it was a vision by a Tavitan that foretold of the coming of the Mellenares. Young Tavitans are known to be excitable and seek adventure, and it was not unusual for them to go out into the world/galaxy and sow their wild oats before settling down into married life.

Tavitans place great trust in their instincts and are natural mechanics, engineers, and tinkerers, if not great soldiers. The younger they are, the less reliable, patient, and disciplined they tend to be.

The Tavitan Homeworld, Londree, orbits (ironically enough) the &quot;Dog Star&quot;, Sirius, in a system of planets also threatened by the Mellenares advance. As a species, the Tavitans are nocturnal, so the culture works &quot;the night-shift&quot;, which is something off-worlders who visit Londree find difficult to adjust to.

Apart from being superb engineers (even in null-gravity), other Tavitans in the Alliance have been given duties in Intelligence and Research &amp; Development. Their codes are impenetrable, and they always think &quot;outside-the-box&quot; when designing new hardware. Pvt. Pomru is part of a small contingent of male Tavitans actually part of integrated forward combat units, like the members of the &quot;Lafayette Escadrille&quot; of World War I on Earth.

<text>Lip sync or lip synch (pronounced , the same as the word &quot;sink&quot;), short for lip synchronization, is a technical term for matching a speaking or singing person&#x27;s lip movements with sung or spoken vocals.

Audio for lip syncing is generated through the sound reinforcement system in a live performance or via television, computer, cinema speakers, or other forms of audio output. The term can refer to any of a number of different techniques and processes, in the context of live performances and audiovisual recordings.

In film production, lip syncing is often part of the post-production phase. Dubbing foreign-language films and making animated characters appear to speak both require elaborate lip syncing. Many video games make extensive use of lip-synced sound files to create an immersive environment in which on-screen characters appear to be speaking. In the music industry, lip syncing is used by singers for music videos, television and film appearances and some types of live performances. Lip syncing by singers can be controversial to fans attending concert performances who expect to view a live performance.

==In music==

Lip sync is considered a form of miming. It can be used to make it appear as though actors have substantial singing ability (e.g., &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; television show), to simulate a vocal effect that can be achieved only in the recording studio (e.g., Cher&#x27;s &quot;Believe&quot;, which used an Auto-Tune effects processing on her voice); to improve performance during choreographed live dance numbers that incorporate vocals; to misattribute vocals entirely (e.g., Milli Vanilli, a band which lip synced to recordings made by other singers), or to cover deficiencies in live performance. It is also commonly used in drag shows. Sometimes lip sync performances are forced on performers by television producers to shorten the guest appearances of celebrities, as it requires less time for rehearsals and hugely simplifies the process of sound mixing, or to eliminate the risk of vocal errors. Some artists lip sync because they are not confident singing live and want to avoid singing out of tune.

Because the film track and music track are recorded separately during the creation of a music video, artists usually lip sync their songs and often imitate playing musical instruments as well. Artists also sometimes move their lips at a faster speed than the recorded track, to create videos with a slow-motion effect in the final clip, which is widely considered to be complex to achieve. Similarly, some artists have been known to lip sync backward for music videos such that, when reversed, the singer is seen to sing forwards while time appears to move backwards in his or her surroundings, such as in Coldplay&#x27;s &quot;The Scientist&quot;.
Notable exceptions to this trend include Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s hit &quot;Streets of Philadelphia&quot;, which only uses the instruments as a backing track while the vocals were recorded with a microphone attached on the singer, giving a different feel to it.

On &quot;American Bandstand&quot; and most variety shows of the 1960s, vocals and instrumentals were all (with a few notable exceptions on American Bandstand) synced to pre-recorded music. Since the creation of MTV in the 1980s, many artists have focused on visual effects, rather than singing, for their live shows. Artists often lip sync during strenuous dance numbers in both live and recorded performances.

===Complex performance===

Artists often lip sync during strenuous dance numbers in both live and recorded performances, due to lung capacity being needed for physical activity (both at once would require incredibly trained lungs). Michael Jackson is an example of this; he performed complex dance routines while lip syncing and live singing. His performance on the television special &quot;Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever&quot; (1983) changed the scope of live stage show. Ian Inglis, author of &quot;Performance and Popular Music: History, Place and Time&quot; (2006) notes the fact that &quot;Jackson lip-synced &#x27;Billie Jean&#x27; is, in itself, not extraordinary, but the fact that it did not change the impact of the performance is extraordinary; whether the performance was live or lip synced made no difference to the audience,&quot; thus creating an era in which artists recreate the spectacle of music video imagery on stage.

Chris Nelson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported: &quot;Artists like Madonna and Janet Jackson set new standards for showmanship, with concerts that included not only elaborate costumes and precision-timed pyrotechnics but also highly athletic dancing. These effects came at the expense of live singing.&quot; Edna Gundersen of &quot;USA Today&quot; comments that the complexity of modern stage show has forced &quot;singing and musicianship into minor roles&quot;, citing as example artists such as New Kids on the Block, Milli Vanilli, George Michael, Cher, Paula Abdul and Janet Jackson. Gundersen elaborates: &quot;The most obvious example is Madonna&#x27;s Blond Ambition World Tour, a visually preoccupied and heavily choreographed spectacle. Madonna lip-syncs the duet &#x27;Now I&#x27;m Following You&#x27;, while a Dick Tracy character mouths Warren Beatty&#x27;s recorded vocals. On other songs, background singers plump up her voice, strained by the exertion of non-stop dancing.&quot;

===Changing fan expectations===
&quot;Billboard&quot; editor Thom Duffy commented in 1990: &quot;The expectations of fans have changed, and that&#x27;s the driving force here ... They expect a concert as perfect as what they see on MTV.&quot; Rashod D. Ollison of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; observed in 2004: &quot;Since the advent of MTV and other video music channels, pop audiences have been fed elaborate videos thick with jaw-dropping effects, awesome choreography, fabulous clothes, marvelous bodies. And the same level of perfection is expected to extend beyond the video set to the concert stage. So if Britney Spears, Janet Jackson or Madonna sounds shrill and flat without a backing track, fans won&#x27;t pay up to $300 for a concert ticket.&quot;

===Using real singing and some lip syncing===
Some singers habitually lip sync during live performances, both concert and televised, over pre-recorded music and mimed backing vocals; this is known as singing over playback. Some artists switch between live singing and lip syncing during a performance, particularly during songs that require them to hit particularly high or low notes. Lip syncing these notes ensures that the performer will not be out of tune or strain their voice. Once the difficult portion of the song has passed, the artist may continue to lip sync or may resume singing live. Some artists lip sync choruses during songs but sing the main verses.

===Musical theater===
The practice of syncing also occurs in musical theater, for much the same purpose as for musicians. A production may include a mix of lip synced and live musical numbers. In long-running shows, this may be done to help protect the performer&#x27;s voice from strain and damage, as well as to maintain a high caliber of production. A notable example of using lip syncing as a special effect includes performances of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, with swing actors in the same costumes as the lead actors give the illusion of the characters moving around the stage with some mystery.

===Parade floats===
Artists may also lip sync in situations in which their backup bands and sound reinforcement systems cannot be accommodated, such as the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, which features popular singers lip syncing while riding floats.

===Incorrect allegations===
Sometimes lip syncing is incorrectly identified by fans sitting in the back of a stadium because of the time it takes sound to carry over distance. Viewers might, for example, see a drummer hit a kit before they actually hear the sound. The delay can be mistaken for poor synchronization of miming artists and a backing track.

It is also possible that fans who are watching a live performance on a large-screen video display, either in the venue or remotely as in a live broadcast, are actually seeing a real lip sync timing error. These can be created by the video signal processing delay that occurs in the electronic video signal path between the on stage camera and the large screen displays. This lip sync error can cause those fans to perceive the performance as less entertaining or possibly negatively, as compared to a performance displayed without the electronically introduced error.

There is a technical solution to this problem, the SMPTE ST-2064 standard, but as of March 2018 it has not been adopted by any television production groups such as those who provide large venue television, or by broadcasters who provide live broadcasts. These video signal processing delays, the negative perceptions that are created and the SMPTE ST-2064 standard are discussed in audio to video synchronization.

===Types===
&quot;[S]ome of the most talented singers have been caught in the act of lip-synching&quot;. Arts journalist Chuck Taylor says that it is considered &quot;an egregious offense&quot;, but he points out that when singers are dancing and doing complex stage shows, it is hard to sing live. On some TV show performances, &quot;the singer&#x27;s microphone is still on. On the parts they&#x27;re not confident on or if the performance is physically demanding, the artist will sing quieter, and more of the performance [backing] track vocals can be heard.&quot; There are &quot;very few artists who [...] completely lip-sync&quot; while a backing track is playing with &quot;full lead vocals&quot;, a practice done due to &quot;weather conditions, technical issues, or sickness.&quot;

===For entertainment and effect===
Lip syncing where the audience knows the performer is pretending has also been popular as a form of musical pantomime, in which performers mime to pre-recorded music for the public&#x27;s entertainment. It is often performed by drag performers (drag queens and drag kings). Iron Maiden and Muse both mocked demands by two music television programs to give mimed performances, by having their band members deliberately swap instruments.

Examples of lip sync performances (sometimes referred to as a lip dub video) have also been popular as viral videos on the internet. An early example, &quot;Numa Numa&quot;, a video recorded by Gary Brolsma of him dancing and lip syncing to the song &quot;Dragostea din Tei&quot;, was ranked in 2007 by The Viral Factory as the second most-viewed viral video of all time behind the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Kid.

Various television competition programs have been built around lip sync performances, such as &quot;Puttin&#x27; on the Hits&quot;, and &quot;Lip Service&quot;. Comedian Jimmy Fallon incorporated similar performances with celebrities as sketches during his late night talk show &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;; he oversaw a standalone television series for Spike, &quot;Lip Sync Battle&quot;, which extended the concept into a competitive format between pairs of celebrities. Owing to their prominence as part of drag culture, the reality competition franchise &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot; uses lip sync performances as a recurring challenge, particularly to eliminate contestants.

Mobile apps such as Dubsmash and TikTok (which acquired and shut down Musical.ly in 2017), which allow users to record their own lip sync videos to pre-existing audio and song clips for sharing on social networking services or an internal platform, have also been popular.

In 2015, Maine Mendoza — a Filipino content creator who had been nicknamed the &quot;Queen of Dubsmash&quot; — became a cast member of the Filipino variety show &quot;Eat Bulaga!&quot; She appeared in a recurring sketch as a character named Yaya Dub, whose dialogue consisted exclusively of lip synced audio. Her spontaneous reactions to fellow cast member Alden Richards during a remote broadcast resulted in the creation of an on-air couple known as AlDub, in which the two were portrayed as a couple who never physically meet, and communicated solely via lip syncing. The couple became a major cultural phenomenon in the country, and appeared on-stage for the first time in an October 2015 concert special, &quot;Tamang Panahon&quot;. A hashtag associated with the special received 41 million posts within 24 hours on Twitter, beating a global record previously set during Brazil and Germany&#x27;s semi-final match at the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

===Legal and ethical aspects===
In the Australian state of New South Wales, the government is considering new laws that would require pop singers to print disclaimers on tickets &quot;to alert fans if [the singers] intend on miming throughout their shows&quot;. Fair Trading Minister Virginia Judge stated that &quot;Let&#x27;s be clear – live means live.&quot; Minister Judge stated that &quot;If you are spending up to $200 [on concert tickets], I think you deserve better than a film clip&quot;. She indicated that &quot;The NSW Government would be happy to look at options, such as a disclaimer on a ticket which would warn consumers a performance is completely pre-recorded.&quot;

A writer on ethics calls lip syncing an &quot;affront to all legitimate live performers who risk lyric mistakes and cracking voices to give an authentic performance&quot;. The author argues that lip syncing in live concerts will &quot;...destroy our ability to enjoy great live performances the way we once could, thrilling to the certain knowledge that we are witnessing something extraordinary from a great talent&quot;. The author argues that this &quot;...makes lip-syncing in public performances wrong. Not only is the audience being lied to; it is being made cynical&quot;.

===Examples===
While Michael Jackson&#x27;s performance on the television special &quot;Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever&quot; (1983) changed the scope of live stage show, as he mixed singing and complex dance moves, Ian Inglis, author of &quot;Performance and Popular Music: History, Place and Time&quot; (2006) states that &quot;Jackson lip-synced &#x27;Billie Jean&#x27;&quot; during this TV show. In 1989, a &quot;New York Times&quot; article claimed that &quot;Bananarama&#x27;s recent &quot;concert&quot; at the Palladium&quot;, the &quot;first song had a big beat, layered vocal harmonies and a dance move for every line of lyrics&quot;, but &quot;the drum kit was untouched until five songs into the set, or that the backup vocals (and, it seemed, some of the lead vocals as well-a hybrid lead performance) were on tape along with the beat&quot;. The article also claims that &quot;British band Depeche Mode, ...adds vocals and a few keyboard lines to [a] taped backup [track when they perform] onstage&quot;.
In 1989, during a Milli Vanilli performance recorded by MTV at the Lake Compounce theme park in Bristol, Connecticut, what sounded to be a pre-recorded track of the group&#x27;s song &quot;Girl You Know It&#x27;s True&quot; jammed and began to skip, repeating the partial line &quot;Girl, you know it&#x27;s...&quot; over and over. Due to rising public questions regarding the source of singing talent in the group, owner Frank Farian confessed to reporters on November 12, 1990, that Morvan and Pilatus did not actually sing on the records. As a result of American media pressure, Milli Vanilli&#x27;s Grammy was withdrawn four days later, and Arista Records dropped the act from its roster and deleted their album and its masters from their catalog, taking the album &quot;Girl You Know It&#x27;s True&quot; out of print in the process. After these details emerged, at least 26 different lawsuits were filed under various U.S. consumer fraud protection laws. On August 28, a settlement was approved that refunded those who attended concerts along with those who bought Milli Vanilli recordings. An estimated 10 million buyers were eligible to claim a refund.

Chris Nelson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that by the 1990s, &quot;[a]rtists like Madonna and Janet Jackson set new standards for showmanship, with concerts that included not only elaborate costumes and precision-timed pyrotechnics but also highly athletic dancing. These effects came at the expense of live singing.&quot; Edna Gundersen of &quot;USA Today&quot; reported: &quot;The most obvious example is Madonna&#x27;s Blond Ambition World Tour, a visually preoccupied and heavily choreographed spectacle. Madonna lip syncs the duet &quot;Now I&#x27;m Following You&quot;, while a Dick Tracy character mouths Warren Beatty&#x27;s recorded vocals. On other songs, background singers plump up her voice, strained by the exertion of non-stop dancing.&quot;

Similarly, in reviewing Janet Jackson&#x27;s Rhythm Nation World Tour, Michael MacCambridge of the &quot;Austin American-Statesman&quot; commented &quot;[i]t seemed unlikely that anyone—even a prized member of the First Family of Soul Music—could dance like she did for 90 minutes and still provide the sort of powerful vocals that the &#x27;90s super concerts are expected to achieve.&quot;

The music video for Electrasy&#x27;s 1998 single &quot;Morning Afterglow&quot; featured lead singer Alisdair McKinnell lip syncing the entire song backwards. This allowed the video to create the effect of an apartment being tidied by &#x27;un-knocking over&#x27; bookcases, while the music plays forwards.

On October 23, 2004, US pop singer Ashlee Simpson appeared as a musical guest of episode 568 of the live comedy TV show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. During her performance, &quot;she was revealed to apparently be lip-synching&quot;. According to &quot;her manager-father[,]...his daughter needed the help because acid reflux disease had made her voice hoarse.&quot; Her manager stated that &quot;Just like any artist in America, she has a backing track that she pushes so you don&#x27;t have to hear her croak through a song on national television.&quot; During the incident, vocal parts from a previously performed song began to sound while the singer was &quot;holding her microphone at her waist&quot;; she made &quot;some exaggerated hopping dance moves, then walked off the stage&quot;.
In 2009, US pop singer Britney Spears was &quot;&#x27;extremely upset&#x27; over the savaging she has received after lip-synching at her Australian shows&quot;, where ABC News Australia reported that &quot;[d]isappointed fans ...stormed out of Perth&#x27;s Burswood Dome after only a few songs&quot;. Reuters reports that Britney Spears &quot;is, and always has been, about blatant, unapologetic lip-synching&quot;. The article claims that &quot;at the New York stop of her anticipated comeback tour, Spears used her actual vocal cords only three times – twice to thank the crowd, and once to sing a ballad (though the vocals during that number were questionable, as well)&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine stated that &quot;Though some reports indicate Spears did some live singing [in her 2009 concerts], the &quot;L.A. Times&quot; Ann Powers notes that the show was dominated by backing tracks (which granted, is not the same thing as miming)&quot;.

Teenage viral video star Keenan Cahill openly lip syncs popular songs on his YouTube channel. His popularity has increased as he included guests such as rapper 50 Cent in November 2010 and David Guetta in January 2011, sending him to be one of the most popular channels on YouTube in January 2011.

The Beatles ran foul of the contemporaneous British law against miming on television in 1967 with their lip synced promo clip to their song &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot;. On the 21 November 1967 edition of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, the song was thus played over a series of sequences from the band&#x27;s 1964 film &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;. On the 7 December edition of the show, a specially-made black and white promo clip was broadcast with the song, which consisted of the band members editing their telefilm &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;, and (other than the official promo clip in color including miming, which first became commercially available with the 1996 VHS release of &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot;) was not released on home video up until appearing as a bonus feature on the 2012 DVD release of &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;.

Indian cinema relies heavily on lip syncing. Lip syncing by a playback singer is almost exclusively used in Indian cinema, where actors perform song and dance sequences in movies while lip syncing to the song that is sung by playback singers. The playback singers are officially recognised and have gained much fame in their careers. Some notables among them are Lata Mangeshkar, Kishore Kumar, Muhammad Rafi, Asha Bhosle, Sonu Nigam, Shreya Ghoshal, and many more.

*Gene Pitney was involved in a memorable gaffe on ITV&#x27;s &quot;This Morning&quot; in 1989, owing to a &quot;technical mishap&quot;. Giving an ostensibly live performance of his track &quot;You&#x27;re the Reason&quot;, Pitney missed his cue and was seen &quot;failing dismally to mime along in time to his backing track&quot;; he tried not to laugh and continued with the song. The incident has been repeated on television over the years, notably on a 2002 episode of BBC One series &quot;Room 101&quot;, where host Paul Merton described it as a &quot;very funny moment&quot; in which Pitney came in &quot;unbearably late&quot;. It was re-aired on the 25th-anniversary edition of &quot;This Morning&quot; in 2013, where presenter Holly Willoughby &quot;broke out into a cold sweat&quot; while reliving the moment.
*50 Cent was caught lip syncing live on stage at the BET awards, watched by millions of people when DJ Whoo Kidd played the instrumental version of the hit song &quot;Amusement Park&quot;.
*During a concert at Madison Square Garden, the R &amp; B singer R. Kelly put down his microphone in the middle of a song and let his recorded vocals keep singing.
*The &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; called Janet Jackson &quot;one of pop&#x27;s most notorious onstage lip synchers&quot; in a 2001 article on lip syncing.

In an article about Katy Perry, entitled &quot;Lip-Sync Malfunction Forces Katy Perry to Use Her Own Voice to Sing&quot;, &quot;Gawker&quot; stated that while the pop star was &quot;performing her hit song &quot;Roar&quot; at the NRJ Music Awards in Cannes on Saturday, [she] suffered a devastating lip-sync malfunction.&quot; Perry was &quot;unable to match the backing track&quot; with her lip movements, causing the host to stop the performance and ask her if she wished to start again. Perry restarted the song, this time without the backing track. The producers issued a statement indicating that it was planned for Perry to sing live, except that a &quot;technical problem&quot; caused staff to play a &quot;bad soundtrack&quot;.

==== Recurring events ====
The Super Bowl has used lip syncing during singers&#x27; performances at the live-to-air sports event. During Super Bowl XLIII, &quot;Jennifer Hudson&#x27;s performance of the national anthem&quot; was &quot;lip-synched ...to a previously recorded track, and apparently so did Faith Hill who performed before her&quot;. The singers lip synced &quot;...at the request of Rickey Minor, the pregame show producer&quot;, who argued that &quot;There&#x27;s too many variables to go live.&quot; Subsequent Super Bowl national anthems were performed live. Whitney Houston&#x27;s rendition of the anthem at the 1991 Super Bowl was also reported to have been lip synced. Such pre-recorded performances for the Super Bowl&#x27;s halftime shows and national anthem have been commonplace since the 1990s; the NFL has confirmed this as standard practice. In January 1998, singer-songwriter Jewel was criticised for lip syncing the American national anthem at the opening of the Super Bowl XXXII to a digitally-recorded track of her own voice. This was noticeable as the singer missed her cue, and thus, did not sing the first few words of the song. Super Bowl producers have since admitted that they attempt to have all performers pre-record their vocals.

Some Olympics events have used lip syncing. In the 2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, the song &quot;Ode to the Motherland&quot; appeared to be sung by Lin Miaoke at the ceremony, but it emerged that she mimed her performance to a recording by another girl, Yang Peiyi, who actually won the audition. It was a last-minute decision to use lip syncing, following a Politburo member&#x27;s objection to Yang&#x27;s physical appearance. International Olympic Committee executive director Gilbert Felli defended the use of a more photogenic double.

On February 10, 2006, Luciano Pavarotti appeared during a performance of the opera aria &quot;Nessun Dorma&quot; at the 2006 Winter Olympics opening ceremony in Turin, Italy, at his final performance. In the last act of the opening ceremony, his performance received the longest and loudest ovation of the night from the international crowd. Leone Magiera, the conductor who directed the performance, revealed in his 2008 memoirs, &quot;Pavarotti Visto da Vicino&quot;, that the performance was prerecorded weeks earlier. &quot;The orchestra pretended to play for the audience, I pretended to conduct and Luciano pretended to sing. The effect was wonderful,&quot; he wrote. Pavarotti&#x27;s manager, Terri Robson, said that the tenor had turned the Winter Olympic Committee&#x27;s invitation down several times because it would have been impossible to sing late at night in the sub-zero conditions of Turin in February. The committee eventually persuaded him to take part by pre-recording the song.

===Protests by artists===
On occasion, some vocalists have protested being asked to lip sync on television programs by blatantly drawing attention to the fact they are not singing live. When Public Image Limited singer John Lydon performed on &quot;American Bandstand,&quot; &quot;&quot;&quot;instead he sat on the floor of the studio, threw himself into the assembled audience, and stuck his nose into the camera while recordings over his own voice played&quot;. When appearing on a TV program in Detroit in 1966, Frank Zappa and his band similarly gathered on a &quot;stage&quot; with items from the station&#x27;s props department, and asked his band members to perform &quot;a repeatable physical action, not necessarily in sync with (or even related to) the lyrics, and do it over and over until our spot on the show was concluded&quot;, leading to a performance Zappa described as &quot;Detroit&#x27;s first whiff of homemade prime-time Dada.&quot;

Morrissey protested a similar policy on the BBC music programme &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; by singing &quot;This Charming Man&quot; with a fern plant as a &quot;microphone&quot;. When appearing on a German music programme in 1986, English metal band Iron Maiden gave a lip synced performance of &quot;Wasted Years&quot; where the band blatantly swapped instruments mid-song, and at one point had three members &quot;playing&quot; the drums at the same time.

===Reception and impact===
After the Milli Vanilli vocal miming scandal, it &quot;...forever embedded skepticism into the minds (and ears) of the listener.&quot; In the fallout of this miming controversy, MTV&#x27;s &quot;Unplugged&quot; series was launched, &quot;a showcase for artists wanting to prove they were more than just studio creations&quot;. As the show used live performances with singers and acoustic instruments, it required performers to &quot;...display their unembellished voices and ability to perform live.&quot; On MTV &quot;Unplugged&quot;, artists could not use lip syncing, backup tracks, synthesizers, and racks of vocal effects. With &quot;Unplugged&quot;, authenticity in live performances again became an important value in popular music.

Ellie Goulding and Ed Sheeran have called for honesty in live shows by joining the &quot;Live Means Live&quot; campaign. &quot;Live Means Live&quot; was launched by songwriter/composer David Mindel. When a band displays the &quot;Live Means Live&quot; logo, the audience knows, &quot;there&#x27;s no Auto-Tune, nothing that isn&#x27;t 100 per cent live&quot; in the show, and there are no backing tracks.

==In video==
===Film===
In film production, lip syncing is often part of the post-production phase. Most film today contains scenes where the dialogue has been re-recorded afterwards; lip syncing is the technique used when animated characters speak, and lip syncing is essential when films are dubbed into other languages. In many musical films, actors sang their own songs beforehand in a recording session and lip synced during filming, but many also lip synced to playback singers, voices other than their own. Rex Harrison was the exception in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;. Marni Nixon sang for Deborah Kerr in &quot;The King and I&quot; and for Audrey Hepburn in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, Annette Warren for Ava Gardner in &quot;Show Boat&quot;, Robert McFerrin for Sidney Poitier in &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, Betty Wand for Leslie Caron in &quot;Gigi&quot;, Lisa Kirk for Rosalind Russell in &quot;Gypsy&quot;, and Bill Lee for Christopher Plummer in &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;.

Some pre-overdubbed performances have survived, such as Hepburn&#x27;s original &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; vocals (included in documentaries related to the film), and Gardner&#x27;s original vocals in &quot;Show Boat&quot; were heard for the first time in the 1994 documentary &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment! III&quot;. When songs appear in non-musical films, however, the actors sing live on set, but later dub their voices in ADR using a &quot;better&quot; performance of the song.

Lip syncing is almost always used in modern musical films (&quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; being an exception) and in biopics such as &quot;Ray&quot; and &quot;La Vie en Rose&quot;, where the original recording adds authenticity. But some early musicals usually use live recordings.

In the 1950s MGM classic &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;, lip syncing is a major plot point, with Debbie Reynolds&#x27; character, Kathy Selden, providing the voice for the character Lina Lamont (played by Jean Hagen). Writing in UK Sunday newspaper &quot;The Observer&quot;, Mark Kermode noted, &quot;Trivia buffs love to invoke the ironic dubbing of Debbie Reynolds by Betty Noyes on &quot;Would You&quot;&quot; although he pointed out that &quot;the 19-year-old Reynolds never puts a foot wrong on smashers like &quot;Good Morning&quot;&quot;. Reynolds also later acknowledged Betty Noyes&#x27; uncredited contribution to the film, writing: &quot;I sang &quot;You Are My Lucky Star&quot; with Gene Kelly. It was a very rangy song and done in his key. My part did not come out well, and my singing voice was dubbed in by Betty Royce [sic]&quot;.

===ADR===
Automated dialogue replacement, also known as &quot;ADR&quot; or &quot;looping&quot;, is a film sound technique involving the re-recording of dialogue after photography. Sometimes the dialogue recorded on location is unsatisfactory either because it has too much background noise on it or the director is not happy with the performance, so the actors replace their own voices in a &quot;looping&quot; session after the filming.

===Animation===
Another manifestation of lip syncing is the art of making an animated character appear to speak in a prerecorded track of dialogue. The lip sync technique to make an animated character appear to speak involves figuring out the timings of the speech (breakdown) as well as the actual animating of the lips/mouth to match the dialogue track. The earliest examples of lip sync in animation were attempted by Max Fleischer in his 1926 short &quot;My Old Kentucky Home&quot;. The technique continues to this day, with animated films and television shows such as &quot;Shrek&quot;, &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot;, and &quot;The Simpsons&quot; using lip syncing to make their artificial characters talk. Lip syncing is also used in comedies such as &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot; and political satire, changing totally or just partially the original wording. It has been used in conjunction with translation of films from one language to another, for example, &quot;Spirited Away&quot;. Lip syncing can be a very difficult issue in translating foreign works to a domestic release, as a simple translation of the lines often leaves overrun or underrun of high dialog to mouth movements.

===Language dubbing===
Quality film dubbing requires that the dialogue is first translated in such a way that the words used can match the lip movements of the actor. This is often hard to achieve if the translation is to stay true to the original dialogue. Elaborate lip sync of dubbing is also a lengthy and expensive process. The more simplified non-phonetic representation of mouth movement in many anime helps this process.

In English-speaking countries, many foreign TV series (especially anime like &quot;Pokémon&quot;) are dubbed for television broadcast. However, cinematic releases of films tend to come with subtitles instead. The same is true of countries in which the local language is not spoken widely enough to make the expensive dubbing commercially viable (in other words, there is not enough market for it). However, other countries with a large-enough population dub all foreign films into their national language cinematic release. Dubbing is preferred by some because it allows the viewer to focus on the on-screen action, without reading the subtitles.

==In video games==
Early video games did not use any voice sounds, due to technical limitations. In the 1970s and early 1980s, most video games used simple electronic sounds such as bleeps and simulated explosion sounds. At most, these games featured some generic jaw or mouth movement to convey a communication process in addition to text. However, as games become more advanced in the 1990s and 2000s, lip sync and voice acting has become a major focus of many games. In the 2020s, facial animation provided by companies like FaceFX allows for synchronization more efficiently.

===Role-playing games===

Lip sync was for some time a minor focus in role-playing video games. Because of the amount of information conveyed through the game, the majority of communication uses of scrolling text. Older RPGs rely solely on text, using inanimate portraits to provide a sense of who is speaking. Some games make use of voice acting, such as Grandia II or Diablo, but due to simple character models, there is no mouth movement to simulate speech. RPGs for hand-held systems are still largely based on text, with the rare use of lip sync and voice files being reserved for full motion video cutscenes. Newer RPGs, have extensive audio dialogues. The Neverwinter Nights series are examples of transitional games where important dialogue and cutscenes are fully voiced, but less important information is still conveyed in text. In games such as Jade Empire and Knights of the Old Republic, developers created partial artificial languages to give the impression of full voice acting without having to actually voice all dialogue.

===Strategy games===
Unlike RPGs, strategy video games make extensive use of sound files to create an immersive battle environment. Most games simply played a recorded audio track on cue with some games providing inanimate portraits to accompany the respective voice. &quot;StarCraft&quot; used full motion video character portraits with several generic speaking animations that did not synchronize with the lines spoken in the game. The game did, however, make extensive use of recorded speech to convey the game&#x27;s plot, with the speaking animations providing a good idea of the flow of the conversation. &quot;Warcraft III&quot; used fully rendered 3D models to animate speech with generic mouth movements, both as character portraits as well as the in-game units. Like the FMV portraits, the 3D models did not synchronize with actual spoken text, while in-game models tended to simulate speech by moving their heads and arms rather than using actual lip synchronization. Similarly, the game Codename Panzers uses camera angles and hand movements to simulate speech, as the characters have no actual mouth movement. However, &quot;StarCraft II&quot; used fully synced unit portraits and cinematic sequences.

===First-person shooters===
FPS is a genre that generally places much more emphasis on graphical display, mainly due to the camera almost always being very close to character models. Due to increasingly detailed character models requiring animation, FPS developers assign many resources to create realistic lip synchronization with the many lines of speech used in most FPS games. Early 3D models used basic up-and-down jaw movements to simulate speech. As technology progressed, mouth movements began to closely resemble real human speech movements. &quot;Medal of Honor: Frontline&quot; dedicated a development team to lip sync alone, producing the most accurate lip synchronization for games at that time. Since then, games like &quot;Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault&quot; and &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; have made use of coding that dynamically simulates mouth movements to produce sounds as if they were spoken by a live person, resulting in astoundingly lifelike characters. Gamers who create their own videos using character models with no lip movements, such as the helmeted Master Chief from &quot;Halo&quot;, improvise lip movements by moving the characters&#x27; arms, bodies and making a bobbing movement with the head (see &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot;).

==Television transmission synchronization==

An example of a lip synchronization problem, also known as lip sync error is the case in which television video and audio signals are transported via different facilities (&quot;e.g.,&quot; a geosynchronous satellite radio link and a landline) that have significantly different delay times. In such cases, it is necessary to delay the earlier of the two signals electronically.

Lip sync issues have become a serious problem for the television industry worldwide. Lip sync problems are not only annoying but can lead to subconscious viewer stress which in turn leads to viewer dislike of the television program they are watching. Television industry standards organizations have become involved in setting standards for lip sync errors. In 2015 SMPTE (the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers) adopted Standard ST2064 which provides technology for greatly reducing or eliminating lip sync errors in television programming.

==Finger syncing==
The miming of the playing of a musical instrument, also called &quot;finger-syncing&quot;, is the instrument equivalent of lip syncing. A notable example of miming includes John Williams&#x27; piece at President Obama&#x27;s inauguration, which was a recording made two days earlier and mimed by musicians Yo-Yo Ma and Itzhak Perlman. The musicians wore earpieces to hear the playback. During Whitney Houston&#x27;s performance of &quot;The Star Spangled Banner&quot; with full orchestra, a pre-recorded version was used: &quot;At the game, everyone was playing, and Whitney was singing, but there were no live microphones,&quot; orchestra director Kathryn Holm McManus revealed in 2001. &quot;Everyone was lip synching or finger-synching.&quot;

<doc id="668449" wikidata="Q1801562" url="?curid=668449" title="Material derivative">
<text>In continuum mechanics, the material derivative describes the time rate of change of some physical quantity (like heat or momentum) of a material element that is subjected to a space-and-time-dependent macroscopic velocity field. The material derivative can serve as a link between Eulerian and Lagrangian descriptions of continuum deformation.

For example, in fluid dynamics, the velocity field is the flow velocity, and the quantity of interest might be the temperature of the fluid. In this case, the material derivative then describes the temperature change of a certain fluid parcel with time, as it flows along its pathline (trajectory).
==Other names==
There are many other names for the material derivative, including:
*advective derivative
*convective derivative
*derivative following the motion
*hydrodynamic derivative
*Lagrangian derivative
*particle derivative
*substantial derivative
*substantive derivative
*Stokes derivative
*total derivative, although the material derivative is actually a special case of the total derivative

The material derivative is defined for any tensor field &quot;y&quot; that is &quot;macroscopic&quot;, with the sense that it depends only on position and time coordinates, :
formula_1
where is the covariant derivative of the tensor, and is the flow velocity. Generally the convective derivative of the field , the one that contains the covariant derivative of the field, can be interpreted both as involving the streamline tensor derivative of the field , or as involving the streamline directional derivative of the field , leading to the same result. 
Only this spatial term containing the flow velocity describes the transport of the field in the flow, while the other describes the intrinsic variation of the field, independent of the presence of any flow. Confusingly, sometimes the name &quot;convective derivative&quot; is used for the whole material derivative , instead for only the spatial term . The effect of the time-independent terms in the definitions are for the scalar and tensor case respectively known as advection and convection.

===Scalar and vector fields===
For example, for a macroscopic scalar field and a macroscopic vector field the definition becomes:
formula_2

In the scalar case is simply the gradient of a scalar, while is the covariant derivative of the macroscopic vector (which can also be thought of as the Jacobian matrix of as a function of ). 
In particular for a scalar field in a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system , the components of the velocity are , and the convective term is then:
formula_3

==Development==
Consider a scalar quantity , where is time and is position. Here may be some physical variable such as temperature or chemical concentration. The physical quantity, whose scalar quantity is , exists in a continuum, and whose macroscopic velocity is represented by the vector field .

The (total) derivative with respect to time of is expanded using the multivariate chain rule:
formula_4

It is apparent that this derivative is dependent on the vector
formula_5
which describes a &quot;chosen&quot; path in space. For example, if formula_6 is chosen, the time derivative becomes equal to the partial time derivative, which agrees with the definition of a partial derivative: a derivative taken with respect to some variable (time in this case) holding other variables constant (space in this case). This makes sense because if formula_7, then the derivative is taken at some &quot;constant&quot; position. This static position derivative is called the Eulerian derivative.

An example of this case is a swimmer standing still and sensing temperature change in a lake early in the morning: the water gradually becomes warmer due to heating from the sun. In which case the term formula_8 is sufficient to describe the rate of change of temperature.

If the sun is not warming the water (i.e. formula_9), but the path is not a standstill, the time derivative of may change due to the path. For example, imagine the swimmer is in a motionless pool of water, indoors and unaffected by the sun. One end happens to be at a constant high temperature and the other end at a constant low temperature. By swimming from one end to the other the swimmer senses a change of temperature with respect to time, even though the temperature at any given (static) point is a constant. This is because the derivative is taken at the swimmer&#x27;s changing location and the second term on the right formula_10 is sufficient to describe the rate of change of temperature. A temperature sensor attached to the swimmer would show temperature varying with time, simply due to the temperature variation from one end of the pool to the other.

The material derivative finally is obtained when the path is chosen to have a velocity equal to the fluid velocity
formula_11

That is, the path follows the fluid current described by the fluid&#x27;s velocity field . So, the material derivative of the scalar is
formula_12

An example of this case is a lightweight, neutrally buoyant particle swept along a flowing river and experiencing temperature changes as it does so. The temperature of the water locally may be increasing due to one portion of the river being sunny and the other in a shadow, or the water as a whole may be heating as the day progresses. The changes due to the particle&#x27;s motion (itself caused by fluid motion) is called &quot;advection&quot; (or convection if a vector is being transported).

The definition above relied on the physical nature of a fluid current; however, no laws of physics were invoked (for example, it was assumed that a lightweight particle in a river will follow the velocity of the water), but it turns out that many physical concepts can be described concisely using the material derivative. The general case of advection, however, relies on conservation of mass of the fluid stream; the situation becomes slightly different if advection happens in a non-conservative medium.

Only a path was considered for the scalar above. For a vector, the gradient becomes a tensor derivative; for tensor fields we may want to take into account not only translation of the coordinate system due to the fluid movement but also its rotation and stretching. This is achieved by the upper convected time derivative.

==Orthogonal coordinates==
It may be shown that, in orthogonal coordinates, the -th component of the convection term of the material derivative of a vector field formula_13 is given by
formula_14

where the are related to the metric tensors by formula_15

In the special case of a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;), and being a 1-tensor (a vector with three components), this is just:
formula_16

where formula_17 is a Jacobian matrix.

There is also a vector-dot-del identity and the material derivative for a vector field formula_18 can be expressed as:

:formula_19

<doc id="668450" wikidata="Q382638" url="?curid=668450" title="Enzo Biagi">
<text>Enzo Biagi (; 9 August 1920 – 6 November 2007) was an Italian journalist, writer and former partisan.

==Life and career==
Biagi was born in Lizzano in Belvedere, and began his career as a journalist in Bologna. In 1952, he worked on the screenplay of the historical film &quot;Red Shirts&quot;. In 1953, he became the editor-in-chief of &quot;Epoca&quot; magazine.

Active in journalism for six decades and author of some eighty books, Biagi won numerous awards, among which were the 1979 Saint Vincent prize and the 1985 Ischia International Journalism Award. In 1987, he won the Premio Bancarella for his book &quot;Il boss è solo&quot;, interviewing former Sicilian Mafia boss Tommaso Buscetta, who had turned &quot;pentito&quot; (state witness). He worked on the Italian national TV channel Rai 1 until 2001.

On 9 May 2001, just two days before the general elections in Italy, during his daily prime time 10-minute TV show &quot;Il Fatto&quot;, broadcast on Rai Uno, Biagi interviewed the popular actor and director Roberto Benigni, who gave a hilarious talk about Silvio Berlusconi declaring his preference for the other candidate, Francesco Rutelli from the Olive Tree coalition.

=== Bulgarian Edict ===
Biagi disappeared from TV screens a few months after Berlusconi&#x27;s declarations in Sofia named also editto bulgaro, where the then-Prime Minister accused the popular journalist, together with fellow journalist Michele Santoro and showman/comedian Daniele Luttazzi, of having made criminal use of the public television service.

Biagi&#x27;s defenders argue that a public service should provide pluralism, and that a country where government prevents opposing ideas from being voiced on air is a regime.

The issue of Berlusconi&#x27;s motives for entering politics in the first place emerged in an interview that he gave with Biagi and Indro Montanelli, stating &quot;If I don&#x27;t enter politics, I will go to jail and become bankrupt&quot;.

=== Biagi&#x27;s return on TV and death ===
On 22 April 2007, 86-year-old Enzo Biagi made his TV comeback on the RAI with &quot;RT - Rotocalco Televisivo&quot;, a current affairs show which is broadcast on Rai 3. At the opening of the show, he declared:
Until shortly before his death he was also a columnist for the daily Italian newspaper &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot;, which he had worked for since the early 1970s.

== Awards ==
1953 – Riccione Prize for &quot;Giulia viene da lontano&quot;

1971 – Premio Bancarella for &quot;Testimone del tempo&quot;

1979 – Saint-Vincent Prize for Journalism

1979 – Gold Medal of Civic Merit from the Municipality of Milan

1993 – Honorary President of the Jury for the &quot;È giornalismo&quot; Prize

2003 – Honorary Citizenship of Fucecchio, the birthplace of Indro Montanelli

2004 – Award for the program &quot;Il Fatto&quot; as the best journalistic program of the first fifty years of Rai

2005 – Ilaria Alpi Television Journalism Career Award

<doc id="668453" wikidata="Q4916117" url="?curid=668453" title="Birds of a Feather (TV series)">
<text>Birds of a Feather is a British sitcom originally broadcast on BBC One from 16 October 1989 to 24 December 1998, then revived on ITV from 2 January 2014 to 24 December 2020. The series stars Pauline Quirke and Linda Robson, with Lesley Joseph. It was created by Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran, who also wrote many of the episodes.

In the first episode, sisters Sharon and Tracey are brought together when their husbands are sent to prison for armed robbery. Sharon, who lives in an Edmonton council flat, moves into Tracey&#x27;s upmarket house in Chigwell, Essex. Their next-door neighbour and later friend Dorien is a middle-aged married Jewish woman who is constantly having affairs with younger men. In the last two BBC series, the location is changed to nearby Hainault, London, before returning to Chigwell in series 10 (the first aired on ITV).

The series&#x27; original run ended on 24 December 1998 after nine years, and returned just over 15 years later, on 2 January 2014 (this time on ITV) for a tenth series. The opening episode of the new series attracted almost eight million viewers, giving ITV its highest-rated comedy since &quot;Barbara&quot; in 2000. A further two series were broadcast, followed by two Christmas specials. There was a further Christmas special in 2020, in which Pauline Quirke did not appear due to her decision to take a step back from acting, in order to focus on her performing arts academy.

==Synopsis==
===Title===
The title comes from the idiom &quot;&quot;, meaning that people having similar characters, backgrounds, interests or beliefs will congregate.

===Tracey Stubbs and Sharon Theodopolopodous===
For Cockney sisters Sharon Theodopolopodous and Tracey Stubbs, life is never the same again when their husbands are convicted of armed robbery and sent to prison. Sharon, a common, fun-loving, large and loud-mouthed character from a council flat in Edmonton, moves into her sister&#x27;s luxury home in Chigwell, so that she can support Tracey, after her husband&#x27;s imprisonment.

Sharon always felt inadequate next to her slimmer, elder sister, and felt she had the tougher childhood. Her marriage to Chris, a waster of Greek Cypriot descent, was miserable and childless, supposedly due to Sharon&#x27;s infertility. Chris&#x27;s family condemn her for this, but Sharon discovers that Chris is actually the infertile one. Sharon happily cheats on Chris and gives him grief when visiting. Despite this, she becomes bitterly envious whenever he has another woman and only ever makes half-hearted attempts to divorce him until the first ITV series in 2014, in which Chris finally demands a divorce from Sharon so he can marry again. Tracey, however, loves her husband, Darryl. His legitimate business was building conservatories, but he made most of his money by robbing banks. Unlike Sharon, who is more realistic about their husbands, Tracey deludes herself into believing her husband is innocent, especially in the 1994 Christmas episode &quot;The Chigwell Connection&quot; and when Darryl is finally released in series seven, she trusts him when he asks for a cheque on the company account, which leads to Darryl defrauding her out of her business assets. He and Tracey have a son, Garth, who becomes a chef after going to boarding school and eventually marries Kimberley. This marriage does not last; in series 10, Garth has moved to Australia and started a relationship with a girl named Marcie. Tracey is the more honest and law-abiding of the two sisters, whereas Sharon is more willing to indulge in unscrupulous and often criminal activities, such as illegally subletting her council flat when she was living with Tracey, taking drugs, selling stolen merchandise, fiddling her VAT and claiming unemployment benefit while she was actually employed.

===Dorien Green===
The sisters&#x27; neighbour is the wealthy, snobbish, man-eating Dorien Green, a middle-aged woman who strives to create the impression that she is a glamorous beauty, dressing in a sexually provocative style, preferring mini-skirts, high heels and leopard print. She is played by Lesley Joseph. Dorien is married to Marcus, but is frequently involved with other men, with hilarious consequences. Dorien and Marcus are Jewish. Her marriage is also childless, due to her vanity and the lack of affection between her and Marcus. She is a regular, if uninvited, guest at Tracey&#x27;s house and mocks Sharon about her weight whilst Sharon teases Dorien about her lifestyle and age. However, Sharon and Tracey become the best friends Dorien has ever had and the mutual teasing is friendly and playful and it is often shown that Sharon and Tracey care for Dorien and vice versa. If any of them get into trouble or have a problem, the others are often the first to help, regardless of the consequences.

Although Dorien had several flings with younger men, Luke Horton was her most frequent lover and she appeared to genuinely love him, from the first series until he left Dorien for a younger woman in the second series. He later appeared in the eighth series when it is revealed that he has married and settled down. Dorien&#x27;s nemesis is the acid-tongued Melanie Fishman, a vindictive gossip who Dorien constantly attempts to outdo. Marcus eventually tires of Dorien&#x27;s selfishness and leaves her to begin a new life with his mistress and their children. Dorien later starts a loving relationship with Richard Summers, which is initially strained due to Richard&#x27;s teenage children taking an instant dislike to Dorien, which she gladly reciprocates.

There is some uncertainty about Dorien&#x27;s maiden name. She says that her father&#x27;s name was Arthur Friedman but a wedding invitation to Sharon and Tracey, reveals her mother&#x27;s name to be Estelle Kapper (although in the 2014 series it is stated her mother’s maiden name is Cohen). Later, Dorien refers to her maiden name as Kapper, and an old flame also remembers her as Dorien Kapper. She grew up in Burnt Oak in the London Borough of Barnet. Dorien has several times claimed to be a graduate but never specified which university she attended and when. Throughout the series, Dorien toys with novel writing but is unpublished, until 2014 in which she is an established author, going by the name of Foxy Cohen. Dorien&#x27;s mother appears on screen once but is often mentioned as an icy, domineering woman and the two clearly have a stormy relationship. Dorien also has a brother named Jeffrey, whom she believes to be their mother&#x27;s favourite, as he lives a modest life in a semi-detached house and unlike Dorien, has given their mother grandchildren. In series 11, it is revealed that when she was seventeen in 1965, Dorien had a fling with a man named Lionel and they had a daughter, Naomi, who was raised by Lionel. They reunite fifty years later when Dorien learns that Naomi is a vicar, yet she has inherited Dorien&#x27;s appearance and fondness for risqué behaviour. She also has a granddaughter named Emma, who Dorien takes a liking to. Emma and Travis have a fling before she moves away for a job.

In the final episode of series 12, which was broadcast on 25 February 2016, Dorien celebrated her seventieth birthday. This episode was filmed on 14 October 2015, Joseph&#x27;s actual 70th birthday.

===Released from prison===
In the series 7 episode, &quot;Cheers&quot;, Darryl and Chris are released from prison and are determined to start afresh. Chris feels remorse for his crimes and not treating Sharon better during their marriage. He impresses Sharon by getting an honest job as a pizza delivery man. Darryl, however, feels that the only way to give Tracey the lifestyle he feels she deserves is to return to crime. He attempts to launder counterfeit money into Sharon and Tracey&#x27;s swimming pool business but is caught and imprisoned again (at HMP Slade, an in-joke reference to &quot;Porridge&quot;) – along with an innocent Chris, much to Sharon&#x27;s dismay. Darryl and Tracey&#x27;s marriage is severely strained by this and Tracey contemplates leaving Darryl, but decides not to but tells him that she will not be waiting for him, like she did when he was imprisoned before. In series 9, Tracey discovers she is pregnant and panics that Darryl may not be the father until she learns the other man had a vasectomy. When Tracey gives birth to her second child, Travis, Sharon vows to stand by her sister and raise the child together.

Sharon and Tracey&#x27;s maternal aunt, &quot;Auntie Sylvie&quot; (Vivian Pickles), is frequently mentioned and appears twice. After Tracey&#x27;s and Sharon&#x27;s parents died, Sylvie raised them. The character is later killed off.

===Revival===
In the tenth series it is revealed that Tracey and Darryl have divorced and that Darryl moved to Wales on his release from prison. Tracey has remarried and is back living in her former marital home, &quot;Dalentrace&quot;, in Chigwell, kicking Sharon out due to her dislike of Tracey&#x27;s second husband, Ralph. At the start of the series, Sharon is back in her council flat and the two have not spoken for over six months when they &quot;bump into each other&quot; at a book signing. They are shocked to discover that the author of &quot;Sixty Shades of Green&quot; (a &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot; clone) is their old friend Dorien. When Tracey offers Sharon a lift home, she confesses that she has thrown Ralph out after catching him stealing from her. Lonely, she persuades Sharon to move back in with her. Travis feigns annoyance that Sharon is back, but it is then revealed that he set up their &quot;chance&quot; meeting at the book signing.

As the three plan how their new set-up will work, Dorien arrives unexpectedly, after learning that she is being sued for plagiarising &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot;. With all her assets frozen, she has no choice but to beg Tracey for a place to stay. Just as everyone is speculating how they will all fit into the house, Garth arrives with new girlfriend Marcie and her daughter, Poppy. By the end of the series Garth, Marcie and Poppy have moved out, with the couple opening a pop-up restaurant and the case against Dorien collapsed, due to a tabloid exposé about an MP she once dated – which proves the stories in her book were true. However, after initially planning to return to her former home in Hollywood, Dorien realises that Sharon and Tracey are her true friends and opts to stay with them.

In series 11, Garth comes home, having separated from Marcie. Dorien&#x27;s past comes back to haunt her when, amongst her fan mail, she finds a letter from the daughter she gave up for adoption. Dorien eventually agrees to meet Naomi (Frances Ruffelle), who she is stunned to discover is a vicar with two grown-up children. Meanwhile, Tracey is faced with health concerns when she discovers a large mole on her shoulder is malignant.

In series 12, the police tell Tracey that Darryl died in an attempted robbery and that Garth is next of kin. The funeral is attended by Tracey, Sharon, Dorien, Garth, Travis and many of Darryl&#x27;s gangster friends. Dorien is also revealed to have a granddaughter named Emma (Naomi&#x27;s daughter), who briefly moved into the Stubbs house.

==Production==
In the original series, most of the interior scenes were shot at Teddington Studios. The exterior filming location for &#x27;Dalentrace&#x27; was on Camp Road, Gerrards Cross area in Buckinghamshire. Streets in the North West London suburb of Pinner frequently doubled for Chigwell, the series&#x27; setting. In the original series, the prison exteriors were filmed at HM Prison Maidstone.

For the 2014 revived series, interior scenes were recorded in Studio 2 at The London Studios. Filming took place in front of an audience between 28 September and 24 November 2013. The show moved to Pinewood Studios for the second revived series of the show. Filming for this series took place in front of an audience between 8 October and 26 November 2014. The show returned in January 2016 and was recorded at Pinewood Studios from 2 September until 21 October 2015, again in front of a live audience in the studio.

===Revival===
On 3 March 2009, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; reported that the sitcom was set for a return and that Lesley Joseph, Pauline Quirke and Linda Robson had all been asked to make another series. Quirke was reported as saying that her acting school &quot;Quirky Kidz&quot; was really beginning to take off, so she would be hesitant about becoming involved in another creative project. After this speculation in 2009 nothing more was said. However, in July 2012 Joseph hinted that &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot; could return for another series following a successful stage tour.

In March 2013, Quirke appeared on ITV&#x27;s &quot;This Morning&quot; and confirmed that a script for a new series was &quot;on the desk at the BBC&quot; and they were just waiting for a decision on whether or not the BBC would commission a new series. The BBC offered to broadcast a one-off special episode, but this was refused by the producers of the show in favour of ITV&#x27;s offer of a series. Fifteen years after the original series ended, the original cast returned, this time on ITV.

Robson confirmed on her Twitter account that filming began on 16 September 2013, with eight new episodes broadcasting from 2 January 2014. It was also confirmed that all characters would return, including Tracey&#x27;s new child, who was born in the last episode (of the previous series, 16 years earlier). Matt Willis replaced Matthew Savage in the part of Garth (Garfie), making him the third actor to play the character; Willis was later replaced by Samuel James in 2015. Two new characters were introduced in the tenth series including Garth&#x27;s new girlfriend Marcie, who did not appear in the 2015 series. The first episode had mainly positive reviews, with fans saying the show had stayed true to itself. Quirke said that the cast returned with the intention of doing only one series, but she would not rule out doing further episodes if the scripts were right and the fans and viewers wanted more of the series. The opening episode attracted nearly eight million viewers, giving ITV its highest rated comedy since &quot;Barbara&quot; in 2000. On 16 January, Robson, Quirke and Joseph appeared on &quot;Loose Women&quot; to take over for one special episode to celebrate the series return and the ratings success. Robson had been a regular panellist on &quot;Loose Women&quot; since 2012.

In March 2014, ITV announced that a second series of eight episodes would be produced. In August 2014, Robson confirmed that filming would start on 7 September 2014 and continue until November and the series would be broadcast in January 2015. In November 2014, Robson confirmed that Willis would not return due to his commitments with McBusted. The role of Garth Stubbs was taken over by former &quot;EastEnders&quot; actor Samuel James. The series began airing on 26 December 2014, with a Christmas special and continued the following week (1 January 2015).

On 12 March 2015, ITV announced that a third series (the twelfth overall) was to be filmed later in the year. The series aired in January and February 2016. On 13 July 2016, ITV announced that &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot; would return to the channel for a 45-minute Christmas special, which was filmed in Malta. The episode aired on 24 December 2016.

Another Christmas special aired on 18 December 2017. In June 2018 Lesley Joseph revealed that ITV were discussing plans for another series in October 2019 to mark the show&#x27;s 30th anniversary. However, Joseph said she did not yet wish to take part, owing to other work commitments. Confusion occurred in February 2019 when Nigel Lythgoe seemed to suggest the series had ended. An ITV representative later confirmed this story was false, the show had not been &#x27;axed&#x27; and a Christmas special would air in December 2020.

A further Christmas special was broadcast on 24 December 2020 on ITV. The episode featured Linda Robson, Lesley Joseph and Les Dennis with a storyline inspired by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This was the first episode in the show&#x27;s history which did not feature Pauline Quirke.

On 16 May 2021, ITV announced that there were no plans for further episodes and it would not be commissioned for another series. However in June 2022 Linda Robson stated that a further reunion special had been discussed with Pauline Quirke and that it was up to ITV to make a decision.

===Opening titles===
The theme tune was Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;ll I Do?&quot;. Initially the version recorded by actor William Atherton for the 1974 film &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; was used; from the third series onwards it is sung by Quirke and Robson.

====Series 1====
During the opening theme for series 1, Quirke and Robson were seen both dressed in a white shirt and a black skirt and they walked towards to screen through several spotlights. Once they reached the screen it faded to Quirke and Robson sat back to back as they rotated.
The ending theme was an extended version sung by Quirke and Robson together. And it showed Quirke and Robson walking to the screen and back, passing through the spot lights, while the credits rolled on the left of the screen.

====Series 2====
Series 2 featured the same music as series 1 but introduced the new opening which featured pictures of characters Sharon and Tracey as they grow up.
# Sharon and Tracey as babies, could be toddlers.
# As young children (this stage of their lives is featured in the closing theme)
# As children, grown up
# As teenagers, from this picture onwards, it is actually Quirke and Robson that featured in the pictures.
# As young adults
# As adults on Tracey&#x27;s wedding day. From this picture onwards, the pictures are in colour.
# As adults on Sharon&#x27;s wedding day.
# As adults, now as they appear in the series.

For the picture transition, the pictures faded. The last picture remained until the entire screen faded into the episode.

For the closing theme, A video was of the child actors that are supposed to be a young Sharon and Tracey, in the second picture of the opening theme, out in a park eating ice creams with their teddies, chasing each other, Tracey trying to get Sharon to play, Sharon jumping down some steps, Tracey looking through a railing to a pond and it ends with Sharon and Tracey waving bye and running away from the screen together.

====Series 3–9====
Series 3 introduced a revised version of the song which was performed by Quirke and Robson. In the opening theme, Robson sang the first verse and Quirke sang the last; this was the opposite way round in the closing theme. It used the same video as the series 2 opening and closing theme.

The episode closing theme was an extended version of the song. Quirke and Robson sang separate verses before singing the last line together: &quot;That won&#x27;t come true, what&#x27;ll I do?&quot;.

====Series 10 – 2017 Christmas Special====
A new arrangement of the theme by Dave Arch accompanies a new title sequence using a number of the images used in the previous series titles as well as a current image of the sisters and Dorien – now styled to be pictures in frames, slides and images through a camera&#x27;s view screen. The video sequence from the original closing credits now appears in the opening sequence alongside a clip from an old episode made to look like a home video recording. More of the old end credits video appears as the programme moves in and out of the commercial break. It was confirmed prior to broadcast in an online interview with Whatsontv that the opening titles have been slightly updated with new images and with Joseph now singing in the opening titles alongside Quirke and Robson.

====2020 Christmas Special====
The previous arrangement of the theme tune is used, but since Quirke did not appear in this episode, only Robson&#x27;s lines are sung, resulting in a truncated version of the theme tune. The titles do not feature the images of Sharon and Tracey, instead a dark blue background shows the programme title and the writers, with credits for Linda Robson and Lesley Joseph only. The old video of Sharon and Tracey does not appear when the programme moves in and out of the commercial break.

==International broadcast and adaptations==
&quot;Birds of a Feather&quot; was sold to more than 30 countries worldwide and the format was sold to countries including Australia (ABC TV), New Zealand, Spain and South Africa. The show is regularly re-run on Australian &amp; New Zealand pay TV.

===American adaptation===
An American adaptation, called &quot;Stand by Your Man&quot; was made by Fox. Rosie O&#x27;Donnell played hard-up Lorraine Popowski, while Melissa Gilbert-Brinkman played her rich sister Rochelle Dunphy. Sam McMurray played Rochelle&#x27;s husband Roger and Rick Hall played Lorraine&#x27;s husband Artie. The Dorien character, called Adrienne Stone, was played by Miriam Flynn. The series was broadcast for only eight episodes from 5 April to 9 August 1992.

===Stage adaptation===
On 8 July 2010, Linda Robson confirmed on &quot;This Morning&quot; that a script had been written for a stage show, which all three actresses were keen to be involved with, but this would depend on the availability of Pauline Quirke, who had just been contracted to &quot;Emmerdale&quot; for six months. Quirke announced on 16 May 2011 that she would be leaving &quot;Emmerdale&quot; at Christmas 2011 and that a touring version of &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot; would start in spring 2012.

&quot;Birds of a Feather&quot; has been adapted for stage by The Comedy Theatre Company, producers of previous &quot;dinnerladies&quot; and &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot; UK stage tours. The 2012 &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot; UK tour includes the original three leading actresses. Quirke and Robson&#x27;s real-life sons, Charlie Quirke and Louis Dunford, share the role of Travis Stubbs, the son born to Tracey in the final episode of the original BBC TV series.

<text>Jeffrey L. Smith (January 22, 1939 – July 7, 2004) was the author of several cookbooks and the host of &quot;The Frugal Gourmet&quot;, a popular American cooking show. The show began in Tacoma, Washington, as &quot;Cooking Fish Creatively&quot; on local PBS station KTPS (now KBTC-TV), where it aired from 1973 to 1977. It then moved to WTTW in Chicago, and finally to KQED in San Francisco where it aired from 1984 to 1997. From 1972 to 1983, Smith was the owner and operator of the Chaplain&#x27;s Pantry Restaurant and Gourmet Shop. 

==Early life==
Smith was born in Tacoma, Washington, on January 22, 1939. He graduated from the University of Puget Sound (UPS) in 1962. In 1965, he graduated from Drew University in New Jersey, which ordained him a minister in the United Methodist Church. In 1965, he became a chaplain at the University of Puget Sound. In 1966, Smith married his wife Patricia &quot;Patty&quot; Smith, and had two sons, Channing and Jason. Patricia is credited with originating the nickname &quot;Frugal Gourmet&quot;. Jeff Smith served as a chaplain at UPS from 1966 to 1972. In 1972, he left the university to open and run Chaplain&#x27;s Pantry Restaurant and Gourmet Shop, a deli and kitchen supply store in Tacoma, where Smith and his students also offered cooking classes to the public.

==Career==
Smith began his television career in 1973 at KTPS in Tacoma with a show called &quot;Cooking Fish Creatively&quot;, which ran from 1973 to 1977, and was then renamed &quot;The Frugal Gourmet&quot;. In 1983, Smith moved to WTTW in Chicago, which took &quot;The Frugal Gourmet&quot; national in 1984. In 1991, Smith moved &quot;The Frugal Gourmet&quot; to PBS station KQED in San Francisco. The show aired for 11 seasons, with a total of 261 episodes produced. 

Over the course of his career, Smith published numerous cookbooks, such as &quot;Recipes from the Frugal Gourmet&quot; (1977), &quot;The Frugal Gourmet&quot; (1984), &quot;The Frugal Gourmet Cooks With Wine&quot; (1986), &quot;The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American&quot; (1987), &quot;The Frugal Gourmet Cooks Three Ancient Cuisines&quot; (1989), &quot;The Frugal Gourmet on Our Immigrant Ancestors&quot; (1990), &quot;The Frugal Gourmet Celebrates Christmas&quot; (1991), &quot;The Frugal Gourmet&#x27;s Culinary Handbook&quot; (1991), &quot;The Frugal Gourmet Whole Family Cookbook&quot; (1992), &quot;The Frugal Gourmet Cooks Italian&quot; (1993), and &quot;The Frugal Gourmet Keeps the Feast&quot; (1995). 
Smith was regarded as a &quot;genius&quot; by some and as a &quot;tyrant&quot; by others. Kathy Casey, a &quot;Seattle Times&quot; food columnist and longtime friend of Smith&#x27;s, described him as a knowledgeable and generous man who &quot;...knew more about food and culture than anybody I know in the food world.&quot; She said he donated both money and time to charitable causes and helped individuals get started in the food industry, even after his retirement.

Smith also had his share of detractors. Irena Chalmers, a faculty member at the Culinary Institute of America and president of the International Association of Culinary Professionals, once described him as &quot;the Frugal Gourmet, who is neither&quot;. &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; food and wine columnist William Rice wrote, &quot;I&#x27;ve tried to cook his stuff, and let&#x27;s say it was hit or miss. Some things worked and others didn&#x27;t.&quot; &quot;Newsweek&quot; writer Laura Shapiro criticized him as &quot;a prime example of prominent cooks who may compromise their integrity by being paid to recommend food products and kitchen ware.&quot; She cited &quot;The Frugal Gourmet Whole Family Cookbook&quot; as &quot;especially shocking&quot;, calling it &quot;the cookbook as infomercial&quot;. In a 1992 &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; article, Barbara Grizzuti Harrison ridiculed him as &quot;a purveyor of patronizing poppycock ... conveyed with the kind of mock anger that is always a mask for real anger.&quot; Smith brushed aside such criticism: &quot;Not many people read &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;,&quot; he said. &quot;That&#x27;s a very small audience.&quot; He continued, &quot;People criticize me for enjoying good food when I use the word frugal. Frugal doesn&#x27;t mean cheap. It means you don&#x27;t waste your money. They haven&#x27;t read my books. They don&#x27;t know the meaning of the word.&quot;

==Sexual abuse allegations==
In 1997, seven men filed a civil lawsuit against Smith, charging him with sexual abuse. Six of them alleged that they were molested as teenagers in the 1970s while working at the Chaplain&#x27;s Pantry in Tacoma; the seventh claimed that he was assaulted in 1992, at age 14, after Smith picked him up as a hitchhiker. Smith denied the allegations, and no criminal charges were filed, but he and his insurers settled the cases for an undisclosed amount in 1998. The litigation ended his television career, though he continued his writing and charitable work.

==Personal life and death==
Smith and his wife Patricia (&quot;Patty&quot;) had two sons, Channing and Jason, whose wives were Yuki and Lisa. Smith died in his sleep of heart disease on July 7, 2004, at age 65.

<text>Zalman Tech Co. is a South Korean software engineering company manufacturing aftermarket desktop computer products focusing on cooling enhancement.

Zalman has done product development since its founding in January 1999 and now holds several patents primarily on both cooling and fan noise reduction. Zalman&#x27;s product range includes heat sink and fan solutions for CPUs, as well as quiet power supplies, computer water cooling systems, motherboard chipset coolers, graphics card heatsink and fan combos, laptop coolers, cases, and hard disk cases that lower temperature and reduce noise.

Zalman&#x27;s primary competitors include Antec, Thermaltake, Spire, Cooler Master, and Arctic.

Zalman has also developed a fanless case. It uses a fin-based design to dissipate heat with heat-generating components like the graphics card and motherboard transferring heat to the case body via a system of heat pipes and radiators.

Zalman introduced the CNPS9500AM2, a heatsink meant specifically for socket AM2 compatibility on May 23, 2006. The company also broke into the headphone market with its 5.1 headphone system, ZM-RS6F/M.

==Monitors==
Zalman has also sold stereoscopic (three-dimensional) LCD monitors, which utilize +45°/+45° polarized 3D glasses. These products allow the user to play games and other 3D media in full 3D stereoscopy (but with a 50% drop in vertical resolution per frame since only every second line is visible to each eye). Its 3D driver requires the native vertical resolution.

==Financial issues==

On 30 October 2014, Zalman defaulted on a large loan amounting to over 3 billion won (approximately 3 million US dollars at time of default). Following this, the company applied for &quot;initiation of corporate turnaround process&quot; in an attempt to return itself to solvency. Tom&#x27;s Hardware later reported that Zalman&#x27;s financial difficulties were the result of fraud from Zalman&#x27;s parent company, Moneual; Zalman restructured and was forced to lay off 2/3 of its workforce, but was beginning to recover by the end of 2015.

<doc id="668477" wikidata="Q5044694" url="?curid=668477" title="Carole Keeton Strayhorn">
<text>Carole Stewart Keeton (born September 13, 1939), formerly known as Carole Keeton McClellan, Carole Keeton Rylander and Carole Keeton Strayhorn, is an American politician and the former Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts.

Elected to the comptroller&#x27;s post in 1998 as a Republican, Keeton ran as an independent candidate for Texas governor against Republican incumbent Rick Perry in 2006. She lost the November general election to Perry and placed third in a six-way race, with 18 percent.

Keeton is notable for several firsts in Austin and Texas politics. She is the first and so far only woman elected as mayor of Austin and the first Austin mayor elected to three consecutive terms. She was the first woman elected to the Texas Railroad Commission and the first woman elected as comptroller. She also was the first woman to serve as president of the Austin school board and as president of the Austin Community College board.

In May 2009, Keeton lost her campaign for Mayor of Austin.

==Family==
Keeton was born Carole Stewart Keeton in Austin, the second child and only daughter of Madge Anna (Stewart) and W. Page Keeton, a lawyer and university dean. She attended the University of Texas at Austin, where she was a member of the Orange Jackets, a women&#x27;s honorary service organization. Her father was the longtime dean of the University of Texas Law School.

Keeton&#x27;s first marriage was to attorney Barr McClellan, whom she divorced during her first term as mayor. The marriage produced four sons, Scott, Mark, Brad and Dudley McClellan. Upon her subsequent remarriage, she took the last name of her new husband, accordingly elected as comptroller under the name Carole Keeton Rylander. She married Ed Strayhorn in 2003, continuing her career as Carole Keeton Strayhorn. She resumed her maiden name by 2014, after her third marriage ended in divorce.

==Early political career==
As Carole Keeton McClellan, she served on the board of trustees of the Austin Independent School District (which doubled as the Board of Trustees of Austin Community College) from 1972 to 1977. She served as president of both boards from 1976 to 1977. She was elected mayor of Austin in 1977 and held that post until 1983. In 1983, Governor Mark White appointed Rylander to the State Board of Insurance, where she served until resigning in 1986 to unsuccessfully challenge veteran Democratic congressman, J. J. Pickle of Austin, a longtime friend and political ally of Lyndon B. Johnson.

As Carole Keeton Rylander, she won election to the Texas Railroad Commission in 1994 by beating Democratic incumbent Mary Scott Nabers, an Ann W. Richards appointee, by almost 300,000 votes. The panel primarily regulates the production of oil and natural gas, and despite its name, no longer has authority over railroads. She served as commission chairman from November 1995 to January 1997, and from June 1998 to January 1999.

==Comptroller==
In 1998, Keeton entered the open race to succeed outgoing Democratic Comptroller John Sharp of Victoria, who was seeking the lieutenant governorship. Facing off against Democratic political scion Paul Hobby, the son of a former lieutenant governor, Keeton won by some 20,000 votes out of roughly 3.6 million votes cast.

Reelected in 2002, she led the statewide Republican ticket in terms of raw votes. As Carole Keeton Rylander, she drew more than one million votes more in 2002 than she had four years earlier and outpolled fellow Republican Rick Perry by some 246,000 votes even while Perry was easily dispatching Democrat Tony Sanchez of Laredo in the governor&#x27;s race.

The tax status of Ethical Societies as religious organizations has been upheld in court cases in Washington, D.C. (1957), and in Austin, Texas (2003). The Texas State Appeals Court said of the challenge by then state comptroller Keeton, &quot;the Comptroller&#x27;s test [requiring a group to demonstrate its belief in a Supreme Being] fails to include the whole range of belief systems that may, in our diverse and pluralistic society, merit the First Amendment&#x27;s protection.&quot;

In 2004, Keeton revoked the tax exempt status of the Unitarian Universalist Church in Denison, Texas by claiming that the church is not a religion. This move was done because of the policies of the church&#x27;s parent body, the Unitarian Universalist Association, which has no single set of religious teachings. The comptroller&#x27;s office reversed its decision after the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; reported the incident. This was the only occasion when any state attempted to deny the church&#x27;s tax exemption.

==Gubernatorial campaign==

Soon after the 2002 election, Keeton began publicly feuding with Governor Perry over what she saw as his inability to provide leadership on issues such as school finance and government spending.

On May 9, 2006, Keeton turned in 223,000 voter signatures to the office of Texas Secretary of State Roger Williams. Only 45,540 were required to place her on the November general election ballot. &quot;I told you, Texas,&quot; Keeton said while standing in front of 101 boxes stuffed with signatures. &quot;We have blown the barn doors off this petition drive.&quot; Media reports later confirmed that the boxes were substantially less than half full (for comparison, her opponent, Kinky Friedman put 169,000 signatures in 11 similar boxes). On June 22, 2006, Texas Secretary of State Roger B. Williams declared that only 108,512 signatures on her petition were valid, about 35,000 less than Friedman&#x27;s count.

Keeton tried to have herself listed on the gubernatorial ballot as &quot;Carole Keeton &#x27;Grandma&#x27; Strayhorn&quot;, claiming that &quot;Grandma&quot; was a common nickname for her, and that independent opponent Kinky Friedman was able to use &quot;Kinky&quot; on the ballot (although he was listed as &quot;Richard &#x27;Kinky&#x27; Friedman&quot;). Secretary of State Williams ruled that Keeton&#x27;s &quot;nickname&quot; was a slogan she used during her campaign for state comptroller (One Tough Grandma). Friedman, on the other hand, had used &quot;Kinky&quot; as a professional name on his albums and novels, and had been known by that name for at least 40 years.

During the Texas Governor&#x27;s debate, Keeton suffered image points when she could not name the president-elect of Mexico, Felipe Calderón, during a rapid-answer segment of the debate. In a format similar to a TV game show, the candidates had 15 seconds to answer questions. She stated that the election had been hotly contested.

==Partisan affiliations==
In her campaigns for school board and mayor, Keeton was not identified by partisan affiliation since those posts are elected on a nonpartisan basis. Keeton was a Democrat until the mid-1980s; she served as Democratic nominee Walter Mondale&#x27;s campaign chair in Travis County during the 1984 presidential election. Keeton switched parties and became a Republican in 1986, when she was the GOP nominee for the U.S. House seat held by J. J. Pickle. She was elected Railroad Commissioner and then Comptroller as a Republican and ran for Governor in 2006 as an independent. In 2014, she returned to the Democratic party nearly 30 years after leaving it.

<doc id="668487" wikidata="Q1542163" url="?curid=668487" title="Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Album">
<text>The Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Album is an honor presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, to recording artists for quality works on albums in the R&amp;B music genre. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by The Recording Academy of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

According to the category description guide for the 54th Grammy Awards, the award is reserved for albums &quot;containing at least 51% playing time of newly recorded contemporary R&amp;B vocal tracks&quot; which may also &quot;incorporate production elements found in rap music&quot;. 

From 2003 to 2011, a separate category was formed, the Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album, meant for R&amp;B albums that had modern hip-hop stylings to them, while more traditional and less electronic-styled R&amp;B music still fell under the Best R&amp;B Album category. After the 2011 Grammy season, the Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album category was discontinued and recordings that previously fell under this category were shifted back to the Best R&amp;B Album category. This was part of a major overhaul of the Grammy Award categories. In 2013, a sister category titled Best Progressive R&amp;B Album, then titled Best Urban Contemporary Album was debuted.

The award goes to the artist, producer and engineer/mixer, provided they are credited with at least 50% of playing time on the album. (The lead performing artist is the only one who receives the official nomination). A producer or engineer who are responsible for &quot;less&quot; than 50% of playing time, as well as the mastering engineer, can apply for a Winners Certificate. Before 2001, only the performing artist received a nomination and/or an award.

Alicia Keys and John Legend are the biggest recipients in this category with three wins. TLC, D&#x27;Angelo, Robert Glasper, and Chris Brown have won the award twice. Mary J. Blige holds the record for the most nominations, with six in total. In 2015, Norwegian singer Bern/hoft became the first non-American artist to be nominated.

<doc id="668493" wikidata="Q516133" url="?curid=668493" title="Cayman Brac">
<text>Cayman Brac is an island that is part of the Cayman Islands. It lies in the Caribbean Sea about north-east of Grand Cayman and east of Little Cayman. It is about long, with an average width of . Its terrain is the most prominent of the three Cayman Islands due to &quot;The Bluff&quot;, a limestone outcrop that rises steadily along the length of the island up to above sea level at the eastern end. The island is named after this prominent feature, as &quot;brac&quot; is a Gaelic name for a bluff.

==History==

Christopher Columbus sighted Cayman Brac and its sister island, Little Cayman, on 10 May 1503 when his ship was blown off course during a trip between Hispaniola and Panama. He named them &quot;Las Tortugas&quot; because of the many turtles he spotted on the islands. The Cayman Islands were renamed by Sir Francis Drake, who came upon the islands during a voyage in 1586. He used the word &quot;Caymanas&quot;, taken from the Carib name for crocodiles after seeing many of the large crocodilians. Many people believe he had only seen the rock iguanas that inhabit the island today.

During the heyday of piracy, pirates would use Cayman Brac as a haven and a place to replenish their supplies as there are a number of fresh water wells on the island and had many sources of food included in the local flora and fauna.

==Attractions==

Diving:

Of interest to scuba divers is a Russian Koni class frigate built in the Soviet Union in 1984 for the Cuban Navy. It is one of only a few sunken Soviet naval vessels in the Western Hemisphere, and the only one that is easily dived. The Koni II class frigate was purchased and sunk by the Cayman Islands government in September 1996. Originally designated &quot;356&quot;, the frigate was rechristened the &quot;M/V Captain Keith Tibbetts&quot;, after a well-known Cayman Brac politician. The wreck is the only Russian warship that divers can explore in the Western hemisphere. It originally sat upright at a depth of with the deck at , until wave action generated by a winter Norwester storm (December 1998 – January 1999) which nearly tore the ship in two. The result was that the fore section tipped to about a 45-degree angle in relation to the remainder of the still-upright aft portion. and the midships became a debris field. The wreck&#x27;s stern area was essentially unaffected. The frigate is located in a sandy area with generally good visibility, offshore (a fairly long swim) from &#x27;Buccaneer&#x27;, on the island&#x27;s north side, near the western tip of the island. There are numerous openings in the upper portion of the ship for non-wreck certified divers. Many more openings are available since the ship broke in half. The site also serves as an artificial reef. Other interesting dive sites are Radar Reef, Cemetery Wall, and the Wilderness Wall, all well covered in corals and with a wide diversity of marine life.

Caves:
Cayman Brac also appeals to visitors of many persuasions besides divers. Caves are found around the island, offering spelunkers a glimpse of delicate underground formations. Steps and, in some cases, ladders have been constructed to allow visitor access to more remote caves. One cave, Rebecca&#x27;s Cave, contains the grave of a young girl lost in a struggle against the ravages of the great 1932 Cuba hurricane, and it is a Cayman National Heritage Site.

Rock climbing:
Rock climbing was developed beginning in 1992 and the island now contains about 100 sport climbs. Trad and multipitch climbs are rare.

Walking and hiking trails:
Walking and hiking trails have been opened by the Nature Tourism Programme which allow exploration of the island&#x27;s densely forested karst landscapes. Unique flora and fauna thrive here and can be observed in the wild.

Fishing:
Cayman Brac&#x27;s waters are utilized for both recreational fishing and the pursuit of big game fish.


==Politics==

The politics of Cayman Brac are dominated by the liberal People’s Progressive Movement, who won every electoral district in both the Brac and Little Cayman.

==Local economy==

The local economy tends to be concentrated in three areas which are probably typical for many Caribbean locales: tourism, municipal government, and local enterprises. Although on the Brac, the government (including Cayman Airways, the national carrier) is the largest employer. Some of the more economically prominent families in Grand Cayman originate from Cayman Brac, namely the Kirkconnells, Fosters, Waltons, and Scotts. The majority of the tourism sector is concentrated on scuba diving, although this is in recent decline in the hospitality sector, with one of the two local hotels, Divi Resorts, having closed operations in 2006. The island&#x27;s economy was also adversely affected by significant damage from Category 4 Hurricane Paloma in November 2008.

A local enterprise that is nearly unique to Cayman Brac is its artists who work in a local stone known as caymanite, typically making jewellery or small stone carvings. Two of these artists have been Eddie Scott and Tenson Scott, whose works have won national contests, as well as being the official gift to Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip during the 1994 state visit. For the 2011 wedding of Prince William, the official Cayman Islands gift was crafted by Horacio Esteban, who grew up on Cayman Brac and is currently living on Grand Cayman.

==Current airline service==
Charles Kirkconnell International Airport (formerly known as Gerrard Smith International Airport) serves the island. All scheduled passenger flights are operated by Cayman Airways and subsidiary Cayman Airways Express with service to and from Grand Cayman being flown with Saab 340B regional turboprops and also small de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter turboprop aircraft with limited flights also being operated on this interisland route with Boeing 737 MAX 8 jetliners. In addition, Cayman Airways provides limited 737-8 jet service from Cayman Brac to Miami via a stop in Grand Cayman and also operates weekly nonstop 737-8 service southbound one way from Miami. According to the Cayman Airways flight schedule, the airline is also currently operating direct no change of plane 737-8 jet service every Saturday from Cayman Brac to Denver via a stop in Grand Cayman.

==Historical airline service==

In 1965, Cayman Brac Airways (CBA), a subsidiary of LACSA Airlines, was operating twice weekly round trip service flown with a Beech Model 18 twin prop aircraft on a routing of Grand Cayman - Little Cayman - Cayman Brac - Montego Bay. According to the airline&#x27;s 1 May 1965, timetable, connecting service to Miami via Grand Cayman was offered by LACSA, an airline based in Costa Rica, while additional connecting service to Miami as well as to New York City was offered by Pan Am via Montego Bay. In 1968, the government of the Cayman Islands purchased a controlling interest in Cayman Brac Airways from LACSA and then formed Cayman Airways which has served the airport since that time.

==Education==

The Cayman Islands Education Department operates two primary schools and one secondary school on the island. These include:

*Creek &amp; Spot Bay Primary School (Infant school and Junior School)
*West End Primary School
*Layman E. Scott Sr. High School

<doc id="668496" wikidata="Q5331047" url="?curid=668496" title="East–West Shrine Bowl">
<text>The East–West Shrine Bowl is a postseason college football all-star game that has been played annually since 1925; through January 2019, it was known as the East–West Shrine Game. The game is sponsored by the fraternal group Shriners International, and the net proceeds are earmarked to some of the Shrine&#x27;s charitable works, most notably the Shriners Hospitals for Children. The game&#x27;s slogan is &quot;Strong Legs Run That Weak Legs May Walk.&quot;

Teams consist of players from colleges across the country, and players may be college seniors or college underclassmen who have declared for the NFL Draft who are eligible to play for their schools. The game and the practice sessions leading up to it attract dozens of scouts from professional teams. Since 1985, Canadian players playing in Canadian university football have also been invited (even though U Sports and the NCAA play by different football codes). As such, this is the only current bowl or all-star game in either the Canadian or American college football schedules to include players from both Canadian and American universities.

The game has been played in various locations. Most editions have been held in California, although the most recent edition played there was in 2005. The game has been played in Texas since the February 2024 edition. Since 1979, the game has been played in January or February, and has been played on January 10 or later since 1986. The later game dates allow players from teams whose schools were involved in bowl games to participate.

== History ==

=== 20th century ===
For most of its history, the game was played in the San Francisco Bay Area, usually at San Francisco&#x27;s Kezar Stadium or Stanford Stadium at Stanford University, with Pacific Bell Park/SBC Park (now Oracle Park) as a host in its final years in Northern California. For more than half of the games played in the Bay Area, entertainment was provided by the marching band from Santa Cruz High School.

In January 1942, the game was played in New Orleans, due to the December 7, 1941, Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. This one-year relocation was based upon fears that playing the game on the West Coast could make the contest and the stadium a potential target for an additional attack. The game, originally planned for January 1 in San Francisco, was played on January 3 at Tulane Stadium, two days after the 1942 Sugar Bowl was held there.

During this era, the game was not restricted to college seniors—for example, the January 1944 edition of the game featured Robert Hoernschemeyer, Dean Sensanbaugher, and Herman Wedemeyer, each then college freshmen.

A similar all-star game, the North–South Shrine Game, was played in Miami from 1948 to 1973, and a final time in Pontiac, Michigan, in 1976.

=== 21st century ===
In 2006, the game moved to Texas, leaving the San Francisco Bay area for the first time since 1942, and was played at the Alamodome in San Antonio. In 2007, the game relocated to Houston and was played at Reliant Stadium, home of the NFL&#x27;s Houston Texans, to be closer to one of the 22 Shriners Hospitals for Children; Texas has two Shriner&#x27;s hospitals, one in Houston and the other in Galveston. The 2008 and 2009 games were held at Robertson Stadium on the campus of the University of Houston.

In 2010, the game moved to Florida, and was held at the Citrus Bowl in Orlando. Television coverage moved from ESPN/ESPN2 to the NFL Network, starting with the 2011 game. After two years in Orlando, the 2012 game was held at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg; it was the sixth different venue (in five cities and three states) in a span of eight contests.

Starting with the January 2017 game, the NFL supplies coaching staffs for the game, drawing from assistant coaches of teams who did not advance to the NFL postseason, and the game is now officiated by NFL officials. The game is played under NFL rules, with some restrictions, such as no motion or shifts by the offense, and no stunts or blitzes by the defense. Prior to the January 2020 playing, organizers renamed the game from East–West Shrine Game to East–West Shrine Bowl.

The 2021 edition of the game, which had been scheduled for January 23, was cancelled due to concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In July 2021, it was announced that Allegiant Stadium would host the East–West Shrine Bowl on February 3, 2022; the game was scheduled as part of festivities for the 2022 Pro Bowl being held there the following Sunday.

In June 2023, organizers announced that the game would move to Ford Center at The Star in Frisco, Texas, for its 2024 playing.

==Game results==
Through the January 2025 game (100 editions, 99 games played), the West leads all-time with 54 wins to the East&#x27;s 40 wins, while 5 games have tied.



 For the December 1925 game, NCAA records list a 7–0 final score, while contemporary newspaper accounts report 6–0.

==MVPs==
The game first named a Most Valuable Player for the January 1945 playing (Bob Waterfield, UCLA quarterback), and named a single MVP through the December 1952 game. Starting with the January 1954 game, two MVPs are selected for each game; they receive the William H. Coffman Award for Most Outstanding Offensive Player, and the E. Jack Spaulding Award for Most Outstanding Defensive Player. Coffman was managing director of the game for 40 years, while Spaulding was one of the organizers of the inaugural playing of the game. MVPs starting with the January 2000 game are listed below; a complete list is provided on the official website.

Although the game is an American football competition, players of Canadian university football, contested under Canadian football rules, have been invited to each game played since 1985, when Calgary Dinos offensive lineman Tom Spoletini played. Usually, Canadian players on the West team come from Canada West schools, while Canadian players on the East team are from the other three Canadian conferences (Ontario University Athletics, Atlantic University Sport, and Quebec Student Sport Federation). One exception was Sean McEwen of the Calgary Dinos (a Canada West school), who played on the East squad in the 2016 game. The only Canadian team that competed under American football rules is the now-defunct Simon Fraser Red Leafs; the only Simon Fraser player to be invited to the game is Ibrahim Khan, who played in 2004 when Simon Fraser still played Canadian football.

Through the 2025 game, the Calgary Dinos have had the most invitees, with 13. 

In 2024, the lone Canadian invitee was Qwan&#x27;tez Stiggers, an American who did not play college football but instead became a professional player for the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League.

==Hall of fame==
A hall of fame was established in 2002, with additional inductees typically named in the weeks leading up to each annual playing. Through 2024 inductees, there are currently 64 members of the hall of fame.

Inductees range from having played in game No. 10 (January 1935) to game No. 78 (January 2003), with game No. 48 (December 1972) having the most players honored, five.

==Pat Tillman Award==
Game organizers initiated a Pat Tillman Award in 2005, the year that Tillman was posthumously inducted to the game&#x27;s hall of fame, to recognize &quot;a player who best exemplifies character, intelligence, sportsmanship and service.&quot;

==Head coaches who played in the game==
Several Shrine Bowl players have gone on to serve as a head coach in a later Shrine Bowl.

<doc id="668505" wikidata="Q162235" url="?curid=668505" title="Bone (comics)">
<text>Bone is an American fantasy comic book limited series written and illustrated by Jeff Smith, originally serialized in 55 irregularly released issues from 1991 to 2004. The series is primarily self-published by Smith&#x27;s Cartoon Books; it was also briefly published by Image Comics. The issues were collected into nine volumes, as well as a single omnibus volume. From 2005 to 2009, color editions of the original volumes were published by Scholastic&#x27;s Graphix imprint. The series intertwines comedy and dark fantasy.

&quot;Bone&quot; has received numerous awards, among them ten Eisner Awards and eleven Harvey Awards.

==Plot==
&quot;Bone&quot; follows the eponymous Bone cousins, who appear as white-skinned cartoon humanoids: everyman Fone Bone, wealthy and self-serving Phoncible P. &quot;Phoney&quot; Bone, and simpleminded Smiley Bone. When Phoney mounts an ill-fated campaign for mayor, he is forced out of their hometown of Boneville, with Smiley and a reluctant Fone Bone following him. After the cousins find themselves in a desert, Smiley finds a hand-drawn map that they use to navigate their way across the fantasy landscape. The cousins are separated by a swarm of locusts and individually end up in a mysterious valley, a journey made more difficult by the pursuing Rat Creatures. Eventually, they reunite at the Barrelhaven tavern, where they are taken in by a mysterious girl named Thorn and her grandmother, &quot;Gran&#x27;ma Ben&quot;. Fone Bone instantly develops a crush on Thorn and repeatedly attempts to express his love through poetry. As they stay longer in the Valley, they learn that it is under threat from the Rat Creatures, led by Kingdok; and the Lord of the Locusts. The Bones are gradually drawn into the events around them, compelling them on a hero&#x27;s journey to help free the Valley.

==Analysis==
&quot;Bone&quot; has been noted for &quot;defying&quot; categorization. Smith claims that the series was not originally written for an adolescent audience, though adolescents comprise its largest readership. Throughout its run, &quot;Bone&quot; shifts from a largely comical series to a more serious tone as the characters and setting develop. It is additionally said to have a &quot;darker subtext about power and evil&quot;.

Smith made the decision to illustrate &quot;Bone&quot; in black-and-white, which critics speculate is so that he could maintain the clear lines that allow for exaggerated characters that contrast their subtle, detailed backgrounds.

The series is mainly set in the Valley, though Boneville is mentioned throughout. Boneville is never actually shown, but is implied to be technologically contemporary, while the Valley is depicted as medieval, inasmuch as its citizens employ a barter system, weapons, and modes of transportation similar to those of the Middle Ages, and Phoney persistently refers to the people of the Valley as &quot;yokels&quot;.

==Background==

Smith originated &quot;Bone&quot; as a sketch he drew as a child, resembling a telephone handset receiver. This original drawing, a frowning character with its mouth wide open, resembled characteristics of who would become the Bone cousins. When Smith was ten, he began creating comics featuring the characters.

The comics had many major influences throughout their creation. Smith mostly modeled &quot;Bone&quot; structurally around Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;. He enjoyed how it &quot;start(s) off very simple, almost like children&#x27;s stories ... but as it goes on, it gets a little darker, and the themes become a little more sophisticated and more complex&quot;. Smith was also inspired by Carl Barks&#x27; character Scrooge McDuck. Smith said that he &quot;always wanted Uncle Scrooge to go on a longer adventure. I thought, &#x27;Man, if you could just get a comic book of that quality, the length of say, &quot;War and Peace&quot;, or &quot;The Odyssey&quot; or something, that would be something I would love to read, and even as a kid I looked everywhere for that book, that Uncle Scrooge story that was 1,100 pages long&quot;.

Other influences in this regard include the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy, J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and the classic fairy tales and mythologies that inspired those works. &quot;Moby Dick&quot;, Smith&#x27;s favorite book, is cited for its multi-layered narrative and symbolism, and numerous references to it are placed throughout &quot;Bone&quot;. &quot;Bone&quot; was also influenced by other comics, including Charles Schulz&#x27;s &quot;Peanuts&quot; and Walt Kelly&#x27;s &quot;Pogo&quot;.

While Smith attended the Ohio State University, he created a comic strip titled &quot;Thorn&quot; for the student newspaper, &quot;The Lantern&quot;, which included some of the characters who later featured in &quot;Bone&quot;.

After college, Smith and his friends produced animation work on commission in their studio, Character Builders Inc., but Smith eventually decided against an animation career. Seeking instead to develop a comic book series, and convinced by the successes of Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; and Art Spiegelman&#x27;s &quot;Maus&quot; that a serious comic book with a beginning, middle and end structure was both artistically and commercially viable, Smith decided to produce &quot;Bone&quot;.

In 1991, Smith launched his company, Cartoon Books, to publish the series. Initially, Smith self-published the series, doing all of the work to produce and distribute the series through his business himself; this made it difficult for Smith to focus on writing and drawing the book, and as a result, he fell behind in his production. To solve this, he asked his wife, Vijaya Iyer, to resign from her job at a Silicon Valley startup company and serve as president of Cartoon Books, managing the business related to the series. Smith was able to refocus on his work on &quot;Bone&quot;, and sales improved. In 1995, Smith began briefly publishing &quot;Bone&quot; through Image Comics. Smith believed this would be a temporary arrangement, and to maintain the book&#x27;s place in catalogs, the collected volumes remained under the Cartoon Books label. &quot;Bone&quot; ended with its 55th issue, dated June 2004. The back cover has, in place of the usual comic panel, a black-and-white photo of Smith in his studio drawing the last page on May 10. In an interview on &quot;Attack of the Show&quot;, Smith revealed that he drew the last page before working on the first issue.

==Publication history==
===Individual volumes===
The series was initially collected, 6 issues at a time, in three volumes of &quot;The Collected Bone Adventures&quot; (1993-1995). These went out of print when Smith decided to collect the story arc acts instead. &quot;The Bone Reader&quot; (1996) was released concurrent with the switch to Image Comics to bring new readers up to speed and to collect issues #13 1/2 and 19 for early adopters.

Other books published in the color series but not part of the main storyline are the prequel &quot;Rose&quot;, illustrated by Charles Vess; the &quot;Bone Handbook&quot;; and the anthology books &quot;Tall Tales&quot; and &quot;More Tall Tales&quot;.

Selected excerpts from &quot;Bone&quot; were reprinted in &quot;Disney Adventures&quot;, first in 1994 and later in 1997 through 1998. The issues usually consisted of 7–9 pages a month and were colored. The pages were also censored to remove smoking and drinking references and any innuendo involving Thorn and Fone Bone. There was also an exclusive story for &quot;Disney Adventures&quot; by Smith, featuring Fone and Phoney following a &quot;treasure map&quot;; it was reprinted in &quot;The Bone Reader&quot; and &quot;Tall Tales&quot;.

The series was split into three-story arcs, each having two names, one being the original arc name, the other being the name used in the one volume edition, respectively as follows. The first arc lasted from issues #1–19 (volumes #1–3, June 1991 – August 1995) being named Vernal Equinox, or The Valley. It was the longest running arc (in terms of time) running for four years and one month. The main story in issue #13.5, &quot;Up on the Roof&quot;, was reprinted as chapter six in &quot;The Great Cow Race&quot; collected edition, therefore making it part of &quot;Vernal Equinox&quot;. The second arc was named Solstice, or Phoney Strikes Back. The arc lasted from issues #20–37 (volumes #4–6, October 1995 – August 1999). It is tied as the longest running arc in issues with the third arc (lasting 19 issues). The third arc, Harvest or Friends &amp; Enemies, lasted from issues #38–55 (volumes #7–9, August 2000 – June 2004).

===Color editions===
In 2005, Scholastic, under its newly established Graphix imprint, began reissuing the nine individual volumes in full color by Steve Hamaker. In 2006, HarperCollins began publishing the full color editions for the UK market.

===Omnibus edition===

An omnibus edition, compiling all 55 issues in one volume (), was released originally by Cartoon Books imprint in a paperback volume. This release was intended to celebrate both the end of the series and the release of the full-color editions. First released in 2004 and promoted as only a limited print run being available, this edition has been reprinted several times since.

In addition to the paperback release, a signed limited edition hardcover release was issued. The deluxe hardcover featured gold embossed lettering on the cover, gilded edges, and a cloth ribbon bookmark. The end pages are printed with a map of The Valley and it comes with a full-color signed and numbered bookplate. This release originally sold for around $125 (USD) and was initially limited to 2,000 copies. The series has been reprinted 13 times, also featuring a signed limited edition of the 13th pressing version sold during November 2009.

The collection won the 2005 Eisner Award for Best Graphic Album-Reprint, and was listed at No. 3 in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Best Comix of 2004&quot;. Reviewer Andrew Arnold said of the collection, which was published at the conclusion of the monthly series: &quot;As sweeping as the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; cycle, but much funnier ... Smith imbues even simple dialogue panels with animation. Now that it&#x27;s finished &quot;Bone&quot; should join the ranks of &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter&quot; in the young adult pantheon&quot;.

===Full-color omnibus edition===
In November 2011, for its 20th anniversary, a full-color, omnibus edition was released. It has a special section in the back with a cover gallery of the original comics, an illustrated timeline of &quot;Bone&quot;&#x27;s 20-year history, and an essay by author Smith. A special edition was also released that included the book, a signed print by Jeff Smith, a Phoney Bone gold coin, three pewter bone figures of Fone Bone, Phoney Bone and Smiley Bone, a copy of &quot;The Cartoonist&quot; documentary DVD, and a miniature facsimile of the first issue, all held in a box decorated with an illustration of Fone Bone.

* Thorn: Tales from the Lantern: This comic strip was produced by Smith during college, featuring Thorn as the protagonist and Fone Bone and Phoney Bone as supporting characters. The strip was partially collected in a trade paperback after Smith graduated in 1989. It sold 1000 copies, and is currently out of print. A new, complete collection will be published in 2024, following a successful Kickstarter campaign.
* Rose (with Charles Vess): tells the origins of Rose, Thorn, and Lucius.

* Bone: Tall Tales: The story shows Smiley and Bartleby after the events in the main series. It features them telling tall tales to three Bone brothers (Ringo, Bingo and Todd). It is a repackaging of &quot;Stupid, Stupid Rat Tails&quot;, including a &quot;Disney Adventures&quot; short and new material. It was released on August 1, 2010. This spin-off mainly focuses on Big Johnson Bone&#x27;s (ancestor to the Bone cousins) adventures, some time before the cousins&#x27; adventures in the Valley, though there is one short where Fone and Phoney follow a &#x27;treasure map&#x27;, which is later revealed as a joke by Thorn, who wanted the two to do the laundry. One story with Big Johnson Bone depicts his discovery of the Valley with his monkey, Mr. Pip. In &quot;Bone&quot; Vol. 7, &quot;Ghost Circles&quot;, Bartleby mentions that before Rat Creatures had &quot;long, beautiful, hairless tails&quot;, which have to be cut off when the Rat Creature reaches one year of age, out of fear that they will be dragged away by their tails by a monster named Jekk. In &quot;Tall Tales&quot;, the Jekk is revealed to be Big Johnson Bone, who swung them around by their tails when they attacked him, and due to this (and the fact the Queen and her son had their tails removed by Big Johnson) they decided to cut their tails so they could never be used against them again. In this, the Royal Rat Creatures grow to be quite large, possibly explaining Kingdok, the Rat Creature ruler, to be of such great size comparatively to the other Rat Creatures. The Red Dragon also appears in the story.

The story continues from Part 1, putting the main characters against the Nacht, a dark creature that puts nearly everyone in the Valley to sleep. &quot;Part III&quot; was released on February 1, 2013.

* Fone Bone: The hero of the series, Fone Bone is the most courageous of the Bones but also the youngest. He and his cousin Smiley Bone help their other cousin Phoney Bone escape from Boneville after he upset the villagers, and get stuck in the Valley. He is passionate about his favorite book, &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, and is the most level-headed and the smartest of the three Bone cousins. He has an unrequited crush on Thorn Harvestar. Fone Bone is very wary of his cousin Phoney&#x27;s schemes, and always suspects him of something. The suspicion usually turns out right, and Fone is often angered by Phoney not seeming to care about the Valley (or the people in it), as Phoney constantly tries to leave to return to Boneville. After the Hooded One realizes Phoney Bone is not the person she needs to complete her ritual to revive Mim, the queen of the dragons, and realizes that Thorn is too powerful for her to control, she then seeks Fone, for in &quot;Ghost Circles&quot;, Vol. 7 of the series, it is revealed that Fone has the Locust inside him too, which likely came from either his encounter in &quot;Rock Jaw, Master of the Eastern Border&quot;, when he is knocked off a cliff, or in &quot;Old Man&#x27;s Cave&quot;, when he rescues Thorn from the locusts by putting the Dragon Necklace on her. It is later taken out in &quot;Ghost Circles&quot; by Thorn, who takes it herself, because she was told to by her dead mother in a Ghost Circle. Fone remains unaware of this until Crown of Horns, when they try to destroy the locust by touching the sacred Crown of Horns. He saves the day by touching the Crown of Horns while holding Thorn&#x27;s hand, who is incapacitated on the ground, stuck in Kingdok&#x27;s jaws, whom she killed. There they are given a choice to live or die (there is a bright light, supposedly the afterlife/heaven); both choose &#x27;live&#x27;. Thorn and Fone are both given pieces of the Crown of Horns as teeth which were knocked out in a fight with Tarsil&#x27;s followers. The teeth apparently cause rapid healing of their injuries. His name is derived from Fonebone, the recurring surname that Don Martin gave to many of the characters that appeared in his &quot;Mad&quot; magazine strips. &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine ranked Fone Bone as the 28th-greatest comic book character of all time. &quot;IGN&quot; also ranked Fone Bone as the 60th-greatest comic book hero of all time, stating that &quot;his good nature and his unrequited love for his ally Thorn make Fone the heart and soul of this fantastical book.&quot;
* Phoncible P. &quot;Phoney&quot; Bone: Manipulative and greedy, Phoney Bone is the eldest and least courageous of the Bones and he will do anything to get rich. Run out of Boneville by an angry mob of villagers after trying to run for mayor of Boneville, his greediness and selfishness make an enemy of anyone who crosses him in the Valley. Referred to by the Hooded One as &quot;The One Who Bears The Star&quot; (due to the star on the T-shirt he wears), Phoney is sought after by the Rat Creature army though he does not know why (later it is revealed that the Hooded One erroneously believed a giant balloon of Phoney used in his campaign for mayor of Boneville that fell in her lair to be an omen that Phoney could be used to fulfill her agenda, as the balloon, which originally featured the words “Phoney Bone will get your vote” and became “Phoney Bone will get you”.). Though he is selfish, he is very protective of his cousins when he needs to be and shows he really cares about them. For example, when he is approached by The Hooded One who proceeds to threaten Fone Bone, Phoncible becomes angry and warns The Hooded One to stay away from Fone. A monologue he delivers late in the series reveals that his greed and selfishness are the result of his having been forced to raise Fone and Smiley after they were orphaned, forcing him to resort to dirty schemes to provide for them. At the end of the series he finally displays a courageous side, as he fought the Pawans and the Rat Creatures along with Grand&#x27;ma Ben and her army, and he appeared to retreat from the final battle only to return with armed reinforcements; though they arrive too late he still claims to be a hero.
* Smiley Bone: The tallest of the Bones, the middle cousin and arguably the least intelligent, he plays a one-string instrument resembling a lute (but variously referred to throughout the series as a &quot;banjo&quot; or &quot;guitar&quot;). Smiley is often seen smoking a cigar, and often irritates characters with his simple-mindedness, even when seeking to help people, as when Lucius refers to Smiley&#x27;s help as &quot;torture” in The Great Cow Race. He takes kindly to a Rat Creature cub, whom he names Bartleby, and through his nurturing of Bartleby, depth of maturity is revealed in his character. When he and his cousins were children, Phoney made him steal pies off windowsills, because he was the tallest, and apparently they were poor to the point where they could not afford food. Phoney mentions that when he became rich, Smiley made him pay everyone back. Phoney Bone always employs Smiley in his scams, like in the cow race (The Great Cow Race). Sometimes Smiley shows a penchant for intelligence, as when, in Vol. 9 &quot;Crown of Horns&quot;, he devises a plan during the siege of Atheia. The plan is to feed the two stupid Rat Creatures (whom Smiley captured as they tried to infiltrate the city) quiche, then let them go &quot;accidentally&quot;, so the Rat Creatures would tell their leaders that Atheia could withstand the siege, under the logic that if they could feed their prisoners quiche, they presumably have enough food to feed themselves making a siege hopeless. Later, he had aided Phoney in bringing armed reinforcements, though they arrived too late as the actions of the dragons ended the war. Though Smiley has his joyful and happy-go-lucky personality throughout the series, he also has his serious and sorrow moments while he had grown more mature when he first took care of Bartleby. At the later half of the series after &quot;Rock Jaw: Master of the Eastern Border&quot;, Smiley had shown more concern about the reality of the war in the Valley, as he maintained cautiousness for his friends in times of danger. Smiley is also fiercely protective of Bartleby; he refused to leave the cub behind despite Gran&#x27;ma Ben&#x27;s strict orders and he went as far as to tackle a Venu guard to help Bartleby escape from an angry mob following an accidental exposure. Smiley later mourned Lucius and expressed sadness at leaving the Valley and saying goodbye to his friends and allies.

===Valley characters===
;Thorn Harvestar
:Seemingly a simple farm girl, it is soon revealed that she is heir to the throne of Atheia. She is also a &quot;Veni-Yan-Cari&quot; (the awakened one), one who can see into the &quot;dreaming&quot;, a kind of parallel existence, or &quot;spirit world&quot;. Thorn has excellent courage as well as fantastic powers, such as escaping through a landslide blindfolded, flying, and jumping a castle wall without injuring herself. In a sense she can do anything if she can &quot;concentrate her dreaming&quot;. Fone Bone falls in love with her at their first meeting. She starts off sweet and innocent, but later in &quot;The Dragonslayer&quot;, when the seriousness and reality of everything dawns on her, she takes on a more mature and tougher personality.

;Rose &quot;Gran&#x27;ma&quot; Ben (born Rose Harvestar)
:Thorn&#x27;s grandmother, a tough-as-nails farmer who races against cows on foot as a hobby, and always wins. An immensely strong person, it is revealed that she is the former Queen of Atheia who escaped to Barrelhaven with Lucius Down to protect and safeguard Thorn.

;Lucius Down
:A large, gruff, older man who is described as over seven feet tall and over 300 pounds. Lucius is so powerful he could scare even Euclid into submission. He runs the Barrelhaven Tavern, and is the foil for almost all of Phoney Bone&#x27;s schemes. In the later books we find that Jonathan Oaks was like a son to him. He was previously Captain of the Queen&#x27;s guard and it was hinted he had a history with Gran&#x27;ma Ben, only to reveal later that he had &#x27;picked the wrong girl&#x27;, instead falling in love with her sister, Briar, whose motive in the affair was to hurt Rose. He was later in love with Rose Harvestar. Before the Rat Creatures destroy his tavern, he relocates to Old Man&#x27;s Cave, where he becomes Captain of an ill-equipped infantry of Barrelhaven farmers. After the volcano erupts, he leads the farmers and Veni Yan south, arriving in time for the battle on Sinner&#x27;s Rock. When the Hooded One prepares to kill Rose, Lucius grabs onto her just as she is destroyed; the resulting surge in power kills Lucius. His body is later taken north and buried behind the rebuilt Barrelhaven Tavern.

;The Great Red Dragon
:The son of the great dragon Mim, The Great Red Dragon is often Fone Bone&#x27;s last-minute savior. The Red Dragon appears when he is most needed. Gran&#x27;ma Ben does not trust him, regardless of how many times he has saved her or her friends from harm. The Great Red Dragon seems to be incredibly ancient. In a sequence that shows the land during the Dragons&#x27; reign, supposedly the beginning of time, the Great Red Dragon can be seen fighting Mim along with other dragons. As said in the prequel &quot;Stupid, Stupid Rat Tails&quot;, he is Mim&#x27;s son and he was part of the group that trapped her in stone when the Valley was made. He took care of Thorn during the Great War while Rose searched for a place for them to hide. He is also seen at the end of &quot;Stupid, Stupid Rat Tails&quot; during the time of Boneville&#x27;s founding by Big Johnson Bone. Fone Bone indicates that he has a baritone voice. The dragon itself does not appear to have a name, beyond &quot;The Great Red Dragon&quot;. If he has one, it is unknown to anyone but himself.

;Jonathan Oaks
:A small, often outspoken villager who works for Lucius at the Barrelhaven, and views Lucius as a hero. He is saved from an ambush from the rat creatures in &quot;Old Man&#x27;s Cave&quot; after being wounded severely. It is suggested in &quot;Ghost Circles&quot; that he ultimately does not survive his wounds.

;Wendell
:One of Lucius&#x27; tough &quot;bar-room boys&quot; and the tinsmith of Barrelhaven. Outspoken in the early issues (he and Euclid have more than once threatened to trounce Phoney Bone), he becomes more introverted once the reality of the war presents itself. He often changes sides and his mind. He goes from hating the Bones and stick-eaters (Veni-Yan warriors) to following them, then hating the Bones again (though he gets along with Fone Bone following the victory of the war). He seems to be a powerful ally to have in his village and is often followed by the villagers when he changes sides. Despite his skinny appearance, he is implied to be just as strong as Euclid.

;Euclid
:Along with Jonathan and Wendell, one of the &quot;bar-room boys&quot;. He is depicted as very large and muscular, and often wishes to resort to physical force to solve problems. He is consumed by a ghost circle after the volcano explosion, but returns after Thorn destroys the ghost circles.

;Rory
:A third bar-room boy. Is almost always present near Wendell, Euclid, and Jonathan, but rarely speaks. None of his comments give much of a hint to his personality. It is implied that he is a total follower with little or no influence.

;Ted
:A helpful &quot;Acanalonia bivittata&quot;, or planthopper, who appears as a recurring supporting character. Often mistaken for a leaf, Ted is the first creature Fone Bone encounters when he enters the valley and the two become fast friends. He harbors a strange link to the Red Dragon and has an older brother who is several hundred times his size. He is able to perform magical enchantments and has the ability to detect Ghost Circles.

;Miss Possum
:A female opossum who is the mother to the three possum kids, she is likewise a caring, motherly figure to everyone in the valley. She often has something to give to Fone Bone when she sees him, such as sealing putty, which Fone mistakenly eats a little of.

;The Possum Kids
:Three young opossums with a thirst for adventure. They have a knack for getting into trouble which then Fone Bone saves them from, but they are resourceful and cunning, and play a significant part in &quot;Rock Jaw&quot;. The possums look suspiciously like Pogo the possum from Walt Kelly&#x27;s comic strip.

===Main antagonists===
;The Hooded One (Briar Harvestar)
:Servant of the Lord of the Locusts, Kingdok&#x27;s superior, and the main antagonist. It is implied that The Hooded One is a former Veni Yan warrior, as she wears a similar robe and hood. It is later revealed that the Hooded One is Briar Harvestar, the elder sister of Gran&#x27;ma Ben and the grand-aunt of Thorn. It is heavily implied that her antagonism is based on nothing more than jealousy of Rose, who was apparently her mom&#x27;s favorite between the two and had the affection of Lucius. When the Rat Creatures invaded in the great war, she betrayed the Royal family by showing the Rat Creatures the secret escape passage Thorn had used to escape the palace. When the King, Thorn&#x27;s father, learned of this betrayal, he cut her in half with an abandoned harvesting scythe, which the Hooded One now carries as a weapon that can now cut through steel and rock. Briar was possessed and resurrected by a swarm of locusts. She is killed when her master, the Lord of the Locusts, is destroyed. It is suggested by some of her actions throughout the storyline that being the servant of the Lord of the Locusts drove her insane. Despite this, she is shown to be intellectual, being an effective rabble-rouser and even converting several humans to her side. Additionally, her proficiency with a scythe is a major part of her character, as she is almost always seen with the scythe and can use it easily.

;Kingdok
:A giant rat creature, ruler of the horde of rat creatures and lackey of the Lord of the Locusts. Although he is ego-maniacal and cruel, he is prone to superstition and easily manipulated by The Hooded One. He carries a golden spiked club around with him, until Thorn cuts off his right arm. Roque Ja at one point attacks Kingdok and rips out his tongue, which he keeps as a trophy. A possible continuity error is that while Roque Ja is bragging about owning the tongue, Kingdok cannot speak, but later speaks clearly to the Hooded One; after that, he attempts to say &quot;kill you&quot;, and it comes out &quot;gill yoo&quot;, just as one would speak without a tongue. This may be an effect of the Hooded One&#x27;s power; while the Hooded One is alive he can speak, but after she is destroyed he cannot. Afterwards, Kingdok spends most of his time lumbering about underground to reach the Crown of Horns. At the end of the novel, he faces Thorn before she can touch the Crown of Horns. Having been stripped of his authority, dignity, and physical health over the course of the series, he demands that Thorn face him in a life or death battle. He reveals that he had been the one to kill her parents by eating them, and proceeds to bite Thorn&#x27;s leg when she tries to get around him. He dies when Thorn stabs him shortly thereafter. In the &quot;Bone Handbook&quot;, Jeff Smith says Kingdok&#x27;s design (large body and legs, but small arms) was largely influenced by the anatomy of a tyrannosaurus rex.

;Fone Bone&#x27;s Two Rat Creatures
:Two rat creature soldiers, one blue, one brown, who have a particular interest in devouring the Bone cousins, and Fone Bone in particular. The two are rather incompetent, once deserting the army after their disobedience costs Kingdok his arm and later allying with the Bones briefly before returning to their own side. They address each other as &quot;comrade&quot;. Fone Bone is the one who dubs the two &quot;Stupid, Stupid Rat Creatures&quot;, most commonly when they are hanging off the side of a cliff. Occasionally other characters also refer to them as such. Fone Bone is also usually credited with coining the term &quot;Rat Creatures&quot; itself; however, he actually got the name from the possum kids. In Rat Creature tradition only royalty are allowed to have names, but in the spin-off novel series &quot;Quest for the Spark&quot; two young Bones gave them the names &quot;Stinky&quot; and &quot;Smelly&quot;.
:As it stands, the proper name of their species appears to be Hairy Men. Named after some incidents where one, or both, clearly emphasize their title, they in turn call Fone Bone &quot;Small Mammal&quot;. In a running gag throughout the series, the brown rat creature often suggests cooking Fone Bone in a quiche. The other rat creature then flies into a rage, insisting that &#x27;dainty pastry foods&#x27; are &#x27;unfit for monsters&#x27;, and that they should eat him in a stew—though he did once in a fit of anger declare an intention of eating Fone Bone raw, and on another occasion, when they were starving, told his comrade that he would not mind some of his home-made quiche. Later, Fone Bone himself delivered to the two some &#x27;piping hot quiche&#x27; when he found them shivering in a bush after the Hooded One&#x27;s defeat. They also have a major role in &quot;Quest for the Spark&quot;. The characters are also depicted as having a bad relationship with Kingdok, as he almost always berates them, often for unnecessary reasons.

===Other characters===

;Bartleby
:A purplish baby rat creature found by Fone Bone and adopted as a pet by Smiley Bone (who also gave him his name). After the Bones&#x27; first encounter with Roque Ja, Bartleby returns to the fold of the Rat Creatures, though is out of place there and returns to the Bones later after growing a little. He became a good friend to Smiley and when they left for Boneville, he went with them. Bartleby was named by Shaenon K. Garrity, for the title character in the short story &quot;Bartleby, the Scrivener&quot; by Herman Melville. Unlike the other Rat Creatures, Bartleby has round ears. He explains that the Rat Creatures are supposed to get their ears cropped and that he ran away before they could do that to him. Bartleby also explains that the first time he ran away from the Rat Creatures was after he got his tail chopped off. He states that all Rat Creatures are born with beautiful, long, hairless tails, but all the Rat Creature cubs have their tails chopped off around the time they turn one year old. This is due to their belief that a sort of boogie man named &#x27;The Jekk&#x27; will drag them away in their sleep by their tails. In the prequel book &quot;Stupid, Stupid, Rat-Tails&quot;, we learn that the Bone cousins&#x27; forefather &#x27;Big Johnson Bone&#x27; is the fabled boogie man they fear, having come to the Valley hundreds of years earlier and fighting the Rat Creatures by swinging them around by their tails. In a sequence depicting the land during the Dragons&#x27; rule, Rat Creatures with long tails can be seen in the distance.

;Roque Ja (Rock Jaw)
:A huge mountain lion and an adversary to Kingdok who views himself as neutral in the conflict between the humans and the Lord of the Locusts despite lopsided affiliations. He is the guardian of the Eastern Border. His personal views are that there is no such thing as &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot;, only that power matters above all and that friendship and love are meaningless. He despises both Dragons and Rat Creatures but works for the Hooded One in exchange for land and spoils of war. His name is mispronounced as &#x27;Rock Jaw&#x27; by the Bone cousins. His size also varies in the books sometimes being smaller than Kingdok to being large enough to fill a huge gap in the mountain side.

;Roderick and the Orphans
:Roderick is a young raccoon whose parents were killed and eaten by the two stupid rat creatures. He is the leader of a large group of orphaned animal children living in the mountains. Roderick is the only one named, and the complete group consists of a beaver, a boar, a second raccoon, two birds, a rabbit, a porcupine, a turtle, two snakes, a squirrel, and a chipmunk. Roderick the Raccoon is a main character in the Quest for the Spark, though he is now older and friends with Tom Elm, another main character in the trilogy.

;King Agak
:The new Rat Creature king in &quot;Quest for the Spark&quot;, who replaces Kingdok following the latter&#x27;s death. Like Kingdok, he hates the two Stupid Rat Creatures. After the duo steal a dead squirrel from him, he becomes obsessed with revenge. Agak and his army are starving, and are convinced that they can cure their hunger by eating the Bones.

;The Lord of the Locusts
:The unseen dark lord who serves as the source of all conflict in the series. He is an evil, formless &quot;nightmare&quot; trapped inside a mountain, and appears in the form of a locust swarm to his henchmen and followers. He is powerless on his own, and relies on possessing others in order to accomplish his goals. He is even capable of reviving the dead, seen primarily with Briar. He is killed when Fone Bone and Thorn, bearing a piece of the Locust themselves in their souls, touched the Crown of Horns. He normally appears either as a formless mass, a bright light, a pair of eyes, a massive locust, or a swarm of locusts in a basic shape.

;Mim
:The benevolent queen of the dragons, considered to be the creator of the valley. She kept the world in balance by putting her tail into her mouth so that her body forms a circle, and perpetually spinning, until she was possessed by the Lord of the Locusts, turning her irrational and violent. The other dragons were forced to turn her to stone to seal the Lord of the Locusts. Her awakening was said to be the end of the world, but when the Lord of the Locusts was destroyed, an aged Mim returned to her function followed by all of the other Dragons besides the Great Red Dragon.

;The Veni Yan (&quot;stick-eaters&quot;)
:A mysterious clan of hooded warriors, who respect dragons as the supreme rulers of the land. Distrusted by the townsfolk (who came up with the derogatory term &quot;stick-eater&quot;) but trusted by Lucius, though often they do not trust him in return. They are loyal to the royal family even after Grandma Ben and Thorn went into exile and immediately recognizes Rose&#x27;s authority upon her return to the capital. For much of the series, they serve as a channel of communication between the capital, Lucius, Grandma Ben, and Thorn.

;Headmaster
:The leader of the Venu and most powerful soldier. He is distinguished with a fur vest with bronze tokens. In the series, two appear. The first is the current one who has a feeling that the world is ending. The second one is retired in the city of Atheia and is the headmaster that appears in &quot;Rose&quot;.

;Tarsil
:The ruthless leader of the Vedu. He is missing an arm and has a large scar down the length of his face, injuries he claims to have obtained while fighting dragons. He wears a large earring on one ear, and his beard in two separate parts each wrapped in a piece of cloth. He does not respect the monarchy of Aethia claiming that the throne is dead, even when Rose and Thorn return. He is killed by Briar in front of his own people, effectively ending his rule.

;The Vedu
:A separatist group of Veni Yan who are led by Tarsil. Although they wear similar hoods to the Veni Yan they are distinguishable by the eye on their hoods. The Vedu do not worship, or even respect, dragons, claiming that they have all gone into hiding or are uncaring enough to ignore their people. They have kept order in Aethia for much of the time that Rose and Thorn were in exile, and claim that things are better that way. However, some people disagree and continue to set out dragon shrines, which are forcibly removed by the Vedu.

==Reception==
===Critical praise===
&quot;Bone&quot; had only six issues published when it was selected for &quot;Palmer&#x27;s Picks&quot; by Tom Palmer, Jr., who commented that &quot;Smith&#x27;s artwork is deceptively simple. He doesn&#x27;t use much flash, yet he is a master of conveying gesture and body language for both humorous and dramatic effect&quot;. He also noted that &quot;the series has only recently begun, yet it has been met with enormous amounts of critical praise from people ranging from Will Eisner to Peter David&quot;. Michael Arner from PopMatters.com was initially not impressed with the black and white artwork, and at first disappointed at the ending, hoping for a more conclusive dénouement. However, he ultimately praised the depth of the characterizations and Smith&#x27;s ability to mix humor and adventure as perfect.

Bob&#x27;s Comics Review described the work as &quot;Tolkienesque&quot; in its compulsive progression from a simple comic tale to a sprawling epic. Although critical of the earlier issues, the writer came to enjoy the range of writing &quot;from slapstick (the cow race is a classic), to the scary yet hilarious rat creatures, to intimations of high fantasy&quot;. Smith&#x27;s sense of timing was praised as well as the creator&#x27;s use of the silent panel and &quot;repeated scene with variations of movement or perspective&quot;. In 2004, &quot;Time&quot; critic Andrew Arnold called &quot;Bone&quot; &quot;the best all-ages graphic novel yet published&quot;. In 2011, &quot;IGN&quot; ranked &quot;Bone&quot; 60th in the Top 100 comic book heroes.

===Literary controversy===
In 2010, a Minnesota parent sought to have &quot;Bone&quot; banned from all elementary school libraries in the Rosemount-Apple Valley-Eagan School District, citing references in the work to smoking, drinking, and gambling. After a hearing, a school district committee voted 10 to 1 to keep the books on the shelves. Other challenges and controversies that cite racism and political viewpoint as main problems have led to &quot;Bone&quot;″s placement on the 2013 ALA Banned Books List. Smith remarked himself that &quot;&quot;Bone&quot; was not originally created with children in mind, so I never worried about the fact that children might read them&quot;. This being said, the comics are regarded by critics as applicable to any age group.

==Other media==
===Canceled films and animated series===
Numerous attempts have been made to adapt the books, all of which have failed to come to fruition. In the late 1990s, an attempt was made by Nickelodeon Movies to produce a film adaptation of &quot;Bone&quot;. Jeff Smith said in a 2003 interview that Nickelodeon wanted the Bone cousins to be voiced by child actors, and wanted the film&#x27;s soundtrack to include pop songs by the likes of NSYNC; Smith was critical of this proposal.

In March 2008, Warner Bros. Pictures bought the film rights to the series. Smith&#x27;s website confirmed on March 13 that he had made a deal with Warner Bros. to adapt the &quot;Bone&quot; saga into a film series. Further information was given in July 2011, citing that &quot;two scripts have already been written and rejected—a third is currently in the works and will most likely yield three separate, computer-animated, 3-D films&quot;. In January 2012, Patrick Sean Smith, the creator of TV series &quot;Greek&quot;, was hired to write an adaptation, and that P. J. Hogan was attached to direct the feature, to be produced by Lin Pictures and Animal Logic. In November 2016, Mark Osborne had been hired to direct the animated adaptation for Warner Animation Group. Osborne, along with Adam Kline, were set to write the film, which would have been the first in a planned trilogy.

In October 2019, the project was picked up by Netflix for an animated series after Warner&#x27;s turnaround of the project. However, in April 2022, production on the series was canceled during a reorganization of Netflix Animation; following this, many animation studios contacted Smith to express &quot;immediate interest&quot; in the project. As of February 2023, Netflix retains the rights to the series.

===Action figures===
In 1996, the toy manufacturer Resaurus released Series One of a Bone action figure line, featuring: Fone Bone with Rat Cub, Thorn, Smiley Bone, and Rat Creature. Five years later, a second line was released with Gran&#x27;ma Ben, Phoney Bone, The Hooded One, and a deluxe boxed set of Kingdok. Two exclusive figures were released through the toy and comic magazine &quot;Previews&quot;: Hooded One (glow in the dark), and Phoney Bone as Ahab. Most recently, in 2007, &quot;Dark Horse Comics Presents&quot; released a statue of Fone Bone, which is limited to 750 pieces and to be sold through &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine.

===Video games===
In 2005, video game studio Telltale Games developed an episodic adventure game series based on the comic. While five episodes were planned, only two were ultimately released. The first episode, &quot;&quot;, was released on September 15, 2005, and the second, &quot;&quot;, on April 12, 2006. Both were available in downloaded or boxed form on Telltale&#x27;s website for Windows-based PCs. The games were also available via Steam, but were delisted following Telltale&#x27;s closure.

<text>The Tuckahoe River is a blackwater river in southern New Jersey in the United States.

One of the few blackwater rivers in the northeastern United States, the river drains an area of the southern Pinelands and empties into the Atlantic Ocean.

==Course==
The Tuckahoe River rises in central Atlantic County, approximately east of Vineland and flows south, then east, forming part of the boundary between Atlantic and Cape May counties, then past Tuckahoe, where it becomes navigable. It flows into Great Egg Harbor Bay just south of the mouth of the Great Egg Harbor River, approximately southwest of Atlantic City. The lower form a widening estuary through Great Cedar Swamp downstream from its head of navigation at Tuckahoe.

<doc id="668552" wikidata="Q321046" url="?curid=668552" title="Window blind">
<text>A window blind is a type of window covering. There are many different kinds of window blinds which use a variety of control systems. A typical window blind is made up of several long horizontal or vertical slats of various types of hard material, including wood, plastic or metal which are held together by cords that run through the blind slats. Vertical blinds run along a track system which can tilt open and closed and move side-to-side. Window blinds can be manoeuvred with either a manual or remote control by rotating them from an open position, with slats spaced out, to a closed position where slats overlap and block out most of the light. There are also several types of window coverings, called shades, that use a single piece of soft material instead of slats.

The term window blinds can also be used to describe window coverings more broadly. In this context window blinds include almost every type of window covering, whether it is a hard or soft material; i.e. shutters, roller shades, cellular shades (also called honeycomb shades), wood blinds, Roman shades, standard vertical, and horizontal blinds (also called Venetians). In the United Kingdom, awnings are sometimes called blinds or shades.

==Overview==

Window blinds are generally sold as either ready-made or made to measure. As the names suggest, blinds that are ready-made are manufactured to set sizes based on typical window dimensions, whereas blinds that are made to a measurement are cut to a specific width and drop to match the window. The advantage of ready-made blinds is their availability and cost, whereas blinds that are made to measure will be more expensive but better fit the dimensions of a window.

Aside from coming in different dimensions, window blinds can also come in a variety of different styles, materials, colours and patterns. Below is a list of several popular styles of blinds:

* Panel
* Pleated
* Roller
* Roman
* Venetian
* Vertical
* Wooden

Window blinds can be drawn manually using a cord, or automated through motorization. Controls for motorized blinds can be from a wall switch or keypad, remote control, or computer, eliminating the need for cords and allowing control of otherwise inaccessible windows. A number of modern homes are integrating blind control with central C-Bus solutions. This control provides ease of use and is effective for controlling blind operation to reduce heat loss during winter or minimize heat from the sun during summer.

==Types==
===Panel===
Panel blinds, sometimes referred to as Japanese blinds as they are based on Japanese shōji, are thin blinds in a panel shape that run along a track. Almost any fabric or paper can be employed, although 90% of all shoji blinds use white polyester to imitate &#x27;washi&#x27; Japanese paper.
===Cellular shades===

Cellular shades or cellular blinds, sometimes referred to as honeycomb shades, are a type of window blind made of a long and continuous fabric with a cellular structure when opened and fold onto themselves when closed. The honeycomb shades were introduced in 1985. The fabric is often made from soft paper or cloth-like material and is available in a variety of different structures including single cell, double cell or triple cell. Cellular blinds work by trapping air inside the cell structure once opened and create a barrier between the window surface and the room. Due to the unavailability of standardized tests, no ranking system currently exists to compare the efficacy of these blinds.

Windows and doors make up for almost one-third of a home&#x27;s total thermal loss, according to the Department of Energy (United Kingdom). This applies to heat loss in winter as well as entry of undesired heat in summer. When air inside the room comes in contact with windows, it is cooled or warmed. By convection, this air then circulates around the room. Cell shapes in the blinds hold trapped air and create a barrier between the window surface and the room, thus lessening the transfer of heat. Shades, however, provide only slight control of air infiltration.

In common with all blinds, cellular shades can reduce solar gain in summer and provide room darkening or blackout for sleeping. Like most other window treatments, they are raised and lowered with a string. Cordless cellular shades are available to reduce the risk of strangulation for small children. One may also have the option of lowering the top of the shade down, and/or the bottom of the shade up; commonly referred to as a Top-Down-Bottom-Up mechanism.

===Roman===
Roman shades are a type of window blind used to help block out the sun. Although often called blinds, these are actually referred to as &quot;shades&quot; in the window covering industry. They are often referred to as Romans or Roman blinds in the UK. When opened, the Romans stack up evenly; when covering the full window height, they are smooth without overlapping.

Roman blinds can be purchased with a blackout lining on the back to fully block out sunlight. However, there will always be small light gaps on the edges of the blinds if mounted on the inside of the window frame or peeking out from behind the blind if mounted on the frame around the window.

Unlike other blinds, such as certain fabrics used for roller shades, vinyl vertical blinds, or vinyl horizontal blinds, Roman shades are not an ideal option for areas with a lot of moisture, such as bathrooms or windows above a kitchen sink.
===Roller===
Roller blinds are a type of window blind that is typically made from a polyester fabric wrapped around a plastic or metal roller. The roller may either be exposed or enclosed inside of a frame and can be placed at the top of the window recess or outside of the recess. To control the roller blind there is typically a chain or string on either side of the blind. When the side chain is pulled one direction the roller will raise, and if pulled in the opposite direction it will lower instead.

Some manufacturers also produce a version of roller blinds with two layers of fabric, sometimes referred to as double roller blinds, for even greater control of light filtration through a window. Typically, one layer will be made of a sheer fabric that can be used to reduce glare, with a second layer that typically includes a blackout lining for even greater filtration when necessary.

===Venetian===

A Venetian blind is a type of window blind made from overlapping horizontal slats that are typically lowered and drawn together by pulling a cord. The slats are typically manufactured using a rigid material such as aluminium, plastic, or wood and move in unison through a series of wires that run through the blinds.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Venetian blinds were widely adopted in office buildings to regulate light and air. A large modern complex in the US that adopted Venetian blinds was Rockefeller Center&#x27;s RCA Building (better known as the Radio City building) in New York City, completed in the 1930s. One of the largest orders for Venetian blinds ever placed was to the Burlington Venetian Blind Co., of Burlington, Vermont, which supplied blinds for the windows of the Empire State Building in New York City.
In 1994, a design for Venetian blinds integrated with window glass panels was patented. This new type of blind overcomes the problems related to damaging and fouling. Usually, magnets are used for motor transmission in order to preserve the sealing inside the insulating glass.

===Vertical===

Vertical blinds were introduced in 1948 (Flexible Blind Company, Hunter Douglas), and gained acceptance as an alternative to draperies due to the streamlined look, versatility, energy efficiency, large variety of finishes. The construction includes a horizontal (occasionally, in custom designs, tilted) &quot;track&quot; with moving &quot;carriers&quot; and vertical strips, called &quot;vanes&quot;, hanging off the carriers (attached by &quot;clips&quot;). The vanes can rotate, changing the amount of light entering the room, and, when in open position, traverse the track (and thus be stacked compactly on one side of the window). When closed, the vanes tightly overlap, creating a good barrier against the sunlight penetration in summer and energy loss in winter.

Unlike horizontal blinds, vertical blinds are less likely to collect dust because they stand vertically. Since they draw to the side rather than lifting and lowering, they are easier and faster to operate. They operate best on patio doors and sliding windows that slide from side to side. In the 1970s there were few choices of fabric- usually beige or white, which had to have stiffener embedded to prevent fraying, rather like on roller blinds fabric but using a thicker textile.

Vertical blinds became available in flat plastic (PVC), fabric, embossed PVC, also S-curved slats. A more modern modification is to offer them with wood trim at the top and bottom—sometimes midway as well—and these are usually described as &quot;Japanese Vertical blinds&quot; because they are often coordinated with Japanese style Shoji blinds using the same timber. Vertical blinds were most popular in the UK during the 1990s, since then sales have slowed as they lost popularity with a younger generation.

Stationary vertical blinds are hung in the doorways of some homes and businesses which generally leave the door open. Movement of the blind may signal a change in airflow, or someone entering the doorway. More commonly, however, these vertical blinds are made of thick plastic. In the cold rooms of food businesses, this slows the heat leakage into the cold room. In warmer climates, vertical blinds discourage flies and some other insects from entering the building.
In certain areas of the UK window blinds are used to disguise the fact that offices have PCs in them and are used as a burglary deterrent.

===Others===

Other varieties of window blinds include mini blinds (typically aluminum, Venetian-Style blinds with very narrow slats, usually wide), micro blinds (usually wide), louvers, jalousies, brise soleil and pleated blinds.

==Materials==
Blinds can be made in a variety of materials; some expensive and some less so. Less expensive blinds are usually made in polyester, aluminum, or PVC. These are inexpensive materials that are all easily accessible and yet durable at the same time.

A window blind is a means of screening a window, achieving similar results to those obtained by fitting curtains. Blinds are typically the same width and height as the window itself or slightly wider and taller—depending on whether they are fixed inside (Recess) or outside (Facefix) the window&#x27;s reveal (i.e. the wall recess within which the window itself is fixed).

Window blinds have varying thermal effects: they can block unwanted heat of the summer sun and they can keep in heat in cold weather. But in both of these applications, they also reduce light to varying degrees, depending on the design. Many kinds of blinds attempt varying balances of privacy and shade. Blinds can be made of a number of different materials and manufactured in a number of different ways. This usually determines the name by which the blind is commonly known.

===Fabric===
Blinds (otherwise referred to as &quot;shades&quot;) made of fabric can either be rolled up (on a tube; Roller shades), folded up (Roman shades) or pushed up in an accordion style (Pleated and Cellular shades). Many fabrics are used including cotton, polyester, wool, viscose and silk to create these shades. A silk cloth can be present or embroidery stitch, which will give tissue varied terrain.

===Wood===

====Wooden blinds (Venetian blinds)====
Wooden blinds are generally known as Venetian blinds. A number of horizontal wooden slats are joined by corded pulleys which can either gather all the slats at the top of the window to reveal the view or simply angle the slats while allowing some light to travel through the blind yet retaining some level of privacy. Wooden blinds come in a number of finishes (determined by the type of wood used, which ranges from painted to most types of solid oak varieties) and sizes (determined by the width of each slat which is usually available in one of three widths—, , or ). Wooden Venetian blinds are also available as vertical blinds. These are usually made up of wider slats and operate in virtually the same way as their horizontal counterparts (i.e. instead of drawing upwards to reveal the window, they draw to one side gathering in a vertical bunch).

====Pinoleum blinds====
Pinoleum blinds are made up of small wooden twigs laid horizontally which are joined by vertical threading. The resulting weave is, as a result, only flexible vertically and can be drawn upwards once manufactured as a roller blind or in a similar fashion to a Venetian blind. Conservatory blinds are often made with Pinoleum.

In Malaysia, an outdoor blind is sometimes called a &quot;chik&quot;. The word was carried over from India by the British during the colonial times.

===Faux wood===
Faux wood blinds are an alternative to real wood blinds. Faux wood is also known by the trade name &quot;Plaswood&quot; (a portmanteau of &quot;plastic&quot; &amp; &quot;wood&quot;). Made of a composite of man-made materials and natural wood particles, faux wood can be a less expensive choice than natural wood. These blinds have become more popular as the products have matured, becoming cheaper and more versatile at the same time offering more of a natural wood look. Current faux wood blinds are warp resistant, have UV ratings as high as 500 and come in colors that would be hard to find in natural wood blinds.
Because of their resistance to warping, faux wood window blinds are suitable for areas with extreme temperature swings or high moisture, such as bathrooms and kitchens.

===Other materials===


Venetian blinds, both horizontal and vertical, are available in a number of man-made materials (either resembling wood or metal or simply plastic). These are better suited to areas where moisture or direct contact with water is likely to cause a problem, such as bathrooms and kitchens. These blinds are often available with micro slats (as small as or less). The result of smaller slats is that more have to be used to obscure the window completely. Conservatory blinds (i.e. ceiling fixed via a number of horizontal pulleys) are often made of man-made materials.

== Safety==
Corded window blinds present a strangulation hazard to children, causing 184 deaths in the United States between 1996 and 2012. Recalls of window covering products have not significantly reduced the number of deaths since 1980. Retrofit kits have been used since 1995 to &quot;reduce&quot; the strangulation hazard; however, children have strangled on retrofit kits since 1995. The US CPSC recommends using cordless or cord-free window coverings where children live or visit. For window coverings that use continuous-loop cord systems, like vertical blinds, a wall cord cleat can be used to anchor the cord tightly to the wall and prevent children from having access to the dangling cord loop. Window blinds slats are held together with cords that allow for tilting slats, raising or lowering, and these are potentially dangerous if loose. As an added precaution, cord stops should be installed correctly and adjusted to restrict the movement of inner lift cords.

== Vehicle blinds ==

Some vehicles include or are retrofitted with sun blinds for rear and rear side windows. See also car glass. These blinds are used to protect the vehicle and the passengers from direct sunlight.

Car shades are another common way to protect the vehicle. The shades for the rear and front windows are designed to be unfolded and sit against the window. They can be made of plastic or cardboard. The shades that go on the side windows of a vehicle are usually attached using either suction cups or static cling.

Solid fabric and slat car blinds have given way to cheaper and more flexible, folding, wire-framed &quot;dark-stocking&quot; synthetic blinds. These are used where the car owner has not dark-tinted the glass of the car windows enough, or during the day, by drivers or passengers seeking more privacy.

Most commercial airliners feature window blinds in the passenger cabin. These blinds are generally made of plastic and are usually closed during cruises. In a first for the aviation industry, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner lacks window blinds – instead, the airliner features an advanced window dimming system that serves the same purpose.

<text>Marika Rökk (; born Marie Karoline Rökk, 3 November 1913 – 16 May 2004) was a German-Austrian dancer, singer and actress of Hungarian descent who gained prominence in German films in the Nazi era. She resumed her career in 1947 and was one of Europe&#x27;s most famous operetta singers, performing onstage until 1986.

==Life and work==
Marie Karoline Rökk was born in 1913 in Cairo, Egypt, the daughter of Hungarian architect and contractor Eduard Rökk and his wife, Maria Karoline Charlotte (born Karoly) Rökk. She spent her childhood in Budapest, but in 1924 her family moved to Paris where her father had been contractually engaged. Here she learned to dance and starred with the Hoffmann Girls at the Moulin Rouge cabaret.

After a tour that led her to Broadway she continued her dance training in the United States, where she worked with Ned Wayburn. In 1929 she returned to Europe and the next year acted in her first film, &quot;Why Sailors Leave Home&quot;, a British comedy directed by Monty Banks, starring Leslie Fuller.

She made her real breakthrough when the Universum Film AG (UFA) attempted to create a German film star to rival Hollywood&#x27;s top musical star actresses Eleanor Powell, Ginger Rogers and later, Alice Faye, Rita Hayworth and Betty Grable. The Third Reich&#x27;s Minister of Propaganda, Joseph Goebbels, admired Hollywood movies and examined them carefully in regular private screenings. Early Technicolor films such as &quot;Becky Sharp&quot; (1935), &quot;The Garden of Allah&quot; (1936), &quot;Nothing Sacred&quot; (1937), and &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (1937) made him realize that Hollywood feature films presented a threat to Germany&#x27;s internal market and that Hollywood&#x27;s dominance of colour and musical film technology should be matched, at least if Germany was serious about engaging in a cultural war with the U.S. and Britain.
As an acclaimed revue dancer on numerous European stages, Rökk was selected as the ideal candidate to be groomed and promoted as this new type of star and in 1934 was offered a two-year contract with UFA, where she became one of the most prolific film stars of the time. Rökk&#x27;s German film debut was &quot;Leichte Kavallerie&quot; (Light Cavalry) (1935, Werner Hochbaum) with Heinz von Cleve. The film made her a sensation overnight.

It was the first of a series of modern escapist, lightweight operettas and glittering revue-style entertainments which quickly made Rökk one of Germany&#x27;s most popular actresses. These films were clearly modeled on the successful formula of the black-and-white and Technicolor musical films being produced by American film studios RKO, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and 20th Century Fox in the 1930s and 1940s.

She had the technical skill and glamour to carry off the formulaic plots and dialogue and provide German audiences with a home grown star to rival the popular American actresses. &quot;Der Bettelstudent&quot; and &quot;Gasparone&quot;, followed by &quot;Hello Janine!&quot; in 1939, all starred her together with Johannes Heesters and established them as the &quot;dream couple&quot; of the musical comedy genre. In her appearances she cultivated her &quot;magyar&quot; accent conveying a notion of &quot;paprika&quot; exoticism. Her films, which were not overtly political, were also popular in wider parts of Europe.

With a double role in &quot;Kora Terry&quot;, a 1940 film directed by her future husband Georg Jacoby, she reached new heights. By simultaneously impersonating dutiful and evil twin sisters, Rökk was able to showcase her range of theatrical talent, performing in several dance interludes which were quite risqué for that time. In the same year, she appeared in the propaganda film &quot;Wunschkonzert&quot; by Eduard von Borsody (as herself), followed by her performance in Georg Jacoby&#x27;s lavish &quot;Women Are Better Diplomats&quot; (&quot;Frauen sind doch bessere Diplomaten&quot;, UFA&#x27;s first Agfacolor motion picture) in 1941, together with Willy Fritsch.

She reached the peak of her career in 1944, with the star role in &quot;The Woman of My Dreams&quot;, a lavishly enacted musical colour film again directed by Jacoby. Though few of her movies featured overt Nazi propaganda, she fulfilled her mission to exemplify a leading woman in the Third Reich and to entertain the German people throughout World War II as intended by Goebbels. After the war, she initially was banned professionally (&quot;Berufsverbot&quot;) but was rehabilitated in 1947 and was able to continue her movie career in West Germany and Austria.

In 1948 she was among the first recipients of the German Bambi media award. Rökk became one of Europe&#x27;s most famous operetta singers, performing onstage until 1986, including at the Raimund Theater in Vienna. After her husband Georg Jacoby had died in 1964, she was married to the Hungarian actor Fred Raul from 1968 until his death in 1985. She is the mother of actress .

In 1994, the son of Soviet spymaster Lavrentiy Beria alleged that Rökk aided Soviet intelligence during World War II, sending information from Goebbels to the Soviet Union. In 2017, German and British media reported on declassified documents that indicate Rökk may have had a role in Soviet intelligence during the war. Those reports were later described as &quot;unfounded&quot; by German newspaper Die Welt.

==Death==
Rökk died of a heart attack in Baden bei Wien, Austria, in 2004, aged 90.

<doc id="668574" wikidata="Q5593905" url="?curid=668574" title="Grammy Award for Best Global Music Album">
<text>The Grammy Award for Best Global Music Album is an honor presented to recording artists for influential music from around the globe at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

==History==
The award for Best Global Music Album, reserved for international performers exhibiting &quot;non-European, indigenous traditions&quot;, was first presented to Mickey Hart in 1992 for the album &quot;Planet Drum&quot;. In 1996, Academy trustees attempted to solve the problem of &quot;compressing 75% or more of the world&#x27;s music into a single award category&quot; by broadening the definition of &quot;world music&quot; to include non-Western classical music. Beginning in 2001, award recipients included the producers, engineers, and/or mixers associated with the nominated work in addition to the recording artists. Following the 45th Grammy Awards (2003), the award was split into two separate categories for Best Traditional World Music Album and Best Contemporary World Music Album. In 2012, the two categories were merged back to Best World Music Album. In 2020, The Recording Academy announced it would be changing the name of the category to Best Global Music Album.

Angelique Kidjo has won the category the most, with five wins (four of which have been since 2016). The second group to win most often is Ladysmith Black Mambazo, who have won four times during the combined history of Global/World categories. Soweto Gospel Choir have three wins in the Global/World categories. In the single merged category, Ravi Shankar and Ry Cooder have both won twice. Angelique Kidjo also has the most nominations in the combined Global/World history with twelve additional nominations. Anoushka Shankar has the second most nominations in the combined categories with nine nominations.

In the single, merged Global category, artists from Brazil have won the most times with five wins, the USA have won four times, Benin has also won on four occasions, India and South Africa each have three wins, Mali and France have both had artists win twice.

<doc id="668582" wikidata="Q5935465" url="?curid=668582" title="Hula Bowl">
<text>The Hula Bowl is a post-season college football all-star game held annually, usually in January. From inception through the 2021 playing, it was held in Hawaii; since the 2022 edition, it has been played in Orlando, Florida.

The game was first staged in 1947, between mainland collegiate players and local Hawaiian players; it has been played exclusively with collegiate players since 1960. The bowl was paused following its 2008 edition, then was revived in January 2020.

The game was originally held at Honolulu Stadium in Honolulu, then moved to Aloha Stadium in Halawa starting with the January 1976 edition. The game remained at Aloha Stadium through the 2021 edition, except for eight editions played at War Memorial Stadium on the island of Maui. The University of Central Florida (UCF) agreed to host the January 2022 playing of the game, due to Aloha Stadium being closed for repairs and upgrades.

==History==

In late 1946, the first Hula Bowl was organized by Paul Stupin and Mackay Yanagisawa. When the inaugural game was played on January 5, 1947, the teams were composed of mainland college players (the &quot;Southern California Rose Bowl Stars&quot;, led by UCLA quarterback Ernie Case) pitted against a local team of graduates of Leilehua (the &quot;Lei&quot;alums&quot;&quot;), a local high school in Wahiawa, Hawaii—the mainland team won, 34–7. The teams played a two-game series every January until 1951, when the format was changed to allow National Football League (NFL) players to join the Hawaiian all-stars, in an effort to create a more competitive environment. From 1960 onward, the game featured only collegiate players, and game results are listed in NCAA records. Players were historically rostered by college location; North vs. South or East vs. West. Since 2000, team names of &quot;Aina&quot; and &quot;Kai&quot;, the Hawaiian words for land and ocean, have been used multiple times.

The game was originally played in Honolulu Stadium in Honolulu through the January 1975 playing, then moved to Aloha Stadium in neighboring Halawa. In 1997, the then-mayor of Maui County, Linda Lingle, obtained authorization to spend $1.2 million to improve War Memorial Stadium in the town of Kahului on the island of Maui, which then hosted the game for the 1998 through 2005 playings. However, due to poor attendance and reduced revenue, the Hula Bowl returned to Oahu for its 2006 game and stayed at Aloha Stadium through the 2008 playing.

The game has predominantly been played in January as one of the final games of the college football postseason, allowing players who competed in bowl games with their collegiate teams to participate. The game has been held in early February twice, in 2002 and 2003.

For many years, the Hula Bowl was distinguished from a similar event, the Senior Bowl, by playing by collegiate rules rather than professional rules, and by remaining amateur (the Senior Bowl paid players through its 1988 edition). This was very important for those wishing to remain eligible to compete in other collegiate sports (such as college baseball) or otherwise retain amateur status. At one point the longest-running sporting event in Hawaii, it was considered a premier venue to launch professional careers in the NFL.

===Changing direction===

On July 1, 2006, it was announced that the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) would end its ten-year relationship with the Hula Bowl due to &quot;philosophical differences&quot; over the future plans for the game, including proposed changes for the 2007 game — such as reintroducing the &quot;Hawaiian Islands versus Mainland&quot; matchup used from 1947 to 1959. University of Hawaii and former NFL head coach June Jones expressed a willingness to coach a potential Hawaiian Islands team, which would have a mix of Hawaiian and Polynesian players and, bowl organizers hoped, would draw more fans to the game. The Hula Bowl had also discussed the idea of allowing junior status players to participate in the game and bringing over college football players from Japan, something the game had done in the recent past. Game officials also discussed awarding a national &quot;Hula Bowl Player of the Week&quot; to college players during the regular season; the winning players would have been invited to play in the Hula Bowl and been able to direct a $1,000 donation to a charity in their state.

===Dormancy===
After the January 2008 playing, the bowl remained dormant. Organizers searched &quot;for opportunities to reintroduce and reimagine the historic bowl game&quot;, and in November 2016, announced their intent to restart the game in North Carolina in January 2018. However, in March 2017, additional news reports indicated that a revival of the game was unlikely, as a key supporter of the proposal, North Carolina governor Pat McCrory, left office at the start of that year.

===Revival===
On October 29, 2019, it was announced that the Hula Bowl would be revived; the 2020 edition was played at Aloha Stadium on January 26, 2020. It featured &quot;NCAA college football players from all divisions, along with international players&quot;. Aloha Stadium also hosted the 2021 edition, played on January 31, 2021, held without spectators after the facility was &quot;deemed unsafe to hold crowds&quot; in December 2020. In August 2021, with Aloha Stadium closed for repairs and upgrades, the University of Central Florida (UCF) agreed to host the 2022 playing—scheduled for January 15—at their home stadium, FBC Mortgage Stadium, in Orlando, Florida.

==Game results==


&lt;br&gt;
The Hula Bowl has used four different pairs of team designations. Before 2000, teams were rostered as either North vs. South or East vs. West, with the exception of the 1994 game, which was College Stars vs. Hawaii Ponoʻi (&quot;Hawaii&#x27;s own&quot;). Since 2000, the matchup has been Aina vs. Kai, except for 2005 and 2006, which reverted to East vs. West. Past NCAA records have substituted North or West in place of Kai (&quot;ocean&quot;), and South or East in place of Aina (&quot;land&quot;).

==Coaches==
Coaches for the first Hula Bowl played exclusively with college players, in January 1960, were Bud Wilkinson of Oklahoma and Paul Dietzel of LSU. Dietzel&#x27;s East squad defeated Wilkinson&#x27;s West team, 34–8. Multiple inductees of the College Football Hall of Fame have coached in the Hula Bowl, including: Bobby Bowden, Terry Donahue, Johnny Majors, Ara Parseghian, Bo Schembechler, and Barry Switzer. Larry Price coached in eight Hula Bowls (1969–1976) while Dick Tomey coached in seven Hula Bowls (1978–1979, 1981, 1983, 1985–1986, 1991); both while they were coaching with Hawaii. For coaches from the mainland, Lou Holtz has the most appearances, with five (1979, 1989–1990, 1993, 1997). These totals include both head coach and assistant coaching appearances.

==Hall of fame==
In 2019, the Hula Bowl announced the creation of a hall of fame. The hall&#x27;s inductees are:
Head coach appearances in the Hula Bowl are listed in parentheses in the College column.

==In popular culture==
In 1997, a storyline in the comic strip &quot;Funky Winkerbean&quot; had Harry Dinkle and the Scapegoats marching band preparing to perform at the Hula Bowl.

<doc id="668588" wikidata="Q2125243" url="?curid=668588" title="Wide (cricket)">
<text>In cricket, a wide is a type of illegal delivery to a batter (the other type being a no-ball) that is judged by the umpire to be too wide or (in international cricket) too high to be hit by the batsman by means of a normal cricket shot. It is also a type of extra, being the run awarded to the batting team as a consequence of such an illegal delivery.

==Definition==

Wide balls are covered by Law 22 of the Laws of Cricket.

A delivery is a wide if it is not sufficiently within reach for the batter to be able to hit it with the bat by means of a normal cricket stroke from where the batter is standing, and also would not have been sufficiently within reach for the batter to be able to hit it with the bat by means of a normal cricket stroke if the batter were standing in a normal guard position. Therefore a delivery is not a wide if the ball hits the bat or batsman, or if the batsman, by moving, causes the ball to be out of reach.

If a ball qualifies as a no-ball as well as a wide, the umpire will call it a no-ball, and not a wide.

==Effects==

===Runs===

When a wide is bowled, one extra run is added to the team&#x27;s total, but not added to a batter&#x27;s total.

If the wicket-keeper fumbles or misses the ball, the batters may attempt additional runs. Any runs scored thus are recorded as wides, not byes. If the wicket-keeper misses the ball and it travels all the way to the boundary, the batting team is awarded five wides. If a wide ball crosses the boundary without touching the ground, only five wides (not seven) are scored - according to Law 19.7, a boundary six can only be scored if the ball has touched the bat.

===Additional delivery===

A wide does not count as one of the six deliveries in an over, nor as a ball faced by the batters, and so an additional delivery must be bowled.

===Bowlers&#x27; statistics===

Wide balls are considered to be the fault of the bowler, and all wide runs conceded are recorded against the bowler in the bowler&#x27;s bowling analysis. However, this has only been the case since the early 1980s - the first Test to record wides (and no-balls) against the bowler&#x27;s analyses was India vs Pakistan in September 1983.

==Umpire signal==
An umpire straightens both arms to form a horizontal straight line to signal a wide.

==Scoring notation==

The conventional scoring notation for a wide is an equal cross (likened to the umpire standing with arms outstretched signalling a wide).

If the batters run byes on a wide ball or the ball runs to the boundary for 4, a dot is added in each corner for each bye that is run, typically top left, then top right, then bottom left and finally all 4 corners.

If the batter hits the stumps with the bat, or the wicket-keeper stumps the batter, the batter would be out and a ‘W’ is added to the WIDE ‘cross’ symbol.

If a batter is run out while taking byes on a wide delivery then the number of completed runs are shown as dots and an &#x27;R&#x27; is added in the corner for the incomplete run.

==Interpretation with batter switching sides==
If the batsman does a switch hit, then the ball may be bowled to either side of them within the standard distance without being called a wide.
