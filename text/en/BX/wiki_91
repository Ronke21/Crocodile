<text>Sergei Prokofiev wrote his Symphony No. 5 in B-flat major, Op. 100, in the Soviet Union in the summer of 1944.

==Background==
From 1925 onward, Prokofiev’s status as a composer grew, with his 1942Piano Sonata No. 7 receiving the Stalin Prize (Second Class). Prior to composing his Fifth Symphony, Prokofiev relocated to Moscow as a result of his increasing reliance on financial support from the Soviet Union and their threat of revoking their contributions. 

The creation of the Fifth Symphony can be traced to musical ideas explored during the composition of Prokofiev&#x27;s earlier work, particularly the Symphony No. 4 in C major composed fourteen years prior. Prokofiev incorporated these musical motifs into a piano score over less than a month during his stay at The Composers&#x27; House in Ivanovo, under the background of the Soviet Union’s involvement in World War II.

He gave out in a statement at the time of the work&#x27;s premiere that he intended it as &quot;a hymn to free and happy Man, to his mighty powers, his pure and noble spirit.&quot; He added, &quot;I cannot say that I deliberately chose this theme. It was born in me and clamoured for expression. The music matured within me. It filled my soul.&quot;

==Movements==

The piece is in four movements, lasting 40–45 minutes:
# Andante (in B-flat major)
# Allegro marcato (in D minor)
# Adagio (in F major)
# Allegro giocoso (in B-flat major)

===Movement I===
The first movement is in a tightly argued sonata form: its exposition presents two themes, one calm and sustained, the other soaring with tremolo accompaniment from strings, which are then involved in an elaborate and climactic development section. The movement is wrapped up with an electrifying coda punctuated by a roaring tam-tam and low piano tremolos.

The second movement is an insistent scherzo in Prokofiev&#x27;s typical toccata mode, framing a central theme in triple time.

&lt;/score&gt;

===Movement IV===
The finale starts with a cello choir playing a slow introduction recalling the first theme of the first movement, which then launches into the movement proper, a rondo. The playful (&quot;giocoso&quot;) main theme is contrasted with two calmer episodes, one introduced by the flute, the other a chorale in the strings. Just as the movement is striving to end with a victorious tone, the music degenerates into a frenzy (rehearsal mark 111), which is stripped down to a string quartet playing staccato &quot;wrong notes&quot; (rehearsal mark 113) with rude interjections from low trumpets, making the ultimate orchestral unison on B-flat sound all the more ironic.

==Instrumentation==
The work is scored for the following:
==Premiere==
The symphony was premiered on January 13, 1945, in the Great Hall of Moscow Conservatory by the USSR State Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Prokofiev himself.

As he took the stage, artillery fired. He paused until it finished. This left a great impression upon the audience, who upon leaving the Great Hall learned the gunfire marked the Red Army&#x27;s crossing of the Vistula into Germany. The premiere was very well-received, and the symphony has remained one of the composer&#x27;s most popular works.

Then, in November of that year, Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra introduced the score to America and recorded it in Boston&#x27;s Symphony Hall on February 6 and 7, 1946, for RCA Victor, using an optical sound film process introduced by RCA in 1941; it was initially issued on 78-rpm discs and later on LP and CD. The symphony&#x27;s rapid insertion into the repertoire was referenced by Dennis Dobson in his review of the 1951 Edinburgh Festival for Music Survey, where he panned the work as &quot;noisy, uncouth&quot; and a &quot;falling off in maturity&quot; from works such as &quot;Chout&quot; and the Piano Concerto No. 3 and went on to say, &quot;that this work is well thought of and much played in both America and the Soviet Union speaks sociological and cultural volumes&quot;.

<text>Ronald Brooks Kitaj (; October 29, 1932 – October 21, 2007) was an American artist who spent much of his life in England.

==Life==
He was born in Chagrin Falls, Ohio, United States. His Hungarian father, Sigmund Benway, left his mother, Jeanne Brooks, shortly after he was born and they were divorced in 1934. His mother was the American-born daughter of Russian-Jewish immigrants. She worked in a steel mill and as a teacher. She remarried in 1941, to Dr Walter Kitaj, a Viennese refugee research chemist, and Ronald took his surname. His mother and stepfather were non-practicing Jews. He was educated at Troy High School (New York). He became a merchant seaman with a Norwegian freighter when he was 17 and travelled by boat to Havana and Mexico.

He studied at the Akademie der bildenden Künste in Vienna and the Cooper Union in New York City. After serving in the United States Army for two years, in France and Germany, he moved to England to study at the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art in Oxford (1958–59) under the G.I. Bill, where he developed a love of Cézanne, and then at the Royal College of Art in London (1959–61), alongside David Hockney, Derek Boshier, Peter Phillips, Allen Jones and Patrick Caulfield. Richard Wollheim, the philosopher and David Hockney remained lifelong friends. He lived in California from 1967–68 and became friends with Robert Creeley and painter Jess Collins.

Kitaj married his first wife, Elsi Roessler, in 1953; they had a son, screenwriter Lem Dobbs, and adopted a daughter, Dominie. Elsi committed suicide in 1969. After living with Sandra Fisher for 12 years, he married her in December 1983 and they had one son, Max. Sandra Fisher died in 1994, at age 47, from acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (not an aneurysm, as is commonly written). Kitaj had a mild heart attack in 1990. He died in Los Angeles in October 2007, eight days before his 75th birthday. Seven weeks after Kitaj&#x27;s death, the Los Angeles County coroner ruled that the cause of death was suicide by suffocation.

==Career==

Kitaj settled in England, and through the 1960s taught at the Ealing Art College, the Camberwell School of Art and the Slade School of Art. He also taught at the University of California, Berkeley in 1968. He staged his first solo exhibition at Marlborough New London Gallery in London in 1963, entitled &quot;Pictures with commentary, Pictures without commentary&quot;, in which text included in the pictures and the accompanying catalogue referred to a range of literature and history, citing Aby Warburg&#x27;s analysis of symbolic forms as a major influence.

===&quot;School of London&quot;===
He curated an exhibition for the Arts Council at the Hayward Gallery in 1976, entitled &quot;The Human Clay&quot; (an allusion to W. H. Auden&#x27;s lines &#x27;To me Art&#x27;s subject is the human clay, / And landscape but a background to a torso … &#x27;), including works by 48 London artists, such as William Roberts, Richard Carline, Colin Self and Maggi Hambling, championing the cause of figurative art at a time when abstract was dominant. In an essay in the controversial catalogue, he invented the phrase the &quot;School of London&quot; to describe painters such as Frank Auerbach, Leon Kossoff, Francis Bacon, Lucian Freud, Euan Uglow, Michael Andrews, Reginald Gray, Peter de Francia and himself.

===Style and influence===
Kitaj had a significant influence on British pop art, with his figurative paintings featuring areas of bright colour, economic use of line and overlapping planes which made them resemble collages, but eschewing most abstraction and modernism. Allusions to political history, art, literature and Jewish identity often recur in his work, mixed together on one canvas to produce a collage effect. He also produced a number of screen-prints with printer Chris Prater. He told Tony Reichardt, manager of the Marlborough New London Gallery, that he made screen-prints as sketches for his future paintings. From then onwards Tony Reichardt commissioned Chris Prater to print three or four copies of every print he made on canvas. His later works became more personal.

Kitaj was recognised as being one of the world&#x27;s leading draftsmen, almost on a par with, or compared to, Degas. Indeed, he was taught drawing at Oxford by Percy Horton, whom Kitaj claimed was a pupil of Walter Sickert, who was a pupil of Degas; and the teacher of Degas studied under Ingres. Meanwhile art historian Edgar Wind encouraged him to become a &#x27;Warburgian artist&#x27;. His more complex compositions build on his line work using a montage practice, which he called &#x27;agitational usage&#x27;. Kitaj often depicts disorienting landscapes and impossible 3D constructions, with exaggerated and pliable human forms. He often assumes a detached outsider point of view, in conflict with dominant historical narratives. This is best portrayed by one his best-known works, &quot;The Autumn of Central Paris (After Walter Benjamin)&quot; (1972–73).

Kitaj staged a major exhibition at Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1965, and a retrospective at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, D.C. in 1981. He selected paintings for an exhibition, &quot;The Artist&#x27;s Eye&quot;, at the National Gallery, London in 1980. In 1981 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member and became a full Academician in 1984.

===Later years===
In his later years, he developed a greater awareness of his Jewish heritage, which found expression in his works, with reference to the Holocaust and influences from Jewish writers such as Kafka and Walter Benjamin, and he came to consider himself to be a &quot;wandering Jew&quot;. In 1989, Kitaj published &quot;First Diasporist Manifesto&quot;, a short book in which he analysed his own alienation, and how this contributed to his art. His book contained the remark: &quot;The Diasporist lives and paints in two or more societies at once.&quot; And he added: &quot;You don&#x27;t have to be a Jew to be a Diasporist.&quot;

A second retrospective was staged at the Tate Gallery in 1994. Critical reviews in London were almost universally negative. British press savagely attacked the Tate exhibit, calling Kitaj a pretentious poseur who engaged in name dropping. Kitaj took the criticism very personally, declaring that &quot;anti-intellectualism, anti-Americanism, and anti-Semitism&quot; had fueled the vitriol. Despite the bad reviews, the exhibition moved to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and afterwards to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1995. His second wife, Sandra Fisher died from hyperacute haemorrhagic leuco-encephalitis in 1994, shortly after his exhibition at the Tate Gallery had ended. He blamed the British press for her death, stating that &quot;they were aiming for me, but they got her instead.&quot; David Hockney concurred and said that he too believed the London art critics had killed Sandra Fisher. Kitaj returned to the US in 1997 and settled in Los Angeles, near his first son. &quot;When my Wife died&quot;, he wrote to Edward Chaney, &quot;London died for me and I returned home to California to live among sons and grandsons – It was a very good move and now I begin my 3rd and (last?) ACT! hands across The Sea.&quot; Three years later he wrote: &quot;I grow older every day and rather like my hermit life.&quot; The &quot;Tate War&quot; and Sandra&#x27;s death became a central themes for his later works: he often depicted himself and his deceased wife as angels. In &quot;Los Angeles No. 22 (Painting-Drawing)&quot; the beautiful young (and naked) girl records the shadow of her aged lover (on whose lap she sits) in a pose directly taken from the Scots Grand Tourist David Allan&#x27;s &quot;Origin of Painting&quot;. The latter was included by Ernst Gombrich in his 1995 National Gallery exhibition (and catalogue) on &quot;Shadows&quot; so that Kitaj would have seen it two years before he left England for ever.

In 1997 Kitaj exhibited his work &quot;Sandra Three,&quot; an installation of paintings, photographs and text that stretched across an entire wall of the gallery at the Royal Academy&#x27;s Summer Exhibition. Kitaj used the Academy&#x27;s Summer Exhibition to showcase this sequence of works that dealt with the events of the &quot;Tate War&quot; and Sandra&#x27;s death and even included a graffiti inscription stating &#x27;The Critic Kills&#x27;.

In 2000, Kitaj was one of several artists to make a Post-it note for an internet charity auction held by 3M to celebrate the 20th anniversary of their product. The charcoal and pastel piece sold for $925, making it the most expensive post-it note in history, a fact recorded in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;. Kitaj was elected to the Royal Academy in 1991, the first American to join the Academy since John Singer Sargent. He received the Golden Lion at the Venice Biennale in 1995. He staged another exhibition at the National Gallery in 2001, entitled &quot;Kitaj in the Aura of Cézanne and Other Masters&quot;.

In 2007, Kitaj published his &quot;Second Diasporist Manifesto&quot; with Yale University Press and died one month later.

In September 2010, Kitaj and five British artists including Howard Hodgkin, John Walker, Ian Stephenson, Patrick Caulfield and John Hoyland were included in an exhibition entitled &quot;The Independent Eye: Contemporary British Art From the Collection of Samuel and Gabrielle Lurie,&quot; at the Yale Center for British Art.

In October 2012 a major international symposium was held in Berlin to mark what would have been Kitaj&#x27;s 80th birthday. It accompanied &quot;Obsessions&quot;, the first comprehensive exhibition of Kitaj&#x27;s work since his death, held at the Jewish Museum, Berlin. The title is partly in reference to what he dubbed his &quot;erratic Jewish obsessions&quot;. The exhibition was shown in the UK in two parts at Pallant House Gallery, Chichester (February 23 to June 16, 2013) and the Jewish Museum London (February 21 to June 16, 2013).

&quot;All Too Human: Bacon, Freud and a Century of Painting Life&quot; opened at Tate Britain in February 2018, inspired by Kitaj&#x27;s School of London.

<text>Edwin van der Sar (; born 29 October 1970) is a Dutch football executive and former professional player who played as a goalkeeper. He was most recently the chief executive of Ajax, with whom he began his senior playing career in the early 1990s; he is considered to be a member of the club&#x27;s golden generation and was part of the Ajax team that won the UEFA Champions League in 1995. In 1999, he left Ajax for Juventus where he spent two years before moving to England, first to Fulham and then to Manchester United in 2005. There he won a second Champions League title in 2008, making him one of just eight players at the time to have won the competition with more than one club. He retired as a professional in 2011, but briefly came out of retirement in 2016 to play a match for Dutch amateur team VV Noordwijk, for whom he had previously played as a youth. He played 130 times for the Netherlands national team, and was the nation&#x27;s most-capped player until 2017, when he was overtaken by Wesley Sneijder.

Van der Sar is considered by critics and fellow players as one of the best goalkeepers of all time. He is also one of the most successful footballers ever, having won 26 major trophies in his career, mainly at Ajax and Manchester United. During the 2008–09 season, he set a world record by not conceding a league goal for 1,311 minutes. He is also the oldest player to win the Premier League, having done so in 2011 at the age of 40 years and 205 days. Van der Sar has won several individual awards, including Best European Goalkeeper in 1995 and 2009, and UEFA Club Goalkeeper of the Year in 2009.

==Club career==
===Ajax===
Born in Voorhout, Van der Sar began his career at his hometown club, Foreholte, and then VV Noordwijk. At a relatively late age, he was brought to the attention of Louis van Gaal, and subsequently signed for Ajax. Even though he joined late he went into the reserve team and bided his time before getting his first-team call-up by Louis van Gaal. He enjoyed a long and successful stint in their senior side, winning the 1991–92 UEFA Cup (albeit only as the reserve, making no appearances in the run) and the 1994–95 UEFA Champions League (by now the starting goalkeeper), as well as the 1995 Best European Goalkeeper award, besides domestic honours. He was in goal for Ajax in the 1996 UEFA Champions League Final, but had to make do with a runner-up medal as they lost the penalty shoot-out against Juventus. He made a total of 226 appearances for Ajax, and scored a penalty for Ajax to complete an 8–1 victory over De Graafschap in the 1997–98 season. In his first full season as Ajax No. 1 he won the Dutch Football Goalkeeper of the Year, he would then go on to retain the award for the next three consecutive years.

===Juventus===
In 1999, Van der Sar&#x27;s stature as one of Europe&#x27;s top goalkeepers drew attention from Manchester United, who sought a replacement for Peter Schmeichel; however, Van der Sar moved to Italian club Juventus for a fee believed to be in the region of £5 million. He made his debut for The Old Lady in the 1–1 draw with Reggina at the Stadio delle Alpi. He became the first non-Italian to keep goal for the Turin club.

He was the first-choice goalkeeper during his first two seasons in Italy, making 66 Serie A appearances as Juventus finished runners-up in the league twice under Carlo Ancelotti, with the best defensive record in the league on each occasion. He performed well in his first season, winning the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup, and helping the club compete for the Serie A title. On the final day of the 1999–2000 season, however, Juventus lost to Perugia, after Van der Sar was beaten by Alessandro Calori&#x27;s volley; the result allowed Lazio to overtake Juventus and win the league title by a single point. The following season was less successful, however, as Juventus suffered a first-round exit in both the Coppa Italia and the Champions League, while Van der Sar committed several errors, including a high-profile one in a league fixture at home against eventual Serie A champions Roma, on 6 May 2001, when he spilled Hidetoshi Nakata&#x27;s shot, allowing Vincenzo Montella to tie the game 2–2; Juventus eventually finished two points behind the league champions.

Van der Sar lost his place in the summer of 2001, after the Bianconeri purchased Italian international goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon from Parma for 100 billion lire (approximately £32.6 million), a world-record fee for a goalkeeper. Unwilling to remain as second-choice behind Buffon, Van der Sar made it clear he wished to move on after two years in Serie A.

===Fulham===

On 1 August 2001, Van der Sar opted to play in England and joined newly promoted Fulham in a shock move worth £7 million, signing a four-year contract. The following day, Van der Sar was officially unveiled by Fulham, and upon his arrival, he described the move as a &quot;nice friendly atmosphere&quot; and that he felt &quot;appreciated&quot;. He made his league debut on 18 August 2001 in a 2–3 away defeat against Manchester United. In total, he notched up 127 league appearances while at Fulham. In a game against Aston Villa in his final season at the club, he memorably saved two penalties from Juan Pablo Ángel in a 1–1 draw. His performances for the Cottagers caught the eye of Manchester United and the attention of Sir Alex Ferguson.

===Manchester United===
Van der Sar signed for Manchester United on 10 June 2005 for a reported fee of £2 million, although the exact transfer fee was undisclosed. Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson considers him the best goalkeeper to have played for the club since Peter Schmeichel.
On 5 May 2007, his penalty save from Darius Vassell helped assure a 1–0 triumph over Manchester City in the Manchester derby. The following day, Chelsea&#x27;s failure to beat Arsenal at the Emirates ensured Manchester United&#x27;s ninth Premier League trophy and Van der Sar&#x27;s first. He was also named in the 2006–07 PFA Team of the Year. Three months later, he was a catalyst in Manchester United&#x27;s 16th FA Community Shield victory, as he saved three consecutive penalties in a shoot-out after Manchester United and Chelsea played to a 1–1 draw at the end of regular time.

The 2007–08 season was Van der Sar&#x27;s best season since his arrival; he had several great performances despite a niggling groin injury. He would help United secure their second successive Premier League title on the final day and win the Champions League by saving the final penalty of the shoot-out from Nicolas Anelka.

Van der Sar signed a one-year extension to his contract with Manchester United on 12 December 2008, keeping him at the club until at least the end of the 2009–10 season.

On 27 January 2009, Van der Sar helped Manchester United set a new club and Premier League record for consecutive clean sheets – the club&#x27;s 5–0 win over West Bromwich Albion meant that they had gone 11 games and 1,032 minutes without conceding a goal, beating the previous record of 10 matches and 1,025 minutes set by Petr Čech in the 2004–05 season. He then broke the overall English league record in the club&#x27;s following game four days later, beating the previous record of 1,103 minutes, set by Steve Death of Reading in 1979. Another clean sheet, against West Ham on 8 February 2009, extended the record to 1,212 minutes, beating the British top-flight record of 1,155 minutes previously set by Aberdeen&#x27;s Bobby Clark in 1971. Finally, on 18 February 2009, Van der Sar further extended the record to 1,302 minutes, and in doing so, he broke José María Buljubasich&#x27;s single-season world record of 1,289 minutes, set in the Chilean Clausura in 2005. His clean sheet record ended on 4 March, when he made an error allowing Peter Løvenkrands of Newcastle United to score after nine minutes. In total, Van der Sar had gone 1,311 minutes without conceding in the league. These clean sheets were a major factor in United clinching their 11th Premiership title, as United won a lot of games 1–0 to clinch the title ahead of Liverpool. With a total of 21 clean sheets he also won the Premier League Golden Glove for 2008–09. However, he missed out on winning his third Champions League winners medal as United succumbed to a 2–0 defeat at the hands of Barcelona in the final of the tournament on 27 May 2009. Nevertheless, he won Best European Goalkeeper award from UEFA for the second time, 14 years after he first won it at Ajax. He was one of the five United players shortlisted for the PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year award, which was ultimately given to his United teammate Ryan Giggs; however, Van der Sar was named in the PFA Team of the Year.

Van der Sar sustained a finger injury during the Audi Cup pre-season tournament, forcing him to miss the first 12 matches of Manchester United&#x27;s 2009–10 season. On 6 October 2009, Van der Sar returned to action for United, playing 90 minutes in the reserves against Everton. On 17 October 2009, he returned to action in the first team, playing in United&#x27;s 2–1 victory over Bolton Wanderers. On 21 November 2009, Van der Sar would suffer injury again and be kept out of action for 12 games, with the combination of the Dutchman&#x27;s wife suffering a brain haemorrhage just before Christmas. On 16 January 2010, Van der Sar returned to action in a 3–0 win over Burnley.

Van der Sar signed a one-year extension to his current contract with Manchester United on 26 February 2010, keeping him at the club until at least the end of the 2010–11 season.
On 23 December 2010, British press reported that Sir Alex Ferguson had confirmed Van der Sar would retire at the end of the 2010–11 Premier League season. Although he denied the reports at the time, Van der Sar confirmed on 27 January 2011 it was now his intention. On 12 March, Van der Sar was named Man of the Match against Arsenal in the FA Cup after making several fine saves. United won the match 2–0 with goals from Wayne Rooney and Fabio. He was included in the PFA Team of the Year, making his third appearance there, others in 2007 and 2008.

On 22 May 2011, he played his final game at Old Trafford in a 4–2 victory over Blackpool, resulting in Blackpool&#x27;s relegation from the Premier League. He captained United as a farewell treat. His last game for United was against Barcelona in the 2011 UEFA Champions League Final on 28 May, which United lost 3–1; at 40 years, 211 days he was the oldest male player to feature in a European Cup final in the Champions League era, with Dino Zoff holding the all-time record at 41 years, 86 days, when he appeared in the 1983 European Cup Final. Following the match, Van der Sar retired from active football.

==International career==
Van der Sar was included in the Netherlands&#x27; 1994 World Cup squad but did not play. He had to wait until 7 June 1995 for his international debut, against Belarus. He was in goal for three successive eliminations from major competitions by penalties: Euro 96, the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000. The Netherlands failed to qualify for the 2002 World Cup after competing with Portugal and the Republic of Ireland and so during all of his career with the Netherlands, he had missed one tournament.

===1998 World Cup===
Van der Sar backstopped the Netherlands to the semi-finals of the 1998 FIFA World Cup, where they were eliminated by Brazil 4–2 on penalties after a 1–1 draw. In the third-place playoff, Netherlands lost to upstart Croatia 2–1.

In the quarter-finals against Argentina, Van der Sar confronted Ariel Ortega after Ortega received a yellow card for a dive in the penalty area; the Argentine was then sent off for headbutting Van der Sar. Shortly after Ortega&#x27;s red card, Dennis Bergkamp scored the winning goal in Netherlands&#x27; 2–1 victory.

===Euro 2000===
Van der Sar started the Netherlands&#x27; first two group games at UEFA Euro 2000, but suffered an injury in the closing stages of their 3–0 win over Denmark and was replaced by Sander Westerveld for the final group match against France. Van der Sar returned for the quarter-finals, but was again replaced by Westerveld after 65 minutes, by which point the Netherlands had a 4–0 lead. Van der Sar kept another clean sheet in the semi-final against Italy, resulting in a goalless draw after Frank de Boer and Patrick Kluivert both failed to score from the penalty spot in regulation time. The match went to a penalty shoot-out, and although Van der Sar saved the effort from Italy captain Paolo Maldini, the Netherlands scored just one of their four kicks and lost 3–1. Van der Sar finished the tournament without conceding a single goal, but was left out of the Team of the Tournament in favour of France&#x27;s Fabien Barthez and Italy&#x27;s Francesco Toldo.

===Euro 2004===
During the penalty shoot-out after the Euro 2004 quarter-final against Sweden, Van der Sar saved a penalty from Olof Mellberg, as the Netherlands won the shoot-out 5–4 and advanced to the semi-finals, where they lost to hosts Portugal.

===2006 World Cup===

Prior to the 2006 World Cup group match against Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Van der Sar had not conceded a goal in nine consecutive competitive matches. As captain of the Netherlands, he broke Frank de Boer&#x27;s record of all-time caps for his country in the 2006 World Cup second-round match against Portugal.

===Euro 2008===

On his 37th birthday, Van der Sar was interviewed by Radio 538 and stated that he intended to retire from international football after Euro 2008. Prior to the tournament, he was instrumental in bringing an end to a long-time dispute between veteran striker Ruud van Nistelrooy and manager Marco van Basten. He was the captain in their impressive 3–0 victory over Italy on 9 June 2008, and also on 13 June for the 4–1 victory over France. On 21 June, he played in the 3–1 quarter-final loss against Russia, which was believed to be his final international. This was his 16th appearance in a European Championship finals match, with which he equalled the record set by Lilian Thuram a few days earlier. Along with 22 other players Van der Sar was named in the team of the tournament. Following Euro 2008, Van der Sar had the distinction of playing more minutes at the European Football Championship than any other player.

===2010 FIFA World Cup qualification===
On 3 October 2008, at the urging of new coach Bert van Marwijk, Van der Sar agreed to come out of international retirement for the Netherlands&#x27; 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification matches against Iceland and Norway after injuries to Maarten Stekelenburg and Henk Timmer made both unavailable for the two games. Van der Sar kept a clean sheet in both matches, which were won by the Dutch 2–0 and 1–0 respectively. In Oslo, the Dutch defeated Norway 1–0 courtesy of a Mark van Bommel goal, thus ensuring a fitting send-off for Van der Sar who earned his 130th cap during that match, a record for a Dutch player, and put him in the top forty most capped players of all time. He remained the Dutch team&#x27;s most capped player until Wesley Sneijder surpassed him in 2017.

==Style of play==
Regarded as one of the greatest and most complete keepers in football history, Van der Sar was a large, athletic, yet slender goalkeeper, who excelled at coming off his line to handle crosses due to his height and physique; an intelligent goalkeeper, in addition to his reflexes, excellent positional sense, and shot-stopping abilities, he was also known for his calm composure, longevity, and his ability to organise his defence. Furthermore, he was also effective at stopping penalties. However, Van der Sar was known in particular for his skill with the ball at his feet, as well as his accurate distribution with either foot, which gave him the ability to launch counter-attacks from his area with long balls, or build attacking plays by playing the ball out from the back on the ground. Due to his ability in possession of the ball, and to rush off his line, he also functioned as a &quot;sweeper-keeper&quot; on occasion throughout his career, in particular during his time with Ajax.

==Post-playing career==

On 3 August 2011, a testimonial was played at the Amsterdam Arena in honour of Van der Sar. The match featured the goalkeeper&#x27;s &quot;dream team&quot;, consisting of Wayne Rooney, John Heitinga, Louis Saha, Rio Ferdinand, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Nemanja Vidić, André Ooijer, Dirk Kuyt, Gary Neville, Michael Carrick, Edgar Davids, Giovanni van Bronckhorst, Boudewijn Zenden, and Dennis Bergkamp, with Alex Ferguson as manager. They faced the current Ajax first team, led by Frank de Boer.

Prior to this match two shorter matches took place. One featured the Ajax and Manchester United youth teams, and another one featured Ajax&#x27;s 1995 squad against the Netherlands national team of 1998. The Ajax squad featured among others Finidi George, Nwankwo Kanu, Frank de Boer, Winston Bogarde, Nordin Wooter, Ronald de Boer, Danny Blind, Patrick Kluivert, Marc Overmars and Frank Rijkaard, and was managed by Louis van Gaal. The Netherlands squad featured among others Wim Jonk, Dennis Bergkamp, Roy Makaay, Ruud Hesp, Aron Winter, Richard Witschge and Pierre van Hooijdonk, and was managed by Guus Hiddink.

The viewership numbers in the Netherlands alone peaked at 2 million and it had a 26% total market share. The income generated by the match was to be donated to two charities (Make a Wish Foundation and Laureus); it generated so much money, however, that Van der Sar announced afterwards he would be starting his own charitable foundation to help spend the money.

During the event, it was announced that Van der Sar would be working as an analyst for the Nederlandse Omroep Stichting covering the 2011–12 UEFA Champions League. Van der Sar&#x27;s son, Joe, made written comments stating his father would be working as a goalkeeping coach at Ajax within five years. Van der Sar himself said he did not want to make a full commitment to this, but confirmed it was likely and he was interested in building up his coaching career slowly, starting at the lower levels.

On 27 May 2012, Van der Sar participated in the Soccer Aid 2012 Match, playing for the Rest of the World side in the first half, making a full-length save from John Bishop. He was replaced at half-time by comedian Patrick Kielty. He also took part in the Soccer Aid 2014 match on 8 June 2014, again playing for the Rest of the World side in the first half before being once again replaced at half time by Patrick Kielty.

Van der Sar took on a role as Ajax&#x27;s marketing director on 19 November 2012. He was promoted in late 2016 to the role of CEO.

On 12 March 2016, Van der Sar made a brief return to football to play a single match for his former youth club VV Noordwijk. Noordwijk, playing in the amateur fifth tier, had suffered an injury crisis. He saved a penalty and conceded a goal in the match as they drew 1–1 with Jodan Boys.

In May 2023, he resigned as Ajax CEO.

==Personal life==
Van der Sar and his wife Annemarie van Kesteren have two children. The couple&#x27;s wedding ceremony took place at the Beurs van Berlage in Amsterdam, on 20 May 2006. Van der Sar&#x27;s son, Joe, was on the pitch celebrating when his father saved a penalty in the Netherlands&#x27; 5–4 shoot-out victory over Sweden in the quarter-finals of UEFA Euro 2004. In December 2009, Van Kesteren was admitted to the hospital just two days before Christmas, reports said she had suffered a suspected brain haemorrhage and was in a &quot;very poor&quot; condition. Van der Sar was granted indefinite leave following his wife&#x27;s collapse, and it is understood that she has made a good recovery, with no long-term effects.

In July 2023, Van der Sar was admitted to intensive care in hospital after suffering a brain haemorrhage. He was discharged from the unit two weeks later.

<text>Alice Faye (born Alice Jeanne Leppert; May 5, 1915 – May 9, 1998) was an American actress and singer. A musical star of 20th Century-Fox in the 1930s and 1940s, Faye starred in such films as &quot;On the Avenue&quot; (1937) and &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot; (1938). She is often associated with the Academy Award–winning standard &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Know&quot;, which she introduced in the 1943 musical film &quot;Hello, Frisco, Hello&quot;.

She left her career as a film actress and became known for her role on the radio show &quot;The Phil Harris-Alice Faye Show&quot;.

== Life and career ==
===1915–1933: Early life and career beginnings===
Alice Jeanne Leppert was born on May 5, 1915, in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, Manhattan, the daughter of Alice (&quot;née&quot; Moffit), who worked for the Mirror Chocolate Company, and Charles Leppert, a police officer. She had an older brother, Charles. Faye was raised an Episcopalian. Faye&#x27;s entertainment career began in vaudeville as a chorus girl. She failed an audition for the &quot;Earl Carroll Vanities&quot; when she was found to be too young. She then moved to Broadway and secured a featured role in the 1931 edition of &quot;George White&#x27;s Scandals&quot;. By this time, Faye had adopted her stage name and first reached a radio audience on Rudy Vallée&#x27;s &quot;The Fleischmann&#x27;s Yeast Hour&quot;.

===1934–1938: Early work===
Faye gained her first major film break in 1934, when Lilian Harvey abandoned the lead role in a film version of &quot;George White&#x27;s Scandals (1934 film)&quot;, in which Vallee was also to appear. Hired first to perform a musical number with Vallee, Faye ended up as the female lead. She became a popular film star for audiences of the 1930s, particularly when Fox production head Darryl F. Zanuck made her his protégée. He softened Faye from a wisecracking showgirl to a youthful, and yet somewhat motherly figure, such as her roles in a few Shirley Temple films. Faye received a physical makeover, going from a version of Jean Harlow to a wholesome appearance, in which her platinum hair and pencil-line eyebrows were swapped for a more natural look. 
Faye was cast as the female lead in &quot;In Old Chicago&quot; (1938). Zanuck initially resisted casting Faye, as the role had been written for Jean Harlow, but critics applauded Faye&#x27;s performance. The film contained a 20-minute finale, a recreation of the Great Chicago Fire, a scene so dangerous that women, except for the main stars, were banned from the set. In the film, she appeared with two of her most frequent co-stars, Tyrone Power and Don Ameche, as it was customary for studios to pair their contract players together in more than one film. 

Faye, Power, and Ameche were reunited for the 1938 release &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot;, which was designed to showcase more than 20 Irving Berlin songs; Faye again received strong reviews. One of the most expensive films of its time, it also became one of the most successful musicals of the 1930s.

===1939–1940===
By 1939, Faye was named one of the top-10 box-office draws in Hollywood. That year, she made &quot;Rose of Washington Square&quot; with Tyrone Power. Although a big hit, the film was supposedly based on the real life of comedian Fanny Brice, who sued Fox for stealing her story. 

Because of her bankable status, Fox occasionally placed Faye in films more for the sake of making money than showcasing Faye&#x27;s talents. Films such as &quot;Tail Spin&quot; and &quot;Barricade&quot; (both 1939) were more dramatic than regular Faye films, and often did not contain any songs. Due to her immense popularity, though, none of the films that she made in the 1930s and 1940s lost money; this success garnered her the nickname &quot;Queen of Fox&quot;.

One of Faye&#x27;s most memorable parts was the title role in the musical biopic &quot;Lillian Russell&quot; (1940). Faye always named this film as one of her favorites, though it was also her most challenging role. The tight corsets Faye wore for this picture caused her to collapse on the set several times. 

After declining the lead role in for &quot;Down Argentine Way&quot; (also 1940) because of an illness, Faye was replaced by the studio&#x27;s newest musical star, Betty Grable. She was paired as a sister act opposite Grable in the film &quot;Tin Pan Alley&quot; (also 1940). During the making of the picture, a rumor arose that a rivalry had arisen between the two. In a &quot;Biography&quot; interview, Faye disclosed that the Fox publicity department built up the rumor, and that the two actresses were in fact close friends.

===1941–1995: Later work===

In 1941, Fox began to place Faye in musicals photographed in Technicolor, a trademark for the studio in the 1940s. She frequently played a performer, often one moving up in society, allowing for situations that ranged from the poignant to the comic. Films such as &quot;Week-End in Havana&quot; (1941) and &quot;That Night in Rio&quot; (1941), in which she played a Brazilian aristocrat, made good use of Faye&#x27;s husky singing voice, solid comic timing, and flair for carrying off the era&#x27;s starry-eyed romantic story lines. 

In 1943, after taking a year off to have her first daughter, Faye starred in the Technicolor musical &quot;Hello, Frisco, Hello&quot;. Released during World War II, the film became one of her highest-grossing pictures for Fox. In this film, Faye sang &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Know&quot;. The song won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for 1943, and the sheet music for the song sold over a million copies. Since a clause in her contract (as was the case with most other Fox stars) stated that she could not officially record any of her movie songs, other singers, such as Dick Haymes (whose version hit number one for four weeks), Frank Sinatra, and Rosemary Clooney have been more associated with the song than Faye. However, it is still often considered Faye&#x27;s signature song. That year, Faye was once again named one of the top box-office draws in the world.

== End of motion picture career ==

As Faye&#x27;s star continued to ascend during the war years, family life became more important to her, especially with the arrival of a second daughter, Phyllis. After her birth, Faye signed a new contract with Fox to make only one picture a year, with the option of a second one, to give Faye a chance to spend more time with her family. Her second pregnancy resulted in a hospitalization, forcing her to surrender a plum dramatic role in &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; to Joan Blondell, and she declined a musical role in &quot;The Dolly Sisters&quot; (her intended part went to June Haver).

Faye finally accepted the lead role in &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; (1945). Although designed ostensibly as Faye&#x27;s vehicle, Zanuck tried to build his new protégée Linda Darnell, ordering many of Faye&#x27;s scenes cut and those of Darnell&#x27;s emphasized. When Faye saw a screening of the final cut—with her role reduced by 12 scenes and a song number—she wrote a scathing note to Zanuck, went straight to her car, gave her dressing room keys to the studio gate guard, and drove home, vowing never to return to Fox. Faye was still so popular that thousands of letters were sent to Faye&#x27;s home and the Fox studios from around the world, begging her to return for another picture. In 1987, she told an interviewer, &quot;When I stopped making pictures, it didn&#x27;t bother me because there were so many things I hadn&#x27;t done. I had never learned to run a house. I didn&#x27;t know how to cook. I didn&#x27;t know how to shop. So all these things filled all those gaps.&quot;

After &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;, Faye&#x27;s contract called for her to make two more movies. Zanuck hit back by having her blackballed for breach of contract, effectively ending her film career, although Faye no longer cared to pursue it. &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; was Faye&#x27;s last starring film. Zanuck, under public pressure, tried to lure Faye back onto the screen; Faye returned all the scripts. 

Alice Faye did return to Fox later, for a character role in a remake of an old Fox property, &quot;State Fair&quot; (1962). While she received good reviews, the film was not a success. She made only infrequent cameo appearances in films thereafter, playing a secretary in &quot;Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood&quot; (1976) and in &quot;The Magic of Lassie&quot; (1978) as a waitress.

Faye was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; for British television in 1984, when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at Hollywood&#x27;s Metromedia Studios.

== Marriage and radio career ==
Faye&#x27;s first marriage, to Tony Martin in 1937, ended in divorce in 1940; both had busy careers that made it difficult for them to have opportunities for togetherness. In May 1941, she married bandleader Phil Harris. Their marriage, one of the most successful in Hollywood, became a plotline in the hit radio comedy, &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;, where for 16 years Harris was a regular cast member. 

The couple had two daughters, Alice (b. 1942) and Phyllis (b. 1944), along with Harris&#x27;s adopted son from his first marriage, Phil Harris, Jr. (1935–2001). Faye and Harris began working in radio together as Faye&#x27;s film career declined. First, they teamed to host a variety show on NBC, &quot;The Fitch Bandwagon&quot;, in 1946. The Harrises&#x27; gently tart comedy sketches made them the show&#x27;s stars. By 1948, Fitch was replaced as sponsor by Rexall, the pharmaceutical company, and the show, now a strictly situation comedy with a music interlude each from husband and wife, was renamed &quot;The Phil Harris-Alice Faye Show&quot;.

Harris&#x27;s comic talent was already familiar through his tenure on Jack Benny&#x27;s radio shows for Jell-O and Lucky Strike. From 1936 to 1952, he played Benny&#x27;s wisecracking, jive-talking, hipster bandleader. With their own show revamped to a sitcom, bandleader-comedian Harris and singer-actress Faye played themselves, raising two precocious children in slightly zany situations, mostly involving Harris&#x27;s band guitarist Frank Remley (Elliott Lewis), obnoxious delivery boy Julius Abruzzio (Walter Tetley, familiar as nephew Leroy on &quot;The Great Gildersleeve&quot;), Robert North as Faye&#x27;s fictitious deadbeat brother, Willie, and sponsor&#x27;s representative Mr. Scott (Gale Gordon), and usually involving bumbling, malaproping Harris needing to be rescued by Faye.

The Harrises&#x27; two daughters were played on radio by Jeanine Roose and Anne Whitfield; written mostly by Ray Singer and Dick Chevillat; the show stayed on NBC radio as a fixture until 1954.

Faye&#x27;s singing ballads and swing numbers in her honeyed contralto voice was a regular highlight of the show, as was her knack for tart one-liners equal to those of her husband. The show&#x27;s running gags also included references to Alice&#x27;s wealth from her film career (&quot;I&#x27;m only trying to protect the wife of the money I love&quot; was a typical Harris drollery), and occasional barbs by Faye aimed at her rift with Zanuck, usually referencing &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;.

In its early years, the Harris-Faye radio show ranked among the top-10 radio programs in the country. The radio show also provided Faye with the perfect balance between show business and home life; since radio only required her to be present for a read-through and the live broadcast, Faye was still able to spend most of her time at home with her daughters.

== Later life and death ==
She supported Adlai Stevenson&#x27;s campaign during the 1952 presidential election and Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election.

Faye and Harris continued various projects, individually and together, for the rest of their lives. In 1974, Faye made a return to Broadway after 43 years in a revival of &quot;Good News&quot;, with her old Fox partner John Payne (who was replaced by Gene Nelson). In later years, Faye became a spokeswoman for Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, promoting the virtues of an active senior lifestyle. The Faye-Harris marriage endured 54 years until Harris&#x27;s death in 1995. Faye admitted in an interview that when she married Harris, most of the Hollywood elite had predicted the marriage would only last about six months. 

Three years after Phil Harris&#x27;s death, Alice Faye died of stomach cancer in Rancho Mirage, California, four days after her 83rd birthday. She was cremated and her ashes rest beside those of Phil Harris at the mausoleum of the Forest Lawn Cemetery (Cathedral City) near Palm Springs, California. She has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in recognition of her contribution to Motion Pictures at 6922 Hollywood Boulevard. In 1994, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to her. &quot;The Phil Harris-Alice Faye Show&quot; remains a favorite of old-time radio collectors.

== Popularity and legacy ==
Her voice, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in her obituary, was &quot;inviting&quot;. Irving Berlin was once quoted as saying that he would choose Faye over any other singer to introduce his songs, and George Gershwin and Cole Porter called her the &quot;best female singer in Hollywood in 1937&quot;. During her years as a musical superstar (from the 1930s to the early 1940s), Alice Faye managed to introduce 23 songs to the Hit Parade. She was the first female crooner and equivalent to Bing Crosby.Although Faye has had fans around the globe, she was never more popular than in Great Britain and in &quot;The Alice Faye Movie Book&quot; an article is devoted to Faye&#x27;s popularity there. The author, Arthur Nicholson, mentions how enormously popular she was even in her Harlow days and though other films shown in England were usually shown for three days a week, Faye&#x27;s films played for an entire week. After Faye retired in 1945, her reissued films made as much money (in some cases, more) as current releases. When Faye returned to the screen for &quot;State Fair&quot; in 1962, the film broke records in England.

<doc id="685912" wikidata="Q798992" url="?curid=685912" title="Rebadging">
<text>In the automotive industry, rebadging is a form of market segmentation used by automobile manufacturers around the world. To allow for product differentiation without designing or engineering a new model or brand (at high cost or risk), a manufacturer creates a distinct automobile by applying a new &quot;badge&quot; or trademark (brand, logo, or manufacturer&#x27;s name/make/marque) to an existing product line.

Rebadging is also known as &quot;rebranding&quot; and badge engineering; the latter is an intentionally ironic misnomer in that little or no actual engineering takes place. The term originated with the practice of replacing an automobile&#x27;s emblems to create an ostensibly new model sold by a different maker. Changes may be confined to swapping badges and emblems, or may encompass minor styling differences, as with cosmetic changes to headlights, taillights, front and rear fascias, and even outer body skins. More extreme examples involve differing engines and drivetrains. The objective is &quot;to spread the huge development costs of a new vehicle over as many cars as possible&quot;. An example is General Motors&#x27; rebadging of the Camaro as the Firebird, a successful model from the 1960s through to the 2000s. In most cases, consumers are interested in each brand&#x27;s focus &quot;on the unique elements of styling and driving characteristics&quot;. Some cars would not be marketed without the cost savings that are obtained from this practice, and carmakers can develop many &quot;different models – all wearing different badges – off the one platform&quot;.

In several countries including Japan, manufacturers often use the phrase &quot;OEM supply&quot; or &quot;OEM-supplied&quot; to denote vehicles that are a rebadged model from or for other manufacturers.

Although platform sharing can often involve rebadging and rebranding, it can extend further, as the design may be used across multiple configurations. For example, a single platform may underpin a sedan, hatchback, or SUV/CUV body designs.

Automotive industry rebadging can be compared with white-label products in other consumer goods industries, such as consumer electronics and power tools.

==History==
The first case of badge engineering appeared in 1917 with the Texan automobile assembled in Fort Worth, Texas, that made use of Elcar bodies made in Elkhart, Indiana.

&quot;Probably the industry&#x27;s first example of one car becoming another&quot; occurred in 1926 when Nash Motors&#x27; newly introduced smaller-sized Ajax models were discontinued in 1926 after over 22,000 Ajax cars were sold during the brand&#x27;s inaugural year. The chairman and CEO of the company, Charles W. Nash, ordered that the Ajax models be marketed as the &quot;Nash Light Six&quot;, Nash being a known and respected automobile brand. Production was stopped for two days so Nash emblems, hubcaps, and radiator shells could be exchanged on all unshipped Ajax cars. Conversion kits were also distributed at no charge to Ajax owners to transform their cars and protect the investment they had made in purchasing an automobile made by Nash.

Starting with the beginning of General Motors in 1909, chassis and platforms were shared with all brands. GMC, which historically was a truck builder, began to offer its products branded as Chevrolet, and vehicles produced by GM were built on common platforms shared with Chevrolet, Oakland, Oldsmobile, Buick, and Cadillac. Exterior appearances were gradually upgraded between these vehicle brands. This was partly because all bodywork was provided by Fisher Body which was bought by GM in 1925, and the introduction of the Art and Color Section in 1928, directed by Harley Earl. For the 1958 model year, GM was promoting its fiftieth year of production and introduced anniversary models for each brand; Cadillac, Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Chevrolet. The 1958 models shared an almost identical appearance on all models for each brand and made special luxury models with a shared appearance; Cadillac Eldorado Seville, Buick Limited Riviera, Oldsmobile Starfire 98, Pontiac Bonneville Catalina, and the Chevrolet Bel-Air Impala.

A later example was Wolseley Motors after it was bought out by William Morris. After World War I, &quot;Wolseley started to lose its identity and eventually succumbed to badge engineering.&quot; This was repeated with the consolidation of Austin Motor Company and the Nuffield Organization (parent company of Morris Motors) to form the British Motor Corporation (BMC). The rationalization of production to gain efficiencies &quot;did not extend to marketing&quot;, and each &quot;model was adapted, by variation in trim and accessories, to appeal to customer loyalties for whom the badge denoting the company of origin was an important selling advantage ... &#x27;Badge Engineering&#x27;, as it became known, was symptomatic of a policy of sales competition between the constituent organizations&quot;. The ultimate example of BMC badge engineering was the 1962 BMC ADO16 which was available badged as a Morris, MG, Austin, Wolseley, Riley and the upmarket Vanden Plas. A year earlier, the Mini was also available as Austin, Morris, Riley, and Wolseley – the latter two having slightly bigger boots.

==Examples==

=== Regional brands ===
Badge engineering often occurs when an individual manufacturer (such as the regional Big Threes of the United States, Europe, and Japan) owns a portfolio of different brands and markets the same car under different brands and nameplates. The practice is used for multiple reasons. In one example, a company may do so to expand its range of different brands in a market without the cost of developing completely new models. In the United States, General Motors may sell a car through each brand; for example, the Chevrolet Tahoe, GMC Yukon, and Cadillac Escalade each share a common body.

In another example, the same model is rebadged when it is sold in different regions and markets. In Australia, during the 1980s and 1990s, the Button car plan required imported Nissans and Toyotas to adopt Ford and Holden (GM) nameplates. In the United Kingdom, Opel-produced vehicles are marketed under the Vauxhall brand; when sold in the United States, Opels were marketed as Saturns, Chevrolets, and Buicks. Conversely, the Australian Holden brand was never sold in North America, but the Holden Monaro and Holden Commodore were sold under the Pontiac (Pontiac GTO, Pontiac G8), Chevrolet (Chevrolet SS), and Buick (Buick Regal Sportback/Buick Regal TourX) nameplates.

=== Brand expansion ===
Another way badge engineering may occur is when two separate manufacturers trade products, filling gaps in their respective product lineups. During the 1990s, Honda and Isuzu entered into such an agreement, with Isuzu marketing the first-generation Honda Odyssey as the Isuzu Oasis as its first minivan. In return, Honda received the Isuzu Rodeo and Isuzu Trooper SUVs, which became the Honda Passport and Acura SLX; the agreement allowed both Honda and Isuzu to enter new vehicle segments without the cost of engineering an all-new vehicle design (at the same time, in Europe, the Honda Crossroad was a rebadged Land Rover Discovery).

During the late 2000s and early 2010s, the Volkswagen Routan was a rebranded version of the Dodge Grand Caravan, supplied as Volkswagen sought to re-enter the North American minivan segment without the investment of federalizing its design. Assembled by Chrysler with a Chrysler powertrain, the Routan received its own styling and content features as well as a standard &quot;sportier suspension and steering&quot;.

=== Distribution networks (Japan) ===
In Japan, automobile manufacturers differed in the marketing of their product ranges. In contrast to marketing a single vehicle under multiple brand names (with minor changes to exterior bodywork), Japanese manufacturers marketed vehicles through multiple sales networks, with a distinct vehicle being sold under various model nameplates (from a single manufacturer).

Toyota marketed the Corolla in Japan exclusively at &quot;Toyota Corolla Store&quot; locations; at &quot;Toyota Auto Store&quot; locations, it was named the Toyota Sprinter. Nissan sold the Nissan Cedric through its &quot;Nissan Bluebird Store&quot; network, with the identical Nissan Gloria through the &quot;Nissan Prince Store&quot; network. Honda previously marketed the Honda Accord through multiple sales networks, marketing the Accord through the &quot;Honda Clio&quot; network and renaming it as the Honda Vigor for &quot;Honda Verno&quot; locations (conversely, the Vigor was renamed the Honda Inspire for the Clio network).

The practice of producing multiple versions of the same vehicle would eventually lead to distinct vehicles produced for export. In North America, the Toyota Sprinter was marketed as the Chevrolet Nova (and the Geo Prizm that replaced it). The Honda Vigor and Inspire were marketed as the Acura Vigor and TL; Nissan sold the Gloria in the United States as the Infiniti M45.


=== Joint ventures ===
Two automakers can also pool resources by operating a joint venture to create a product and then selling each as their own. For example, General Motors and Toyota formed NUMMI. The vehicles produced from this venture (though not necessarily at NUMMI itself) included the Toyota Sprinter/Chevrolet Prizm, and later the Toyota Matrix/Pontiac Vibe. In another agreement, Ford and Nissan developed and produced the Mercury Villager and Nissan Quest minivans from 1993 through 2002.

Another example was the cooperative work between Volkswagen and Ford to develop the VW Sharan, Ford Galaxy, and SEAT Alhambra.

Badge engineering may occur when one company allows another, otherwise unaffiliated, company to market a revised version of their product through an OEM deal, as with Volkswagen marketing a modified version of the Dodge Caravan and Chrysler Town and Country minivans as the Volkswagen Routan (2009–2014).

Another example was the joint venture of Mitsubishi and Chrysler that resulted in vehicles produced by Diamond-Star Motors that were marketed under various nameplates from 1985 until 1993.

==== China ====
In China, foreign manufacturers were required to form a joint venture with a local manufacturer to manufacture automobiles in the country. Prior to 2022, the Chinese government dictates that no more than two joint ventures are allowed for each foreign investor. Larger foreign manufacturers often set up two joint ventures to maximize the market reach, including Toyota (FAW Toyota and GAC Toyota), Ford (JMC-Ford and Changan Ford), Volkswagen (SAIC-VW and FAW-VW) and Honda (Dongfeng Honda and Guangqi Honda). To distribute the production and sales rights to each joint venture, manufacturers often resort to a similar strategy deployed in Japan: simply producing the exact model under two different names with minor changes to exterior bodywork.

GAC Toyota has produced the Levin as a twin model to the FAW Toyota-built Corolla and the Wildlander as the alternative to the RAV4. Honda awarded several models to two joint ventures, which spawned the Breeze from the original CR-V, the Elysion from the Odyssey, the XR-V from the HR-V, and others.

In other cases, foreign manufacturers may also rebadge a model developed by its partner, sometimes for exports to other markets. Examples include the second generation Chevrolet Captiva which is an export version of the Baojun 530 made by SAIC-GM-Wuling, or the Ford Territory, a reworked version of the Yusheng S330 developed by Jiangling Motors (JMC).

=== Life cycle extension ===
Badge engineering could be used as a strategy to lengthen the life cycle of a vehicle. After a product has reached the end of its life cycle, it may be transferred to another brand, mostly from the same holding company or joint venture. Examples include the SEAT Exeo, a rebadged Audi A4 B7 with reworked styling, which was built in Spain from used production tooling from the Audi plant in Ingolstadt after the A4 B7 production had ended. The tooling was dismantled from Ingolstadt and was sent to the SEAT manufacturing plant in Martorell, Spain, to be reinstalled.

Another example is the Dongfeng Fengdu MX6, which was produced after the near-identical Nissan X-Trail (T31) production had ended, and the Maruti Suzuki Zen Estilo, which is based on the then-recently discontinued Suzuki MR Wagon. The advantage of this strategy is amortized tooling costs, which means the vehicle can be produced at a higher margin of profit (or a lower price, or both).

===Luxury vehicles===
Badge engineering occurs in the luxury-type market segments. An automobile manufacturer will use a model from its mainstream brand as a basis for a model under a premium marque by upgrading its features, technology, and/or styling. Along with visible cosmetic differences, premium models may also receive upgraded drivetrains.

An example of this is that Ford Motor Company marketed its mainstream Ford Fusion mid-size sedan as the Lincoln MKZ; the Ford Expedition SUV is sold as the Lincoln Navigator. A more controversial example was the Aston Martin Cygnet, a rebadged version of the Toyota iQ city car (intended to comply with EU emissions regulations). While fitted with model-specific trim and a luggage set, the Cygnet nearly tripled the price of the iQ. Alternatively, VW Group under Ferdinand Piëch used the reverse of this in some circumstances, engineering the more luxurious model first and then remove features for models from less prestigious marques. Examples include the Lamborghini Gallardo/Audi R8 and the Audi A4/Volkswagen Passat.

=== Platform sharing ===
Along with rebadging and badge engineering, platform sharing is common throughout the automotive industry. Alongside a shared chassis (though unibody construction is nearly universal in cars and many light trucks), platform sharing also standardizes components such as drivetrain, suspensions, components, and other technologies. General Motors used the B platform for many of its non-Cadillac full-size vehicles (nearly exclusively from 1959 through 1985), while Chrysler used its B platform for intermediates and its C platform for (non-Imperial) full-size cars.

The Volkswagen Group uses platform sharing as its business strategy to improve its profitability and growth. For example, Audi uses components from their more pedestrian counterparts, sold as Volkswagen mass-market brands. As an effort to place Audi as a &quot;premium&quot; marque, Volkswagen often introduces new technologies in Audi-branded cars before fitting them to mainstream products (such as the Direct-Shift Gearbox). In production, platform sharing is used extensively, with the modular MQB platform underpinning a range of vehicles from the Audi A1 to the Volkswagen Atlas. The previous D platform of the 2000s was used for the Volkswagen Phaeton and Bentley Continental GT (built in steel) and the Audi A8 (built in aluminum).

In the Japanese automotive industry, platform sharing has expanded model offerings in North America. While the initial Lexus LS was developed specifically for the American market, the later Lexus ES has shared a platform (but not a body) with the Toyota Camry (since 2013, the Toyota Avalon, itself also based on the Camry). Exclusive primarily to North America, Honda uses a common platform to produce the American version of the Odyssey minivan, also underpinning the Honda Pilot and Honda Passport SUVs, the Acura MDX CUV, and the Honda Ridgeline mid-size pickup truck.

==Problems and controversy==
Although intended to save development costs by spreading design and research costs over several vehicles, rebadging can also become problematic if not implemented properly. Using multiple car brands under a single-parent manufacturer can significantly increase selling costs, as each model line must be marketed separately, requiring a distinct dealership network. Inappropriate use of rebadging can also hurt overall sales by resulting in &quot;cannibalism&quot; between two or more brands owned by the same company by failing to develop a distinct image for each brand or by allowing the market failure of one version of a model to carry over to its rebadged model counterparts.

Through the 2000s, the American Big Three automakers reduced their brand footprint by closing or selling underperforming brands. After 2001, Chrysler discontinued its Plymouth brand (following the closure of Eagle in 1998). In response to the late 2000s recession, Ford ended its ownership of Jaguar, Land Rover, Aston Martin, and Volvo Cars; in 2010, Mercury was closed by Ford. General Motors underwent several brand revisions; following the discontinuation of the Geo sub-brand of Chevrolet in 1997, Oldsmobile was closed after 2004 (the oldest American nameplate at the time). Following its 2009 bankruptcy, GM closed Pontiac, Saturn, and Hummer in 2010; Saab was sold (eventually leading to its demise). GM sold its European Opel and Vauxhall brands in 2017 to PSA (now Stellantis).

=== GM X/H platform compacts ===
In response to the 1973 oil crisis, General Motors expanded fuel-efficient offerings beyond its Chevrolet division, reintroducing compact cars to its Buick, Oldsmobile, and Pontiac brands. Derived from the X-platform Chevrolet Nova, the Pontiac Ventura was introduced for the 1971 model year, with the Buick Apollo and Oldsmobile Omega introduced for 1973. These four X-platform vehicles (also known as N-O-V-A from the first letters of their model names) were produced with identical bodies with divisional differences marked only with specific grille, lamp, and body trim variations.

To expand its footprint in the subcompact segment, the H-body Chevrolet Vega platform was used for the 1975 model year for newly styled variants sold as the Chevrolet Monza, Buick Skyhawk, and Oldsmobile Starfire followed by the 1976 Pontiac Sunbird. Similarly, to the X-body vehicles, the H-body subcompacts shared common bodies across all four divisions with differing grille, lamp, and body trim variations.

=== GM divisional engines ===
Prior to 1981, the majority of General Motors vehicles were produced with engines designed by their respective divisions. From 1981 onward, GM ended its policy of divisionally-developed engines, instead offering engines under a singular GM brand. As an exception, Cadillac offers division-exclusive engines (the Northstar and Blackwing V8 engine families).

In 1981, GM lost a 1977 lawsuit related to consumers (who purchased 1977 Oldsmobile Delta 88s equipped with a Chevrolet small-block engine instead of the Oldsmobile V8 engine). At the time of production, GM had downsized its full-size model lines in preparation for another oil crisis and had increased production of V6 engines as the intended standard engine, underestimating consumer demand for Oldsmobile V8 engines. To accommodate the increased market demand, nearly 60% of Delta 88s were equipped with a Chevrolet 5.7 L V8 for 1977. The lawsuit was filed by the state of Illinois, claiming GM falsely advertised the vehicles. In 1981, GM settled the lawsuit with the vehicle buyers and discontinued their company-unique policy of division-specific engines. Into the 1990s, GM advertising featured a disclaimer stating &#x27;&quot;Oldsmobiles (or any other GM division) are equipped with engines manufactured by various GM divisions, subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide.&quot;&#x27;

=== Lincoln Versailles and Cadillac Cimarron ===

Prior to the mid-1970s, the American luxury brands Lincoln and Cadillac offered model lines consisting entirely of full-size two-door and four-door sedans and full-size personal luxury cars. At the beginning of the decade, European automakers began to market their largest sedans as luxury vehicles in North America. Though the BMW Bavaria/3.0Si, Jaguar XJ6/XJ12, and Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W116) were priced similar to the Cadillac Sedan de Ville and Lincoln Continental, the model lines were thousands of pounds lighter and multiple feet shorter in length (with only the hand-built Rolls-Royce Phantom V rivaling Lincoln and Cadillac in size). In response to both the 1973 oil crisis and to regain lost market share, both Cadillac and Lincoln introduced smaller vehicles for their brand. In one of the most controversial uses of rebranding in automotive history, both vehicles were derived from smaller GM and Ford divisional model ranges. 

For the 1977 model year, Lincoln released the Lincoln Versailles to match the debut of the Cadillac Seville. In contrast with the Seville (sharing its chassis underpinnings both the Chevrolet Nova and the Chevrolet Camaro), the Versailles shared nearly its entire body with the Mercury Monarch (itself a counterpart of the Ford Granada); the model line also replaced the previous Mercury Grand Monarch Ghia. Outsold by the Seville nearly three-to-one, the Versailles sold far under sales predictions and was discontinued early in the 1980 model year. 

For 1982, Cadillac released the Cadillac Cimarron to compete against compact European-brand executive sedans. The smallest Cadillac produced since the 1900s, the Cimarron used the chassis of the GM J-body four-door sedan. Developed and brought to market less than a year before the J-body was released, Cadillac was left with almost no time to distinguish the Cimarron from its divisional counterparts from Chevrolet, Buick, Oldsmobile, and Pontiac. Though sharing nearly its entire exterior with the four-door Chevrolet Cavalier, the Cimarron was priced nearly twice as high as its counterpart. Additionally, J-body vehicles from other divisions could be equipped nearly identically to the Cimarron for a lower cost. Though the model line closely matched its Buick Skyhawk and Oldsmobile Firenza counterparts in sales, the Cimarron was discontinued following the 1988 model year.

Though the Lincoln Versailles was largely forgotten after its 1980 discontinuation (its role superseded by the downsizing of the Lincoln Continental for 1982), the Cimarron would cause extensive damage to the Cadillac brand, as its market share declined by almost 50% from 1980 to 1998. As of current production, neither Lincoln nor Cadillac has marketed a compact-segment car. Through the use of rebranding, Lincoln produced the mid-size Lincoln MKZ (sharing its doors with the Ford Fusion; as part of its 2013 redesign, no other exterior panels); Cadillac rebranded the Opel Omega B as the Cadillac Catera as its first mid-size car, but replaced it, eventually moving towards platform sharing with other divisions. 

===GM A-platform ===
From 1982 until 1986, the front-wheel drive A platform underpinned the Chevrolet Celebrity, Cutlass Ciera, Pontiac 6000, and Buick Century. As part of their legacy, the A-bodies became enormously popular – as well as synonymous with one of GM&#x27;s most transparent examples of badge engineering: they were simultaneously presented, almost indistinguishably, on the 22 August 1983 cover of Forbes magazine as examples of genericized uniformity, embarrassing the company and ultimately prompting GM to recommit to design leadership.

=== Eagle (Chrysler) ===


In 1987, Chrysler Corporation acquired American Motors Corporation (AMC) from Renault, leading to the exit of the latter company from the North American market. As part of the sale, Chrysler obtained the AMC dealership network, the AMC Eagle line of all-wheel drive cars, and the Jeep line of sport-utility vehicles and pickup trucks. For 1989, Chrysler established the Jeep-Eagle Division in a strategy to both focus on Jeep and offer specialty cars differentiated from the established Chrysler lines. 

Following the retirement of the AMC Eagle Wagon in early 1988 (derived from the 1971 AMC Hornet), Eagle established its product line with the introduction of the 1988 Premier and Medallion (developed by Renault prior to the sale of AMC). To expand the product range beyond the two sedans, Chrysler sourced vehicles from Mitsubishi, introducing the 1989 Summit (Dodge/Plymouth Colt) and 1990 Talon (Mitsubishi Eclipse). In contrast to the Jeep range, Eagle was marketed towards consumers interested in imported vehicles.

For 1992, the Eagle Vision full-size sedan replaced the Premier, becoming the first Eagle-brand vehicle developed by Chrysler. Positioned between the Dodge Intrepid and Chrysler Concorde, the Eagle Vision shared most exterior trim with the Concorde. It was the only Chrysler LH car offered exclusively with a five-passenger interior.

Coinciding with the 1998 Daimler-Chrysler merger, the Eagle brand was discontinued; the singular Jeep brand was integrated as part of Chrysler or Dodge dealership networks. The Chrysler 300M was originally developed as a second generation of the Eagle Vision; following the discontinuation of Eagle, the vehicle continued into production as a Chrysler model, adopting a slightly restyled grille, Chrysler badging, and a Chrysler interior.

=== Lexus ES250 and Infiniti M30 ===

For the 1989 model year, Toyota and Nissan introduced the Lexus and Infiniti luxury brands in the United States (following the Acura luxury brand of Honda) with the all-new Lexus LS400 and Infiniti Q45 full-size sedans. Both brands expanded their model line for 1990, sourcing an existing model line from the Japanese market to rebrand as an entry-level offering. 

The Lexus ES250 is a four-door sedan derived from the V20 Toyota Camry. Though visibly similar to the Camry introduced for 1987, the ES250 was a rebranded Toyota Camry Prominent/Vista; a model developed for Japan, the Prominent/Vista (dependent on sales network) is a four-door pillared hardtop sedan with a slightly lower roofline and restyled body panels. Along with the change to left-hand drive, the ES250 adopted an interior similar to the larger LS (along with similarly styled wheels and taillamps). 

The Infiniti M30 is a two-door notchback coupe derived from the Nissan Leopard (a model never sold in North America). Along with the coupe, Infiniti sold the M30 as a two-door convertible (converted in the United States). With the exception of its badging and its dashboard (sourced from the left-hand drive Nissan Skyline), the M30 differed from the Leopard primarily in its steering wheel location. 

Intended largely as placeholder models, the ES250 and M30 were largely overshadowed by their companion flagship sedans. Following the end of the 1992 model year, both models were withdrawn (as their Japanese counterparts had ended their model cycles). For 1993, the ES250 was replaced by the ES300; while again sharing its body with a Japanese-market Toyota (Toyota Vista/Windom) and its chassis and engine with the Camry, the ES300 shared no resemblance to the American-market Camry. Infiniti moved away from a two-door coupe entirely, replacing the M30 with the four-door J30 (Nissan Leopard J Ferie in Japan).

=== Rover CityRover ===
The Rover CityRover, launched in 2003 as the last vehicle from the MG Rover Group, was a rebadged Tata Indica made in India. English motoring journalist George Fowler criticized the MG Rover Group, which was enjoying national sympathy from the British public as the last domestically owned automobile manufacturer, stating the CityRover was &quot;a duplicitous attempt to &#x27;save Rover&#x27; by flogging an Indian car on which the only Rover bits were the badges&quot;.

==Models produced under license==
A variant of rebadging is licensing models to be produced by other companies, typically in another country. The earliest such vehicle was the Austin 7 (1922–1939), designed and built by Austin Motor Company and licensed to other manufacturers across continents, which became their first-ever model. The Bantam in the US that would eventually build the first Jeep, BMW in Germany, and Nissan in Japan.

Among the post-war cars, the Fiat 124 designed and built by Fiat, Italy was licensed to various other manufacturers from different countries. It became a dominant car in many Eastern Europe and West Asian countries.

The Morris Oxford Series IV built by Morris of England in 1955 would become Hindustan Ambassador in India and was manufactured until 2014. Another example of this is the British Hillman Hunter, which was license-built in Iran as the Paykan, as well as Naza, building vehicles under license from Kia and Peugeot (Naza 206 Bestari).

A similar example of licensed badge-engineered products would be the Volga Siber, a rebadged version of the Chrysler Sebring sedan and the Dodge Stratus sedan produced in Russia from 2008 until 2010.

<text>The Hood River, formerly known as Dog River, is a tributary of the Columbia River in northwestern Oregon, United States. Approximately long from its mouth to its farthest headwaters on the East Fork, the river descends from wilderness areas in the Cascade Range on Mount Hood and flows through the agricultural Hood River Valley to join the Columbia River in the Columbia River Gorge.

It rises in three separate forks on the north side of Mount Hood, within the Mount Hood Wilderness in Hood River County which is approximately east of Portland.

==West Fork==
The West Fork, approximately long, rises on northwestern Mount Hood from Ladd Glacier. It flows generally east-northeast and joins the East Fork from the west near Dee.

==Middle Fork==
The Middle Fork, approximately long, rises in several short branches on the north slopes of Mount Hood, from Coe Glacier and Eliot Glacier. It flows north through the upper Hood River Valley.

==East Fork==
The East Fork, approximately long, rises on the eastern side of the mountain in the Mount Hood National Forest in the Mt. Hood Meadows Ski area fed by Newton-Clark Glacier, and flows northward into the Upper Hood River Valley, where it is joined by the Dog River and then by the Middle Fork.

==Main stem==
The combined main stem river, approximately long, flows northeast through the Hood River Valley. It joins the Columbia at Hood River, a popular destination for windsurfing and kiteboarding in the Columbia Gorge.

==History==

The maps of the Lewis and Clark Expedition show the Hood River under the name Labeasche River after Francis Labiche, one of the expedition&#x27;s members. In the mid-19th century pioneer era a party of starving travelers resorted to eating dog meat. As a result, the Hood River became known as the Dog River. This name was unpopular. A pioneer resident of the area, Mrs. Nathaniel Coe, was able to change local usage to Hood River, after Mount Hood. The name Hood River appeared on maps as early as 1856. The older Dog River name became attached to a lesser tributary of the East Fork Hood River.

Powerdale Dam built in the early 1920’s on the Lower Hood River once supplied nearly 6 MW of hydro power. Built by PacificCorp, Powerdale dam was fully removed in Summer of 2010. The Old Powerhouse still stands as a historical/visual reminder of hydro generation on the Hood River. PacificCorp donated 400 acres of surplus land between the former Powerdale Dam and the Old Powerhouse downstream in 2013 to Hood River County (101 acres) and Columbia Land Trust (299 acres) to be a fully protected riparian buffer. Other conservation successes have occurred along the Hood River and its tributaries. The 12 foot high Odell Creek Dam on Odell Creek was removed by September 2016. Farmers continue to upgrade/screen irrigation diversions for the protection of the Columbia River Fisheries. All indications point to a healthier and improved salmon and steelhead fishery on the Hood River thanks to continued efforts of Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW), local interests, and collaborative efforts with the Warm Springs Tribe.

<text>Medicine Lake Volcano is a large shield volcano in northeastern California about northeast of Mount Shasta. The volcano is located in a zone of east–west crustal extension east of the main axis of the Cascade Volcanic Arc and the Cascade Range. The thick shield is from east to west and from north to south, and covers more than . The underlying rock has downwarped by under the center of the volcano. The volcano is primarily composed of basalt and basaltic andesite lava flows, and has a caldera at the center.

The Medicine Lake shield rises about above the Modoc Plateau to an elevation of . Lavas from Medicine Lake Volcano are estimated to be at least in volume, making Medicine Lake the largest volcano by volume in the Cascade Range (Newberry Volcano in Oregon has the second largest volume). Lava Beds National Monument lies on the northeast flank of the volcano.

Medicine Lake Volcano has been active for 500,000 years. The eruptions were gentle rather than explosive like Mount St. Helens, coating the volcano&#x27;s sides with flow after flow of basaltic lava. Medicine Lake is part of the old caldera, a bowl-shaped depression in the mountain. It is believed that the Medicine Lake volcano is unique, having many small magma chambers rather than one large one.

The Medicine Lake Highlands are largely managed by the United States Forest Service as part of Klamath, Shasta–Trinity, and Modoc National Forests. In 2025, President Joe Biden established Sáttítla Highlands National Monument to protect the area from development.

==Caldera==
Medicine Lake is in the caldera of the volcano, which measures . The caldera may have formed by collapse after a large volume of andesite was erupted from vents along the caldera rim. The distribution of late Pleistocene vents, mostly concentrated along the rim, suggests that ring faults already existed when most of the andesite erupted. No single large eruption has been related to caldera formation. The only eruption recognized to have produced ash flow tuff occurred in late Pleistocene time, and this eruption was too small to account for formation of the caldera. Later conclusions were that Medicine Lake caldera formed by collapse in response to repeated extrusions of mostly mafic lava beginning early in the history of the volcano (perhaps in a manner similar to the formation of Kilauea caldera in Hawaii). Several small differentiated magma bodies may have been fed by and interspersed among a network of dikes and sills. Late Holocene andesitic to rhyolitic lavas were derived by fractionation, assimilation, and mixing from high alumina basalt parental magma. The small lake from which Medicine Lake volcano derives its name lies within the central caldera.

==Eruptive history==

===Early history===
Medicine Lake Volcano began to grow about one million years ago in Pleistocene time, following the eruption of a large volume of tholeiitic high-alumina basalt. Similar high-alumina basalt has continued to erupt around the volcano throughout its history. Although mafic lavas predominate on the volcano&#x27;s flanks, all lava compositions from basalt to rhyolite have erupted during Pleistocene time. The lower flanks consist of mostly basaltic and some andesitic lavas. Basalt is mostly absent at higher elevation, where andesite dominates and rhyolite and small volumes of dacite are present. During the past 11,000 years, eruptive activity at Medicine Lake Volcano has been episodic. Eight eruptions produced about of basaltic lava during a time interval of a few hundred years about 10,500 years ago. That eruptive episode was followed by a hiatus that ended with a small andesitic eruption about 4,300 years ago. During the most recent eruptive episode between 3000 and 900 years ago, eight eruptions produced approximately of lava ranging in composition from basalt to rhyolite. Late Holocene lava compositions include basalt and andesite, but silicic lavas dominate.

Eruptive activity during Holocene time has included numerous rhyolite and dacite lava flows erupted at high elevations inside and outside the caldera; cinder cones and associated lava flows of basalt and basaltic andesite have resulted from eruptions at vents on the flanks of the shield. Most vents are aligned along zones of crustal weakness that trend northeast to northwest.

=== Glass Mountain ===

The most recent eruption occurred around 1,000 years ago when rhyolite and dacite erupted at Glass Mountain and associated vents near the caldera&#x27;s eastern rim. Fitch cites reports that a light ash fall that occurred in 1910 may have come from a small eruption at Glass Mountain. No field evidence has been found to substantiate the 1910 eruption.

Glass Mountain consists of a spectacular, nearly treeless, steep-sided rhyolite and dacite obsidian flow that erupted just outside the eastern caldera rim and flowed down the steep eastern flank of Medicine Lake Volcano. Ten additional small domes of Glass Mountain rhyolite and rhyodacite lava lie on a N25degreesW trend to the north and one to the south. The age of Glass Mountain and its preceding pumice deposits has been a matter of discussion for some time. A radiocarbon dating age of 885±40 years before present (1990) was obtained on a dead incense-cedar tree without limbs or bark that is preserved in the edge of one of the distal tongues of the flow. The dated material consisted of a piece of exterior wood containing about 30 annual growth rings. This age may be too old, because some of the outside of the tree is missing. The tephra deposits that precede the flow and domes may be somewhat older but are constrained to be less than about 1,050 years before present (1990) by the Little Glass Mountain and Lassen Peak data.

<text>Jason Kent Bateman (born January 14, 1969) is an American actor and director. He is known for his roles as Michael Bluth in the Fox / Netflix sitcom &quot;Arrested Development&quot; (2003–2019) and Marty Byrde in the Netflix crime drama series &quot;Ozark&quot; (2017–2022), as well as for his work in numerous comedy films. His accolades include a Golden Globe Award and a Primetime Emmy Award. 

Bateman began his career as a child actor, appearing on television in the early 1980s on shows such as the NBC drama series &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; from 1981 to 1982 and &quot;The Hogan Family&quot; from 1986 to 1991. Bateman&#x27;s early film roles include &quot;Teen Wolf Too&quot; (1987) and &quot;Necessary Roughness&quot; (1991) before taking supporting roles in &quot;The Break-Up&quot; (2006), &quot;Juno&quot; (2007), &quot;Hancock&quot; (2008), and &quot;Up in the Air&quot; (2009). Bateman took starring roles in the comedies &quot;The Switch&quot; (2010), &quot;The Change-Up&quot; (2011), &quot;Horrible Bosses&quot; (2011), &quot;Identity Thief&quot; (2013), &quot;This Is Where I Leave You&quot; (2014), &quot;Office Christmas Party&quot; (2016), &quot;Zootopia&quot; (2016), and &quot;Game Night&quot; (2018). He also played dramatic roles in &quot;The Gift&quot; (2015), &quot;The Outsider&quot; (2020), &quot;Air&quot; (2023), and &quot;Carry-On&quot; (2024).

Bateman made his directorial debut with an episode of &quot;The Hogan Family&quot;, at the time setting the record for the youngest director in the Directors Guild of America. He has since directed and starred in &quot;The Family Fang&quot; (2015) and &quot;Ozark&quot;. Bateman was awarded the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series in 2019 for his direction on &quot;Ozark&quot;.

==Early life==
Bateman was born in Rye, New York, and was four years old when his family moved to Salt Lake City, Utah, and later to California. His mother, Victoria Elizabeth, was a flight attendant for Pan Am who was originally from Shrewsbury in the United Kingdom. His father, Kent Bateman, is an American actor, writer, and director of film and television. His older sister is actress Justine Bateman.

Bateman, like many child actors, attended Brighton Hall School, without graduating. In an interview with &quot;Wired Magazine&quot;, Bateman admitted that he never received his diploma due to not finishing his finals while filming &quot;Teen Wolf Too&quot;.

Bateman and Justine&#x27;s earnings from their television shows were a significant income source for their parents, allowing the family to afford their home and other essentials. The reliance on a portion of Bateman&#x27;s earnings from acting caused him to feel anxious and under pressure to keep roles and in the acting industry as a whole. As an actor, Bateman was managed by his father until he was 20, when the business relationship was dissolved.

==Career==
===Television===
Bateman first appeared in a cereal commercial for Golden Grahams in 1980 and began his television career on &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; as James Cooper, an orphaned boy who, along with his sister, is adopted by the Ingalls family. From 1982 to 1984 he was a supporting character on the television show &quot;Silver Spoons&quot; as Ricky Schroder&#x27;s &quot;bad boy&quot; best friend Derek Taylor. He appeared in the &quot;Knight Rider&quot; third-season episode &quot;Lost Knight&quot; in 1984, and a number of other small television roles. In 1984, in response to his popularity on &quot;Silver Spoons&quot;, the show&#x27;s producers gave Bateman his own starring role as Matthew Burton on the NBC sitcom &quot;It&#x27;s Your Move&quot;, from September 1984 to February 1985. In 1987 he appeared with Burt Reynolds on the men&#x27;s team in the inaugural week of game show &quot;Win, Lose or Draw&quot;.

Bateman earned the status of teen idol in the mid-1980s for his television work, most notably as David Hogan on &quot;The Hogan Family&quot; (originally titled &quot;Valerie&quot; and later, &quot;Valerie&#x27;s Family&quot;, after Valerie Harper left the series). He became the Directors Guild of America&#x27;s youngest-ever director when, at age 18, he helmed three episodes of &quot;The Hogan Family&quot;. In 1987 he gained international recognition in the motion picture sequel &quot;Teen Wolf Too&quot;, which was a box office failure. In 1994 he played opposite Katharine Hepburn and Anthony Quinn in the television film &quot;This Can&#x27;t Be Love&quot;. During this period, he had roles on four series&quot;Simon&quot;, &quot;Chicago Sons&quot;, &quot;George &amp; Leo&quot;, and &quot;Some of My Best Friends&quot;none of which lasted longer than one season. He also directed an episode of &quot;Two of a Kind&quot; in 1999. In 2002 he played the frisky sibling of Thomas Jane&#x27;s character in the feature film &quot;The Sweetest Thing&quot;.

In 2003, Bateman was cast as Michael Bluth in the comedy series &quot;Arrested Development&quot;. Although critically acclaimed, the series never achieved high ratings and ended on February 10, 2006. The show was revived in spring 2013. Bateman won several awards for his work on the series, including a Golden Globe for &quot;Best Actor in a Television Series Musical or Comedy&quot;. He was also nominated in 2005 for the &quot;Emmy Award&quot; for Outstanding Actor in a Comedy Series. New episodes of Arrested Development have been released on Netflix with the original cast, including Bateman. Bateman performed commentary on the 2004 Democratic National Convention for &quot;The Majority Report&quot; with &quot;Arrested Development&quot; co-star David Cross, and hosted NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on February 12, 2005. In 2006 he appeared as a guest star on the &quot;Scrubs&quot; episode &quot;My Big Bird&quot; as Mr. Sutton, a garbage man with a flock of vicious ostriches as pets. In 2009 Bateman became a regular voice actor for the short-lived Fox comedy series &quot;Sit Down, Shut Up&quot;. He voiced Larry Littlejunk, the gym teacher and only staff member who can teach.

In 2010, Bateman and &quot;Arrested Development&quot; co-star Will Arnett created &quot;DumbDumb Productions&quot;, a production company focusing on digital content. Their first video was &quot;Prom Date&quot;, the first in a series of &quot;Dirty Shorts&quot; for Orbit. In 2012, Bateman returned to his role of Michael Bluth for the revival of &quot;Arrested Development&quot; along with the rest of the original cast. The now-Netflix-sponsored series released season4 on its Instant Watch website on May 26, 2013. The series was expected to continue its run as well as a potential feature film. For the new fourth season, Bateman was once again nominated for Outstanding Actor in a Comedy Series. Netflix confirmed that the entire cast of the show would be returning for a fifth season, which premiered on May 29, 2018 and concluded on March 15, 2019.

In 2017, Bateman returned to television as both actor and director in the Netflix drama &quot;Ozark&quot;, in which he plays a financial advisor who must relocate his family to Missouri in order to launder money for a Mexican drug cartel. Bateman&#x27;s performance as Marty Byrde has drawn positive comparisons to Bryan Cranston&#x27;s portrayal of Walter White in AMC&#x27;s &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;.

Bateman received praise for his acceptance speech after winning the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series for &quot;Ozark&quot;. In it he states, &quot;So I just want to say to the people that are at home and not working as frequently as they want, you&#x27;re just one job away. You&#x27;re plenty talented. Hang in there&quot;.

In 2021, Bateman played &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;″s Tim Holifield in a reenactment of the third-season episode &quot;Kids Can Be Cruel&quot; for the third edition of &quot;Live in Front of a Studio Audience&quot;.

===Film===

In 2004, Bateman appeared in &quot;&quot; as ESPN8 (&quot;The Ocho&quot;) commentator Pepper Brooks, and in &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; as Kevin, Vince Vaughn&#x27;s business partner. He reunited with Vaughn in 2006&#x27;s &quot;The Break-Up&quot;. In 2007 he played former lawyer Rupert &quot;Rip&quot; Reed alongside Ben Affleck in &quot;Smokin&#x27; Aces&quot;, and also starred in &quot;The Kingdom&quot;, &quot;Mr. Magorium&#x27;s Wonder Emporium&quot;, and &quot;Juno&quot;. In 2008 he co-starred with Will Smith and Charlize Theron in the superhero film &quot;Hancock&quot;. Bateman&#x27;s 2009 films included &quot;Extract&quot;, written and directed by Mike Judge, and &quot;Couples Retreat&quot;, reuniting with Vaughn in a comedy chronicling four couples who partake in therapy sessions at a tropical island resort (Kristen Bell played his wife). In 2010 he starred in &quot;The Switch&quot;, a romantic comedy, with Jennifer Aniston. In 2011 he played the role of Special Agent Lorenzo Zoil in the comedy &quot;Paul&quot;, and starred in &quot;Horrible Bosses&quot; and &quot;The Change-Up&quot;.

In March 2012, &quot;Mansome&quot;, Bateman&#x27;s first executive producer credit with Will Arnett, was announced as a Spotlight selection for the Tribeca Film Festival. The documentary, directed by Morgan Spurlock, is a comedic look at male identity as it is defined through men&#x27;s grooming habits, featuring celebrity and expert commentary. He made a dramatic turn in 2012 with the thriller film &quot;Disconnect&quot;, and starred in the 2013 comedy film &quot;Identity Thief&quot; and the 2014 comedies &quot;This Is Where I Leave You&quot; and &quot;Horrible Bosses 2&quot;. He also narrated the 2014 documentary &quot;Pump&quot;. In 2015 Bateman headlined Joel Edgerton&#x27;s thriller film &quot;The Gift&quot;, opposite Rebecca Hall and Edgerton. His production company Aggregate Films extended its deal with Universal.

In 2013, Bateman made his feature film directorial debut with &quot;Bad Words&quot;, in which he also starred. He also directed and starred in an adaptation of &quot;The Family Fang&quot;. Bateman voiced Nick Wilde, the con artist fox in &quot;Zootopia&quot;. In 2018 he starred in and produced the action comedy film &quot;Game Night&quot;. His performance was widely praised and he received nominations for best performance by a comedic actor at the San Diego Film Critics Society Awards and the Critics&#x27; Choice Awards.

Bateman is in the video for the Mumford and Sons song &quot;Hopeless Wanderer&quot;.

In 2020, Bateman was originally set to co-star and direct &quot;Clue&quot; with Ryan Reynolds. He has since had to back out, reportedly due to schedule conflicts with &quot;Ozark&quot;. In March 2022, Bateman signed on to direct the film &quot;Project Artemis&quot;, starring Scarlett Johansson, for Apple Studios, but departed the project in June due to creative differences; he was eventually replaced as director by Greg Berlanti. Announced in September 2022, Bateman is tapped to direct Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Dark Wire&quot;, a film based on Joseph Cox&#x27;s novel of the same name. In January 2023, Bateman signed on to direct &quot;The Pinkerton&quot; for Warner Bros. Pictures and Bad Robot, and will also serve as executive producer.

Bateman was an executive producer for &quot;Outlast&quot;, which premiered in 2023.

===Podcast===
In July 2020, Bateman, along with Will Arnett and Sean Hayes, created a comedy and talk podcast called &quot;SmartLess&quot;. In 2022, Bateman created a media company SmartLess Media in order to create four additional podcasts. In 2023, Apple revealed that SmartLess was #4 of the year&#x27;s Top Shows.

===Controversy===
Bateman, along with &quot;Arrested Development&quot; co-stars David Cross and Tony Hale, was criticized for seemingly defending Jeffrey Tambor&#x27;s volatile behavior on the set of &quot;Arrested Development&quot;. During a May 2018 cast interview for &quot;The New York Times&quot; Bateman attempted to defuse the controversy:
&quot;Again, not to belittle it or excuse it or anything, but in the entertainment industry it is incredibly common to have people who are, in quotes, &#x27;difficult&#x27;. And when you&#x27;re in a privileged position to hire people... you learn about character and you learn about work habits, work ethics, and you start to understand. Because it&#x27;s a very amorphous process, this sort of [expletive] that we do, you know, making up fake life. It&#x27;s a weird thing, and it is a breeding ground for atypical behavior and certain people have certain processes.&quot;

During the interview, Jessica Walter held back tears while speaking of Tambor (who was present), insisting that the two had made amends after the incident.
&quot;Verbally, yes, he [Tambor] harassed me, but he did apologize,&quot; she said, adding &quot;Jason says this happens all the time. But, in like almost sixty years of working, I&#x27;ve never had anybody yell at me like that on a set. And it&#x27;s hard to deal with, but I&#x27;m over it now. I just let it go right here... for &quot;The New York Times&quot;.&quot;

Within days after the interview, all three men issued apologies to Walter. Bateman retrospectively stated he had overreached in his attempt to analyze the cause of Tambor&#x27;s behavior. In an interview with &quot;Time&quot;, Bateman was quoted saying, &quot;I always thought it&#x27;s important for people to treat one another with respect at work, no matter what industry you&#x27;re in. The whole experience has allowed me to do a lot of listening, and I continue that to this day.&quot;

==Personal life==
In 1987, Bateman won the celebrity portion of the Long Beach Grand Prix.

Bateman married actress Amanda Anka, daughter of Anne de Zogheb (1942–2017) and singer Paul Anka, on July 3, 2001. They have two daughters who were born in 2006 and 2012.

Throughout the 1990s, Bateman struggled with an addiction to alcohol and drugs; he stated in a 2009 interview: &quot;I&#x27;d worked so hard that by the time I was 20, I wanted to play hard. And I did that really well... it was like &quot;Risky Business&quot; for ten years.&quot;

Bateman is a fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team.

<doc id="685923" wikidata="Q4885582" url="?curid=685923" title="Ben Edlund">
<text>Ben Edlund (; born September 20, 1968) is an American cartoonist, screenwriter, television producer, and television director. He is best known as the creator of the satirical superhero character the Tick.

==Background==
Edlund was born and raised in Pembroke, Massachusetts. He attended Silver Lake Regional High School and was voted by classmates as &quot;Most Artistic&quot; for both the 8th grade and 12th grade yearbook superlatives. At the age of 17, without a driver&#x27;s license, Edlund was forced to ride with friends and frequent their favorite hangouts. One particular destination, the New England Comics store, spawned Edlund&#x27;s interest in the comic book medium, which later launched his art and writing career.

==The Tick==
While still in high school, he began developing his satirical superhero, the Tick, who became the mascot of the New England Comics newsletter. Edlund was invited to create a comic book series based on the character by New England Comics when, due to a production mix-up, the publisher needed a new title fast. Edlund graduated from high school in 1986 and continued to draw his popular character while majoring in film at Massachusetts College of Art. The debut issue of &quot;The Tick&quot; took a year and a half for Edlund to develop.
While still in college, Edlund was approached by Kiscom, a New Jersey–based toy licensing and design company, who wanted to develop merchandising off the Tick. Sunbow Entertainment, a New York–based animation company, paired Edlund up with writer Richard Libmann-Smith. After having their premiere episode turned down by Fox, the duo got approval with a refined version.

In 1994, &quot;The Tick&quot; debuted as an animated series on Fox and lasted three seasons. The program led to various toy and merchandising deals. The limited scope of merchandising compared to other contemporaneous animated series led Edlund to express contentment in his character as a &quot;much more sincere proposal.&quot; The Tick appeared on the Fox network in late 2001 with a short-lived live-action series.

==Screenwriting==
In the late 1990s, Edlund collaborated with indie filmmaker Lisa Hammer and her husband, Eric Hammer, on the film &quot;Crawley&quot;. The Hammers later worked with him again during the creation of &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot; which draws inspiration from &quot;The Tick&quot;.

Beginning in 2002, Edlund was employed by Joss Whedon at Mutant Enemy, first as part of the original writing staff for the space/Western hybrid series &quot;Firefly&quot;, which was cancelled during its first season, and then on the final season of &quot;Angel&quot;, where he wrote and also directed the Hugo Award nominated episode, &quot;Smile Time&quot;. Edlund credits Whedon with teaching him to create television character arcs. Edlund also had a hand in creating characters for Whedon&#x27;s successful web series &quot;Doctor Horrible&#x27;s Sing-Along Blog&quot;, to which he contributed &quot;Bad Horse&quot; and the henchman sidekick &quot;Moist&quot;.

In 2005, Edlund served as co-executive producer on &quot;Point Pleasant&quot;. He also wrote the &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot; second season episode &quot;Grievous Intrigue&quot;.

Beginning in 2006, he served as executive producer, writer, and occasionally director on the TV series &quot;Supernatural&quot; from season 2 (2006–07) to season 8 (2012–13). On that show, there was a character, a writer/prophet named Chuck Shurley, who went by the pen name &quot;Carver Edlund&quot;, a combination of Edlund&#x27;s last name and that of Jeremy Carver, another &quot;Supernatural&quot; producer and writer. The writers named another important character after executive producer Robert Singer.

In 2013, Edlund left the &quot;Supernatural&quot; writing staff to join the second season of &quot;Supernatural&quot; creator Eric Kripke&#x27;s new television series, &quot;Revolution&quot;. It was cancelled after that season. He then joined &quot;Gotham&quot; as a producer and writer for the first season (2014–15). In 2015, he became a writer for the second season of the Sony PlayStation Network original series &quot;Powers&quot;.

==Podcast and radio appearances==
Edlund appeared on Ken Reid&#x27;s &quot;TV Guidance Counselor&quot; podcast on May 25, 2016.

<text>David Walsh Naughton (born February 13, 1951) is an American actor and singer. He is known for his starring roles in the horror film &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot; (1981) and the Disney comedy &quot;Midnight Madness&quot; (1980), as well as for a long-running &quot;Be a Pepper&quot; ad campaign for beverage maker Dr Pepper. He also starred in the short-lived sitcom &quot;Makin&#x27; It&quot; and sang its hit theme song &quot;Makin&#x27; It&quot;, giving him a Top 5 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts.

==Early life==
Naughton was born on February 13, 1951, in West Hartford, Connecticut, the son of Rosemary (née Walsh) and Joseph Naughton, both of whom were teachers. He is the younger of two boys; his older brother is theater and film actor James Naughton. His family is Irish-American.

Naughton attended the University of Pennsylvania and the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. He earned a soccer scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania where he studied drama and graduated in 1973. He then moved to London to further his acting training. After two years in London, he moved to New York where he worked as a waiter and pursued his acting career.

==Career==
Naughton&#x27;s professional acting debut was in the New York Shakespeare Festival&#x27;s production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; starring Sam Waterston. Naughton subsequently found steady work in various other local theater productions. He was an Assistant Stage Manager and Understudy for the Broadway production of Hugh Leonard&#x27;s &quot;Da&quot;.

Naughton first became widely known as a result of his four-year stint (1977–1981) singing and dancing in television commercials and personal appearances to promote Dr Pepper. The commercials were considered creative and wildly popular. They involved Naughton dancing and singing in a Broadway musical style while handing out bottles of the beverage to people who then followed his lead Pied Piper style. The commercials won numerous Clio awards, and involved a multitude of celebrities from Mickey Rooney and Jimmie Walker to Fred Flintstone and Popeye.

By 1981, Naughton was at the height of his success as a soft drink spokesperson, but he wanted to try other ventures and decided to end his role in the commercials. Though the main commercial stint ended in 1981, Naughton occasionally returned to the pitchman role for the soft drink. In 1988, he did a commercial for Diet Dr. Pepper that was reminiscent of the earlier commercials. In 2010, Naughton joined a flash mob singing the iconic jingle at the New York Stock Exchange.

His popularity from the commercials led to him being cast as the star of the sitcom &quot;Makin&#x27; It.&quot; In 1979, he also recorded the show&#x27;s theme song, &quot;Billboard&quot;, which was also titled &quot;Makin&#x27; It.&quot; A US million selling disc, the track also peaked at No. 44 in the UK Singles Chart. The sitcom itself was less successful and lasted only 9 episodes, but his career continued to blossom. The next year, he starred in his first film, the Disney comedy &quot;Midnight Madness&quot; (1980).

That lead role then led to a starring role in a higher profile film: &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot; (1981). The firm was directed by John Landis, who had already made a name for himself with National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House (1978) and the Blues Brothers (1980). &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot; was a comedy-horror film whose special effects and make-up (used to show the werewolf metamorphosis) were particularly innovative for their time. Rick Baker&#x27;s make-up work won the inaugural Academy Award for Best Make-up. The film was a critical and box office hit.

After the success of &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot;, Naughton continued to work steadily, but never regained the same level of success. He appeared in various lesser known movies, as well as smaller roles in numerous episodes of television shows including &quot;MacGyver&quot;, &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;JAG&quot;, and &quot;Seinfeld.&quot;

From 1986-1988, Naughton had a reoccurring role on &quot;My Sister Sam&quot; as the goofy ex-boyfriend of the series&#x27; main character, which was played by Pam Dawber. Naughton appeared in 19 episodes. The series had a strong first season, but was cancelled due to low ratings in its second season. The following year, the series co-star, Rebecca Schaefer, was murdered at her apartment by a stalker who had pursued her for three years. In the wake of the tragedy, several actors from the sitcom including Naughton did a PSA to raise awareness of handgun violence.

==Personal life==
Naughton has been married four times and divorced three times. In 2008, he was arrested for domestic violence in Henderson, Nevada.

<text>Problem Child 2 is a 1991 American black comedy film and a sequel to the 1990 film &quot;Problem Child&quot;. It follows the exploits of Junior (Michael Oliver), an adopted orphan boy who deliberately wreaks comedic havoc everywhere he goes. John Ritter returns as his adopted father, Ben Healy. Amy Yasbeck, who played Ben&#x27;s wife, Flo, in the first film, also returns, this time as school nurse Annie Young with a daughter named Trixie (Ivyann Schwan) who is also a problem child.

It was directed by Brian Levant in his feature film directorial debut and produced by Robert Simonds, who also produced the first one. In addition, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski return as screenwriters. It was rated PG-13, unlike the first one, which was rated PG. It did not fare as well as the first one, although it was still successful at the box office.

==Plot==
Ben Healy has divorced his controlling and overbearing wife, before he and his adoptive son Junior Healy move to Mortville, Oregon, a quiet community, as a way to start over. Ben is initially sad to leave Cold River until Junior reminds him that everyone there has been horrible to him his whole life. Before they arrive at their new house, Junior sees a girl roller skating on the sidewalk with a balloon. He pops it with his sling shot and laughs at her as he goes by. He and Ben arrive at their new house, and moments later, dozens of women line up in their front yard, all wanting to date Ben. Meanwhile, Ben&#x27;s father, &quot;Big Ben&quot; Healy, moves in with them when he loses all of his money in a bad investment.
When Junior starts third grade, he sees that Igor Peabody is the principal at his new school. Peabody screams at the sight of him and promptly promotes him to the sixth grade, claiming him a &quot;genius&quot;. He gets on school bully Murph&#x27;s bad side when he tapes him to the chalkboard. He retaliates by trying to drop the school&#x27;s satellite dish on Junior, but it misses him and hits Ben instead, knocking him out. When Ben comes to, he sees the school nurse, Annie Young, and becomes smitten with her. Junior, annoyed at Ben&#x27;s sudden love interest, retaliates by attempting to draw a mustache on Annie&#x27;s picture hanging in the hall, only to be foiled by Trixie, the girl whose balloon he popped earlier. Throughout the film, they engage in an escalating prank war.

Around the same time, LaWanda DuMore, the richest lady in Mortville, takes an interest in Ben, much to Junior&#x27;s chagrin. While Ben and Junior are gone for the day, she decorates their house to impress Ben. Junior ruins a dinner she makes by putting live cockroaches in it. Afterward, she tells him that when she is his stepmother she will send him to boarding school in Baghdad. He tries to tell Ben that she is bad, but Ben does not believe him.

While at a school function, Ben sees the puppet show go awry and thinks Junior is to blame. He stops it but is surprised to see it&#x27;s Trixie instead (while Junior was in the audience watching the show). It is also revealed that Annie is her mother. As Annie rushes to take her home, Ben tries to tell her he understands what it is like raising a problem child and thinks they can help one another. She tells him she likes him, but if they date, Trixie&#x27;s behavior would only get worse. He proposes to LaWanda believing she is the only woman who will marry him.
By a chance meeting at a pizza restaurant, Ben, Annie, Junior, and Trixie have dinner together and a good time, even after the food fight the kids start with Peabody and his girlfriend gets them thrown out. Junior and Trixie apologize to each other and decide that Ben and Annie should date. Junior tries to stop the wedding by switching LaWanda&#x27;s blood sample with that of a rabid dog. While celebrating her engagement to Ben, she gets icing on her face, which bears a resemblance to foaming at the mouth, a symptom of rabies. As a result, she is handcuffed by health department officers and sent to the hospital for observation. With her there, Junior overhears a patient in the room across from hers saying he wants to hold the world record for the longest nose. He sabotages her plastic surgery by switching the patient files, resulting in her receiving a gigantic nose – his attempt to make her so ugly that Ben will not marry her. However, she uses her funds to get last minute surgery to undo the damage. At the altar, Junior&#x27;s and Trixie&#x27;s work pays off, and Ben finally realizes that Annie is the one for him and Junior was telling the truth about LaWanda after LaWanda openly stated that she hates children (much to his shock). Big Ben decides to marry her, while Junior and Trixie use explosives to splatter them with the wedding cake.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film was shot on location in Orlando, Florida from January 16 to March 15, 1991, including the then newly, opened Universal Studios Florida. The &quot;Pizzariffic&quot; scene was filmed at a small, vacant restaurant on Orlando Avenue in Maitland (which became Buca di Beppo two years later). The gift shop in the opening montage is on International Drive in Orlando. At another point in the opening montage, Ben and Junior get donuts from Randy&#x27;s Donuts in Inglewood, California. The scenes for their house were filmed at 1216 Lancaster Drive in Orlando. When they are leaving Cold River at the beginning, they are driving down Atlanta Avenue in Orlando. All of the &quot;Mortville Elementary School&quot; scenes were filmed at Orlando&#x27;s Kaley Elementary School. Napasorn Thai on East Pine Street in Downtown Orlando was used for the Dunmore Bank, as evidenced by the restaurant&#x27;s unique inlaid corner windows visible in the scene. Orlando&#x27;s Harry P. Leu Gardens was used as the &quot;Love Rock&quot; backdrop for the wedding scene. The Hyatt Regency Orlando was used as the &quot;Saint Pierre Club&quot; backdrop for Ben and Debbie&#x27;s date scene.

In 2014, during an interview on Gottfried&#x27;s &quot;Amazing Colossal Podcast&quot;, screenwriters Alexander and Karaszewski revealed that the studio was reluctant to rehire them, only doing so because they wanted to shoot a sequel before Michael Oliver could noticeably grow and, as the writers of the first film, could produce a script quicker than writers new to the story and characters.

Frustrated with the criticisms of the first film, they deliberately increased the poor taste, intending to make a Pasolini or John Waters film for children, and went so far overboard that the first cut received an R rating from the MPAA, a secret kept until their 2014 appearance on the podcast. Dubbing over Junior&#x27;s use of the term &quot;pussy-whipped&quot; got a PG-13 on appeal, but the studio was still so nervous that, at the last minute, they added the 1947 Woody Woodpecker cartoon &quot;Smoked Hams&quot; to its theatrical run, to reassure parents that it was suitable for children.

==Reception==
The film did not fare as well as the first one, earning half as much at the U.S. box-office. Rotten Tomatoes reports that 7% of 27 surveyed critics gave it a positive review, with an average rating of 3.3/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Crude, rude, puerile, and pointless, &quot;Problem Child 2&quot; represents a cynical nadir in family-marketed entertainment&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave it a grade &quot;B+&quot; on scale of A to F.

&quot;Variety&quot; gave a negative review, criticizing its &quot;fingerpainted&quot; script and considered the film to be worse than its predecessor.

==TV version==
The film first aired on NBC on November 2, 1992, with 7 minutes of previously deleted scenes, an altered scene (in Peabody&#x27;s office, Junior burps rather than let out a long fart) and the profanity was dubbed with appropriate phrases.

<doc id="685936" wikidata="Q1625433" url="?curid=685936" title="Torsades de pointes">
<text>Torsades de pointes,torsade de pointes or torsades des pointes (TdP; also called torsades) (, , translated as &quot;twisting of peaks&quot;) is a specific type of abnormal heart rhythm that can lead to sudden cardiac death. It is a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that exhibits distinct characteristics on the electrocardiogram (ECG). It was described by French physician François Dessertenne in 1966. Prolongation of the QT interval can increase a person&#x27;s risk of developing this abnormal heart rhythm, occurring in between 1% and 10% of patients who receive QT-prolonging antiarrhythmic drugs.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Most episodes will revert spontaneously to a normal sinus rhythm. Symptoms and consequences include palpitations, dizziness, lightheadedness (during shorter episodes), fainting (during longer episodes), and sudden cardiac death.

== Causes ==
Torsades occurs as both an inherited (linked to at least 17 genes) and as an acquired form caused most often by drugs and/or electrolyte disorders that cause excessive lengthening of the QT interval.

Common causes for torsades de pointes include drug-induced QT prolongation and less often diarrhea, low serum magnesium, and low serum potassium or congenital long QT syndrome. It can be seen in malnourished individuals and chronic alcoholics, due to a deficiency in potassium and/or magnesium. Certain drugs and combinations of drugs resulting in drug interactions are common contributors to torsades de pointes risk. QT-prolonging medications such as clarithromycin, levofloxacin, or haloperidol, when taken concurrently with cytochrome P450 inhibitors, such as fluoxetine, cimetidine, or particular foods including grapefruit, can result in higher-than-normal levels of medications that prolong the QT interval in the bloodstream and therefore increase a person&#x27;s risk of developing torsades de pointes. A TdP cardiac event precipitated by loperamide has been reported (although the dose was well beyond the therapeutic range of the medication). 

=== Medications as causes ===
Knowledge that TdP may occur in patients taking certain prescription drugs has been both a major liability and reason for removal of 14 medications from the marketplace. Forty-nine drugs known to cause TdP and another 170 that are known to prolong QT remain on the market because the drugs provide medical benefit and the risk of TdP can be managed and mitigated by instructions in the drug label. Examples of compounds linked to clinical observations of TdP include amiodarone, most fluoroquinolones, methadone, lithium, chloroquine, erythromycin, azithromycin, pimozide, and phenothiazines. The anti-emetic agent ondansetron may also increase the risk of developing TdP. It has also been shown as a side effect of certain anti-arrhythmic medications, such as sotalol, procainamide, quinidine, ibutilide, and dofetilide. In one example, the gastrokinetic drug cisapride (Propulsid) was withdrawn from the US market in 2000 after it was linked to deaths caused by long QT syndrome-induced torsades de pointes. This effect can be directly linked to QT prolongation mediated predominantly by inhibition of the hERG channel and, in some cases, augmentation of the late sodium channel.

== Risk factors ==

The following is a partial list of factors associated with an increased tendency towards developing torsades de pointes:
* Medications
* Hypokalemia (low serum potassium)
* Hypomagnesemia (low serum magnesium)
* Hypocalcemia (low serum calcium)
* Bradycardia (slow heartbeat)
* Heart failure
* Left ventricular hypertrophy
* Hypothermia
* Subarachnoid hemorrhage
* Hypothyroidism

== Pathophysiology ==
Action potential of cardiac muscles can be broken down into five phases:
* Phase 0: Sodium channels open, resulting in the entrance of Na+ into the cells; this results in the depolarization of the cardiac muscles.
* Phase 1: Sodium channels close; this stops depolarization. Potassium channels open, leading to an outward current of K+ out of the cells.
* Phase 2: Potassium channels remain open (outward current of K+), and calcium channels now also open (inward current of Ca++), resulting in a plateau state.
* Phase 3: Calcium channels close (inward Ca++ stops), but potassium channels are still open (outward K+ current); this persists until the cells gain back normal polarization (repolarization achieved). Please note that phase 0 leads to a net gain of Na+, while phases 1–3 lead to a net loss of K+. This imbalance is corrected by the Na+/K+-ATPase channel that pumps K+ into the cell and sodium out of the cell; this does not change polarization of the cells, but does restore ionic content to its initial state.
* Phase 4: Exciting triggers (&quot;e.g.&quot; sinus node) will cause minor depolarization in the cells; this will result in increasing permeability of sodium channels, which trigger the opening of sodium channels.

Repolarization of the cardiomyocytes occurs in phases 1–3, and is caused predominantly by the outward movement of potassium ions. In Torsades de pointes, however, the repolarization is prolonged; this can be due to electrolyte disturbances (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia), bradycardia, certain drugs (disopyramide, sotalol, amiodarone, amitriptyline, chlorpromazine, erythromycin) and/or congenital syndromes.

The prolongation of repolarisation may result in subsequent activation of an inward depolarisation current, known as an early after-depolarisation, which may promote triggered activity. Re-entry, due to a dispersion of refractory periods, is also possible; this is because M Cells (found in the mid myocardial layer) show a more prolonged repolarization phase in response to potassium blockage than other cells. In turn, this produces a zone of functional refractoriness (inability to depolarize) in the mid myocardial layer. When new action potential is generated, the mid myocardial layer will remain in a refractory period, but the surrounding tissue will depolarize. As soon as the mid myocardial layer is no longer in a refractory period, excitation from nearby tissue will cause a retrograde current and a reentry circuit that will result in a positive chronotropic cycle, leading to tachycardia.

== Diagnosis ==
The ECG tracing in torsades demonstrates a &quot;polymorphic ventricular tachycardia&quot; with a characteristic illusion of a twisting of the QRS complex around the isoelectric baseline (peaks, which are at first pointing up, appear to be pointing down for subsequent &quot;beats&quot; when looking at ECG traces of the &quot;heartbeat&quot;). It is hemodynamically unstable and causes a sudden drop in arterial blood pressure, leading to dizziness and fainting. Depending on their cause, most individual episodes of torsades de pointes revert to normal sinus rhythm within a few seconds; however, episodes may also persist and possibly degenerate into ventricular fibrillation, leading to sudden death in the absence of prompt medical intervention. Torsades de pointes is associated with long QT syndrome, a condition whereby prolonged QT intervals are visible on an ECG. Long QT intervals predispose the patient to an , wherein the R-wave, representing ventricular depolarization, occurs during the relative refractory period at the end of repolarization (represented by the latter half of the T-wave). An R-on-T can initiate torsades. Sometimes, pathologic T-U waves may be seen in the ECG before the initiation of torsades.

A &quot;short-coupled variant of torsade de pointes&quot;, which presents without long QT syndrome, was also described in 1994 as having the following characteristics:
* Drastic rotation of the heart&#x27;s electrical axis
* Prolonged QT interval (LQTS) - may not be present in the short-coupled variant of torsade de pointes
* Preceded by long and short RR-intervals - not present in the short-coupled variant of torsade de pointes
* Triggered by a premature ventricular contraction (R-on-T PVC)

== R-on-T phenomenon ==
The R-on-T phenomenon is the superimposition of a premature ventricular contraction on the T wave of a preceding heart beat. Studies suggest that R-on-T phenomenon is likely to start a sustained ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. It&#x27;s considered a cardiac arrhythmia in which the ventricles of the heart become again excited during the repolarization of the previous heart action. Because part of the heart muscle cannot be excited at this early point in time, a premature chamber action can trigger life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias (e.g. ventricular fibrillation or Torsades de pointes).

On the ECG, this phenomenon is showing when a ventricular extrasystole (R) (T-wave) is superimposed during the repolarization phase of the previous action of the heart. Not all premature chamber actions can trigger these dangerous arrhythmias; the risk is increased with ischemia of the heart muscle or with prolonged repolarization time (long QT syndrome). The arrhythmia can also be triggered when an external stimulus such as cardioversion falls in the vulnerable phase of the cardiac cycle.

In the Lown grading system of ventricular arrhythmias, the R-on-T phenomenon is the fifth, most threatening class.

== Treatment ==
The treatment of torsades de pointes aims to restore a normal rhythm and to prevent the arrhythmia recurring. While torsades may spontaneously revert to a normal sinus rhythm, sustained torsades requires emergency treatment to prevent cardiac arrest. The most effective treatment to terminate torsades is an electrical cardioversion – a procedure in which an electrical current is applied across the heart to temporarily stop and then resynchronise the heart&#x27;s cells. Treatment to prevent recurrent torsades includes infusion of magnesium sulphate, correction of electrolyte imbalances such as low blood potassium levels (hypokalaemia), and withdrawal of any medications that prolong the QT interval. Treatments used to prevent torsades in specific circumstances include beta blockers or mexiletine in long QT syndrome. Occasionally a pacemaker may be used to accelerate the heart&#x27;s own sinus rhythm, and those at risk of further torsades may be offered an implantable defibrillator to automatically detect and defibrillate further episodes of the arrhythmia.

Magnesium is used in the treatment of torsades de pointes because it functions as a physiologic calcium channel blocker. By blocking the calcium channels in phase 2 of the myocardial action potential, magnesium suppresses the early afterdepolarizations that occur in this phase with calcium influx into the cell.

== History ==
The phenomenon was originally described in a French medical journal by Dessertenne in 1966, when he observed this cardiac rhythm disorder in an 80-year-old female patient with complete intermittent atrioventricular block. In coining the term, he referred his colleagues to the &quot;Dictionnaire Le Robert&quot;, a bilingual French English dictionary, of which his wife had just given him a copy. Here, &quot;torsade&quot; is defined as: 
* a bundle of threads, twisted in a helix or spiral, for ornamental purposes (such as in an Aran sweater);
* long hair twisted together;
* an ornamental motif, as seen on architectural columns.

==Terminology==
The singular and plural forms (&quot;torsade de pointes&quot;, &quot;torsades de pointes&quot;) have all often been used. The question of whether each one is grammatically &quot;correct&quot; and the others &quot;incorrect&quot; has repeatedly arisen. This is seen among major medical dictionaries, where one enters only the plural form, another enters the plural form as the headword but lists the singular as a variant, and yet another enters the singular form as the headword and gives a usage comment saying that the plural is not preferred. One group of physicians has suggested that it would make the most sense to use the singular form to refer to the arrhythmia entity (where an arrhythmia may involve one or multiple episodes), and that one might best reserve the plural form for describing repeated twisting during a single episode. Other authors have suggested all three words should be plural. Regarding the natural language variation, they concluded, in good nature, &quot;Wasn&#x27;t it the French who coined the term &quot;vive la difference&quot;?&quot;

<text>The Irish Terrier () is a dog breed from Ireland, one of many breeds of terrier. The Irish Terrier is considered one of the oldest terrier breeds. The Dublin dog show in 1873 was the first to provide a separate class for Irish Terriers. By the 1880s, Irish Terriers were the fourth most popular breed in Great Britain and Ireland.

The Irish Terrier is an active and compactly sized dog that is suited for life in both rural and city environments. Its harsh red coat protects it from all kinds of weather.

==Description==
===Appearance===

Breed standards describe the ideal Irish Terrier as being racy, red and rectangular. Racy: an Irish Terrier should appear powerful without being sturdy or heavy. Rectangular: the outline of the Irish Terrier differs markedly from those of other terriers. The Irish Terrier&#x27;s body is proportionately longer than that of the Fox Terrier, with a tendency toward racy lines but with no lack of substance. The deep chest is distinctive.

Formerly, the tail was customarily docked soon after birth to approximately two-thirds of the original length. In countries where docking is prohibited, the conformation judges emphasise tail carriage. The tail should start up quite high, but it should not stick straight up or curl over the back or either side of its body. The ears are small and folded forward just above skull level. They are preferably slightly darker than the rest of the coat.
====Coat and colour====

The Irish Terrier is coloured golden red, red wheaten, or wheaten. Dark red is often mistaken as the only correct colour, possibly because wheaten coats are often of worse quality. As with many other solid-coloured breeds, a small patch of white is allowed on the chest. No white should appear elsewhere. As an Irish Terrier grows older, grey hair may appear here and there.

The outer part of the double coat should be straight and wiry in texture, never soft, silky, curly, wavy, or woolly as might be expected in the Kerry Blue Terrier. The coat should lie flat against the skin, and, though having some length, should never be so long as to hide the true shape of the dog. There are longer hairs on the legs, but never so much as a Wire Fox Terrier or Schnauzer. That means you have to have the coat trimmed often which can be expensive.

The inner part of the coat, called the under-wool or undercoat, should also be red. The under-wool may be hard for the inexperienced eye to see. Coat should be quite dense and so that &quot;when parted with the fingers the skin is hardly visible&quot;.

A properly trimmed Irish Terrier should have some &quot;furnishings&quot; on legs and head. The slightly longer hair on the front legs should form even pillars, while the rear legs should only have some longer hair and not be trimmed too close to the skin. The chin is accentuated with a small beard. The beard should not be as profuse as that of a Schnauzer.

The eyes should be dark brown and quite small with a &quot;fiery&quot; expression. The eyes are topped with well-groomed eyebrows. The whole head should have good pigmentation.

====Size====
Most countries have breed descriptions that say that the Irish Terrier should not be more than 48 cm measured at the withers. However, it is not unusual to see females that are 50 cm tall or dogs that are even 53 cm (20 in). Younger generations are closer to the ideal, but there is a downside to this: when an Irish Terrier is very small and light-boned, it loses the correct racy type.

Very seldom does one see Irish Terriers that weigh only 11 to 12 kg (25–27 lb), as the original Kennel Club breed description states. 13 kg for a female dog and 15 for a male dog are acceptable.

===Temperament===

Irish Terriers are active dogs and need and enjoy consistent mental and physical challenges; well-trained Irish Terriers may do well at a variety of dog sports, such as dog agility.
The Irish Terrier is full of life, but not hyperactive; it should be able to relax inside the house and roused to full activity level quickly.

Irish Terriers are good with people. They have a highly developed sense of loyalty and it is important that they have a strong responsible leader which they respect. Most Irish Terriers love children and tolerate rough-housing to a certain extent. Irish terriers need exercise and require large amounts of walking. They enjoy training and learn fast, with food and toys working equally well as motivation. Irish terriers have less of an eagerness to please people than some other breeds but have mental ability and enjoy puzzle solving. They respond best to consistent, reward based training from a relaxed, authoritative person. As with all dog breeds, violence should never be used, preferring distraction and rewarding the desired behaviour. It is always best to outwit and lure. When seeking a trainer, one should look for a person who has experience with terriers.

Irish Terriers are often dominant with other dogs. As with any dog, poorly socialised individuals can start fights and early socialisation is a necessity. Most have strong guarding instincts which, when controlled, make them excellent alarming watchdogs.

Terriers are increasingly popular in organised dog sports. The obedience training required at most levels in most dog sports is fairly easy to achieve, although the precision and long-lasting drive needed in the higher levels may be less so. Many Irish Terriers excel at dog agility, even though it may be hard to balance the speed, independence and precision needed in the higher levels.

Irish Terriers have a good nose and can learn to track either animal or human scent. Many Irish Terriers enjoy lure coursing, although they are not eligible for competition. In Finland one Irish Terrier is a qualified Rescue Dog specialising at Sea Rescue.

==History==
The breed&#x27;s origin is not known. It is believed to have descended from the black and tan terrier-type dogs of Britain and Ireland, just like the Kerry Blue and Soft-coated Wheaten Terriers in Ireland or the Welsh, Lakeland and Scottish Terriers in Great Britain. There is also conjecture that the breed may share bloodlines with the Irish Wolfhound.

F. M. Jowett writes in &quot;The Irish Terrier&quot;, &#x27;Our Dogs&#x27; Publishing Co. Ltd., Manchester, England 1947 – 7th Edition:
They are described by an old Irish writer as being the poor man&#x27;s sentinel, the farmer&#x27;s friend, and the gentleman&#x27;s favourite...These dogs were originally bred not so much for their looks as for their working qualities and gameness, the Irish Terrier being by instinct a thorough vermin killer. They were formerly of all types and of all colours – black-and-tan, grey-and-brindle, wheaten of all shades, and red being the predominant colours. Colour or size evidently did not matter if they were hardy and game.&quot;

The proper selection process of the breed began only in the latter 19th century. They were shown now and then, sometimes in one class, sometimes in separate classes for dogs under and over 9 pounds.

The first breed club was set up in Dublin in 1879. Irish Terriers were the first members of the terrier group to be recognised by the English Kennel Club as a native Irish Breed – this happened just before the end of the 19th century. The first Irish Terriers were taken to the US in the late nineteenth century and quickly became somewhat popular.

==Care==

When groomed properly, the Irish Terrier coat will protect the dog from rain and cold. A properly cared-for Irish Terrier does not shed either. The wiry coat is fairly easy to groom, pet dogs (rather than show dogs) needing stripping only once or twice a year.

The coat must be stripped by hand or a non-cutting knife to retain its weather-resistant qualities. This does not hurt the dog when done properly. Keeping the skin above the stripped section taut with the other hand helps especially where the skin is looser, i.e. belly and chest. Never cut the coat – use your fingers or a non-cutting knife. If the coat is clipped, it loses colour and becomes softer, thus losing its weather-resistant characteristics. For the same reason the coat should not be washed too often, as detergents take away the natural skin oils. Most Irish terriers only need washing when dirty.

When stripping, the coat may be &quot;taken down&quot; entirely to leave the dog in the undercoat until a new coat grows in. For a pet, this should be done at least twice a year. When a show-quality coat is required, it can be achieved in many ways. One is by &quot;rolling the coat&quot;, i.e. stripping the dog every X weeks to remove any dead hair. Before a show an expert trimmer is needed to mould especially the head and legs.

Some Irish Terriers need to have their ears trained when young.

==Health==

A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 13.5 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

==Irish Terrier in literature==
&quot;&quot;As I stood up, I saw that she was crying. ...&quot;Oh, for heaven&#x27;s sake, Pat ...&quot; ...From all my experiences I knew that there was no one you could rely on and trust except your own self and, in the best case scenario, your friend.&quot;

&quot;...Of course, with us was it altogether a different matter but still, after all is said and done, Pat was also spending all her days staying at home alone. ...&quot;A dog!&quot; I said in surprise as it dawned on me &quot;damn it, of course, a dogl You are straight to the point! With the dog one will never feel lonely!&quot; ...It was a lovely, playful little doggie. Straight legs, square body, oblong head, intelligent and cheeky. ...&quot;Do you know what you&#x27;ve got there?&quot; Gustav asked me when we were outside. &quot;Something really rare: an Irish terrier. Best of the best. Without a single blemish. And with a pedigree too.&quot;&quot;

&quot;...&quot;I have to go and make my evening round right now. I would like you to come with me.&quot; ...Ward after ward it went on and on, room after room was it all the same: groaning, tormented bodies all around; motionless, almost dried-out human forms; a bunch of seemingly endless instances of misery, fear, surrender, pain, desperation, hope, distress. ...&quot;Now you have seen for yourself that many of these people are much more worse off than Pat Hollmann. Some of them have got nothing left but their hope. Yet the majority are going to make it. ...You can&#x27;t be sure of anything in advance. The hopelessly ill can pull it off and live much longer than the healthy one. Life is quite an amasing affair.&quot;&quot;

&quot;...I drove off. While on the Nikolaistraße, I suddenly remembered that I have completely forgotten about the dog. So I turned around and drove back to pick him up. ...The terrier sprang towards me, sniffed me and licked my hand. His eyes shone green in the oblique light that was coming from the street. ...I took the dog which was cuddling warmly towards me and went away. Compliantly, with the long soft steps, he was walking along by my side to the car. ...The dog quickly pulled away and, passing between my legs, ran barking across our room. &quot;Good heavens!&quot; Pat exclaimed. &quot;This is a real Irish Terrier!&quot; ...She was breathlessly happy with the joy.&quot;&quot; - From the &quot;Three Comrades&quot; novel by &quot;Erich Maria Remarque&quot;

==Early life==
Bateman was born to Victoria Elizabeth, a former flight attendant for Pan Am who was originally from Shrewsbury in the United Kingdom, and Kent Bateman. She is the older sister of actor Jason Bateman.

Bateman attended Taft High School in Woodland Hills, California. However, Bateman could not attend college at the time due to her contractual obligations with &quot;Family Ties&quot;. Bateman stated that she was informed by the series&#x27; line producer Carol Himes, &quot;You&#x27;re under contract to Paramount Studios.&quot;

==Career==
=== Acting ===
Bateman&#x27;s most prominent acting role began when she was a teenager, playing the role of superficial Mallory Keaton on the television sitcom &quot;Family Ties&quot; in 1982; she continued the role throughout the show&#x27;s run which ended in 1989. She hosted an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; during its 13th season in 1988.

In the 1996–97 NBC American version of the British TV comedy &quot;Men Behaving Badly&quot;, featuring Rob Schneider and Ron Eldard, she starred as Sarah, Eldard&#x27;s character&#x27;s girlfriend. Bateman returned to TV with the 2003 Showtime mini-series &quot;Out of Order&quot;, alongside Eric Stoltz, Felicity Huffman and William H. Macy.
In the third-season &quot;Arrested Development&quot; episode &quot;Family Ties,&quot; which was broadcast in February 2006, her character is initially believed to be Michael Bluth&#x27;s sister, but she turns out to be a prostitute taken advantage of by his father, and pimped by his brother. Michael Bluth was played by Bateman&#x27;s brother Jason.

Recurring roles included &quot;Men in Trees&quot;, &quot;Still Standing&quot;, and &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;.

In 1988, Bateman starred in the lead role in the motion picture &quot;Satisfaction&quot;. The film, about an all-girl musical band, also featured Julia Roberts, Liam Neeson, and Britta Phillips. Bateman starred as the lead vocalist and also performed the vocals on the soundtrack. Other films include &quot;The Night We Never Met&quot;, with Matthew Broderick, and &quot;The TV Set&quot;, with David Duchovny and Sigourney Weaver.

<doc id="685945" wikidata="Q219657" url="?curid=685945" title="Frank de Boer">
<text>Franciscus de Boer (; born 15 May 1970) is a Dutch former professional footballer and current manager. A former defender, De Boer spent most of his playing career with Ajax, winning five Eredivisie titles, two KNVB Cups, three Super Cups, one UEFA Super Cup, one UEFA Cup, one UEFA Champions League, and one Intercontinental Cup. He later spent five years at Barcelona, where he won the 1998–99 La Liga title, followed by short spells at Galatasaray, Rangers, Al-Rayyan and Al-Shamal before retiring.

De Boer is the third-most capped outfield player in the history of the Netherlands national team, with 112 caps. He captained &quot;Oranje&quot; to the semi-finals of both the 1998 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2000. He is the twin brother of Ronald de Boer, with whom he was a teammate at Ajax, Barcelona, Rangers, Al-Rayyan, Al-Shamal and the Netherlands national team.

After retiring from playing, De Boer went into management with the Ajax youth team and as assistant to Bert van Marwijk with the Netherlands national team. In December 2010, he took over as manager of Ajax and went on to win the Eredivisie title in his first season. In 2013, he received the Rinus Michels Award for manager of the year in the Netherlands after leading Ajax to their third successive Eredivisie title. The following year, he became the first manager to win four consecutive Eredivisie titles. He then had brief spells managing in Serie A with Inter Milan in 2016, Crystal Palace in the Premier League in 2017, and Atlanta United in MLS from 2018 to 2020. De Boer was appointed head coach of the Netherlands national team in September 2020, but left less than a year later in June 2021 after the team&#x27;s disappointing Euro 2020 campaign.

==Club career==
===Ajax===

De Boer began his career as a left back at Ajax before switching to centre-back, a position he made his own for many years in the national team. He won both the 1991–92 UEFA Cup and 1994–95 UEFA Champions League while at Ajax, in addition to five Eredivisie titles and two KNVB Cups. However, after signing a six-year contract extension with Ajax for the 1998–99 season, he and his twin brother Ronald took successful legal action to have it voided. Ajax had a verbal agreement that if a lucrative offer for one brother came by, he would be released provided the other stayed. Ajax, however, apparently backed down on that agreement after floating the club on the stock market and pledging to shareholders that it would hold both of the De Boers and build around them a team to recapture the Champions League.

===Barcelona===
In January 1999, Frank and Ronald de Boer signed for Spanish La Liga club Barcelona for £22 million, joining their former Ajax manager Louis van Gaal at the Camp Nou. After winning the 1998–99 La Liga title, they were unable to repeat their earlier triumphs. In 2000, Van Gaal was sacked by Barcelona and Frank suffered the ignominy of testing positive for the banned substance nandrolone a year later. He was suspended but he was reinstated after a successful appeal.

===Later career===
De Boer briefly moved to Galatasaray in the summer of 2003 before joining his brother at Rangers in January 2004. He made his Rangers debut in a 1–0 win away at Partick Thistle, but in his second appearance for the club he missed the decisive penalty in the shootout as Rangers lost to Hibernian in the Scottish League Cup semi-final. He made a total of 17 appearances for Rangers, scoring two goals against Aberdeen and Dundee. The De Boer brothers left Rangers after UEFA Euro 2004 to play the rest of their football careers in Qatar with Al-Rayyan. De Boer announced his retirement from football in April 2006.

==International career==
Having represented his national team 112 times, he was the most capped player in the history of the Netherlands national team, until Edwin van der Sar surpassed him. De Boer made his debut for the Netherlands in September 1990 against Italy.

De Boer also played for the Netherlands in the 1994 and 1998 FIFA World Cups, and the 1992, 2000 and 2004 UEFA European Championships; he missed UEFA Euro 1996 due to an injury. He is well-remembered for the arching 60-yard pass which allowed Dennis Bergkamp to score the last-minute goal that eliminated Argentina in the quarter-finals of the 1998 World Cup. During Euro 2000, hosted in his home country and Belgium, De Boer reached another semi-final with the Dutch team. De Boer missed an important penalty kick in the first half of the semi-finals against 10-man Italy and another in the penalty shootout, which led to the Netherlands&#x27; elimination from the tournament.

On 29 March 2003, in a home match against Czech Republic, De Boer became the first Dutch male footballer to gain 100 caps. He ended his international career after an injury forced him to be replaced in a quarter-final match with Sweden at Euro 2004. The injury ruled him out from the semi-final match against Portugal, which the Netherlands lost 2–1.

==Style of play==
A talented and well-rounded world-class defender, in addition to his defensive skills, De Boer was also known for his pace, technical ability, accurate passing, and leadership, which enabled him to carry the ball out of defence, play it out from the back, or contribute to his team&#x27;s offensive play by initiating attacks and creating chances for strikers with long balls. A versatile, intelligent, and elegant left-footed defender, with an ability to read the game and intercept loose balls, he was capable of playing both on the left and in the centre, and was even deployed as a sweeper. He was also a dangerous set-piece taker, renowned for his accurate bending free kicks from anywhere around the penalty area.

==Managerial career==
In 2007, De Boer took up a coaching role at his former club Ajax where he was in charge of the club&#x27;s youth sector. During the 2010 World Cup, he was the assistant of the Netherlands national football team to manager Bert van Marwijk, together with retired player Phillip Cocu. The Dutch team reached the final of the tournament, losing to Spain.

===Ajax===

On 6 December 2010, after the resignation of Martin Jol, De Boer was appointed caretaker manager of Ajax until the winter break. His first game in charge was a Champions League match against Milan at the San Siro, a match Ajax won 2–0 through goals from Demy de Zeeuw and Toby Alderweireld. De Boer then went on to help Ajax become champions of the Eredivisie for the 2010–11 season in a 3–1 home victory over Twente, the champions of the previous year, on the final matchday, making the first year of his professional coaching career a golden one. &quot;I couldn&#x27;t have wished for a more beautiful birthday present&quot;, said De Boer, as the club&#x27;s 30th championship was won on his 41st birthday.

In two-and-a-half years at the helm of Ajax, De Boer won three championships, making eight in total (when including the five that he won as a player). According to reports, De Boer was offered the chance to interview for the Liverpool job but turned it down to remain with Ajax. &quot;I am honoured by the request [from Liverpool] but I have only just started with Ajax&quot;, he said. In 2013, De Boer received the Rinus Michels Award for manager of the year in the Netherlands after leading Ajax to their third successive Eredivisie title.

On 27 April 2014, De Boer won his fourth successive Eredivisie title with Ajax, the first manager ever to achieve this in the Dutch league. Moreover, it marked the first time Ajax has ever won four successive Eredivisie titles. De Boer has now won a total of nine Eredivisie championships with Ajax as a player and manager, another record; Johan Cruyff, Sjaak Swart and Jack Reynolds all won eight Eredivisie championships with Ajax. Ajax finished the 2014–15 Eredivisie in second position, a massive 17 points behind champions PSV.

On 11 May 2016, De Boer announced his resignation as manager of Ajax following a disappointing season when Ajax again lost out on the Eredivisie title to PSV on the final matchday of the season.

===Inter Milan===
On 9 August 2016, after the departure of Roberto Mancini, De Boer signed a three-year contract with Internazionale for the start of the 2016–17 season. De Boer&#x27;s first match in charge was Inter&#x27;s final pre-season friendly, a 2–0 win against Celtic on 13 August, played on neutral ground at Thomond Park, Republic of Ireland.

The club management board also approved expensive signings João Mário and Gabriel Barbosa for the team and De Boer (they were in fact linked to Mancini and Inter in July), and the return to Turkey of recent acquisition Caner Erkin in the last days of transfer window. Barbosa, however, was rarely used in Serie A matches and could not be registered in European competitions due to a penalty imposed on Inter for breaching UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations in previous seasons.

De Boer&#x27;s first competitive match was a 2–0 away loss to Chievo on 21 August. After the match, De Boer was criticized for using a three-man defence, a style that he had never used while at Ajax. Milan-based newspaper &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; went as far as calling Inter&#x27;s performance a &quot;disaster&quot;. Fortunes soon turned, however, as Inter drew 1–1 against Palermo on 28 August, before winning three games in a row, against Pescara, title-holders Juventus and Empoli. The win against Juventus was highly praised, with De Boer being lauded for substituting Éder for Ivan Perišić, who provided the winning goal. Inter&#x27;s form would not last long, as the club would go on to lose against Roma, Cagliari and Atalanta.

Inter also struggled in the UEFA Europa League under De Boer, as they lost the opening match 0–2 at home against Israeli team Hapoel Be&#x27;er Sheva on 15 September, and 3–1 against Sparta Prague on 29 September. Inter would then go on to finish last in their group with a total of six points, with three points under De Boer and another three under his successor.

Following a run of four defeats in the last five Serie A matches, which left Inter in 12th place in Serie A, De Boer was sacked on 1 November, having been in charge for only 85 days. His last match was a 1–0 loss to Sampdoria on 30 October. Ironically, during a press interview in the annual general meeting of the shareholders of Internazionale on 28 October, CEO Michael Bolingbroke had confirmed that the club was 100% backing De Boer. (Bolingbroke himself resigned a few days later. Liu Jun, vice-president of sister company Suning Sports, replaced Bolingbroke.)

De Boer argued that he &quot;needed more time&quot; in order to make a mark as manager at Inter, and thanked his fans on his Twitter profile for the support. He was replaced by former Lazio manager Stefano Pioli on 8 November, the ninth manager Inter had appointed since winning the Treble in 2010 under José Mourinho. Following Pioli&#x27;s initial struggles at Inter, De Boer hit back at the lack of leadership following Suning&#x27;s takeover of Inter, which he credits for the lack of trust he was given while there.

===Crystal Palace===
On 26 June 2017, De Boer was announced as the new manager of Premier League side Crystal Palace, replacing Sam Allardyce. He signed a three-year deal with the South London club, but was sacked ten weeks later when Palace lost their first four league matches of the season without scoring a single goal – the first team in 93 years to have begun a top-flight season in such a fashion. He left having managed the team for only 450 minutes of game time, making it the shortest reign of the Premier League era (in terms of number of matches, rather than number of days). De Boer&#x27;s only win came in an EFL Cup second-round game, in which Crystal Palace won 2–1 against Ipswich Town. He was replaced by Roy Hodgson.

Whilst at the club, De Boer attempted to implement a possession-based style of play; after his sacking, he criticised the club&#x27;s players for their resistance to his approach, arguing that the club had signed only two players to fit his philosophy. Palace winger Wilfried Zaha commented on De Boer&#x27;s brief time at the club, stating &quot;There wasn&#x27;t really the right mixture [of players] for the way we wanted to play.&quot;

Referencing De Boer&#x27;s stint at Crystal Palace, José Mourinho described De Boer as &quot;the worst manager in the history of the Premier League&quot;.

===Atlanta United===
On 23 December 2018, De Boer was announced as the head coach of Major League Soccer side Atlanta United, succeeding Gerardo &quot;Tata&quot; Martino to become the second head coach in the club&#x27;s history. In his first season, the team won both the U.S. Open Cup and Campeones Cup, while in MLS action finishing second in the Eastern Conference and reaching the Eastern Conference final.

On 24 July 2020, following Atlanta&#x27;s elimination from the MLS is Back Tournament after losing all three of their matches, Atlanta and De Boer mutually agreed to part ways.

===Netherlands===
On 23 September 2020, the KNVB announced that De Boer would be the new manager of the country&#x27;s national football team, signing a contract until the end of 2022. On 11 November 2020, after a 1–1 draw with Spain, De Boer became the first ever Netherlands manager to fail to win any of his first four fixtures.

He managed the Netherlands at the UEFA Euro 2020, where despite topping their group, they ultimately lost 2–0 to Czech Republic in the round of 16 and were eliminated. As a result of the team&#x27;s poor Euros performance, on 29 June 2021, the KNVB announced that it had parted ways with De Boer.

===Al Jazira===
On 5 June 2023, De Boer was appointed head coach of UAE Pro League club Al Jazira, signing a two-year contract to succeed his compatriot Marcel Keizer. On 11 December 2023, with the club sitting in 7th place in the league table and following a 4–2 defeat to Al Wahda in the quarter-finals of the UAE League Cup, De Boer was sacked.

<text>The Ford Nucleon is a concept car developed by Ford in 1957, designed as a future nuclear-powered car—one of a handful of such designs during the 1950s and 1960s. The concept was only demonstrated as a scale model. The design did not include an internal combustion engine; rather, the vehicle was to be powered by a small nuclear reactor at its rear, based on the assumption that nuclear reactors would eventually become small enough to make this possible. The car was to use a steam engine powered by uranium fission, similar to those found in nuclear submarines.

The Nucleon was not a serious design, but rather a vision of the future when such a small reactor with small and light radiation shielding might become possible. It was described in June 1957 as &quot;an advanced notion of the automotive future&quot; and as a &quot;futuristic fancy&quot;. Ford stated:

This supposition has not come to pass, and modern fission reactors with enough power to propel a vehicle still require roughly 5 feet of radiation shielding (e.g. concrete, water, and/or tungsten) to prevent the operator from absorbing hazardous amounts of radiation dose.

The mock-up of the car can be viewed at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan.

==Design concept==

At the time of the concept&#x27;s unveiling, nuclear technology was relatively new, and it was believed that nuclear fission technology could be made compact and affordable, such that nuclear fuel would become the primary energy source in the U.S., and gasoline would become obsolete. Ford envisioned a future where gas stations would be replaced with full service recharging stations, and that the vehicle would get before the reactor would have to be exchanged for a new one. These would be scaled-down versions of the nuclear reactors that military submarines used at the time, utilizing uranium as the fissile material. Because the entire reactor would be replaced, Ford hypothesized that the owner would have multiple choices for reactors, such as a fuel-efficient model or a high-performance model, at each reactor change. Ultimately, the reactor would use heat to convert water into steam and the power train would be steam-driven.

==In popular culture==
The Nucleon is the inspiration for nuclear cars in the &quot;Fallout&quot; video game franchise. For example, in-game billboards describe the fictional Chryslus Corvega Atomic V8 as having an &quot;Atomic V8&quot; engine. The game&#x27;s depiction is purely satirical, as the cars explode into an implausible mushroom cloud and release radiation when shot.

<text>Stanley Louis Cavell (; September 1, 1926 – June 19, 2018) was an American philosopher. He was the Walter M. Cabot Professor of Aesthetics and the General Theory of Value at Harvard University. He worked in the fields of ethics, aesthetics, and ordinary language philosophy. As an interpreter, he produced influential works on Wittgenstein, Austin, Emerson, Thoreau, and Heidegger. His work is characterized by its conversational tone and frequent literary references.

==Life==
Cavell was born as Stanley Louis Goldstein to a Jewish family in Atlanta, Georgia. His mother, Fannie (Segal), the daughter of immigrants from Romania, was a locally renowned pianist for radio, vaudeville, and silent films. She trained him in music from his earliest days. During the Great Depression, Cavell&#x27;s parents moved several times between Atlanta and Sacramento, California. As an adolescent, Cavell played lead alto saxophone as the youngest member of a black jazz band in Sacramento. Around this time he changed his name, anglicizing his father&#x27;s original Polish name, Kavelieruskii (sometimes spelled &quot;Kavelieriskii&quot;). He entered the University of California, Berkeley, where, along with his lifelong friend Bob Thompson, he majored in music, studying with, among others, Roger Sessions and Ernest Bloch. After graduation, he studied composition at the Juilliard School of Music in New York City, only to discover that music was not his calling.

He entered graduate school in philosophy at UCLA, and then transferred to Harvard University. As a student there he came under the influence of J. L. Austin, whose teaching and methods &quot;knocked him off ... [his] horse.&quot; In 1954 he was awarded a Junior Fellowship at the Harvard Society of Fellows. Before completing his Ph.D., he became an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1956. Cavell&#x27;s daughter by his first wife (Marcia Cavell), Rachel Lee Cavell, was born in 1957. In 1962–63 Cavell was a Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he befriended the British philosopher Bernard Williams. Cavell’s marriage to Marcia ended in divorce in 1961. In 1963 he returned to the Harvard Philosophy Department, where he became the Walter M. Cabot Professor of Aesthetics and the General Theory of Value.

In the summer of 1964, Cavell joined a group of graduate students, who taught at Tougaloo College, a historically black Protestant college in Mississippi, as part of what became known as the Freedom Summer. He and Cathleen (Cohen) Cavell were married in 1967. In April 1969, during the student protests (chiefly arising from the Vietnam War), Cavell, helped by his colleague John Rawls, worked with a group of African-American students to draft language for a faculty vote to establish Harvard&#x27;s Department of African and African-American Studies.

In 1976, Cavell&#x27;s first son, Benjamin, was born. In 1979, along with the documentary filmmaker Robert H. Gardner, Cavell helped found the Harvard Film Archive, to preserve and present the history of film. Cavell received a MacArthur Fellowship in 1992. In 1996-97 Cavell was president of the American Philosophical Association (Eastern Division). In 1984, his second son, David, was born. Cavell remained on the Harvard faculty until retiring in 1997. Thereafter, he taught courses at Yale University and the University of Chicago. He also held the Spinoza Chair of Philosophy at the University of Amsterdam in 1998.

Cavell died in Boston, Massachusetts of heart failure on June 19, 2018, at the age of 91. He was buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery.

==Philosophy==
Although trained in the Anglo-American analytic tradition, Cavell frequently interacted with the continental tradition. He includes film and literary study in philosophical inquiry. Cavell wrote extensively on Ludwig Wittgenstein, J. L. Austin, and Martin Heidegger, as well as the American transcendentalists Henry Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson. His work was for a time frequently compared to that of Jacques Derrida, whom he met in 1970. Although their exchange was congenial, Cavell denied the full extent to which deconstruction could undermine the possibility of meaning, instead taking an explicitly ordinary language approach to language and skepticism. He writes about Wittgenstein in a fashion known as the New Wittgenstein, which according to Alice Crary interprets Wittgenstein as putting forward a positive view of philosophy as a therapeutic form. Cavell&#x27;s work incorporates autobiographical elements concerning how his movement between and within these thinkers&#x27; ideas influenced his views in the arts and humanities, beyond the technical study of philosophy.

Cavell established his distinct philosophical identity with &quot;Must We Mean What We Say?&quot; (1969), a collection of essays that addresses topics such as language use, metaphor, skepticism, tragedy, and literary interpretation from the point of view of ordinary language philosophy, of which he is a practitioner and ardent defender. One of the essays discusses Søren Kierkegaard&#x27;s work on revelation and authority, &quot;The Book on Adler&quot;, in an effort to help reintroduce the book to modern philosophical readers. In &quot;The World Viewed&quot; (1971) Cavell looks at photography, film, modernism in art and the nature of media, mentioning the influence of art critic Michael Fried on his work.

Cavell is well-known for &quot;The Claim of Reason: Wittgenstein, Skepticism, Morality, and Tragedy&quot; (1979), which forms the centerpiece of his work and has its origins in his doctoral dissertation. In &quot;Pursuits of Happiness&quot; (1981), Cavell describes his experience of seven prominent Hollywood comedies: &quot;The Lady Eve&quot;, &quot;It Happened One Night&quot;, &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot;, &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot;, &quot;His Girl Friday&quot;, &quot;Adam’s Rib&quot;, and &quot;The Awful Truth&quot;. Cavell argues that these films, from 1934–1949, form part of what he calls the genre of &quot;The Comedy of Remarriage,&quot; and finds in them great philosophical, moral, and political significance. Specifically, Cavell argues that these comedies show that &quot;the achievement of happiness requires not the [...] satisfaction of our needs [...] but the examination and transformation of those needs.&quot; According to Cavell, the emphasis these movies place on remarriage draws attention to the fact that, within a relationship, happiness requires &quot;growing up&quot; together with one&#x27;s partner.

In &quot;Cities of Words&quot; (2004) Cavell traces the history of moral perfectionism, a mode of moral thinking spanning the history of Western philosophy and literature. Having used Emerson to outline the concept, the book suggests ways we might want to understand philosophy, literature, and film as preoccupied with features of perfectionism. In &quot;Philosophy the Day After Tomorrow&quot; (2005), a collection of essays, Cavell makes the case that J. L. Austin&#x27;s concept of performative utterance requires the supplementary concept of &quot;passionate utterance&quot;: &quot;A performative utterance is an offer of participation in the order of law. And perhaps we can say: A passionate utterance is an invitation to improvisation in the disorders of desire.&quot; The book also contains extended discussions of Friedrich Nietzsche, Jane Austen, George Eliot, Henry James, and Fred Astaire, as well as familiar Cavellian subjects such as Shakespeare, Emerson, Thoreau, Wittgenstein, and Heidegger. Cavell&#x27;s final book, &quot;Little Did I Know: Excerpts from Memory&quot; (2010), is an autobiography written in the form of a diary. In a series of consecutive, dated entries, he inquires about the origins of his philosophy by telling the story of his life.

A scholarly journal, &quot;Conversations: The Journal of Cavellian Studies&quot;, engages with his philosophical work. It is edited by Sérgio Dias Branco and Amir Khan and published by the University of Ottawa.

<doc id="685953" wikidata="Q39041" url="?curid=685953" title="Welsh Terrier">
<text>The Welsh Terrier () also known as the Welshie, is believed to have originated in the 1700s in Wales and was originally bred for hunting fox, rodents and badger; in the remote mountains of northern Wales, but during the last century, it has mainly been bred for showing. Despite this, it has retained its terrier strength of character. The Welsh Terrier has been claimed to be the oldest existing dog breed in the UK.

The Welsh Terrier was a latecomer to the British show-ring (being primarily a working dog) and was not officially registered as a breed until the 19th century. The Breed has managed to win best in show at Crufts four times, the last being in 1998 with Saredon Forever Young (Mel) owned by Judith Averis. It is on the UK Kennel Club&#x27;s list of breeds that are in danger of dying out, having as few as 300 or so pups registered annually. The most popular breeds are registered in tens of thousands each year.

==Description==
===Appearance===
The Welsh Terrier is coloured tan on the head, legs and underbelly with a black or sometimes grizzle saddle. Females are sometimes a simple darker tan all over. The breed is a sturdy and compact dog of about medium size that can grow up to with a weight of . The tail was usually docked until this was prohibited in the United Kingdom in 2006, being preferred in order to complete the image of a square dog, as tall as it is long. The body shape is rectangular, with an elongated, &quot;brick-like&quot; face. This shape is formed by the whiskers and beard. With pedigrees the face can take a more oval shape and be finer boned and more distinct.
The hair contains two layers, an undercoat that insulates and abrasive fur on top that protects against dirt, rain, and wind. Welsh Terriers are born mostly all black and during the first year they change colour to standard black and tan grizzle.

This breed does not shed (see Moult). However, the coat requires regular grooming maintenance including brushing and hand stripping.

An undocked Welsh Terrier tail is only an inch or so longer than a docked tail and does not make a great deal of difference to the overall appearance. The coat does not moult out but old hairs will eventually be stripped out through play and movement if the coat is not regularly raked. Ungroomed coats can also fade and thin out as the old hair loses colour and texture.

The Welsh Terrier closely resembles a compact Airedale Terrier.

===Temperament===

The Welsh Terrier has a typical terrier temperament. In the right hands, it is a happy, lively, and seldom shy or timid dog, but sometimes can have an attitude. The Welsh Terrier is generally friendly with people and dogs but when a challenge is perceived, it will not back down. Dogs of this breed can be devoted friends and can function either as city dogs or as country dogs.

Welsh Terriers were developed to hunt independently and this required that they be very assertive and stoic dogs. As a consequence, developing obedience in a Welsh Terrier is a long-term proposition and one has to constantly work on and reinforce the training. They rank 101st in Stanley Coren&#x27;s &quot;The Intelligence of Dogs&quot;, being of average working/obedience intelligence. This, however, does not mean that Welsh Terriers fail to learn or understand commands, just that they tend to make their own decisions; thus the need for constant reinforcement. When acting on their own, they are quite creative and quick in decision making. They also have the potential for excessive barking. Like other terrier breeds, the Welsh Terrier enjoys digging.

A Welsh Terrier is full of energy and requires regular exercise. A run around the yard during the day is insufficient. They become excited, and if bored, they may explore and potentially cause mischief and damage. Welsh Terriers need a challenge to keep them entertained. For example, they love chasing toys and love swimming (a good example would be lake activities with their families).

Welsh Terriers get along well with children; they love to play and follow a child as it plays, however, and they will often tug at pant legs and can knock young ones off their feet. If they are around young children at an early age, they will easily learn to play more gently.

As with all breeds, it is important to socialize Welsh Terriers as early as possible to a wide range of dogs, people, and experiences.

==Health==
The body of the Welsh Terrier is normal and healthy so that the physique is durable and lasting. Some studies have suggested a genetic predisposition to primary lens luxation which results in secondary glaucoma. Onychodystrophy, a disorder of nail growth causing nails to be weak and brittle, is relatively common in the breed.

In January 2020, Servco Pacific became the majority owner after acquiring the shares of TPG Growth.

==History==

===Origins===
The company began as &quot;Fender&#x27;s Radio Service&quot; in late 1938, in Fullerton, California. As a qualified electronics technician, Fender had repaired radios, phonographs, home audio amplifiers, public address systems and musical instrument amplifiers, all designs based on research developed and released to the public domain by Western Electric in the 1930s, using vacuum tubes for amplification. The business also sidelined in carrying records for sale and the rental of company-designed PA systems. Leo became intrigued by design flaws in contemporary musical instrument amplifiers and began building amplifiers based on his own designs or modifications to designs.
By the early 1940s, Leo Fender had entered into a partnership with Clayton Orr &quot;Doc&quot; Kauffman, and they formed the K &amp; F Manufacturing Corp to design, manufacture, and market electric instruments and amplifiers. Production began in 1945 with Hawaiian lap steel guitars like the &quot;Champion&quot; (incorporating a patented pickup) and amplifiers, sold as sets. By the end of the year, Fender became convinced that manufacturing was more profitable than repair, and decided to concentrate on that business instead. Kauffman remained unconvinced, and he and Fender amicably parted ways by early 1946. At that point, Fender renamed the company the &quot;Fender Electric Instrument Company&quot;. The service shop remained open until 1951, although Leo Fender did not personally supervise it after 1947.

Leo Fender&#x27;s lap steel guitar made in 1946 for Noel Boggs was probably the first product of the new company, bearing an early presentation of the cursive &quot;big F&quot; Fender logo.

In the late 1940s, Fender began to experiment with more conventional guitar designs. Early Broadcasters were plagued with issues; while Fender boasted the strength of the instrument&#x27;s one-piece maple neck, early adopters lamented its tendency to bow in humid weather. Fender&#x27;s reluctant addition of a metal truss rod into the necks of his guitars allowed for the much needed ability to fine-tune the instrument to the musician&#x27;s specific needs. With the design of the Telecaster finalized, mass production began in 1950. The Telecaster&#x27;s bolted-on neck allowed for the instrument&#x27;s body and neck to be milled and finished separately, and for the final assembling to be done quickly and cheaply by unskilled workers.
In 1950, Fender introduced the first mass-produced solid-body electric guitar, the Telecaster (&quot;Tele&quot;) (originally named the Broadcaster for two-pickup models and Esquire for single-pickup). Following its success, Fender created the first mass-produced electric bass, the Precision Bass (P-Bass). In August 1954 Fender unveiled the Stratocaster (&quot;Strat&quot;) guitar. With the Telecaster and Precision Bass having been on the market for some time, Leo Fender was able to incorporate input from working musicians into the Stratocaster&#x27;s design. Following the Stratocaster&#x27;s release, the Precision Bass received a major makeover, aligning it more with the Stratocaster as opposed to the Telecaster.

In 1959, Fender released the Jazzmaster guitar. Like the Stratocaster before it, the Jazzmaster was a radical departure from previous guitar designs. The offset body, vibrato system and innovative electronics were designed to capture the Jazz guitar market which until then was dominated by acoustic guitars. Fender even promoted the Jazzmaster as a premium successor to the Stratocaster, an accolade it never fully achieved. Despite being shunned by the Jazz community, the guitar found a home in the growing surf rock music scene, one that would go on to influence the Jazzmaster&#x27;s successor, the Jaguar in 1962. The Fender Jazz Bass was released in 1960, a year after the Jazzmaster.

=== Sale to CBS ===
In January 1965, Leo Fender sold his companies to the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) for $13 million ($ in adjusted for inflation). CBS entered the musical instruments field by acquiring the Fender companies (Fender Sales, Inc., Fender Electric Instrument Company, Inc., Fender Acoustic Instrument Company, Inc., Fender-Rhodes, Inc., Terrafen, Inc., Clef-Tronix, Inc., Randall Publishing Co., Inc., and V.C. Squier Company), as well as Electro-Music Inc. (Leslie speakers), Rogers drums, Steinway pianos, Gemeinhardt flutes, Lyon &amp; Healy harps, Rodgers (institutional) organs, and Gulbransen home organs.

CBS brought in new money and personnel who assembled and put to market a large inventory of Fender parts and unassembled guitars. The sale also led to a reduction of the quality of Fender&#x27;s guitars while under the management of &quot;cost-cutting&quot; CBS. Several cosmetic changes occurred after 1965/1966, such as a larger headstock shape on certain guitars. Bound necks with block shaped position markers were introduced in 1966. A bolder black headstock logo, as well as a brushed aluminum face plate with blue or red labels (depending the model) for the guitar and bass amplifiers became standard features, starting in late 1968. These first &quot;silverface&quot; amps added an aluminium trim detail around the speaker baffle until 1970.

Other cosmetic changes included a new &quot;tailless&quot; Fender amp decal and a sparkling orange grillcloth on certain amplifiers in the mid-1970s. The usual four-bolt neck joint was changed in 1971 to one using three bolts, and a second string tree for the two middle (G and D) strings was added in late 1972. The new micro-tilt adjustment of the neck (previously requiring neck removal and shimming), the &quot;Bullet&quot; truss rod system, and a 5-way pickup selector were introduced on most models.

The company introduced some new instrument and amplifier designs during the CBS era. The Fender Starcaster was unusual because of its shallow semi-hollow body design that still retained the traditional Fender bolt-on neck with a new headstock design. The Starcaster also incorporated a new Humbucking pickup designed by Seth Lover, which became known as the Wide Range pickup. This pickup also gave rise to 3 new incarnations of the classic Telecaster: the Telecaster Custom, the Telecaster Deluxe and the Telecaster Thinline. 

CBS-era instruments are generally much less coveted or collectable than the &quot;pre-CBS&quot; models created by Leo Fender prior to selling the Fender companies to CBS in 1965. In 1966 Fender opened a much a larger facility at 1300 S. Valencia Drive adjacent to the existing factory at 500 South Raymond Avenue. Guitar and amplifier production, which had increased 30% in CBS&#x27;s first year, soon increased another 45%.

In 1981, CBS brought in three new executives, John McLaren, William &quot;Bill&quot; Schultz and Dan Smith, who had previously worked for Yamaha Musical Instruments. To address quality control issues, the Fender Fullerton plant was shut down for a short time in order to revamp manufacturing. Fender was also struggling to fight against lower cost copycat guitars on the market. Production was moved to Japan. On March 11, 1982, Fender Japan Ltd. was founded.

In 1983, the Fender Stratocaster received a short-lived redesign including a single (&quot;master&quot;) tone control, a bare-bones pickguard-mounted output jack, redesigned single-coil pickups, active electronics, and three push buttons for pickup selection on the Elite Series. Previous models such as the Swinger (also known as Musiclander) and Custom (also known as Maverick) were perceived by some musicians as little more than attempts to squeeze profits out of factory stock. 

After selling the Fender company, Leo Fender founded Music Man in 1975, and G&amp;L Musical Instruments in 1979, both of which manufacture electric guitars and basses based on his later designs.

===After CBS===

In 1985, in a campaign initiated by then CBS Musical Instruments division president William Schultz (1926–2006), the Fender Electric Instrument Manufacturing Company employees purchased the company from CBS and renamed it &quot;Fender Musical Instruments Corporation&quot; (FMIC). The sale did not include the old Fullerton factory; FMIC had to build a new facility in nearby Corona. The vast majority of Fender guitars sold in 1985 were made in Japan.

In 1987 Fender established a small manufacturing facility in Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico and in 1990 Fender and their Japanese partners FujiGen started guitar manufacturing in the city. Mexican Fenders appeared in the catalog from January 1991. The plant was rebuilt in 1994 after a fire. Player, Vintera and Acoustisonic models are now made there.

In 1991, FMIC moved its corporate headquarters from its Corona location to Scottsdale, Arizona.

=== Price fixing ===

In January 2020, the company&#x27;s UK arm, Fender Europe, was fined £4.5 million after admitting resale price maintenance (a form of price-fixing) between 2013, and 2018, in breach of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Competition Act 1998.

==Logos==

The Fender &quot;spaghetti logo&quot; was used by Fender from 1954 to the mid-1960s. By 1965 Fender used a transition logo which was a thicker gold-and-black logo (this logo is associated with CBS).

== Acquisitions and partnerships ==
FMIC has purchased a number of instrument brands and firms, including the Guild Guitar Company, the Sunn Amplifier Company, and SWR Sound Corporation. In early 2003, FMIC reached an agreement with the Gretsch family and began manufacturing and distributing new Gretsch guitars. Fender also owns Jackson, Olympia, Orpheum, Tacoma Guitars, Squier, and Brand X amps.

On October 28, 2007, Fender acquired Kaman Music Corporation, which owned the Ovation Guitar Company, Latin Percussion and Toca hand percussion products, Gibraltar Hardware, Genz Benz Amplification, Charvel, Hamer Guitars, and is the exclusive U.S. sales representative for Sabian Cymbals and exclusive worldwide distributor of Takamine Guitars and Gretsch Drums.

In 2011, Volkswagen partnered with Fender to manufacture premium sound systems for its vehicles in North America. Volkswagen vehicles in North America that offer optional Fender Premium Sound are the Volkswagen Golf, Volkswagen Beetle, Volkswagen Jetta Sedan, Volkswagen Passat, and Volkswagen Tiguan.

In February 2015, KMC was sold to Jam Industries by FMIC.

In January 2019, Fender purchased the Bigsby Electric Guitar Company from its partner Gretsch.The subsidiary operates independently, and produces the popular Bigsby vibrato tailpiece as well as several Paul Bigsby-designed electric guitars.

In November 2021, Fender purchased the Louisiana-based PreSonus Audio Electronics, a manufacturer of professional audio equipment and software.

In June 2023, it announced a partnership with Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine (band).

==Publications==

===Fender Frontline===
Fender published the Fender Frontline magazine as a source of product, artist and technical data for the company&#x27;s customers. The first half featured interviews and articles about the guitars and the stars who played them, and the second half was a catalog section.

Fender published 27 issues of the magazine from 1990 through 2000. Notable interviewees included Kurt Cobain in Fall 1994, in what was his last interview. Fender had designed a hybrid guitar for Cobain, known as a Jag Stang. Other notable interviews featured Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour, Glenn Hughes from Deep Purple, and King Crimson&#x27;s Adrian Belew.

In 2001, Fender eliminated the interviews and features section, and Frontline became an annual illustrated price list until 2006, when it was replaced with a product guide.

==Products==
Fender&#x27;s core product are electric guitars, namely the Jaguar, Jazzmaster, Mustang, Telecaster, Stratocaster, Duo-Sonic, Meteora, and Jag-Stang. This is alongside bass guitars in the Mustang, Jaguar, Jazz, Precision and Meteora models. Fender also manufactures acoustic guitars, lap steel guitars, banjos, electric violins, guitar/bass amplifiers and the Fender Rhodes electric piano (until 1983). In addition, Fender produces effects pedals and picks.

According to American guitar expert George Gruhn, the Fender Telecaster, Precision Bass, and Stratocaster are &quot;three of the most important models in the history of the electric guitar&quot;, and were all introduced between 1950 and 1957. In 1953, Fender also introduced the Stringmaster, a double-pickup model which was popular with western swing steel-guitar players.

Fender manufactures and distributes all musical instruments sold under the EVH brand, including Custom Shop models and replicas of the Frankenstrat.

== Squier ==

Squier was a string manufacturer that Fender acquired. Fender has used the Squier brand since 1982 to market inexpensive variants of Fender guitars to compete with Stratocaster copies, as the Stratocaster became more popular. Squier guitars have been manufactured in the United States, Japan, Korea, Indonesia and China.

<doc id="685959" wikidata="Q872853" url="?curid=685959" title="Chambered nautilus">
<text>The chambered nautilus (Nautilus pompilius), also called the pearly nautilus, is the best-known species of nautilus. The shell, when cut away, reveals a lining of lustrous nacre and displays a nearly perfect equiangular spiral, although it is not a golden spiral. The shell exhibits countershading, being light on the bottom and dark on top. This is to help avoid predators, because when seen from above, it blends in with the darkness of the sea, and when seen from below, it blends in with the light coming from above.

The range of the chambered nautilus encompasses much of the south Pacific; It has been found near reefs and on the seafloor off the coasts of Australia, Japan, and Micronesia.

The eyes of the chambered nautilus, like those of all &quot;Nautilus&quot; species, are more primitive than those of most other cephalopods; the eye has no lens and thus is comparable to a pinhole camera. The species has about 90 cirri (referred to as &quot;tentacles&quot;; see ) that do not have suckers, differing significantly from the limbs of coleoids. Chambered nautiluses, again like all members of the genus, have a pair of rhinophores located near each eye which detect chemicals, and use olfaction and chemotaxis to find their food.

The oldest fossils of the species are known from Early Pleistocene sediments deposited off the coast of Luzon in the Philippines.

Although once thought to be a living fossil, the chambered nautilus is now considered taxonomically very different from ancient ammonites, and the recent fossil record surrounding the species shows more genetic diversity among nautiluses now than has been found since the extinction of the dinosaurs. Indeed, the taxon of the chambered nautilus, &quot;Nautilus pompilius&quot;, is actually a grouping of tens of different species of nautilus under one name.

All nautilus species are threatened due to overfishing for their shell, which primarily is used for jewelry and other ornamental artifacts. In 2016, they were moved to CITES Appendix II, which restricts international trade, and later the chambered nautilus was recognized as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act.

== Life cycle ==
Because of their oceanic habitat, studies of their life cycle have primarily been based on captive animals and their eggs have never been seen in the wild. Although nautilus have been kept at public aquariums since the 1950s, the chambered nautilus was first bred in captivity at the Waikiki Aquarium in 1995 (a couple of other nautilus species had been bred earlier) and captive breeding remains a rare event even today. Unlike most cephalopods, the nautilus lacks a larval stage. The eggs are laid in crevices or between corals by the female. The nautilus shell of the young develops inside the egg and breaches the top of the egg before the nautilus fully emerges. Depending on water temperature, the eggs hatch after between 9 and 15 months. In 2017, it was bred at Monterey Bay Aquarium, which managed to film the young emerging from the egg. Like other nautilus but unlike most other cephalopods, chambered nautilus are relatively long-lived and only reach maturity when about 5 years old.

== Diet ==
As a carnivore, it feeds on both underwater carrion and detritus, as well as living shellfish and crab. Mainly scavengers, chambered nautiluses have been described as eating &quot;anything that smells&quot;. This food is stored in a stomach-like organ known as a crop, which can store food for a great deal of time without it denaturing.

==Subspecies==
Two subspecies of &quot;N. pompilius&quot; have been described: &quot;N. p. pompilius&quot; and &quot;N. p. suluensis.&quot;

&quot;N. p. pompilius&quot; is by far the most common and widespread of all nautiluses. It is sometimes called the emperor nautilus due to its large size. The distribution of &quot;N. p. pompilius&quot; covers the Andaman Sea east to Fiji and southern Japan south to the Great Barrier Reef. Exceptionally large specimens with shell diameters up to have been recorded from Indonesia and northern Australia. This giant form was described as Nautilus repertus, but most scientists do not consider it a separate species.

&quot;N. p. suluensis&quot; is a much smaller animal, restricted to the Sulu Sea in the southwestern Philippines, after which it is named. The largest known specimen measured 160 mm in shell diameter.

== Shell geometry ==

The chambered nautilus is often used as an example of the golden spiral. While nautiluses show logarithmic spirals, their ratios range from about 1.24 to 1.43, with an average ratio of about 1.33 to 1. The golden spiral&#x27;s ratio is 1.618. This is visible when the cut nautilus is inspected.

== Shell function ==
The shell of the chambered nautilus fulfills the function of buoyancy, which allows the nautilus to dive or ascend at will, by controlling the density and volume of the liquid within its shell chambers. This was found during research done in New Caledonia on nautiluses whose shell chamber fluid densities were tested at various depths, weeks apart. Generally speaking, chambered nautiluses inhabit a depth around 1000 feet, although further tests demonstrated that they can, and do, dive deeper. However, there are hazards associated with extreme depth for the nautilus: the shells of chambered nautiluses slowly fill with water at such depths, and they are only capable of withstanding depths up to 2000 feet before imploding due to pressure.

The chambered nautilus inhabits different segments of the shell as it grows, continuously growing new, larger &quot;cells&quot; into which it moves its internal organs as it grows in maturity. All of the smaller chambers, once uninhabited, are used in the method described above to regulate depth.

== In literature and art ==
Nautilus shells were popular items in the Renaissance cabinet of curiosities and were often mounted by goldsmiths on a thin stem to make extravagant nautilus shell cups, such as the Burghley Nef, mainly intended for display, or for ceremonial drinking, rather than for regular use. Small natural history collections were common in mid-19th-century Victorian homes, and chambered nautilus shells were popular decorations.

The chambered nautilus is the title and subject of a poem by Oliver Wendell Holmes, in which he admires the &quot;ship of pearl&quot; and the &quot;silent toil/That spread his lustrous coil/Still, as the spiral grew/He left the past year&#x27;s dwelling for the new.&quot; He finds in the mysterious life and death of the nautilus strong inspiration for his own life and spiritual growth. He concludes:

&lt;poem&gt;Build thee more stately mansions, O my soul,
As the swift seasons roll!
Leave thy low-vaulted past!
Let each new temple, nobler than the last,
Shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast,
Till thou at length art free,
Leaving thine outgrown shell by life&#x27;s unresting sea!&lt;/poem&gt;

A painting by Andrew Wyeth, entitled &quot;Chambered Nautilus&quot;, shows a woman in a canopied bed; the composition and proportions of the bed and the window behind it mirror those of a chambered nautilus lying on a nearby table.

The popular Russian rock band Nautilus Pompilius () is named after the species.

American composer and commentator Deems Taylor wrote a cantata entitled The Chambered Nautilus in 1916.

<doc id="685962" wikidata="Q386564" url="?curid=685962" title="Peter Ostrum">
<text>Peter Gardner Ostrum ( ; born November 1, 1957) is an American retired veterinarian and former child actor, whose only film role was as Charlie Bucket in the 1971 motion picture &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot;. 

Ostrum was 12 years old when selected by talent agents for &quot;Willy Wonka&quot;. Though he enjoyed the experience of shooting the film, he opted not to sign a three-film contract when it was over. After eschewing a career in film and theater, Ostrum became reluctant to speak about his one starring role. In 1990, he began an annual tradition of speaking to schoolchildren about the film, and he became a subject of interest again when the 2005 film &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; was released to theaters.

Ostrum became interested in his family&#x27;s horses when he returned from shooting &quot;Willy Wonka&quot;, and was particularly influenced by the veterinarian who tended to them. He received a Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine from Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine in 1984, and retired by late 2023. , he lived in Glenfield, New York with his wife Loretta (), having raised two children.

==Personal life==
Peter Gardner Ostrum was born in Dallas on November 1, 1957, to Dean Gardner Ostrum (1922–2014) and Sarepta Mabel (; 1922–2021). He is the youngest of four children. Ostrum was living in Cleveland at age twelve—a city of which he was described as a native by MSNBC, and later attended North Hunterdon Regional High School in Hunterdon County, New Jersey.

Ostrum married Loretta M. Lepkowski in . The couple have two children, Helenka and Leif, with the latter following his father onto the stage as the leading actor in several South Lewis Central School musicals. Ostrum and his wife lived in Glenfield, New York, as recently as 2021.

==&quot;Willy Wonka&quot;==
Ostrum was in the sixth grade and performing at the Cleveland Play House children&#x27;s theater, when he was noticed by talent agents who were searching nationwide for an actor to portray Charlie Bucket in &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot;. The agents took Polaroid photos of Ostrum and recorded him reading from the original novel, then returned to New York. Two months later, Ostrum was called to New York for a screen test where he sang &quot;My Country, &#x27;Tis of Thee&quot;, and a month after that, he was contacted and given ten days to prepare to leave for filming. Ostrum left for Munich on August 10, 1970.
In 2000, Ostrum recalled that shooting &quot;Willy Wonka&quot; in Munich was &quot;sort of like being an exchange student for five months&quot;. Fond memories of his five months in West Germany included watching the construction of Olympiapark, for the 1972 Summer Olympics, and working with Gene Wilder and Jack Albertson. As Ostrum had not worked in film before, Wilder took it upon himself to instruct the young actor in the business. Ostrum would later describe Wilder as a quirky yet gentle gentleman who &quot;treated people with respect and dignity&quot;. The bond that developed between the two actors was such that, even though they never saw each other again after filming &quot;Willy Wonka&quot;, Ostrum described Wilder&#x27;s 2016 death as &quot;like losing a parent&quot;; in the 2023 documentary &quot;Remembering Gene Wilder&quot;, Ostrum remembered Wilder being fun to work with, and not speaking down to the child actors.

Ostrum was tutored on-set for three hours a day, though sometimes only for 30–60 minutes at a time. Though in his audition he had been assured that his singing would probably be cut and dubbed, it was Ostrum&#x27;s own singing voice that made it to the screen—albeit significantly cut. In a 2011 interview, Ostrum told the story of how director Mel Stuart gave him a clapperboard from the film, but later asked how he got it because he had forgotten that he had done so; it is Ostrum&#x27;s only souvenir from the set.

After he finished shooting &quot;Willy Wonka&quot;, the then 13-year-old Ostrum declined David L. Wolper&#x27;s offer of a three-film contract. The teenager confided in Frawley Becker, his &quot;Willy Wonka&quot; dialogue coach, that he turned down the contract to retain &quot;the freedom to choose what he played, and in what picture.&quot; (Ostrum and Becker remained friends through at least 1996.) In January 2018, Ostrum said he sometimes misses acting—though not its hurry-up-and-wait nature—but feels he dodged having to make the transition from child- to adult-actor.

, Ostrum still received US$8–9 (equivalent to $– in ) of royalty payments about every three months.

===Lasting effect===

In his senior year, Ostrum was involved in film class and, at the interest of one of his instructors, looked back into theater and acting. After auditioning for, but not landing, several roles (including for Alan Strang in &quot;Equus&quot; on Broadway), Ostrum decided not to pursue it further. After putting his short film career behind him, Ostrum declined reporters and interviews, preferring not to speak on the subject; &quot;I wanted people to judge me on who I was, not what I’d done&quot;. For some time, Ostrum even lied and told people that his brother, and not he, had starred in the film. It took Ostrum years after moving to Lowville, New York, before he told anybody there about his one-time stardom; even his wife Loretta did not know about his role until he warned her about it just before she met his mother.

Since 1990, Ostrum has spoken to students at Lowville Academy once a year—on the last day of school, as a special treat—about his experience in &quot;Willy Wonka&quot; as well as his work in veterinary medicine. The students chiefly ask about the film&#x27;s special effects, and Ostrum describes to them &quot;what happened to Veruca, how did Violet blow up like a blueberry, how did Charlie fly with Grandpa Joe, all those types of questions&quot;. Ostrum also accepted an invitation to appear at the 2018 Snowtown Film Festival in Watertown, New York, answering audience questions after a screening of the film; &quot;it’s in my backyard—it&#x27;s become a popular event in January and I like to support local events.&quot; Ostrum said of the 2018 event that he enjoyed re-watching the film, and that people ask him &quot;great questions.&quot; Ostrum has been called &quot;the most famous man in Lowville&quot;, where the local video rental shop twice wore out its VHS copy of &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot;.

In the run-up to the release of &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; in 2005, Ostrum garnered a spate of attention that included seeing the film in New York City with NPR as well as being included in VH1&#x27;s list of &quot;100 Greatest Kid Stars&quot; (at 78th). On the new film, Ostrum quoted fellow &quot;Willy Wonka&quot; actor Julie Dawn Cole, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s sort of like going back to a house that you once lived in and it&#x27;s been redecorated.&quot; Ultimately, the media attention was so pervasive that Ostrum stopped answering his phone, and declined further interviews. Of the Johnny Depp-led film, he later said that it served to return &quot;the original film back to the forefront again.&quot; When interviewed about the production of 2023&#x27;s &quot;Wonka&quot;, Ostrum welcomed its expansion of the fictional universe, saying he was looking forward to the Timothée Chalamet-led prequel.

In October 2000, Ostrum and some of his co-stars from the film were scheduled to record an audio commentary for a special edition DVD. In January 2009, Ostrum teamed up with Dunkin&#x27; Donuts to hand out free rides on the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) at South Station in Boston; Ostrum&#x27;s participation connected the MBTA&#x27;s CharlieCards he was handing out with his portrayal of Charlie Bucket in &quot;Willy Wonka&quot;. The promotion also gave out one &quot;golden ticket&quot;, worth unlimited rides on MBTA and unlimited Dunkin&#x27; Donuts coffee for 2009. In commemoration of the film&#x27;s 40th anniversary in 2011, he joined &quot;Willy Wonka&quot; co-stars Denise Nickerson (Violet Beauregarde) and Paris Themmen (Mike Teevee) for a reunion commemorating the 40th anniversary of the film&#x27;s release in 2011. That year, they were also joined by Julie Dawn Cole (Veruca Salt) as guests on &quot;Top Chef: Just Desserts&quot; to taste contestants&#x27; creations.

==Veterinary career==

Soon after Ostrum returned home from filming &quot;Willy Wonka&quot;, his family acquired a horse; while the teenaged Ostrum was interested in the horse, it was the animal&#x27;s veterinarian that left a lasting impression on him: &quot;This person really enjoyed what he did for a living. My father was a lawyer, and I really didn&#x27;t have a clue what he did all day. But I knew exactly what the veterinarian did. Someone making a living from something he enjoyed so much really sparked my interest.&quot; Taking a hiatus from school between high school and college, Ostrum groomed horses and worked at the Delaware Equine Center in Pennsylvania. Ostrum contemplated a return to Hollywood, and even visited California for a week to &quot;test the waters&quot; there. He ultimately decided to pursue a degree in veterinary medicine instead, feeling that he would forever berate himself if he did not. In 1984, Peter Ostrum received his Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine from Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine.

By September 2023, Ostrum retired from the Countryside Veterinary Clinic in Lowville, New York, where he had worked mainly with horses and cows. He had also worked with &quot;Veterinarians on Call&quot;, a Pfizer-funded video series that highlighted the work of large animal veterinarians, and as a managing partner with Dairy Health &amp; Management Services.

<text>The Sealyham Terrier () is a rare Welsh breed of small to medium-sized terrier that originated in Wales as a working dog. It is principally a white-bodied, rough-coated breed, developed in the mid-to-late-19th century by Captain John Edwardes at Sealyham House, Pembrokeshire.

Following the First World War, it surged in popularity and was associated with Hollywood stars and members of the British royal family. Its numbers have dropped significantly since then, with the breed listed as a Vulnerable Native Breed by the Kennel Club; an all-time low was recorded in 2008 when only 43 puppies were registered in the United Kingdom. This decline has been blamed on an influx of foreign and designer breeds, and the Sealyham&#x27;s reduced usefulness as a working dog.

This breed is equally suitable as a family dog or a working terrier, given the right training. It is affected by few breed specific breed disorders, with the only two prevalent conditions being lens luxation and canine degenerative myelopathy. A DNA test is now readily available to identify dogs who carry the gene that causes lens luxation and breeding programmes can be adjusted.

== History ==

The breed was developed between 1850 and 1891 by Captain John Edwardes, at Sealyham House, near Wolfscastle in the Welsh county of Pembrokeshire. Originally the breed was used for pest control, to hunt small game, and to eliminate vermin, particularly badgers. The Welsh Corgi, Fox Terrier (Wire), and the now extinct English White Terrier all played a part in the make up of the Sealyham, although Edwardes did not keep records. He wanted a small white dog with a strong jaw, and a wiry coat. The white coat was particularly prized, as it meant that the hunter in the field could distinguish the dogs from the quarry. Edwardes culled weak dogs, and bred the stronger ones. After Edwardes&#x27; death in 1891, other breeders began to work with Sealyhams, including Fred Lewis, who promoted the breed.

The breed was shown for the first time in 1903, and the Sealyham Terrier club was created in 1908; the breed was officially recognised by the Kennel Club in 1911. The Sealyham Terrier now is recognised by all of the major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world. During the early stages of its recognition, the breed was alternatively known as the Welsh Border Terrier, or the Cowley Terrier. The American Sealyham Terrier Club was founded in 1913.

During the 1920s and 1930s, Sir Jocelyn Lucas used the dogs to hunt badgers which he usually relocated. At this time he also used Sealyham Terriers for hunting otters, stoats and squirrels. Deciding that he wanted a better hunting dog than the Sealyhams, bred for conformation showing, he cross-bred the dogs with the Norfolk Terrier. This resulted in an unrecognised breed of dog he called the Lucas Terrier, which he described as &quot;death to rats and rabbits&quot;.

The Sealyham surged in popularity after the First World War in the UK and the United States. Within the Hollywood film industry, the Sealyham became a fashionable dog to own by the Hollywood elite. The terrier was owned by actors Tallulah Bankhead, Humphrey Bogart, Bette Davis, Elizabeth Taylor, and by writer Agatha Christie. Cary Grant owned one which he named Archie Leach – Grant&#x27;s real name. Alfred Hitchcock had one of his Sealyham Terriers seen in his 1941 film &quot;Suspicion&quot;. Alfred Hitchcock can also be seen at the start of his 1963 film, &quot;The Birds&quot;, walking two of his Sealyham Terriers in a cameo appearance, although he also owned a third Sealyham not featured in the movie. The British royal family also favoured these dogs; King George V owned a dog named Jack. In 1959 one Sunday newspaper reported in the UK: &quot;A notice has been posted in Clarence House and Windsor Castle giving explicit instructions that when Princess Margaret has breakfast in bed, her two Sealyhams must be brought to the room along with her breakfast tray.&quot; These two dogs were called Pippin and Johnny, and were looked after by the Queen Mother when Princess Margaret fell ill. In the 1960s, children&#x27;s author Maurice Sendak owned a Sealyham named Jennie, which he featured in his 1967 work &quot;Higglety Pigglety Pop!&quot;.

The Sealyham was once one of the more popular terriers, and one of the best known Welsh breeds. Today, however, the Kennel Club (UK) lists the Sealyham as amongst the most endangered native breeds. In 2008, registrations of new puppies with the Kennel Club dropped to an all-time low of 43, placing it among the bottom three on the list of Vulnerable Native Breeds. In October 2011, British magazine &quot;Country Life&quot; highlighted the breed on its front cover, with the heading &quot;SOS: Save our Sealyhams&quot;, and launched a campaign to save the breed. End of year figures for 2011 showed that 49 puppies were registered with the Kennel Club in the UK, keeping them within the bottom three on the list of most endangered breeds.

Another notable Sealyham Terrier, Ch. Efbe&#x27;s Hidalgo At Goodspice, also known as Charmin, won Best In Show at Crufts in 2009, but his victory was not televised as the BBC had dropped the coverage of the competition earlier that year, following the controversy after the channel showed the documentary &quot;Pedigree Dogs Exposed&quot;. He had previous won the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in the United States in 2007, and the World Dog Show in 2008. While in retirement, Charmin attended many shows as a spectator until he died in October, 2018.

Harry Parsons, founder of the Working Sealyham Terrier Club, has stated that, &quot;To sustain a breed...you need between 300 to 500 puppies a year&quot;. The Kennel Club has blamed the decline of the breed on the availability of designer dogs and newer breeds such as the Shih Tzu, and the banning of tail docking which has reduced their ability as working dogs. Paul Keevil, formerly of the Kennel Club&#x27;s vulnerable breeds committee explains: &quot;Traditionally, soon after Sealyhams were born, their tails were docked by half their length, because they were small working dogs and they quite often got stuck down holes, meaning that they required short, strong tails for the owner to be able to pull them out.&quot; As of 2010, the breed is ranked 152nd out of 168 breeds according to registrations by the American Kennel Club. By 2017, the breed ranked 150 out of 190 breeds registered by the American Kennel Club. In 2023, a Sealyham Terrier named Stache won the US National Dog Show.

==Appearance==
Sealyhams measurements vary by breed standard according to particular countries. The Kennel Club breed standard states the height of a Sealyham Terrier should not exceed , measured at the withers or at the top of the shoulder blade. The American Kennel Club (AKC) standard states height to be &quot;about&quot; 10.5 inches at the withers. Weight for a Sealyham is also slightly different. The Kennel Club stating for females, or for males, with the AKC standard &quot;23 - 24 lbs for dogs; bitches slightly less.&quot;

They have a white double coat which requires regular brushing with a wire comb in order to prevent matting. It has a dense undercoat, while the outer coat is wiry and weather resistant. Markings on the face can be in a variety of colours including lemon, black, brown, blue, and badger, which is a mix of brown and black. Heavy body markings or patches or excessive ticking on the coat are discouraged. Sealyhams are low to the ground, and in muddy weather their long coats can become quite dirty. Sealyham coats are groomed by hand stripping, in order to keep the coat from becoming too soft. However, if they are not shown, Sealyhams can be clipped and this is often the preferred grooming approach for pets. As with many terriers, Sealyhams have essentially non-shedding coats.

== Temperament ==

Although happy in the company of others, they are fine if left alone. Sealyham Terriers are suited for both the town and country. They can be strong willed, occasionally vocal, and boisterous but also full of personality and affectionate. While they make for loyal family companions, they can be trained to be working dogs, making them excellent mousers or ratters. They can also be taught as puppies to get along with other animals, including cats and birds.

Harry Parsons described his Sealyhams thus: &quot;They make great companions, and the way they bond with their owners is almost magical. I keep six indoors, and if someone rings about an infestation and asks us to go ratting, they will know and are out of the door in a millisecond. If you train them, they&#x27;ll retrieve. They&#x27;ll do anything to please you.&quot;

==Health==
A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 13.1 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

The Sealyham Terrier is one of the more commonly affected breeds for primary lens luxation which is caused by an autosomal recessive mutation of the ADAMTS17 gene.

This in turn blocks the flow of fluids in the eye, leading to a painful increase in intra-ocular pressure (glaucoma) and often irreparable optic nerve damage, leading to visual field loss and eventual blindness.

As of November 2011, the Kennel Club has not highlighted any specific concerns regarding the breed&#x27;s health to conformation show judges. Due to the low numbers of the breed, two of the most prevalent problems facing the breed today is the popular sire effect and the general problem of genetic diversity within the breed.
The breed is predisposed to atopic dermatitis.

<text>is a Japanese geographical term. It means both an ancient division of the country and the main road running through it. The road connected provincial capitals in this region. It was part of the Gokishichidō system.

The Nankaidō encompassed the pre-Meiji provincial lands of Kii and Awaji, plus the four provinces that made up the island of Shikoku: Awa, Sanuki, Tosa, and Iyo.

The road extended from Nara to the seacoast to the south on the Kii Peninsula of the island of Honshū in Japan and crossing the sea, extended to Yura (nowadays Sumoto) and then Shikoku.

==Nankaidō earthquakes==

:&quot;See List of tsunamis for a full list of Nankai quakes with tsunami.&quot;
Many historic earthquakes bear the name &quot;Nankai&quot; or &quot;Nankaido&quot;, as specific epicenters were known at the time. Often quakes take on the Japanese era name along with location such as Nankaido. These include:
*1498 Meiō Nankaidō earthquake
*1605 Keichō Nankaidō earthquake
*1854 Ansei-Nankai earthquake
*1944 Tōnankai earthquake
*1946 Nankai earthquake (南海地震) measuring 8.4 hit at 4:19 [local time] there was a catastrophic earthquake on the southwest of Japan in the Nankai area. It was felt almost everywhere in the central and western parts of the country. The tsunami washed away 1451 houses, caused 1500 deaths in Japan, and was observed on tide gauges in California, Hawaii, and Peru.

<doc id="685975" wikidata="Q11949" url="?curid=685975" title="Dick Advocaat">
<text>Dirk Nicolaas &quot;Dick&quot; Advocaat (; born 27 September 1947) is a Dutch former football player and coach. He is the current manager of the Curaçao national football team.

Advocaat was successful as a football player and as a coach, including three stints with the Netherlands national team. He has coached a number of clubs in the Netherlands and abroad (including the Russian club Zenit Saint Petersburg, with which he won the 2008 UEFA Cup Final), as well as the national teams of a number of countries, including South Korea, Belgium and Russia. His nickname is &quot;The Little General&quot;, a reference to his mentor Rinus Michels.

==Club career==
Advocaat was born in The Hague and was a defensive midfielder during his playing days. His career began as an 18-year-old with Hague club ADO Den Haag, and he made his professional debut with the club on 21 May 1967 in a 3–0 win against GVAV. He only featured for Den Haag once more that season, and that summer, the San Francisco Golden Gate Gales franchise imported the Den Haag team, which included Advocaat, to play for six weeks in the United Soccer Association as part of an effort to make the sport more popular in the United States. It was the following season that Advocaat won his only honour as a player, the KNVB Cup, in 1968. In the 1969–70 season, he became a regular in the side, making 29 appearances and scoring his first goal for the club. He made 33 appearances the season after that. From the 1971–72, the club merged with Holland Sport to become FC Den Haag. That season, his final one for the club, Advocaat made a further 66 appearances and scored 6 goals. In total, he made 147 appearances and scored 7 goals for the club.

From 1973, Advocaat&#x27;s playing career continued for Roda JC until he moved to VVV-Venlo during the 1976–77 season. With Roda JC, Advocaat made 121 total appearances and scored 2 goals. When the club was to be discontinued in 2009, Goal.com described him as their most famous player. In his first season with VVV-Venlo, Advocaat scored 2 goals in 20 appearances. He made 33 appearances in the 1977–78 season, scoring four goals, and made a further 21 appearances in his final season at the club. In total, he made 74 appearances and scored 6 goals.

In 1978, Advocaat made the move to the United States to play with the Chicago Sting in the North American Soccer League (NASL). That season, he made 24 appearances, scoring two goals. In 1979, he scored three more goals in 28 appearances and for the 1980 season, he scored one further goal from 29 appearances. During the break between the 1979 and 1980 NASL seasons, Advocaat returned to the Netherlands and made 11 appearances, scoring one goal, for his former club, FC Den Haag.

Following the 1980 NASL season, Advocaat moved to Sparta Rotterdam to play the remainder of the 1980–81 season. He spent 18 months at the club, scoring six goals and making 61 appearances. Following that, Advocaat moved to Belgium and played in the second division for K. Berchem Sport. However, he only made ten appearances there before moving back to the Eredivisie to join Utrecht, where he made 39 more appearances before the end of his playing career.

==Coaching career==

===1981–92: Early coaching in the Netherlands===
In addition to playing football, Advocaat was a physical education teacher and became involved in coaching in 1981 when his older brother Jaap was offered a job running amateur Saturday football side Door Samenwerking Verkregen Pijnacker (DSVP). Jaap did not take the role but recommended Dick for the job. Advocaat coached this side during the final four years of his playing career with Sparta Rotterdam and Utrecht.

In 1984, Advocaat was unexpectedly appointed as assistant to Netherlands national team head coach Rinus Michels. Advocaat became a protégé of Michels, whose sobriquet was &quot;The General&quot;. In reference to this, Advocaat acquired the nickname &quot;The Little General&quot;. In 1987, Advocaat became manager of his first professional club, HFC Haarlem, which he led for two years. Haarlem finished in ninth place in the 1987–88 season and tenth place in the 1988–89 season. Haarlem were eliminated in the second round of the KNVB Cup in both seasons.

Advocaat then moved to Schiedamse Voetbal Vereniging (SVV) as manager. At SVV, alongside technical director Wim Jansen, Advocaat led the team to become Eerste Divisie champions in the 1989–90 season to win promotion to the 1990–91 Eredivisie, winning by 15 points. In 1991, SVV merged with neighbouring club Dordrecht &#x27;90, which failed to win promotion to the 1991 play-offs. SVV had finished 16th the previous season, but remained in the Eredivisie after winning their relegation play-off. The two teams competed as SVV/Dordrecht &#x27;90 during the 1991–92 season, where they finished in 15th place. and became FC Dordrecht the following season, after Advocaat had left. Despite success at both clubs, Advocaat was criticised in his initial coaching years for playing defensive football.

===1992–98: Dutch national team and PSV Eindhoven===
In 1990, Advocaat once more became an assistant to Michels, who was having his fourth spell as coach of the Dutch national team and looking to qualify for UEFA Euro 1992. At Euro 1992, it became apparent it would be Michels&#x27; last job, and following the tournament, Advocaat took over as national coach. Advocaat lost his first two matches in charge, a friendly against Italy and a 1994 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Norway. During the qualifying campaign, Advocaat and Ruud Gullit fell out; Gullit was unhappy with Advocaat&#x27;s tactics in the World Cup qualifier against England and was eventually substituted. Following this, Gullit retired from international football, but was widely expected to return with a change of administration in the summer. Advocaat qualified for the World Cup, following a crucial win against qualification rivals England. Despite the result, Advocaat was scheduled to lose his job to Johan Cruyff for the 1994 World Cup. However, talks between Cruyff and the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB) broke down at the last minute and Advocaat retained his position, causing Gullit to remain in retirement although he initially joined the Dutch squad for the 1994 World Cup. In 1993, the Dutch national team had a record of five wins and two draws.

At the World Cup, Advocaat led the Dutch to the quarter-finals, where they lost 3–2 to eventual winners Brazil. Following the World Cup, Advocaat returned to manage at club level. His final match was a 5–0 win against Luxembourg.

Advocaat returned to coaching at club level with PSV on 16 December 1994, taking over from interim manager Kees Rijvers. His first match was 1–0 loss against Ajax on 1 January 1995. PSV finished third that season. Coming to the club, Advocaat coached existing players Ronaldo and Luc Nilis, and in 1995–96, Advocaat&#x27;s first full season with the club, he led PSV to second place in the Eredivisie. They also won that year&#x27;s KNVB Cup, which qualified them for the following years UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. Over the summer, Advocaat signed Jaap Stam, and in the 1996–97 season, PSV won the Eredivisie title and qualified for the UEFA Champions League the following year. In June 1998, Advocaat left the club. PSV also won the Johan Cruyff Shield, the Dutch Super Cup, in 1996 and 1997.

===1998–2001: Rangers===
In 1998, Advocaat accepted the invitation from Rangers chairman David Murray to become the Scottish Premier League (SPL) team&#x27;s new manager. Walter Smith was still in the job but had announced his departure in advance.

When Advocaat took charge of Rangers, he became the first foreign manager to do so and only the tenth manager in the history of the club. The previous season was the last of seven under Walter Smith, and the first time the club had finished without a trophy in 12 years. Long-term members of the squad that had won nine league championships in a row left, including Ally McCoist, Ian Durrant, Andy Goram and Stuart McCall. With financial backing from chairman David Murray, Advocaat invested heavily in the team. Big money signings such as Giovanni van Bronckhorst, Arthur Numan and Andrei Kanchelskis were among Advocaat&#x27;s first as Rangers tried to regain the league championship.

In Advocaat&#x27;s first season, 1998–99, Rangers won the domestic treble, finishing six points above second-place Celtic in the league, defeating Celtic 1–0 in the Scottish Cup final, and defeating St. Johnstone 2–1 in the League Cup final. The club also had a short run in the UEFA Cup, where they reached the round of 16. In the following season, the club won the SPL by an SPL record 21-point margin, and also won the 1999–2000 Scottish Cup. Rangers fans paid tribute to Advocaat and the Dutch Rangers players at the 2000 Scottish Cup Final by wearing replica orange Netherlands international tops and other orange merchandise. Advocaat also guided Rangers into the UEFA Champions League, having beaten UEFA Cup winners Parma in the third round qualifier. However, Rangers went out of the group stage after being drawn alongside Bayern Munich, PSV and Valencia. The club then lost to Borussia Dortmund in a penalty shoot out in the UEFA Cup.

Advocaat&#x27;s third season at Rangers was less successful. Despite investment in the team with players such as Tore André Flo for a record £12 million, Rangers failed to win any trophies, as Celtic under new manager Martin O&#x27;Neill won the domestic treble. Advocaat branded some of his players &quot;fat-necks&quot; in the press. In Europe, Rangers qualified for the UEFA Champions league for the second consecutive season after two qualifying rounds. They were drawn alongside Sturm Graz, Galatasaray and Monaco. After good results against Sturm Graz and Monaco, the club failed to qualify for the next phase of the competition, finishing third behind Galatasaray on goal difference. Rangers then lost 3–0 to 1. FC Kaiserslautern in the UEFA Cup.

In his last season at Rangers, with Celtic leading the SPL by 12 points, Advocaat resigned from the manager&#x27;s position on 12 December 2001. His final match was a 1–1 draw against Hibernian. Alex McLeish was appointed as his successor, with Advocaat moving to the position of general manager. Advocaat eventually left Rangers for the Netherlands national team. More than a decade later, in March 2012, Advocaat&#x27;s reign as manager came under scrutiny as Rangers entered administration. Advocaat defended the money spent on transfer fees and said he did not think the club would go bankrupt.

===2002–06: International management and Mönchengladbach===
Advocaat rejoined the national team set-up following Louis van Gaal&#x27;s failure to take the national team to the 2002 World Cup in January 2002 and presided over the Netherlands qualification for Euro 2004 via the playoffs. His first match was 1–1 draw against England. The &quot;Oranje&quot; had finished second in their group behind the Czech Republic&lt;ref name=&quot;EURO Qualifiers 2002/2003 » Group 3&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore went into a playoff in order to qualify for Euro 2004. They managed to achieve this after a 6–1 aggregate win over Scotland but not before surviving a harrowing encounter, losing 1–0 in the first leg in Scotland. Advocaat was criticised by the Dutch media so much so that several of the team&#x27;s players refused to speak to the media even after the comfortable and inspired 6–0 victory in the return leg at the Amsterdam Arena.

Despite taking Netherlands to the semi-finals of Euro 2004, the Dutch media were critical of Advocaat. Netherlands were beaten 2–1 by Portugal in the semi-finals of Euro 2004 after a dismal performance. The team also made several criticisms of his tactics, especially those in the team&#x27;s shock loss to the Czech Republic in the second match of the first round of the tournament. In that match, Advocaat made a tactical change that shocked even his own players, as he brought on the aging Paul Bosvelt in midfield to replace crowd favourite Arjen Robben, who had been contributing immensely throughout the match with two assists. The Czechs seized the opportunity to capitalize on it and scored the decisive goal. Shortly after the tournament, with mounting pressure and even death threats, Advocaat quit his job as head coach on 6 July 2004.

Advocaat then went briefly back into club management. He was hired by German club Borussia Mönchengladbach on 2 November 2004. His first match was a 1–1 draw against Mainz 05 on 6 November 2004. He resigned on 18 April 2005 after less than six months at the helm. His final match was 1–1 draw against Mainz 05 on 16 April 2005. He finished with a record of four wins, six draws, and eight losses.

In July 2005, Advocaat signed a one-year contract to become coach of the United Arab Emirates national team, but he terminated this contract in September to become manager of South Korea&#x27;s national team from 1 October 2005 until the end of the 2006 World Cup. During his tenure with the UAE, Advocaat was manager for two matches at the 1st International Arab Friendly Tournament in Switzerland. UAE won the first match against Kuwait 7–6 on penalties after the match had finished 1–1. They then lost the final to Egypt 4–5 on penalties, following a 0–0 draw in normal time.

Advocaat&#x27;s first match in charge of South Korea was a friendly against Iran on 12 October 2005, which South Korea won 2–0. Two more friendlies were played that year in November, a draw against Sweden and a victory against Serbia.

In early 2006, during the break between domestic seasons, Advocaat took a 23-man squad of players from the K-League and J-League and embarked on a five-week, ten-match tour. It started with an Advocaat&#x27;s first defeat as manager against the UAE. From there they travelled to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where they drew with Greece and won against Finland. Then they travelled to Hong Kong to take part in the Carlsberg Cup, where they defeated Croatia before losing in the final to Denmark. They then travelled to America where they lost to Costa Rica, won against Major League Soccer (MLS) side LA Galaxy and Mexico. The tour finished in Aleppo, Syria, on 22 February 2006 with an Asian Cup qualifying match against Syria which they won 2–1, ending the tour with six wins, one draw and three losses. In the lead up to the World Cup, South Korea played five more friendlies, winning two, drawing two and losing one.

At the World Cup, South Korea opened their campaign with a 2–1 victory over Togo. In their second group match, they scored a late equalizer to draw 1–1 against France, putting them in a position to qualify from Group G. However, South Korea failed to make it into the last 16 after a 2–0 loss against Switzerland, while France defeated Togo 2–0 to advance to the next round. Following Korea&#x27;s exit from the World Cup, Advocaat resigned.

===2006–09: Zenit Saint Petersburg===
In December 2005, gas giant Gazprom took over as owners of Russian Premier League team Zenit Saint Petersburg. After a mediocre start to the season, manager Vlastimil Petržela was sacked in the summer. On 26 June 2006, Advocaat was appointed in his place, signing an 18-month contract with the option of a one-year extension. Zenit finished the 2006 season in fourth place, earning a place in the 2007–08 UEFA Cup second qualifying round. In December 2006, the Russian Premier League transfer record was broken twice, first with the signing of Pavel Pogrebnyak and then again when Zenit bought Alejandro Domínguez.
For the 2007 season, Advocaat led Zenit to their first domestic league title since the Soviet Union was disbanded. Zenit won by two points over second–place Spartak Moscow. Andrey Arshavin stood out as the star player of the season, being the only member of the team to start all 30 league matches. Advocaat became the first foreign coach to win the Russian championship and, by winning the league, Zenit qualified for the group stage of the Champions League the following season. In August, Advocaat had signed a deal to become manager of the Australia national team, however when Zenit offered him a new US$4 million contract extension in November, Advocaat reneged on the deal with Australia. In Europe, Zenit qualified for the group stage of the UEFA Cup. Zenit finished third in their group and advanced to the last 32 of the competition. They progressed to the quarter-finals coming through matches against Villarreal and Marseille on the away goals rule.


Prior to the start of the 2008 domestic season, as league winners, Zenit faced Russian Cup winners Lokomotiv Moscow in the Russian Super Cup on 9 March 2008; Zenit won the match 2–0. Continuing in the UEFA Cup, Zenit were victorious against German clubs Bayer Leverkusen and Bayern Munich to reach the final against Rangers, Advocaat&#x27;s former club. In the final, played on 14 May 2008, Zenit won 2–0 to become only the second Russian team to ever win a European trophy. On 24 August 2008, Dynamo Moscow player Danny transferred to Zenit for a Russian record transfer fee of €30 million (£23 million). The arrival of Danny increased speculation that Arshavin was to leave the club, but the club rejected substantial bids from both Barcelona and Tottenham Hotspur in the summer transfer window, despite the player&#x27;s strong desire to leave the club.

On 29 August 2008, Zenit contested with Champions League winners Manchester United for the European Super Cup. Zenit won the match 2–1 with new signing Danny scoring the decisive goal. In Europe, Zenit failed to advance from their Champions League group but finished third which meant they entered into the last 32 of the UEFA Cup. That year, Zenit finished fifth domestically, qualifying for the play-offs of the Europa League the following season. On 7 November 2008, Advocaat signed a one-year extension that contracted him to the club until the end of 2009. In December, Advocaat was named Trainer of the Year in Russia.

In January 2009, Arshavin was heavily rumoured to move again. Towards the end of the winter transfer window, the Russian threatened to strike if he was not sold. Arshavin transferred to Arsenal at the last-minute for around £16.9 million. In February, Zenit&#x27;s UEFA Cup continued and Zenit progressed to the last 16. They failed to reach the quarter-finals, though, losing to Udinese 2–1 on aggregate. In the domestic season, Advocaat fielded seven foreign players in a team selection (one more than the league rules allow) against Lokomotiv Moscow in April 2009. Advocaat admitted he was at fault for the mistake and the club were fined but not deducted points. In May 2009, Advocaat agreed to become manager of the Belgium national team when his contract with Zenit expired on 1 January 2010. However, on 10 August 2009, after run of poor results, he was sacked by the club with Zenit seventh in the league. His final match was a 2–0 loss to Tom Tomsk on 9 August 2009. Zenit were in seventh place at the time of the dismissal.

===2009–10: Belgium and AZ===
Before his dismissal from Zenit, Advocaat had already agreed a two-year, US$1,688,400 contract as manager of Belgium to start in 2010. However, when Belgium failed to qualify for the 2010 World Cup, Franky Vercauteren resigned as manager and Advocaat&#x27;s contract was brought forward to commence on 1 October 2009. Advocaat&#x27;s first two matches in charge were the remaining fixtures in the qualifying campaign, a 2–0 victory against Turkey and a 2–0 defeat to Estonia. In the remainder of 2009, Belgium won in friendly matches against Hungary and Qatar. Belgium lost their first match of 2010 in a friendly against Croatia.

On 6 December 2009, it was announced Advocaat would function as manager of both the Belgium national team and Dutch club AZ. Advocaat succeeded Ronald Koeman, who was dismissed the previous day, and his contract ran until the end of the 2009–10 season. Advocaat only watched AZ&#x27;s final group match of the Champions League on 9 December 2009, which Martin Haar managed. He was officially presented to the media the following day. His first match in charge was against PSV in the Eredivisie on 12 December 2009; AZ lost 1–0. His first win managing the club came the following weekend, a 3–0 win against ADO Den Haag. Belgium lost to Croatia on 3 March 2010.

On 15 April 2010, Advocaat left as manager of the Belgian national team after breaking his contract with the Royal Belgian Football Association (KBVB) amid speculation he was to become coach of the Russia national team. Advocaat was later appointed Russia manager and announced his intention to leave AZ at the end of the season. On 22 April 2010, it was announced that Gertjan Verbeek would take over as AZ manager for the following season. Under Advocaat, AZ finished fifth in the league, entering the third qualifying round of the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League.

===2010–12: Russia===

On 17 May 2010, Advocaat was named the new manager of the Russia national team. He began his contract on 1 July, succeeding compatriot Guus Hiddink. Advocaat signed a four-year contract.

Advocaat&#x27;s side began their qualifying campaign for Euro 2012 with an unexpected defeat at home to Slovakia. However, Russia managed to win their group and secure automatic qualification to the Euro 2012 finals.

Russia began the participation of Euro 2012 (Group A) promising by defeating the Czech Republic 4–1 and playing a 1–1 draw against hosts Poland. However, the team ultimately failed to pass the group stage after losing to Greece 1–0 in the last match. It was already decided before the tournament that Advocaat would leave to take charge of PSV.

===2012–14: Return to PSV and AZ; Serbian national team===

Advocaat signed a contract with Dutch giants PSV. The contract began on 1 July 2012. He replaced Fred Rutten, who was sacked in March 2012. For Advocaat, it was a return to the club from which he had his first success.

Advocaat began his new job with a win in the show competition 2012 Polish Masters, followed up by beating Ajax 4–2 to secure the 2012 Johan Cruyff Shield. The 2012–13 Eredivisie campaign under Advocaat began with a shock defeat to RKC Waalwijk. At the winter break, PSV were leading the league table on goal difference over Twente. In the Europa League, PSV finished third in Group F.

After finishing second to champions Ajax in the Eredivisie, and losing the cup final to AZ, Advocaat announced his retirement from club coaching at the end of the 2012–13 season. However, on 15 October 2013, he returned to AZ to succeed the sacked Gertjan Verbeek. He was replaced at the end of the season by Marco van Basten. AZ finished the season in eighth place. He also reached the semi–finals of the KNVB Cup and the quarter–finals of the Europa League.

In July 2014, Advocaat was named the new manager of the Serbia national team. As the beginning of the UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying, Serbia earned just one single point in three matches: Serbia drew 1–1 with Armenia; forfeited (3–0 loss) their match against Albania because of stadium incidents during the match; then lost 3–1 to Denmark. Advocaat agreed to terminate his contract following the 3–1 home defeat against Denmark on 14 November 2014.

===2015: Sunderland===

Following the sacking of manager Gus Poyet, Advocaat was appointed manager of English Premier League club Sunderland on 17 March 2015 until the end of the season. Initially, Advocaat was appointed on temporary basis. His first match in charge was a 1–0 loss to West Ham United four days later. His first win as manager came from his second match, a 1–0 victory over Newcastle United in the Tyne–Wear derby on 5 April 2015. Following a 4–1 home defeat to Crystal Palace, Advocaat oversaw a turnaround in Sunderland&#x27;s form with a 1–1 draw at Stoke City, and back to back wins against Southampton and Everton.

Advocaat guided Sunderland to Premier League safety on 20 May 2015 with one match remaining after a 0–0 draw at Arsenal, and a visibly moved Advocaat was pictured in tears after the final whistle. Sunderland finished the season in 16th place, two spots and three points above the relegation zone.

He left the club a week later, announcing the end of his managerial career, but reversed his decision to retire on 4 June 2015, signing a one-year contract with Sunderland. During the summer transfer window, the club made two major signings in winger Jeremain Lens, who previously played under Advocaat at PSV, and striker Fabio Borini, who played for Sunderland on loan during the 2013–14 season. The club also signed several defenders and secured the loan signings of Yann M&#x27;Vila, DeAndre Yedlin and Ola Toivonen, the latter having also played under Advocaat at PSV. Despite the additions, Sunderland made a poor start to the season with a 4–2 away defeat at Leicester City on 8 August and a 1–3 home defeat to newly promoted Norwich City the following week. Following a 2–2 draw with West Ham, Advocaat resigned on 4 October 2015. His only win in the 2015–16 season was a 6–3 victory against Exeter City on 25 August 2015 in the League Cup. At the time of Advocaat&#x27;s resignation, Sunderland were in 19th place and in the relegation zone. He finished with a record of four wins, six draws and nine losses.

===2016: Fenerbahçe===
On 17 August 2016, Advocaat signed a one-year contract with Turkish Süper Lig club Fenerbahçe. His first match in charge was a 2016–17 UEFA Europa League home tie against Grasshopper, which Fenerbahçe won 3–0. On 3 November, Advocaat led Fenerbahçe to a 2–1 win at home against Manchester United in the fourth group stage match of the Europa League and finished the group stage in first place, above United, with 13 points.

===2017: Netherlands===
On 9 May 2017, Advocaat was revealed as the new manager of the Netherlands, his third spell in charge of the national team. His first match in charge was the World Cup qualifier at home against Luxembourg on 9 June, which the Netherlands won 5–0. He was joined by Ruud Gullit as his assistant, whom Advocaat previously clashed with in his first spell in charge of the &quot;Oranje&quot;.
After failing to qualify to the World Cup, Advocaat stepped down following the November friendlies against Scotland and Romania. With victories in both matches, he became the most successful Netherlands manager in terms of winning, with a total number of 37 victories, a record previously held by Bob Glendenning for 77 years.

===2018: Sparta Rotterdam===
On 25 December 2017, Sparta Rotterdam announced that Advocaat would be the club&#x27;s new manager for the remainder of the 2017–18 season. On 20 May 2018 Sparta was relegated to the Eerste Divisie following a 1–3 loss to FC Emmen in the Promotion/relegation play-offs.

===FC Utrecht===
On 12 September FC Utrecht announced they had a verbal agreement with Advocaat to finish the 2018-2019 season, after their previous manager had been sacked after 4 games.

===Feyenoord===
On 30 October 2019, Feyenoord announced that Dick Advocaat was appointed as the club&#x27;s coach for the remainder of the 2019–20 Eredivisie season after their previous manager Jaap Stam had resigned. On 3 November 2019, Feyenoord played their first game under Dick Advocaat, winning 3-0 in an away game against VVV-Venlo. On 21 April 2020, Feyenoord announced that the club and Advocaat had reached an agreement for Advocaat to continue being the club&#x27;s coach for the 2020–21 season. On 12 September 2020, Advocaat become the oldest coach in the history of the Dutch Eredivisie at 72 years and 351 days old.

===Iraq===
On 1 August 2021, he was unveiled as the new head coach of Iraq national football team to lead them in the FIFA World Cup Qualifiers. However, he didn&#x27;t manage a win in 6 games, with 4 draws and 2 losses. He resigned on 23 November 2021.

===ADO Den Haag===
On 28 November 2022, Advocaat was appointed as the new manager of a struggling ADO Den Haag side, after former manager Dirk Kuyt had been fired after an unsuccessful spell at the club. Advocaat retired as a coach at the end of the 2022–23 season as ADO Den Haag finished the season in mid-table of the second-tier Eerste Divisie.

=== Curaçao ===
On 15 January 2024, Advocaat was appointed as the new head coach of the Curaçao national football team, signing a one-year contract with an option for a further year.

<text>Sixteen Candles is a 1984 American coming-of-age teen comedy film starring Molly Ringwald, Michael Schoeffling, and Anthony Michael Hall. Written and directed by John Hughes in his directorial debut, it was the first in a string of films Hughes would direct, centering on teenage life. The film follows newly 16-year-old Samantha Baker (Ringwald), who deals with a seemingly unrequited crush on high school senior Jake Ryan (Schoeffling) while also being pursued by freshman Farmer Ted (Hall).

Hughes began development on &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; in 1982, and after signing a three-picture deal with Universal Pictures, he chose the cast of the film and began filming in July 1983. Initially receiving an R rating from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), Hughes successfully lobbied for the film to be released with a PG rating.

&quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; was theatrically released by Universal in the United States on May 4, 1984. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, who particularly praised Ringwald&#x27;s performance, and was a box office success, earning $23.6 million against a $6.5 million budget.

Retrospectively considered to be one of Hughes&#x27;s best films, &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; helped launch the careers of Ringwald, Schoeffling, and Hall. A television series from Peacock based on the film entered development in 2022.

==Plot==
In suburban Chicago, high school sophomore Samantha &quot;Sam&quot; Baker is hopeful her 16th birthday is the beginning of a great new year, but is shocked when her family forgets the occasion because her older, beautiful, self-absorbed sister Ginny is getting married the next day.

At school, Sam fills out a friend&#x27;s sex quiz where she reveals her crush on senior classmate Jake Ryan. Meanwhile, Jake, having noticed how Sam looks at him, asks his friend Rock about her. Rock dismisses her as immature and reminds him he is already in a relationship with another popular girl at school, Caroline, but Jake says he is frustrated by Caroline&#x27;s constant partying. On the bus ride home, Sam fends off repeated flirtations from geeky freshman Ted.

At home, Sam&#x27;s day gets worse when she discovers she must sleep on the sofa because her grandparents and a foreign exchange student named Long Duk Dong are all staying at the house for the wedding. She is further upset when her grandparents also do not remember her birthday and have Dong go with her to a dance at school that night.

At the dance, Sam pines for Jake while Dong has attracted the powerful and strong jock, Marlene. Ted, trying to impress his friends Bryce and Wease, dances with Sam, who runs off in tears. In an effort to salvage his reputation with all the geeks, Ted bets Bryce and Wease a dozen floppy disks that he will get physical with Sam before the dance ends. As proof, Bryce and Wease demand Sam&#x27;s underwear. Jake asks Ted about Sam, having seen them dancing.

Ted apologizes to Sam, who opens up about her family forgetting her birthday and her crush on Jake. Ted tells her that Jake asked about her and Sam is shocked and asks what Ted thinks she should do. Despite his genuine interest in Sam, Ted encourages her to talk to Jake, and she agrees. Before she leaves, he gets her underwear to win his bet and he, Bryce, and Wease charge the other freshmen boys a dollar to see it. Meanwhile, Sam tries to approach Jake, but loses her nerve and runs off. Jake and Caroline leave the dance, leaving Sam thinking Jake does not like her, and vice-versa.

At Jake&#x27;s house, Caroline and her friends have started a wild party. Jake, angry with Caroline, retreats to his bedroom and tries calling Sam, but her grandparents answer the phone, and (after they yell at him for waking them up) tell him that Sam isn&#x27;t interested. After the party, Jake is furious at the damage left behind. He finds Ted trapped under a glass coffee table after having knocked over the beer can pyramid. Ted tells Jake that Sam is interested in him and Jake confesses that he has lost interest in Caroline. He takes Sam&#x27;s underwear from Ted and, in exchange, lets Ted take a drunken Caroline home in his father&#x27;s Rolls-Royce Corniche. To further impress the geeks, Ted stops at Bryce and Wease&#x27;s house to get Wease to take a picture of him with Caroline in the expensive car, but the finished picture only reveals the top of Ted&#x27;s head.

Sam&#x27;s father apologizes for forgetting her birthday, and tells her that if Jake does not see what a wonderful person she is, then he is not worth Sam&#x27;s time. She lies on the couch thinking of Jake, not knowing that he is also thinking of her. The next morning, Sam&#x27;s mother also apologizes to her and everyone heads to the church for the wedding. Jake arrives at Sam&#x27;s house, where a hungover Dong miscommunicates that Sam is at church getting married. Jake finds Caroline and Ted making out in the back of his dad&#x27;s banged-up car, and then Jake and Caroline break up. Jake then surprises Sam at the church after the wedding and invites her back to his house. That night, Jake gives Sam her underwear back, and a birthday cake with sixteen candles on it. He tells her to make a wish and she tells him her wish already came true. They kiss as the film fades to black.

==Cast==
==Production==

=== Development ===
John Hughes originally wrote &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; in 1982 as a low-budget production which A&amp;M Films agreed to finance for $1 million. The film went into turnaround, but Hughes attracted more interest in his screenplays after writing the successful film &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot; (1983). After Hughes was fired from his next film &quot;Mr. Mom&quot; (1983), he decided to resume pre-production on &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; as his directorial debut as he felt it had more commercial appeal to his teenage target audience than his other planned film &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; (1985). After Hughes was rehired on &quot;Mr. Mom&quot;, Ned Tanen greenlit both films at Universal Pictures under a three-year $30 million contract on the condition that Hughes release &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; first.

=== Casting ===
John Hughes had asked his agent for headshots of young actresses, and among those he received were those of Robin Wright, Molly Ringwald and Ally Sheedy. Sheedy had auditioned for the role of Sam, but was dropped because Hughes thought Ringwald was more fitting for the role. He called her a year later to give her a role in &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;. Inspired by Ringwald&#x27;s appearance, he put the photo up over his desk and wrote the film just over a weekend with her in mind for the lead role.

For the male lead in the film, it had come down to Schoeffling and Viggo Mortensen. Ringwald pursued Mortensen to get the role. Emilio Estevez also auditioned for Jake. For the part of Ted, Hughes saw a number of actors for the role including Jim Carrey, Jon Cryer, Keith Coogan and Ralph Macchio. &quot;Every single kid who came in to read for the part... did the whole, stereotyped high school nerd thing. You know—thick glasses, ball point pens in the pocket, white socks. But when Michael came in he played it straight, like a real human being. I knew right at that moment that I&#x27;d found my geek.&quot; Paul Dooley initially turned down the role of Sam&#x27;s father as he was in it initially for two or three minutes and the last two or three minutes, then finally Hughes called him told he wrote the scene in the middle of the film so that he will be in the film and he accepted it.

=== Filming ===
Principal photography began on July 11, 1983&quot;.&quot; &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; was filmed primarily in and around the Chicago North Shore suburban communities of Evanston, Skokie, and Highland Park, Illinois during the summer of 1983, when leads Ringwald and Hall were 15 years old. Most of the exterior scenes and some of the interior scenes were filmed at Niles East High School, close to downtown Skokie, the setting for Hall&#x27;s driving the Rolls-Royce. A cafeteria scene and a gym scene were filmed at Niles North High School. The auto shop scene was filmed at Niles East High School in the auto shop. The Baker house is located at 3022 Payne Street in Evanston. The church (Glencoe Union Church at 263 Park Avenue) and parking lot where the final scenes take place are in Glencoe. The Motion Picture Association of America initially rated the film R, but Hughes won an appeal for it to be released as PG.

==Home media==
Pre-2003 releases of the film featured a re-scored soundtrack due to rights issues. This wasn&#x27;t until 2003 when the film was released on DVD with the original theatrical soundtrack intact albeit remixed in 5.1. In 2008, the film was again released on DVD as a &quot;Flashback Edition&quot; with a new featurette titled &quot;Celebrating Sixteen Candles&quot;.

In 2012, the film was released on Blu-ray for the first time as part of Universal&#x27;s 100th Anniversary with the 2008 featurette carried over, along with two new features highlighting the impact of Universal Studios: &quot;The 80s&quot; and &quot;Unforgettable Characters&quot;.

In 2019, Universal re-released the film on Blu-ray in a digipak highlighting its 35th anniversary. The disc was the same 2012 release with nothing new added. In that same year, Arrow Video announced their release with a new 4K restoration.

==Reception==

===Box office===
In its opening weekend the film grossed $4,461,520 in 1,240 theaters in the United States and Canada, ranking second. By the end of its run, &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; grossed $23,686,027 against a budget of $6.5 million.

===Critical response===
Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 81% of critics gave it a positive rating, based on 43 reviews with an average rating of 7.1/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Significantly more mature than the teen raunch comedies that defined the era, &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; is shot with compassion and clear respect for its characters and their hang-ups&quot;. Metacritic gave the film a score of 61 based on 11 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Ringwald&#x27;s performance was especially praised; &quot;Variety&quot; called her &quot;engaging and credible&quot; while Roger Ebert wrote that she &quot;provides a perfect center for the story&quot; in &quot;a sweet and funny movie&quot;.

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;a cuter and better-natured teen comedy than most, with the kinds of occasional lapses in taste that probably can&#x27;t hurt it in the circles for which it is intended. The middle of the film wastes time on a bit more house-wrecking and car-crashing than is absolutely necessary, and there are some notably unfunny ethnic jokes. But most of the movie is cheerful and light, showcasing Mr. Hughes&#x27;s knack for remembering all those aspects of middle-class American adolescent behavior that anyone else might want to forget.&quot;

Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and called it &quot;the best teenage comedy since last year&#x27;s &quot;Risky Business&quot;&quot;, saying it was &quot;certain to draw a lot of laughs, but the guess here is that it also will offer comfort to young girls and boys who feel awkward. And comfort and moments of recognition are in short supply in teenage movies, which often portray a world of violence and sexual mastery that is a lie.&quot;

Pauline Kael wrote in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t amount to much, and it&#x27;s certainly not to be confused with a work of art or a work of any depth, but the young writer-director John Hughes has a knack for making you like the high-school age characters better each time you hear them talk.&quot; Sheila Benson of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stated that &quot;&quot;Vacation&quot; worked, for all its raunchiness. &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot;&#x27; mixture of the sympathetic and the synthetic, the raucous and the racist, doesn&#x27;t. At least not for me ... it flails about, substituting chaos and raunchy language for any semblance of wit.&quot;

Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;Hughes isn&#x27;t vigilant or deft enough to prevent the dramatic focus of attention from shifting at about the halfway point; he can&#x27;t quite finesse the letdown that sets in when the engaging teen-age heroine, Samantha, delightfully embodied by Molly Ringwald, is allowed to become almost a subsidiary character in the second half of the story. Nevertheless, &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; blends an idiosyncratic screwball imagination with a flair for updated domestic comedy and scenes of intimate, quirkily affectionate character interplay.&quot;

&quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; is retrospectively considered to be one of Hughes&#x27; best films.

=== Criticism ===
A 1984 review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticized the character of Long Duk Dong for being &quot;unfunny&quot; and a &quot;potentially offensive stereotype&quot; of Asian people. In 2008, Alison MacAdam of NPR wrote, &quot;To some viewers, he represents one of the most offensive Asian stereotypes Hollywood ever gave America.&quot; Asian Americans have complained that they were taunted with quotes of his stilted-English lines. At the time of the film&#x27;s release, Gedde Watanabe defended the character of Dong as being distinct from &quot;submissive, smart&quot; stereotypes of Asians at the time. Hughes argued that he was parodying foreign exchange students and their American host families in general rather than foreigners or Asians specifically.

In an article published in &quot;Salon&quot;, Amy Benfer considers whether the film directly condones date rape even though no sexual activity is established, consensual or otherwise. After the party scene, Jake tells Ted that his girlfriend Caroline is &quot;in the bedroom right now, passed out cold. I could violate her ten different ways if I wanted to.&quot; He encourages Ted to drive her home saying, &quot;She&#x27;s so blitzed she won&#x27;t know the difference.&quot; When Caroline and Ted wake up next to each other in the car, Caroline says she&#x27;s fairly certain they had sex though neither of them remember it. Benfer writes, &quot;The scene only works because people were stupid about date rape at the time. Even in a randy teen comedy, you would never see two sympathetic male characters conspiring to take advantage of a drunk chick these days.&quot;

Author Anthony C. Bleach has argued that one possibility for Caroline&#x27;s emotional and physical ruin in the film &quot;might be that she is unappreciative of (or unreflective about) her class position&quot;, adding that, &quot;What happens to Caroline in the narrative, whether her sloppy drunkenness, her scalping, or the potential for sexual coercion, seems to be both a projection of Samantha&#x27;s desire to acquire Jake and become his girlfriend and a project of the film&#x27;s desire to somehow harm the upper class.&quot;

===Awards===
In December 1984, Ringwald and Hall both won Young Artist Awards as &quot;Best Young Actress in a Motion Picture&quot; and &quot;Best Young Actor in a Motion Picture&quot; for their roles in the film, respectively becoming the first and only juvenile performers in the history of the Young Artist Awards to win the Best Leading Actress and Best Leading Actor awards for the same film (a distinction the film still retains as of 2014). The movie is ranked number 8 on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s list of &quot;The 50 Best High School Movies&quot;.

==Proposed sequel==
In 2003, USA Network was reportedly developing a sequel to the film produced by Buffy Shutt and Kathy Jones. In 2005, Ringwald was said to be producing a sequel after having turned down previous offers. &quot;I couldn&#x27;t see how it would work. Now, it seems right.&quot;

By 2008, Ringwald was campaigning for the sequel, but said she was uncomfortable doing the film without the involvement of Hughes who, at that point, was not interested. Hughes died in 2009. 

In March 2022, it was announced that Peacock was developing a comedy series titled &quot;15 Candles,&quot; described as a reimagining of the film while focusing on four Latina leads. Selena Gomez, Tanya Saracho, and Gabriela Revilla Lugo are credited as executive producers. The project aims to pay homage to Sixteen Candles while introducing a fresh perspective and storylines.

<text>Harmony is an unincorporated community located in San Luis Obispo County, California. It is home to the former Harmony Valley Creamery, a dairy cooperative that closed in 1955. It lies north of Cayucos and south of Cambria on SR 1, near the junction with SR 46.

==History==
The town of Harmony began as a dairy settlement in the late 19th century started by Swiss immigrants living near the Italian border.

Harmony was founded in 1869 around several dairy ranches and a creamery. The operation changed hands repeatedly because of rivalries that led to a killing. In 1907, owners and ranchers agreed to call off their feud and called the town by its present name as a symbol of their truce.

The Harmony Valley Dairy Co-op was founded in 1901. As the town grew, it soon hosted a dairy management office, dormitories for employees, a livery stable, a blacksmith, and later a gas station. A school was built, and a feed store and post office gave Harmony official status as a community. At its peak, the creamery employed 10 workers, producing high quality dairy products, including butter and cheese that gave Harmony name recognition statewide. The creamery purified butter by cooking it in the traditional Swiss way, clarifying and giving it a golden color—old-world dairymen claimed butter produced by this method never turned rancid. Tourists traveling Hwy 1 often stopped for fresh buttermilk, and famed publishing magnate William Randolph Hearst stopped often in Harmony on his way to his opulent home in San Simeon, 12 miles northwest, as did many of the Hollywood celebrities who were frequent guests of Hearst.

Increased grazing land fees and dairy industry consolidation led to the closure of Harmony&#x27;s creamery around 1955. The town, which still has a part-time post office, lost population until the 1970s when it was rediscovered by California&#x27;s young counter-culture population, many of whom were looking for a rural lifestyle where they could practice traditional crafts away from the pressures and technology of urban life. Many of the town&#x27;s historic landmarks, including the main creamery, were restored and reopened as restaurants and shops.

In 1979 Harmony was featured by KABC in Los Angeles with a live broadcast of the Ken and Bob Company radio show. Ken Minyard and Bob Arthur were the hosts and featured artist Jehry Miller singing his hit song &quot;Harmonizing in Harmony Population 18&quot;. Jehry Miller, along with producer Stephen G. Scott of Los Angeles, also wrote the Ken and Bob Company theme song.

Since the 1970s, Harmony has ridden cycles of prosperity and neglect. It has been home to upscale restaurants, crafts, ceramics and art. More recently, Harmony became a town in name only; a single restaurant remained, but went through several owners before closing in the late 1990s. A small cadre of artisans keeps Harmony alive, with retail shops selling art objects, locally hand blown glass, and pottery, but the town faces an uncertain future. Harmony was recently put up for sale. Helping keep the town alive is Harmony Cellars, a boutique winery and tasting room, about 1/4 mile south. The winery opened in 1989 and in 2006 produced about 6,000 cases of Central Coast varietals such as Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon.

Harmony Headlands State Park contains the native Indian thistle (&quot;Circium brevistylum&quot;), which looks similar to the invasive bull thistle (&quot;Circium vulgare&quot;). &quot;Conyza canadensis&quot; is another native that looks similar to a weed in the same genus.

In 2014, Harmony was purchased by Alan VanderHorst and his family, who plan to restore and preserve the 2.5-acre historic town.

==Layout==

Harmony is one paved street off of SR 1. The main structure is a U-shaped building, the former creamery, with the open area being a small plaza. On the far side of the structure is the Harmony Pottery Shop. On the near side is the former post office and a lounge for visitors.

There was a restaurant, but it closed in 1997. The post office was in operation until April 11, 2008. There is a wedding chapel in the rear, and gardens nearby.

Harmony Glassworks now lies at the north-west end of the street. Founded in 2007 and open daily, the shop is a gallery, studio and school, which offers beginner classes in glassblowing techniques.

== Geography ==

===Climate===
Harmony has a mild, maritime-influenced Mediterranean climate with rainy winters, dry summers, and little seasonal temperature variation.

== Featured in media ==
In episode 3 of the Korean drama &quot;The Heirs&quot; () produced by Seoul Broadcasting System, the main characters played by Lee Min-ho and Park Shin-hye visit the town of Harmony and the winery located there.

In the 4th episode of the HLN Kids Network&#x27;s &quot;Gerbda&quot;, Harmony is mentioned on a list of tourist destinations read by Buster, a character played by Matt Walsh.

Harmony is featured as an artists&#x27; colony in the Perry Mason episode &quot;The Case of the Absent Artist&quot; (season 5, episode 23; 1962), under the name &quot;Port Harmony&quot;.

<text>National Lampoon&#x27;s Loaded Weapon 1 (also known simply as Loaded Weapon 1) is a 1993 American parody film directed and co-written by Gene Quintano, and starring Emilio Estevez, Samuel L. Jackson, Kathy Ireland, Frank McRae, Tim Curry and William Shatner. The film mainly spoofs the first three &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; films, as well as several others including &quot;Basic Instinct, Commando&quot;, &quot;Die Hard&quot;, &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;, &quot;Rambo&quot;, &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot;, &quot;48 Hrs.&quot; and TV series such as &quot;CHiPs&quot;. &quot;Loaded Weapon 1&quot; was released on February 5, 1993.

==Plot==

In Los Angeles, Billie York is murdered by a man known as Mr Jigsaw because she possesses a microfilm containing a recipe that can turn cocaine into cookies. Her former partner, Wes Luger, who is about to retire, is assigned the case by the reluctant captain Doyle, who dismisses it as a suicide but gives Luger the case. The catch is that Luger will have to be partnered with Jack Colt, a burned out cop who recently lost his dog, Claire. The two visit Harold Leacher, who tells them that Colt&#x27;s former general in the Vietnam War, Mortars, is heading the operation. Meanwhile, Jigsaw and Mortars visit Mike McCraken, whom Jigsaw murders for losing the microfilm.

After finding the body, Colt and Luger go to Rick Becker, who claims that he laundered money with York (the money actually being in the laundry machine), but Rick is shot multiple times by unknown assailants, forcing Colt and Luger to go to the Wilderness Girls factory. The head, Destiny Demeanor, claims no knowledge of the operation during questioning, but she is revealed to be working for Mortars and his gang. Colt meets Luger&#x27;s family, but he runs away when they try to seduce him. Destiny and Colt hang out at Colt&#x27;s house, while Mortars sends a helicopter to destroy Colt&#x27;s house (a trailer that is actually a mansion inside), but they accidentally destroy John McClane&#x27;s house.

Due to lack of evidence, Doyle dismisses the case, but Colt still decides to stop the operation, much to the dismay of Luger. Luger is a by-the-book cop, after he took an unscheduled break from his crossing guard duties (as a child), which led to an old lady being run over by a car and killed. Colt breaks in and Destiny, now having fallen in love with Colt, attempts to stop Mortars, but Mortars shows that he was the one who kidnapped Claire, revealing Rick and Claire chained to a wall (Rick actually having survived the incident). Mortars shoots Destiny, who clings to life long enough to confess her feelings for Colt. Colt manages to catch up with Mortars, but then Luger shows up, having considered what Colt said to him earlier. He shoots and kills Mortars, and Colt kills Jigsaw, but starts a fire that destroys the whole factory. Doyle shows up, and asks Luger to stay in the force. Luger agrees, but as long as Colt is his partner. In the end, Destiny, having survived, shows up with Rick and Claire, and the team dances to &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;.

==Cast==
===Cameos===
==Release==
===Box office===
&quot;Loaded Weapon 1&quot; opened at number 1 at the US box office and grossed almost $28 million in the United States and Canada in total. Internationally, it grossed $23.2 million for a worldwide total of $51.2 million. The movie, along with &quot;Excessive Force&quot; and &quot;Three of Hearts&quot;, was cited for its contribution to New Line&#x27;s record pre-sales in 1992 totaling $91.2 million.

===Critical reception===
The film received mostly negative reviews. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a C, comparing it negatively to the Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker films, while also noting that &quot;the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; films, with their hyperbolic explosiveness, lurid repartee, and quasi-loco Mel Gibson hero, are already winking at the audience. (Last year&#x27;s spoofy, ragtag &quot;Lethal Weapon 3&quot; practically turned its own slovenliness into a running gag.) The only way to make light of them is to exaggerate the cartoon funkiness that&#x27;s already at the center of their appeal. It&#x27;s no wonder this Weapon ends up shooting blanks.&quot; Lawrence Cohn of &quot;Variety&quot; opened his review by saying &quot;More an imitation than a parody, this would-be comedy is very short on laughs.&quot; Roger Ebert of &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; said the film&#x27;s main failure was that the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; movies already contained sly spoofs of the police film genre: &quot;The send-up doesn&#x27;t feel much different than the real thing&quot;.

Clifford Terry had a more mixed review of the film; in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; he remarked that &quot;the salt-and-pepper protagonists are no-nonsense, rapid-firing cops down to their very names: Colt and Luger. Obviously, &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Loaded Weapon I&quot; is designed as a sendup of the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; movies, but the benchmarks are really &quot;Police Academy&quot; and &quot;The Naked Gun&quot;. Once again, criminal activity is the game but sophomoric silliness and tastelessness call the shots.&quot;

&quot;Loaded Weapon 1&quot; has a 21% score on the film-critic aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 34 reviews with the consensus: &quot;&quot;Loaded Weapon 1&quot; hits all the routine targets with soft squibs, yielding a tired parody that cycles through its laundry list of references with little comedic verve&quot;.

<text>James Franklin Busby (January 8, 1927 – July 8, 1996) was an American center fielder and coach in Major League Baseball who played with the Chicago White Sox (1950–52, 1955), Washington Senators (1952–55), Cleveland Indians (1956–57), Baltimore Orioles (1957–58, 1960–61), Boston Red Sox (1959–60) and Houston Colt .45&#x27;s (1962).

Busby was born in Kenedy, Texas, and attended Texas Christian University.

He threw and batted right-handed and was listed as tall and .

A cousin, Steve Busby, was a starting pitcher for the Kansas City Royals between 1972–80.

Jim Busby was signed by the White Sox in 1948 and made his major league debut early during the season. He became the regular center fielder for the White Sox in . A fast runner and a good contact hitter, Busby compiled his best offensive seasons early in his career, exceeding the .280 batting mark in 1951, (when he hit a career-best .312) and 1954. He also drove in 80 or more RBI during both 1953—54. But he earned a reputation as a superb defensive outfielder who committed only 42 errors in 3,394 total chances (.988) over his lengthy career. He was an American League All-Star in 1951.

In all or parts of 13 MLB seasons, Busby batted .262, with 48 home runs, 438 runs batted in, 541 runs, 1,113 hits, 162 doubles, 35 triples, and 97 stolen bases in 1,352 games played. Defensively, he recorded a .988 fielding percentage as a center fielder.

When his career ended, in the middle of the season, he became a full-time coach with Houston (through 1967), then spent eight seasons (1968–75) on the staff of the Atlanta Braves, before returning to the American League to finish his coaching career with the White Sox (1976) and Seattle Mariners (1977–78).

As a player and coach, Busby had a 29-year MLB career.

He died in Augusta, Georgia, at 69 years of age.

<text>Frank Wilbur &quot;Spig&quot; Wead (24 October 1895 – 15 November 1947) was a U.S. Navy aviator who helped promote United States Naval aviation from its inception through World War II. Commander Wead was a recognized authority on early aviation. Following a crippling spinal injury in 1926, Wead was placed on the retired list. In the 1930s, he became a screenwriter, becoming involved in more than 30 movies. He also published several books, short stories and magazine articles. During World War II, he returned to active duty. He initially worked in a planning role, but later undertook sea duty in the Pacific, where he saw action against the Japanese in 1943–44 before being placed on the retired list in mid-1945.

==Early life ==
Frank Wilbur Wead was born to Samuel De Forest Wead and Grace (Bestor) Wead on 24 October 1895, in Ward No. 5 of Peoria Township, Peoria, Illinois. Frank graduated from Peoria High School.

The Wead family had a strong background of service to the American nation. The Weads of Massachusetts were represented in one of the Committees of Safety established during the American Revolutionary War, and also as patriots in the Colonial Wars, forming part of the General Society of Colonial Wars during 1607–1763. The Connecticut Weads were also patriots of the American Revolutionary War. The Wead families were prominent in Illinois and Vermont in several fields during the 19th and 20th centuries: politics, law, education and as supporters of the Union during the American Civil War, during which one branch of the Wead lineage became actively involved with the United States Sanitary Commission.

==Military career==

On 16 July 1912, Frank Wilbur Wead (aged 16) was admitted into the United States Naval Academy as a member of the Class of 1916. His classmates included John D. Price, Ralph Davison and Calvin T. Durgin. The Class of 1916 graduated on 29 May 1916.

Following graduation from the Naval Academy and leave, Wead reported to his first sea-duty assignment, , on 28 June 1916. He was a line officer with a date of rank as an ensign of 3 June 1916 and a precedence of 17 within his group of &quot;running mates.&quot;

Wead was next assigned to on a cruise from San Francisco, departing 25 April 1917. The ship reached Rio de Janeiro where, with several other officers, he departed &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; on 21 September. Wead was granted a temporary promotion to Lieutenant on 15 October 1917. He was booked for passage to the Port of New York aboard , which departed Rio de Janeiro on 25 September and arrived in New York on 17 October. Wead reported to the Bureau of Navigation, Navy Department, for sea duty orders.

Wead reported aboard to assist in preparing the vessel for war. USS &quot;Shawmut&quot; departed New York Harbor in June 1918, and for the remaining months of the war operated in the area of the North Sea Mine Barrage. Following the armistice with Germany, Wead returned stateside aboard &quot;Shawmut&quot;, arriving at the Hampton Roads Naval Operations Base (NOB), Norfolk, Virginia, on 27 December 1918.

In February 1919, a kite-balloon division of six balloons was assigned to &quot;Shawmut&quot; and other ships. The ships participated in fleet exercises and, after seven weeks, returned to the United States after demonstrating the capability to operate without land-based support. With the knowledge that the Naval Aviation Division was seeking naval officers with a strong aptitude in naval engineering, having a desire to accept projects with a certain amount of risk, and with the combat-proven ability to lead naval personnel by example, Lieutenant Wead began the process for obtaining endorsements to his application to be nominated for flight training.

===Naval aviation===
Wead received a permanent promotion to Lieutenant (junior grade) on 3 June 1919 (as of 1 January 1920, he remained in the temporary rank of Lieutenant). In the late summer of 1919, Wead requested naval aviation flight training at Aeronautic Station Pensacola, Florida. His request was approved and he was assigned to Class 1 (the first class of regular officers sent to Pensacola after the commencement of World War I), on 15 September 1919. Wead reported to Pensacola and was billeted in a two-man room with Lieutenant (j.g.) Ralph Davison, a classmate at the Naval Academy. Wead was assigned to a training flight team with two other officers and former classmates, Lieutenants (j.g.) Robert Morse Farrar and Calvin Thornton Durgin. In addition to basic and advanced flight and navigation, the students were trained on a catapult installed on a barge at Pensacola. Wead was designated a United States Naval Aviator on 17 April 1920; his wife, Minnie &quot;Min&quot; Wead, pinned his golden wings to his uniform. On Saturday, 5 June 1920, Lieutenant Wead was appointed a naval aviator, along with Lieutenants Felix Stump, Robert Morse Farrar, Homer Webb Clark, Robert Walton Fleming, Stanton Hall Wooster, Ralph E. Davison, John Dale Price, Calin Thornton Durgin, and Henry James White. Wead was promoted to Lieutenant on 1 July 1920.

Wead began to promote Naval Aviation after World War I through air racing, speed competitions and several naval aviation articles he submitted for publishing in the United States Naval Institute &quot;Proceedings&quot; magazine. This competition, mainly against the United States Army Air Service (and its leading racer, Jimmy Doolittle), helped push U.S. military aviation forward. These competitions would give naval aviation a much-needed spotlight in the public eye. The public attention that it generated helped push Congress to fund the advancement of military aviation. After World War I he was a test pilot for the Navy.

====Sea duty====
On 21 April 1921, a newly promoted Lieutenant Frank Wead reported aboard , homeported at Naval Air Station North Island, San Diego, California. Aboard &quot;Aroostook&quot;, Wead was assigned aviation duties involving flying: Aeromarine 39-B (two-seater seaplane used as a &quot;scout plane&quot;) and Felixstowe F5L (flying boat that carried a crew of four); reporting to Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet Air Squadrons Captain Henry Varnum Butler, USN, and Executive Aide Lieutenant Commander Patrick N. L. Bellinger, USN.

Many changes were occurring within the naval aviation community. In the summer of 1921, Lieutenant Wead took part in the round-trip, long distance flight operation involving twelve F-5-L flying boats departing from NAS North Island to the Coco Solo Canal Zone and back. Additionally, Wead took part in tests involving dummy torpedoes dropped from F-5-L aircraft. Also, in accordance with an Act of Congress, United States Secretary of the Navy Edwin Denby issued orders for the establishment of a Bureau of Aeronautics to begin operations, 1 September 1921, with newly promoted Rear Admiral William A. Moffett in charge. It was President Warren G. Harding who selected then Captain Moffett for nomination as the new Chief, Bureau of Aeronautics.

The experience gained aboard USS &quot;Aroostook&quot; involving F-5-L flying boats was instrumental in Wead being selected as commanding officer of Combat Squadron No. 3 (re-designated, &quot;Fighting Plane Squadron 3&quot;, on 17 June 1922), U.S. Pacific Fleet; he served in this capacity for over a year until the spring of 1923.

====Naval aviation publicity and development====
During the period of 1921–23, there was a great interest among state governors and congressional leaders to send Government aeroplanes to all parts of the country to participate in patriotic celebrations, municipal and state functions, conventions, air meets, including international air races. In an era of aeronautic cooperation and coordination with the taxpayers, the two services (United States Army Air Service headed by Major General Mason Patrick and the Bureau of Aeronautics headed by Rear Admiral Moffett) wholeheartedly approved at the 14th Annual Banquet of the Aero Club of America to compete for the Pulitzer Trophy (National Air Races), Mackay Army Trophy (Mackay Trophy), Collier Trophy, Wright Trophy, Larsen Efficiency Trophy, Curtiss Marine Trophy, Detroit Aviation Country Club Trophy, Liberty Engine Builders Trophy, Detroit News Aerial Mail Trophy, Inter-service Championship Meet, including the two foreign races – the Coupe Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe and the Coupe Jacques Schneider for seaplanes and flying boats.

In the spring of 1923, Wead was detached from the aircraft squadron battle fleet and reported to NAS Anacostia, Washington D.C., for assignment to the Flight Division of the Bureau of Aeronautics. Lieutenant Wead worked closely with the Philadelphia Naval Aircraft Factory and three contractors (Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company, Wright Aeronautical, Glenn L. Martin Company) in the development of seaplane airframes and new engines, and testing the seaplanes in duration flights above the Potomac River. Based upon his experience and technical expertise, Wead submitted several articles for publication that pertained to known issues concerning aircraft design, power plant problems, and future naval aviation.

====Seaplane racing and records broken====
Lieutenant Frank Wead traveled to East Cowes, Isle of Wight, Great Britain, as the American team captain of a small group of U.S. naval aviators. He was also the reserve team member. With Lieutenant Wead were four naval aviators who departed New York Harbor aboard S.S. Leviathan. They were to participate in the Seventh Schneider Trophy Contest (28 September 1923). Unfortunately, on the day of the navigability tests (27 September 1923), Wead had to withdraw because of an engine problem with his TR-3A aircraft- the American reserve seaplane. The TR-3A was a double pontoon seaplane with a Wright E-4 engine of 300 H.P. However, his teammates, Lieutenants David Rittenhouse and Rutledge Irvine, flying their CR-3s finished first and second places, respectively, on 28 September 1923. Their CR-3s were earlier tested at Garden City, Port Washington, Long Island. They were an improved adaptation of the Curtiss Navy Racer- the standard racing design which led the world in performance since the first plane of this type won the Pulitzer Race in 1921. 

During the period 22–23 June 1924 just off-shore of NAS Anacostia, Wead and Lieutenant John Dale Price, using a Curtiss CS-2 with a Wright T-3 Tornado engine, set new Class C seaplane records for distance (963.123 miles), duration (13 hours 23 minutes 15 seconds), and three speed records (73.41 mph for 500 kilometers, 74.27 mph for 1000 km, and 74.17 mph for 1500 km). Lieutenants Wead and Price set a newer record 11–12 July 1924, with new Class C seaplane records for distance (994.19 miles) and duration (14 hours 53 min 44 sec) using a CS-2 with a Wright Tornado engine.

====San Francisco to Hawaii flight====
Following his assignment at NAS Anacostia, Wead was assigned staff duty involving flying at NAS North Island where he served as Flag Lieutenant to the flight project commander at NAS North Island, Captain Stanford Elwood Moses, USN. On 28 October 1924, Wead was assigned to command VT Squadron 2. During 1924 and 1925, Wead was involved with the planning for the San Francisco to Hawaii endurance and navigation tests to comprise two Naval Aircraft Factory PN-9 flying boats, and one Boeing PB-1 flying boat.

In early April 1926, Wead received a naval message at his headquarters, NAS North Island, that he was selected for promotion to lieutenant commander; promoted ahead of his fellow naval aviators Class of 1916; and, one of the Navy&#x27;s youngest squadron commanders.

In his book &quot;All the Factors of Victory: Admiral Joseph Mason Reeves and The Origins of Carrier Airpower&quot; (May 2003), Thomas Wildenberg provided an insight into the naval aviation tactical issues with which Reeves was involved and the part Wead played as commanding officer of VF-2 fighter squadron (comprising Vought VE-7SF &quot;Bluebird&quot;, Boeing Model 15 naval variant FB-5, Curtiss Model 34D F6C-2 &quot;Hawk&quot;). Wead was preparing his squadron for the June 1926 tactical exercises aboard up to his accident on 14 April 1926. Wildenberg identified Wead&#x27;s replacement as Lieutenant Commander Frank Dechant Wagner, USN. Assigned to Commander, Air Squadrons, Battle Fleet, Lieutenant Commander Wagner would further improve upon the training tactics devised by Wead, including developing new dive-bombing techniques with the Battle Fleet&#x27;s Curtiss F6C Hawks and FB-5s.

===Medical retirement===
On 14 April 1926, Wead heard his daughter Marjorie crying. Rushing to her, he accidentally tripped, falling head first down a dark stairway, and fractured his neck. The injury resulted in paralysis. Wead was immediately taken to the U.S. Naval Hospital, Balboa Park (today&#x27;s Naval Medical Center San Diego) where the Commandant of the U.S. Naval Hospital, Captain Raymond Spear, Medical Corps, was briefed on Wead&#x27;s condition and ordered him to be operated on.

According to an article written by a &quot;San Diego Union&quot; staff writer:

On 16 July 1926, while convalescing in the hospital, Wead was promoted to lieutenant commander. At the encouragement of his fellow naval officers, he put his writing skills to work and started sending manuscripts to book and magazine companies. During spring 1927, in the hope that his recovery was imminent and with the strong recommendation from Commander Marc Mitscher, Rear Admiral Moffett submitted Wead&#x27;s name to Rear Admiral Richard H. Leigh, Commander, Bureau of Naval Personnel, recommending Wead to be the new squadron commander of VF-6B (previously, VF-2) with duty aboard USS &quot;Langley&quot;. However, Wead was placed on the retired list, 28 May 1928, with a residence in the City of Los Angeles, California. He began his second career, screenplay writing, which subsequently occupied him throughout the 1930s and early 1940s.

===World War II service===
In the hours immediately following the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, from his personal library within his rented estate at 715 North Rexford Drive, Beverly Hills, California, Wead listened as bulletins interrupted regularly scheduled radio programs with updated details of the bombing. From his library, Wead also made a long-distance phone call to the Bureau of Aeronautics to speak with Rear Admiral John Henry Towers, requesting a recall to active duty. The phone call was followed up with a Western Union telegram to Captain Ralph Davison, USN.

It was a chance to serve his country, again. Wead flew from California and arrived at Naval Air Station Quonset Point where he worked as special aide to Captain Ralph Davison. Also, at NAS Quonset Point was Rear Admiral Calvin T. Durgin and his naval aide Captain John Madison &quot;Johnny&quot; Hoskins, USN. All these naval aviators communicated closely together in working out the details for the manning and training of &quot;carrier air groups&quot; for the newly commissioned aircraft carriers. With the approval from Ralph Davison, Wead was promoted to the temporary rank of commander in the US Naval Reserve, on 28 September 1942.

The story of Wead&#x27;s sea-duty during World War II began in the air, flying from Port of San Francisco and landing at Honolulu Harbor aboard NC18605 Boeing 314 Clipper &quot;Dixie Clipper&quot;, arriving at Oahu Island on 21 November 1943. From the Port of Honolulu Wead reported to Commander in Chief Pacific Fleet Headquarters as head of the Plans Division for Commander, Air Force, Pacific Fleet, (now) Vice Admiral John Henry Towers. This shore-duty assignment was to await the return of . On the afternoon of 9 December 1943, Wead reported aboard &quot;Yorktown&quot; where he met with his old Naval Academy buddy Captain Joseph J. Clark, USN, skipper of &quot;Yorktown&quot;. Representing the Plans Division, Wead&#x27;s orders aboard &quot;Yorktown&quot; were to monitor and report on carrier aviation combat operations, most especially obtaining first-hand knowledge in the ability of consolidated CVs in a task force to readily replace their lost/damaged aircraft with replacements from close-by CVLs.

Having completed an earlier successful operation, &quot;Yorktown&quot; (assigned to Task Group 58.1, commanded by Rear Admiral John W. Reeves, Jr., USN) departed Pearl Harbor with Wead aboard on 16 January 1944. Wead took part in the attack on Kwajalein Atoll during Operation Flintlock, an operation that involved four carrier groups. USS &quot;Yorktown&quot; then steamed to the newly established Pacific Fleet anchorage at Majuro Atoll, arriving about 4 February 1944. It was during this short eight-day anchorage period amongst the Pacific Fleet that Wead was transferred from &quot;Yorktown&quot; to a destroyer, and then to . The commanding officer of &quot;Essex&quot; was Captain Ralph A. Ofstie, USN. While aboard &quot;Essex&quot;, Wead saw action against Truk Island (17–18 February), now called Chuuk, and against Saipan, Tinian, and Guam (23 February).

After these operations, &quot;Essex&quot; received orders for overhaul and Wead remained aboard &quot;Essex&quot; as it steamed to San Francisco Bay. The carrier arrived at Naval Air Station Alameda on or about 16 April 1944 for a much-needed overhaul. It was at NAS Alameda, aboard &quot;Essex&quot; (pier-side), that Wead was given an official send-off from active duty just prior to his retirement. Wead was relieved of active duty on 21 July 1944, and was processed through the Personnel Department at NAS Alameda receiving his discharge papers and a train ticket for Los Angeles, California. Wead was placed on the retired list on 11 May 1945 with the rank of commander.

==Death ==
On 1 November 1947, Wead was taken for surgery at the Santa Monica Hospital, which was located at 1250 16th Street in Santa Monica, Los Angeles County, California. He died at the hospital on 15 November. 
Wead was buried in the family plot at Springdale Cemetery and Mausoleum (plot: Bluff Division, Section 4, Lot 00140), Peoria, Peoria County, Illinois.

==Legacy==
Admiral Calvin T. Durgin later described Wead as &quot;a great man who did a remarkable job under very difficult circumstances.&quot;

In 1957, John Wayne portrayed Wead in the John Ford directed film &quot;The Wings of Eagles.&quot;

===Screen writing===
Frank A. Andrews&#x27;s book &quot;Dirigible&quot; (New York: A. L. Burt Co. 1931), is based on the Columbia Pictures screenplay by Wead. Wead&#x27;s publishers released another book in 1931. This was &quot;Wings For Men&quot;. Writing would become a second and even more important career for Wead, and a means of promoting naval aviation.

The injury to his neck left Wead with an ability to endure hours of pain sitting upright in a chair typing away on manuscripts for possible publication. Known to outsiders as being &quot;belligerent, brave, eccentric visionary; a man of fanatical dedication...doomed to be alone&quot;, his love for his daughters and their well-being could not be matched. He sent his daughter Dorothea to attend the prestigious Smith College; she graduated with the Class of 1939. Thus, this Naval Academy grad and record-breaking naval pilot was able to succeed as a screenplay writer and to earn a comfortable income to support his daughters in their life-style and college education.

Wead&#x27;s second unexpected career became far more important than his work as a pilot. His talent for writing grew during the years as a naval officer involved with the daily administrative papers, submitting detailed reports, completing flight schedules. One of his interests was reading stories and poetry written by Robert Louis Stevenson. Wead would later use the &quot;Requiem&quot; inscribed on Stevenson&#x27;s tomb as script material for several screenplays, such as &quot;They Were Expendable&quot;, and screenplay writers Frank Fenton and William Wister Haines used the poem in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film &quot;The Wings of Eagles&quot;.

The popularity of his pulp and magazine stories led Wead to Hollywood and the eventual friendship and collaboration with director John Ford.

<text>Major League is a 1989 American sports comedy film produced by Chris Chesser and Irby Smith, written and directed by David S. Ward, that stars Tom Berenger, Charlie Sheen, Wesley Snipes, James Gammon, Bob Uecker, Rene Russo, Margaret Whitton, Dennis Haysbert, and Corbin Bernsen.

Telling the story of a single regular season of a fictionalized version of the Cleveland Indians Major League Baseball team, &quot;Major League&quot; grossed $75 million worldwide from an $11 million budget and spawned two sequels (&quot;Major League II&quot; and &quot;Major League: Back to the Minors&quot;), neither of which repeated the success of the original film.

==Plot==
Former Las Vegas showgirl Rachel Phelps inherits the struggling Cleveland Indians baseball team from her deceased husband. She intends to move the team to Miami by exploiting an escape clause in their contract with the city of Cleveland: if their season attendance falls below a certain number, she can terminate the lease and move the team. She plans to create the worst team in the major leagues, instructing team executives to fire the current players and replace them with rookies and veterans long past their prime. She starts by hiring Lou Brown, 30-year manager of the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens, who runs a tire store in the off season.

Spring training begins in Tucson, Arizona, with Phelps&#x27; list of players likely to fail: Jake Taylor, a former all-star catcher with bad knees; third baseman Roger Dorn, a prima donna more concerned with his financial portfolio than playing good baseball; aging starting pitcher Eddie Harris, who has resorted to doctoring the baseball; outfielder Pedro Cerrano, a voodoo-practicing power slugger who has trouble hitting breaking balls; speedy outfielder Willie Mays Hayes, who can steal bases but cannot hit; and rookie pitcher Ricky Vaughn, an ex-con who has a 100-mph fastball but no control, earning him the nickname &quot;Wild Thing.&quot;

Early on, the players struggle to come together as a team, with a feud developing between Dorn and Vaughn, but they win some games under Brown and Taylor&#x27;s leadership. They discover that Vaughn has poor eyesight, and once fitted with glasses, he becomes a dominant pitcher. Team morale and performance improve, so Phelps cancels several amenities, but they continue to build on their strengths. Meanwhile, Taylor reconnects with his old girlfriend Lynn and tries to rekindle their relationship, even though she is engaged to be married.

Nearly three-quarters of the way through the season, the team is 60–61, exceeding expectations, and fans have begun to fill the stands. At this point, Phelps&#x27;s general manager, Charlie Donovan, tired of her manipulations, reveals her scheme to Brown, who then relays the message to his team. To thwart Phelps&#x27; plan, Taylor decides that the only thing left to do is &quot;win the whole fuckin&#x27; thing.&quot;

The Indians climb in the standings until they are tied with the New York Yankees for first place in the American League East division on the final day of the season, requiring a one-game playoff to determine the division champion and a bid to the ALCS. Watching the team&#x27;s celebration on television, Dorn&#x27;s wife Suzanne sees him in an amorous embrace with another woman. In revenge, she sleeps with Vaughn (who is unaware of who she is) and informs Dorn just before he leaves for the ballpark the next morning. 
The Indians manage to keep pace with the Yankees, and Cerrano is able to hit a curveball for a home run. The game enters the ninth tied at 2, but a fatigued Harris loads the bases with two outs for star hitter Clu Heywood. Brown brings in Vaughn to face him despite his struggles against him all year; Vaughn, after a bit of encouragement from Dorn, strikes out Heywood on three fastballs.

With two out in the Indians ninth, Hayes beats out a ground ball to keep the inning alive, causing the Yankees to bring in their head hunting closer, Duke Simpson, to face Taylor. After Hayes steals second, Taylor has an idea and relays it to the dugout. Taylor points to left field, ostensibly calling his shot, but Duke responds by throwing at Taylor&#x27;s head.

Once again, Taylor points at the stands. Hayes again takes off, and at the last possible second Taylor catches everyone off guard with a bunt, which he beats out by a step. Heywood spots Hayes, who never stopped running, breaking for home and throws to the plate, but Hayes slides around the tag and scores. The Indians win the game, 3–2, and advance to the postseason.

In the ensuing celebration, Dorn punches Vaughn for sleeping with his wife, but pulls him up and they celebrate. Jake spots Lynn in the stands, and she holds up her hand to reveal her engagement has been called off.

===Alternate ending===
The theatrical release shows Phelps in the owner&#x27;s box in the final game showing dismay with the team&#x27;s success, and this is the last time she is seen. An alternate final scene included on the &quot;Wild Thing Edition&quot; DVD shows a different characterization: Brown confronts Phelps over her plan to sabotage the team and resigns. Phelps reveals that she loves the team and invented plans to move to Miami as a ruse to motivate the players. Brown does not resign, and Phelps says that if he shares their conversation with anyone, she will fire him.

The film&#x27;s producers said that while the twist ending worked as a resolution of the plot, they scrapped it because test screening audiences preferred Phelps as a villain.

==Cast==

* Tom Berenger as Jake Taylor, a veteran catcher with bad knees. Taylor is playing in the Mexican League when the Indians call, and sees the season as his last chance to be successful. He takes rookies Hayes and Vaughn under his wing.
* Charlie Sheen as Ricky &quot;Wild Thing&quot; Vaughn, a cocky young pitcher recruited out of prison. He has a powerful fastball but lacks control. 
* Corbin Bernsen as third baseman Roger Dorn. Dorn is nearing retirement and fears being injured, believing he has a future in acting, and so initially plays with little effort (despite believing himself to be a star player).
* Margaret Whitton as Rachel Phelps, a former showgirl who inherits the team from her billionaire husband just before the film begins. She hates Cleveland and schemes to move the team to Miami. 
* James Gammon as Lou Brown, manager. Brown managed the Toledo Mud Hens for thirty years before taking over the Indians.
* Rene Russo as Lynn Weslin, Jake Taylor&#x27;s ex-girlfriend, a former Olympic athlete-turned librarian. They broke up when he left to play in Mexico, but now he wants to rekindle their romance despite her engagement to someone else. 
* Bob Uecker as Harry Doyle, the sardonic radio sports commentator for the Indians.
* Wesley Snipes as center fielder Willie Mays Hayes. He arrives at spring training uninvited, but earns his spot on the team with his impressive speed, despite being a terrible batter.
* Charles Cyphers as Charlie Donovan, the general manager. Rachel Phelps orders him to carry out her plan of tanking the season over his objections; eventually, he reveals her scheme to the team.
* Chelcie Ross as Eddie Harris, a veteran pitcher who doctors the baseball to make up for his diminishing power.
* Dennis Haysbert as Pedro Cerrano, outfielder. He defected from Cuba seeking the freedom to practice his religion of voodoo.
* Andy Romano as first base coach Pepper Leach.
* Steve Yeager as third base coach Duke Temple.
* Pete Vuckovich as Haywood, Yankees&#x27; first baseman. He has previously won the Triple Crown and has a reputation for being mean.
* Willie Mueller as Duke Simpson, the Yankees&#x27; relief pitcher, a skilled reliever with a reputation for hitting batters on purpose.
* Stacy Carroll as Suzanne Dorn, Roger Dorn&#x27;s wife, who is loving and supportive until she sees her husband on TV cavorting with another woman. 
* Keith Uchima and Kurt Uchima as Groundskeepers who routinely deride the team but who eventually come around.
* Neil Flynn appears as a longshoreman who is initially dismissive of the new team but soon realizes their potential.
==Production==
===Development===
Ward, who grew up in the Cleveland suburb of South Euclid, Ohio, reflected on filming a movie about a Cleveland team that had not won a pennant since his childhood. “I figured I would never see the Indians win anything unless I wrote a movie where they did. That was the real genesis behind the movie.&quot;

The film&#x27;s opening montage is a series of somber blue-collar images of the Cleveland landscape synchronized to the score of Randy Newman&#x27;s &quot;Burn On&quot;, an ode to the infamous day in Cleveland when the heavily polluted Cuyahoga River caught fire in 1969.

Much of the film&#x27;s spring training scenes were shot at Hi Corbett Field in Tucson, Arizona, which was the spring training home for the Cleveland Indians from 1947 to 1992. The production used members of the University of Arizona Wildcats baseball team as extras.

Despite being set in Cleveland, the film was principally shot in Milwaukee because it was cheaper (Ward noted that Cleveland was a big union town) and the producers were unable to work around the schedules of the Cleveland Indians and Cleveland Browns. Milwaukee County Stadium, then the home of the Brewers (and three Green Bay Packers games per season), doubles as Cleveland Stadium for the film, although several exterior shots of Cleveland Stadium were used, including some aerial shots taken during an Indians game. In fact, the sign for the television station atop the scoreboard is for WTMJ-TV, the NBC affiliate for Milwaukee. One of the ending scenes of the movie is in West Milwaukee&#x27;s legendary restaurant, 4th Base which showcases their unique horseshoe bar that is shown in the celebration scenes. Another restaurant scene, at the then Gritz&#x27;s Pzazz on Milwaukee&#x27;s north side, was filmed at a restaurant that is no longer open for business. County Stadium was demolished in 2001; the stadium&#x27;s former playing field is now a Little League baseball field known as Helfaer Field, while the rest of the former site is now a parking lot for the Brewers&#x27; current home, American Family Field, which opened in 2001.

Originally in Ward&#x27;s script, there was a twist involving Whitton&#x27;s character being revealed to have wanted the team to have won all along, having personally scouted each member of the team with flaws that hid their talent. The film was shot with that ending in mind, complete with reaction shots for the final game depicted of her cheering the team on. However, this was changed due to audience test scores that apparently had grown to like seeing Whitton&#x27;s character in its villainous form. As such, a small bit of re-shots and editing was done for the climax. The ending (with an introduction by the filmmakers) is included on the DVD for the film.

===Casting===
The film was notable for featuring several actors who would go on to stardom: Snipes and Russo were relative unknowns before the movie was released, while Haysbert remained best known as Pedro Cerrano until he portrayed U.S. President David Palmer on the television series &quot;24&quot; and the spokesperson for Allstate Insurance. The longshoreman who is occasionally seen commenting and is shown in the final celebration inside a bar is Neil Flynn, who later achieved fame playing the Janitor in &quot;Scrubs&quot; and then the father Mike in &quot;The Middle&quot;. This is Flynn&#x27;s first credited movie role.

The film also featured former Major League players, including 1982 American League Cy Young Award winner Pete Vuckovich as Yankees&#x27; first baseman Clu Haywood, former Milwaukee Brewers pitcher Willie Mueller as the Yankees pitcher Duke Simpson, known as &quot;The Duke&quot;, and former Los Angeles Dodgers catcher Steve Yeager as third-base coach Duke Temple. Former catcher and longtime Brewers broadcaster Bob Uecker played the Indians&#x27; broadcaster, Harry Doyle. The names of several crewmembers were also used for peripheral players.

Sheen himself was a pitcher on his high school&#x27;s baseball team. At the time of filming &quot;Major League&quot;, his own fastball topped out at 88 miles per hour. In 2011, Sheen said that he had used steroids for nearly two months to improve his athletic abilities in the film.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film debuted at number 1 at the US box office and received generally positive reviews. It grossed almost $50 million in the United States and Canada and $25 million internationally for a worldwide total of $75 million.

===Critical response===
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes &quot;Major League&quot; holds an approval rating of 83% based on 40 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The site&#x27;s critics&#x27; consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Major League&quot; may be predictable and formulaic, but [is] buoyed by the script&#x27;s light, silly humor—not to mention the well-built sports action sequences and funny performances.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 62 out of 100 based on 15 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

==Year-end lists==
The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2008: AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10:
** Nominated Sports Film

==In popular culture==
Rachel Phelps&#x27; character is loosely based on that of Georgia Frontiere, a past owner of the Los Angeles / St. Louis Rams, in the way she took over the franchise and how she was initially perceived. She took over ownership and control of the Rams upon the death of her husband in 1979, and eventually moved the team to her hometown of St. Louis, Missouri in 1995. The Rams (at the time owned by Stan Kroenke, who bought them from Frontiere&#x27;s family after her own death) returned to Los Angeles in 2016.

The character of veteran junk ball pitcher Eddie Harris is based on that of Gaylord Perry and his affinity for throwing baseballs doctored with vaseline, spit, or any other substance known to illegally change the movement of a pitch.

When he joined the Cubs in 1989 (the same year the film was released), pitcher Mitch Williams&#x27; extravagant wind-up and release, and his frequent wild pitches, earned him the nickname &quot;Wild Thing&quot;. As with Rick Vaughn&#x27;s character, the Wrigley Field organist played &quot;Wild Thing&quot; as Williams came out of the bullpen; this was changed to the rock recording from the film after he was traded to the Phillies. A few years later, in 1993 with the Phillies, Williams, who had up to that point in his career, worn the number 28, started wearing the number 99 on his jersey, the same number that Vaughn wears in the film.

In the years since its release &quot;Major League&quot; has become a beloved film of many professional baseball players and announcers, and is often referenced during game broadcasts. For example, in 2014, for the film&#x27;s 25th anniversary, Major League catcher David Ross filmed a one-man tribute to the film, with Ross playing the part (among others) of Lou Brown, Pedro Cerrano, Willie Mays Hayes, Rick Vaughn, and Roger Dorn. Additionally, as part of their 2014 &quot;Archives&quot; set, the trading card company Topps celebrated the film&#x27;s 25th anniversary by creating baseball cards (using the same design as the company&#x27;s 1989 base set) of Roger Dorn, Jake Taylor, Eddie Harris, Rachel Phelps, Rick Vaughn, and &quot;Jobu&quot;. Harry Doyle&#x27;s call of a wildly off-target Rick Vaughn pitch that was &quot;JUST a bit outside&quot; is so well-known, film critic Richard Roeper wrote in 2019 that the line was invoked by every sportscaster in the last 30 years. In 2011, Bleacher Report&#x27;s Timothy Rapp named &quot;JUST a bit outside&quot; his fifth greatest sports-movie quote ever.

In 2017, the University of Arizona men&#x27;s baseball team created a parody of Major League, which was filmed at UA&#x27;s current home field, Hi Corbett Field in Tucson, Arizona. Hi Corbett was the spring training home for the Cleveland Indians from 1947 to 1992. The star of the short film is outfielder Matt &quot;Mays&quot; Frazier, who played the role of Snipes&#x27; Willie Mays Hayes character from the original film. Rick &quot;Wild Thing&quot; Vaughn and Roger Dorn are also parodied, and Arizona head coach Jay Johnson plays the role of Indians manager Lou Brown.

&quot;Major League&quot; became an inspiration for the real Cleveland Indians and the city, given the previously long-standing Cleveland sports curse that had left Cleveland without any sporting championships in between 1964 (when the NFL&#x27;s Cleveland Browns won the NFL Championship) and 2016 (when the NBA&#x27;s Cleveland Cavaliers won the NBA Finals and secured their first title in their 46-year history). The Indians reached the 2016 World Series, but lost to the similarly cursed Cubs. Between 1995 and 2016, the team went to the World Series three times, losing each time.

The Indians changed their name to the Guardians for the 2022 season. The opening scene of the film is an image of one of the &quot;Guardians of Traffic&quot; on the Hope Memorial Bridge.

===Video game===
&quot;Major League&quot; was made into and released as a sports video game, developed by Lenar and published by Irem, exclusively for the Family Computer in Japan in 1989.

===Jobu===
Soon after the film&#x27;s 25th anniversary in 2015, a company called &quot;The Jobu Lifestyle&quot; began producing figurines of Jobu (Pedro Cerrano&#x27;s voodoo figure). The packaging is a reference to Cerrano&#x27;s locker that made up Jobu&#x27;s shrine.

In news coverage of the 2017 World Baseball Classic, Team Israel&#x27;s outfielder Cody Decker made a comparison between Jobu and the team&#x27;s mascot, &quot;Mensch on a Bench&quot;, a five-foot-tall stuffed toy that looks a bit like a rabbi or Hasidic Jew: &quot;He&#x27;s a mascot, he&#x27;s a friend, he&#x27;s a teammate, he&#x27;s a borderline deity to our team... He brings a lot to the table... Every team needs their Jobu. He was ours. He had his own locker, and we even gave him offerings: Manischewitz, gelt, and gefilte fish... He is everywhere and nowhere all at once. His actual location is irrelevant because he exists in higher metaphysical planes. But he&#x27;s always near.&quot;

===Sequels===

Due to the success of the film, two sequels have been produced, neither of which achieved the original&#x27;s success. &quot;Major League II&quot; returned most of the original stars, with the notable exception of Wesley Snipes, and focused on the following season and the players&#x27; reaction to the previous season&#x27;s success. &quot;Major League: Back to the Minors&quot; again starred Corbin Bernsen, but this time, as the owner of the Minnesota Twins, attempting to turn around the Twins&#x27; AAA team, the Buzz. A possible third sequel, &quot;Major League 3&quot; (which was to ignore &quot;Back to the Minors&quot;), was reported in 2010 to be in development by original writer and producer David S. Ward. Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger, and Snipes were reported to return, with the plot revolving around Ricky Vaughn coming out of retirement to work with a young player. In 2015, Morgan Creek Productions said that the sequel was still in the works.

===Reboot===
In 2017, Morgan Creek announced plans to reboot their classic films from the 1980s and 1990s as television series or movies following the success of &quot;The Exorcist&quot; television series. Several films in early stages of development include film series &quot;Young Guns&quot;, &quot;Major League&quot;, and &quot;Ace Ventura&quot;.

<doc id="685988" wikidata="Q490480" url="?curid=685988" title="Game Park">
<text>Game Park was a South Korean company that was founded in 1996 and went bankrupt in March 2007. It is responsible for creating the GP32 and the never-released XGP. GamePark Holdings was founded by former employees of Game Park in 2005.

==Foundation==
Founded in 1996 in South Korea, Game Park entered the industry using government money. At the time, games in Korea were only made for PCs and Arcade. There was a law established after World War II that forbid importation of Japanese electronics. Some clones of Japanese consoles such as the Sega Saturn (cloned by Samsung) and Nintendo 64 (cloned by Hyundai) were holders of minor market shares. In a place where most games ran on the PC, a small place resided for video game consoles. To make changes, the South Korean government decided to fund a company that would create a console to compete against the monopolized Japanese market. A contest was held and Game Park was the winning company. Game Park was set to create the first portable video game system from Korea.

The GP32 (Game Park 32-bit), their first system, was then being designed. Several iterations of it were developed, including a metallic look, and a style issued from the original Game Boy design, and a flat panel with a screen on the upper part and buttons on the lower part. Those systems were shown at the 2000 Tokyo Game Show but failed to catch attention with their inferior hardware and games. After five years of development, Game Park opted for a more plastic look, a lot like the Game Boy Advance. Game Park&#x27;s new handheld also had a major internal hardware upgrade making it more powerful than the GBA.

==Launch==
The GP32 originally launched in November 2001, in Korea exclusively. Game Park had opted for a narrow-area market approach so they could better handle the production costs. The result was small success in Korea.

Game Park did make an error: paying a large amount of money to port PlayStation games to their consoles. The porting was handled by Korean developers which had never seen a PlayStation before because of its interdiction in Korea. It was very difficult for them to import games and it ended up that only one ported game was made, Princess Maker 2, a simulation so complicated it was never translated. One had to speak Japanese to play it well.

Initially, the GP32 launched with a 3.5 inch screen, 2 buttons, 2 shoulder buttons, 2 function buttons and 2 integrated speakers for stereo sound. It is almost physically the same as the GBA except for a bigger screen, higher-quality speakers and more ergonomic handling.

==Surprising market==
Though the GP32 was planned to be a gaming console, its game selection was not sufficient in quality or quantity to truly compete against the Game Boy Advance. One of its advantage was that in Korea no Japanese electronics were allowed, the Game Boy Advance included. On January 1, 2002, however, Korea finally allowed imports of Japanese electronics. The system&#x27;s success hinged on being an open source handheld attractive to independent developers and capable of supporting video and audio playback.

==GP32 Variants==

===GP32 FLU===

The GP32 FLU, (Front Lit Unit) is a GP32 which has been modified to include a front light, much like the Game Boy Advance SP. The big difference, however, is that the GP32 FLU has exactly the same mold, buttons, etc. as the GP32, unlike the completely redesigned Game Boy Advance SP. This reduced the cost of the modification. This system was released in Korea exclusively again, in 2002.

The front light can be switched off to save battery power.

===GP32 BLU===
The GP32 BLU (standing for Back Lit Unit) was another iteration of the GP32 (the equivalent of the brighter GBA SP), again having nothing changed in appearance, except for a now back lit screen, much better than the FLU. The BLU gave players a very bright and colorful screen. This unit was introduced in 2004, and later that year they even released it in Italy, France, United Kingdom, and Spain.

A problem is that without the back light the screen looks very dark and it&#x27;s hard to see the image, so the backlight must run continuously except when it&#x27;s not necessary to look at the screen (for example, when using the console as an MP3 player).

==Imports==
The system has been subject to much importation, due largely to the fact the operating system on it features both Korean and English support, even though it was exclusively sold in Korea for many years.

==Competition==
In 2003, the Game Park line still was not released in Europe or North America.

Team17, the developer of Worms, offered to port their games directly on the GP32 for free. Although most companies demanded financial support, Team17 only asked for two GP32 units to test their games. Game Park refused, for currently unknown reasons.

In July 2003, GP32News, a French news web site for the GP32 took a personal initiative to show and publicize the GP32 at the Japan Expo in France. Game Park refused to fund the site, which would have helped give the GP32 a publicity boost.

At the Game Convention event in Germany in August, the GP32 was announced with a European launch for Holiday 2003. Numerous distributors, to sell the system, as well as the first editors of European games to start development were contacted.

The company in charge of distributing the GP32, Mitsui (a well-known company in Japan) abandoned Game Park for a bigger company, Sony. Mitsui then was in charge of distributing the Sony PSP in Europe, after having no communication from Game Park.

==Today==

The GP32 knew a small success in Europe. North America never saw the GP32. The GP32 was sold in the Americas through web stores but has become increasingly rare.

In early 2005, there was an internal disagreement in Game Park about where to take the company. Some former employees split off to form GamePark Holdings, which successfully released the GP2X handheld console in November 2005 and released the GP2X Wiz in April 2009.

In 2006, the original Game Park officially announced the XGP, the successor to their GP32. They also announced the XGP-Mini, a smaller version of the XGP with half the RAM. Later on, they announced the XGP-Kids, a redesign of the GP32, featuring the same hardware at a lower price for younger players.

None of these consoles were actually released, and in March 2007 Game Park filed for bankruptcy. Gamepark&#x27;s official website is currently unavailable and was previously replaced by a website for a shoe store before it was taken down

<doc id="685990" wikidata="Q38110" url="?curid=685990" title="Lakeland Terrier">
<text>The Lakeland Terrier is a dog breed, which takes its name from its place of origin, the Lake District in England. The dog is a small to mid-size member of the Terrier family. While independent in personality, it interacts well with owners and all family members. In the United Kingdom, the Lakeland Terrier is considered a vulnerable dog breed at risk of going extinct through low levels of breeding, according to The Kennel Club. In the United States, the Lakeland Terrier ranked 148 out of 193 breeds by number of American Kennel Club puppy registrations in 2019.

== Description ==
===Appearance===
At 15–17 lb (7–8 kg), the Lakeland Terrier is the smallest of the long legged, black and tan terriers. It is similar in appearance to the slightly larger Welsh Terrier but is finer-boned. The largest of the threesome in this similar group of Terriers is the Airedale. The Lakeland is a sturdy dog, compact, free moving and able to cover ground with little effort and much quickness. 
The dog is relatively narrow in the chest and has a broad muzzle, yet slightly narrower than the Welsh Terrier, with small, V-shaped ears.
The Lakeland breed has a thick bushy wiry outer coat and a soft undercoat. It comes in a variety of colors. The Kennel Club lists the following as acceptable colors: black and tan, blue and tan, red, wheaten, red grizzle, liver, blue or black. Lakeland Terriers have an upright tail, which was previously customarily docked in the United Kingdom and continues to be customarily docked in the United States. Most Lakeland Terriers grow to between 13.5 and 15 inches (34 and 38 cm) in height, measured to the withers.
The eyes are small and dark colored and of oval shape. The nose and pads of the feet are black except in liver colored dogs where the nose and pad coloring will be liver colored. Liver colored dogs will have a slightly lighter colored eye. The dog will not shed if properly groomed. It is suggested that &quot;[r]egular stripping and trimming improves the texture and quality of the coat&quot; and is &quot;necessary to enhance the dog&#x27;s utilitarian purposes&quot; as well as &quot;enhancing him for the show ring&quot;.

===Temperament===
The dogs are friendly, bold, and confident. Shyness is very atypical, as is aggressiveness. Very intelligent and independent minded, they are quick to learn and easy to train, though Lakelands often exhibit &quot;selective deafness&quot; when their interest level is aroused. The Lakeland is quite receptive to crate training. As with most terriers, the Lakeland is energetic; daily exercise and playtimes are a must, lest this active dog seek other outlets for their energy, with undesirable results for the owner.

==History==
As one of the earliest Terriers (Latin derivation of earth), dating from the 1700s, this &quot;earth&quot; dog is a descendant of the old English Black and Tan and Fell Terriers. The Lakeland&#x27;s original service was &quot;going to ground&quot; on the farm in hunt for vermin. Its size and energy make it popular as a hunter in hard to reach places; the breed is among those eligible for competition in sanctioned Earthdog trials.

The working dog version of the Lakeland is often known as the Fell Terrier or Patterdale Terrier. Whereas most terrier breeds have only to bolt their quarry, or to mark it by baying, the Lakeland must be able to kill the foxes in their lair.

In the Lake District of England, the mountainous, rocky terrain is unsuitable for fox hunting on horseback, and foxes were hunted on foot. It has been suggested that the Lakeland Terrier&#x27;s great stamina derives from running all day with the hounds, unlike his close cousin, the fox terrier, who would have been carried in a saddle bag to be released only when the fox had gone to earth.

The UK Kennel Club claims to have recognised Lakeland Terriers in 1921, whereas the Lakeland Terrier Club suggests this was closer to 1928. The Lakeland Terrier Association (now defunct) was founded in 1921. In 1925 the breed attained homogeneity following a cross-breeding with the Fox Terrier and the Airedale Terrier. The Lakeland Terrier Club was founded in 1932 and promoted the breed nationally through Kennel-Club sanctioned shows. The American Kennel Club recognised the breed in 1934. Lakeland Terriers have twice won Best in Show at Crufts and at Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show.

==Health==
A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 14.2 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

<doc id="685998" wikidata="Q375649" url="?curid=685998" title="Northwest Folklife">
<text>Northwest Folklife is an independent 501(c)(3) arts organization that celebrates the multigenerational arts, cultures, and traditions of a global Pacific Northwest.

The Northwest Folklife Festival is an annual festival of ethnic, folk, and traditional art, crafts, and music that takes place over the Memorial Day weekend in Seattle, Washington at Seattle Center. It brings together an estimated 250,000 visitors, 800 volunteers, and about 6,000 musicians, dancers, and other performers. Admission is without charge thanks to community support and donations from attendees. Greeters at the entrances encourage visitors to make donations and special buttons with yearly designs are exchanged for donations.

Northwest Folklife was founded in 1971 by the Seattle Folklore Society, the National Park Service, the National Folk Festival Association (now the National Council for the Traditional Arts), and the City of Seattle, as part of the Park Service&#x27;s urban outreach program to allow the people of its Northwest Region (including Alaska) to publicly present what they &quot;make for their own use and do for their own entertainment.&quot; The first festival was first held in 1972 and has since grown to become the largest festival of its kind in North America.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Folklife was cancelled for 2020 and was deferred to 2021.

== Events, performances, and participation ==

Each year, the festival spotlights a particular ethnic community or folk tradition through the Cultural Focus program. In recent years, these cultural focuses have included maritime culture, Arab-American life, the Urban Indian, Bulgarian Culture and the passing of cultural traditions from generation to generation. The most recent Cultural Focus programs include the &quot;Traditional Roots of Hip Hop&quot;, &quot;Echoes of Aztlan and Beyond&quot; and &quot;Youth Rising&quot;. The festival has over 20 stages, large and small, set up throughout the Seattle Center grounds, which feature mostly local acts organized by the festival. Like the volunteers who support the festival, they perform without compensation. Many of the venues, notably the Armory and the nearby Fisher Pavilion, are set up for participatory dancing.

The festival grounds also include extensive space for music jams and drum circles. Many attendees from across Washington state, Oregon and British Columbia, come to Northwest Folklife annually to play music with friends.
The festival also has buskers (or street performers) who come to the festival from all over and perform along the Seattle Center walkways. The buskers include musicians, jugglers, circus performers, and magicians, and vary in age, style, and professionalism, all playing for donations from the crowds. Festival organizers recently began asking that buskers donate 15% of their earnings (from any tips or CD sales) to the festival, which is the same asked of vendors.

The performances featured both on and off stage expand on what the term &quot;folk&quot; means. Traditional folk music from all over the world is performed, along with rockabilly, Balkan brass, folk punk, jug band, and other music that defies categorization. Dance performances include international folk dancing (including Morris dancing) as well as swing and blues.

The festival is also a place where people can simply hang out and enjoy the (usually sunny) Memorial Day Weather. The giant fountain in the center of Seattle Center serves as a water park. Since the festival is open to all, people often come to picnic, sunbathe, or just enjoy the grounds.

<text>The Wings of Eagles is a 1957 American Metrocolor film starring John Wayne, Dan Dailey and Maureen O&#x27;Hara, based on the life of Frank &quot;Spig&quot; Wead and the history of U.S. Naval aviation from its inception through World War II. The film is a tribute to Wead (who died 10 years earlier, in 1947 at age of 52) from his friend, director John Ford, and was based on Wead&#x27;s &quot;We Plaster the Japs&quot;, published in a 1944 issue of &quot;The American Magazine&quot;.

John Wayne plays naval aviator-turned-screenwriter Wead, who wrote the story or screenplay for such films as &quot;Hell Divers&quot; (1931) with Wallace Beery and Clark Gable, &quot;Ceiling Zero&quot; (1936) with James Cagney, and the Oscar-nominated World War II drama &quot;They Were Expendable&quot; (1945) in which Wayne co-starred with Robert Montgomery.

The supporting cast features Ward Bond, Ken Curtis, Edmund Lowe and Kenneth Tobey. This film was the third of five in which Wayne and O&#x27;Hara appeared together; others were &quot;Rio Grande&quot; (1950), &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; (1952), &quot;McLintock!&quot; (1963) and &quot;Big Jake&quot; (1971).

==Plot==
Soon after World War I is over, Naval Aviator &quot;Spig&quot; Wead, along with John Dale Price, tries to prove to the Navy the value of aviation in combat. To do this, Wead pushes the Navy to compete in racing and endurance competitions. Several races are against the US Army aviation team led by Captain Herbert Allen Hazard.

Wead spends most of his time either flying or horsing around with his teammates, meaning that his wife Minnie, or &quot;Min&quot;, and children are ignored.

The night Wead is promoted to fighter squadron commander, he falls down a flight of stairs at home, breaks his neck and is paralyzed. When &quot;Min&quot; tries to console him he rejects her and the family. He will only let his Navy mates like &quot;Jughead&quot; Carson and Price near him. &quot;Jughead&quot; visits the hospital almost daily to encourage Frank&#x27;s rehabilitation (&quot;I&#x27;m gonna move that toe&quot;). Carson also pushes &quot;Spig&quot; to get over his depression, try to walk, and start writing. Wead achieves some success in all three goals.

After great success in Hollywood, Wead returns to active sea duty with the Navy in World War II, developing the idea of smaller escort, or &quot;jeep,&quot; carriers which follow behind the main fleet as auxiliary strength to the main aircraft carrier force. He returns to active combat duty in the Pacific, witnessing first hand kamikaze attacks. The film&#x27;s battle scenes, based around aircraft carriers, include real combat footage. Following a 50-hour shift during combat operations, Wead has a heart attack and is retired home before the war ends. When he leaves the carrier he is serving in for the last time, he receives eight sideboy in honor of his contributions to aviation—all of them Navy admirals or Army generals.

Director John Ford is represented in the film in the character of film director John Dodge, played by Ward Bond.

==Historical inaccuracies==
One scene shows first the U.S Army, around-the-world flight and then the U.S. Navy winning the Schneider Cup. In fact, the U.S. Navy won the Schneider Cup in 1923. and the U.S. Army embarked on the first aerial circumnavigation from March to September 1924.

Another scene shows a newsreel related to the sinking of the aircraft carrier USS &quot;Hornet&quot; (CV-8), suggesting that she had been doomed by the hit of three kamikaze suicide planes. Although two aircraft did crash into her, she received substantial damage by bombs and torpedoes, then was sunk by Japanese destroyers. Additionally, the term &quot;kamikaze&quot; was not in use to describe suicide pilots at the time of &quot;Hornet&quot;&#x27;s sinking.

==Box office==
MGM reported that the film earned $2.3 million in the U.S. and Canada, and $1,350,000 in other markets, resulting in a profit of $804,000.

==Comic book adaptation==
* Dell Four Color #790 (April 1957)

<doc id="686007" wikidata="Q6700306" url="?curid=686007" title="Luis Alomá">
<text>Luis Alomá Barba (June 19, 1923 – April 7, 1997), nicknamed &quot;Witto&quot;, was a Cuban-born relief pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for the Chicago White Sox from 1950 through 1953. Alomá batted and threw right-handed. He was born in Havana. He would also pitch in farm systems for the Washington Senators and the Detroit Tigers. His first game was on April 19 at the age of 26, and his last game August 30, 1953. 

He died in Park Ridge, Illinois, in 1997, although his cemetery is undetermined.

==Professional career==

===Washington Senators===
In 1944 Alomá signed as an amateur free agent with the Washington Senators. In 1944 he split time between the Class D Kingsport Cherokees of the Appalachian League and the Class A-1 Chattanooga Lookouts of the Southern Association. He went a combined 8–7 with a 4.68 ERA in 26 games, eight for starts. He then played the next two seasonswith the Lookouts. In 1945 he went 14–9 with a 3.17 ERA in 31 games, 29 starts, and in 1946 he went 16–11 with a 3.56 ERA in 36 games, 27 for starts.

In 1947 Alomá split the season between the Lookouts and the Class B Charlotte Hornets of the Tri-State League. He had a dismal stint with the Lookouts, going 2–4 with a 6.93 ERA in 15 games. With the Hornets on the other hand he was quite impressive, going 8–7 with a 3.62 ERA in 18 games. He finished a combined 10–11 with a 4.74 ERA in 33 games.

He spent his last year in the Senators&#x27; farm system playing for his home town team, Havana Cubans of the Florida International League. In what would turn out to be his best professional season at any level, he went 19–6 with a 1.77 ERA in 28 games.

===Detroit Tigers===
In 1949 Alomá was sent by Washington to the Detroit Tigers. He spent the season with the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons of the International League. He compiled a 10–9 record with a 4.60 ERA in 38 games, 22 for start. This would be his only season in the Tigers&#x27; system.

===Chicago White Sox===
Alomá was again traded, this time on August 5, 1949, from the Tigers to Chicago White Sox in exchange for pitcher Alex Carrasquel. He didn&#x27;t pitch in the minors for the rest of the 1949 season.

Alomá was 26 years old when he broke into the big leagues on April 19, 1950, with the White Sox. He finished the 1950 season going an impressive 7–2 with a 3.80 ERA in 42 games, all out of the bullpen.

In 1951 Aloma continued his success at the Major League level, going 6–0 with a 1.82 ERA in 25 games. This would prove to be his best season in the Majors. On June 17, he received a spot start due to a packed White Sox schedule (seven games in four days) and shut out the Philadelphia Athletics on five hits. It was the only start of his career, making him one of only four players ever to throw a shutout in their only start in the American or National Leagues.

He was again with Chicago in 1952 going 3–1 with a 4.28 ERA in 25 games. He compiled a career-high six saves in 1952.

His decline continued in 1953, as he was then 28 years of age, while compiling a record of 2–0 with a 4.70 ERA in 24 games. This was his last season pitching at the Major League level.

In 1954, Alomá spent his entire season with the Double-A Memphis Chickasaws of the Southern Association. He went 6–7 with a 4.25 ERA in 31 games, 14 starts for the Chickasaws. This was his last professional season of baseball. In a four-season career, he posted an 18–3 record with a 3.44 ERA and 15 saves in 116 games pitched.

<text>Columbia City is a neighborhood in southeastern Seattle, Washington, within the city&#x27;s Rainier Valley district. It has a landmark-protected historic business district and is one of the few Seattle neighborhoods with a long history of ethnic and income diversity.

The neighborhood&#x27;s main thoroughfares running north–south are Rainier Avenue S. and Martin Luther King Jr. Way S. The principal east–west thoroughfares are S. Alaska Street, S Orcas Street, and S. Genesee Street. Mass transit includes Sound Transit&#x27;s Central Link light rail service from the Columbia City station (approx. 15 minutes to downtown Seattle and 20 minutes to SeaTac airport).

==History==

===Founding and early years===

The area was once dense conifer forest, primarily inhabited by Coast Salish peoples, until the arrival of the Rainier Valley Electric Railway from Downtown Seattle in 1891. Owners of the electric railway bought forty acres, built a lumber mill, cleared the area for settlement, and promoted their town development under the name &quot;Columbia&quot; – named after Christopher Columbus. Three streets in the neighborhood have names of other famous explorers (a Columbia Street already existed Downtown): Ferdinand Street after Magellan, Hudson Street after Henry Hudson, and Americus Street after Amerigo Vespucci. Lots in 1891 were sold under a canvas tent with the slogan &quot;Columbia, Watch It Grow!&quot; attached to the railway cars.

Columbia incorporated as &quot;Columbia City&quot; in January 1893. Annexation to the City of Seattle came May 3, 1907 following a petition by citizens to the City Council to hold a special election on the matter. Although opposition to annexation had initially been strong due to citizens&#x27; desire for local control, the March 5 vote was overwhelming: 109-3 in favor of annexation to Seattle.

In 1905, the newly renamed Seattle Renton &amp; Southern Railway extended south to Renton. In 1912 the streetcar line went bankrupt and was reorganized as the Seattle &amp; Rainier Valley Railway. Its last run was just after midnight on January 1, 1937. Meanwhile, Columbia City&#x27;s ambitions to become a seaport were thwarted with the completion of the Lake Washington Ship Canal in 1917, which lowered Lake Washington by nine feet and caused Wetmore Slough to dry up. The former slough was used as a dump from 1941 to 1963, and is now Genesee Park.

A major early employer was the Hitt Fireworks Company (1905–1960s) located at what is now Hitt&#x27;s Hill Park. It employed 200 workers in the 1930s and was credited for firework displays at several world&#x27;s fairs and Fourth of July celebrations. During World War II it produced smoke screens and parachute flares. The Hitt Fireworks Company also provided pyrotechnic effects for some major release films including &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;.

===1960s–present===

As African Americans moved to Seattle to be part of the wartime industrial boom, many settled in the area, and in the 1960s the area began to suffer the effects of redlining and racism. By the 1970s, the neighborhood had fallen victim to poverty, housing stock had deteriorated, and many storefronts along Rainier Avenue S. were vacant.

The Columbia City business district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 as the Columbia City Historic District, extending north to S. Alaska Street, south to the intersection of 39th Ave S and Rainier Ave S, east to 39th Ave S., and west to the alley east of 35th Ave S.

Beginning in the late 1980s, Columbia City saw a large influx of minority professionals, artists, gay and lesbian couples and &quot;urban pioneers&quot; seeking classic housing stock at low prices. By the late 1990s, Columbia City was already referred to as one of Seattle&#x27;s most creative neighborhoods. In the last decade, it has seen some of the sharpest rises in property values in the entire Seattle metropolitan area. The result has been widespread gentrification, including the restoration of many of the older homes and, in the last several years, the building of numerous condos and the planned construction of several hundred more. As of 2008, Columbia City is one of Seattle&#x27;s most diverse neighborhoods in terms of income and ethnicity, encompassing everything from public housing to multimillion-dollar view homes.

==Neighborhood character==

Today, the thriving pedestrian business district along Rainier Avenue S. is home to six bars, a grocery store, a number of restaurants, bakeries, coffee shops, assorted retail, an art gallery, fitness facilities, a fraternal clubhouse, a movie theater, and multiple live music venues.

Housing stock include craftsman bungalows, a mix of market-rate and low-income apartment buildings, and townhome developments. Community estimates have put the number of new homes in the planning pipeline as numbering at least 1,500. Many of these developments are in formerly vacant lots.

Train service at the neighborhood&#x27;s Link Light Rail station began in July 2009, connecting the neighborhood to both SeaTac airport and Downtown Seattle. Rainier Vista, once a post-war suburban public housing project, has been redeveloped into a mixed-use, mixed income community built around the light rail station, and includes more than 900 new homes (some subsidized, some rental, some owner-occupied).

=== Community organizations ===
Bike Works is a community charity that lets kids earn bikes by learning to repair them. The Boys and Girls Club has opened a new regional facility in the neighborhood. The neighborhood&#x27;s large Genesee Park and Playfield is also the site of the Rainier Valley Community Center. The Rainier Arts Center and Southside Commons on either sides of Columbia Park are spaces for arts and cultural events. The Rainier Valley Historical Society documents and interprets the history of the larger district. The SouthEast Economic Development organization operates a number of affordable housing units and supports economic development and the arts, including Columbia City Gallery and the Rainier Arts Center, in the district.

=== Festivals and events ===
The Rainier Valley Heritage Parade and Summer Streets Party happens in August. Beatwalk is a live music series on the streets and in business within the Historic District, happening on second Sundays of June through September. A farmer&#x27;s market operates May to mid-October along S Edmunds St with many in the neighborhood gathering for a dinner picnic in adjacent Columbia Park. HONK! Fest West happens the first weekend of June each year. HONK! Fest West is an accessible community music festival driven by the energetic performances of street bands in public spaces.

<text>The White Cliffs of Dover are the region of English coastline facing the Strait of Dover and France. The cliff face, which reaches a height of , owes its striking appearance to its composition of chalk accented by streaks of black flint, deposited during the Late Cretaceous. The cliffs, on both sides of the town of Dover in Kent, stretch for . The White Cliffs of Dover form part of the North Downs. A section of coastline encompassing the cliffs was purchased by the National Trust in 2016.

The cliffs are part of the Dover to Kingsdown Cliffs Site of Special Scientific Interest and Special Area of Conservation. The point where Great Britain is closest to continental Europe, on a clear day the cliffs are visible from France, approximately away. A celebrated UK landmark, the cliffs have featured on commemorative postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail, including in their British coastline series in 2002 and UK A-Z series in 2012.

== Location ==
The cliffs are part of the coastline of Kent in England between approximately and , at the point where Great Britain is closest to continental Europe – the Strait of Dover is approximately across. On a clear day the cliffs are visible from the French coast. The chalk cliffs of the Alabaster Coast of Normandy in France are part of the same geological system.

The White Cliffs are at one end of the Kent Downs designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. In 1999 a sustainable National Trust visitor centre was built in the area. The Gateway building, designed by van Heyningen and Haward Architects, houses a restaurant, an information centre on the work of the National Trust, and details of local archaeology, history and landscape.

== Geology ==
During the Late Cretaceous, between 100 million and 66 million years ago, Great Britain and much of Europe were submerged under a great sea. The sea bottom was covered with white mud formed from fragments of coccoliths, the skeletons of tiny algae that floated in the surface waters and sank to the bottom and, together with the remains of bottom-living creatures, formed muddy sediments. It is thought that the sediments were deposited very slowly, probably half a millimetre a year, equivalent to about 180 coccoliths piled one on top of another. Up to of sediments were deposited in some areas. The weight of overlying sediments caused the deposits to become consolidated into chalk. British chalk deposits are considered stratigraphically to belong in the Chalk Group.
Due to the Alpine orogeny, a major mountain building event during the Cenozoic, the sea-floor deposits were raised above sea level. Until the end of the last glacial period, the British Isles were part of continental Europe, linked by the unbroken Weald-Artois Anticline, a ridge that acted as a natural dam to hold back a large freshwater pro-glacial lake, now submerged under the North Sea. The land masses remained connected until between 450,000 and 180,000 years ago when at least two catastrophic glacial lake outburst floods breached the anticline and destroyed the ridge that connected Britain to Europe. A land connection across the southern North Sea existed intermittently at later times when periods of glaciation resulted in lower sea levels. At the end of the last glacial period, around 10,000 years ago, rising sea levels finally severed the last land connection.

The cliffs&#x27; chalk face shows horizontal bands of dark-coloured flint which is composed of the remains of sea sponges and siliceous planktonic micro-organisms that hardened into the microscopic quartz crystals. Quartz silica filled cavities left by dead marine creatures which are found as flint fossils, especially the internal moulds of Micraster echinoids. Several different ocean floor species such as brachiopods, bivalves, crinoids, and sponges can be found in the chalk deposits, as can sharks&#x27; teeth.

In some areas, layers of soft, grey chalk known as a hardground complex can be seen. Hardgrounds are thought to reflect disruptions in the steady accumulation of sediment when sedimentation ceased and/or the loose surface sediments were stripped away by currents or slumping, exposing the older hardened chalk sediment. A single hardground may have been exhumed 16 or more times before the sediments were compacted and hardened (lithified) to form chalk.

===Cliff erosion and change===
Thousands of years ago, the cliffs were eroding at a year. Research shows that the erosion rate over the last 150 years has increased to a year, and that the erosion is caused by the loss of beach underneath the cliffs exacerbated by stronger storms and human activity such as gravel extraction. Despite this, the cliffs are expected to survive for tens of thousands of years more.

In 2001, a large chunk of the cliff edge, as large as a football pitch, fell into the Channel. Further large sections collapsed on 15 March 2012, 4 February 2020, and on 3 February 2021.

== Ecology ==
The chalk grassland environment above the cliffs is excellent for many species of wild flowers, butterflies and birds, and has been designated a Special Area of Conservation and a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Rangers and volunteers work to clear invasive plants that threaten the native flora. A grazing programme involving Exmoor ponies has been established to help to clear faster-growing invasive plants, allowing smaller, less robust native plants to survive. The ponies are managed by the National Trust, Natural England, and County Wildlife Trusts to maintain vegetation on nature reserves.
The cliffs are the first landing point for many migratory birds flying inland from across the English Channel. After a 120-year absence, in 2009 it was reported that ravens had returned to the cliffs. Similar in appearance but smaller, the jackdaw is abundant. The rarest of the birds that live along the cliffs is the peregrine falcon. In recent decline, the skylark also makes its home on the cliffs. The cliffs are home to fulmars and to colonies of black-legged kittiwake, a species of gull. Since bluebirds are not indigenous to the UK, some believe that bluebirds, as mentioned in the classic World War II song &quot;(There&#x27;ll Be Bluebirds Over) The White Cliffs of Dover&quot;, composed by American artists, may actually refer to swallows and/or to house martins, which make an annual migration to continental Europe, many of them crossing the English Channel at least twice a year.

Among the wildflowers are several varieties of orchids, the rarest of which is the early spider orchid, which has yellow-green to brownish green petals and looks like the body of a large spider.
Rock samphire is an edible, salt tolerant succulent plant that grows on the cliff&#x27;s slopes. The oxtongue broomrape is an unusual plant that lives on the roots of a host plant. It has yellow, white, or blue snapdragon-like flowers and about 90 per cent of the UK&#x27;s population is found on the cliffs.
Viper&#x27;s-bugloss, a showy plant in vivid shades of blue and purple with red stamens, also grows along the cliffs.

The abundance of wildflowers provides homes for about thirty species of butterfly. The rare Adonis blue can be seen in spring and again in autumn. Males have vibrant blue wings lined with a white margin, whereas the females are a rich chocolate brown. This species&#x27; sole larval food plant is the horseshoe vetch and it has a symbiotic relationship with red or black ants. The eggs are laid singly on very small foodplants growing in short turf. This provides a warm microclimate, suitable for larval development, which is also favoured by ants. The caterpillar has green and yellow stripes to provide camouflage while it feeds on vetch. The ants milk the sugary secretions from the larval &quot;honey glands&quot; and, in return, protect the larvae from predators and parasitoids, even going so far as to bury them at night. The larvae pupate in the upper soil, and continue to be protected by the ants, often in their nests, until the adults emerge in the spring or autumn.

Similar in appearance, but more abundant, is the chalkhill blue, a chalk grassland specialist that can be seen in July and August. Threatened species include the silver-spotted skipper and straw belle. The well-known red admiral can be seen from February until November. The marbled white, black and white with a white wing border, can be seen from June to August.

== History ==

A possible Iron Age hillfort has been discovered at Dover, on the site of the later castle. The area was also inhabited during the Roman period when Dover was used as a port. A lighthouse survives from this era, one of a pair at Dover which helped shipping navigate the port. It is likely the area around the surviving lighthouse was inhabited in the early medieval period as archaeologists have found a Saxon cemetery here, and the church of St Mary in Castro was built next to the lighthouse in the 10th or 11th century.

It is thought that the name Albion, an ancient or poetic term referring to Great Britain, was derived from the Latin &quot;albus&quot; (meaning &#x27;white&#x27;) as an allusion to the white cliffs.

=== Dover Castle ===
Dover Castle, the largest castle in England, was founded in the 11th century. It has been described as the &quot;Key to England&quot; owing to its defensive significance throughout history. The castle was founded by William the Conqueror in 1066 and rebuilt for Henry II, King John, and Henry III. This expanded the castle to its current size, taking its curtain walls to the edge of the cliffs. During the First Barons&#x27; War the castle was held by King John&#x27;s soldiers and besieged by the French between May 1216 and May 1217. The castle was also besieged in 1265 during the Second Barons&#x27; War. In the 16th century, cannons were installed at the castle, but it became less important militarily as Henry VIII had built artillery forts along the coast. Dover Castle was captured in 1642 during the Civil War when the townspeople climbed the cliffs and surprised the royalist garrison, giving a symbolic victory against royal control. Towards the end of the war many castles were slighted, but Dover was spared.

The castle had renewed importance in the 1740s as the development of heavy artillery made capturing ports an important part of warfare. During the Napoleonic Wars, in particular, the defences were remodelled and a series of tunnels were dug into the cliff to act as barracks, adding space for an extra 2,000 soldiers. The tunnels mostly lay abandoned until the Second World War.

=== South Foreland Lighthouse ===

South Foreland Lighthouse is a Victorian-era lighthouse on the South Foreland in St. Margaret&#x27;s Bay, which was once used to warn ships approaching the nearby Goodwin Sands. Goodwin Sands is a sandbank at the southern end of the North Sea lying off the Deal coast. The area consists of a layer of fine sand approximately deep resting on a chalk platform belonging to the same geological feature that incorporates the White Cliffs of Dover. More than 2,000 ships are believed to have been wrecked on the Goodwin Sands because they lie close to the major shipping lanes through the Straits of Dover. It went out of service in 1988 and is now owned by the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty.

=== Second World War ===

The cliffs have great symbolic value in Britain because they face towards continental Europe across the narrowest part of the English Channel (approximately between coasts), where invasions have historically threatened and against which the cliffs form a symbolic guard. The National Trust calls the cliffs &quot;an icon of Britain&quot;, with &quot;the white chalk face a symbol of home and wartime defence.&quot; Because crossing at Dover was the primary route to the continent before the advent of air travel, the white line of cliffs also formed the first or last sight of Britain for travellers. During the Second World War, thousands of allied troops on the little ships in the Dunkirk evacuation saw the welcoming sight of the cliffs. In the summer of 1940, reporters gathered at Shakespeare Cliff to watch aerial dogfights between German and British aircraft during the Battle of Britain.

Vera Lynn, known as &quot;The Forces&#x27; Sweetheart&quot; for her 1942 wartime classic &quot;(There&#x27;ll Be Bluebirds Over) The White Cliffs of Dover&quot; celebrated her 100th birthday in 2017. That year she led a campaign for donations to buy of land atop Dover&#x27;s cliffs when it was feared that they might be sold to developers; the campaign met its target after only three weeks. The National Trust, which owns the surrounding areas, plans to return the land to a natural state of chalk grassland and preserve existing military structures from the Second World War. In June 2021, a wildflower meadow on White Cliffs of Dover was named in honour of Dame Vera Lynn.

==Attractions==
=== Dover Museum ===
Dover Museum was founded in 1836. Shelled from France in 1942 during the Second World War, the museum lost much of its collections, including nearly all its natural history collections. Much of the surviving material was left neglected in caves and other stores until 1946. In 1948 a temporary museum was opened and in 1991 a new museum of three storeys, built behind its original Victorian façade, was opened. In 1999, a new gallery on the second floor centred on the Dover Bronze Age Boat was opened.

=== Samphire Hoe Country Park ===

Samphire Hoe Country Park is a nature reserve on a new piece of land created from the rock excavated during the construction of the Channel Tunnel. It covers a site at the foot of Shakespeare Cliff, between Dover and Folkestone. There is an education shelter with a classroom and exhibition area. Staff and volunteers are available to answer questions and provide information about the wildlife in the reserve. The building&#x27;s design incorporates eco-construction criteria. The nature reserve is named after the edible plant rock samphire, which grows on the cliffs and used to be gathered by hanging ropes over the cliff&#x27;s edge. Shakespeare mentions rock samphire in his play &quot;King Lear&quot; and includes a reference to this trade with the lines &quot;Half-way down / Hangs one that gathers samphire; dreadful trade!&quot; (Act IV, Scene VI Lines 14–15). This refers to the dangers involved in collecting rock samphire on sea cliffs. Shakespeare Cliff was named after the reference to this &quot;dreadful trade&quot;.

=== Fan Bay Deep Shelter ===
Fan Bay Deep Shelter is a series of tunnels constructed during World War II. The tunnels were opened to the public on 20 July 2015.

== In song and literature ==
*One of the most famous references in English literature to the White Cliffs is in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot;. In Act IV, Scene VI, Edgar persuades the blinded Earl of Gloucester that he is at the edge of a cliff at Dover. In Act IV, Scene I, Lines 76–8, Gloucester says, &quot;There is a cliff, whose high and bending head looks fearfully in the confinèd deep: Bring me but to the very brim of it.&quot; Edgar then fools Gloucester into thinking he is at the cliff edge and describes the scene: &quot;Here&#x27;s the place! – stand still – how fearful/ And dizzy &#x27;tis, to cast one&#x27;s eye so low ... halfway down/Hangs one that gathers samphire: dreadful trade!/Methinks he seems no bigger than his head.&quot; (Act IV, Scene VI, Lines 11–16).

*In 1851, English poet Matthew Arnold began his lyric poem &quot;Dover Beach&quot; by epitomizing the beauty of the Kent coast:
::&quot;The sea is calm tonight.
::The tide is full, the moon lies fair
::Upon the straits; on the French coast the light
::Gleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand,
::Glimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay.&quot;

*The verse novel &quot;The White Cliffs&quot; by Alice Duer Miller encouraged U.S. entry into World War II. The poem was extremely successful on both sides of the Atlantic, selling nearly one million copies – an unusual number for a book of verse. It was broadcast and recorded by British-American actress Lynn Fontanne (with a symphonic accompaniment), and the story was made into the 1944 film &quot;The White Cliffs of Dover&quot;.
*Jimmy Cliff wrote and recorded the song &quot;Many Rivers to Cross&quot; in 1969. The song included the line &quot;Wandering I am lost, as I travel along the White Cliffs of Dover.&quot;
*The 1941 song &quot;(There&#x27;ll Be Bluebirds Over) The White Cliffs of Dover&quot; is a popular World War II song composed by Walter Kent to lyrics by Nat Burton. It was made famous by Vera Lynn&#x27;s 1942 version.
*The White Cliffs have long been a landmark for sailors. It is noted as such in the sea shanty &quot;Spanish Ladies&quot;:
:&quot;The first land we sighted was called the Dodman,
:Next Rame Head off Plymouth, off Portsmouth the Wight;
:We sailed by Beachy, by Fairlight and Dover,
:And then we bore up for the South Foreland light.
*The song &quot;Calais to Dover&quot; by Bright Eyes from the 2020 album &quot;Down In The Weeds Where The World Once Was&quot; refers to the cliffs most likely via Shakespeare or Matthew Arnold: &quot;Threw up on the ferry ride from Calais back to Dover/As pale as the white cliffs that we faced/Wasn&#x27;t afraid, eventualities, just knew that it was over/No brushes with death could keep us sober.&quot;
*American guitarist, Eric Johnson recorded an instrumental &quot;Cliffs of Dover&quot; in 1990 as part of his album &quot;Ah Via Musicom&quot;. &quot;Cliffs of Dover&quot; was voted number 17 in Guitar World magazine&#x27;s list of 100 Greatest Guitar Solos and won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 1992.
*The Decemberists&#x27;s song &quot;We Both Go Down Together&quot; opens with a couple standing on the cliffs, presumably about to jump: &quot;Here on these cliffs of Dover/So high you can&#x27;t see over/And while your head is spinning/Hold tight, it&#x27;s just beginning.&quot; The song appears on their 2005 album &quot;Picaresque&quot; and tells the story of either a joint suicide or a murder-suicide; the unreliable narrator is a &quot;sociopath&quot;, according to the song&#x27;s writer, Colin Meloy. 
*&quot;On a Piece of Chalk&quot; was a lecture by Thomas Henry Huxley presented to the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1868 and published later that year. The piece reconstructs the geological history of Great Britain from a simple piece of chalk and demonstrates science as &quot;organized common sense&quot;.

<text>Wolf is a 1994 American romantic horror film directed by Mike Nichols and starring Jack Nicholson, Michelle Pfeiffer, James Spader, Kate Nelligan, Richard Jenkins, Christopher Plummer, Eileen Atkins, David Hyde Pierce, and Om Puri. It was written by Jim Harrison and Wesley Strick, and an uncredited Elaine May. The music was composed by Ennio Morricone and the cinematography was done by Giuseppe Rotunno.

==Plot==
Will Randall, editor-in-chief of a large New York publishing house, runs over a large black wolf on a Vermont country road; he is bitten while attempting to help it. A few days later, tycoon Raymond Alden announces that he&#x27;s taking over the publishing house. The aging and ailing Will accepts a demotion while his unscrupulous protégé Stewart Swinton is given his previous position. Will meets Alden&#x27;s headstrong but little-accomplished daughter, Laura. Will soon finds his vitality increased and his senses sharpened, which leads him suspecting his wife Charlotte and Swinton are having an affair after smelling Swinton&#x27;s scent on Charlotte&#x27;s clothing. Will&#x27;s suspicion is confirmed when he surprises the two in Swinton&#x27;s apartment. He angrily bites Swinton&#x27;s hand before leaving Charlotte.

Will begins a relationship with Laura and spends the night at the Aldens&#x27; villa after suffering a fainting spell. He awakens in a transformed state and mauls a deer in the estate&#x27;s park, later awakening covered in blood. He visits pagan expert Dr. Vijav Alezais, who explains he is transforming into a wolf. He gives Will an amulet to prevent his transformation&#x27;s completion. That night, during another transformation, Will breaks into a zoo, steals handcuffs from a policeman while evading arrest, and viciously attacks a group of muggers. He wakes up in his hotel, with no memory of the previous night.

Will organizes a mutiny of writers who threaten to leave the publishing house unless Will remains editor-in-chief. Alden agrees, and Will&#x27;s first act is to fire Stewart. He urinates on his shoes in a bathroom, claiming he is &quot;marking his territory&quot;. While washing his hands, Will finds a mugger&#x27;s finger in his handkerchief and realizes he wounded someone. He cuffs himself to his hotel room radiator, but Laura arrives and allays his fears. They spend the night together, but Will later leaves the hotel room unnoticed and roams Central Park transformed. The next morning, Detective Bridger informs Will that Charlotte was found dead in Central Park with canine DNA on her.

That evening, Laura locks Will in a horse stable at his request and makes her way to the police station to give a statement. There she runs into Swinton, who is behaving brutishly and sporting golden eyes. Laura hurries away, making arrangements for her and Will to leave the country. Swinton follows Laura and invades the estate, killing two guards. When Swinton attempts to rape Laura, Will discards the amulet and fights Swinton, ruthlessly mauling him. Laura grabs a gun from a dead guard and finishes off Swinton. Will, still in a half-human state, has a brief moment with Laura and then disappears into the New England woods. Minutes later, Laura amazes Bridger with her heightened senses as she takes her leave. Will, having transformed into a wolf, howls for Laura in the woods as Laura&#x27;s eyes begin to change.

==Cast==
==Production==
Screenwriter Jim Harrison left the production because of creative differences with director Mike Nichols, claiming, &quot;I wanted Dionysian, but he wanted Apollonian. He took my wolf and made it into a Chihuahua. I cracked up for 10 minutes and then went out into the country and stood in front of a wolf den and apologized while my dog hid under the truck.&quot; Following his experience with the film, Harrison decided to leave Hollywood.

Mia Farrow was initially signed on for the role of Charlotte Randall, but was apparently considered too controversial a choice by the film company due to the then-current Woody Allen and Soon-Yi Previn affair. She decided to take a pay cut to accommodate the studios but had to eventually bow out in the long run due to other scheduling conflicts. Kate Nelligan was immediately cast instead. Sharon Stone turned down the role of Laura Alden, eventually played by Michelle Pfeiffer.

Filming took place in New York City, Long Island, and Los Angeles. The exteriors for Raymond Alden&#x27;s country mansion were filmed at Old Westbury Gardens in Nassau County, New York. Will Randall&#x27;s publishing offices are in the Bradbury Building in downtown Los Angeles, a location frequently used in movies.

The film was shot from early April to late July in 1993. Its release was delayed for six to eight months, in order to reshoot the poorly received ending.

The wolves were professionally trained by employees from Thousand Oaks, California&#x27;s &quot;Animal Actors of Hollywood&quot; and Palmdale, California&#x27;s &quot;Performing Animal Troupe&quot;.

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;Wolf&quot; grossed $65 million domestically and $66 million internationally, for a total of $131 million worldwide.

===Critical response===
&quot;Wolf&quot; holds a score of 62% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 60 reviews. The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Wolf&quot; misses the jugular after showing flashes of killer instinct early on, but engaging stars and deft direction make this a unique horror-romance worth watching&quot;.

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;So long as it stays confined to the level of metaphor, as it does in the first hour of &quot;Wolf&quot;, this idea really is irresistible.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the movie three stars, and wrote, &quot;&quot;Wolf&quot; is both more and less than a traditional werewolf movie. Less, because it doesn&#x27;t provide the frankly vulgar thrills and excesses some audience members are going to be hoping for. And more, because Nicholson and his director, Mike Nichols, are halfway serious about exploring what might happen if a New York book editor did become a werewolf&quot;. Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;In its own delightfully peculiar way, the film is the only one of its kind ever made – a horror film about office politics[...] The movie isn&#x27;t wholly great; it starts to unravel just after the midway point. Still, there are charms enough all the way through to make it the most seductive, most enjoyable film of the summer&quot;. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it &quot;a rapturous romantic thriller with a darkly comic subtext about what kills human values&quot;.

Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that it &quot;works beautifully when it&#x27;s rooted in reality, when the Werewolf Thing functions as a multiple metaphor for unleashed-id sexuality and the law of the corporate jungle&quot; Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;The studio must convince the horror/special-effects crowd to attend a Jack Nicholson/Michelle Pfeiffer/Mike Nichols picture and persuade the film-makers&#x27; fans to see a genre pic... But no matter how snazzy the trappings, when you get down to it, this is still, at heart, a werewolf picture&quot;. &quot;Time Out&quot; wrote, &quot;Quite frankly, it&#x27;s hard to fathom why exactly anyone would have wanted to make this slick, glossy, but utterly redundant werewolf movie... Overall, this is needlessly polished nonsense: not awful; just toothless, gutless and bloodless.&quot;

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

===Year-end lists===
* Honorable mention – Mike Clark, &quot;USA Today&quot;
* Honorable mention – Glenn Lovell, &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot;
* Honorable mention – Howie Movshovitz, &quot;The Denver Post&quot;
* Honorable mention – Bob Carlton, &quot;The Birmingham News&quot;

===Awards and nominations===
&quot;Wolf&quot; won a Saturn Award for Best Writing for Jim Harrison and Wesley Strick&#x27;s screenplay, and it was nominated for a further 5 Saturn Awards, in the categories of Best Horror Film, Best Actor (Jack Nicholson), Best Actress (Michelle Pfeiffer), Best Supporting Actor (James Spader) and Best Make-up (Rick Baker).

Ennio Morricone was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition Written for a Motion Picture or for Television.

<doc id="686029" wikidata="Q1068633" url="?curid=686029" title="Groundbreaking">
<text>Groundbreaking, also known as cutting, sod-cutting, turning the first sod, turf-cutting, or a sod-turning ceremony, is a traditional ceremony in many cultures that celebrates the first day of construction for a building or other project. Such ceremonies are often attended by dignitaries such as politicians and businesspeople.

The shovel used during the groundbreaking is often a special ceremonial shovel, sometimes colored gold, meant to be saved for subsequent display and may be engraved. In other groundbreaking ceremonies, a bulldozer is used instead of a shovel to mark the first day of construction. In some groundbreaking ceremonies, the shovel and the bulldozer mark the first day of construction. In other places, this ceremony can be replaced by a &quot;laying of the first stone&quot; event.

==Meaning==
When used as an adjective, the term &quot;groundbreaking&quot; may mean being or making something that has never been done, seen, or made before, &quot;stylistically innovative works&quot;.

== History ==
Groundbreaking ceremonies have been celebrated for centuries to begin the construction of a property, thanking those who made it possible. Early ceremonies were rooted in religion. Though adapted to modern times, these ceremonies are still important to the construction industry.

Initially, some offerings/refreshments were also used to offer in such ceremonies, including:

* Fruit
* Wine
* Grains
* Incense
* Beans 
* Tea leaves 
* Sacred items, like holy coins and relics

=== Historical groundbreaking ceremonies ===
The first documented groundbreaking ceremony took place in ancient China, in 113 BC. Later, the tradition of symbolically consecrating the project&#x27;s location became a part of Hindu, Taoist, Shinto, Buddhist, and Feng Shui traditions. 
Historically, these are some notable events that were inaugurated by groundbreaking ceremonies.
* The festival for the Washington Monument in 1848 was hosted by President James K. Polk. 
* The ceremony for the Parliament House in Melbourne, Australia in 1980 was held for Queen Elizabeth.

== Modern approach to groundbreaking ceremonies ==
The reason for holding groundbreaking ceremonies in today&#x27;s modern world has nothing or little to do with religion. Today, the western world exercises this old-age practice with a different purpose.

Today, the celebratory serves as a business activity for building interest in a new project/building. The ceremony generates positive press and regards those who are significant to the development and its overall scope.

Usually, the project developer organizes groundbreaking ceremonies to attract clients and reflect positive impacts on the community, customers/clients, and employees.

Often such ceremonies also incorporate speeches by people of influence, like the founder of the company, a celebrity, or a known politician/member of the community. The sole purpose of such speeches is to showcase how a company is working, growing, meeting its mission, and/or reflecting on its vision, the company&#x27;s struggles, and future plans.

To create a lasting impression of the company and the ceremony, some common supplies, including shovels, hard hats, etc., are given to participants/attendees.

=== Recent trends ===
Nowadays, real estate companies are trying different approaches to their groundbreaking ceremonies to stand out among their competitors and draw media attention.

Lowe Enterprises, a Los Angeles developer, hosted a &quot;wall raising&quot; in 1997 to draw attention to the start of their building project. Another developer from Santa Monica hosted a &quot;bottoming out&quot; party to mark the completion of their parking garage&#x27;s lowest level.

A Hollywood developer, TrizecHahn, practiced another unconventional ceremony. The company hosted a costly groundbreaking event for its $350-million Hollywood &amp; Highland entertainment-retail project. The event was served by music producer Quincy Jones and catered by the famed chef Wolfgang Puck.

<doc id="686031" wikidata="Q1053290" url="?curid=686031" title="Kii Peninsula">
<text>The is the largest peninsula on the island of Honshū in Japan and is located within the Kansai region. It is named after the ancient Kii Province. The peninsula has long been a sacred place in Buddhism, Shinto, and Shugendo, and many people would visit from all over Japan as part of the Kumano religious practices.

== Overview ==

The area south of the “Central Tectonic Line” is called , and is home to reef-like coral communities which are amongst the northernmost in the world (apart from cold-water corals) due to the presence of the warm Kuroshio Current, though these are threatened by global warming and human interference. Because of the Kuroshio’s strong influence, the climate of Nankii is the wettest in the Earth’s subtropics with rainfall in the southern mountains believed to reach per year and averaging in the southeastern town of Owase, comparable to Ketchikan, Alaska or Tortel in southern Chile. When typhoons hit Japan, the Kii Peninsula is typically the worst affected area and daily rainfalls as high as are known so the Kii Peninsula is often referred to as the Typhoon Ginza (after Ginza in Tokyo). The peninsula was severely affected by the 2011 typhoon season, which caused severe damage and many deaths. A significant amount of damage remains today from the 2011 landslides caused by the typhoons. 

The natural landscape of the Kii Peninsula is dense temperate rainforest, but the vast majority of forests are monoculture pine plantations which were planted to rebuild after the destruction of World War II. The region is well known for its citrus varieties and orchards. Much of the coast consists of networks of small rias into which flow very steep and rapid streams characterised by numerous high waterfalls. Forestry and fishing were the traditional economic mainstays of the region and remain important even today despite a declining population and labour force. The region is affected by the dual-crises of severe population decline and widespread poverty.

==Location==
Wakayama Prefecture occupies much of the area, including the entire southern part. To the northwest of Wakayama Prefecture is Osaka Prefecture, whose southern part is on the peninsula. East of Osaka Prefecture is landlocked Nara Prefecture; farther east is Mie Prefecture.

The Seto Inland Sea lies to the west of the Kii Peninsula. To the south and east is the Pacific Ocean and to the north is the valley of the Kiso Three Rivers and Ise Bay.

==Notable places==
Notable places in the Kii Peninsula include:
* Ise, the location of the Grand Shrine of Ise and center of pearl production.
* Kumano Region, home of the Kumano Shrines, the World Heritage Kumano Kodo pilgrimage routes and Nachi Falls. Another name is Muro District.
* Kushimoto, Wakayama, the southernmost point in Honshū.
* Mount Kōya (or Kōyasan), the headquarters of the Shingon sect of Buddhism.
* Matsuzaka, now the center of a major beef-producing area, formerly the center of Ise merchants.
* Nara, former capital of Japan.
* Shirahama, a resort town famous for its beachside onsens.
* Taiji, Wakayama, the birthplace of Japanese traditional whaling.
* Wakayama, former home of the Kii (or Kishu) Tokugawa clan. It is the location of the Hinokuma Shrine, which is affiliated to the Grand Shrine of Ise.
* Yoshino District, a wild area of heavily forested deep mountains, home of the Southern Imperial Court during the Nanboku-chō period of Japanese history.

The Kii Peninsula is the location of a UNESCO World Heritage Site: Sacred Sites and Pilgrimage Routes in the Kii Mountain Range.

In 2004, UNESCO designated three other locations on the Kii Peninsula as World Heritage Sites. They are:

#Yoshino and Mount Omine, mountainous areas in the north of the peninsula.
#Kumano Shrines, three shrines at the southern tip of the peninsula.
#Mount Kōya, the mountain at the west of the peninsula.

==Transportation==
* Nanki-Shirahama Airport in Shirahama serves the southern part of the Kii Peninsula.
* The Kisei Main Line connects Wakayama to Mie Prefecture and runs along the peninsula&#x27;s coastline.

<text>Cradle Will Rock is a 1999 American historical drama film written, produced and directed by Tim Robbins. The story fictionalizes the true events that surrounded the development of the 1937 musical &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot; by Marc Blitzstein; it adapts history to create an account of the original production, bringing in other stories of the time to produce a social commentary on the role of art and power in the 1930s, particularly amidst the struggles of the labor movement at the time and the corresponding appeal of socialism and communism among many intellectuals, artists and working-class people in the same period.

The film is not based on Orson Welles&#x27;s unproduced screenplay for &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot;, an autobiographical drama about the production of Blitzstein&#x27;s musical. Written in 1984, a year before Welles&#x27;s death, the script was published in 1994; the film has not been produced.

==Plot==
At the height of the Great Depression, the Federal Theatre Project, led by Hallie Flanagan, brings low-cost theater to millions across America. FTP and other projects of the Works Progress Administration face anti-communist criticism and increasing government pressure led by the new House Committee on Un-American Activities.

In New York City, playwright Marc Blitzstein is working on his new musical, &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot;, but lacks the inspiration to finish it. While attending a public protest, he is visited by two imaginary figures representing his late wife and the famed German playwright Bertolt Brecht. They encourage him to make the play more relevant to the times rather than an abstract concept. He eventually finishes the play, and it is greenlit by Flanagan as an FTP production and attached to director Orson Welles and producer John Houseman.

Anti-communist FTP clerk Hazel Huffman convenes a meeting of like-minded WPA employees. Tommy Crickshaw, a ventriloquist with FTP&#x27;s vaudeville project who resents his assignment to train the untalented duo Sid and Larry attends the meeting and finds himself attracted to Hazel. Although they grow closer while rehearsing the alarmist testimony Hazel hopes to give to HUAC, Hazel rejects Tommy&#x27;s advances. Depressed, he oversleeps and wakes to find Sid and Larry performing his routine. Hazel is later called to testify before HUAC, prompting her coworkers to shun her.

Margherita Sarfatti, an envoy of Benito Mussolini&#x27;s government, visits New York to gain support from American industrialists for Mussolini&#x27;s war effort. Among her connections are William Randolph Hearst, Nelson Rockefeller, and steel magnate Gray Mathers, whose pro-fascist dealings create tension with his wife, Constance, an enthusiastic patron of the arts and friend of Houseman. Sarfatti connects Rockefeller with Diego Rivera, who is commissioned to paint a mural in the lobby of Rockefeller Center. However, Rivera soon clashes with both Rockefeller and Sarfatti over the mural&#x27;s communist themes, especially its depiction of Vladimir Lenin.

Following Hazel&#x27;s HUAC testimony, the WPA faces the threat of losing its budget. Although Flanagan appears before HUAC to give a passionate defense of FTP, the project is forced to cut funding for all FTP productions, lay off thousands of workers, and order all ongoing projects to cease their activities, including &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot;. A now-unemployed Tommy performs a set portraying his ventriloquist dummy as a Communist, before walking off the stage and leaving the dummy behind.

&quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot;″s opening is cancelled in the wake of the FTP cutbacks, as the actors&#x27; union refuses to let them perform without federal approval. Rather than give in to defeat, Welles and Houseman (assisted by a gleeful Constance) set up an improvised performance in a shuttered theater, with Blitzstein as both cast and orchestra. Male lead Aldo Silvano, who struggles to support his family after breaking with his well-to-do parents over their fascist sympathies, reluctantly goes along with the union&#x27;s decision to avoid losing his job; female lead Olive Stanton must choose between the show and her live-in relationship with successful costar John Adair.

As Blitzstein begins the first song of the performance, the other actors, including Aldo and a now-homeless Olive, suddenly appear in the audience and perform the entire play without setting foot on the stage. As the show ends, the cast and audience break into celebration. Simultaneously, workers destroy Rivera&#x27;s mural; Tommy shares a bittersweet embrace with a tearful Hazel in his dressing room; and a group of former FTP performers stage a mock funeral procession of Crickshaw&#x27;s dummy (renamed &quot;Federal Theatre Project&quot;). The procession ends in present-day Times Square, which is lined with billboards advertising Broadway plays.

==Cast==
The film has a large ensemble cast of interconnected characters, including both historical and fictional figures.

Bob Balaban portrays WPA Administrator Harry Hopkins. Daniel Jenkins portrays Will Geer, a real member of &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot;″s original cast (although in the film Geer plays the Druggist, while the real-life Geer originated the role of Mr. Mister). Audra McDonald, Erin Hill, Victoria Clark, and Barnard Hughes also appear as Federal Theatre Project performers cast in &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot;. Sarah Hyland plays Aldo&#x27;s daughter Giovanna, while Lynn Cohen and Dominic Chianese play Aldo&#x27;s parents; Peter Jacobson appears as an uncle who antagonizes Aldo. Gretchen Mol appears as Marion Davies.

==Historical context and production==

This film takes place in the 1930s during the Great Depression. The film takes some narrative license and presents certain events as simultaneous, when they really occurred at different times. Some examples of this are the addition and subsequent destruction of Rivera&#x27;s &quot;Man at the Crossroads&quot; in the RCA Building (1933–34), the Italian invasion of Ethiopia (1935), labor strikes against Little Steel (1937) and the Dies Committee&#x27;s assault on the Federal Theatre Project (1938) (Weales 2000). 

In telling the story of &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot;—a leftist labor musical that was sponsored by the Federal Theatre Project (FTP) only to be banned after the WPA cut the project and diverted its funds elsewhere—Robbins is able to tie in issues such as labor unrest, repression by the House Committee on Un-American Activities, and the role and value of art in such a tumultuous time.

The film was released in conjunction with a book that Robbins put together to provide a deeper look into the film&#x27;s time period. The book includes the film&#x27;s script, which is accompanied by essays and pictures describing the people, events, and themes that are the basis for the film.

The 1937 children&#x27;s play &quot;Revolt of the Beavers&quot; by playwright/screenwriter Oscar Saul (who would later do the screenplay for the 1951 film &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;) was also featured in this film. It, too, was under scrutiny from the HUAC for promoting a communistic ideal of equal work and equal rewards. In the film, it was valiantly defended by the head of the FTP, Hallie Flanagan, and the play ran for approximately one month at the Adelphi Theater in New York.

==Reception==
&quot;Cradle Will Rock&quot; was met with mostly positive reviews. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 65%, based on 74 reviews, and an average rating of 6.3/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Witty and provocative.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

While the original production of &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot; was stated to be &quot;The most exciting evening of theater this New York generation has seen&quot; (MacLeish, Cole 2000), some critics did not feel the same about Robbins&#x27; reproduction of the event for film. Although it was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival, among other festivals, and some have praised the film as an astute commentary on censorship and the lines between art and life (Cole 2000), others have criticized the piece for attempting to bring too many themes together into one story, and thus losing the power of the original context altogether (Alleva 2000; Weales 2000).

<doc id="686036" wikidata="Q657009" url="?curid=686036" title="Wave vector">
<text>In physics, a wave vector (or wavevector) is a vector used in describing a wave, with a typical unit being cycle per metre. It has a magnitude and direction. Its magnitude is the wavenumber of the wave (inversely proportional to the wavelength), and its direction is perpendicular to the wavefront. In isotropic media, this is also the direction of wave propagation.

A closely related vector is the angular wave vector (or angular wavevector), with a typical unit being radian per metre. The wave vector and angular wave vector are related by a fixed constant of proportionality, 2 radians per cycle.

It is common in several fields of physics to refer to the angular wave vector simply as the &quot;wave vector&quot;, in contrast to, for example, crystallography. It is also common to use the symbol for whichever is in use.

In the context of special relativity, a &quot;wave four-vector&quot; can be defined, combining the (angular) wave vector and (angular) frequency.

==Definition==

The terms &quot;wave vector&quot; and &quot;angular wave vector&quot; have distinct meanings. Here, the wave vector is denoted by formula_1 and the wavenumber by formula_2. The angular wave vector is denoted by and the angular wavenumber by . These are related by formula_3.

A sinusoidal traveling wave follows the equation
:formula_4
where:
* is position,
* is time,
* is a function of and describing the disturbance describing the wave (for example, for an ocean wave, would be the excess height of the water, or for a sound wave, would be the excess air pressure).
* is the amplitude of the wave (the peak magnitude of the oscillation),
* is a phase offset,
* is the (temporal) angular frequency of the wave, describing how many radians it traverses per unit of time, and related to the period by the equation formula_5
* is the angular wave vector of the wave, describing how many radians it traverses per unit of distance, and related to the wavelength by the equation formula_6

The equivalent equation using the wave vector and frequency is
:formula_7
where:
* formula_8 is the frequency
* formula_1 is the wave vector

==Direction of the wave vector==

The direction in which the wave vector points must be distinguished from the &quot;direction of wave propagation&quot;. The &quot;direction of wave propagation&quot; is the direction of a wave&#x27;s energy flow, and the direction that a small wave packet will move, i.e. the direction of the group velocity. For light waves in vacuum, this is also the direction of the Poynting vector. On the other hand, the wave vector points in the direction of phase velocity. In other words, the wave vector points in the normal direction to the surfaces of constant phase, also called wavefronts.

In a lossless isotropic medium such as air, any gas, any liquid, amorphous solids (such as glass), and cubic crystals, the direction of the wavevector is the same as the direction of wave propagation. If the medium is anisotropic, the wave vector in general points in directions other than that of the wave propagation. The wave vector is always perpendicular to surfaces of constant phase.

For example, when a wave travels through an anisotropic medium, such as light waves through an asymmetric crystal or sound waves through a sedimentary rock, the wave vector may not point exactly in the direction of wave propagation.

==In solid-state physics==

In solid-state physics, the &quot;wavevector&quot; (also called k-vector) of an electron or hole in a crystal is the wavevector of its quantum-mechanical wavefunction. These electron waves are not ordinary sinusoidal waves, but they do have a kind of &quot;envelope function&quot; which is sinusoidal, and the wavevector is defined via that envelope wave, usually using the &quot;physics definition&quot;. See Bloch&#x27;s theorem for further details.

==In special relativity==
A moving wave surface in special relativity may be regarded as a hypersurface (a 3D subspace) in spacetime, formed by all the events passed by the wave surface. A wavetrain (denoted by some variable ) can be regarded as a one-parameter family of such hypersurfaces in spacetime. This variable is a scalar function of position in spacetime. The derivative of this scalar is a vector that characterizes the wave, the four-wavevector.

The four-wavevector is a wave four-vector that is defined, in Minkowski coordinates, as:

:formula_10

where the angular frequency formula_11 is the temporal component, and the wavenumber vector formula_12 is the spatial component.

Alternately, the wavenumber can be written as the angular frequency divided by the phase-velocity , or in terms of inverse period and inverse wavelength .

When written out explicitly its contravariant and covariant forms are: 
:formula_13

In general, the Lorentz scalar magnitude of the wave four-vector is:

:formula_14

The four-wavevector is null for massless (photonic) particles, where the rest mass formula_15

An example of a null four-wavevector would be a beam of coherent, monochromatic light, which has phase-velocity formula_16

:formula_17 {for light-like/null}

which would have the following relation between the frequency and the magnitude of the spatial part of the four-wavevector:

:formula_18 {for light-like/null}

The four-wavevector is related to the four-momentum as follows:
:formula_19

The four-wavevector is related to the four-frequency as follows:
:formula_20

The four-wavevector is related to the four-velocity as follows:
:formula_21

===Lorentz transformation===
Taking the Lorentz transformation of the four-wavevector is one way to derive the relativistic Doppler effect. The Lorentz matrix is defined as
:formula_22

In the situation where light is being emitted by a fast moving source and one would like to know the frequency of light detected in an earth (lab) frame, we would apply the Lorentz transformation as follows. Note that the source is in a frame and earth is in the observing frame, .
Applying the Lorentz transformation to the wave vector
:formula_23

and choosing just to look at the formula_24 component results in
:formula_25

where formula_26 is the direction cosine of formula_27 with respect to formula_28

So

====Source moving away (redshift)====
As an example, to apply this to a situation where the source is moving directly away from the observer (formula_29), this becomes:
:formula_30

====Source moving towards (blueshift)====
To apply this to a situation where the source is moving straight towards the observer (), this becomes:

:formula_31

====Source moving tangentially (transverse Doppler effect)====
To apply this to a situation where the source is moving transversely with respect to the observer (), this becomes:
:formula_32

<text>Rebecca Lucile Schaeffer (November 6, 1967 – July 18, 1989) was an American actress and model. She began her career as a teen model before moving on to acting. In 1986, she landed the role of Patricia &quot;Patti&quot; Russell in the CBS comedy &quot;My Sister Sam&quot;. The series was canceled in 1988, and she appeared in several films, including the black comedy &quot;Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills.&quot; At the age of 21, she was shot and killed by Robert John Bardo, a 19-year-old obsessed fan who had been stalking her. Schaeffer&#x27;s death helped lead to the passage in California of legislation aimed at preventing stalking.

==Early life==
Schaeffer was born November 6, 1967, in Eugene, Oregon, the only child of Danna (née Wilner), a writer and instructor who taught at Willamette University and Portland Community College, and Dr. Benson Schaeffer, a child psychologist. Schaeffer was raised in Portland, where she attended Lincoln High School. She was raised Jewish and initially aspired to become a rabbi, but she began modelling during her junior year in high school. She appeared in department store catalogues and television commercials, and as an extra in a television film. In 1984, when she was 16, she worked a summer in New York City with Elite Model Management and with her parents&#x27; permission stayed in the city to pursue modelling.

==Career==
While working in New York, Schaeffer attended Professional Children&#x27;s School. She also had a short-term role on the daytime soap opera &quot;Guiding Light&quot;.

In late 1984, Schaeffer landed the role of Annie Barnes on ABC&#x27;s &quot;One Life to Live&quot; for a stint that lasted six months. During this time, she attempted to further her modeling prospects. At , she was considered too short for high-fashion modeling and struggled to find work. In 1985, she moved to Japan in hopes of finding more modeling jobs, but still encountered difficulty due to her height and weight. She returned to New York City and decided to focus on an acting career.

In 1986, Schaeffer won a small role in Woody Allen&#x27;s comedy &quot;Radio Days&quot;, but her character was edited out except for one brief scene. She continued modeling and also worked as a waitress. She appeared on the cover of &quot;Seventeen&quot; magazine, which caught the attention of television producers who were casting for the comedy &quot;My Sister Sam&quot; starring Pam Dawber. Schaeffer won the role of Patricia &quot;Patti&quot; Russell, a teenager who moves from Oregon to San Francisco to live with her 29-year-old sister Samantha (&quot;Sam&quot;) after the death of their parents. Schaeffer lived with co-star Pam Dawber during her work on the series. &quot;My Sister Sam&quot; was initially a hit, ranking in the top 25, but it was canceled halfway through its second season in April 1988 due to falling ratings. 

After &quot;My Sister Sam&quot;, Schaeffer had supporting roles in &quot;Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills&quot;, &quot;Voyage of Terror: The Achille Lauro Affair&quot;, &quot;The End of Innocence&quot;, and the television film &quot;Out of Time&quot;. She also served as a spokesperson for the children&#x27;s charity Thursday&#x27;s Child.

==Murder==
On July 18, 1989, 19-year-old fan Robert John Bardo shot and killed Schaeffer at her home in West Hollywood. At the time of her death, she had been stalked by Bardo for three years. He had previously been obsessed with child peace activist Samantha Smith, who died in a plane crash in 1985. He then wrote numerous letters to Schaeffer, one of which she answered. In 1987, he traveled to Los Angeles hoping to meet with Schaeffer on the set of &quot;My Sister Sam&quot;, but Warner Bros. security turned him away. He returned a month later armed with a knife, but security guards again prevented him from gaining access. He returned to his native Tucson, Arizona, and lost focus on Schaeffer for a while as his obsession shifted towards pop singers Tiffany, Debbie Gibson, and Madonna.

Bardo watched Schaeffer in the black comedy film, &quot;Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills&quot; in 1989, in which she appeared in bed with another actor. He became enraged by the scene, apparently out of jealousy, and decided that Schaeffer should be punished for &quot;becoming another Hollywood whore&quot;. Arthur Richard Jackson had stalked and stabbed actress Theresa Saldana in 1982, and Bardo learned that Jackson had used a private investigator to obtain Saldana&#x27;s address. Bardo then paid a detective agency in Tucson $250 to find Schaeffer&#x27;s home address in California&#x27;s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) records. His brother helped him get a Ruger GP100 .357 handgun.

Bardo traveled to Los Angeles a third time and roamed the neighborhood where Schaeffer lived, asking people if she actually lived there. Once he was certain that the address was correct, he rang the doorbell. Schaeffer was preparing for an audition for &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; and was expecting a script to be delivered, so she answered the door. Bardo showed her a letter and autograph that she had previously sent him; after a short conversation, she asked him not to come to her home again. He went to a diner nearby and had breakfast, then returned to her apartment an hour later. She answered the door with &quot;a cold look on her face&quot;, Bardo later said. He pulled out the handgun and shot her in the chest at point-blank range in the doorway of her apartment building; according to Bardo, she said &quot;Ouch&quot; and fell and said only, &quot;Why? Why?&quot; Schaeffer was rushed to the emergency room of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead 30 minutes after her arrival. She was buried at Ahavai Sholom Cemetery in Portland, Oregon.

== Aftermath ==

Tucson Police Chief Peter Ronstadt arrested Bardo the next day after motorists reported a man running through traffic on Interstate 10. He immediately confessed to the murder. Marcia Clark, later known for her role as lead prosecutor in the O. J. Simpson murder case, prosecuted the case against him. Bardo was convicted of first-degree aggravated murder in a bench trial and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. As a result of this incident, federal law regarding the release of personal information through the DMV was changed. The Driver&#x27;s Privacy Protection Act, which prevents the DMV from releasing private addresses, was enacted in 1994. Schaeffer&#x27;s death also helped prompt the 1990 passing of America&#x27;s first anti-stalking laws, including California Penal Code 646.9.

At the time of her death, Schaeffer was dating director Brad Silberling. Her death influenced his film &quot;Moonlight Mile&quot; (2002) about a man&#x27;s grief after his fiancée is murdered. Shortly after Schaeffer&#x27;s death, Pam Dawber and her &quot;My Sister Sam&quot; co-stars Joel Brooks, David Naughton, and Jenny O&#x27;Hara filmed a public service announcement for the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence in her honor.

<text>Melt-Banana is a Japanese noise rock band that is known for playing extremely fast noise rock and hardcore punk mixed with experimental, electronica and pop-based song structures. Since forming in 1992 the band has released ten albums and toured worldwide extensively.
== History ==
In 1991, while attending Tokyo University of Foreign Studies, Yasuko Onuki started a band called Mizu and, after a short period rehearsing with another guitarist, recruited Ichiro Agata to play guitar in the band. Mizu&#x27;s original drummer and bass player quit six months after Agata joined, leaving Yasuko to handle the bass and vocal duties until she found bassist Rika. They briefly performed shows around Tokyo without a drummer. Sudoh Toshiaki then joined as the new drummer in November 1992, and they changed their name to Melt-Banana.

In May 1993, Melt-Banana played a show opening for KK Null of Zeni Geva fame, who was impressed enough to immediately offer them a deal with his label, and would later introduce them to Mark Fischer of Skin Graft Records and Steve Albini.

In 1996, &quot;Sick Zip Everywhere&quot; was nominated for MTV UK&#x27;s best video. In the same year the band completed their first European tour.

In 1997, they created their own recording company, A-Zap (formerly Iguana Coax), and re-issued most of their early albums. Around this time, drummer Sudoh Toshiaki quit. Oshima Watchma became the new official drummer in February 1998.

The band recorded its first Peel Session in September 1999. Onuki thought John Peel looked like Santa Claus; Agata has said that when finishing a new song, he still thinks of Peel and what he would think of it if he listened. Peel described the session as &quot;Simply one of the most extraordinary performances I have ever seen and ever heard ... just mesmerizing, absolutely astonishing.&quot; The broadcast exposed the band to new audiences in the United Kingdom and beyond.

Watchma left the band in 2000, and since then the band has had different drummers on their tours and albums.

In 2007, Melt-Banana recorded the song &quot;Hair-Cat (Cause the Wolf Is a Cat!)&quot; for &quot;Perfect Hair Forever&quot; on Cartoon Network&#x27;s Adult Swim lineup.

The studio album &quot;Fetch&quot;, released September 2013, saw the band transition to a duo. The decision not to use a live drummer led on to the decision not to have a live bass player. Using a computer for the rhythm allowed more freedom in the arrangement. Hamamoto&#x27;s help was not needed for the new duo format. Additionally, throughout the band&#x27;s career Agata and Onuki had been the main songwriters.

In late 2019, during an interview conducted on tour, with &quot;Louder&quot; magazine, the band stated they would record a new album. A new studio album titled &quot;3+5&quot; was announced on May 23, 2024 and released on August 23, 2024.

== Style ==

Melt-Banana&#x27;s music is typically described as noise rock, with roots in punk, grindcore, electro-pop and electronic music. The band has shied away from any classification, saying they &quot;don&#x27;t write music according to genre&quot;, and has described their music as &quot;like a chimera&quot;. Melt-Banana has cited The Sex Pistols, Einstürzende Neubauten, Masonna, Violent Onsen Geisha, Aphex Twin and Atari Teenage Riot as influences, as well as the compilation album &quot;No New York&quot;. Agata also gets inspiration from the feelings of excitement, triumph and peril he experiences when playing video games, and interpreting that musically. He believes that influences from outside music, including video games, help them see from fresh angles and keep them from writing &quot;the same kind of music again and again&quot;. Games he has cited as an inspiration include &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 3&quot;, &quot;Ecco the Dolphin&quot;, &quot;Demon&#x27;s Souls&quot; and &quot;Shadow of the Colossus&quot;.

Onuki&#x27;s distinctive vocal style has been described as &quot;loud, piercing and unexpectedly authoritative&quot;. Asked about her influences, Onuki explained: &quot;there is no tradition and no influence besides maybe Lydia Lunch and the Teenage Jerks. She opened a new book for me. It was so unique and distinctive, you could tell by listening to the voice who is singing – that what I wanted to achieve with my own voice too.&quot;

Although the band is Japanese, their lyrics are written in English. Onuki originally sung in Japanese, but quickly changed to English, believing that it was better suited to her style of singing. Because English is not her native language, Onuki often has to look words up in dictionaries, which also allows her to find words that sound interesting to her. In writing a song, Onuki typically starts with particular words and then works backwards, the content of which comes from what she &quot;see[s] and feel[s] in [her] usual life&quot;.

Agata is noted for his distinct style of guitar playing that involves heavy use of effects and pedals.

The band is known for playing an &quot;eclectic&quot; selection of cover songs, both live and on studio recordings. Melt-Banana was inspired to do so after touring with Mr. Bungle and seeing them perform several cover songs, and thinking it would be fun for both the audience and the band themselves. Songs that Melt-Banana has covered include &quot;Surfin&#x27; U.S.A.&quot; (The Beach Boys), &quot;Neat Neat Neat&quot; (The Damned) and &quot;Paint It Black&quot; (The Rolling Stones). In choosing the songs, Melt-Banana simply &quot;play songs that [they] like.&quot;

===Timeline===

<doc id="686060" wikidata="Q156717" url="?curid=686060" title="Khmelnytskyi">
<text>Khmelnytskyi (, ) is a city in western Ukraine. Located on the Southern Bug, it serves as the administrative centre of Khmelnytskyi Oblast as well as Khmelnytskyi Raion within the oblast. With a population of Khmelnytskyi is the second-largest city in the historical region of Podolia, after Vinnytsia.

The city was first mentioned in 1431 as a Polish military post, where it was known as &quot;Płoskirów&quot; under Polish rule. It was seized by Cossacks during the Khmelnytsky Uprising and later ruled by the Ottomans until 1699. It was passed to Russia in 1793, as a result of the Second Partition of Poland, and became part of the newly-formed Podolia Governorate, where it became known as &quot;Proskuriv&quot; or &quot;Proskurov&quot;. From 1917 to 1920, it was controlled by the short-lived Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic before becoming part of Soviet Ukraine. The city&#x27;s Jewish population fell from 42 per cent in 1939 to 10 per cent in 1959 as a result of the Holocaust in Ukraine. In 1954, it was renamed &quot;Khmelnytskyi&quot; in honor of the Cossack leader Bohdan Khmelnytsky.

Khmelnytskyi is the location of a rail junction and an important industrial centre, as well as a centre for higher education such as the Khmelnytskyi National University and the Khmelnytskyi Oblast Ukrainian Music and Drama Theater.

== Names ==
Khmelnytskyi had several names throughout history. In the oldest written evidence about this settlement, the name of the city was mentioned as &quot;Ploskirowce&quot;, while later documents mentioned its name as &quot;Płoskirów&quot;, which probably comes from the name of the Ploska River.

In 1793, the city was renamed &quot;Proskurov&quot;, which appeared on the decree to create Podolia Governorate. This toponym is very similar to the name &quot;proskura&quot;, which is a bread in the liturgical service.

On 16 January 1954, Proskuriv was renamed to Khmelnytskyi in honor of Bohdan Khmelnytsky, the Cossack hetman who rebelled against the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

==History==

The city foundation date is uncertain. The territory where Khmelnytskyi is situated has been inhabited for a very long time. Many archaeological discoveries have been made in the city suburbs. For example, to the East of Lezneve district, there was a settlement from the Bronze Age 2000 B.C., and from Scythian times from 7–3 century B.C. The first mention of the city was written with Cyrillic alphabet. The earliest known mention in historical sources was in 1431, when it was known as &quot;Płoskirów&quot; (&quot;Ploskirov&quot;, &quot;Плоскиров&quot;) and was part of the Kingdom of Poland. It was a royal city.

Polish rule was briefly interrupted by the Ottomans between 1672 and 1699. During this period, it was a subdivision of Mejibuji sanjak in Podolia Eyalet as &quot;Poloskiruf&quot;. After the Second Partition of Poland in 1793, the city was annexed by the Russian Empire and was renamed &quot;Proskurov&quot; (). According to the Russian census of 1897, Proskurov with a population of 22,855 was the fifth largest city of Podolia after Kamianets-Podilskyi, Uman, Vinnytsia and Balta. In 1920 it became part of Soviet Ukraine. In 1954 the city was finally renamed &quot;Khmelnytskyi&quot; (Хмельницький) in the honor of the 300th anniversary of a treaty negotiated by Bohdan Khmelnytsky.

After new archival sources presented at the 2006 conference City of Khmelnytskyi in the Context of Ukrainian History post-dated the city’s earliest mention from 1493 to 1431, it changed its official 513th anniversary commemoration to its 575th.

===Pogroms===
A series of anti-Jewish pogroms have been carried out in the region, known together as the Proskurov pogrom. According to Vinnytsia&#x27;s city archives, the pogrom was conducted on the Friday night of February 15, 1919, by one of the otamans (generals) of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Army, Otaman Semysenko (also rendered as Semesenko). Estimates vary as to the number of victims, some putting the death toll at 1,500 Jews in Proskurov alone, with 600 more killed in nearby Filshtein.

The Chief Otaman Petliura had been appointed head of state just two days prior to the tragedy, on February the 13th. Petliura issued Order 131 in which he mentioned the fact that numerous Jewish parties in Ukraine (Bund, Poale Zion, Folks-Partei, Unificationists) rose to defend the sovereignty of the Ukrainian Republic and were cooperating with the Ukrainian government. He condemned such pogroms, calling those initiating them deserters and enemies of the State that must be liquidated. The order was co-signed by the Chief of Staff, Otaman Yunakiv. The order was published in the &quot;Ukraina&quot; newspaper on February 20 (March 4, old style). Later, Petliura issued a special order to execute Semysenko for being the pogrom initiator. According to sources the order was carried out on March 20, 1920. Other sources claim that he was released.

During the Schwartzbard trial, at the end of which Petliura&#x27;s assassin was pardoned on the grounds of self-trail (revenge), the main argument of the defense was that Schwartzbard had acted as an avenger of the Jews killed in pogroms perpetrated during Petliura&#x27;s rule.

===World War II===

The town was occupied by the German Army from July 8, 1941 to March 25, 1944. On November 4, 1941, 5300 Jewish inhabitants of the town and surrounding villages were shot by an Einsatzgruppe. A ghetto was formed on December 14, 1941, where all surviving Jewish inhabitants had to resettle and were subjected to forced labor. They were subsequently killed in the fall of 1942. More than 9500 Jews were killed in the town in total.

===Cold War===
Khmelnytskyi was home to the 19th Division of the 43rd Rocket Army of the Soviet Strategic Rocket Forces during the Cold War. The intercontinental ballistic missile silos of the division that were housed there were removed and destroyed, partially with U.S. Cooperative Threat Reduction funding, during the 1990s.
===Russo-Ukrainian War===
Until 18 July 2020, Khmelnytskyi was incorporated as a city of oblast significance and served as the administrative center of Khmelnytskyi Raion though it did not belong to the raion. In July 2020, as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Khmelnytskyi Oblast to three, the city of Khmelnytskyi was merged into Khmelnytskyi Raion.

====Russian invasion of Ukraine====
On 10 October 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the city was targeted by Russian cruise missiles as part of a major retaliation strike for the Crimean Bridge explosion, causing a blackout in the city and limiting water supply.

During a missile attack on 31 December, a gas station and a military facility inside the city was hit by two Russian cruise missiles, killing at least one civilian and wounding nine. The attack also caused a partial blackout and damaged more than a dozen cars and several residential buildings, including a kindergarten.

On 23 February 2023, Russian forces hit Khmelnytskyi with 3 Iranian-made UAVs of the &quot;Shahed type&quot;, killing one person and wounding four. Additionally, the attack caused a fire and damaged multiple buildings.

Its plot follows Nino Brown, a drug lord in New York City during the crack epidemic, and Scotty Appleton, an NYPD detective who vows to end Nino&#x27;s rise to power by going undercover to work for Nino&#x27;s gang.

&quot;New Jack City&quot; premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 17, 1991, and was released in the United States by Warner Bros. Pictures on March 8, 1991.

==Plot==
In the New York City neighborhood of Harlem, Nino Brown and his gang, the Cash Money Brothers (CMB), become the dominant drug ring once crack cocaine is introduced to the streets. His gang consists of Gerald &quot;Gee Money&quot; Wells, his best friend since childhood; enforcer and personal bodyguard Duh Duh Duh Man; gun moll Keisha; Nino&#x27;s girlfriend, Selina Thomas; and her tech-savvy cousin, ex-bank teller Kareem Akbar.

Nino converts the Carter apartment complex into a crack house. Gee Money and Keisha kill rival Fat Smitty, and the CMB forces out the tenants and landlord. Meanwhile, Scotty Appleton, an undercover police detective working with the NYPD, attempts to make a deal with stick-up kid Pookie, who absconds with the money. Appleton chases and shoots Pookie in the leg, but released on bail. As the years pass, Nino&#x27;s gang successfully run the streets of Harlem with absolute power.

When Stone, the leader of the CMB police operation, comes under pressure from NYPD Commissioner Fred R. Price, Appleton, currently on suspension for shooting Pookie, volunteers to infiltrate Nino&#x27;s gang and is partnered with loose-cannon Nick Peretti. Elsewhere, mobster and tax collector Frankie Needles attempts to get protection money from Nino, who refuses to pay. While Appleton and Peretti observe Nino and his gang handing out Thanksgiving turkeys to the poor, Appleton spots Pookie, now a crack addict, and soon gets him into rehab.

Later, Pookie offers to help bring down Nino. Against his better judgment and the disapproval of Stone and Peretti, Appleton recruits Pookie as an informant. When Pookie relapses, Gee Money realizes that he is wired and orders the Carter destroyed. The cops find Pookie&#x27;s booby-trapped corpse; Peretti defuses the explosives seconds before it explodes. Nino angrily warns Gee Money against repeating such a costly mistake.

After Pookie&#x27;s funeral, Appleton and Peretti, no longer needed by Stone, go undercover as drug dealers. After bribing Frankie, Appleton infiltrates the CMB, partly due to Gee Money&#x27;s increasing ambition and drug use. Though Nino distrusts them, he agrees to do business. After relating an anecdote about his own violent initiation into a gang in 1974, Nino warns that he will kill both Appleton and Gee Money if any problems occur. Appleton gains Nino&#x27;s trust when he reveals information about Gee Money&#x27;s side deal and saves him from a gun-toting &quot;Old Man&quot; who had earlier appealed to police for help against Nino.

While Nino, Appleton, and the CMB attend a wedding, Peretti sneaks into Nino&#x27;s mansion to collect evidence. Don Armeteo, Frankie&#x27;s boss, sends mobsters to kill Nino, and a massive shootout erupts. When Nino uses a child as a shield, Appleton attempts to shoot Nino in the back; Keisha is killed. Later, Nino throws Selina out when she condemns his nature, before killing Don Armeteo and his crew single-handedly.

Stone, Appleton and Peretti arrange a sting operation to nab Nino. Kareem, aware of Appleton and Pookie&#x27;s connection, exposes Appleton, and a shootout ensues. Peretti saves Appleton by killing the Duh Duh Duh Man, and Nino escapes. That night, Nino confronts and regretfully kills Gee Money. After the gang&#x27;s collapse, Nino holes up in an apartment and continues his criminal empire solo. Appleton, Peretti, and the police assault the complex, where Appleton brutally beats Nino, revealing that it was his mother whom Nino killed in his gang initiation. Peretti dissuades Appleton from killing Nino, who is taken into custody.

At his trial, Nino pleads guilty to a lesser charge, claims to have been forced to help the gang due to threats, and identifies Kareem as the leader. He is sentenced to only a year in jail. As Nino speaks with reporters outside the courtroom, the Old Man confronts and fatally shoots him in the chest, causing Nino to fall over a balcony to his death. Appleton and Peretti leave satisfied as onlookers look down at Nino&#x27;s dead body.

In the closing moments, an epilogue states that the crack epidemic is still ongoing and decisive action must be taken to stop real-life Nino Brown analogs.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film is based upon an original story and screenplay written by Thomas Lee Wright, who had worked as a story editor at The Walt Disney Company and Columbia Pictures before moving to creative executive at Paramount Pictures. According to Carl Hart, who corresponded with Wright following Hart&#x27;s criticism of &quot;New Jack City&quot;, the screenplay was originally written as &quot;The Godfather: Part III&quot;, and featured a protagonist who sold heroin rather than cocaine. Wright wrote a treatment for Paramount on the idea, which they liked enough to have him try to do a first draft. Wright based his script to interviews he had with people from Little Italy in New York along with the story of Nicky Barnes, the black kingpin that had modeled his criminal organization in Harlem after the Mafia. Wright later wrote, directed and produced &quot;Eight Tray Gangster: The Making of a Crip,&quot; a documentary of gang life in South Central Los Angeles.

The screenplay was co-written by Barry Michael Cooper, a former investigative reporter with the &quot;Village Voice&quot; who would later write the screenplays for the 1994 dramatic films &quot;Above the Rim&quot; and &quot;Sugar Hill&quot;, the latter of which also starred Snipes. Cooper&#x27;s rewrite was adapted from his December 1987 &quot;Village Voice&quot; cover story entitled &quot;Kids Killing Kids: New Jack City Eats Its Young,&quot; about the drug war in Detroit. The account referred to the 20th anniversary of the 1967 riots in Detroit, and in its wake, the rise of crack cocaine gangs in the late 1980s, such as Young Boys Inc., and the Chambers Brothers. The original story received notice from Quincy Jones, who sought a meeting with Cooper. He was then tasked with re-writes on a screenplay that had been done about the life of Nicky Barnes.

Filming occurred in New York City between April 16 and June 6, 1990.

==Reception==
&quot;New Jack City&quot; was favorably received by film critics for its cast, storyline, and soundtrack. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three and a half stars out of four, writing:

&quot;Time Out London&quot; described the film as &quot;a superior example of what used to be called blaxploitation.&quot;

The film initially premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 17, 1991, before being released nationally on March 8, 1991. The film, produced with an estimated $8,000,000 budget, grossed $7,039,622 during its opening weekend. It became the highest-grossing independent film of 1991, grossing a total of $47,624,253 domestically. The film holds an 81% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 36 reviews, with an average rating of 6.7 out of 10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Stylishly directed by Mario Van Peebles, &quot;New Jack City&quot; offsets its melodramatic streak with electrifying action and a cavalcade of effective performances.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

<doc id="686069" wikidata="Q1892770" url="?curid=686069" title="North Wales">
<text>North Wales () is a region of Wales, encompassing its northernmost areas. It borders mid Wales to the south, England to the east, and the Irish Sea to the north and west. The area is highly mountainous and rural, with Snowdonia National Park ( and the Clwydian Range and Dee Valley (), known for its mountains, waterfalls and trails, wholly within the region. Its population is concentrated in the north-east and northern coastal areas, with significant Welsh-speaking populations in its western and rural areas. North Wales is imprecisely defined, lacking any exact definition or administrative structure. It is commonly defined administratively as its six most northern principal areas, but other definitions exist, with Montgomeryshire historically considered to be part of the region.

Those from North Wales are sometimes referred to as &quot;Gogs&quot; (from &quot;Gogledd&quot; – the Welsh word for &quot;north&quot;); in comparison, those from South Wales are sometimes called &quot;Hwntws&quot; by those from North Wales.

The region includes the localities of Wrexham, Deeside, Rhyl, Colwyn Bay, Flint, Bangor, Llandudno, and Holyhead. The largest localities in North Wales are the city of Wrexham and the conurbations of Deeside and Rhyl/Prestatyn, where the main retail, cultural, educational, tourism, and transport infrastructure and services of North Wales are located. Bangor and St Asaph are the region&#x27;s cities, Bangor is Wales&#x27; oldest city, whereas St Asaph is one of Wales&#x27; smallest and was awarded status in 2012. Wrexham, the region&#x27;s largest settlement, became a city in 2022.

==History==
Historically, for most of North Wales, the region can be referred to as simply &quot;Gwynedd&quot;, named after one of the last independent Welsh kingdoms, the Kingdom of Gwynedd. This has led to a stronger sense of Welsh identity and home to more Welsh-language speakers, especially in North West Wales, than the rest of Wales. The term &quot;North Wales&quot; is rarely applied to all of Wales during the Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain and the period of the Heptarchy, to distinguish it from &quot;West Wales&quot;, known today as Cornwall, although the term &quot;Wales&quot; or the names of the various petty kingdoms of Wales (&quot;Gwynedd, and Powys&quot; in North Wales) are more commonly used to depict the region during this time.

The region is steeped in history, being a crucial component in Welsh medieval history, and was from the 5th to the 12th/13th centuries under the control of the influential Welsh kingdoms of Gwynedd, and Powys following the end of Roman rule in Britain. The Kingdom of Gwynedd controlled the majority of what is now the commonly defined 6 counties of North Wales, including all of the North Wales coast, with Powys retaining control over what is modern Powys, and parts of Wrexham and Flintshire, in addition to part of Shropshire. Through their over 800 year existences&#x27;, their rulers acclaimed themselves to be the &quot;King(s) of the Britons&quot;, and Gwynedd would lead the charge in the subsequent formation of the Principality of Wales. The mountainous stronghold of Snowdonia formed the nucleus of that realm and would become the last redoubt of independent Medieval Wales — only overcome in 1283 by English forces under Edward I. To this day it remains a stronghold of the Welsh language and a centre for Welsh national and cultural identity.

===World Heritage &amp; Biosphere Sites===
The area is home to three of the four UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Wales. These are Pontcysyllte Aqueduct and Canal, the Slate Landscape of Northwest Wales and, collectively, the Edwardian castles and town walls of the region which comprise those at Caernarfon, Beaumaris, Conwy and Harlech. It also shares with Powys and Ceredigion the distinction of hosting the only UNESCO Biosphere (from Man and Biosphere (MAB) Programme to promote sustainable development) reserve in Wales, namely, Biosffer Dyfi Biosphere. London has only one more site than North Wales.

== Definition ==
The boundaries and status of North Wales are undefined (compared to regions of England), definitions, and the boundary of North Wales with South or Mid Wales differs between organisations. It is strongly used culturally for comparison to the more urban South Wales. The most common definition for statistical and administrative purposes of North Wales contains the 6 principal areas of: Isle of Anglesey, Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire, Gwynedd, and Wrexham. Of which have a combined estimated population in 2018 of 698,400 people. Under this definition, the area borders the principal areas of Ceredigion, Powys, and the rest of Wales to the south, England and its counties of Shropshire, and Cheshire to the east, and the Irish sea to the north and west. Other definitions, especially historical, commonly include Montgomeryshire, one of the historic counties of Wales, to be part of North Wales, although as part of Powys its more commonly considered Mid Wales today. The definitions of North and Mid Wales constantly overlap, with Meirionnydd (southern part of the modern principal area of Gwynedd) sometimes considered Mid Wales. 

=== Capitalisation ===

North Wales may also be spelled as &#x27;north Wales&#x27; with a lower case &#x27;n&#x27; for north, coined as the &quot;to cap or not to cap&quot; debate. It is argued that using a lower case &#x27;n&#x27; is to be only used to signify &quot;north&quot; as merely a geographic identifier, and a capital &#x27;N&#x27; to distinctly separate the region for cultural, organisational, or statistical purposes from the rest of Wales. Such usage may follow ideological lines, with North Wales used to confer the region as a distinctly separate entity from the rest of Wales, whilst north Wales as merely the northern bit of Wales. Organisations, where the region is administered the same as with the rest of Wales, may prefer to use a lower case for north. Whilst organisations only operating in the region or separate from any others in the rest of Wales may use a capitalised N. Local newspapers, such as the Daily Post describe themselves to be a &quot;capper&quot; capitalising the &#x27;N&#x27;, whereas other organisations such as BBC News may use a lower case. The Welsh Government&#x27;s style guide uses lowercase, whereas Visit Wales uses capitalised. David Williams, chairman of the North Wales Business Club, announced his support for capping the term &quot;North&quot;, stating that North Wales should be a &quot;very recognisable region in our own right&quot;.

=== Principal areas ===
For local administration, the region is most commonly made up of the following six principal areas, consisting of counties, and county boroughs, they are: the Isle of Anglesey, Conwy County Borough, Denbighshire, Flintshire, Gwynedd, and Wrexham County Borough.

These principal areas are commonly divided into two groups, used for local news (e.g. BBC), regional tourism boards, town and country planning, and were the proposed replacements to the existing 6 principal areas before proposals were scrapped in 2019. They are: North East Wales (Denbighshire, Flintshire, Wrexham), and North West Wales (Anglesey, Conwy, Gwynedd) being the two most popular groupings, although a North Central Wales (Conwy and Denbighshire) grouping has been occasionally used, specifically for health administration.

The population, density and areas are estimates for from the Office for National Statistics.
=== Historical divisions ===

In addition to the six principal areas, North Wales is also divided into the following preserved counties for various ceremonial purposes: Clwyd (comprising Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire and Wrexham), and Gwynedd (comprising Gwynedd and Isle of Anglesey) The preserved counties are based on the counties created by the Local Government Act 1972 and were used for local government purposes (with county councils) between 1974 and 1996. During this period up to the present, Montgomeryshire remained a part of Powys.

Prior to the preserved counties, there were counties, now referred to as historic counties. These are the oldest of the counties of North Wales, used for centuries. North Wales contained 6 historic counties during these times, the counties were; Anglesey, Caernarfonshire, Denbighshire, Flintshire, Merionethshire, and Montgomeryshire. The most notable difference between these six counties and the present six (seven with Montgomeryshire) is that Caernarfonshire and Merionethshire were combined into one principal area, initially called &#x27;Caernarfonshire and Merionethshire&#x27; until a day after its formation where it took the name Gwynedd instead, and the formation of two county boroughs, Conwy carved out of Caernarfonshire and Denbighshire, and Wrexham carved out of Denbighshire and Flintshire.

The north of Wales was traditionally divided into three regions during the middle ages: Upper Gwynedd (or Gwynedd above the Conwy), defined as the area north of the River Dyfi and west of the River Conwy; Lower Gwynedd (or Gwynedd below the Conwy), also known as the &quot;Perfeddwlad (&quot;the middle country&quot;)&quot; and defined as the region east of the River Conwy and west of the River Dee; and Ynys Môn (or Anglesey), a large island off the north coast. English Maelor, currently part of Wrexham County Borough, located east of the River Dee, as the name suggests, was part of England during a significant part of this period.

===Electoral divisions===
North Wales is electorally divided into constituencies and electoral wards to elect local representatives to multiple layers of government.

==== Parliamentary constituencies ====

There are eleven constituencies used for both the UK Parliament and the Senedd (Welsh Parliament; ): Aberconwy (, Alyn and Deeside (, Arfon (, Clwyd South (, Clwyd West (, Delyn (, Dwyfor Meironnydd (, Montgomeryshire (, Vale of Clwyd (, Wrexham (, and Ynys Môn (Anglesey, .

An electoral region for the Senedd, shares the name &quot;North Wales&quot;, yet does not cover all of North Wales, only the northern coast, Anglesey, and northeast of Wales (specifically the entire area of the former pre-1996 county of Clwyd); the rest of North Wales (mainly Meirionnydd) is covered by the Mid and West Wales Senedd electoral region. All constituencies aside Dwyfor Meironnydd, and Montgomeryshire are in the North Wales Senedd electoral region.

Between 1979 and 1994, all of North Wales (including Montgomery) was a single European Parliament constituency (EPC), the North Wales European Parliament Constituency. In 1994, minor border changes put parts of Montgomeryshire in the neighbouring Mid and West Wales constituency. In 1999, both of the constituencies ceased, when it was absorbed into the larger Wales constituency until 2020 when it was subsequently abolished following the United Kingdom&#x27;s withdrawal from the European Union on 31 January 2020.

=== Border to the south ===
The division with the rest of Wales is arbitrary and depends on the particular use being made. For example, the boundary of North Wales Police differs from the boundary of the North Wales area of the Natural Resources Wales and the North Wales Regional Transport Consortium (&quot;Taith&quot;). The historic boundary follows the pre-1996 county boundaries of Merionethshire and Denbighshire which in turn closely follow the geographic features of the River Dyfi to Aran Fawddwy, then crossing the high moorlands following the watershed until reaching Cadair Berwyn and then following the River Rhaeadr and River Tanat to the Shropshire border. The most common definition is that North Wales ends at the peripheries of the northern 6 principal areas, therefore the border is between Wrexham - Powys, Denbighshire - Powys, Gwynedd - Powys, and Gwynedd - Ceredigion (over the River Dyfi).

==Geography==
The area is mostly rural with many mountains and valleys. This, in combination with its coast (on the Irish Sea), means tourism is the principal industry. Farming, which was once the principal economic force in the area, is now much reduced in importance. The average income per capita of the local population is the lowest in the UK.

The eastern part of North Wales contains the most populous areas, with more than 300,000 people living in the areas around Wrexham and Deeside. Wrexham, with a population of 65,692 at the 2011 census in its built-up area, it is North Wales&#x27; largest city. The total population of North Wales is 696,300 (2017). The majority of other settlements are along the coast, including some popular resort towns, such as Rhyl, Llandudno, Pwllheli, Prestatyn and Tywyn. There are two cathedral citiesBangor and St. Asaphand a number of medieval castles (e.g. Criccieth, Dolbadarn, Dolwyddelan, Harlech, Caernarfon Castle, Beaumaris, Conwy) The area of North Wales is about 6,172 square kilometres, making it slightly larger than the country of Brunei, or the island of Bali.

The highest mountain in Wales is Snowdon (, in northwest Wales.

== Transport ==

=== Roads ===
North Wales does not have any motorways, with the only motorways in Wales being present in South Wales, and nearest motorways (M53 and M56) being on the other side of the Wales-England border. There have been proposals to upgrade the A55 into a motorway or have more motorway-like features. Trunk roads in the region are maintained by the North and Mid Wales Trunk Road Agent (NMWTRA).

The main roads spanning across North Wales, mostly span east to west, especially along the North Wales coast. This is mainly due to the mountainous terrain in the middle of Wales, leading most north-south connections to be slower, leading to diversions onto north-south roads in England. The emphasis on east-west roadways has led to North Wales having closer connections with North West England (centred on Liverpool and Manchester) rather than with South Wales.

The busiest road in North Wales is the A55, the &quot;North Wales Expressway&quot;, a dual carriageway primary road connecting Chester to Holyhead, along the North Wales coast and passing Deeside, Llandudno Junction, Conwy, and Bangor. It is described as the economic lifeline for North Wales, and the second most important road in all of Wales, only to the M4 in South Wales. The road connects all the way to the Port of Holyhead following an extension in 2001, which provides ferry connections to the Republic of Ireland. The majority of the road is part of the E-road network as E22 (until Ewloe, where it goes along the A494 into England), and is a dual carriageway, grade-separated, for its entire 88-mile length.

A historically important road in the region is the A5, a major road that was the primary link between the region and London (as the &quot;London-Holyhead Trunk Road&quot;). The road crosses the Menai Suspension Bridge and is regarded as a more scenic route, with its historical importance as a connection between London and the Port of Holyhead, superseded by the A55. Other roads transiting North Wales, from east to west include the A458 from Halesowen to Mallwyd, and the A494 from Dolgellau to Saughall (originally to Birkenhead).

The busiest north-south road travelling through the region is the A483 from Chester (originally from Manchester) through Wrexham and into England near Oswestry, before re-entering Montgomeryshire and passing Welshpool and Newtown, before continuing onto Swansea. Other major north-south roads include the single-carriageways of the A470 from Llandudno to Cardiff via the Conwy valley, and the A487 from Bangor to Haverfordwest via Caernarfon and Snowdonia.

=== Sea ===

The Port of Holyhead, on the isle of Anglesey, is the main commercial and ferry port in North Wales. The port had the third-largest volume of freight traffic, in Wales, in 2018 (5.2 million tonnes), after Milford Haven and Port Talbot, and it is the main port for freight and sea passenger transport with the Republic of Ireland, handling more than 2 million passengers each year. 81% of freight traffic going through Welsh ports to the Republic of Ireland, and 75.5% of sea passenger traffic between Wales and the Republic of Ireland went through Holyhead in 2018. Historically, there were two routes between Holyhead and the Irish ports of Dublin and Dun Laoghaire. The route to Dun Laoghaire was the most popular in 1998 with over 1.7 million passengers ferried, however following a consistent decline in passenger traffic, it was removed in 2015. The other route to Dublin saw an overall increase in passenger numbers from just over 1 million in 1998 to just over 1.9 million in 2018, an increase of 82%. 

A Mostyn-Dublin ferry service once existed, on the now Liverpool-Dublin route, attracting a peak of 48,000 passengers in 2003, before being discontinued in 2004.

===Rail===

The public rail network of the region is largely split into two sections. These sections are centred around the two main west-east railway lines transversing the region, as there are currently no north-south railway lines wholly in the region. This is largely due to the mountainous regions of Snowdonia resting between the two lines, and low passenger numbers of north-south lines leading to their closure. The public rail network is managed and maintained by Network Rail. Historically, the region had a more extensive rail network with more interconnectivity of the current lines and more connections to the south. However, due to falling passenger numbers, the emergence of automobiles and other factors, the region&#x27;s railways came under review, resulting in the Beeching cuts to the network. Many former rail corridors of the once more extensive network were superseded by road infrastructure. The numerous heritage railways scattered across the region serve as a reminder of the former railways across the region.

The majority of lines operated in Wales are part of the Wales &amp; Borders franchise, the current operator is Transport for Wales Rail, a Welsh-Government owned company, although some services (from Holyhead and Wrexham) are operated by the West Coast Partnership operator, Avanti West Coast on services using the West Coast Main Line to London Euston.

According to StatsWales, the number of rail journeys across the 6 principal areas of North Wales, made in 2017-18 was 1.4 million, an increase of 20,525 from 2007-8. The largest share of these rail journeys, at 38.4%, was within the boundaries of Gwynedd. Conwy was the principal area which saw the greatest increase in rail journeys as a percentage of journeys over the ten-year period, at 22.5%. The least amount of rail journeys in 2018-19 was in Anglesey.

As of 2025, there as 66 rail stations within the boundaries of the 6 northern principal areas, of which 2 are among the 20 busiest stations in Wales, Rhyl, and Bangor. 41 of the rail stations are stations of the North Wales lines, whereas the remaining 25 are stations of the Mid Wales lines, specifically the Cambrian Line. There is a total of 5 rail routes in North Wales: the North Wales Coast Line, the Shrewsbury—Chester Line, the Conwy Valley Line, the Borderlands Line (all part of the North Wales lines) and the Cambrian Line. All 5 routes together in 2023-24 had approximately 5,657,746 entries and exits through the 66 stations.



The North Wales Coast Line, the main rail line serving the north Wales coast, and connecting with Irish Ferries and Stena Line ferry services to Dublin Port in the Republic of Ireland. The Conwy Valley Line branches off at Llandudno Junction, heading north to Llandudno and south to Blaenau Ffestiniog. The Shrewsbury—Chester line, connects Chester and Shrewsbury via Wrexham, providing the main north Wales and south Wales connection. A former open-access operator Wrexham &amp; Shropshire, used to provide a Wrexham General—London Marylebone service until 2011. The Borderlands Line, intersects the Shrewsbury—Chester line at Wrexham General, branching south to Wrexham Central (where it terminates), and north to Bidston (Birkenhead), and the North Wales Coast Line at Shotton. Bidston connects to the Wirral line, providing Merseyrail services, west to West Kirby, and east to Liverpool Central. The Cambrian Line forms the other west-east line in the region (as the Mid-Wales line), it connects Shrewsbury, westwards with Mid Wales and towns along Cardigan Bay. The line is commonly split into two sections, the section from Shrewsbury to Aberystwyth is sometimes referred to as the Cambrian Main Line, with the Cambrian Coast Line, splitting off from this line at Dovey Junction, heading northwest to Pwllheli. The Welsh Marches Line connects Crewe to Newport, via Shrewsbury, with services from Holyhead usually continuing to Cardiff Central. It forms part of the North Wales South Wales service, along with the Shrewsbury—Chester, North Wales Coast Line, and South Wales Main Line. These lines form the main rail connection between North Wales and South Wales.

Chester provides the main travel connections for the North Wales Coast, as a major transport hub. As part of the North Wales Metro, from Chester &quot;(and Wrexham General at limited times),&quot; via the Halton Curve, direct trains run to Liverpool Lime Street, linking to the Merseyrail. Services to Manchester Piccadilly from Chester, via the Chester—Manchester line for Transport for Wales services, and the Mid—Cheshire line for Northern services, in addition to the Northern service to Leeds, provide North Wales&#x27; connections to Northern England. Shrewsbury provides the main travel connections for passengers from the Cambrian line (and those commuting south from other North Wales stations), providing services, in addition to those to South Wales, through England to Crewe, Birmingham International, and Birmingham New Street, and via the Heart of Wales line, services to Llanelli.

==== Heritage and narrow gauge railway lines ====
There are numerous heritage railways in the region. Most of them are narrow-gauge. Several run on sections of historically longer lines. Heritage railways employ more than 300 people and generate over £50 million per year for the North Wales economy.

The heritage railways in the region are:

Several of these lines connect to the Cambrian line. Stations where the heritage railway uses the same station as Network Rail. At Fairbourne, the Fairbourne Railway connects to Barmouth Ferry and the Ffestiniog Railway connects at . The Talyllyn Railway&#x27;s station is a short walk from station on the Cambrian line, while on the Cambrian line is across town from on the Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway.

==== Future developments ====

Many rail and bus lines of the region are part of an improvement project called the North Wales Metro or North East Wales Metro, which proposes improvements to the existing lines (specifically the Borderlands lines), improved connectivity between rail and other modes of transport, and more connections to North West England.

For the Gobowen to Oswestry line, Cambrian Heritage Railways, the line&#x27;s operator, is working on reopening the line (multiple sections of line), and the Anglesey Central Railway is also proposed to be restored.

====Tramways====
In Llandudno, the Great Orme Tramway links to the Great Orme. It is the only remaining cable-operated street tramway in Great Britain, and one of only a few surviving in the world.

==Geology==

North Wales has very diverse and complex geology with Precambrian schists along the Menai Strait and the great Cambrian dome behind Harlech and underlying much of western Snowdonia. In the Ordovician period much volcanism deposited a range of minerals and rocks over the northwestern parts of Gwynedd whilst to the east of the River Conwy lies a large area of upland rolling hills underlain by the Silurian mudstones and grits comprising the Denbigh and Migneint Moors. To the east, around Llangollen, to the north on Halkyn Mountain and the Great Orme and in eastern Anglesey are beds of limestone from which metals have been mined since pre-Roman times. Added to all this are the complexities posed by Parys Mountain and the outcrops of unusual minerals such as Jasper and Mona Marble which make the area of special interest to geologists.

== Demographics ==
Terms for people from the region include; North Welsh, and North Walian (also spelt as North Walean), or informally as &quot;Gogs&quot; from the Welsh word for North, &quot;Gogledd&quot;. This term is mostly only used to distinguish from other parts of Wales (i.e. only used domestically in Wales), a majority of the population consider themselves as just &quot;Welsh&quot;, and some additionally or only as &quot;British&quot;. Communities along the Wales-England border and northern coast may identify as &quot;English&quot; as they are home to many of those of English ancestry.

=== Population ===
According to Statistics for Wales (StatsWales), the North Wales region, consists of the 6 northern principal areas, and statistics provided by StatsWales only include these 6 areas. In 2018, the estimated population of the region was 698,400 people. North Wales exhibits the evenest distribution of population across the local authorities of any of the 4 statistical regions of Wales, with 4 of the 6 authorities home to over 100,000 residents, Flintshire, Wrexham, Gwynedd and Conwy. Flintshire is the most populated principal area of North Wales, home to an estimated 155,600 people, with the Isle of Anglesey being the least populated with an estimated 70,000 people.

In 2018, North Wales has an estimated population density of 113.6 persons per square kilometre. Flintshire is the most densely populated of the 6 areas, at 355.6 persons per km2, with Gwynedd being the least dense principal area at 49.0 persons per km2. Between 2008, and 2018, the population density of North Wales grew by 2.3%, the third-highest rate of population density growth of the 4 statistical regions of Wales. Gwynedd, with 3.7% growth, had the highest population density growth rate in North Wales, whereas the Isle of Anglesey had the lowest population density growth rate at 0.1% from 2008 to 2018.

The population growth for the region between 1998 and 2018 was 6.3%, however, the rate was lower between 2008 and 2018, than in 1998 and 2008. Conwy was the area with the highest population growth rate for the two decades at 8%, with Isle of Anglesey having the smallest growth rate at just over 3%.

Population settlements

North Wales&#x27; largest settlement (locality) is Wrexham, with 65,692 people in the 2011 census. Data from the census details that North Wales has a lower number and proportion of residents living in settlements of 25,000 or more, than South East and South West Wales, but higher than Mid Wales. StatsWales attributes this to North Wales&#x27; lack of a settlement of a population higher than 100,000 people.

Age

North Wales has an ageing population, as the proportion of residents over 65 has increased from 18.5% to 23.0%, and the proportion of the population under 15 has decreased from 19.8% to 17.8%.

===Language===
Dialect

North Wales has a distinct regional identity. Its dialect of the Welsh language differs from that of other regions, such as South Wales, in some ways: for example &#x27; is used in most of the North instead of &#x27; for &quot;milk&quot;; a simple sentence such as &quot;go upstairs now&quot; might be &#x27; in North Wales, and &#x27; in South Wales. Colloquially, a person from North Wales (especially one who speaks with this dialect or accent) is known as a &quot;North Walian&quot;, or a &quot;Gog&quot; (from the Welsh &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;north&quot;). There are Welsh medium schools scattered all across North Wales, ranging from primary to secondary schools.

==== Welsh-speaking population ====
According to the 2011 census, there were 204,406 Welsh-speakers aged three and over in North Wales. Data from the Annual Population Survey, stated that Gwynedd had the largest proportion of speakers in North Wales and Wales as a whole, with 75.6% of residents aged 3 and over saying they can speak Welsh. Flintshire had the lowest rate of Welsh in North Wales, with only 22.5% saying they can speak it. North Wales is the most Welsh-speaking region of the 4 statistical regions of Wales, at 41.9% of the population speaking Welsh in the year ending September 2019, up approximately 2.4% from September 2009. However, Flintshire is one of 2 principal areas in Wales where the rate of Welsh has decreased over the past decade.

== Education ==
North Wales is home to two universities, Bangor University, and Wrexham Glyndwr University. In 2018-19, in total there were 17,500 enrolments on higher education courses in North Wales, representing 13.2% of student enrolments in all of Wales. Bangor University was home to a majority, 58.3% of these enrolments, with 10,195 enrolments in 2018-19, with Wrexham Glyndwr University following with 5,895 enrolments, and further education college Grŵp Llandrillo Menai providing the remaining 1,410 enrolments.

Further education (FE) in Wales is provided by &quot;colleges&quot; (not to be confused with a university college), these are usually either sixth form colleges, further education colleges, or sixth forms within secondary schools. Further education colleges are the largest further education institutions in North Wales, in which, at present, there are only 2; Grŵp Llandrillo Menai, and Coleg Cambria. Both of these colleges, are amalgamations of smaller further education or sixth form colleges, and are sometimes described as &quot;super colleges&quot;. Grŵp Llandrillo Menai is a merger of Coleg Llandrillo, Coleg Menai, and Coleg Meirion-Dwyfor, providing courses for students of the Isle of Anglesey, Conwy County Borough, Denbighshire, and Gwynedd. Coleg Cambria is a merger Deeside College and Yale College, Wrexham, providing courses for students of Denbighshire, Flintshire, and Wrexham County Borough. There are no standalone sixth form colleges (sixth form only) in North Wales, as all colleges providing sixth form courses also provide non-sixth form courses. 

The other institutions providing sixth form further education in North Wales are secondary schools, which provide sixth form education themselves. Not all secondary schools in North Wales provide sixth form education, with it being common for students of a secondary school that does not provide sixth form education to study at a further education college.

Grŵp Colegau NPTC Group of Colleges, a further education college formed from the merger of Neath Port Talbot College and Coleg Powys, is the main further education college for Powys, hosting a campus in Newtown.

== Health ==

=== Healthcare service ===

The 6 counties of North Wales are all part of the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB), it is the largest of the local health boards which divide up NHS Wales services in Wales. Formed from the merger of the North Wales NHS Trust (itself a merger of North East Wales, and Conwy &amp; Denbighshire NHS Trusts), the North West Wales NHS Trust, and the Local Health Boards of the six counties of Anglesey, Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire, Gwynedd, and Wrexham.

There are 3 main district general hospitals in North Wales; Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor, Ysbyty Glan Clwyd Hospital in Bodelwyddan, and Wrexham Maelor Hospital. Each hospital is the main centre of healthcare for the west, central, and east parts of North Wales respectively. North Wales additionally has a network of 22 acute and community hospitals, with patients commonly referred to hospitals in England for rare, more specialised treatment, unavailable under BCUHB, notably to Countess of Chester, Royal Liverpool University, and Royal Shrewsbury hospitals.

== Politics ==
The North Wales region is made up of the following six principal council areas; Isle of Anglesey, Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire, Gwynedd and Wrexham. These are unitary authorities which carry out almost all local government functions in their areas. In February 2021, a North Wales Corporate Joint Committee was formed to allow the six local councils in the region to collaborate in areas relating to economic well-being, strategic planning and the development of regional transport policies.

==Economy==
According to the Annual Population Survey and Office for National Statistics, the unemployment rate of the six principal areas of North Wales was collectively 3.9% for the population aged 16 and over; the employment rate was 75.9% of those aged 16-64, and the economic inactivity rate (excluding students) for the population aged 16-64 was 17.9%.

===North Wales Growth Deal===
In 2016 the UK Government invited North Wales to submit a Growth Deal Bid, to &quot;create thousands of jobs, boost the economy, improve transport and communication links, focus on renewable energy, support tourism and more&quot;. A bid was prepared by the North Wales Business Council, which consists of the Leaders and Chief Executives of the 6 councils, the Vice Chancellors of Wrexham Glyndŵr University and Bangor University the Chief Executives of Coleg Cambria and Grwp Llandrillo Menai, and North Wales Mersey Dee Business Council. In the 2018 budget Philip Hammond announced that £120M would be made available by the UK Government to support the Growth Deal. In December 2018, Ken Skates confirmed that the Welsh Government would match the UK Government funding, and also offered to match any additional funding support which the UK Government might make available. In November 2019 the Heads of Terms Agreement for the North Wales Growth Deal was signed by the representatives of the North Wales Economic Ambition Board, Alun Cairns the UK Government Secretary of State for Wales, and Eluned Morgan, Baroness Morgan of Ely on behalf of Welsh Government.

==Local media==

===Local newspapers===
Two daily newspapers are published in the region. The region-wide &quot;North Wales edition&quot; of the &quot;Daily Post&quot;, based at Bryn Eirias on Colwyn Bay&#x27;s Abergele Road, is distributed from Monday to Saturday, whilst &quot;The Leader&quot; (formerly the &quot;Evening Leader&quot;) publishes two editions for Wrexham and Flintshire and is based at the headquarters of Newsquest in Mold after NWN Media Ltd dissolved after existing since 1920.

Additionally, nine weekly newspapers provide local and community news:

==== Reach PLC titles ====
* &quot;Caernarfon and Denbigh Herald&quot; (Arfon and Dwyfor editions)
* &quot;The Mail&quot; (Bangor/Anglesey and Holyhead/Anglesey editions)

* &quot;Leader&quot;
The weekly Aberystwyth-based &quot;Cambrian News&quot; covers southern Gwynedd and publishes separate editions for the Arfon/Dwyfor and Meirionydd districts.

A weekly Welsh-language newspaper, &quot;Y Cymro&quot; is published each week by the &quot;Cambrian News&quot; from its Porthmadog office alongside two localised Welsh titles, &quot;Y Cyfnod&quot; (Bala) and &quot;Y Dydd&quot; (Dolgellau). &quot;Yr Herald Gymraeg&quot; is distributed by Trinity Mirror as a pull-out section in the Wednesday edition of the &quot;Daily Post&quot;. There are also 24 Papurau Bro (&quot;area papers&quot;) providing community news and generally published each month.

===Online===
Several hyperlocal websites in the area provide locally sourced news online. In Conwy county, BaeColwyn.com has provided Welsh language coverage of the Colwyn Bay area since 2011 and AbergelePost.com has been serving the Abergele area since 2010. Wrexham.com is a full-time operation covering Wrexham and the surrounding area, and is based at offices in Wrexham city centre. A full-time citizen-led online news site Deeside.com started in early 2013 and covers Connah&#x27;s Quay, Mancot, Pentre, Shotton, Queensferry, Sealand, Broughton, Hawarden, Ewloe, Sandycroft and parts of Saltney.

===Radio===
Although no BBC local radio stations exist in Wales, the corporation&#x27;s national services BBC Radio Wales and BBC Radio Cymru cover the region from their broadcasting centres in Bangor, and Wrexham. The Bangor studios produce a large number of Radio Cymru programmes with some music and feature output for Radio Wales originating from Wrexham.

Three commercial radio stations serve the area — Capital North West and Wales broadcasts local drivetime programming for Wrexham, Flintshire, Denbighshire and Conwy county as well as Cheshire and the Wirral with a Welsh language opt-out service for the former Coast FM area on 96.3 FM. Capital Cymru airs an extended local programming service, predominantly in the Welsh language, for Gwynedd and Anglesey. Across the entire region, Heart North Wales also airs local peak-time programming in English, including an extended news programme on weeknights. All three stations broadcast from studios in Gwersyllt on the outskirts of Wrexham.

Three community radio stations broadcast on FM — Calon FM serving Wrexham County Borough and parts of southern Flintshire, Tudno FM broadcasting to Llandudno &amp; surrounding areas and Môn FM across the Isle of Anglesey and parts of Gwynedd. Radio Glan Clwyd - an extension of hospital service Radio Ysbyty Glan Clwyd - broadcasts on 1287 AM in the Bodelwyddan, St Asaph, Rhuddlan, Towyn and Kinmel Bay areas.

Towards the western side of North Wales, local hills mean national BBC FM coverage can be quite poor, often suffering interference from Irish stations from the west.

===Television===
News coverage of North Wales is generally provided within the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Wales Today&quot;, &quot;Newyddion&quot; and &quot;Ffeil&quot; programmes (the latter two broadcast on S4C) and on ITV&#x27;s &quot;ITV News Cymru Wales&quot;. BBC Cymru Wales news teams are based at the corporation&#x27;s Bangor and Wrexham studios, while ITV Cymru Wales runs a newsroom in Colwyn Bay.

S4C has an administrative office in Caernarfon, where a cluster of independent production companies are also based or partly based including Rondo Media, Cwmni Da, Antena, Owain Roberts Animations and Tinopolis.

==Sport==

===Football===
Wrexham A.F.C. play in the English football league system; having been a member of the Football League for over 80 years, in 2008 they were relegated into the Conference National for the first time in their existence and now play in the EFL League Two (English Football League). Their home ground is the Racecourse Ground in Wrexham and they train at Colliers Park, Gresford. In November 2020, the club was purchased by Hollywood actors Rob McElhenney and Ryan Reynolds.

Several teams including Connah&#x27;s Quay Nomads F.C. and Bangor City F.C. have appeared in UEFA competitions, playing within the mostly semi-professional Welsh leagues the Cymru Premier and the Cymru North.

Due to the proximity of North Wales to the North West of England, support for the English clubs of Liverpool F.C., Everton F.C. and Manchester United F.C. has been historically strong.

===Rugby League===
Wales was represented in the Super League by the Crusaders RL, they re-located to Wrexham for the 2010 season from South Wales. They played at the Racecourse Ground and trained at Stansty Park both in Wrexham before folding in 2011. They have now been replaced by the League 1 side, North Wales Crusaders.

North Wales has its own amateur league, in the fifth tier of the British rugby league system, the North Wales Championship.

===Rugby Union===
In September 2008 it was announced by the Welsh Rugby Union that a development team based in North Wales would be created, with a long-term goal of becoming the fifth Welsh team in the Celtic League. It was envisaged that this would both help the growth of the game in the area, and provide a larger pool of players for the Welsh national team to be selected from. The team was named RGC 1404.

<text>31Knots is an American math rock band based in Portland, Oregon, United States, by guitarist Joe Haege and bassist Jay Winebrenner. It was founded in Chicago in 1997. In 1998 the band added Joe Kelly as a drummer; in 2003 he left and was replaced by Jay Pellicci of Dilute. Early albums explored the limits of a guitar-bass-drums rock trio, while more recent work has added samples, piano, and increasingly skewed songwriting that push 31Knots&#x27; music into an ever more difficult to categorize genre. They have toured Europe several times since 2004.

<doc id="686076" wikidata="Q949696" url="?curid=686076" title="Ken Curtis">
<text>Ken Curtis (born Curtis Wain Gates; July 2, 1916 – April 28, 1991) was an American actor and singer best known for his role as Festus Haggen on the western television series &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;.

==Early years==
Born the youngest of three boys in Lamar in Prowers County in southeastern Colorado, Curtis lived his first ten years on a ranch on Muddy Creek in eastern Bent County. In 1926, the family moved to Las Animas, the county seat of Bent County, so that his father, Dan Sullivan Gates, could run for sheriff. The campaign was successful, and Gates served from 1926 to 1931 as Bent County sheriff. 

Curtis was the quarterback of his Bent County High School football team and played clarinet in the school band. He graduated in 1935. During World War II, Curtis served in the U.S. Army from 1943 to 1945.

He attended Colorado College to study medicine, but left after a short time to pursue his musical career.

==Career==

===Music===

Curtis was a singer before moving into acting, and combined both careers once he entered films. Curtis was with the Tommy Dorsey band in 1941, and succeeded Frank Sinatra as vocalist until Dick Haymes contractually replaced Sinatra in 1942. Curtis may have served simply as insurance against Sinatra&#x27;s likely defection, and it was Dorsey who suggested that Gates change his name to Ken Curtis. Curtis then joined Shep Fields and His New Music, an all-reeds band that dispensed with a brass section. 

Curtis met his first wife, Lorraine Page, who was also under contract at Universal Studios, and they were married in 1943. For much of 1948, Curtis was a featured singer and host of the long-running country music radio program &quot;WWVA Jamboree&quot;. 

Ken Curtis joined the Sons of the Pioneers as a lead singer from 1949 to 1953 and again from 1955 to 1957. His big hits with the group included &quot;Room Full of Roses&quot; and &quot;(Ghost) Riders in the Sky&quot;.

===Film===
Columbia Pictures signed Curtis to a contract in 1945. He starred in a series of musical Westerns with the Hoosier Hot Shots, playing singing cowboy romantic leads.
By virtue of his second marriage, Curtis was a son-in-law of film director John Ford. Curtis teamed with Ford and John Wayne in &quot;Rio Grande&quot;. He was a singer in the movie&#x27;s fictional band &quot;The Regimental Singers&quot; that actually consisted of the &quot;Sons of the Pioneers&quot;; Curtis is not listed as a member of the principal cast. It is possible that he played a bit part, but Curtis is best remembered as Charlie McCorry in &quot;The Searchers&quot;, and for his appearances in &quot;The Quiet Man&quot;, &quot;The Wings of Eagles&quot;, &quot;The Horse Soldiers&quot;, &quot;The Alamo&quot;, and &quot;How the West Was Won&quot;. Curtis also joined Ford, along with Henry Fonda, James Cagney, William Powell, and Jack Lemmon, in the comedy Navy classic &quot;Mister Roberts&quot;. He was featured in all three of the only films produced by Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney&#x27;s C. V. Whitney Pictures: &quot;The Searchers&quot; (1956); &quot;The Missouri Traveler&quot; (1958) with Brandon deWilde and Lee Marvin; and &quot;The Young Land&quot; (1959) with Patrick Wayne and Dennis Hopper. In &quot;5 Steps to Danger&quot; (1957 film), he is uncredited as FBI Agent Jim Anderson. Curtis also produced two extremely low-budget monster films in 1959, &quot;The Killer Shrews&quot; and &quot;The Giant Gila Monster&quot;.

Curtis guest-starred five times on the Western television series &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot; with Richard Boone. In 1959, he appeared as cowhand Phil Jakes on the &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; season four episode, &quot;Jayhawkers&quot;. He also guest-starred as circus performer Tim Durant on an episode of &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, &quot;The Case of the Clumsy Clown&quot;, which originally aired on November 5, 1960. Later, he appeared in &quot;Ripcord&quot;, a first-run syndicated action/adventure series about a company of its namesake providing skydiving services, along with its leading star Larry Pennell. This series ran from 1961 to 1963 with 76 half-hour episodes in total. Curtis played the role of James (Jim) Buckley and Pennell was his young disciple Theodore (Ted) McKeever. This television show helped generate interest in sport parachuting.

In 1964, Curtis appeared as muleskinner Graydon in the episode &quot;Graydon&#x27;s Charge&quot; of the syndicated Western television series, &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, also guest-starring Denver Pyle and Cathy Lewis.

===&quot;Gunsmoke&quot;===
Curtis remains best known for his role as Festus Haggen, the scruffy, cantankerous, and illiterate deputy in &quot;Gunsmoke.&quot; He joined the regular &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; cast in 1964, replacing Chester Goode, played by Dennis Weaver. While Marshal Matt Dillon had a total of five deputies over two decades, Festus held the role the longest (11 years), in 304 episodes. Festus was patterned after &quot;Cedar Jack&quot; (Frederick Munden), a man from Curtis&#x27; Las Animas childhood. Cedar Jack, who lived 15 miles south of town, made a living cutting cedar fence posts. Curtis observed many times that Jack came to Las Animas, where he would often end up drunk and in Curtis&#x27; father&#x27;s jail. Festus&#x27; character was known, in part, for the nasally, twangy, rural accent which Curtis developed for the role, but which did not reflect Curtis&#x27; actual voice. 

Besides engaging in the usual personal appearances most television stars undertake to promote their program, Curtis also traveled around the country performing at Western-themed stage shows at fairs, rodeos, and other venues when &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; was not in production, and even for some years after the show was cancelled. Curtis also campaigned for Ronald Reagan in 1976, during the future President&#x27;s attempt to secure the Republican nomination from incumbent Gerald Ford. 

In two episodes of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, Carroll O&#x27;Connor was a guest-star; years later, Curtis guest-starred as a retired police detective on O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s NBC program &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;. He voiced Nutsy the vulture in Disney&#x27;s 1973 animated film &quot;Robin Hood&quot;. A decade later, he returned to television in the short-lived Western series &quot;The Yellow Rose&quot;, in which he performed most of his scenes with Noah Beery, Jr.

===Last years===
In 1981, Curtis was inducted into the Western Performers Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. 

Curtis&#x27; last acting role was as the aging cattle rancher &quot;Seaborn Tay&quot; in the television production &quot;Conagher&quot; (1991), by western author Louis L&#x27;Amour. Sam Elliott starred in the lead role, and Curtis&#x27; &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; co-star Buck Taylor (Newly O&#x27;Brien) played a bad man in the same film. Buck Taylor&#x27;s father, Dub Taylor, had a minor role in it.

Curtis married Torrie Connelly in 1966. They were married until his death in 1991 and he had two step-children.

A statue of Ken Curtis as Festus can be found at 430 Pollasky Avenue in Clovis, California, in Fresno County in front of the Educational Employees Credit Union. In his later years, Curtis resided in Clovis.

Curtis was a Republican and supported Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election.

== Death ==
Curtis died on April 28, 1991, in his sleep of a heart attack in Fresno, California. He was cremated, and his ashes were scattered in the Colorado flatlands.

<text>Jeffery Nape (1964 – 8 July 2016) was, until the 2012 election, speaker of the National Parliament and twice officially and once unofficially acting governor-general of Papua New Guinea. He was elected speaker by the members of the parliament on 28 May 2004, and then immediately became acting governor-general because that office was substantively vacant. He succeeded Bill Skate in both roles.

He ceased acting as governor-general on 29 June 2004, when Paulias Matane was sworn in. When Matane stepped down in 2010, Nape regained this post.

Following the 2007 general election, Nape was re-elected as Speaker on 13 August 2007, defeating the opposition&#x27;s candidate for the position, Bart Philemon, with 86 votes against 22 for Philemon. He was sworn in by Governor-General Paulias Matane on the same day.

He was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 2010 Birthday Honours.

in September 2011, Nape &quot;dropped a bombshell&quot; with his highly controversial decision to disqualify recently ousted Prime Minister Michael Somare, known as the &quot;Grand Chief&quot; and the &quot;father of the nation&quot;, from Parliament. Nape ruled that Somare had missed three consecutive parliamentary sessions, due to being in hospital for surgery followed by a lengthy recovery. When he entered Parliament in a wheelchair, Nape &quot;welcomed him warmly&quot;, but later declared that he was disqualifying him. Somare denied that he had missed three sessions.

In December 2011, a constitutional crisis broke out when the Supreme Court declared Sir Michael Somare to be the legitimate Prime Minister but Prime Minister Peter O&#x27;Neill, who had the support of a parliamentary majority, refused to step down. Governor-General Sir Michael Ogio, following the court order, recognised Somare as Prime Minister. Parliament responded, on 14 December, by &quot;suspending&quot; Ogio and declaring Nape, as Speaker, automatically the acting Governor-General. The Queen of Papua New Guinea, Elizabeth II, who appoints parliament&#x27;s chosen candidate for governor-general, did not revoke Ogio&#x27;s commission. On 19 December, Ogio was again recognized by Parliament as governor-general and O&#x27;Neill as Prime Minister.

In January 2012, Nape joined Don Polye&#x27;s new Triumph Heritage Empowerment Rural Party. He lost his seat at the 2012 election. He died of organ failure on 8 July 2016 in Port Moresby.

== Corruption charges ==
In May 2012, the government&#x27;s corruption watchdog, Investigation Task Force Sweep, drew up a warrant for Nape&#x27;s arrest in relation to the alleged misappropriation of $2.4 million in development funds, charges which Nape has denied.

Nape was arrested on bribery charges in July 2012 for attempting to bribe a rival candidate to drop out of the running of the 2012 general election. The candidate, who was competing for Nape&#x27;s Sinasina-Yongumugi seat, alleged that Nape offered him money to drop out of the election. Nape, who has denied all the charges, was released on bail and was due to appear in court after the elections.

<text>The are tidal whirlpools in the Naruto Strait, a channel between Naruto in Tokushima and Awaji Island in Hyōgo, Japan. The strait between Naruto and Awaji island has a width of about . The strait is one of the connections between the Pacific Ocean and the Inland Sea, a body of water separating Honshū and Shikoku, two of the main islands of Japan. The tide moves large amounts of water into and out of the Inland Sea twice a day. With a range of up to , the tide creates a difference in the water level of up to between the Inland Sea and the Pacific. Due to the narrowness of the strait, the water rushes through the Naruto channel at a speed of about four times a day, twice flowing in and twice flowing out. During a spring tide, the speed of the water may reach , creating vortices up to in diameter.

The current in the strait is the fastest in Japan and the fourth fastest in the world after the Saltstraumen outside Bodø in Norway, which reaches speeds of , the Moskenstraumen off the Lofoten islands in Norway (the original maelstrom) reaching ; and the Old Sow whirlpool in New Brunswick, Canada with up to .

The whirlpools can be observed from the shore on Awaji island, from tourist ships, or from the Uzunomichi Walkway of the 1985 Ōnaruto Bridge spanning the strait. The suspension bridge has a total length of , with the center span over the strait having a length of and a height of above sea level.

The whirlpools inspired the name for narutomaki surimi and the name of Naruto Uzumaki from the manga and anime &quot;Naruto&quot;, &quot;Uzumaki&quot; (うずまき) meaning &quot;whirlpool&quot;. The storyline starts with building the Great Naruto Bridge (なると大橋, &quot;Naruto Ōhashi&quot;) into The Land of Waves (波の国, &quot;Nami no Kuni&quot;) which is based on the Naruto Bridge spanning the Naruto Strait.

<text>The German football champions are the annual winners of the highest association football competition in Germany.

==History==
The history of the German football championship is complex and reflects the turbulent history of the country through the course of the 20th century.

Brought to the country by English immigrants, the sport took root in the cities of Berlin, Hamburg, Stuttgart, and Leipzig in the 1890s, leading to the growth of city, regional, and academic leagues, each with their own championships. Following the establishment of the German Football Association (Deutscher Fußball Bund) in 1900, the first recognized national championship match was hosted by Hamburg club Altona 93 in 1903 in which VfB Leipzig defeated DFC Prag 7–2, and was awarded the Viktoria, the championship trophy from 1903 to 1944. Before the formation of the Bundesliga in 1963, the championship format was based on a knockout competition, contested between the winners of each of the country&#x27;s top regional leagues. Since 1963, the first-place finisher in the Bundesliga has been recognized as the national champion.

Championship play was suspended twice; from 1915 to 1919 due to World War I and again from 1945 to 1947 due to World War II. Following World War II, Germany was occupied by the victorious Allies and two German football competitions emerged when the country was divided as a result. The historical tradition of the DFB was continued in what was known as West Germany, while a second national championship was contested in Soviet-controlled East Germany under the auspices of the DFV (Deutscher Fußball-Verband or German Football Federation). Following the reunification of the country in 1990, the two separate football competitions were merged and a single national championship was restored.

Bayern Munich hold the record for the most championships with 33, yet all but one of these (1932) come in Bundesliga competition. BFC Dynamo claimed 10 titles in the former East Germany, winning these championships in consecutive seasons (1979–88).

==Champions==
===Early German football championships (1903–32)===
The new British game of football quickly caught on in late 19th-century Germany, which had previously been a nation of gymnasts and fencers. The earliest attempt at organizing some form of national championship came in 1894, when city champions Viktoria 89 Berlin invited FC Hanau 93 to play a challenge match. The Hanauers were unable to afford the cost of the trip and so were unable to take up the invitation. In 2007, the 1894 final was replayed and Viktoria were crowned the official 1894 champions.

After its formation in 1900, the DFB began to establish its authority over the myriad city and regional leagues springing up throughout the country and organized the first officially recognized national championship in 1903.

The prize of German football was the Viktoria, a trophy statue of a seated Roman goddess of victory, donated by the committee that organized German participation in the 1900 Olympic Games in Paris – and originally intended to be shared with teams playing the rugby version of football. The formation of the DFB helped establish for the first time a clear divide between association football and its close cousin.

To qualify for the German championship finals, a club had to win one of the regional championships, which, in some cases, predate the national one. Those were:
* Southern German football championship – &quot;formed in 1898&quot;
* Brandenburg football championship – &quot;formed in 1898&quot;
* Central German football championship – &quot;formed in 1902&quot;
* Western German football championship – &quot;formed in 1903&quot;
* Northern German football championship – &quot;formed in 1906&quot;
* South Eastern German football championship – &quot;formed in 1906&quot;
* Baltic football championship – &quot;formed in 1908&quot;

One other regional championships briefly existed:
* March football championship – &quot;existed from 1903 to 1911&quot;

From 1925 onwards, the runners-up of those competitions were also qualified for the German championship finals, which had been expanded to sixteen clubs. The two strongest regions, &quot;South&quot; and &quot;West&quot; were also allowed to send their third-placed team. This system of regional championships was abolished in 1933 and superseded by the Gauliga system.

===German football championships in Nazi Germany (1933–45)===

With the beginning of the 1933–34 season, top-flight German football was reorganized into 16 regional Gauligen with each of these leagues sending their champion to the national playoffs. New Gauligen were created as the Reich expanded its border through the Anschluss with Austria. This expanded the national championship competition with the addition of regional champions from the new circuits. It also introduced previously foreign clubs into German domestic competition where Viennese Austrian sides made a notable impression. Competition during the war was also characterized by the formation of military-based clubs including the Luftwaffe side LSV Hamburg which appeared in the era&#x27;s last national championship match at the end of the 1943–44 season. Unlike the United Kingdom, where play was suspended early on, national football competition continued on in Germany in some form through the course of the war. Play finally collapsed as the war drew to its conclusion and no champion was declared in 1944–45.

It was also during this period that a national cup competition was introduced; the Tschammerpokal was named for Reichssportführer (Sports Chief of the Reich) Hans von Tschammer und Osten and is predecessor to the modern-day DFB-Pokal (German Cup). The first cup competition was staged in 1935 and won by 1. FC Nürnberg.

===German football championships from post-war to the Bundesliga (1946–63)===
In the immediate aftermath of World War II, German football was in complete disarray. Occupying Allied authorities ordered the dissolution of most organizations in the country.

However, many football clubs were soon re-established and new sides formed; play was tentatively resumed. By 1948, a new first division league structure, the Oberligen, was in place in most of the Western zone of occupation. The restored competition maintained the German game&#x27;s historical practice of play in regional leagues. An exception was in French-occupied Saarland where attempts by France to annex the state were manifested in the formation of a separate, but short-lived, football competition that staged its own championship. Saarland briefly had its own representation under FIFA, forming Olympic and World Cup sides, before re-joining German competition in 1956.

In the Soviet-occupied East zone, a more enduring separation took place that was not mended until the reunification of Germany in 1990. As a result, Eastern-based clubs did not take part in the German national championship under the DFB, vying instead for a different prize. The country&#x27;s capital city of Berlin was similarly divided and clubs based in West Berlin took part in western-based competition.

The Viktoria disappeared at war&#x27;s end, although it would eventually reappear and be held in East Germany. A new trophy – the Meisterschale – was introduced in the west in 1949. The first post-war champions were 1. FC Nürnberg (2–1 over 1. FC Kaiserslautern in Köln) who were also, coincidentally, the first champions following World War I.

Over time, the notion of professionalism – long anathema to German sports – made inroads in the country. A consequence of this was that by 1956, a distinct national amateur championship was established, open to teams playing below the Oberliga level in second- and third tier leagues.

===East German football championships (1950–90)===
The post-war occupation of Germany by the victorious Allies eventually led to the de facto partition of the country and the emergence of two separate German states, each with its own government and institutions.

Early plans to maintain a national championship to be contested by representatives from the eastern and western halves of the country quickly fell by the wayside in the context of the Cold War. An Ostzone champion was declared in each of the 1946–48 seasons and in 1949 the first division DDR-Oberliga was established under the DFV (Deutscher Fußball-Verband der DDR) as a distinct national sport governing body. From 1950 through to 1990 an East German football champion was declared, until the eastern competition was reintegrated into the German national competition under the DFB.

In the first recognized East German national championship staged in 1949, ZSG Union Halle defeated SG Fortuna Erfurt 4–1. In 1990, the last East German champion was SG Dynamo Dresden. The following season the DDR-Oberliga (I) was redesignated the Nord-Ostdeutscher Fußball Verband Oberliga and became a third tier regional division within the existing German league structure under the DFB. FC Hansa Rostock captured the title in the transitional 1990–91 season, and alongside runners-up SG Dynamo Dresden, advanced to play in the Bundesliga, thereby fully integrating former Eastern clubs into a unified German championship.

===Bundesliga (since 1963)===
The formation of the Bundesliga in 1963 marked a significant change to the German football championship. The historical regional league and national playoff format was abandoned in favour of a single unified national league. Sixteen teams from the five Oberligen in place at the time were invited to be part of the new circuit – which also for the first time formally acknowledged the sport as professional rather than amateur.

The new league adopted a round-robin format in which each team plays every other club once at home and once away. There is no playoff, with the club having the best record at the end of the season claiming the German championship. 1. FC Köln captured the first-ever Bundesliga title in the league&#x27;s inaugural 1963–64 season. Since then the competition has been dominated by Bayern Munich which has taken the championship in 32 of the 60 Bundesliga seasons played to 2023.

==Performances==
Over the history of the German football championship, 30 different clubs have won the title. The most successful club is FC Bayern Munich, with 33 titles to its credit, 32 of those coming in Bundesliga competition. The most successful pre-Bundesliga club is 1. FC Nürnberg, who won eight titles in the era of knockout play amongst regional champions.

Former German champions are recognized through the Verdiente Meistervereine system which permits the display of a star or stars on a club&#x27;s jersey. This system allows for the recognition of both German and East German titles, although only German titles are listed in the table below.

Clubs in bold currently play in the top division.

===Performance by club===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

Notes:

*A. VfB Leipzig would have faced Berliner TuFC, but no final was held.
*B. The German football championship was not held from 1915 to 1919 due to the First World War.
*C. The 1922 final between Hamburger SV and 1. FC Nürnberg ended 2–2. The match was called due to darkness after 189 minutes of play. The replay ended 1–1 when the referee called off the game while in extra time due to Nuremberg having just seven players remaining in the game. Hamburg was awarded the championship but later declined.
*D. The German football championship was not held from 1945 to 1947 due to the Second World War and its aftermath.
*E. VfB Leipzig are now known as Lokomotive Leipzig.
*F. Vienna was part of Germany when Rapid Wien won the championship in 1941.
===Performance by state and regional association===
As of 2024, German football champions have come from 11 of the 16 German states. The most successful state is Bavaria with 45 championships. Bavaria is also home to the two individually most successful clubs, Bayern Munich and 1. FC Nürnberg. North Rhine-Westphalia follows with 26 championships. The state is home to the third and fourth most successful clubs, Borussia Dortmund and Schalke 04. No club from the Saarland, Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt, Brandenburg, and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has yet won the championship.

In most cases the regional associations of the DFB align with state borders in Germany. However, the DFB has two regional associations in Rhineland-Palatinate, and three each in North Rhine-Westphalia and Baden-Württemberg. For the champions of these states the regional associations are mentioned as well. From 1938 to 1945 Austria was part of Germany, and Austrian clubs were thus allowed to compete in the German football championship. Rapid Wien won one championship in that period.

==Undeclared championships==
In over a century of German football competition, champions were not declared in several seasons for various reasons. No champion was declared in 1904 due to the DFB&#x27;s inability to resolve a protest filed by Karlsruher FV over their 1–6 semi-final loss to Britannia Berlin to determine which of these sides would face defending champion Leipzig in that year&#x27;s final. Karlsruhe&#x27;s protest was over the failure to play the match at neutral venue.

The national championship was suspended in October 1915 due to World War I. Limited play continued on a regional basis in many parts of the country, while competition was abandoned in other areas. Several regional leagues continued to declare champions or cup winners. The national championship was reinstated with the 1919–20 season that was concluded with a 2–0 victory by 1. FC Nürnberg over SpVgg Fürth in Frankfurt.

The 1922 final was contested by 1. FC Nürnberg and Hamburger SV, but never reached a conclusion on the pitch. The match was called on account of darkness after three hours and ten minutes of play, drawn at 2–2. The re-match also went into extra time, and in an era that did not allow for substitutions, the game was called at 1–1 when Nürnberg was reduced to just seven players and the referee ruled they could not continue. Considerable wrangling ensued over the decision. The DFB awarded the win to Hamburg under the condition that they renounce the title in the name of &quot;good sportsmanship&quot; – which they grudgingly did. Ultimately, the championship trophy was not officially presented that year.

Competition for the national title was maintained through most of World War II and was supported by the regime for morale. Play became increasingly difficult as the war drew to its conclusion due to manpower shortages, bombed-out stadiums, and the hardship and expense of travel. In the era&#x27;s final championship match Dresdner SC beat the military club LSV Hamburg 4–0 on 18 June 1944 in Berlin&#x27;s Olympiastadion. The 1944–45 season kicked off ahead of schedule in November; however, by March 1945 play had collapsed throughout Germany as Allied armies overran the country. Play was tentatively resumed in various parts of the now-occupied country in early 1946 and the postwar Oberliga structure began to take shape in the 1946–47 season; no national champion was declared from 1945 to 1947. In 1947–48, qualification play took place to determine Westzonen (Western occupation zones) and Ostzone (Eastern occupation zone) representatives to meet in a national final that never took place. 1. FC Nürnberg is recognized as the first postwar German national champion for its 2–1 victory over 1. FC Kaiserslautern in the Westzonen final staged on 8 August 1948 in Mannheim. In the Ostzone, SG Planitz beat SG Freiimfelde Halle 1–0 on 4 July 1948 in Leipzig to qualify for the scheduled national final, but were denied a permit to travel to play the match by Soviet authorities.

==Other national championships==
===Workers&#x27; and Faith-based Leagues===
In the aftermath of World War I, several lesser national football competitions emerged as outgrowths of the tumultuous German political situation. These included the left-leaning workers&#x27; ATSB (Arbeiter-Turn- und Sport-Bund), the Catholic-sponsored DJK (Deutschen Jugendkraft), the Protestant-backed DT (Deutsche Turnerschaft), and the Communist KG (Kampfgemeinschaft für Rote Sporteinheit). Through the 1920s and 1930s, each of these leagues staged their own national championships or fielded national sides. Because of the ideologies they represented, they were considered politically unpalatable by the regime and disappeared in the 1933 reorganization of German football under Nazi Germany that consolidated competition in state-sanctioned leagues. These clubs were forced into mergers with other mainstream sides or saw their assets seized by the state.

Antisemitism in Germany led to the creation of Jewish sports associations as Jews were forced out of mainstream clubs. These associations, including Sportbund Schild and Makkabi, staged their own national championships from 1933–38.

====Arbeiter-Turn-und Sportbund (1920–1933)====
Key

====Deutsche Jugendkraft (1921–1932)====
====Deutsche Turnerschaft (1925–1930)====
Following the 1930 season, most DT teams became part of the mainstream DFB.

====Kampfgemeinschaft für Rote Sporteinheit (1931–1933)====
==Participation of non-German clubs==
German championships have included clubs from countries other than Germany. DFC Prag, vice-champions in the first national final and a founding member of the DFB, was an ethnically-German club from Bohemia in the Austro-Hungarian Empire (today part of the Czech Republic) which did not at the time have its own national football federation.

Following the annexation of Austria, which was incorporated into Nazi Germany in 1938, Austrian clubs became part of German competition; Admira Wien made a losing appearance in the German national final in 1939, Rapid Wien captured the championship in 1941, and First Vienna also lost in 1942. In each case their opposition was Schalke 04. Throughout the course of World War II, clubs in German-occupied territories were made part of German competition in the Gauligen and took part in the regional qualifying rounds of the national championship, but without the same success as Austrian sides.

==Trophies==
Two trophies have been used for the official German and, during the era of the divided Germany, West German champions. The pre-Second World War trophy, the &quot;Viktoria&quot;, was awarded from 1903 to 1944, making Saxonian clubs VfB Leipzig the first and Dresdner SC the last club to receive it. The trophy disappeared during the final stages of the war and would not resurface until after the German reunification. A new trophy, the &quot;Meisterschale&quot;, was commissioned after the war but was not ready for the first post-war champions in 1948. Instead it was first awarded to VfR Mannheim in 1949. While the original trophy has only the champions from 1903 to 1944 engraved the new one lists all the German champions since 1903 and has had to be enlarged on occasion.
