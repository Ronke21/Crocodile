<text>Lieutenant Colonel John Masters, DSO, OBE (26 October 1914 – 7 May 1983) was a British novelist and regular officer of the Indian Army.

In World War II, he served with the Chindits behind enemy lines in Burma, and became the GSO1 (chief staff officer) of the 19th Indian Infantry Division. Masters is principally known for his historical novels set in India, notably &quot;Bhowani Junction&quot;, which was turned into a successful film. He also wrote three volumes of autobiography, which were positively received by critics.

==Life==
Masters was the son of a regular soldier, a lieutenant-colonel whose family had a long tradition of service in the British Indian Army. He was educated at Wellington and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. On graduating from Sandhurst in 1933, he was seconded to the Duke of Cornwall&#x27;s Light Infantry (DCLI) for a year before applying to serve with the 4th Prince of Wales&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles. He saw service on the North-West Frontier with the 2nd battalion of the regiment, and was rapidly given a variety of appointments within the battalion and the regimental depot.

In 1938, he organised a hunt for a leopard reported to be roaming the depot at Bakloh, only to find himself facing a full-grown tiger (which killed one of the Gurkhas acting as beaters). He later commented that whatever rank and decorations he was awarded, he was always known to the Gurkhas as &quot;The Sahib who shot the Bakloh tiger&quot;.

In early 1939, he was appointed the Adjutant of the 2nd battalion of the 4th Gurkhas. During the Second World War his battalion was sent to Basra in Iraq, during the brief Anglo-Iraqi War. Masters subsequently served in Iraq, Syria, and Persia with the battalion, before being briefly seconded as a staff officer in a Line of Communications HQ. In early 1942, he attended the Indian Army&#x27;s Staff College at Quetta. Here he met the wife of a fellow officer and they began an affair. Even though they later married, there was something of a scandal at the time.

After passing the Staff College, Masters next served as brigade major in the 114th Indian Infantry Brigade before being &quot;poached&quot; by Joe Lentaigne, another officer from the 4th Gurkhas, to be brigade major in the 111th Indian Infantry Brigade, a Chindit formation. From March 1944, the brigade served behind the Japanese lines in Burma. On the death of General Orde Wingate on 24 April, Lentaigne became the Chindit commander and Masters commanded the main body of the 111th Indian Infantry Brigade.

In May 1944, the brigade was ordered to hold a position code-named &#x27;Blackpool&#x27; near Mogaung in northern Burma. The isolated position was attacked with great intensity for seventeen days and eventually the brigade was forced to withdraw. Masters felt obliged to order the medical orderlies to shoot 19 of his own men, casualties who had no hope of recovery or rescue. Masters later wrote about these events in the second volume of his autobiography, &quot;The Road Past Mandalay&quot;. In recognition of his &quot;gallant and distinguished services in Burma&quot;, he was in October awarded the DSO.

After briefly commanding the 3rd battalion of his regiment, Masters subsequently became GSO1 (the Chief of Staff) of the Indian 19th Infantry Division, which was involved in the later stages of the Burma Campaign. Near the end of the war he was offered command of an Indian airborne brigade but the Japanese surrender intervened. On 17 January 1946 he was awarded an OBE for his service in Burma.

After a spell as a staff officer in GHQ India in Delhi, he then served as an instructor at the British Army Staff College, Camberley. He left the army in 1948 with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, and moved to the United States, where he set up a business promoting walking tours in the Himalayas, one of his hobbies. The business was not a success and, to make ends meet, he decided to write of his experiences in the army. When his novels proved popular, he became a full-time writer.

In later life, Masters and his wife Barbara moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico. He died in 1983 from complications following heart surgery. His family and friends scattered his ashes from an aeroplane over a mountain trail he frequently hiked in. General Sir Michael Rose, the former UN commander in Bosnia, is a stepson of Masters.

==Personality==
&quot;John Masters: A Regimented Life&quot; by John Clay was published by Michael Joseph in 1992. Now out of print, it is a sympathetic but not uncritical biography. According to Clay, Masters possessed a strong and sometimes domineering personality, and could be impatient with weakness or incompetence. He could also be extremely warmhearted and generous. His outgoing and boisterous personality flourished during his long residence in the United States. Masters was impatient with the literary establishment, which faulted his Indian novels as unsympathetic to Indians, and he was impatient with editors who wanted to remove the rough edges from his characters. Masters strove for accuracy and realism, resenting it when people mistook his characters&#x27; views as his own. He was extremely hard-working and meticulously well-organised, both as a soldier and a novelist. Clay speculates that Masters may have been driven to achieve by rumours that his family was not &quot;pure&quot; English, but Anglo-Indian or Eurasian. In 1962 Masters learned what he had apparently long suspected, that he did indeed have a distant Indian ancestor.

Clay&#x27;s biography provides details that Masters omitted from the three volumes of autobiography he wrote: &quot;Bugles and a Tiger&quot; (1956); &quot;Road Past Mandalay&quot; (1961); and &quot;Pilgrim Son&quot; (1971). They are nevertheless extremely revealing. &quot;Bugles and a Tiger&quot;, details Masters&#x27;s time at Sandhurst and service on India&#x27;s northwest frontier on the eve of the Second World War. &quot;Road Past Mandalay&quot; deals mostly with the Burma campaign in the War, while &quot;Pilgrim Son&quot; chronicles his career as a writer.
==Literary works==

===History of the British in India===
Apart from the autobiographical works mentioned above, Masters is also known for his historical novels set in India. Seven of these portray members of successive generations of the Savage family serving in the British and Indian Armies in India, in an attempt to trace the history of the British in India through the life of one family. In chronological order of events (but not in order of publication) these novels are:
* &quot;Coromandel!&quot; (1955): a 17th-century English youth runs away to sea and ends up in India.
* &quot;The Deceivers&quot; (1952): an English officer goes undercover to root out the ritual murders of Thuggee.
* &quot;Nightrunners of Bengal&quot; (1951): a tale of the Indian Rebellion of 1857.
* &quot;The Lotus and the Wind&quot; (1953): a tale of The Great Game of British and Russian agents on the Northwest Frontier.
* &quot;Far, Far the Mountain Peak&quot; (1957): a tale of mountaineering and the First World War.
* &quot;The Ravi Lancers&quot; (1972): an offshoot of the series, set in the First World War, with one of the protagonists related to the Savages but having a different name.
* &quot;Bhowani Junction&quot; (1954): a romance set in a railway town at the time of Indian calls for independence and the Partition of India.
* &quot;To the Coral Strand&quot; (1962): the story of an ex-officer who refuses to go gracefully after Indian independence.
* &quot;The Himalayan Concerto&quot; (1976): another offshoot, as the protagonist isn&#x27;t named Savage, a 1970s Cold War thriller about spying on a planned Chinese invasion of India.

One of Masters&#x27;s last Indian novels, &quot;The Venus of Konpara&quot;, is notable for the fact that its principal characters are Indians. The Savage family play no role in the storyline, though it is hinted that a minor unidentified character is a family member. It is set in the nineteenth century during the British &quot;Raj&quot;, but explores the history of Indo-Aryan and Dravidian identities in the country.

Master&#x27;s works have come under criticism for their depiction of Indian characters. However, both &quot;Nightrunners of Bengal&quot; and &quot;The Ravi Lancers&quot; contain sympathetic portrayals of Indian nationalists and portray irreconcilable tensions between British and Indian characters that mirror the conflicts inherent in British India in a manner comparable to E. M. Forster&#x27;s &quot;A Passage to India&quot;. The descendant of the hero of the former novel (who is in practice manifestly the same character) experiences the partition of India with a resigned detachment and later undergoes a deep personal crisis which ends with his staying on in independent India rather than returning to Britain. One Indian novelist (Khushwant Singh) remarked that while Kipling understood India, Masters understood Indians.

===Adaptations===
The best-known film is probably &quot;Bhowani Junction&quot; (1956), which concerns the Partition of India and the Anglo-Indian community. It starred Ava Gardner. Four of the novels (the 2nd, 3rd, 4th &amp; 6th in the series) were adapted for an 18-part serial in BBC Radio 4&#x27;s Classic Serial slot, being broadcast from October 1984 to January 1985. &quot;The Venus of Konpara&quot; had also been dramatised for BBC Radio in 1973. &quot;The Deceivers&quot; was filmed in 1988 and starred Pierce Brosnan.

===Other themes===

Masters&#x27;s trilogy of &quot;Now God Be Thanked&quot;, &quot;Heart of War&quot;, and &quot;In The Green of the Spring&quot; has some claim to be considered his magnum opus, covering the changes to various segments of British society wrought by the upheavals of the First World War. Masters&#x27;s book &quot;Man of War&quot; appears to have been the first of a planned trilogy on the Second World War; however, the author died before any other connected books were published.

The 1959 &quot;Fandango Rock&quot;, written in between the Indian books, is an exception – its plot being set in the fascist Spain ruled by General Franco and focusing on the relationship between the American and Spanish governments.

In the 1950s and 1960s the books of Masters sold in large numbers, particularly &quot;Bhowani Junction&quot;, which was also translated into various other languages. Some of his works are now out of print.

<doc id="665400" wikidata="Q1566425" url="?curid=665400" title="USS Rhode Island (SSBN-740)">
<text>USS &quot;Rhode Island&quot; (SSBN-740) is a United States Navy ballistic missile submarine which has been in commission since 1994. She is the third U.S. Navy ship to be named for Rhode Island, the 13th state.

==Construction and commissioning==
Originally, another &quot;Ohio&quot;-class submarine, SSBN-730, was to have been named &quot;Rhode Island&quot;; a contract was awarded in 1977 for SSBN-730″s construction and her keel was laid in 1981 with the name &quot;Rhode Island&quot; planned for the completed submarine. However, shortly after the sudden death of United States Senator Henry M. Jackson of Washington, SSBN-730 was renamed while still under construction. The name &quot;Rhode Island&quot; was transferred to SSBN-740, for which a construction contract had not yet been awarded.

The contract to build &quot;Rhode Island&quot; (SSBN-740) was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, on 5 January 1988 and her keel was laid down there on 15 September 1988. She was launched on 17 July 1993, sponsored by Mrs. Kati Machtley, and commissioned on 9 July 1994, with Captain John K. Eldridge commanding the Blue Crew and Commander Michael Maxfield commanding the Gold Crew.

==Service history==
On 11 August 2009, &quot;Rhode Island&quot; rescued five Bahamian fishermen whose boat had capsized on 7 August 2009. &quot;Rhode Island&quot;″s medical staff tended to the four men and one boy before transferring them to a ship which took them to shore for further treatment.

In 2010 &quot;Rhode Island&quot; was awarded the Battle &quot;E&quot; for Squadron 20. In 2011 &quot;Rhode Island&quot; was awarded the Omaha Trophy in recognition for superior performance and setting fleet standards in the field of strategic deterrence.

From December 2015 to August 2018, &quot;Rhode Island&quot; was in Norfolk Naval Shipyard undergoing an Engineered Refueling Overhaul, in which her reactor was refueled and numerous other systems modernized.

On 1 November 2022, &quot;Rhode Island&quot; arrived at Gibraltar for a scheduled port visit.

==USS &quot;Rhode Island&quot; in popular culture==
On 8 May 2007, &quot;Rhode Island&quot; was named the &quot;official ballistic missile submarine&quot; of the American satirical television show &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; after crew members submitted photos of a &quot;Colbert Nation&quot; poster taken in different locations aboard the vessel. The connection to the show was made through one of the sailors who was engaged to Stephen Colbert&#x27;s cousin.

<text>S.P.O.C.K (aka Star Pilot On Channel K) is a Swedish synthpop band which formed around 1988.

==Background==
The band&#x27;s original lineup was songwriter Eddie Bengtsson (formerly a founding member of Page), Finn Albertsson, and vocalist Alexander Hofman. Over time the members of the band have shifted: Johan Billing was a member of the band from 1994 to 1998, but with the release of &quot;S.P.O.C.K: 1999&quot; (in 1999) the band&#x27;s lineup changed to one with Alexander Hofman (the band&#x27;s only remaining founding member), Johan Malmgren (former member of Elegant Machinery and Aaron Sutcliffe) and Christer Hermodsson.

In 1988, Eddie Bengtsson wrote a handful of songs to be performed at Finn Albertsson&#x27;s birthday party, with Alexander Hofman performing vocals; the three young men dubbed the band Mr. Spock (after the name for the character Spock of &quot;Star Trek&quot;). After the performance at the party, the band continued for several months to play at other house parties, but soon managed to secure some event bookings. In 1989, the band members contacted Paramount Pictures for permission to use the name &quot;Mr. Spock&quot;. When Paramount demanded a heavy compensation for the privilege, the band renamed themselves using the initials S.P.O.C.K, which are an acronym for Star Pilot On Channel K.

S.P.O.C.K&#x27;s commercial success began in 1990 when the Swedish record label Accelerating Blue Fish published &quot;Silicon Dream&quot; as a limited-edition 7-inch single. The lyrical subject matter of S.P.O.C.K&#x27;s songs frequently centers on science fiction stories, (in particular, &quot;Star Trek&quot;). Other topics include alien-human relations and life in space. Representative songs include: &quot;Alien Attack&quot;, &quot;E.T. Phone Home&quot;, &quot;Never Trust a Klingon&quot;, &quot;Not Human&quot;, &quot;In Space No One Can Hear You Scream&quot;, &quot;Mr. Spock&#x27;s Brain&quot;, &quot;Dr. McCoy&quot; and &quot;Astrogirl&quot;.

On stage the band members adopted a cyberpunk/sci-fi-esque personae, with Eddie Bengtsson calling himself &quot;Eddie B. Kirk&quot;, Alexander Hofman as &quot;Android&quot;, and Finn Albertsson as &quot;Cybernoid&quot;. Together with such bands as Page, Elegant Machinery, Sista Mannen På Jorden and Kiethevez, S.P.O.C.K helped to define the sound of the Swedish synthpop movement.

In 1997, members of S.P.O.C.K started their own recording label SubSpace Communications. The band&#x27;s 1999 album, &quot;1999&quot;, ranked #25 on the German Alternative Chart&#x27;s (DAC) 1999 Top 50 Albums chart.

In 2010 Christer Hermodsson left the band in order to focus on other musical endeavors. He was then replaced by Valdi Solemo. The band&#x27;s current line up is vocalist Alexander Hofman (a.k.a. Android - the only remaining founding member), keyboardist Valdi Solemo (aka Val Solo), and keyboardist Johan Malmgren (aka Yo-Haan).

During the last years S.P.O.C.K has focused more on live gigs. Mostly in Germany, but also in Sweden, Canada, Estonia, Mexico, United Kingdom &amp; the Czech Republic.

Johan Malmgren and Eskil Simonsson of the band Covenant formed the band Aaron Sutcliffe in 1999 to perform synthpop covers of Elvis Presley songs.

<text>The National Roads Authority (NRA) () is a state body in Ireland, responsible for the national road network. The NRA was established as part of the Roads Act 1993 and commenced operations on 23 December 1993 in accordance with S.I. 407 of 1993. The NRA absorbed the Railway Procurement Agency on 1 August 2015. Technically still the NRA, the merger of the two agencies is legally operationally called Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), and is often treated as a new agency.

County councils remain responsible for local and regional roads, as well as various tasks like setting speed limits. The NRA, meanwhile, was responsible for the planning, maintenance and construction of National Primary Routes and National Secondary Routes as well as establishing safety measures. Ireland&#x27;s national road network consists of of National Primary Routes and of National Secondary Routes.

The body also plays an environmental and archaeological role as part of the road building programme, publishing an archaeology magazine, &quot;seanda&quot;, since 2006. Since 2007 it has managed the eToll toll payment interoperability system operated by Egis Projects.

The NRA was headed by a chief executive officer (CEO) who reported to the NRA&#x27;s board which in turn reported to the Minister for Transport. There were four departmental heads who reported to the CEO: the Head of Finance and Administration, the Head of Engineering Operations, the Head of PPP (Public Private Partnerships), Strategic Planning and Commercial Operations and the Head of Corporate Affairs and Professional Services.

In the previous decade, the NRA was mainly concerned with the extensive expansion of Ireland&#x27;s motorway network under the National Development Plan (NDP). The Transport 21 element of the NDP involved improvements to Ireland&#x27;s transport networks including its roads. The NRA was responsible for making major improvements to key roads, especially the Major Inter-Urban Routes. These routes were the N1/M1 (Dublin - north of Dundalk), the N4/M4/N6/M6 (Dublin - Kinnegad-Galway), the N7/M7 (Dublin-Limerick), the N8/M8 (Portlaoise-Cork) and the N9/M9 (near Naas-Waterford).

Major improvements were also made to many other national primary and national secondary routes, most notably the Atlantic Corridor routes (N15, N17, N18, N20, N24, N25) and the N11/M11 (Dublin - Wexford).

In the contract award procedure for the construction of the Dundalk Western Bypass motorway, which commenced with a call for interest issued in 2001, failure by the National Roads Authority to notify an unsuccessful bidding consortium, Eurolink, that they would not be appointed as construction contractor gave rise to a legal case raised in the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in 2008. The court ruled that Ireland&#x27;s transposition of the EU directives on public works contracts, Directives 93/37 and 89/665 as amended, into Irish law was flawed. Order 84A of the Rules of the Superior Courts was amended as a result of the ECJ ruling.

<doc id="665426" wikidata="Q1777663" url="?curid=665426" title="Korn Ferry Tour">
<text>The Korn Ferry Tour is the developmental tour for the U.S.-based PGA Tour, and features professional golfers who have either not yet reached the PGA Tour, or who have done so but then failed to win enough FedEx Cup points to stay at that level. Those who are on the top 30 of the money list at year&#x27;s end are given PGA Tour memberships for the next season. Since the 2013 season, the Korn Ferry Tour has been the primary pathway for those seeking to earn their PGA Tour card. Q-School, which had previously been the primary route for qualification to the PGA Tour, has been converted as an entryway to the Korn Ferry Tour.

==History==
Announced in early 1989 by PGA Tour commissioner Deane Beman, the &quot;satellite tour&quot; was formalized by the PGA Tour in 1990, originally named the Ben Hogan Tour, sponsored by the Ben Hogan Golf Company. The first season of 1990 had 30 events, and the typical event purse was $100,000. Late in 1992, Nike acquired the title sponsorship and it became the Nike Tour for seven seasons (1993–1999). Buy.com was the next title sponsor with the tour being titled the Buy.com Tour for three seasons (2000–2002).

Nationwide Insurance became the tour&#x27;s next title sponsors for the start of the 2003 season, with the tour being renamed the Nationwide Tour. After seasons as the Nationwide Tour, Web.com was announced as the new title sponsor in late June 2012. The 10-year sponsorship deal was effective immediately, and the tour&#x27;s name was changed to the Web.com Tour mid-season. In June 2019, the PGA Tour announced a 10-year deal with Los Angeles–based consulting firm Korn Ferry to replace Web.com as the tour&#x27;s sponsor.

The vast majority of tournaments have always been hosted within the mainland United States. In 1993 the tour reached beyond those boundaries for the first time, with the Monterrey Open in Mexico. It was an annual fixture on the tour schedule until 2001. The following season, the tour added PGA Tour of Australasia co-sanctioned events in Australia and New Zealand, and the Canadian PGA Championship in Canada. A tournament in Panama was added in 2004, and the tour returned to Mexico in 2008. The tour has also visited Colombia (since 2010), Chile (2012–2015), Brazil (2013–2016), the Dominican Republic (2016–2017) and the Bahamas (since 2017).

==Rules and results==
All Korn Ferry Tour tournaments operate similarly to typical PGA Tour tournaments in that they are all 72-hole stroke play events with a cut made after 36 holes. The cut on the Korn Ferry Tour is for the top 65 players and ties, which is the same as the PGA Tour. The fields are usually 144 or 156 players, depending on time of year (and available daylight hours). As with the PGA Tour, the winner of the tournament will get a prize of 18% of the total purse.

Since this tour is a developmental tour, players are usually vying to play well enough to gain status on the PGA Tour.

Until 2012, there were a number of ways of getting onto the Korn Ferry Tour: Top 50 golfers at qualifying school after the top 25 and ties, those who finished between 26th and 60th on the previous year&#x27;s money list, 126–150th on the previous season&#x27;s PGA Tour money list, and those who were formerly fully exempt on the PGA Tour in the recent past. Those without status can also earn enough to exceed 100th on the previous season&#x27;s money list and earned unlimited exemptions for the remainder of the season. Around 14 open qualifying spots are given during the Monday of tournament week, and those who finished in the top 25 of a Korn Ferry event are automatically exempt into the next tournament. If a Monday morning qualifier wins an event, they will earn full-exempt status for the remainder of the season. Past PGA Tour winners aged 48 and 49 can play on the Korn Ferry Tour on an increased basis to prepare themselves for PGA Tour Champions, while former PGA Tour winners with limited status use the Korn Ferry Tour as a way to get back to the main tour.

In 2007 Paul Claxton became the first man to reach US$1 million in Korn Ferry Tour career earnings.

The Korn Ferry Tour offers Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR) points. From 2006 until August 2022, when the OWGR points system changed, the winner earned a minimum of 14 points (provided at least 54 holes were played) and 20 for the Korn Ferry Tour Championship. Starting in 2013, the other events of the Korn Ferry Tour Finals awarded 16 points to the winner. Tournaments shortened to 36 holes were given reduced values of ten points for regular season events and the win is considered unofficial. With the change in the OWGR system, there are no minimum points for any tour. In 2023, the winner&#x27;s points ranged from 10.14 to 15.31, averaging 13.05. In 2024, the winner&#x27;s points ranged from 11.08 to 14.63, averaging 13.13.

===Three-win promotion===

Since 1997, a player who wins three tournaments in one year on the Korn Ferry Tour receives an immediate promotion to the PGA Tour for the remainder of the year and for the following year. This &quot;performance promotion&quot; (sometimes informally referred to as a &quot;battlefield promotion&quot;) has occurred 13 times:

* 1997: Chris Smith
* 2001: Heath Slocum, Chad Campbell, Pat Bates
* 2002: Patrick Moore
* 2003: Tom Carter
* 2005: Jason Gore
* 2007: Nick Flanagan
* 2009: Michael Sim
* 2014: Carlos Ortiz
* 2016: Wesley Bryan
* 2020–21: Mito Pereira
* 2024: Matt McCarty

==Changes for 2013 season and beyond==
On March 20, 2012, the PGA Tour announced radical changes to the main tour&#x27;s season and qualifying process effective in 2013. Major changes to what was then known as the Nationwide Tour were also announced at that time. Full details of these changes were announced on July 10 of that year.

The first major change was that beginning in fall 2013, the PGA Tour season started in October of the previous calendar year. This change had several consequences for the Korn Ferry Tour, either directly or indirectly.

Starting with the 2013 season, the Korn Ferry Tour has a structure similar to that of the main PGA Tour, with a regular season followed by a season-ending series of tournaments. In the case of the Korn Ferry Tour, the ending series consists of four tournaments, to be held during the main tour&#x27;s FedEx Cup playoffs, called the Korn Ferry Tour Finals. At least 150 players will be eligible to compete in the Finals—the top 75 on the Korn Ferry Tour regular-season money list, plus the players finishing between 126 and 200 on the FedEx Cup points list. Non-members of the PGA Tour are also eligible if they would have earned enough FedEx Cup points to finish 126 to 200. In addition, PGA Tour players who have been granted medical extensions for the following season are eligible. Because some of the PGA Tour players will be exempt by other means, such as tournament wins in the previous two years, the Finals fields will not consist of all eligible players. A total of 50 PGA Tour cards for the following season will be awarded at the end of the Finals—25 to the top regular-season money winners on the Korn Ferry Tour, with the remaining 25 determined by total money earned during the Finals.

Those who finish in the Top 75 on the points list but fail to earn PGA Tour cards retain full Korn Ferry Tour status, along with those who finished 126–150 on the PGA Tour FedEx Cup standings. Conditional status is given to those who finish in the top 100 on the money list or 151–200 in the FedEx Cup.

From 2013 to 2022, the PGA Tour Qualifying Tournament was replaced by the Korn Ferry Tour Qualifying Tournament which granted playing rights only for the Korn Ferry Tour. In 2023, the Qualifying Tournament again awarded PGA Tour cards, this time to the top five plus ties. Those up to 40th plus ties are fully exempt on the Korn Ferry Tour. The next twenty are fully exempt on PGA Tour Americas and conditionally on the Korn Ferry Tour. All others who reach the final stage are conditionally exempt on bot the PGA Tour Americas and Korn Ferry Tour.

Finally, the Korn Ferry Tour now provides up to two entrants in the following year&#x27;s Players Championship. One invitation is extended to the player who tops the money list for the entire season, including the Finals. The golfer who earns the most during the Finals also receives an invitation; if the same player leads both money lists, only one invitation is given.

<doc id="665433" wikidata="Q312961" url="?curid=665433" title="John Franklin Enders">
<text>John Franklin Enders (February 10, 1897 – September 8, 1985) was an American biomedical scientist and Nobel Laureate. Enders has been called &quot;The Father of Modern Vaccines.&quot;

==Life and education==
Enders was born in West Hartford, Connecticut on February 10, 1897. His father, John Ostrom Enders, was CEO of the Hartford National Bank and left him a fortune of $19 million upon his death. He attended the Noah Webster School in Hartford, and St. Paul&#x27;s School in Concord, New Hampshire. After attending Yale University a short time, he joined the United States Army Air Corps in 1918 as a flight instructor and a lieutenant.

After returning from World War I, he graduated from Yale, where he was a member of Scroll and Key as well as Delta Kappa Epsilon. He went into real estate in 1922, and tried several careers before choosing the biomedical field with a focus on infectious diseases, gaining a PhD at Harvard in 1930. He later joined the faculty at Children&#x27;s Hospital Boston.

Enders died at his summer home in Waterford, Connecticut, aged 88, on 8 September 1985. His wife died in 2000.

==Biomedical career==

In 1949, Enders, Thomas Huckle Weller, and Frederick Chapman Robbins reported successful &quot;in vitro&quot; culture of an animal virus—poliovirus. The three received the 1954 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine &quot;for their discovery of the ability of poliomyelitis viruses to grow in cultures of various types of tissue&quot;.

Meanwhile, Jonas Salk applied the Enders-Weller-Robbins technique to produce large quantities of poliovirus, and then developed a polio vaccine in 1952. Upon the 1954 polio vaccine field trial, whose success Salk announced on the radio, Salk became a public hero but failed to credit the many other researchers that his effort rode upon, and was somewhat shunned by America&#x27;s scientific establishment.

In 1954, Enders and Thomas C. Peebles isolated measlesvirus from an 11-year-old boy, David Edmonston. Disappointed by polio vaccine&#x27;s development and involvement in some cases of polio and death—what Enders attributed to Salk&#x27;s technique—Enders began development of measles vaccine. In October 1960, an Enders team began trials on 1,500 mentally retarded children in New York City and on 4,000 children in Nigeria.
Refusing credit for merely himself when &quot;The New York Times&quot; announced the measles vaccine effective on September 17, 1961, Enders wrote to the newspaper to acknowledge the work of various colleagues and the collaborative nature of the research. In 1963, a deactivated measles vaccine and an attenuated measles vaccine were introduced by Pfizer and Merck &amp; Co., respectively.

He continued to work in virology research till the late 1970s and retired from the laboratory at the age of 80.

<doc id="665434" wikidata="Q1130156" url="?curid=665434" title="Shrunken head">
<text>A shrunken head is a severed and specially-prepared human head often decreased to many times smaller than typical size that is used for trophy, ritual, trade, or other purposes.

Headhunting is believed to have occurred in many regions of the world since time immemorial, but the practice of head shrinking has only been documented in the northwestern region of the Amazon rainforest. Jivaroan peoples, which includes the Shuar, Achuar, Huambisa and Aguaruna tribes from Ecuador and Peru, are known to keep shrunken human heads. While many were probably made from the remains of these peoples, the Shuar people are the only culture in the world that practiced ritualistic head shrinking.

Shuar people call a shrunken head a &quot;tsantsa&quot;, also transliterated &quot;tzantza&quot;. Many tribe leaders would display their heads to scare enemies.

Shrunken heads are known for their mandibular prognathism, facial distortion, and shrinkage of the lateral sides of the forehead; these are artifacts of the shrinking process. Among the Shuar, the reduction of the heads was followed by a series of feasts centered on important rituals.

==Technique==

The process of creating a shrunken head begins with removing the skull from the neck. An incision is made on the back of the ear and all the skin and flesh is removed from the cranium. Red seeds are placed underneath the nostrils and the lips are sewn shut. The mouth is held together with three palm pins. Fat from the flesh of the head is removed. Then a wooden ball is placed under the flesh to keep the form. The flesh is then boiled in water that has been saturated with a number of herbs containing tannins. The head is then dried with hot rocks and sand while molding it to retain its human features. The skin is then rubbed with charcoal ash. Decorative beads may be added to the head.

In the head shrinking tradition, it is believed that coating the skin in ash keeps the &quot;muisak&quot;, or avenging soul, from seeping out.

== Significance ==

The practice of preparing shrunken heads originally had religious significance; shrinking the head of an enemy was believed to harness the spirit of that enemy and compel him to serve the shrinker. It was said to prevent the soul from avenging his death.

Shuar believed in the existence of three fundamental spirits:
*Wakani – innate to humans thus surviving their death.
*Arutam – literally &quot;vision&quot; or &quot;power&quot;, protects humans from a violent death.
*Muisak – vengeful spirit, which surfaces when a person carrying an Arutam spirit is murdered.

To block a Muisak spirit from using its powers, they severed their enemies&#x27; heads and shrank them. The process also served as a way of warning their enemies. Despite these precautions, the owner of the trophy did not keep it for long. Many heads were later used in religious ceremonies and feasts that celebrated the victories of the tribe. Accounts vary as to whether the heads were discarded or stored.

== Trade ==
When Westerner curio collectors created an economic incentive for shrunken heads, there was a sharp increase in the rate of killings in an effort to supply tourists and collectors of ethnographic items. The terms &#x27;headhunting&#x27; and &#x27;headhunting parties&#x27; come from this practice.

Guns were usually what the Shuar acquired in exchange for their shrunken heads, the rate being one gun per head. But weapons were not the only items exchanged. Around 1910, shrunken heads were being sold by a curio shop in Lima for one Peruvian gold pound, equal in value to a British gold sovereign. In 1919, the price in Panama&#x27;s curio shop for shrunken heads had risen to £5. By the 1930s, when heads were freely exchanged, a shrunken head could be purchased for about 25 U.S. dollars. This was stopped when the Peruvian and Ecuadorian governments cooperated to outlaw head trafficking.

Also encouraged by this trade, people in Colombia and Panama unconnected to the Jívaros began to make counterfeit &quot;tsantsas&quot;. They used corpses from morgues, or the heads of monkeys or sloths. Some used goatskin. Kate Duncan wrote in 2001, &quot;It has been estimated that about 80 percent of the tsantsas in private and museum hands are fraudulent&quot;, including almost all that are female or include an entire torso rather than just a head.

Thor Heyerdahl recounts in &quot;The Kon-Tiki Expedition&quot; (1948) the various problems of getting into the Jívaro (Shuar) area in Ecuador to get balsa wood for his expedition raft. Local people would not guide his team into the jungle for fear of being killed and having their heads shrunk. In 1951 and 1952 sales of such items in London were being advertised in &quot;The Times&quot;; one example was priced at $250, a hundredfold appreciation since the early 20th century.

In 1999, the National Museum of the American Indian repatriated the authentic shrunken heads in its collection to Ecuador. Most other countries have also banned the trade. Currently, replica shrunken heads are manufactured as curios for the tourist trade. These are made from leather and animal hides formed to resemble the originals. In 2019 Mercer University repatriated a shrunken head from its collections, crediting the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act as inspiration.

In 2020, Oxford University&#x27;s Pitt Rivers Museum removed its collection of shrunken heads after an ethical review begun in 2017, as part of an effort to decolonize its collections and avoid stereotyping.

== In popular culture ==
In the novel &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, the character Queequeg sells shrunken heads and gives his last as a gift to the narrator, Ishmael, who subsequently sells it himself.

In the 1949 children&#x27;s novel &quot;Amazon Adventure&quot; by Willard Price, the character John Hunt buys a shrunken head for the American Museum of Natural History from a Jivaro chief, who explains the shrinking process. The scene mirrors Price&#x27;s own experience with the Jivaro, described in his 1948 travel book &quot;Roving South&quot;.

In 1955, Disneyland opened its Jungle Cruise ride. Until 2021, the attraction featured a trader selling shrunken heads (three of his for one of yours).

In 1975, Whiting (a Milton Bradley company) released &quot;Vincent Price&#x27;s Shrunken Head Apple Sculpture Kit&quot;.

In the 1946 movie &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Mask&quot;, a crashed plane with a shrunken head aboard is the only clue to a mystery involving a secret code.

The 1988 movie &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; featured a ghost of a hunter whose head had been shrunken. At the end of the movie, the title character suffers the same fate. The film&#x27;s 2024 sequel, &quot;Beetlejuice Beetlejuice&quot;, features the return of the hunter with the shrunken head, named Bob, alongside many other ghosts with shrunken heads now employed at Betelgeuse&#x27;s personal call centre.

One of the North American television commercials for the 1990 video game &quot;Dr. Mario&quot; featured head shrinking, as well as a cover of the song &quot;Witch Doctor&quot; with slightly different lyrics.

The &quot;Goosebumps&quot; book, &quot;How I Got My Shrunken Head&quot;, released in 1996, is about a boy who gets a shrunken head from his aunt that gives him jungle powers.

In the 2004 film adaptation of &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;, Lenny Henry voices Dre Head, a Jamaican accented shrunken head on the magical Knight Bus. The same film features three more shrunken heads, voiced by Brian Bowles and Peter Serafinowicz, inside the wizard pub The Three Broomsticks.

Both &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; (2006) and &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot; (2007) feature shrunken heads.

<doc id="665435" wikidata="Q4744404" url="?curid=665435" title="American Mathematics Competitions">
<text>The American Mathematics Competitions (AMCs) are the first of a series of competitions in secondary school mathematics sponsored by the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) that determine the United States of America&#x27;s team for the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). The selection process takes place over the course of roughly five stages. At the last stage, the US selects six members to form the IMO team.

There are three AMC competitions held each year:
* the AMC 8, for students under the age of 14.5 and in grades 8 and below
* the AMC 10, for students under the age of 17.5 and in grades 10 and below
* the AMC 12, for students under the age of 19.5 and in grades 12 and below&lt;ref name=&quot;10/12&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The AMC 8 tests mathematics through the 8th grade curriculum. Similarly, the AMC 10 and AMC 12 test mathematics through the 10th and 12th grade curriculum, respectively.

Before the 1999-2000 academic year, the AMC 8 was known as the AJHSME (American Junior High School Mathematics Examination), and the AMC 12 was known as the AHSME (American High School Mathematics Examination). There was no AMC 10 prior to the 1999-2000 academic year.

Students who perform well on the AMC 10 or AMC 12 competitions are invited to participate in the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME). Students who perform exceptionally well on the AMC 12 and AIME are invited to the United States of America Mathematical Olympiad (USAMO), while students who perform exceptionally well on the AMC 10 and AIME are invited to United States of America Junior Mathematical Olympiad (USAJMO). Students who do exceptionally well on the USAMO (typically around 45 students based on score and grade level) and USAJMO (typically around the top 15 students) are invited to attend the Mathematical Olympiad Program (MOP).

==History==

The AMC contest series includes the American Mathematics Contest 8 (AMC 8) (formerly the American Junior High School Mathematics Examination) for students in grades 8 and below, begun in 1985; the American Mathematics Contest 10 (AMC 10), for students in grades 10 and below, begun in 2000; the American Mathematics Contest 12 (AMC 12) (formerly the American High School Mathematics Examination) for students in grades 12 and below, begun in 1950; the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME), begun in 1983; and the USA Mathematical Olympiad (USAMO), begun in 1972.

==Rules and scoring==
===AMC 8===

The AMC 8 is a 25 multiple-choice question, 40-minute competition designed for middle schoolers. No problems require the use of a calculator, and their use has been banned since 2008. Since 2022, the competition has been held in January. The AMC 8 is a standalone competition; students cannot qualify for the AIME via their AMC 8 score alone.

The AMC 8 is scored based on the number of questions answered correctly. There is no penalty for getting a question wrong, and each question has equal value. Thus, a student who answers 23 questions correctly and 2 questions incorrectly receives a score of 23. 
====Rankings and awards====

Ranking

Based on questions correct:
* Distinguished Honor Roll: Top 1% (has ranged from 19–24)
* Honor Roll: Top 5% (has ranged from 19-23) 

Awards
* A Certificate of Distinction is given to all students who receive a perfect score.
* An AMC 8 Winner Pin is given to the student(s) in each school with the highest score.
* The top three students for each school section will receive respectively a gold, silver, or bronze Certificate for Outstanding Achievement.
* An AMC 8 Honor Roll Certificate is given to all high scoring students.
* An AMC 8 Merit Certificate is given to high scoring students who are in 6th grade or below.

===AMC 10 and AMC 12===

The AMC 10 and AMC 12 are 25 question, 75-minute multiple choice competitions in secondary school mathematics containing problems which can be understood and solved with precalculus concepts. The AMC 10 and AMC 12 are held annually in November. Calculators have not been allowed on the AMC 10/12 since 2008.

High scores on the AMC 10 or 12 can qualify the participant for the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME). 

The competitions are scored based on the number of questions answered correctly and the number of questions left blank. A student receives 6 points for each question answered correctly, 1.5 points for each question left blank, and 0 points for incorrect answers. Thus, a student who answers 24 correctly, leaves 1 blank, and misses 0 gets formula_1 points. The maximum possible score is formula_2 points. In 2020, the AMC 12 had a total of 18 perfect scores between its two administrations, and the AMC 10 also had 18.

From 1974 until 1999, the competition (then known as the American High School Math Examination, or AHSME) had 30 questions and was 90 minutes long, scoring 5 points for correct answers. Originally during this time, 1 point was awarded for leaving an answer blank, however, it was changed in the late 1980s to 2 points. When the competition was shortened as part of the 2000 rebranding from AHSME to AMC, the value of a correct answer was increased to 6 points and the number of questions reduced to 25 (keeping 150 as a perfect score). In 2001, the score of a blank was increased to 2.5 to penalize guessing. The 2007 competitions were the first with only 1.5 points awarded for a blank, to discourage students from leaving a large number of questions blank in order to assure qualification for the AIME. For example, prior to this change, on the AMC 12, a student could advance with only 11 correct answers, presuming the remaining questions were left blank. After the change, a student must answer 14 questions correctly to reach 100 points.

The competitions have historically overlapped to an extent, with the medium-hard AMC 10 questions usually being the same as the medium-easy ones on the AMC 12. Problem 18 on the 2022 AMC 10A was the same as problem 18 on the 2022 AMC 12A. Since 2002, two AMC 10/12&#x27;s are offered annually (known as the AMC 10/12A and AMC 10/12B) Students are eligible to compete in an A competition and a B competition, (e.g., the AMC 10A and the AMC 12B), though they may not take both the AMC 10 and AMC 12 from the same date. If a student participates in both competitions, they may use either score towards qualification to the AIME or USAMO/USAJMO. In 2021, the competition format was changed to occur in the Fall instead of the Spring.

<text>The makeup of poker&#x27;s dead man&#x27;s hand has varied through the years. Currently, it is described as a two-pair poker hand consisting of the black aces and black eights. The pair of aces and eights, along with an unknown hole card, were reportedly held by Old West folk hero, lawman, and gunfighter Wild Bill Hickok when he was murdered while playing a game. No contemporaneous source, however, records the exact cards he held when killed. Author Frank Wilstach&#x27;s 1926 book, &quot;Wild Bill Hickok: The Prince of Pistoleers&quot;, led to the popular modern held conception of the poker hand&#x27;s contents.

==Use of the phrase==
The expression, &quot;dead man&#x27;s hand&quot;, appears to have had some currency in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, although no one connected it to Hickok until the 1920s. The earliest detailed reference to it was 1886, where it was described as a &quot;full house consisting of three jacks and a pair of tens&quot; ( ). Three jacks and red sevens ( ) are called the dead man&#x27;s hand in the 1903 &quot;Encyclopaedia of Superstitions, Folklore, and the Occult Sciences&quot;. The 1907 edition of &quot;Hoyle&#x27;s Games&quot; refers to the hand as jacks and eights ( ).

==Hickok&#x27;s hand==

What is currently considered the dead man&#x27;s hand card combination received its notoriety from a legend that it was the five-card stud or five-card draw hand, held by Wild Bill Hickok when he was shot in the back of the head by Jack McCall on August 2, 1876, in Nuttal &amp; Mann&#x27;s Saloon, Deadwood, Dakota Territory. Hickok&#x27;s final hand purportedly included the aces and eights of both black suits.

According to a book by Western historian Carl W. Breihan, the cards were retrieved from the floor by a man named Neil Christy, who then passed them on to his son. The son, in turn, told Mr. Breihan of the composition of the hand. &quot;Here is an exact identity of these cards as told to me by Christy&#x27;s son: the ace of spades with a heel mark on it; the ace of clubs; the two black eights, clubs and spades, and the queen of hearts with a small drop of Hickok&#x27;s blood on it&quot;, (A♠ A♣ 8♠ 8♣ ) though nothing of the sort was reported at the time immediately following the shooting.

Hickok biographer Joseph Rosa wrote about the make-up of the hand: &quot;The accepted version is that the cards were the ace of spades, the ace of clubs, two black eights, and the queen of clubs as the &#x27;kicker&#x27;.&quot; (A♠ A♣ 8♠ 8♣ Q♣) Rosa, however, said that no contemporaneous source can be found for this exact hand. The solidification in gamers&#x27; parlance of the dead man&#x27;s hand as two pairs, black aces and eights, did not come about until after the 1926 publication of Wilstach&#x27;s book—50 years after Hickok&#x27;s death.

==Legacy==
The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Homicide Division, the Los Angeles Police Department CRASH squad, and the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System all use some variation of the aces and eights dead man&#x27;s hand in their insignia. The Deadwood Police Department uses it as a patch on their uniforms.

<doc id="665443" wikidata="Q57446" url="?curid=665443" title="Pranab Mukherjee">
<text>Pranab Kumar Mukherjee ( ; born, 11 December 1935 – 31 August 2020) was an Indian politician who served as the president of India from 2012 until 2017. He was the first person from West Bengal to hold the post of President of India. In a political career spanning five decades, Mukherjee was a senior leader in the Indian National Congress and occupied several ministerial portfolios in the Government of India. Prior to his election as President, Mukherjee was Finance Minister from 2009 to 2012. He was awarded India&#x27;s highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna, in 2019, by his successor as president, Ram Nath Kovind.

Mukherjee got his break in politics in 1969 when the then prime minister Indira Gandhi helped him get elected to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of Parliament of India, on a Congress ticket. Following a meteoric rise, he became one of Gandhi&#x27;s most trusted lieutenants and a minister in her cabinet in 1973. Mukherjee&#x27;s service in a number of ministerial capacities culminated in his first stint as Finance Minister of India in 1982–84. He was also the Leader of the House in the Rajya Sabha from 1980 to 1985.

Mukherjee was sidelined from Congress during the premiership of Rajiv Gandhi. Mukherjee had viewed himself and not the inexperienced Rajiv, as the rightful successor to Indira following her assassination in 1984. Mukherjee lost out in the ensuing power struggle. He formed his own party, the Rashtriya Samajwadi Congress, which merged with Congress in 1989 after reaching a consensus with Rajiv Gandhi. After Rajiv Gandhi&#x27;s assassination in 1991, Mukherjee&#x27;s political career was revived when prime minister P. V. Narasimha Rao appointed him Planning Commission head in 1991 and foreign minister in 1995. Following this, as an elder statesman of Congress, Mukherjee was the principal architect of Sonia Gandhi&#x27;s ascent to the party&#x27;s presidency in 1998.

When the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) came to power in 2004, Mukherjee won a Lok Sabha (the popularly elected lower house of Parliament) seat for the first time. From then until his resignation in 2012, he held a number of key cabinet portfolios in prime minister Manmohan Singh&#x27;s governmentDefence (2004–06), External Affairs (2006–09), and Finance (2009–12)apart from heading several Groups of Ministers (GoMs) and being Leader of the House in the Lok Sabha. After securing the UPA&#x27;s nomination for the country&#x27;s presidency in July 2012, Mukherjee comfortably defeated P. A. Sangma of NDA in the 2012 Indian presidential election, winning 70 per cent of the electoral-college vote.

In 2017, Mukherjee decided not to run for re-election and to retire from politics after leaving the presidency due to &quot;health complications relating to old age.&quot; His term expired on 25 July 2017. He was succeeded as president by Ram Nath Kovind. In June 2018, Mukherjee became the first former President of India to address a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) event.

==Early life and education==
Pranab Mukherjee was born on 11 December 1935 during the British Colonial rule, into a Bengali Brahmin family in Mirati, a village in the Bengal Presidency (now in Birbhum district, West Bengal). His father, Kamada Kinkar Mukherjee, was active participant in the Indian independence movement and was a member of the West Bengal Legislative Council between 1952 and 1964 as a representative of the Indian National Congress; he was also a member of AICC. His mother was Rajlakshmi Mukherjee. He had two siblings: older sister Annapurna Banarjee (1928–2020) and older brother Piyush Mukherjee (1931–2017).

Mukherjee attended Suri Vidyasagar College in Suri (Birbhum), which was then affiliated to the University of Calcutta. He subsequently earned an MA degree in political science and history and an LL.B. degree, both from the University of Calcutta

He was an upper-division Clerk in the Office of the Deputy Accountant-General (Post and Telegraph) in Calcutta. In 1963, he became a lecturer (Assistant Professor) of Political Science at Vidyanagar College, affiliated to the University of Calcutta and he also worked as a journalist at &quot;Desher Dak&quot; (Call of the Motherland) before entering politics.

==Political career==
Mukherjee started his political career in 1967 as a founding member of the Bangla Congress. Ahead of the 1967 election, he played a crucial role in forging the United Front alliance against the Indian National Congress. In 1969, he managed the successful Midnapore by-election campaign of an independent candidate, V. K. Krishna Menon. He became a member of the Rajya Sabha (the upper house of Indian parliament) in July 1969 on a Bangla Congress ticket. Mukherjee soon became the medium of exchanging confidential notes between Indira Gandhi and Ajoy Mukherjee. In 1972, Indira Gandhi recruited him to the Indian National Congress along with merging the Bangla Congress into the party. Mukherjee was re-elected to the house in 1975, 1981, 1993, and 1999.

He became an Indira loyalist and was often described as her &quot;man for all seasons.&quot; Mukherjee&#x27;s rise was rapid in the early phase of his career and he was appointed Union Deputy Minister of Industrial Development in Indira Gandhi&#x27;s cabinet in 1973. He was active in the Indian cabinet during the controversial Internal Emergency of 1975–77. Ruling Congress politicians of the day including Mukherjee were accused of using extra-constitutional powers to &quot;wreck established norms and rules of governance&quot;. Following Congress&#x27;s defeat in the 1977 general elections, the newly formed Janata government-appointed Shah Commission indicted Mukherjee; however, the commission was itself indicted in 1979 for stepping &quot;outside its jurisdiction&quot;. Mukherjee emerged unscathed and rose through a series of cabinet posts to become Finance Minister from 1982 to 1984.

His term was noted for his work in improving the finances of the government, which enabled Gandhi to score a political point by returning the last instalment of India&#x27;s first IMF loan. As Finance Minister, Mukherjee signed the letter appointing Manmohan Singh as Governor of the Reserve Bank of India.
In 1979, Mukherjee became Deputy Leader of the INC in the Rajya Sabha, and in 1980, he was appointed Leader of the House. He was considered the top-ranking Indian cabinet minister and he presided over cabinet meetings in the absence of the Prime Minister.

Mukherjee was sidelined from the INC following the assassination of Indira Gandhi. Although he was much more experienced in politics than Indira&#x27;s son, Rajiv Gandhi, it was Rajiv who gained control. Mukherjee lost his position in the cabinet and was sent to manage the regional West Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee. He was considered to be Indira&#x27;s likely successor and, siding with those within his party who aligned themselves against Rajiv Gandhi, Mukherjee was sidelined and eventually expelled from the mainstream.

In 1986, Mukherjee founded another party, the Rashtriya Samajwadi Congress (RSC), in West Bengal. The RSC and INC merged three years later after a compromise was reached with Rajiv Gandhi. The RSC had fared terribly in the 1987 Assembly polls in West Bengal. Many analysts, over the years, have attributed the muting of Mukherjee&#x27;s political aspirations as the supreme leader to his inability to emerge as a magnetic mass leader. On later being asked whether he ever desired to become Prime Minister, Mukherjee replied, &quot;7 RCR was never my destination.&quot; Zee News noted: &quot;The statement assumes heft in the light of the longstanding speculation that Mukherjee, as one of the doyens of Congress, always nursed an ambition to occupy the top executive post&quot;.

Mukherjee&#x27;s political career revived following the Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi in 1991, when P. V. Narasimha Rao chose to appoint him as deputy chairman of the Indian Planning Commission and subsequently as a union cabinet minister. He served as External Affairs Minister from 1995 to 1996 in Rao&#x27;s cabinet.

Mukherjee was considered to be a Gandhi family loyalist and the principal architect of Sonia Gandhi&#x27;s entry into politics, a mentoring responsibility he was believed to have continued shouldering. He was made General Secretary of the AICC in 1998–99 after Sonia Gandhi became Congress President. Mukherjee was made President of the West Bengal Congress in 2000 and held the position until his resignation in 2008. He had earlier held the position in 1985.

Mukherjee became Leader of the House in the Lok Sabha in 2004. He contested and won a Lok Sabha seat from Jangipur in West Bengal, which he would later retain in 2009. It was speculated in 2004 that Mukherjee would be made Prime Minister of India after Sonia Gandhi declined to become Prime Minister; however, Manmohan Singh was chosen instead.

Mukherjee was briefly considered for the post of the largely ceremonial Indian presidency in 2007, but his name was subsequently dropped after his contribution to the Union Cabinet was considered practically indispensable.

He held many important posts in the Manmohan Singh government: He had the distinction of being the minister for various high-profile ministries, including Defence, Finance, and External Affairs. Apart from being Leader of the House in the Lok Sabha and Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee President, he also headed the Congress Parliamentary Party and the Congress Legislative Party, which consist of all the Congress MP&#x27;s and MLA&#x27;s in the country.

Mukherjee ended his affiliation with the Indian National Congress and retired from active political life following his election as president in 2012. &quot;The Economic Times&quot; had noted: &quot;[the] decades of activity in critical all-rounder roles make [Mukherjee&#x27;s] exit both a structural and generation shift. With him, the last of the Congress triumviratealong with Rao and R. Venkataramanwho formed the core team of Indira/Rajiv regimes bows out. While Rao became PM, Pranab&#x27;s political marathon too ends where Venkataraman&#x27;s did, at the Rashtrapati Bhavan&quot;.

===Political party role===
Mukherjee was &quot;very well respected within the party social circles&quot;. Media accounts describe him as having &quot;a reputation as a number-crunching politician with a phenomenal memory and an unerring survival instinct&quot;.

He became a member of the Congress Working Committee on 27 January 1978. He also became a member of the Central Parliamentary Board of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) that year. Mukherjee briefly held the position of treasurer of the AICC and the Congress party in 1978.

He was appointed chairman of the Campaign Committee of the AICC for conducting National Elections to Parliament in 1984, 1991, 1996, and 1998. He was chairman of the Central Election Coordination Committee of the AICC from 28 June 1999 to 2012. He was appointed to the Central Election Committee on 12 December 2001. Mukherjee was appointed General Secretary of the AICC in 1998. In 1997, he was voted Outstanding Parliamentarian by the Indian Parliamentary Group.

After Sonia Gandhi reluctantly agreed to join politics, Mukherjee was one of her mentors, guiding her through difficult situations with examples of how her mother-in-law, Indira Gandhi, would have done things. His talents were on display during the negotiations for the Patents Amendment Bill in early 2005. Congress was committed to passing an IP bill, but their allies in the United Progressive Alliance from the Left front had a long tradition of opposing some of the monopoly aspects of intellectual property. Mukherjee, as Defence Minister, was not formally involved but was roped in for his negotiation skills. He drew on many old allies including the CPI-M leader Jyoti Basu (former Chief Minister of West Bengal), and formed new intermediary positions, which included product patents. Then, he had to convince his own colleagues, including commerce minister Kamal Nath, who at one point said...&quot;An imperfect legislation is better than no legislation&quot;. Finally, on 23 March 2005, the bill was approved.

&quot;India Today&quot; wrote that Mukherjee&#x27;s role in &quot;skillfully pushing through the historic 123 Agreement and treaty with the Nuclear Suppliers Group&quot; may have saved the UPA-II government from the 2008 motion of no confidence.

Mukherjee played a crucial role in steering the Cabinet pre-Lok Sabha elections when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh underwent a heart bypass surgery in 2008–09 by taking additional charges as chairman of the Cabinet Committee of Political Affairs and Union Minister in the Finance Ministry despite already being Union Minister of External Affairs.

Mukherjee&#x27;s political skills and long experience in government have also led him to head a large number of committees of ministers in the government. At the time of his resignation, on being nominated as the UPA&#x27;s presidential candidate, Mukherjee was heading several Groups of Ministers (GoMs) and Empowered Groups of Ministers (EGoMs).

==Union Cabinet Minister==
===Minister of Defence===
 
Manmohan Singh appointed Mukherjee as the Minister of Defence of India when the Congress Party once again came to power in 2004. Mukherjee held the post until 2006. He expanded cooperation with the United States during his tenure. &quot;The Times of India&quot; reported on the United States diplomatic cables leak release and noted how the U.S. was full of praise for the &quot;uniformed leadership&quot; of Indian armed forces. In June 2005, Mukherjee inked the ten-year Indo-US Defence Framework deal.

Despite increasing co-operation with the United States, Mukherjee maintained that Russia would remain India&#x27;s &#x27;topmost&#x27; defence partner. He asserted that &quot;Russia has been and will remain India&#x27;s largest defence partner in the years to come&quot; while inaugurating the 5th session of the Indo-Russian Inter-Governmental Commission on Military-Technical Cooperation (IRIGC-MTC) in Moscow in 2005.

Russia and India held their first joint anti-terror war games in Rajasthan in October 2005, during which Mukherjee and Russian Defence Minister Sergei Ivanov narrowly escaped injury after a heavy mortar landed several metres from their platform. The Russian ministry subsequently declared its hopes to follow up joint military exercises in India with further joint exercises on Russian territory.

===Minister of External Affairs===
Mukherjee was appointed External Affairs Minister of India in 1995. Under his leadership, India was made &quot;Full Dialogue Partner&quot; of ASEAN as part of the Look East foreign policy initiated by Narasimha Rao. Mukherjee left the position in 1996.

His second term began in 2006. He oversaw the successful signing of the U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Agreement with the U.S. government and then with the Nuclear Suppliers Group, allowing India to participate in civilian nuclear trade in spite of not having signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Mukherjee played a crucial role in mobilising world opinion against Pakistan after the 2008 Mumbai attacks. He left the position a year later to take over the Finance Ministry of India.

When asked what legacy he wanted to leave behind as Foreign Minister of India, Mukherjee replied, &quot;As the [man] who prepared Indian diplomacy to address the challenges of a more globalised, interdependent and uncertain world&quot;.

===Minister of Commerce and Industry===
Mukherjee thrice served as Commerce Minister of India. His first stints were in the Indira Gandhi government from 1980 to 1982 and again in 1984. His third stint in the 1990s saw him contribute significantly to the negotiations which led to the establishment of the World Trade Organization.

===Minister of Finance===

Mukherjee&#x27;s first stint as the Finance Minister of India was during the Indira Gandhi government in 1982. He presented his first annual budget in 1982–83. His first term was noted for the work he did to improve the finances of the government and for successfully returning the last instalment of India&#x27;s first 
IMF loan. Mukherjee signed the letter appointing Manmohan Singh as the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India in 1982. He was accused of patronage practices in the Ambani–Wadia industrial feuds.

Mukherjee was credited with being an early reformer of the Indian economy. &quot;India Today&quot; wrote: &quot;Operation Forward, which [Mukherjee] and then Industries Minister Charanjit Chanana launched in the early 1980s, started the liberalisation process that flowered under Rao and Manmohan Singh&quot;. A Left-wing magazine once commented that &quot;socialism did not grow out of the pipe Mukherjee smoked&quot;.

Mukherjee was removed from his position as Finance Minister by Rajiv Gandhi in 1984. Gandhi had wished to bring in his own team of staff to govern India. Mukherjee was replaced even though he was rated as the best Finance Minister in the World that year according to a survey by Euromoney magazine.

He returned to handling the finances of India during the premiership of Narasimha Rao, after being appointed Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission. During Mukherjee&#x27;s tenure of 1991 to 1996, Manmohan Singh as Finance Minister oversaw many economic reforms to end the Licence Raj system and help open the Indian economy.
Mukherjee once again became the Finance Minister of India in 2009. He presented the annual budgets in 2009, 2010, and 2011. The 2010–11 budget included the country&#x27;s first explicit target to cut public debt as a proportion of the GDP and Mukherjee targeted a budget deficit reduction of 4.1% of the GDP in the fiscal year 2012–13, from 6.5% in 2008–09.

He implemented many tax reforms, including scrapping the Fringe Benefits Tax and the Commodities Transaction Tax. He implemented the Goods and Services Tax during his tenure. These reforms were well received by major corporate executives and economists. The introduction of retrospective taxation, however, has been criticised by some economists.
Mukherjee expanded funding for several social sector schemes including the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission. He also supported budget increases for improving literacy and health care. He expanded infrastructure programmes such as the National Highway Development Programme. Electricity coverage was also expanded during his tenure. Mukherjee also reaffirmed his commitment to the principle of fiscal prudence as some economists expressed concern about the rising fiscal deficits during his tenure, the highest since 1991. Mukherjee declared the expansion in government spending was only temporary.

In 2010, he was awarded &quot;Finance Minister of the Year for Asia&quot; by &quot;Emerging Markets&quot;, the daily newspaper of record for the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Mukherjee was praised for &quot;the confidence [he] has inspired in key stakeholders, by virtue of his fuel price reforms, fiscal transparency and inclusive growth strategies&quot;. &quot;The Banker&quot; also recognised him as &quot;Finance Minister of the Year.&quot;

Mukherjee&#x27;s final years at the finance ministry were not considered a success. The NDTV, upon his resignation in June 2012, wrote: &quot;There [had] been a clamour from many quarters for a change in the Finance Ministry, with Mr Mukherjee having faced flak for several decisions where politics seemed to overwhelm economic imperatives&quot;.

===Other positions===
Mukherjee was chairman of the Indian Statistical Institute in Kolkata. He also held the following posts: chairman and president of the Rabindra Bharati University and the Nikhil Bharat Banga Sahitya Sammelan; trustee of the Bangiya Sahitya Parishad and the Bidhan Memorial Trust. He also served on the Planning Board of the Asiatic Society.

==Presidential election==


Mukherjee was nominated as the presidential candidate of the United Progressive Alliance on 15 June 2012 after considerable political intrigue. The elections were scheduled to be conducted on 19 July 2012 and the results were expected to be announced on 22 July 2012. The nominee of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) was P. A. Sangma. To file his nomination for the presidential poll on 28 June, Mukherjee resigned from the government on 26 June 2012.
In the election, Mukherjee received 7,13,763 votes, while Sangma had 3,15,987. In his victory speech, delivered outside his residence before the results were officially announced, he said:
Mukherjee was sworn in by the Chief Justice of India on 25 July 2012, becoming the first Bengali to hold the post of President of India. After being administered the oath of office, he stated that we are in the midst of a fourth world war of terror (the third was the Cold war) and what minutes of peace can achieve cannot be achieved in many years of war.
Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh both congratulated Mukherjee on his election as president. Former Communist leader Somnath Chatterjee termed Mukherjee as one of &quot;the best parliamentarians and statesmen of India&quot; and said the country &quot;has got the most able man for the top job&quot;. Opposition leader Sharad Yadav declared &quot;the nation needed a president like Pranab Mukherjee&quot;. Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit commented and said Mukherjee will be &quot;one of the wisest presidents&quot;. She further marvelled at the fact that parties in the opposition ranks supported Mukherjee. &quot;Even the NDA broke up and wanted to vote for the president to be Pranab Mukherjee&quot;. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was reportedly &quot;shocked&quot; and &quot;upset&quot; at the cross-voting for Mukherjee by its legislative members. However, BJP party president Nitin Gadkari congratulated Mukherjee and said &quot;I extend my hearty congratulations to Pranab Mukherjee on his election today as the new President of India&quot;. Gadkari further declared &quot;I am sure that the country will make further development and progress. I wish him all success and a bright future&quot;.

Zee News noted: &quot;What is striking about [Mukherjee] is that after more than four decades in public life, the Opposition had no ammunition against him after he was declared UPA&#x27;s choice for President. In spite of Team Anna making some noise about him being involved in some corruption cases, it has been more or less an easy ride for Pranab to Raisina Hill. Once when Sonia Gandhi announced his name, most of the allies and the Opposition came on board. Whereas, NDA partner JD(U) saw no merit in opposing him, one of the bitter critics of the Congress Shiv Sena too toed the line a little too easily. This support was not for Congress but for [Mukherjee]&quot;.

==President of India==
Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance, 2013 was promulgated by Pranab Mukherjee on 3February 2013, providing for the amendment of the Indian Penal Code, Indian Evidence Act, and the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 on laws related to sexual offences, in the aftermath of the 2012 Delhi gang rape and murder. As of July 2015, President Mukherjee had rejected 24 mercy pleas including those of Yakub Memon, Ajmal Kasab, and Afzal Guru. Pranab Mukherjee became first President of India to reply all the mercy petitions in his term for the death row inmates and also replying the petitions of former presidents.

In January 2017, Mukherjee announced that he would not contest the 2017 Presidential elections, citing &quot;advanced age and failing health&quot;.

==Personal life==
Pranab Mukherjee married Suvra Mukherjee on 13 July 1957. Suvra Mukherjee was born at Narail, Bengal Presidency, Present Bangladesh. She moved to Kolkata while she was 10 and married Pranab in 1957. The couple had two sons and a daughter. Suvra died on 18 August 2015, aged 74, of heart failure, while Mukherjee was still in office. Their elder son, Abhijit Mukherjee, was a Congress MP from Jangipur, West Bengal, until 2019. He was elected in a by-election after his father vacated the seat. Before his election to the Lok Sabha, Abhijit was an MLA from Nalhati in Birbhum.

Mukherjee was inspired by Deng Xiaoping and quoted him quite frequently. His hobbies were reading, gardening, and music.

His daughter Sharmistha Mukherjee is a Kathak dancer and politician of the Indian National Congress.

Mukherjee celebrated the Durga Puja at his ancestral home in Mirati village. He used to make it a point to be at Mirati village every year to take part in the four-day rituals, the puja having a &quot;social dimension&quot; for him. &quot;I want to avail this opportunity to be with the people of my area&quot;, Mukherjee said during a puja ceremony on 4October 2011.

==Illness and death==
During the COVID-19 pandemic, on 10 August 2020, Mukherjee announced on Twitter that he had tested positive for COVID-19 prior to a surgery to remove a blood clot in his brain. He was admitted to the hospital after accidentally slipping and falling in his bathroom. He was on ventilator support and in critical condition at the Army&#x27;s Research and Referral (R&amp;R) hospital in Delhi.

On 13 August, the hospital reported that Mukherjee was in a deep coma after he underwent brain surgery; however, his vital parameters remained stable. On 19 August, the R&amp;R said that Mukherjee&#x27;s health condition had declined as he had developed a lung infection. On , his renal parameters became &quot;slightly deranged&quot;, with the condition worsening days later.

Mukherjee died on 31 August 2020, aged 84, which was confirmed by his son Abhijit Mukherjee via Twitter. His death came after the attending hospital confirmed that his health had deteriorated early that day, stating that he had been in septic shock since a day earlier, which was caused by his lung infection.

Condolences poured in immediately from citizens and political parties of both India and other nations. India&#x27;s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the President Ram Nath Kovind, Vice-president Venkaiah Naidu, Home Minister Amit Shah, and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi conveyed their condolences via Twitter. The Prince of Wales, President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, the President of Afghanistan, Ashraf Ghani, the President of the Maldives, Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, the Prime Minister of Bhutan, Lotay Tshering, then-Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, Mahinda Rajapaksa, and then-Prime Minister of Nepal, K. P. Sharma Oli, were among foreign leaders who paid their respects. Sports players and actors from the country also voiced their sorrow.

The Government of India announced a seven-day period of state mourning between 31 August to 6 September, whereby the national flag would fly at half mast on all buildings wherever it is flown regularly. The West Bengal state government declared a closure of state-run offices for the following day as a mark of respect.

Mukherjee&#x27;s funeral was held the following day, on 1 September at the Lodi Road crematorium, with full state honours. His body was brought to the crematorium in a van instead of gun carriage due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions in the country. His ashes were immersed into the Ganges river in Haridwar.

== In popular culture ==
Mukherjee appeared in the Indian mock court television talk show () on India TV when he was the Minister of Defence, discussing the UPA government&#x27;s performance of in the past one year since the 2004 elections.

<doc id="665455" wikidata="Q2481558" url="?curid=665455" title="Fin (legend)">
<text>Fin is the subject of a legend involving the construction of a church. To get the work done, an agreement was made between a holy man and a troll or giant with dire consequences for the loser. The Danish version features a troll from Kalundborg, Zealand, Denmark. In the Swedish legend, the subject is a giant from Lund with the name Jätten Finn (&quot;Finn the Giant&quot;).

==Danish legend==

The legend tells how Esbern Snare built a church in Kalundborg. It was hard work, and a troll, who was passing by, offered his services. Esbern accepted; however, the troll&#x27;s condition was that Esbern should be able to figure out the troll&#x27;s name by the time the church was finished; if he could not, the troll would take his heart and his eyes.

When there was only a half pillar left to erect before the church would be completed, Esbern became afraid, because he did not know the troll&#x27;s name. Wandering the fields in great anxiety, he laid himself down on Ulshøj bank to rest. While there, he heard a troll-woman within the hill saying: &quot;Lie still, baby mine! / Tomorrow cometh Fin, / Father thine, And giveth thee / Esbern Snare&#x27;s / eyes and heart / to play with.&quot;

Esbern returned immediately to the church. The troll was busy setting up the half pillar that remained for the church, and when Esbern saw him, he called out &quot;Fin&quot;. The troll was so angry that he threw the half pillar into the air. This is why the church has only three and a half pillars.

==Swedish legend==

A similar legend exists in the Swedish town of Lund, where a troll or giant is supposed to have helped with the construction of Lund Cathedral. Two statues in the crypt of the cathedral are said to be the petrified remains of the legendary creature and his wife. The earliest known mention of the legend as it appears in Lund dates from 1593. The Imperial diplomat Erich Lassota von Steblau had been imprisoned in Sweden and was on his way back to continental Europe when he stopped in Lund and made a passing mention of the legend. Lassota von Steblau writes that the two statues in the crypt of the cathedral were &quot;giants&quot; who tried to prevent the cathedral from being built. They had been punished by God and turned into stone for this.

A more detailed account of the legend was published in 1654 by Jens Lauritzen Wolf. It appears that it&#x27;s this version that has been the basis for most later versions. The legend, as recounted by Wolf, has it that Saint Lawrence was building Lund Cathedral but had a lack of both funds and building material. To speed up the construction he made a deal with the troll. The troll would help him build the cathedral, but if on the last day Saint Lawrence had not found out his name, the saint would have to bring him the sun and the moon. If he couldn&#x27;t do that, the troll would be permitted to take his eyes. With the help of the troll, the construction proceeded rapidly. Saint Lawrence became more and more concerned, and to lessen his anxiety he one day took a long walk outside the city. He sat down to rest, and while resting suddenly overheard the wife of the troll comforting their child, telling him not to cry because his father Finn would bring the eyes of the saint as a toy the next day. Lawrence hurried back and found the troll just about to place the last stone in place in the cathedral. He called him out by his name, Finn. Enraged, Finn and his wife started shaking the foundation pillars in the crypt, but the force of the saint was stronger, and the whole family was petrified, frozen in motion.

A only slightly later account of the legend which is basically consistent with that of Wolf exist in a hand-written manuscript today in the archives of the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities. Another account was made in 1705.

A first critical account dates from 1750, by . Corylander points out that not only is the legend clearly fictional, but that it&#x27;s also improbable that the statues in the cathedral would actually be intended as an illustration of the legend. The construction of the cathedral is in fact well documented, he argued, and both the first architect and the kings who supported its construction are well known. &quot;However superstition has been carried so far, that Saint Lawrence, who lived far more than 800 years before the construction of our cathedral and who could not even have dreamed of Scania, still has had to take the responsibility for its foundation, and an equally innocent troll for its construction&quot;, he is quoted by .

Several later accounts of the legend exist. According to one account available in English, a holy man named Laurentius came to what is now known as Lund from Saxony to build a Christian church. As he began his work, a giant named Finn, who lived with his family in the area called Helgonabacken (or Hills of Helgona), offered to help him construct the church. His offer came with a condition, &quot;when it is finished, you will tell me what my name is. But, mark well my condition, oh, wise man: If you cannot tell me, you must give to my little ones the two small torches -- the sun and the moon -- that travel yonder over heaven&#x27;s expanse.&quot; The holy man would lose his sight if he lost the challenge.

It was known amongst the giants that they could not reveal Finn&#x27;s name or the bargain would be broken, with no harm to Laurentius, and the giant must die. Driven to get the church built, the holy man accepted the offer and had faith that the name would come to him before the construction of the church was completed. Together, they quickly built the church with one remaining stone that needed to be set on the tower.
While Laurentius worried that he did not know the giant&#x27;s name and would therefore lose his sight, he heard the voice of a giant woman as she attempted to soothe her crying child, &quot;Silent, silent, little son of mine. Morning will bring your father Finn, with either moon and sun or the priest Laurentius&#x27; eyes.&quot; The holy man ran to the church and yelled, &quot;Come down, Finn! The stone that now remains we ourselves can set. Come down, Finn, for we no longer need your help!&quot;

Finn became angry and wrapped his arms around a pillar in order to pull it out and destroy the cathedral. His wife and their child also tried to bring down the church, and both Finn and his wife were turned to stone, with their arms wrapped around pillars. There is a sculpture of a stone man hugging a pillar in the Lund Cathedral.

===Statues of Finn and his wife===
As Corylander pointed out in 1750, it&#x27;s improbable that the statues in Lund Cathedral were meant to depict Finn and his wife. Rather, the legend has probably been a popular way to interpret the meaning of the statues. In fact, art historians still are not entirely sure of what subject matter the statues depict. The most commonly held theory today is that the carving represents the biblical figure Samson, who sacrificed himself by toppling the pillars of a Philistine temple.

==Similar legends==
The legend of a bargain to help build a church is associated with other churches in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. The story related to Eskellsätter&#x27;s church of Näs in Värmland, Sweden involves a giant named Kinn falling to his death upon hearing his name by a priest named Eskil. A Norwegian legend involves the troll, Skalle, and the construction of a cathedral in Trondheim. There is also a similar legend of a troll called Wind and Weather, who was installing a cross when St. Olaf called his name.

<text>James Francis Stephens (16 September 1792 – 22 December 1852) was an English entomologist and naturalist. He is known for his 12 volume &quot;Illustrations of British Entomology&quot; (1846) and the &quot;Manual of British Beetles&quot; (1839).

==Early life==
Stephens was born in Shoreham-by-Sea and studied at Christ&#x27;s Hospital. His father was a navy captain William James Stephens (d. 1799) and his mother was Mary Peck (later Mrs Dallinger). He went to school at the Blue Coat School, Hertford and later at Christ&#x27;s Hospital, London. He was then sent to study under Shute Barrington (1734–1826), the bishop of Durham in 1800. He left in 1807 and worked as a clerk in the Admiralty office, Somerset House, from 1807 to 1845 thanks to his uncle Admiral Stephens.

==Entomology==
Stephens took an interest in natural history even as a schoolboy. He wrote a manuscript &quot;Catalogue of British Animals&quot; in 1808. He was elected fellow of the Linnean Society on 17 February 1815, and of the Zoological Society of London in 1826. From 1815 to 1825 he took a great interest in ornithology and contributed to the work of George Shaw (1751-1813). He was granted leave from office to assist William Elford Leach in 1818 to arrange the insect collection at the British Museum. He returned to the Admiralty but troubles with his superiors led him to retire early leading to loss of part of his pension. He then worked unpaid in the British Museum until his death and described as many as 2800 British insect species. He often used a pocket lens rather than a microscope and used a killing bottle with crushed laurel leaves rather than pinning specimens directly as was the practice then.

In 1833, he was a founder of what became the Royal Entomological Society of London. Stephens made a large insect collection, which included many type specimens. In 1822 he married Sarah, daughter of a Captain Roberts. Their children died young. Stephens died at Kennington on 22 December 1852 and was survived by his wife. After his death his insect collection was purchased by the British Museum. His library was bought by Henry Tibbats Stainton (1822–1892) who continued to keep Stephen&#x27;s tradition of keeping the books available to other entomologists on Wednesday evenings. Stainton also published a catalogue of these books &quot;Bibliotheca Stephensiana&quot; (1853).

==Works==
Stephens was the author of
*&quot;General zoology&quot;, or &quot;Systematic natural history&quot; London, Printed for G. Kearsley in part with George Shaw and sole author of the last 6 volumes of the 16 volumes after the death of George Shaw (1800–1826) - I-II Mammalia (1800), III- Amphibia (1802), Pisces (1803-4), VI Insecta (1806), VII-VIII Aves (1809–120, IX-XIV, pt. 1. Aves (J. F. Stephens alone) (1815–26), XIV, pt. 2 General index to the zoology by G. Shaw and J. F. Stephens (1826)
* &quot;Nomenclature of British Insects: Being a Compendious List of Such Species&quot; (1829).
* &quot;A systematic Catalogue of British insects: being an attempt to arrange all the hitherto discovered indigenous insects in accordance with their natural affinities. Containing also the references to every English writer on entomology, and to the principal foreign authors. With all the published British genera to the present time&quot; (1829).

*&quot;Illustrations of British Entomology; or, a synopsis of indigenous insects, containing their generic and specific distinctions; with an account of their metamorphoses, times of appearance, localities, food, and economy, as far as practicable. In ten volumes&quot;. (1828–1846). This work, following an older system of classification, consists of 7 volumes of Mandibulata (insects with chewing mouthparts/mandibles), 4 volumes of Haustellata (insects with sucking mouthparts, such as the Lepidopteran haustellum), and 1 supplementary volume. The plates are coloured by hand, after drawings by C.M. Curtis and John Obadiah Westwood

==Disputes==
Stephens reported that James Rennie (1787–1867) pirated his illustrations in his 1832 &quot;Conspectus of the Butterflies and Moths Found in Britain&quot; and went to court. He however lost and most of his earnings from his book were lost to legal fees. Stephen&#x27;s &quot;Illustrations of British Entomology&quot;, often entitled simply &quot;British Entomology&quot; was in immediate competition with John Curtis&#x27; &quot;British Entomology&quot; (1824–1839). This gave rise to an acrimonious dispute which split the British entomological establishment into opposing factions for over thirty years. They were never reconciled despite Stephen&#x27;s close friend John Obadiah Westwood&#x27;s attempt to heal the rift.

==Charles Darwin==
While at the University of Cambridge, the student Charles Darwin became an enthusiastic insect collector. He sent Stephens records of the rarer insects he had captured, and was delighted when &quot;Illustrations of British entomology&quot; gave him credit for capturing insects described in 33 entries, quoting his words in all but two of the cases. Darwin recalled in his autobiography &quot;No poet ever felt more delight at seeing his first poem published than I did at seeing in Stephen&#x27;s &quot;Illustrations of British Insects&quot; the magic words, &#x27;captured by C. Darwin, Esq.&#x27; &quot;, though the closest wording as published actually appeared slightly differently, as &quot;captured by the Rev. F. W. Hope and C. Darwin, Esq., in North Wales&quot; and &quot;Taken in North Wales by C. Darwin, Esq.&quot;.

<doc id="665460" wikidata="Q11337543" url="?curid=665460" title="History of Pennsylvania">
<text>The history of Pennsylvania stems back thousands of years when the first indigenous peoples occupied the area of present-day Pennsylvania. In 1681, Pennsylvania became an English colony when William Penn received a royal deed from King Charles II of England. However, European activity in the region precedes that date (the area was first colonized by the Dutch in 1643). The area was home to the Lenape, Susquehannocks, Iroquois, Erie, Shawnee, Arandiqiouia, and other American Indian tribes. Most of these tribes were driven off or reduced to remnants as a result of diseases, such as smallpox.

The English took control of the colony in 1667. In 1681, William Penn, a Quaker, established a colony based on religious tolerance; it was settled by many Quakers along with its Philadelphia, its largest city, which was also the first planned city. In the mid-1700s, the colony attracted many German and Scots-Irish immigrants.

While each of the Thirteen Colonies contributed to the American Revolution, Pennsylvania and especially Philadelphia were a center for the early planning and ultimately the formation of rebellion against King George III and the British empire, which was then the most powerful political and military empire in the world.

Philadelphia served as the nation&#x27;s capital for much of the 18th century. During the 19th century, Pennsylvania grew its northwestern, northeastern, and southwestern borders, and Pittsburgh emerged as of the nation&#x27;s largest and most prominent cities for a period of time. The state played an important role in the Union&#x27;s victory in the American Civil War. Following the Civil War, Pennsylvania grew into a Republican stronghold politically and a major manufacturing and transportation center.

During the 20th century, following the Great Depression in the 1930s and World War II in the 1940s, Pennsylvania moved towards the service and financial industries economically and became a swing state politically.

==Native American migration and settlement==
===Native American migration and settlement===

Pennsylvania&#x27;s history of human habitation extends to thousands of years before the foundation of the Province of Pennsylvania. Archaeologists generally believe that the first settlement of the Americas occurred at least 15,000 years ago during the last glacial period, though it is unclear when humans first entered present-day Pennsylvania. There is an open debate in the archaeological community regarding when the ancestors of Native Americans expanded across the two continents to the tip of South America, with the range of estimates being 30,000 and 10,500 years ago. The Meadowcroft Rockshelter contains the earliest known signs of human activity in Pennsylvania, and perhaps all of North America, as it contains the remains of a civilization that existed over 10,000 years ago and possibly pre-dated the Clovis culture. By 1000 C.E., in contrast to their nomadic hunter-gatherer ancestors, the native population of Pennsylvania had developed agricultural techniques and a mixed food economy.

Sources for Pennsylvania&#x27;s prehistory come from a mix of oral history and archaeology, which pushes the known record back another 500 years or so. Before the Iroquois pushed out from the St. Lawrence River region, Pennsylvania appears to have been populated primarily by Algonquians and Siouans. We know from archaeology that the Monongahela had a far more vast territory at the time and the Iroquois Book of Rites shows that there were Siouans along Lake Erie&#x27;s southern shores as well. The Iroquois collectively called them the Alligewi (better written Adegowe), or Mound Builders. It is said that this is where the term Allegheny comes from (Adegoweni). Two groups of migrating Iroquoians moved through the region—an Iroquois related group who spread west along the Great Lakes and a Tuscarora related group who followed the coast straight south. The Eries were the next to split off from the Iroquois and may have once held northwestern Pennsylvania. An offshoot of them crossed the Ohio and fought back the ancient Monongahela, but later merged with the Susquahannocks to form a single, expanded territory. (Europeans later said that they used the terms White Minqua and Black Minqua to differentiate their ancestries from one another.) A whole other Iroquoian tribe, the Petun, are believed to be Huron related and entered the region after, wedging in between the Eries and Iroquois.

By the time that European colonization of the Americas began, several Native American tribes inhabited the region. The Lenape spoke an Algonquian language, and inhabited an area known as the Lenapehoking, which was mostly made up of the state of New Jersey, but incorporated a lot of surrounding area, including eastern Pennsylvania. Their territory ended somewhere between the Delaware and Susquehanna rivers in the state. The Susquehannock spoke an Iroquoian language and held a region spanning from New York to West Virginia, that went from the area surrounding the Susquehanna River all the way to the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers near present-day Pittsburgh.

European disease and constant warfare with several neighbors and groups of Europeans weakened these tribes, and they were grossly outpaced financially as the Hurons and Iroquois blocked them from proceeding into Ohio during the Beaver Wars. As they lost numbers and land, they abandoned much of their western territory and moved closer to the Susquehanna River and the Iroquois and Mohawk to the north. Northwest of the Allegheny River was the Iroquoian Petun, known mostly for their vast Tobacco plantations, although this is believed to be complete fabrication. They were fragmented into three groups during the Beaver Wars, the Petun of New York, the Wyandot of Ohio, and the Tiontatecaga of the Kanawha River in southern West Virginia. Their size was much larger than previously thought, evidenced by Kentatentonga being used on the Jean Louis Baptiste Franquelin map, a known name for Petun, showing them with Pennsylvania bounds and with 19 villages destroyed and the use of Tiontatecaga, mimicking the Petun autonym, Tionontati. South of the Alleghany River was, allegedly, a nation known as the Calicua (probably Kah-dee-kwuh), or Cali. They may have been the same as the Monongahela Culture and very little is known about them, except that they were probably a Siouan culture. Archaeological sites from this time in this region are scarce and the very few historical sources even mention them—most of these sources only coming from those who met Calicua traders further east on the Allegheny.

A tribe known as the Trokwae were said to have settled by the westernmost Susquehannocks along the Ohio River. They may be the same as the Tockwogh, a small Iroquoian tribe from the Delmarva Peninsula (In many surviving Iroquoian languages, &#x27;r&#x27; is silent.). They, however, did not survive the Beaver Wars. During that time, the highly influential Mohawks seceded from the Iroquois Confederacy and the remaining four tribes—Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga and Oneida—began attacking into Ohio, destroying the Petun and other tribes, then the Erie. Later, after their war with the Susquehannocks ended in the 1670s, they pushed straight south from New York and began attacking other tribes of Virginia. In the end, the French pushed the Iroquois back to the Ohio-PA border, where they were finally convinced to sign a peace treaty in 1701. They sold off much of their remaining, extended lands to the English, but kept a large section along the Susquahanna River for themselves, they allowed refugees of other tribes to settle in towns, such as Shamokin, Lenape, Tutelo, Saponi, Piscataway, and Nanticoke. Around the onset of the French-Indian War, the English Ambassador to the Iroquois, William Johnson, was able to repair relations between the Iroquois and Mohawk and the nation re-unified. In the 1750s, the refugee tribes were relocated to New York, where they were roughly reorganized along cultural lines into three new Tutelo, Delaware and Nanticoke tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy.

===Walking Purchase===

In the 1680s, conflicts with the sons of William Penn resulted in the Walking Purchase and after the English conquered the colony of New Netherland, the majority of the Lenape were relocated to northeastern Ohio, immediately prior to that very region being conquered by the French.

Other tribes would pass through, such as the first Shawnee, after they broke away from the Algonquian tribes based in present-day Virginia on the east coast. They soon after merged with other tribes in present-day Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia to form a massive confederacy that held much of the eastern Ohio River Valley until the Shawnee Wars in 1811–1813. Like the other indigenous peoples of the Americas, the Native Americans of Pennsylvania suffered from a massive loss in population caused by disease following the beginning of the Columbian Exchange in 1492. The Monongahela culture of southwestern Pennsylvania suffered such large losses that it was nearly extinct by the time Europeans arrived in the region in the 17th century.

==European colonization==
===European colonization===
Long-term European exploration of the Americas commenced after the 1492 expedition of Christopher Columbus, and the 1497 expedition of John Cabot is credited with discovering continental North America for Europeans. European exploration of North America continued in the 16th century, and the area now known as Pennsylvania was mapped by the French and labeled &quot;L&#x27;arcadia&quot;, or &quot;wooded coast&quot;, during Giovanni da Verrazzano&#x27;s voyage in 1524. Even before large-scale European settlement, the Native American tribes in Pennsylvania engaged in trade with Europeans, and the fur trade was a major motivation for the European colonization of North America. The fur trade also sparked wars among Native American tribes, including the Beaver Wars, which saw the Iroquois Confederacy rise in power. In the 17th century, the Dutch, Swedish, and British all competed for southeastern Pennsylvania, while the French expanded into parts of western Pennsylvania.

In 1638, the Kingdom of Sweden, then one of the great powers in Europe, established the colony of New Sweden in the area of the present-day Mid-Atlantic states. The colony was established by Peter Minuit, the former governor of New Netherland, who established the fur trading colony over the objections of the Dutch. New Sweden extended into modern-day Pennsylvania, and was centered on the Delaware River with a capital at Fort Christina (near Wilmington, Delaware). In 1643, New Sweden Governor Johan Björnsson Printz established Fort Nya Gothenburg, the first European settlement in Pennsylvania, on Tinicum Island. Printz also built his own home, The Printzhof, on the island.

In 1609, the Dutch Republic, in the midst of the Dutch Golden Age, commissioned Henry Hudson to explore North America. Shortly thereafter, the Dutch established the colony of New Netherland to profit from the North American fur trade. In 1655, during the Second Northern War, the Dutch under Peter Stuyvesant captured New Sweden. Although Sweden never again controlled land in the area, several Swedish and Finnish colonists remained, and with their influence came America&#x27;s first log cabins.

The Kingdom of England had established the Colony of Virginia in 1607 and the adjacent Colony of Maryland in 1632. England also claimed the Delaware River watershed based on the explorations of John Cabot, John Smith, and Francis Drake. The English named the Delaware River for Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, the Governor of Virginia from 1610 until 1618. During the Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665–1667), the English took control of the Dutch (and former Swedish) holdings in North America. At the end of the Third Anglo-Dutch War, the 1674 Treaty of Westminster permanently confirmed England&#x27;s control of the region.

Following the voyages of Giovanni da Verrazzano and Jacques Cartier, the French established a permanent colony in New France in the 17th century to exploit the North American fur trade. During the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, the French expanded New France across present day Eastern Canada into the Great Lakes region, and colonized the areas around the Mississippi River as well. New France expanded into western Pennsylvania by the 18th century, as the French built Fort Duquesne to defend the Ohio River valley. With the end of the Swedish and Dutch colonies, the French were the last rivals to the British for control of the region that would become Pennsylvania. France was often allied with Spain, the only other remaining European power with holdings in continental North America. Beginning in 1688 with King William&#x27;s War (part of the Nine Years&#x27; War), France and England engaged in a series of wars for dominance over Northern America. The wars continued until the end of the French and Indian War in 1763, when France lost New France.

===Province of Pennsylvania===

On March 4, 1681, Charles II of England granted the Province of Pennsylvania to William Penn to settle a debt of £16,000 (around £2,100,000 in 2008, adjusting for retail inflation) that the king owed to Penn&#x27;s father. Pennsylvania was one of the two major Restoration colonies. Penn founded a proprietary colony that provided a place of religious freedom for Quakers. Charles named the colony &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; (&quot;Penn&#x27;s woods&quot; in Latin), after the elder Penn, which the younger Penn found embarrassing, as he feared people would think he had named the colony after himself. Penn landed in North America in October 1682, and founded the colonial capital, Philadelphia, that same year.

In addition to English Quakers, Pennsylvania attracted several other ethnic and religious groups, many of whom were fleeing persecution and the religious wars. Welsh Quakers settled a large tract of land north and west of Philadelphia, in what are now Montgomery, Chester, and Delaware counties. This area became known as the &quot;Welsh Tract&quot;, and many cities and towns were named for points in Wales. The colony&#x27;s reputation of religious freedom and tolerance also attracted significant populations of German, Scots-Irish, Scots, and French settlers. Many of the settlers worshiped a brand of Christianity disfavored by the government of their homeland, including Huguenots, Puritans, Calvinists, Mennonites, and Catholics, who migrated to colonial-era Pennsylvania to exercise their religion freely. Other groups, including Anglicans and Jews, migrated to Pennsylvania, while Pennsylvania also had a significant African-American population by 1730. Additionally, several Native American tribes lived in the area under their own jurisdiction. Settlers of Swedish and Dutch colonies that had been taken over by the British continued to live in the region.

To give his new province access to the ocean, Penn had leased the proprietary rights of the King Charles II&#x27;s brother, James, Duke of York, to the &quot;three lower counties&quot; (now the state of Delaware) on the Delaware River. In Penn&#x27;s &quot;Frame of Government of 1682&quot;, Penn established a combined assembly by providing for equal membership from each county and requiring legislation to have the assent of both the Lower Counties and the Upper Counties. The meeting place for the assembly alternated between Philadelphia and New Castle. In 1704, after disagreements between the upper and lower counties, the lower counties began meeting in a separate assembly. Province of Pennsylvania and Delaware continued to share the same royal governor until the American Revolutionary War, when both Pennsylvania and Delaware became states.

Penn died in 1718, and was succeeded as proprietor of the colony by his sons. While Penn had won the respect of the Lenape for his honest dealing, Penn&#x27;s sons and agents were less sensitive to Native American concerns. The 1737 Walking Purchase expanded the colony, but caused a decline in relations with the Lenape. Pennsylvania continued to expand and settle in the areas to the West until the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which forbade all settlers from settling on the western side of the Appalachian Mountains. Meanwhile, Philadelphia became an important port and trading center. The University of Pennsylvania was founded during this period, and Benjamin Franklin established various other organizations such as the American Philosophical Society, the Union Fire Company, and the Pennsylvania Abolition Society. By the start of the American Revolution, Philadelphia was the largest city in British North America.

The western portions of Pennsylvania were among disputed territory between the colonial British and French during the French and Indian War (the North American component of the Seven Years&#x27; War). The French had established numerous fortified sites in Pennsylvania, including Fort Le Boeuf, Fort Presque Isle, Fort Machault, and the pivotal Fort Duquesne, located near the present site of Pittsburgh. Many Indian tribes were allied with the French because of their long trading history and opposition to the expansion of the British colonies. The conflict began near the present site of Uniontown, Pennsylvania when a company of Virginia militia under the command of George Washington ambushed a French force at the Battle of Jumonville Glen in 1754. Washington retreated to Fort Necessity and surrendered to a larger French force at the Battle of Fort Necessity. In 1755, the British sent Braddock Expedition to capture Fort Duquesne, but the expedition ended in failure after the British lost the Battle of the Monongahela near present-day Braddock, Pennsylvania. In 1758, the British sent the Forbes Expedition to capture Fort Duquesne. The French won the Battle of Fort Duquesne, but after the battle the outnumbered French force demolished Fort Duquesne and retreated from the area. Fighting in North America had mostly come to an end by 1760, but the war continued until the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1763. Britain&#x27;s victory in the war helped secure Pennsylvania&#x27;s frontier, as the Ohio Country came under formal British control. Although New France was no more, the French would deal their British rivals a major blow in the American Revolution by aiding the rebel cause.

During the French and Indian War, Pennsylvania settlers experienced raids from Indian allies of the French. The settlers&#x27; pleas for military relief were stymied by a power struggle in Philadelphia between Governor Robert Morris and the Pennsylvania Assembly. Morris wanted to send military forces to the frontier, but the Assembly, whose leadership included Benjamin Franklin, refused to grant the funds unless Morris agreed to the taxation of the proprietary lands, the vast tracts still owned by the Penn family and others. The dispute was finally settled, and military relief sent, when the owners of the proprietary lands sent 5,000 pounds to the colonial government, on condition that it was considered a free gift and not a down payment on taxes.

Shortly after the end of the French and Indian War, Indians attempted to drive the British out of Ohio country in Pontiac&#x27;s Rebellion. The war, which began in 1763, saw heavy fighting in western Pennsylvania. The native forces were defeated in the Battle of Bushy Run. The war lasted until 1766, when the British made peace. During the war, the king issued the Proclamation Act. The act barred Americans from any settling west of the Appalachians, and reserved that territory for the Native Americans. Fighting between Native Americans and Americans in present-day Pennsylvania continued in Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War and the Revolutionary War. Native American tribes ceased to pose a military threat to European settlers in Pennsylvania after the conclusion of the Northwest Indian War in 1795.

By the mid-18th century Pennsylvania was basically a middle-class colony with limited deference to the small upper-class. A writer in the &quot;Pennsylvania Journal&quot; in 1756 summed it up:
:The People of this Province are generally of the middling Sort, and at present pretty much upon a Level. They are chiefly industrious Farmers, Artificers or Men in Trade; they enjoy and are fond of Freedom, and the &quot;meanest among them&quot; thinks he has a right to Civility from the greatest.

==American Revolution==

Pennsylvania&#x27;s residents generally supported the protests common to all Thirteen Colonies after the Proclamation of 1763 and the Stamp Act were passed, and Pennsylvania sent delegates to the Stamp Act Congress in 1765 Philadelphia hosted the first and second Continental Congress.

Gathered in the present-day Independence Hall in Philadelphia, the Second Continental Congress founded the Continental Army, appointed George Washington as its commander, and, on July 4, 1776, unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence, which both formalized and escalated the American Revolutionary War.

Pennsylvania was the site of several battles and military activities during the Revolutionary War, including George Washington&#x27;s crossing of the Delaware River, the Battle of Brandywine, and the Battle of Germantown. During the Philadelphia campaign, the rebel army of George Washington spent the winter of 1777–78 at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. In 1781, the Articles of Confederation were written and adopted in York, Pennsylvania, and Philadelphia continued to serve as the capital of the fledgling nation until the Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783. Notable Pennsylvanians who supported the Revolution include John Dickinson, Robert Morris, Anthony Wayne, Samuel Van Leer, James Wilson, and Thomas Mifflin. However, Pennsylvania was also home to numerous Loyalists, including Joseph Galloway, William Allen, and the Doan Outlaws.

After elections in May 1776 returned old guard Assemblymen to office, the Second Continental Congress encouraged Pennsylvania to call delegates together to discuss a new form of governance. Delegates met in June in Philadelphia, where the signing of the Declaration of Independence soon overtook assemblymen&#x27;s efforts to control the delegates and the outcome of their discussions. On July 8, 1776, attendees elected delegates to write a state constitution. A committee was formed with Benjamin Franklin as chair and George Bryan and James Cannon as prominent members. The new constitution on September 28, 1776, called for new elections.

Elections in 1776 turned the old assemblymen out of power. But the new constitution lacked a governor or upper legislative house to provide checks against popular movements. It also required test oaths, which kept the opposition from taking office. The constitution called for a unicameral legislature or Assembly. Executive authority rested in a &quot;Supreme Executive Council&quot; whose members were to be appointed by the assembly. During elections in 1776, radicals gained control of the Assembly. By early 1777, they had selected an executive council, and Thomas Wharton Jr. was named as the president of the council. This constitution was never formally adopted, so government functioned on an ad hoc basis until the new constitution was written fourteen years later.

=== Fall of Philadelphia ===

After the Continental Army&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Brandywine in Chadds Ford Township on September 11, 1777, the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia was left defenseless and American patriots began preparing for what they saw as an imminent British attack on the city. Pennsylvania&#x27;s Supreme Executive Council ordered that 11 bells, including the State House Bell, now known as the Liberty Bell, and bells from Philadelphia&#x27;s Christ Church and St. Peter&#x27;s Church, be taken down and moved out of Philadelphia to prevent the British from melting the bells down to cast into munitions. The bells were transported north to present-day Allentown by two farmers and wagon masters, John Snyder and Henry Bartholomew, and hidden under floorboards in the basement of Zion Reformed Church in what is now Center City Allentown, just prior to Philadelphia&#x27;s September 1777 fall to the British.

===State and federal constitutions===

In 1780, Pennsylvania passed a law that provided for the gradual abolition of slavery, making Pennsylvania the first state to pass an act to abolish slavery, although Vermont (not yet a state) had also previously abolished slavery. Children born after that date to slave mothers were considered legally free, but they were bound in indentured servitude to the master of their mother until the age of 28. The last slave was recorded in the state in 1847.

Six years after the adoption of the Articles of Confederation, delegates from across the country met again at the Philadelphia Convention to establish a new constitution. Pennsylvania ratified the U.S. Constitution on December 12, 1787, the second state to do so after Delaware. The Constitution took effect after eleven states ratified the document in 1788, and George Washington was inaugurated as the first President of the United States on March 4, 1789.

After the passage of the Residence Act, Philadelphia again served as the capital of the nation from 1790 to 1800 prior to the development of Washington, D.C. as the nation&#x27;s new capital. 

Pennsylvania ratified a new state constitution in 1790, which replaced the state&#x27;s executive council with a governor and a bicameral legislature.

==Westward expansion==
Pennsylvania&#x27;s borders took definitive shape in the decades before and after the Revolutionary War. The Mason–Dixon line established the borders between Pennsylvania and Maryland, and was later extended to serve as the border between Pennsylvania and Virginia, except for what is present-day West Virginia&#x27;s northern panhandle. Although some settlers proposed the creation of the state of Westsylvania in the area that now contains Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania retained control of the region. The first Treaty of Fort Stanwix and the Treaty of Fort McIntosh saw Native Americans relinquish claims on present-day southwestern Pennsylvania. The Treaty of Paris (1783) granted the United States independence, and also saw Great Britain give up its land claims in the neighboring Ohio Country, although most of these lands ultimately became new states under the terms of the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. In the second Treaty of Fort Stanwix, Pennsylvania gained control of northwestern Pennsylvania from the Iroquois League. The New York–Pennsylvania border was established in 1787. Pennsylvania purchased the Erie Triangle from the federal government in 1792. In 1799, the Pennamite–Yankee War came to an end, as Pennsylvania kept control of the Wyoming Valley despite the presence of settlers from Connecticut.

After the U.S. government granted land to Revolutionary War soldiers for military service, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed a general land act on April 3, 1792. It authorized the sale and distribution of the large remaining tracts of land east and west of the Allegheny River in hopes of sparking development of the vast territory. The process was an uneven affair, prompting much speculation but little settlement. Most veteran soldiers sold their shares sight unseen under market value, and many investors were ultimately ruined. The East Allegheny district consisted of lands in Potter, McKean, Cameron, Elk, and Jefferson counties, at the time worthless tracts. West Allegheny district was made up of lands in Erie, Crawford, Warren, and Venango counties, relatively good investments at the time.

Three major land companies participated in the land speculation that followed. Holland Land Company and its agent, Theophilus Cazenove acquired of East Allegheny district land and of West Allegheny land from Pennsylvania Supreme Court justice James Wilson. The Pennsylvania Population Company and its president, Pennsylvania State Comptroller General John Nicholson, controlled of land, mostly in Erie County and the Beaver Valley. The North American Land Company and its patron, Robert Morris, held some Pennsylvania lands but was vested mostly in upstate New York, former Iroquois territory.

===Whiskey Rebellion===

The Whiskey Rebellion, centered in Western Pennsylvania, was one of the first major challenges to the new federal government under the United States Constitution. From 1791 to 1794, farmers rebelled against an excise tax on distilled spirits, and prevented federal officials from collecting the tax. In 1794, President George Washington led a 15,000-soldier militia force into Western Pennsylvania to put down the rebellion, and most rebels returned home before the huge militia force arrived.

==19th century==
Pennsylvania, one of the largest states in the country, always had the second most electoral votes from 1796 to 1960. From 1789 to 1880, the state only voted for two losing presidential candidates: Thomas Jefferson (in 1796) and Andrew Jackson (in the unusual 1824 election). The Democratic-Republicans dominated the state for most of the First Party System, as the Federalists experienced little success in the state after the 1800 election. Pennsylvania generally supported Andrew Jackson and the Democratic Party in the Second Party System (1828–54), although the Whigs won several elections in the 1840s and 1850s. The Anti-Masonic Party was perhaps Pennsylvania&#x27;s most successful third party, as it elected Pennsylvania&#x27;s only third-party governor (Joseph Ritner) and several congressmen in the 1830s.

=== War of 1812 ===

Several Pennsylvanians fought in the War of 1812, including Jacob Brown, John Barry, and Stephen Decatur. Decatur, who served in both Barbary Wars and the Quasi-War, was one of America&#x27;s first post-Revolution war heroes. Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry earned the title &quot;Hero of Lake Erie&quot; after building a fleet at Erie, Pennsylvania and defeating the British at the Battle of Lake Erie. Pennsylvanians such as David Conner fought in the Mexican–American War, and Pennsylvania raised two regiments for the war. Pennsylvania Congressman David Wilmot earned national prominence for the Wilmot Proviso, which would have banned slavery in territory acquired from Mexico.

Philadelphia continued to be one of the most populous cities in the country, and it was the second-largest city after New York City for most of the 19th century. In 1854, the Act of Consolidation consolidated the city and county of Philadelphia. The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia and the Franklin Institute were founded during this period. Philadelphia served as the home of the Bank of North America and its successors, the First and Second Bank of the United States, all three of which served as the central bank of the United States. Philadelphia was also home to the first stock exchange, museum, insurance company, and medical school in the new nation.

=== Western Pennsylvania development ===

Settlers continued to cross the Allegheny Mountains. Pennsylvanians built many new roads, and the National Road cut through Southwestern Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania also saw the construction of thousands of miles of rail, and the Pennsylvania Railroad became one of the largest railroads in the world. Pittsburgh grew into an important town West of the Alleghenies, although the Great Fire of Pittsburgh devastated the town in the 1840s. In 1834, Pennsylvania completed construction on the Main Line of Public Works, a railroad and canal system that stretched across southern Pennsylvania, connecting Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. In 1812, Harrisburg was named the capital of the state, providing a more central location than Philadelphia.

Pennsylvania had established itself as the largest food producer in the country by the 1720s, and Pennsylvania agriculture experienced a &quot;golden age&quot; from 1790 to 1840. In 1820, agriculture provided 90 percent of the employment in Pennsylvania. Farm equipment manufacturers sprang up across the state as inventors across the world pioneered new equipment and techniques, and Pennsylvanians such as Frederick Watts were a part of this scientific approach to farming. Pennsylvania farmers lost some of their political power as other industries emerged in the state, but even in the 2000s agriculture remains one of Pennsylvania&#x27;s major industries.

In 1834, Governor George Wolf signed the Free Schools Act, which created a system of state-regulated school districts. The state created the Department of Education to oversee these schools. In 1857, the Normal School Act laid the foundation for the creation of normal schools to train teachers.

Several Pennsylvania politicians gained national renown. Frederick Muhlenberg of Pennsylvania served as the nation&#x27;s first Speaker of the House of Representatives. Albert Gallatin served as the Secretary of the Treasury from 1801 to 1814. Democrat James Buchanan, the first President of the United States from Pennsylvania, took office in 1857 and served until 1861.

Prior to and during the American Civil War, Pennsylvania was a divided state. Although Pennsylvania had outlawed slavery, there were still Pennsylvanians who believed that the federal government should not interfere with the institution of slavery. One such individual was Democrat James Buchanan, the last pre-Civil War president. Buchanan&#x27;s party had generally won presidential and gubernatorial elections in Pennsylvania.

===1856 and 1860 presidential elections===

The nascent Republican Party&#x27;s first convention took place at Musical Fund Hall on Locust Street in Philadelphia. In the 1860 elections, the Republican Party won the state&#x27;s presidential vote and the governor&#x27;s office.

==Civil War==

After the failure of the Crittenden Compromise, the secession of the South, and the Battle of Fort Sumter, the Civil War began with Pennsylvania as a key member of the Union. Despite the Republican victory in the 1860 election, Democrats remained powerful in the state, and several copperheads called for peace during the war. The Democrats retook control of the state legislature in the 1862 election, but incumbent Republican Governor Andrew Curtin retained control of the governorship in 1863. In the 1864 election, President Lincoln narrowly defeated Pennsylvania native George B. McClellan for the state&#x27;s electoral votes.

Pennsylvania was the target of several raids by the Confederate States Army. J.E.B. Stuart made cavalry raids in 1862 and 1863; John Imboden raided in 1863 and John McCausland in 1864, when his troopers burned the city of Chambersburg. However, easily the most famous and important military engagement in Pennsylvania was the Battle of Gettysburg, which is considered by many historians to be the major turning point of the Civil War. The battle, called &quot;the high water mark of the Confederacy&quot;, was a major union victory in the Eastern theater of the war, and the Confederacy was generally on the defensive following the battle. Dead from this battle rest at Gettysburg National Cemetery, established at the site of Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s &quot;Gettysburg Address&quot;. A number of smaller engagements were also fought in the state during the Gettysburg Campaign, including the battles of Hanover, Carlisle, Hunterstown, and the Fairfield.

Pennsylvania&#x27;s Thaddeus Stevens and William D. Kelley emerged as leading members of the Radical Republicans, a group of Republicans that advocated winning the war, abolishing slavery, and protecting the civil rights of African-Americans during Reconstruction. Pennsylvania generals who served in the war include George G. Meade, Winfield Scott Hancock, John Hartranft, and John F. Reynolds. Governor Andrew Curtin strongly supported the war and urged his fellow governors to do the same, while former Pennsylvania Senator Simon Cameron served as Secretary of War before his removal.

===Post-Civil War===
Following the Civil War, the Republican Party exercised strong control over politics in the state, as Republicans won almost every election during the Third Party System (1854–1894) and the Party System (1896–1930). Pennsylvania remained one of the most populous states in the Union, and the state&#x27;s large number of electoral votes helped Republicans dominate presidential elections from 1860 to 1928. Only once during that period did Pennsylvania vote for a presidential candidate that was not a Republican; the lone exception was former Republican President Theodore Roosevelt in 1912. The Republican Party was nearly as dominant in gubernatorial elections, as Robert E. Pattison was the lone non-Republican to win election as governor between 1860 and 1930. In the 1870s, Pennsylvanians embraced the constitutional reform movement that was sweeping across several states, and Pennsylvania passed a new constitution in 1874. The state created the office of lieutenant governor and made the offices of state auditor and state treasurer into elective offices. The term of the Governor of Pennsylvania was extended to four years, but the governor was prohibited from serving two consecutive terms.

The Pennsylvania Republican party was led by a series of powerful officials, including founder Simon Cameron, his son J. Donald Cameron, Matthew Quay, and Boies Penrose. Quay in particular was one of the dominant political figures of his era, as he served as chairman of the Republican National Committee and helped place Theodore Roosevelt on the 1900 Republican ticket. Following Penrose&#x27;s death in the 1920s, no one boss dominated the state party, but Pennsylvania Republicans continued to be significantly more powerful than the Democrats until the 1950s. Although the party bosses dominated politics, the Republicans also had a reform movement that challenged their power. Many Pennsylvanians supported the Progressive movement, including Philander C. Knox, Gifford Pinchot, and John Tener. Several new state agencies were established during this time, including the Department of Welfare and the Department of Labor and Industry. Pennsylvanians twice rejected an amendment to the state constitution that would have granted women the right to vote, but the state was one of the first to ratify the Nineteenth Amendment, which granted women the right to vote nationwide.

The era after the Civil War, known as the Gilded Age, saw the continued rise of industry in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania was home to some of the largest steel companies in the world. Andrew Carnegie founded the Carnegie Steel Company and Charles M. Schwab founded Bethlehem Steel. Other industry titans, including John D. Rockefeller and Jay Gould, operated in the state. In the latter half of the 19th century, the U.S. oil industry was born in western Pennsylvania, which supplied the vast majority of kerosene for years thereafter. As the Pennsylvanian oil rush developed, the oil boom towns, such as Titusville, rose and fell. Coal mining was also a major industry in the state. 

==20th century==
In 1903, Milton S. Hershey began construction on a chocolate factory in Hershey, Pennsylvania; The Hershey Company would become the largest chocolate manufacturer in North America. The Heinz Company was also founded during this period. These huge companies exercised a large influence on the politics of Pennsylvania; as Henry Demarest Lloyd put it, oil baron John D. Rockefeller &quot;had done everything with the Pennsylvania legislature except refine it&quot;. Pennsylvania created a Department of Highways and engaged in a vast program of road-building, while railroads continued to see heavy usage.

The growth of industry eventually provided middle-class incomes to working-class households, after the development of labor unions helped them gain living wages. However, the rise of unions led to a rise of union busting, with several private police forces springing up. Pennsylvania was the location of the first documented organized strike in North America, and Pennsylvania experienced the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 and the Coal Strike of 1902. Eventually, the eight-hour day was adopted, and the &quot;coal and iron police&quot; were banned. Similarly In 1922, 310,000 Pennsylvania miners went on strike during the UMW General coal strike.

During this period, the United States was the destination of millions of immigrants. Previous immigration had mostly come from western and northern Europe, but during this period Pennsylvania experienced heavy immigration from southern and eastern Europe. As many new immigrants were Catholic and Jewish, they changed the demographics of major cities and industrial areas. Pennsylvania and New York received many of the new immigrants, who entered through New York and Philadelphia and worked in the developing industries. Many of these poor immigrants took jobs in factories, steel mills, and coal mines throughout the state, where they were not restricted because of their lack of English. The availability of jobs and public education systems helped integrate the millions of immigrants and their families, who also retained ethnic cultures. Pennsylvania also experienced the Great Migration, in which millions of African Americans migrated from the southern United States to other locations in the United States. By 1940, African Americans made up almost five percent of the state&#x27;s population.

Even prior to the Civil War in the mid-19th century, Pennsylvania had emerged as a center of scientific discovery, and the state, led by its two major urban centers, continued to be a major place of innovation. The state continued to innovate, as Pennsylvanians invented the first iron and steel t-rails, iron bridges, air brakes, switching signals, and drawn metal wires. Pennsylvanians also contributed to advances in aluminum production, radio, television, airplanes, and farm machinery. During this period, Pittsburgh emerged as an important center of industry and technological innovation, and George Westinghouse became one of the preeminent inventors of the United States. Philadelphia became one of the leading medical science centers in the nation, although it no longer rivaled New York City as a financial capital. Frederick Winslow Taylor pioneered the field of scientific management, becoming America&#x27;s first &quot;efficiency engineer&quot;. In 1890, Chicago had passed Philadelphia as the second most populous city in the United States, while Pittsburgh rose to the eighth spot after annexing Allegheny.

Education continued to be a major issue in the state, and the state constitution of 1874 guaranteed an annual appropriation for education. School attendance became compulsory in 1895, and by 1903, school districts were required to either have their own high schools or pay for their residents to attend another high school. Two of Pennsylvania&#x27;s largest public schools were founded in the mid-to-late 19th century. The Pennsylvania State University was founded in 1855, and in 1863 the school became Pennsylvania&#x27;s land-grant university under the terms of the Morrill Land-Grant Acts. Temple University in Philadelphia was founded in 1884 by Russell Conwell, originally as a night school for working-class citizens.

Other colleges and universities, including Bucknell University, Carnegie Mellon University, Drexel University, Duquesne University, La Salle University, Lafayette College, Lehigh University, Saint Francis University, Saint Joseph&#x27;s University, and Villanova University, were founded in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Western University of Pennsylvania had been operating since 1787; in 1908, it changed its name to the University of Pittsburgh. The Carlisle Indian Industrial School was founded in 1879 as the flagship American Indian boarding school. Thousands of Pennsylvanians volunteered during the Spanish–American War, and many Pennsylvanians fought in the successful campaign against the Spanish in the Philippine Islands. Pennsylvania was an important industrial center in World War I, and the state provided over 300,000 soldiers for the army. Pennsylvanians Tasker H. Bliss, Peyton C. March, and William S. Sims all held important commands during the war. Following the war, the state suffered the effects of the Spanish flu.

=== Great Depression and World War II ===
Like much of the rest of the country, Democrats were much more successful in Pennsylvania during the Fifth Party System than they were in the previous two party systems. The Great Depression finally broke the lock on Republican power in the state, as Democrat Franklin Roosevelt won Pennsylvania&#x27;s electoral votes in all three of his re-election campaigns. Roosevelt was the first Democrat to win the state&#x27;s electoral votes since James Buchanan in 1856. In 1934, Pennsylvania elected Joseph F. Guffey to the Senate and George Earle III as governor; both individuals were the first Democrats elected to either office in the 20th century. Earle, with the help of a Democratic legislature, passed the &quot;Little New Deal&quot; in Pennsylvania, which included several reforms based on the New Deal and relaxed Pennsylvania&#x27;s strict Blue laws. However, Republicans regained power in the state in the 1938 elections, and Democrats would not win another gubernatorial election until George M. Leader&#x27;s successful candidacy in 1954.

Earle signed the Pennsylvania State Authority Act in 1936, which would purchase land from the state and add improvements to that land using state loans and grants. The state expected to receive federal grants and loans to fund the project under the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, in &quot;Kelly v Earle&quot;, found the Act violated the state constitution. This prevented the state from receiving federal funds for Works Progress Administration projects and making it difficult to lower the extremely high unemployment rate. Pennsylvania, with its large industrial labor force, suffered heavily during the Great Depression.

Pennsylvania manufactured 6.6 percent of total United States military armaments produced during World War II, ranking sixth among the 48 states. The Philadelphia Naval Yard served as an important naval base, and Pennsylvania produced important military leaders such as George C. Marshall, Hap Arnold, Jacob Devers, and Carl Spaatz.

During World War II, over one million Pennsylvanians served in the United States Armed Forces, and more Medals of Honor were awarded to Pennsylvanians than to individuals from any other state.

=== Late 20th century ===

The Republican lock on Pennsylvania was broken in the era after World War II, and Pennsylvania became a somewhat less powerful state in terms of electoral votes and number of House seats. Pennsylvania adopted its fifth and current constitution in 1968; the new constitution established a unified judicial system and allows governors and the other statewide elected officials to serve two consecutive terms.

Between 1954 and 2012, each party consistently won two straight gubernatorial elections before ceding control to the other party. In presidential elections, the Republican Party won Pennsylvania in seven of the eleven elections between 1948 and 1988, but Democrats have won the state in every presidential election from 1992 to 2012. When Democratic presidential nominee Hubert Humphrey won Pennsylvania&#x27;s electoral votes in 1968, he became the first non-Republican since 1824 to win Pennsylvania&#x27;s votes without winning the presidential election. After having the second most electoral votes since the 18th century, Pennsylvania was eclipsed in electoral votes by California in 1964. Texas and Florida also now have more electoral votes, while New York also has more electoral votes and Illinois has the same number of electoral votes (and a slightly larger population).

, Pennsylvania is generally considered to be an important swing state in both presidential and congressional elections, and Pennsylvania has a Cook PVI of D+1. Since the 1990s, Republicans have usually controlled both houses of the legislature, while candidates from both parties have been elected to the statewide offices of governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, treasurer, and auditor general. Democrats generally win the cities and Republicans win the rural areas, with the suburbs voting for both parties and often acting as the key swing areas.

=== Steel industry declines ===
The state experience significant economic decline with the demise of the state&#x27;s steel industry and other heavy industries, which began in the late 20th century and intensified in the 1980s. With job losses came heavy population losses, especially in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. With the end of mining and the downturn of manufacturing, the state has turned to service industries. Pittsburgh&#x27;s concentration of universities has enabled it to be a leader in technology and healthcare. Philadelphia has a concentration of university expertise. Healthcare, retail, transportation, and tourism are some of the state&#x27;s growing industries of the postindustrial era. Like much of the rest of the nation, most residential population growth has occurred in suburban rather than urban areas, although both of the state&#x27;s major cities have had significant revitalization of their downtown areas. 

After 1990, as information-based industries became more important in the economy, state and local governments put more resources into the old, well-established public library system. Some localities, however, used new state funding to cut local taxes. New ethnic groups, especially Hispanics, began entering the state to fill low skill jobs in agriculture and service industries. For example, in Chester County, Mexican migrants brought their Spanish language and cuisine when they were hired as agricultural laborers. Meanwhile, Puerto Ricans built a large community in the state&#x27;s third-largest city, Allentown, becoming forty percent of the city&#x27;s population by 2000.

===21st century===

On September 11, 2001, during the terrorist attacks on the United States, the small town of Shanksville, Pennsylvania received worldwide attention after United Airlines Flight 93 crashed into a field in Stonycreek Township, north of the town, killing all 40 civilians and four al-Qaeda hijackers on board. The hijackers had intended to fly the plane to Washington, D.C. and crash it into either the Capitol or the White House.

After learning from family members via airphone of the earlier attacks on the World Trade Center, the passengers on board revolted against the hijackers and fought for control of the plane, causing it to crash. It was the only one of the four aircraft hijacked that day that never reached its intended target and the heroism of the passengers has been commemorated.

==Urban centers==
Philadelphia is the nation&#x27;s sixth-largest city after New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, and Phoenix. Philadelphia anchors the nation&#x27;s sixth-largest metropolitan area. known as the Delaware Valley. Pittsburgh is the center of Greater Pittsburgh, the nation&#x27;s 22nd-largest metropolitan area. In eastern Pennsylvania, the Lehigh Valley has grown to the nation&#x27;s 68th-largest metropolitan area as of 2020. Pennsylvania also has six other metropolitan areas that rank among the nation&#x27;s 200-largest metropolitan areas. Philadelphia is the second-largest city in the Northeast megalopolis after New York City and a core population center in the Northeastern United States. Pittsburgh, the state&#x27;s second-largest city, is part of the Great Lakes Megalopolis and is often associated with the Midwestern United States. Both Allentown and Pittsburgh are considered part of the Rust Belt, a region of the United States negatively impacted by deindustrialization in the late 20th century.

<text>Emily Procter (born October 8, 1968) is an American actress and activist. She played Ainsley Hayes in the NBC political drama &quot;The West Wing&quot; (2000–2002; 2006) and Det. Calleigh Duquesne in the CBS police procedural drama &quot;&quot; (2002–2012).

==Early life==
Procter was born on October 8, 1968. She was adopted as an infant by William Procter, a general practitioner, and Barbara Jones, a volunteer worker, and raised in Raleigh, North Carolina. She was three years old when her parents divorced. She has an older brother, Whit, who is also adopted.

Procter attended Ravenscroft School in Raleigh. While at East Carolina University, she became a member of Alpha Delta Pi sorority and worked as a television weather anchor at WNCT-TV in Greenville, North Carolina, eventually graduating with degrees in journalism and dance.

==Career==
After Procter moved to Los Angeles, her father paid for her to attend acting school for two years. Before even graduating, she had already landed a number of small film roles, including Cameron Crowe&#x27;s sports romantic comedy-drama &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; (1996), and as a co-star with David Schwimmer and Chris Cooper in the TV movie &quot;Breast Men&quot; (1997). In 1996, Procter guest-starred as Lana Lang in the ABC superhero drama &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot;. She briefly appeared in the TV movie &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard: Reunion!&quot; (1997) as Mavis and the drama &quot;Body Shots&quot; (1999) as Whitney Bryant.

In 1995, Procter played Annabel, a brief love interest of Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc), in the second episode of season two of the NBC sitcom &quot;Friends&quot;, titled &quot;The One with the Breast Milk.&quot; From 2000 to 2002 and again in 2006, Procter played the recurring role of Associate White House Counsel Ainsley Hayes in the NBC political drama &quot;The West Wing.&quot;

Procter played the starring role of Calleigh Duquesne in the CSI spin-off &quot;&quot;. The show ran on CBS for 10 seasons, from September 23, 2002, to April 8, 2012.

Procter participated in 2007&#x27;s Live Earth event by reading aloud, along with a number of other actresses, an essay that Michelle Gardner-Quinn wrote while she was a student at the University of Vermont.

In February 2013, Procter had a recurring role in the final two episodes of season four of the USA Network crime drama &quot;White Collar&quot;. She played Amanda Callaway, an agent from Atlanta who is promoted to head of the FBI&#x27;s white collar crimes division in New York City.

== Activism ==
In 2019, Procter founded a nonprofit organization called Ground Breakers that supports change, community and equitable infrastructure. The Ground Breakers offers social and emotional language awareness to combat negative personal narratives and promote peaceful conflict resolution. The Ground teams up Defy Ventures, a nonprofit that addresses social problems such as mass incarceration and recidivism, to offer programs at Kern Valley State Prison and Nightingale school in Stockton, California.

==Personal life==
Procter has been in a relationship with musician Paul Bryan since 2008. On December 8, 2010, she gave birth to their daughter Philippa Frances (called &quot;Pippa&quot;). Because her pregnancy was not written into the of &quot;&quot;, her appearances were limited.

Procter has taken part in various triathlons and marathons. She is an avid poker player and has participated in at least one celebrity poker tournament. Procter also sings in a 1980s cover band originally called White Lightning but since renamed Motion. Procter has volunteered with the Young Storytellers Program and at homeless shelters.

Procter has an interest in interior decoration and antiques that she put to practical use when decorating the 1921 Spanish-style home that she owns in Los Angeles. During the 2007–08 Writers Guild strike, she designed a home for a friend in Saint John, U.S. Virgin Islands and, according to &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s Country Special of March 2009, decorated Kenny Chesney&#x27;s home in Malibu. She was also a guest judge on the Home &amp; Garden Television show &quot;Summer Showdown&quot;.
Procter was keynote speaker at the Spring 2019 commencement at her alma mater, East Carolina University.

<text>Olfactory receptors (ORs), also known as odorant receptors, are chemoreceptors expressed in the cell membranes of olfactory receptor neurons and are responsible for the detection of odorants (for example, compounds that have an odor) which give rise to the sense of smell. Activated olfactory receptors trigger nerve impulses which transmit information about odor to the brain. In vertebrates, these receptors are members of the class A rhodopsin-like family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The olfactory receptors form the largest multigene family in vertebrates consisting of around 400 genes in humans and 1400 genes in mice. In insects, olfactory receptors are members of an unrelated group of ligand-gated ion channels.

== Expression ==
In vertebrates, the olfactory receptors are located in both the cilia and synapses of the olfactory sensory neurons and in the epithelium of the human airway. Sperm cells also express odor receptors, which are thought to be involved in chemotaxis to find the egg cell.

== Mechanism ==
Rather than binding specific ligands, olfactory receptors display affinity for a range of odor molecules, and conversely a single odorant molecule may bind to a number of olfactory receptors with varying affinities, which depend on physio-chemical properties of molecules like their molecular volumes.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1101/013516&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Once the odorant has bound to the odor receptor, the receptor undergoes structural changes and it binds and activates the olfactory-type G protein on the inside of the olfactory receptor neuron. The G protein (Golf and/or Gs) in turn activates the lyase - adenylate cyclase - which converts ATP into cyclic AMP (cAMP). The cAMP opens cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels which allow calcium and sodium ions to enter into the cell, depolarizing the olfactory receptor neuron and beginning an action potential which carries the information to the brain.

=== Metalloprotein–ligand interactions ===

The primary sequences of thousands of olfactory receptors are known from the genomes of more than a dozen organisms: they are seven-helix transmembrane proteins, but there are very few solved structures. Their sequences exhibit typical class A GPCR motifs, useful for building their structures with molecular modeling. Golebiowski, Ma and Matsunami showed that the mechanism of ligand recognition, although similar to other non-olfactory class A GPCRs, involves residues specific to olfactory receptors, notably in the sixth helix. There is a highly conserved sequence in roughly three quarters of all ORs that is a tripodal metal ion binding site, and Suslick has proposed that the ORs are in fact metalloproteins (mostly likely with zinc, copper and possibly manganese ions) that serve as a Lewis acid site for binding of many odorant molecules. Crabtree, in 1978, had previously suggested that Cu(I) is &quot;the most likely candidate for a metallo-receptor site in olfaction&quot; for strong-smelling volatiles which are also good metal-coordinating ligands, such as thiols. Zhuang, Matsunami and Block, in 2012, confirmed the Crabtree/Suslick proposal for the specific case of a mouse OR, MOR244-3, showing that copper is essential for detection of certain thiols and other sulfur-containing compounds. Thus, by using a chemical that binds to copper in the mouse nose, so that copper wasn’t available to the receptors, the authors showed that the mice couldn&#x27;t detect the thiols. However, these authors also found that MOR244-3 lacks the specific metal ion binding site suggested by Suslick, instead showing a different motif in the EC2 domain.

Malfunction of the metalloproteins in the olfactory system is hypothesized to have a connection with amyloidal based neurodegenerative diseases.

=== Vibrational theory of olfaction ===
In a recent but highly controversial interpretation, it has also been speculated that olfactory receptors might really sense various vibrational energy-levels of a molecule rather than structural motifs via quantum coherence mechanisms. As evidence it has been shown that flies can differentiate between two odor molecules which only differ in hydrogen isotope (which will drastically change vibrational energy levels of the molecule). Not only could the flies distinguish between the deuterated and non-deuterated forms of an odorant, they could generalise the property of &quot;deuteratedness&quot; to other novel molecules. In addition, they generalised the learned avoidance behaviour to molecules which were not deuterated but did share a significant vibration stretch with the deuterated molecules, a fact which the differential physics of deuteration (below) has difficulty in accounting for.

Deuteration changes the heats of adsorption and the boiling and freezing points of molecules (boiling points: 100.0 °C for H2O vs. 101.42 °C for D2O; melting points: 0.0 °C for H2O, 3.82 °C for D2O), pKa (i.e., dissociation constant: 9.71x10−15 for H2O vs. 1.95x10−15 for D2O, cf. heavy water) and the strength of hydrogen bonding. Such isotope effects are exceedingly common, and so it is well known that deuterium substitution will indeed change the binding constants of molecules to protein receptors.

It has been claimed that human olfactory receptors are capable of distinguishing between deuterated and undeuterated isotopomers of cyclopentadecanone by vibrational energy level sensing. However this claim has been challenged by another report that the human musk-recognizing receptor, OR5AN1 that robustly responds to cyclopentadecanone and muscone, fails to distinguish isotopomers of these compounds in vitro. Furthermore, the mouse (methylthio)methanethiol-recognizing receptor, MOR244-3, as well as other selected human and mouse olfactory receptors, responded similarly to normal, deuterated, and carbon-13 isotopomers of their respective ligands, paralleling results found with the musk receptor OR5AN1. Hence it was concluded that the proposed vibration theory does not apply to the human musk receptor OR5AN1, mouse thiol receptor MOR244-3, or other olfactory receptors examined. In addition, the proposed electron transfer mechanism of the vibrational frequencies of odorants could be easily suppressed by quantum effects of nonodorant molecular vibrational modes. Hence multiple lines of evidence argue against the vibration theory of smell. This later study was criticized since it used &quot;cells in a dish rather than within whole organisms&quot; and that &quot;expressing an olfactory receptor in human embryonic kidney cells doesn&#x27;t adequately reconstitute the complex nature of olfaction...&quot;. In response, the authors of the second study state &quot;Embryonic kidney cells are not identical to the cells in the nose .. but if you are looking at receptors, it&#x27;s the best system in the world.&quot;

== Diversity ==

There are a large number of different odor receptors, with as many as 1,000 in the mammalian genome which represents approximately 3% of the genes in the genome. However, not all of these potential odor receptor genes are expressed and functional. According to an analysis of data derived from the Human Genome Project, humans have approximately 400 functional genes coding for olfactory receptors, and the remaining 600 candidates are pseudogenes.

The reason for the large number of different odor receptors is to provide a system for discriminating between as many different odors as possible. Even so, each odor receptor does not detect a single odor. Rather each individual odor receptor is broadly tuned to be activated by a number of similar odorant structures. Analogous to the immune system, the diversity that exists within the olfactory receptor family allows molecules that have never been encountered before to be characterized. However, unlike the immune system, which generates diversity through &quot;in-situ&quot; recombination, every single olfactory receptor is translated from a specific gene; hence the large portion of the genome devoted to encoding OR genes. Furthermore, most odors activate more than one type of odor receptor. Since the number of combinations and permutations of olfactory receptors is very large, the olfactory receptor system is capable of detecting and distinguishing between a very large number of odorant molecules.

Deorphanization of odor receptors can be completed using electrophysiological and imaging techniques to analyze the response profiles of single sensory neurons to odor repertoires. Such data open the way to the deciphering of the combinatorial code of the perception of smells.

Such diversity of OR expression maximizes the capacity of olfaction. Both monoallelic OR expression in a single neuron and maximal diversity of OR expression in the neuron population are essential for specificity and sensitivity of olfactory sensing. Thus, olfactory receptor activation is a dual-objective design problem. Using mathematical modeling and computer simulations, Tian et al proposed an evolutionarily optimized three-layer regulation mechanism, which includes zonal segregation, epigenetic barrier crossing coupled to a negative feedback loop and an enhancer competition step

. This model not only recapitulates monoallelic OR expression but also elucidates how the olfactory system maximizes and maintains the diversity of OR expression.

== Families ==

A nomenclature system has been devised for the olfactory receptor family and is the basis for the official Human Genome Project (HUGO) symbols for the genes that encode these receptors. The names of individual olfactory receptor family members are in the format &quot;ORnXm&quot; where:
* OR is the root name (Olfactory Receptor superfamily)
* n = an integer representing a family (e.g., 1-56) whose members have greater than 40% sequence identity,
* X = a single letter (A, B, C, ...) denoting a subfamily (&gt;60% sequence identity), and
* m = an integer representing an individual family member (isoform).
For example, OR1A1 in the first isoform of subfamily A of olfactory receptor family 1.

Members belonging to the same subfamily of olfactory receptors (&gt;60% sequence identity) are likely to recognize structurally similar odorant molecules.

Two major classes of olfactory receptors have been identified in humans:
* class I (fish-like receptors) OR families 51-56
* class II (tetrapod specific receptors) OR families 1-13
Class I receptors are specialized to detect hydrophilic odorants while class II receptors will detect more hydrophobic compounds. 

== Evolution ==

The olfactory receptor gene family in vertebrates has been shown to evolve through genomic events such as gene duplication and gene conversion. Evidence of a role for tandem duplication is provided the fact that many olfactory receptor genes belonging to the same phylogenetic clade are located in the same gene cluster. To this point, the organization of OR genomic clusters is well conserved between humans and mice, even though the functional OR count is vastly different between these two species. Such &quot;birth-and-death evolution&quot; has brought together segments from several OR genes to generate and degenerate odorant binding site configurations, creating new functional OR genes as well as pseudogenes.

Compared to many other mammals, primates have a relatively small number of functional OR genes. For instance, since divergence from their most recent common ancestor (MRCA), mice have gained a total of 623 new OR genes, and lost 285 genes, whereas humans have gained only 83 genes, but lost 428 genes. Mice have a total of 1035 protein-coding OR genes, humans have 387 protein-coding OR genes. The &quot;vision priority hypothesis&quot; states that the evolution of color vision in primates may have decreased primate reliance on olfaction, which explains the relaxation of selective pressure that accounts for the accumulation of olfactory receptor pseudogenes in primates. However, recent evidence has rendered the vision priority hypothesis obsolete, because it was based on misleading data and assumptions. The hypothesis assumed that functional OR genes can be correlated to the olfactory capability of a given animal. In this view, a decrease in the fraction of functional OR genes would cause a reduction in the sense of smell; species with higher pseudogene count would also have a decreased olfactory ability. This assumption is flawed. Dogs, which are reputed to have good sense of smell, do not have the largest number of functional OR genes. Additionally, pseudogenes may be functional; 67% of human OR pseudogenes are expressed in the main olfactory epithelium, where they possibly have regulatory roles in gene expression. More importantly, the vision priority hypothesis assumed a drastic loss of functional OR genes at the branch of the OWMs, but this conclusion was based by low-resolution data from only 100 OR genes. High-resolution studies instead agree that primates have lost OR genes in every branch from the MRCA to humans, indicating that the degeneration of OR gene repertories in primates cannot simply be explained by the changing capabilities in vision.

It has been shown that negative selection is still relaxed in modern human olfactory receptors, suggesting that no plateau of minimal function has yet been reached in modern humans and therefore the olfactory capability might still be decreasing. This is considered to provide a first clue to the future human genetic evolution.

== Discovery ==

In 2004 Linda B. Buck and Richard Axel won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on olfactory receptors. In 2006, it was shown that another class of odorant receptors – known as trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) – exist for detecting volatile amines. Except for TAAR1, all functional TAARs in humans are expressed in the olfactory epithelium. A third class of olfactory receptors known as vomeronasal receptors has also been identified; vomeronasal receptors putatively function as pheromone receptors.

As with many other GPCRs, there is still a lack of experimental structures at atomic level for olfactory receptors and structural information is based on homology modeling methods. In 2023 the structure of OR51E2 was found, the first elucidation of the structure of any human olfactory receptor.

The limited functional expression of olfactory receptors in heterologous systems, however, has greatly hampered attempts to deorphanize them (analyze the response profiles of single olfactory receptors) This was first completed by genetically engineered receptor, OR-I7 to characterize the “odor space” of a population of native aldehyde receptors.

<text>Clifford Michael Irving (November 5, 1930 – December 19, 2017) was an American novelist and investigative reporter. Although he published 20 novels, he is best known for an &quot;autobiography&quot; allegedly written as told to Irving by billionaire recluse Howard Hughes. The fictional work was to have been published in 1972. After Hughes denounced him and sued the publisher, McGraw-Hill, Irving and his collaborators confessed to the hoax. He was sentenced to two and a half years in prison, of which he served 17 months.

Irving later wrote &quot;The Hoax&quot; (1981), his account of events surrounding the development and sale of the fake autobiography. The book was adapted as a 2006 biopic of the same name starring Richard Gere as Clifford Irving. He continued to write and published his later books as e-books available via Kindle and Nook.

==Early life and writing career==
Irving grew up in New York City, the son of Jay Irving, a &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; cover artist and the creator of the syndicated comic strip &quot;Pottsy&quot;, and his wife, Dorothy. After graduating in 1947 from Manhattan&#x27;s selective High School of Music and Art, Irving attended Cornell University. He graduated with honors in English.

Working as a copy boy at &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Irving wrote his first novel, &quot;On a Darkling Plain&quot; (1956), published by Putnam.

Irving completed his second novel, &quot;The Losers&quot; (1958), while traveling in Europe. His third novel, &quot;The Valley&quot; (1960), is a mythic Western saga, published by McGraw-Hill.

After returning to Ibiza, Irving became friendly with Hungarian art forger Elmyr de Hory. The painter asked him to write a biography, which was published as &quot;Fake!&quot; (1969). Irving and de Hory are both featured in Orson Welles&#x27;s film documentary, &quot;F for Fake&quot; (1974), which was inspired by both &quot;Fake!&quot; and the Hughes autobiography affair.

==Personal life==
His first wife was Nina Wilcox. Their marriage was annulled in 1952. Later, on the Spanish island of Ibiza, he met an Englishwoman, Claire Lydon; they married in 1958 and moved to California. She died the following year at Big Sur in an automobile accident on May 8, 1959.

In 1962, after a year spent traveling around the world and living in a houseboat in Kashmir, Irving moved back to Ibiza with his third wife, Fay Desch, an English photographic model, and their newborn son, Josh. This marriage ended in divorce. In 1967, Irving married Swiss/German artist Edith Sommer. They had two sons, John Edmond (aka &quot;Nedsky&quot;) and Barnaby. He reportedly had a lengthy affair in the 1970s with the Danish actress and singer Nina van Pallandt.

Irving later married English author Maureen &quot;Moish&quot; Earl. From 1984 to 1998 they lived mainly in the mountain town of San Miguel de Allende, Guanajuato, Mexico. After divorcing Earl, Irving married an Australian woman, Julie Schall.

==Fake autobiography of Howard Hughes==
By 1958, millionaire Howard Hughes had become a recluse. In 1970, in Palma de Mallorca, Spain, Irving met with Richard Suskind, a longtime friend who was an author of children&#x27;s books. They conceived a scheme to write Hughes&#x27;s purported &quot;autobiography&quot;: Irving and Suskind believed that, because Hughes had completely withdrawn from public life, he would never draw attention by denouncing such a book or filing a lawsuit for libel. 

Suskind took on the work of research in news archives. Irving started by enlisting the aid of artist and writer friends on Ibiza in order to forge letters in Hughes&#x27;s own hand, imitating authentic letters they had seen displayed in &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine.

Irving contacted his publisher, McGraw-Hill, and said that Hughes had corresponded with him, saying he admired Irving&#x27;s book about de Hory, and that Hughes had expressed interest in having Irving ghost write the millionaire&#x27;s autobiography. 

The McGraw-Hill editors invited Irving to New York, where the publishers drafted contracts among Hughes, Irving, and the company, with Irving and his friends forging Hughes&#x27; signatures. McGraw-Hill paid an advance of US$100,000, with an additional US$400,000 to be paid to Hughes; Irving later bargained the sum up to US$765,000. McGraw-Hill paid by checks made out to &quot;H. R. Hughes&quot;, which Irving&#x27;s Swiss wife Edith deposited to a Swiss bank account which she had opened under the name of &quot;Helga R. Hughes&quot;.

===The investigation===
Learning of the planned book, representatives of Hughes&#x27; companies expressed doubts about its authenticity. Frank McCulloch, known for years as the last journalist to interview Hughes, had received an angry call from someone claiming to be Hughes, but after he read the Irving manuscript, became convinced that the book was genuine.

McGraw-Hill and &quot;Life&quot; magazine, which had paid to publish excerpts of the book, continued to support Irving. Osborn Associates, a firm of handwriting experts, further declared the writing samples were authentic. While Irving had to submit to a lie-detector test, this indicated inconsistencies but no lies.

On January 7, 1972, Hughes arranged a telephone conference with seven journalists whose end of the conversation was televised: in this conference, Hughes claimed that he had never even met Irving, much less corresponded with him. Irving claimed the voice on the phone was an imposter, but it subsequently became clear that Irving was the fraud.

Hughes&#x27; lawyer, Chester Davis, immediately filed suit against McGraw-Hill, &quot;Life&quot;, Clifford Irving, and Dell Publications, while Swiss authorities investigated the &quot;Helga R. Hughes&quot; bank account: the Irvings by this time had returned to their home on the Balearic island of Ibiza. After the Swiss bank identified Edith Irving as the depositor of the funds, the hoax was revealed.

===Confession and trial===
The Irvings confessed on January 28, 1972. They and Suskind were indicted for &quot;conspiracy to defraud through use of the mails&quot; and pleaded guilty on June 16. Irving spent 17 months in prison. He voluntarily returned the US$765,000 advance to his publishers. Edith, a.k.a. &quot;Helga&quot;, served prison sentences in the United States and in Switzerland.

==Film==
In July 2005, filming began in Puerto Rico and New York on &quot;The Hoax&quot;, starring Richard Gere as Irving, Alfred Molina as Suskind, and Marcia Gay Harden as Edith. On March 6, 2007, Hyperion reissued Clifford Irving&#x27;s &quot;The Hoax&quot; in a movie tie-in edition. The film, directed by Swedish filmmaker Lasse Hallström, opened on April 6, 2007, with a DVD release following on October 16. The majority of reviews were favorable.

Irving characterized the film as a clichéd distortion of the story and &quot;a hoax about a hoax&quot;. He described the film&#x27;s portrayals of Suskind, Edith Irving and himself as &quot;absurd even more than inaccurate&quot;. He noted that the film was not true to his account, adding events that had not taken place. As the author of the source book, Irving is credited as a writer for the film, but he had himself removed from credit as technical adviser.

In spring 2012, the movie rights to Irving&#x27;s nonfiction book, &quot;Fake!&quot;, were optioned by Steve Golin and Anonymous Content LLP. Irving was commissioned to write a screenplay for the movie. In 2015, Anonymous Content&#x27;s option for the book&#x27;s dramatic rights expired.

==Later life and death==
In 2012 Irving formatted and placed 12 of his books, including one unpublished novel, for sale on Kindle and Nook. In 2014 he added six books to the total, including his prison journal. Sales were brisk. Irving was open about it , and offered the text of the hoax autobiography for sale in book form. 

Irving died of pancreatic cancer in Sarasota, Florida, at the age of 87.

==Legacy==
In November 2014 the Briscoe Center for American History at the University of Texas announced that they had acquired all of Irving&#x27;s literary and personal papers. The archive includes material from more than 50 years, from 1954 to 2012. Among the trove is Irving&#x27;s correspondence with lawyers, publishers, colleagues and friends such as Graham Greene, Robert Graves and Irwin Shaw, his personal diaries and prison journals, many manuscript drafts, legal documents from lawsuits and from his 1972 bankruptcy, portions of his Howard Hughes manuscript and extensive handwritten notes and musings. It fills 20 boxes in the research center archive.

Don Carleton, executive director at the Briscoe Center, remarked of Clifford Irving that he was &quot;an important writer who has lived a colorful and controversial life, which has been a major source of inspiration for much of his literary work&quot;. He also said that he was &quot;delighted that his papers are now available to enrich scholarship here at the university.&quot;

<doc id="665483" wikidata="Q56479" url="?curid=665483" title="Jin Chinese">
<text>Jin () is a group of Chinese linguistic varieties spoken by roughly 48 million people in northern China, including most of Shanxi province, much of central Inner Mongolia, and adjoining areas in Hebei, Henan, and Shaanxi provinces. The status of Jin is disputed among linguists; some prefer to include it within Mandarin, but others set it apart as a closely related but separate sister group.

==Classification==
After the concept of Mandarin Chinese was proposed, the Jin dialects were universally included within it, mainly because Chinese linguists paid little attention to these dialects at the time. In order to promote Standard Mandarin in the early days of People&#x27;s Republic of China, linguists started to research various dialects in Shanxi, comparing these dialects with Standard Mandarin for helping the locals to learn it more quickly. During this period, a few linguists discovered some unique features of Jin Chinese that do not exist in other northern Mandarin dialects, planting the seeds for the future independence of Jin Chinese. Finally, in 1985, Li Rong proposed that Jin should be considered a separate top-level dialect group, similar to Yue or Wu. His main criterion was that Jin dialects had preserved the entering tone as a separate category, still marked with a glottal stop as in the Wu dialects, but distinct in this respect from most other Mandarin dialects. Some linguists have adopted this classification. However, others disagree that Jin should be considered a separate dialect group for these reasons:
#Use of the entering tone as a diagnostic feature is inconsistent with the way that all other Chinese dialect groups have been delineated based on the reflexes of the Middle Chinese voiced initials.
#Certain other Mandarin dialects also preserve the glottal stop, especially the Jianghuai dialects, and so far, no linguist has claimed that these dialects should also be split from Mandarin.

==Dialects==
The &quot;Language Atlas of China&quot; divides Jin into the following eight groups:

:* (), spoken in central Shanxi (the ancient Bing Province), including Taiyuan. Most dialects under this group can distinguish the light entering tone from the dark one, with only 1 level tone. In many dialects, especially those to the south of Taiyuan, the voiced obstruents from Middle Chinese become tenuis in all 4 tones, namely → , → and → .
:* (), spoken in western Shanxi (including Lüliang) and northern Shaanxi. Dialects under this group can differentiate light entering tone from dark entering tone. In most dialects, the voiced obstruents from Middle Chinese become aspirated in both level and entering tones, namely → , → and → .
:* (), spoken in the area of Changzhi (ancient Shangdang) in southeastern Shanxi. Dialects under this group can differentiate light entering tone from dark entering tone. The palatalization of velar consonants does not occur in some dialects.
:* (), spoken in parts of northern Shanxi (including Wutai County) and central Inner Mongolia. A few Dialects under this group can differentiate light entering tone from dark entering tone, while the others cannot. The fusion of the level tone and the rising one occurred in some dialects, though some linguists claim every dialect under this group has this feature.
:* (), spoken in parts of northern Shanxi and central Inner Mongolia, including Baotou.
:* Zhangjiakou–Hohhot group (), spoken in Zhangjiakou in northwestern Hebei and parts of central Inner Mongolia, including Hohhot.
:* (), spoken in southeastern Shanxi, southern Hebei (including Handan) and northern Henan (including Xinxiang).
:* Zhi-Yan group (), spoken in Zhidan County and Yanchuan County in northern Shaanxi.

The Taiyuan dialect from the Bingzhou group is sometimes taken as a convenient representative of Jin because many studies of this dialect are available, but most linguists agree that the Taiyuan vocabulary is heavily influenced by Mandarin, making it unrepresentative of Jin. The Lüliang group is usually regarded as the &quot;core&quot; of the Jin language group as it preserves most archaic features of Jin. However, there is no consensus as to which dialect among the Lüliang group is the representative dialect.

==Phonology==
Unlike most varieties of Mandarin, Jin has preserved a final glottal stop, which is the remnant of a final stop consonant (, or ). This is in common with the Early Mandarin of the Yuan dynasty (c. 14th century AD) and with a number of modern southern varieties of Chinese. In Middle Chinese, syllables closed with a stop consonant had no tone. However, Chinese linguists prefer to categorize such syllables as belonging to a separate tone class, traditionally called the &quot;entering tone&quot;. Syllables closed with a glottal stop in Jin are still toneless, or alternatively, Jin can be said to still maintain the entering tone. In standard Mandarin Chinese, syllables formerly ending with a glottal stop have been reassigned to one of the other tone classes in a seemingly random fashion.

=== Initials ===
* is mainly used in finals.

* The nasal consonant sounds may vary between nasal sounds or prenasalised stop sounds .
* A prenasalised affricated fricative sound , is also present.

=== Finals ===


* The diphthong may also be realized as a monophthong close central vowel .
* Sounds ending in the sequence may also be heard as , then realized as .
* can also be heard as a labio-palatal approximant when preceding initial consonants.
* when occurring after alveolar sounds can be heard as an alveolar syllabic , and is heard as a retroflex syllabic when occurring after retroflex consonants .

=== Tones ===

Jin employs extremely complex tone sandhi, or tone changes that occur when words are put together into phrases. The tone sandhi of Jin is notable in two ways among Chinese varieties:

* Tone sandhi rules depend on the grammatical structure of the words being put together. Hence, an adjective–noun compound may go through different sets of changes compared to a verb–object compound.
* There are Jin varieties in which the &quot;dark level&quot; tone category (&quot;yīnpíng&quot; 阴平) and &quot;light level&quot; (&quot;yángpíng&quot; 阳平) tone have merged in isolation but can still be distinguished in tone sandhi contexts. That is, while e.g. Standard Mandarin has a tonal distinction between Tone 1 and Tone 2, corresponding words in Jin Chinese may have the same tone when pronounced separately. However, these words can still be distinguished in connected speech. For example, in Pingyao Jin, dark level &quot;tou&quot; 偷 &#x27;secretly&#x27; and &quot;ting&quot; 听 &#x27;to listen&#x27; on the one hand, and light level &quot;tao&quot; 桃 &#x27;peach&#x27; and &quot;hong&quot; 红 &#x27;red&#x27; on the other hand, all have the same rising tone [˩˧] when pronounced in isolation. Yet, when these words are combined into &quot;touting&quot; 偷听 &#x27;eavesdropping&#x27; and &quot;taohong&quot; 桃红 &#x27;peach red&#x27;, the tonal distinction emerges. In &quot;touting&quot;, &quot;tou&quot; has a falling tone [˧˩] and &quot;ting&quot; has a high-rising tone [˧˥], whereas both syllables in &quot;taohong&quot; still have the same low-rising tone [˩˧] as in isolation.
* According to Guo (1989) and also noted by Sagart (1999), the departing (&quot;qusheng&quot; 去声) tone category in the Jin dialect of Xiaoyi is characterized by -ʰ and a high falling tone [˥˧]. Xiaoyi also lacks a voicing split in the level tone. The rising (&quot;shangsheng&quot; 上声) tone in Xiaoyi is also &quot;characterized by a glottal break in the middle of the syllable [˧˩ʔ˩˨]&quot;.

==Grammar==
Jin readily employs prefixes such as , , , and (日) , in a variety of derivational constructions. For example:
 &quot;fool around&quot; &lt; &quot;ghost, devil&quot;

In addition, there are a number of words in Jin that evolved, evidently, by splitting a mono-syllabic word into two, adding an &#x27;l&#x27; in between (cf. Ubbi Dubbi, but with instead of ). For example:

: &lt; &quot;hop&quot;
: &lt; &quot;drag&quot;
: &lt; &quot;scrape&quot;
: &lt; &quot;street&quot;

A similar process can in fact be found in most Mandarin dialects (e.g. kulong &lt; kong), but it is especially common in Jin.

This may be a kind of reservation for double-initials in Old Chinese, although this is still controversial. For example, the character (pronounced in Mandarin) which appears more often as in Jin, had the pronunciation like in Old Chinese.

Some dialects of Jin make a three-way distinction in demonstratives. (Modern English, for example, has only a two-way distinction between &quot;this&quot; and &quot;that&quot;, with &quot;yon&quot; being archaic.)

==Vocabulary==
There is considerable lexical diversity in Jin Chinese, with some words having very distinct regional forms. Usually, there are more unique words in the core dialects than in the non-core dialects. Moreover, some cannot be easily represented using Chinese characters.

<text>Woody Island, also called Yongxing Island () by China and Taiwan and Phú Lâm Island () by Vietnam (and formerly by French Indochina), is the largest of the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea (SCS), with an area of . As of 2014, it has a population of almost 1,500, with roads, banks and an air strip.

The Paracel Islands are a group of islands, reefs, banks and atolls in the northwestern part of the South China Sea. Woody Island is part of the Amphitrite Group in the eastern Paracels and is approximately equidistant from Hainan and the Vietnam coast.

The island has been under the control of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) since 1956. Sansha City, which administers PRC-controlled territories in Spratly and Paracel Islands, has its administrative seat located on the island. The island is claimed by the Republic of China (ROC, Taiwan) and Vietnam.

==History==
The Chinese Qing dynasty, France (on behalf of Annam), Japan, and the Republic of China had all established a presence on the island at various points of time in history. Fishing activities in the South China Sea region surrounding the island have been documented in the records of earlier Chinese dynasties. During the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), Zheng He plotted the location of surrounding islands on a map, but never landed on it.

In 1909 Zhang Renjun (), the Viceroy of Liangguang ordered Guangdong Fleet Admiral Li Zhun to sail to the island. His mission landed in June 1909. In 1932 French Indochina announced its claim to the archipelago. A Franco-Vietnamese garrison was established on Woody Island (from &#x27;île Boisée&#x27; in French) in 1938, regularly supplied by the French Navy until 1945.

The island was occupied by Japan during World War II. Later, on 4 Feb 1945 USS Pargo (Lt.Cdr. D.B. Bell) would bombard Woody Island destroying a Japanese weather station and radio equipment, an administration building, a jetty, and several fishing boats. Following Japan&#x27;s surrender at the end of the war, the Nationalist Chinese government sent naval expeditions to the South China Sea in 1946 to claim the Spratly and Paracel Islands, and established a permanent presence on Woody Island and Itu Aba. They (re)named Woody Island &quot;Yongxing (Yung-hsing) Island&quot; after one of the Republic of China Navy warships, ROCS &quot;Yung-hsing&quot; (). &quot;Yung-hsing&quot; was formerly the . The ship was transferred to the ROC navy after the war. In January 1947, after making a failed attempt to dislodge the Chinese garrison from Woody Island, France established a permanent presence on Pattle Island in the western Paracels.

After the Hainan Island Campaign in 1950 during the Chinese Civil War, the ROC garrisons on Woody Island and Itu Aba were withdrawn to Taiwan. France had a chance to take over the islands, but decided not to, for fear of compromising its interests with the newly established PRC. The islands were thus unoccupied for six years, except for seasonal inhabitation (occupation) by fishermen from Hainan. In 1956, the PRC established a permanent presence on Woody Island.

The Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) continued to claim sovereignty over the Crescent Group in the western part of the Paracel Islands after assuming control from the departing French colonialists against whom Vietnam fought a bitter independence war, maintaining a military garrison on Pattle Island (Vietnamese: đảo Hoàng Sa) by Ngo Dinh Diem&#x27;s executive order from 1956. For the subsequent 20 years, conflicts between the two sides repeatedly erupted within the region. In January 1974, the PLA Navy captured Pattle Island during the Battle of the Paracel Islands.

==Climate==
The island is located between the equator and the tropic of cancer, and falls in the &quot;tropical marine monsoon climate&quot; category. It experiences abundant rainfall, year-round high temperatures, high humidity and high salt. Coupled with generally clear skies and sunny weather, the annual average temperature is ; the coldest average temperature in January is , the hottest average temperature in June is . The rainy season lasts for 5 to 6 months every year.

==Claims and disputes==

Under PRC control, the island is administered by the Yongxingdao Town Government and is the seat of Sansha, a prefecture-level city of Hainan. In June 2014, UK newspaper &quot;The Independent&quot; stated that the island had a population of 1,443.

As part of the Paracel Islands, the island is also claimed by Taiwan and by Vietnam.

==Structures and facilities==
Sansha city is located on Woody island. Woody Island has had two or three artificial harbors capable of docking vessels up to 5,000 tonnes. In 2008, the island&#x27;s main sea transport was the freighter &quot;Qiongsha-3&quot;, (2,500 tonnes, 84m x 13.8m, 200 passengers and 750 tonnes of cargo); it was the only means of sea transport for non-military personnel such as fishermen and researchers. Each trip from Hainan to Woody island lasted from 13 to 15 hours.

In 1990, Chinese authorities built a runway and airport on the island. The Sansha Yongxing Airport was completed in July 1990, with a 2,700-metre runway that is capable of handling any fourth generation fighter aircraft of the PLA Naval Air Force such as the Chengdu J-10AH, Shenyang J-11BH, Xian JH-7A, and Sukhoi Su-30MK2. Other constructions include three main roads and an 800-metre long concrete causeway connecting to Rocky Island (石岛/đảo Đá).

Apart from government buildings and army posts, the island has various establishments. The island&#x27;s administrative centre is located on Beijing Road, which has an Industrial and Commercial Bank of China branch, a hospital, various shops, hostels, food stations, a post office, small department stores and an aquatic company. A rescue centre was established on 15 July 2006.

There are two museums on the island – Xisha Maritime Museum and a Naval Museum. Other monuments include towers left by the Imperial Japanese Army during WWII, a monument erected by the ROC government in 1946, and a monument erected by the PRC in 1974. Visitors to the island are required to obtain approval from PRC authorities in Haikou before departure. Hiring a fishing boat from Hainan to the island is possible.

On 10 April 2011, China National Radio (CNR) and Hainan People&#x27;s Broadcasting Station began FM broadcasts on the island. This is in addition to mobile communications and satellite television which are available in the fishing villages of the Paracel Islands.

China began construction on a school to serve about 40 children whose parents work on the island in June 2014, with construction expected to cost about 36 million yuan and take a year and a half. It opened in December 2015.

On 17 February 2016, the New York Times reported that an HQ-9 Surface to Air Missile system had been deployed on the island. In July 2016, it was reported that Shenyang J-11BH fighter aircraft were deployed on the island.

In April 2017, the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative – a US think tank based in Washington – reported that a Shenyang J-11BH fighter aircraft was spotted on the island in satellite photos taken on 29 March 2017.

On 22 July 2017, over 200 Chinese moviegoers attended a screening in a theater built on the island by the Hainan Film Company with up-to-date technology, including both 4K resolution and a 3-D perforated screen.

In May 2018, based on PLA Air Force defence circulars and Chinese social media posts, the Washington Post and Washington based Asia maritime transparency initiative reported that China had landed long range bombers on the island as part of a defense exercise.

In August 2020 the PLA Air Force deployed H-6J bombers to Woody Island.

==Ecology and resources==
The island&#x27;s flora is generally tropical, with an abundance of palm trees. There is also a vegetable plantation sized around one-fifteenth of a hectare (~700 sq m). The western portion of the island has a coconut grove. The island&#x27;s domestic water supply is from rainwater collection. Additional drinking water is shipped from Hainan Island. Supply ships arrive monthly; during this time residents spend two days at the pier unloading materiel. A desalination plant completed in October 2016 is capable of treating 1,000 tonnes of seawater per day, bringing the total capacity of desalination equipment on the island to 1,800 tonnes of seawater per day.

==Population==
The island&#x27;s civilian population generally consists of a small number of long-term fishermen&#x27;s settlements maintained by a fisherman&#x27;s village committee, and a larger number of short-term fishermen that visit the island, in addition to small numbers of government workers and tourists. Policemen and soldiers stationed on the island change shifts every two years, whereas civilian employees change shifts every six months.

<doc id="665490" wikidata="Q3047557" url="?curid=665490" title="Edgewater, Chicago">
<text>Edgewater is a lakefront community area on the North Side of the city of Chicago, Illinois, six miles north of the Loop. The most recently established of the city&#x27;s 77 official community areas, Edgewater is bounded by Foster Avenue on the south, Devon Avenue on the north, Ravenswood Avenue on the west, and Lake Michigan on the east. Edgewater contains several beaches for residents to enjoy. Chicago&#x27;s largest park, Lincoln Park, stretches south from Edgewater for seven miles along the waterfront, almost to downtown. Until 1980, Edgewater was part of Uptown, and historically it constituted the northeastern corner of Lake View Township, an independent suburb annexed by the city of Chicago in 1889. Today, Uptown is to Edgewater&#x27;s south, Lincoln Square to its west, West Ridge to its northwest and Rogers Park to its north.

Edgewater transitioned from agriculture and small settlement to residential development around the 1880s with summer homes for Chicago&#x27;s elite. Today, it provides the northern terminus of both Lincoln Park and Lake Shore Drive. With the exception of pockets acknowledged as historic districts (like the Bryn Mawr Historic District), eastern Edgewater (Edgewater Beach) has a skyline of high-rise apartment buildings, condominium complexes, and mid-rise homes. To the west, Edgewater is characterized by single-family homes; and two-, three-, or four-story flats, including the historic village and now commercial district of Andersonville.

==History==

===Early development===
Developers began buying up orchards and truck farms and cutting down the dense woods in Lake View Township (of which Edgewater was a part) in the 1880s to make way for future development. From 1870 to 1887 the population of the township, then north of the City of Chicago, grew from 2,000 citizens to 45,000. As a result, there was growing need of more public-service access, and Lake View was annexed to Chicago in 1889 as a way of meeting those demands.

In 1885, the northeastern section of Lake View was given the name Edgewater by prominent developer John Lewis Cochran. He built the first residential subdivision in the area. Many of his homes can still be found in the Lakewood Balmoral Historic District. After a few years, Edgewater was celebrated as a wonder as it became &quot;the only electric lighted suburb adjacent to Chicago&quot;.

====Etymology of street names====
Cochran was originally a tobacco salesman from Philadelphia who moved to the area in 1885. Upon arrival, he took his Philadelphia culture and geography with him to the area. This can be seen best by the names of the streets in Edgewater. Every street in Edgewater at the time was named after a train station on the former PRR Main Line, and most still exist to this day. This includes:
*Ardmore Avenue (5800 N), located in Ardmore, PA.
*Thorndale Avenue (5900 N), located in Thorndale, PA, also became a CTA station.
*Bryn Mawr Avenue (5600 N), located in Bryn Mawr, PA, also became a CTA station.
*Berwyn Avenue (5300 N), located in Berwyn, PA, also became a CTA station.
*Devon Avenue (6400 N), named after Devon, PA
*Rosemont Avenue (6300 N), named after Rosemont, PA
*Wayne Avenue (1432 W), named after Wayne, PA

===Beginning of the 20th century===

By the early 1900s, Edgewater was regarded as one of Chicago&#x27;s most prestigious communities. Mansions dominated the lakefront, while large single-family homes spread inland to the former farming village of Andersonville (then also called Somerdale). A prominent symbol of Edgewater&#x27;s affluence and desirable location on the lake was the Edgewater Beach Hotel, which opened in 1916 at 5349 N. Sheridan. The famed &quot;sunrise&quot; yellow hotel was razed in 1970, though the remaining &quot;sunset&quot; pink Edgewater Beach Apartments building is still a landmark at the north tip of Lake Shore Drive. The Edgewater building boom peaked in 1926 and property values reached their height in 1928. 
Around 1900, the burgeoning affluent population grew so much that developers expanded Edgewater and renamed a portion of the neighborhood community Uptown (which still exists today). Uptown quickly became the commercial hub of the area, with storied nightlife, entertainment and tall commercial buildings. Thus, in the late 1920s, when Community Areas were first designated, the Edgewater area was included as a section of Uptown.

===Revival===
Uptown&#x27;s affluence declined in the 1950s, as Chicago&#x27;s suburbs were developed and opened, absorbing some of Uptown&#x27;s families, both middle and upper class. With the flight of some residents came disrepair and crime for what once was one of the most affluent districts of the city. At the same time, with the extension of Lake Shore Drive to Hollywood Ave. in the 1950s, into the 1970s, highrise condominium developments along Edgewater&#x27;s lakefront took off, and Andersonville was seeking to promote its unique heritage.

In 1980, the Chicago City Council and local business owners orchestrated a revival for the Edgewater community. Edgewater was separated from Uptown and once again called itself its own community. New businesses came into the community, older buildings were refurbished, and homes touched up to harken back to Edgewater&#x27;s past. Since 2000, there have been several new additions to the neighborhood, including The Clarovista, Edgewater Glen, and Catalpa Gardens condominium developments. This neighborhood of Chicago is also well known for its antique shops, as the Broadway Antique Market and Brownstone Antiques call the Edgewater area their home.

==Neighborhoods==
Edgewater consists of several neighborhoods. In the southwest quadrant is Andersonville. North of it is Magnolia Glen and Edgewater Glen—and Edgewater Beach is located in the eastern part of the neighborhood, the portion of the community that borders the lake, east of the elevated tracks of the Red Line.

===Andersonville===


Andersonville is a neighborhood in western Edgewater / Uptown. Once a sleepy little village made up primarily of Swedish immigrants, the community is particularly known for its diversity, including a continued Swedish cultural presence led by the Swedish American Museum and other Swedish businesses. From the 1980s through the present time, the neighborhood has been well known as a neighborhood where many lesbians live, although the reality is more akin to the diversity mentioned above. Swedish businesses include the bar Simon&#x27;s Tavern, a former basement speakeasy, which serves the Swedish wine drink &quot;as glögg,&quot; and Svea restaurants. At one time there were more Swedes in Chicago than any city outside of Stockholm. Many of Andersonville&#x27;s Swedes were carpenters, contractors and architects, and played a significant role in building the city.

A significant number of Middle-Eastern businesses and a new influx of families with children all make this a very diverse population. Andersonville is also known for its unique commercial district, made up almost entirely of a variety of independent locally owned specialty shops, restaurants, and service providers.

The Andersonville Commercial Historic District, which runs between 4900 and 5800 N. Clark Street, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in March 2010. It joined the nearby residential Lakewood Balmoral Historic District.

The approximate street boundaries of Andersonville, as defined by the Andersonville Chamber of Commerce, are Lawrence (4800 N) to the south, Victoria (5800 N) to the north, Ravenswood (1800 W) to the west, and Magnolia (1250 W) to the east. The heart of the Andersonville commercial district is Clark and Berwyn (5300 N).

The stretch of Clark St. south of Foster Ave. (where Andersonville has expanded across community boundaries into northern Uptown) is sometimes called South Foster, or SoFo.

Andersonville&#x27;s roots as a community extend well back into the 19th century, when immigrant Swedish farmers started moving north into what was then a distant suburb of Chicago. In the 1850s the area north of Foster and east of Clark was a large cherry orchard, and families had only begun to move into the fringes of what is now Andersonville. The neighborhood&#x27;s first school, the Andersonville School, was built in 1854 at the corner of those two thoroughfares, and served as the area&#x27;s primary school until 1908.

After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, wooden homes were outlawed in Chicago. Swedish immigrants, who could not afford to build homes of stone or brick, began to move outside of the city&#x27;s northern limits. Swedish immigrants continued to arrive in Andersonville through the beginning of the 20th century, settling in the newly built homes surrounding Clark St. Before long, the entire commercial strip was dominated by Swedish businesses, from delis to hardware stores, shoe stores to blacksmiths, and bakeries to realty companies. The local churches, such as Immanuel Evangelical Lutheran Church, Ebenezer Lutheran Church, and First Evangelical Free Church were also built by Swedes, and reflected the religious diversity of the new arrivals.

Like most other European-American ethnic groups, Swedes began to move to the suburbs during the Depression and post-war periods, and the neighborhood began to decline. Concerned about the deteriorating commercial situation, the Uptown Clark Street Business Association renewed its commitment to its Swedish heritage by renaming itself the Andersonville Chamber of Commerce. On October 17, 1964 Andersonville was rededicated in a ceremony attended by Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley and Illinois Governor Otto Kerner. At about the same time, the annual Swedish tradition of celebrating the summer solstice blossomed into Midsommarfest, which has since grown into one of Chicago&#x27;s largest street festivals.

While some of the Swedish-owned businesses gave way to stores and restaurants owned by Koreans, Lebanese, and Cubans, many remained in Andersonville, serving the remaining second- and third-generation Swedes as well as the new arrivals to the neighborhood. In 1976, a Swedish American Museum that had been on the drawing boards for fifty years was opened to the public in a ceremony attended by King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden. He was also present when it later moved into larger quarters at 5211 N. Clark, where it remains today.

In the late 1980s, Andersonville began a period of revival as professionals rediscovered its lovely housing stock and proximity to the lakefront. A large lesbian and gay population developed, spurred by the opening of such businesses as Women &amp; Children First, a bookstore focusing on feminist authors and topics. New gift shops and ethnic eateries opened up and gave Clark St. a new commercial vitality and diversity.

Today, in addition to being one of the most concentrated areas of Swedish culture in the United States, Andersonville is home to a diverse assortment of devoted residents and businesses, including one of Chicago&#x27;s largest LGBTQ+ communities, a collection of Middle Eastern restaurants and bakeries, and a thriving Hispanic commercial area north of Catalpa Avenue.

===Edgewater Glen===
Edgewater Glen is located in the north central part of Edgewater. It was named from the streets Glenwood Ave. and Glenlake Ave. that cross in the center of Edgewater Glen. A local residents and businesses organization called Edgewater Glen Association (EGA), incorporated in 1972, invented the name. The association, which is still active (2024), determined the boundaries of Edgewater Glen as: the south side of Granville Ave (north), the west side of Broadway Ave (east), the south side of Norwood St (south), and the east side of Clark St (west). 

EGA hosts and participates in neighborhood annual events and programming, including public forums with elected officials, plant swaps, corner beautification, the Edgewater Yard Sale, and the EGA Garden Walk which celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2023.

EGA also is notable for its work to maintain the tree canopy within Edgewater, including regular inventories and coordination for the planting of parkway trees. In 2022, EGA embarked on an effort to catalogue old growth parkway trees resulting in the publication of a study of the heritage trees (50 years and older) of Edgewater Glen as well as a toolkit that can be used by any organization to identify and track heritage trees.

An exhibit was held to feature the toolkit and study at the Edgewater Historical Society on Arbor Day, 2023 which marked the kickoff of an effort by the Edgewater Historical Society to work with the Edgewater Environmental Coalition and all Edgewater Block Clubs to inventory ALL of the heritage parkway trees in Edgewater.

===Broadway===
Broadway (along with Andersonville&#x27;s Clark St., to the west) is the main commercial street running North and South through Edgewater. It separates the Edgewater Beach area (dominated by highrises and apartment buildings) to the east, from Andersonville and Edgewater Glen (dominated by single-family homes) to the west. In the 1920s, Broadway became a center of the new automobile trade with elaborate stylized showroom buildings. While these businesses are now gone, the street maintains commercial trade and at least one of those car palaces remains. In addition, a wide array of dining is available including Ethiopian, French, Japanese, Thai, and fine American, as well as pubs, fast food, and pizza.

===Sheridan Road and Edgewater Beach===

Sheridan Rd., which follows the lakefront in eastern-Edgewater is the main North–South thoroughfare for traffic to/from Lake Shore Drive. Lake Shore Dr. at Hollywood Ave. where all traffic is routed onto either Hollywood Ave. or Sheridan Rd. As it is the north end terminus of Chicago&#x27;s scenic Lake Shore Dr., this part of the neighborhood is sometimes congested with traffic along 4 lane roadways such as Clark St., Broadway and Ridge Avenues. The area around Sheridan Rd., west to Broadway Ave., is called Edgewater Beach. The neighborhood beaches are Foster Beach and Osterman (Hollywood) Beach. This area includes the northern reaches of Lincoln Park, Chicago&#x27;s largest public park.

North of Ardmore Ave. (5800 N) to Devon Ave. (6400 N), there are 4 lakefront parks, Osterman (Hollywood) Beach, George Lane Park, Berger Park, and a newly unnamed park just south of Granville (6200 N) between the Tiara &amp; El Lago condominiums. There is also a park on the southwest corner of Thorndale and Sheridan.

Accompanied by uniformly tall, grand old locust trees lining the road, Edgewater&#x27;s portion of Sheridan (North of Foster Ave., south of Devon Ave.) is a dense section of high-rise residential buildings on both sides of the Sheridan Rd. corridor. These include, Park Edgewater Condominiums, Hollywood Towers, Beach Point Tower, Horizon House Condominium, 6030 N. Sheridan, The Malibu, Malibu East, East Point Tower, The Tiara, El Lago, Granville Beach, Granville Tower, Sovereign Apartments, Shoreline Towers, Sheridan Shores Condominiums, Sheridan Point, and Park Tower and Mall. Many of these towers were built in the late 1950s to early 1970s. TV&#x27;s fictional characters Bob and Emily Hartley of The Bob Newhart Show called this area home, residing in the Thorndale Beach North Condominiums, 5901 N. Sheridan Rd.

There are a handful of mansions still remaining on Sheridan Rd., remnants of the 1880s to 1920s. Many of the original lakefront mansions that once lined Sheridan were razed with landfill added along the shoreline to make way for the high-rise buildings that exist there today. A few notable exceptions are Colvin House, at Thorndale Ave., Berger Park. and Sacred Heart School at Granville Ave., as well as two belonging to nearby Loyola University Chicago. To the South, at Sheridan, near Foster, there also remains a private tennis, pool and three par golf club, from the days when this area was dominated by mansions and the Edgewater Beach Hotel.

==LGBTQ community==
Beginning in the 1990s, Edgewater&#x27;s population of lesbian couples significantly increased. Residents named the relocation of the Andersonville feminist bookstore Women and Children First from Lakeview as a major catalyst, though others also sought to escape gentrification in Lakeview and Lincoln Park. Lesbian bars and other lesbian-centered businesses opened in Andersonville, and for a period of time the neighborhood was sometimes referred to as &quot;Girlstown,&quot; an alternative to Boystown in Lakeview. However, by the late 2000s, rising rents and the subsequent closing of many of those businesses led to a decline in the lesbian population.

At the time of the 2000 United States Census, the proportion of same-sex couples in Edgewater was 6.6% in the 60660 zip code and 8.0% in the 60640 zip code. This compares with the US national average of 1.1%. Starting in the 2000s, rising rent and gentrification in the Lakeview and Boystown neighborhoods caused many LGBT people to move further north. In 2012 Trulia rated Edgewater as one of the ten gayest neighborhoods in America. In 2017, Trulia and dating website OkCupid stated that Edgewater had the highest percentage of gay single people in the city, more than Lakeview and Hyde Park/Kenwood.

==International community==

Recognizing the proximity to Chicago&#x27;s Lakefront and access to the Red Line elevated train, an influx of new residents have relocated to Edgewater over the past 20 years. Many of Edgewater&#x27;s new residents are immigrants from the Horn of Africa and the former Yugoslavia. The area has a great density of Bosnian, Serb and Croat residents. These people, troubled by civil war and tough conditions in their homeland, have been encouraged to settle in the area. Ethiopians, Eritreans and Somalis from the Horn region live and socialize in Edgewater. The city is known for accepting new, thriving enclaves of ethnicities in centuries past. This new settlement is a modern revival of that tradition. Of recent, many new residents have come from the neighboring Lakeview and Lincoln Park neighborhoods, due to the affordable housing and Edgewater&#x27;s proximity to the city&#x27;s rapid transit (CTA) system which allows for an easy commute into the city&#x27;s downtown. On the streets of Edgewater, one can encounter women in traditional dress and grandmothers strolling with their grandchildren, while the middle generation is out making a living in the new world of Chicago.

==Politics==
The Edgewater community area has supported the Democratic Party in the past two presidential elections. In the 2016 presidential election, the Edgewater cast 22,676 votes for Hillary Clinton and cast 2,546 votes for Donald Trump (86.07% to 9.66%). In the 2012 presidential election, Edgewater cast 20,028 votes for Barack Obama and cast 3,083 votes for Mitt Romney (84.67% to 13.03%).

==Education==

Edgewater is home to several Chicago Public Schools (CPS) campuses. The local public high school is Nicholas Senn High School, established in 1913. In addition, four of the neighborhood&#x27;s elementary schools — Hayt, Swift, Peirce and Goudy — achieved a level 1 (excellent) status from CPS in 2013. Those schools feed into Senn, which will help it maintain its ranking.

There are several Catholic and other religiously affiliated schools also in the neighborhood including Northside Catholic Academy&#x27;s primary school campus at St. Gertrude church.

The Edgewater Branch of the Chicago Public Library serves the area, and the nearby Bezazian Branch in Uptown also provides services to people in Edgewater.

Loyola University of Chicago&#x27;s campus borders northeastern Edgewater and has crossed into the area. The college established itself on the lake at the north end of Sheridan Road, where it crosses into Rogers Park, in 1906.

==Transportation==

A majority of Edgewater&#x27;s public transportation needs are met by the Chicago Transit Authority, which provides resident and visitor access to the Red Line service of the Chicago Elevated railway rapid transit. The Red Line runs north to the city limits and south to Wrigley Field, the downtown Chicago Loop, Rate Field and ends on the South Side at 95th Street. Edgewater&#x27;s elevated Red Line tracks run next to Broadway Avenue, and its four stations are Berwyn, Bryn Mawr, Thorndale, and Granville.

Along Edgewater&#x27;s western border are the commuter rail tracks of Metra&#x27;s North Line, with stations in the nearby surrounding community areas at Ravenswood and Rogers Park providing transit to downtown or to Chicago&#x27;s North Shore Suburbs.

The Chicago Transit Authority also operates numerous bus routes in Edgewater, with several running along North Lake Shore Drive with express services to downtown Chicago, including the Loop, via North Michigan Avenue and its Magnificent Mile.

Private entities also offer many transportation services. The areas is served by car-sharing services such as I-GO and Zipcar as well as bicycle-sharing services such as Divvy. Taxi and limousine services are plentiful in the area. Bicycles and rickshaws can be found in the summer for rent near Foster Beach. Bike paths are also available on some major streets. Manicured walking and running paths are found throughout the parkland near the lake, including the Chicago Lakefront Trail, which is also popular with bicycle commuters.

<text>Toxiphobia in non-human animals is rejection of foods with tastes, odors, or appearances which are followed by illness resulted from toxins found in these foods. In humans, toxiphobia is the irrational fear of poisons and being poisoned.

== Notable people ==

* Kurt Gödel (1906–1978), Austrian-American scientist who, after the assassination of his close friend Moritz Schlick, developed an irrational fear of being poisoned, and only accepted food cooked by his wife.
* Nicolae Ceaușescu (1918–1989), Romanian dictator, who ordered not to have any air conditioning in Palace of the Parliament due to fear of being poisoned by ventilation.

<doc id="665503" wikidata="Q675510" url="?curid=665503" title="Science Olympiad">
<text>Science Olympiad, sometimes abbreviated as Scioly, is an American team competition in which students compete in 23 events pertaining to various fields of science, including earth science, biology, chemistry, physics, and engineering. Over 7,800 middle school and high school teams from 50 U.S. states compete each year. U.S. territories do not compete; however, several international teams do compete in Science Olympiad tournaments in the US.

There are multiple levels of competition: invitational, regional, state, and national. Invitational tournaments, usually run by high schools and universities, are unofficial tournaments and serve as practice for regional and state competitions. Teams that excel at regional competitions advance to the state level; the top one or two teams from each state (depending on the state) then advance the national level. Winners later receive several kinds of awards, including medals, trophies and plaques, as well as scholarships. The program for elementary-age students is less common and less consistent. Schools have flexibility to implement the program to meet their needs. Some communities host competitive elementary tournaments.

==History==
The first recorded Science Olympiad was held on Saturday, November 23, 1974, at St. Andrews Presbyterian College in Laurinburg, North Carolina. Dr. Barnes and Dr. David Wetmore were the originators of this event. Fifteen schools from North and South Carolina participated in this event. It was a day-long affair, with competitions and demonstrations for high school students in the areas of biology, chemistry, and physics. There were four event periods during this day and each event period had one fun event (like beaker race or paper airplane), one demonstration (like glassblowing and holography), and one serious event (like periodic table quiz or Science Bowl). An article by David Wetmore was published in the Journal of Chemical Education in January 1978 documenting the success of recruiting students through Science Olympiad. St. Andrews Presbyterian College continues to host a Science Olympiad tournament to this day. Mr. John C. &quot;Jack&quot; Cairns was a teacher at Dover High School in Delaware when he learned about the Science Olympiad tournament in North Carolina. He shared this information with Dr. Douglas R. Macbeth, the Delaware State Science Supervisor. Mr. Cairns was appointed to a steering committee to organize the first Science Olympiad in Delaware which took place at Delaware State University in the Spring of 1977. A write-up in &quot;The Science Teacher&quot; of December 1977 caught the attention of Gerard Putz, who proposed that the program be expanded throughout the United States. After competition tests in Michigan at the Lawrence Institute of Technology and Oakland University in 1983 and 1984, Putz and Delaware director John Cairns took their plan for a national competition to the National Science Teachers Conference in Boston. The first National Tournament was attended by representatives of 17 states, held at Michigan State University in 1985. Since then, the program has expanded greatly, with 60 teams present in each division at the National Tournament.

== International Teams ==
Since 2012, a Global Ambassador Team from Japan has been invited to attend the national tournament as part of a partnership between Science Olympiad, MEXT and JST. Each year, the Grand Prize for winning the Japan High School Science Championships (JHSSC), a competition styled after the U.S.-based Science Olympiad is a trip to the U.S. to participate in the Science Olympiad National Tournament. The Japanese Global Ambassador Team does however only compete on a limited basis as unranked guests. Japan continues to send a team, as of the 2024 National Tournament. The Japanese Global Ambassador Teams are the best known international teams that participate in Science Olympiad however other countries do occasionally participate in tournaments.

Canada has multiple active Science Olympiad teams and participated in the nationals tournaments in the U.S. between 1995 and 1998 but has not sent a team since although Canadian teams do still occasionally participate in tournaments in the U.S.

Peru also sends teams to the U.S. to compete in Science Olympiad tournaments but Peru has never attended a national tournament. Peru&#x27;s participation is for the most part coordinated by United Technologies for Kids (UTK) a NGO focused on STEM education in Latin America.

==Divisions==
There are three divisions in the hierarchy of Science Olympiad:
* Division A for elementary school (grades K–6)
* Division B for middle school (grades 6–9)
* Division C for high school (grades 9–12)

The national tournament and generally state and regional tournaments are only for divisions B and C. Division A teams usually have separate interscholastic tournaments, apart from the more common intra-school competitions. Note that 6th and 9th graders have the option of competing in either of the two divisions in which they meet the grade requirements and are part of the competing school. (6th graders can compete in divisions A and B while 9th graders can compete in divisions B and C.) A middle school may, however, only use up to 5 members who have graduated to the next school if they are in 9th grade or lower. Students in grades lower than the division in which the school competes in may also be on the team. Teams are restricted to five 9th graders for division B and seven 12th graders for division C. Students may not participate on multiple teams, e.g. a 9th grader on both a high school and middle school team would not be allowed.

== Events and event history==
In Divisions B and C, teams may compete in up to twenty-three main events, which usually occur over a single day (some tournaments, such as the Texas State tournament, run competitive events over multiple days); done by a team of no more than 15 members. Events fall into five main categories: Life, Personal, and Social Science, Earth &amp; Space Science, Physical Science &amp; Chemistry, Technology &amp; Engineering, Inquiry &amp; Nature of Science. They are either knowledge-based (for example, written tests on earth science, physics, astronomy, or biology), hands-on (for example, chemistry lab practicals or events involving both device testing and an exam), or engineering-based (participants construct a device before the competition to do specified tasks on the day of the competition).

Knowledge-based events generally have two to three participants taking a test and/or mathematically analyzing data. Examples of such events are Anatomy and Physiology, Meteorology, Codebusters, and Green Generation.

Hands-on events generally consist of two participants performing experiments or interacting with physical objects to achieve a certain goal. Some examples are Experimental Design and Write it Do it.

Engineering-based events have a team of two participants. They are to construct a device following a specific event&#x27;s parameters and test the device against others. Examples include Bridge, Flight, and Roller Coaster.

The majority of events allow two team members, though a few allow more. If one member is unable to attend an event, the other is able to continue, depending on the event. If the team has one available, a backup team member may be placed with the member as opposed to their former partner.

The list of events and rules for each change and are updated every year to input dynamism and to limit the advantages of more experienced teams. Events of each type often rotate, with each event staying in competition rotation for at least two years. For example, the Division C vehicle event cycle is two years each of Electric Vehicle, Mousetrap Vehicle, Gravity Vehicle, and Scrambler respectively.

States have substantial leeway in how they run their organization; several states, notably North Carolina and Texas, run altered slates of events; in the case of Texas, teams can choose to replace National events with state-exclusive events.

==Trial and pilot events==
Trial/Pilot events are, at Regional and State tournaments, events that are specific to that state that are being considered as events for the next year. At Regionals and States, these events may count towards the team&#x27;s score. At Nationals, however, there is a completely different set of Trial/Pilot events, sometimes known as &quot;alternate events&quot; because the people entering them do not have to be on the official team. These do not count towards the team&#x27;s score, but ribbons and medals are usually awarded.

===Distinction between trial and pilot events===
The terms &quot;trial event&quot; and &quot;pilot event&quot; (also called &quot;exploratory event&quot;) are sometimes interchangeable, both pertaining to an event that is not an official, national event for the year. However, at the National Tournament, there are often two differences. First, in 2010, it was announced that medals would only be awarded to the top 3 in the Trial events, but not at all in the Pilot events. Also, the Trial event are often much closer to becoming official events for following years than pilot events. Almost all of the Trial events from recent National tournaments have become official events within a few years of the tournament, while the same is not true for almost any of the pilot events.

==Team structure==
Teams are hosted by the school from which the participants attend. A team can consist of up to 15 students and any number of alternates; some states allow more students per team. At the middle school level at nationals, only five ninth graders are allowed to compete on one team; at the high school level, only seven twelfth graders are allowed per team. However, state organizations occasionally amend these rules. Homeschool groups may also form as many teams as they need to compete, provided each team consists only of students residing in, at most, two contiguous counties.

Although teams may have an unlimited number of alternates, it is implicitly stated within the rules that competitors present at the event must have completed all of the work on their event. This is specifically aimed at building events. It is illegal for teams to have their alternates as &quot;builders&quot; and their formal team members as &quot;thinkers&quot;. Judges at the event are allowed to ask any question of the machine or contraption in an effort to keep the scenario above from occurring. Nonetheless, competitors, coaches, and entire teams are expected to have integrity and to abide by this rule.

==Scoring==

The of the competition is determined by each team&#x27;s overall score. Each school is ranked in every event based on that event&#x27;s rules. For each type of event, the ranking differs. Knowledge events are scored by the correct number of answers; the team with the highest score will receive 1st place, the second highest will receive 2nd place, and so on. If two teams are tied, there are usually tiebreaker questions that apply only to those teams that are tied. The non-testing events are scored based on the individual requirements listed in the Science Olympiad rule book, released each year to reflect new events, requirements, and clarifications. Some events, such as the knowledge/testing-based will rank teams by using the highest scores. However others may use the lowest score. The team&#x27;s overall score is then calculated by adding together the rank of the school in all events (e.g. 1st place receives 1 point, 2nd place 2 points, etc.). The team with the lowest overall score is declared the winner. However, some state competitions choose to score the competition by awarding more points per place (e.g. 13 points for 1st place, 12 points for 2nd place, etc.) and having the team with the most points being declared the winner.

There are several ways to break a tie (draw):

* One method for tie-breaking is based on medals where the team with more first place medals wins. If both teams have the same amount of first places, it moves to second place medals and so on. This is the method that the National Tournament uses.
* Before a competition, the event organizer decides on several events to be used as tie-breakers. If two teams get the same score overall, the team that rates highest in that one event will take the lead.
* A third way of tie-breaking is to use a team&#x27;s score in trial/pilot events. The team with the best combined score in trial events would win the competition when this method is used.
* In some competitions, there also may questions added into event, labeled as tie-breakers. If needed, these questions can be used as tie breakers, although this type of tie-breaker is generally for only the event and not the overall rank.

==Competition levels==

Science Olympiad competitions occur at the regional, state and national level. Normally, the top few teams advance from the regional level to state competition, the exact number depending on how many regions there are and how many teams compete. For example, in Ohio, the number of teams qualifying for the state tournament from each regional depends solely on the number of teams participating at that regional, whereas in New York the allocation system involved determining whether or not the winning team in a regional tournament had won the previous year (this method has since been discontinued). In most states, the top team advances from the state to the national competition. Some states with a larger number of teams are allotted a second spot at the national competition to represent their larger participation. Currently, 120 teams compete at the national level each year (60 from Division B and 60 from Division C); the number has changed over the years to accommodate growing participation.

Many states also hold invitational tournaments. These competitions serve as &quot;practice rounds&quot; for qualifying tournaments, and are hosted by individual middle schools, high schools and/or colleges. Invitationals occur most commonly in January or February, although there have been some as early as October or as late as April. Teams can participate in invitationals from multiple states depending on availability. At some invitationals, only a few events are held. However, many invitational tournaments mimic regional and state competitions in their competitive intensity. For example, MIT hosts an invitational tournament each year with around 70 teams from over a dozen states, including 20 or more past national qualifiers. Other tournaments, especially in the Midwest, are well known for their quality and competitiveness. In this way, teams can gain extra practice before competing in regional, state, or national tournaments. In 2014, Yale University became one of the first institutions of higher education to host a tournament run by Science Olympiad alumni, with several more following over the next few years.

==National tournament==

The National Science Olympiad competition is held in late May at a different university every year. Teams compete at the state competition with the top one or two schools in Division B and Division C each earning a spot at the national competition. Some states are given a second slot, based on the membership within the division. The total number of invited teams in each division is equal to 60 and the national tournament hosts 120 teams. In 2012, at the University of Central Florida, a team from Japan was invited as a Global Ambassador Team. Although they competed in several events, their scores were not tallied against the state teams.

The competition officially begins with opening ceremonies on Friday night that usually include a notable speaker, such as a Nobel Laureate. A traditional Swap Meet follows the opening ceremonies which is an opportunity for teams to meet and greet. They bring state memorabilia to trade with other teams. The most popular items include hats, license plates, T-shirts, and key chains.

Saturday includes several time blocks. Each block includes a 60-minute section for each study event, plus a 15-minute break time for competitors to get from one event to another.

That night, a formal Awards Ceremony is held. It opens with a short speech followed by awarding medals for the top six teams in each event. Points for all the events are added together to determine an overall national team winner. The trial events are not included in this tally. The top ten teams in each division are recognized with trophies and plaques.

In some national tournaments, scholarships are awarded to the top teams in each event. For the 2005 and 2010 competitions, held at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, first-place event winners received full four-year tuition waivers to the university. At the 2006 National Tournament, host Indiana University awarded $7,000 annual scholarships to those who finished first place in Division C and who attend the university in their freshman year. The George Washington University offered Division C gold medalists at its 2008 National Tournament a $20,000 stipend for those who were accepted and attended GWU. In 2012, the University of Central Florida offered $30,000 scholarships to the university for first place medalists in Division C. Additional awards may also provided by sponsors and industry leaders for specific events. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provided first place medalists in Disease Detectives (Divisions B &amp; C) with a trip for the two competitors and their coach to tour its facility in Atlanta, Georgia.

=== List of National Championships by School ===


=== List of States by Number of National Tournaments Hosted ===
Seven universities have hosted the National Tournament twice: Michigan State University, Ohio State University, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Indiana University-Bloomington, University of Central Florida, Wichita State University, and Wright State University.

==Division A==
Division A generally covers elementary school students (through 6th grade). Schools which wish to start a Science Olympiad program at their school can take advantage of the resources offered on the National Science Olympiad website. There is no National membership fee required to participate in Elementary Division activities. An appropriate program will depend upon the objectives and resources of the local school or community. Programs can range from a Fun Night to a large competitive tournament. Some Elementary programs have existed as long as the National program, and have developed additional resources that schools may find helpful.

== Study Resources ==
Many Study Resources may be found at Science Olympiad, which is the main website for the Science Olympiad Wikipedia, which contains extensive information about the competitions and what to prepare. There are also practice tests available on the website. The rules manual for the 2023–2024 season can also be found there.

<text>Roquefort-sur-Soulzon (; , ) is a commune in the Aveyron department, in the region of Occitania, southern France.

Roquefort is located on the Causse du Larzac and is famous for its ewe derived products including milk, wool and meat. Much of the activity in the commune centres on the production and distribution of Roquefort cheese. To be legally termed Roquefort cheese, it must follow the rules laid down by the federal standards of the &quot;Appellation d’Origine&quot;. According to archaeologists, the cheese making process in the specific caves dates back to 900 C.E.

A visitor centre illustrates the process of making Roquefort cheese and offers guests a chance to sample and purchase the product. Visitors can also visit the Cambalou caves which are long and wide in which the cheeses are aged before they are ready to be sold.

<doc id="665532" wikidata="Q273140" url="?curid=665532" title="Gamepad">
<text>A gamepad is a type of video game controller held in two hands, where the fingers (especially thumbs) are used to provide input. They are typically the main input device for video game consoles.

== Features ==

Some common additions to the standard pad include shoulder buttons (also called &quot;bumpers&quot;) and triggers placed along the edges of the pad (shoulder buttons are usually digital, i.e. merely on/off; while triggers are usually analog); centrally placed &quot;start&quot;, &quot;select&quot;, and &quot;home&quot; buttons, and an internal motor to provide force feedback. Analog triggers, like that of the GameCube controller, are pressure-sensitive and games can read in the amount of pressure applied to one to control the intensity of a certain action, such as how forceful water is to be sprayed in &quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot;.

There are programmable joysticks that can emulate keyboard input. Generally they have been made to circumvent the lack of joystick support in some computer games, e.g. the Belkin Nostromo SpeedPad n52. There are several programs that emulate keyboard and mouse input with a gamepad such as the free and open-source cross-platform software antimicro, Enjoy2, or proprietary commercial solutions such as JoyToKey, Xpadder, and Pinnacle Game Profiler.

== History ==
===Analog joysticks===
The 1962 video game &quot;Spacewar!&quot; initially used toggle switches built into the computer readout display to control the game. These switches were awkward and uncomfortable to use, so Alan Kotok and Bob Saunders built and wired in a detached control device for the game. This device has been called the earliest gamepad.

===Entry into the mass market===
It would take many years for the gamepad to rise to prominence, as during the 1970s and the early 1980s joysticks and paddles were the dominant video game controllers, though several Atari joystick port-compatible pushbutton controllers were also available. The third generation of video games saw many major changes, and the eminence of gamepads in the video game market.

Nintendo developed a gamepad device for directional inputs, a D-pad with a &quot;cross&quot; design for their &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; handheld game. This design would be incorporated into their &quot;Game &amp; Watch&quot; series and console controllers such as the standard NES controller. Though developed because they were more compact than joysticks, and thus more appropriate for handheld games, D-pads were soon found by developers to be more comfortable to use than joysticks. The D-pad soon became a ubiquitous element on console gamepads, though to avoid infringing on Nintendo&#x27;s patent, most controller manufacturers use a cross in a circle shape for the D-pad instead of a simple cross.

===Continued refinements===
The original Sega Genesis/Mega Drive control pad has three face buttons, but a six-button pad was later released. The SNES controller also featured six action buttons, with four face buttons arranged in a diamond formation, and two shoulder buttons positioned to be used with the index fingers, a design which has been imitated by most controllers since. The inclusion of six action buttons was influenced by the popularity of the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; arcade series, which utilized six buttons.For most of the 1980s and early 1990s, analog joysticks were the predominant form of gaming controller for PCs, while console gaming controllers were mostly digital. This changed in 1996 when all three major consoles introduced an optional analog control. The Sony Dual Analog Controller had twin convex analog thumbsticks, the Sega Saturn 3D Control Pad had a single analog thumbstick, and the Nintendo 64 controller combined digital and analog controllers in a single body, starting a trend to have both an analog stick and a d-pad.

Despite these changes, gamepads essentially continued to follow the template set by the NES controller (a horizontally-oriented controller with two or more action buttons positioned for use with the right thumb, and a directional pad positioned for use with the left thumb).

===Three-dimensional control===
Though three-dimensional games rose to prominence in the mid-1990s, controllers continued to mostly operate on two-dimensional principles. Players would have to hold down a button to change the axes along which the controls operate rather than being able to control movement along all three axes at once. One of the first gaming consoles, the Fairchild Channel F, did have a controller which provided six degrees of freedom, but the processing limitations of the console itself prevented there from being any software to take advantage of this ability. In 1994, Logitech introduced the CyberMan, the first practical six-degrees-of-freedom controller; however, it sold poorly due to its high price, poor build quality, and limited software support. Industry insiders blame the CyberMan&#x27;s high profile and costly failure for the gaming industry&#x27;s lack of interest in developing 3D control over the next several years.
The Wii Remote is shaped like a television remote control and contains tilt sensors and three-dimensional pointing which the system uses to understand all directions of movement and rotation (back and forth around the pitch, roll, and yaw axes). The controller is also multifunctional and has an expansion port which can be used for a variety of peripherals. An analog stick peripheral, called &quot;Nunchuk,&quot; also contains an accelerometer but unlike the Wii Remote, it lacks any pointer functionality.

== Usage across platforms ==
Gamepads are also available for personal computers. Examples of PC gamepads include the Asus Eee Stick, the Gravis PC, the Microsoft SideWinder and Saitek Cyborg range, and the Steam Controller. Third-party USB adapters and software can be employed to utilize console gamepads on PCs; the DualShock 3, DualShock 4, DualSense, Wii Remote and Joy-Con can be used with third-party software on systems with Bluetooth functionality, with USB additionally usable on DualShock 3, DualShock 4 and DualSense. Xbox 360 and Xbox One controllers are officially supported on Windows with Microsoft-supplied drivers; a dongle can be used to connect them wirelessly, or the controller can be connected directly to the computer over USB (wired versions of Xbox 360 controllers were marketed by Microsoft as PC gamepads, while the Xbox One controller can be connected to a PC via its Micro USB slot).

== Non-gaming use ==
Gamepads or devices closely modelled on them are sometimes used for controlling real machinery and vehicles, as they are familiar to users and (in the case of actual gamepads) provide an off-the-shelf solution. The US Army and US Navy use Xbox controllers
for operating devices, and the British Army uses a device modelled on gamepads to operate systems on the Challenger 2 main battle tank.
The &quot;Titan&quot; submersible notoriously used a gamepad for control.

<text>A neuroscientist (or neurobiologist) is a scientist specializing in neuroscience that deals with the anatomy and function of neurons, neural circuits, and glial cells, and their behavioral, biological, and psychological roles in health and disease.

Neuroscientists generally work as researchers within a college, university, government agency, or private industry setting. In research-oriented careers, neuroscientists design and conduct scientific experiments on the nervous system and its functions. They can engage in basic or applied research. Basic research seeks to expand current understanding of the nervous system, whereas applied research seeks to address a specific problem, such as developing a treatment for a neurological disorder. 

Neuroscientists have numerous career opportunities outside of academic research, including careers in industry, science writing, government program management, science advocacy, and education. A neuroscientist commonly holds a doctorate in a medical science.

== Job overview ==

=== Job description ===

Neuroscientists focus primarily on the study and research of the nervous system. The nervous system is composed of the brain, spinal cord and nerve cells. Studies of the nervous system may focus on the cellular level, as in studies of the ion channels, or instead may focus on a systemic level as in behavioural or cognitive studies. A significant portion of nervous system studies is devoted to understanding the diseases that affect the nervous system, like multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer&#x27;s, Parkinson&#x27;s, and Lou Gehrig&#x27;s. Research commonly occurs in private, government and public research institutions and universities.

Some common tasks for neuroscientists are:
* Developing experiments and leading groups of people in supporting roles
* Conducting theoretical and computational neuronal data analysis
* Research and development of new treatments for neurological disorders
* Working with doctors to perform experimental studies of new drugs on willing patients
* Following safety and sanitation procedures and guidelines
* Dissecting experimental specimens

=== Salary ===
The overall median salary for neuroscientists in the United States was $79,940 in May 2014. Neuroscientists are usually full-time employees. Median salaries at common work places in the United States are shown below.
=== Work environment ===
Neuroscientists research and study both the biological and psychological aspects of the nervous system. Once neuroscientists finish their post doctoral programs, 39% go on to perform more doctoral work, while 36% take on faculty jobs. Neuroscientists use a wide range of mathematical methods, computer programs, biochemical approaches and imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography angiography, and diffusion tensor imaging. Imaging techniques allow scientists to observe physical changes in the brain and spinal cord, as signals occur. Neuroscientists can also be part of several different neuroscience organizations where they can publish and read different research topics.

=== Job outlook ===
Neuroscience is expecting job growth of about 8% from 2014 to 2024, a considerably greater than average job growth rate when compared to other professions. Factors leading to this growth include an aging population, new discoveries leading to new areas of research, and increasing utilization of medications. Government funding for research will also continue to influence the demand for this specialty.

=== Education ===
Neuroscientists typically enroll in a four-year undergraduate program and then move on to a PhD program for graduate studies. Once finished with their graduate studies, neuroscientists may continue doing postdoctoral work to gain more lab experience and explore new laboratory methods. In their undergraduate years, neuroscientists typically take physical and life science courses to gain a foundation in the field of research. Typical undergraduate majors include biology, behavioral neuroscience, and cognitive neuroscience.

Many colleges and universities now have PhD training programs in the neurosciences, often with divisions between cognitive, cellular and molecular, computational and systems neuroscience.

=== Interdisciplinary fields ===
Neuroscience has a unique perspective in that it can be applied in a broad range of disciplines, and thus the fields neuroscientists work in vary. Neuroscientists may study topics from the large hemispheres of the brain to neurotransmitters and synapses occurring in neurons at a micro-level. Some fields that combine psychology and neurobiology include cognitive neuroscience, and behavioural neuroscience. Cognitive neuroscientists study human consciousness, specifically the brain, and how it can be seen through a lens of biochemical and biophysical processes. Behavioral neuroscience encompasses the whole nervous system, environment and the brain how these areas show us aspects of motivation, learning, and motor skills along with many others. Computational neuroscience uses mathematical models to understand how the brain processes information.

== History ==

=== Egyptian understanding and early Greek philosophers ===
Some of the first writings about the brain come from the Egyptians. In about 3000 BC the first known written description of the brain also indicated that the location of brain injuries may be related to specific symptoms. This document contrasted common theory at the time. Most of the Egyptians&#x27; other writings are very spiritual, describing thought and feelings as responsibilities of the heart. This idea was widely accepted and can be found into 17th century Europe.

Plato believed that the brain was the locus of mental processes. However, Aristotle believed instead the heart to be the source of mental processes and that the brain acted as a cooling system for the cardiovascular system.

=== Galen ===
In the Middle Ages, Galen made a considerable impact on human anatomy. In terms of neuroscience, Galen described the seven cranial nerves&#x27; functions along with giving a foundational understanding of the spinal cord. When it came to the brain, he believed that sensory sensation was caused in the middle of the brain, while the motor sensations were produced in the anterior portion of the brain. Galen imparted some ideas on mental health disorders and what caused these disorders to arise. He believed that the cause was backed-up black bile, and that epilepsy was caused by phlegm. Galen&#x27;s observations on neuroscience were not challenged for many years.

=== Medieval European beliefs and Andreas Vesalius ===
Medieval beliefs generally held true the proposals of Galen, including the attribution of mental processes to specific ventricles in the brain. Functions of regions of the brain were defined based on their texture and composition: memory function was attributed to the posterior ventricle, a harder region of the brain and thus a good place for memory storage.

Andreas Vesalius redirected the study of neuroscience away from the anatomical focus; he considered the attribution of functions based on location to be crude. Pushing away from the superficial proposals made by Galen and medieval beliefs, Vesalius did not believe that studying anatomy would lead to any significant advances in the understanding of thinking and the brain.

== Current and developing research topics ==

Research in neuroscience is expanding and becoming increasingly interdisciplinary. Many current research projects involve the integration of computer programs in mapping the human nervous system. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) sponsored Human Connectome Project, launched in 2009, hopes to establish a highly detailed map of the human nervous system and its millions of connections. Detailed neural mapping could lead the way for advances in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders.

Neuroscientists are also at work studying epigenetics, the study of how certain factors that we face in our everyday lives not only affect us and our genes but also how they will affect our children and change their genes to adapt to the environments we faced.

=== Behavioral and developmental studies ===
Neuroscientists have been working to show how the brain is far more elastic and able to change than we once thought. They have been using work that psychologists previously reported to show how the observations work, and give a model for it.

One recent behavioral study is that of phenylketonuria (PKU), a disorder that heavily damages the brain due to toxic levels of the amino acid phenylalanine. Before neuroscientists had studied this disorder, psychologists did not have a mechanistic understanding as to how this disorder caused high levels of the amino acid and thus treatment was not well understood, and oftentimes, was inadequate. The neuroscientists that studied this disorder used the previous observations of psychologists to propose a mechanistic model that gave a better understanding of the disorder at the molecular level. This in turn led to better understanding of the disorder as a whole and greatly changed treatment that led to better lives for patients with the disorder.

Another recent study was that of mirror neurons, neurons that fire when mimicking or observing another animal or person that is making some sort of expression, movement, or gesture. This study was again one where neuroscientists used the observations of psychologists to create a model for how the observation worked. The initial observation was that newborn infants mimicked facial expressions that were expressed to them. Scientists were not certain that newborn infants were developed enough to have complex neurons that allowed them to mimic different people and there was something else that allowed them to mimic expressions. Neuroscientists then provided a model for what was occurring and concluded that infants did in fact have these neurons that fired when watching and mimicking facial expressions.

=== Effects of early experience on the brain ===
Neuroscientists have also studied the effects of &quot;nurture&quot; on the developing brain. Saul Schanberg and other neuroscientists did a study on how important nurturing touch is to the developing brains in rats. They found that the rats who were deprived of nurture from the mother for just one hour had reduced functions in processes like DNA synthesis and hormone secretion.

Michael Meaney and his colleagues found that the offspring of mother rats who provided significant nurture and attention tended to show less fear, responded more positively to stress, and functioned at higher levels and for longer times when fully mature. They also found that the rats who were given much attention as adolescents also gave their offspring the same amount of attention and thus showed that rats raised their offspring similar to how they were raised. These studies were also seen on a microscopic level where different genes were expressed for the rats that were given high amounts of nurture and those same genes were not expressed in the rats who received less attention.

The effects of nurture and touch were not only studied in rats, but also in newborn humans. Many neuroscientists have performed studies where the importance of touch is shown in newborn humans. The same results that were shown in rats, also held true for humans. Babies that received less touch and nurture developed slower than babies that received a lot of attention and nurture. Stress levels were also lower in babies that were nurtured regularly and cognitive development was also higher due to increased touch. Human offspring, much like rat offspring, thrive off of nurture, as shown by the various studies of neuroscientists.

<doc id="665542" wikidata="Q5483039" url="?curid=665542" title="Franciscan University of Steubenville">
<text>Franciscan University of Steubenville is a private Franciscan university in Steubenville, Ohio, United States. As of fall 2023, the university enrolled 3,750 students in 40 undergraduate and 8 graduate degree programs. The student body is majority Catholic, and Franciscan claims to have the largest number of students majoring in theology, catechetics, and philosophy of any Catholic university in the United States.

The school was established as the College of Steubenville in 1946 by the Franciscan Friars of the Third Order Regular at the request of Anthony John King Mussio, the first bishop of the Diocese of Steubenville. In 1974, Michael Scanlan became president and began a series of major reforms to restore the school to its Catholic heritage. The college changed its name to the University of Steubenville upon achieving university status in 1980 and adopted the current title Franciscan University of Steubenville in 1986.

==History==
In 1946, the first Bishop of Steubenville, Anthony John King Mussio, invited the Franciscan Friars of the Third Order Regular to establish a Catholic college in the diocese to serve local students and especially World War II veterans. In June 1946, the friars accepted the offer, purchased the Knights of Pythias Building in downtown Steubenville, and invested $350,000 in establishing the College of Steubenville. Enrollment grew, and more buildings were purchased, but the college was still cramped. The friars bought a 40-acre property overlooking the city, and accreditation was provided by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools in 1960.

The College of Steubenville was successful during the early years, under the tenures of presidents Daniel W. Egan, Kevin R. Keelan, and Columba J. Devlin. By the end of Keelan&#x27;s second term in 1974, the school was suffering from social upheaval and declining enrollment. For some time, it looked like the college would close. Michael Scanlan was chosen to fill the position of president. Incorporating knowledge from his experience in starting a charismatic renewal movement at St. Francis Seminary, Scanlan worked to institute a similar renewal at Steubenville. He took over the Sunday liturgy on the campus, incorporating charismatic praise and worship and more passionate preaching into the Mass. He instituted households, small groups of men and women devoted to personal and communal growth, and required students to join one. Scanlan also created a renewal center on the campus, which organized retreats and seminars to further instruct students in the Roman Catholic faith. The center began holding religious conferences in the summers, one benefit of which was attracting many young people to the college. Scanlan often spoke at these conferences.

Even with these changes, the college struggled to stay open. The first year after Scanlan instituted the changes, the incoming freshman class was the smallest in the college&#x27;s history. Five of the top administrators at the college left or were dismissed, and the remaining faculty expressed discontentment with Scanlan&#x27;s leadership. Despite this, Scanlan continued to make changes, especially to the curriculum. Scanlan reintroduced a theology program, which quickly became the top major at the college, and also oversaw the development of graduate programs in business and theology, which helped the college obtain the title of university in 1980. In addition, the nursing program rose to higher distinction. It was chartered by the state government of Ohio in 1984 and then received accreditation from the National League of Nursing in 1985.

Scanlan orchestrated many other changes at the university. He instituted an Oath of Fidelity to the Magisterium, which was required of the theology professors at the university. Under his guidance, the undergraduate theology program became the largest of any Catholic university in America. He also created the Human Life Studies minor, the only one of its kind in America. By 2000, Scanlan&#x27;s leadership and changes had helped the university to increase dramatically in size; there were more than 2,100 students, nearly double the number in the early 1970s.

The university was granted an exemption from Title IX in 2014 that allows it to legally discriminate against LGBT students.

In 2022, David Morrier, a Franciscan friar who served as a campus minister until his removal in 2014, was sentenced to probation after being pleading guilty to sexual battery of a student whom he had been counseling, which took place over three years, from 2010 to 2013.

==Campus==
The academic buildings on campus include Christ the Teacher Hall, Egan Hall, Stafford Hall (attached to Egan Hall), Saints Cosmas and Damian Hall, and the Saint Joseph Center. Some Engineering classes (that have not been relocated to Christ the Teacher) are held in Saint Junipero Serra Hall, which also serves as a residence hall.

Christ the Teacher Hall is the newest and largest academic hall. It houses engineering on the ground floor which include engineering labs. Business on the first floor, and Nursing on the second floor with a state of the art nursing simulation lab. A chapel and conference center are also located on the first floor, and admissions, Registrar’s office, and Financial Aid are located on the ground floor.

Egan Hall houses classrooms, a theater, television and radio studios, special laboratories for the education and psychology departments, and computer workstations on each floor.

In the newly remodeled Stafford Hall, there are classrooms, and offices, on the first floor, and faculty offices on the second floor.

Saints Cosmas and Damian Hall, the main science building, houses biology and chemistry laboratories, classrooms, the campus&#x27; largest lecture hall, and two computer science labs equipped with advanced software for programming.

The Saint Joseph Center houses some administrative offices as well as The Sacred Music Program, Social Work, and Criminal Justice.

Starvaggi Hall is the main administrative building on campus housing many departments including Information Technology, and Career Services.

The St. John Paul II Library&#x27;s collection includes more than 230,000 books and bound periodicals, and more than 390 current periodicals. The OPAL Catalog and OhioLINK Network provide access to many research databases and more than 7 million books and journals.

There are 16 residence halls on campus: Solanus Casey Hall, Saint Francis Hall, Trinity Hall, Marian Hall, Saint Thomas More Hall, Saint Louis Hall, Saint Elizabeth Hall, Kolbe Hall, Clare Hall, Padua Hall, Saint Bonaventure Hall, Vianney Hall, Saint Junipero Serra Hall (which also houses some engineering classes), Scotus Hall, and Saint Agnes Hall. Assisi Heights, a small neighborhood of apartments, is also available for upperclassman and graduate student housing.

Franciscan University of Steubenville has two soccer fields, a rugby field, a baseball field, and a field designated primarily for intramural sports. In 2007, the university purchased the golf course which borders the main campus from the city of Steubenville for future development. It is currently used by the cross country team for practice.

Christ the King Chapel is the center of the spiritual life of the campus. There are four Masses every weekday while classes are in session, five Masses on Sundays, vespers on Sunday evening, praise &amp; worship every Tuesday, and confessions held at least four times per week. Weekday Masses are routinely standing room only, while Sunday Masses during the school year require extra chairs to be arranged in the foyer and the Marian chapel. Currently the Chapel is under expansion and renovation and will reopen in Fall 2025. Weekday Masses are currently held in the Gentile Gallery in the J.C. Williams center and Weekend Masses are held in The Christ the Teacher Event Center.

The Portiuncula chapel, a replica of St. Francis&#x27; original chapel, sits on the edge of the main campus. It is home to perpetual adoration (at least two students volunteer to be present and adore the Blessed Sacrament during every hour of the week throughout the fall and spring semesters). Outside of this chapel are the Tomb of the Unborn Child, which contains the remains of seven aborted fetuses, a Creche, Stations of the Cross, and Marian Grotto. In 2009 the Vatican designated the Portiuncula as a place of pilgrimage where the faithful can obtain a plenary indulgence on five certain days through the year and under certain conditions of prayer and a detachment from sin.

The J.C. Willams Center is the student center, which houses the Tom and Nina Gentile Gallery containing numerous works of art donated to the university, the University Bookstore, and a coffee shop.

The Finnegan Fieldhouse is home to a basketball court, two racquetball courts, a weight room, one room for aerobic classes, a cardiovascular room, and the campus health and counseling center, as well as classrooms.

At the far north end of campus is the Steel Cross. This cross, made of two steel I-beams, is 35 feet tall and visible from afar.

==Academics==

The university offers 41 majors (seven pre-professional programs), 34 minors, 10 special minor programs (not available as majors), and seven graduate degree programs. The university maintains a 14:1 student-faculty ratio. Undergraduate students need a minimum of 124 credits for graduation. The number of electives varies with each major program. The university operates on the semester system. Three summer sessions also are available.

There is also an honors program in the Great Books of Western Civilization. The Honors Program open to qualified undergraduate students of any major.

The Priestly Discernment Program offers human, academic, spiritual, pastoral and fraternal formation for men considering the Catholic priesthood.

===Austria study abroad program===
Since 1991, up to 180 students per semester study at the university&#x27;s program in Gaming, Austria. The campus is located in a renovated fourteenth-century Carthusian monastery, known as the Gaming Charterhouse, in the foothills of the Austrian Alps. The old monastery serves as a hotel during summer months.

The Austrian Program features a four-day class schedule, Monday through Thursday, so students may spend extended time visiting religious, cultural, and historical sites throughout Europe. The program sponsors trips throughout Europe.

In 2011 Franciscan University launched a summer mini program in Austria. The session lasted from May 21 to June 30, 2011.

===Partnerships===
In 2014, Franciscan University introduced a dual-degree undergraduate engineering program, partnering with the University of Notre Dame, Gannon University and University of Dayton to offer an array of different engineering disciplines. Through the dual-degree program, students matriculate into Franciscan&#x27;s quantitative and liberal arts curriculum for the first two years of undergraduate study and are able to directly transfer into engineering programs at any of the partner schools for an additional two to three years. Upon culmination of the program, the student will obtain a Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Arts from Franciscan University (contingent on the program and credits elected) and a Bachelor in Science from one of the partner schools.

Franciscan University also offers a &quot;2+2&quot; program in which students can earn an Associate of Science degree in Natural and Applied Science from Franciscan before transferring to another school to complete a Bachelor of Science in engineering.

In 2016, Franciscan University announced an agreement with D&#x27;Youville College which created a 3+4 dual degree program between the two schools. Under the current arrangement, undergraduate students may enroll at Franciscan to begin studies in chemistry or biology and, after three years, may transfer directly into a four-year Doctor of Pharmacy program at D&#x27;Youville College&#x27;s School of Pharmacy. Upon completion of the seven-year program, the graduate receives a Bachelor of Science degree from Franciscan and a Doctor of Pharmacy degree from D&#x27;Youville.

In 2017, the university entered into a similar articulation agreement with Duquesne University, which grants Franciscan University students preferred admission in the Mylan School of Pharmacy upon completion of an Associate of Arts degree.

The university maintains a partnership with a number of Catholic law schools which allows undergraduate students to complete three years of undergraduate study in Steubenville, then, pending LSAT scores and other admissions criteria, matriculate directly into a three-year Juris Doctor program at either the Catholic University of America School of Law, University of St. Thomas School of Law, Ave Maria School of Law, or the Duquesne University School of Law.

In conjunction with the School of Canon Law at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., Franciscan University offers a course of study that fulfills the requirements for the First Cycle of studies in Canon Law. Graduates of Franciscan University who complete this course of study are allowed to proceed directly to the Licentiate in Canon Law program at the Catholic University of America.

===Reputation and rankings===
In the 2025 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; college rankings, Franciscan University of Steubenville was ranked 28th out of 165 regional universities in the Midwest.

In 2013, Young America&#x27;s Foundation rated Franciscan as one of the top 10 conservative colleges in the nation, three years after the Cardinal Newman Society ranked it as one of the 21 top Catholic colleges and universities in &quot;The Newman Guide to Choosing a Catholic College&quot;.

===Academic treatment of homosexuality===
In 2012 the Social Work curriculum included a course called SWK Deviant Behavior 314, which examined behaviors such as: murder, rape, robbery, prostitution, homosexuality, mental illness and drug use. Noting that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) had removed homosexuality as an illness, two Franciscan graduates tried to get the course description changed. In a written statement to NPR, the school said, &quot;Franciscan University follows Catholic Church teaching in regard to homosexuality and treats homosexual persons with &#x27;respect, compassion, and sensitivity&#x27; ... while holding homosexual acts as &#x27;intrinsically disordered.&#x27; &quot; In an interview with Inside Higher Ed, university vice president Daniel Kempton stated, &quot;that principles of academic freedom apply to the course and that the view that homosexuality is deviant is a legitimate perspective for the course.&quot;

==Student life==
Originally, campus life consisted of fraternities and sororities starting at Franciscans&#x27; founding in 1946. Under the leadership of Father Michael Scanlan, households (small groups of men and women devoted to personal and communal growth) were instituted and a once blossoming Greek life began to wilt, ending in 2016 when the final chapters, Theta Phi Alpha and Alpha Phi Delta were excluded from campus life. Though not recognized by the school, Alpha Phi Delta a nationally recognized fraternity, has remained active (as of 2019).

Instead, students are encouraged to join in faith households, groups of three or more students of the same sex, whose members study, recreate, and pray with one another. These student groups are attached to a particular residence hall on campus with a meeting space or common room within the hall where they hold their commitments or spend time together in community. Household members can apply to live “on wing” (the part of the residence hall where the common room is located) during housing periods. These households are centered around particular devotions or charismatic gifts. As of March 2015, there were 24 men&#x27;s households and 26 women&#x27;s households. In 2024, Franciscan University celebrated 50 years of household life on campus.

The campus is known for its liturgies, retreats, and spiritual talks. Most students make a weekly commitment to Eucharistic adoration in the Portiuncula chapel, and Masses are well-attended. Masses have standing room only, even on weekdays.

There is a 28-member student government.

The university sponsors 20 sports, nine for men and eleven for women. The athletics teams, nicknamed the Barons, compete in NCAA Division III as members of the Presidents&#x27; Athletic Conference (PAC) after completing a transition from the Allegheny Mountain Collegiate Conference in July 2020. The Barons started their PAC transition by joining for men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse in 2018–19. For 2019–20, Franciscan added women&#x27;s golf, plus indoor and outdoor track &amp; field for both men and women, to its PAC membership. Finally, the school became a full PAC member in 2020–21.

The mascot of the university&#x27;s sports teams is &quot;Baron von Steuben&quot;, modeled after Prussian military officer Baron Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben.

The men&#x27;s rugby team is a member of the National Collegiate Rugby and competes in the Allegheny Rugby Union Conference. In 2001 Franciscan became the second college in the nation, of any division, to have a varsity rugby club. In July 2011, Franciscan signed a three-year sponsorship agreement with Adidas.

<text>A zip-line, zip line, zip-wire, flying fox, or death slide is a pulley suspended on a cable, usually made of stainless steel, mounted on a slope. It is designed to enable cargo or a person propelled by gravity to travel from the top to the bottom of the inclined cable by holding on to, or being attached to, the freely moving pulley. It has been described as essentially a Tyrolean traverse that engages gravity to assist its speed of movement. Its use is not confined to adventure sport, recreation, or tourism, although modern-day usage tends to favor those meanings.

==History==
Ropeways or aerial cables have been used as a method of transport in some mountainous countries for more than 2,000 years, possibly starting in China, India and Japan as early as 250 BC, remaining in use in some remote areas in China such as Nujiang (Salween) valley in Yunnan as late as 2015 before being replaced by bridges. Not all of these structures were assisted by gravity, so not all fitted the definition of the zip-line.

Various technological advances in Europe in the Middle Ages improved the power-line&#x27;s ropeways, some of which were still assisted by gravity.

The first recorded use of the zip-line as a form of entertainment was possibly in 1739, when Robert Cadman, a steeplejack and rope slider, died when descending from Shrewsbury&#x27;s St Mary&#x27;s Church when his rope snapped. In literature, one appears in H. G. Wells&#x27;s 1897 novel &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; as part of a Whit Monday fair: &quot;On the village green an inclined string, down which, clinging the while to a pulley-swung handle, one could be hurled violently against a sack at the other end, came in for considerable favour among the adolescent...&quot;

Some sources attribute the development of zip-lines used today as a vacation activity to the Tyrolean traverses developed for mountaineering purposes.

In the Australian outback, zip-lines were sometimes used for delivering necessities to people working in or on the other side of a valley, and they may have been used in conflicts by Australian troops to deliver food, mail and even ammunition to forward positions.

==Current uses==
===As a means of transport===
Yungas, Bolivia, features a system of zip-lines used for transporting harvested crops, mainly coca, across a valley 200 m below. They can also be seen in the Ladakh region of India.

In recent years, there has been renewed interest in the use of aerial ropeways for transporting cargo, partly due to their low energy requirements and environmental impact. Gravity-fed types, i.e. zip-lines, have been built in Nepal, Latin America and India.

Ziplines have also been used as a means of transporting items in Australian regions in the past. These may include ammunition, weapons, tools, food, and mail.

===Recreation===
====Children&#x27;s adventure playgrounds====
Zip-lines may be designed for children&#x27;s play and found on some adventure playgrounds. Inclines are fairly shallow and so the speeds kept relatively low, negating the need for a means of stopping. The term &quot;flying fox&quot; is commonly used in reference to such a small-scale zip-line in Australia, New Zealand, and Scotland.
With playground equipment, the pulleys are fixed to the cable, the user typically hanging onto a handgrip underneath, but occasionally including a seat or a safety strap. Return of the grip or seat is usually done by simply pushing or pulling it via a short wire back to the top of the hill on foot.

====Canopy tours and adventure zip-lining====
Longer and higher rides are often used as a means of accessing remote areas, such as a rainforest canopy. In the 1970s, wildlife biologists set up zip-lines as a way to study and explore the dense rainforests of Costa Rica without disturbing the environment. The business idea for zip-line canopy tours developed from these. Darren Hreniuk, a Canadian citizen who moved to Costa Rica in 1992, around the same time that a scene in the film &quot;Medicine Man&quot; incorporated the treetop rides, with the goal of using canopy tours to help raise awareness for reforestation, education and socio-economic development in the surrounding areas. In October 1998, the Costa Rican Patent Office granted patent No. 2532 for an &quot;Elevated Forest Transport System Propelled by Gravity, Using Harness and Pulley Through a Simple Horizontal Line&quot; to Hreniuk. The patent was later annulled, bringing uncertainty to zip-line businesses, before being reinstated after twenty years.

A canopy tour (sometimes called a zip-line tour) provides a route through a wooded, and often mountainous, landscape, making primary use of zip-lines and aerial bridges between platforms built in trees. Tourists are harnessed to a cable for safety, and many are restricted to adults. Heights vary from near to the ground to near the treetops. Canopy tours are largely marketed under the banner of ecotourism, although the environmental impact of any type of zip-line is a disputed topic.

The terminology varies (canopy tour, zip-lining, flying fox), and the distinction between using zip-lines for ecotourism and zip-lining as an adventure sport is often not clear.
Zip-line tours are now popular vacation activities, found both at upscale resorts and at outdoor adventure camps, where they may be an element on a larger challenge such as a hike or ropes course.

==Operation==
===Mechanism===
A type of pulley with a grooved wheel known as a sheave is used in zip-lines, and the pulley turns as it travels along, thus reducing friction and enabling greater speed than would otherwise be possible.

The zip-line trolley (&quot;zipliner&quot;) is the frame or assembly together with the pulley inside that run along the cable. Zip-lines also have some kind of device to allow the cargo or rider to attach to the pulley system. This could include a harness, seat, a cabin or often just a handhold in smaller playground applications, that attaches to the pulley by a pivoting link or carabiner which secures the load, allowing the person or cargo to travel down the line.

====Braking====
To be propelled by gravity, the cable needs to be on a fairly steep slope. Even then, the rider or cargo will often not travel completely to the end (although this will depend on the load), and some means of safely stopping the car at the bottom end is usually needed with the larger zip-lines. Users of zip-lines must have some means of stopping themselves. Typical mechanisms include:

*Friction created between the pulley against the cable.
*Thick, purpose-built leather gloves.
*A mat or netting at the lower end of the incline.
*A passive arrester system composed of springs, pulleys, counterweights, bungee cord, tire or other devices, which slows and then stops the trolley&#x27;s motion.
*A &quot;capture block&quot; which is a block on the cable tethered to a rope controlled by a person who can manually apply friction on the rope to slow the user down. 
*Gravity stop, exploiting the sag in the cable, where the belly of the cable is always lower than the termination point. The amount of net incline in a zip-line system affects the speed at which the user arrives at the termination point.
*Hand brake at the end of the zip-line.

===Safety===
There are certain precautions that can be taken. Riders are physically attached to the cable by a harness which attaches to a removable trolley. A helmet is required on almost all courses of any size. All zip-line cables have some degree of sag, so the proper tensioning of a cable is important and allows tuning the ride of a zip-line.

==Records==

===Longest===
The world&#x27;s longest zip-line that opened on 28 September 2024 is the K3 of the SA Forest Adventures in Caledon, South Africa. It is a single cable of 3.2 km reaching speeds up to 120km/h. 

From 31 January 2018 it was the &quot;Jebel Jais Flight&quot; from one of the peaks of the Jebel Jais mountain in Ras Al Khaimah, United Arab Emirates, with a single unbroken span of . The ride was temporarily closed pending the outcome into an investigation into the crash of an Agusta 139 rescue helicopter on 29 December 2018, killing all on board. It is believed to have clipped one of the cables. The ride has since re-opened.

The &quot;Parque de Aventura Barrancas del Cobre&quot; at in Copper Canyon, Mexico, is the second-longest span, with &quot;El Monstruo&quot; at Orocovis in Puerto Rico coming in third, at .

The Skywire at Bluewater in Kent is the longest in England at . The longest zip-line in Europe, at , is the Sternsauser in Hoch-Ybrig, Switzerland.

The Zip World Bethesda line in Penrhyn Quarry, Bethesda, Wales holds the world record for attaining the fastest zip-line travel speed.

===Steepest===
Zip-lines with the steepest inclines include:
*Saint Martin&#x27;s Rockland Estate Rainforest Adventures zip-line (opened 24 November 2017), dropping across the of cable.
*The Letalnica bratov Gorišek zip-line, on the ski jumping hill in Planica, Slovenia (opened 19 September 2015). It is long with a vertical drop. It has an average 38.33% and a maximum 58.6% incline.
*ZipFlyer in Nepal (run by HighGround Adventures2012), with a maximum incline of 56%, claims to be the world&#x27;s steepest zip-line. It has a vertical drop of .

===Oldest person to ride a zip-line===
*On his 106th birthday, British great-grandfather Jack Reynolds became the oldest person to ride a zip-line, on 6April 2018, at Go Ape in Grizedale Forest, Cumbria.

===Highest elevation zipline===
The La Tyrolienne in Val Thorens, France is the highest altitude zipline, at 10,600 feet.

<doc id="665554" wikidata="Q7280272" url="?curid=665554" title="Radial keratotomy">
<text>Radial keratotomy (RK) is a refractive surgical procedure to correct myopia (nearsightedness). It was developed in 1974 by Svyatoslav Fyodorov, a Russian ophthalmologist. It has been largely supplanted by newer, more accurate operations, such as photorefractive keratectomy, LASIK, Epi-LASIK and the phakic intraocular lens.

==Procedure==
When performing RK, incisions are made with a diamond knife. The incisions relax the steep central cornea in patients with myopia in order to achieve a decreased need for correction. The original technique – consisting of incisions from periphery to center – was called the &quot;Russian technique&quot;, while the later advances of performing controlled incision from center to periphery was called the &quot;American technique&quot;.

RK may be performed with different types, numbers, and patterns of incisions. Typically, between 4 and 24 radial incisions are made in a number of patterns and orientations based on refractive errors, surgeon style and surgeon training. RK with 8 incisions is most common.

Incisions that penetrate only the superficial corneal stroma are less effective than those reaching deep into the cornea, and consequently, incisions are made quite deep. One study cites incisions made to a depth equivalent to the thinnest of four corneal-thickness measurements made near the center of the cornea. Other sources cite surgeries leaving 20 to 50 micrometres of corneal tissue unincised (roughly equivalent to 90% of corneal depth, based on thickness norms).

==Results==
The procedure results in a decrease in nearsightedness. According to the PERK study, 58% of eyes were corrected within 1.00D of goal 3 years after surgery. Additionally, 76% of eyes had uncorrected vision of 20/40 or better at 3 years. From 2 to 10 years post-operatively 43% of eyes had an increase in farsightedness by 1.00D or more. Despite this, 70% of patients reported not requiring corrective lenses for distance vision 10 years after surgery.

==Postsurgical healing==

The healing corneal wounds consist of newly abutting corneal stroma, fibroblastic cells, and irregular fibrous connective tissue. Closer to the wound surface lies the epithelial plug, a bed of the cells that form the normal corneal epithelium which have fallen into the wound. Often this plug is three to four times as deep as the normal corneal epithelium layer. As the cells migrate from the depth of the plug up to the surface, some die before reaching it, forming breaches in the otherwise healthy epithelial layer. This, consequently, leaves the cornea more susceptible to infections. The risk is estimated to be between 0.25% and 0.7% Healing of the RK incisions is very slow and unpredictable, often incomplete even years after surgery. Similarly, infection of these chronic wounds can also occur years after surgery, with 53% of ocular infections being late in onset.

==Complications==

* Visual phenomenon: Large epithelial plugs may cause more scattering of light, leading to the appearance of visual phenomena such as flares and starbursts – especially in situations such as night driving, where the stark light of car headlights abounds. These dark conditions cause the pupil to dilate, maximizing the amount of scattered light that enters the eye. In cases where large epithelial plugs lead to such aggravating symptoms, patients may seek further surgical treatment to alleviate the symptoms.
* Progressive hyperopia (farsightedness): RK enjoyed great popularity during the 1980s, and was one of the most studied refractive surgical procedures. Its 10-year data was published as the PERK (Prospective Evaluation of Radial Keratotomy) study, which proved the onset of progressive hyperopia – often found a decade after the original surgery – is due to continued flattening of the central cornea.
* Infectious keratitis: There is a risk of corneal infection after RK. Approximately half of infections occur within 2 weeks of surgery, but delayed infection do occur up to a year after surgery. Staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly identified bacteria for rapid onset and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common identified bacteria for delayed onset.
* Refractive changes at high altitude: Changes in refractive power of post RK corneas at high altitude has been well documented. There is a significant increase in the cycloplegic refraction as well as corneal thickness measurements in RK corneas exposed to high altitude. This was famously experienced by mountaineer Beck Weathers (who had undergone RK) during the 1996 Mount Everest disaster.
* Diurnal fluctuation: in a majority of patients who have undergone RK the cornea will steepen throughout the day. This can lead to variation in visual quality throughout the day.

==Visual rehabilitation and cataract surgery after RK==
The PERK study demonstrated that people who undergo RK continue to drift toward hyperopia (&quot;farsightedness&quot;). Additionally, many of these people have reached the age where presbyopia occurs. Some also develop cataracts. Their vision can still be restored with Epi-LASIK, photorefractive keratectomy, LASIK or phakic lens extraction, or cataract surgery. The corneal curvature has to remeasured and modified by history, central keratometry, or contact lens method.

Selecting intraocular lenses for cataract surgery in patients who have undergone any refractive surgery has proven challenging and is associated with decreased accuracy in lens selection. RK is associated with increased inaccuracy compared to other refractive procedures such as LASIK and PRK. This is due to difficulty measuring the corneal curvature of post-RK corneas as well as difficulty identifying an effective lens position using standard lens calculations. Additional methods have been introduced to improve the accuracy of IOL calculations.

Multifocal IOL insertion in eyes that have undergone RK have not been associated with good outcomes and are generally not recommended.

==History==
Beginning in 1936, Japanese ophthalmologist Tsutomu Sato conducted research in anterior and posterior keratotomy, an early form of refractive surgery that attempted to treat keratoconus, myopia and astigmatism by making incisions in the cornea. Enhanced flattening was noted with longer and deeper incisions. At first successful, Sato&#x27;s technique resulted in bullous keratopathy in up to 70% of patients related to endothelial damage.

In 1974, Svyatoslav Fyodorov removed glass from the eye of a boy who had been in an accident. The boy, who required eyeglasses for correction of myopia caused by astigmatism, fell off his bicycle. His glasses shattered on impact, and glass particles lodged in both eyes. To save the boy&#x27;s vision, Fyodorov performed an operation which consisted of making numerous radial incisions extending from the pupil to the periphery of the cornea in a radial pattern like the spokes of a wheel. After the glass was removed by this method and the cornea healed, Fyodorov found that the boy&#x27;s visual acuity had improved significantly.

*Other parental applications under Section 8 of the Children Act 1989, such as a Prohibited Steps Order or a Specific Issue Order
*Adoption cases
*Children who are subject to a social services application for a care and/ or supervision order.
Cafcass&#x27; function is set out in Section 12(1) Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 which states:

==History==
The provisions of court welfare services were the subject of two reviews. The Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR) and a subsequent review conducted jointly by the Home Office, the Lord Chancellor’s Department and the Department of Health concluded that a new integrated service subsuming these functions could improve service to the courts, better safeguard the interests of children, reduce wasteful overlaps and increase efficiency.

The services spanned England and Wales and included: Family Court Welfare (FCW) (54 areas); the Guardian ad litem and Reporting Officer (GALRO) Service (59 panels) and the children’s work of the Official Solicitor’s (OS) Department.

The Home Office stated:
The Home Office Prison-Probation review consultation paper did not mention family court welfare given that family court welfare was to move to a new unified family court welfare service.

The government then announced the setting-up of a unified family court welfare service. Among many key areas to be addressed were ensuring: Cafcass&#x27;s statutory basis; funding to cover start-up, transitional and ongoing costs; change management of the merger of 114 autonomous bodies into a single organisation; maintenance of current casework. These were addressed by a project team, drawn from the three relevant government departments and supplemented by consultants dealing with, for example, IT, payroll, estates and finance.

The Criminal Justice and Court Services Bill was led by the Home Office as most of the Bill’s provisions concerned the establishment of a National Probation Service for England and Wales. A few parts concerned Cafcass arrangements.

The Bill completed its parliamentary stages in autumn 2000. The Act’s Cafcass provisions were set to commence on 1 April 2001. The short timeline created problems that took Cafcass years to resolve.

Cafcass&#x27;s functions were to “(a) safeguard and promote the welfare of the children, (b) give advice to the court about any application made to it in such proceedings, (c) make provision for children to be represented in such proceedings, (d) provide information, advice and other support for the children and their families.” Subordinate legislation set out the duties of Cafcass practitioners.

In 2004 Cafcass published a policy and procedure concerning domestic violence.

In 2005/06 Cafcass produced the consultation document &quot;Every Day Matters&quot; that led to a draft set of National Standards. These standards set out what service users, partner agencies and practitioners in the family justice system could expect. The standards updated the 2003 Cafcass Service Standards and Principles, and after piloting in the North-East Region, were phased in from 1 April 2007. The standards noted the importance of service-user feedback and the active engagement and participation of children in their case planning process. Cafcass asserted the importance of including children&#x27;s views in the decision making processes involved in court proceedings. Young people could offer a &quot;Needs, Wishes and Feelings&quot; statement directly to the judge. However, Cafcass admitted that they do not conform to any National Standards.

The Children&#x27;s Rights Team spearheaded the formation of a Young People&#x27;s Board for Cafcass. This board consists of 12 young people with experience of Cafcass&#x27;s services. Since the board&#x27;s formation in August 2006 they helped to shape Cafcass policies and procedures.

In 2011 the Family Justice Review, in its final report, stated the following about the Young People’s Board:

‘&quot;We have been impressed by the valuable work undertaken by the Cafcass Young People’s Board. They provide an important perspective on the work of the family justice system and offer an intelligent and energetic challenge to the board of Cafcass. We believe that this work should be maintained through a Young People’s Board for the Family Justice Service, with a remit to consider issues in both public and private law and to report directly to the service.’&quot;

The Young People’s Board was expanded to cover the family justice system on a national scale and is now called The Family Justice Young People&#x27;s Board. The Family Justice Young People’s Board (FJYPB) is a group of over 40 children and young people aged between 8 and 25 years old who live across England. All members have either had direct experience of the family justice system or have an interest in children’s rights and the family courts. The FJYPB is a permanent sub-group of the national Family Justice Board (FJB) and is responsible to this board. Two members of the FJYPB regularly attend FJB meetings.

In 2012 Cafcass published its Operating Framework which sets out how Cafcass meets its responsibilities as a family court social work service to children and young people, to courts and to family members, as required by legislation.

===Wales===
As of 1 April 2005, responsibility for the functions of Cafcass in Wales, known as CAFCASS Cymru, became the responsibility of the National Assembly for Wales. Following the changes within Welsh Government in 2007, CAFCASS Cymru became part of the Department for Health and Social Services.

== Governance ==
On 1 April 2014, responsibility for Cafcass in England transferred from the Department for Education to the Ministry of Justice.

Edward Timpson CBE is the current Chair of the Cafcass Board, which includes eleven other members.. The Cafcass Board is made up of non-executive members appointed in accordance with the Membership, Committee and Procedure Regulations 2005. The Cafcass Board establishes the overall strategic aims and objectives for Cafcass consistent with the strategic policy objectives determined by the Secretary of State. It meets quarterly to monitor the performance of Cafcass and is accountable for Cafcass fulfilling its functions.

The work of the Board is supported by three main sub-committees chaired by Board members: 
* The Audit and Risk Assurance Committee (ARAC) which gives assurance to the effectiveness of the internal control and risk management systems.
* The Quality Committee which scrutinises the quality of safeguarding practice and casework.
* The Performance Committee which monitors national performance against KPIs and Cafcass’ impact on the whole family justice system key performance measures (KPMs).
There is also a Remuneration Committee which is convened as and when needed.

The Chief Executive and Accounting Officer for Cafcass is responsible and accountable to Parliament for the day-to-day operations, management and leadership of Cafcass and its handling of public funds administered to it. Jacky Tiotto became Chief Executive in autumn 2019. She was previously Director of Children’s Services at the London Borough of Bexley. The Chief Executive is supported by the Corporate Management Team. 

DNA scheme Regulations came into effect on 23 November 2015 with Cafcass and Cafcass Cymru funding a new DNA scheme under section 20 of the Family Law Reform Act 1969.

== Performance ==
During 2015–16, Cafcass worked with 116,104 children and young people across England. Cafcass is asked by family courts to become involved in public and private law cases as the independent voice of the child, advising the court on the issues children are facing, usually through recommendations they set out in reports to court. The primary aim is to reduce the risks to a child’s health and wellbeing and to promote their welfare and development. Cafcass has published a strategic plan for 2015–2020 ‘a stronger voice for the child’ which sets out its strategic priorities and its programmes to deliver these.

Cafcass is set Key Performance Indicator (KPI) targets by their sponsor department, the Ministry of Justice. The table below shows the KPI figures for 2015/16.

Public law: Between April 2015 and March 2016, Cafcass received 12,741 care applications. This figure is 14.2% (1,582 applications) higher than the same period the previous year and 20% (2,121 applications) higher when compared with the same period in 2013. On average Cafcass has received in excess of 1,000 new care applications per month during 2015–16.

Private law: Cafcass received a total of 37,649 private law cases between April and March. This figure is 10.3% higher (3,530 cases) than 2014–15. On average Cafcass received in excess of 3,100 new private law cases per month during 2015–16.

Ofsted has a duty to inspect Cafcass under section 143 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006 which requires the Chief Inspector of Education, Children’s Services and Skills to inspect the performance of Cafcass functions. The current Cafcass inspection framework replaced the previous tri- annual inspection of each of the 17 Cafcass service areas with one annual national inspection.
Cafcass had its first national Ofsted inspection in March 2014 and the overall judgement was ‘good’ with an ‘outstanding’ judgement for leadership and governance. Cafcass had its second national Ofsted inspection in March 2018 and Ofsted rated Cafcass as &#x27;outstanding&#x27;.

Cafcass publishes an annual report of its activities together with its audited accounts after the end of each financial year. Cafcass provides to the Ministry of Justice its finalised (audited) accounts in line with HM Treasury guidelines.

Cafcass is represented on the national Family Justice Board and chairs 10 out of 42 local Family Justice Boards.

==Criticism==
In 2008, an Ofsted inspection of Cafcass service users in South Yorkshire concluded that case records often did not show how Cafcass had come to its conclusions. In a post-inspection review in 2009, Ofsted found that in four of nine recommendations, progress was inadequate.

In 2009, Ofsted inspected Cafcass: Lancashire and Cumbria service area (including Blackburn with Darwen and Blackpool). They found Cafcass to be inadequate in equality, diversity, value for money, complaints handling, service responsiveness, performance management, self-evaluation, safeguarding children and improving outcomes for children. The report stated that:

&quot;the service area does not ensure that consistent consideration of the impact of family breakdown on outcomes for children is embedded in all aspects of case planning and reporting to court. The impact of ... the service in ensuring that all children are safe or feel safe is inadequate.&quot; 
In 2009/10 The Annual Report of Her Majesty&#x27;s Chief Inspector of Education, Children&#x27;s Services and Skills found that &quot;(Cafcass) is performing poorly, with four out of the five service areas inspected judged to be inadequate.&quot;

In November 2010 a parliamentary Commons Public Affairs Committee found that &quot;Cafcass as an organisation is not fit for purpose&quot; and that it did not make &quot;child-based decisions&quot;.

In 2011, presenters to a Justice Select Committee said that Cafcass was &quot;beyond reform&quot; and &quot;should be abolished&quot;.

A High Court judge said in 2014 that it appeared to be a practice &quot;widespread across the country&quot; that children were taken into foster care based on reports which family courts &quot;cut and pasted&quot; into their own rulings, without giving the parents the opportunity to view the reports or respond to them.

<doc id="665560" wikidata="Q35921" url="?curid=665560" title="Pound Scots">
<text>The pound (Modern and Middle Scots: &quot;Pund&quot;) was the currency of Scotland prior to the 1707 Treaty of Union between the Kingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England, which created the Kingdom of Great Britain. It was introduced by David I, in the 12th century, on the Carolingian monetary system of a pound divided into 20 shillings, each of 12 pence. The Scottish currency was later devalued relative to sterling by debasement of its coinage. By the time of James III, one pound Scots was valued at five shillings sterling.

Silver coins were issued denominated in merk, worth 13s.4d. Scots (two-thirds of a pound Scots). When James VI became King James I of England in 1603, the coinage was reformed to closely match sterling coin, with £12 Scots equal to £1 sterling. No gold coinage was issued from 1638 to 1700, but new silver coinage was issued from 1664 to 1707.

With the Acts of Union 1707, the pound Scots was replaced by sterling coin at the rate of 12:1 (£1 Scots = twenty pence sterling), although the pound Scots continued to be used in Scotland as a unit of account for most of the 18th century.

Today there is no distinct Scots currency; but Scotland&#x27;s three largest clearing banks (the Royal Bank of Scotland, the Bank of Scotland and the Clydesdale Bank) issue banknotes denominated in sterling. These notes may be accepted as payment throughout the United Kingdom, but are much more commonly seen in Scotland; their value is backed by non-circulating large denomination notes issued by the Bank of England (the &quot;giants&quot; and &quot;titans&quot;).

==List of coins of the pound Scots==
* Pistole – Gold, 12 pounds Scots
* Dollar – Replacement for the ryal, 60 shillings Scots (James VI)
* Ryal – Gold, 1565
* Crown or Lion – Gold (James I)
* Half-crown, Demi-Lion or Demys – Gold (James I)
* Ducat or &quot;bonnet&quot; – 40 shillings, 1539 (James V)
* Mark or merk – Gold (giving rise to the term markland)
* Noble – Gold, worth half a mark, 1357 (David II, reintroduced by Robert III)
* Unicorn – Gold, 18 shillings Scots, 1484–85 (James III)
* Half-unicorn – Gold, 9 shillings Scots (James IV)
* Testoun – silver, 1553. Was produced in France with the new process of mill and screw, being the first milled coinage of Scotland.
* Bawbee – Billon, six pence from 1537
* Shilling

<doc id="665569" wikidata="Q1261884" url="?curid=665569" title="Makua people">
<text>The Makua people, also known as Makhuwa or Wamakua, are a Bantu ethnic group found in northern Mozambique and the southern border provinces of Tanzania such as the Mtwara Region. They are the largest ethnic group in Mozambique, and primarily concentrated in a large region to the north of the Zambezi River.

They are studied by sociologists in four geographical and linguistic sub-divisions: the lower or Lolo Makua, the upper or Lomwe Makua, the Maua and the Niassa Makua or Medo. They speak variants of the &quot;Makua&quot; language, also called &quot;Emakua&quot;, and this is a Bantu-group language. The total Makua population is estimated to be about 3.5 million of which over 1 million speak the lower (southern) dialect and about 2 million the upper (northern, Lomwe) version; given the large region and population, several ethnic groups that share the region with the Makua people also speak the &quot;Emakua&quot;.

==History==

A mythical legend, in the oral tradition of the Makua people, tells that their ancestor were the first man and woman born of Namuli which is their original home, while other living creatures came from nearby mountains. Scholars are uncertain whether their origins are in the mountains, or west of Lake Malawi, or northern lands such as in Tanzania or the south. However they concur that they likely have been an established ethnic group in northern Mozambique region by the 1st millennium CE. The Makua people are closely related to the Animist Maravi people. They have had a history of conflict with the Muslim Yao people in the north involved in slave raids and slave trading.

===Metals, manufacturing and trade===
The Makua people have a documented history of metal ore processing and tools manufacturing. The colonial era Portuguese naturalist, Manuel Galvao da Silva for example, described iron mines of the Makua people. Similarly, the French explorer Eugene de Froberville summarized the indigenous Makua iron manufacturing methods from iron ore, where the Makua people extracted the metal by processing the ore in a wood-burning hearth as a community. The extracted metal was then worked into axes, knives, spear, rings and other items.
The Makua people have traditionally been dedicated to agriculture and hunting, yet medieval era documents suggest that the Makua people were also successful traders that controlled the trade routes between Lake Malawi and the Atlantic coast doing brisk business with the Swahili (East Africa) and Gujarati (India) merchants before the start of the colonial era. However, prior to the 18th-century, the Makua population was primarily exchanging food, ivory tusks and metal products for textiles, salt and other products, but they were not involved in the trade of ivory or gold. In the 18th century there was a dramatic increase in the ivory trade which required large scale killing of elephants.

===Colonialism and slavery===
The Portuguese who arrived in Mozambique in early 16th-century describe them for their trading relationships and expertise. The colonial settlers contacted the Makua people in early 16th century. The Makua people were generally peaceful with the colonial Portuguese in 17th century and throughout the mid 18th century. The Makua people encountered slave raids and capture from their northern neighbors, specifically the Yao people, an African ethnic group who targeted them to meet the slave demand of Swahili Arabs centered around Zanzibar. The Makua people retaliated with a war of attrition from 1749 onwards, against the Arabic Sultans of the African coast bordering the Indian Ocean, the Portuguese and the other African ethnic groups that supported colonial interests.

In early 18th-century, states historian Edward Alpers, the primary demand for slaves out of Makua people, and Mozambique in general, came not from Portugal or its Indian Ocean colonies such as Goa because labor was readily available in South Asia and Portuguese colonial empire in Asia was small. The largest demand came from the &#x27;Umani Arabs seeking slaves for domestic labor and the French who lacked plantation workers but controlled nearby island colonies such as Comoros, Réunion, Madagascar, Seychelles, Isle de France (now Mauritius) and others. With the growth of Portuguese interests in Brazil and of plantation owners from other colonial empires in the Caribbean, North and South America, the demand for slaves grew dramatically. The Makua people were one of the major victims of this demand, slave capture and export that attempted to satisfy this demand.

In the 19th century, the Makua chiefs joined the lucrative trading by becoming a supplier of slaves and raiding ethnic groups near them, selling the captured people to the same merchants and exporters. The exports of Makua people has led to this ethnic group&#x27;s presence in many islands of the Indian Ocean such as Madagascar, the Caribbean, the United States and elsewhere.

According to Palmer and Newitt, one of the strategies deployed by Africans and Arab slave raiders and traders was to dehumanize the Makua and Lomwe communities, by publicly stereotyping them as &quot;barbarous and savage tribes&quot;, which made slave buyers between 1800 and 1880 feel justified and righteous in &quot;exploiting, civilizing&quot; them from their barbarous ways. In truth, state modern era scholars, the historical evidence and economic success of Makua people suggest that they were peaceful and industrious.

==Religion==
In the traditional religion of the Makua people, the principal deity is named Muluku; he is opposed by an evil spirit named Minepa. According to legend, Muluku created the first man and the first woman from two holes in the ground, and gave them the art of using tools. The humans were disobedient, so Muluku summoned two monkeys and gave them the same tools and instruction. Seeing that the monkeys made good use of the tools, Muluku cut off their tails and fastened them to the man and the woman, telling the monkeys to be human and the humans to be monkeys.

The Makua people have predominantly held on to this traditional religion (66 to 70%), which reveres ancestors and nature spirits. The exception is the coastal population, where the Makua traders (under the influence of their Swahili-Arab customers) converted to the Shafi&#x27;i school of Sunni Islam. According to 19th-century records made by the Portuguese, there was at that time hardly any Islamic presence among the Makua people beyond the coastal settlements.

The Makua people refer to the coastal Muslim people as the &quot;Maka&quot;, which may be derived from Mecca, or from the words &quot;salt&quot; or &quot;coast&quot;, both of which in the Makua language translate to &quot;Maka&quot;.

==The Makua Diaspora==
The Makua people were widely distributed around the world during the colonial era. One of the oft studied ethnography of Makua people was published in 1847 by Eugene de Froberville, after he interviewed and learnt the Makua traditions and culture from over three hundred Makua people in Mauritius plantations.

Makua people once lived in the country of South Africa in an area near Durban called Bluff. However, due to the Apartheid era Group Areas Act, they were forcibly removed from Bluff and settled in Bayview, Chatsworth, Durban in 1960. Some Makua settled in Wentworth, Mariannhill, Mariannridge, Umlazi, Newlands East and West, Pietermaritzburg, Cape Town and Johannesburg.

The Makua language, a Bantu language, is still predominantly spoken among the people, alongside Afrikaans and Zulu (in South Africa), Portuguese in Mozambique, some Swahili by the elders of the community but still spoken by many on the Tanzania-Mozambican border, and English in South Africa and Tanzania.

<text>Maria Anna Schicklgruber (15 April 1795 – 6 January 1847) was the mother of Alois Hitler, and the paternal grandmother of Adolf Hitler.

==Family==
Maria was born in the village of Strones in the Waldviertel region of the Archduchy of Austria. She was the daughter of farmer Johannes Schicklgruber (29 May 1764 – 12 November 1847) and Theresia Pfeisinger (7 September 1769 – 11 November 1821). Maria was a Catholic; what is known about her is based on church and other public records.

Maria was one of eleven children, of whom only six survived infancy. Her early life was that of a poor peasant child in a rural and largely forested area in the northwest part of Lower Austria, northwest of Vienna.

In 1821, Maria&#x27;s mother died when Maria was 26 years old. She received an inheritance of 74.25 gulden, which she left invested in the Orphans&#x27; Fund until 1838. By that time it had more than doubled to 165 gulden. At that time, a breeding pig cost 4 gulden, a cow 10–12 gulden, and an entire inn perhaps 500 gulden. Werner Maser wrote she was a &quot;thrifty, reserved, and exceptionally shrewd peasant woman.&quot;

==The birth of Alois==

In 1837, when she was 42 years old and still unmarried, her only child, Alois, was born. Maser notes that she refused to reveal who the boy&#x27;s father was, so the priest baptized the baby Alois Schicklgruber and entered &quot;illegitimate&quot; in place of the father&#x27;s name on the baptismal register. Historians have discussed various candidates for the father of Alois:
*Johann Georg Hiedler, who later married Maria, whose name was added to the birth certificate later in Alois&#x27;s life, and who was accepted officially by Nazi Germany as Alois&#x27;s father (i.e., as the paternal grandfather of Adolf Hitler).
*Johann Nepomuk Hiedler, Johann Georg&#x27;s brother and Alois&#x27;s step-uncle, who raised Alois through adolescence and later willed him a considerable portion of his life savings, but who, if he were the real father of Alois, never found it expedient to admit it publicly.
*A Jewish man named Leopold Frankenberger, as reported by ex-Nazi Hans Frank during the Nuremberg Trials. Prominent historians dismiss the Frankenberger hypothesis (which had only Frank&#x27;s speculation as evidence) as baseless, as there were no Jewish families in Graz at the time Maria became pregnant.

At the time of the birth of Alois, Maria was living with a Strones village family by the name of Trummelschlager. Mr and Mrs Trummelschlager were listed as Alois&#x27;s godparents.

Maria soon began residence with her father at house number 22 in Strones. After an unknown period, the three Schicklgrubers were joined by Johann Georg Hiedler, an itinerant journeyman miller. On 10 May 1842, five years after Alois was born, Maria Anna Schicklgruber married Johann Georg Hiedler in the nearby village of Döllersheim. Maria was 47 years old, and her new husband was 50.

Whether or not Johann Georg Hiedler was actually the biological paternal grandfather of Hitler may remain unknown, as he was not recorded originally as the father on Alois&#x27;s birth certificate. Illegitimacy was common in lower Austria; in some areas, it reached as many as forty percent of births, and as late as 1903 the rate was twenty-four percent, with the children normally legitimized at a later date. Hitler&#x27;s ancestry was questioned when his opponents began spreading rumours that his paternal grandfather was Jewish, since one of Nazism&#x27;s major principles was that to be considered a pure &quot;Aryan&quot; one had to have a documented ancestry certificate (&quot;Ahnenpass&quot;).

In 1931, Hitler ordered the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) to investigate the alleged rumours regarding his ancestry; they found no evidence of any Jewish ancestors. He then ordered a genealogist by the name of Rudolf Koppensteiner to publish a large illustrated genealogical tree showing his ancestry. This was published in the book &quot;Die Ahnentafel des Führers&quot; (&quot;The pedigree of the Leader&quot;) in 1937, which concluded that Hitler&#x27;s family were all Austrian Germans with no Jewish ancestry and that Hitler had an unblemished &quot;Aryan&quot; pedigree. As Alois himself legitimized Johann Georg Hiedler as his biological father (with three witnesses affirming and watching this) and the priest changed the father&#x27;s blank space on the birth certificate in 1876, this was considered certified proof for Hitler&#x27;s ancestry, and thus Hitler &quot;was&quot; considered an &quot;Aryan&quot;.

==Death and gravesite==

Maria died during the sixth year of her marriage, at the age of 51 in Klein-Motten, where she was living with her husband in the home of kin, the Sillip family. She died of &quot;consumption resulting from pectoral (thoracic) dropsy&quot; in 1847. She was buried in the parish church cemetery in Döllersheim.

After the &quot;Anschluss&quot; of Austria in 1938, a search failed to find her grave, so she was given an &quot;honour grave&quot; next to the church wall. This grave was tended by local Hitler Youth groups whilst Döllersheim and the surrounding areas were made proving ground areas. In 1942, this area became part of an artillery training area, and the local inhabitants were moved out. Military training continued during the Soviet occupation after the war and also by the Austrian Army until about 1985, by which time most of the towns and villages were in ruins. The church at Döllersheim is now preserved and undergoing reconstruction. The cemetery is being tended, but there is no grave marker remaining for Maria Schicklgruber.

<doc id="665574" wikidata="Q7890774" url="?curid=665574" title="United States National Chemistry Olympiad">
<text>The United States National Chemistry Olympiad (or USNCO) is a contest held by the American Chemical Society (ACS) used to select the four-student team that represents the United States at the International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO).

Each local ACS section selects 10 students (or more for larger ACS sections) to take the USNCO National Exam. To qualify for the national exam, students must first take the local exam. Approximately 10,000 U.S. students sit for the local exam each year. More than 1000 students qualify to take the National Exam annually.

== Exam format ==

The National Exam consists of three parts.

=== Multiple choice ===

The first part contains 60 multiple-choice questions. Each question has four answer choices. The questions are loosely grouped into 10 sets of 6 items; each set corresponds to a different chemistry topic. Typically, the topics are, in order, descriptive chemistry/laboratory techniques, stoichiometry, gases/liquids/solids, thermodynamics, kinetics, equilibrium, electrochemistry, electronic structure/periodic trends, bonding theories, and organic chemistry. There is no penalty for guessing; a student&#x27;s score is equal to the number of questions answered correctly. One and a half hours (90 minutes) are allotted for this first part.

=== Free response ===

The second part contains 8 free response questions. Complete written explanations and calculations are required for full credit on a question, and partial credit is awarded. More thorough knowledge of basic theories is required, and often there are questions on less-emphasized portions of normal high school chemistry curricula, such as organic chemistry and coordination chemistry. One hour and 45 minutes (105 minutes) are allowed for this section. The topics of each question in the recent part II’s of USNCO usually follows the following format:

Q1: Stoichiometry

Q2: Equilibrium

Q3. Assorted (typically either thermodynamics, electrochemistry, or kinetics)

Q4. Assorted (typically either thermodynamics, electrochemistry, or kinetics)

Q5. Prediction of chemical reaction products. Includes acid-base reactions as well as redox reactions. Part F is usually on radioisotope decay. 

Q6. Assorted (could be any topic that is not anywhere else)

Q7. Bonding

Q8. Organic Chemistry

=== Lab practical ===

Beginning in 1994, the lab practical was added to the National Exam. It contains two tasks to be performed by each student with only the specified materials, and students are expected to describe their procedures and organize their findings. Past tasks have included chromatography, titration and qualitative analysis, and 90 minutes are allotted to complete the two experiments.

== USNCO Study Camp and other recognition ==

The top 20 scorers on the USNCO National Exam are invited to participate in the two-week USNCO Study Camp at the University of Maryland, College Park in College Park, Maryland. At the camp, the students are tested (both free response and lab testing), and the top four students are selected to comprise the U.S. IChO team. Two alternates are also selected, although no alternate has ever actually been called up for duty.

In addition, the top 50 students are recognized as achieving &quot;High Honors&quot; or &quot;t50&quot;, and the next 100 students earn the &quot;Honors&quot; or &quot;t150&quot; designation.

== Scope of the test as compared to the IChO ==

The purpose of the USNCO is to stimulate all young people to achieve excellence in chemistry. Therefore, the focus of the exam is not necessarily to select the top twenty students, and instead to present a wide selection of basic questions. Therefore, the scope of the USNCO is different than the scope of what would be expected at the training camp or IChO.

<doc id="665577" wikidata="Q312043" url="?curid=665577" title="Giovanni Lajolo">
<text>Giovanni Lajolo (born 3 January 1935) is an Italian cardinal and former president of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State and president of the Governatorate of Vatican City State.

==Early life and ordination==
Giovanni Lajolo was born on 3 January 1935 in Novara, Italy.
He studied at the Seminary of Novara, the Pontifical Roman Seminary, and the Pontifical Gregorian University where he earned a licentiate in philosophy in 1955 and a licentiate in theology in 1959. He was ordained a priest on 29 April 1960. He entered the University of Munich where he studied for a doctorate in canon law which he was awarded in 1965. Then in 1965 he entered the elite Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy to study diplomacy, leaving in 1968.

==Secretariat of State==
He entered the service of the Secretariat of State in 1970. He worked in the nunciature in Germany collaborating with Corrado Bafile, future cardinal, from 1970 to November 1974. He was a staff member of the Council for Public Affairs of the Church from November 1974. He was named counselor of nunciature on 1 January 1983. He closely followed the negotiations that led to the signing, in 1984, of the revision of the concordat between Italy and Holy See.

==Bishop==
On 3 October 1988, Lajolo was appointed Secretary of the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See and Titular Archbishop of Caesariana by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on 6 January 1989 from John Paul, with archbishops Edward Idris Cassidy and José Tomás Sánchez serving as co-consecrators, in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. Lajolo was named Nuncio to Germany on 7 December 1995, and Secretary for Relations with States on 7 October 2003. As Secretary, he served as the foreign minister of the Vatican.

==Secretary for Relations with States==
He served as the Secretary for Relations with States in the Secretariat of State, or foreign minister of the Holy See, from 2003 until his appointment as president in 2006. He speaks Italian, German, English and French.

At a 2004 conference Lajolo said that perfect religious freedom does not exist in any country in the world: &quot;Even in states in which the right to religious freedom is taken very seriously, perfection is missing, often because a concern for church-state separation leads to penalising religious activity in the public sphere.&quot; He went on to say that &quot;government and taxation policies may limit the rights of parents to choose a religious education for their children or may penalise the charitable work of the church by not recognising its nonprofit status. Attempts to ban religiously motivated positions from public policy debates are also infringements on religious freedom.&quot; Lajolo and other speakers at the conference also voiced concern about the increasing threats to Christians in Iraq and in other countries with a Muslim majority following the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.

In 2005 Lajolo was awarded Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic.

==Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State==
On 22 June 2006, Lajolo was appointed President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State and of the Governorate of Vatican City State by Pope Benedict XVI. In virtue of these two posts, he is delegated legislative and executive authority over the Vatican City by the pope. He was made Cardinal-Deacon of Santa Maria Liberatrice a Monte Testaccio in the consistory of 24 November 2007.

He submitted his resignation to Pope Benedict when he turned 75 in January 2010. His resignation was accepted on 3 September 2011, with Archbishop Giuseppe Bertello appointed as his successor as of 1 October 2011.

He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2013 papal conclave that elected Pope Francis.

==Curial work==
He was made a member of the Congregation for Bishops, Pontifical Council for Culture, and Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See (of which he had once been Secretary) on 12 June 2008. On 25 January 2010 he was appointed a member of the Apostolic Signatura, the Church&#x27;s highest court. He remained as a member of these bodies until his 80th birthday in 2015.

<doc id="665578" wikidata="Q1077823" url="?curid=665578" title="Somnolence">
<text>Somnolence (alternatively sleepiness or drowsiness) is a state of strong desire for sleep, or sleeping for unusually long periods (compare hypersomnia). It has distinct meanings and causes. It can refer to the usual state preceding falling asleep, the condition of being in a drowsy state due to circadian rhythm disorders, or a symptom of other health problems. It can be accompanied by lethargy, weakness and lack of mental agility.

Somnolence is often viewed as a symptom rather than a disorder by itself. However, the concept of somnolence recurring at certain times for certain reasons constitutes various disorders, such as excessive daytime sleepiness, shift work sleep disorder, and others; and there are medical codes for somnolence as viewed as a disorder.

Sleepiness can be dangerous when performing tasks that require constant concentration, such as driving a vehicle. When a person is sufficiently fatigued, microsleeps may be experienced. In individuals deprived of sleep, somnolence may spontaneously dissipate for short periods of time; this phenomenon is the second wind, and results from the normal cycling of the circadian rhythm interfering with the processes the body carries out to prepare itself to rest.

The word &quot;somnolence&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;somnus&quot; meaning &quot;sleep&quot;.

== Causes ==
=== Circadian rhythm disorders ===

Circadian rhythm (&quot;biological clock&quot;) disorders are a common cause of drowsiness as are a number of other conditions such as sleep apnea, insomnia and narcolepsy. The body clock disorders are classified as extrinsic (externally caused) or intrinsic. The former type is, for example, shift work sleep disorder, which affects people who work nights or rotating shifts. The intrinsic types include:
* Advanced sleep phase disorder (ASPD) – A condition in which patients feel very sleepy and go to bed early in the evening and wake up very early in the morning
* Delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD) – Faulty timing of sleep, peak period of alertness, the core body temperature rhythm, hormonal and other daily cycles such that they occur a number of hours late compared to the norm, often misdiagnosed as insomnia
* Non-24-hour sleep–wake disorder – A faulty body clock and sleep-wake cycle that usually is longer than (rarely shorter than) the normal 24-hour period causing complaints of insomnia and excessive sleepiness
* Irregular sleep–wake rhythm – Numerous naps throughout the 24-hour period, no main nighttime sleep episode and irregularity from day to day

=== Physical illness ===
Sleepiness can also be a response to infection. Such somnolence is one of several sickness behaviors or reactions to infection that some theorize evolved to promote recovery by conserving energy while the body fights the infection using fever and other means. Other causes include:
* Anxiety 
* Brain tumor
* Chronic pains
* Concussion – a mild traumatic brain injury 
* Diabetes
* Fibromyalgia
* Head injury
* Hypercalcemia – too much calcium in the blood
* Hypermagnesemia
* Hyponatremia – low blood sodium 
* Hypothyroidism – the body doesn&#x27;t produce enough hormones that control how cells use energy
* Meningitis
* Mood disorders – depression
* Multiple sclerosis 
* Narcolepsy – disorder of the nervous system
* Skull fractures
* Sleeping sickness – caused by a specific parasite
* Stress

=== Medicine ===
* Analgesics – mostly prescribed or illicit opiates such as OxyContin or heroin
* Anticonvulsants / antiepileptics – such as phenytoin (Dilantin), carbamazepine (Tegretol), Pregabalin (Lyrica) and Gabapentin (Neurontin)
* Antidepressants – for instance, sedating tricyclic antidepressants amitriptyline and mirtazapine. Somnolence is less common with SSRIs and SNRIs as well as MAOIs.
* Antihistamines – for instance, diphenhydramine (Benadryl, Nytol), doxylamine (Unisom-2), hydroxyzine (Atarax) and promethazine (Phenergan)
* Antipsychotics – for example, Lurasidone (Latuda), thioridazine, quetiapine (Seroquel), olanzapine (Zyprexa), risperidone and ziprasidone (Geodon) but not haloperidol
* Dopamine agonists used in the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease – e.g. pergolide, ropinirole and pramipexole.
* HIV medications – such as efavirenz
* Hypertension medications – such as amlodipine
* Hypnotics, or soporific drugs, commonly known as sleeping pills.
* Tranquilizers – such as zopiclone (Zimovane), or the benzodiazepines such as diazepam (Valium) or nitrazepam (Mogadon) and the barbiturates, such as amobarbital (Amytal) or secobarbital (Seconal)
* Other agents impacting the central nervous system in sufficient or toxic doses

== Assessment ==
Quantifying sleepiness requires a careful assessment. The diagnosis depends on two factors, namely chronicity and reversibility. Chronicity signifies that the patient, unlike healthy people, experiences persistent sleepiness which does not pass. Reversibility stands for the fact that, even if the individual goes to sleep, the sleepiness may not be completely gone after waking up. The problem with the assessment is that patients may only report the consequences of sleepiness: loss of energy, fatigue, weariness, difficulty remembering or concentrating, etc. It is crucial to aim for objective measures to quantify the sleepiness. A good measurement tool is the &quot;multiple sleep latency test&quot; (MSLT). It assesses the sleep onset latency during the course of one day—often from 8:00 to 16:00. An average sleep onset latency of less than 5 minutes is an indication of pathological sleepiness.

== Severity ==
A number of diagnostic tests, including the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, are available to help ascertain the seriousness and likely causes of abnormal somnolence.

<text>Gorno-Altaysk (, ; ; historically, pre-1932: Ulala) is the capital town of the Altai Republic, Russia.

The population stands at around 64,000 people as of 2020 with steady growth over the recent years. In the past, the town was known as &quot;Ulala&quot; (until June 23, 1932) and then &quot;Oyrot-Tura&quot; (June 23, 1932 - January 7, 1948).

==History==
The &quot;selo&quot; of Ulala () was established in 1824 when migrants moved to this area from Biysk. When Oirot Autonomous Oblast was established on June 1, 1922, Ulala became its administrative center. On February 27, 1928, Ulala was granted town status and on June 23, 1932, it was renamed Oyrot-Tura (). The present name was given to the town on January 7, 1948.

==Climate==
Gorno-Altaysk has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) characterised by frigid winters and warm to very warm summers. Precipitation is moderate and is much higher in the hotter summer months than in the frigid winter season, when it falls entirely as low-water-content snow.
==Administrative and municipal status==
Gorno-Altaysk is the capital of the republic. Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as Gorno-Altaysk Urban Okrug—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, this administrative unit also has urban okrug status.

==Transportation==
The town is served by the Gorno-Altaysk Airport, with regular flights to the city of Moscow and a few other major Russian cities.

Highway M52 passes through Gorno-Altaysk, connecting it with Novosibirsk in the north and the Mongolian border in the south.

The closest railway station is from Gorno-Altaysk. It is located in the city of Biysk.

==Culture, sports and education==
The town hosts a theater as well as several cinemas, the Gorno-Altaisk State University, and the Anokhin Museum. The mountains located within the town&#x27;s boundaries are a magnet for skiing as well as backpacking. Several football fields with artificial grass are available to the public for free.

== Infrastructure condition ==
Only the most vital streets in Gorno-Altaysk are kept in good condition as of 2020. The rivers are safe to swim in and the tap water is safe to drink. Most of the buildings have central heating, usually powered by a gas burning station serving either one or several buildings.

<doc id="665594" wikidata="Q420133" url="?curid=665594" title="Chlorphenamine">
<text>Chlorphenamine (CP, CPM), also known as chlorpheniramine, is an antihistamine used to treat the symptoms of allergic conditions such as allergic rhinitis (hay fever). It is taken orally (by mouth). The medication takes effect within two hours and lasts for about 4–6 hours. It is a first-generation antihistamine and works by blocking the histamine H1 receptor.

Common side effects include sleepiness, restlessness, and weakness. Other side effects may include dry mouth and wheeziness.

Chlorpheniramine was patented in 1948 and came into medical use in 1949. It is available as a generic medication and over the counter.

In 2022, it was the 291st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 400,000 prescriptions.

==Medical uses==

===Combination products===
Chlorphenamine is often combined with phenylpropanolamine to form an allergy medication with both antihistamine and decongestant properties, though phenylpropanolamine is no longer available in the US after studies showed it increased the risk of stroke in young women. Chlorphenamine remains available with no such risk.

In the drug Coricidin, chlorphenamine is combined with the cough suppressant dextromethorphan. In the drug Cêgripe, chlorphenamine is combined with the analgesic paracetamol.

==Side effects==
The adverse effects include drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, constipation, anxiety, nausea, blurred vision, restlessness, decreased coordination, dry mouth, shallow breathing, hallucinations, irritability, problems with memory or concentration, tinnitus and trouble urinating.

Chlorphenamine produces less sedation than other first-generation antihistamines.

A large study on people 65 years old or older linked the development of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and other forms of dementia to the &quot;higher cumulative&quot; use of chlorphenamine and other first-generation antihistamines, due to their anticholinergic properties. Chlorphenamine is rated as a &quot;high burden&quot; anticholinergic by experts on a semi-subjective scale. This is inconsistent with the &quot;in vitro&quot; experiments showing low affinity to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (see below).

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Chlorphenamine acts primarily as a potent H1 antihistamine. It is specifically a potent inverse agonist of the histamine H1 receptor. The drug is also commonly described as possessing weak anticholinergic activity by acting as an antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. The dextrorotatory stereoisomer, dexchlorpheniramine, has been reported to possess Kd values of 15 nM for the H1 receptor and 1,300 nM for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in human brain tissue. The smaller the Kd value, the greater the binding affinity of the ligand for its target.

In addition to acting as an inverse agonist at the H1 receptor, chlorphenamine has been found to act as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (Kd = 15.2 nM for the serotonin transporter). It has only weak affinity for the norepinephrine and dopamine transporters (Kd = 1,440 nM and 1,060 nM, respectively).

A study found that dexchlorphenamine had Ki values for the human cloned H1 receptor of 2.67 to 4.81 nM while levchlorphenamine had Ki values of 211 to 361 nM for this receptor, indicating that dexchlorphenamine is the active enantiomer. Another study found that dexchlorphenamine had a Ki value of 20 to 30 μM for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor using rat brain tissue while levchlorphenamine had a Ki value of 40 to 50 μM for this receptor, indicating that both enantiomers have very low affinity for it.

===Pharmacokinetics===
The elimination half-life of chlorphenamine has variously ranged between 13.9 and 43.4 hours in adults following a single dose in clinical studies.

==Chemistry==
Chlorphenamine is an alkylamine and is a part of a series of antihistamines including pheniramine (Naphcon) and its halogenated derivatives including fluorpheniramine, dexchlorphenamine (Polaramine), brompheniramine (Dimetapp), dexbrompheniramine (Drixoral), deschlorpheniramine, and iodopheniramine. The halogenated alkylamine antihistamines all exhibit optical isomerism, and chlorphenamine in the indicated products is racemic chlorphenamine maleate, whereas dexchlorphenamine is the dextrorotary stereoisomer.

===Synthesis===
There are several patented methods for the synthesis of chlorphenamine. In one example, 4-chlorophenylacetonitrile is reacted with 2-chloropyridine in the presence of sodium amide to form 4-chlorophenyl(2-pyridyl)acetonitrile. Alkylating this with 2-dimethylaminoethylchloride in the presence of sodium amide gives γ-(4-chlorphenyl)-γ-cyano-&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethyl-2-pyridinepropanamine, the hydrolysis and decarboxylation of which lead to chlorphenamine.

A second method boom starts from pyridine, which undergoes alkylation by 4-chlorophenylacetonitrile, giving 2-(4-chlorobenzyl)pyridine. Alkylating this with 2-dimethylaminoethylchloride in the presence of sodium amide gives chlorphenamine.

== Society and culture ==
=== Names ===
&quot;Chlorphenamine&quot; is the while &quot;chlorpheniramine&quot; is the and former .

Brand names include Chlor-Trimeton, Demazin, Allerest 12 Hour, Piriton, Chlorphen-12, Tylenol Cold/Allergy, and numerous others according to country.

<text>The Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary () abbreviated SS.CC., is a Catholic clerical religious congregation of Pontifical Right for priests and brothers. The congregation is also known as the Picpus because their first house was on the Rue de Picpus in Paris, France.

== History ==
===French Revolution beginnings===
The Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary arose amid the religious upheaval caused by the French Revolution. In March 1792, the Frenchman Pierre Coudrin was secretly ordained to the priesthood. The following May, Father Coudrin went into hiding in an attic of the granary of the Chateau d&#x27;Usseau and stayed confined there for six months to escape the government&#x27;s persecution of the Catholic non-juring priests who refused to accept the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. One evening during his time in hiding, Coudrin had a vision of himself surrounded by a heavenly illuminated group of priests, brothers and sisters dressed in white robes, which he took as his calling to establish a religious institute that would be the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary. Coudrin left the granary and began his underground ministry in Poitiers, waiting for the opportunity to start his group.

During his underground ministry in 1794, Coudrin met Henriette Aymer de Chevalerie. She had been imprisoned for hiding a priest. Upon her release, she told Coudrin of a vision she had while in prison calling her to the service of God. Coudrin and Henriette Aymer de Chevalerie shared with each other their visions of creating a religious institute in the midst of danger for Roman Catholics in France.

===Establishing the Congregation===
On Christmas Eve in 1800, despite knowing they could face the guillotine for their actions, Father Coudrin and Henriette Aymer de Chevalerie officially established the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary.

In 1817, the Congregation was formally approved by the Pope as a single institute composed of a male and a female branch of religious and a lay branch.

The original members of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary founded new schools for poor children, seminaries to help grow the priesthood of their institute and parish missions throughout Europe. In 1825 the evangelization of the Sandwich Islands in the Pacific was entrusted by the Holy See to the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts, and the following year the first band of missionaries of the Sacred Hearts left France. At the time of Father Coudrin&#x27;s death in 1837, the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary had 276 priests and brothers and 1125 sisters.

In 1840 the Brothers founded a house in Louvain, Belgium. The Brothers settled in Spain (1880), the Netherlands (1892), England (1894) and the United States (1905).

The sisters, who concentrated their energies on education, went to Chile in 1838 and to Perú in 1848. They also started foundations in Honolulu in 1859 and Ecuador in 1862. Additional houses were founded in Spain (1881), Belgium (1894), England (1895), the Netherlands (1803) and the United States (1908).

The Congregation has been present in Ireland since 1948 and in the UK since 1956.

===The Mission in the Pacific Islands===

The religious institute set off on a new mission that would become their hallmark accomplishment. Teams of missionaries settled in the several Pacific Ocean islands to spread the Gospel, build churches, and evangelize new faithful.

The Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary was particularly successful in the Kingdom of Hawaii. They established what is now the Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu and built the Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace, the oldest Roman Catholic cathedral in continuous use in the United States. Hawaii&#x27;s first six bishops, from 1833 to 1940, were members of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary. Other churches founded by the institute include Saint Joseph Catholic Church in Hilo and Maria Lanakila Catholic Church on Maui. Sacred Hearts Academy (K-12, girls) and St. Patrick&#x27;s School (elementary, co-ed) in the Honolulu neighborhood of Kaimuki were both founded by the order.

===Mission in the United States===
In 1833 Reverends Edmundo Demellier, S.S.C.C. and Petithomme, S.S.C.C. began to minister to the Passamaquoddy people in Maine. The Congregation&#x27;s first province in the United
States was established 1846. In 1850 they established the Santa Inés Mission (Chumash), in Solvang, California.

<doc id="665599" wikidata="Q972245" url="?curid=665599" title="European Telephony Numbering Space">
<text>With the intent of forming a trans-Europe numbering plan as an option (or then future movement) for anyone needing multi-national European telephone presence, the ITU allocated country calling code +388 as a subdivided, catch-all container for such services. This was designated the European Telephony Numbering Space or ETNS.

Although some ETNS numbers were assigned, few phone companies supported connecting calls to ETNS.

Because of limited support, ETNS was suspended in 2005 and abolished in 2008. All ETS numbers were cancelled by the beginning of 2010. The +388 code was scheduled to be reclaimed by the ITU at the end of 2010; as of late 2011 it was listed by ITU as &quot;Group of countries, shared code&quot;.

See also list of country calling codes.

==Allocation area==
Geographically the +388 &quot;country&quot; code was an overlay on top of all the pre-existing, state-bounded country codes of the countries in Europe. Among &quot;special&quot; country codes, +388 was unique in that it was both supranational yet geographically bounded (other special codes, such as +881 and freephone +800, are completely international).

Instead of being subdivided geographically as in a typical numbering plan, the ETNS was intended to be subdivided by type of service or customer. It would therefore not have been possible to reverse engineer the location of an owner of an ETNS number based on the characteristics of the phone number. The numbers were also not allocated in blocks to individual carrier companies and were therefore intended to be portable. Carriers needed to have ETNS translation capability, or routing agreement with a carrier that did, in order for its customers to successfully call ETNS numbers.

==Subdivision==
===Country Groups===
Specifically, ETNS was intended to be only one of a potentially larger set of European &quot;country groups&quot; participating in a shared regional overlay numbering plan. The only country group that comprised the ETNS was given an identification code of 3, which came after the +388 country code.

===Services===
After the country group identification code, the number space was divided according to service, indicated by a European Service Identity code. The table lists the service designations (country code, identification code, and ESI code) available under ETNS:

====European Service Identity codes====
*Public service application: 3883 1
*Customer service application: 3883 3
*Corporate networks: 3883 5
*Personal numbering: 3883 7

<doc id="665600" wikidata="Q259383" url="?curid=665600" title="Ecliptica">
<text>Ecliptica is the first full-length album by the power metal band Sonata Arctica. It was released in 1999 through Spinefarm Records in Europe and through Century Media in the United States. It is the band&#x27;s only album featuring bassist Janne Kivilahti. In 2016, vocalist, keyboardist and songwriter Tony Kakko described the album as &quot;like the extension of our demo, we didn&#x27;t know what we were doing so that reflects on the album and makes kind of cute if you will.&quot;

In 2017, &quot;Loudwire&quot; ranked it as the 16th best power metal album of all time.

== Songs and themes ==

Regarding the track &quot;Blank File&quot;, which covers the topic of privacy on the Internet, vocalist Tony Kakko once stated:

The theme would be again mentioned in the band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Silence&quot;, on the track &quot;Weballergy&quot;.

In the song &quot;Letter to Dana&quot;, the title character, Dana O&#x27;Hara, is named after &quot;The X-Files&quot;&#x27;s Dana Scully.

== 15th anniversary re-recording ==
In 2014 Sonata Arctica announced through their Facebook page that they had re-recorded the entire album for its 15th anniversary. The new edition is titled &quot;Ecliptica - Revisited; 15th Anniversary Edition&quot; and was released on 24 October 2014, with the same track-listing as the original regular edition release plus one unreleased bonus track.

Commenting on the album, keyboardist Henrik Klingenberg (who was not a member of the band at the time &quot;Ecliptica&quot; was released) said:
The re-recording&#x27;s first single was &quot;Kingdom for a Heart&quot;, released digitally on 12 September 2014. According to Klingenberg, the song was chosen in order to &quot;represent the overall sound of the album&quot;.

On an interview held after the album release, Klingenberg said the only significant changes applied to the album were the lower keys and the rearranged solos, and that the band resisted the &quot;temptation&quot; to give the songs a &quot;complete overhaul&quot;. He also said most of the album was recorded in the band members&#x27; own home studios, during breaks from their Pariah&#x27;s Child World Tour. He also commented:

<doc id="665601" wikidata="Q1094330" url="?curid=665601" title="Silence (Sonata Arctica album)">
<text>Silence is the second full-length album by Finnish power metal band Sonata Arctica, released in 2001 through Spinefarm Records. It is the only studio album to feature keyboardist Mikko Härkin, and the first album with original member Marko Paasikoski on bass, who returned to the band the previous year. Stratovarius lead singer Timo Kotipelto sang guest vocals on the album.

== Concept and themes ==
The cover art, featuring a landscape divided into night, summer and winter, was meant to depict nature. However, Tony explained that the cover was not supposed to feature too much symbolism, except for the footprints leading away from the campfire. He explained:

The title of the album was at first supposed to be longer, but Kakko&#x27;s then-girlfriend suggested &quot;silence&quot; and he reflected on how important silence was for him:

The second track &quot;Weballergy&quot; is considered by Kakko to be a sequel to &quot;Ecliptica&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Blank File&quot;, as both of them cover the theme of Internet privacy.

&quot;The End of This Chapter&quot; starts the so-called Caleb saga, a series of songs that is continued in &quot;Reckoning Night&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Say a Word&quot;, &quot;Unia&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Caleb&quot;, &quot;The Days of Grays&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Juliet&quot;, &quot;The Ninth Hour&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Till Death&#x27;s Done Us Apart&quot;, and &quot;Talviyö&quot;&#x27;s &quot;The Last of the Lambs&quot;.

&quot;The Power of One&quot; is the longest Sonata Arctica song to date, at a length of 10:43, not including an extra minute of silence followed by an outtake from the narrator.

<doc id="665604" wikidata="Q240808" url="?curid=665604" title="Moe Tucker">
<text>Maureen Ann &quot;Moe&quot; Tucker (born August 26, 1944) is an American musician, singer, and songwriter who achieved international fame as the drummer of the rock band the Velvet Underground. Tucker occasionally sang lead vocals with the group, including the songs &quot;After Hours&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Sticking With You&quot;.

After the Velvet Underground disbanded in the early 1970s, she took a hiatus to focus on her marriage and family. She returned in the 1980s, and, until the late 2000s, released four studio albums and performed as a session musician. In 1996, Tucker was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Velvet Underground.

==Early life==
Maureen Tucker was born in Jackson Heights, Queens, New York City, and grew up in Levittown, New York in a middle-class Catholic family. Her father, James, was a housepainter and her mother, Margaret, was a clerical worker. She had an older brother, Jim, who was friends with Sterling Morrison, and a sister, Margo. 

== Career ==
=== The Velvet Underground ===

Tucker began playing the drums in 1963, at age 19. When she was asked to join the Velvet Underground, she had dropped out of Ithaca College and was working for IBM as a keypunch operator. The band&#x27;s original percussionist, Angus Maclise, had left in November 1965 because he felt the band sold out when it took a paying gig. Tucker was drafted because Velvets guitarist Sterling Morrison remembered her as the younger sister of his high school friend, Jim, who played the drums. Tucker was frequently noted for her androgynous appearance. In spite of this, Tucker has said that she never experienced difficulties due to sexism during this time.

Tucker&#x27;s style of playing was unconventional. She played standing up rather than seated (for easier access to the bass drum), using a simplified drum kit of tom toms, a snare drum and an upturned bass drum, playing with mallets rather than drumsticks. She rarely used cymbals; she claimed that since she felt the purpose of a drummer was simply to &quot;keep time&quot;, cymbals were unnecessary for this purpose and drowned out the other instruments. Rock critic Robert Christgau said of Tucker, &quot;Mo was a great drummer in a minimalist, autodidactic way that I think changed musical history. She is where the punk notion of how the beat works begins.&quot;

Apart from drumming, Tucker sang co-lead vocals on three Velvet Underground songs: the acoustic guitar number &quot;After Hours&quot; and the experimental poetry track &quot;The Murder Mystery&quot;, both from 1969&#x27;s &quot;The Velvet Underground&quot; album, as well as &quot;I&#x27;m Sticking with You&quot;, a song recorded in 1969 but left (officially) unreleased until it appeared on the 1985 outtakes compilation &quot;VU&quot;. Lou Reed said of &quot;After Hours&quot; that it was &quot;so innocent and pure&quot; that he could not possibly sing it himself. In the early days, Tucker also occasionally played the bass guitar during live gigs, an instrument that was usually played by the band&#x27;s regular bassist John Cale. Morrison would normally play the bass if Cale was occupied with viola or keyboards, despite his lack of enthusiasm for playing the instrument. However, some songs had Reed and Morrison playing their usual guitars and Cale was occupied with viola or keyboards and as a result, nobody was on bass: two examples of this are &quot;Heroin&quot; and &quot;Sister Ray&quot;.

Tucker temporarily left the group when she became pregnant with her first child, Kerry &quot;Trucker&quot; Tucker, in early 1970. Because of her pregnancy, Tucker was only able to play on a couple of outtakes for &quot;Loaded&quot;, which would become the band&#x27;s fourth and final album with Lou Reed. Billy Yule, the younger and high-school-age brother of bassist Doug Yule, filled in the role of drummer for live performances and some of the songs on the album.

Tucker returned to the band in late 1970, by which time Reed had left the group and Doug Yule had assumed leadership. She toured North America (United States and Canada) and Europe (United Kingdom and the Netherlands) with the band during 1970 and 1971; shortly afterward, she quit the band and the music business altogether to raise a family.

Tucker participated in the 1993 Velvet Underground reunion, touring Europe and releasing the double album &quot;Live MCMXCIII&quot;.

In 2017 she played at the Grammy Salute to Music Legends awards ceremony. A band, amongst others, consisting of John Cale, played two Velvet Underground classics &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Waiting For The Man&quot;. The Velvet Underground was the recipient of the 2017 Merit Award.

In 2021, Tucker participated in Todd Haynes&#x27; documentary &quot;The Velvet Underground&quot;.

=== Other work ===
Tucker moved to Phoenix, Arizona, in 1971, where she lived with her husband and children. While living in Phoenix, she played drums in the short-lived band Paris 1942 with Alan Bishop of the Sun City Girls. In the early 1980s, she divorced and relocated to Douglas, Georgia, where she was hired at a Wal-Mart distribution center. She quit the job in 1989 when she was asked to go on tour of Europe with the band Half Japanese.

Tucker started recording and touring again, releasing a number of albums on small, independent labels that feature her singing and playing guitar, fronting her own band. This band at times included former Velvets colleague Sterling Morrison.

Apart from releasing her own records, Tucker has made guest performances on a number of others&#x27; records, including producing &quot;Fire in the Sky&quot; (1992) for Half Japanese, whose guitarist, John Sluggett, plays drums on her own recordings. In Jeff Feuerzeig&#x27;s documentary about Half Japanese, &quot;The Band That Would Be King&quot;, Tucker performs and is interviewed extensively. Also, she has appeared with Magnet and former Velvet Underground band members Lou Reed (&quot;New York&quot;) and John Cale (&quot;Walking on Locusts&quot;).

Tucker also played drums on and produced the album &quot;The Lives of Charles Douglas&quot; by indie rocker and novelist Charles Douglas (also known as Alex McAulay) in 1999.

She played bass drum, wrote songs, and sang with the New York/Memphis punk rock–delta blues fusion group the Kropotkins with Lorette Velvette and Dave Soldier, whom she met in John Cale&#x27;s band, in 1999–2003, recording &quot;Five Points Crawl&quot;.

In a 2010 interview, Tucker said she had ceased making music several years prior.

== Artistry ==
As a teenager, Tucker was an avid fan of Babatunde Olatunji, whose music she first heard on Murray the K&#x27;s radio show. Olatunji, along with Bo Diddley and the Rolling Stones, inspired her to become a musician. Without any formal instruction, she learned by playing along with popular songs on a second-hand drum kit.

== Personal life ==
Tucker was married in the early 1970s, and divorced some time in the early 1980s. She has five children: Kerry, Keith, Austen, Kate, and Richard. Tucker lives in Douglas, Georgia, where she raised her family.

During an April 2009 interview at a Tea Party rally in Tifton, Georgia, Tucker revealed to a WALB NBC news crew that she is a supporter of the Republican Party. She voiced support for the Tea Party movement and said she was &quot;furious about the way we&#x27;re being led towards socialism&quot;. On the official &quot;Tea Party Patriots&quot; website, Tucker stated: &quot;I have come to believe (not just wonder) that Obama&#x27;s plan is to destroy America from within.&quot;

<text>A parī or peri is a supernatural entity originating from Persian tales and distributed into wider Asian folklore. The &quot;parī&quot;s are often described as winged creatures of immense beauty who are structured in societies similar to that of humans. Unlike jinn, the &quot;parī&quot;s usually feature in tales involving supernatural elements.

Over time, the depiction of &quot;parī&quot;s was subject to change and reconsideration. In early Persian beliefs, the &quot;parī&quot;s were probably a class of evil spirits and only later received a positive reception. In the Islamic period, the &quot;parī&quot; already developed into morally complex beings with a generally positive connotation of immense beauty, and late in the tenth century, were integrated into the Arab houri-tale tradition. They are often contrasted by their nemesis the ugly &quot;dīv&quot;s.

Despite their beauty, the &quot;parī&quot;s are also feared because they are said to abduct people and take them to their
home-world, Parīstān, or punish people for social transgressions.

==Etymology==
The Persian word comes from Middle Persian , itself from Old Persian &quot;*&quot;. The word may stem from the same root as the Persian word &#x27;wing&#x27;, although other proposed etymologies exist.

The etymological relation to the English word &quot;fairy&quot; is disputed. Some argue that there is no relation and that both words derive from different meanings. Others argue that both terms share a common origin: the English term &quot;fairy&quot; deriving from &quot;fier&quot; (enchant) and the Persian term from &quot;par&quot; (enchant). However, there is no consensus on either theory.

== Persian literature==

Originally, the &quot;parī&quot;s have been considered a class of &quot;dēvatā&quot; and the term &quot;dīvānah&quot; refers to a person who lost reason because they fell in love, as the beloved steals the lover&#x27;s reason. In this regard, the &quot;parī&quot; features similar to the Arabic &quot;jinn&quot;. The &quot;jinn&quot;, unlike the &quot;parī&quot;s, do not have connotations of beauty however. In Middle Persian literature, comets have been identified with &quot;parī&quot;. Comets and planets were associated with evil, while the Sun, the Moon, and the fixed stars, with good. Such negative associations of the planets, however, are not supported in Avestan languages.

In popular literature of the Islamic period, &quot;parī&quot;s are non-human beings with wings and magical powers. They are often, though not necessarily, female and employ an erotic appeal to mortal men. As early as the tenth century, &quot;parī&quot; feature as a template for the exquisite beauty of &quot;the beloved&quot; in Persianate folklore and poetry, echoing an identification with the Arabic Houri. However, the term has also been used as a synonym for &quot;jinn&quot;.

At the start of Ferdowsi&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, &quot;The Book of Kings&quot;, the divinity Sorush appears in the form of a &quot;parī&quot; to warn Keyumars (the mythological first man and shah of the world) and his son Siamak of the threats posed by the destructive Ahriman. &quot;Parīs&quot; also form part of the mythological army that Keyumars eventually draws up to defeat Ahriman and his demonic son.

In the stories of One Thousand and One Nights, a &quot;parī&quot; appears only in the story of &quot;Ahmad and Pari Bānu&quot;. The tale is a combination of originally two separate stories; the &quot;parī&quot; features in the latter, when Prince Ahmad meets the beautiful princess Pari Banu. Ahmad has to deal with difficult tasks he manages to comply by aid of his fairy-wife.

== Folklore==

From India, across Northern Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran to Central Asia, and Turkey, local traditions variously acknowledge the existence of a supernatural creature called &quot;parī&quot;. The term &quot;parī&quot; is attested in Turkish sources from the 11th century onward and was probably associated with the Arabic &quot;jinn&quot; when entering the Turkic beliefs through Islamic sources. Although &quot;jinn&quot; and &quot;parī&quot;s are sometimes used as synonyms, the term &quot;parī&quot; is more frequently used in supernatural tales. According to the book &quot;People of the Air&quot;, the &quot;parī&quot;s are morally ambivalent creatures, and can be either Muslims or infidels.

According to Turkologist Ignác Kúnos, the &quot;parī&quot; in Turkish tales fly through the air with cloud-like garments of a green colour, but also in the shape of doves. They also number forty, seven or three, and serve a Fairy-king that can be a human person they abducted from the human world. Like vestals, Kúnos wrote, the &quot;parī&quot; belong to the spiritual realm until love sprouts in their hearts, and they must join with their mortal lovers, being abandoned by their sisters to their own devices. Also, the first meeting between humans and &quot;parī&quot; occurs during the latter&#x27;s bathtime. The &quot;parī&quot;s are usually considered benevolent in Turkish sources. Shamans in Kazakhstan sometimes consult &quot;parī&quot; for aid in spiritual rituals. Uyghur shamans use the aid of &quot;parī&quot; to heal women from miscarriage, and protect from evil jinn. According to the Kho, &quot;parī&quot;s are able to cast love spells, sometimes used by a spiritual master referred to as &quot;Master of Faries&quot;. 

Sometimes the &quot;parī&quot;s would take interest in the life of humans and abduct them to invite them to weddings of fellow &quot;parī&quot;. Alleged abductions can be either physical or psychological, in which case their victims lose consciousness. During the periods of abductions, people claim to be able to see, hear, and interact with &quot;parī&quot;, and sometimes even report their words and appearance.

&quot;Parī&quot; were the target of a lower level of evil &quot;Dīvs&quot; (دیو), who persecuted them by locking them in iron cages. This persecution was brought about by, as the &quot;Dīvs&quot; perceived it, the &quot;parī&quot;&#x27; lack of sufficient self-esteem to join the rebellion against perversion.

== Islamic scripture and interpretations==
Abu Ali Bal&#x27;ami&#x27;s interpretation of the &quot;Qiṣaṣ al-anbiyāʾ&quot;, the &quot;History of the Prophets and Kings&quot;, God creates &quot;parī&quot; at some point after the vicious &quot;dīvs&quot;. They ruled the world until it was given to a tribe of angels called al-jinn (&quot;fereštegan&quot;), those leader was Iblis. Although the &quot;parī&quot; are still present after the creation of Adam, and were present during the time of Keyumar, it is only after the flood that they became hidden from the sight of humankind.

Isma&#x27;ilite scholar Nasir Khusraw (1004 – between 1072–1088) elaborates on the concept of &quot;parī&quot; in his explanation of angels, jinn, and devils. He asserts that &quot;parī&quot; is the Persian term for &quot;jinn&quot;. Then, he proceeds that the &quot;parī&quot;s are divided into two categories: angel and devil. Each &quot;parī&quot; would be both a potential angel and a potential devil (&quot;dīv&quot;), depending on obedience or disobedience.

==Western representations==
Arthur de Gobineau tells in his travel report about his &#x27;three years in Asia&#x27; a story involving Fath-Ali Shah Qajar and &quot;parī&quot;. Shah Qajar is said to have had a strong inclination towards the occult and had high respect for experts in the supernatural such as dervishes. One day, a dervish warned him that the prince needed precautions to meet the parī. The affection of parī might soon turn into wrath when he acted in a way that might offend it. He then prepares for a meeting at a pavilion outside the city. The garden was adorned with precious golden and silver vessels, jewelry, and costly furniture for the special occasion. After sunset, he fell asleep. When he woke up again, he found that there was not only was there no parī but also that the dervish was gone. The author of the tale was probably familiarized with the tale on his travels to Tehran at orders of Napoleon III in 1855. The authors leave a mark of mockery and use it as a sign of the Persian&#x27;s gullibility. Whether Gobineau&#x27;s remark holds true or not, the story reflects the popularity of such belief in Iranian consciousness.

In Thomas Moore&#x27;s poem &quot;Paradise and the Peri,&quot; part of his &quot;Lalla Rookh&quot;, a peri gains entrance to heaven after three attempts at giving an angel the gift most dear to God. The first attempt is &quot;The last libation Liberty draws/From the heart that bleeds and breaks in her cause,&quot; a drop of blood from a young soldier killed for an attempt on the life of Mahmud of Ghazni. Next is a &quot;Precious sigh/of pure, self-sacrificing love&quot;: a sigh stolen from the dying lips of a maiden who died with her lover of bubonic plague in the Mountains of the Moon (Rwenzori Mountains) rather than surviving in exile from the disease and the lover. The third gift, the one that gets the peri into heaven, is a &quot;Tear that, warm and meek/Dew&#x27;d that repentant sinner&#x27;s cheek&quot;: the tear of an evil old man who repented upon seeing a child praying in the ruins of the Temple of Zeus at Baalbek. Robert Schumann set Moore&#x27;s tale to music as an oratorio, &quot;Paradise and the Peri&quot;, using an abridged German translation.

<doc id="665611" wikidata="Q78720" url="?curid=665611" title="Ignaz Seipel">
<text>Ignaz Seipel (19 July 1876 – 2 August 1932) was an Austrian Catholic priest and conservative politician, who served as the Chancellor of the First Austrian Republic twice during the 1920s and leader of the Christian Social Party. He is considered the most prominent statesman of the Austrian right in the interwar period.

Born into a modest bourgeois family, Seipel grew up in the town of Meidling, near Vienna, where he completed his studies before enrolling at the University of Vienna. He studied theology and was ordained as a priest in 1899. After serving in a rural parish, he returned to the imperial capital to pursue a doctorate. In 1908, he became an assistant professor of moral theology at the University of Vienna, and a year later, a full professor of the same discipline at the University of Salzburg, where he taught for the next eight years.

Seipel took an interest in social, educational, and economic issues and became friends with Heinrich Lammasch, a prominent Austrian jurist and the last Imperial Minister-President, who appointed him Minister of Social Welfare in his cabinet in late 1918. Although a monarchist, Seipel played a key role in helping the Christian Socialists accept the new republican system. He built up political Catholicism by aligning the clericals with Vienna&#x27;s large bourgeoisie, often of Jewish descent. Over time, his political stance evolved: while initially a strong supporter of the Austria–Hungary and the Habsburg dynasty, after World War I, he adopted a conciliatory approach toward socialists and democracy to prevent the establishment of a left-wing dictatorship. Later, between 1922 and 1924, he distanced himself from the socialists, forming alliances with capitalist and anti-Marxist groups. Disillusioned with democracy, by 1927, Seipel advocated for replacing it with an authoritarian system with clerical.

A dominant figure in Austrian politics during the 1920s, Seipel served as Chancellor from 31 May 1922 to 3 April 1929, except for a period between 1924 and 1926. In 1922, he managed to end severe inflation through an international stabilization loan, although this meant subjecting state economic policy to the supervision of the League of Nations. Deeply anti-socialist, he led a government coalition of Christian Socialists and Pan-Germans. Considered brilliant and the most capable conservative politician of his time, Seipel shared with his socialist rival, Otto Bauer, a firm commitment to defending their principles. Within his party, Seipel belonged to the most radical and conservative faction, which included the most capable leaders. Even when not leading the government, he wielded significant influence in the Christian Social Party. He played a crucial role in both the Christian Socialists&#x27; acceptance of the republic and their eventual abandonment of democracy. In his later years, Seipel supported constitutional reforms to establish an authoritarian government and worked closely with fascist groups like the Heimwehr (&quot;Home Guard&quot;), an organization similar to the German Freikorps. He died in 1932, suffering from diabetes and tuberculosis.

== Life ==

=== Academician and priest ===
 The son of a Viennese carriage driver, Seipel graduated from an academic high school () in Vienna in 1895, then studied Catholic theology at the University of Vienna. He was ordained a priest on 23 July 1899 and received his doctorate in theology in 1903. Seipel was a member or honorary member of numerous Catholic student fraternities.

In his 1907 work reflecting Catholic social teaching, &quot;Ethical Teachings on Economics of the Church Fathers,&quot; he was the first to use the phrase &quot;economic ethics&quot;. In 1908 he joined the Catholic Theological Faculty of the University of Vienna. From 1909 to 1917 he was professor of moral theology at the University of Salzburg. There he published his study &quot;Nation and State&quot; (1916), which helped cement his later prominent role in the Christian Social Party. In the book he viewed the state – the self-governing political entity – as the primary justification of sovereignty, rather than the nation – a group that shares a common culture, as for example speakers of German. In 1917 he was appointed professor at the University of Vienna, succeeding the moral theologian Franz Martin Schindler.

=== Politician ===
On 27 October 1918, during the final days of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Emperor Karl I appointed Seipel Minister of Public Works and Social Welfare in the ministry of Heinrich Lammasch, the last &quot;imperial and royal&quot; government of the Empire. At the beginning of November 1918, Seipel handed over his official duties to the government of Karl Renner of the Social Democratic Party of Austria. It had been appointed on 30 October 1918 by the State Council of German-Austria, the executive body of the short-lived Republic of German-Austria. The Lammasch ministry remained formally in office at the request of the Emperor until his own withdrawal. While still an imperial minister, Seipel was involved in formulating the declaration of abdication that the Emperor signed on 11 November 1918. On the same day the Emperor dismissed the Lammasch ministry.

On 16 February 1919 Seipel was elected on the Christian Social ticket to the Constituent National Assembly, the body that adopted the constitution for the First Austrian Republic, which replaced the Republic of German-Austria. Seipel&#x27;s parliamentary group elected him to the club presidium, one of its leadership bodies.

Seipel prevented the party from splitting in 1918 over the question of the abolition of the monarchy that was advocated by the Social Democrats and the greater Germans, the name for those who wanted Austria to join the German Reich (the Weimar Republic). In March 1919 he spoke out against the two parties&#x27; annexation euphoria on the grounds that annexation of German Austria to the German Reich was generally rejected by the victorious Allies of World War I and would endanger the peace treaty. In 1920 he nevertheless broke the Christian Social Party away from the coalition with the Social Democrats and formed an alliance with the nationalist Greater German People&#x27;s Party.

Although Seipel supported the Austrian Republic&#x27;s new parliamentary democracy, he was clearly skeptical of it. During the preliminary deliberations on the Federal Constitution in 1920 and thereafter in 1922, Seipel advocated a partial weakening of parliament in favor of a federal president endowed with significantly more extensive powers.

At the same time, Seipel supported the development of militant right-wing groups in Vienna, as seen above all in the fact that beginning in March 1920 he was a board member of the secret Association for Order and Law (). The group included monarchist and greater German representatives as well as military figures. It planned the forcible suppression of the Social Democrats and worked closely with the Bavarian right-wing radicals around Georg Escherich.

In September 1920, in a speech that was clearly tinged with anti-Semitism, Seipel called for a numerus clausus – an enrollment limit – for Jews at higher-level schools, colleges, and universities &quot;according to population&quot;.
==== Chancellor of Austria ====
Seipel served as chairman of the Christian Social Party (CS) from 1921 to 1930. At his party&#x27;s request, he was Chancellor of Austria in a Christian Social – Greater German coalition from 31 May 1922 to 20 November 1924. During his first term he personally coordinated the distribution of industry funds to right-wing militias. Seipel&#x27;s primary concern was with their military efficiency; ideological proximity to the CS party was secondary. He focused on the right-wing Front Fighters Union of German Austria under the anti-Semite Hermann Hiltl, which he also helped re-arm with financial resources from the Hungarian Horthy regime.

Seipel reorganized state finances with the aid of a League of Nations loan which was obtained when Austria officially renounced annexation to Germany. In order to fight the hyperinflation of the krone currency, the government prepared for the introduction of the schilling on 1 March 1925 and re-founded Austria&#x27;s central bank, the , with the task of securing monetary stability. 

In the fall of 1924 the Bavarian Immigration Police considered deporting Adolf Hitler from Bavaria to Austria if he were released from prison early. Hitler had been serving time at Landsberg Prison in Bavaria since April 1924 following his failed Beer Hall Putsch in 1923. Seipel did not want the putschist and troublemaker back in Austria and sent Bavaria a statement saying that Hitler had become a German by serving in its army. Bavaria attested that Austria had recognized the Austrian citizenship of German soldiers in other cases, but Seipel adhered to his legal opinion.

===== Assassination attempt and resignation =====
After fierce criticism from his own party and an assassination attempt on 1 June 1924, he resigned on 8 November 1924 but remained chairman of the Christian Socialist Deputies&#x27; Association. The would-be assassin, Karl Jaworek (or Jawurek), blamed Seipel for his poverty and shot the Chancellor at close range on the platform of a Vienna train station. Jaworek was sentenced to five years of hard labor.

Theodor Körner, a retired general and successful Social Democratic candidate for parliament in 1924, paid tribute to Seipel during the election campaign. The Innsbruck newspaper quoted him saying that Seipel was &quot;as a character of integrity in every respect, a diligent, selfless worker&quot;.

===== Reelection and second term =====
From 1926 to 1929, Seipel was again Chancellor, fighting in particular against the Social Democrats. He united the CS with the Greater German People&#x27;s Party, the &quot;Landbund&quot; (Rural Federation), and the National Socialist &quot;Riehl and Schulz Group&quot; to form an anti-Marxist front (the &quot;Citizens&#x27; Bloc&quot;). After the National Assembly election of 1927 in which Seipel&#x27;s bloc won the majority of seats, there was a more rapid growth in the fundamental attitude that opposed Austrian democracy. With the help of Austrian industrialists, Chancellor Seipel strengthened the role of the increasingly anti-democratic Heimwehr and remained its most influential advocate until his death. This made him the great enemy of the Social Democrats.

In the Austrian town of Schattendorf on 30 January 1927, members of a right-wing paramilitary group fired on Social Democratic demonstrators, including members of its paramilitary Republican Protection League (&quot;Republikanischer Schutzbund&quot;), killing two and wounding five. The acquittal of the men charged in the deaths led to the July Revolt of 1927 in Vienna during which police killed 89 protestors and wounded over 600. Afterwards, Social Democrats called Seipel a &quot;prelate without clemency&quot;, a &quot;prelate without mercy&quot; and a &quot;blood prelate&quot;. In his statement before the lower house of parliament, the National Council, on 26 July 1927, Seipel said, &quot;In these days of misfortune, do not ask anything of the parliament and the government that would seem merciful to the victims and the guilty but would be cruel to the wounded republic.&quot; Seipel&#x27;s statement was followed by an intensely heated parliamentary debate. The opposition seized on the phrase &quot;without mercy&quot; and linked it to their criticism of the excessive police action, for which they blamed Police Commissioner and former Austrian chancellor Johann Schober.

In 1928, Seipel, in agreement with Karl Buresch, the governor of Lower Austria, championed the interests of the Heimwehr by approving its march in Wiener Neustadt, as well as one by the Republican Protection League, against the express wish of Wiener Neustadt Mayor Anton Ofenböck. As Chancellor, Seipel was able to show his strength with a massive contingent of police and military. There were no violent incidents on the days of the marches.

Seipel resigned from the office of chancellor on 4 April 1929, although he continued in office until 4 May, when he was succeeded as head of government by Ernst Streeruwitz, also of the Christian Social Party. In all, five federal governments of the First Republic were under Seipel&#x27;s leadership.

=== Post-chancellorship and contemporary assessments ===
Seipel was not satisfied with the First Republic&#x27;s form of government. He was a major driver behind the push to strengthen the role of the federal president that was realized in the 1929 amendment to the federal constitution. Seipel negotiated it with the Social Democrats and &quot;probably thought of himself as the future holder of the office&quot;. Under the political slogan of &quot;true democracy&quot;, he proposed a cleansing of the system from the &quot;evil of party rule&quot;:

In 1930 Seipel was briefly Austrian foreign minister in the cabinet of Carl Vaugoin. After the bankruptcy of the Creditanstalt Bank in 1931, he was to take over the reins of government again but was unsuccessful in forming a coalition.

Decades later, Bruno Kreisky, Social Democratic Federal Chancellor from 1970 to 1983, criticized his own party for the 1931 events. Seipel had offered Otto Bauer, the head of the Social Democrats, a coalition at the height of the world economic crisis. The party executive, however, had not taken him up on it. &quot;In retrospect, it seems to me clearly wrong not to have pushed harder for a compromise in order to be in government at such a critical moment. ... In my opinion, this was the last chance to save Austrian democracy,&quot; Kreisky wrote in 1986.

Seipel had seen in the Jews a class that represented mobile large capital and a &quot;certain kind of merchant mentality&quot; by which the people felt threatened in their economic existence. Austria, Seipel said, was &quot;in danger of being dominated economically, culturally, and politically by the Jews.&quot; As a solution to the so-called Jewish question, he proposed recognizing the Jews as a national minority.

While Seipel&#x27;s politics were initially characterized by a belief in Austria&#x27;s self-reliance, he later took the view that without the German Reich Austrian politics were not meaningful.

=== Death ===
Seipel suffered from tuberculosis and also from diabetes as a consequences of the assassination attempt against him. In December 1930 he went to Merano for a cure, where he received a telegram from Pope Pius XI wishing him a speedy recovery so that he could &quot;return to his so meritorious activity&quot;. He died in 1932 in the Lower Austrian sanatorium Wienerwald. Otto Bauer dedicated an obituary to him in the &quot;Arbeiter-Zeitung&quot; (&quot;Workers&#x27; Newspaper&quot;), in which he attested to Seipel&#x27;s &quot;honest inner conviction&quot;:

== Commemorations ==


Since Seipel was regarded by the Social Democrats as the epitome of reaction and of the alliance between clericalism and capitalism, the article was received with incomprehension by the party base. Bauer felt compelled to point out in another article the difference between &quot;emotional socialists and trained Marxists&quot;. While the sentimental socialist hates the capitalist and the spokesmen of the capitalist world, the Marxist understands his opponents as creatures of a hostile social order. Seipel &quot;is to us, precisely because we are Marxists, because he fought us and we fought him, not a villain, but the &#x27;creature of conditions of which he remains socially, however much he may subjectively rise above them&#x27;.&quot;

The corporatist, Austro-fascist Federal State of Austria (1934–1938) considered Seipel to be the founding father of the regime. As Seipel&#x27;s final resting place, the Christ the King Church was built in Vienna&#x27;s working-class district of Rudolfsheim-Fünfhaus, six blocks from Seipel&#x27;s birthplace, on the initiative of the women&#x27;s and workers&#x27; rights activist Hildegard Burjan and supported by Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuß. Seipel&#x27;s coffin was interred in the crypt of the church in the fall of 1934. Dollfuß had been assassinated by a Nazi two months earlier. His successor Kurt Schuschnigg had Dollfuß buried there; the regime named the church the &quot;Seipel-Dollfuß Memorial Church&quot;.

After the 1938 annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany, it had both coffins reburied in 1939: Seipel&#x27;s coffin was moved to a grave of honor at the Vienna Central Cemetery. The grave is located directly next to the presidential crypt in front of the St. Charles Borromeo Cemetery Church, then called the &quot;Dr. Karl Lueger Memorial Church&quot; after the founder of the Christian Social Party. Dollfuß was buried in the Hietzing cemetery in Vienna.

On 27 April 1934 the dictatorial city administration renamed the Ring of November 12, a part of Vienna&#x27;s Ringstrasse commemorating the founding of the Republic, to the Dr.-Ignaz-Seipel-Ring in the section in front of the Parliament building. In 1940 it was renamed after the Nazi Gauleiter Josef Bürckel; on 27 April 1945 it became Seipel-Ring again and on 8 July 1956 it was given its present name, Dr.-Karl-Renner-Ring.

== In the arts ==
In Hugo Bettauer&#x27;s 1922 novel &quot;Die Stadt ohne Juden&quot; (The City Without Jews), the character of the Christian Socialist Chancellor Dr. Karl Schwertfeger, who has all Jews expelled from the country, is based on Seipel. Hans Karl Breslauer&#x27;s 1924 film of the same name was based on Bettauer&#x27;s book.

<text>Gary Dourdan (born Gary Robert Durdin: December 11, 1966) is an American actor. He is known for portraying Warrick Brown on the television series &quot;,&quot; Shazza Zulu on the television series &quot;A Different World&quot; and Mickey Monroe in crime thriller &quot;Righteous Villains&quot;.

==Early life==
Dourdan was born Gary Robert Durdin in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Sandy, a teacher and fashion designer, and Robert Durdin, an entrepreneur and agent for jazz musicians. Dourdan is the fourth of five children. When he was six, his 21-year-old brother Darryl died after falling from a balcony in Haiti while &quot;doing research on the family lineage.&quot; The case remains unsolved. In his youth he moved with his family to Willingboro Township, New Jersey. During that time, his interests included acting, music, and martial arts. Later, Dourdan moved to New York City, and he worked as a doorman at a rehearsal studio.

==Career==
Dourdan played in several bands in New York City in the early 1990s and acted in regional theatre in the New York metropolitan area. He acted in music videos, including playing Janet Jackson&#x27;s love interest in the video for her 1993 hit &quot;Again,&quot; and had a cameo in the music video &quot;Move the Crowd&quot; by Eric B. &amp; Rakim. Debbie Allen cast him as Shazza Zulu on &quot;A Different World&quot;, based on a tape of him in an avant-garde play. In 1996, Dourdan appeared in the &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot; episode &quot;Never on Sunday&quot; playing Ziggy, an assistant to Baron Sunday. In 1997, he played Christie, the first mate and second in command of the spaceship &quot;Betty&quot; in the film &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot;. He also appeared in the films &quot;Playing God&quot; and &quot;Thursday&quot;, and on television, he starred in the Dick Wolf production &quot;Swift Justice&quot; and played a recurring role on the series &quot;Soul Food&quot;. Dourdan joined hip-hop artist DMC (of Run–D.M.C.) onstage at the Live 8 concert in Barrie, Ontario, and sang alongside Macy Gray at the 2005 Emmy Awards. He is an alternative musician and a record producer.

In 2007, he played the character Cameron, the boyfriend of Rowena Price (Halle Berry), in the film &quot;Perfect Stranger&quot;.

Dourdan&#x27;s most popular role was as a cast member of the series &quot;&quot;, which debuted on October 6, 2000. He played analyst Warrick Brown, who has a checkered past fraught with gambling problems. By working in Las Vegas, the character uses his personal experiences to help his career.

In 2008, there was media speculation surrounding Dourdan&#x27;s &quot;CSI&quot; contract negotiations with CBS. The parties could not reach a resolution, and as a result, his contract was not renewed. It was reported on April 14, 2008 that Dourdan was leaving the show. In the Season 8 finale, Dourdan&#x27;s character was shot and left for dead at the episode&#x27;s end. The Season 9 premiere revealed Dourdan&#x27;s character dying in the arms of his colleague and friend Gil Grissom.

After leaving &quot;CSI&quot;, he took recurring roles as Stephan in the series &quot;Christine&quot; and Sheldon DeWitt in the series &quot;Being Mary Jane&quot;.

==Personal life==
Dourdan has African-American, Native American, Franco-Haitian (Haiti), Jewish, Irish, and Scottish ancestry. He married model Roshumba Williams in 1992; they divorced two years later. He has two children: a son, Lyric, with Cynthia Hadden, and a daughter, Nyla, with Jennifer Sutton, whom Dourdan dated from 1995 to 2000.

Dourdan collects classic cars and was featured on Season 1, Episode 3, of &quot;Street Customs&quot;.

===Legal issues===
In 2008, Dourdan was arrested for possession of cocaine and ecstasy. A third charge, possession of heroin, was dropped. Despite rumors, the drug charges had nothing to do with his departure from &quot;CSI&quot;, as the contract negotiations had already concluded and he had finished filming the last of his scenes before the incident. In July 2011, after crashing his car, Dourdan was arrested but charges were dropped for drug possession (oxycontin). He was, however, charged with possession of drug paraphernalia. In November 2011, he was arrested for felony battery after breaking his girlfriend&#x27;s nose and placed on five years&#x27; probation. He was also ordered to attend weeks of domestic violence counseling and to stay away from the victim for five years. Dourdan filed for bankruptcy in August 2012, owing roughly $1.7 million to creditors.

<doc id="665625" wikidata="Q86008656" url="?curid=665625" title="Treatise on Man">
<text>The Treatise on Man () is an unfinished treatise by René Descartes written in the 1630s and published posthumously, firstly in 1662 in Latin, then in 1664 in French by Claude Clerselier. The 1664 edition is accompanied by a short text, &quot;The Description of the Human Body and All Its Functions&quot; (&quot;La description du corps humain et de toutes ses fonctions&quot;), also known as the &quot;Treatise on the Formation of the Foetus&quot; (&quot;Traité de la formation du fœtus&quot;), the remarks of Louis La Forge and the translated preface from the Latin edition by Florent Schuyl.

== Editorial context == 

René Descartes begins to write the treaty in the 1630s and gives up publishing it when he learns of Galileo&#x27;s condemnation.

A first version of the text appeared in Latin in 1662, edited and prefaced by Florent Schuyl, who proposed another edition in 1664 in the same language from another manuscript. The first French language edition was published the same year, edited by Claude Clerselier. It includes figures composed by Descartes, Louis de la Forge and Gérard von Gutschoven, as well as a division into 106 numbered articles by Claude Clerselier. There is attached a treatise found in Descartes&#x27; inventory under the name of &quot;Description of the human body&quot; and designated as the &quot;Treaty of the fetus&quot; by Clerselier, as well as the preface by Schuyl to the Latin edition of 1662 and a long commentary by Louis de la Forge.

== Summary ==

=== &quot;Treatise of Man&quot; ===
The opening of the treatise shows its unfinished state : it announces the description of the body, then that of the soul and finally of the articulation between the two; only the first presents itself to the reader&#x27;s eyes. It adopts a fictional form, describing a being similar to man regardless of any consideration of his formation and the addition of a rational soul, therefore like a machine.

The first part deals with the main functions of this bodily machine : digestion, nutrition, respiration, blood circulation and the formation of animal spirits. Descartes claims that meats are digested by liquors and that part of it is converted into blood in the liver. The blood, which circulates perpetually, pushed out of the arteries by the heart, nourishes the various parts of the body. The more subtle parts of the blood go to the brain while the others descend through the vessels intended for generation. Cerebral blood produces in the pineal gland, a “very bright and very pure flame” called animal spirits.

The second part explains the movement. Descartes then uses the metaphor of a fountain. Animal spirits, like water, flow through nerves, like pipes, activating muscles and tendons, compared to various springs and devices. Channels allow the spirits to move from one muscle to the opposite muscle, and to strain or relax them through the valves. Breathing, ingestion and excretion thus correspond to the alternating action of opposing muscles.

The third part is devoted to the external senses of touch, sight, smell, taste and hearing. The pain comes from a tugging of severing nerves and the feeling of harshness from irregularity in their strain. The arousal of the nerves in the tongue gives rise to the taste, which in turn indicates whether a food is suitable for the body. Smell depends on nerve threads that run from the base of the brain to the nose while the auditory nerves are moved by the air leading into the ears. Descartes provides further developments on sight, describing in a review the structure of the eye, the function of three ocular humors, as well as the mechanism of vision.

The fourth focuses on the inner senses of hunger, thirst, joy and sadness, as well as the role of the organs in the formation of animal spirits. Appetite arises from the action of liquor on an empty stomach, just as the air or smoke that replaces the lack of liquor in the throat induces the idea of thirst. Comparing the functions of this bodily machine to an organ, Descartes asserts that they depend &quot;on the spirits that come from the heart, the pores of the brain through which it passes and the way these spirits are distributed in the pores.&quot; The natural inclinations are explained by the diversity of minds, itself correlated with food, air and organs.

The fifth deals with the structure of the brain and the formation of different faculties. The brain is a tissue made up of concavities and threads forming a tight mesh, converging towards the gland. Sneezing and dizziness are respectively considered congestion of animal spirits towards the nasal parts or the inner surface. Common sense ideas arise from the actual presence of objects and their impression on animal spirits as they emerge from the H gland, while others are from the imagination. Memory results from more or less lasting and repeated traces left by these impressions. The convergence of minds by this gland explains both the origin of movement and the formation of an idea, which itself can result from the combination of several of them. Descartes develops the influence of the eyes on the action of the gland and the composition of the movement.

=== &quot;The Description of the Human Body&quot; ===
&quot;The Description of the Human Body&quot; is also an unfinished treatise. It was written in 1647. Descartes felt knowing oneself was particularly useful. This for him included medical knowledge. He hoped to cure and prevent disease, even to slow down aging.

René Descartes believed the soul caused conscious thought. The body caused automatic functions like the beating of the heart and digestion he felt. The body was necessary for voluntary movement as well as the will. However, he believed the power to move the body was wrongly imagined to come from the soul. A sick or injured body does not do what we want or moves in ways we do not want. He believed the death of the body stopped it from being fit to bring about movement. This did not necessarily happen because the soul left the body.

René Descartes believed the body could exist through mechanical means alone. This included digestion, blood circulation, muscle movement and some brain function. He felt we all know what the human body is like because animals have similar bodies and we have all seen them opened up.

He saw the body as a machine. He believed the heat of the heart somehow caused all movement of the body. Blood vessels he realized were pipes, he saw that veins carried digested food to the heart. (This was brought further by William Harvey. Harvey developed the idea of the circulation of the blood.) Descartes felt that an energetic part of blood went to the brain and there gave the brain a special type of air imbued with vital force that enabled the brain to experience, think and imagine. This special air then went through the nerves to the muscles enabling them to move.

<text>The Kansas City Scouts were a professional ice hockey team in the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1974 to 1976. In 1976, the franchise relocated to Denver and became the Colorado Rockies. In 1982, the Rockies relocated to New Jersey where they have since been known as the New Jersey Devils.

==History==
In 1974, the NHL ended its first significant expansion period, that had started in 1967, by adding teams in Kansas City, Missouri, and Washington, D.C. Kansas City Hockey Associates, led by managing general partner Edwin G. Thompson, originally consisted of 22 investors. It was awarded a franchise on June 8, 1972. Kansas City Hockey Associates was one of four groups that applied for the franchise. Missouri Lt. Governor William Morris (former owner of the Central Hockey League&#x27;s Kansas City Blues), Stan Glazer and Arthur Rhoades headed up the other three potential ownership groups.

Kemper Arena was constructed to host the team&#x27;s home games. Kansas City had been the home of several minor league ice hockey teams through the years. The Scouts shared Kemper Arena with the Kansas City Kings (the Kings were officially the Kansas City–Omaha Kings from 1972 to 1975) of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The arrival of the Scouts and Washington Capitals resulted in the NHL creating four divisions and renaming the conferences, and the Scouts were placed in the Smythe Division of the Campbell Conference with Missouri&#x27;s other NHL franchise, the St. Louis Blues.

The owners of the new Kansas City franchise originally wanted to call their team the &quot;Kansas City Mohawks&quot;, since the Kansas City metropolitan area includes portions of Missouri and Kansas. The name would have combined Missouri&#x27;s postal abbreviation (MO) and the Kansas nickname of &quot;Jayhawkers&quot;. However, the Chicago Black Hawks objected because of the similarity of &quot;Mohawks&quot; to their own name.

The team then held a contest for people to name the new team. The name &quot;Scouts&quot; was chosen, named after &quot;The Scout&quot; which is located in Penn Valley Park and overlooks downtown. The iconic statue was featured on the team&#x27;s logo. The club&#x27;s logo was designed by lettering artist Gary Sartain of Kansas City-based Hallmark Cards in 1973 on a free-lance basis. Sartain&#x27;s daughter, Sheila Snyder, told author Troy Treasure in 2018 her mother indicated Sartain was paid $2,000.

On October 9, 1974, the Scouts took the ice for the first time, at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, and lost 6–2 to the Maple Leafs. Team captain Simon Nolet scored the first-ever goal in team history. To allow construction to be completed on Kemper Arena, the Scouts played their first eight games on the road, where they lost seven and tied one. The Scouts made their home debut on November 2, losing to the Black Hawks 4–3. Chicago&#x27;s Ivan Boldirev scored the first NHL goal at Kemper Arena three minutes into the game. Rookie first-round draft selection Wilf Paiement scored the first Scouts goal. The following day the team&#x27;s first victory came against the Washington Capitals by a score of 5–4 at Capital Centre in Landover, Maryland. Peter McDuffe was the winning goaltender for Kansas City. Like many other expansion teams, the Scouts performed poorly garnering only 41 points with a record of 15–54–11 in their inaugural season, though this would be the better result of their two-season history.

The 1975–76 season started out with some promise. Near the midway point of the season, the team was competing for a playoff spot, with a 3–1 win over the California Golden Seals on December 28, 1975 placing them just one point behind the St. Louis Blues and a playoff position in the weak Smythe Division. However, the Scouts went into free fall for their remaining 44 games. After going winless from December 30 to February 4 (0–14–2), they finally won a game, against the Capitals on February 7, before going 0–21–6 for the rest of the season. The Scouts&#x27; second-half crash left them with a season result of 12–56–12 and 36 points, the worst record in the Scouts/Rockies/Devils franchise&#x27;s history.

The last four games the Scouts ever played took place in Japan. Following the conclusion of the 1975–76 regular season, Kansas City and Washington participated in an exhibition series with the first two games played in Sapporo (site of the 1972 Winter Olympics), the third and fourth in Tokyo at Yoyogi National Gymnasium, site of the swimming and diving competition at the 1964 Summer Olympics. The Capitals won the first three contests. On April 18, 1976, the Scouts defeated Washington 4–2. Thus, Kansas City won its final game but it did not count in the NHL standings. 

In their two seasons, the Scouts went through three coaches – Bep Guidolin, Sid Abel (three-game interim stint), and Eddie Bush. Guidolin resigned during the 1975–76 season following a dispute with management over player personnel.

The team had two captains, Simon Nolet and Guy Charron. Steve Durbano led the league in penalty minutes during the 1975–76 season. The franchise failed to make the playoffs in either season in Kansas City and won only 27 of 160 games, including a 7–66–7 mark away from home.

With the 1972 startup of the rival World Hockey Association (WHA) resulting in a combined 32 teams between the NHL and the WHA, the talent available to stock the new teams in Kansas City and Washington was stretched thin. In their first season, the Capitals set an NHL record for futility, losing 67 of 80 games, and winning only one on the road. The Scouts fared only marginally better (losing 56 games), and the 1974 NHL expansion was widely seen as having been a mistake. Attendance tailed off so much that the National Hockey League Players&#x27; Association (NHLPA) wondered if the Scouts would make payroll.

===Relocation to Denver===
The Scouts suffered from inflated player costs, undercapitalized ownership, an economic downturn in the Midwest, poor performances on the ice and weak attendance. The Scouts averaged just 8,218 per game during their two years in the 17,000-seat Kemper Arena (at a time when the league average was approximately 13,000). The team&#x27;s group of 37 owners, buried in debt, mounted a season-ticket drive to raise more revenue. When only 2,000 more season tickets sold, they concluded that the Scouts were not a viable venture and opted to sell. While the Capitals were far worse on the ice, their owner, Abe Pollin, had the financing and the patience to absorb the typical struggles of a 1970s expansion team.

The Scouts were put up for sale with a Denver-based group led by oilman Jack A. Vickers looking to buy the club. A local group, according to author Troy Treasure, led by Scouts&#x27; limited partners Gene Novorr and George Shore, was also interested but when the NHL informed the Scouts&#x27; owners that they would be on the hook of over a million dollars in expansion and territorial fees (owed the St. Louis Blues) if they did not sell to Vickers, they reluctantly did so on July 26, 1976.

After just two seasons in Kansas City, the club became the Colorado Rockies. They played six NHL seasons in Denver, then relocated to East Rutherford, New Jersey, and became the New Jersey Devils starting in the 1982–83 season.

The last Scouts player on the Rockies&#x27; active roster was goaltender Bill McKenzie, who last played for the franchise on April 4, 1980. The last active Scouts player in the NHL was the Scouts&#x27; first-ever drafted player, Wilf Paiement, who retired in 1988.

The Scouts and the California Golden Seals, who moved to become the Cleveland Barons the same year, were the first NHL teams to relocate since the 1934–35 season.

==Legacy==
Following the departure of the Scouts, Kansas City became a minor league town again, most notably with the Kansas City Blades operating from 1990 to 2001 in the International Hockey League. Kansas City Mavericks of the ECHL play in Independence, east of downtown Kansas City.

To this day, the Devils make almost no mention of their past as the Scouts or Rockies; the Devils&#x27; media guide and the history sections of the Devils&#x27; website do not acknowledge any captains, coaches or general managers prior to the move to New Jersey. However, inside of the Prudential Center, the Devils home rink, there is a mural on the second floor that shows the former arenas of the Rockies and Scouts, along with Devils&#x27; original (1982–2007) New Jersey home, the Brendan Byrne Arena.

For the 2022–23 season, the New Jersey Devils unveiled a new Scouts-themed &quot;Reverse Retro&quot; jersey. The white sweater had red, yellow and blue piping, similar to the uniforms worn in Kansas City, albeit the Scouts logo was replaced with the Devils logo. Additionally, that same season, the Devils celebrated their 40th anniversary. Unlike with prior anniversaries (10th, 20th, 30th), the Devils treated it as &quot;40 years in Jersey&quot;, acknowledging the franchise existed prior to 1982.

In 1974–75, Gene Osborn was the sole television play-by-play announcer, also on KBMA, with analysis provided by Bill Grigsby. KBMA was an independent station distributed in the Midwest via cable television, including the cities of Des Moines, Iowa and Wichita, Kansas.

<doc id="665630" wikidata="Q1360390" url="?curid=665630" title="Gaza Strip smuggling tunnels">
<text>The Gaza Strip smuggling tunnels are smuggling tunnels that had been dug under the Philadelphi Route along the Egypt–Gaza border. They were dug to subvert the blockade of the Gaza Strip to smuggle in fuel, food, weapons and other goods into the Gaza Strip. After the Egypt–Israel peace treaty of 1979, the town of Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, was split by this buffer zone. One part is located in the southern part of Gaza, and the smaller part of the town is in Egypt. After Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, the Philadelphi Corridor was placed under the control of the Palestine Authority until 2007, when Hamas seized power in 2007, and Egypt and Israel closed borders with the Gaza Strip.

In 2009, Egypt began the construction of an underground barrier to block existing tunnels and make new ones harder to dig. In 2011, Egypt relaxed restrictions at its border with the Gaza Strip, allowing Palestinians to cross freely. In 2013–2014, Egypt&#x27;s military destroyed most of the 1,200 smuggling tunnels.

==Background==

The Gaza Strip smuggling tunnels are tunnels across the Gaza–Egypt border, used to bypass the Rafah Border Crossing, which is used for exceptional cases only, when opened at all. The first recorded discovery of a tunnel by Israel was in 1983, after Israel had withdrawn from the Sinai. The border, redrawn in 1982 after the Egypt–Israel peace treaty, divided Rafah into an Egyptian and a Gazan part. The tunnels used to start from the basements of houses in Rafah on the one side of the border and end in houses in Rafah on the other side.

By September 2005, after withdrawing from the Gaza Strip, Israel declared that Palestinians would not have control of their side of the crossing, and the Rafah crossing should be closed. During the rest of the year Egypt opened and closed the crossing intermittently. In November 2005, two agreements between Israel and the Palestinian Authority permitted the reopening of the crossing with third-party European Union assistance. However, the movement of people were very restricted and goods would use the Kerem Shalom crossing, under the supervision of Israelis and monitored by EU monitors. In 2006, the Rafah crossing was opened to June. During the rest of the year it was open during 31 days at random.

In June 2007, Hamas took over the Gaza Strip. Following the takeover, Egypt and Israel largely sealed their border crossings with Gaza, on the grounds that the Palestinian Authority had fled and was no longer providing security on the Palestinian side.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com/&quot;&gt;Isabel Kershner. Abbas’s Premier Tells Israel to Reopen Gaza . New York Times. 14 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Karni and Rafah checkpoints were closed again, resulting in &quot;severe personal and economic hardship for Gaza&#x27;s 1.4 million population&quot;, according to OCHA. Thousands of travelers have been stranded on both sides of the border.

The blockade of the Gaza Strip has caused a shortage of certain basic products, especially construction materials, fuel, some consumer articles, and medicines and medical supplies. Import restrictions, including of basic building materials, have led to the proliferation of tunnels under the border with Egypt. As Israel limits the Palestinian freedom of movement, for most Gazans the tunnels are the only way to move from and to Gaza.

== Use ==
The tunnels were used to smuggle a wide range of goods, including fuel, gas, cement, construction materials, raw materials, pesticides, seeds, agricultural tools, preservatives, packaging material, spare parts, livestock, zoo animals, food, medicines, clothes, car parts, building supplies, weapons and luxury items in general. Initially, the tunnels were used for moving consumer goods and medicines. During the First Intifada (December 1987 to 1993), some, more secret, tunnels were said to be used by militant groups to bring in arms and money.

A 2015 report of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) noted that between 2007 and 2013, more than 1,532 tunnels were running under the border to mitigate the impact of the blockade on Gaza. They were closed by mid-2013. The size of the tunnel trade was even greater than the volume of trade through official channels. The tunnels had been essential to recover from the destructions during the 2008/2009 Gaza War. Based on the materials allowed in by Israel, it would have taken 80 years to rebuild the 6,000 housing units destroyed during the military operation. Due to the tunnel imports, it only took five years. Gaza&#x27;s sole power plant ran on diesel from Egypt brought through the tunnels in the range of 1 million litres per day before
June 2013. In 2015. UNCTAD reported that the end of the tunnel economy highlighted an urgent need for the complete and immediate lifting of Israel&#x27;s blockade on Gaza.

=== Construction materials ===
Israel restricts the importation of construction materials into the strip, to prevent their use for military purposes by Hamas. As a result, concrete and other construction materials were some of the main goods smuggled through the tunnels.

=== Fuel ===
Smuggling fuel through the tunnels has been the primary source of fuel for Gaza&#x27;s only power plant. Electricity is needed for the desalination of drinking water. After Egypt demolished hundreds of tunnels in 2013 and Israel closed the Kerem Shalom Crossing, a shortage in fuel caused the shut down of the power plant.

Increased fuel shortages and high prices, due to the intensified anti-tunnels measures by the Egyptian government under President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, halted the functioning of sewage treatment facilities in Gaza in 2014. Untreated waste water was pumped into the Gaza shore, causing serious environment pollution and swimming prohibition at the beaches.

=== Transport of people ===
Facing the restriction of the Palestinian freedom of movement, an advanced system of human transport has been established, including the issue of tickets which serve as a travel permit. A travel ticket from and to Gaza may cost between $30 and $300 (2012), depending on the provided service. As of 2012, travelling by car was possible. Travelling through the tunnels was popular during Ramadan in 2012. As travelling through the Israeli crossings is only permitted by exception, and the Rafah Crossing is opened for limited periods, if opened at all, the tunnels have often become the only outlet for the strip&#x27;s residents

The tunnels are used as part of a route into Israel by smugglers and terrorists, named the Het route by the Israeli military because of a similar shape to the Hebrew letter Het. The route starts in Gaza, into the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula, then into Israel at a less well guarded part of the border.

===Use of child labor===

According to an article by Nicolas Pelham in the IPS &quot;Journal of Palestine Studies&quot;, child labor is employed in the smuggling tunnels with the justification that children are more &quot;nimble.&quot; Despite calls from human rights groups for the Gaza government to stop the practice, regulation of child labor is lax.

Benjamin Netanyahu used the IPS publication to document his claim that &quot;Hamas puts children to work in terror tunnels, sending them to their death.&quot; The claim was widely used by numerous pro-Israeli media outlets. In a response to Netanyahu, Institute for Palestine Studies recalled that the tunnels were regulated by but largely &quot;not&quot; owned or operated by Hamas, and were a &quot;response to Israel’s imposition of a draconian blockade that drastically controls and at times has banned almost all goods entering the territory, from construction materials, and gasoline, down to such items as pasta.&quot; The response further stated that &quot;Pelham never suggests, as the prime minister seemed to imply in his comments, that children were ever used to build tunnels for military purposes, least of all into Israel&quot;, although &quot;Hamas, as the governing authority in Gaza, did not implement its own directives to prevent the use of child labor&quot;. The Institute corrected an error in the article: There had not been at least 160 children been killed in the tunnels, according to Hamas officials, but rather 160 &quot;persons&quot; as of 2012. IPS noted that more than 541 were children and some 3084 wounded by the Israeli bombing in the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict that was ongoing at the time.

== Construction ==

The tunnels are normally dug by individual contractors from basements of houses or an olive grove under the border at depths of up to 30 meters (100 feet), and reaching up to 800 meters (2640 feet) in length. In many cases, the owners of the houses enter into a business arrangement with the tunnel builders. They may receive a portion of the profits from the smuggling or some other sort of financial compensation from those who contract the tunnel construction. While many tunnels are of a generally high quality of engineering and construction – with some including electricity, ventilation, intercoms, and a rail system – they are still very dangerous and are prone to cave-ins. The openings to many tunnels are found within buildings in or around Gaza&#x27;s southernmost city of Rafah.

==Measures taken against smuggling tunnels==

=== Measures taken by Israel ===
:&quot;See also Gaza War (2008–2009) (IDF &quot;Operation Cast Lead&quot;), March 2012 Gaza–Israel clashes (IDF &quot;Operation Returning Echo&quot;), November 2012 Israeli operation in the Gaza Strip (IDF &quot;Operation Pillar of Defense&quot;), 2014 Gaza War (IDF &quot;Operation Protective Edge&quot;), 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis (IDF &quot;Operation Guardian of the Walls&quot;), Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip (2023–present) (IDF &quot;Operation Swords of Iron&quot;)&quot;

Israel has destroyed hundreds of homes along the Gaza–Egypt border to enlarge the buffer zone, asserting that they were used to hide smugglers&#x27; tunnels. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) maintain that this was done in order to prevent smuggling tunnels, and that incursions into Rafah and the destruction of tunnels and/or shafts under homes was the most effective means to close the tunnels down. An IDF spokeswoman has stated that in destroying tunnels, the IDF exercises &quot;the utmost care to pinpoint the tunnels and do as little damage as possible&quot;.

Israel, Egypt, the United States, and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries have pledged to stop or slow smuggling to Gaza by land and sea. 
Although Israeli air strikes rendered over 100 tunnels inoperative during Operation Pillar of Defense, many of them were restored within a few weeks because the main damage was sustained at the openings, not in the middle sections.

During the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, Israel launched a ground offensive into Gaza with the primary objective being to fully destroy the cross border tunnels. In total 31 tunnels were destroyed during the weeks the IDF was in Gaza.

On 11 August 2014 the IDF announced they had successfully tested a system that could be used to detect these tunnels. This new system uses a combination of sensors and special transmitters to locate tunnels. The IDF expects development to cost up to NIS 1.5 billion, and could be deployed within the year.

=== Measures taken by Egypt ===
Some measures such as Egypt&#x27;s construction of an underground fence along its side of the Gaza–Egypt border have been taken. In late 2009 Egypt started construction of a subterranean barrier in an attempt to curb the use of smuggling tunnels. Nevertheless, anti-smuggling capabilities remain limited and constrained.

In 2010, Egypt sprayed toxic gas into the tunnels, killing four Palestinians.

In 2011, Egypt began sealing a series of smugglers’ tunnels between its border and the Gaza Strip. The Egyptian army has increased its deployment along its border since 5 August 2012, when 16 Egyptian border police were killed in a terror attack. Since then there have been reports that the Egyptian army has been destroying smuggling tunnels by flooding them.

In 2013, following the 2013 Egyptian coup d&#x27;état that ousted the pro-Hamas government, the Egyptian army has destroyed many of the tunnels, with the effect that &quot;prices have soared, shelves are empty, utilities have suspended operations for lack of fuel and travel is restricted once again&quot;.

In 2013, the Egyptian military started resorting to a pungent new tactic to shut down the smuggling tunnels connecting Sinai and Gaza: flooding them with sewage.

Smuggling tunnels and the various methods different countries have used to address the types of threats tunnels pose to national security has been discussed in the literature.

After President el-Sisi assumed leadership of Egypt in 2013, the Egyptian Army launched an aggressive campaign of destroying tunnels between Gaza and Egyptian territory. As of August 2014, the Egyptian Military destroyed 1,659 smuggling tunnels.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas agreed with the destruction of smuggling tunnels, arguing that they had produced 1,800 millionaires, and were used for smuggling weapons, drugs, cash and equipment for forging documents. Abbas had previously recommended the sealing or destruction of the tunnels by flooding them and then punishing the owners of the homes that contained entrances to the tunnels, including demolishing their homes.

On 11 September 2015, the Egyptian army began to pump water from the Mediterranean Sea into the tunnels. A number of Palestinian factions condemned the flooding of the border with sea water, because it posed a serious threat to the environment and ground water. In February 2016, it was reported that the flooding was creating an environmental disaster and having a catastrophic effect on the basic livelihoods of millions of Palestinians.

According to Egyptian President el-Sisi, flooding of the tunnels had been carried out in coordination with the Palestinian Authority. On 6 February 2016, Israeli Minister Yuval Steinitz said that Sisi ordered the flooding of several Hamas tunnels to a certain extent due to Israel&#x27;s request. He affirmed that Egyptian–Israeli security cooperation was &quot;better than ever&quot;.

====Buffer zone====
In October 2014, days after an attack in which 33 Egyptian soldiers were killed, Egypt announced it may create a buffer zone between Palestinian Rafah and Egyptian Rafah, where most tunnels are believed to be. Initial width of the buffer zone was 500 meters but on 18 November 2014, Egypt said it would expand it to 1 km. On 29 December 2014 the buffer zone was extended again to 5 km.

<doc id="665637" wikidata="Q2031359" url="?curid=665637" title="Santa Muerte">
<text>Nuestra Señora de la Santa Muerte (; Spanish for Our Lady of Holy Death), often shortened to Santa Muerte, is a new religious movement, female deity, folk-Catholic saint, and folk saint in Mexican folk Catholicism and Neopaganism. A personification of death, she is associated with healing, protection, and safe delivery to the afterlife by her devotees. Despite condemnation by the Catholic Church and Evangelical pastors, her cult has become increasingly prominent since the turn of the 21st century.

Santa Muerte almost always appears as a female skeletal figure, clad in a long robe and holding one or more objects, usually a scythe and a globe. Her robe can be of any color, as more specific images of the figure vary widely from devotee to devotee and according to the ritual being performed or the petition being made.

Her present day following was first reported in Mexico by American anthropologists in the 1940s and was an occult practice until the early 2000s. Most prayers and other rituals have been traditionally performed privately at home. Since the beginning of the 21st century, worship has become more public, starting in Mexico City after a believer named Enriqueta Romero founded her famous Mexico City shrine in 2001. The number of believers in Santa Muerte has grown over the past two decades, to an estimated 29 million followers who are concentrated in Mexico, Central America, and the United States with a smaller contingent of followers in Canada and Europe. Santa Muerte has two similar male counterparts in Latin America, the skeletal folk saints San La Muerte of Argentina and Paraguay and Rey Pascual of Guatemala and Chiapas, Mexico. According to R. Andrew Chesnut, Ph.D. in Latin American history and professor of religious studies, Santa Muerte is at the center of the single fastest-growing new religious movement in the Americas.

==Names==
&quot;Santa Muerte&quot; can be translated into English as either &quot;Saint Death&quot; or &quot;Holy Death&quot;, although R. Andrew Chesnut, Ph.D. in Latin American history and professor of Religious studies, believes that the former is a more accurate translation because it &quot;better reveals&quot; her identity as a folk saint. A variant of this is &quot;Santísima Muerte&quot;, which is translated as &quot;Most Holy Death&quot; or &quot;Most Saintly Death&quot;, and devotees often call her &quot;Santisma Muerte&quot; during their rituals.

Santa Muerte is also known by a wide variety of other monikers: the Skinny Lady (&quot;La Flaquita&quot; or &quot;La Flaca&quot;), the Bony Lady (&quot;la Huesuda&quot;), the White Girl (&quot;la Niña Blanca&quot;), the White Sister (&quot;la Hermana Blanca&quot;), the Pretty Girl (&quot;la Niña Bonita&quot;), the Powerful Lady (&quot;la Dama Poderosa&quot;), the Godmother (&quot;la Madrina&quot;), &quot;Señora de las Sombras&quot; (&quot;Lady of Shadows&quot;), &quot;Señora Blanca&quot; (&quot;White Lady&quot;), &quot;Señora Negra&quot; (&quot;Black Lady&quot;), &quot;Niña Santa&quot; (&quot;Holy Girl&quot;), &quot;Santa Sebastiana&quot; (&quot;Saint Sebastienne&quot;, i.e. &quot;Holy Sebastian&quot;) or &quot;Doña Bella Sebastiana&quot; (&quot;Beautiful Lady Sebastienne&quot;).

==History==


After the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, the worship of Mictēcacihuātl (or Mictlancihuatl), the skeletal Aztec goddess of death, diminished but was never eradicated. Judith Katia Perdigón Castañeda has found references dating to 18th-century Mexico. According to one account, recorded in the annals of the Spanish Inquisition, Chichimecs in central Mexico tied up a skeletal figure, whom they addressed as &quot;Santa Muerte&quot;, and threatened it with lashings if it did not perform miracles or grant their wishes. Another syncretism between pre-Columbian and Christian beliefs involving death can be seen in Day of the Dead commemorations. During these commemorations, many Mexicans flock to cemeteries to sing and pray for friends and family members who have died. Children partake in the festivities by eating chocolate or candy in the shape of skulls. Perdigón Castañeda, Thompson, Kingsbury, and Chesnut have countered the argument that Santa Muerte&#x27;s origins are not Indigenous proposed by Malvido, Lomnitz, and Kristensen; stating that Santa Muerte&#x27;s origins derive from authentic Indigenous beliefs. For Malvido this stems from Indigenist discourse originating in the 1930s. Nevertheless, ethnoarchaeological research by Kingsbury and Chesnut as well as archival work by Perdigón Castañeda, has established clear links between pre-Columbian death deity worship and Santa Muerte supplication.

In contrast to the Day of the Dead, overt veneration of Santa Muerte remained clandestine until the early 2000s. When it went public in sporadic occurrences, reaction was often harsh, and included the desecration of shrines and altars. At the beginning of the 20th century, José Guadalupe Posada created a similar, but secular, figure by the name of Catrina, a female skeleton dressed in fancy clothing of the period. Posada began to evoke the idea that the universality of death generated a fundamental equality amongst all human beings. His paintings of skeletons in daily life and of La Catrina were meant to represent the arbitrary and violent nature of an unequal society.

Modern artists began to reestablish Posada&#x27;s styles as a national artistic objective to push the limits of upper-class tastes; an example of Posada&#x27;s influence is Diego Rivera&#x27;s mural painting &quot;Dream of a Sunday Afternoon in the Alameda Central&quot;, which features La Catrina. The image of the skeleton and the Day of the Dead ritual that used to be held underground became commercialized and domesticated. The skeletal images became that of folklore, encapsulating Posada&#x27;s viewpoint that death is an equalizer.

Skeletons were clad in extravagant dresses with braids in their hair, altering the image of Posada&#x27;s original La Catrina. As opposed to being the political message Posada intended, the skeletons of equality became skeletal images which were appealing to tourists and the national folkloric Mexican identity.
Veneration of Santa Muerte was documented in the 1940s in working-class neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Tepito. At present, Santa Muerte can be found throughout Mexico and also across the United States and Central America. There are videos, websites, and music composed in honor of this folk saint. The new religious movement of Santa Muerte first came to widespread popular attention in Mexico in August 1998, when police arrested the notorious gangster Daniel Arizmendi López and discovered a shrine to the saint in his home. Widely reported in the press, this discovery inspired the common association between Santa Muerte, violence, and criminality in Mexican popular consciousness.

Since 2001, there has been &quot;meteoric growth&quot; in Santa Muerte belief, largely due to her reputation for performing miracles. She has roughly 12 million adherents, with the great majority of concentrated in Mexico, the US, and Central America. In the late 2000s, the founder of Mexico&#x27;s first Santa Muerte church, David Romo, estimated that there were around 5 million devotees in Mexico, constituting approximately 5% of the country&#x27;s population.

By the late 2000s, Santa Muerte had become Mexico&#x27;s second-most popular saint, after Saint Jude, and had come to rival the country&#x27;s &quot;national patroness&quot;, the Virgin of Guadalupe. The meteoric rise of this new religious movement has engendered considerable controversy. In March 2009 the Mexican army demolished 40 roadside shrines near the U.S. border. , the new religious movement was brought to the United States by Mexican and Central American immigrants, and by 2012 had tens of thousands of followers throughout the country, primarily in cities with large Mexican and Mexican-American populations. , devotion to Santa Muerte is the fastest-growing new religious movement in the world, with an estimated 12 million followers, and the single fastest-growing new religious movement in the Americas. The COVID-19 pandemic saw further growth in the new religious movement as many believed that she would protect them against the virus.

==Attributes and iconography==

Santa Muerte is a personification of death. Unlike other Latin American folk saints, Santa Muerte is not, herself, seen as a dead human being. She is associated with healing, protection, financial wellbeing, and assurance of a path to the afterlife.

Although there are other death saints in Latin America, such as San La Muerte, Santa Muerte is the only female saint of death in the Americas. Iconographically, Santa Muerte is a skeleton dressed in female clothes or a shroud, and carrying both a scythe and a globe. Santa Muerte is distinguished as female not by her skeletal form but rather by her attire and hair. The latter was introduced by a believer named Enriqueta Romero.

The two most common objects that Santa Muerte holds in her hands are a globe and a scythe. Her scythe reflects her origins as the Grim Reaper (&quot;la Parca&quot; of medieval Spain), and can represent the moment of death, when it is said to cut a silver thread. The scythe can symbolize the cutting of negative energies or influences. As a harvesting tool, a scythe may also symbolize hope and prosperity. The scythe has a long handle, indicating that it can reach anywhere. The globe represents Death&#x27;s vast power and dominion over the earth, and may be seen as a kind of a tomb to which we all return.

Other objects associated with Santa Muerte include scales, an hourglass, an owl, and an oil lamp. The scales allude to equity, justice, and impartiality, as well as divine will. An hourglass indicates the time of life on earth and also the belief that death is not the end, as the hourglass can be inverted to start over. The hourglass denotes Santa Muerte&#x27;s relationship with time as well as with the worlds above and below. It also symbolizes patience. An owl symbolizes her ability to navigate the darkness and her wisdom; the owl is also said to act as a messenger. A lamp symbolizes intelligence and spirit, to light the way through the darkness of ignorance and doubt. Owls in particular are associated with Mesoamerican death deities such as Mictlantecuhtli and seen as evidence of continuity of death worship into Santa Muerte. Some followers of Santa Muerte believe that she is jealous and that her image should not be placed next to those of other saints or deities, or there will be consequences.

Many artists, particularly Mexican-American artists, have worked with Santa Muerte&#x27;s image. One of the images considered to be the most controversial in Mexico is the fusion of Santa Muerte and the Virgin of Guadalupe, into what is sometimes known as GuadaMuerte. This image has been very polemical for many Mexicans as it features Santa Muerte dressed like the Virgin of Guadalupe, in blue veil with stars on it, red dress, with a fiery yellow halo behind her head and often in a praying pose. It has, according to news sources, been so upsetting to the Catholic Church that Santa Muerte leaders in Mexico have advised against its use, while in the Santa Muerte community some leaders and devotees are angered that their powerful, formidable folk saint would be conflated with a completely separate entity, the Virgin of Guadalupe, as the practices are different on many levels.

==Veneration==

===Rituals associated with Santa Muerte===
Rituals dedicated to Santa Muerte include processions and prayers with the aim of having a miracle granted. Some believers of Santa Muerte remain members of the Catholic Church, while others are cutting ties with the Catholic Church and founding independent Santa Muerte churches and temples. Santa Muerte altars generally contain one or multiple images of the saint, generally surrounded by any or all of the following: cigarettes, flowers, fruit, incense, water, alcoholic beverages, coins, candies and candles. Tobacco is also used for personal cleansing and for cleansing statues of Santa Muerte.

According to popular belief, Santa Muerte is very powerful and is reputed to grant many miracles. Her images are treated as holy and can grant miracles in return for the faith of the believer. As &quot;Señora de la Noche&quot; (&quot;Lady of the Night&quot;), she is often invoked by those exposed to the dangers of working at night, such as taxi drivers, bar owners, police, soldiers, and sex workers. As such, devotees believe she can protect against assaults, accidents, gun violence, and all types of violent death.

Her effigies are dressed differently depending on what is being requested. Usually, her vestments are differently colored robes, but it is also common for the effigies to be dressed as a bride (for those seeking a husband) or in European medieval nun&#x27;s garments similar to female Catholic saints. The colors of Santa Muerte&#x27;s votive candles and vestments are associated with the type of petitions made.

White is the most common color and symbolizes gratitude, purity, or the cleansing of negative influences. Red is for love, lust and passion. It can also signify emotional stability. The color gold signifies economic power, success, money, and prosperity. Green symbolizes justice, legal matters, or unity with loved ones. Amber or dark yellow indicates health. Images with this color can be seen in rehabilitation centers, especially those for drug addiction and alcoholism. Black represents total protection against black magic or sorcery, or conversely negative magic or for force directed against rivals and enemies. Blue candles and images of the saint indicate wisdom, which is favored by students and those in education. Brown is used to invoke spirits from beyond while purple, like yellow, usually symbolizes health. More recently black, purple, yellow and white candles have been used by devotees to supplicate Santa Muerte for healing of and protection from coronavirus as documented by Kingsbury and Chesnut, the leading researchers on Santa Muerte. 
Other more recent colors include silver, transparent and red with black gown Santa Muerte which are used for particular petitions.

Devotees may present her with a polychrome seven-color candle, which Chesnut believed was adopted from the seven powers candle of Santería, a syncretic Afro-Cuban faith brought to Mexico by Cuban migrants. Here the seven colors are gold, silver, copper, blue, purple, red, and green. In addition to the candles and vestments, each devotee adorns their own image in their own way, using U.S. dollars, gold coins, jewelry, and other items.

Santa Muerte has no official annual feast day but November 2, Day of the Dead, appears to be becoming the favored date. Many larger shrines and temples hold annual celebrations on the date of their founding. The most prominent is November 1, when the believer Enriqueta Romero celebrates her at her historic Tepito shrine where the famous effigy is dressed as a bride. Others celebrate her day on August 15.

===Places of worship===

According to Chesnut, the new religious movement of Santa Muerte is &quot;generally informal and unorganized&quot;. Since worship of this folk saint has been, and to a large extent still is, clandestine, most rituals are performed at altars in the homes of devotees. Recently public shrines have been mushrooming across Mexico. The one on Dr. Vertiz Street in Colonia Doctores is unique in Mexico City because it features statues of Jesús Malverde and Saint Jude along with Santa Muerte. Another public shrine is in a small park on Matamoros Street very close to Paseo de la Reforma.

Shrines can also be found in the back of all kinds of stores and gas stations. As veneration of Santa Muerte becomes more accepted, stores specializing in religious articles, such as botánicas, are carrying more and more paraphernalia related to her worship. Historian R. Andrew Chesnut has discovered that many botanicas in both Mexico and the U.S. are kept in business by sales of Santa Muerte paraphernalia, with numerous shops earning up to half of their profits on Santa Muerte items. This is true even of stores in very well known locations such as Pasaje Catedral behind the Mexico City Cathedral, which is mostly dedicated to stores selling Catholic liturgical items. Her image is a staple in esoterica shops.

There are those who now call themselves Santa Muerte priests or priestesses, such as Jackeline Rodríguez in Monterrey. She maintains a shop in Mercado Juárez in Monterrey, where tarot readers, curanderos, herbal healers, and sorcerers can also be found.

====Shrine of the Most Holy Death====

The establishment of the first public shrine to the image began to change how Santa Muerte was venerated. The veneration has grown rapidly since then, and others have put their images on public display, as well.
In 2001, Enriqueta Romero built a shrine for a life-sized statue of Santa Muerte in her home in Mexico City, visible from the street. The shrine does not hold Catholic masses or occult rites, but people come here to pray and to leave offerings to the image. The effigy is dressed in garbs of different colors depending on the season, with the Romero family changing the dress every first Monday of the month. This statue of the saint features large quantities of jewelry on her neck and arms, which are pinned to her clothing. It is surrounded by offerings left to it, including: flowers, fruits (especially apples), candles, toys, money, notes of thanks for prayers granted, cigarettes, and alcoholic beverages that surround it.

Enriqueta Romero considers herself the chaplain of the shrine, a role she says she inherited from her aunt, who began the practice in the family in 1962. The shrine is located on 12 Alfarería Street in Tepito, Colonia Morelos. For many, this Santa Muerte is the patron saint of Tepito. The house also contains a shop that sells amulets, bracelets, medallions, books, images, and other items; the most popular item sold there is votive candles.

On the first day of every month Enriqueta Romero or one of her assistants lead prayers and the recitation of the Santa Muerte rosary, which lasts for about an hour and is based on the Catholic rosary. On the first of November the anniversary of the Tepito Santa Muerte shrine erected by Enriqueta Romero is celebrated. This Santa Muerte is dressed as a bride and wears hundreds of pieces of gold jewelry given by the faithful to show gratitude for miracles granted, or to ask for one.

The celebration officially begins at the stroke of midnight of November 1. Thousands of faithful turn out to pray the rosary. For purification, marijuana smoke is used instead of incense, which is traditionally used for purification by Catholics. Food such as cake, chicken with mole, hot chocolate, coffee, and atole are served during the celebrations, which features performances by mariachis and marimba bands.

===Votive candles===

Santa Muerte is a multifaceted saint, with various symbolic meanings and her devotees can call upon her for a wide range of reasons. In herbal shops and markets one can find a plethora of Santa Muerte paraphernalia like the votive candles that have her image on the front and in a color representative of its purpose. On the back of the candles are prayers associated with the color&#x27;s meaning and may sometimes come with additional prayer cards. Color symbolism is central to devotion and ritual. There are three main colors associated with Santa Muerte: red, white, and black.

The candles are placed on altars and devotees turn to specific colored candles depending on their circumstance. Some keep the full range of colored candles while others focus on one aspect of Santa Muerte&#x27;s spirit. Santa Muerte is called upon for matters of the heart, health, money, wisdom, and justice. There is the brown candle of wisdom, the white candle of gratitude and consecration, the black candle for protection and vengeance, the red candle of love, lust and passion, the gold candle for monetary affairs, the green candle for crime and justice, the purple candle for healing.

The black votive candle is lit for prayer in order to invoke &quot;La Flaca&#x27;s&quot; protection and vengeance. It is associated with &quot;black magic&quot; and witchcraft. It is not regularly seen at devotional sites, and is usually kept and lit in the privacy of one&#x27;s home. To avert from calling upon official Catholic saints for illegal purposes, some drug traffickers will light Santa Muerte&#x27;s black candle to ensure protection of shipments of drugs across the border. Nevertheless, black candles may also be used for more benign activities such as reversing spells, as well as all forms of protection and removing energetic blockages.

Black candles are presented to Santa Muerte&#x27;s altars that drug traffickers used to ensure protection from violence of rival gangs as well as ensure harm to their enemies in gangs and law enforcement. As the drug war in Mexico has escalated, Santa Muerte&#x27;s veneration by drug bosses has increased and her image is seen again and again in various drug safe houses. Ironically, the military and police officers that are employed to dismantle the White Lady&#x27;s shrines make up a large portion of her devotees. Furthermore, even though her presence in the drug world is becoming routine, the sale of black candles pales in comparison to top selling white, red, and gold candles.

One of Santa Muerte&#x27;s more popular uses is in matters of the heart. The red candle that symbolizes love, lust, and passion is helpful in various situations having to do with love. Her initial main purpose was in love magic during the colonial era in Mexico, which derived from the love magic being brought over from Spain. The Spanish Grim Reapress fused with the indigenous conceptualizations of death are at the root of &quot;La Flaca&#x27;s&quot; existence, in so that the use of love magic in Europe and that of pre-Columbian times that was also merging during colonization may have established the saint as a supernatural love doctor.

The majority of anthropological references to Santa Muerte between the 1940s and 1980s cite her roles as a lover sorceress. The candle can be lit for Santa Muerte to attract a certain lover and ensure their love. In contrast though, the red candle can be prayed to for help in ending a bad relationship in order to start another one. These love miracles require specific rituals to increase their love doctors&#x27; power. The rituals require several ingredients including red roses and rose water for passion, binding stick to unite the lovers, cinnamon for prosperity, and several others depending on the specific ritual.

==In the United States==

The new religious movement of Santa Muerte was established in the United States , brought to the country by Mexican and Central American immigrants. American scholar of religious studies Andrew Chesnut suggests that there were tens of thousands of devotees in the U.S. by 2012. Devotion to Santa Muerte is primarily visible in cities with large Mexican and Mexican-American populations, such as New York City, Chicago, Houston, San Antonio, Tucson, and Los Angeles. There are fifteen religious groups dedicated to her in Los Angeles alone, which include the Temple of Santa Muerte on Melrose Avenue in East Hollywood.

In many places across the US her popularity has spread beyond Hispanic communities. For instance, the Santisima Muerte Chapel of Perpetual Pilgrimage is maintained by a woman of Danish descent, while the New Orleans Chapel of the Santisima Muerte was founded in 2012 by a Non-Hispanic White devotee.

As in Mexico, some elements of the Catholic Church in the United States are trying to combat Santa Muerte worship, especially in Texas, New Mexico, and Chicago particularly. Compared to the Catholic Church in Mexico, the official reaction in the U.S. is muted. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has not issued an official position on this, the fastest growing new religious movement in the country and in the entire world. Opposition to the veneration of Santa Muerte took a violent turn in late January, 2013, when one or more vandals smashed a statue of the folk saint, which had appeared in the San Benito, Texas, municipal cemetery earlier that month.

==Sociology==

The new religious movement of Santa Muerte is present in all social classes of Mexican society, although the majority of devotees are either underemployed workers or from the urban working class. Most are young people, in their teens, twenties, or thirties, and are also mostly female.
A large following developed among Mexicans who are disillusioned with the dominant, institutional Catholic Church and, in particular, with the inability of established Catholic saints to deliver them from poverty and violence.

Devotion is based mostly among people with scarce resources, excluded from the formal market economy, as well as the judicial and educational systems, primarily in the inner cities and the very rural areas. Devotion to Santa Muerte is viewed as a &quot;cult of crisis&quot; by some scholars. Devotion to the skeleton saint has expanded rapidly during economic and social hardships, which tend to affect the working classes more. Santa Muerte tends to attract those in extremely difficult or hopeless situations but also appeals to smaller sectors of middle class professionals and even the affluent. Some of her most devoted followers are those who commit petty crimes, often committed out of desperation, such as sex workers and petty thieves.

The worship of Santa Muerte also attracts those who are not inclined to seek the traditional Catholic Church for spiritual solace, as it is part of the Mexican establishment; many followers of Santa Muerte live on the margins of the law or outside it entirely. Many street vendors, taxi drivers, vendors of counterfeit merchandise, street people, sex workers, pickpockets, drug traffickers, and gang members who follow the Mexican folk saint are not practicing Catholics or Protestants.

In essence they have created their own new religious movement that reflects their realities, hardships, identity, and practices, especially since it speaks to the violence and struggles for life that many of these people face. Conversely, both police forces and the military in Mexico can be counted among the faithful who ask for blessings on their weapons and ammunition.

While worship is largely based in poor neighborhoods, Santa Muerte is also venerated in affluent areas such as Mexico City&#x27;s Condesa and Coyoacán districts. However, negative media coverage of the worship and condemnation by the Catholic Church in Mexico and certain Protestant denominations have influenced public perception of the cult of Santa Muerte. With the exception of some artists and politicians, some of whom perform rituals secretly, those in higher socioeconomic strata look upon the veneration with distaste as a form of superstition.

===Association with the LGBTQ+ community===
Santa Muerte is also revered and seen as a saint and protector of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) communities in Mexico, since LGBTQ+ people are considered and treated as outcasts by the Catholic Church, evangelical churches, and Mexican society at large. Many LGBTQ+ people ask her for protection from violence, hatred, disease, and to help them in their search for love. Her intercession is commonly invoked in same-sex marriage ceremonies performed in Mexico. The now defunct Iglesia Católica Tradicional México-Estados Unidos, also known as the Church of Santa Muerte, recognized gay marriage and performed religious wedding ceremonies for homosexual couples.

===Association with criminality===

In the Mexican and U.S. press, devotion to Santa Muerte is often associated with violence, criminality, and the illegal drug trade. She is a popular religious figure in prisons, both among inmates and staff, and shrines dedicated to her can be found in many cells.

Altars with images of Santa Muerte have been found in many drug safe houses in both Mexico and the United States. Among Santa Muerte&#x27;s more infamous devotees are kidnapper Daniel Arizmendi López, known as &quot;El Mochaorejas&quot;, and Gilberto García Mena, one of the bosses of the Gulf Cartel. In March 2012, the Sonora State Investigative Police announced that they had arrested eight people for murder for allegedly having performed a human sacrifice of a woman and two ten-year-old boys to Santa Muerte.

In December 2010, the self-proclaimed Santa Muerte bishop David Romo was arrested on charges of managing funds of a kidnapping gang linked to a cartel. He continues to lead his church from his prison cell. Drug lords, like that of La Familia Michoacana cartel, take advantage of &quot;gangster foot soldiers&#x27;&quot; vulnerability and enforced religious obedience to establish a sacred meaning to their cause that would keep their soldiers disciplined.

==Opposition and persecution==

Since the mid-20th century and throughout the 21st century, the new religious movement of Santa Muerte and her devotees have been regularly discriminated, ostracized, and socially excluded both by the Catholic Church and various evangelical-Pentecostal Protestant churches in Mexico and the rest of Central America.

The Catholic Church has condemned devotion to Santa Muerte in Mexico and Latin America as blasphemous and satanic, calling it a &quot;degeneration of religion&quot;. When Pope Francis visited Mexico in 2016, he repudiated Santa Muerte on his first full day in the country, condemning Santa Muerte as a dangerous symbol of narco-culture; Santa Muerte has been described as a narco-saint.

Latin American Protestant churches have condemned it too, as black magic and trickery. Mexico&#x27;s Catholic Church has accused Santa Muerte devotees—many of whom were baptized in the Catholic religion despite the difference of belief and the fact that Santa Muerte churches and temples have instituted a separate baptism practice—of having turned to devil-worship.

Catholic priests regularly chastise parishioners, telling them that death is not a person but rather a phase of life. However, the Church stops short of labeling such followers as heretics, instead accusing them of heterodoxy. Other reasons the Mexican Catholic Church has officially condemned the worship of Santa Muerte is that most of her rites are modeled after Catholic liturgy, and some Santa Muerte devotees eventually split from the Catholic Church and began vying for control of church buildings.

Despite the many attempts by the Catholic Church and Protestant churches to undermine the devotion to Santa Muerte in Mexico and elsewhere, along with the religious discrimination and accusations towards her followers, the new religious movement of Santa Muerte has enjoyed meteoric growth and spread across the American continent since the early 2000s, and is considered by one of the leading academic experts, Andrew Chesnut, to be the single fastest-growing new religious movement in the world.
