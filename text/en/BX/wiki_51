<text>Young Guns is a 1988 American Western action film directed and produced by Christopher Cain and written by John Fusco. The film dramatizes the adventures of Billy the Kid during the Lincoln County War, which took place in New Mexico in 1877–78. It stars Emilio Estevez as Billy, and Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, Charlie Sheen, Dermot Mulroney, and Casey Siemaszko as the other Lincoln County Regulators. The supporting cast features Terence Stamp, Terry O&#x27;Quinn, Brian Keith, and Jack Palance.

The first film to be produced by Morgan Creek Productions, &quot;Young Guns&quot; opened at number one at the US box office and eventually grossed $56 million against an $11-million budget. Because of the film’s cast, it is often associated with the &quot;Brat Pack&quot; set of 1980s actors. Historian Paul Hutton called &quot;Young Guns&quot; the most historically accurate of all Billy the Kid films as of June 1990.

A sequel, &quot;Young Guns II&quot;, was released in August 1990, with the principal cast reprising their roles.

==Plot==
In 1870s Lincoln County, New Mexico, English cattleman John Tunstall hires a wayward young gunman named William “Billy the Kid” Bonney to join the &quot;Regulators&quot; who lived and worked on his ranch: Doc Scurlock, Jose Chavez y Chavez, Dick Brewer, &quot;Dirty&quot; Steve Stephens, and Charlie Bowdre. Tunstall tries to educate and civilize the young men in his employ, and clashed with rival rancher Lawrence Murphy, a well-connected Irishman in league with the corrupt House.

One of Murphy&#x27;s hired hands, McCloskey, joins up with Tunstall, while Doc attempts to court Murphy&#x27;s Chinese ward, Yen Sun. As New Year&#x27;s Day started, Murphy&#x27;s men kill Tunstall, leading his lawyer friend Alexander McSween to arrange for the Regulators to be deputized and given warrants for the killers&#x27; arrest. Hotheaded Billy challenges Dick&#x27;s authority as the group&#x27;s foreman, as the Regulators attempt to take Murphy&#x27;s henchmen in alive. Instead, Billy gunned down several unarmed men, including McCloskey, whom he suspected of feeding Murphy information. Newspapers paint the Regulators as a deadly gang headed by a larger-than-life outlaw, &quot;Billy the Kid&quot;.

With bounty hunters seeking them all over the West and unsure where to go, Chavez leads the others on a peyote trip. One of the men on their warrants, Buckshot Roberts, tracks them down and a shootout ensues. Roberts barricades himself in an outhouse and kills Dick, and as a reaction, the rest of the Regulators shoot up the outhouse, leaving Buckshot&#x27;s fate unknown. This leads the others to go on the run, while an injured Doc goes his own way. Chavez reveals that Murphy&#x27;s corruption led to the brutal murders of his mother and her Navajo tribe, and urged the others to abandon their need for bloodshed, but Billy takes charge as their new leader, determined to avenge Tunstall.

Doc visits Yen Sun before rejoining the gang, and they kill the corrupt Sheriff William J. Brady and his men. They meet with a furious Alex, who explains that their badges have been revoked. Though they are now wanted men, Billy insists that their actions will bring attention to Murphy&#x27;s corruption. While Charlie revisits a brothel, Billy kills an arrogant bounty hunter at a cantina, and the gang flees to Mexico, where Charlie marries a local woman. Soon-to-be-sheriff Pat Garrett warns Billy that Murphy&#x27;s men will make an attempt on Alex&#x27;s life the following day.

At Alex&#x27;s house in Lincoln, the gang is surrounded by Murphy&#x27;s men and famed outlaw John Kinney. Realizing that they were lured into a trap, the Regulators survive an entire day&#x27;s shootout. U.S. Army troops on the Houses take arrive, as does Murphy himself with Yen, who runs inside and is reunited with Doc. Murphy orders the soldiers to set fire to the house, while Alex&#x27;s wife leaves unharmed and Chavez slips away. Trapped in the burning attic, the gang throws Alex&#x27;s possessions out of the window, including a trunk with Billy inside, allowing him to surprise their attackers.

In the chaos, Chavez returns with their rescued horses, and Charlie and Kinney shoot each other dead. Doc and Yen ride away, and Steve gets a wounded Chavez onto the remaining horse to ride away at the cost of being gunned down himself. Alex is gunned down by a Gatling gun, and Billy escapes after shooting Murphy between the eyes. An epilogue from Doc reveals that Chavez took work at a farm in California, Doc moved east and married Yen Sun, Alex&#x27;s widow became one of the most prominent cattlewomen of all time, and Murphy&#x27;s ring of corruption collapsed. Billy continued to ride until he was killed by Garrett and buried next to Charlie at Fort Sumner, where someone later carved the epitaph: &quot;PALS&quot;.

==Cast==
In addition, Tom Cruise briefly appears in a nonspeaking cameo role as one of Murphy&#x27;s henchmen that is shot and killed by Charlie during the climatic shootout. Cruise made the appearance while visiting friends on the set. Country musician Randy Travis has a cameo as a Gatling gunner.

==Production==
Screenwriter John Fusco developed an interest in Billy the Kid and the Lincoln County War while living in the American Southwest in the 1970s. He spent five months in New Mexico researching the incident and Billy’s life. He first met director Christopher Cain on while working as a script doctor on his film &quot;The Principal&quot;. Cain committed to the project after reading just sixteen pages of Fusco’s first draft, and suggested Emilio Estevez for the leading role, following their collaboration on &quot;That Was Then... This Is Now&quot;.

Filming took place mainly on-location in Santa Fe County, New Mexico. The town of Los Cerrillos was redressed to look like an 1870s Lincoln County. Additional filming took place in Arizona.

=== Music ===
James Horner, whom director Cain had previously worked with on &quot;The Stone Boy&quot; (1984) and &quot;Where the River Runs Black&quot; (1986), was originally hired as the film&#x27;s composer. His score was rejected however, and was replaced by a new score composed by Brian Banks and Anthony Marinelli shortly before release. Some early promotional materials still list Horner as the composer.

== Historical accuracy ==
The movie was deemed closer to history in some ways than earlier cinematic incarnations of the Lincoln County War. New Mexico historian Paul Andrew Hutton called &quot;Young Guns&quot; the most historically accurate of all Billy the Kid films as of June 1990.

The relationship between Tunstall and Murphy was particularly close to the historical reality (as it was in &quot;Chisum&quot;). The killings of Hill and McCloskey are also particularly close to the historical record as well. The portrayals of Josiah Gordon &quot;Doc&quot; Scurlock, Jose Chavez y Chavez, Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Brewer, and Charlie Bowdre, all of whom are not in earlier cinematic versions of the story are praised, whereas the absence of John Chisum is noticeable (though the character does appear in the sequel).

Artistic licenses include the age of John Tunstall, who was 24-years old at death, but is played by then-49-year old Terence Stamp and is depicted as a father figure to the Regulators, when in fact he was only six years older than Billy. Doc Scurlock&#x27;s romance with Yen Sun is completely fictional; the real Scurlock was married to a Hispanic woman named María Antonia Miguela Herrera before the Lincoln County War started, and Murphy was not known to have a Chinese mistress.

The climactic siege at Alexander McSween&#x27;s property is truncated for the film; the real event lasted five days while the film only shows two days. Lawrence Murphy is shown killed by Billy during the siege, when in fact he was not present for the battle, and died of cancer several months later.

The film cuts down the number of Regulators from the historical eleven to six. The AFI Catalog notes that characteristics of Regulators John Middleton and Yginio Salazar are absorbed into the film’s depictions of Stephens and Chavez.

==Release==
===Home media===
The film was released on VHS by Vestron Home Video on January 4, 1989, and on DVD on March 17, 1998 by Artisan Home Entertainment.
This film was released on UMD for PlayStation Portable on October 10, 2005 .
On December 5, 2023, Lionsgate Home Video released the film in 4K in a standard edition as well as a Best Buy exclusive Steelbook. Both the standard and Steelbook releases contain two discs: the 4K Blu-ray, along with a remastered in 4K 1080p Blu-ray.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The movie was a box-office hit, and grossed $45.7 million in the US and Canada. Internationally it grossed $11 million for a worldwide total of $56 million.

===Critical response===
The film received mixed reviews from critics. It holds a 43% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 40 reviews, with an average rating of 4.7/10 with the consensus: &quot;&quot;Young Guns&quot; rounds up a posse of attractive young leads, but this cheerfully shallow Brat Pack western ultimately has too much hat and not enough cattle.&quot; Metacritic gave the film a score of 50 based on 13 people, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A-&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

==Sequel==
A sequel, titled &quot;Young Guns II&quot;, was released in 1990. The film focuses on Billy and the surviving Regulators time as outlaws between 1879 and his reported death in 1881. Principal cast members Estevez, Sutherland, and Phillips returned, as did writer John Fusco. William Petersen replaced Patrick Wayne as Pat Garrett. Other new cast members include Christian Slater, Alan Ruck, and James Coburn.

<text>Luo Yan (; born 1956, September 6th (age 67 ) is a Chinese American actress and screenwriter. She was born in Urumqi, Xinjiang. After having a successful acting career in China, she came to the U.S. in the mid-1980s. She started her own business during the early 1990s and later became the first female Chinese filmmaker to produce, write, and star in a Hollywood film.

Both her parents were biology professors. She was raised by her grandparents in Shanghai. When she was 10 years old, her grandfather was arrested and held in concentration camps. He died shortly after his release and Yan Luo had to take responsibility and care for her ailing grandmother at a very young age.

While working at the Shanghai Textile Factory, she secretly took acting classes and became an active member of a local theater group. In 1977, she applied to the Shanghai Drama Institute and was one of only 20 to be accepted in her class.

Her break through in China came with the movie &quot;Female Student Dormitory&quot; in 1984. She then starred in &quot;The Girl in Red&quot;.
 (actor)|
Starting in 1986, Yan Luo studied English with the hopes of receiving a scholarship to study outside of China. Six months later she received one to study at Boston University.

After working as a waitress, cleaning lady, baby sitter, and housekeeper during her time in Boston, she earned her master&#x27;s degree in fine arts in 1990.

She then interned with the Los Angeles Theater Center and continued taking classes at UCLA, mainly focusing on film production.

In 1994, Yan Luo founded Moonstone International, an import-export company. Today the company reports annual sales of over $4 million and employs more than 20.

In 1996 she started to work on &quot;Pavilion of Women&quot;, a movie after the novel by Pearl S. Buck. In 1997 she decided to co-write the script and started production in 1999.

<doc id="673711" wikidata="Q1565561" url="?curid=673711" title="Verneshot">
<text>A verneshot (named after French author Jules Verne) is a hypothetical volcanic eruption event caused by the buildup of gas deep underneath a craton. Such an event may be forceful enough to launch an extreme amount of material from the crust and mantle into a sub-orbital trajectory, leading to significant further damage after the material crashes back down to the surface.

== Connection with mass extinctions ==

Verneshots have been proposed as a causal mechanism explaining the statistically unlikely contemporaneous occurrence of continental flood basalts, mass extinctions, and &quot;impact signals&quot; (such as planar deformation features, shocked quartz, and iridium anomalies) traditionally considered definitive evidence of hypervelocity impact events.

The verneshot theory suggests that mantle plumes may cause heating and the buildup of carbon dioxide gas underneath continental lithosphere. If continental rifting occurs above this location, an explosive release of the built up gas may occur, potentially sending out a column of crust and mantle into a globally dispersive, super-stratospheric trajectory. It is unclear whether such a column could stay coherent through this process, or whether the force of this process would result in it shattering into much smaller pieces before impacting. The pipe through which the magma and gas had travelled would collapse during this process, sending a shockwave at hypersonic velocity that would deform the surrounding craton.

A verneshot event is likely to be related to nearby continental flood basalt events, which may occur before, during or after the verneshot event. This may help in searching for evidence for the results of verneshot events; however, it is also quite probable that most of such evidence will be buried underneath the basalt flows, making investigation difficult. J. Phipps Morgan and others have suggested that subcircular Bouguer gravity anomalies recognized beneath the Deccan Traps may indicate the presence of verneshot pipes related to the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.

If the Deccan Traps were the location of a verneshot event at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary, the strong iridium spike at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary could be explained by the iridium-rich nature of volatiles in the Reunion mantle plume, which is currently beneath Piton de la Fournaise, but during the end Cretaceous was located beneath India in the area of the Deccan Traps; the verneshot event could potentially distribute the iridium globally.

== Tunguska event ==
A verneshot has been proposed as an alternate explanation for the Tunguska event, widely regarded as the result of an atmospheric explosion of a small comet or asteroid. Arguments offered for this mechanism include the lack of extraterrestrial material at the event site, the lack of a credible impact structure, and the presence of shocked quartz in surface outcrops. However, this hypothesis has not been generally accepted, with Mark Boslough arguing that there is no basis for rejecting the impact hypothesis.

== Name ==

In 1865 Jules Verne&#x27;s novel &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; introduced the concept of a ballistic projectile escaping the Earth&#x27;s gravity, from which Phipps Morgan and others derived the name &quot;Verneshot&quot; in their paper theorizing a connection between extinction events and cratonic gas ejection.

<text>Northern Virginia, locally referred to as NOVA or NoVA, comprises several counties and independent cities in the Commonwealth of Virginia in the United States. The region radiates westward and southward from Washington, D.C., the nation&#x27;s capital, and has a population of 3,257,133 people as of 2023 U.S. Census Bureau estimates, representing over a third of the state&#x27;s total population. It is the most populous region in both Virginia and the regional Washington metropolitan area.

Communities in the region form the Virginia portion of the Washington metropolitan area and the larger Washington–Baltimore metropolitan area. Northern Virginia has a significantly larger job base than either Washington, D.C. or the Maryland portion of its suburbs, and is the highest-income region of Virginia, with several of the highest-income counties in the nation, including three of the ten highest counties for median household income, according to the 2019 American Community Survey.

Northern Virginia&#x27;s transportation infrastructure includes two major airports, Ronald Reagan Washington National and Dulles International Airport, several lines of the Washington Metro subway system, the Virginia Railway Express suburban commuter rail system, transit bus services, bicycle sharing and bicycle lanes and trails, and an extensive network of Interstate highways and expressways.

The Pentagon, the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense and the world&#x27;s second-largest office, is located in Arlington County in Northern Virginia. Northern Virginia also houses the George Bush Center for Intelligence, the headquarters for the Central Intelligence Agency in Langley, the United States Patent and Trademark Office in Alexandria, and several large companies, including several major aerospace manufacturing, consulting firms, and defense industry, which serve it and other components of the U.S. federal government. 

Tourist attractions in Northern Virginia include various memorials, museums, and Colonial and Civil War–era sites, including Arlington National Cemetery, Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park, Manassas National Battlefield Park, Mount Vernon, the National Museum of the Marine Corps, the National Museum of the United States Army, the Udvar-Hazy Center of the National Air and Space Museum, and the United States Marine Corps War Memorial. Other attractions include portions of the Appalachian Trail, Great Falls Park, Old Town Alexandria, Prince William Forest Park, and portions of Shenandoah National Park.

==Etymology==

The region is sometimes spelled &quot;northern Virginia&quot;, but the U.S. Geological Survey&#x27;s &quot;Correspondence Handbook&quot; states that the &#x27;n&#x27; in Northern Virginia should be capitalized since it is a place name rather than a direction or general area.

The name &quot;Northern Virginia&quot; does not seem to have been used in the early history of the area. According to Johnston, some early documents and land grants refer to the &quot;Northern Neck of Virginia&quot;, a reference to the Northern Neck and describing an area that began at the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay and includes a territory that extended west, including all the land between the Potomac and Rappahannock rivers, with a western boundary called the Fairfax line. The Fairfax line, surveyed in 1746, ran from the first spring of the Potomac River, which remains marked today by the Fairfax Stone, to the first spring of the Rappahannock River, at the head of the Conway River. The Northern Neck was composed of , and was larger in area than five of the modern U.S. states:

Early development of the northern portion of Virginia was in the easternmost area of that early land grant, which encompasses the modern counties of Lancaster, Northumberland, Richmond, and Westmoreland. At some point, these eastern counties came to be called separately simply &quot;the Northern Neck&quot;, and, for the remaining area west of them, the term was no longer used. By some definitions, King George County is also included in the Northern Neck, which is now considered a separate region from Northern Virginia.

One of the most prominent early mentions of &quot;Northern Virginia&quot; as a title was the naming of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia during the American Civil War (1861–1865).

===Definition===

The most common definition of Northern Virginia includes the independent cities and counties on the Virginia side of the Washington-Baltimore-Arlington, DC-MD-VA-WV-PA Combined Statistical Area as defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget within the Executive Office of the President of the United States.

Northern Virginia includes six counties, Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun, Prince William, Spotsylvania and Stafford counties, and six independent cities, Alexandria, Fairfax, Falls Church, Fredericksburg, Manassas, and Manassas Park.

==History==
===Colonial period===

The Colony of Virginia was settled at Jamestown in 1607. The area now generally regarded as &quot;Northern Virginia&quot; was within a larger area defined by a land grant from King Charles II of England on September 18, 1649, while the monarch was in exile in France during the English Civil War. Eight of his loyal supporters were named, among them Thomas Culpeper.

On February 25, 1673, a new charter was given to Thomas Lord Culpeper and Henry Earl of Arlington. Lord Culpeper was named the Royal Governor of Virginia from 1677 to 1683. Culpeper County was later named for him when it was formed in 1749; however, history does not seem to record him as one of the better of Virginia&#x27;s colonial governors. Although he became governor of Virginia in July 1677, he did not come to Virginia until 1679, and even then seemed more interested in maintaining his land in the &quot;Northern Neck of Virginia&quot; than governing. He soon returned to England. 

In 1682, rioting in the colony forced Culpeper to return. By the time he arrived, however, the riots were already quelled. After apparently misappropriating £9,500 from the treasury of the colony, he returned to England and the King was forced to dismiss him. During this tumultuous time, Culpeper&#x27;s erratic behavior meant that he had to rely increasingly on his cousin and Virginia agent, Col. Nicholas Spencer. Spencer succeeded Culpeper as acting Governor following Culpeper&#x27;s departure. Culpeper&#x27;s descendants allowed Robert &quot;King&quot; Carter and other Virginians to manage the properties.

In 1736, legal claim to the land was finally established by Culpeper&#x27;s grandson, Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron, who became known in the colony as &quot;Lord Fairfax&quot;, following a survey authorized by Governor William Gooch. The lands of Lord Fairfax and Northern Virginia were geographically defined as the land between the Rappahannock and Potomac rivers, and were officially called the &quot;Northern Neck&quot;. In 1746, a back line was surveyed and established between the headwaters of the Potomac and Rappahannock rivers, defining the west end of the grants. According to documents held by the Handley Regional Library of the Winchester-Frederick County Historical Society, the grant of included 22 modern counties, including Northumberland, Lancaster, Westmoreland, Stafford, King George, Prince William, Fairfax, Loudoun, Fauquier, Rappahannock, Culpeper, Madison, Clarke, Warren, Page, Shenandoah, and Frederick counties in Virginia, and Hardy, Hampshire, Morgan, Berkeley, and Jefferson counties in West Virginia.

Lord Fairfax was a lifelong bachelor, and became one of the more well-known persons of the late colonial era. In 1742, the new county formed from Prince William County was named Fairfax County in his honor, one of several locations in Northern Virginia and West Virginia&#x27;s Eastern Panhandle named after him. Lord Fairfax established his residence at his brother&#x27;s home at &quot;Belvoir&quot; on the grounds of present-day Fort Belvoir in Fairfax County. He later built a hunting lodge named &quot;Greenway Court&quot;, which was located near White Post in Clarke County near the Blue Ridge Mountains, and moved there. Around 1748, he George Washington, who was then 16-years-old. Impressed with Washington&#x27;s energy and talents, he employed him to survey his lands west of the Blue Ridge Mountains.

Lord Fairfax maintained neutrality as the American Revolutionary War began in 1775. Just a few weeks after the surrender of British Army troops under General Cornwallis at Yorktown, Fairfax died at his home at Greenway Court on December 9, 1781, at the age of 90. He was entombed on the east side of Christ Church in Winchester. While his plans for a large house at Greenway Court never materialized, and his stone lodge is now gone, a small limestone structure he built remains on the site in his honor.

===Statehood and Civil War===
Following the American Revolutionary War, the Thirteen Colonies formed the United States of America, and Continental Army commander and Virginian George Washington became the new nation&#x27;s first president. Prior to the Revolutionary War, Washington was a surveyor and developer of canals that were used for transportation. He was also a proponent of the bustling port city of Alexandria, located on the Potomac River below the fall line, not far from his plantation at Mount Vernon in Fairfax County.

During much of the colonial era and from 1790 to 1800, the nation&#x27;s capital was in Philadelphia. In 1800, however, with Washington&#x27;s guidance and support, the new federal city of present-day Washington, D.C. was laid out and established for the purpose of serving as the national capital. The region straddled the Potomac River and was located on a square of territory ceded to the federal government by Maryland and Virginia. Alexandria, a port city at the time, was on the eastern edge south of the river. On the outskirts on the northern side of the river, was Georgetown, another port city.

As the federal city grew, land in the portion contributed by Maryland proved best suited and adequate for early development. Not really part of the functioning federal city, citizens in Alexandria, who lacked voting input, were frustrated by the laws of the District&#x27;s government. Slavery also arose as a contentious issue. In 1846, to mitigate these issues and as part of abolishing slave trading in the District, the U.S. Congress passed a bill retroceding to Virginia the area south of the Potomac River, which was then Alexandria County. That area now forms all of present-day Arlington County, which was renamed from Alexandria County in 1922, and a portion of the independent city of Alexandria.

Slavery, states&#x27; rights, and economic issues increasingly divided the northern and southern states during the first half of the 19th century, eventually leading to the American Civil War, which lasted from 1861 to 1865. Although Maryland was a slave state, it remained with the Union, while Virginia seceded and joined the newly formed Confederate States of America, whose capital was established at Richmond.

The U.S. Supreme Court has never issued a firm opinion on whether the retrocession of the Virginia portion of the District of Columbia was constitutional. In the 1875 case of &quot;Phillips v. Payne&quot;, the Supreme Court held that Virginia had &quot;de facto&quot; jurisdiction over the area returned by Congress in 1847, and dismissed the tax case brought by the plaintiff. The court, however, did not rule on the core constitutional matter of the retrocession. Writing the majority opinion, Justice Noah Swayne stated only that:
The plaintiff in error is estopped from raising the point which he seeks to have decided. He cannot, under the circumstances, vicariously raise a question, nor force upon the parties to the compact an issue which neither of them desires to make.

With barely separating the two capital cities, Northern Virginia found itself in the center of much of the conflict, which inflicted destruction and bloodshed. The Army of Northern Virginia was the primary army for the Confederate States of America in the east. Owing to the region&#x27;s proximity to Washington, D.C., and the Potomac River, the armies of both sides frequently occupied and traversed Northern Virginia. As a result, several battles were fought in the area.

Northern Virginia was the operating area of John Singleton Mosby, a Confederate partisan, and several small skirmishes were fought throughout the region between his Rangers and Federal forces occupying Northern Virginia.

Following the end of the Civil War, the conflict remained popular among the region&#x27;s residents, and many area schools, roads, and parks were named for Confederate generals and statesmen, including Jefferson Davis Highway, Washington-Lee High School, and others.

Virginia split during the American Civil War, as was foreshadowed by the April 17, 1861, Virginia Secession Convention. Fifty counties in the western, mountainous portion of the state were largely opposed to secession in 1861. This region broke away from the Confederacy in 1863 and entered the Union as a new state, West Virginia. Unlike the eastern part of the state, West Virginia did not have fertile lands tilled by slaves and was geographically separated from the state government in Richmond by the Appalachian Mountains. During this process, a provisional government of Virginia was headquartered in Alexandria, which was under Union control during the war. Arlington, Clarke, Fairfax, Frederick, Loudoun, Shenandoah, and Warren Counties voted in favor of Virginia remaining in the Union in 1861, but eventually broke away from the state.

As a result of West Virginia&#x27;s formation, part of Lord Fairfax&#x27;s colonial land grant, which defined Northern Virginia, was ceded in the establishment of that state in 1863. Now known as the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia, the area includes Berkeley County and Jefferson County in West Virginia.

===20th century===

The Department of Defense&#x27;s increasing reliance on information technology companies during the Cold War was influential in launching the modern Northern Virginia economy and spurred urban development throughout the region. After end of the Cold War in 1991, prosperity continued in the region as it positioned itself as the &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; of the Eastern United States. The Internet was first commercialized in Northern Virginia, which served as the headquarters of many of the first Internet service providers.

The first major interconnection point of the Internet, MAE-East, was established in the 1990s in Ashburn after Virginia-area network provider operators decided to connect their networks. This infrastructure legacy is ongoing, as data center operators continue to expand near these facilities.

===21st century===
In early 2001, local Internet company AOL bought Time Warner, the world&#x27;s largest traditional media company, near the end of the dot-com bubble era. After the Internet bubble burst, however, Northern Virginia office vacancy rates increased from two percent in 2000 to 20 percent in 2002. After 2002, vacancy rates improved, falling below 10 percent as defense spending increased following the September 11 attacks. The subsequent Afghanistan and Iraq wars also contributed to the region&#x27;s growth, as the federal government increased its contracting with private defense firms.

==Regional organizations==
===Northern Virginia Regional Commission===
The Northern Virginia Regional Commission (NVRC) is a regional government that represents a regional council of thirteen member Northern Virginia local governments. These local governments include the counties of Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun, and Prince William. The local governments include the incorporated cities of Alexandria, Fairfax, Falls Church, Manassas, and Manassas Park. The local governments also include the incorporated towns of Dumfries, Herndon, Leesburg, and Vienna. NVRC&#x27;s chief roles and functions are providing information, performing professional and technical services for its members, and serving as a mechanism for regional coordination regarding the environment, transportation, affordable housing, community planning, military, and human services. Programs and projects address a wide array of local government interests.

According to Virginia&#x27;s Regional Cooperation Act, NVRC is a political subdivision. The region is technically referred to as Virginia&#x27;s planning district #8. The commission was established pursuant to Articles 1 and 2, Chapter 34, of the Acts of the Virginia General Assembly of 1968, subsequently revised and reenacted as the Regional Cooperation Act. Any incorporated county, city, or town in Northern Virginia with a population exceeding 3,500 that adopts NVRC&#x27;s charter agreement is eligible to become a member of the commission.

===Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments===

Northern Virginia constitutes a considerable portion of the population and number of jurisdictions that comprise the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (MWCOG). Founded in 1957, MWCOG is a regional organization of 22 Washington-area local governments, as well as area members of the Maryland and Virginia state legislatures, the U.S. Senate, and the U.S. House of Representatives. MWCOG provides a forum for discussion and the development of regional responses to issues regarding the environment, transportation, public safety, homeland security, affordable housing, community planning, and economic development.

The National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board, a component of MWCOG, is the federally designated metropolitan planning organization for the metropolitan Washington area, including Northern Virginia.

==Demographics==
 there were 3,197,076 people in Northern Virginia; approximately 37 percent of the state&#x27;s population.

These population counts include all counties within Virginia that are part of the Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area or the Washington-Baltimore-Arlington, DC-MD-VA-WV-PA Combined Statistical Area as defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget within the Executive Office of the President of the United States.

Of the 3,159,639 people in Northern Virginia in the 2019 estimates, 2,776,960 lived in &quot;central&quot; counties, or those counties and equivalent entities as delineated by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget as forming part of the urban core of the Washington Metropolitan Statistical Area. These counties include Arlington, Fairfax, Fauquier, Loudoun, Prince William, Stafford and the independent cities of Alexandria, Fairfax, Falls Church, Manassas, Manassas Park and Fredericksburg.

An additional 390,679 people lived in counties of the Washington Metropolitan Statistical Area or the Baltimore-Washington Combined Statistical Area not considered &quot;central.&quot; These counties, largely considered exurban or undergoing suburban change, include Clarke, Culpeper, Frederick, Madison, Rappahannock, Spotsylvania, Warren, and the independent city of Winchester.

In addition, there are counties outside of the Washington Metropolitan Area that under more broad definitions are referred to as being part of Northern Virginia. The University of Virginia Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service categorizes King George County as part of Northern Virginia, though the county was removed from the Washington Metropolitan Area in 2003. King George County and Orange County also include areas, such as Lake of the Woods, where the cross-commuting interchange with the Washington Metropolitan Area is high enough to merit inclusion in the Metropolitan Area, although more far-flung parts of these counties still cause the county-wide commuter interchange to fall below the threshold for inclusion in the Washington Metropolitan Area or Washington-Baltimore Combined Statistical Area. The demographic figures above do not include population counts for these two counties.

===Racial and ethnic composition===
The 2020 U.S. Census resulted in the following racial and ethnic composition for Northern Virginia:

Northern Virginia as a whole is 51.2% White, 17.4% Hispanic, 16.3% Asian, 14.1% Black, and 2.4% Other.

===Background===

Northern Virginia is home to people from diverse backgrounds, with significant numbers of Korean Americans, Vietnamese Americans, Bangladeshi Americans, Chinese Americans, Filipino Americans, Russian Americans, Arab Americans, Palestinian Americans, Uzbek Americans, Afghan Americans, Ethiopian Americans, Indian Americans, Iranian Americans, Thai Americans, and Pakistani Americans. Annandale, Centreville, Chantilly, and Fairfax City have very large Korean American communities. Falls Church has a large Vietnamese American community, and the region is home to a small Tibetan American community.

There is a sizable Hispanic population, primarily consisting of Salvadorans, Peruvians, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Bolivians, Mexicans, and Colombians. Arlington is the center of the largest Bolivian community in North America (mostly immigrants from Cochabamba). Many of these immigrants work in transportation-related fields, small businesses, hospitality, vending, gardening, construction, and cleaning.

Of those born in the U.S. and living in Northern Virginia&#x27;s four largest counties, their place of birth by census region is 60.5 percent from the South, 21.0 percent from the Northeast, 11.5 percent from the Midwest, and 7.0 percent from the West. 33.7 percent were born in Virginia, which is categorized as part of the Southern United States along with neighboring Maryland and Washington, D.C., by the Census Bureau.

===Educational attainment===
The core Northern Virginia jurisdictions of Alexandria, Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun, and Prince William comprising a total population of 1,973,513 is highly educated, with 55.5 percent of its population 25 years or older holding a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher. This is comparable to Seattle, the most educated large city in the U.S., with 53.4 percent of residents having at least a bachelor&#x27;s degree. The number of graduate/professional degree holders in Arlington is relatively high at 34.3 percent, nearly quadruple the rate of the U.S. population as a whole.

===Affluence===

The region is known in Virginia and the Washington metropolitan area for its relative affluence. Stafford County in Northern Virginia is one of the seven counties in the nation where black households make more than white households. Among large cities or counties in the nation with median household incomes in excess of $100,000, the top two cities, which comprise over half the region&#x27;s population, are in Northern Virginia. 

Northern Virginia also has one of the highest costs of living in the nation, making the actual purchasing power of these households considerably less than in other less affluent areas. According to Nielsen Claritas, Loudoun County and Arlington County have the highest concentration of 25- to 34-year-olds with incomes of $100,000+ in the nation.

In 1988, Tysons Galleria, a large shopping mall, opened across Virginia Route 123 from Tysons Corner Center with high-end department stores Neiman Marcus and Saks 5th Avenue, hoping to become the Washington area&#x27;s upscale shopping destination. The mall had trouble with sales and attracting high-end boutiques well into the 1990s and faced competition from Fairfax Square, which opened nearby in 1990 with the largest Tiffany &amp; Co. boutique outside of New York City. Following a 1997 renovation, Tysons Galleria was able to attract high-end stores. In 2002, &quot;National Geographic&quot; described it as &quot;the Rodeo Drive of the East Coast.&quot; 

In 2008, luxury home service Sotheby&#x27;s International Realty, which had three offices in Virginia serving the rest of the state, and two in Washington, D.C., opened a new office in McLean to sell high-end real estate in Northern Virginia.

===Crime===
According to the &quot;Crime in Virginia 2021&quot; report, published by the Department of State Police, Northern Virginia had homicide rates below the state average:

A 2009 report by the Northern Virginia Regional Gang Task Force suggests that anti-gang measures and crackdowns on illegal immigrants by local jurisdictions are driving gang members out of Northern Virginia and into more immigrant-friendly locales in Maryland, Washington, D.C., and the rest of Virginia. The violent crime rate in Northern Virginia fell 17 percent from 2003 to 2008. Fairfax County has the lowest crime rate in the Washington metropolitan area, and the lowest crime rate amongst the 50 largest jurisdictions of the United States.

While the region has extremely low violent crime rates, it is an emerging hub for teen sex trafficking, with regional gangs finding it more profitable than selling drugs or weapons.

==Economy==

Former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell described Northern Virginia as &quot;the economic engine of the state&quot; during a January 2010 Northern Virginia Technology Council address.

 the Northern Virginia office submarkets contain of office space, 33 percent more than those in Washington, D.C., and 55 percent more than those in its Maryland suburbs. of office space is under construction in Northern Virginia. 60 percent of the construction is occurring in the Dulles Corridor submarket.

As of September 2008, the unemployment rate in Northern Virginia was 3.2 percent, about half the national average, and the lowest of any metropolitan area. While the U.S. as a whole had negative job growth between September 2007 to September 2008, Northern Virginia gained 12,800 jobs, representing half of Virginia&#x27;s new jobs. As of July 2010, the unemployment rate of the region was 5.2 percent. 

In the mid-2000s, Fairfax County was one of few places in the nation that attracted more creative-class workers than it created.

===Internet===

Northern Virginia is the busiest Internet intersection in the nation, with up to 70 percent of all Internet traffic flowing through Loudoun County data centers every day. It is the largest data center market in the world by capacity, with nearly double that of London, and the world&#x27;s fastest-growing data market as of 2018. Loudoun County expects to have of data center space by 2021. By 2012, Dominion Energy expects that 10 percent of all electricity it sends to Northern Virginia will be used by the region&#x27;s data centers alone. Accenture estimates that 70 percent of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud servers are located in their Northern Virginia zone. A 2015–16 estimate by Greenpeace puts Amazon&#x27;s current and upcoming power capacity in Northern Virginia at over 1 gigawatt.

===Federal government===
The federal government is a major employer in Northern Virginia, which is home to numerous government agencies, including the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Pentagon, headquarters of the Department of Defense. The area also includes Fort Myer, Fort Belvoir, Marine Corps Base Quantico, the FBI Academy, DEA Academy, Naval Criminal Investigative Service, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and U.S. Geological Survey.

Government contracting is an important part of the region&#x27;s economy. Arlington alone is home to over 600 federal contractors and has the highest weekly wages of any major jurisdiction in the Washington metropolitan area.

The following government agencies have either 10,000+ employees or a $10+ billion budget:
*Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
*Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)
*Department of Defense (DOD)
*Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)
*National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA)
*National Reconnaissance Office (NRO)
*Transportation Security Administration (TSA)
*United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)
*United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS)

Other federal agencies in Northern Virginia include:
*DARPA
*National Science Foundation (NSF)
*Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI)

===Notable companies===



Verisign, the manager of the .com and .net top-level domains, is based in the region. Major companies formerly headquartered in the region include AOL, Mobil, Nextel/Sprint, PSINet, Sallie Mae, MCI Communications, Transurban, and UUNET.

==Attractions==

The region&#x27;s large shopping malls, such as Potomac Mills and Tysons Corner Center, attract many visitors, as do the region&#x27;s Civil War battlefields, which include the sites of both the First and Second Battle of Bull Run in Manassas and the Battle of Fredericksburg in Fredericksburg. Old Town Alexandria is known for its historic churches, townhouses, restaurants, gift shops, artist studios, and cruise boats. 

The waterfront and outdoor recreational amenities such as biking and running trails, including the Washington and Old Dominion Rail Trail that leads from Alexandria to the foothills of the Blue Ridge, the Mount Vernon Trail and trails along various stream beds, whitewater and sea kayaking, and rock climbing areas along the Potomac River, various parks, Great Falls Park, and historic Mount Vernon, which opened a new visitor center in 2006. The Government Island park and quarry in Stafford County has views of the Potomac River. Aquia Creek was the source for many of the building materials for the White House, and U.S. Capitol. Also in Stafford County are historic places, including George Washington&#x27;s boyhood home, Ferry Farm, the Civil War headquarters and plantation Chatham Manor, and Gari Melchers Home &amp; Studio.

Arlington National Cemetery and the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, an annex of the National Air and Space Museum, which includes exhibits that cannot be housed at the main museum in Washington, D.C., due to space constraints. Concerts and other live shows are held at the Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts in Wolf Trap.

==Politics==

===Background===

From the mid-1880s until the mid-1960s Virginia politics were dominated by Conservative Democrats. After World War I, under the leadership of Harry Flood Byrd, who became Governor of Virginia and later a U.S. senator, the group became known as the Byrd Organization. With a power base in a network of the constitutional officers of most of Virginia&#x27;s counties, they controlled Virginia&#x27;s state government. The Byrd Organization largely followed conservative and anti-debt principles espoused by Byrd, who grew up in a rural setting during the fiscally stressed era following Reconstruction. Although a member of the Democratic Party and an initial supporter of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Senator Byrd became a bitter opponent of the New Deal and related national policies, particularly those involving fiscal and social issues. He became Virginia&#x27;s senior senator after the death of Senator Carter Glass of Lynchburg in 1946.

The period following World War II saw substantial growth in the size and diversity of Virginia&#x27;s suburban areas, including Northern Virginia, Richmond, and Hampton Roads. People of the emerging middle class were increasingly less willing to accept the rural focus of the General Assembly, nor Byrd&#x27;s extreme positions on public debt and social issues. The latter was nowhere more graphically illustrated than with Byrd&#x27;s violent opposition to racial integration of the state&#x27;s public schools. His leadership in the failed policy of Massive Resistance to racial desegregation of the public schools and efforts to circumvent related rulings of the United States Supreme Court ultimately caused closure of some public schools in the state and alienated many middle-class voters. The Byrd Organization had never been strong in Virginia&#x27;s independent cities, and beginning in the 1960s, city and suburban factions increasingly supported efforts to make broad changes in Virginia. In this climate, the Republican Party of Virginia began making inroads.

Rulings by both state and federal courts that &quot;Massive Resistance&quot; was unconstitutional and a move to compliance with the court orders in early 1959 by Governor J. Lindsay Almond, and the General Assembly could be described as marking the Byrd Organization&#x27;s &quot;last stand&quot;, although the remnants of the Organization continued to wield power for a few years longer.

When Senator Byrd resigned in 1965, he was replaced by his son Harry F. Byrd Jr. in the U.S. Senate. In 1969, however, the 80-year domination of Virginia politics by the Byrds ended with the election of Linwood Holton, a conservative Democrat who subsequently became a Republican and was reelected in 1973, representing the first Republican governor had been elected in the 20th century. 

During the last quarter of the 20th century, Virginia&#x27;s Republicans gained ground against the Democrats. Republican John Warner from Northern Virginia gained one of the seats in the U.S. Senate in 1978. After longtime state senator L. Douglas Wilder became governor in 1989, the first African American to be elected a governor in the United States, Republicans subsequently gained control of the Governor&#x27;s mansion after the 1993 election. Republicans finally gained control of the General Assembly in the 1999 elections.

For a number of years, the recurring Republican theme was to reduce waste in state government and taxes. However, this seemed to reach a peak during the administration of Jim Gilmore, with a move to repeal an unpopular car tax accompanied by a failure to provide promised replacement funds to the counties, cities and towns. Subsequently, two Democrats were elected consecutively as governor, and control in the General Assembly shifted back to a more bipartisan balance of power. As governor, both Mark Warner and Tim Kaine were confronted with stabilizing state economics and dealing with a deteriorating transportation funding situation partially caused by the state&#x27;s failure to index state fuel taxes to inflation, with a &quot;cents per gallon&quot; tax rate unchanged since the administration of Democratic Governor Gerald Baliles in 1986.

===21st-century politics===


In the 21st century, Northern Virginia is known for becoming increasingly favorable to the Democratic Party at both the state and national level. Fairfax County supported John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election, and also voted heavily for Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election, the first time a Democratic candidate for president carried the Commonwealth of Virginia since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. The area also voted for Democrats Jim Webb in 2006 for U.S. Senate, Tim Kaine in 2005 for governor, and Mark Warner in 2001 for governor. In these three races for statewide office, the margins tallied in Northern Virginia provided the Democratic candidate with a winning margin of victory.

Democrat Jim Webb defeated incumbent Senator George Allen by the slim margin of 49.6 to 49.2 percent in 2006. However, that margin increased to 58.1 to 40.7 percent in favor of the Democratic challenger in the counties and cities of Northern Virginia, whereas Webb ran behind Allen somewhat, 46.1 to 52.7 percent, in the remainder of the commonwealth. Webb carried Fairfax County, Prince William County, and Loudoun County, as well as the more urban areas of Arlington, Alexandria, and Falls Church. Allen&#x27;s sole wins in Northern Virginia were the cities of Manassas and Manassas Park, winning the latter two only by the narrow margins of 3.54 and 2.38 percent, respectively.

In the 2004 presidential election, 53 percent of Northern Virginia voters voted for John Kerry, the Democratic candidate and 46 percent voted for George W. Bush, the Republican candidate. This contrasted with the rest of Virginia, which gave 43 percent to Kerry and 56 percent to Bush. Kerry also carried Fairfax County, the most populous county in Virginia, and Fairfax City, the first time those jurisdictions had voted Democratic since Johnson&#x27;s national landslide in 1964. The strongest support in the area for the Democrats lies inside the Beltway, in Arlington, Alexandria, and parts of Fairfax County. The more distant areas (i.e., Loudoun County, Stafford County and Prince William County) historically have been more conservative; however, as they have increased in population, they have become more liberal. Both Mark Warner in 2001 and John Kerry in 2004 lost Loudoun and Prince William counties. Tim Kaine won Prince William County, and Loudoun counties in 2005. Tim Kaine won Stafford County in 2018. In 2006 despite not polling as strongly as Mark Warner statewide, Democratic senate candidate Jim Webb won both Loudoun and Prince William counties. In 2005, 65 percent of the voters of Northern Virginia voted for Democrat Tim Kaine for governor over Jerry Kilgore, who received only 32 percent of the vote, easily 14 points lower than George W. Bush&#x27;s showing only a year earlier.

The Democrats in Virginia also have made considerable gains in the Virginia House of Delegates which helped turn both chambers of the state legislature to the Democrats. Since 2015 Democrats have flipped districts in the suburbs of Washington D.C in counties such as Stafford County, Prince William County, and Loudoun County. These flips have shown the changing demographics and voting bloc in these counties and the expansion of suburbanization and Northern Virginia. For example, the 28th district a seat held by Republicans since 1984 in Stafford County and parts of Fredericksburg and seat of former Republican Virginia Speaker of the House William J. Howell. 10 years ago Republicans won the Virginia House of Delegates election with 74% of the vote in the district. In the 2019 election Joshua G. Cole, a fierce Democrat and supporter of the Green New Deal, flipped the district by 4 points. Another district the 2nd district that encompasses Prince William County and Stafford County was once a swing district held by both Republicans and Democrats. In 2017, Democrats flipped the district with 64% of the vote and was re-elected with 60% of the vote with Jennifer Caroll Foy a supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment which she passed this year with the new Democratic trifecta in the state.

The 7th, 8th, the 10th, and the 11th congressional districts lie within Northern Virginia.(As of 5/15/2023) The current representatives are from the 8th district is Don Beyer (D), from the 7th district is Abigail Spanberger (D), from the 10th district is Jennifer Wexton (D), and the current representative from the 11th district is Gerry Connolly (D). Three of four districts voted for Jim Webb in the 2006 Senate election.

In the 2005 gubernatorial election, the entire region continued to move away from the Republicans. Fairfax County, Arlington County, the cities of Alexandria, Fairfax City, and Falls Church, and for the first time, Loudoun County and Prince William County, went to Tim Kaine, the Democratic candidate. The area continued to be more Democratic the closer it was to Washington, D.C., but Richmond resident Kaine was able to accomplish what Northern Virginian Mark Warner had been unable to do just four years earlier in 2001: carry Loudoun County and Prince William County (as well as win over 60 percent of the vote in Fairfax County).

In 2008, economist Nancy Pfotenhauer, a spokesperson and adviser for the John McCain presidential campaign, created controversy by referring to the areas of Virginia not included in Northern Virginia as &quot;real Virginia&quot;, picking up on a Republican talking point that Sarah Palin promoted; namely that red states are the &quot;real America&quot; and more &quot;pro-America&quot;. Joe McCain, brother of John McCain, also called Arlington and Alexandria in Northern Virginia &quot;communist country&quot;.

In the 2008 presidential election, the majority of Northern Virginia voters voted for Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama. Over 70 percent of registered voters in Arlington, Alexandria and Falls Church voted for Obama. Fairfax County, Loudoun County, Manassas and Prince William County also went to Obama, with Obama receiving 60 percent of the vote in Fairfax County compared to Republican candidate John McCain&#x27;s 39 percent. Obama&#x27;s win in Fairfax County, the most populous county in the state, marks the second time a Democrat has carried that county since the 1964 breakdown of Democratic predominance in the South (the other being the 2004 presidential elections when the county went to John Kerry). Obama&#x27;s victory in Northern Virginia continues the trend of Northern Virginia favoring Democrats over Republicans.

In the 2009 gubernatorial election, though Arlington, Alexandria, and Falls Church would back Democratic state Senator Creigh Deeds in his unsuccessful run for governor, Republican former state Attorney General, and future Governor, Bob McDonnell, who overwhelmingly defeated Deeds 59 to 41 percent across the state as a whole, won Fairfax County, Loudoun County, Stafford County, Manassas, and Prince William County. However, a January 2010 special state senate election in the Fairfax county-based 37th State Senatorial district, which was held following Ken Cuccinelli&#x27;s (R) resignation from the Senate of Virginia upon his election as state attorney general two months earlier, was won by then-Delegate David W. Marsden (D). Marsden&#x27;s victory would suggest that despite McDonnell&#x27;s performance in northern Virginia during the 2009 gubernatorial election, the Democratic trend in the region has not been reversed.

In 2011, a poll by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; found that 47 percent of Virginians favored the legalization of same-sex marriage, 43 percent opposed it, and 10 percent had no opinion. It found 55 percent favored allowing same-sex couples to adopt children, while 35 percent opposed that and 10 percent had no opinion. The same poll found that 64 percent of residents Arlington, Alexandria, Fairfax, Fairfax County support same-sex marriage, 63 percent of residents of Loudoun, Prince William, Manassas, Manassas Park, Stafford, Fauquier, Culpeper, Madison, Rappamannock, Warrenton, Clarke County, Frederick, and Winchester support same-sex marriage, while only 42 percent of the rest of Virginia supports same-sex marriage.

Arlington, Clarke, Culpeper, Fairfax, Fauquier, Frederick, Loudoun, Prince William, Rappahannock, Spotsylvania, Stafford, and Warren counties, as well as Alexandria, Falls Church, Fairfax, Fredericksburg, Manassas, Manassas Park, and Winchester cities, form Northern Virginia&#x27;s contribution to the Washington metropolitan area; Hillary Clinton received 849,758 votes compared to Donald Trump&#x27;s 503,120 votes in the twelve-county and seven-city region, a 63–37 percent split in the 2016 presidential election. Despite the 26 percent margin of victory for Clinton, seven counties voted for Trump. This compares to Clinton&#x27;s 825,974 votes to Trump&#x27;s 236,827 votes (78 to 22 percent) in Calvert, Charles, Frederick, Montgomery, and Prince George&#x27;s counties in Maryland as well as her 282,830 votes to his 12,723 votes (96 to 4 percent) in Washington, D.C. Among the aforementioned counties in Maryland, Trump carried two of them. The entire Washington metropolitan area – all seventeen counties and seven cities in Maryland and Virginia, plus the District of Columbia – voted 1,958,562 ballots to 752,670 ballots (72 to 28 percent) for Clinton and Trump, respectively. Compared to the entire state, Northern Virginia&#x27;s twelve counties and seven cities represent 36 percent of the total electorate.

==Culture==

Due to the proximity to the capital, many Northern Virginians go to Washington, D.C., for cultural outings and nightlife. The Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., is a popular place for performances, as is Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts near Vienna. Jiffy Lube Live (near Manassas), EagleBank Arena at George Mason University in Fairfax, and Capital One Arena in Washington serve as popular concert venues, and Capital One Arena also serves as the home of sporting events. Smithsonian museums also serve as local cultural institutions with easy proximity to Northern Virginia, and the Udvar-Hazy Center of the National Air and Space Museum in Chantilly is popular as well.

Tysons Corner Center (&quot;Tysons I&quot;) is one of the largest malls in the country and is a hub for shopping in the area. Tysons Galleria (&quot;Tysons II&quot;), its counterpart across Route 123, carries more high-end stores. Tysons itself is the 12th-largest business district in the United States. Other malls include Springfield Mall, Fair Oaks Mall, Manassas Mall, Spotsylvania Towne Centre which has a mall and a mixed-use retail and commercial area, and The Fashion Centre at Pentagon City. Dulles Town Center is the region&#x27;s newest mall, serving the eastern Loudoun County area. Reston Town Center is a high-density mixed-use retail, commercial, and residential development located just off the 267 Toll Road in Reston. Potomac Mills, located in Prince William County, is the largest outlet mall in the region. The town of Leesburg in Loudoun County contains the Leesburg Corner Premium Outlets outlet mall.

===Recreation===
Northern Virginia is home to many activities for families and individuals, including biking/walking trails, sports leagues, recreation facilities, museums, historic homes, and parks.

It is home to the Northern Virginia Swim League, which comprises 102 community pools, and NVSL-Dive, which is composed of 47 teams in Fairfax and Arlington counties. The swim and dive teams compete over the course of 5–6 weeks from the end of June through the first weekend in August.

The National Capital Area Council operates in the Washington metropolitan area. It serves localities in the Washington D.C Metropolitan Area. In Northern Virginia, it has chapters and divisions that serve, Fairfax County, Loudoun County, Prince William County, Stafford County, Arlington County, the City of Alexandria, and the City of Fairfax. It also serves Caroline County, the City of Fredericksburg, and Spotsylvania County.

The National Capital Soccer League serves soccer leagues and associations in the Washington D.C Metropolitan Area. It includes Northern Virginia soccer associations in Fairfax County, Loudoun County, Prince William County, Stafford County, Arlington County, the City of Fredericksburg, the City of Alexandria, the City of Fairfax, and one soccer association in Culpeper County, Winchester, and Warrenton.

===Secession===

Former Republican delegate Jeannemarie Devolites Davis expressed a common sentiment when she said &quot;The formula for funding school construction in Northern Virginia requires that we pay 500 percent more than the actual cost of a project. We have to pay 500 percent because we give 400 percent away to the rest of the state.&quot; The state government&#x27;s funding level for transportation projects in Northern Virginia is a perennial issue that often causes consternation from the region&#x27;s politicians and citizens.

Many people consider the idea of secession a rhetorical one used to express frustration with the treatment of Northern Virginia by the state government as well as the opposing political sentiments between it and the rest of Virginia. Critics often point out that all states include regions of varying income and political discrepancies within their borders. Nevertheless, the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., are often seen as an extension of the more urbanized Mid-Atlantic, north-east, and the Boston-Washington corridor, even though Virginia as a whole is considered a Southern state. This perception is especially fueled by the region&#x27;s closeness to Washington, D.C., large numbers of Northern transplants, and the prevalence of both new immigrant communities and growing ethnic diversity. Nevertheless, there is no serious secessionist movement.

==Transportation==

===Airports===

The area has two major airports, Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Crystal City, the nation&#x27;s 23rd-busiest airport by passenger traffic as of 2022 and the busiest airport in the Washington metropolitan area, and Dulles International Airport in Dulles. in both passenger loadings and aircraft movements, and the 16th-busiest airport in the nation by takeoffs and landings in 2007. Dulles is the region&#x27;s primary international gateway, serves as a hub for United Airlines, and has recently improved its low-cost carrier offerings with the addition of multiple flights by Southwest and JetBlue.

===Subway and passenger trains===

Commuters are served by the Washington Metro subway and the Virginia Railway Express (VRE), a commuter railroad. Metro is the second-busiest subway system in the nation after the New York City Subway system. A completed expansion project extends the system past Dulles International Airport into Loudon County. The VRE has two lines adjacent to I-66 and I-95 starting in Union Station and extending to Manassas and Spotsylvania, respectively. VRE service is significantly more limited, but nevertheless saw over a year of continuous ridership increase from 2007 into 2008. Bus service is provided by WMATA&#x27;s Metrobus and several local jurisdictions.

===Highways===
The Washington metropolitan area has the worst traffic in the nation, and Northern Virginia is home to six of the ten worst bottlenecks in the area. To alleviate gridlock, local governments encourage using Metrorail, HOV, carpooling, slugging, and other forms of mass transportation. Major limited- or partially limited-access highways include Interstates 495 (the Capital Beltway), 95, 395, and 66, the Fairfax County Parkway and adjoining Franconia–Springfield Parkway, the George Washington Memorial Parkway, and the Dulles Toll Road. High-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes are used for commuters and buses on I-66, I-95/395, and the Dulles Toll Road. A study done by INRIX Roadway Analytics ranked Southbound I-95 from Washington D.C to the southern tip of Stafford County the worst single traffic hotspot in the nation. It also ranked Northbound I-95 from Spotsylvania County to the northern tip of Stafford County the seventh worst traffic hotspot in the nation. Northern Virginia is also home to the Express Lanes. These express lanes are where a car has an E-ZPass transponder and is charged for riding a distance on the express lanes. They are currently being built on I-66, and are currently available on I-395, I-495 from the Springfield Interchange to Tysons Corner but are being extended to the Maryland-Virginia border, and I-95 from the end of I-395 (Springfield Interchange) to central Stafford County and are being extended to Fredericksburg.

Two major regional bottlenecks, the Springfield Interchange and Woodrow Wilson Bridge, were massively reconstructed with completion in 2007 and 2008. Generally, Potomac River crossings remain major choke points; proposals to add crossings (such as near Leesburg or Quantico as part of a long-proposed Outer Beltway) are opposed by Virginia communities near the suggested bridge sites, and by Marylanders who fear that new bridges would bring new housing development to green space in that state such as Poolesville. Because of Northern Virginia&#x27;s high housing costs, tens of thousands of employees there choose more affordable housing far away in outer Virginia exurban counties, or in Prince George&#x27;s County and Southern Maryland, thus creating tremendous traffic congestion on the Potomac bridges. This situation is much like metropolitan areas of California. Furthermore, Fairfax County localities such as Great Falls, Dranesville, and Clifton impose low-density, large-acreage residential zoning, which forces developers to leapfrog into Loudoun and Prince William counties to build housing, thus increasing commuters&#x27; driving distances. In recent years, developers have continued to develop in Loudoun County, but have filled Prince William County, leading many developers to move south to Stafford County, where local government has been more receptive to developments.

==Education==
===Primary education===
Fairfax County&#x27;s public school system includes the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, an award-winning magnet school. As of 2021, 19 of the region&#x27;s schools appear in the top 200 of &quot;Newsweek&quot;″s &quot;America&#x27;s Top Public High Schools&quot;, and Thomas Jefferson is ranked number one. In comparison, Washington, D.C., Maryland, and the rest of Virginia have 10 schools between them in the top 200.

<text> () are Ainu sagas that form a long rich tradition of oral literature. In older periods, the epics were performed by both men and women; during the 19th and early 20th centuries, when Ainu culture was in decline, women were generally the most skillful performers. Traditional tales describe floating worlds with , or the land of the humans (as opposed to , the land of the gods), resting on the back of a fish whose movements cause earthquakes.

== Translation history ==
Professor Kyōsuke Kindaichi collected and translated them into Japanese.

In August 2006, the reported in its article that Japan&#x27;s Agency of Cultural Affairs () would discontinue funding by fiscal year 2007 of the project to translate and transcribe the compilations of Imekanu, , which consists of 92 stories written in romaji with the tenth story lost and 49 stories left untranslated. It is said that the stoppage was because of Shigeru Kayano&#x27;s death in May 2006.

In 1999, a multi-national group of educators and translators established &quot;Project U-e-peker&quot; with the intention of making more Ainu folktales available in English. They have produced English versions of two of Kayano&#x27;s books under the titles &quot;The Ainu: A Story of Japan&#x27;s Original People&quot; (Tuttle Publishing 2004) and &quot;The Ainu and the Fox&quot; (RIC Publications 2006). Future projects include picturebook English versions of the recorded in , an anthology of stories from the Ainu oral tradition which were first put into writing and translated into the Japanese language by Chiri Yukie (1903–1922), the niece of Kannari Matsu, an invaluable assistant to Kindaichi until she died at the age of 19.

Books which relate the epic songs of the Ainu in English include Chiri Yukie&#x27;s , translated by Sarah M. Strong in 2011 and Benjamin Peterson of Project Okikirmui in 2013, and &quot;Songs of Gods, Songs of Humans: The Epic Tradition of the Ainu&quot; by Donald L. Philippi. The Project Okikirmui collection contains 13 , while Philippi translates 35 epics, all of them originally recorded by women, the majority by Imekanu. Strong&#x27;s text contains the thirteen of the , as well as Chiri&#x27;s original preface and background on her working relationship with Kindaichi. The Ainu epic is a major example of the style.

== Common themes in narratives ==
The trade and parents&#x27; death are two common themes in .

=== Trade ===
The trade happens between the Ainu and the Wajin, which refers to the ethnic Japanese. The trade between both sides persisted from the 14th century to the middle of the 19th century. This long-term trade with Wajin becomes a common theme in the narrative. There are a variety of risks associated with trading activities, including conflicts with foreigners, assaults by inland invading foes, and troubles in Wajin town. In the Ainu language, trade with the Wajin is referred to as . The Ainu-Wajin trade began as a friendship trade. However, this relationship changed as Wajin aimed to control and rule Ainu through trade.

There are two story patterns about trade:

# The trade-difficulty pattern. It is about heroes stumbling into a problem in a Wajin town. However, the protagonists manage to overcome those difficulties and become wealthy in the end.
# The trade-murder pattern. It is about heroes getting murdered in a Wajin town.

Both story patterns are about the risk and danger associated with trading. The difference is whether or not the main protagonists can solve these problems. In the first story pattern, the story&#x27;s ending reveals that all problems are resolved, and the heroes live long lives. They become wealthy and successful. In the second pattern, some of the key characters in story are killed. One hero survives and has the responsibility of carrying on their family line.

=== Parents&#x27; death ===
Another theme in is the parents&#x27; death. In the epic story, the protagonists lose both parents at a young age. These hero characters in survive by themselves or through the help of gods in the Ainu culture. When the orphan grows up, their action of starting the trade with outsiders is regarded as heroic in . The danger from the trade is closely related to the parent&#x27;s death in .

=== &quot;The Story of a Wolf God Who Saved Pon Otasutunkur and His Son&quot; ===
The &quot;The Story of a Wolf God Who Saved Pon Otasutunkur and His Son&quot; reveals both themes of trade and parents&#x27; death. It illustrates the connection between two themes the risks of trade and parents&#x27; death.

The protagonist Pon Otastunkur is an orphan. His parents both pass away. He is raised in the village by an old man whose true identity is the wolf god. When Pon Otastunkur is old enough, the wolf god brings him to the Wajin town to conduct trade. The daughter of the Wajin town&#x27;s ruler falls in love with Pon Otastunkur and marries him. They leave Wajin town and return to the village together. One day, people from another village start the battle with Pon Otastunkur to steal his money gained from trading with Wajin. Unfortunately, Pon Otastunkur and his wife both die in this battle. Their son loses both parents and repeats the same destiny as his father. The same wolf god raises the son of Pon Otastunku and brings him to the Wajin town to conduct trade. At the end of the story, they successfully rescue and heal the village from the damage.

== Depiction of animals and nature ==
 are all narrated in the first person. Some stories describe the world through animal perspectives, such as owls, wolves and foxes. Besides animals, all things in the natural world can deliver their voice in the story, including the rivers, valleys and seas. The first-person narrative of animals and nature shows the Ainu people&#x27;s powerful imagination.

The observation and creation of nature in literature emerge from their generations of hunting, gathering and fishing experiences in nature. It is very different from Western science&#x27;s perspective of the natural world, which is distanced and objective. Ainu people first participate in nature and then depict the creatures they see and their living environment. In the narrative, the repeated rhythmic phrase imitates a cry, scream, gnawing, or slithering of the animal spirits. It also mimics behaviour such as a snake moving through the grass. Hirame Karepia&#x27;s recitation of the (fox spirit) has a refrain that begins with the sound pau. It is the traditional onomatopoeic presentation of a fox&#x27;s cry in Ainu culture.

<text>David Bennett Hill (August 29, 1843October 20, 1910) was an American politician from New York who was the 29th governor of New York from 1885 to 1891 and represented New York in the United States Senate from 1892 to 1897.

In 1892, he made an unsuccessful bid for president on a platform of bimetallism, but lost the nomination to Grover Cleveland, his longtime political rival and former running mate.

==Early life and career==
David B. Hill was born on August 29, 1843, in Havana, New York. He was educated locally, studied law, and began a practice in Elmira in 1864.

In 1864, he was named Elmira City Attorney.

Hill represented Chemung County in the New York State Assembly in 1871 and 1872. Hill was elected an alderman of Elmira in 1880, Mayor of Elmira in 1882, and was President of the New York State Bar Association from 1886 to 1887.

==Governor of New York==
Hill was elected lieutenant governor in 1882, with more votes than the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, Grover Cleveland.

Hill became governor in 1885, when Cleveland resigned to take office as President of the United States. Hill won election to the office of governor in his own right in 1885 and 1888 despite Cleveland losing the state in the concurrent presidential election.

While Cleveland had publicly advocated for civil service reform, Hill embraced the role of patronage in politics and built up a strong following. During Hill&#x27;s tenure as governor, the Democratic Party organization in New York polarized between those loyal to Hill and those who favored Cleveland.

As governor, Hill opposed attempts to enact civil service reform and tax liquor. He supported regulation of tenement housing and labor reforms such as maximum work hours. On May 15, 1885, Hill signed &quot;a bill establishing a &#x27;Forest Preserve&#x27; of 715,000 acres that was to remain permanently &#x27;as wild forest lands.&#x27;&quot; This tract soon became the Adirondack Park.

During his tenure as governor, William Kemmler was executed in the electric chair, the first inmate in the country ever to be put to death in this manner. On April 23, 1889, Hill vetoed a bill from the state legislature that would block the street construction at the Polo Grounds. He also vetoed two attempts at ballot reform by the Republican legislature.

== United States Senate ==
After the 1888 elections, which saw the defeat of Cleveland and the re-election of Hill, Hill established effective control over the state Democratic Party. Democratic gains in the 1890 elections gave the Democratic Party a majority in the legislature. The legislature elected Hill to the U.S. Senate. Hill was meant to take office in the U.S. Senate on March 4, 1891, but decline to resign the governorship so that Roswell P. Flower, a member of his political machine, could take the governorship.

In 1892, Hill sought the Democratic nomination for President of the United States, running as a supporter of bimetallism. At the 1892 Democratic National Convention, Cleveland defeated Hill and Governor of Iowa Horace Boies on the first ballot. Cleveland went on to defeat President Benjamin Harrison in the general election.

As Senator, Hill blocked President Cleveland&#x27;s two appointments to the U.S. Supreme Court, William B. Hornblower and Wheeler H. Peckham, both New York judges who had opposed Hill&#x27;s political machine.

In 1894, Hill was defeated by Republican Levi P. Morton when, as a sitting U.S. senator, he ran again for governor again.

In 1896, Hill initially opposed the nomination of William Jennings Bryan for president, but supported Bryan in the general election against the Clevelandite Gold Democrats.

In 1897, Hill was defeated for re-election by Republican Thomas C. Platt.

== Later career and death ==
Hill received significant support for the vice presidential nomination at the 1900 Democratic National Convention, but the party nominated former Vice President Adlai Stevenson I. Hill served as the campaign manager of Democratic presidential nominee Alton Parker in the 1904 presidential election.

Hill died at Wolfert&#x27;s Roost, his country home near Albany on October 20, 1910, from the effects of Bright&#x27;s Disease and heart disease. He was buried in Montour Cemetery in Mountour Falls.

In 1993 Honda met Miho Hatori while working with the band Leitoh Lychee. The two formed their own band, Cibo Matto, in March 1994. The unique formation of the band in which Hatori was the singer who sang all the songs in relation to food and love, and Honda was the only instrumentalist where she played live electronics and made the sound of a full band, generated a quick sensation in the city, and they signed the record deal with Warner Brothers before the year was over. In 1995, they recorded their debut album &quot;Viva! La Woman&quot; with Mitchell Froom and Tchad Blake. That year they met Russell Simins when they opened for Blues Explosion, and started the band Butter 08 with Mike Mills, Evan Bernard, and Rick Lee. Honda produced their self-titled album with Simins. Both Cibo Matto and Butter 08 released their albums in 1996.

She was in a romantic relationship with Sean Lennon from 1996 to 2000 and produced his 1998 album &quot;Into the Sun&quot;. The two met when Honda remixed Yoko Ono&#x27;s song &quot;Talking to the Universe&quot; (from the album &quot;Rising&quot;), along with Thurston Moore, Tricky, Beastie Boys and Ween. Cibo Matto invited Lennon and Timo Ellis to join the band as they started to tour frequently. From 1996 to 2000, Honda toured extensively with all three of these projects. 

Also in 1996, Cibo Matto worked with the film director Michel Gondry on their single Sugar Water, a highly artistic music video in the form of a visual palindrome.

Cibo Matto broke up in the year 2001. Honda&#x27;s work since then seems to be concentrated more in the downtown New York scene, working with musicians such as Dave Douglas, Susie Ibarra, Vincent Gallo, Trevor Dunn, Jim O&#x27;Rourke, and John Zorn, for whose label Tzadik Honda recorded her two solo albums. In 2003, Honda collaborated with Boredoms drummer Yoshimi P-We, under the name Yoshimi and Yuka.

In 2005, Honda worked for Hal Willner at Expo 2005 for the 3D animation which was directed by Robert Wilson. She also sang on the Dopo Yume album &quot;The Secret Show&quot;.

In 2006 Honda played keyboards on Sean Lennon&#x27;s album &quot;Friendly Fire&quot; and acted as musical director for the supporting tour.

In 2007 she co-produced Irina Lazareanu with Sean Lennon. She also wrote songs and recorded with Edie Brickell on her new album &quot;The Heavy Circles&quot;.

In 2009 she worked on Yoko Ono&#x27;s &quot;Between My Head and the Sky&quot; as assistant producer. She is also credited with mixing the album with Yoko and Sean, and with &quot;Pro-Tools Editing, sampler, e. piano, organ percussion.&quot;

In late 2009 and early 2010 she performed as a member of the reformed Plastic Ono Band including concerts in Tokyo and New York, and also appeared as a member of the group The Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger. She also performed improvisational shows with Mike Watt and Nels Cline in the groups Floored by Four and Brother&#x27;s Sister&#x27;s Daughter. During this period she became romantically involved with, and subsequently engaged to, Cline. They married in Japan in November 2010.

In 2011, following an eight-year collaboration with Petra Haden, she produced and performed on the album &quot;Salt on Sea Glass&quot; as a member of If By Yes, a group also consisting of Yuko Araki on drums and Hirotaka &quot;Shimmy&quot; Shimizu on guitar, with contributions from David Byrne and Nels Cline.

Since 2011 Honda has re-collaborated with Hatori for new Cibo Matto material, to culminate in 2014 with the release of the group&#x27;s first album in 15 years, &quot;Hotel Valentine&quot;.

<text>James Lenox (August 19, 1800 – February 17, 1880) was an American bibliophile and philanthropist. His collection of paintings and books eventually became known as the Lenox Library and in 1895 became part of the New York Public Library.

He inherited a fortune from his merchant father and spent much of his life amassing a collection of art and literature unparalleled in value. Lenox&#x27;s collection included rare items such as the Gutenberg Bible. His library, valued at nearly a million dollars, stood on what is now the site of the Frick Collection. Lenox also generously donated to institutions like the Presbyterian Hospital and American Bible Society. He never married, and became increasingly reclusive after a broken romance.

==Early life==
Lenox was born in New York City on August 19, 1800. He was the only surviving son of six children born to Rachel (née Carmer) Lenox and Robert Lenox (1759–1839). His father was a wealthy merchant who was born in Kirkcudbright, Scotland, emigrated to America during the Revolutionary War, and settled in New York in 1783. Of his five sisters, four married and one remained single, like Lenox, throughout her life.

His maternal grandfather was Nicholas Carmer, a New York cabinet maker. Upon his father&#x27;s death in 1839, Lenox inherited a fortune of over a million dollars and 30 acres of land between Fourth and Fifth Avenues. A graduate of Columbia College, he studied law and was admitted to the bar, but never practiced. He retired from business when his father died.

==Career==
Lenox went to Europe soon after his admission to the bar and, while abroad, began collecting rare books. This, along with collecting art, became the absorbing passion of his life. For half a century, he devoted much of his time and talent to forming a library and gallery of paintings, unsurpassed in value by any other private collection in the New World. In 1870 these, together with many rare manuscripts, marble busts and statues, mosaics, engravings, and curios, became the Lenox Library in New York City. Lenox served as its first president.

The library occupied the crest of the hill on Fifth Avenue, between 70th and 71st Streets, overlooking Central Park. On May 23, 1895, the Lenox Library was consolidated with the Astor Library and the Tilden Trust to form the New York Public Library.
The collection of Bibles, including the Gutenberg Bible—both in number and rarity—was believed to be unequaled even to those of the British Museum; while its Americana, incunabula, and Shakespeariana, surpassed those of any other American library, public or private. The collection was valued at nearly a million dollars; including the $900,000 for the land, building, and endowment, it totaled above $2,000,000. The Frick Collection stands on the Lenox Library&#x27;s former site.

Lenox was a founder of the Presbyterian Hospital in New York City. His gifts to it amounted to $600,000. He also made important gifts to Princeton College and Seminary, and gave liberally to numerous churches and charities connected with the Presbyterian Church. Lenox was also the president of the American Bible Society, to which he was a liberal donor. James Grant Wilson reports passing on several anonymous gifts from Lenox to needy scholars. He joined the American Philosophical Society in 1854. That same year, he was also elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society, and served as the society&#x27;s vice-president from 1868 to 1880.

Lenox occasionally reprinted limited editions, restricted to ten or twenty copies, of rare books, which he placed in some of the great public libraries and notable private collections, for example, that of John Carter Brown. Portraits of Lenox were painted by Francis Grant in 1848, and by G. P. A. Healy three years later. He was also painted by Daniel Huntington in 1874.

==Personal life==
Lenox never married. An early love, the only woman to whom he was romantically attached, refused him, and he remained unmarried following her death. The broken romance spurred his increasing reclusiveness. He declined proffered visits from the most distinguished men of the day. An eminent scholar, who was occupied for many weeks in consulting rare books not to be found elsewhere, failed to obtain access to Lenox&#x27;s library. He was assigned an apartment in Lenox&#x27;s spacious mansion, and the works were sent in installments without him ever entering the library or meeting Lenox.

In 1855, there were 19 millionaires in New York. He was the third richest man in New York, worth approximately three million dollars.

Lenox died at his home, 53 Fifth Avenue in New York City, on February 17, 1880. He was buried in the New York City Marble Cemetery. Two of his seven sisters outlived him. Henrietta Lenox, the last survivor, gave the Lenox Library 22 valuable adjoining lots and $100,000 to purchase books. Lenox Avenue in Harlem is named for James Lenox. In addition to several charities, his estate was left to his relations, including his sister, Henrietta A. Lenox, Mary Lenox Sheafe, another sister, and various nephews and nieces, including Elizabeth S. Maitland, James Lenox Belknap, Robert Lenox Banks, James Lenox Banks, Robert Lenox Kennedy (who succeeded him as president of trustees of the Lenox Library), Rachel Lenox Kennedy, and Mary Lenox Kennedy. A portion was also left to grand-nieces and grand-nephews including Alexander Maitland, Eliza Lenox Maitland, Robert Lenox Maitland, and Henry Van Rensselaer Kennedy.

<text>A craton ( , , or ; from &quot;strength&quot;) is an old and stable part of the continental lithosphere, which consists of Earth&#x27;s two topmost layers, the crust and the uppermost mantle. Having often survived cycles of merging and rifting of continents, cratons are generally found in the interiors of tectonic plates; the exceptions occur where geologically recent rifting events have separated cratons and created passive margins along their edges. Cratons are characteristically composed of ancient crystalline basement rock, which may be covered by younger sedimentary rock. They have a thick crust and deep lithospheric roots extending several hundred kilometres into Earth&#x27;s mantle.

== Terminology ==

The term &quot;craton&quot; is used to distinguish the stable portion of the continental crust from regions that are more geologically active and unstable. Cratons are composed of two layers: a continental &quot;shield&quot;, in which the basement rock crops out at the surface, and a &quot;platform&quot; which overlays the shield in some areas with sedimentary rock.

The word &quot;craton&quot; was first proposed by the Austrian geologist Leopold Kober in 1921 as , referring to stable continental platforms, and &quot;orogen&quot; as a term for mountain or orogenic belts. Later Hans Stille shortened the former term to , from which &quot;craton&quot; derives.

== Examples ==
Examples of cratons are the Dharwar Craton in India, North China Craton, the East European Craton, the Amazonian Craton in South America, the Kaapvaal Craton in South Africa, the North American Craton (also called the Laurentia Craton), and the Gawler Craton in South Australia.

== Structure ==
Cratons have thick lithospheric roots. Mantle tomography shows that cratons are underlain by anomalously cold mantle corresponding to lithosphere more than twice the typical thickness of mature oceanic or non-cratonic, continental lithosphere. At that depth, craton roots extend into the asthenosphere, and the low-velocity zone seen elsewhere at these depths is weak or absent beneath stable cratons. Craton lithosphere is distinctly different from oceanic lithosphere because cratons have a neutral or positive buoyancy and a low intrinsic density. This low-density offsets density increases from geothermal contraction and prevents the craton from sinking into the deep mantle. The cratonic lithosphere is much older than the oceanic lithosphere—up to 4 billion years versus 180 million years.

Rock fragments (xenoliths) carried up from the mantle by magmas containing peridotite have been delivered to the surface as inclusions in subvolcanic pipes called kimberlites. These inclusions have densities consistent with craton composition and are composed of mantle material residual from high degrees of partial melt. Peridotite is strongly influenced by the inclusion of moisture. Craton peridotite moisture content is unusually low, which leads to much greater strength. It also contains high percentages of low-weight magnesium instead of higher-weight calcium and iron. Peridotites are important for understanding the deep composition and origin of cratons because peridotite nodules are pieces of mantle rock modified by partial melting. Harzburgite peridotites represent the crystalline residues after extraction of melts of compositions like basalt and komatiite.

== Formation ==

The process by which cratons were formed is called cratonization. Much about this process remains uncertain, with very little consensus in the scientific community. However, the first cratonic landmasses likely formed during the Archean eon. This is indicated by the age of diamonds, which originate in the roots of cratons and are almost always over 2 billion years and often over 3 billion years in age. Rock of the Archean age makes up only 7% of the world&#x27;s current cratons; even allowing for erosion and destruction of past formations, this suggests that only 5 to 40 per cent of the present continental crust formed during the Archean. Cratonization likely was completed during the Proterozoic. Subsequent growth of continents was by accretion at continental margins.

=== Root origin ===
The origin of the roots of cratons is still debated. However, the present understanding of cratonization began with the publication in 1978 of a paper by Thomas H. Jordan in &quot;Nature&quot;. Jordan proposes that cratons formed from a high degree of partial melting of the upper mantle, with 30 to 40 per cent of the source rock entering the melt. Such a high degree of melting was possible because of the high mantle temperatures of the Archean. The extraction of so much magma left behind a solid peridotite residue that was enriched in lightweight magnesium and thus lower in chemical density than the undepleted mantle. This lower chemical density compensated for the effects of thermal contraction as the craton and its roots cooled so that the physical density of the cratonic roots matched that of the surrounding hotter but more chemically dense mantle. In addition to cooling the craton roots and lowering their chemical density, the extraction of magma also increased the viscosity and melting temperature of the craton roots and prevented mixing with the surrounding undepleted mantle. The resulting mantle roots have remained stable for billions of years. Jordan suggests that depletion occurred primarily in subduction zones and secondarily as flood basalts. 

This model of melt extraction from the upper mantle has held up well with subsequent observations. The properties of mantle xenoliths confirm that the geothermal gradient is much lower beneath continents than oceans. The olivine of craton root xenoliths is extremely dry, which would give the roots a very high viscosity. Rhenium–osmium dating of xenoliths indicates that the oldest melting events took place in the early to middle Archean. Significant cratonization continued into the late Archean, accompanied by voluminous mafic magmatism. 

However, melt extraction alone cannot explain all the properties of craton roots. Jordan notes in his paper that this mechanism could be effective for constructing craton roots only down to a depth of . The great depths of craton roots required further explanation. The 30 to 40 per cent partial melting of mantle rock at 4 to 10 GPa pressure produces komatiite magma and a solid residue very close in composition to Archean lithospheric mantle. Still, continental shields do not contain enough komatiite to match the expected depletion. Either much of the komatiite never reached the surface, or other processes aided craton root formation. There are many competing hypotheses of how cratons have been formed.

=== Repeated continental collision model ===
Jordan&#x27;s model suggests that further cratonization resulted from repeated continental collisions. The thickening of the crust associated with these collisions may have been balanced by craton root thickening according to the principle of isostacy. Jordan likens this model to &quot;kneading&quot; of the cratons, allowing low-density material to move up and higher density to move down, creating stable cratonic roots as deep as .

=== Molten plume model ===
A second model suggests that the surface crust was thickened by a rising plume of molten material from the deep mantle. This would have built up a thick layer of depleted mantle underneath the cratons. 

=== Subducting ocean slab model ===
A third model suggests that successive slabs of subducting oceanic lithosphere became lodged beneath a proto-craton, underplating the craton with chemically depleted rock. 

=== Impact origin model ===
A fourth theory presented in a 2015 publication suggests that the origin of the cratons is similar to crustal plateaus observed on Venus, which may have been created by large asteroid impacts. In this model, large impacts on the Earth&#x27;s early lithosphere penetrated deep into the mantle and created enormous lava ponds. The paper suggests these lava ponds cooled to form the craton&#x27;s root. 

=== Evidence for each model ===
The chemistry of xenoliths and seismic tomography both favor the two accretional models over the plume model. However, other geochemical evidence favors mantle plumes. Tomography shows two layers in the craton roots beneath North America. One is found at depths shallower than and may be Archean, while the second is found at depths from and may be younger. The second layer may be a less depleted thermal boundary layer that stagnated against the depleted &quot;lid&quot; formed by the first layer. The impact origin model does not require plumes or accretion; this model is, however, not incompatible with either. 

All these proposed mechanisms rely on buoyant, viscous material separating from a denser residue due to mantle flow, and it is possible that more than one mechanism contributed to craton root formation.

== Erosion ==
The long-term erosion of cratons has been labelled the &quot;cratonic regime&quot;. It involves processes of pediplanation and etchplanation that lead to the formation of flattish surfaces known as peneplains. While the process of etchplanation is associated to humid climate and pediplanation with arid and semi-arid climate, shifting climate over geological time leads to the formation of so-called polygenetic peneplains of mixed origin. Another result of the longevity of cratons is that they may alternate between periods of high and low relative sea levels. High relative sea level leads to increased oceanicity, while the opposite leads to increased inland conditions.

Many cratons have had subdued topographies since Precambrian times. For example, the Yilgarn Craton of Western Australia was flattish already by Middle Proterozoic times and the Baltic Shield had been eroded into a subdued terrain already during the Late Mesoproterozoic when the rapakivi granites intruded.

<text>Chiastic Slide is the fourth studio album by the British electronic music group Autechre, released 17 February 1997 by Warp Records. The album saw the duo continue to move further away from the ambient techno sound of their early releases, employing harsher, glitchier beats. Though not initially met with the same critical acclaim as &quot;Tri Repetae&quot; or &quot;LP5&quot;, &quot;Chiastic Slide&quot; was eventually recognized by critics as an innovative and &quot;enormously influential&quot; album.

==Release==
&quot;Chiastic Slide&quot; was released on 17 February 1997. It did not receive a release in the United States until Warp Records began distributing its own releases there in 2001. Autechre referenced the fourth track, &quot;Cichli&quot;, in the name of their subsequent EP &quot;Cichlisuite&quot; (1997). The sleeve was designed by Sheffield-based design agency The Designers Republic. On 19 November 2021, &quot;Chiastic Slide&quot; was re-released by Warp on vinyl, alongside their next album LP5.

==Reception==

Allmusic critic John Bush panned &quot;Chiastic Slide&quot; as being an underwhelming follow-up to 1995&#x27;s &quot;Tri Repetae&quot;, saying it was too repetitive and lacked ideas. Tim Barr in &quot;Techno: the Rough Guide&quot; called &quot;Chiastic Slide&quot; &quot;The aural equivalent of being at the bottom of the sea.&quot; He went on to say the album was &quot;Dark, claustrophobic... yet full of strange beauty&quot;.

A 2017 &quot;FACT Magazine&quot; retrospective described &quot;Chiastic Slide&quot; as &quot;an enduring classic&quot; that marks &quot;the axis point around which all of Autechre&#x27;s work revolves,&quot; representing a &quot;break from contemporaneous orthodoxy&quot; in electronic music and sound composition. In an interview with &quot;Popular 1 Magazine&quot;, guitarist Kavus Torabi of Cardiacs named &quot;Chiastic Slide&quot; as one of his favourite albums.

<doc id="673753" wikidata="Q1357874" url="?curid=673753" title="Hudson–Bergen Light Rail">
<text>The Hudson–Bergen Light Rail (HBLR) is a light rail system in Hudson County, New Jersey, United States. Owned by New Jersey Transit (NJT) and operated by the 21st Century Rail Corporation, it connects the communities of Bayonne, Jersey City, Hoboken, Weehawken, Union City, at the city line with West New York, and North Bergen.

The system began operating its first segment in April 2000, expanded in phases during the next decade, and was completed with the opening of its southern terminus on January 31, 2011. The line generally runs parallel to the Hudson River and Upper New York Bay, while its northern end and its western branch travel through the lower Hudson Palisades. HBLR has 24 stations along a total track length of for each of its two tracks and serves over 52,000 weekday passengers. Despite its name, the system does not serve Bergen County, into which long-standing plans for expansion have not advanced due to repeated requests for new environmental review reports since 2007.

The project was financed by a mixture of state and federal funding. With an eventual overall cost of approximately $2.2 billion to complete its initial operating segments, the Hudson–Bergen Light Rail was one of the largest ever public works projects in New Jersey. The system is a component of the state&#x27;s &quot;smart growth&quot; strategy to reduce auto-ridership and to revitalize older urban and suburban areas through transit-oriented development.

== History ==
Hudson County, New Jersey, is the sixth-most densely populated county in the U.S. and has one of America&#x27;s highest percentages of public transportation use. During the 1980s and early 1990s, planners and government officials realized that alternative transportation systems needed to be put in place to relieve increasing congestion along the Hudson Waterfront, particularly in the vicinity of the Hudson River crossings. After extensive studies, it was decided that the most efficient and cost-effective system to meet the growing demands of the area would be a light rail system, constructed in several phases.

The design, construction, operation, and maintenance of the system is part of a public-private partnership. In 1996, New Jersey Transit awarded a &quot;DBOM&quot; (design/build/operate/maintain) contract to the 21st Century Rail Corporation, a subsidiary of Washington Group International, an engineering and construction consulting firm later acquired by URS, then AECOM. Under the contract, 21st Century Rail would deliver a fleet of vehicles, a guaranteed completion date, and 15 years of operation and maintenance of the system, for a fixed price. The agreement was later extended to a 20-year period.
Original plans called for extending the Hudson–Bergen Light Rail north to the Vince Lombardi Park &amp; Ride in Ridgefield, south to 5th Street in Bayonne, and west to Droyer&#x27;s Point in Jersey City. In Hoboken, the line was to have originally been configured as a through-running operation, with an alignment built closer to the river which would have given closer access to both the PATH station entrance and the bus terminal. This was shelved in favor of the current stub-end station in the southern end of Hoboken Terminal and the current route along an existing right-of-way at the foot of the Hudson Palisades on the city&#x27;s west side.
The light rail opened to the public on April 15, 2000, with an initial operating segment connecting Bayonne 34th Street and Exchange Place, as well as the spur line to West Side Avenue. Later that year, on November 18, the service was extended northward to Pavonia-Newport. On September 29, 2002, service was extended to Hoboken Terminal, which completed MOS-1, the first Minimum Operating Segment (MOS) of the project, at the cost of $992 million.

MOS-2 involved several extensions costing a combined $1.2 billion. The first extension as part of MOS-2, which brought the light rail system southward to 22nd Street in Bayonne, was opened on November 15, 2003. It also involved extending the line west and north of Hoboken Terminal into Weehawken. The line was completed to Lincoln Harbor on September 7, 2004, and to Port Imperial on weekends only on October 29, 2005. The line was extended from Port Imperial to Tonnelle Avenue in North Bergen on February 25, 2006, and light rail vehicles began running seven days a week to Tonnelle Avenue. Bus service on connecting routes was modified so that there would be more direct connections to Hudson–Bergen Light Rail stations. The extension to a southern terminal at 8th Street opened January 31, 2011, at a cost of $100 million.

Service on the West Side Branch was suspended starting in June 2019 to allow for repairs to a sewer line running along the right-of-way. Partial service was restored on the branch in April 2020 to the Garfield Avenue and Martin Luther King Dr. stations while the West Side Avenue station remained closed due to ongoing Bayfront-Route 440 extension construction. Full service to the West Side Avenue station resumed in May 2020.

== Service ==
=== Routes ===
There are 24 stations along the routes within the system. Trains run from approximately 5 a.m. to 1 a.m. daily.

* West Side–Tonnelle between West Side Avenue in Jersey City and Tonnelle Avenue in North Bergen
* Hoboken–Tonnelle (weekdays only) between Hoboken Terminal and Tonnelle Avenue
* 8th Street–Hoboken, between 8th Street in Bayonne and Hoboken Terminal
* Bayonne Flyer, (weekday rush hours) between 8th Street in Bayonne and Hoboken Terminal, stopping at all Bayonne stations, Liberty State Park (&quot;southbound only&quot;), Essex Street, Exchange Place, Harborside Financial Center, and Newport

=== Stations ===
Many of the stations feature public art. A total of 30 artists have created 50 art works with various themes for the stations. For example, the Liberty State Park station features glass tiles representing a number of &quot;fallen flag&quot; railroad logos.

Park and ride lots are available at East 22nd Street, East 34th Street, West Side Avenue, Liberty State Park and Tonnelle Avenue. In total, there are 3,880 parking spaces.

Paid transfer to the Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) is possible at Exchange Place, Newport and Hoboken Terminal, where connections to NJT commuter rail service are also available. Paid transfer to New York Waterway ferries is also available at some stations. NJT and other buses serve most stations.
== Fares ==
Like most other light rail services in the United States, the HBLR operates on a proof-of-payment system, in which riders must present their tickets upon request during random fare inspections. Passengers must purchase tickets at NJ Transit ticket vending machines (TVMs) on or near station platforms or from the NJ Transit app. One-way, round-trip, and ten-trip tickets must then be validated at automated validators located near the TVMs, which date and time stamp the ticket for 60 minutes of use. NJ Transit&#x27;s fare inspectors randomly check tickets on trains and at stations; , the fine for fare evasion is $100.

, a one-way adult fare is $2.55. A monthly, unlimited pass is $80; holders of monthly passes can transfer to NJ Transit local buses without an additional fare. Senior citizens (62 and older; valid ID may be requested), passengers with disabilities, and children under 12 may travel on the light rail at a reduced fare of $1.25. The option to purchase a combined bus and light rail fare has been removed. Valid NJ Transit weekly and monthly rail passes, as well as 2-zone or greater bus passes, are also good for travel and do not need validation. Like the rest of NJ Transit&#x27;s other transportation modes, it does not accept the MetroCard nor OMNY although it has plans to create a new fare payment system in the future.

In May 2012, NJ Transit and NY Waterway introduced a monthly or ten-trip discounted combination fare for passengers using the HBLR and ferry at Weehawken Port Imperial. Monthly joint tickets are also available for ferry passengers using slips at Lincoln Harbor and 14th Street (Hoboken).

In February 2013, NJ Transit began offering free weekend parking at Tonnelle Avenue, Liberty State Park, West Side Avenue, 34th Street and 45th Street stations.

== Infrastructure ==

The Hudson–Bergen Light Rail system uses a combination of old rail and new exclusive rights-of-way for most of its length, with some grade separation in certain areas. It shares a lane with automobiles on a portion of Essex Street in downtown Jersey City, but for the most part, does not operate with other traffic. At-grade crossings are equipped with transit-signal priority signals to automatically change traffic lights in favor of the light rail.

A new curved viaduct was constructed eastward from 8th Street to 11th Street in Bayonne to join the existing right-of way to Liberty State Park, which was once the main line of the Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ), parts of which rest on the bed of the Morris Canal; CNJ&#x27;s Newark and New York Branch right-of-way was used for the line west to West Side Avenue. From Liberty State Park to Hoboken Terminal the line uses a new right-of-way. From the terminal to the curve south of 2nd Street, the line runs parallel to NJT yard and tracks, formerly the main line of the Lackawanna Railroad; north of the curve it uses what had been Conrail&#x27;s River Line, and was originally the New Jersey Junction Railroad. In order to obtain the right-of-way for the line north from Hoboken, NJT paid to upgrade the Northern Running Track, allowing Conrail to shift its operations. The tunnel and cut through the Palisades were originally the West Shore Railroad&#x27;s main line.

== Rolling stock ==
The Hudson–Bergen Light Rail system has 52 electrically powered air-conditioned vehicles built by Kinki Sharyo and numbered in the 2000 series. The cars were assembled in Harrison, New Jersey. The original fleet consisted of 54 cars, but 2 cars were transferred to the Newark Light Rail. Each vehicle is long and has four sets of double-opening doors on each side, with seats for 68 passengers and standing room for another 122 passengers.

The Newark Light Rail system uses the same type of vehicle, with slight modifications to the trucks and wheels due to the different rails used.

On July 3, 2013, NJ Transit released lengthened light rail car 2054 as a prototype. The expanded car consists of two new sections, increasing length by to a total of . Seating capacity is increased from 68 passengers to 102 passengers, with standing capacity increased accordingly as well. Overall capacity increases from approximately 200 per vehicle to 300 per vehicle. The prototype was placed on rotations through the three lines of the system over the next 6 months, after which, NJ Transit started to expand 26 cars in total, or half of the total fleet. The contract to expand the remaining balance of 25 cars was approved on July 9, 2014. The expanded cars were renumbered to the 5000 series.

== Proposed expansions ==

=== Route 440/Bayfront ===

In May 2011 NJT announced a plan for extension of the West Side Branch. The project, which requires the approval of the metropolitan planning organization, North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority, to be eligible for federal funding, is estimated to cost $171.6 million. The extension is part of a broader plan to transform the far West Side of Jersey City from previous industrial uses to mixed-use communities that also includes the development of the West Campus of New Jersey City University (currently under construction) and conversion of Route 440 to an urban boulevard.

As of March 2017, funding for final design and engineering work was appropriated. In December 2017, NJ Transit approved a $5 million preliminary engineering contract for the extension project. Construction on the first phase of the extension began in March 2020.

=== 18th Street, Jersey City ===
The results of the Jersey City/Hoboken Connectivity Study published in June 2011 identified the target area at southwestern Hoboken, Lower Jersey City, and Jersey City Heights as a potential site for a new station. The HBLR runs at the foot the Hudson Palisades under NJT&#x27;s Hoboken Terminal lines with the 2nd Street station north of the ROW. The district is characterized as having an irregular street grid (including colonial-era Paterson Plank Road and Newark Plank Road), being heavily congested (often with Holland Tunnel–bound traffic) and undergoing transition to a residential/commercial uses. In September 2012, a walkway/bike path was completed near the site of the proposed station, providing better pedestrian access to it and the nearby 2nd St. station. It was announced in October 2012 that NJT had received a $400,000 grant to study the possibility of building a new station at 18th Street in Jersey City, just south of the municipal border and NJT commuter rail ROW.

In January 2020, the City of Jersey City began to consider 3.5% tax on public and private parking facilities to help fund the construction of a new light rail station at 18th Street.

A 2021 proposal by Lefrak to build a two-tower mixed use development along the light rail ROW between Jersey Avenue &amp; Grove Street including a light rail station, potentially funded in part by the developer.

=== Northwest Hoboken ===

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, NJT approved plans in June 2013 for a new light rail station in northwestern Hoboken, near property owned by the Rockefeller Group, which wanted to build a 40-story office tower in that area near the city&#x27;s northern border with Weehawken. This agreement was not made known to the local government. but came to light after Mayor of Hoboken Dawn Zimmer, appearing on MSNBC on January 18, 2014, claimed that Lt Governor Kim Guadagno and Richard Constable, director of the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs, had earlier insinuated to her that more Sandy relief funds would be released to the city if it approved the project proposed by Rockefeller. The agreement is dated June 21, 2014. The plans showed a station at 17th Street and Clinton Street.

In January 2020, Mayor Ravinder Bhalla met with representatives of NJ Transit to discuss a potential new station in the area. It included in city&#x27;s North End master plan.

=== Northern Branch/Bergen County ===
Despite its name, the Hudson–Bergen Light Rail only serves Hudson County. The Northern Branch is a proposed extension from the current northern terminus at Tonnelle Avenue using the right of way of the former Erie Northern Branch into eastern Bergen County with a new terminus at the Englewood Hospital and Medical Center. Stops would be added at 91st Street in North Bergen, Fairview, Ridgefield, Palisades Park, Leonia, and Englewood, with stops at Englewood Route 4 and Englewood Town Center.

An earlier proposal to use diesel multiple unit (DMU) vehicles was later abandoned in favor of the electrically operated system used by HBLR as were proposals to extend the line into Tenafly. The estimated cost of the project is $1.18 billion, though funding has not been secured. An initial $40 million has been allocated for design, engineering and environmental studies. The project requires approval of an environmental impact statement and Federal Transit Administration approval. Funding for completion if the environmental study, expected to take two years, was approved by NJ Transit in May 2013. After being stalled funding for the project was thought to finally be proceeding in 2017, but no progress was made. 

=== Canal Crossing ===
The two branches of the HBLR system create the northern and eastern borders of Canal Crossing, a planned New Urbanist community in Jersey City. A new station at Caven Point Avenue is proposed on the Bayonne line along its eastern perimeter between current stations at Richard Street and Liberty State Park. A feasibility study conducted in 2012 found that though the construction of a station at Caven Point Avenue was theoretically possible, it would be much more expensive than the average light rail station, while the projected ridership would be relatively low in the near-term.

=== Secaucus Junction/Meadowlands ===

There have been discussions to extend the system westward to either or both Secaucus Junction, a major interchange station of New Jersey Transit rail operations, and to the Meadowlands Sports Complex (MSC). Possible routes include one from Downtown Jersey City, via the Harsimus Stem Embankment and Bergen Arches, or an extension of the line from Tonnelle Avenue.

Several studies have been conducted to determine the best future use of the Bergen Arches, the former Erie Railroad cut through Bergen Hill in Jersey City. A freeway proposed in 1989 by Governor Thomas Kean was strongly supported by then-Mayor Bret Schundler. In 1998, this project was allocated $26 million in the federal Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century. During the 2001 mayoral race candidates instead lobbied for a mass transit line, and in 2002 the plans were dropped during Mayor Cunningham&#x27;s administration. In that year, Parsons Brinckerhoff, a consulting firm, released another report commission by the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) describing the conditions and analysis of various options. NJDOT has continued to fund studies for the project. In March 2011, an additional $13.4 million was allocated to advance the project.

In the first decade of the 21st century, studies sponsored by the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority were conducted to address mass transit options to the MSC, including the possible extension of HBLR from its northern terminus through Secaucus and across the Hackensack River.
At the time it was estimated that the extension would cost $1 billion. When it was decided to build a rail spur in 2004, state officials said that an HBLR extension was not ruled out as a future possibility. The Meadowlands Rail Line was eventually opened in 2009.

In 2022, state introduced a plan for a new east-bound Route 3 Bridge over the Hackensack River. Pilings would support a light rail extension, though no there is no projected timeline for service.

=== Bayonne Bridge/Staten Island ===

The Bayonne Bridge connects Bayonne and Staten Island, a borough of New York City. The bridge was originally built to accommodate two extra lanes that could be used for light rail service. In the 2010s the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey raised the roadbed of the bridge by , in order to provide the clearance required by the newer post-panamax container ships to pass under it. Final plans for the reconstructed bridge eventually did not include a rail element.

In September 2007, the S89 limited-stop bus service was introduced between Richmond Avenue in Staten Island and the 34th Street HBLR station. , it runs only during the weekday peak period.

While not having begun any studies, New Jersey Transit investigated the feasibility of extending HBLR from the 8th Street Station across the raised bridge. An academic study has been produced in the &quot;Journal of Public Transportation&quot;. Completing any such extension would involve a collaboration between NJ Transit, New York State, and New York City. The development of a Staten Island light rail system which could connect with the HBLR system gained political support in New York. US Senator Robert Menendez supported the HBLR extension conceptually, but questioned the benefit for New Jersey. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority&#x27;s 2015–2019 Capital Plan was amended in May 2017 to allocate $4 million to study the potential extension.

=== Liberty State Park trolley ===
Shuttle bus service formerly operated from the Liberty State Park station to the waterfront Central Railroad of New Jersey Terminal in Liberty State Park. However, this service no longer runs, and as a result, there is a relatively long walk to access the Central Railroad terminal via mass transit. Since at least 2010, there have been proposals to build a trolley line to the Central Railroad terminal building and other points in the park from the Liberty State Park Station light rail station to improve access. The Liberty Historic Railway organization is also attempting to jump start the construction of this trolley line. As of 2020, the Liberty Historic Railway Organization has ceased all work on the Liberty State Park trolley proposal as a result of the damage the park received from Hurricane Sandy and how vulnerable any rail infrastructure within the park associated with the proposed trolley would be to future storm surges.

== Transit-oriented development and urban revitalization ==
The light rail has been a catalyst for both residential and commercial development along the route and has played a significant role in the revitalization of Hudson County. Many of the stops are sited in vacant or underutilized areas, which are now beginning to see intense residential and mixed-use development. The line running along Essex Street in downtown Jersey City has spawned 3,000 residential units in five years. An tract of land bordering Liberty State Park is being redeveloped into a transit-oriented development known as Liberty Harbor North, which will consist of 6,000 residential units and millions of square feet of commercial space. Two New Urbanism projects in Jersey City, Bayfront and Canal Crossing, are being planned with the expectation that new stations will be built in conjunction with their development. Other developments are either planned or already underway in Hoboken, Union City, Bayonne, and Weehawken, in areas very near to light rail stations.

<doc id="673768" wikidata="Q858571" url="?curid=673768" title="Continental crust">
<text>Continental crust is the layer of igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks that forms the geological continents and the areas of shallow seabed close to their shores, known as &quot;continental shelves&quot;. This layer is sometimes called &quot;sial&quot; because its bulk composition is richer in aluminium silicates (Al-Si) and has a lower density compared to the oceanic crust, called &quot;sima&quot; which is richer in magnesium silicate (Mg-Si) minerals. Changes in seismic wave velocities have shown that at a certain depth (the Conrad discontinuity), there is a reasonably sharp contrast between the more felsic upper continental crust and the lower continental crust, which is more mafic in character.

Most continental crust is dry land above sea level. However, 94% of the Zealandia continental crust region is submerged beneath the Pacific Ocean, with New Zealand constituting 93% of the above-water portion.

==Thickness and density ==
The continental crust consists of various layers, with a bulk composition that is intermediate (SiO2 wt% = 60.6). The average density of the continental crust is about, , less dense than the ultramafic material that makes up the mantle, which has a density of around . Continental crust is also less dense than oceanic crust, whose density is about . At in thickness, continental crust is considerably thicker than oceanic crust, which has an average thickness of around . Approximately 41% of Earth&#x27;s surface area and about 70% of the volume of Earth&#x27;s crust are continental crust.

== Importance ==
Because the surface of continental crust mainly lies above sea level, its existence allowed land life to evolve from marine life. Its existence also provides broad expanses of shallow water known as epeiric seas and continental shelves where complex metazoan life could become established during early Paleozoic time, in what is now called the Cambrian explosion.

==Origin==
All continental crust is ultimately derived from mantle-derived melts (mainly basalt) through fractional differentiation of basaltic melt and the assimilation (remelting) of pre-existing continental crust. The relative contributions of these two processes in creating continental crust are debated, but fractional differentiation is thought to play the dominant role. These processes occur primarily at magmatic arcs associated with subduction.

There is little evidence of continental crust prior to 3.5 Ga. About 20% of the continental crust&#x27;s current volume was formed by 3.0 Ga. There was relatively rapid development on shield areas consisting of continental crust between 3.0 and 2.5 Ga. During this time interval, about 60% of the continental crust&#x27;s current volume was formed. The remaining 20% has formed during the last 2.5 Ga.

Proponents of a steady-state hypothesis argue that the total volume of continental crust has remained more or less the same after early rapid planetary differentiation of Earth and that presently found age distribution is just the result of the processes leading to the formation of cratons (the parts of the crust clustered in cratons being less likely to be reworked by plate tectonics). However, this is not generally accepted.

== Forces at work ==
In contrast to the persistence of continental crust, the size, shape, and number of continents are constantly changing through geologic time. Different tracts rift apart, collide and recoalesce as part of a grand supercontinent cycle.

There are currently about of continental crust, but this quantity varies because of the nature of the forces involved. The relative permanence of continental crust contrasts with the short life of oceanic crust. Because continental crust is less dense than oceanic crust, when active margins of the two meet in subduction zones, the oceanic crust is typically subducted back into the mantle. Continental crust is rarely subducted (this may occur where continental crustal blocks collide and overthicken, causing deep melting under mountain belts such as the Himalayas or the Alps). For this reason the oldest rocks on Earth are within the cratons or cores of the continents, rather than in repeatedly recycled oceanic crust; the oldest intact crustal fragment is the Acasta Gneiss at 4.01 Ga, whereas the oldest large-scale oceanic crust (located on the Pacific plate offshore of the Kamchatka Peninsula) is from the Jurassic (≈180 Ma), although there might be small older remnants in the Mediterranean Sea at about 340 Ma. Continental crust and the rock layers that lie on and within it are thus the best archive of Earth&#x27;s history.

The height of mountain ranges is usually related to the thickness of crust. This results from the isostasy associated with orogeny (mountain formation). The crust is thickened by the compressive forces related to subduction or continental collision. The buoyancy of the crust forces it upwards, the forces of the collisional stress balanced by gravity and erosion. This forms a keel or mountain root beneath the mountain range, which is where the thickest crust is found. The thinnest continental crust is found in rift zones, where the crust is thinned by detachment faulting and eventually severed, replaced by oceanic crust. The edges of continental fragments formed this way (both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, for example) are termed passive margins.

The high temperatures and pressures at depth, often combined with a long history of complex distortion, cause much of the lower continental crust to be metamorphic – the main exception to this being recent igneous intrusions. Igneous rock may also be &quot;underplated&quot; to the underside of the crust, i.e. adding to the crust by forming a layer immediately beneath it.

Continental crust is produced and (far less often) destroyed mostly by plate tectonic processes, especially at convergent plate boundaries. Additionally, continental crustal material is transferred to oceanic crust by sedimentation. New material can be added to the continents by the partial melting of oceanic crust at subduction zones, causing the lighter material to rise as magma, forming volcanoes. Also, material can be accreted horizontally when volcanic island arcs, seamounts or similar structures collide with the side of the continent as a result of plate tectonic movements. Continental crust is also lost through erosion and sediment subduction, tectonic erosion of forearcs, delamination, and deep subduction of continental crust in collision zones. Many theories of crustal growth are controversial, including rates of crustal growth and recycling, whether the lower crust is recycled differently from the upper crust, and over how much of Earth history plate tectonics has operated and so could be the dominant mode of continental crust formation and destruction.

It is a matter of debate whether the amount of continental crust has been increasing, decreasing, or remaining constant over geological time. One model indicates that at prior to 3.7 Ga ago continental crust constituted less than 10% of the present amount. By 3.0 Ga ago the amount was about 25%, and following a period of rapid crustal evolution it was about 60% of the current amount by 2.6 Ga ago. The growth of continental crust appears to have occurred in &quot;spurts&quot; of increased activity corresponding to five episodes of increased production through geologic time.

<text>Pet Rock is a collectible toy made in 1975 by advertising executive Gary Dahl. They were rocks packaged in custom cardboard boxes complete with ventilation holes and straw bedding imitating a pet carrier. The fad lasted about six months, ending after a short increase in sales during the Christmas season of December 1975. Although by February 1976 they were discounted due to lower sales, Dahl sold over one million Pet Rocks for $4 each, and became a millionaire.

== History ==
Gary Dahl came up with the idea in a bar while listening to his friends complain about their pets; this gave him the idea for the perfect &quot;pet&quot;: a rock. A rock would not need to be fed, walked, bathed, or groomed, and it would not die, become sick, or be disobedient. Dahl said that they were to be the perfect pets and joked about it with his friends before eventually producing Pet Rocks as toys in 1975.

In 2022, the toy company Super Impulse purchased the rights to the Pet Rock, reviving the brand. In the 2020s, Pet Rocks grew in popularity in South Korea as tools for meditation or venting out frustrations. Members of K-pop groups such as Seventeen and Enhypen are noted to post about their Pet Rocks online.

== Cultural impact and legacy ==
The Pet Rock has had a lasting impact on popular culture. The character Zoe from &quot;Sesame Street&quot; owns a pet rock called Rocco. A video of Elmo from &quot;Sesame Street&quot; shouting at Rocco went viral in early 2022.

In the film &quot;&quot;, the character Otto acquires a Pet Rock. He trades the zodiac stone for it, an integral point of the plot. To promote the film, Sabec Limited released an official Pet Rock video game for Nintendo Switch. A Funko Pop depicting Otto with his Pet Rock was also released.

A24 produced an official licensed Pet Rock as a tie-in for the film &quot;Everything Everywhere All at Once.&quot; This version of the Pet Rock has a pair of googly eyes attached in reference to a scene from that film. Also included are the straw bedding and instructions of the original, and a new version of the ventilated box printed with scenery from the film.

The video game &quot;&quot; features a Pet Rock named Dwayne.

In the 1999 movie &quot;Office Space&quot; the characters discuss the Pet Rock, with one of the characters admiring Dahl&#x27;s initiative, stating &quot;the guy made a million dollars&quot;, then discussing a similar, gimmicky product he would like to sell himself.

In the MMORPG &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; Pet Rocks are obtainable items with no purpose.

During the travels of the Perseverance rover on Mars, NASA scientists had observed around Sol 341 (February 4, 2022) that a small rock had dropped into one of its wheels. The rock was visible from one of the hazard avoidance cameras, and was determined not to be harmful to the rover&#x27;s mission. The rock has since stayed on &quot;Perseverance&quot;″s wheel for around 427 sols (439 days) as the rover traveled over on the Martian surface. NASA deemed that &quot;Perseverance&quot; had adopted a pet rock for its journey. Later the rover picked up another pet rock named &quot;Dwayne&quot;.

<doc id="673771" wikidata="Q2668301" url="?curid=673771" title="Mood ring">
<text>A mood ring is a finger ring that contains a thermochromic element, or &quot;mood stone&quot;, that changes colors based on the temperature of the finger of the wearer. Finger temperature, as long as the ambient temperature is relatively constant, is significantly determined by peripheral blood flow. A mood ring contains liquid crystals that change color depending on the temperature.

== History ==
The idea to use thermosensitive elements in jewelry first arose from the American jeweler Marvin Wernick in 1974 after reading a magazine article about the use of liquid crystal elements in medical thermometers. He found a compound that changed color from black to green, blue and deep blue in the range of 32–38 °C and in January 1975 developed a technique for using it in pendants and rings. Sales began in February. Wernick called the jewelry &quot;magical&quot;, and his promotional materials claimed that the color of the pendant or ring is an indicator of the warmth of the wearer&#x27;s character. Since Wernick did not patent the invention, other jewelers adopted the idea and began to produce their thermosensitive jewelry. Soon someone came up with a successful term &quot;mood ring&quot;, which was quickly adopted by all manufacturers, including Wernick.

Important producers of &quot;mood rings&quot; were Joshua Reynolds and Maris Ambats; many sources credit them as their inventor. Reynolds called the rings &quot;a real biofeedback tool&quot; that allows a person to get additional information about their body. In December 1975 the total value of the rings sold reached $15 million. However, in mid-December, the demand for rings suddenly fell as the market was oversaturated, and companies that did not have time to sell rings suffered losses. After a couple of years, &quot;mood rings&quot; went out of fashion.

<text>The Na&#x27;aman (, &quot;Nahal Na&#x27;aman&quot;) or Na&#x27;mein River (, &quot;Nahr Na&#x27;mein&quot;) is a stream in northwestern Israel. To the ancient writers Pliny, Tacitus, and Josephus, it was known as the Belus (Latin) or Belos River (, &quot;Bē̂los&quot;) of Phoenicia.

==Course==
The Na&#x27;aman River originates from springs near Ein Afek (primarily Ein Nymphit) and flows through the Zebulun Valley from south to north before emptying into the Bay of Haifa (formerly Bay of Acre) south of Acre (Akko) on the Mediterranean Sea. It previously flowed directly south of Tel Akko (the site of ancient Acre) but has shifted over time to be about away.

The En Afek Nature Reserve near the Haifa Bay suburb of Kiryat Bialik, is the last remnant of the Nahal Na&#x27;aman wetlands.

==History==
Once known as Belus or Belos, the river is mentioned by Isidore of Seville. According to the legend, this is where glass-making was invented. Tacitus also mentions glassmaking at the Belus. Pliny the Elder (&quot;Natural History&quot;, 5.19), using the name &#x27;Pacida&#x27;, mentions that the river flowed from Lake Cendevia (now below Mount Carmel) for to the sea near &quot;Ptolemais Ace&quot; (Acre, Israel), and that it was celebrated for its vitreous sands. The name is based on &quot;Baal&quot;.

<text>Belus or Belos in classical Greek or classical Latin texts (and later material based on them) in an Assyrian context refers to one or another purportedly ancient and historically mythical Assyrian king, such king in part at least a euhemerization of the Babylonian god Bel Marduk. It is likely that this Assyrian Belus should mostly not be distinguished from the euhemerized Babylonian Belus, but some chronographers make a distinction between them.
==Genealogy==
===Father of Ninus===
Belus most commonly appears as the father of Ninus, who otherwise mostly appears as the first known Assyrian king. Ctesias provides no information about Ninus&#x27; parentage. But already in Herodotus there is a Ninus son of Belus among the ancestors of the Heraclid dynasty of Lydia, though here Belus is strangely and uniquely made a grandson of Heracles. See Omphale#Sons of Heracles in Lydia for discussion.

Belus elsewhere is a vague, ancestral figure. It was suggested in &quot;The Two Babylons&quot; by Alexander Hislop that he was originally a conqueror who fathered king Ninus the first, and that after Ninus&#x27; death his wife Semiramis began to claim Ninus as a Sun god, Cush (Belus) as the Lord God, herself as the mother goddess and her son Tammuz as the god of love, in an effort to control her subjects better after the death of her husband, and to allow her to rule as her newborn son&#x27;s regent.

===Other mentions===
Some versions of the tale of Adonis make Adonis the son of Theias or Thias the King of Assyria, who is the son of Belus.

Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; (4.212f) speaks of King Orchamus who ruled the Achaemenid cities of Persia as the 7th in line from ancient Belus the founder. But no other extant sources mention either Orchamus or his daughters Leucothoe and Clytie.

Nonnus in his &quot;Dionysiaca&quot; (18.5f) brings in King Staphylus of Assyria and his son Botrys who entertain Dionysus, characters unknown elsewhere. Staphylus claims to be grandson of Belus.

===Sibling===
Diodorus Siculus (6.5.1) introduces the Roman god Picus (normally son of Saturn) as a king of Italy and calls him brother of Ninus (and therefore perhaps son of Belus).

==Titanomachy==
The odd connection between Picus and Ninus appears in John of Nikiû&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle&quot; (6.2f) which relates that Cronus was the first king of Assyria and Persia, that he married an Assyrian woman named Rhea. They had two sons, Picus (who was also called Zeus), and Ninus who founded the city of Ninus (Nineveh). Cronus removed to Italy but was then slain by his son Zeus Picus because he devoured his children. Then Zeus became the father of Belus by his own sister. After the disappearance of Zeus Picus (who apparently reigned over both Italy and Assyria), Belus son of Zeus Picus succeeded to the throne in Assyria (later Faunus who is elsewhere always the son of Picus reigns in Italy before moving to Egypt and turning into Hermes Trismegistus father of Hephaestus). Upon the death of Belus, his uncle Ninus became king and then married his own mother who was previously called Rhea but is now reintroduced under the name of Semiramis. It is explained that from that time on this custom was maintained so that Persians allegedly thought nothing of taking a mother or sister or daughter as a wife.
A fragment by Castor of Rhodes, preserved only in the Armenian translation of Eusebius of Caesarea, makes Belus king of Assyria at the time when Zeus and the other gods fought first the Titans and then the Giants. Castor says Belus was considered a god after his death, but that he does not know how many years Belus reigned.

==Later accounts==
Later historians and chronographers make no mention of such stories. They either do not mention Belus at all or accept him as father of Ninus. They also dispute as to whether the Biblical Nimrod was the same as Belus, the father of Belus or a more distant ancestor of Belus.

<doc id="673791" wikidata="Q7727472" url="?curid=673791" title="The Continental (Saturday Night Live)">
<text>&quot;The Continental&quot; is a recurring sketch on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (SNL) featuring Christopher Walken. The first sketch aired on the eleventh episode of the fifteenth season, January 20, 1990.

==History==
It is a parody of Renzo Cesana, who starred in a 1952–1953 CBS series, &quot;The Continental&quot;. The series used a subjective camera, and Cesana spoke directly to women in the viewing audience. Cesana&#x27;s show was subjected to many parodies, including &quot;Mad&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The Countynental&quot; (which was also the name used in a parody by Ernie Kovacs), Red Skelton&#x27;s &quot;The Transcontinental&quot;, and Floyd Vivino&#x27;s &quot;Ricardo Romantico.&quot;

The premise of the &quot;SNL&quot; sketch is that Walken is a &quot;suave &quot; who in reality can&#x27;t say or do anything to keep women from giving him the cold shoulder, typically due to a number of perverse actions that often border on sexual predation. For instance, he invites a woman to wash up in his bathroom. Once she is inside, it becomes obvious that the bathroom mirror is a two-way mirror when the Continental is seen lighting up a cigarette. 

The Continental has both a periscope with which to &quot;spy&quot; on his upstairs neighbor and a collection of &quot;erotic&quot; Hummel figurines he acquired on eBay. These sketches are always shot from the woman&#x27;s point of view, so we never see her face, just her gloved arms as she pushes him out of her way. Whenever he offers her a glass of champagne or, as he calls it, &quot;champagna&quot; , she invariably ends up throwing it in his face. The character also has the catchphrase of &quot;Wow! Wowie-wow-wow-wow!&quot; which is usually said at some point when the woman has physically shown she has no interest in him, only for him to become even more aroused by her &quot;tempestuousness&quot;.

In 2002, Walken was quoted as saying that he would like to do a &quot;Continental&quot; movie. &quot;The problem with the Continental is that he never leaves his house. But it might be interesting to see the Continental go out and nothing works. He&#x27;s a social catastrophe. I think that would be interesting.&quot;

==Phil Hartman==
The voice-over at the beginning of the sketch is provided by Phil Hartman and has been used three times since his death in 1998.

<text>Jack Selig Yellen (Jacek Jeleń; July 6, 1892 – April 17, 1991) was an American lyricist and screenwriter. He is best remembered for writing the lyrics to the songs &quot;Happy Days Are Here Again&quot;, which was used by Franklin Roosevelt as the theme song for his successful 1932 presidential campaign, and &quot;Ain&#x27;t She Sweet&quot;, a Tin Pan Alley standard.

==Early life and education==
Born to a Jewish family in Raczki, Congress Poland, then part of the Russian Empire, Yellen emigrated with his family to the United States when he was five years old. His parents were Abram and Bessie Yellen. The oldest of seven children, he was raised in Buffalo, New York, and began writing songs in high school. He graduated with honors from the University of Michigan in 1913 where he was a member of the Pi Lambda Phi fraternity.

After graduating he became a reporter for the &quot;Buffalo Courier&quot;, continuing to write songs on the side.

==Career==
Yellen&#x27;s first collaborator on a song was George L. Cobb, with whom he wrote a number of Dixie songs including &quot;Alabama Jubilee&quot;, &quot;Are You From Dixie?&quot;, and &quot;All Aboard for Dixieland&quot;. He is best remembered for his collaboration with composer Milton Ager. He and Ager entered the music publishing business as part owners of the Ager-Yellen-Bornstein Music Company. Yellen also worked with many other composers such as Sammy Fain and Harold Arlen.

Yellen&#x27;s collaboration with vaudeville star, Sophie Tucker, for whom he was retained to write special material, produced one of Tucker&#x27;s most well known songs, &quot;My Yiddishe Momme&quot;, a song in English with some Yiddish text. Yellen wrote the lyrics which were set to music by Lew Pollack.
Yellen wrote the lyrics to more than 200 popular songs of the early 20th century. Two of his most recognized songs, still popular in the 21st century, are &quot;Happy Days Are Here Again&quot; and &quot;Ain&#x27;t She Sweet&quot;.

Yellen&#x27;s screenwriting credits included:
==Awards and legacy==
Yellen was one of the earliest members of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) and served on its board of directors from 1951 to 1969. In 1972 he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the Buffalo Music Hall of Fame in 1996.

The foundation created by Yellen and his second wife, The Lucille and Jack Yellen Foundation, established the ASCAP Foundation Lucille and Jack Yellen Award, an annual award for &quot;aspiring musical theater lyricist or film scorer who exemplifies talent and career potential&quot;.

==Personal life==
In August 1922, Yellen married 21 year old Sylvia Stiller of Buffalo. They had two children, David and Beth.
In 1944 he married his second wife, Lucille Hodgeman. Lucille was born in Minnesota in 1915 and raised in Los Angeles. As a dancer and choreographer, she worked with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and 20th Century Fox under the stage name Lucille Day on over 20 films, including &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. The Yellens lived for many years on a farm on Mortons Corners Road in the town of Concord, New York. Jack Yellen died April 17, 1991, in Concord at the age of 98. Lucille Yellen died on August 15, 2010, at age 95.

<doc id="673794" wikidata="Q7661190" url="?curid=673794" title="Symbolic speech">
<text>Symbolic speech is a legal term in United States law used to describe actions that purposefully and discernibly convey a particular message or statement to those viewing it. Symbolic speech is recognized as being protected under the First Amendment as a form of speech, but this is not expressly written as such in the document. One possible explanation as to why the Framers did not address this issue in the Bill of Rights is because the primary forms for both political debate and protest in their time were verbal expression and published word, and they may have been unaware of the possibility of future people using non-verbal expression. Symbolic speech is distinguished from pure speech, which is the communication of ideas through spoken or written words or through conduct limited in form to that necessary to convey the idea.

While First Amendment protections originally only applied to laws passed by Congress, these protections on symbolic speech have also applied to state governments since &quot;Gitlow v. New York&quot;, which established the basis for the incorporation of First Amendment rights into state jurisdictions.

== Tests for protection ==
=== O&#x27;Brien test ===
While writing the majority opinion for &quot;United States v. O&#x27;Brien&quot;, Chief Justice Warren described a series of guidelines used to determine whether a law that restricts speech violates the First Amendment. These guidelines must remain neutral in relation to the subject of the speech at hand (e.g., a speech that criticizes government action and is believed to violate a law must be treated the same way as a speech under identical circumstance, but praising the government as opposed to criticizing.) The &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot; test is not meant to be the absolute deciding factor in cases involving non-verbal speech, but an additional tool to invoke against prohibitions.

The &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot; test is thus: The law in question must
* be within the Constitutional power of the government to enact.
* further an important or substantial government interest.
** That interest must be unrelated to the suppression of speech (or &quot;content neutral&quot;, as phrased in later cases)
** Prohibit no more speech than is essential to further that interest.

=== Spence test ===
In the &quot;per curiam&quot; decision of &quot;Spence v. Washington&quot;, the Court developed a two-prong test to determine if symbolic speech qualified for First Amendment protections. Under the Spence test, the action must:
* have an intent to convey a particularized message was present, and
* in the surrounding circumstances the likelihood was great that the message would be understood by those who viewed it.

The Spence test was affirmed in &quot;Texas v. Johnson&quot;, though without focus on the &quot;surrounding circumstances&quot; phrase. However, &quot;Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Group of Boston&quot; challenged whether a &quot;particularized message&quot; must be present. There has been a circuit split between whether &quot;Spence&quot; or &quot;Hurley&quot; apply.

==Major cases==
===&quot;Tinker v. Des Moines&quot;===

In December 1965, a group of five students, including lead plaintiff John Tinker and his sister Mary Beth Tinker, wore black armbands overlaid with a white peace sign between December 16 and New Years Day. The principals of the students&#x27; schools had previously threatened to suspend any students who participated in the protest. Despite the warning, the small group of students proceeded to carry out their dissent, and were duly suspended. ACLU attorneys representing the students argued that the armbands constituted a form of symbolic speech and, because their demonstration was suppressed, their First Amendment rights were unconstitutionally restrained. The court voted 7–2 in favor of Tinker, finding that the suspension had violated the students&#x27; First Amendment rights. Justice Fortas, delivering the opinion of the court, held the following:
*&quot;In wearing armbands, the petitioners were quiet and passive. They were not disruptive, and did not impinge upon the rights of others. In these circumstances, their conduct was within the protection of the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth.&quot;
*&quot;First Amendment rights are available to teachers and students, subject to application in light of the special characteristics of the school environment.&quot;
*&quot;A prohibition against expression of opinion, without any evidence that the rule is necessary to avoid substantial interference with school discipline or the rights of others, is not permissible under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.&quot;

===&quot;United States v. O&#x27;Brien&quot;===
&quot;On the morning of March 31, 1966, David Paul O&#x27;Brien and three companions burned their Selective Service registration certificates on the steps of the South Boston Courthouse. A sizable crowd, including several agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, witnessed the event. Immediately after the burning, members of the crowd began attacking O&#x27;Brien and his companions. An FBI agent ushered O&#x27;Brien to safety inside the courthouse. After he was advised of his right to counsel and to silence, O&#x27;Brien stated to FBI agents that he had burned his registration certificate because of his beliefs, knowing that he was violating federal law. He produced the charred remains of the certificate, which, with his consent, were photographed.

For this act, O&#x27;Brien was indicted, tried, convicted, and sentenced in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. He did not contest the fact that he had burned the certificate. He stated in argument to the jury that he burned the certificate publicly to influence others to adopt his anti-war beliefs, as he put it, &quot;so that other people would reevaluate their positions with Selective Service, with the armed forces, and reevaluate their place in the culture of today, to hopefully consider my position.&quot;

The court ruled 7–1 against O&#x27;Brien. In the opinion of the court, Chief Justice Warren wrote that while the First Amendment does protect freedom of speech, it does not protect all things that may extraneously be labeled &quot;symbolic speech&quot;. As such, O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s protest was not protected because the United States had a compelling interest in preventing the destruction or mutilation of draft cards. To help himself and future justices determine what may be protected under the free speech clause, he developed a series of requirements that laws must meet in order to stay out of conflict with the First, and thus be considered constitutional, known now as the &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot; test.

===&quot;Cohen v. California&quot;===

In 1968, Paul Cohen entered a Los Angeles Courthouse wearing a jacket that displayed the words &quot;Fuck the Draft&quot; knowing that the jacket displayed these words. Though he had removed the jacket and placed it under his arm before entering the courthouse, a police officer witnessed the jacket and slogan in the corridor and arrested him for &quot;willingly and unlawfully and maliciously disturbing the peace and quiet by engaging in tumultuous and offensive conduct.&quot;

The Court voted 5–4 in favor of Cohen. Justice Harlan wrote &quot;[A]bsent a more particularized and compelling reason for its actions, the State may not, consistently with the First and Fourteenth Amendments, make the simple public display of this single four-letter expletive a criminal offense.&quot; In the court&#x27;s opinion, Harlan also penned the now famous line &quot;one man&#x27;s vulgarity is another&#x27;s lyric&quot;.

===&quot;Spence v. Washington&quot;===

A college student had hung a U.S. flag on his window, upside down and adorned with peace signs, in May 1970 as to protest the government&#x27;s actions in the invasion of Cambodia and the Kent State shootings. He was arrested and convicted under a Washington state statute that barred &quot;improper use&quot; of the flag, including adorning it with decorations. The Supreme Court ruled &quot;per curiam&quot; that the statute was unconstitutional as it did not consider the intent of speech of displaying the flag. In the opinion, the Court devised a two-prong test to determine if actions can qualify for First Amendment protections: &quot;An intent to convey a particularized message was present, and in the surrounding circumstances the likelihood was great that the message would be understood by those who viewed it.&quot;. This doctrine became known as the &quot;Spence&quot; test.

===&quot;Texas v. Johnson&quot;===

In 1984, during a protest against the policies of the Reagan administration in Dallas, Texas, Gregory Lee Johnson doused an American flag that was given to him by a fellow demonstrator with kerosene and set it alight while those around him chanted &quot;America the red, white and blue, we spit on you.&quot; He was later arrested and convicted on a flag desecration law in Texas, and sentenced to one year in prison and a $2,000 fine. 
The court ruled 5 to 4 in favor of Johnson. Building upon &quot;Spence&quot;, Justice Brennan wrote that because such other actions in relation to the flag (such as saluting, and displaying) are considered to be a form of expression, so must too the burning be, and that Johnson&#x27;s protest was &quot;&#x27;Sufficiently imbued with elements of communication&#x27; to implicate the First Amendment.&quot; He also explained that the relevance of the &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot; test is limited &quot;in which &#x27;the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression&#x27;&quot;, as the Texas law in question had its interest in preventing any violent reaction that may spring from those witnessing the burning of the flag. This case helped solidify the condition that any law that inhibits freedom of speech must have an important and compelling interest to do so.

===&quot;Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Group of Boston&quot;===

In 1992, an LGBT group was refused to allow to participate in Boston&#x27;s parade in celebration of St. Patrick&#x27;s Day and Evacuation Day by the parade organizers, who said the group&#x27;s identity did not fit the theme of the parade. The Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favor of the organizers, that the message they wanted to convey was expressive speech and protected by the First Amendment, and thus could deny the LGBT group from participation. Justice David Souter wrote in the opinion that the &quot;particularized message&quot; from &quot;Spence&quot; was too limited, and that a &quot;narrow, succinctly articulable message is not a condition of constitutional protection, which if confined to expressions conveying a &#x27;particularized message,&#x27; would never reach the unquestionably shielded painting of Jackson Pollock, music of Arnold Schoenberg, or Jabberwocky verse of Lewis Carroll.&quot; &quot;Hurley&quot; conflict with &quot;Spence&quot; and &quot;Johnson&quot; created a circuit split on evaluating symbolic speech for constitutional protection.

<text>Prior restraint (also referred to as prior censorship or pre-publication censorship) is censorship imposed, usually by a government or institution, on expression, that prohibits particular instances of expression. It is in contrast to censorship that establishes general subject matter restrictions and reviews a particular instance of expression only after the expression has taken place.

In some countries (e.g., United States, Argentina) prior restraint by the government is forbidden, subject to exceptions (such as classifying certain matters of national security), by their respective constitutions.

Prior restraint can be effected in a number of ways. For example, the exhibition of works of art or a movie may require a license from a government authority (sometimes referred to as a classification board or censorship board) before it can be published, and the failure or refusal to grant a license is a form of censorship as is the revoking of a license. It can take the form of a legal injunction or government order prohibiting the publication of a specific document. Sometimes, a government or other party becomes aware of a forthcoming publication on a particular subject and seeks to prevent it: to halt ongoing publication and prevent its resumption. These injunctions are considered prior restraint because potential future publications are stopped in advance. It can also take the form of a (usually secret) policy imposed by a commercial corporation upon its employees, requiring them to obtain written permission to publish a given written work, even one authored outside of work hours produced using their own computing resources.

==Exceptions to restrictions==
Not all restrictions on free speech are a breach of the prior restraint doctrine. It is widely accepted that publication of information affecting national security, particularly in , may be restricted, even when there are laws that protect freedom of expression. In many cases invocation of national security is controversial, with opponents of suppression arguing that government errors and embarrassment are being covered up; examples are given below.

Publication of information on legal cases in progress may be restricted by an injunction. (Otherwise publishing of material which may affect a case is subject to penalties, but not prevented from the outset.)
Text and video information containing illegal context, such as pornography involving underage or unwilling individuals are generally censored in order to protect the victim/s of the material, and preserve the legal and ethical standards of the country/state initiating the censorship of the offensive material.

==Anglo-American legal tradition==

===Blackstone and early views===
In William Blackstone&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries&quot; &quot;Freedom of the Press&quot; is defined as the right to be free from prior restraints. According to Blackstone, a person should not be punished for speaking or writing the truth with good motives and for justifiable ends. Truth alone, however, was not considered a sufficient justification, if published with bad motives.

This view was the common legal understanding at the time the U.S. Constitution was adopted. Only later have the concepts of freedom of speech and the press been extended (in the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries sharing their legal tradition) to protect honest error, or truth even if published for questionable reasons.

===Judicial view===
Prior restraint is often considered a particularly oppressive form of censorship in Anglo-American jurisprudence because it prevents the restricted material from being heard or distributed at all. Other forms of restrictions on expression (such as actions for libel or criminal libel, slander, defamation, and contempt of court) implement criminal or civil sanctions only after the offending material has been published. While such sanctions might lead to a chilling effect, legal commentators argue that at least such actions do not directly impoverish the marketplace of ideas. Prior restraint, on the other hand, takes an idea or material completely out of the marketplace. Thus it is often considered to be the most extreme form of censorship. The United States Supreme Court expressed this view in &quot;Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stuart&quot; by noting:

Also, most of the early struggles for freedom of the press were against forms of prior restraint. Thus prior restraint came to be looked upon with a particular horror, and Anglo-American courts became particularly unwilling to approve it, when they might approve other forms of press restriction.

==United States==
=== &quot;Near v. Minnesota&quot; ===

The first notable case in which the United States Supreme Court ruled on a prior restraint issue was &quot;Near v. Minnesota&quot;, . In that case the Court held prior restraints to be unconstitutional, except in extremely limited circumstances such as national security issues. The ruling came about after Jay Near&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Saturday Press&quot;, a small local paper that ran countless exposés of Minneapolis&#x27;s elected officials&#x27; alleged illicit activities, including gambling, racketeering, and graft, was silenced by the Minnesota Gag Law of 1925, also known as &quot;The Public Nuisance Law&quot;. Near&#x27;s critics called his paper a scandal sheet, and alleged that he tried to extort money by threatening to publish attacks on officials and others. 
In the Near case the Court held that the state had no power to enjoin the publication of the paper in this way – that any such action would be unconstitutional under the First Amendment. It wrote:

If we cut through mere details of procedure, the operation and effect of the statute in substance is that public authorities may bring the owner or publisher of a newspaper or periodical before a judge upon a charge of conducting a business of publishing scandalous and defamatory matter — in particular that the matter consists of charges against public officers of official dereliction — and, unless the owner or publisher is able and disposed to bring competent evidence to satisfy the judge that the charges are true and are published with good motives and for justifiable ends, his newspaper or periodical is suppressed and further publication is made punishable as a contempt. This is of the essence of censorship.

And

This was an extension of the Court&#x27;s earlier views, which had followed Blackstone. In &quot;Patterson v. Colorado&quot;, the Court had written: &quot;In the first place, the main purpose of such constitutional provisions is &#x27;to prevent all such previous restraints upon publications as had been practiced by other governments,&#x27; and they do not prevent the subsequent punishment of such as may be deemed contrary to the public welfare.&quot; (quoted in the &quot;Near&quot; decision). The &quot;Near&quot; decision was the first time that it was held that even alleged untruth or malicious intent would not be sufficient reason to impose prior restraints.

Near was decided 5–4. The four dissenting justices strongly approved of the &quot;gag law&quot;, and felt that the nature of the articles in &quot;The Saturday Press&quot;, including their recurrent antisemitism, their frequent (allegedly false) accusations of official misconduct, and their disrespectful and confrontational tone, made them unworthy of protection. But this view did not prevail.

After the &quot;Near&quot; decision, newspapers had a clearly established freedom to criticize public officials without fear of retribution, even when charges made by the papers could not be proven in court. Newspapers could still be punished through libel laws, if they published material found to be untrue. The &quot;Gag Law&quot; was unique in the United States at that time, and even in Minnesota had only been used on two occasions. Indeed, the Court commented on the unusual nature of the proceeding in its decision.

The Court in &quot;Near&quot; left open the possibility of prior restraints for various exceptional purposes, such as national security, control of obscenity, and the like. It wrote:

Near&#x27;s dicta suggest that, while a constitutional prior restraint can exist, the high burden of proof necessary to demonstrate constitutionality results in a presumption of invalidity, and the government bears the burden of showing the restraint&#x27;s constitutionality.

In a later case (&quot;Nebraska Press Ass&#x27;n v. Stuart&quot;), the Court wrote:

This shows the strong later acceptance of what had been a disputed decision when it was first handed down.

=== &quot;Kinney v. Barnes&quot; ===
In the 2012 case of &quot;Kinney v. Barnes&quot;, Kinney, a legal recruiter, was the subject of inflammatory comments on the website of the company who previously employed him. The company claimed he received extra incentives on the job causing his termination. Kinney filed a defamation suit seeking retraction of the comments and a permanent injunction against any similar future comments being made. The Supreme Court of Texas ruling specifically addressed whether future comments could be barred and whether this would constitute prior restraint. Although the court ruled that the statements posted which were judged to be defamatory could be removed, they did not prohibit similar speech from being posted online at a later time. They reasoned that this would constitute prior restraint and risk producing a chilling effect. The court reasoned, in keeping with a prior decision (&quot;Hajek v. Bill Mowbray Motors, Inc.&quot;, 647 S.W.2d 253, 255 (Tex. 1983)), that the appropriate remedy to defamatory speech was penalization of &quot;what is wrongfully spoken&quot; rather &quot;denial of the right to speak&quot;.
===Wartime censorship===

During World War I, and to a greater extent during World War II, war correspondents accompanied military forces, and their reports were subject to advance censorship to preserve military secrets. The extent of such censorship was not generally challenged, and no major court case arose from this issue. In later conflicts the degree to which war reporting was subject to censorship varied, and in some cases it has been alleged that the censorship was as much political as military in purpose. This was particularly true during the Vietnam War and the 1983 invasion of Grenada.

===Pentagon Papers case===

In the Pentagon Papers case (&quot;New York Times Co. v. United States&quot;, ), the Nixon administration sought to enjoin &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; newspapers from publishing excerpts from a top-secret United States Department of Defense history of the United States involvement in the Vietnam War from 1945 to 1971. The government tried to use the &quot;national security&quot; exception that had been suggested in the &quot;Near&quot; decision. The Supreme Court struck down the injunctions. However, the decision was fragmented, with nine separate opinions being filed in the case. It was not clear at the time what the effect would be on future prior restraint cases.

===H-bomb article cases===

====&quot;Scientific American&quot;====
On March 15, 1950 &quot;Scientific American&quot; magazine published an article by Hans Bethe about thermonuclear fusion, the mechanism by which stars generate energy and emit electromagnetic radiation (light, etc.). Fusion is also the process which makes the hydrogen bomb (H-bomb) possible. The AEC (Atomic Energy Commission) ordered publication stopped. Several thousand copies of the printed magazine were destroyed, and the article was published with some text removed at the direction of the AEC. At this time there existed in the United States no workable design for a hydrogen bomb (the Teller–Ulam design would not be developed for another year), but the U.S. was engaged in a crash program to develop one. Gerard Piel, the publisher of &quot;Scientific American&quot;, complained that the AEC was &quot;suppressing information which the American People need in order to form intelligent judgments&quot;. Bethe, however, declined to support this complaint, and the suppression of the unedited version of the article was never litigated.

====&quot;The Progressive&quot;====
In February 1979, an anti-nuclear activist named Howard Morland drafted an article for &quot;The Progressive&quot; magazine, entitled &quot;The H-Bomb Secret: To Know How is to Ask Why&quot;. The article was an attempt by Morland to publish what he thought the &quot;H-Bomb Secret&quot; was (the Teller–Ulam design), derived from various unclassified sources and informal interviews with scientists and plant workers. Through a number of complicated circumstances, the Department of Energy attempted to enjoin its publication, alleging that the article contained sensitive technical information which was (1) probably derived from classified sources, or (2) became a classified source when compiled in a correct way, even if it were derived from unclassified sources, based on the &quot;born secret&quot; provisions of the 1954 Atomic Energy Act. A preliminary injunction was granted against the article&#x27;s publication, and Morland and the magazine appealed (United States v. &quot;The Progressive&quot;, et al.). After a lengthy set of hearings (one &quot;in camera&quot;, another open to the public), and attracting considerable attention as a &quot;freedom of the press&quot; case, the government dropped its charges after it claimed the case became moot when another bomb speculator (Chuck Hansen) published his own views on the &quot;secret&quot; (many commentators speculated that they were afraid the Atomic Energy Act would be overturned under such scrutiny). The article was duly published in &quot;The Progressive&quot; (in the November 1979 issue) six months after it was originally scheduled, and remains available in libraries. (As an aside, Morland himself decided that he did not have the secret, and published a &quot;corrected&quot; version a month later.)

===Judicial gag orders===
Frequently a court will impose advance restrictions on lawyers, parties, and on the press in reporting of trials, particularly criminal trials. These restrictions are intended to protect the right to a fair trial, and to avoid interference with the judicial process. Nonetheless, they are a form of prior restraint, and the press in particular has often objected to such orders.

In &quot;Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stuart&quot;, , the United States Supreme Court overturned such a &quot;gag order&quot;. It ruled that alternative methods to help ensure a fair trial, short of prior restraints, might have been used, and that it was not all clear, under the circumstances, that the gag order would have the desired effect even if upheld. It also made a particular point of asserting that orders restricting reporting on events that occur in open court are not permissible. It wrote:

To the extent that this order prohibited the reporting of evidence adduced at the open preliminary hearing, it plainly violated settled principles: &#x27;[T]here is nothing that proscribes the press from reporting events that transpire in the courtroom.&#x27; &quot;Sheppard v. Maxwell&quot;, (384 U.S., at 362–363).

The Court&#x27;s conclusion in this case reaffirmed its general opposition to prior restraints, and indicated that judicial gag orders would be sustained only in exceptional cases. It wrote:

Our analysis ends as it began, with a confrontation between prior restraint imposed to protect one vital constitutional guarantee and the explicit command of another that the freedom to speak and publish shall not be abridged. We reaffirm that the guarantees of freedom of expression are not an absolute prohibition under all circumstances, but the barriers to prior restraint remain high and the presumption against its use continues intact.

In the United Kingdom judicial gag orders are much more frequently employed, and the strong prejudice against them reflected in the above quote does not seem to be felt by British courts. Other countries also employ such orders more freely than the United States does.

===DeCSS case===

In October 1999 the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) learned of the availability on the Internet of DeCSS, a program that allowed people to view the content of DVDs using computers that lacked commercial DVD players, bypassing the encryption system known as the Content Scrambling System (CSS) generally used on commercial DVDs. The MPAA responded by sending out a number of cease and desist letters to web site operators who posted the software. In January 2000, a lawsuit was filed against the publisher of the magazine &quot;2600: The Hacker Quarterly&quot;, and others. This case is known as &quot;Universal v. Reimerdes&quot;, .

The suit asked for an injunction under the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) prohibiting the &quot;2600&quot; site from posting the DeCSS code. It also asked for a prohibition on linking to other sites that posted the code.

The injunction was issued and sustained in an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and the constitutionality of the DMCA was upheld. The district court wrote that the computer code &quot;... does more, in other words, than convey a message&quot; and that &quot;... it has a distinctly functional, non-speech aspect in addition to reflecting the thoughts of the programmers.&quot; The appeals court later wrote that &quot;Under the circumstances amply shown by the record, the injunction&#x27;s linking prohibition validly regulates the Appellants&#x27; opportunity instantly to enable anyone anywhere to gain unauthorized access to copyrighted movies on DVDs&quot; thus upholding the injunction against publishing links to the DeCSS code in these circumstances.

The appeals court did consider the prior restraint and free expression issues, but treated the DeCSS program primarily as a means of evading copyright protection, and under that theory, held that the &quot;2600&quot; site could be permanently enjoined from posting the DeCSS code, and from linking to sites that posted it in an attempt to make the code available. The case was not taken to the Supreme Court.

===Theater and motion pictures===
There is a long history of prior restraints on the theater; in the United Kingdom stage plays still required a license until 1968. This attitude was early transferred to motion pictures, and prior restraints were retained for films long after they had been dropped for other forms of publication: in some jurisdictions, a film had to be submitted to a film censor board in order to be approved for showing.

The United States Supreme Court upheld the use of a board of censors in &quot;Mutual Film Corporation v. Industrial Commission of Ohio&quot;, by deciding that the First Amendment did not apply to motion pictures. The power of such boards was weakened when the Supreme Court later overruled itself and decided that the First Amendment does apply to motion pictures. In the case of &quot;Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson&quot;, , the court decided that giving the power to forbid or restrict a film to a censorship board on the grounds a film was &quot;sacrilegious&quot; was far too damaging to the protections of the First Amendment.

The &quot;death knell&quot; for censorship boards occurred in 1965 when the U.S. Supreme Court found the Maryland law making it a crime to exhibit a film without submitting it to the censorship board was unconstitutional. In &quot;Freedman v. Maryland&quot;, , the state&#x27;s requirement that a film be presented to the board was unconstitutional as it lacked adequate procedural safeguards. While it is not necessarily unconstitutional to require films to be submitted to a censorship board, the board has extremely limited options: a censorship board has no power to prohibit a film, and, if the law grants it that power, the law is unconstitutional. The board&#x27;s only options when a film is presented to it are either to grant a license for the film or immediately go to court to enjoin its exhibition.

Also, state or local censorship boards had been found to have no jurisdiction over broadcasts by television stations, even when located in the state or community where they are grounded, thus eliminating yet another reason for their existence.

Both the state of Maryland and the province of Ontario retained film censor boards to a particularly late date. Maryland abandoned its board in the 1980s, and a 2004 decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal, reversing a previous trend in favor of the Ontario Film Classification Board&#x27;s right to insist on cuts, ruled that the province had no right to insist on cuts as a condition of release as Canadian federal obscenity laws were sufficient to deal with obscene material. In May 2005, the Ontario government ended the power of the Classification Board to insist on cuts, requiring all films with adult content that were not judged obscene to be rated &quot;R&quot; for adults only.

In many countries, legally effective rating systems are in effect. See History of British Film Certificates for information on film restrictions in the UK.

===Industry codes===
Many industries have formulated &quot;voluntary&quot; codes limiting the content of expression, generally affecting perceived effects on public morality rather than revelation of secrets. Examples of these include the Hays Code, which affected Hollywood films from the 1930s to the 1950s, and the Comics Code, which was designed to deal with the rise of horror comics in the 1950s and lasted into the 1970s. The movie rating system currently in effect in the United States, run by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) is another such industry code. Such codes have generally been adopted with the twofold purposes of forestalling possible government intervention and avoiding unfavorable publicity or boycotts. While such codes are not generally enforced by governmental action, they are generally enforced on content producers by gatekeepers in the marketing chain: studios in the case of the Hays Code, distributors in the case of the Comics Code and theater chains in the case of the MPAA rating system. Content producers have often objected to these codes and argue that they are, in effect, a form of prior restraint. However, the first amendment prohibition of prior restraint applies to government or court action and does not bind private entities such as theater chains.

==Chile==
===&quot;Francisco Martorell v. Chile&quot;===
In April 1993, Francisco Martorell published a book titled &#x27;Impunidad diplomática&#x27; (Diplomatic Impunity) in Argentina with Editorial Planeta. The book was about, among other things, the events that led an erstwhile Argentinian ambassador, Oscar Spinosa Melo, to leave Chile.
The book -- scheduled to start selling in Chile the day after its launch in Argentina -- met with a protection remedy by a Chilean businessman before the Santiago Court of Appeals, who argued the text injured his right to privacy. Thus, the court issued an interlocutory injunction (&#x27;orden de no innovar&#x27;) that temporarily prohibited the book&#x27;s entry, distribution and circulation in Chile pending a final ruling on the case.
Thereafter, several people filed complaints against Martorell for defamation (injuria) and false imputation of a publicly actionable crime (calumnia).

Subsequently, through an extraordinary remedy, Martorell appealed to the Supreme Court of Chile and invoked the constitutional guarantees of freedom of the press. But in a unanimous decision handed down on June 15, 1993, the Supreme Court denied the appeal and forbade the book&#x27;s circulation, formally notifying Martorell of its decision some days later.

The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (ICHR) had to determine whether the Chilean court&#x27;s decision to prohibit the entry, circulation and distribution of Martorell&#x27;s Diplomatic Impunity violated freedom of expression under Article 13 of the American Convention on Human Rights (ACHR), which states:
 &#x27;1. Everyone has the right to freedom of thought and expression. This right includes freedom to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing, in print, in the form of art, or through any other medium of one&#x27;s choice. 
 2. The exercise of the right provided for in the foregoing paragraph shall not be subject to prior censorship but shall be subject to subsequent imposition of liability, which shall be expressly established by law...&#x27;

The Commission reaffirmed that freedom of expression, which it averred involves the right to express ideas and thoughts and receive them. As such, when an individual&#x27;s right to express themself restricted, it also affects the public&#x27;s right to receive information. 
The Commission indicated that Article 13.2 of the ACHR allows certain restrictions upon one&#x27;s exercise of freedom of expression and stipulates the legitimate limits and the requirements for establishing these restrictions. In this sense, the right can only be legitimately restricted through the imposition of subsequent liabilities provided for by law and deemed necessary to ensure the objectives established in the Convention. The Commission recalled that protecting &#x27;the rights or the reputation of others&#x27; is a legitimate purpose for the Convention. However, regarding the rights of privacy, honour and dignity outlined in Article 11 of this instrument, &#x27;the organs of the State cannot interpret the provisions of Article 11 in a manner that violates Article 13, which prohibits prior censorship&#x27;. 

Accordingly, the IACHR stressed that the Convention stipulates that prior censorship is incompatible with the full enjoyment of the rights protected by this instrument. The Commission underscored ACHR as the only human rights instrument containing this prohibition, indicating the veritable importance the Inter-American system placed on the freedom of expression. 
In May 1993, the Court of Appeals granted the judicial remedy brought by the Chilean businessman and affirmed the measure that &#x27;prohibited the entrance and commercialization of the book in Chile&#x27;. A subsequent to the Supreme Court was rejected. 

In the case under review, the Commission considered the decision to ban the entry, circulation and distribution of the book Diplomatic Impunity in Chile was contrary to Article 13 of the ACHR. For the Commission, this constituted an act before censorship and, thus, was not a legitimate restriction on the right to freedom of expression.

<text>Intercession or intercessory prayer is the act of praying on behalf of others, or asking a saint in heaven to pray on behalf of oneself or for others.

The Apostle Paul&#x27;s exhortation to Timothy specified that intercession prayers should be made for all people.
==Christianity==

===In the early Church===
The early Christians continued to practice intercessory prayer on behalf of others after Jesus&#x27; death. Ignatius of Antioch was one man who exhorted Christians to continue to pray for others, and especially for those who became Docetists or held other heretical beliefs. In his letter to the churches of Smyrna, St. Ignatius exhorts the Christians there to pray for other people: &quot;only you must pray to God for them, if by any means they may be brought to repentance, which, however, will be very difficult. Yet Jesus Christ, who is our true life, has the power of [effecting] this&quot;. Throughout all of Ignatius&#x27;s letters, the word for prayers of intercession appears nineteen times, and Ignatius asks for prayer &quot;for himself (eight times), for the Christian church in Syria (seven times), for persecutors, heretics, and all people generally (once each)&quot;.

St. Ignatius and the other church fathers, such as Paul the Apostle, who were keen on intercessory prayer based this practice on Jesus&#x27; own teachings which required that one pray for others, especially one&#x27;s enemies:

According to Lionel Swain, of St. Edmund&#x27;s College, Ware, St. Paul believed intercession to be one of the most important aspects of faith and praying life, as praying for others is a recurring theme in his works. Prayer acts as a way for St. Paul to acknowledge God&#x27;s power. Intercessory prayer also acts as a way for the Apostle to &quot;share in ... the Father&#x27;s redemptive love&quot;. Paul believed that prayer transformed the person doing the praying, as much as the one being prayed for, which creates a stronger bond between him and God.

Prof. Dr Johannes van Oort, Professor Extraordinarius in the Department of Church History and Church Polity of the Faculty of Theology at the University of Pretoria, South Africa, adds that, in addition to praying for wisdom, the early church was very much involved with different charismas, one of which being healing. Praying for other people&#x27;s illnesses was another way that intercessory prayer was important in the early church, as healing was a sign of &quot;the power of God&#x27;s Kingdom&quot;. This gift of healing is specifically mentioned, among the other charismata, as a sign of being a true Christian by Irenaeus of Lyons in his text, &quot;Against Heresies&quot;.

===Saints===
Intercession of the saints is a doctrine held by the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, and Roman Catholic churches, as well as by some Lutheran and Anglican churches (chiefly those of Evangelical Catholic or Anglo-Catholic churchmanship, respectively). It teaches that saints may be asked to intercede (or pray) for others. The doctrine of requesting intercession from saints can be found in Christian writings from the 3rd century AD, such as from Origen and Clement of Alexandria.

===The dead===

In addition to praying for each other in life, early Christians would pray for those who had died. There is no unequivocal evidence that Christians began to pray for the dead before the third century AD. G. F. Hamilton argues that the earliest example of Church prayer on behalf of dead Christians is found in the Sacramentary of Serapion of Thmuis (350 AD). Rather than pray for the departed in regular church services on Sunday, these early Christians would hold special commemorative occasions during the week. There was a sharp distinction drawn between remembering and praying on behalf of the dead, and those who were the faithfully&#x27; departed&quot;, where Christians would only pray for those who had died as believers. The First Epistle of Clement (95 AD) contains a prayer which, while mainly for protection for the living, also includes the dead. Even quite early, a distinction was drawn between those who had died as Christians, and those who had died as unbelievers. In the &quot;Martyrdom of Polycarp&quot; (155 AD), Polycarp is killed and his bones are taken by fellow Christians and a shrine is set up to him, where they may remember his martyrdom. In contrast, the &quot;Apology of Aristides&quot; shows how those who were not Christians were grieved for, while the dead faithful were rejoiced over.
===Theological perspective===
In an article in &quot;Theological Studies&quot;, Catholic theologian Patricia A. Sullivan warns that saints should not be built up in a way that brings down God. Saint Augustine had famously said that we pray not to instruct God but to get our will in line with God&#x27;s. Sullivan warns away from the dictionary meanings of &quot;intercession&quot; as “intervention, mediation, arbitration, negotiation”, all of which sound like we are dealing with a hostile or unfriendly God, whom we need to manipulate to get what we need. Such is not the meaning of the &quot;hapax legomenon&quot; in the New Testament of the word for intercession. Sullivan goes on:
When we ask a saint to intercede for us, what is happening at a deeper level is that we are taking refuge in the all-enfolding community of the redeemed, approaching God thru saintly symbols of Christ&#x27;s victory and of our hope. Saints want always what God wants, what is best for us whether we pray for it or not. They are in a perpetual attitude of praise for God’s love and care, to which we join ourselves, praying, more precisely, &quot;with&quot; them rather than to them. The value of our petitions is that they turn us in confidence toward the God who loves us, allowing God’s work to be more effective in us, and thru us in others.
It would be anathema to ask God to try any harder to do good. By invocation of a saint &quot;we take refuge in faith in the all-enfolding community of all the redeemed,&quot; where &quot;each is responsible for all&quot;. They are &quot;creative models of holiness&quot;.

==Islam==
Although the idea of intercession or mediation (Arabic: &quot;s̲h̲afāʿa&quot;) has historically played a very prominent role in Islamic thought, it is not universally accepted by all Muslims in the present day.

The Quran says that the pre-Islamic Arab pagan gods will not be able to intercede with God on behalf of humankind, and that &quot;the guilty&quot; (&quot;al-mujrimīn&quot;, Q74:41) will not benefit from any intercession on the Day of Judgment. Other passages that deny the efficacy intercession include Q32:4 &amp; Q39:44. Still others say that God is the only intercessor (Q6:51, Q6:70; Q32:4; Q39:44).

However, &quot;intercession is mentioned in the Qurʾān with respect to angels praying for the believers and the Prophet praying for erring but repentant Muslims.&quot; Furthermore, it became an orthodox Islamic doctrine or &quot;cardinal belief&quot; that &quot;Muḥammad will intercede for all Muslims on the Day of Resurrection.&quot; While this particular tenet practically remained unchallenged throughout Islamic history, the widespread Sunni and Shia practice of asking deceased prophets and saints for intercession by praying at their tombs have become contentious issues in the modern Islamic world, with all these different types of intercession often being labelled by Salafi/Wahhabi Muslims as a type of polytheism, in a manner akin to the attitude of many Protestants towards the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox practice of saint-intercession.

==Studies==

Some religions claim that praying for somebody who is sick can have positive effects on the health of the person being prayed for.

Meta-studies of the literature in the field have been performed showing evidence only for no effect or a potentially small effect. For instance, a 2006 meta analysis on 14 studies concluded that there is &quot;no discernible effect&quot; while a 2007 systemic review of intercessory prayer reported inconclusive results, noting that 7 of 17 studies had &quot;small, but significant, effect sizes&quot; but the review noted that the most methodologically rigorous studies failed to produce significant findings.

<text>Melbourne Storm is a rugby league club based in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia that participates in the National Rugby League (NRL). The club plays its home games at AAMI Park, and wears a purple and navy blue jersey with gold and white trim.

The first fully professional rugby league team in the state, it debuted in 1997 during the Super League war. Following Super League&#x27;s collapse, the team became part of the newly formed, united competition. They have won four premierships since their inception, in 1999, 2012, 2017 and 2020, and have contested several more grand finals. They won the 2007 and 2009 grand finals, but were stripped of those premierships following salary cap breaches.

They also competed in the NRL&#x27;s Under-20s competition (as Melbourne Thunderbolts) from 2008 until its demise in 2017 and in 2018 entered the Victorian Thunderbolts in the Hastings Deering Colts U20s QLD competition. The club has also expanded into netball in a joint venture with the University of the Sunshine Coast. Since 2017, Sunshine Coast Lightning have played in Suncorp Super Netball.

In 2024, the Melbourne Storm rugby league club had over 1 million fans.

==History==

===1997–1999: Establishment and 1st Premiership===

Following record attendances at State of Origin fixtures in Melbourne of 87,161 in 1994 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the Australian Rugby League (ARL) had planned to establish a Melbourne-based team in the Premiership by 1998. However, the disruption caused by the Super League war caused great change to the game in Australia. By May 1997, Super League boss John Ribot pushed for a Melbourne-based club for his competition, which was the rival of the ARL. Former Brisbane Broncos centre Chris Johns became the CEO of the club and Ribot stepped down from the head of Super League to set up the club, with head of News Limited Ken Cowley as chairman. In September 1997, Melbourne announced that Chris Anderson would be their foundation coach, and then Super League announced that the new team would be named the Melbourne Storm. Melbourne teenager Cameron Duncan came up with the name Storm and his winning entry was chosen from more than 1000 entries received in a competition run in conjunction with the &quot;Herald Sun&quot;.

The Melbourne club then went forward with signing players, mainly from folding Super League clubs Perth Reds and Hunter Mariners. These players included Rodney Howe, Robbie Kearns, Matt Geyer, Paul Bell, Robbie Ross, Glenn Lazarus, Brett Kimmorley and Scott Hill. With the Super League and ARL joining into one competition for the 1998 season, the Melbourne team became part of the National Rugby League (NRL). The Melbourne Storm Rugby League Club was unveiled at a function at the Hyatt Hotel – Melbourne in February 1998.

In their first game, they defeated the Illawarra Steelers, with Glenn Lazarus as their inaugural captain. Melbourne, in a complete shock to the rest of the competition, won their first four games, before losing to the Auckland Warriors (Now known as the New Zealand Warriors) They went on to make the finals, but were defeated by the eventual premiers, the Brisbane Broncos.

In January 1999, Executive Director John Ribot negotiated a deal that saw Melbourne Storm games televised in China every weekend. The club won eight of their first eleven games of the 1999 NRL season, and went on to make the finals in third position on the Premiership ladder. The team was beaten convincingly 34–10 in the quarter final by St. George Illawarra. After narrow victories against the Canterbury Bulldogs and the Parramatta Eels; however, Melbourne once more faced St. George Illawarra in the grand final. The Storm staged a late comeback in the game to win 20–18, securing their first premiership.

===2000–2002: Decline and coaching changes===
Melbourne&#x27;s Premiership defence began relatively slowly losing their first four games of the 2000 NRL season, the club went on to make the finals (finishing 6th), but were eventually knocked out by Newcastle in the quarter-finals. Between 2001 and 2002, the club&#x27;s on field performances waned, resulting in a 10th-placed finish in 2002. Cracks were starting to appear between John Ribot and Anderson throughout the period, with Anderson quitting as coach after round 7, 2001. He was replaced by Mark Murray. The Melbourne club failed to make the finals in 2001. Johns left the club as CEO at the end of 2002 and coach Murray was sacked due to Melbourne&#x27;s poor form, with the club missing the finals for the second year in a row.

===2003–2006: Craig Bellamy era begins – return to the top===
Wayne Bennett&#x27;s assistant coach at the Brisbane Broncos, Craig Bellamy was announced as the new coach of Melbourne for 2003, and in addition, a new captain in Kiwi international skipper Stephen Kearney. Bellamy&#x27;s strict coaching had an almost immediate effect and saw the Melbourne Storm get back on track from the previous lean years.

Between 2003 and 2005, Melbourne consistently made the finals, but lost games in the semi-finals which prevented them from reaching the grand final. This period also saw the arrival and rise of young Queenslanders Billy Slater, Cameron Smith and Cooper Cronk. Unheard of at the start of 2003, the steady hooker and dummy-half Smith provided solid support to existing established players in Matt Orford and his forwards and also provided supporters with confidence of the club&#x27;s future. A notable incident that occurred during 2004 was the 18-game suspension of Danny Williams following a king-hit on Wests Tigers&#x27; player Mark O&#x27;Neill. It was the longest suspension in Australian rugby league since 1987.

By 2005, Storm coach Craig Bellamy, in his third season as an NRL coach, gained representative honours when he was selected to start coaching the Country Origin team.

Season 2006 saw the retirement of captain Robbie Kearns and the emergence of talented rookie halfback Cooper Cronk who took over the position from Matt Orford and in addition, the recruitment of hard-man Michael Crocker. The club also moved away from a single captain, electing to use a rotating captains policy, including Cameron Smith for the first time. Contrary to expectation, 2006 was a standout year for the Melbourne team, finishing on top of the ladder for the first time. Melbourne only lost four games in the season, making them outright leaders by four wins. They went on to win their two finals matches, and were favourites in the 2006 NRL Grand Final, but lost 15–8 to the Brisbane Broncos, in a match where controversial refereeing decisions against Melbourne caused much media coverage.

===2007–2010: Finals success and club turmoil===
In 2007, the Storm finished the season on top of the table for the second year in a row. They progressed through the finals series with wins over Brisbane, 40–0, and then Parramatta 26–10, in the preliminary final. This secured a berth in the 2007 NRL Grand Final against the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles which they won 34–8, with Greg Inglis winning the Clive Churchill Medal for best on ground.


In 2008, foundation player Matt Geyer became the first player to play 250 games for the club. Melbourne finished on top of the ladder after the 26 rounds of regular competition and despite becoming the first minor premiers since the McIntyre final eight system was introduced to lose their opening finals game (15–18 to the New Zealand Warriors), they then defeated the Brisbane Broncos 16–14, scoring in the last minute of their semi-final. Cameron Smith was suspended for two matches for a grapple tackle on Brisbane&#x27;s Sam Thaiday in the match, seeing him miss the rest of the finals, and Craig Bellamy was fined $50,000 for making scathing remarks against the judiciary&#x27;s decision. Melbourne convincingly beat the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks 28–0 to qualify for the grand final, but suffered the heaviest Grand Final defeat in league history, beaten 40–0 by Manly. Greg Inglis, Billy Slater, Cameron Smith and Israel Folau all won awards at the Dally M Awards, and Slater and Smith finished equal second for the Dally M Medal. Billy Slater was awarded the international player of the year Golden Boot award for 2008, following on from Cameron Smith in 2007.

In the 2009 season, Melbourne finished 4th on the ladder; they defeated Manly 40–12 in the first week of the finals and Brisbane 40–10 in the preliminary finals to qualify for a fourth straight grand final (the first since Parramatta from 1981 to 1984). Against Parramatta, who had finished eighth in the home-and-away season but had won ten of its last eleven matches, the Storm led at one stage by 16 points, before finishing 23–16 winners. Slater won the Clive Churchill Medal, and they were named as the NRL Team of the Decade for the 2000s. In the late 2000s the Melbourne Storm were still running at a loss of up to $6M per season, however despite this, they were voted the state of Victoria&#x27;s most popular sports team by a national Roy Morgan Poll in October 2009.

In 2010, a number of changes were made to senior management of the club, firstly Brian Waldron resigned his position as CEO to take up the same position at the Melbourne Rebels Super Rugby team, he was replaced by Chief Operating Officer, Matt Hanson. In April, following the salary cap revelations, Matt Hanson was then stood down and Ron Gauci appointed.

On field, the Storm&#x27;s first match of the season was the 2010 World Club Challenge against equally dominant English side, the Leeds Rhinos; in very cold and wet conditions the Storm prevailed 18 – 10. 

On 22 April 2010 the club admitted that it had breached the NRL&#x27;s salary cap. The NRL estimated the breach to be in excess of $1.7 million over five years. As a result of the breach, NRL Chief Executive David Gallop stripped the club of all titles earned in this period including their 2007 and 2009 premierships, three minor premierships between 2006–08, heavily fined the club, deducted all premiership points earned to that point of the season and barred them from receiving any more for the rest of the season. The club ended up winning enough matches to make the finals, but automatically finished in last place due to the penalties. Melbourne did have something to celebrate in 2010 with the opening of their new home ground AAMI Park in May. The stadium was expected to be used right from the beginning of the season, however, construction delays postponed the opening.

===2011–2012: Rebuild and Premiership success===
Following the salary cap scandal, the club needed to shed a number of players and rebuild. They managed this successfully and over the next two years the Storm returned to the top of the ladder. In 2011 the club won what, after the salary cap penalties, was considered the club&#x27;s first Minor Premiership and that season also included a club record twelve consecutive wins, however, Melbourne fell just short the grand final, losing the preliminary final against New Zealand. At the 2011 Dally M Awards night, Billy Slater won the Dally M Medal, with Craig Bellamy and Cameron Smith also winning Coach of the year and Captain of the year respectively.

In 2012 the club started very strongly with nine consecutive wins, the club&#x27;s best start to a season up to that time. A five-game losing streak between Rounds 16 and 21 (the club&#x27;s second worst losing streak to that time) saw them fall from the top of the ladder. However, from Round 22 forward they recovered their winning form and finished the regular season with five straight wins, ending the regular season in second place on the table. Storm began their finals campaign with a 24–6 win over South Sydney Rabbitohs. Storm played its fifth Preliminary Final in six years, this time defeating Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles 40–12 at AAMI Park. Following this they went on to claim their second official Premiership defeating the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs 14 – 4 in the Grand Final.

===2013–2017: World Champions, Milestones and 3rd Premiership===
The Storm began its 2013 season with a trip to England where they defeated the Leeds Rhinos 18–14 in the World Club Challenge, to be crowned World Champions. Upon their return to Australia, the Storm began the home and away season where it left off in 2012 winning their first seven games, this combined with games won in late 2012 set a new club record for the most consecutive wins, with the streak ending at 15 games with a loss in Round 8. On 21 May 2013 the Storm announced that, News Limited had sold the club to Holding M.S. Australia Pty Limited, an organisation made up of internationally experienced and successful businessmen. This change included replacement of the News Ltd Board and Executive, which included the replacement of Chairman Stephen Rue with Bart Campbell and CEO Ron Gauci with Mark Evans. News Limited had owned the Storm since its inception in 1997. On 9 June 2013 Captain Cameron Smith played his 250th game for the club. The Storm managed to finish 3rd in 2013; however, successive losses to the South Sydney Rabbitohs and Newcastle Knights in the finals saw the Storm miss the Preliminary Finals for the first time since 2005 (excluding 2010).

The 2014 season saw a number of milestones achieved, both Billy Slater and Cooper Cronk played their 250th games and Craig Bellamy reached 300 games as coach. In mid 2014 the Storm also announced a new feeder partnership with the Sunshine Coast Falcons. This would complement their existing relationship with Brisbane Easts with a view to establishing a permanent footprint in the Sunshine Coast Area.

2015 began successfully for the Storm with the club finding itself on top of the ladder by Round 7. In April Storm CEO Mark Evans announced that he was returning to England and completed his tenure as CEO in June of that year. Dave Donaghy was announced as his replacement. In round 19 a major milestone was achieved with Cameron smith playing his 300th game becoming only the 24th player in history to do so. In August 2015 the storm announced that they would create an Academy on the Sunshine Coast to develop and nurture developing talent in the region with a view to progressing through the Storm ranks. Part of the establishment of this Academy meant that the Melbourne Storm Under 20s Team would play all of its home games at the new facility from 2016 onward.

The 2016 season began well for the Storm finding themselves in third place on the ladder after 10 rounds. In Round 5 they scored their 300th NRL win and in Round 9, Craig Bellamy coached his 350th NRL game. On 23 May the Melbourne Storm announced that it had been one of three successful bidders and the only NRL club to gain a licence to field a Netball side in a new expanded Australian Netball League to commence in 2017. The Melbourne club were nominated by Netball Australia as a preferred bidder for one of three new team licences under their expansion plans and on 17 August 2016 it was announced that the new team will be called Sunshine Coast Lightning and be based on the Sunshine Coast at the Storm sports Academy and in effect be a second Queensland Team. The announcement is to establish the Storm as not just a Rugby League club but a sporting and community club.

At the conclusion of the 2016 NRL season Melbourne finished in first place claiming their second legitimate Minor Premiership. They qualified for the NRL Finals series winning their first two finals and thus making it through to the 2016 NRL Grand Final against the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks. The game was a very hard-fought match, as the game hung in the balance until the dying second but the Cronulla side hung on to win.

2017 was another successful year for the Melbourne Storm, the club&#x27;s 20th season in the NRL. Following on from the heartbreak of losing the grand final in 2016, the club went from strength to strength recruiting well in the off season and dominated the 2017 NRL season to finish in first place earning them their third legitimate minor premiership. Melbourne won 20 and lost four games throughout the season making it their most dominant season in 10 years. Cameron Smith also broke a number of league, club and personal records throughout the 2017 season including the NRL games record for the most games played, league record for the most wins as a captain, a personal best for the most points in a game and also scored his 2000th career point and 1000th career goal, the first time any player has achieved this. The Storm continued their success into the 2017 NRL finals and won their first two, a home Qualifying final against the Parramatta Eels 18–16 and a home Preliminary Final against Brisbane 30–0 to qualify them for their second consecutive Grand Final. The 2017 NRL Grand Final was played against the North Queensland Cowboys, which Melbourne dominated to earn them their 3rd official Premiership 34–6. Billy Slater won his second Clive Churchill medal. In December 2017, the NRL announced the formation of a women&#x27;s competition with Melbourne Storm expressing their interest in applying for a licence to participate in the inaugural NRL Women&#x27;s season.

===2018–2022: 20th anniversary and 4th premiership===
Following the club&#x27;s premiership in 2017, the Storm hosted the 2018 World Club Challenge at AAMI Park in February and also defeated the Leeds Rhinos to win the title 38–4. 2018 was also a special year for the club as it celebrated its 20th anniversary and in March announced their team of the first 20 years during a gala evening at Crown Casino. Continuing on from the success in 2017, the Storm once again played very well throughout the year ultimately being pipped for the Minor Premiership on points difference. The Storm once again made the grand final, however, lost to the Sydney Roosters to end the season runner-up.

In 2019, the club returned to the top of the table, winning the Minor Premiership finishing six points ahead of the Sydney Roosters, however, their finals campaign was not as successful with ultimately exiting the finals after a defeat in the preliminary final once again to the Roosters. Club captain Cameron Smith also achieved a number of significant milestones throughout the 2019 season, including captaining his 300th game, becoming the game&#x27;s highest points scorer and also playing his 400th NRL game – the first NRL player to do so.

The Storm were looking to continue their success into 2020 but 2020 became somewhat of an extraordinary year. The global COVID-19 pandemic hit Australia in late February forcing all games behind closed doors and then a total suspension and reorganization of the season. After the situation in Victoria deteriorated in June, the Storm were forced to relocate to the Sunshine Coast in Queensland to complete their season. Melbourne would go on to finish second on the table at the end of the 2020 regular season behind Minor Premiers Penrith, before beating Penrith in the 2020 NRL Grand Final to win their fourth official premiership, and cementing their status as one of the most successful clubs of the modern NRL era.

In 2021, long term captain Cameron Smith announced his retirement after 430 game and both Jesse Bromwich and Dale Finucane were announced as co-captains. On-field, the Melbourne club had some early hiccups adjusting to life after Smith, however, from round four, began a winning streak that lasted until Round 23 – 19 consecutive wins, becoming the first team since the Sydney Roosters in 1975 to complete this feat. This was made all the more remarkable because for the second consecutive season the club were forced to once again relocate to Queensland from Round 9 onwards due to COVID-19 outbreaks in NSW and Victoria. The winning run helped them to win the Minor Premiership finishing in first place at the end of the season, however the club failed to make the grand final losing the preliminary final to Penrith. The club also broke a number of other points scoring records throughout the season including finishing with the highest ever points differential (499 points). Individually, Josh Addo-Carr also scored a club record six tries in a single game against South Sydney.

Melbourne started the 2022 NRL season strongly winning seven of their opening eight matches with their only defeat coming against Parramatta. In round 10 however, Melbourne were defeated 32–6 by Premiers Penrith. The following week, Melbourne suffered their biggest loss in the competition since round 18 of the 2013 NRL season when they were defeated 36–6 by North Queensland. In round 18 of the 2022 NRL season, Melbourne were defeated 20–16 by Canberra which meant they had lost three straight matches for the first time since the 2015 NRL season. Melbourne would finish the 2022 regular season in fifth place on the table which was their lowest finish since the 2014 NRL season. In the elimination final, Melbourne were upset 28–20 by Canberra which ended their season.

==Emblem and colours==
=== Name ===
Originally, the club favoured the name Melbourne Mavericks with a gunslinger logo holding a fistful of dollars. The club officials were all set to go with this until News Limited&#x27;s Lachlan Murdoch told them to go with something else because the Mavericks sounded too American. Trams and Flying Foxes were also some ideas that came up. However, CEO Chris Johns and Executive Director John Ribot decided to go with the themes of lightning, power and following a naming competition, the club eventually settled on the name Melbourne Storm. Melbourne teenager Cameron Duncan came up with the name &quot;Storm&quot;, with his winning entry chosen from more than 1000 received.

=== Colours ===

The Storm were always going to go with the colours of their state, Victoria (navy blue with a white &#x27;V&#x27;), but club consultant at the time, Peter McWhirter of the JAG fashion house, suggested that they should also have purple and gold to make their merchandise more attractive. Therefore, the official colours of the Storm are navy blue and purple (main colours) and white and yellow (minor colours).

All four of these colours appeared in the logo until yellow was removed in 2018. In the home jersey, the colours have varied over the years. Between 1998 and 2004 these four colours appeared on various designs but between 2005 and 2009, gold was completely removed and silver introduced. Between 2010 and 2012, gold returned, silver was omitted and purple became the dominant colour in the jersey. For 2013 a new design was announced featuring a deeper V, with more navy blue in the jersey. Gold disappeared again along with most of the white, and the lightning bolts were changed to purple. During 2015 the jersey changed again, for the first time not featuring a V at all, but the V returned somewhat along with the lightning bolts in 2016 with a manufacturer change. In 2018 and 19 the club wore a traditional V uniform and all colours were present, however, for 2020 the jersey has returned to an all navy blue and purple jersey.

Between 1998 and 2001, Melbourne was the only club to display player names on the back of jerseys. This was because there was no major sponsor for the Storm to display on the chest or back at the time. It also helped supporters new to the game identify the players. In 2001, Melbourne gained its first major sponsor in Adecco, which was displayed on the jersey chest, while maintaining the players&#x27; names on the back until the end of 2001. In 2002, the Storm removed the players&#x27; names and displayed Adecco&#x27;s logo on the back. Since then the Storm have had varying sponsors adorning the jersey.

The club&#x27;s original logo of &quot;Storm Man&quot; riding over storm clouds and throwing a bolt of lightning was in place from the club&#x27;s inception through to the end of the 2017 season. The only variation to this was when an informal logo for the 10th Anniversary was produced however this was only featured on supporter merchandise and not in an official capacity on the jersey. As part of the club&#x27;s 20th Anniversary, the Storm introduced a new logo used throughout the 2018 season. The logo was a shield based logo with the storm man featured above the words &quot;Melbourne Storm 20 Years&quot;. As the celebrations concluded, the club rebranded and replaced the 20th Anniversary logo with another new logo. The current Logo is a derivation of the 20-year logo featuring no shield and a more bold &quot;Melbourne Storm&quot; and the club has also dropped the colour Yellow from the logo. There is also a second official version of this logo in all white which features on the home jersey.

==Club song==
The Melbourne Storm have a number of club songs that are either played over the PA system or exclusively sung by the players at each game;

The main song, which was written by Jon Mol and Phil Wall, is called &quot;We Are the Storm&quot; and is played over the public address system following each home victory.

In addition, AC/DC song &quot;Thunderstruck&quot; is played at every home game as the team enter the stadium.

Lastly, after each victory, the Storm players also sing &quot;We are the mighty Melbourne Storm&quot; in the dressing rooms. The song is sung to the same tune as the US Marines&#x27; Hymn.

==Rivalries==
===St. George Illawarra Dragons===
The St. George Illawarra and Melbourne rivalry was at its highest in the years following the 1999 NRL Grand Final. In this game, Melbourne narrowly beat St. George Illawarra, with a late penalty try putting the Melbourne club in front. The following year, Anthony Mundine declared that the Melbourne side were not &quot;worthy premiers&quot; in the run up to their round 5 rematch. Melbourne responded by belting St. George Illawarra 70–10.

However, later that season, St. George Illawarra had a large win defeating Melbourne 50–4. In 2006, Melbourne and St. George Illawarra once again met in a Preliminary Final which Melbourne won. On 21 July 2008, Melbourne won at Olympic Park 26–0, in a match highlighted by several ugly brawls.

In 2009, the Melbourne club defeated St. George Illawarra 17–16 in Round 1 with a field goal in Golden Point extra time.

In recent years, this rivalry has somewhat diminished.

===Brisbane Broncos===
The Melbourne Storm has a rivalry with Brisbane, built in large part on the large number of finals games played between the teams, including one final in each year from 2004 to 2009, with the Melbourne club winning all but one of them. The move of Brisbane assistant coach Craig Bellamy to Melbourne has also been attributed to fueling the rivalry, as well as the wide spread of Queensland Origin players across their squads in the better part of the past decade.

Every year since Brisbane&#x27;s victory over Melbourne in the 2006 Grand Final, Melbourne have ended Brisbane&#x27;s season by knocking them out of the finals. Melbourne captain Cameron Smith commented on the rivalry prior to their 2009 Preliminary Final at Etihad Stadium.

The Brisbane Broncos defeated Melbourne 15–8 in the 2006 NRL Grand Final. Melbourne sought revenge through a 40–0 thrashing in the 2007 Qualifying Final at Olympic Park Stadium. The 2008 Semi-Final at Suncorp Stadium ended with Melbourne dramatically winning 16–14 with a try on the final play of the game. In 2009, Brisbane were again beaten by eventual premiers Melbourne, this time 40–10 at Etihad Stadium, catapulting the Melbourne club to their 4th consecutive Grand Final Appearance. In 2017, the two sides met in the preliminary final where Melbourne defeated Brisbane 30–0. Since the 2006 Grand Final, Melbourne have only lost to Brisbane five times across 36 matches.

In round 27 of the 2023 NRL season, the two sides met in the final round of the regular campaign. Brisbane and Melbourne both rested several players as each team had qualified for the finals. Melbourne would go on to win the game 32–22 which denied Brisbane their first Minor Premiership since the 2000 NRL season. The two sides met the following week in the 2023 qualifying final with Brisbane defeating Melbourne 26–0 to book a place in the preliminary final. It was the first time Brisbane had beaten Melbourne at Suncorp Stadium since 2009 and the first time that they had defeated Melbourne in 14 attempts.

===Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles===

The origin of the rivalry stems back the period between 2007 and 2012 when both clubs were consistently at the top of the table.

In the 2007 NRL Grand Final, Melbourne defeated Manly 34–8 and then the following year in the 2008 NRL Grand Final, lost to the Manly club 40 nil. The following season the clubs once again met in the finals series and this time it was Melbourne who ended Manly-Warringah&#x27;s season, and their bid for back to back titles, with a 40–12 defeat in the 2009 qualifying final.

In 2011 the rivalry escalated when another major chapter was written in what became known as the &quot;Battle of Brookvale&quot;. This game involved a massive brawl that began on the field and then continued as the two key players involved were being sent off. The melee ultimately involved interchange players and officials from both clubs as well. What made this worse was that the match was attended by then CEO of the NRL David Gallop who condemned the actions of both clubs.

In the years following this match, matches between Manly-Warringah and Melbourne played at Brookvale Oval continued to often be called the &quot;Battle of Brookvale&quot;, though there have not been any particularly violent matches between the two sides at this venue since.

In 2012, there was a similar scenario as 2009 when the clubs met in the Preliminary Final, Melbourne again defeated Manly 40–12, again ending their chances of winning back-to-back titles after the Manly-Warringah club won the title in 2011.

The matches between the two sides simmered over the next decade, however, in the 2021 NRL Finals Series the two clubs once again met, this time a Qualifying Final, Melbourne again defeated Manly and curiously, the score line was again 40–12, the third time this had occurred.

===New Zealand Warriors===
This is more of a traditional game due to the large number of Kiwi internationals Melbourne has fielded in their history. Matches between the two clubs are normally close and low scoring, with the overall head to head (as of 2020) in Melbourne&#x27;s favour (45 clashes, Melbourne 27 – Warriors 16 and 2 draws). These two sides played an annual ANZAC Day clash each year between 2009 and 2014. In 2015 it was not scheduled so the Warriors could celebrate the 100th anniversary of ANZAC Day at home. From 2016 onwards (with the exception of 2020), it has been played on every ANZAC Day since. Both teams play for the Michael Moore Trophy.

The two sides have met each other twice in the finals series. The first being in week one of the 2008 finals series where New Zealand pulled off one of the biggest finals upsets defeating Melbourne 18–15. New Zealand had finished the season in eighth whilst Melbourne had finished as Minor Premiers. In 2011, the two clubs met in the preliminary final where Melbourne was defeated by New Zealand in a major upset, thus falling one match short of the 2011 NRL Grand Final.

===Sydney Roosters===
This competitive rivalry began in the 2017 NRL season when the two clubs met in Round 16 at the Adelaide Oval. The Sydney Roosters won a very tight game in Golden Point 25–24 then only seven weeks later, Melbourne won the return game 16–13 at AAMI Park. In this game, the Sydney Roosters were leading 13–12 after 73 minutes after kicking a field goal before Joe Stimson scored a late try to steal the win just before full time. The competitive nature with the Sydney Roosters increased in the off season when long time player Cooper Cronk announced that he was moving to Sydney and joining the club for 2018.

In the 2018 premiership season, the two clubs only played one game, again at the Adelaide Oval. It was another tight game which this time Melbourne won 9–8 with Cameron Smith kicking a late field goal to snatch victory. The two clubs remained neck and neck at the top of the table with the Sydney Roosters pipping Melbourne for the minor premiership on points difference. The two clubs did not meet until the 2018 NRL Grand Final with the Sydney Roosters winning 21–6. In the game, Cooper Cronk playing injured, assumed a virtual on-field player-coach role, using his years of Grand Final experience to help the Roosters defeat the Melbourne side.

In 2019, the teams clashed twice during the season and both games were close. On Good Friday the Roosters defeated Melbourne 21–20 in Golden point overtime before the teams met once again in Adelaide, with Melbourne prevailing 14–12. The third clash of the year was the preliminary final, which the Sydney Roosters won 14–6 at the SCG.

With the 2020 NRL season disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, Melbourne&#x27;s Round 8 &quot;home&quot; game against the Roosters was transferred to Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane. In a game that produced one of the more extraordinary finishes to an NRL game, the Roosters were leading 22–12 with 12 minutes left when Melbourne then scored two tries to take a 24–22 lead. The game was then tied up by a penalty goal to the Roosters before they also scored a 78th minute field goal to lead 25–24. With seconds remaining, Melbourne&#x27;s Ryan Papenhuyzen scored a field goal of his own to tie scores up again at 25 all and send the game into Golden Point. Melbourne won the game with Cameron Smith kicking a penalty goal.

As of the end of the 2021 NRL season, the clubs met a further three times with Melbourne winning all three games including defeating the Roosters 46–0 in round 16 of the 2021 season.

The fixture re-ignited in 2022 in round 24 when the Sydney Roosters narrowly defeated Melbourne 18–14 after the Roosters lead 14–0. It was a particularly spiteful game that included repeat melees and sin bins for players on both sides. Sydney Roosters player Jared Waerea-Hargreaves was sin binned following the referee repeatedly warning both sides to fall in line. The game also came on the back of Hooker, Brandon Smith, transferring to the club for the 2023 season.
The two sides met in the second week of the 2023 NRL finals series. Melbourne were heavy favourites going into the game but with only minutes remaining the Sydney Roosters were in front 13-12. This was until with three minutes to go Melbourne scored a try through William Warbrick to win the match 18-13. The match wasn&#x27;t without controversy due to Melbourne scoring a try in the first half which came directly after Harry Grant had knocked the ball on from a cross-field kick.

===Penrith Panthers===
This rivalry began in the last round of 2018 when the Panthers beat Storm 22-16 in Melbourne, denying the Storm from winning the minor premiership that year. Prior to this match the Panthers had a very poor record against the Storm, only defeating them once out of their previous eighteen matches dating back to the beginning of 2006.

However, since 2020, their rivalry has really intensified, starting from the 2020 NRL Grand Final where the Storm won 26-20, ending Panthers 17 game winning streak.

In 2021, they played each other twice, including a close encounter in Round 3 where Panthers hung on to win 12-10 in an entertaining game. They met again in the preliminary finals where Panthers won 10-6 the week before they went on to beat South Sydney in the 2021 NRL Grand Final.

In 2023, they would meet again in the preliminary finals, with Penrith winning comfortably 38-4.

In 2024, they played each other twice with the Storm winning both encounters, the first encounter they won 8-0 in Round 1 and the second encounter they won 24-22, denying the Panthers the chance to win the minor premiership in 2024.

==Stadium and attendances==

Melbourne&#x27;s current home ground is AAMI Park and has been since the 2010 season. Prior to this the club played the vast majority of their home matches at the city&#x27;s now demolished Olympic Park Stadium, which was located next door. Affectionately coined &quot;The Graveyard&quot; by fans due to the incredible 77.2% winning percentage there, it was there that the club played their inaugural home match in the fourth round of the 1998 season on 3 April 1998, having come off the back of three successive away victories. The team recorded a 26–16 victory over the North Sydney Bears, and the crowd of 20,522 was the largest attendance for the club at Olympic Park.

It was also at this time that Melbourne Storm helped set a Rugby League World record attendance figure of 107,999. This was during the 1999 NRL Grand final, held at Stadium Australia where they defeated the St George Illawarra Dragons, to win their first NRL premiership. As the ground&#x27;s capacity has since been reduced this record cannot be broken.
The team remained at Olympic Park until the end of the 2000 season, when it was decided that due to attracting larger home crowds which were now averaging 14,622 spectators, they decided to relocate to the much larger capacity Docklands Stadium for the following season. However, due to Docklands stadium being primarily suited to AFL games and in addition the AFL and stadium management being reluctant to reconfigure the seating for Rugby League games and coupled with the team missing the finals that year, crowd numbers declined and it was decided to move the team back to Olympic Park. Docklands stadium was still used by the Storm for home finals until 2010 and this allowed a home final attendance record of 33,427 to be set in 2007 in the Preliminary Final against Parramatta.

From 2002, crowd numbers declined and by 2004 the Storm had their lowest crowd average of 8,886 per home game; however, at this time the Storm also began a strong recruiting drive and with a new and exciting playing roster, crowds steadily rose over the following years, returning to an average of 14,670 by 2010. The Storm played their final game at Olympic Park in round 25 of the 2009 season, 29 August 2009, with a 36–4 thrashing of the Sydney Roosters The intention was to relocate to its new home venue next door at AAMI Park; however, delays in construction meant that the first game could not be played at the venue until Round 9 of the 2010 season, therefore, the first three home games of 2010 were played at Etihad Stadium. Since then all Storm home games (with the exception of a few homes games played interstate), regular season and finals, have been played at AAMI Park.

Following winning the 2012 premiership and having sustained onfield success, crowd numbers continued to rise. The club&#x27;s highest regular season attendance at AAMI Park, of 28,716, was set on 25 April 2014 for the ANZAC Day match against New Zealand Warriors. Average crowds have continued to increase and by the end of the 2017 season, another premiership year, had reached a record peak of 18,375. The club&#x27;s highest official &quot;home&quot; attendance of 52,347 occurred in the 2016 season – this was during a doubleheader game at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane.

For most of the 2020 and much of the 2021 seasons, the Storm played their home games at Sunshine Coast Stadium on Queensland&#x27;s Sunshine Coast, due to Victoria&#x27;s strict COVID-19 policies.

==Statistics and records==

As of the end of the 2024 NRL season, the Storm have won four NRL Premierships (1999, 2012, 2017 and 2020) and six Minor Premierships (2011, 2016, 2017, 2019, 2021, 2024). A further two NRL premierships (2007 and 2009) and three minor premierships (2006, 2007, 2008) were withheld due to salary cap breaches. Their current wins percentage of 67.14% is the best in the league. The most capped player is Cameron Smith with 430 NRL appearances in his career. Smith&#x27;s total is also the current league record and he also the only NRL player in history to reach the 400 game mark. In addition, Smith is also the league&#x27;s highest point scorer with 2786 career points. Fullback Billy Slater is the club&#x27;s most prolific try scorer with 190 tries scored during his career. Melbourne Storm players have also won the Dally M medal on six occasions with Smith winning in 2006 and 2017, Slater in 2011, Cooper Cronk in 2013 and 2016 and most recently Jahrome Hughes in 2024. The Storm have thus far had five Golden Boot award winners, more than any other club (Smith 2007 and 2017, Slater 2008, Greg Inglis 2009 and Cronk in 2016).

Melbourne Storm&#x27;s winning streak record for the most consecutive matches won stands at 19 matches, between round 4 and round 23 of the 2021 NRL season. This is equal to the league record set in 1975 by Eastern Suburbs. The club&#x27;s all-time highest score is 70 points which they have scored on two occasions, on 3 March 2000 against St. George Illawarra and on 25 April 2022 vs New Zealand Warriors. Their highest winning margin is 64 points which they&#x27;ve achieved twice, first in a 64–0 win over West Tigers in 2001, and then again in a 68–4 win over Canberra Raiders in 2013.

==Feeder clubs==
In 1998, the Storm established an affiliation with Queensland Cup side the Norths Devils and used the club as a feeder for their first grade team. The relationship would prove to be a fruitful one as 13 of the 17 players to compete for the Storm in the 2006 NRL Grand Final had played for the Devils in previous years. In 2005, the Storm also established an affiliation with the North Sydney Bears in the New South Wales Cup. Melbourne severed ties with both the Bears (end of 2006) and the Devils (end of 2007) and aligned themselves with the Central Coast Storm in the New South Wales Cup. The affiliation lasted two seasons before the Storm decided to establish their own team in the NSW Cup in 2010 which would share its namesake. An unsuccessful venture saw the Storm revert to the Queensland Cup in 2011 when it established a feeder relationship with the Easts Tigers (now known as Brisbane Tigers). Melbourne established a second feeder relationship with the Sunshine Coast Falcons in 2014, also from the Queensland Cup. The Storm further committed to the area in 2015 when it was announced their National Youth Competition U20 side would be based out of the Sunshine Coast from 2016.

<doc id="673805" wikidata="Q7496158" url="?curid=673805" title="Shield laws in the United States">
<text>Shield laws in the United States are designed to protect reporters&#x27; privilege or to prevent prosecution when states’ laws differ, especially on the issue of abortion.
Reporters’ privilege involves the right of media to refuse to testify as to the information and/or sources of information obtained during the news gathering and dissemination process. Currently, the United States federal government has not enacted any national reporters&#x27; privilege shield laws, but most of the 50 states do have shield laws or other protections for reporters.
==Definition==
A shield law is a law that gives reporters protection against being forced to disclose confidential information or sources in state court. There is no federal shield law and state shield laws vary in scope. In general, however, a shield law aims to provide the protection of: &quot;a reporter cannot be forced to reveal his or her source&quot;. Thus, a shield law provides a privilege to a reporter pursuant to which the reporter cannot be forced by a subpoena or other court order to testify about information contained in a news story and/or the source of that information. Several shield laws additionally provide protection for the reporter even if the source or information is revealed during the dissemination of the news story, that is whether or not the source or information is confidential. Depending on the jurisdiction, the privilege may be total or qualified, and it may also apply to other persons involved in the news-gathering and dissemination process as well, such as an editor or a publisher. However, shield laws do not ensure absolute protection.

==Origins==
The issue of whether or not journalists can be subpoenaed and forced to reveal confidential information arose in 1972 with the United States Supreme Court case &quot;Branzburg v. Hayes&quot;. Paul Branzburg was a reporter for &quot;The Courier-Journal&quot; in Louisville, Kentucky and wrote an article about the drug hashish. In creating the article, he came in contact with two local citizens who had created and used the drug. Because their activity was illegal, Branzburg promised the two individuals that he would not reveal their identities. After the article was published, Branzburg was subpoenaed by a local grand jury and ordered to reveal the identity of his sources. Branzburg refused and cited the provisions for freedom of the press from the First Amendment to the United States Constitution in his defense.

The Supreme Court decided in a five to four decision that the press did not have a Constitutional right of protection from revealing confidential information in court. The court acknowledged, however, that the government must &quot;convincingly show a substantial relation between the information sought and a subject of overriding and compelling state interest.&quot; While this ruling did not set a precedent for journalistic rights in court, it did define a more stringent set of requirements for when a journalist could be subpoenaed in court.

This ruling was limited in nature, did not set a clear federal precedent regarding journalistic privileges from revealing confidential information, and thus has been interpreted and cited differently by courts over the years. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals, for instance, has gleaned a qualified First Amendment privilege from the &quot;Branzburg&quot; decision. In &quot;Riley v. City of Chester&quot;, the Court held that a reporter&#x27;s right to protect his sources from disclosure could be overcome by a party who, by a preponderance of the evidence, demonstrated that he has made an effort to obtain the information elsewhere, that the only access to the information sought is through the journalist and his or her source, and that the information sought is crucial to the case. 612 F.2d 708 (3rd Cir. 1979).

==State laws==

States differ on their approach to protecting reporter&#x27;s privilege. , 49 states and the District of Columbia offer some form of protections Forty states (plus D.C.) have passed shield laws. These laws vary from state to state. Some protections apply to civil but not to criminal proceedings. Other laws protect journalists from revealing confidential sources, but not other information. Many states have also established court precedents which provide protection to journalists, usually based on constitutional arguments. Only Wyoming lacks both legislation and judicial precedent to protect reporter&#x27;s privilege.

==Current issues==

Proponents of shield laws argue that they ensure that news gatherers may do their jobs to their fullest ability and that they help avoid a dichotomy between state laws and journalistic ethics, but the differences between states&#x27; laws has raised questions regarding which laws apply where in regard to national reporting. Proponents argue that a federal shield law should exist to eliminate contradictions between state laws.

Opponents argue that shield laws afford extra privileges to journalists and that no citizen should be able to ignore a court ordered subpoena. Opponents also cite problems with defining who is considered a journalist or news gatherer and who is not, and note that if journalists get special protection from the government, then they are getting special journalistic benefits from the government instead of acting in complete independence. Some opponents also argue that journalists are often forced to testify by federal courts only in cases where a federal shield law likely would not protect them anyway. Finally, the federal government may not have constitutional right to enforce a shield law on state courts.

Many journalists, however, are subpoenaed to testify in criminal and civil cases for coverage of a variety of matters that do not involve questions of national security. In recent years, there have been bills for federal shield laws in the United States Congress; however, none of these bills have passed the Senate. A primary objection to recent efforts to pass a federal shield law has been concern about leaks of classified information, particularly given the modern potential of such leaks to be published globally on the Internet by non-traditional recipients, such as WikiLeaks, who might claim to be &quot;journalists&quot; under an unqualified shield law.

Sometimes, the press is not even immune from its sources, such as when the source wishes to remain anonymous and the journalist wishes to disclose it. Such was the case in &quot;Cohen v. Cowles Media Co.&quot; (1991). The Supreme Court upheld that a source may have a right to confidentiality if an agreement was made with the reporter. Unfortunately, the bigger issue of source disclosure gets even more confusing, since the &quot;Cohen&quot; and &quot;Branzburg&quot; decisions could allow for the possibility of a journalist being subpoenaed by a court to disclose the name of a source, and being sued by a source under promissory estoppel laws for that disclosure. The current laws of the land, and the gray areas of forecasting potential consequences of publishing a story with confidential sources places the press in a very precarious situation. The current shield laws in some states give the press somewhat of an upper hand. However, since federal law does not recognize reportorial privilege in most cases, it is understandable how the press might feel muzzled.

The shield law privilege may also be waived by a reporter, as the New Jersey Supreme Court recently found in the case of &quot;In re Michael G. Venezia&quot;. In that case, a New Jersey newspaper published an article containing defamatory statements about the plaintiff. The article attributed the statements to a source who was identified by name in the article; the source later denied making the defamatory statements. The plaintiff filed a defamation lawsuit against the newspaper, the reporter and the alleged source of the defamatory statements. When the plaintiff sought to question the newspaper reporter about the article, the reporter and his newspaper refused, claiming protection under New Jersey&#x27;s shield law. It was discovered, however, that the reporter had already given a statement under oath concerning the article—and, most important, the alleged source of the statement and exactly what that source said—to a local county prosecutor&#x27;s office. The reporter also talked about his source and what the source said with a local municipal attorney. The &quot;Venezia&quot; court unanimously held that, while New Jersey has arguably the most protective shield law in the United States, a reporter waives the privilege when he talks about his sources and information outside of the newsgathering process, as did the reporter in &quot;Venezia.&quot; The &quot;Venezia&quot; court stated: &quot;The privilege holder is not permitted to step from behind the shield as he pleases, sallying forth one moment to make a disclosure to one person and then to seek the shield&#x27;s protection from having to repeat the same disclosure to another person. A reporter cannot play peek-a-boo with the privilege.&quot; Thus, the &quot;Venezia&quot; court ordered that the reporter must submit to the plaintiff&#x27;s deposition request. &quot;Venezia&quot; is highly significant because it marks the first time that a reporter has ever been found to have waived the privilege under New Jersey&#x27;s current shield law, and because it explores the issue of what is or is not a &quot;newsgathering activity,&quot; and, thus, what activities are subject to protection under the law.

Currently, courts are struggling to define the standards for when shield laws should apply to non-traditional media outlets, particularly in the context of blogs and Internet publishing. In &quot;Obsidian Finance Group, LLC v. Cox&quot;, the United States District Court for the District of Oregon found that to qualify as a reporter, a standard of professionalism must be met, including but not limited to being associated with a traditional news print or television media outlet or obtaining a journalism degree. A subsequent opinion in the same case clarified that these were examples and not requirements; bloggers could qualify, and the denial of media status in the Cox case appears to have been largely motivated by the defendant reportedly offering to remove accusations for a substantial fee. Conversely, in &quot;The Mortgage Specialists, Inc. v. Implode-Explode Heavy Industries, Inc.&quot; the New Hampshire Supreme Court adopted a much broader definition of media that applies to blogs and website curators, reiterating that &quot;freedom of the press is a fundamental personal right which is not confined to newspapers and periodicals.&quot;

In July 2013 the White House was pushing for a federal media shield law named the Free Flow of Information Act authored by U.S. Senators Charles Schumer and Lindsey Graham. Under the bill, the scope of protection for reporters would vary according to whether it was a civil case, an ordinary criminal case or a national security case. The greatest protection would be given to civil cases, in which litigants seeking to force reporters to testify or trying to obtain their calling information would be required to show why their need for the information outweighed the public&#x27;s interest in unfettered news gathering. Ordinary criminal cases would work in a similar fashion, except the burden would be on the reporter seeking to quash the subpoena to show by a &quot;clear and convincing&quot; standard that the public interest in the free flow of information should prevail over the needs of law enforcement. Cases involving the disclosure of classified information would be more heavily tilted toward the government. Judges could not quash a subpoena through a balancing test if prosecutors presented facts showing that the information sought might help prevent a terrorist attack or other acts likely to harm national security. The legislation would create a presumption that when the government is seeking calling records from a telephone carrier, the news organization would be notified ahead of time, allowing it to fight the subpoena in court. But the bill would also allow the government to seek a 45- to 90-day delay in notification if a court determines that such notice would threaten the integrity of the investigation. The legislation would also include an exception where journalists could be subpoenaed if it means national security is at risk.

== PRESS Act ==
The Protect Reporters from Exploitative State Spying Act (PRESS Act, S.2074) is a bipartisan federal shield law designed to protect journalist-source confidentiality, with common-sense exceptions for cases involving terrorism, serious emergencies, or journalists suspected of crimes. In January 2024, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the legislation unanimously. The bill broadly defines &quot;covered journalist&quot; to include anyone engaged in gathering, preparing, reporting, or publishing news or information of public interest, ensuring protection for both professional and unconventional journalists, as well as emerging outlets that may struggle against subpoenas. As of October 2024, it was awaiting consideration by the Senate Judiciary Committee, where it has bipartisan support, including three Republican sponsors. The bill has faced opposition from a small group of conservative senators, notably Tom Cotton (R-AR), who argue it could undermine law enforcement and national security. 

== Related issues ==
In recent years, a larger effort by journalists to press for federal shield laws formed following the Plame affair, in which reporters who released the name of Valerie Plame were asked who their sources were. One of the reporters, Judith Miller of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, was jailed for 85 days in 2005 for refusing to disclose her source in the government probe.

There is also a question about whether or not journalists should be exempt from national security laws.

==Shield laws for medical practitioners==

In 2023 a paper was published in the &quot;Columbia Law Review&quot; about ways in which shield laws could protect medical practitioners providing abortion who treated patients in US states that prohibited abortion. Following publication of the paper, several states passed shield laws for medical practitioners. fifteen states had such shield laws, and five had telemedicine provisions, specifically protecting a provider who prescribed and mailed abortion pills to a patient in a state where abortion was banned. From 18 June 2023 Aid Access mailed medication to patients throughout the US with providers licensed in the five states with telemedicine provisions, with no need to ship from other countries as had been necessary before. It was expected that legal battles would follow as the shield laws were tested in court. Patients themselves were not protected by the shield laws, and remained subject to prosecution for self-managing abortions.

<text>The ACT Brumbies (known from 2005 to 2022 as simply the Brumbies) is an Australian professional rugby union team based in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory (ACT), The team competes in Super Rugby and named for the feral horses which inhabit the capital&#x27;s hinterland. The team represents the ACT, as well as the Far South Coast and Southern Inland regions of New South Wales (NSW).

The Brumbies were formed in 1996 to provide a third Australian franchise for the newly formed Super 12 (now Super Rugby) competition. It was predicted that the Brumbies, made up of so-called &#x27;rejects&#x27; – players not wanted by the other two teams – would perform poorly. Since then, they have enjoyed more success than all the other Australian teams combined, reaching seven finals and winning three. The Brumbies are traditionally known for their strong tactical kicking, set piece play, ball retention, and pressuring of opponents in their own half. The Brumbies are one of only two Super Rugby teams to win 200 games.

The Brumbies play in navy blue, white and gold kits. The team plays at Canberra Stadium (formerly known as Bruce Stadium) in Canberra, and are currently coached by Stephen Larkham.

==History==


=== Early years of rugby in ACT===
Rugby union football has a long history in the region around what is now Canberra. The British Isles opened their 1899 tour of Australia with a match in Goulburn. However, it was not until 1937 that the ACT Rugby Union (ACTRU) was finally established. Lieutenant-Colonel H. C. H. Robertson was the first President of the ACTRU.

The First Grade competition was started on 30 April 1938. Four clubs playing in the inaugural season: University, Easts, the Royal Military College (RMC), and Norths. There were strict eligibility rules for each of the four teams:
* University players were required to be graduates or undergraduates at a university (at the time, Canberra University College, operated by the University of Melbourne, was the only university in Canberra);
* Only service personnel, not members of RMC staff, were entitled join RMC; and,
* Easts and Norths players had to be residentially qualified for two months.
Also in 1938, a representative ACT side faced off against the All Blacks, with Frank Hassett scoring the ACT&#x27;s only try in a 5–56 loss.

Five ACT players were chosen for New South Wales Country in their 1966 match against the British &amp; Irish Lions at Manuka Oval:
* Barry Sibley (Canberra Royals);
* David Grimmond (Queanbeyan Whites);
* Mel Dunn (Ainslie Rugby Football Club);
* Peter Ryan (Queanbeyan Whites); and,
* Bruce Bailey (Goulburn Dirty Reds).
The first international victory for the ACT was in 1973, when they defeated Tonga 17–6 after trailing 0–3 at half time. The ACT team were praised for their hard work, stamina, and willingness to take shots at goal when they were on offer. In 1978, the ACT defeated Wales, who were Five Nations champions at the time, with a late penalty goal to win 21–20 after trailing 6–16 at half time. Head coach Colin Maxwell explained that his team beat the best team in the world by being &quot;the first team in Australia to take them on up the guts&quot;, with the ACT forwards starving the Welsh of possession and the team ensuring territorial advantage through pressure on the Welsh kickers. Tactical kicking, ball retention, and pressuring opponents in their own half are still considered to be &quot;The Brumbies&#x27; ... traditional strength[s]&quot;.

The ACT adopted the name &#x27;Kookaburras&#x27; in 1989. The Kookaburras defeated the Waratahs 44–28 at Sydney&#x27;s Concord Oval in 1994. The Waratahs team was filled with international representatives, which made the Kookaburras win all the more impressive, and led the way for the ACT becoming a professional franchise. Concerns over player depth in the ACT were assuaged when the ACT reserve team beat the New South Wales reserve team.

The ACT Brumbies was formally established on 9 December 1995 in Jindabyne, Southern New South Wales and became Australia&#x27;s third provincial team with the start of Super Rugby.

===Super 12 era: 1996–2005===
In the inaugural Super 12 season, under coach Rod Macqueen, the Brumbies finished fifth on the table after the regular season, narrowly missing out on a finals position. The following season was even more successful as the Brumbies entered the 1997 Super 12 Final, but lost to the Auckland Blues.

Eddie Jones took over as head coach in 1998, but the Brumbies fell to tenth place on the 1998 season ladder. However, the following season saw a big improvement, as they finished fifth for the second time in their Super rugby history, just missing out on the finals. In 2000, the Brumbies made it to the 2000 Super 12 Final for the second time, and were actually hosting it as well. They were however beaten by the Crusaders, losing 19 to 20.

In 2001 they backed up their good performance in 2000 to again enter the final, this time against the Sharks from Durban. The Brumbies won the match, and in doing so, became the first team outside of New Zealand to be crowned Super 12 champions (and the only such team in the Super 12 era; the Bulls of South Africa won the 2007 Super 14). That year the British Lions also came to Australia, and played a match against the Brumbies. The combined strength of four nations was pitted against the Brumbies Second XV with the tourists winning by just two points, 30 to 28.

David Nucifora took over as head coach at the Brumbies for the 2002 season. Under Nucifora the Brumbies entered their third Super 12 final in a row, again against the Crusaders who had defeated them in the 2000 final. The Crusaders won the match, 31 to 13. The following season, going for four straight final appearances, the Brumbies fell just short, being knocked out in the semi-finals by the Blues. They did however go on to beat Fiji and Tonga later that year.

In 2004 the Brumbies finished at the top of the Super 12 table, six points clear of the next best team. The Brumbies hosted the 2004 Super 12 Final as well, and were to face the Crusaders once again. Though this time, the Brumbies won, 47 to 38 in front of a record crowd at Canberra Stadium. During the off-season the ACT Rugby Union was renamed the ACT and Southern NSW Rugby Union, and the name of the team was changed to Brumbies Rugby.

Laurie Fisher took over as coach for the 2005 season. After an undefeated run in the early stages of the season, injuries began to mount up and the Brumbies eventually finished fifth, missing out on the finals. The following year the competition was expanded to the Super 14, introducing one new team from Australia and one new team from South Africa.

===Super 14 era: 2006–2010===

In 2006 the Brumbies finished sixth, missing out on the finals by 1 point, having never dropped out of the top four all season prior to the last round. Later that year the Brumbies played in the inaugural Australian Provincial Championship (APC). In their opening game they defeated the NSW Waratahs 14–13 at Viking Park. This win snapped a 3-game losing streak against their traditional rivals. They then went on to defeat the Western Force 25–10, again at Viking Park. Despite narrowly losing, 20–19, to the Queensland Reds on the road in Brisbane, the Brumbies won the right to face the Reds in the final back in Viking Park. They won this more comfortably, 42–17, securing the inaugural APC.

The side failed to make the playoffs at all during Super 14, though they never finished lower than ninth.

===Super Rugby era: 2011–present===
After a succession of coaches over the same period, including Laurie Fisher, Andy Friend and Tony Rea, former South Africa coach Jake White took over as coach of the side in April 2011, signing a four-year deal with the club. However, he was granted a release from his contract in September 2013, with two years left on his four-year contract.

In 2012, the Brumbies became the first Australian Super Rugby team to host an international fixture against a touring side. On 12 June, the Brumbies played Wales at Canberra Stadium while Wales was on their 2012 Summer tour. Wales won 25–15.

The Brumbies returned to form in the 2012, finishing second in the Australian conference, and seventh in the overall standings, narrowly missing the final-six and a place in the quarter finals.

In 2013, the Brumbies and the other Australian super rugby teams played the British &amp; Irish Lions as part of the Lions&#x27; 2013 tour to Australia. The Brumbies earned a hard-fought 14–12 victory, the first defeat of the Lions on their tour.

The Brumbies continued their strong performances in 2013 by finishing first in the Australian conference and 3rd on the ladder to make their first finals appearance since they won the Super title in 2004. After defeating the Cheetahs in a close home final 15 – 13, the Brumbies travelled to Pretoria to face the Bulls and again achieved victory, 23–26. The team had to travel from South Africa to New Zealand to meet the Waikato Chiefs for the championship final the following week, and the Chiefs proved to be too strong, winning the final 27–22.

Following the end of the Super Rugby season the Brumbies sent a squad captained by Robbie Coleman to the invitational World Club 7s in England. The Brumbies won the series, defeating the Auckland Blues 17–14 in the final. Henry Speight was named the player of the tournament.

During the 2017 Super Rugby season, the Brumbies were one of three Australian franchises threatened with contraction when the Australian Rugby Union prevailed upon competition organiser SANZAAR to reduce the number of Australian sides in the competition from five to four after that season. The ARU later announced that the Brumbies would remain in the competition.

==Colours and name==
The Brumbies traditional colours are navy blue, white and gold. Their primary jersey is navy with gold trim, with navy shorts and socks. The alternate jersey is gold and yellow, generally worn for away matches. The Brumbies also have a traditional jersey which is used for games against fellow Australian Super 12 foundation teams NSW and Queensland, which reflects the original home jersey worn between 1996 and 2005. This features a navy &#x27;saddle&#x27; across the shoulders and white below chest level, with gold trim. The primary jersey sponsor is Safeguard Global, who signed a 3-year deal as naming rights sponsor of both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams starting in 2023.

The team is named after the feral horses which inhabit Canberra&#x27;s hinterland. The Brumbies mascot is &quot;Brumby Jack,&quot; with his counterpart &quot;Brumby Jill&quot; joining as a co-mascot in the 2010s. The Brumbies were originally known as the &quot;ACT Brumbies&quot; when they were accepted into the Super 12 for its inaugural season in 1996. Shortly after the 2004 season, two regional governing bodies in New South Wales – &quot;Far South Coast Rugby Union&quot; and &quot;Southern Inland Rugby Union&quot;, joined the ACT Rugby Union, which then renamed itself the ACT and Southern NSW Rugby Union. The team adopted a new name and logo for the 2005 season, dropping the &quot;ACT&quot; to become known simply as &quot;The Brumbies&quot;. The name change identified that the team represented an area much larger than the Australian Capital Territory – with &quot;Brumbies Territory&quot; incorporating a number of regions through southern New South Wales including the Riverina, Shoalhaven, and Southern Highlands as well as the Sunraysia region incorporating parts of Victoria.

==Stadium==

The Brumbies play all their home fixtures at Canberra Stadium, located adjacent to the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra. They share the ground with the Canberra Raiders rugby league team. Also, the Canberra Vikings, the Brumbies&#x27; affiliate in the short-lived Australian Rugby Championship, played one of their four regular-season home matches there. In 2003 matches from the 2003 Rugby World Cup were played at the stadium. Capacity is a nominal all-seated 25,011, however the largest crowd is actually 28,753, which was for the 2004 Super 12 Final. The Brumbies team did not use Canberra Stadium for their post-season APC games, instead taking their home fixtures to Canberra&#x27;s Viking Park, which has a smaller capacity.

==Rivalries==
===New South Wales Waratahs===

The Brumbies have traditionally had a fierce rivalry with the NSW Waratahs. Ascendency in the rivalry is now formally recognised by holding the Dan Vickerman Cup. The Brumbies are currently on a thirteen-game winning streak against the .

In July 1994, before the formation of the Brumbies, the Canberra Kookaburras defeated the 44–28 at Concord Oval in Sydney. The 1994 side was otherwise unbeaten, but had missed an opportunity to compete for the 1994 Super 10 title due to a refusal to tour Apartheid South Africa. As a result, the Brumbies were the only team to beat the 1994 Waratahs.

The original Brumbies team was primarily made of players from the 1994 Kookaburras game, &#x27;rejects&#x27;, and Queenslanders: all groups with reasons to dislike the . Brisbane-born Brumby Troy Coker summed it up with &quot;There was this entitlement thing around NSW rugby that the Canberra boys had a real distaste for.&quot; Ironically, despite being a team of &#x27;rejects&#x27;, the Brumbies have been the most successful Australian team in all competitions in the Super Rugby era.

Traditionally, the ACT-NSW rivalry was dominated by home victories (The only Brumbies away loss in the 2000 Season was against the ), with only two away victories in the Super 12 era, and none in the Super 14 era. The first away win in the rivalry came in the 2002 Semi Final, which the Brumbies won 51–10 at Sydney Football Stadium. The won the first regular season away game in 2005. Dan Vickerman played for the winning team in both victories.

Since 2011, home dominance is no longer as significant: the first clash in the Super 15 era saw the win 29–22 at Canberra Stadium, with the Brumbies getting revenge the following year with a 19–15 victory at the Sydney Football Stadium. Between the round 12 clash in 2015 and the round 17 clash in 2019, the homes team lost six of the seven games.

The got revenge for the 2002 Semi Final in the 2014 Semi Final, which they won 26–8. In the absence of Dave Dennis (their regular captain), the were captained by Michael Hooper, who was named the Brumbies&#x27; best forward only two years earlier.

Brumbies fans took a lot of joy from beating the 40–31 in the final round of 2018, as this prevented the from finishing 2nd on the overall table. Daryl Gibson, head coach of the , exclaimed that his side &quot;was not focused on the job at hand, and getting ahead of itself in terms of already being in next week&quot;. Brumbies fans got additional joy from Gibson&#x27;s post-match press conference, where he (incorrectly) claimed that the result did not affect the playoffs picture.

Since 2016, the Brumbies have dominated the rivalry between the sides, winning in all but one of the last 17 meetings. The Brumbies&#x27; victory over the in the last round of 2018 regular season kicked off their currently unbroken 13 match winning streak against their rivals. Despite the one-sided nature of the rivalry in recent years, the fixture has remained one of the most highly anticipated of the year for both teams.

===Crusaders===
The Brumbies have a historic rivalry with the due to the two teams&#x27; predominance in early Super Rugby history. From 2010 to 2023, the Brumbies lost eleven games in a row against the . In 2024, the Brumbies won their first game against the Crusaders in 15 years.

Between 1997 and 2006, every Grand Final included at least one of the Brumbies or the . The two sides have met in three grand finals: 
*2000, at Bruce Stadium, Canberra, which the won 20–19.
*2002, at Jade Stadium, Christchurch, which the won 31–13.
*2004, at Bruce Stadium, Canberra, which the Brumbies won 47–38.

Former players and pundits likened the intensity of the clashes in the Super 12 and Super 14 era to Test match rugby, saying &quot;It was basically the Wallabies v the All Blacks&quot; and &quot;Every time they met it was just great running rugby&quot;.

In common with the Waratahs rivalry, the away side rarely won in encounters during the Super 12 and Super 14 era. The Brumbies are the only team to have scored 50 points against the (when they beat them in 2001), and have recorded the highest ever score in a grand final against them (47 points in the 2004 final). However, the Brumbies did not win a game against the between 2009 and 2024, taking only two out of a maximum forty-five competition points from games against the in the 2010s. The Brumbies were rarely criticised for their poor record against the Crusaders since 2009. Throughout the Brumbies streak of eleven losses against the , the Brumbies were generally competitive with the , having been within a score in their 2013, 2017, and 2021 fixtures.

Despite a long losing streak, the Brumbies remain one of few sides to have a (relatively) competitive win–loss record against the Crusaders. At the end of the Super 14 era, the Brumbies&#x27; record against the was eight wins in eighteen games (44%). As on 18 May 2024, that record was nine wins in thirty games (30%). At that time, only two other current Super Rugby teams have a higher win rate against the : the (15/46, or 33%), and the (20/51, or 39%).

===Queensland Reds===

The 2020 Super Rugby AU final was contested by the Brumbies and the Reds, with the Brumbies winning 28–23. The Reds only won one game between these teams in the first fifteen years of Super Rugby. The Reds have the only away win in this rivalry since 2015, beating the Brumbies 40–38 in Canberra in a great Australian derby despite trailing 17-0 early in the game. The fierce rivals contested the 2021 Super Rugby AU final later that year. In a rematch of the previous year&#x27;s fixture The Reds prevailed 19–16. The Brumbies led for almost the entire match and spent the final 10 minutes desperately defending their own line before a try by the Reds&#x27; captain James O&#x27;Connor five minutes into injury time handed the Reds victory and avenged the previous year&#x27;s defeat.

The four years that Ewen McKenzie, who played for the Brumbies in Super 12, was coach of the Reds was considered the high water mark of the interstate rivalry. In 2010, 2012, and 2013, the Rod Macqueen Cup games decided whether either the Brumbies or the Reds made the playoff. In 2010, the Rod Macqueen Cup game was the difference between the Reds finishing 4th (in the playoffs) and 5th (not in the playoffs). In 2012 and 2013, if the losing team had won just one of the Rod Macqueen Cup games, they would have won the conference ahead of the other.

==Development teams==

The Australian Capital Territory&#x27;s two elite development squads just below full-time professional level are the Brumbies A and ACT Under 19 teams. These teams are closely aligned with the Brumbies and train at the same venue used by the Super Rugby squad. Many Brumbies players not involved in international rugby play for Canberra&#x27;s team in the National Rugby Championship which also draws from the elite development squads. – &quot;See: Canberra Vikings&quot;

===Brumbies A===
The Brumbies A team plays matches against interstate and international representative teams, and has also competed in tournaments such as the Pacific Rugby Cup. Known by various names including ACT A, ACT XV, Brumbies A, and Brumby Runners, the team is selected from the best emerging rugby talent in the ACT and Southern NSW. The squad is composed of Brumbies contracted players, extended training squad members, ACT Under 19s, and selected Premier Division club players.

===Under 19===
The Brumbies under 19 side plays in the URC competition. ACT teams played in the Southern States Tournament up until 2015 and also played occasional matches against other representative sides such as Pacific Rugby Cup teams. Prior to 2008, state colts teams at under 21 and under 21 age levels were fielded in national competitions. In 2018, an under 19 age limit was reinstated for the colts teams.

==Captains==
As of 10 April 2022, there have been nineteen Brumbies captains. Ten of those captains were club captains, and eleven of those had been game-day only captains.

Ben Mowen captained the side on 51 occasions, more than any other Brumbies captain. He was Captain for every game in his Brumbies career, and only missed two games in that period: against the Lions in 2012, and against the Rebels in 2013.

Only four players under 26 have captained the Brumbies: Owen Finegan, George Gregan, Nic White, and Ryan Lonergan. Nic White became the youngest Captain in Brumbies history when he captained the side against the Rebels on 7 June 2013. He was 22 years and 359 days old at the time.

Only four players over 32 have captained the Brumbies: Owen Finegan, Stephen Moore, Scott Fardy, and Nic White. Stephen Moore became the oldest Captain in Brumbies history when he captained the side against the Reds on 13 February 2015. He was 32 years and 24 days old at the time. With his final game for the Brumbies against the Highlanders on 22 July 2016, he set the current record for oldest Brumbies captain at 33 years and 184 days.

George Gregan is the only Brumbies captain to play every game of his captaincy tenure. Allan Alaalatoa is the only Brumbies captain to miss games of his captaincy tenure due to suspension.

There are more caps as Captain than there are Brumbies games. This is due to the Brumbies adopting the co-Captaincy model between 2016 and 2018.

<doc id="673826" wikidata="Q3562484" url="?curid=673826" title="The White Disease">
<text>The White Plague () is a play written by Czech writer Karel Čapek in 1937. Written at a time of increasing threat from Nazi Germany to Czechoslovakia, it portrays a human response to a tense, prewar situation in an unnamed country that greatly resembles Germany with one extra addition: an uncurable &quot;white disease&quot;, a form of leprosy, is selectively killing off people older than 45. It was adapted as the film &quot;Skeleton on Horseback&quot; by Hugo Haas.

==Plot==

A disease known as &quot;morbus chengi&quot; or the &quot;White Disease&quot; is spreading throughout the world. The disease has symptoms similar to leprosy and strangely only affects those older than forty-five, typically killing its victims within 3-5 months. The pandemic has sent a panic across the country, especially among the older generations; however, the government, led by a dictator known simply as the &quot;Marshal&quot;, is more focused on using the pandemic as an opportunity for war than finding a cure.

Doctor Galén (a reference to the Roman doctor Galen) has discovered a cure for the disease. However, he refuses to reveal his cure until world peace is declared. Until then, he vows only to cure the poor, as he believes that only the rich have the power to realize his wishes. The government, meanwhile, eager to maintain public order and tranquility, is sponsoring a ruse, allegedly a former student of Galén, who sells fake cures to the rich. These consist largely of removing cosmetic symptoms.

The war begins with the army invading a neighboring &quot;small nation&quot;, a thinly veiled reference to Czechoslovakia. Other European nations, including England, declare war in response to aggression. Suddenly, the Marshal falls ill himself and will soon die. He realizes that without his personal military genius the country will inevitably lose the war because he was always reticent about promoting capable commanders. His family asks for Galén&#x27;s help, and the Marshal reluctantly accepts his terms for peace. Galén attempts to reach the Marshal, but is killed at a pro-war youth rally after refusing to join in with their pro-war chant. The aftermath is left ambiguous, and it is uncertain if Europe will be plagued by both the war and the disease, as Galen&#x27;s formula is destroyed in the struggle.

==Reception==
The first Czech performance of &quot;The White Plague&quot; was lauded by the Czech critics Jindřich Vodák, Josef Träger and Václav Černý; on the other hand, the right-wing politician Jiří Stříbrný, as well as the fascist Slovak Hlinka party, strongly criticised the play (the latter group described it as &quot;harmful&quot;). Max Brod predicted the play would be successful abroad, while Thomas Mann sent Čapek a letter praising &quot;The White Disease&quot;. Čapek was later awarded the state prize for drama for the play. The Czech production of &quot;The White Disease&quot; in 1937 was given approving coverage by the British pacifist magazine &quot;Peace News&quot;. The Hebrew version staged by Habima premiered in Tel Aviv on 28 September 1938, one day before the Munich Agreement which led to Germany&#x27;s annexation of the Sudeten territory.

==Translations==
The play was first translated into English by Paul Selver and Ralph Neale in 1938; Capek biographer Ivan Klíma calls the Selver/Neale translation &quot;a seriously flawed adaptation&quot;. Michael Henry Heim translated the play in 1988 for &quot;Crosscurrents: A Yearbook of Central European Culture&quot;. Peter Majer and Cathy Porter translated &quot;The White Disease&quot; for Methuen Drama in 1999.

<text>Milk caps is a children&#x27;s game played with flat circular cardboard milk caps. Players make a stack of these caps, and take turns to drop a heavier &quot;slammer&quot; object onto it, causing the caps to be disrupted.

Each player keeps any face-up caps and is to restack the face-down caps, repeating the process until none land face-down, at which point the player who collected the most caps wins the game of milk caps.

The game is also known as Pogs, under which name it was sold commercially in the 1990s. The name originates from Pog, a brand of juice made from passionfruit, orange, and guava; the use of the juice&#x27;s caps to play the game preceded the game&#x27;s commercialization.

==History==

The game of milk caps possibly originated in Maui, Hawaii, during the 1920s or 1930s, or possibly with origins in Menko, a Japanese card game very similar to milk caps, which has been in existence since the 17th century, during the Edo period. The game of milk caps was played on the Hawaiian island of Maui as early as 1927. There are cap collectors that have caps dating back to the 1940s and 1950s.

After new packaging made cardboard milk caps obsolete in the 1950s, manufacturers such as Haleakala Dairy and Orchards Hawaii occasionally distributed the caps as promotional items. When Haleakala used the caps to successfully promote the 1971 introduction of their fruit drink Pog, it led to a surge in similar promotions and milk cap collecting. In 1991, Haleakala expanded to the more populated Oahu island, which led to a revival of the game. With this revival, the Pog name began being used generically for the game.

The 1990s revival is credited to Blossom Galbiso, a teacher and guidance counselor who taught at Waialua Elementary School in Oahu. In 1991, Galbiso introduced the game she had played as a girl to a new generation of students, incorporating milk caps into her fifth grade curriculum as a way of teaching math and as a non-violent alternative to other popular schoolyard games, such as dodgeball. The game spread from Oahu&#x27;s North Shore, and by early 1992, Stanpac Inc., a Canadian packaging company that had been manufacturing the milk caps distributed by Haleakala Dairy on Maui (the same caps that were collected by Galbiso for her class), was printing millions of milk caps every week for shipment to the Hawaiian island chain. The game spread to the mainland, first surfacing in California, Texas, Oregon, and Washington before spreading to the rest of the country. By 1993, the previously obscure game of milk caps, which had almost been forgotten, was played throughout the world. 

Milk caps returned to popularity when the World Pog Federation and the Canada Games Company reintroduced them under the Pog brand name in the 1990s. The Pog fad soared, and peaked in the mid-1990s. Pogs were being handed out for opening bank accounts and in McDonald&#x27;s Happy Meals. With the end of the Pogs fad, Canada Games went out of business in 1997.

Seven other companies entered the milk cap field after a comic book and card industry convention in January 1993. SkyBox International and Marvel added the product to their lines under the names SkyCaps and Hero Caps respectively. The game had spread to California, Florida and Texas.

The term Pog was claimed as trademark by the World Pog Federation while other companies claimed it was a generic term as it was selected by the children that played the game. In October 1994, a lawsuit was settled between World Pog and Universal Pogs Association. Pog was recognized as World Pog&#x27;s exclusive term and Universal Pogs changed its name to Universal Slammers, Inc.

Because many children would keep the milk caps they won in games from other players, many school districts considered milk caps a form of gambling. Milk caps proved to be major distractions from classes and the source of various playground arguments. These elements eventually led to the banning of milk caps from various schools across North America. Other bannings occurred across Australia and Sweden.

== Equipment ==
Milk caps generally involves two types of playing discs: milk caps and slammers. Milk caps are typically flat circular cardboard discs which are decorated with images on one or both sides. Traditional (or traditional-style) milk caps are made of rougher cardboard, are printed with limited colors, and often have a staple in them (as they appeared when used as actual POG bottlecaps), while modern commercial pogs were stiffer, thicker and are often printed with colorful glossy imagery.

The other equipment that is used is a slammer: a heavier game piece often made of metal, rubber, or more commonly plastic, which come in various thicknesses and weights. They are typically similar in diameter to milk caps. Metal slammers are not allowed in some games because they are usually heavier than other materials, giving the player with the first turn an unfair advantage, and have a tendency to damage the milk caps.

== Gameplay ==

Rules vary among players, but the game variants generally have common gameplay features. Each player has their own collection of milk caps and one or more slammers. Before the game, players decide whether to play &quot;for keeps&quot;, i.e. players get to keep the milk caps that they win during the game and must forfeit those that have been won by other players. The game can then begin as follows:

# The players each contribute an equal number of milk caps to build a stack, which will be used during the game.
# The players take turns throwing their slammer down onto the top of the stack, causing it to spring up and the milk caps to scatter. Each player keeps any milk caps that have flipped over.
# After each throw, the milk caps which have not flipped over are then re-stacked for the next player.
# When no milk caps remain in the stack, the player with the most pogs is the winner.
#Rules can be changed depending on who is playing, and where they are from.

== World POG Federation ==
The World POG Federation was the licensed POG publisher, which was 14% owned by Haleakala Dairy, the trademark holder of POGs. The company was based in Costa Mesa, California.

The Korean survival drama Netflix series &quot;Squid Game&quot; features the Korean variant of the game. It is played during the initial challenge between Gong Yoo&#x27;s salesperson character and the protagonist, Seong Gi-Hun, played by Lee Jung-Jae.

In The Simpsons episode Bart Sells His Soul (Season 7, Episode 4), Milhouse shows Bart his new collection of Alf pogs, saying, &quot;Remember Alf? He&#x27;s back, in Pog form!&quot;

Ezer Weizman was born in Tel Aviv in the British Mandate of Palestine on 15 June 1924 to Yechiel and Yehudit Weizmann. His father was an agronomist. Weizman was a nephew of Israel&#x27;s first president, Chaim Weizmann.

He grew up in Acre and Haifa, and attended the Hebrew Reali School. He married Reuma Schwartz, sister of Ruth Dayan, wife of Moshe Dayan, and they had two children, Shaul and Michal.

Weizman was a combat pilot. He received his training in the British Army in which he enlisted in 1942 during World War II. He served as a truck driver in the Western Desert campaigns in Egypt and Libya. In 1943, he joined the British Royal Air Force (RAF) and attended aviation school in Rhodesia. He served with the RAF in Egypt and then India until 1945. Weizman ended his service in the RAF as a sergeant pilot.

Between 1944 and 1946, he was a member of the Irgun underground in Mandatory Palestine. Between 1946 and 1947, he studied aeronautics in England. During 1947, in the midst of his studies, he became involved in a plot to assassinate General Evelyn Barker, commander of the British forces in Mandatory Palestine at the time. He and another Irgun operative had planned to mine the road outside Barker&#x27;s house in London, but after attracting the suspicions of Scotland Yard, he left England, ending the plot.

==Military career==

After the establishment of the State of Israel, Weizman was a pilot for the Haganah in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. He was the commander of the Negev Air Squadron near Nir-Am. In May 1948, he learned to fly the Avia S-199 (Messerschmitt Bf 109) at the České Budějovice air base in Czechoslovakia (Operation Balak) and participated in Israel&#x27;s first fighter mission (executed by its &quot;first fighter squadron&quot;), a ground attack on an Egyptian column advancing toward Ad Halom near the Arab town of Isdud south of Tel Aviv. In a battle between Israeli and British RAF aircraft on 7 January 1949, he flew one of four Israeli Spitfire fighters that attacked 19 British fighters, which were on a rescue mission in Egypt searching for four aircraft that had been destroyed in an earlier IAF attack. An RAF Hawker Tempest was shot down by the IAF, resulting in the death of the pilot. Due to a failure by ground crewmen, most of the RAF aircraft were not armed.

Weizman joined the Israel Defense Forces and served as the Chief of Operations on the General Staff. In 1951 he attended the RAF Staff College, Andover in England. Upon his return he became commander of Ramat David.

Weizman served as the commander of the Israeli Air Force between 1958 and 1966, and later served as deputy Chief of the General Staff. In 1966, he oversaw the defection of an Iraqi fighter pilot and his MiG fighter which gave Israel vital intelligence information.

In 1967, he directed the early morning surprise air attacks against the Egyptian air bases, which resulted in giving the Israelis total air superiority over the Sinai battlefields by totally destroying the Egyptian Air Force in 3 hours. A total of 400 enemy planes were destroyed by the Israeli Air Force on the first day of the Six-Day War.

Although he became the IDF&#x27;s Deputy Chief of Staff in 1966, he retired from military service in 1969.

==Political career==
Upon retiring from the military, Weizman joined the right-wing Gahal party. He served as Minister of Transportation in Levi Eshkol&#x27;s national unity government until Gahal left the coalition in 1970. Weizman quit Gahal in 1972, but returned in 1976, by which time it had become Likud.

In 1977, he became Defense Minister under Menachem Begin. During his term, Israel developed the IAI Lavi fighter and launched the Litani Operation against the PLO in south Lebanon.

After Donald Neff wrote an article for &quot;Time&quot; magazine reporting an incident at Beit Jala, where a school was surrounded, the doors shut and canisters of gas fired into it, Weizman had a commission investigate Palestinian claims that it was part of an Israeli army campaign against youths in the West Bank which resulted in numerous Palestinians having their arms and legs broken and their heads shaved. When the commission confirmed that the Beit Jala story was true he fired the military governor of the West Bank, Brigadier General David Hagoel, for abusing Palestinians.

Over time, Weizman&#x27;s views became more dovish. After the visit to Jerusalem of Egypt&#x27;s president Anwar Sadat in 1977, Weizman (who spoke Arabic) developed a close friendship with him and the Egyptian negotiators Boutros Boutros-Ghali and Hosni Mubarak. Sadat was quoted as saying: &quot;Weizman is the only Israeli personality I can deal with ... He is my younger brother.&quot; These relations were a crucial factor in the talks that culminated in the 1978 Camp David Accords, followed by a peace treaty with Egypt the following year.

In May 1980, Weizman quit the government. He considered establishing a new party with Moshe Dayan, which led to his ousting from Likud. For the next four years, he put politics on hold and entered the business world.

In 1984, he established a new party, Yahad, which won three seats in the 1984 elections. The party joined a national unity government in which Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Shamir served as prime ministers in rotation. In October 1986, Yahad merged with the Alignment, after Yossi Sarid and the Mapam party left the coalition. Between 1984 and 1990, Weizman was Minister for Arab Affairs and then Minister of Science and Technology. In 1992, the Alignment became the Israeli Labor Party.

==Presidency==
On 24 March 1993, the Knesset elected Weizman, by a majority of 66 to 53 (against Dov Shilansky, the Likud candidate), to serve as the next president of Israel. He assumed office as president on 13 May 1993.

In 1996, in an attempt to promote the peace process, Weizman invited Yasser Arafat for a private visit to his home in Caesarea. In 1999, he met with the DFLP leader Nayef Hawatmeh, declaring &quot;I am even prepared to meet with the devil if it helps [to bring peace].&quot; He openly supported withdrawal from the Golan Heights in exchange for peace with Syria, drawing criticism from the right wing parties.

At the end of 1999, newspapers published allegations that Weizman had accepted large sums of money from businessmen before becoming president, without reporting this to the proper authorities. Since the statute of limitations had expired Weizman was not prosecuted, but the controversy compelled him to resign. Weizman&#x27;s resignation took effect on 13 July 2000.

==Death==

Weizman died of respiratory failure at his home in Caesarea on 24 April 2005, at the age of 80. He is not buried on Mt. Herzl, where Israeli presidents and prime ministers are usually interred, but alongside his son and daughter-in-law in Or Akiva.

<text>The 21 Special Air Service Regiment (Artists) (Reserve), historically known as The Artists Rifles, is a regiment of the British Army Reserve. Its name is abbreviated to 21 SAS(R).

Raised in London in 1859 as a volunteer light infantry unit, the regiment saw active service during the Second Boer War and the First World War, earning a number of battle honours. During the Second World War, it was used as an officer training unit. The regiment was disbanded in 1945, but in 1947 it was re-established to resurrect the Special Air Service Regiment. Together with 23 Special Air Service Regiment (Reserve) (23 SAS(R)), it forms the Special Air Service (Reserve) (SAS(R)) part of the United Kingdom Special Forces (UKSF) directorate.

== History ==
=== Formation and 19th century ===

The regiment was established in 1859, part of the widespread volunteer movement which developed in the face of potential French invasion after Felice Orsini&#x27;s attack on Napoleon III was linked to Britain. The group was organised in London by Edward Sterling, an art student, and comprised various professional painters, musicians, actors, architects and others involved in creative endeavours; a profile it strove to maintain for some years. It was established on 28 February 1860 as the 38th Middlesex (Artists&#x27;) Rifle Volunteer Corps, with headquarters at Burlington House. Its first commanders were the painters Henry Wyndham Phillips and Frederic Leighton. The unit&#x27;s badge, designed by J. W. Wyon, shows the heads of the Roman gods Mars and Minerva in profile. Until 1914 the regimental full dress uniform was light grey with white facings, silver buttons and braid. This distinctive uniform dated from the regiment&#x27;s foundation as a volunteer unit. After the First World War, standard khaki was the normal dress.

In September 1880, the corps became the 20th Middlesex (Artists&#x27;) Rifle Volunteer Corps, with headquarters at Duke&#x27;s Road, off Euston Road, London (now The Place, home of the Contemporary Dance Trust). The drill hall was designed by Robert William Edis, the commanding officer. It was officially opened by the Prince of Wales.

It formed the 7th Volunteer Battalion of the Rifle Brigade from 1881 until 1891 and the 6th Volunteer Battalion from 1892 to 1908. During this period, The Artists&#x27; Rifles fought in the Second Boer War as part of the City Imperial Volunteers.

After the 1860s the voluntary recruitment basis of the regiment gradually broadened to include professions other than artistic ones. By 1893 lawyers and architects made up 24% of the unit, doctors followed with 10% and civil engineers 6%. Sculptors and painters totaled about 5%.

===20th century===

Following the formation of the Territorial Force, the Artists&#x27; Rifles was one of 26 volunteer battalions in the London and Middlesex areas that combined to form the new London Regiment. It became the 28th (County of London) Battalion of The London Regiment on 1 April 1908.

The Artists&#x27; Rifles was a popular unit for volunteers. It had been increased to twelve companies in 1900 and was formed into three sub-battalions in 1914, and recruitment was eventually restricted by recommendation from existing members of the battalion. It particularly attracted recruits from public schools and universities; on this basis, following the outbreak of the First World War, a number of enlisted members of The Artists&#x27; Rifles were selected to be officers in other units of the 7th Division. This exercise was so successful that, early in 1915, selected Artists&#x27; officers and NCOs were transferred to run a separate Officers Training Corps, in which poet Wilfred Owen trained before posting to the Manchester Regiment, the remainder being retained as a fighting unit. Over fifteen thousand men passed through the battalion during the war, more than ten thousand of them becoming officers. The battalion eventually saw battle in France in 1917 and 1918. Casualties suffered by members of this battalion and amongst officers who had trained with The Artists&#x27; Rifles before being posted to other regiments were 2,003 killed, 3,250 wounded, 533 missing and 286 prisoners of war. Ex-Members of the Regiment won eight Victoria Crosses (though none did so while serving with the Regiment), fifty-six DSOs and over a thousand other awards for gallantry.

In the early 1920s, the unit was reconstituted as an infantry regiment within the Territorial Army, as the 28th County of London Regiment. In 1937, this regiment became part of The Prince Consort&#x27;s Own Rifle Brigade.

The regiment was not deployed during the Second World War, functioning again as an Officers Training Corps throughout the war.

=== History as 21 SAS(R) ===

The unit was disbanded in 1945, but reformed in The Rifle Brigade in January 1947 and transferred to The Army Air Corps in July as the 21st Special Air Service Regiment (Artists Rifles). The number 21 SAS was chosen to perpetuate two disbanded wartime regiments, 2 SAS and 1 SAS. The unit was active during the Malayan Emergency and in many subsequent conflicts. In 1952, members of The Artists Rifles who had been involved in special operations in Malaya formed 22 SAS Regiment, the regular special forces regiment – at the time, the only time a Territorial Army unit had been used to form a unit in the Regular Army.

In 1985, David Stirling, founder of the SAS, commented: &quot;There is one often neglected factor which I would like to emphasize - the importance of the two SAS Territorial regiments. At the start of the Second World War, and during its early stages, it was the ideas and initiatives of these amateur soldiers which led to the creation of at least two units within the Special Forces and gave a particular elan to others. When, however, a specialist unit becomes part of the military establishment, it runs the risk of being stereotyped and conventionalized. Luckily the modern SAS looks safe from this danger; it is constantly experimenting with innovative techniques, many of which stem from its Territorial regiments, drawn as they are from every walk of civilian life.&quot;

For much of the Cold War, 21 SAS&#x27;s role was to provide stay-behind parties in the event of a Warsaw Pact invasion of western Europe, forming (alongside 23 SAS) I Corps&#x27; Corps Patrol Unit. In the case of an invasion, this Special Air Service Group would have let themselves be bypassed and stay-behind in order to collect intelligence behind Warsaw Pact lines and conduct target acquisition, and thus try to slow the enemy&#x27;s advance. Peter de la Billière, who later commanded 22 SAS and then became Director Special Forces, served as their adjutant for part of this period. He later wrote: &quot;People began to see that the Territorial SAS were first class and enhanced the reputation of the whole Regiment in a special way of their own.&quot;

In early 2003, a composite squadron of about 60 soldiers of 21 SAS, including soldiers from 23 SAS, were deployed to Afghanistan. There are conflicting accounts on the role of the squadron during this time with Rayment writing in 2003 that it was &quot;long-range reconnaissance&quot; while in 2010 Rayment writes that it was to &quot;establish a communications network across Afghanistan and also acted as liaison teams&quot;. Neville writes that they were &quot;instrumental in early efforts to unite various warlord factions&quot; working with the SIS [Secret Intelligence Service] and that they also provided close protection for SIS officers.

Three 21 SAS soldiers were awarded Military Crosses as a result of fighting in Nad-e Ali in Helmand Province in Afghanistan in 2008. A 21 SAS soldier was awarded a Conspicuous Gallantry Cross at a later date for service in Afghanistan.

On 1 September 2014, 21 and 23 SAS were moved from United Kingdom Special Forces and placed under the command of 1st Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Brigade. The units then left that brigade before the end of 2019. Today, the two reserve regiments, 21 SAS and 23 SAS are back under the operational command of the Director Special Forces, as an integrated part of United Kingdom Special Forces.

<text>Eco-capitalism, also known as environmental capitalism or (sometimes) green capitalism, is the view that capital exists in nature as &quot;natural capital&quot; (ecosystems that have ecological yield) on which all wealth depends. Therefore, governments should use market-based policy-instruments (such as a carbon tax) to resolve environmental problems.

The term &quot;Blue Greens&quot; is often applied to those who espouse eco-capitalism. Eco-capitalism can be thought of as the right-wing equivalent to Red Greens.

Critics of eco-capitalism, such as eco-socialists, view continued economic growth and commodification of nature as an inevitability in capitalism, and thus criticize bright-green environmentalism.

== History ==
The roots of eco-capitalism can be traced back to the late 1960s. The &quot;Tragedy of the Commons&quot;, an essay published in 1968 in &quot;Science&quot; by Garrett Hardin, claimed the inevitability of malthusian catastrophe due to liberal or democratic government&#x27;s policies to leave family size matters to the family, and enabling the welfare state to willingly care for potential human overpopulation. Hardin argued that if families were given freedom of choice in the matter, but were removed from a welfare state, parents choosing to overbear would not have the resources to provide for their &quot;litter&quot;, thus solving the problem of overpopulation. This represents an early argument made from an eco-capitalist standpoint: overpopulation would technically be solved by a free market. John Baden, a collaborator with Garrett Hardin on other works including &quot;Managing the Commons,&quot; founded the Political Economy Research Center (now called the Property and Environment Research Center) in 1982. As one of the first eco-capitalist organizations created, PERC&#x27;s ongoing mission is &quot;improving environmental quality through property rights and markets&quot;. The most popular eco-capitalist idea was emissions trading, or more commonly, cap and trade. Emissions trading, a market-based approach that allows polluting entities to purchase or be allocated permits, began being researched in the late 1960s. International emissions trading was significantly popularized in the 1990s when the United Nations adopted the Kyoto Protocol in 1997.

==Eco-capitalist theorists==
*Terry L. Anderson, a graduate of the University of Montana who received his Ph.D. from Washington University, and who serves as the co-chair of the Hoover Institution&#x27;s Property Rights, Freedom and Prosperity task force, has advocated that free markets can be both economically beneficial and environmentally protective. Anderson specializes in how markets impact Native American communities and their economies. Anderson is a co-author of &quot;Free Market Environmentalism,&quot; a book that explores how free market ideas could be used to solve environmental issues, based on Anderson&#x27;s conclusion on a few case studies. 
*Bruce Yandle, a graduate of Mercer University, attended Georgia State University where he earned an MBA and PhD. Yandle is the dean emeritus of Clemson University&#x27;s college of business. He is prominent in the field of eco-capitalism for his story of the &quot;Bootlegger and the Baptist&quot;. Yandle&#x27;s theory of the Bootlegger and the Baptist posits that ethical groups, religious institutions and business captains can align their organizations in the interest of regulation and economic growth.
*Paul Hawken is the architect of the United States first natural foods company, Erewhon Trading Company, where all products were organically composed. Hawken founded the research organization, Natural Capital Institute, and developed Wiser Earth, a program focused on providing a platform for all to communicate about the environment. Hawken has authored hundreds of publications, including four best selling books. In his writings, Hawken stresses that many viable ecological options exist for businesses that will benefit the environment, while simultaneously bringing about economic profit. One idea discussed in his book, &quot;Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution&quot;, is the possibility of developing lightweight, electricity-powered cars as an alternative to current transportation modes. Hawken attributes the hesitancy of adopting these options to lack of knowledge of these alternatives and high initial costs. Hawken is now the head of OneSun, Inc., an energy corporation concentrated on low-cost solar.
*Lester Brown began his career as a tomato farmer in New Jersey, before earning a degree at Rutgers University and traveling to a rural India for a six-month study of the country&#x27;s food and population crisis. Brown has primarily focused on finding alternatives which he contends would provide solutions to the world&#x27;s population and resources problem. With financial support from Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Brown created the Worldwatch Institute, the first dedicated to researching global environmental problems. In 2001, Brown founded the Earth Policy Institute, an organization that outlines a vision for creating an environmentally sustainable economy. Brown has authored over 50 books and received 25 honorary degrees. In his publications, Brown posits that the key to an eco-friendly economy is an honest market. He advocates for replacing harmful aspects of the environment, like fossil fuels, with renewable energy. In June 2015, Brown retired from Earth Policy and closed the institute.

==Transition to eco-capitalism==
The ideology of eco-capitalism was adopted to satisfy two competing needs:
#the desire for generating profit by businesses in a capitalist society and
#the urgency for proper actions to address a struggling environment negatively impacted by human activity.
Under the doctrine of eco-capitalism, businesses commodify the act of addressing environmental issues.

The following are common principles in the transition to eco-capitalism.

=== Externalities: Correcting of a free market failure ===

A central part of eco-capitalism is to correct for the market failure seen in the externalization of pollution. By treating the issue of pollution as an externality it has allowed the market to minimize the degree of accountability. To correct for this market failure eco-capitalism would have to internalize this cost. A prime example of this shift towards internalizing externalities is seen in the adoption of a system for carbon trading. In a system like this people are forced to factor the pollution cost into their expenses. This system as well as other systems of internalization function on large and small scales (oftentimes both are tightly connected). On a corporate scale, the government can regulate carbon emissions and other polluting factors in business practices forcing companies to either reduce their pollution levels, externalize these costs onto their consumers by raising the cost of their goods/services, and/or a combination of the two. These kinds of systems can also be effective in indirectly creating a more environmentally conscious consumer base. As the companies who are creating the most pollution face falling profit levels and rising prices their consumers and investors are inclined to take their business elsewhere. This migration of investment and revenue would then be expected to make its way to business who have already incorporated the minimization of pollution into their business model thus allowing them to provide lower prices and higher profit margins attracting the migrating consumers and investors.

===Green consumption===

At the conception of the ideology, major theorists of eco-capitalism, Paul Hawken, Lester Brown, and Francis Cairncross, saw an opportunity to establish a different approach to environmentalism in a capitalist society. These theorists posited that consumers as well as producers could shoulder the social responsibility of environmental restoration if &quot;green technology, green taxes, green labeling, and eco-conscious shopping&quot; existed. The resulting &quot;shopping our way to sustainability&quot; mentality encouraged the development of organic farming, renewable energy, green certifications as well as other eco-friendly practices.

A 2015 report from the Nielsen Corporation lends credence to this theory. According to the report, consumers have more brand loyalty and are willing to pay higher prices for a product that is perceived as being sustainable. This is especially true among Millennials and Generation Z. These generations currently make up 48% of the global marketplace and still have not hit their peak spending levels. As these generations&#x27; preferences continue to shape how businesses operate and market themselves, they could drive a continued shift toward green consumption.

According to the Annual Review of Environmental Resources, &quot;the focus of policy makers, businesses, and researchers has mostly been on the latter (consuming differently), with relatively little attention paid to consuming less&quot;. A review of how to encourage sustainable consumption from the University of Surrey shows that, &quot;Government policies send important signals to consumers about institutional goals and national priorities.&quot; Governments can pull a variety of levers to signal this including product, trading, building, media, and marketing standards.

===Carbon trading===

Creating perhaps the first major eco-capitalist endorsement, many political and economic institutions support a system of pollution credits. Such a system, which assigns property rights to emissions, is considered to be the most &quot;efficient and effective&quot; way for regulating greenhouse gas emissions in the current neoliberal global economy. Especially in the case of tradable pollution credits, the resulting market-based system of emissions regulation is believed to motivate businesses to invest in technology that reduce greenhouse gas emissions using positive reinforcement (i.e. ability to trade unused credits) and punishment (i.e. the need to buy more credits).

===Full cost accounting===
Environmental full-cost accounting explains corporate actions on the basis of the triple bottom line, which is best summarized as &quot;people, planet, and profit&quot;. As a concept of corporate social responsibility, full cost accounting not only considers social and economic costs and benefits but also the environmental implications of specific corporate actions.

While there has been progress in measuring the cost of harm to the health of individuals and the environment, the interaction of environmental, social, and health effects makes measurement difficult. Measurement attempts can be broadly categorized as either behavioral in nature, like hedonic pricing, or dose-response which looks at indirect effects. A standardized measurement of these costs has yet to emerge. This should not be confused with the full-cost method used by organizations searching for oil and gas that &quot;does not differentiate between operating expenses associated with successful and unsuccessful exploration projects&quot;.

===Genuine progress indicator===
The current standard of using the gross domestic product (GDP) as an indicator of welfare is criticized for being inaccurate. An alternative to GDP, the genuine progress indicator compensates for the shortcomings of the GDP as a welfare indicator by accounting for environmental harms as well as other factors that affect consumption, such as crime and income inequality.

==Criticism and responses==
A fundamental criticism of the eco-capitalist idea rests on the idea that the commodification of nature and environmental services plus the principles of growth economics and sustainability cannot (easily) coexist.

A majority of the criticisms from traditionally unregulated capitalism is due to eco-capitalism&#x27;s increased regulation. Pollution credits (as a means for regulating greenhouse gas emissions) is traditionally at odds with economically laissez-faire ideologies. Elements of unregulated capitalism prefer environmental issues to be addressed by individuals who may allocate their own income and wealth, oppose the commodification of by-products like carbon emissions, and emphasize positive incentives to maintain resources through free-market competition and entrepreneurship.

Proponents of eco-capitalism view environmental reform like pollution credits as a more transformative and progressive system. According to these proponents, since free market capitalism as inherently expansionist in tendency, ignoring environmental responsibility is a danger to the environment. Approximately 36% of Americans are deeply concerned about climate issues. Proponents of eco-capitalism typically favor political environmentalism, which emphasizes negative incentives like regulation and taxes to encourage the conservation of resources and prevent environmental harm.

Political theorist Antonio Gramsci cites theories of common sense, which suggests that, in general, free market capitalism absent of environmental reform, is ingrained in the minds of its members as the only viable and successful form of economic organization through cultural hegemony. Therefore, the proposal of any alternate economic system, like eco-capitalism, must overcome the predominant common sense and economic status quo in order to develop opposing theories. Nonetheless, movements in the United States and abroad have continued to push for reforms to protect the environment in current capitalistic systems.

Another political theorist, Daniel Tanuro, explains in his book &quot;Green Capitalism: Why it Can&#x27;t Work&quot; that for green capitalism to be successful, it would have to replace current mainstream capitalism with eco-socialist methods, while defying corporate interests:If by &quot;green capitalism&quot; we understand a system in which the qualitative, social and ecological parameters are taken in account by the numerous competing capitals, that is to say even within economic activity as an endogenous mechanism, then we are completely deluded. In fact, we would be talking about a form of capitalism in which the law of value was no longer in operation, which is a contradiction in termsHowever, Tanuro adds that social and economical change to the current capitalist systems is necessary, because technology will invariably increase emissions as manufacturing processes and distribution systems progress. Tanuro argues for changes in three areas: 
# Use of transportation methods
# Agriculture and dietary changes
# Overall consumer lifestyle and market spending
Despite this argument, critics still claim that green consumption, sustainable behavior on the part of the consumer, is not enough to be instituted as a socio-environmental solution. In accordance with hegemony, capitalism agrees that the government has little control over market and buyers, sellers, and consumers ultimately drive the market. In contrast, in green capitalism, the government would have more control therefore; consumers do not have direct power over the market, and should not be held accountable.

Environmental scholar Bill McKibben proposes &quot;full scale climate mobilization&quot; to address environmental decay. During World War II, vehicle manufacturers and general goods manufacturers shifted to producing weapons, military vehicles and war time goods. McKibben argues that, to combat environmental change, the American Military Industrial Complex and other national arms producers could shift to producing solar panels, wind turbines and other environmental products in an eco-capitalist system.

== Appeal of renewable energy in the capitalist market ==
Tom Randall, a correspondent specializing in renewable energy for Bloomberg, calls to attention that wind and solar energy are &quot;outperforming&quot; fossil fuels. In terms of investments, clean energy outperforms both gas and coal by a 2-1 margin. This positive margin may be attributed to the consistently falling price of renewable energy production. Renewable energy sources hold assertive advantages over fossil fuels because they exist as technologies, not fuels. As time proceeds, renewable energy becomes inevitably more efficient as technology adapts. Technologies for extracting fuels may change, but the fuels remain as constants. Both the solar and wind industries have proven growth over time: Over the last 15 years, the solar industry has doubled seven times and the wind industry has doubled four times. In contrast, the fossil fuel industry has declined over the last 15 years. America&#x27;s coal industry has lost 75 percent of its value within the past few years.

Renewable energy sources also gain advantages over the fossil fuel industry through international governmental support. Globally, governments implement subsidies to boost the renewable energy industry. Concurrently, various global efforts fight against fossil fuel production and use. The demand for renewable energy sources has skyrocketed in the last 15 years, while fossil fuels have drastically fallen in demand (in capitalist societies).

The worldwide concern of climate change (also known as global warming) is notably the largest contributor to the green energy industry&#x27;s rapid acceleration, just as it is largely responsible for the decline of the fossil fuel industry. The overwhelming scientific consensus of climate change&#x27;s reality and its potential catastrophic effects have caused a large part of the world&#x27;s population to respond with panic and immediate action. While the world&#x27;s response has been strong, environmentalists and climate scientists do not believe the response has been strong enough to counter climate change&#x27;s effects, and that the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources is moving far too slowly.

The global efforts and concerns of both governments and individuals to take action regarding implementing and transforming a society&#x27;s energy sources from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources show the enormous potential of the green energy market. This potential is seen in the countless renewable energy projects under way. Currently, there are over 4,000 major solar projects being implemented. These, and all renewable energy projects, set goals of long-term economic benefit.

The Global Apollo Programme, set up by both economists and scientists, has a goal of creating a solar capability that can stand as a cheaper alternative to coal-fueled power plants by 2025. In capitalist markets, solar energy has the very real potential of becoming a direct competitor to coal plants in less than a decade.

=== Barriers to transition ===
One of the most daunting barriers to the transition to an eco-capitalist system is the systemic barrier that can be created by former models. Dimitri Zenghelis explores the idea of path dependence and the how continuing to build infrastructure without foresight seriously impedes the implementation and benefits of future innovations. Zenghelis uses the term &quot;locked-in&quot; to describe situations where the full implementation of a new innovation cannot be seen because an earlier infrastructure prevents it from functioning well. This barrier is exemplified in older cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York where the infrastructure was designed around urban sprawl to accommodate private vehicles. The sprawl has been researched with the results returning that the moving forward mega-cities need to be constructed as eco-cities if the hope of curving emission levels down is going to have any hope.

<doc id="673861" wikidata="Q1195503" url="?curid=673861" title="Daoyin">
<text>Daoyin is a series of cognitive body and mind unity exercises practiced as a form of Daoist &quot;neigong&quot;, meditation and mindfulness to cultivate &quot;jing&quot; (essence) and direct and refine &quot;qi&quot;, the internal energy of the body according to traditional Chinese medicine. These exercises are often divided into yin positions (lying and sitting) and yang positions (standing and moving). The practice of &quot;daoyin&quot; was a precursor of qigong, and blended with the introduction of Indian yoga into China with the spread of Buddhism and was practised in Chinese Taoist monasteries for health and spiritual cultivation. &quot;Daoyin&quot; is also said to be a primary formative ingredient in the yin aspects of Chinese martial arts including the well-known &quot;soft styles&quot; of the Chinese martial arts, of tai chi, and middle road styles like &quot;Wuxingheqidao&quot;.

The main goal of &quot;daoyin&quot; is to create flexibility of the mind, thereby creating harmony between internal and external environments, which relaxes, replenishes and rejuvenates the body, developing in its practitioners a vital and healthy spirit.

==The &quot;Daoyin Tu&quot;==
A painted scroll on display at the Hunan Provincial Museum and known as the &quot;Daoyin Tu&quot; found in tomb three at Mawangdui in 1973 and dated to 168 BC shows coloured drawings of 44 figures in standing and sitting postures performing daoyin exercises. It is the earliest known physical exercise chart in the world, and illustrates a medical system which does not rely on external factors such as medication, surgery or treatments, but utilizes solely internal factors to prevent disease.

The images include men and women, young and old. Their postures and movements differ from one another. Some are sitting, some are standing, and still others are practicing &quot;Daoyintu&quot; or exercising using apparatuses.

Translation of the texts covering the document show that the early Chinese were aware of the need for both preventive and corrective breathing exercises.
The exercises can be divided into three categories:
# Postures of bodily exercises such as stretching arms and legs, leaning over, hopping, dancing, breathing exercises and using various equipment such as a stick and a ball.
# Imitating animal behaviour such as dragon, monkey, bear and crane.
# Exercises targeted at specific diseases.

==Effects==
A typical &quot;daoyin&quot; exercise will involve movement of the arms and body in time with controlled inhalation and exhalation. Each exercise is designed with a different goal in mind, for example calmative effects or expanded lung capacity.

According to Mantak Chia the practice of &quot;daoyin&quot; has the following effects: harmonization of the &quot;qi&quot;, relaxation of the abdominal muscles and the diaphragm, training of the &quot;second brain&quot; in the lower abdomen, improvement of health and structural alignment.

The spiritual aspects of Wuxingheqidao, Daoyin practice are outlined by Chinese Buddhist&#x27;s and medical practitioner Xieen as a way to unify the three centres or the mind allowing the body to relax becoming internally emotionally and spiritually stronger and outwardly softer and more flexible towards changes in the environment and everyday life.

<text>TeamTNT was a distributed group of &quot;Doom&quot; mappers, originally formed as a &quot;Doom&quot; mailing list in 1994. The team are known for creating the &quot;TNT: Evilution&quot; episode of &quot;Final Doom&quot;, as well as several free level packs and developer resources for &quot;Doom II&quot;. Their source ports, the BOOM and Boom-DM engines were used by many level designers during the height of Doom modding in the 1990s. The group was largely inactive from 2008, with their resources remaining online until the 2015 death of administrator Ty Halderman.

==History==
===Origins &amp; &quot;Final Doom&quot;===
TeamTNT developed in late 1994 and early 1995 from the highly active doom-editing mailing list. TeamTNT originally formed as a two-group entity: the Alpha group whose concerns centered primarily on level design and mod work employing pre-existing &quot;Doom II&quot; resources as developed by the original Id Software team, and the Beta group who would be focused more closely on partial and total conversions including sprite changes. The Beta team dissolved shortly after the official formation of The TeamTNT Trust, the legal entity which dealt with Id Software during negotiations concerning &quot;Final Doom&quot;. As of February 1995 team membership numbered at 104 members (including all former members of the doom-editing mailing list).

===Decline===
During the late 1990s membership declined and fluctuated such that as of 1999, membership ranged from 35–40 members with as many as an additional 40 former and inactive members still listed on official member lists. Paul Fleschute broke his &quot;Ultimate Invasion&quot; project away from TeamTNT, though this project never emerged. A number of TeamTNT members were also involved with the &quot;LUC&quot; project (a game then being developed by Suspension Software based on the Quake II engine). The &quot;LUC&quot; website went down at some point in the late 2000s without release. Most of TNT&#x27;s ongoing projects were cancelled in 2007, and the last level pack released by the group was &quot;Eternal Doom IV&quot; in 2008. TNT website administrator Ty Halderman continued to maintain the /idgames archives until his death from brain cancer on July 31, 2015.

==Releases==
All of these were released for free, save for &quot;Final Doom&quot;- though it would ultimately be packaged as a free update to console owners of &quot;Doom II&quot; in 2019. Several of these were in co-operation with other developers or groups.
*Mar. 1996: &quot;Icarus: Alien Vanguard&quot; (32-level solo-play level pack initially entitled &quot;TNT2&quot;)

<text>A Grand Don&#x27;t Come for Free is the second studio album by English rapper and producer Mike Skinner, under the music project the Streets. It was released on 17 May 2004 and is listed in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. It is a rap opera and concept album that follows the story of its protagonist&#x27;s relationship with a girl named Simone, alongside the mysterious loss of £1,000 from his home (the eponymous &quot;grand&quot;).

==Plot==
In the story, the protagonist loses £1,000, or a &quot;grand&quot; in slang terms, and strives to recoup the money.

In his book &quot;The Story of the Streets&quot;, Skinner explained his decision to create a story that ran through the album:

In the first track on the album, &quot;It Was Supposed to Be So Easy&quot;, Skinner attempts several tasks during a day but they do not go according to plan. When he comes home he cannot find the £1,000 he has saved and his television is broken. In the process of trying to recover the money he:

*Starts seeing a girl called Simone who works in JD Sports with his friend Dan. (&quot;Could Well Be In&quot;)
*Tries to recover the £1,000 by gambling on football. After a series of wins, he frustratingly cannot get to the bookmakers in time to make a big gamble. Fortuitously, the prediction is wrong — it is his lucky day. (&quot;Not Addicted&quot;)
*Is stood up at a nightclub by Simone, but passes the time drinking alcohol and taking ecstasy. He thinks he sees Simone kissing Dan but the drug-induced high distracts him before he can think about it properly. (&quot;Blinded By the Lights&quot;)
*Moves into Simone&#x27;s house and finds himself comfortable smoking marijuana there, rather than drinking with his friends at the pub. (&quot;Wouldn&#x27;t Have It Any Other Way&quot;)
*Argues with Simone and gets kicked out of her house. (&quot;Get Out of My House&quot;)
*Poses to impress a girl in a take away restaurant during a heavy night drinking on holiday. (&quot;Fit But You Know It&quot;)
* Flies back from the holiday and remorsefully reviews the events of the previous night during a phone call to a friend, realising he still wants to be with Simone. (&quot;Such a Twat&quot;)
*Suspects his mate Scott of stealing his coat, money, and girlfriend but discovers that Simone is actually having an affair with Dan. (&quot;What is He Thinking?&quot;)
*Tries to cope with his girlfriend breaking up with him. (&quot;Dry Your Eyes&quot;)
*Deals with the events of his life in one of two ways; the final track, &quot;Empty Cans&quot;, features two endings to the plot, a bitter ending and a happy ending (the former where he and a TV repairman get into a fight over the repairman&#x27;s fee, and the latter in which he reconciles with his mates and finds the £1,000 had fallen down the back of the TV, making it malfunction).
*The B-side of the UK single release of &quot;Fit But You Know It&quot; is the song &quot;Soaked by the Ale&quot;. The story of this song takes place between the events of &quot;Fit But You Know It&quot; and &quot;Such a Twat&quot;. It documents one of Skinner&#x27;s mates being annoyed at Mike for stealing a tub of ice cream whilst on holiday in Spain as a result of his excessive drinking. The chronological order is identified in &quot;Such a Twat&quot; where Skinner raps &quot;And that incident with the ice cream I forgot, it all ended in our vodka&quot;.

Like the Streets&#x27; debut album &quot;Original Pirate Material&quot; the album was recorded in a flat in south London, but this time in Skinner&#x27;s own flat in Stockwell which he had bought using the money he had received upon signing his publishing deal.

==Artwork==
The front cover of the album features Skinner posing in a bus shelter at night, taken by British photographer Ewen Spencer.

==Singles==
The first single from the album, &quot;Fit But You Know It&quot; reached number four on the UK Singles Charts with the second single, &quot;Dry Your Eyes&quot; entering the UK Charts at number one. The album itself reached number one in the UK Album Charts, number eleven in Australia and number eighty-two in the United States. 
*&quot;Fit But You Know It&quot; Released: 3 May 2004 No. 4 UK
*&quot;Dry Your Eyes&quot; Released: 26 July 2004 No. 1 UK
*&quot;Blinded by the Lights&quot; Released: 4 October 2004 No. 10 UK
*&quot;Could Well Be In&quot; Released: 6 December 2004 No. 30 UK

==Critical reception==
Critical response for the album, like for his previous album, was near universally positive. It currently scores 91/100 on Metacritic, slightly higher than his previous album, which scored 90/100.

Critics noted the difference in style compared to Skinner&#x27;s debut album. In &quot;Q&quot;, Garry Mulholland said that instead of thinking of the record as a concept album, it was more like &quot;a spoken-word opera, or a short story with an exquisitely crafted pop soundtrack&quot;. Calling it &quot;the best album of 2004 so far, and by some distance&quot;, Mulholland concluded that &quot;if [Skinner] sees a darkness in the private hell of the everyday, it&#x27;s an inspiring one&quot;, and that the album &quot;puts forth a musical argument that our own lives are more important and relevant than the aspirational celebrity imagery that dominates 21st century pop.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; said that the album &quot;raises the stakes to such an extent that it sounds literally unprecedented: there isn&#x27;t really any other album like this&quot;, and &quot;PopMatters&quot; stated that Skinner &quot;is now in a class all his own; nobody else is making music like this.&quot; &quot;Trouser Press&quot; said that &quot;Skinner seems both edgier and more contemplative&quot;.

Pat Blashill of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called &quot;A Grand Don&#x27;t Come for Free&quot; &quot;the best British hip-hop concept album ever&quot; and stated that &quot;it is both simpler – in sound and scope – than &quot;Pirate&quot; and more ambitious&quot;. He was impressed by Skinner&#x27;s ability with &quot;tickling and tearing vowels, adverbs and lexicons&quot;, but, above all, &quot;his real gift is literary&quot;. He concluded that the story was &quot;thoroughly mundane ... yet Skinner&#x27;s ear for language and detail keeps it vivid, and hilarious&quot;. &quot;In a previous decade, &quot;A Grand Don&#x27;t Come for Free&quot; would have been a rock opera, and it would have taken itself very seriously,&quot; observed &quot;Blender&quot;. &quot;But Skinner isn&#x27;t interested in pinball wizards or ancient alien races ... [It] demands the same attention as a movie, and that&#x27;s why some people will hate it while others will find it uniquely riveting.&quot; &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; named the album &quot;the first hip-hop classic of the new millennium.&quot;

Online music magazine &quot;Pitchfork&quot; placed &quot;A Grand Don&#x27;t Come for Free&quot; at number 129 on their list of top 200 albums of the 2000s. Music magazine &quot;NME&quot; placed the album at number 16 on their list of &quot;top 50 albums of the noughties&quot;.

<text>The São Paulo Metro (, ), commonly called the Metrô, is one of the rapid transit companies serving the city of São Paulo, alongside the São Paulo Metropolitan Trains Company (CPTM), Via Quatro and Via Mobilidade, all four forming the largest metropolitan rail transport network of Latin America. The six lines in the metro system operate on of route, serving 91 stations. The metro system carries about 4,200,000 passengers a day.

Metro itself is far from covering the entire urban area in the city of São Paulo and only runs within the city limits. However, it is complemented by a network of metropolitan trains operated by CPTM and ViaMobilidade, which serve the city of São Paulo and the São Paulo Metropolitan Region. The systems combined form a long network, all accessible via one single ticket. The metropolitan trains differs from Metro because it also serves other municipalities around São Paulo with larger average distance between stations and freight trains operating in some lines.

Considered the most modern in Latin America, the system is the first to install platform screen doors at a station, and use communications-based train control with lines 4 and 15 being fully automated. Line 15 is a monorail line that partially opened for service in 2014 and is the first high capacity monorail line of Latin America. The São Paulo Metro and CPTM both operate as State-owned companies and have received awards in the recent past as one of the cleanest systems in the world by ISO 9001. The São Paulo Metro was voted Best Metro Americas at the MetroRail 2010 industry conference and has been frequently chosen as one of the best metro systems in the world by specialist media outlets such as CNN and Business Insider, being the only system in Latin America to make the list.

==History==
The Companhia do Metropolitano de São Paulo (Metrô) was founded on April 24, 1968. Eight months later, work on the initial North–South line (now Line 1 - Blue) was initiated. In 1972, the first test train trip occurred between Jabaquara and Saúde stations. On September 14, 1974, the segment between Jabaquara and Vila Mariana entered into commercial operation.

The first line, Norte/Sul (North/South), later renamed &quot;Blue Line&quot; or Line 1 - Blue, was opened on September 18, 1972, with an experimental operation between Saúde and Jabaquara stations. Commercial operations started on September 14, 1974, after an eight-year &quot;gestation&quot; period that began in 1966, under Mayor Faria Lima&#x27;s administration. Expansion of the metro system includes new lines. As of late 2004, construction began on a US$1 billion, all-underground line (Line 4 - Yellow), with eleven stations, aimed at transporting almost one million people per day. By 2004, Line 2 was also being expanded, with two new stations open in 2006 and another one in 2007.

A expansion of Line 5 was completed in 2018.

, tickets cost R$5.20. In 2006, the São Paulo Metro system has started to use a smart card, called &quot;Bilhete Único&quot; (or &quot;Single Ticket&quot; in English).

==Current operational data==


The metro system consists of six color-coded lines: Line 1 (Blue), Line 2 (Green), Line 3 (Red), Line 4 (Yellow), Line 5 (Lilac) and Line 15 (Silver), operating from Sunday to Saturday, from 4:40 AM to midnight. Line 15 (Silver), is a high-capacity monorail, the rest being standard metro lines.

The six lines achieved an average weekday ridership of 5.3 million in 2019. On 14 September 2019, Metrô recorded the highest ever ridership figure of 5.5 million on a single business day, caused by the recent expansion of some lines. The Metro provided 1.49 billion rides over the course of 2019.

==Bus terminals==
In May 1977, Metro assumed the administration and commercial utilization of the Inter-City Jabaquara Intermunicipal Terminal, and inaugurated, in May 1982, the modern Inter-city Tietê Bus Terminal, replacing the former Júlio Prestes Terminal.

This agreement established that Metro would be in charge of the studies for the planning, implementation, and operation of passenger transportation in the municipal district of São Paulo, either directly or through third parties.

Later, the other inter-city bus terminals were integrated into the system, such as Bresser, in January 1988, and Palmeiras-Barra Funda, in December 1989. In January 1990 the inter-city bus terminals were outsourced by Metrô, which through public bidding, contracted Consortium Prima for the administration and commercial utilization of the 4 inter-city bus terminals of the city of São Paulo. This contract included the responsibility for maintenance and conservation of the existing installations, as well as of the expansion and modernisation of the terminals.

==Rolling stock==

The first cars started operating in 1974, the same year the company&#x27;s commercial activities were initiated. This model was named A Stock, whose cars received the numbers of 1001 to 1306 (51 trains of 6 cars each). They were designed in United States by the Budd Company, and the national rolling stock manufacturer Mafersa did the final assembly. The model was based on the Class A trains from the Bay Area Rapid Transit system, even using the same Westinghouse 1460 series chopper traction controls, and was to be used along the north–south line, now known as Line 1 - Blue. The initially they operated with two car trains with cars added as demand increased, up to a maximum of six cars. All of them have a pair of electric motors and a cab.
Today, this stock is known as &quot;A stock&quot;. The entire &quot;A stock&quot; was planned to be phased out by the beginning of 2015, as the recent modernization processes saw them being converted into two different stocks: I and J. The last A stock train was withdrawn from service in February 2018.

To reduce the manufacturing costs, the Cobrasma company decided to provide, for the East-West Line, now Line 3. Trains had cabs only and made use of more advanced ventilation and maintenance systems. This stock was known by the name of &quot;C&quot;. The batch of trains designed for this line were produced by two different national companies, Cobrasma and Mafersa (whose trains got named as &quot;D&quot;). The trains entered service between 1984 and 1986 on Line 3 and remained there for their entire service lives, although in their final years, some of the D stock trains were transferred to Line 1 where they ran with the older A stock trains.
The only difference between the two is the front mask and some structural framework. Their original technical nomenclature was 300. According to it, the C stock was numbered from 301 (C01) to 325 (C25), and the D stock had trains numbered from 326 (D26) to 347 (D47). The C stock trains were already refurbished as K stock and the D stock was refurbished and created the L cars. The refurbishment program for the entire stock of A, C and D trains was completed in 2018.

Today the rolling stock of the São Paulo Metro consists of 11 stocks, 232 trains and 1,419 cars and it is divided as follows:

*E stock: Built by Alstom and entered service between 1998 and 1999. They currently operate on Line 1 - Blue.
*F stock: Alstom trains specially built for Line 5 - Lilac between 2001 and 2002.
*G stock: Also built by Alstom and entered service in 2008. They currently run on Lines 1 - Blue and 3 - Red.
*H stock: Streamlined CAF-built trains built in 2010 which operate exclusively on Line 3 - Red since 2014.
*I and J stock: Refurbished A stock trains which operate on Lines 1 - Blue and 2 - Green from 2011. They differ cosmetically as well as mechanically. I stock was rebuilt by Alstom and Siemens while J stock was rebuilt by Bombardier, Temoinsa, BTT and Tejofran.
*K stock: Refurbished C stock trains rebuilt by a consortium consisting of T’trans, MTTrens, MPE and Temoinsa. They operate on Line 3 - Red just like the original trains.
*L stock: D stock refurbished by Alstom and IESA and operates on Line 1 - Blue
*M stock: The Monorail stock built by Bombardier between 2013 and 2016 and operates on Line 15 - Silver.
*P stock: CAF-built trains from 2013 which run on Line 5 - Lilac alongside the former F stock.
*400 series: Driverless trains built in 2009-2010 and 2016-2017 by Hyundai Rotem for Line 4 - Yellow

==Security==
Metro&#x27;s security agents have police powers and in case of need they will provide assistance. All police matters that occur within the system are directed to the police station of the subway system, Delegacia de Polícia do Metropolitano de São Paulo (DELPOM), located at Palmeiras-Barra Funda station.

<doc id="673882" wikidata="Q5500255" url="?curid=673882" title="Free look">
<text>Free look (also known as mouselook) describes the ability to move a mouse, joystick, analogue stick, or D-pad to rotate the player character&#x27;s view in video games. It is almost always used for 3D game engines, and has been included on role-playing video games, real-time strategy games, third-person shooters, first-person shooters, racing games, and flight simulators. Free look is nearly universal in modern games, but it was one of the significant technical breakthroughs of mid-1990s first-person perspective games. Many modern console games dedicate one of the several analogue sticks on the gamepad entirely to rotating the view, where as some older console games, when gamepads usually had fewer or only a single D-pad or analogue stick, had a feature where the single D-pad or analogue stick would move the view instead of the character whilst the player held down another button at the same time, often labelled in game as the &quot;look button&quot;.

In games whose free-look systems are controlled fluidly via a pointing device, such as a mouse or the Wii Remote&#x27;s infrared pointer, the camera will change angle when the cursor moves near an edge of the screen. To lock the camera angle, the player can position the cursor in a central region of the screen called a &quot;dead zone&quot;, named so in that it prevents the camera from moving. This allows the player to keep a steady focus on what lies forward, and the extent and size of the dead zone may be customizable in certain games. 

==History==
Fully 3D first-person games with restricted free look had appeared as early as 1992 on the PC, allowing the player to look up and down, although vision was controlled by dedicated keys rather than the mouse. At the time it was still cutting-edge technology and didn&#x27;t become widespread until the age of 3D accelerators. &quot;Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss&quot;, released in March 1992, as well as the later &quot;System Shock&quot; (which was made on the same engine), allowed the player to manipulate the camera, looking left, right, up or down by using dedicated keys or by using the mouse to click on the edges of the screen.

Taito&#x27;s first-person shooter arcade game &quot;Gun Buster&quot;, released in August 1992, featured a unique control scheme where the player moves using an eight-direction joystick and takes aim using a mounted positional light gun. The player could turn left or right by moving the gun pointer to the left or right edges of the screen. However, the game lacked the ability to look up or down.

In the 1993 game &quot;Doom&quot;, it was not possible for the player to angle the view up or down, though Raven Software&#x27;s &quot;Heretic&quot;, based on the same engine as &quot;Doom&quot; and released in 1994, added a restricted free look to the engine. &quot;Dark Forces&quot; was released in 1995 and featured 3D look, but more restricted than the free look of the earlier &quot;Ultima Underworld&quot; and &quot;System Shock&quot;.

Raven Software&#x27;s November 1994 release &quot;CyClones&quot; featured a basic implementation of the free look; main movement was via keyboard (with turning and strafing via key combinations), but the on-screen weapon aim point was moved independently via the mouse. Moving the aim point to the edge of the screen would cause the viewpoint to temporarily shift up or to the side. This system proved cumbersome and Raven Software did not develop this particular system further. The 1993 DOS version of &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; also used the mouse to aim the player&#x27;s weapon cross-hair, similar to &quot;CyClones&quot;, but the player&#x27;s viewpoint was controlled entirely by the keyboard and did not move with the cross-hair.

The next major step was using the mouse to control the free look. &quot;Marathon&quot; by Bungie, released in December 1994 for the Apple Macintosh was the first major release to feature the mouse-controlled free look that would later become universal. The first major game for PC to allow mouselook was &quot;Descent&quot;; it was not the default control mapping, but quickly became the de facto due to the game&#x27;s inherent need to constantly be able to look in all three dimensions. The first game with full-time fully 3D mouselook by default was &quot;&quot; (published by Bethesda Softworks in 1995). However, &quot;Terminator: Future Shock&quot; did not become very popular and the original &quot;Marathon&quot; was not available on the PC platform, so their impact was limited. &quot;Quake&quot; (1996), is widely considered to have been the turning point in making free look the standard, in part due to its Internet multiplayer feature, which allowed large numbers of mouse and keyboard players to face each other head-to-head, and proved the superiority of mouselook over keyboard-only controls. Although games using older engines continued to appear for a few years, the 3D accelerator boom in the mid-1990s meant that for the first time true 3D engines could be run on home PCs, and free mouselook would rapidly become essential and standard in almost every 3D game.

&quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; (1997) extended the spread of this technique, introducing it to consoles by incorporating the manual aiming of Sega&#x27;s light gun shooter &quot;Virtua Cop&quot; (1994) in its first-person shooter gameplay. According to creator Martin Hollis: &quot;We ended up with innovative gameplay, in part because we had &quot;Virtua Cop&quot; features in a FPS: A gun that only holds 7 bullets and a reload button, lots of position dependent hit animations, innocents you shouldn’t kill, and an aiming mode. When you press R in &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, the game basically switches to a &quot;Virtua Cop&quot; mode.&quot;

<text>A reticle, or reticule also known as a graticule, is a pattern of fine lines or markings built into the eyepiece of an optical device such as a telescopic sight, spotting scope, theodolite, optical microscope or the screen of an oscilloscope, to provide measurement references during visual inspections. Today, engraved lines or embedded fibers may be replaced by a digital image superimposed on a screen or eyepiece. Both terms may be used to describe any set of patterns used for aiding visual measurements and calibrations, but in modern use &quot;reticle&quot; is most commonly used for weapon sights, while &quot;graticule&quot; is more widely used for non-weapon measuring instruments such as oscilloscope display, astronomic telescopes, microscopes and slides, surveying instruments and other similar devices.

There are many variations of reticle pattern; this article concerns itself mainly with the most rudimentary reticle: the crosshair. Crosshairs are typically represented as a pair of perpendicularly intersecting lines in the shape of a cross, &quot;+&quot;, though many variations of additional features exist including dots, posts, concentric circles/horseshoes, chevrons, graduated markings, or a combination of above. Most commonly associated with telescopic sights for aiming firearms, crosshairs are also common in optical instruments used for astronomy and surveying, and are also popular in graphical user interfaces as a precision pointer. The reticle is said to have been invented by Robert Hooke, and dates to the 17th century. Another candidate as inventor is the amateur astronomer William Gascoigne, who predated Hooke.

The term &quot;reticle&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;reticulum&quot;, meaning small net.

==Uses==

===Firearms===

Telescopic sights for firearms, generally just called &quot;scopes&quot;, are probably the device most often associated with crosshairs. Motion pictures and the media often use a view through crosshairs as a dramatic device, which has given crosshairs wide cultural exposure.

====Reticle shape====
While the traditional thin crossing lines are the original and still the most familiar cross-hair shape, they are really best suited for precision aiming at high contrast targets, as the thin lines are easily lost in complex backgrounds, such as those encountered while hunting. Thicker bars are much easier to discern against a complex background, but lack the precision of thin bars. The most popular types of cross-hair in modern scopes are variants on the &quot;duplex&quot; cross-hair, with bars that are thick on the perimeter and thin out in the middle. The thick bars allow the eye to quickly locate the center of the reticle, and the thin lines in the center allow for precision aiming. The thin bars in a duplex reticle may also be designed to be used as a measure. Called a 30/30 reticle, the thin bars on such a reticle span 30 minutes of arc (0.5º), which is approximately equal to 30 inches at 100 yards or 90 centimeters at 100 meters. This enables an experienced shooter to deduce, on the basis of the known size of an object in view, (as opposed to guess or estimate) the range within an acceptable error limit.

====Wire crosshairs====
Originally crosshairs were constructed out of hair or spiderweb, these materials being sufficiently thin and strong. Many modern scopes use wire crosshairs, which can be flattened to various degrees to change the width. These wires are usually silver in color, but appear black when backlit by the image passing through the scope&#x27;s optics. Wire reticles are by nature fairly simple, as they require lines that pass all the way across the reticle, and the shapes are limited to the variations in thickness allowed by flattening the wire; duplex crosshairs, and crosshairs with dots are possible, and multiple horizontal or vertical lines may be used. The advantage of wire crosshairs is that they are fairly tough and durable, and provide no obstruction to light passing through the scope.

====Etched reticles====
The first suggestion for etched glass reticles was made by Philippe de La Hire in 1700. His method was based on engraving the lines on a glass plate with a diamond point. Many modern crosshairs are actually etched onto a thin plate of glass, which allows a far greater latitude in shapes. Etched glass reticles can have &quot;floating&quot; elements, which do not cross the reticle; circles and dots are common, and some types of glass reticles have complex sections designed for use in range estimation and bullet drop and drift compensation (see external ballistics). A potential disadvantage of glass reticles is that the surface of the glass reflects some light (about 4% per surface on uncoated glass) lessening transmission through the scope, although this light loss is near zero if the glass is multicoated (coating being the norm for all modern high quality optical products).

====Illuminated reticles====
Reticles may be illuminated, either by a plastic or fiber optic light pipe collecting ambient light or, in low light conditions, by a battery powered LED. Some sights also use the radioactive decay of tritium for illumination that can work for 11 years without using a battery, used in the British SUSAT sight for the SA80 (L85) assault rifle and in the American ACOG (Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight). Red is the most common color used, as it is the least destructive to the shooter&#x27;s night vision, but some products use green or yellow illumination, either as a single colour or changeable via user selection.

====Graticule====
Another term for reticle is &quot;graticule&quot;, which is frequently encountered in British and British military technical manuals. It came into common use during World War I.

===Reticle focal plane===
The reticle may be located at the front or rear focal plane (First Focal Plane (FFP) or Second Focal Plane (SFP)) of the telescopic sight. On fixed power telescopic sights there is no significant difference, but on variable power telescopic sights the front plane reticle remains at a constant size compared to the target, while rear plane reticles remain a constant size to the user as the target image grows and shrinks. Front focal plane reticles are slightly more durable, but most American users prefer that the reticle remains constant as the image changes size, so nearly all modern American variable power telescopic sights are rear focal plane designs. American and European high end optics manufacturers often leave the customer the choice between a FFP or SFP mounted reticle.

====Collimated reticles====
Collimated reticles are produced by non-magnifying optical devices such as reflector sights (often called &quot;reflex sights&quot;) that give the viewer an image of the reticle superimposed over the field of view, and blind collimator sights that are used with both eyes. Collimated reticles are created using refractive or reflective optical collimators to generate a collimated image of an illuminated or reflective reticle. These types of sights are used on surveying/triangulating equipment, to aid celestial telescope aiming, and as sights on firearms. Historically they were used on larger military weapon systems that could supply an electrical source to illuminate them and where the operator needed a wide field of view to track and range a moving target visually (i.e. weapons from the pre laser/radar/computer era). More recently sights using low power consumption durable light emitting diodes as the reticle (called &quot;red dot sight&quot;s) have become common on small arms with versions like the Aimpoint CompM2 being widely fielded by the U.S. Military.

====Holographic reticles====
Holographic weapon sights use a holographic image of a reticle at finite set range built into the viewing window and a collimated laser diode to illuminate it. An advantage to holographic sights is that they eliminate a type of parallax problem found in some optical collimator based sights (such as the red dot sight) where the spherical mirror used induces spherical aberration that can cause the reticle to skew off the sight&#x27;s optical axis. The use of a hologram also eliminates the need for image dimming narrow band reflective coatings and allows for reticles of almost any shape or mil size. A downside to the holographic weapon sight can be the weight and shorter battery life. As with red dot sights, holographic weapon sights have also become common on small arms with versions like the Eotech 512.A65 and similar models fielded by the U.S. Military and various law enforcement agencies.

===Surveying and astronomy===
In older instruments, reticle crosshairs and stadia marks were made using threads taken from the cocoon of the brown recluse spider. This very fine, strong spider silk makes for an excellent crosshair.

====Surveying====
In surveying, reticles are designed for specific uses. Levels and theodolites would have slightly different reticles. However, both may have features such as stadia marks to allow distance measurements.

====Astronomy====
For astronomical uses, reticles could be simple crosshair designs or more elaborate designs for special purposes. Telescopes used for polar alignment could have a reticle that indicates the position of Polaris relative to the north celestial pole. Telescopes that are used for very precise measurements would have a filar micrometer as a reticle; this could be adjusted by the operator to measure angular distances between stars.

For aiming telescopes, reflex sights are popular, often in conjunction with a small telescope with a crosshair reticle. They make aiming the telescope at an astronomical object easier.

The constellation Reticulum was designated to recognize the reticle and its contributions to astronomy.

<text>James Vincent Monaco (January 13, 1885 – October 16, 1945) was an Italian-born American composer of popular music.

==Life and career==
Monaco was born in Formia, Italy. His family emigrated to the United States when he was six, and he grew up in Albany, New York, where he started playing piano in bars by the age of 18. He relocated to Chicago, where he became known as &quot;Ragtime Jimmie&quot;, before moving to New York City in 1910.

He played piano at cafes in Manhattan and at Coney Island, and wrote his first successful song, &quot;Oh, You Circus Day&quot;, which was featured in a Broadway revue, &quot;Hanky Panky&quot;, in 1911. Further success came the following year with &quot;Row, Row, Row&quot; (lyrics by William Jerome) in the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies of 1912&quot;, and perhaps his best remembered song, &quot;You Made Me Love You&quot; (with lyrics by Joseph McCarthy), which was introduced by Al Jolson in 1913 and performed by Judy Garland with revised lyrics as &quot;Dear Mr Gable&quot; in 1937.

In 1914, Monaco became a charter member of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. Over the next two decades, Monaco &quot;presented the almost archetypal portrait of a successful Tin Pan Alley writer.&quot; 

Working with a number of lyricists, he wrote several more hits, including &quot;What Do You Want to Make Those Eyes at Me For?&quot; (1916; lyrics by Joseph McCarthy and Howard Johnson) and &quot;Dirty Hands, Dirty Face&quot; (1923; lyrics by Grant Clarke and Edgar Leslie), which was performed in 1927 by Al Jolson in &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;. He continued to work with Edgar Leslie, and their 1932 song &quot;Crazy People&quot; was used as the theme song to George Burns and Gracie Allen&#x27;s radio program. In the mid-1930s, Monaco also led his own dance band.

He moved to Hollywood in 1936 to work for Paramount Studios, and formed a songwriting partnership with lyricist Johnny Burke. They wrote successfully for several Bing Crosby movies, including the songs &quot;My Heart Is Taking Lessons&quot; (1938, from &quot;Doctor Rhythm&quot;), &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Pocketful of Dreams&quot; (1938, from &quot;Sing You Sinners&quot;), and &quot;Only Forever&quot; (1940, from &quot;Rhythm on the River&quot;). 

From 1942, Monaco worked with several lyricists, including Mack Gordon; their most successful song was &quot;I Can&#x27;t Begin to Tell You&quot; from the 1945 film &quot;The Dolly Sisters&quot;, one of four Monaco compositions that were nominated for Oscars.

Monaco died from a heart attack in 1945 in Beverly Hills, California, aged 60.

==Awards and recognition==
Four of Monaco&#x27;s songs received Academy Award nominations for Best Song:

*&quot;Only Forever&quot; (lyrics by Johnny Burke) from the 1940 film &quot;Rhythm on the River&quot;
* &quot;We Mustn&#x27;t Say Goodbye&quot; (lyrics by Al Dubin) from the 1943 film &quot;Stage Door Canteen&quot;
*&quot;I&#x27;m Making Believe&quot; (lyrics by Mack Gordon) from the 1944 film &quot;Sweet and Low-Down&quot;
*&quot;I Can&#x27;t Begin to Tell You&quot; (lyrics by Mack Gordon) from the 1945 film &quot;The Dolly Sisters&quot;. This was a posthumous nomination.

Monaco was posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970.

In 2005, a revue of Monaco&#x27;s music called &quot;Ragtime Jimmie&quot; opened in New York City as part of the American Composer Series.

<text>The Absolute at Large (Továrna na absolutno in the original Czech, literally translated as The Factory for the Absolute), is a science fiction novel written by Czech author Karel Čapek in 1922. The first sentence opens the story on New Year&#x27;s Day 1943 - a future date at the time of writing - and describes the fundamental transformations in society as the result of a new mystical source of virtually free energy.

==Plot==

The story centers on the invention of a reactor that can annihilate matter to produce cheap and abundant energy. Unfortunately, it produces something else as a by-product, the &quot;absolute&quot;. The &quot;absolute&quot; is a spiritual essence that according to some religious philosophies permeates all matter. It is associated with human religious experience, as an unsuspecting humanity is to find out all too soon in the story. The widespread adoption of the reactors cause an enormous outpouring of pure &quot;absolute&quot; into the world. This leads to an outburst of religious and nationalist fervor, causing the greatest, most global war in history.

Čapek describes this war in a self-consciously absurd manner. Characteristic of the war are distant military marches, hence for example &quot;battles of the Chinese with the Senegalese riflemen on the shores of the Finnish lakes.&quot; Some of the more prominent political changes the war causes include expulsion of the Russian army to Africa (via Europe) by the Chinese invasion, the conquest of East Asia by Japan that cuts the Chinese conquests in Russia and Europe down to the limits of the former Austro-Hungarian empire, and the Japanese conquest of North America. (The latter was able to occur because the United States were exhausted by a bloody civil war between the supporters and opponents of the Prohibition.)

&quot;Absolute&quot; does more than affect minds. It also does physical work. During the war, it causes catastrophes against the enemy (various parts of &quot;absolute&quot; support any given side in the conflict). At some point, it also becomes interested in production of material goods and produces them, in a supernatural manner, in enormous quantities. This leads to economic collapse and, absurdly enough, deficit of all manufactured items because, allegedly, once the price of goods has dropped to zero because of &quot;absolute&quot;, nobody cares to produce or distribute them any more. Starvation is averted because although &quot;absolute&quot; does not produce food, the peasants who &quot;do&quot; naturally do not let the price drop to zero. In fact they force every last penny from the urban population in return for food, hence saving humanity.

==Critical reception==
R. D. Mullen called the novel &quot;one of the genuine masterpieces of SF&quot;, but noted that &quot;it has surely had no great influence on popular SF&quot;.

Shazar was born Shneur Zalman Rubashov to a Hasidic family of the Chabad-Lubavitch denomination in Mir, near Minsk, in the Russian Empire (today in Grodno Region, Belarus). His mother&#x27;s family descended from Joel Sirkis. In his early years Shazar received a religious education.

He remained involved with Chabad for the rest of his life, assisting Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn, the sixth Lubavitcher Rebbe in founding the village of Kfar Chabad, and at his behest, allowed the religious community in Israel to set up their own educational system. He later corresponded with the seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe Menachem Mendel Schneerson, and visited him on multiple occasions.

In his teenage years he became involved in the Poale Zion Movement. He worked as a translator in a Zionist publishing house. He visited Palestine in 1911 but returned to Russia to serve in the army. In 1924, after his release, he immigrated to the British Mandate of Palestine, settling in Tel Aviv, and became a member of the secretariat of the Histadrut.

Shazar was married to Rachel Katznelson-Shazar, with whom he had one daughter.

He died on October 5, 1974, and was buried on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem.

==Journalistic and political career==

Shazar served as the editor-in-chief of the Israeli newspaper &quot;Davar&quot; from 1944 to 1949. In 1947, he was a member of the Jewish Agency&#x27;s delegation to the negotiations for the UN partition plan for Palestine and played a key role in drafting Israel&#x27;s Declaration of Independence.

He was elected to the first Knesset in 1949 as a member of Mapai, and was appointed Minister of Education in David Ben-Gurion&#x27;s first government. He was not a member of Ben-Gurion&#x27;s second cabinet, but retained his seat in the 1951 and 1955 elections. He also became a member of the Jewish Agency Executive in 1952. He resigned from the Knesset in 1956, and from 1956 to 1960 was acting chairman of the Jewish Agency&#x27;s Jerusalem Executive.

==President of the State of Israel==

Shazar was elected president by the Knesset in 1963. That same year, he attended the funeral of John F. Kennedy after his assassination in Dallas. In 1964, when Pope Paul VI visited Israel, Shazar read to him the verse in Micah stating that though other nations might follow other gods, “we will walk in the Name of our Lord God forever”. He was re-elected for a second term in 1968.

In 1969, Shazar sent one of 73 Apollo 11 Goodwill Messages to NASA for the historic first lunar landing. The message still rests on the lunar surface today. It states, &quot;From the President of Israel in Jerusalem with hope for &#x27;abundance of peace so long as the Moon endureth&#x27; (Psalms 72,7).&quot; In 1973 he was succeeded by Ephraim Katzir.

<doc id="673893" wikidata="Q3282018" url="?curid=673893" title="The Spine (album)">
<text>The Spine is the tenth full-length studio album by They Might Be Giants. The album was released on July 5, 2004 in the UK, and July 13 in the US. The album was released alongside a companion EP, &quot;The Spine Surfs Alone&quot;. It was preceded by the &quot;Indestructible Object&quot; EP, which featured two tracks that appear on &quot;The Spine&quot;.

==Promotion==
Three music videos were produced for &quot;The Spine&quot;. The first, a Flash-animated video for &quot;Experimental Film&quot;, was created in conjunction with The Brothers Chaps, and features characters from their animated series &quot;Homestar Runner&quot;. An animated music video for &quot;Bastard Wants to Hit Me&quot; appears on the DVD for &quot;Venue Songs&quot;. The video was directed by Aaron Sorenson and Courtney Booker of Laika. The video was nominated for the Annie Award for &quot;Best Animated Television Commercial&quot; in 2005. A music video for &quot;Damn Good Times&quot; was animated with previous band collaborator Divya Srinivasan.

==Track listing==
==Reception==
&quot;The Spine&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. Writing for AllMusic, Heather Phares found that John and John had already exhausted the album&#x27;s best content on the preceding EP, &quot;Indestructible Object&quot;. Phares concluded that the album contained a few engaging hooks, but was overall inconsistent. Josh Modell of &quot;The AV Club&quot; berated the album&#x27;s lack of &quot;idiosyncrasies&quot;, and reported that &quot;The Spine&quot; was generally unsurprising. Contrarily, Patrick Schabe of PopMatters lauded the album for its uncharacteristically traditional rock arrangements.

<text>The Devil&#x27;s Own is a 1997 American action thriller film directed by Alan J. Pakula, starring Harrison Ford and Brad Pitt, with Rubén Blades, Natascha McElhone, Julia Stiles, Margaret Colin, Treat Williams, and George Hearn in supporting roles. The plot revolves around a member of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (Pitt) who comes to the United States to obtain black market anti-aircraft missiles, but his plan is complicated by an Irish-American policeman (Ford), whom the IRA member has come to regard as family.

The film was released by Columbia Pictures on March 26, 1997. It received mixed reviews from critics, but was a financial success. This was the final film of director Pakula, who died the year after its release, and the final film photographed by Gordon Willis, who retired soon after.

==Plot==
In 1972 Northern Ireland, eight-year-old Frankie McGuire witnesses his father gunned down for republican sympathies.

Twenty years later in Belfast, Frankie and three fellow IRA members are ambushed by the British Army and Special Reconnaissance Unit agents. Two of the IRA gunmen are killed, but Frankie and his comrade Sean Phelan escape after managing to kill three soldiers, a civilian and four rival loyalists. Pursued by a British Army helicopter, Frankie&#x27;s commander Martin MacDuff decides that the IRA needs Stinger missiles to fight back.

Under the alias &quot;Rory Devaney&quot;, Frankie arrives in New York City to buy missiles. American Judge Peter Fitzsimmons, a longtime IRA supporter, arranges for him to stay with Irish-American NYPD Sergeant Tom O&#x27;Meara, his wife Sheila, and their three daughters on Staten Island. Believing that &quot;Rory&quot; is an immigrant construction worker, Tom and his family welcome Frankie into their home.

Sean reunites with Frankie, acquiring an old fishing boat to smuggle the missiles home. Frankie cuts a deal with black market arms dealer and Irish mobster Billy Burke to receive the missiles in several weeks time. Fitzsimmons has the money for the deal delivered to Frankie by Megan Doherty, another IRA operative posing as his family&#x27;s nanny, and Frankie hides the duffel bag of cash in the O&#x27;Meara&#x27;s basement. Megan later warns Frankie that MacDuff has been killed by British authorities and they must postpone the deal, much to Burke&#x27;s displeasure.

After lying to protect his partner, Eddie Diaz, for fatally shooting an unarmed thief in the back, a guilt-stricken Tom decides to retire from the force. He comes clean to Sheila and they return home, only to be confronted by masked intruders. Frankie arrives and he and Tom fight off the intruders as Sheila calls the police, but they are held at gunpoint until sirens approach and the assailants flee. Frankie confronts Burke for sending his men to steal the money, shooting one of the attackers in the knee, but Burke reveals that he is holding Sean hostage and demands payment for the missiles.

Realizing that the intruders were searching Frankie&#x27;s room in the basement, Tom discovers the duffel bag of cash. Confronted by Tom, Frankie reveals his true identity, but Tom has called Eddie and they arrest him. Stuck in traffic en route to the police station, Frankie overpowers Tom and takes his gun, mortally wounding Eddie when he draws his own gun, but is forced to flee without the money.

With Eddie dead, Tom is questioned by the FBI and their British counterparts and realizes that they intend to kill Frankie, who meets Burke at an abandoned warehouse. Demanding the money, Burke presents Frankie with the missiles as well as Sean&#x27;s severed head, and Frankie hands over a duffel bag rigged with a bomb. The resulting explosion allows Frankie to kill Burke and his men, and he drives off with the missiles.

Frankie goes to Megan at the Fitzsimmons&#x27; residence, determined to complete his mission and deliver the missiles to Ireland. Downstairs, Tom interrupts a cocktail party and confronts the judge, before recognizing Megan from a photo in Frankie&#x27;s bag, but Frankie escapes. Tom convinces Megan that only he can save Frankie from being killed by the authorities, and she directs him to the boat.

At the dock, Tom sneaks aboard as Frankie sets sail with the missiles, leading to a shootout. Tom is wounded and disarmed, and Frankie prepares to kill him but realizes he too has been shot. Tom embraces a dying Frankie, recognizing that they both were fighting for causes they believe in, before steering the boat back to shore.

==Cast==
==Production==
=== Development ===
The film&#x27;s origins date back to the early 1980s as a pitch by Lawrence Gordon and Robert F. Colesberry. The producers hired screenwriter Kevin Jarre to write the first draft; as Gordon recalled &quot;Jarre had disappeared for a couple of years and came back with a wonderful screenplay&quot;, which was an action-packed tale about a heroic operative of the Irish Republican Army. Gordon acquired the script in January 1990.

In 1991, Gordon took the script to Brad Pitt, who was not yet well-known at the time. Pitt enthusiastically accepted the script, which Gordon recalled &quot;was supposed to be a gritty, low-budget thriller with Brad as the only star.&quot; The project began moving forward towards pre-production at Universal Pictures but was left at a standstill due to Pitt&#x27;s lack of acting credits at the time, as well as the politically controversial subject matter on which the story was based.

In the ensuing years, interest in the project was renewed thanks to Pitt&#x27;s performances in &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot;, &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot;, and &quot;12 Monkeys.&quot; The project was stuck in development at Universal before the studio put it into turnaround, eventually ending up at Columbia Pictures. Pitt visited Belfast in preparation for the role and suffered bruises after he was attacked on the city&#x27;s Falls Road after being mistaken for a Protestant.

=== Casting ===
Despite having Pitt&#x27;s name attached, the studio was of the opinion that he could not carry a major film alone. For the role of Tom O&#x27;Meara, both Gene Hackman and Sean Connery had been considered at various points, but at Pitt&#x27;s suggestion, Harrison Ford was approached for the role, which at that time was more of a character role. Ford read the script and agreed to play the part, though that meant the script had to be rewritten to create a fuller role for Ford and a more complicated relationship between the characters played by the two men.

To expand Ford&#x27;s role, producers brought in David Aaron Cohen and Vincent Patrick to rewrite Jarre&#x27;s script. Patrick stated: &quot;There was no way they were going to shoot the original script. It had to become a two-hero piece with equal action heroes. Supporting two stars is what this was about&quot;. Cohen added: &quot;Take it from Columbia&#x27;s perspective. Twenty million, and you want Harrison to be the supporting actor?&quot;

James Gray was offered to direct the project but he turned it down, as did Bryan Singer, and Milcho Manchevski. It was Pitt and Ford&#x27;s suggestion to bring Alan J. Pakula in as director., Pakula initially turned it down, as he wanted to focus on other projects that he was developing at the time; he rejected the offer two more times but eventually accepted the job after Columbia offered to pay him a fee of 5 million dollars.

=== Filming ===
Principal photography started in February 1996, with the script &quot;still in flux&quot;; according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;ego clashes, budget overruns and long delays plagued the project.&quot; Pitt &quot;threatened to quit early in the shoot, complaining that the script was incomplete and incoherent&quot; and later &quot;denounced the movie as &#x27;the most irresponsible bit of film making – if you can even call it that – that I&#x27;ve ever seen.&#x27;&quot;

To ease Pitt&#x27;s frustrations, the producers hired screenwriter Terry George one week before principal photography was to start. George&#x27;s primary purpose was to concentrate on helping further develop Pitt&#x27;s character, and what the actor thought was a superficial outlook on the IRA situation.

In March 1996, Pakula hired screenwriter Robert Mark Kamen to provide rewrites during production. Kamen noted the difficulties on set: &quot;They were running out of script to shoot. They had a script that wasn&#x27;t acceptable to either actor. Alan [Pakula] didn&#x27;t start with a script that everyone had signed off on, we were flying blind...It was scary&quot;.

Kamen met with both Ford and Pitt separately to discuss their ideas about improving the script, then he and Pakula would review the material, Pakula would add his own critical comments, and Kamen would go off to write the new scenes.

Contrary to the rumors that were reported at the time, Kamen insisted that both actors were agreeable to each other. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t the tension between them that made things tense. It was the tension each had with their own parts.&quot;

In June 2023, Ford admitted that he was partially at fault for the tension between him and Pitt, stating: &quot;I understand why he wanted to stay with his point of view, and I wanted to stay with my point of view, or I was imposing my point of view, and it&#x27;s fair to say that that&#x27;s what Brad felt, it was complicated&quot;.

According to Pakula, one problem was that the film&#x27;s plot did not fall along conventionally simple Hollywood lines, as Ford and Pitt were both playing &quot;good guys&quot; according to each of their own distinct moral codes. &quot;The New York Times&quot; characterized Ford&#x27;s character as &quot;the upright American cop who deplores violence&quot; and Pitt&#x27;s as &quot;an I.R.A. gunman for whom violence is a reasonable solution to his people&#x27;s 300 years of troubles.&quot; Pakula compared his intent with the two characters to that depicted in &quot;Red River&quot;, a 1948 western in which John Wayne&#x27;s character is defied by his young protégé, played by Montgomery Clift.

&quot;The Devil&#x27;s Own&quot; was filmed on location and at the Chelsea Piers studios in New York City, as well as in Newark, Hoboken, Jersey City, Bayonne, Sandy Hook and Montclair, New Jersey and Greenport, New York on Long Island. For security reasons, the Northern Ireland scenes were instead shot in the Republic of Ireland. The opening scenes were filmed at Port Oriel, Clogherhead, County Louth, Republic of Ireland. The Belfast shootout scenes were filmed in Inchicore, Dublin in July 1996. Other location shoots in Ireland were in the Wicklow Mountains.

Two months before it opened, the film was still unfinished: Pakula, unhappy with the final scene (&quot;a showdown on a boat with a cargo of Stinger missiles&quot;), called the actors and crew back for additional filming. The scene was &quot;rewritten and reshot over two days in a studio in California.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;The Devil&#x27;s Own&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, it has a approval rating based on reviews, with an average score of 5.2/10. On Metacritic, it has a score of 53 out of 100, based on reviews from 26 critics, indicating “mixed or average reviews.” Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film 2½ stars out of 4, saying it showed &quot;ignorance of the history of Northern Ireland&quot; and that &quot;the issues involved between the two sides are never mentioned.&quot; The review criticised the contrived plot, stating &quot;The moral reasoning in the film is so confusing that only by completely sidestepping it can the plot work at all.&quot; Pitt and Ford were praised, with Ebert complimenting the pair, describing them as &quot;enormously appealing and gifted actors, and to the degree that the movie works, it&#x27;s because of them.&quot;

James Berardinelli gave the film 2½ stars out of 4, saying:

Janet Maslin called it an &quot;unexpectedly solid thriller&quot; with a &quot;first-rate, madly photogenic performance&quot; by Pitt; she notes that it is &quot;directed by Alan J. Pakula in a thoughtful urban style that recalls the vintage New York stories of Sidney Lumet&quot; and &quot;handsomely photographed by Gordon Willis&quot;. Richard Schickel called it &quot;quite a good movie – a character-driven (as opposed to whammy-driven) suspense drama – dark, fatalistic and, within its melodramatically stretched terms, emotionally plausible&quot;; he said Pakula &quot;develops his story patiently, without letting its tensions unravel.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave it a &quot;B+,&quot; calling it a &quot;quiet, absorbing, shades-of-gray drama, a kind of thriller meditation on the schism in Northern Ireland.&quot;

A reviewer for Salon.com called it &quot;a disjointed, sluggish picture&quot; with a problematic script that &quot;bears the marks of tinkering&quot;: &quot;swatches of the story appear to be missing, relationships aren&#x27;t clearly defined, and characters aren&#x27;t identified.&quot; 
&quot;Variety&quot; said: 

The film grossed $140 million, exceeding its $90 million budget, of which $43 million was from North America.

Brad Pitt&#x27;s Belfast brogue was criticized by several reviewers. In 2024, the website Irish Central listed it as one of &quot;The Worst Irish Accents in Hollywood Movies&quot;.

=== Cast and crew response ===
In retrospect, Brad Pitt said: &quot;I really like &quot;Devil&#x27;s Own&quot;. It was a good schooling for me. Still, I think the movie could have been better. Literally, the script got thrown out.&quot;

Harrison Ford is also very fond of the movie: &quot;We had a real hard time making it, but Alan [Pakula] made, I think, a really good movie out of it.&quot;

=== British Royal family controversy ===
The film was involved in adverse publicity when, two months before her death, Diana, Princess of Wales took 15-year-old Prince William, and 12-year-old Prince Harry, to see the movie. The movie was restricted to movie-goers aged 15 or older, and the Princess persuaded the cinema to let Prince Harry stay despite him being three years underage. She was criticised for flouting the law, for using her influence to persuade the cinema&#x27;s employees to flout the law, and because of the movie&#x27;s subject matter (which was said to glamorise the IRA – highly sensitive given that her sons&#x27; great-uncle Earl Mountbatten was assassinated by the IRA). She later apologised, saying she had been unaware of the film&#x27;s content.

==Novelization==
A paperback novel of the film, written by Christopher Newman, was published by Dell Publishing, and released in 1997.

<text>Peter Joseph Ross is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics.

==Publication history==
The character was created by Leo Dorfman and George Papp, and first appeared in &quot;Superboy&quot; #86 (January 1961).

==Fictional character biography==
===Silver Age===

Pete was the childhood best friend of Clark Kent in Smallville. One night when they were camping together, Pete secretly saw Clark changing into Superboy to attend to an emergency. Pete kept his knowledge of the superhero&#x27;s secret identity to himself, even avoiding revealing his discovery to Clark. Pete resolved to use this knowledge to help his friend, for example by creating a distraction to allow Clark to slip away from a dangerous situation without raising suspicion.

The Legion of Super-Heroes was aware of Pete&#x27;s assistance to Clark and made him an honorary member during his teenage years. It is stated that Pete Ross&#x27;s knowledge of Superboy&#x27;s secret identity will eventually save Superman&#x27;s life, with the Legion allowing him to keep his knowledge.

As an adult, Pete became a widower with a son named Jonathan, who also learned the secret of Superman&#x27;s secret identity. When Pete&#x27;s son was kidnapped by an alien race, Pete revealed to Clark his knowledge of his friend&#x27;s dual identity, imploring Superman&#x27;s help. When Clark was unable to provide this help, Pete suffered a nervous breakdown and attempted to discredit his former friend. Pete resided in a mental institution until his son was eventually saved.

In Alan Moore&#x27;s story &quot;Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow&quot;, Pete is captured by Toyman and Prankster and tortured into revealing Superman&#x27;s true identity before being killed and stuffed in a toychest for Superman to find. Eventually, Superman discovered they were being manipulated by Mister Mxyzptlk.

====Pocket Universe====
Following &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, Superman did not become a superhero until he was an adult and Superboy never existed. The Legion of Super-Heroes remained dependent on Superboy&#x27;s existence as its primary inspiration. In an attempt to resolve the paradox, a Superman/Legion story was crafted, explaining that a version of the Silver Age Superboy and his supporting characters inhabit a pocket universe created by the Time Trapper. Following the pocket universe Superboy&#x27;s death, Lex Luthor is tricked into releasing Kryptonian criminals General Zod, Quex-Ul and Zaora from the Phantom Zone. They decimate Earth and kill Pete Ross, among others.

===Modern Age===
The modern version of Pete is a far more minor character in the Superman comics, who eventually married Lana Lang, with the two having a son, Clark. Peter Ross, although the relationship is occasionally strained due to Lana&#x27;s knowledge of Clark&#x27;s secret and Pete feeling that he was fundamentally Lana&#x27;s second choice. The two are presently divorced, even after briefly reuniting following the Ruin storyline. Pete was Vice President of the United States under Lex Luthor and briefly served as President following Luthor&#x27;s impeachment but quickly resigned.

In the modern comic book continuity, Pete was not initially aware of Clark&#x27;s secret. Instead, the secret was known by the villainous Manchester Black, who informed then-President Luthor of the secret, only later to wipe his memory of it. Prior to losing the knowledge of Clark&#x27;s secret, Lex informed Pete that his close friend Clark Kent is in fact Superman. While Pete initially refrained from telling Clark about his knowledge, he did eventually tell him in &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot; #641.

Recently, it appeared that Ross had become a villain named &quot;Ruin&quot;, but it was later revealed that he had instead been kidnapped by the real Ruin, Professor Emil Hamilton. Hamilton also kidnapped Pete&#x27;s wife and child. Superman defeated the insane Professor Hamilton, rescued Pete, Lana, and their child, and exonerated Pete of the charges against him.

Pete has returned to Smallville without Lana to raise their son. He was seen attending the funeral of Jonathan Kent.

During the &quot;Blackest Night&quot; storyline, Pete works at Smallville&#x27;s general store.

<text>Bag people (, meshochniks, or &quot;people with bags&quot;) is a term in Russian and other Slavic languages that refers to people, who trade for personal use or for profit, recognizable by their large sacks.

Some of them were people from the cities travelling to the countryside to buy food for small scale trade or for personal consumption, often exchanging it for material goods from farmers due to collapse of the monetary system. Others were people from the countryside doing the opposite trade.

Historically, the &quot;bag people&quot; have appeared in response to economic and political collapse that ended organized delivery and distribution of food in the cities. The phenomenon was very widespread during and soon after the Russian Revolution. It also flourished throughout Eastern Europe and Germany after the devastation of World War I. With the devastation of the economy during the Russian Civil War and the period of war communism with its policy of &quot;prodrazvyorstka&quot; (food requisition by state), &quot;meshochniks&quot; from countryside were seen as profiteers and persecuted by the Cheka.

The &quot;meshochnik&quot; phenomenon was revived on a different scale in the Soviet Union in the end of the 1980s. With the lifting of the abroad travel restrictions in the Soviet Union, Soviet people traveled abroad to exchange cheaply purchased Soviet goods for goods scarcely produced or altogether absent in Soviet Union (and post-Soviet states). They have become known as &quot;shuttle traders&quot;. The business of shuttle trade continued well beyond the collapse of the Soviet Union.

In literature, &quot;bag people&quot; are mentioned, for example, in Remarque&#x27;s &quot;The Road Back&quot; and Karel Čapek&#x27;s &quot;The Absolute at Large&quot;.

<text>The Road Back, also translated as The Way Back, () is a novel by German author Erich Maria Remarque, commonly regarded as a sequel to his 1929 novel &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;. It was first serialized in the German newspaper &quot;Vossische Zeitung&quot; between December 1930 and January 1931, and published in book form in April 1931. 

== Plot ==
Although the book follows different characters from those in &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;, it can be assumed that they were in the same company, as the characters recall other characters from the earlier novel. Tjaden is the only member of the 2nd Company to feature prominently in both books. 

Set a few weeks after the end of &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;, the novel deals with the fall of the German Empire and details the experience of young men in Germany who have returned from the trenches of World War I and are trying to integrate back into civilian life. Its most salient feature is the main characters&#x27; pessimism about contemporary society which, they feel, is morally bankrupt because it has allegedly caused the war and apparently does not wish to reform itself.

For example in one scene, a group of student veterans are forced to endure a corny speech by their professor who eulogizes their fallen comrades as having entered a “long sleep beneath the green grasses.” The student veterans mock the professor for his naive platitudes with one, Westerholt shouting, “in the mud of shell holes they are lying, knocked rotten, ripped in pieces, gone down into the bog—Green grasses!&quot; 

== Reception ==
The book was banned during Nazi rule.

== Preservation ==

Under the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998, the book will enter the public domain in the United States in 2027.

== Adaptations==
*1937, &quot;The Road Back&quot; – motion picture directed by James Whale and starring, among others, Noah Beery Jr. and Richard Cromwell.

== English translations ==
* Arthur Wesley Wheen, as &quot;The Road Back&quot;. Published in 1931 by Little, Brown, and Company, McClelland &amp; Stewart and G.P. Putnam and Co.
* Brian Murdoch, as &quot;The Way Back&quot;. Published in 2019 by &quot;Vintage Classics&quot;, .

<text>Standesamt Margonin was a civil registration district (Standesamt) located in Kreis Kolmar, Posen of the German Empire (1871–1918) and administered 21 communities.
Bud = Budsin; Kol = Kolmar; Mar = Margonin; Wil = Wilhelmstreu

== Geography ==
Margonin was on the north end of a finger lake, where a mill stream emptied the lake into the Netze (Polish: Noteć) River. The Margonin lake dominated the southern portion of the area, blocking east–west traffic. North of Margonin lay Standesamt Samotschin. A bridge crossed the river, providing access to southern Kreis Wirsitz. West of Margonin, the road and railroad diverged on their way to Kreis&#x27; seat of Kolmar (Chodziesen; Polish: &quot;Chodzież&quot;). 

The railroad swung north to Samotschin before following the bluff overlooking the river plain. The road ran westward and then swung north to follow the railroad through to Kolmar. In the other direction, the road and railroad ran east and a little south, towards Gollantsch and Kreis Exin, passing through the strip of Kreis Wongrowitz that claims a small piece of the Netze riverbank. The only major road to the south exited Margonin at the southeast, and arched east on its way to the town of Wongrowitz, seat of its Kreis.

Woods sheltered the east of the lake, ran northeast past the Margoninsdorf estate and forestry school, and northwest, on the western side of the stream. Several mills shared the stream there. Aside from the mills, very little industry existed, save from weavers in the early days, and some brewing, conducted by the small Jewish population.

Margonin was a market town, and had churches for all three faiths. The Catholic parish church belonged to the deanery of Czarnikau, which was part of the Posen diocese.

The town suffered destruction by the Swedes, by floods, and cholera.

<doc id="673947" wikidata="Q116127" url="?curid=673947" title="Kichisaburō Nomura">
<text>was an admiral in the Imperial Japanese Navy and was the ambassador to the United States at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor.

==Early life and career==
Nomura was born in Wakayama city, Wakayama Prefecture. He graduated from the 26th class of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy in 1898, with a ranking of 2nd out of a class of 57 cadets. As a midshipman, he served on the corvette &quot;Hiei&quot; and battleship &quot;Yashima&quot;. He was promoted to ensign on January 12, 1900, and to sub-lieutenant on October 1, 1901. As a crewman, he made a voyage to the United States on the battleship &quot;Mikasa&quot; from 1901 to 1902.

Promoted to lieutenant on September 26, 1903, he served on a large number of ships, including the gunboat &quot;Maya&quot;, corvette &quot;Kongō&quot;, and cruiser &quot;Tokiwa&quot;. He served as chief navigator on the cruiser &quot;Saien&quot; (1904) and cruiser &quot;Takachiho&quot; during the Russo-Japanese War. After the war, he was chief navigator on the cruisers &quot;Hashidate&quot; and &quot;Chitose&quot;. In March 1908, he was sent as naval attaché to Austria. He was promoted to lieutenant commander on September 25, 1908, and became naval attaché to Germany in 1910. He returned to Japan in May 1911 and became executive officer on the cruiser &quot;Otowa&quot; in September 1911. In June 1912, he was assigned a number of staff roles and was promoted to commander on December 1, 1913.

During World War I, from 11 December 1914 until 1 June 1918, Nomura was naval attaché to the United States. While in the United States, he was promoted to captain on April 1, 1917.

On Nomura&#x27;s return to Japan, he received his first command, the cruiser &quot;Yakumo&quot;. However, only a month later, he was reassigned to the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff, joining Japan&#x27;s delegation to the Versailles Peace Treaty Conference. Following the conclusion of negotiations, he returned to Washington, DC, to participate in the Washington Naval Conference of 1921–1922.

==Admiral==
On June 1, 1922, Nomura was promoted to rear admiral. He served as chief of the 3rd section of the Navy General Staff, followed by Commander of the 1st Expeditionary Fleet, Director of the Education Bureau, and Vice Chief of the Navy General Staff. He was promoted to vice admiral on December 1, 1926. On June 11, 1930, Nomura became Commander in Chief of the Kure Naval District. He was Commander in Chief of the Yokosuka Naval District in December 1930.

During the First Shanghai Incident in 1932, Nomura was commander of the Imperial Japanese Navy Third Fleet, supporting the Army, which was under the command of Admiral Yoshinori Shirakawa.

A few months later in April 1932, a Korean independence activist named Yun Bong-gil threw a bomb at Japanese dignitaries including Nomura while they were attending a celebration of Emperor Hirohito&#x27;s birthday at Shanghai&#x27;s Hongkou Park. Shirakawa was seriously wounded in the attack and died of his injuries the following month. Shigemitsu, the Ambassador to China, lost his right leg, and Nomura was blinded in one eye.

Nomura was promoted to full admiral on March 1, 1933. From 1933 to 1937, Nomura served as Naval Councilor on the Supreme War Council, and retired from active service in 1937.

==Diplomat==

After his retirement, Nomura was principal of the Gakushūin Peer&#x27;s school from 1937 to 1939. He was appointed Foreign Minister of Japan from 1939 to 1940 in the cabinet of Nobuyuki Abe.

On November 27, 1940, Nomura was sent as ambassador to the United States, replacing Kensuke Horinouchi, who had served since March 1939. Roosevelt, who as Assistant Secretary of the Navy knew Nomura back in his Washington DC years, welcomed the appointment of the fellow Navy man whom he liked as an honest man. Throughout much of 1941, Nomura negotiated with United States Secretary of State Cordell Hull to prevent the war between Japan and the United States. Nomura attempted to resolve issues including the Japanese conflict with China, the Japanese occupation of French Indochina, and the US oil embargo against Japan. Nomura&#x27;s repeated pleas to his superiors to offer the Americans meaningful concessions were rejected by his government, while Hull and his boss Roosevelt were far from yielding themselves. On November 15, 1941, Nomura was joined by a &quot;special envoy&quot; to Washington, Saburō Kurusu.

The retired Admiral, and in fact the entire Japanese Foreign Office, was kept in the dark as to the Japanese Navy&#x27;s impending attack upon Pearl Harbor. Nomura and Kurusu had to decode the radioed message of Japan&#x27;s breaking off of the negotiations with the United States, which practically meant war. It was sent from Japan on Monday, December 8, Japan time, and received while the Washington embassy&#x27;s technical support staff were still on their Sunday off. Nomura stated that was why he was unable to deliver the message until after the actual attack had taken place.

In his memoirs, Hull credited Nomura for trying sincerely to prevent the war. While the Japanese Consulate struggled to decipher their own code, Washington had broken it and Hull knew how Nomura was being used by Tokyo as a convenient time-buying ploy. All in vain, but Nomura, who understood America and respected it, always hoped for the breakthrough for peace and believed it was possible.

After the beginning of the war with the USA the Japanese diplomats were interned in Homestead Resort in Hot Springs, Virginia and were later transferred to the Greenbrier Hotel in West Virginia. In the summer of 1942 they sailed to Portuguese Mozambique, where they were exchanged with Americans arriving from Japan.

==Later life==
On August 20, 1942, Nomura returned to Japan. He continued to serve in an unofficial capacity as an advisor to the government through World War II, and he was appointed to the Privy Council in May 1945.

After the war, the well-connected and well-liked Nomura started new careers. He was frequently visited and supported by the members of American Council on Japan including the former US Ambassador to Tokyo, Joseph Grew, who were convinced that their amiable old friend still had an important role to play in newly democratic Japan and the new US-Japan relationship. He was invited by Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida, close ally of GHQ, the US Forces in Japan, and of the American Council, to serve as a committee member studying the rearmament of Japan during the Cold War.

In 1954, Nomura ran for the House of Councillors (upper house) and was elected by a landslide. He was also recruited by Konosuke Matsushita, a fellow Wakayama city native and the founder of Panasonic, as a general manager for JVC, Victor Company of Japan, which was owned by Matsushita and Nomura quickly reestablished its former tie with RCA in US. In the late 1950s, he was considered to be a strong candidate to head the Defense Agency by two prime ministers, Ichirō Hatoyama and Nobusuke Kishi, however he declined both offers and expressed his belief in civilian control of armed forces. Nomura had been a civilian for nearly two decades by that time, but was still regarded by many as a retired admiral of the old Imperial Japanese Navy.

Nomura was re-elected to the upper house in 1960 and died in office in 1964.

<doc id="673949" wikidata="Q3318207" url="?curid=673949" title="Mœnia">
<text>Mœnia is a Mexican electronic/synthpop/ambient group. Popular within the Latin club scene while simultaneously pioneering a darker, more experimental, more poetic side of Spanish-language electronica, Mœnia has had three top-20 hits. Mœnia is often considered one of the first successful experimental Mexican music composers and performers, finding commercial viability in a market normally dominated by Latin ballad crooners, teenage vocal groups and musical styles with more mass appeal like cumbia, reggaeton and ranchera. Mœnia is also popular in other parts of Latin America, including the Argentinian and Chilean music markets, where they have also charted. Some of their most recognized singles include &quot;Estabas Ahí&quot;, &quot;No Dices Más&quot; and &quot;Manto Estelar&quot;.

==History==
===Early years (1985–1990)===
The group&#x27;s formation dates back to 1985 while attending junior high school. The project began when sophomore year student Juan Carlos Lozano along with Alfonso Pichardo and Jorge Soto shared various musical tastes such as punk and New wave. At the same time in this era Spanish language rock music was also having a tremendous impact on Latin American listeners. Their musical influences include New Order, Erasure, OMD, The Cure, Depeche Mode, The Sisters of Mercy among others. Later on in their high school years the trio would compete in school organized music recitals, played live sets in small nightclubs and even recorded a few demos. It was during this time when the three had a very clear vision of what they intended to do in the music scene. The band&#x27;s first moniker was that of &#x27; 5mentarios &#x27;, its line up originally consisted of Alfonso Pichardo as lead vocalist, Juan Carlos Lozano as lead guitarist, Jorge Soto on keyboards, Abraham Rodríguez on synthesizers and Carlos Mercado on drums. Rodríguez abandoned 5mentarios in mid 1990.

===Setbacks and later success, &quot;Mœnia&quot; (1991–1998)===
In 1991, the group scored a contract with PolyGram and recorded a self-titled &#x27;debut&#x27; the following year. With very few copies released, the album included an early but darker sounding version of &quot;Color melancolía&quot; (which was re-recorded in the 1996 edition), however it did not meet significant expectation and was immediately deemed a commercial failure. The failed album is considered by many longtime fans as a precursor in how it would characterize Moenia&#x27;s sound in the years that followed. 

After that album&#x27;s failed attempt, In 1993 Pichardo steps down from the band as he decided to complete his master&#x27;s degree in the United States, the situation forced Lozano to take over as vocalist.

Alejandro Ortega (Alex Midi), a self-taught musician on guitar and synthesizers who was also a DJ at several nightclubs in the early 1990s joins the band in 1994.

By 1996, the band is signed to Universal Music to record their official debut &quot;Mœnia&quot;, the debut album featured hits like &quot;No puedo estar sin ti&quot; and &quot;Dejame entrar&quot; (becoming club scene hymns) followed by a remix compilation album &quot;Mœnia Mixes&quot;. Much of the lyrical content in Moenia&#x27;s 1996 debut were composed by Pichardo and yet were vocalized by Lozano. A similar situation happens with &quot;Adición+&quot; (1999) when much of its lyrical content was composed by Lozano and later vocalized by Pichardo upon his return to Moenia.

===Post Lozano era – &quot;Adición+&quot;, &quot;Le Modulor&quot;, &quot;Televisor&quot; (1998–2003)===
Juan Carlos exits Moenia in late 1998 after an extensive tour and moved on to form the still electronically oriented but more guitar-centered Morbo, despite the acclaimed success of 1996&#x27;s &quot;Mœnia&quot; and its subsequent album of remixes (a risky and previously unheard of novelty in the Mexican music industry), Pichardo returned with the remaining two of his former bandmates to complete Mœnia&#x27;s line-up, which has remained unchanged since 1999. Moenia&#x27;s second album &quot;Adición+&quot; featured hits like &quot;No Dices Más&quot; and &quot;Regreso a Casa&quot;. Their third album &quot;Le Modulor&quot; (2001), featured tracks like &quot;Molde Perfecto&quot; but &quot;Le Modulor&quot; did not have the same impact on listeners like the two previous albums did. 2003 saw the release of their third album &quot;Televisor&quot;, which featured the smash singles &quot;¿En qué momento?&quot; and &quot;Tú sabes lo que quiero&quot;. The music video for &quot;Tú sabes lo que quiero&quot; stirred controversy at the time due to its racy sexualized themes, causing several music video networks to stop airing the piece.

===&quot;Stereo Hits&quot;, &quot;HitsLive&quot; (2004–2005)===
&quot;Stereo Hits&quot; is by far Mœnia&#x27;s highest-selling album to date. It is a series of successful 1980s and 1990s Latin pop/rock and ballad hit covers such as &quot;En Algún Lugar&quot; by Duncan Dhu, &quot;Tren Al Sur&quot; by Los Prisioneros, &quot;Beber de Tu Sangre&quot; by Los Amantes de Lola, &quot;Mátenme Porque Me Muero&quot; by Caifanes and &quot;Ni Tú Ni Nadie&quot; by Alaska y Dinarama. The album was originally intended to serve as a stopgap to keep fans happy while the group worked on their next album, but became so popular that it was soon followed by a tour, which in turn was followed by a live album of its own in 2005, &quot;HitsLive&quot;. &quot;HitsLive&quot; was recorded live in Mexico City&#x27;s National Auditorium. This compilation features Moenia&#x27;s early hits up to the Stereo Hits era.

===&quot;Solar&quot; (2006–2007)===
In 2006 Mœnia released a new album, named &quot;Solar&quot;, which follows a more 1980s electropop style, including more electric guitar sounds. Also includes a duet with Denisse Guerrero (of Belanova) called &quot;Me Equivoque&quot;.

===&quot;En Electrico&quot; (2009)===
Pichardo had started a solo project entitled Equivocal, with the first single &quot;Dar la Vuelta&quot;. In November 2009 a compilation album entitled &quot;En Electrico&quot; was released. Produced by Armando Avila, featuring notable guests such as Paco Huidobro (Fobia), María José and former fellow frontman/vocalist Juan Carlos Lozano.

===&quot;FM&quot; (2012)===
30 October 2012 saw the release of their seventh studio album &quot;FM&quot;, with their first single &quot;Morir Tres Veces&quot; (Die Thrice). An FM APP was released in December which featured the song &quot;Eso Que Pasó&quot; (That Which Happened). Two other singles from FM include &quot;Mejor Ya No&quot; (Better Not) and &quot;Soy Lo Peor&quot; (I&#x27;m The Worst).

===&quot;Fantom&quot; (2016)===
Released on 23 September 2016, Moenia presents new tracks under producer Armando Ávila. At first many listeners thought the album would be a series of either mashups, covers or samplings, as for the album title itself according to keyboardist Alex Midi, the concept consisted in the combination of original written compositions along with interpolated works of other artists&#x27; songs hence the term &quot;Fantom&quot; was stapled to that of what they consider &#x27;ghostly apparitions&#x27; of one song within another. In the summer of 2015 the single &quot;Jamás! &quot; was the first to be released and found favorable reviews amongst music critics and other media. The track contains interpolated lyrics of Timbiriche&#x27;s 1987 hit &quot;No seas tan cruel&quot;. Other singles such as &quot;Me Liberé&quot; and &quot;Prohibido besar&quot; (which features Playa Limbo vocalist María León) would follow that pattern respectively.

===&quot;Stereo Hits 2&quot; (2023)===
Released on May 4, 2023, Moenia return with a second Stereo Hits compilation album of cover tracks. This album once again features memorable 1980s and 1990s hits such as: &quot;Llámame si me necesitas&quot; (Miguel Mateos / ZAS, 1986), &quot;La célula que explota&quot; (Caifanes, 1990), &quot;El diablo en el cuerpo&quot; (Size, 1984), &quot;A un minuto de ti&quot; (Mikel Erentxun, 1992), &quot;Maldito duende&quot; (Héroes del Silencio, 1990) among others.

<text>In digital recording, an audio or video signal is converted into a stream of discrete numbers representing the changes over time in air pressure for audio, or chroma and luminance values for video. This number stream is saved to a storage device. To play back a digital recording, the numbers are retrieved and converted back into their original analog audio or video forms so that they can be heard or seen.

In a properly matched analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and digital-to-analog converter (DAC) pair, the analog signal is accurately reconstructed, within the constraints of the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem, which dictates the sampling rate and quantization error dependent on the audio or video bit depth. Because the signal is stored digitally, assuming proper error detection and correction, the recording is not degraded by copying, storage or interference.

== Timeline ==
*October 3, 1938: British telephone engineer Alec Harley Reeves files at the French Patent Office the first patent describing the technique known today as pulse-code modulation (PCM). On November 22, 1939, Reeves files also in the US. It was first proposed as a telephony technology.
*1943: Bell Telephone Laboratories develops the first PCM-based digital scrambled speech transmission system, SIGSALY, in response to German interception of military telephone traffic during World War II. The twelve transmission points were retired after the war.
*June 1950: Differential pulse-code modulation (DPCM) developed by C. Chapin Cutler at Bell Labs.
*1957: Max Mathews of Bell Labs recorded the first computer-generated music, a 17-second piece called &quot;The Silver Scale&quot; composed by his co-worker Newman Guttman.
*1967: The first commercial PCM encoder (monaural) was developed by NHK&#x27;s research facilities in Japan. The 30 kHz 12-bit device used a compander (similar to DBX Noise Reduction) to extend the dynamic range, and stored the signals on a video tape recorder.
*1969: NHK expands the PCM encoder&#x27;s capabilities to two-channel stereo and 32 kHz 13-bit resolution.
*1969: The charge-coupled device, the first image sensor used in digital imaging, invented by Willard S. Boyle and George E. Smith at Bell Labs, based on MOS capacitor technology.
*1970: James Russell patents the first digital-to-optical recording and playback system, which would later lead to the Compact Disc.
*January 1971: Using NHK&#x27;s experimental PCM recording system, Dr. Takeaki Anazawa, an engineer at Denon, records the world&#x27;s first commercial digital recordings, &quot;The World Of Stomu Yamash&#x27;ta 1 &amp; 2&quot; by Stomu Yamash&#x27;ta (January 11, 1971) and &quot;Something&quot; by Steve Marcus &amp; Jiro Inagaki (January 25, 1971). Both had to be recorded live, without edits. Marcus is released first (on LP, in February 1972), making it the first released digital recording. On January 27 Yamash&#x27;ta records &quot;Metempsychosis&quot; in the Nippon Columbia studio, Tokyo, with percussion and a brass section.
*1972: Using lessons learned from the NHK encoder, Denon unveils a desk-sized 8-channel PCM encoder, the DN-023R, which uses 47.25 kHz 13-bit PCM resolution and 4-head open reel broadcast video tape recorder. The first recording with this new system is the Smetana Quartet performing Mozart&#x27;s &quot;String Quartets K.458 and K.421&quot;, recorded in Tokyo April 24–26 and released that October. At least six other Denon-recorded digital LP records are released in October, including jazz, classical and traditional Japanese music.
*1973: Adaptive differential pulse-code modulation (ADPCM) developed by P. Cummiskey, Nikil Jayant and James L. Flanagan at Bell Labs.
*December 2–3, 1974: The Paillard Chamber Orchestra records the first digital recording outside Japan, in Paris&#x27; Notre Dame Cathedral, using Denon&#x27;s newly developed second-generation compact DN-023RA. Bach&#x27;s &quot;The Musical Offering&quot; (BWV 1079) is released on LP May 1975.
*December 12–19, 1974: Helmuth Rilling records three Bach organ works inside the Gedächtniskirche, Stuttgart Germany using the DN-023RA. Between 1974 and 1977 over 250 PCM recordings are made by Denon, the majority recorded in Japan.
*May 1975: University of Utah professor Thomas Stockham develops a PCM digital audio recorder of his own design, using computer tape drives as the storage system. He founds the company Soundstream to offer it commercially. Between 1977 and 1980 a total of eighteen 4-channel 50 kHz 16-bit units were manufactured, of which seven were sold at about US$150,000 () each. Over 200 recordings were made on his equipment, almost as many as the Denon PCM.
*1976: The prototype Soundstream 37.5 kHz, 16-bit, 2-channel recorder is used to record the Santa Fe Opera performing Virgil Thomson&#x27;s opera &quot;The Mother of Us All&quot; for New World Records, making it the first US digital recording. However, the digital recorder is just a backup to the main analog multi-track recorder, and the analog recording is deemed superior and thus used for the LP release. The backup digital tape was presented at the October 1976 AES Convention in New York, but never commercially released.
*January 1977: Denon develops a smaller fully-portable PCM recording system, the DN-034R. Like the DN-023R and DN-023RA it records 8 channels at 47.25 kHz on a 2-inch video tape recorder (VTR) running at 38.1 cm/s, but it uses 14-bits &quot;with emphasis, making it equivalent to 15.5 bits,&quot; yielding 89 dB signal-to-noise ratio. It also allowed for overdubbing for the first time with the use of a second VTR, crucial for professional recording.
*September 1977: Sony introduces the PCM-1 Audio Unit ($4400 street price ) (44.056 kHz, 14-bit), the first consumer PCM encoder. It required the use of a home video tape recorder for storage.
*November 4–7, 1977: 3M demonstrates a prototype 2-channel 50.4 kHz 16-bit digital recorder running on 1-inch tape at at the New York AES Convention. As no true 16-bit converters were available, it combined separate 12-bit and 8-bit converters to create 16-bit performance.
*November 28, 1977: Denon brings their DN-034R to New York City&#x27;s Sound Ideas Studios and records Archie Shepp&#x27;s &quot;On Green Dolphin Street&quot;, making it America&#x27;s first digitally-recorded commercial album. The following two days, November 29–30, Frank Foster records &quot;Manhattan Fever&quot; which is released April 1978. Five other jazz albums are recorded with the DN-034R in New York before it returns to Japan in December.
*February 1978: Soundstream&#x27;s first commercial release, &quot;Diahann Carroll With the Duke Ellington Orchestra Under The Direction Of Mercer Ellington – A Tribute To Ethel Waters&quot;, is recorded.
*March 1978: Sony introduces the professional-grade PCM-1600 at a list price of US$40,000 () used with an external U-matic tape drive, making digital recording commercially available to recording studios for the first time. PCM-1610 and PCM-1630 follow.
*April 4–5, 1978: Telarc uses Soundstream&#x27;s PCM system to record Frederick Fennell and his Eastman Wind Ensemble playing Gustav Holst&#x27;s &quot;Suites for Military Band&quot; and George Frideric Handel&#x27;s &quot;Music for the Royal Fireworks.&quot; When released on LP this became the first US-recorded digital classical release.
*June 2, 1978: Sound 80 studios in Minneapolis records the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra performing Aaron Copland&#x27;s &quot;Appalachian Spring&quot;. This session is set up as a direct-to-disc recording, with the prototype 3M 50.4 kHz digital recorder running in the background. There is some disagreement, but it appears the resulting LP record (Sound80 Records S80-DLR-101) was taken from the digital backup tapes rather than the direct-to-disc acetate. In 1984 the session is re-released on Compact Disc by ProArte. This recording was nominated for three Grammy Awards, winning &quot;Best Chamber Music Performance&quot; (1980), making it the first digital recording to win a Grammy.
*Early June 1978: Sound 80 records &quot;Flim and the BB&#x27;s&quot; debut self-titled album as another direct to disc recording again with the experimental 3M recorder in the background. Again the acetate is deemed not as good as the digital backup, so the digital master is used for the LP record (Sound80 Records S80-DLR-102). This makes it the first U.S. non-classical digital release. Within 6 months the hand-built (&quot;very bulky and finicky&quot;) 3M digital recorder is disassembled, rendering the non-standard master tape unplayable. Therefore, no Compact Disc release is possible. The compact disc release of the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra, which used the same machine, is unexplained.
*March 8, 1979: The first prototype Compact Disc player is demonstrated by Philips in Eindhoven, Netherlands. Prototype CDs played on the unit were a pressing of Antonio Vivaldi&#x27;s &quot;Le quattro stagioni&quot; played by Vittorio Negri and the Kammerorchester Berlin (Philips 9500 100, recorded analog 1976), and Joseph Haydn&#x27;s &quot;String Quartet No. 31&quot;(?). A third prototype disc, on Archiv Produktion is pictured but the details are not legible. The text indicates it might be Franz Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Unfinished Symphony&quot;. Herbert von Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic&#x27;s recording of Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Eine Alpensinfonie&quot; is also mentioned as a contender for earliest test pressing of a CD, but it was not recorded until December 1–3, 1980.
*July 11, 1979: The first U.S.-recorded digitally-recorded LP of popular music (with vocals), &quot;Bop Till You Drop&quot; by guitarist Ry Cooder, was released by Warner Bros. Records. The album was recorded in Los Angeles on a 32-track digital machine built by the 3M corporation. 
*August 27, 1979: Giorgio Moroder&#x27;s &quot;E=MC²&quot; is released, the first electronic live-to-digital LP recorded on Soundstream PCM.
*September 4, 1979: Scoring begins for Star Trek The Motion Picture soundtrack, recorded to multitrack analog, mastered to digital stereo tape for LP release to coincide with film debut December 6, 1979.
*October 12, 1979: Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s &quot;Tusk&quot; is released on LP. It, and &quot;Live&quot;, December 8, 1980, were mastered on the Soundstream PCM from analog multi-tracks.
*October 30, 1979: Stevie Wonder releases his soundtrack album, &quot;Journey Through &quot;The Secret Life of Plants&quot;&quot; recorded onto U-matic video tapes using a Sony PCM-1600 digital adapter, and assembled into album form with a digital editing controller.
*December 1, 1979: The Grammy Award-winning self-titled &quot;Christopher Cross&quot; album is released. Cross&#x27; album becomes the first digitally recorded album to chart (recorded on the 3M system) in the United States, eventually winning 5 Grammys. Digital recording is now mainstream.
*1980: The Red Book standard (44.1 kHz, 16-bit) is established for Compact Disc Digital Audio.
*1980: Mitsubishi Electric introduces the X-80 ProDigi open reel 1/4&quot; tape 50.4 kHz 16-bit digital recorder ($5000 ). Only 200 are sold worldwide.
*1980: Soundstream merges with Digital Recording Corporation, becoming DRC/Soundstream, to develop and market 50 kHz PCM recording to an optical card. This is subsequently eclipsed by the rise of the 44.1 kHz Compact Disc and the company is out of business after 1983.
*1981: Sony releases the PCM-F1 Digital Audio Processor ($1900 ) (44.056 kHz, 16-bit) and matching SL-2000 Betamax VCR ($700 ) as a complete affordable portable (with optional batteries) home digital recording system
*1981: Technics releases the SV-P100 digital audio recorder suitable for both professional (digital mastering) and consumer (home use) recording. It used PCM 14-bit recording on a VHS format cassette tape, resulting in an up to 3 hours programme of 2-channel stereo recording.
*1982: Sony releases the PCM-501ES PCM adaptor (44.1 kHz, 16-bit) ($895 list price) which is used with an external VHS or Betamax video recorder.
*August 17, 1982: Claudio Arrau&#x27;s March 1979 analog recording of Frederic Chopin waltzes (Philips 400 025) becomes the first classical Compact Disc ever commercially manufactured. It is made by the Philips plant in Langenhagen, Hanover Region Germany. Arrau himself was invited to press the button to start the manufacture. This CD was not actually released until 1983 so it presumably ran into manufacturing problems like the ABBA release (below).
*August 17, 1982: The first popular Compact Disc ever manufactured, ABBA&#x27;s 1981 album &quot;The Visitors&quot; (selected because it was &quot;mostly digitally recorded&quot;) is produced at the same plant. However, due to production problems with it the third version didn&#x27;t actually hit stores until March 1983.
*September 5, 1982: Peter Gabriel releases his fourth studio album (titled &quot;Security&quot; in North America and &quot;Peter Gabriel IV&quot; elsewhere). When released on CD in October 1984 it becomes the first full-digital DDD release. It was recorded on Sony&#x27;s Mobile One digital studio and mixed to a Sony PCM-1610.
*October 1, 1982: The first compact disc players are marketed by Sony (CDP-101, $900 ) and Philips (CD-100, $700 ).
*October 1, 1982: Billy Joel&#x27;s analog-recorded &quot;52nd Street&quot; becomes the first CD to hit the market in Japan, beating out ABBA&#x27;s &quot;The Visitors&quot; and Claudio Arrau&#x27;s Chopin Waltzes. Forty-nine other CDs are released in Japan on the same day including Toto&#x27;s &quot;Turn Back&quot;, Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; and Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Off the Wall&quot;.
*October 1982: New England Digital offers the Sample-to-Disk hard disk recorder option on the Synclavier, the first commercial hard disk recording system.
*November 26–28, 1982: Flim &amp; the BB&#x27;s record their second studio album, &quot;Tricycle&quot;. Released in early 1983, it becomes the first non-classical fully digital CD to be released. (Later given a SPARS code of DD).
*March 2, 1983: CD players and 16 CDs from CBS Records are introduced in the United States.
*September 1984: Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; becomes the first US-manufactured CD to be released.
*12 November 1984: American singer Madonna&#x27;s second studio album &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; is released. It became the first digitally-recorded album that topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart.
*13 May 1985: English rock band Dire Straits&#x27; fifth studio album &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; is released. It became the best-selling digitally-recorded album of the 80s, and the first album whose CDs&#x27; sales outsold LPs&#x27;.
*1987: Sony develops Digital Audio Tape.
*1989: Test broadcasts for NICAM stereo digital audio for broadcast TV began in the UK.
*1990: Digital radio begins in Canada, using the L-Band.
*1991: Alesis Digital Audio Tape (ADAT) is a tape format used for simultaneously recording eight tracks of digital audio at once, onto Super VHS magnetic tape – a format similar to that used by consumer VCRs. The product was announced in January 1991 at the NAMM Show. The first ADAT recorders shipped over a year later in February or March 1992.
*1993: Random Access Digital Audio Recorder (RADAR) is the first single box device used for simultaneously recording 24 tracks of digital audio at once, onto hard disk drives. The product, manufactured by Creation Technologies was announced in October 1993 at the AES convention in New York. The first RADAR recorders shipped in August 1994.
*1996: Optical discs and DVD players begin selling in Japan.
*1999: Ricky Martin&#x27;s &quot;Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca&quot; becomes the first No. 1 single to be recorded, edited, and mixed fully within a digital audio workstation. Produced by Charles Dye and Desmond Child using Pro Tools.

== Process ==
Recording
# The analog signal is transmitted from the input device to an analog-to-digital converter (ADC).
# The ADC converts this signal by repeatedly measuring the momentary level of the analog (audio) wave and then assigning a binary number with a given quantity of bits (word length) to each measurement point. The longer the word length the more precise the representation of the original audio wave level.
# The frequency at which the ADC measures the level of the analog wave is called the sample rate or sampling rate. The higher the sampling rate the higher the upper audio frequency of the digitized audio signal.
# The ADC outputs a sequence of digital audio samples that make up a continuous stream of 0s and 1s.
# These binary numbers are stored on recording media such as magnetic tape, a hard drive, optical drive or in solid state memory.
Playback
# The sequence of numbers is transmitted from storage into a digital-to-analog converter (DAC)
# The DAC converts the numbers back to an analog signal by sticking together the level information stored in each digital sample, thus rebuilding the original analog waveform.
# This signal is amplified and transmitted to the loudspeakers.

== Recording of bits ==
===Techniques to record to commercial media===
For digital cassettes, the tape head moves as well as the tape, typically in a helical scan configuration, in order to maintain a high enough speed to keep the bits at a manageable size.

For optical disc recording technologies such as CD-R, a laser is used to alter the optical properties of the dye layer of the medium. A weaker laser is used to read these patterns.

== Performance parameters ==
===Word size===
The number of bits used to represent an audio signal directly affects the resulting noise or distortion in a recording.

===Sample rate===
As stated by the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem, to prevent aliasing, the audio signal must be sampled at a rate at least twice that of the highest frequency component in the signal. For music-quality audio, 44.1 and 48 kHz sampling rates are the most common.

Master recording may be done at a higher sampling rate (i.e. 88.2, 96, 176.4 or 192 kHz). High-resolution PCM recordings have been released on DVD-Audio (also known as DVD-A), DualDisc (utilizing the DVD-Audio layer), or High Fidelity Pure Audio on Blu-ray. In addition, it is possible to release a high-resolution recording as either an uncompressed WAV or lossless compressed FLAC file (usually at 24 bits) without down-converting it. There remains controversy about whether higher sampling rates provide any verifiable benefit to the consumer product.

When a Compact Disc (the CD Red Book standard is 44.1 kHz 16 bit) is to be made from a high-res recording, the recording must be down-converted to 44.1 kHz. This is done as part of the mastering process.

Beginning in the 1980s, music that was recorded, mixed or mastered digitally was often labeled using the SPARS code to describe which processes were analog and which were digital. Since digital recording has become near-ubiquitous the SPARS codes are now rarely used.

===Error rectification===
One of the advantages of digital recording over analog recording is its resistance to errors. Once the signal is in the digital format, it is not subject to generation loss from copying. Instead of the gradual degradation experienced with analog media, digital media is subject to a cliff effect.

<text>San Salvador Island, previously Watling&#x27;s Island, is an island and district of the Bahamas, famed for being the probable location of Christopher Columbus&#x27;s first landing of the Americas on 12 October 1492 during his first voyage. This historical importance, the island&#x27;s tropical beaches, and its proximity to the United States have made tourism central to the local economy. The island has a population of 824 and is under the administration of Gilbert C. Kemp. Its largest settlement and seat of local government is Cockburn Town.
==Names==
&quot;Watling&#x27;s Island&quot; was named for George or John Watling, an Englishman who settled it in the 17th century. The name was used officially from the 1680s until 1926. It is still used unofficially in discussions of the actual location of Columbus&#x27;s first landfall.

&quot;San Salvador&quot; derives from the Spanish (&quot;Island of the Holy Savior&quot;), bestowed by Christopher Columbus in honor of Jesus Christ in thanks for his fleet&#x27;s safe arrival in what he thought was East Asia. Columbus recorded the natives&#x27; name for the place as &quot;Guanaham&quot;, now considered to be a mistranscription of Taíno , meaning &quot;Small Land in the Upper Waters&quot;.

== Geography ==

San Salvador Island sits on its own isolated carbonate platform surrounded by a narrow shelf that reaches a depth of up to . Past the shelf, the slope becomes almost vertical and depth quickly increases to . San Salvador Island experiences a semidiurnal tide, with two high tides and two low tides per day. Water temperature in San Salvador can range from depending on the location and time of year. Salinity and dissolved oxygen are consistent throughout the island and throughout the year (35 ppt and 6.0% respectively).

Most of San Salvador Island is surrounded by fringing reefs. In many areas, such as Fernandez Bay, the shore is rocky and populated by reef urchins (&quot;Echinometra viridis&quot;). Moving away from shore, the bottom slopes gradually and may have several patch reefs surrounded by a sandy bottom. These patch reefs are home to hundreds of fish, invertebrates, and algae. The depth continues to increase to about at the farthest edge of the shelf, which can be from shore.

Wind and wave action in San Salvador is influenced by the Antilles Current. The Antilles Current originates south of the Bahamas, Puerto Rico, and Cuba and moves northward where it merges with the Gulf Stream. This current cools the waters around San Salvador in the summer and warms the water around the island in the winter. This keeps the water temperature relatively mild and consistent throughout the year.

The coasts of San Salvador are very different from each other. The west coast of San Salvador faces the rest of the Bahamas and the Great Bahama Bank. Most of these islands are sheltered from significant winds and wave action, making the water generally calmer with greater visibility. In contrast, the eastern coast of San Salvador is windward and completely exposed to the rest of the Atlantic Ocean and is not protected by any other geological formations. 

As a result, wave action is much stronger and visibility is lower. Evidence of currents from the Atlantic Ocean can be found on the east coast in the form of trash and debris on the beaches. During Hurricane Joaquin in October 2015, cargo steamer &quot;El Faro&quot; went down approximately 50 miles east of San Salvador. Several weeks later, pieces of the containers that had been swept away by the current were reported on the beaches of San Salvador.

==History==

===Columbus&#x27;s arrival===

Christopher Columbus&#x27;s voyages west were sponsored by Spain in the hopes that he would reach China and the East Indies, circumventing both Turkish and Portuguese control of the eastern and southern routes of the lucrative spice trade. Letters from Columbus to the Spanish monarchs IsabellaI of Castile and FerdinandII of Aragon record that the first island sighted during his first voyage was known to its Lucayan inhabitants as Guanahaní and that he renamed it San Salvador in thanks to God. 

Arriving on 12 October 1492, he described the Lucayans as &quot;sweet and gentle&quot;, &quot;naked as they were born&quot;, possessed of &quot;neither iron, nor steel, nor arms, nor... competent to use them&quot;, &quot;timid to a surprising degree&quot;, andcombined with the other islands he visitedwould enable to him to deliver to Spain &quot;slaves, as many of these idolators as their Highnesses shall command to be shipped&quot;. Earlier in the same letter, Columbus had explained that the Lucayans were &quot;not&quot; idolators butas chattel slavery had largely disappeared from Europe during the High Middle Ages and Early Renaissanceits revival under Nicholas V&#x27;s 1452 and similar bulls were dependent on the idolatrous status of the enslaved. 

Columbus himself seized several Guanahamians by force to use as translators and ambassadors, despite forcing his crew to stop cheating them in exchanges of random trash for items of great worth, including one who received 12 g of gold for a used leather strap. Despite their general intelligence, the Guanahamian slaves considered him sent from the heavens and secured him welcome at every island he visited.

The location of this first island visited by Columbus is disputed. In the 19th century, it was usually thought to be Cat Island but arguments from Juan Bautista Muñoz; Captain Alexander B. Becher, a hydrographer in the Royal Navy; Rear Adm. Joseph B. Murdock of the U.S. Navy; Richard Henry Major, map custodian of the British Museum; the geographer Clements Markham; the naval historian Samuel E. Morison; and the Benedictine priest Chrysostom Schreiner eventually led to the island&#x27;s 1926 renaming. Fr. Schreiner relocated to San Salvador, where his tomb is still preserved. More recently, the National Geographic Society, Keith Pickering, and others have argued for alternative locations, including Samana Cay.

===Later history===

The island now called San Salvador was settled in the 17th century by the English buccaneer George or John Watling. Britain formally colonized the Bahamas in the early 18th century. 

During the Cold War, the United States Navy&#x27;s Mobile Construction Battalion 7 constructed a long-range navigation (LORAN) station on Grahams Harbor at the north end of the island from 1957 to 1959. After the LORAN station was decommissioned, it became the Bahamian Field Station and then the Gerace Research Center. More than 1,000 students and researchers work from the station every year as a base of operations for studying tropical marine geology, biology, and archeology.

San Salvador has required extensive rebuilding following Hurricane Lili in 1996, Hurricane Floyd in 1999, and Hurricane Joaquin in 2015. Floyd in particular caused considerable beach erosion.

==Tourism==
Tourism is the island&#x27;s main industry, thanks to its historical importance, many sandy beaches, and proximity to the United States. It is served by San Salvador International Airport. Columbus Isle, a Club Med resort, is located just north of the main settlement at Cockburn Town.

The island is home to many shallow-water coral reefs, where snorkellers can observe hundreds of fish species without the use of scuba equipment. The Pleistocene Cockburn Town Fossil Reef is near the main town and resort. Fossilized staghorn coral () and elkhorn coral () are present near the crest of the fossil reef and other corals such as , , and are scattered in the periphery. San Salvador is also known for the quick dropoff of the submerged platform of the island, allowing for numerous deep dive sites. The western coast has many wall reefs with steep drop offs, while the northern coast has many shallow barrier reefs, particularly surrounding the large shallow lagoon of Grahams Harbor.

There are three endemic fish species found only in the inland hypersaline lakes on this island. The scale-eating pupfish (Cyprinodon desquamator), the molluscivore pupfish (Cyprinodon brontotheroides), and the widemouth pupfish (Cyprinodon sp. widemouth) are all endemic to this island (Martin and Wainwright 2011, 2013, Richards et al. 2021). 

The Dixon Hill lighthouse is located on the island south of Dixon Hill Settlement on the east side of the island. It is approximately tall and was constructed in 1887 by the Imperial Lighthouse Service. 

There are also several monuments, ruins, and shipwrecks in the area.

==Government==
The seat of local government is Cockburn Town, with a population of 271 . The current administrator is Gilbert C. Kemp.

<doc id="673961" wikidata="Q6969929" url="?curid=673961" title="Nathaniel William Taylor">
<text>Nathaniel William Taylor (June 23, 1786 – March 10, 1858) was an influential Protestant Theologian of the early 19th century, whose major contribution to the Christian faith (and to American religious history), known as the [[New Haven theology]] or Taylorism, was to line up historical Calvinism with the religious revivalism of the time (The Second Great Awakening). A graduate of Yale College, he returned to found the school&#x27;s first independent division, the Theological Department, an institution which later became the Yale Divinity School.

==Biography==
Born in 1786 to a rich and religious family in Connecticut, Taylor entered Yale College when only 14 (1800) but could not graduate until 1807 because of an eye problem. He was a son of Nathaniel and Anna (née Northrup) Taylor. While studying there, Taylor was heavily influenced by the revivalist president of Yale, Timothy Dwight (grandson of Jonathan Edwards). In the years after his graduation, Taylor studied theology, worked as Dwight&#x27;s secretary, and, after ordination, became the minister of the First Church of New Haven in 1812.

==Family==
==Influence on Calvinist theology during the Second Great Awakening==
While Taylor himself was not an evangelist, his sympathy for revivalism during a time when revivals were breaking out ensured that he had a major influence upon the core beliefs of revivalists and the churches that were created from them.

The Second Great Awakening, despite its scope and power, was opposed by the more established church, especially Episcopalians and &quot;Old Calvinists&quot;, but also the growing Unitarian movement. After Taylor had been appointed Professor of Didactic Theology at Yale in 1822, he used his influence to publicly support the revivalist movement and defend its beliefs and practices against opponents.

===Influence on Calvinistic doctrines===
From his position at Yale, Taylor repudiated Calvinistic Determinism - the idea that the works of God alone are responsible for all activities in the universe. He did this to preserve the ideal of human freedom, mainly because he believed that determinism contradicted freedom and was thus immoral. Since God could not be immoral, then Determinism could not be possible for a loving, perfect Deity.

The repudiation of determinism was followed by further changes to Calvinistic doctrines such as Revelation, Human Depravity, God&#x27;s Sovereignty, Christ&#x27;s Atonement and Regeneration. Both Taylor and Dwight are credited with the creation of &quot;New Haven Theology&quot;, which appealed to both Congregationalists and New School Presbyterians and who found traditional Calvinism difficult to embrace.

Naturally, both Taylor and New Haven Theology were vigorously opposed by Old Calvinists, especially Charles Hodge from Princeton Seminary. Taylor&#x27;s modification of Calvinism not only drew their ire, but prompted many of them to declare that Taylor&#x27;s system was not Calvinism at all, but Arminian and even Pelagian.

===Influence on Charles Finney===
Taylor&#x27;s influence is important when examining the ministry of Charles Grandison Finney, arguably, the best known evangelist during the Second Great Awakening. While it would certainly not be accurate to say that &quot;Taylor&#x27;s theology was preached in Finney&#x27;s ministry&quot;, both men came to prominence at about the same time and a comparison of the written works of both men shows much in common, especially in the areas that differed with &quot;Old Calvinism&quot;. Much of Taylor&#x27;s theology (described below) is similar to that preached by Finney.

Taylor, however, was never a proponent of &quot;perfectionism&quot; - the belief that it was possible (and therefore desirable) for Christians to live a sinless and obedient life. While Finney&#x27;s influence in revivalism was important, it was Taylor and the New Haven theology that prevailed in New England churches.

===A Summary of Taylor&#x27;s Theology===
Original Sin: All men are lost but Adam&#x27;s sin was not imputed to anyone, nor is depravity defined by a physical flaw within human nature. Although a person will sin with certainty, sin is the act of free choice. A sinner is therefore morally responsible for their own sin rather than being physically enslaved by the sin of Adam.

God&#x27;s Sovereignty: God does not determine the destiny of all men through election, nor does he determine the events of our world. Instead he has created a moral universe and will judge its inhabitants. &quot;God promotes moral action by a system of means and ends in which man can respond to ethical appeals for repentance.&quot; (Hoffecker)

The Atonement: Taylor repudiated the view that Christ died upon the cross as a direct sin sacrifice for the sins of Christians. Instead, he taught that Christ&#x27;s death is the means by which God can urge sinners to freely turn from their sin and be converted, especially when presented with the benefits and privileges that a godly life can bestow upon them.

A note on &quot;Self Love&quot; - the term used by Taylor to denote a natural part of man&#x27;s being, whereby a person has a natural desire for happiness that motivates all choices and which will manifest itself in Godly repentance when given the opportunity. This is based on the belief that the Christian life, if understood, would be so attractive, wonderful and beneficial for the person that his or her natural inclination would be to convert, something within his or her power to do according to this theology.

===&quot;Old Calvinist&quot; objections to Taylor&#x27;s teachings===
Hodge and others felt that Taylor&#x27;s teachings were so seriously wrong that they were not so much Arminian, but Pelagian in character. In practical terms, traditional Calvinists have not only rejected Taylor&#x27;s teachings as erroneous, but also heretical. Even today, many Calvinists, when confronted with Taylor&#x27;s teachings, will conclude that he had departed from the true Christian faith. Those who held to Taylor&#x27;s beliefs, including, most notably, Charles Finney, were similarly heterodox.

Taylor&#x27;s New England Theology was put on trial in Albert Barnes and Lyman Beecher, who were both accused of heresy by Old School Calvinists. Albert Barnes was acquitted of heresy charges and found orthodox by the Synod of Philadelphia. Lyman Beecher was acquitted of heresy charges and found orthodox by the Synod of Cincinnati. Thus, Taylor&#x27;s New Haven Theology, New School Theology, or New Divinity was declared an orthodox Christian theology.

At the heart of this objection is Taylor&#x27;s view of the atonement. Many Christians believe that Christ&#x27;s death upon the cross was as a sin-substitute, whereby the sins of mankind were imputed to Christ, who was punished for our sins in our place. Martin Luther went as far as to say that Christ became the worst sinner in the universe. Christ&#x27;s righteousness, or his perfection, was then imputed to all believers. Consequently, God no longer sees believers as they really are but is blinded by imputed righteousness. For many Christians, this belief is the cornerstone of the Christian faith. Yet Taylor explicitly denied this view.

===Taylorism versus Tylerism===
Within the Congregational church at the time, a theological split occurred between those who advocated New Haven theology and those who adhered to more conservative beliefs. Bennet Tyler led this split against Taylor and set up The East Windsor Theological Seminary in opposition to the New Haven theology espoused by Taylor at Yale. Though less in disagreement with the teachings of Samuel Hopkins, Tylerism was vigorously opposed to what were perceived to be serious errors in New Haven thinking.

At the time, such objections to Taylor&#x27;s theology were considered an attack upon a part of the revivalist movement. Thus the &quot;enemy&quot; of revivalism was understood to be the established churches, especially those that embraced and taught strict Calvinism. It was perhaps this situation that led to many revivalist movements (and later Fundamentalist and Evangelical movements) being separated from confessional and Calvinist churches—thus solidifying Arminian belief.

===Taylor and the decline of New England Congregationalism===
It has been argued by Angus Steward that the New Haven theology advocated by Taylor (and others) led to the New England Congregational churches being more open and amenable to the theological liberalism that influenced many mainline denominations in the late 19th century, an influence that is still being felt today.

While this may seem a harsh judgment—especially considering Taylor&#x27;s support of revivalism and the ensuing &quot;conversion&quot; experience that accompanies it—Steward maintains that Taylor and other proponents of New Haven theology deliberately abandoned teachings that were, up to that time, considered an essential part of traditional Calvinist Theology; by questioning and abandoning these beliefs, a historical precedent was made which allowed future generations to be more influenced by teachings which went further in denying other Calvinist teachings.

As mainline Protestant denominations that have been historically dominated by Liberal Christianity have declined in number and influence over time, Steward holds that New England Congregationalism suffered the same fate: Influenced by Taylor&#x27;s rejection of &quot;Old Calvinism&quot; and embracing Liberal theology, with, unlike in the Southern Baptist Convention, no Fundamentalist reaction, one of America&#x27;s most historically significant church groups is thus no longer a dominant force in American Christianity.

<doc id="673964" wikidata="Q116113" url="?curid=673964" title="Jim Gordon (character)">
<text>James W. &quot;Jim&quot; Gordon Sr. is a character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, most commonly in association with the superhero Batman. Created by Bill Finger and Bob Kane as an ally of Batman, the character debuted in the first panel of &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #27 (May 1939), Batman&#x27;s first appearance, making him the first Batman supporting character ever to be introduced.

As the police commissioner of Gotham City, Gordon shares Batman&#x27;s deep commitment to ridding the city of crime. The character is typically portrayed as having full trust in Batman and is even somewhat dependent on him. In many modern stories, he is somewhat skeptical of Batman&#x27;s vigilante methods, but nevertheless believes that Gotham needs him. The two have a mutual respect and tacit friendship. Gordon is the father or adoptive father (depending on the continuity) of Barbara Gordon, the second Batgirl and the information broker Oracle. Jim Gordon also has a biological son, James Gordon Jr., a psychopathic serial killer who first appeared in &quot;&quot; (as an infant).

One of Batman&#x27;s most notable and enduring allies, Gordon has appeared in various forms of non-comics media; he has been voiced in animation and video games by Bob Hastings, Bryan Cranston, Jonathan Banks, and Christopher Meloni among others, and has been portrayed in live-action by Lyle Talbot in the &quot;Batman and Robin&quot; 1949 serial, Neil Hamilton in the 1960s &quot;Batman&quot; show and film, Pat Hingle in the Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher &quot;Batman&quot; film series, Gary Oldman in &quot;The Dark Knight Trilogy&quot;, Ben McKenzie in &quot;Gotham&quot;, J. K. Simmons in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) film &quot;Justice League&quot; and its director&#x27;s cut, and Jeffrey Wright in &quot;The Batman&quot;. In 2011, Jim Gordon was ranked 19th in IGN&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 Comic Book Heroes&quot;.

==Publication history==
Created by Bill Finger and Bob Kane, Gordon debuted in the first panel of &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #27 (May 1939), in which he is referred to simply as Commissioner Gordon. The character&#x27;s name was taken from the earlier pulp character Commissioner James W. &quot;Wildcat&quot; Gordon, also known as &quot;The Whisperer&quot;, created in 1936 by Henry Ralston, John Nanovic, and Lawrence Donovan for Street &amp; Smith.

==Fictional character biography==
Of Scottish descent, Gordon had served in the United States Marine Corps prior to becoming a police officer. In most versions of the &quot;Batman&quot; mythos, Jim Gordon is at one point or another depicted as commissioner of the Gotham City Police Department. Gordon frequently contacts Batman for help in solving various crimes, particularly those committed by supervillains. Generally it is Gordon who uses the Bat-signal to summon Batman, and it has become a running joke of sorts that Batman will often disappear in the middle of the discussion when Gordon&#x27;s back is turned. Gordon is usually depicted as Caucasian with silver or red hair, eyeglasses, and a mustache. In most incarnations, he is seen wearing a trenchcoat, necktie, and on occasion, a fedora hat. He is also sometimes pictured with a cane, although it is not revealed why he uses it. Because DC Comics retconned its characters&#x27; history in the 1985 miniseries &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, and because of different interpretations in television and film, the details of Gordon&#x27;s history vary from story to story.

He has been married twice; first to Barbara Eileen Kean and then to Sarah Essen.

===Early characterizations===
In the original pre-Crisis version of his history, Gordon is a police detective who initially resents the mysterious vigilante&#x27;s interference in police business. He first appears in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #27, in the very first Batman story, in which they both investigate the murder of a chemical industrialist. Although Batman fights on the side of justice, his methods and phenomenal track record for stopping crimes and capturing criminals embarrasses the police by comparison. Eventually, Batman meets up with Gordon and persuades the detective that they need each other&#x27;s help. Gordon deputizes Batman, and thereafter the Dark Knight works with Gordon as an agent of the law.

In &quot;Batman Special&quot; #1, it is revealed that Gordon, as a young cop, shot and killed two robbers in self-defense in front of their son. The results of this event would lead the boy to become the first Wrath, a cop killer with a costume and motif inspired by Batman, who would come after Gordon for revenge years later.

===Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; and &quot;Zero Hour&quot;===

====&quot;Batman: Year One&quot;====

The post-Crisis version of the character was introduced in the 1987 storyline &quot;&quot;, written by Frank Miller. In this version, James W. Gordon is transferred back to Gotham City after spending more than 15 years in Chicago. A man of integrity, Gordon finds that Batman is his only ally against the corrupt administration, which is in the pocket of mob boss Carmine Falcone. One of the most significant differences in this version is that Batman is never deputized and Gordon&#x27;s relationship with him is kept out of the public eye whenever possible. It is also added that he is a special forces veteran who is capable in hand-to-hand combat; he retaliates against an intimidation attempt by corrupt fellow officers with equal violence. He is depicted as having an extra-marital affair with a fellow detective, Sarah Essen. Gordon breaks off their affair after being blackmailed by the corrupt police commissioner, Gillian B. Loeb. Falcone sends his nephew, Johnny Viti, to kill Gordon&#x27;s wife and son; Batman saves them, however, and helps Gordon expose Loeb&#x27;s corruption. After Loeb resigns, Gordon is promoted to captain.

The 1998 miniseries &quot;Gordon of Gotham&quot; takes place nearly 20 years prior to the current events of the DC Universe and two months before his arrival in Gotham in &quot;Batman: Year One&quot;. It reveals that Gordon, during his tenure in Chicago, struggled with his wife over conceiving a child while taking night classes in criminology. He becomes a minor celebrity after a foiling a late-night robbery attempt. When he decides to investigate a corrupt fellow officer, however, the officer and his cronies assault him, and the police department discredits him in order to cover up the scandal. Gordon then uncovers evidence of rigging in the city council election and brings down two of his fellow officers, which leads to his commander transferring him to Gotham.

The story &quot;Wrath Child&quot;, published in &quot;Batman Confidential&quot; issues 13–16, retcons Gordon&#x27;s origin yet again: in this continuity, Gordon started his career in Gotham, but transferred to Chicago after shooting a corrupt cop and his wife (the parents of the original Wrath). The transfer was arranged by Loeb, then a captain, in an attempt to keep himself and his fellow corrupt cops from being exposed. Loeb threatens the future Wrath&#x27;s life in order to force Gordon to comply with the transfer. Gordon later transfers back to Gotham around the same time Batman starts his career.

While still a lieutenant, Gordon convinces Loeb&#x27;s successor to implement the Bat-Signal as a means to contact Batman and also to frighten criminals. It is around this time that the first Robin, Dick Grayson, becomes Batman&#x27;s sidekick. Gordon initially disapproves of Batman recruiting a child to fight dangerous criminals, but soon grows to not only accept the boy but trust him as much as he does Batman.

Gordon quickly rises to the rank of commissioner after he and Batman weed out corruption within the department. After the death of his brother and sister-in-law, he adopts his niece, Barbara. Soon after he adopts Barbara, he divorces his wife, who returned to Chicago with their son James Jr., while he retains custody of Barbara, who eventually becomes Batgirl. Gordon quickly deduces the heroine&#x27;s true identity, and attempts to confront her about it, going so far as to search her bedroom for proof. However, he was semi-tricked out of this belief, when Batman (after sanctioning Batgirl officially) had Robin dress up as Batgirl while Barbara is on the roof with her father. Gordon would continue to believe his daughter is indeed Batgirl, but would not confront her about it again, until years later.

====&quot;Batman: The Killing Joke&quot;====
In the 1988 graphic novel &quot;&quot;, the Joker kidnaps Gordon after shooting and paralyzing Barbara. He then cages Gordon in the freak show of an abandoned amusement park and forces him to look at enlarged photos of his wounded daughter in an effort to drive him insane, thus proving to Batman that even seemingly normal people can lose their minds after having &quot;one bad day&quot;. Batman eventually apprehends the Joker and rescues Gordon. Despite the intense trauma he has endured, Gordon&#x27;s sanity and ethical code are intact; he insists that Batman apprehend the Joker without harming him in order to &quot;show him that our way works&quot;.

====Marriage====
Soon after Sarah Essen returns to Gordon&#x27;s life, they rekindle their romance and get engaged. However, Essen cannot comprehend why Gordon needs Batman so much, which occasionally puts a strain on their relationship. Later, Gordon suffers a heart attack; his chain-smoking over the years has weakened his heart. This event later lead DC Comics to partner with the American Heart Association to create a public service announcement to raise awareness of the danger of tobacco smoking and how it would threaten one&#x27;s health.

In &quot;&quot; Annual #2, shortly before their planned wedding, former Lieutenant Arnold Flass (Gordon&#x27;s former partner) beats Gordon and kidnaps James Jr. for ransom in exchange for letting a corrupt judge go free. Batman saves James Jr., while Gordon, Essen, Flass and the judge are trapped and must work together to escape.

For a brief period following the &quot;&quot; and &quot;Prodigal&quot; storylines, Gordon is removed from his post as commissioner and replaced by his own wife, due partly to his own disinclination to trust Batman after two substitutes — Jean-Paul Valley and Dick Grayson — assume the role and do not bother to tell him about the switch.

====&quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;====
The &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; storyline takes place after Gotham is destroyed by an earthquake and isolated from outside assistance. Inside Gotham, Gordon struggles to maintain order in the midst of a crime wave. Batman is mysteriously absent for the initial three months, and Gordon feels betrayed. He forges an uneasy alliance with Two-Face, but the partnership does not last; Two-Face kidnaps Gordon, putting him on trial for breaking their &quot;legally binding&quot; alliance. Gordon escapes, however, and later meets with Batman once again. In this confrontation, Gordon berates Batman for letting Gotham &quot;fall into ruin&quot;. Batman offers to prove his trust by revealing his secret identity, but Gordon refuses to look when Batman removes his mask. Eventually, the two repair their friendship.

At the end of the &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; storyline, the Joker kills Sarah Essen-Gordon. An enraged Gordon barely restrains himself from killing Joker, shooting the madman in the knee instead. Not long afterward, Gordon is shot by a criminal seeking revenge for a previous arrest. Though seriously injured, he survives, and eventually makes a full recovery.

====Retirement====
Gordon retires from the police force after having served for more than 20 years. He remains in Gotham, and occasionally enjoys nighttime visits from Batman. Despite being retired, Gordon often finds himself drawn to a series of life-and-death circumstances, such as the Joker sending him flowers during &quot;Last Laugh&quot;, or being contacted by the temporarily reformed Harvey Dent to stop Batman from killing the Joker, to being kidnapped by Francis Sullivan, grandson of one of Gotham&#x27;s notorious serial killers, during the &quot;Made of Wood&quot; storyline. After the attack by Sullivan, Batman gives Gordon an encrypted cellphone, the so-called Batphone, in case he needs to contact him, which also carries a transmitter in case of trouble. He also still has contacts with the country&#x27;s law enforcement agencies, through which the sheriff&#x27;s departments request Gordon to contact Batman for help investigating a series of unusual murders on a suburb territory outside the city&#x27;s limits; it turns out to be a paranormal case involving black magic, occult rituals, and the supernatural. Commissioner Michael Akins has taken his position, with many officers expressing reluctance to follow him out of loyalty to Gordon.

After Barbara requires surgery to counter the life-threatening effects of the Brainiac virus, Gordon visits her in Metropolis. She reveals to him her current role as Oracle, as well as her past as Batgirl. Gordon admits that he knew of her life as Batgirl, but is pleasantly surprised to know of her second career as Oracle.

====Return====
As part of DC&#x27;s &quot;One Year Later&quot;, Gordon has once again become Gotham&#x27;s police commissioner. He rebuilds the Bat-Signal, but still carries the mobile Batphone that Batman gave him. The circumstances behind this are currently unknown, though there have been allusions to extreme corruption within the GCPD. These allusions are supported by events within &quot;Gotham Central&quot;, especially involving Detective Jim Corrigan. Gordon survives an attempt on his life by the Joker (&quot;Batman&quot; #655), who had drugged him with Joker Venom in an attack on the GCPD. He is taken to the hospital in time.

====&quot;Blackest Night&quot;====
During the &quot;Blackest Night&quot; crossover, while mourning the passing of the original Batman, who was apparently killed in action during &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, Gordon and his daughter witness Green Lantern crash into the Bat-Signal, after being assaulted by a reanimated version of the deceased Martian Manhunter. After offering the hero a spare car, the Gordons then find themselves fighting for their lives against the reanimated versions of the original Batman&#x27;s rogues gallery at Gotham Central, where Gordon makes short work of serial killer Abattoir (in Black Lantern form) with a shotgun. They are rescued by the current Batman, Robin, Red Robin, and Deadman, but are later attacked by Batman and Red Robin&#x27;s parents, the reanimated Graysons and the Drakes. While Batman and Red Robin battle the Black Lanterns, Robin takes the Gordons to their underground base. It is later shown that Alfred Pennyworth tends his wounds (Gordon is unconscious, thus protecting the team&#x27;s secret identities) along with Barbara&#x27;s at the bunker&#x27;s infirmary.

===The New 52===
In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC&#x27;s continuity. In this new timeline, Jim Gordon is still the commissioner of the GCPD and a former Marine but is younger than his traditional portrayal; he still has the red hair and mustache from &quot;Batman: Year One&quot;. He is still married to his wife Barbara, and he and Barbara are the biological parents of Barbara &quot;Babs&quot; Gordon (a.k.a. Batgirl).

During the &quot;Forever Evil&quot; storyline, commissioner Gordon enters Blackgate Penitentiary in order to save the warden. When a turf war erupts between the Arkham inmates, Gordon helps to evacuate the citizens from Gotham City.

In &quot;Batman Eternal&quot;, the storyline begins when Gordon is tricked into shooting at an unarmed suspect in an underground train station, resulting in a train derailing and Gordon being arrested. While incarcerated, Gordon is visited by his son, who makes arrangements to leave his father&#x27;s cell open and provide him with an opportunity to escape Blackgate, believing that his father&#x27;s actions are the result of him at least subconsciously acknowledging the &#x27;truth&#x27; that Gotham is beyond saving and his attempts to be a hero are pointless. However, despite his doubts, Gordon decides to remain in prison, concluding that Gotham is still worth saving and simply musing that he may just be getting old and made a mistake. Although villains such as the Penguin attempt to attack Gordon while in prison, Gordon uses Batman&#x27;s example to inspire fear in his &#x27;fellow inmates&#x27; with minimal effort until he is released as the final assault on Gotham begins, proceeding to rally all of Gotham to stand up and take back their city to aid Batman for everything he has ever done for them.

===Batman===
Following Bruce Wayne&#x27;s apparent death in battle with the Joker during the events of &quot;Batman&quot; (vol. 2) #40, Gordon took up the mantle of Batman using a mecha-style suit to fight crime in Gotham City. Gordon first appears as Batman in &quot;Divergence&quot; #1, a DC Comics 2015 Free Comic Book Day issue, in which he is shown to be sponsored by the mega-corporation Powers International. He also notes that this is &quot;the worst idea in the history of Gotham&quot;, as he suits up, but agreed to the offer when various sources argued that there was nobody else capable of understanding Gotham the way Batman had done over the years, Gordon contemplating the merits of a Batman who works with the system rather than outside it. However, he begins to recognize the problems of this approach when he discovers that some of his past arrests have been murdered while out on parole and he is forbidden from investigating the crime himself. Gordon later meets the currently-depowered Superman when Clark comes to Gotham to investigate evidence that the weapons currently being used against him were created in Gotham, but their initial meeting results in a fight as Superman doesn&#x27;t believe that Gordon is the new Batman and Gordon doubts Superman due to him currently working with Luthor. Although Gordon doubts Superman&#x27;s abilities as a hero due to his current powerless state, he eventually works with Superman to stop Vandal Savage stealing an artificial sun created in Gotham to use as part of his latest plan, their alliance helping Gordon recognize Superman&#x27;s continued merits as a hero while Superman in turn acknowledges that the new Batman gets the job done. Gordon later works with the Justice League to investigate the death of a large monster, the heroes noting after the case has concluded that Batman&#x27;s high opinion of Gordon&#x27;s abilities as a detective were well-founded. Despite Gordon&#x27;s best efforts, political issues in the department result in new villain Mr. Bloom destroying his armor and mounting a massive assault on Gotham after seriously injuring Gordon, prompting the amnesic Bruce Wayne — ironically inspired by a conversation with the equally — amnesiac Joker — to try and reclaim his role as Batman. The crisis concludes with Bloom defeated by the returned Batman using some of Gordon&#x27;s equipment while working with his old ally. The return of the true Batman prompts the GCPD to shut down the program and restore Gordon to his role as commissioner, Gordon musing that the world needs Batman to face its nightmares so that normal human beings can learn to cope with the more regular problems.

===DC Rebirth===

In June 2016, the &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; event relaunched DC Comics&#x27; entire line of comic book titles, in which Jim Gordon has a continued role in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; and the third volume of &quot;Batman&quot;. In December 2017, DC Comics ended the &quot;Rebirth&quot; branding, opting to include everything under a larger &quot;DC Universe&quot; banner and naming, and Gordon continues to be featured in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; and the third volume of &quot;Batman&quot;. For a time Gordon is corrupted by the toxin used by The Batman Who Laughs, an alternate version of Batman contaminated by the chemicals that drove the Joker insane, but Batman is able to get help from Superman in capturing Gordon and the other infected heroes until a cure can be found.

In 2021, DC began publishing a new &quot;Joker&quot; series. The first story arc (at least through the first six issues) is told primarily from Gordon&#x27;s perspective. He has retired from public service and agrees to look for Joker on behalf of a secretive organization. His daughter Barbara provides intelligence and communications support.

==Gordon and Batman&#x27;s identity==
In most versions of the mythos, Gordon is ignorant of Batman&#x27;s identity. There is usually the implication that Gordon is intelligent enough to solve the mystery, but chooses not to in order to preserve Batman&#x27;s effectiveness and maintain his own plausible deniability. In the 1966 &quot;Batman&quot; film, Gordon explicitly states his desire not to know for just such a reason.

In the pre-Crisis era, a 1952 story (Batman #71) shows Gordon trying to uncover Batman&#x27;s identity merely for his own satisfaction, but Batman discovers Gordon&#x27;s scheme and skillfully outwits him. A later story in the 1960s shows Gordon giving a bedridden Bruce Wayne (who had contracted a nearly fatal fever as Batman) &quot;Chinese oranges&quot;, a natural treatment for the fever. Later, Bruce opines to Dick Grayson if it is possible that Gordon is beginning to suspect Batman&#x27;s identity.

In &quot;&quot;, Gordon claims not to see the unmasked Batman well (whom his wife at that time, Barbara, also sees) because he wasn&#x27;t wearing his eyeglasses. Gordon suspects that Bruce Wayne may be Batman, though he never follows up on his suspicions. In &quot;&quot;, Gordon has implied he deliberately avoids deep investigation on the subject of Batman or Batgirl&#x27;s identity.

Likewise, in the 1980s &quot;Detective Comics&quot; storyline &quot;Blind Justice&quot;, the world at large incorrectly supposes Batman is dead and Gordon comments to Bruce Wayne that Batman has earned the right to retirement if he so desires. He then rather pointedly asks Bruce&#x27;s advice on whether or not he should reveal that Batman still lives.

When Hugo Strange attempted to determine Batman&#x27;s identity early in his career (in a story written in the post-&quot;Crisis&quot; era), he began his research by focusing on muggings and murders committed in the last few years based on the idea that Batman was prompted into his current role by a traumatic loss as a result of criminal activity, prompting Gordon – upon learning of Strange&#x27;s research – to reflect that Strange had already made a mistake as he was underestimating the physical demands that would be required for Batman to have reached his current level of skill by looking at crimes committed such a short time ago, suggesting that Gordon had already considered such an avenue of investigation (even if he may or may not have followed it up). A chronologically later storyline involving Strange pre-Crisis involved Alfred being hospitalized as part of Strange&#x27;s scheme, and during a conversation between Gordon and Batman over the phone after Strange&#x27;s defeat, Gordon pointedly tells Batman to inform an unnamed &#x27;mutual acquaintance&#x27; that Gordon has checked on the acquaintance&#x27;s friend in the hospital and the doctors expect a full recovery.

During &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;, Batman attempts to regain Gordon&#x27;s trust by revealing his identity. Gordon refuses to look at him after he removes the cowl, however, stating that if he wanted to know Batman&#x27;s identity, he could have figured it out years ago, and even cryptically saying, &quot;And for all you know, maybe I did.&quot;

During the &quot;Hush&quot; story arc, while working with Superman, Batman discusses whether or not Perry White has figured out Superman&#x27;s secret identity. Theorizing that White is too good a reporter to not have figured it out, he draws the same comparison to himself and Gordon, stating that Gordon is too good a detective to not have figured it out. In that same story arc, Gordon, in an attempt to stop Batman from killing the Joker, tells Batman to remember who his role models are (his parents) and the beliefs they instilled in him. As well, he asks Batman to remember who and what made him who he is, a rather obvious reference to the criminal who gunned down his parents in front of him, suggesting that Gordon knows that Bruce Wayne is Batman.

Barbara reveals her identities to her father in &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; #89. Gordon then reveals that he was well aware of her status as Batgirl all along, though he purposefully avoided looking into what she was doing after she was paralyzed. Batman chides her for revealing herself, saying it was a mistake, but she counters that, while he taught her to fight criminals, it was her father who taught her to be human.

In &quot;Blackest Night: Batman&quot;, Gordon is present when Deadman refers to the current Batman as &quot;Grayson&quot; and after the current Robin took Gordon and his daughter to the new Batman&#x27;s underground base. It is implied that Gordon is unconscious when they meet Alfred Pennyworth.

At the conclusion of &quot;Batman: The Black Mirror&quot;, Gordon strongly implies to Dick Grayson that he is aware of the secret identities of Grayson and the Waynes, when he thanks Grayson for everything he had done for him over the course of the story. Grayson attempts to brush this off, thinking Gordon meant only the forensic assistance he had given, from which Gordon cuts him off, saying &quot;I mean, thank you. On all fronts.&quot; A long moment of silence follows, and Grayson accepts his thanks.

During Gordon&#x27;s brief career as Batman when Bruce was suffering total amnesia after his temporary death in his last fight with the Joker, Gordon meets with Bruce Wayne and introduces himself as Batman, noting how strange it is to be saying that to Bruce, but his response could suggest that he considers it strange based on the public perception that Bruce Wayne was Batman&#x27;s financial backer rather than making it clear that he knows who Bruce was. After Bruce is forced to sacrifice his new persona to download his old memories as Batman into his mind to save Gotham from new villain Mr. Bloom, Gordon apologizes for making Batman come back, noting that his friend was at peace while he was away, and starts to call him &#x27;B...&#x27; before stopping himself, but Batman ignores the near-name in favor of assuring Gordon that the man he might have been without Batman died long ago.

===Knowledge in other continuities===
In Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;, Gordon and Bruce Wayne are portrayed as close friends in their civilian identities, with Gordon having discovered Batman&#x27;s identity years before around the time of Bruce&#x27;s retirement in his mid-forties (Bruce is explicitly identified as being 55 at the time of the story).

In the &quot;&quot; storyline, which takes place in 2039, Captain Jim Gordon, grandson of commissioner Gordon, finds an old laptop in the attic of a country home owned by Gordon and discovers a secret file which he assumes contains long-lost information on Batman. After unsuccessfully trying numerous passwords with relevance to the Batman universe he inputs &quot;Bruce Wayne&quot; and is granted access to the file contents.

In the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; universe, Gordon knows about Thomas Wayne&#x27;s identity as Batman and works with him in both his identities.

In the &quot;Batman - Vampire&quot; trilogy in the Elseworlds series, Gordon is shown to be aware of Batman&#x27;s connection to Alfred Pennyworth by the second graphic novel in the trilogy, working with Alfred as Batman succumbs to his new, darker nature, but his knowledge of Batman&#x27;s identity as Bruce Wayne is virtually irrelevant as Batman had abandoned his life as Bruce Wayne after he was transformed into a full vampire while fighting Dracula.

As in most continuities, Gordon decides in the Christopher Nolan trilogy that he prefers to remain ignorant of Batman&#x27;s identity and agrees that his anonymity – even in death – has sociological value. Immediately prior to Batman&#x27;s apparent self-sacrifice near the end of &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;, Gordon learns the truth when Batman makes a reference to Gordon&#x27;s kindness to him as a child. Following Batman&#x27;s apparent death in a nuclear detonation, Gordon attends Wayne&#x27;s empty-casket burial with Blake and Wayne&#x27;s/Batman&#x27;s confidants, Alfred Pennyworth and Lucius Fox.

In Sean Murphy&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, the Joker – now known as Jack Napier – is cured of his mental illness and legally prosecutes Gordon and the GCPD, holding them accountable for cooperating with Batman for decades. As a member of the city council, Napier suggests redirecting funds dedicated to repairing damages to the city caused by Batman to the GCPD and argues that Batman should have shared his technology with the GCPD long ago. Napier&#x27;s arguments cause a rift between Gordon and Batman, ending with Batman unmasking himself to Gordon in order to regain his trust. Initially, Gordon discourages Batman from revealing his secret identity to the public, but in the sequel, &quot;&quot;, Gordon changes his mind when the Joker publicly reveals Batgirl&#x27;s secret identity, believing that this would not have happened if Batman had publicly unmasked. Even though Gordon expresses regret over blaming Batman for the Joker&#x27;s actions, they never get a chance to reconcile as Gordon is murdered shortly thereafter by Azrael.

==Family==
===Pre-Crisis===

====Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; Gordon====
In Pre-Crisis continuity, Jim Gordon is the biological father of Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; Gordon. Originally referred to as a college student, Tony later disappears while hiding from Communist spies. He is later reunited with his sister, Barbara, and dies in a battle with the Sino-Supermen (&quot;Batman Family&quot; #12, &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #482). In Post-Crisis continuity, there has been no mention of Tony Gordon.

====Barbara &quot;Barb&quot; Gordon====

Barbara &quot;Barb&quot; Gordon is the biological daughter of James &quot;Jim&quot; Gordon in Pre-Crisis continuity. She also leads a double life as a librarian and as costumed crimefighter Batgirl. Barbara is also the link of the DC Universe Oracle. Her father is aware of her crime-fighting career and is proud of her for it.

===Post-Crisis===

====Barbara Eileen Kean====

Barbara Eileen Kean is Gordon&#x27;s ex-wife and Barbara&#x27;s mother in Post-Crisis continuity. 

====James Gordon Jr.====

James Gordon Jr. is Jim&#x27;s son. James Jr. is later established as a sociopath.

====Sarah Essen====

Sarah Essen (&quot;Batman&quot; Annual #13, &quot;Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight&quot; Annual #2) was first referenced as Gordon&#x27;s wife during the future tale &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;. She first appeared fully in &quot;Batman: Year One&quot; as a co-worker with whom Gordon has an extra-marital affair. After realizing they could not be together, she transferred out of state. Years after his divorce, Sarah returns to Gotham, and the two renew their relationship. After marrying Gordon, Sarah is murdered by Joker at the end of the &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; storyline. &quot;Flashpoint&quot; altered the events in the DC Universe&#x27;s timeline, so during The New 52 era, Sarah&#x27;s marriage to Gordon never happened. However, starting with 2016&#x27;s DC Rebirth, characters have begun to remember pre-New 52 events. As such, in &quot;The Joker&quot; (vol. 2) #6, Jim Gordon refers to Barbara Kean Gordon as his first wife, which implies that he married another woman after her.

==Other versions==
===&quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;===
Jim Gordon appears in the limited series &quot;&quot;, which presents a future where a retiring Gordon not only knows Batman&#x27;s identity, but is good friends with Bruce Wayne. He then makes a cameo on &quot;&quot;. Now retired, he has written a book about Batman, who is believed to be dead.

Gordon is also referred to in the first issue of the series, &quot;All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder&quot;, set in the same universe as and prior to &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;. He made a full appearance on issue #6, as a police captain, having a conversation with his ex-partner, Sarah Essen, about Batman. He&#x27;s still married to Barbara Kean, who is now an alcoholic, and has a troubled son, James Jr. Just as other continuities, his daughter, Barbara, who is 15, becomes Batgirl. Frank Miller has commented that the series is set in his Dark Knight Universe, which includes all of the Batman works by Frank Miller, therefore Barbara&#x27;s inclusion confirms that Gordon had two children during &quot;Batman: Year One&quot;, at least in Miller&#x27;s version of the continuity. At the end of the series, it&#x27;s implied that, despite being married to Barbara Kean, he&#x27;s still in love with Sarah.

===&quot;JLA: Earth 2&quot;===
On the , where the evil Crime Syndicate of America live, Commissioner Gordon&#x27;s counterpart is a crime boss named &quot;Boss Gordon&quot;, an ally to Owlman. Boss Gordon is the city&#x27;s leading crime boss until his empire is toppled by Batman and commissioner Thomas Wayne.

===&quot;JLA: The Nail&quot;===
In a world where Superman was never found by the Kents, reference is made to Gordon having been murdered shortly before the events of the story, resulting in Gotham&#x27;s police department being granted extra powers of authority in his absence, although these are never fully explained.

===&quot;Batman: Gotham Noir&quot;===
In the Elseworlds title &quot;&quot;, Jim Gordon is an alcoholic hard-boiled private detective who had left the police force following a failure to solve the disappearance of a judge. He is Selina Kyle&#x27;s former lover and Bruce Wayne&#x27;s wartime partner.

===&quot;Batman: In Darkest Knight&quot;===
In the Elseworlds story &quot;&quot;, Jim Gordon is an honest cop who distrusts Green Lantern (who in this reality is Bruce Wayne) because of his near-limitless power. Lantern comes to Gordon in order to find the identity of the man who killed his parents, but Gordon rebukes him. Later on, he changes his mind and starts investigating, but he is then interrupted and killed by Sinestro, who ruptures his heart.

===&quot;Vampire Batman&quot;===
In the &quot;Vampire Batman&quot; Elseworlds trilogy that began with &quot;Batman &amp; Dracula: Red Rain&quot;, Gordon learns that a coven of vampires, led by Count Dracula himself, is behind a series of murders. Dracula captures him, but he defies the vampire even as he is bled from a cut on his neck, with a now-vampiric Batman arriving in time to save Gordon from death. In the sequel &quot;Batman: Bloodstorm&quot;, as Batman acts alone while struggling to resist his thirst for blood, Gordon and Alfred collaborate to form a team to eliminate a new family of vampires in daylight while they sleep, but even after the other vampires have been destroyed, Gordon and Alfred are forced to stake Batman after he succumbs to his thirst and drains the Joker&#x27;s blood. The third part of the trilogy— &quot;Batman: Crimson Mist&quot;— sees Gordon and Alfred forced to work with Two-Face and Killer Croc to stop the vampire Batman, returned from the staking and having already targeted and killed Penguin, Riddler, Scarecrow and Poison Ivy, Gordon grimly stating that, even if he is only killing criminals, the man they knew would never have killed. The story concludes with Gordon being crushed by debris from the Batcave roof after explosives are planted to destroy it, thus exposing Batman to the sunlight and ending his reign of terror.

===Earth-8===
In &quot;Lord Havok and the Lord Havok and the Extremists&quot; #3, an alternate version of Gordon, known as Zombie Gordon is featured as part of Monarch&#x27;s army. A flesh-hungry beast, Zombie Gordon is kept in line by Bat-Soldier, via a large chain.

===&quot;Flashpoint&quot;===
In the alternate timeline of the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; event, James Gordon is the chief of police, instead of being commissioner, and also works with Thomas Wayne, the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; version of Batman. Later, Gordon tries to convince Batman that he does not have to fight villains by himself, but Batman refuses. When Gordon locates Martha Wayne (this continuity&#x27;s version of the Joker) in old Wayne Manor, he goes in without backup. Gordon is then tricked into shooting Harvey Dent&#x27;s daughter, having been disguised as Joker, as she had been taped to a chair and had her mouth taped shut with a smile painted on the tape. Martha then appears and slashes Gordon&#x27;s throat, and Gordon dies by Joker venom.

===&quot;Earth One&quot;===
In the graphic novel by Geoff Johns and Gary Frank, &quot;&quot;, Jim Gordon is featured as a central character. In the story, he&#x27;s a broken man who has given up on fighting corruption until the emergence of Batman. He is also partnered with a young Harvey Bullock. On the trail of the &quot;Birthday Boy&quot; killings, Gordon and Batman put aside their differences and stop the killer while saving Gordon&#x27;s daughter Barbara. In the sequel, Gordon begin his alliance with Batman to combat the Riddler, who plots to takeover the remnant of Oswald Cobblepott&#x27;s criminal empire. He is also being promoted as police captain after he arrested his corrupted predecessor.

===&quot;Injustice: Gods Among Us&quot;===
In the prequel to the video game &quot;&quot;, Gordon learns via Superman&#x27;s x-ray vision that he has terminal lung cancer. Later on he, Bullock and Montoya join forces with Batman&#x27;s Insurgency to fight the Regime, and together they attack the Hall of Justice. Batman&#x27;s inside man Lex Luthor notes that Gordon&#x27;s cancer is worsening due his taking &quot;super pills&quot; that give people superhuman abilities. Gordon takes two of the super pills to save Barbara from Cyborg on the Watchtower, as he is scanning to find her location, accelerating the cancer to the point that he has only minutes to live. After the battle, Gordon thanks Batman and says goodbye to Barbara as he dies, looking down on the Earth.

===&quot;Batman: Damned&quot;===
In the &quot;&quot; miniseries, printed under the DC Black Label, Gordon is seen questioning a homeless man who had apparently witnessed the showdown between Batman and the Joker that led to Joker&#x27;s death. Gordon is next seen at the police standoff with Harley Quinn and the rest of the Joker&#x27;s henchmen, attempting in vain to get them to stand down.

===Dark Multiverse===
Various versions of Gordon appear in the Dark Multiverse depicted in &quot;Dark Nights: Metal&quot;:

* In the world of the &quot;Dawnbreaker&quot;, where Bruce Wayne received a Green Lantern ring after the deaths of his parents, Gordon attempts to confront the Dawnbreaker about his use of lethal force on criminals, but the Dawnbreaker kills him. 
* In the world of the &quot;Batman Who Laughs&quot;, Gordon&#x27;s death contributed to Batman&#x27;s final confrontation with the Joker, which led to Batman being contaminated by his foe&#x27;s blood and transformed into The Batman Who Laughs. 
* In the world of the &quot;Grim Knight&quot;, where Batman&#x27;s use of guns and lethal force led to him turning Gotham into a police state, Gordon was eventually able to determine Batman&#x27;s secret identity with the aid of information from Alfred, who became unable to countenance Batman&#x27;s use of lethal force on all criminals, allowing him to arrest Bruce Wayne.

===Earth 3===
When the &quot;Infinite Frontier&quot; event happened, Earth 3 was rebooted. Like the version seen in &quot;JLA: Earth 2&quot;, Jim Gordon operated as a crime boss. After his son Jimmy Jr. was killed by criminals Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne, Boss Gordon sent his minion Harvey Bullock to kill them which also led to Harvey also killing Bruce and leaving Thomas Wayne Jr. alive. Thomas Wayne Jr. in the identity of Owlman would later learn of this motive when he captures Harvey Bullock years later.

===Earth-89 (&quot;Batman &#x27;89&quot;) ===
In the universe where the films &quot;Batman&quot; (1989) and &quot;Batman Returns&quot; is set, it is retroactively established in the comic book miniseries &quot;Batman &#x27;89&quot; that Pat Hingle&#x27;s iteration of Gordon was the patrolman who found and comforted Bruce in the alley where his parents were murdered. He is later killed by Billy Dee Williams&#x27;s Harvey Dent after the character becomes Two-Face. In the follow-up book, &quot;Echoes&quot;, his daughter Barbara becomes Captain of the GCPD and decides against prosecuting Bruce after discovering her father had learned Batman&#x27;s secret identity at some point after the events of the first film but refused to disclose it.

His wife is occasionally mentioned but never named.
* James &quot;Jim&quot; Gordon appears in &quot;Gotham&quot;, played by Ben McKenzie. This version is an idealistic rookie detective and a war veteran of the United States Army. His late father was Gotham&#x27;s district attorney, whom crime boss Carmine Falcone claims was on his payroll. Gordon is the first police officer to interview Bruce Wayne after the latter&#x27;s parents are murdered in the pilot episode, and vows to solve the murders. He is quickly drawn into the city&#x27;s underbelly, thanks to his shady partner Harvey Bullock and small-time criminal Oswald Cobblepot. He also makes two new acquaintances: a teenage street thief named Selina Kyle who witnessed the Waynes&#x27; murder, and Gotham&#x27;s young assistant district attorney Harvey Dent who pledges to help Gordon find the killer. The series also portrays his turbulent romances with socialite Barbara Kean and Arkham physician Leslie Thompkins, his efforts to rid the GCPD of corruption, and his quest to stop corrupt billionaire Theo Galavan and the Sacred Order of Saint Dumas from taking over the city. This version of the character is forced to kill in self-defense a gangster while &quot;collecting a debt&quot; for Cobblepot and commits what could arguably be considered murder. He shoots the unarmed Galavan (who is later resurrected) in the head. In the series finale, &quot;The Beginning...&quot;, Gordon has been Gotham&#x27;s Police Commissioner for 10 years, and is the first to see the vigilante Batman.

===Film===
====Live-action====

* Jim Gordon appears in &quot;Batman and Robin&quot;, portrayed by Lyle Talbot.
* Jim Gordon appears in &quot;Batman: The Movie&quot;, portrayed again by Neil Hamilton.

=====Burton/Schumacher series=====
In the Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher film adaptations of Batman, Commissioner Gordon is portrayed by Pat Hingle.

* In the script written by Tom Mankiewicz for the unmade &quot;The Batman&quot; film, which was later made as the 1989 film &quot;Batman&quot;, Gordon was set to appear as Commissioner and named David, instead of James. William Holden was considered for the role.
*In &quot;Batman&quot; (1989), Gordon regards Batman (Michael Keaton) as a rumor at best and vigilante at worst, though by the end of the film, Gordon publicly acknowledges the hero&#x27;s usefulness and helps present the Bat-Signal.
*In &quot;Batman Returns&quot; (1992), when the Penguin (Danny DeVito) has Batman framed for murder, it is implied Gordon is not entirely convinced, as he is not willing to use lethal force to apprehend him, and publicly refers to Batman&#x27;s batarang at the crime scene as &quot;purely circumstantial&quot;.
*In &quot;Batman Forever&quot; (1995), Gordon is shown to be fairly well acquainted with Bruce Wayne (Val Kilmer), but unaware that he is Batman. He arrives at the scene of the apparent suicide of Wayne Enterprises employee Fred Stickley (Ed Begley, Jr.), unaware that the latter was actually murdered by Edward Nygma (Jim Carrey). Gordon is also present at the circus when Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones) murders the family of Dick Grayson (Chris O&#x27;Donnell), and he later brings Dick to Wayne Manor after Bruce volunteers to take care of the young man.
* Although Barbara Gordon is his daughter in most continuities, in &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; (1997), Batgirl is characterized as Alfred Pennyworth&#x27;s (Michael Gough) niece, Barbara Wilson (Alicia Silverstone). In Commissioner Gordon&#x27;s last appearance in the film, Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman) uses her pheromones to make him fall in love with her to get the keys to police headquarters and the Bat-Signal, and almost kills him with her toxic kiss before changing her mind because of him, &quot;being too old for her&quot;.
* Gordon was planned for the aborted reboot &quot;&quot;, written by Darren Aronofsky and Frank Miller. In this script Gordon has lived in Gotham for years, and is trying to leave for the sake of his pregnant wife; also Gordon&#x27;s wife is renamed Ann, instead of Barbara, and Gordon&#x27;s character would have been suicidal.

===== &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; Trilogy =====
Jim Gordon appears in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;Dark Knight&quot; trilogy, portrayed by Gary Oldman.
* &quot;Batman Begins&quot; (2005) chronicles Gordon&#x27;s rise through the ranks of the Gotham City Police Department. In the beginning of the film, Gordon is a uniformed patrol officer who does his best to comfort the eight-year-old Bruce Wayne after the murder of his parents. Years later, Gordon has attained the rank of Sergeant and a now-adult Bruce (Christian Bale) regards as one of the few honest cops in Gotham City and respects him. Once Bruce adopts the Batman identity, Gordon is the first law enforcement officer he contacts; the two form a secret alliance against Carmine Falcone&#x27;s (Tom Wilkinson) criminal empire. Gordon proves important when Batman fights Ra&#x27;s al Ghul (Liam Neeson). Batman gives Gordon the task of destroying a monorail track using the Tumbler, halting Ra&#x27;s&#x27; plan to destroy the city. At the end of the film, he is promoted to Lieutenant and shows a new Bat-Signal to Batman, also telling him of an armed robber who leaves a calling card in the form of a Joker playing card at his crime scenes. Many critics, and writer David S. Goyer, have noted that Gary Oldman&#x27;s portrayal bears a strong resemblance to the character&#x27;s depiction in &quot;Batman: Year One&quot;.
* In &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; (2008), Gordon is leading the GCPD Major Crimes Unit and forms a tenuous alliance with Batman and the newly elected district attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) to take down Gotham&#x27;s organized crime syndicates. When the Joker (Heath Ledger) reveals that Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb (Colin McFarlane) is one of his upcoming targets, Gordon arrives at his office with other officers to offer protection, but he is unable to stop Loeb from drinking a glass of poisoned Scotch. At Loeb&#x27;s funeral, Gordon foils the Joker&#x27;s attempt on Mayor Anthony Garcia&#x27;s (Nestor Carbonell) life, in the process faking his own death to protect his family. After Dent claims to be Batman, Gordon disguises himself as a SWAT officer and commandeers the armored truck that is carrying him to the county lockup for processing. Following a vehicular battle with the Joker, Gordon rescues both Batman and Dent, captures the Joker, and is promoted to Police Commissioner by the Mayor. Hours later, two corrupt cops and the Joker&#x27;s men abduct Dent and Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), placing them in separate buildings with oil drums rigged to explode. Batman chooses to save Rachel, while Gordon and several officers go to save Dent, unaware that the Joker has switched their locations as part of a plan to orchestrate Dent&#x27;s downfall. While Batman is able to rescue Dent, Gordon arrives at Rachel&#x27;s location just as the bomb explodes and kills her. Disfigured in the explosion and driven insane by grief, Dent seeks vengeance against Gordon for Rachel&#x27;s death. Dent kidnaps Gordon&#x27;s wife and two children, and forces Gordon to plead for their lives at the site of Rachel&#x27;s death. He flips his trademark coin to decide whether Gordon&#x27;s son (Nathan Gamble) should die, but Batman tackles Dent off the building, killing him. Afterwards, Batman decides to take the blame for all of Dent&#x27;s murders to preserve his reputation. Gordon reluctantly agrees, having come to highly respect the Caped Crusader. After eulogizing Dent as a hero to the city, Gordon destroys the Bat-Signal and calls for a manhunt against Batman. As Batman flees, Gordon assures his son that Batman is not just a hero: he is the city&#x27;s protector, a &quot;Dark Knight&quot;.
* In &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; (2012), Gordon feels remorse for concealing Dent&#x27;s crimes, and contemplates resigning and revealing the truth to the city. By now, Gordon&#x27;s wife has left him and taken their children. Bane&#x27;s (Tom Hardy) men shoot Gordon, putting him in critical condition. A disguised Bruce Wayne visits him in the hospital, and Gordon implores his former ally to return to crimefighting. He also befriends John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and promotes the rookie police officer to detective, seeing in the young man the dedication and idealism he once had. After Bane defeats Batman and traps most of the Gotham City Police Department underground, Gordon gets himself out of bed and defeats the League of Shadows operatives who tried to kill him in his hospital room. Bane publicly exposes Dent&#x27;s crimes and Gordon&#x27;s complicity in the coverup, and takes Gordon and his men prisoner. Gordon later finds a truck carrying a nuclear bomb meant to annihilate the city and places a device on it to block the trigger signal. In the final battle against Bane, Talia al Ghul (Marion Cotillard), and the League of Shadows, Batman cryptically reveals his true identity to Gordon before apparently sacrificing himself to thwart the League of Shadows&#x27; plan to destroy the city. In the film&#x27;s novelization, despite the revelation that Gordon covered up Dent&#x27;s crimes, his actions in helping to save Gotham restore the public&#x27;s trust in him, and he remains as police commissioner. After giving the eulogy at Bruce Wayne&#x27;s funeral, Gordon discovers the Bat-Signal has been repaired and realizes that Bruce is still alive.

* In &quot;&quot;, he accompanies Batman into the titular asylum to escort the recently captured Joker, only to witness him break free and take over the facility. Gordon is subsequently captured by a corrupt guard named Frank Boles and held hostage by Harley Quinn until Batman rescues him, though not before experiencing a hallucination caused by Scarecrow&#x27;s fear toxin depicting Gordon&#x27;s apparent death. Later, another fear toxin-induced hallucination causes Batman to relive the murder of his parents and its aftermath, where it is revealed that a young Gordon was the only officer to comfort Bruce Wayne. After defeating Bane, Batman asks Gordon to leave Arkham Island, but the Commissioner is re-captured by the Joker and held hostage during his final battle with Batman. The Joker attempts to shoot Gordon with a dart gun laced with Titan but Batman takes the hit instead and is able to cure himself. Following the Joker&#x27;s defeat, Gordon oversees the return of the asylum&#x27;s inmates to their cells and offers Batman a ride home due to the destruction of the Batmobile, only for Batman to take off in the Batwing after overhearing an alert on Gordon&#x27;s radio about Two-Face&#x27;s bank robbery in Gotham.
* In &quot;&quot;, Gordon sends a group of undercover police officers to infiltrate the titular city prison and discover the true intentions of its warden, Hugo Strange. At the end of the game, Gordon is present at the gates of Arkham City when Batman carries the Joker&#x27;s lifeless body outside. He also appears in the DLC &quot;Harley Quinn&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, where he works with Batman and later Robin to rescue a group of police officers held hostage by Harley Quinn, and expresses concern about Batman&#x27;s mental state since the Joker&#x27;s death.
* In &quot;&quot;, a young Gordon is a police captain, one of the few non-corrupt members of the GCPD, and is initially distrustful of Batman, seeing him as a menace and a lunatic, as opposed to his daughter Barbara who sees Batman as a hero. Gordon has several encounters with Batman throughout the game, trying to arrest the vigilante, until the two are forced to work together for the first time to stop Firefly from destroying a bridge with explosives. During the Joker&#x27;s takeover of Blackgate Prison, Gordon arrives to stop the chaos, only to be put in danger when the Joker straps him to an electric chair that will go off if Batman does not kill Bane in time. Batman momentarily stops Bane&#x27;s heart in time to save Gordon, and the two work together to defeat the Joker. After these events, Gordon becomes more trusting of Batman and reluctantly enlists his aid to apprehend several escaped Blackgate prisoners.
* In &quot;&quot;, Gordon informs Batman of a riot at Blackgate Prison that the vigilante consequently sets out to stop.
* In &quot;&quot;, Gordon loses trust in Batman after Barbara is kidnapped by Scarecrow and Batman reveals that she was working with him. He tries to go after Scarecrow himself, but gets captured and witnesses the confrontation between the Arkham Knight and Batman, leading him to discover the latter&#x27;s identity as Bruce Wayne. Gordon is then ordered by Scarecrow to kill Batman to save Barbara and reluctantly shoots him, albeit in a spot he knows his armor to be stronger. Despite this, Scarecrow still attempts to kill Barbara by throwing her off a building, though Batman saves her. Gordon and a captive Tim Drake are later taken by Scarecrow to the abandoned Arkham Asylum, where the villain forces Gordon to unmask Batman on live television. Following Scarecrow&#x27;s defeat, Bruce tells Gordon to look after Barbara and Tim as it is the end for Batman. In the game&#x27;s epilogue, set one year later, Gordon has become the Mayor of Gotham and goes to attend his daughter and Tim&#x27;s wedding.
** The story pack &quot;Batgirl: A Matter of Family&quot;, taking place before the events of &quot;Arkham Asylum&quot;, centers around Gordon being held hostage by the Joker and Harley Quinn in a defunct oil rig, where Batgirl and Robin attempt to rescue him.
* In &quot;&quot;, Gordon, recently promoted to Commissioner, works with Batman and Harvey Dent to uncover the identity of the Rat King, who is targeting public officials. Gordon is saved by Batman from an assassination attempt by Shrike, one of the Rat King&#x27;s men, and later interrogates Irving &quot;Matches&quot; Malone, whom both he and Dent suspect to be working for the Rat King and be responsible for the death of undercover officer Chris Nakano. Gordon is present for Malone&#x27;s trial, during which Dent is inadvertently scarred by chemicals that Dr. Jonathan Crane was attempting to administer to Malone to prove his mental competency.

====Telltale&#x27;s Batman====
James &quot;Jim&quot; Gordon appears in &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, voiced by Murphy Guyer.
* In the first season, Gordon is a reluctant ally of Batman and one of his supports within the GCPD. He is also the officer in charge of the investigation into Thomas Wayne and Martha Kane&#x27;s connections to organized crime. During the series, he is able to create an alliance between the GCPD and Batman to combat the Children of Arkham, despite objections from Commissioner Peter Grogan and other officers on the force. Gordon can also become associated with Bruce Wayne, depending on options taken by the player, such as giving him a file on Carmine Falcone&#x27;s empire or helping him arrest the Penguin. At the end of the series, Gordon is promoted to Acting Commissioner after Grogan is killed by either Harvey Dent&#x27;s enforcers or the Children of Arkham. During his appointment speech, Gordon is supported by either Bruce Wayne or Batman.
* In the second season, &quot;The Enemy Within&quot;, Gordon has now been given the title of Commissioner permanently and is still allied with Batman. When Amanda Waller and her organization, the Agency, arrive in Gotham, he and the GCPD are forced to cooperate with them and, after a failed operation to capture the Riddler, relinquish law enforcement in Gotham to the Agency. Gordon&#x27;s relationship with Batman is also tested after he learns about the vigilante&#x27;s indirect involvement in an attack on Wayne Enterprises and if the vigilante cooperates with the Agency. After attempting to arrest Bruce Wayne for his association with the Pact, Gordon, having been warned by Waller, is fired from the GCPD. During the Joker&#x27;s attacks on Gotham, Gordon either helps Batman track him down after he kidnaps Waller in Joker&#x27;s vigilante path or is forced to betray Batman in return for the locations of bombs hidden through Gotham in Joker&#x27;s villain path, only to be crippled by the criminal. Waller later states that Gordon won&#x27;t be able to walk without a cane. During the epilogue, Batman can arrange to either have Gordon reinstated as Commissioner, honored for his choice, or have him retired from law enforcement.

<text>War with the Newts (Válka s Mloky in the original Czech), also translated as Salamander Wars, is a 1936 satirical science fiction novel by Czech author Karel Čapek. It concerns the discovery in the Indian Ocean of a sea-dwelling race, an intelligent breed of newts, who are initially enslaved and exploited. They acquire human knowledge and rebel, leading to a global war for supremacy. There are obvious similarities to Čapek&#x27;s earlier &quot;R.U.R.&quot;, but also some original themes.

&quot;War with the Newts&quot; was described as a &quot;classic work&quot; of science fiction by science fiction author and critic Damon Knight.

==Plot summary==
Only the last four of the book&#x27;s 27 chapters deal with the eponymous war. The rest of the book is concerned with the discovery of the Newts, their exploitation and evolution, and growing tensions between humans and the Newts in the lead-up to the war.

The book does not have any single protagonist, but instead looks at the development of the Newts from a broad societal perspective. At various points the narrator&#x27;s register seems to slip into that of a journalist, historian or anthropologist. The three most central characters are Captain J. van Toch, the seaman who discovers the Newts; Mr Gussie H. Bondy, the industrialist who leads the development of the Newt industry; and Mr Povondra, Mr Bondy&#x27;s doorman. They all reoccur throughout the book, but none can be said to drive the narrative in any significant way. All three are Czech.

The novel is divided into three sections or &#x27;books&#x27;.

===Book One – Andrias Scheuchzeri===
The first section recounts Captain van Toch&#x27;s discovery of the Newts on Tanahmasa, a small island near Sumatra, their initial exploitation in the service of pearl farming, the beginning of their spread around the oceans of the world, and the development of their speech and absorption of human culture. The section closes with the founding of The Salamander Syndicate, an ambitious plan developed by Mr Bondy to redirect Newt resources away from the declining pearl industry and into larger hydroengineering projects. Though this is the close of the narrative development of this section, after it there is a further appendix entitled &#x27;The Sex Life of the Newts&#x27;. This examines the Newts&#x27; sexuality and reproductive processes in a pastiche of academese.
The tone of the first section is generally light-hearted satire, in contrast to the darker tone of later parts of the story. Čapek targets a range of human foibles, from the superficiality of Hollywood starlets, to the arrogance of prevalent European attitudes towards non-white races. He also skewers the self-assuredness of science; scientists are repeatedly seen underestimating the capabilities of the Newts and falsely assessing other related issues, always in full confidence of the validity of their claims.

===Book Two – Up the Ladder of Civilization===
The second section concerns the development of the Newts from the founding of The Salamander Syndicate to the outbreak of the first hostilities between Newts and humans. It contains only three chapters: one long oneby far the longest in the novelbookended by two short ones. In the first chapter Mr. Povondra begins collecting newspaper clippings concerning the Newts. The long middle chapter then takes the form of a historical essay written at some unspecified time in the future. The essay cites Mr. Povondra&#x27;s clippings as its main source of historical evidence, and includes a number of footnotes and quotations from his collection. The third chapter returns to the Povondra household a number of years after the events of the first chapter and introduces an early Newt–human conflict.

===Book Three – War with the Newts===
The final section reverts to the same form as the first section, but with a darker tone. It relates a series of skirmishes between Newts and humans, eventually resulting in the outbreak of war when the Newts declare their need to destroy portions of the world&#x27;s continents in order to create new coastlines and so expand their living space. Čapek&#x27;s satirical targets here are mainly nationalism (the British, French and Germans are all portrayed as irredeemably stubborn and nationalistic), German racial theories (see below), and the perceived inefficacy of international diplomacy. In the penultimate chapter, the tone becomes didactic: &quot;We are all responsible for it&quot;, declares Čapek&#x27;s mouthpiece, Mr. Povondra&#x27;s adult son.

The last chapter, entitled &quot;The Author Talks to Himself&quot;, takes a metafictional turn. With Earth&#x27;s landmass one-fifth destroyed and humanity offering little resistance, the chapter cuts away from the action to a conversation between two personas of the author, called the Author and the Writer. Between them they map out the long-term history of the Newts: the Newts will all but destroy the Earth&#x27;s landmass, leaving only a tiny clump of humanity to work for them in their factories. Eventually they will form separate countries and destroy themselves by committing the same follies as humanity; humans will then inherit what remains of the earth; new continents will arise, and &quot;America&quot; will be dimly remembered as an Atlantis-like mythical land.

==Background==
By the early 1930s, the author&#x27;s country of Czechoslovakia was in a precarious political situation. Čapek became concerned by the developments of National Socialism in Germany. He began writing his &quot;Apocryphal Tales&quot;, short allegorical pieces that picked up on the anxiety felt by many Czechoslovaks at the time. These may have provided the impetus for &quot;War with the Newts&quot;, which was written over four months in the summer of 1935.

He describes the initial thought of the novel as, &quot;you mustn&#x27;t think that the evolution that gave rise to our form of life was the only evolutionary process on the planet&quot;. On 27 August 1935, Čapek wrote, &quot;Today I completed the last chapter of my utopian novel. The protagonist of this chapter is nationalism. The content is quite simple: the destruction of the world and its people. It is a disgusting chapter, based solely on logic. Yet it had to end this way. What destroys us will not be a cosmic catastrophe but mere reasons of state, economics, prestige, etc.&quot;

==As satire and social commentary==
The book is a dark satire, poking fun extensively at the contemporary European politics, including colonialism, fascism and Nazism, segregation in America, and the arms race. A notable satirical point is the mentioned research of a German scientist who has determined that the German Newts are actually a superior Nordic race, and that as such they have a right to expand their living space at the expense of the inferior breeds of Newts.

The author&#x27;s opinion of the United States&#x27; social problems also appears very pessimistic, as whenever that country is mentioned as dealing with a crisis, American mobs &quot;lynch negroes&quot; as scapegoats. Sometimes the Newts are shown in the same manner as the blacks, as when a white woman claims to have been raped by one of them. Despite the physical impossibility of the act, people believe her and carry out Newt lynchings.

One passage, depicting the European nations willing to hand over China to the Newts as long as they are themselves spared and overriding the Chinese&#x27;s desperate protests, seems a premonition of the Munich Agreement, three years after the book was writtenin which the writer&#x27;s own country suffered a similar fate in a futile effort to appease the Nazis.

Another passage seems to mock parochialism and isolationism. Czechs are following news of the Newts&#x27; advances and conquests with a distant interest, feeling that as a landlocked country far from any sea they themselves have nothing to worryuntil the day that a Newt is seen swimming in Prague&#x27;s own Vltava River, and the Czechs suddenly realize that they are the next target.

Darko Suvin has described &quot;War with the Newts&quot; as &quot;the pioneer of all anti-fascist and anti-militarist SF&quot;.

== Translations ==

The novel was translated into several languages within a year of its first publication. During the Second World War, it was blacklisted by the Nazis in 1940 in Germany and in 1941 by Nazi-occupied Norway.

&quot;War with the Newts&quot; has been translated into English at least three times. Reviewers describe the 1936 Allen &amp; Unwin translation by the husband-and-wife team of Marie and Robert Weatherall as competent but uninspired. The language of the era is preserved, but some of Čapek&#x27;s literary techniques are obscured. The 1985 translation, by the Czech Ewald Osers, is regarded by many reviewers as superior, capturing the crispness and strong metaphors of the original. This translation was supported by the UNESCO Collection of Representative Works. Veteran Kafka translator David Wyllie completed another translation. New translations in Russian, Polish, French, German, Dutch, Norwegian, Spanish, Swedish, and Hungarian have appeared since the 1960s.

==Adaptations==
In 1981 Kenny Murray and Ken Campbell adapted the story into a play, which was performed at the Everyman Theatre in Liverpool. A 2003 production, based on the English translation by Ewald Osers, was adapted for the stage by E.B. Solomon and performed at the Kennedy Center&#x27;s Prelude Festival and later at The Catholic University of America and the Mead Theatre Lab. In 2010, an adaptation by Jason Loewith and Justin D.M. Palmer (in collaboration with puppet designer Michael Montenegro) was performed at Next Theatre in Evanston, Illinois.

In 1981, Ken Campbell directed &quot;War With the Newts&quot; at the Riverside Studios in Hammersmith, London. With Henry Davis, Txi Whizz; consultant, Nigel Bourne

In 1998, Stephan Koplowitz directed/choreographed/produced a movement/theater/music production of &quot;War With the Newts&quot; at Dance Theater Workshop, the script was adapted by David Lindsay-Abaire, with music by Andrew Warshaw.

In 2005 a BBC Radio adaption was produced, starring Dermot Crowley, Sally Hawkins, Henry Goodman, Geoffrey Beevers, Tina Gray, and Adrian Scarborough.

In 2022, a musical podcast titled &quot;Newts!&quot; was produced by PRX and &quot;The Truth&quot;, co-created by Ian Coss and Sam Jay Gold.

Robert Zubrin has said that his 2003 novel &quot;The Holy Land&quot;, a satire on the Middle East conflict and the War on Terror, was inspired by &quot;The War with the Newts&quot;.

In Jaroslav Kalfař&#x27;s 2023 novel &quot;A Brief History of Living Forever&quot; the main character is the leading actress in a film adaptation called &quot;The Great Newt War&quot;.

An animated film adaptation directed by Czech director Aurel Klimt is in development.

The video game &quot;Hrot&quot; includes a level heavily inspired by &quot;War with the Newts&quot;.

==Reception==
Dave Langford reviewed &quot;War with the Newts&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #74, and stated that &quot;Čapek&#x27;s sophisticated wit converts what could be a plodding satire into something painfully funny.&quot;
