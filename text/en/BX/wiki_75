<text>The Brickyard 400 (currently known for sponsorship reasons as the Brickyard 400 presented by PPG) is an annual NASCAR Cup Series points race held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana. The inaugural race was held in 1994 and was the first race other than the Indianapolis 500 to be held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway since 1916. In its inaugural running, the Brickyard 400 became NASCAR&#x27;s most-attended event, drawing an estimated crowd of more than 250,000 spectators. The race also paid one of NASCAR&#x27;s highest purses. From 1994 to 2020, the race was held on the 2.5-mile oval, for a distance of 400 miles. The race was put on hiatus for three years (2021–2023) in favor of the Verizon 200 at the Brickyard which was run on a combined road course and run a distance of . The event returned to the oval for the 2024 season.

The term &quot;Brickyard&quot; is a reference to the nickname historically used for the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. When the race course opened in August 1909, the track surface was crushed stone and tar. That poor surface was the cause of numerous and sometimes fatal accidents, so the track was subsequently repaved with 3.2 million bricks. Over time the bricks were paved over with asphalt, and now only a one-yard strip of bricks at the start/finish line remains exposed.

From 1994 to 2017, the event was held on the first weekend of August, or the last weekend of July. For 2018 and 2019, after schedule realignments, NASCAR moved the race from its traditional summer date to be the last race of the regular season on the weekend after Labor Day. In 2020 only, it was held on Independence Day weekend. In 2021, the event was moved back to late-July/early-August and moved to the Grand Prix road course rather than the full oval. The layout utilized was a newer modified layout of the circuit previously used for the Formula One U.S. Grand Prix, and currently used for the IndyCar Grand Prix.

From 2005 to 2009, the race was known as the Allstate 400 at the Brickyard under a naming rights arrangement with Allstate. From 2012 to 2016, Crown Royal was the title sponsor of the race; under its sponsorship, the race honored a military member or first responder selected by fans, who received VIP tickets to the event, and their name included in the title of the race. From 2011 to 2014, the country music record label Big Machine Records was the presenting sponsor, and it became the title sponsor beginning in 2017. After co-branding the event with Big Machine-signed artist Brantley Gilbert in 2017, subsequent races have had Big Machine&#x27;s Big Machine Vodka, as the sponsor. The 2020 race was known as the Big Machine Hand Sanitizer 400 at the Brickyard. When the race moved to the road course for 2021, Verizon assumed naming rights.

The names of the winners of the Brickyard 400 are inscribed on the PPG Trophy, which is permanently housed at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum. Jeff Gordon won the inaugural Brickyard 400 on August 6, 1994. He is the most-successful driver in the history of the race, with a record five victories and three pole positions. Gordon also holds the most laps completed, most laps led, and most earnings in the race. Hendrick Motorsports was the most successful team with 11 total wins and 5 poles.

==Race origins==
===Early years===

The Indianapolis Motor Speedway opened in 1909, and the first Indianapolis 500 was held in 1911. After initially hosting multiple race meets in 1909–1910, it became a tradition that the Indianapolis 500 would be the only race held at the track annually. With the exception of a race meet the weekend after Labor Day in 1916, no other races were held at the track through 1993. As the NASCAR Winston Cup Series began to grow in stature and popularity, speculation began to grow in the 1980s and early 1990s about the possibility of holding a race at Indy. From 1971 to 1980, NASCAR held races at Ontario Motor Speedway, which was built as a replica of Indianapolis. With their experiences at Ontario, it was generally presumed that the stock cars would find Indy&#x27;s nearly identical layout equally competitive. In the mid-to-late 1960s, stock car racing slowly began to develop a following in Indiana, with the introduction of the USAC Stock Car Yankee 300 at Indianapolis Raceway Park and the State Fair Century at the Fairgrounds. Later, the Kroger 200 at the IRP oval became a popular stop on the NASCAR Busch Series.

During the reigns of Speedway presidents Tony Hulman (1946–1977), John Cooper (1980–1981) and Joe Cloutier (1978–1979, 1983–1989), the idea of hosting a second race at the Speedway was considered from time to time, but never seriously pursued by the board of directors. Cooper had talks with NASCAR, but Cloutier in particular, seemed the most resistant. Not only was tradition and fan interest an issue, but logistical scheduling issues were also obstacles. The congested and aging Gasoline Alley garage area, narrow pit lane, existing retaining walls and catch fences were considered insufficient for the large, heavy stock cars, thus significant capital improvements would be required to properly host NASCAR. Cloutier wanted to assure that a second race at the Speedway would outdraw Indianapolis 500 time trials, otherwise it would not make financial sense.

Around 1969, USAC proposed a race at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway for the USAC Stock Car division. It was to be called the &quot;Tony Hulman Classic&quot;, but Hulman and the Speedway management declined the offer. The race would have had to have been held in the autumn, since all desirable summer dates were already taken. For instance, the July 4 weekend was already taken by the Firecracker 400, which would have prevented any NASCAR stars from crossing over to participate; plus several USAC regulars were known to pick up rides for Daytona. Labor Day weekend was already crowded with the USAC California 500 at Ontario, the NASCAR Southern 500 at Darlington, and the NHRA U.S. Nationals at nearby IRP. No progress towards scheduling a stock car race, whether USAC or NASCAR, was ever taken before Tony Hulman died in 1977.

In 1980, due to a tax dispute with the City of Daytona Beach and Volusia County, Bill France openly threatened to move the NASCAR Firecracker 400 to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. A few weeks later, however, the parties reconciled, and the plan to move the race was withdrawn.

In the summer of 1979, during the first USAC/CART Split, a proposal was made to hold a second race at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. After the California 500 switched alliances mid-season to become a CART series race, USAC proposed a Labor Day weekend race meet that would consist of a USAC Stock Car/Championship Car doubleheader. A 250-mile stock car race on Saturday would be followed by a 250-mile Indycar race on Sunday. However, the plan never materialized. One of the issues noted was a potential conflict with the NHRA U.S. Nationals at nearby IRP. Even still, rumors of a late-summer stock car race persisted for another year or so. Speculation grew after Ontario Motor Speedway closed and opened up a date on the NASCAR schedule. In early 1982, then-Speedway president John Cooper was said to have made a &#x27;hand-shake&#x27; deal with Bill France for a race, but it was vetoed by Mary F. Hulman. Cooper subsequently resigned, saying the details had never really been ironed out, and talks about a stock car race at Indy cooled for the next several years.

Though no stock car races had ever been held, the Speedway did occasionally see stock car testing and endurance runs. In 1956, Ford set a 500-mile stock car record, and in 1956, the Nichels Engineering Endurance Run was held. A. J. Foyt was known to have used his garage at Indy to store race cars during the summer months, and in 1979 was said to have taken his NASCAR stock car for test laps.

When Joe Cloutier died in December 1989, Tony George was named the president of the Speedway. Upon his appointment, George immediately began taking the Speedway in new business directions. However, at first, he was cautious and tentative about the idea of a NASCAR race at the Speedway.

===1990s===
On September 24, 1991, A. J. Foyt filmed a commercial for Craftsman tools at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. While filming in the garage area, Foyt, and Speedway president Tony George decided to take Foyt&#x27;s NASCAR Winston Cup Series stock car for a few laps around the track. Foyt was the first driver to do so, and later on, George himself took a few laps. The event was not planned, and had no implications, but was an unusual sight, and stirred up some mild interest and speculation for the future.

In December 1991, Tony George proposed to the board of directors a plan to hold a second major event at the Speedway. The board approved the measure, and the Speedway started taking steps towards hosting a second race, preferably a NASCAR Winston Cup event, but also considering IROC. An idea was also proposed for an &quot;all-star&quot; exhibition event involving former winners racing stock cars on Carburetion Day.

In March 1992, NASCAR drivers Dave Marcis, Jim Sauter, and Dick Trickle (all of whom were IROC test drivers) were invited to test IROC cars at the Speedway. Trickle reportedly ran a lap that was hand–timed at . At the time, the Speedway was considering hosting an IROC event during May as part of the on-track activities leading up the Indianapolis 500. The second weekend of Indy 500 qualifying was becoming less-popular with fans, and an additional event was an idea to boost attendance. The test was considered successful, but several improvements would have to be made to the track before it was safe for the IROC cars to race there. After much consideration, it was determined that it would not be economically feasible to hold the IROC race. Plans for that event were put on hold. Instead, nine top NASCAR teams were invited to test (see below).

On June 22–23, 1992, nine top NASCAR Winston Cup series teams were invited to Indianapolis to participate in a Goodyear tire test. Over the weekend, the teams had raced in the Miller Genuine Draft 400 at Michigan International Speedway. Although no official announcements were made, it was in fact an unofficial compatibility test to see if stock cars would be competitive at the circuit. An estimated 10,000 spectators watched two days of history in the making. A. J. Foyt took a few laps around the track in Dale Earnhardt&#x27;s car on the second day.

Following the test, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway started an extensive improvement project. The outside retaining wall and catch fence were replaced. The new wall and fence were decidedly stronger, and could support the 3,500 pound NASCAR stock cars. The pit area was widened, and the individual pit stalls were replaced in concrete. This was done to better support the pneumatic jacks used by the Indy cars, and to handle the refuel spillage of gasoline from the NASCAR machines. The largest project, however, involved the removal of the track apron, and the construction of the new warm-up lane, similar to that built at Nazareth Speedway in 1987. The Gasoline Alley garage area had already been rebuilt in 1986, and it was said to have been designed to accommodate stock cars if and when a race were ever to materialize.

On April 14, 1993, Speedway President Tony George, and the president of NASCAR, Bill France Jr. jointly announced the Inaugural Brickyard 400 would be held Saturday August 6, 1994. A new race logo was also unveiled. The initial contract was for two seasons, but the race was expected to return in perpetuity.

On August 16–17 the same year, thirty-five NASCAR teams took part in an open test at the Speedway. It was held as the teams returned from the second race at Michigan, the Champion Spark Plug 400. The top 35 teams in NASCAR points received invitations. Hosting the test in August mimicked the weather conditions expected for the race in 1994. Several thousand spectators attended, and many announcements were made. NASCAR legend Richard Petty, who had retired from competition the previous November, took four laps himself, then donated his car to the Speedway museum.

==Race details==
For its first running in 1994, the race was slated for a Saturday afternoon at 1:15 pm EDT, on August 6. At the time the first weekend of August was open on the NASCAR schedule. Since the race was not being held on a holiday weekend, track officials decided to observe Sunday as a makeup date in case of rain on Saturday. In 1994, practice and pole qualifying was held on Thursday. Practice, second round qualifying, and &quot;Happy Hour&quot; final practice were scheduled for Friday. In addition, during the first year, a special &quot;pacing&quot; practice was held where the field followed behind the pace car to measure pit road speed.

Starting in 1995, an additional practice session was scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. Pole qualifying was still held Thursday, and second round qualifying was held Friday. This schedule continued through 2000.

From 1998 to 2003, an IROC event was situated in the schedule. The IROC race would be held the day before the Brickyard 400.

Starting in 2001, the race was moved to Sunday. In addition, NASCAR eliminated second-round qualification. The schedule was compressed so practice was held Friday, and the single pole qualifying round was held Saturday. &quot;Happy hour&quot; final practice was also held Saturday. This schedule differed from typical NASCAR weekend schedules, which normally saw practice and pole qualification on Fridays. Moving the pole qualification to Saturday allowed for a potential larger audience, and also opened the schedule up for the Kroger 200 held at nearby Indianapolis Raceway Park.

In 2007, coinciding with ESPN taking over NASCAR television rights, the race swapped dates with Pocono. The Brickyard 400 moved to the last weekend in July, and Pocono to the first weekend in August.

===Attendance===
At the onset, the Brickyard 400 saw some of the largest crowds in NASCAR history. The first running in 1994 saw a sold-out record crowd of over 250,000 spectators. Track officials claimed to have received requests for tickets three to four times what they could fulfill, and had to resort to a lottery system to distribute tickets. In an effort to prevent the Brickyard 400 from upstaging the Indianapolis 500 in gate attendance, some bleacher seating was removed for the 400, and infield general admission was not offered for the first several years. In addition, some infield bleachers were dismantled and infield grass mound seating was closed off to spectators for the first couple of years for safety reasons. It was determined that the inside fences and guardrails that existed at the time were not sufficiently robust for the 3,500-pound stock cars. In 1996, a new concrete wall and catch fence was built along the inside of the backstretch, and the grass mounds were reopened to spectators.

After a tire controversy at the 2008 race, subsequent attendance began to sharply decline at the 400. Other factors that have been cited include poor sightlines compared to other NASCAR tracks, the overall lack of competition, and uncomfortably hot summer temperatures in July/August. In addition, following the change from a track-organized television contract (1994–2000) to a centralized NASCAR television package (since 2001), the local television blackout the Speedway imposed was lifted. The track has long been criticized for being poorly-suited for stock cars prompting some fans to choose other tracks. The subsequent addition of new races within a 160-mile radius, spaced only weeks apart at Chicagoland and Kentucky, gave fans other options. The 2016 race saw fewer than 50,000 people in attendance, leaving nearly 200,000 empty seats. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the race was held without spectators.

Attendance at the 2024 race exceeded 70,000. This was greater than the most recent races on the oval layout in 2018 and 2019, and more than the 60,000 in attendance for the three races on the road course since then. Additionally, it marked the first year-over-year attendance growth for the Brickyard 400 since 2002.

===Super Weekend===
In 2012, the Brickyard 400 became part of Super Weekend at the Brickyard, consisting of four days of racing on both the oval and the road course. The WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (formerly Grand Am) utilized the road course on Friday for the Brickyard Grand Prix along with the Brickyard Sports Car Challenge for the Continental Tire SportsCar Challenge series. The NASCAR Xfinity Series left IRP and moved to Indy for the Indiana 250. The Brickyard 400 continued to headline on Sunday.

After low attendance, the road course races were removed from the schedule after 2014. By 2016, with races only on the oval for the Xfinity and Cup Series, the &quot;Super Weekend&quot; moniker was dropped.

===Realignment===
NASCAR realigned the three Midwestern races for the 2018 schedule, so that Chicagoland and Kentucky would be held two weeks apart in July, while Indianapolis moved to September, on a date historically known for the Harvest Auto Racing Classic in 1916. Distanced on the calendar from the other nearby races, and serving as the important final race before the NASCAR playoffs, race organizers looked for a boost in attendance. The expectations are that it will be conducted in cooler weather, and with the crowning of the regular season champion, and the last chance for prospective drivers to make the 16-driver playoff field, there is anticipation for renewed interest in the event. In 2018, however, rain moved through the area, completely washing out practice and qualifying, and postponed the race until Monday. Roughly 15,000-20,000 spectators were in attendance for Monday. The 400 also brought along a brand-new race, the Bryan Clauson Classic, a United States Auto Club Midget Car Championship event, on a new dirt track built in the infield near Turn 3.

The events expanded the 400 to a five-day event, with the Midgets racing on Wednesday and Thursday before the Friday-Sunday events of the NASCAR series. The Bryan Clauson Classic features two events, the 25-lap Stoops Pursuit and the 39-lap Driven2SaveLives BC39. The 2018 race featured a field of 118 cars. The Pursuit features all heat race winners and the drivers with the most passing points among non-winners in a 25-lap race where drivers must pass other cars or be eliminated at the end of each of the first four segments. After four five-lap segments, the remaining drivers will participate in a five-lap race for the win. The 39-lap Clauson event, named for an organ donor charity in Clauson&#x27;s memory, features heat races and last-chance races similar to the Chili Bowl in its format. Those with the most passing points advance to the feature, while others must race their way in through preliminary night races.

In 2020, the Brickyard 400 was scheduled for Independence Day weekend, part of substantial changes to the NASCAR calendar. After only two seasons as the final race of the NASCAR regular season, the race will move back to mid-summer. The Coke Zero 400 at Daytona International Speedway took the slot as the final race before the NASCAR playoffs. The Brickyard 400 took the July 4 weekend slot the Coke Zero 400 traditionally utilized since 1959, which originally was designed to have been a USAC Indycar race at Daytona but was cancelled after the death of George Amick in a 100-mile Indycar race at Daytona earlier in the year.

Due to scheduling changes for its season resulting from the coronavirus pandemic, the IndyCar Series announced that it would move its GMR Grand Prix — a road course race normally held prior to the 500 — to the Brickyard 400 weekend. It will join the Xfinity Series race (which will also move to the road course for the 2020 season) as part of a rare double-header on July 4. Tony Stewart envisioned the theoretical possibility of pulling quadruple duty for the Clauson Classic, IndyCar, and NASCAR events in the same weekend. However, the pandemic caused the Clauson Classic to be cancelled.

Starting in 2021, IMS dropped the race in favor of using the road course configuration of the speedway for NASCAR events. As a result, the July 4 weekend spot it held was occupied by Road America and the race was changed to the Verizon 200 at the Brickyard.

==Race recaps==
===1994–1999===

1994: The first running of the Brickyard 400 in 1994 saw the largest crowd to date to witness a NASCAR event, and the single largest race purse to date. Rick Mast won the pole position, and became the first stock car driver to lead a lap at Indy. Young second-year driver Jeff Gordon took the lead late in the race after Ernie Irvan suffered a flat tire. Gordon drove on to a historic win in NASCAR&#x27;s debut at Indy. In an effort to attract more entries, the event was concurrently included on the NASCAR Winston West schedule. No Winston West competitors qualified on speed, but point leader Mike Chase made the field via a Winston West provisional. Gordon&#x27;s inaugural Brickyard 400 winning car (nicknamed &quot;Booger&quot;) is on display at the Hendrick Motorsports museum.

1995: Second-round qualification was rained out on Friday, and only a short &quot;happy hour&quot; practice followed. On Saturday, rain delayed the start of the race until late in the afternoon. Dale Earnhardt cruised to victory, in a race that was slowed only once for four laps under yellow. Rusty Wallace and Dale Jarrett battled close over the final 20 laps for second, with Wallace holding off the challenge.

1996: Dale Jarrett and his Robert Yates Racing crew began the tradition of the winning driver and crew kissing the row of bricks at the start-finish line, which has carried over to the Indianapolis 500. The race saw several blown tires after the speedway removed some rumble strips from the apron of the corners; Kyle Petty was injured when he blew a tire, slammed into the outside and inside wall off turn four, and was T-boned by Sterling Marlin. Johnny Benson led the most laps (70), but faded to 8th at the finish. Jarrett became the first driver to win both the Daytona 500 and Brickyard 400 in the same year. After injuries suffered at Talladega, defending race winner Dale Earnhardt was relieved by Mike Skinner on lap 7, who drove to a 15th-place finish.

1997: In the final twenty laps, Dale Jarrett, Jeff Gordon, and Mark Martin held the top three spots, but none of the three would be able to make it to the finish without one final pit stop for fuel. Jeff Burton and Ricky Rudd also were close on fuel. On lap 145, Robby Gordon brushed the wall, and Burton ran over debris. Burton was forced to pit under green, but as he was finishing his stop, the caution came out. Burton flew out of the pits to beat the leaders, and for a moment it appeared he was in the cat bird&#x27;s seat with four fresh tires, and would be the leader after all other drivers cycled through their stops. However, he was penalized for speeding while exiting the pit lane, and dropped to 15th. Ricky Rudd was among a few drivers who stayed out, and his gamble put him in the lead. Rudd drove the final 46 laps without a pit stop to take the victory, and is to-date, the only owner/driver ever to win the Brickyard 400.

1998: Jeff Gordon became the first repeat winner, holding off Mark Martin for the win. Dale Jarrett dominated the second 100 miles of the race but lost his chance near the halfway point when he ran out of fuel, and coasted back to the pits; he lost four laps but made them up due to numerous cautions. Gordon&#x27;s victory was the first in the Winston No Bull 5 program.

1999: Late in the race, Dale Jarrett leads, but fourth-place Bobby Labonte is the only car in the top five that can go the distance without pitting for fuel. A caution comes out with 17 laps to go, allowing the leaders to pit, foiling Labonte&#x27;s chances to steal the win. As the leaders pitted, in an unexpected move, Dale Jarrett took on only two tires. Jeff Burton saw this and pulled away after taking only two tires. His pit crew, however, had already tried to loosen the lug nuts on the left side. Jarrett led the rest of the way, becomes the second two-time winner, and erases his heartbreak from 1998.

===2000s===
2000: Rusty Wallace led 114 laps, and was leading late in the race when Bobby Labonte charged down the backstretch. Labonte took the lead at the stripe, and pulled away for the win. The race was slowed by only 2 cautions for 7 laps.

2001: With 25 laps to go, Jeff Gordon passed Sterling Marlin on a restart, and pulled away for the win. Gordon became the first 3-time winner of the Brickyard 400.

2002: Kurt Busch and Jimmy Spencer, locked in a burgeoning feud dating back to Bristol, collided on lap 36. Busch hit the turn 3 wall. Veteran Bill Elliott added the Brickyard to his long resume, and Rusty Wallace finished second for the third time.

2003: With 16 laps to go, Kevin Harvick used lap traffic to get by Matt Kenseth on a restart. A huge pileup occurred in turn three, and Harvick held off over the final ten laps to become the first driver to win the race from the pole position.

2004: For the first time in NASCAR Cup Series history, the Green-white-checkered finish rule caused a race to be extended, in this case for one additional lap. On the extra lap, Casey Mears blew a tire, Ricky Rudd hit the wall, then Mark Martin and Dale Earnhardt Jr. suffered tire failures. Jeff Gordon retained the lead to become the first four-time winner of the Brickyard. Gordon joined A. J. Foyt, Al Unser Sr., and Rick Mears as four-time winners at Indianapolis.

2005: Hometown favorite Tony Stewart won his first race at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, and climbed the catch fence to celebrate, in the same fashion as Hélio Castroneves.

2006: After suffering a blown front left tire early in the race that caused some fender damage, Jimmie Johnson passed Dale Earnhardt Jr. with six laps left to win at Indy for the first time and became only the second driver to win both the Daytona 500 and Brickyard 400 in the same year. The first was Dale Jarrett in 1996.

2007: Juan Pablo Montoya became the first (and, to date, only) driver to race in all three of the major events hosted by the Indianapolis Motor Speedway (Indy 500, Brickyard 400, and the U.S.G.P.). Montoya, a rookie in the NASCAR Cup Series, finished second to Tony Stewart. Stewart&#x27;s 2007 winning car is owned and on rotating display at the Speedway museum.

2008: The Car of Tomorrow was used at Indy for the first time. The Goodyear tires suffered bad wear patterns, causing blowouts in some cases after only ten laps of green-flag racing. Lengthy competition cautions were put out at roughly 10-lap intervals for teams to change tires, which caused controversy and angered fans and media. Jimmie Johnson managed to tame the tire problems by winning for the second time in his career at Indy, holding off a mild challenge from Carl Edwards.

2009: Former Indy 500 winner Juan Pablo Montoya dominated most of the race, leading 116 laps. However, with 35 laps to go, Montoya was penalized (not without protest and a heated rant) for speeding in the pits. The infraction left Jimmie Johnson holding off polesitter Mark Martin for the victory. Johnson became the second three-time winner, and the first back–to–back winner of the Brickyard 400.

===2010s===
2010: 2000 Indianapolis 500 winner Juan Pablo Montoya dominated most of the race for the second year in a row, leading a total of 86 laps. However, he gave up the lead when he took 4 tires in a late pit stop. He would restart 7th with 18 laps to go and was unable to recover. Montoya crashed with 16 to go and before the caution came out, Kevin Harvick had passed Jamie McMurray for the lead. On the final restart, McMurray passed Harvick to go on to win the 400. This made him become the third driver to win the Daytona 500 and the Brickyard 400 during the same season, following Dale Jarrett in 1996 and Jimmie Johnson in 2006. McMurray&#x27;s win also gave his team owner Chip Ganassi wins in the Daytona 500, the Indianapolis 500, and the Brickyard 400 all in the same season, making him the first team owner to do so.

2011: The final caution came out on lap 121 with Brad Keselowski out in front. With 39 laps to go, it would be difficult for the leaders to make it to the finish on fuel if they pit under the yellow. Since race laps at Indy are in the 51-second range, and a pit stop (including entering and exiting the pit lane) takes upwards of 40–45 seconds, green flag pits stops are not necessarily discouraged, unlike other circuits. Among the drivers who pitted on lap 123 was Paul Menard. After the green came back out, Jeff Gordon pitted on lap 134. As the leaders shuffled through their final pit stops, Menard took over the lead on lap 145. Meanwhile, Gordon, with two new tires, dramatically began charging through the field and was quickly in the top ten before moving up to 2nd position on lap 158. With now less than two laps to go, Menard stretched his fuel and held off Gordon on the last lap to score his first career Cup victory. Menard is the only driver to-date to have scored his first career Cup Series win at the Brickyard.

2012: The final caution came out on lap 130 with Jimmie Johnson leading. Over the final 20 laps, Johnson held off Kyle Busch and Greg Biffle to tie Jeff Gordon with four Brickyard 400 victories. Along with Gordon in NASCAR, Johnson also joined A. J. Foyt, Al Unser Sr., and Rick Mears as the only 4-time winners in the entire history of Indianapolis

2013: During his final pit stop, Jimmie Johnson took on four tires when a lug nut broke loose. His stop lasted 17.4 seconds. Ryan Newman pitted a lap later. Aware of Johnson&#x27;s struggles, Newman took on two tires. Newman emerged with a 7-second lead over Johnson with 16 laps to go. Johnson closed to within 2 seconds, but fell short as Newman held on for the victory.

2014: The race was served as its last air with ESPN, With 17 laps to go, Jeff Gordon passed Kasey Kahne on a restart on the outside of turn one to take the lead for the final time. Twenty years after winning the inaugural Brickyard 400, Gordon won the race for a record 5th time.

2015: The race was first aired on NBCSN. Kyle Busch won his first Brickyard 400, holding off Joey Logano in a green–white–checkered finish. Busch swept the weekend, winning also the Xfinity race on Saturday. Attention for the weekend was focused heavily on a new &quot;high-drag&quot; aerodynamic rules package implemented to improve competition. Jeff Gordon, racing for the final time at the Brickyard, was involved in a spin on lap 50, brushed the wall, and placed 42nd. With Logano&#x27;s second place, Team Penske – still winless in the Brickyard 400 – finished 2nd for the fourth time.

2016: Jeff Gordon came from retirement to fill in for Dale Earnhardt Jr., who was recovering from a concussion, Kyle Busch won his second Brickyard 400, holding off the field in overtime and also winning the Xfinity race for a second year in a row.

2017: In the first Brickyard 400 to include stage racing, the first two stages were dominated by Kyle Busch. However, he was involved in an accident with Martin Truex Jr. on lap 111 following a restart that took out both cars. During the final stage, darkness began to become a factor following a red flag for rain early in the race, and two additional red flags for cleaning up following multiple wrecks. It appeared that Trevor Bayne, who was gambling on fuel mileage, was headed for his second career Cup Series win; but a caution came out at lap 150 that foiled his plan. Kasey Kahne had just pitted for fresh tires and fuel moments before the caution came out, and used that to take the lead after everyone else pitted. Kahne was able to stay in front for the first attempt at a restart finish, but was overtaken by Brad Keselowski on the second of these restarts. The caution came out again for Bayne and others crashing on the frontstretch. This brought another restart, but with Keselowski as the control car and Kahne second. Kahne amazingly managed to outrun Keselowski into the first corner and down the backstretch, and took the victory in overtime for his first win since 2014 when the caution came out yet again, this time for Denny Hamlin spinning into the wall, but as they had crossed the overtime line at the end of the straight, the race was finalized under yellow. This was the tenth victory for Hendrick Motorsports in the Brickyard 400. The race was the longest running event at Indianapolis Motor Speedway since the 1913 Indianapolis 500 due to rain delays, red flags, and crashes that causes the lengthening of the race.

2018: Rain washed out all practice and qualifying, postponing the race until Monday. Points leader Kyle Busch started on the pole, and the field of forty cars took the green flag without having turned a single practice lap. On fresher tires, Brad Keselowski passed second place Clint Bowyer on a restart with three laps to go. With less than two laps to go Keselowski caught Denny Hamlin, going side by side down the backstretch and into turn three. Keselowski took the lead coming off of turn four, and won the first Brickyard 400 for Penske Racing.

2019: A new format saw qualifying on Sunday morning, with the race held Sunday afternoon, and Kevin Harvick won the pole. Kyle Busch, who had already clinched the regular season title the previous week at Darlington, looked strong early on, but lost his engine just beyond the halfway point. Brad Keselowski was running in the top ten when Erik Jones dove hard to the inside causing both to hit the wall, with Keselowski hitting a tire barrier off of turn two landing almost on the passenger side. Jimmie Johnson failed to make the Playoffs for the first time in his career after crashing late in the race. Harvick led 118 of the 160 laps to take the win. Bubba Wallace, driving for Richard Petty Motorsports, finished third, his second career top five finish. Most of the field suffered significant damage due to collisions on pit road early on in the race. After the race, Harvick and his owner Tony Stewart climbed the fence. It was Harvick&#x27;s second win, and Stewart&#x27;s fourth victory at the event (twice as a driver, and twice as an owner).

===2020s===
2020: For 2020, the race was moved to July 4th weekend. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the race was held without spectators. Furthermore, the event became a doubleheader weekend. The IndyCar Series GMR Grand Prix and the Pennzoil 150 for the Xfinity Series were held on the combined road course on Saturday, with the Brickyard 400 on the oval on Sunday. The start of the race was delayed about an hour due to lightning in the area, then a crash in the pits brought out a red flag on lap 17. In the final stage, Denny Hamlin led Kevin Harvick and Matt Kenseth. In the closing laps, Hamlin&#x27;s tires were starting to go away. With six laps to go, Hamlin&#x27;s right front tire went down going into turn one, sending him hard into the outside wall. That set up an overtime finish between Harvick and Kenseth. Harvick got the jump on the restart, and cruised to victory, his third overall in the 400. Harvick also became the third driver to win the 400 in back-to-back years. The Bryan Clauson Classic was cancelled because of pandemic restrictions.

2024: After a three-year hiatus (during which time the race was replaced by the Verizon 200 on the road course), the Brickyard 400 returned to the oval. The 2024 race marked the 30th anniversary of the inaugural running in 1994.

===Multiple winners (drivers)===


===Multiple winners (teams)===
===Manufacturer wins===
===Sponsor wins===
===Crown Royal Your Name Here 400 sweepstakes winners===
From 2011 to 2016, Crown Royal was the title sponsor of the race; Under Crown Royal sponsorship, the race was part of Crown Royal &quot;Your Hero&#x27;s Name Here&quot; program, in which the race was named after an armed forces member or first responder nominated by fans. The nominated hero also received a VIP experience for the race, and presented the winner&#x27;s trophy. For the 2016 race, retired Navy SEAL Jason Redman won the nomination. Redman chose to for the race to be named after his charity, the Combat Wounded Coalition, instead, resulting in the race being titled Crown Royal Presents the Combat Wounded Coalition 400 at the Brickyard.

==Pole position winners==

From 1994 to 2000, per NASCAR rules at the time, qualifying was conducted as a single-car, single-lap format utilizing two rounds (over two days). The pole position winner was the faster qualifier during the first round. Note that in 1995, the second of qualifying was rained out, and the entire field reverted to first round speeds. From 2001 to 2013, qualifying was reduced to one round, but remained single-car/single lap. The pole position went to the fastest overall qualifier.

From 2014 to 2018, a knockout-style group qualifying format was used in the NASCAR Cup Series. In mid-2019, the series reverted to single-car qualifying.
* (FQ) – Denotes fastest qualifier; was accomplished during Second-round qualifying
* (TR) – Denotes one-lap stock car oval track record
* 2018 – Qualifying was rained out and the starting lineup was set by championship points
* 2020 – Qualifying was set via a random draw due to the coronavirus pandemic

===Brickyard 400 &amp; Indianapolis 500===
Through 2024, a total of 20 drivers have competed in both the Brickyard 400 and Indianapolis 500. An additional twelve drivers have attempted to qualify for both, but failed to qualify at one or the other, or both races. Juan Pablo Montoya and Jacques Villeneuve are the only two drivers to compete at the Indy 500, Brickyard 400, and U.S. Grand Prix at Indy. Montoya holds the highest finish between the two races, with two wins in the 500 and a second place in the 400. Larry Foyt was the first driver to compete in both races having competed in the 400 &quot;first&quot;; 15 of the 20 other participants competed in the 500 prior to racing in the 400.

Juan Pablo Montoya has also competed in the Brickyard Grand Prix and IndyCar Grand Prix. Two-time Indy 500 pole winner Scott Brayton was initially entered in the 1995 Brickyard 400, but wrecked his car during a private test session. He suffered a broken ankle and a concussion, and withdrew from the event. Geoff Brabham, Larry Foyt, Max Papis, and Bill Elliott have all also competed in the Indy Legends Charity Pro–Am race. Of those four drivers, Elliott, the 2002 Brickyard 400 winner, is the only one to have never driven in the Indy 500 in his career.

Two car owners have swept both the Indianapolis 500 and Brickyard 400 in the same year. Chip Ganassi (Ganassi Racing) won both races in 2010, and Roger Penske (Team Penske) won both in 2018. During his driving career, Ganassi himself made five starts in the 500, but did not compete in any NASCAR races.

The drivers who have raced in both the 500 and 400 in the same year are denoted (**).

Failed to qualify:
*Raced in the 500 but failed to qualify for the 400: Gary Bettenhausen, Pancho Carter, Stan Fox, Andy Hillenburg, Davy Jones, P. J. Jones, Christian Fittipaldi
*Raced in the 400 but failed to qualify for the 500: Casey Mears, Ken Schrader, Scott Speed
*Failed to qualify at both 500 and 400: Charlie Glotzbach, Stanton Barrett

Neil Bonnett, who entered but did not qualify for the 1979 Indianapolis 500, announced plans to enter the 1994 Brickyard 400. However, Bonnett was fatally injured in a crash at Daytona in February 1994, five months before the Brickyard 400 was to be held. Junior Johnson, who entered as a driver but did not qualify for the 1963 Indianapolis 500, was a car owner at the 400 in 1994–1995. Three-time Indy 500 winner Dario Franchitti switched to NASCAR for the 2008 season. However, his team disbanded less than a month before he was expected to enter the 2008 Brickyard 400.

==Pre-race ceremonies==
At the onset of the Brickyard 400 in 1994, track officials were determined to not detract from the traditional nature of the Indianapolis 500, and establish &quot;new traditions&quot; for the Brickyard 400. At its inception, the &quot;400 Festival&quot;, a local civic organization (similar to the 500 Festival in May), was founded to promote the event and organize various events in around the community in the days leading up to the race. After a handful of years, the 400 Festival disbanded. Since the 2000s, the annual Hauler Parade now kicks off the race weekend. The teams transporters parade into the Town of Speedway, and the participants take part in an interactive fan fest with spectators.

Several of the key features of the Indy 500 pre-race traditions were dropped or tweaked. The Purdue band was omitted, in favor of other schools from the state (Indiana State and Indiana University). The song &quot;Back Home Again in Indiana&quot; was decidedly not included, however, Jim Nabors was invited in 1994 to sing the national anthem. Unlike the Indy 500, a celebrity pace car driver is seldom used in NASCAR, and one was not used for the first many years of the Brickyard 400. In more recent years a ceremonial pace car driver has been added. Chevrolet has been the exclusive provider of the pace car (or pace truck) for all editions from 1994 to 2020.

In a slight contrast to the Indy 500, many of the national anthem performers invited have been from country music, as a gesture to NASCAR&#x27;s ties to the south. It also reflects upon one of the event&#x27;s longtime sponsors - Big Machine Records. Contemporary Christian singers have also been invited several times. Traditions that were kept include a balloon release, a flyby, and an invocation (The last two are part of most NASCAR events). Rev. Howard Brammer of Traders Point Christian Church conducted the invocation for every Brickyard 400 from 1994 to 2019, differing from the Indy 500, where the Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Indianapolis is normally invited. In 2020, Mark Schuitema of College Park Church took over the duty.

In 1998, for the first time since 1954, a person gave the starting command at the track who was not a member of the Hulman-George family. The president of NASCAR, Bill France Jr. gave the command, celebrating the 50th anniversary of NASCAR.

* In 2016, Tony Stewart led the field out, but took his spot in the field before the green flag wove.
* In 2018, Carly Pearce was scheduled to sing the national anthem, but the race was rained out and rescheduled for the next day. Big Machine Records artist Payton Smith sang in substitute.

==Television and radio==

===ABC===
From 1994 to 2000, the race was broadcast live on ABC Sports, who had televised the Indianapolis 500 since 1965. ESPN/ESPN2 carried live coverage of practice and qualifying. The race was scheduled for the first Saturday in August, at 12:15 pm EST (1:15 pm EDT). Saturday was chosen for the running of the race to allow for Sunday as a rain date. In the Indianapolis market, the race was blacked out, and aired in same-day tape delay later in the evening.

Prior to the first running, ESPN covered the feasibility tests in both 1992 and 1993 through its &quot;SpeedWeek&quot; program. During the 1992 test, ESPN utilized on-board footage from inside Kyle Petty&#x27;s car, captured from Petty&#x27;s personal video camera. During the summer leading up to the 1994 race, ESPN broadcast a series of preview shows titled &quot;Road to the Brickyard.&quot;

In 1995, rain delayed the start until 4:25 EST (5:25 EDT). ABC had already signed off, and made the decision to air the race via tape delay on ESPN the following day. In the greater Indianapolis area, the race was shown tape delay that night at 7 pm on WRTV as planned. The 1995 race ran until 7:03 pm EST (8:03 pm EDT), which was believed to be the second-latest time of day cars have ever driven on the track.
* Note: Paul Page served as pre-race host in 1994–1996.

===NBC/TNT===
From 2001 to 2006, the race was broadcast on NBC, as part of a new eight-year, $2.4-billion centralized television deal involving FOX/FX and NBC/TNT. The race was moved from Saturday to Sunday, and the start time was moved to 1:45 pm EST (2:45 pm EDT). In 2006, Indiana began observing Daylight Saving Time, and the race was scheduled for 2:45 pm EDT.

After switching to NBC and the centralized television contract, the local blackout policy was lifted. During this contract, TNT carried pole qualifying live. The final &quot;Happy Hour&quot; practice was carried live on CNN/SI in 2001, and on Speed from 2002 to 2006.
* Notes: Bill Weber served as pre-race host on the NBC &quot;War Wagon&quot; from 2001 to 2004, and in the booth in 2005–2006.

===ESPN===
From 2007 to 2014, under the terms of a new $4.48-billion contract, television rights were held by ESPN. The race swapped dates with the Pennsylvania 500, and effectively moved up one weekend. The change was made so that ESPN/ABC could kick off their NASCAR coverage with the more-attractive telecast. The move to cable drew some mild controversy after thirteen years of having been on network television. The starting time was slightly earlier than in the past, at 2:30 pm EDT. Practice and qualifying are carried by ESPN, ESPN2, and Speed.

In 2009–2014, the race was advertised on ESPN as Brickyard 400 presented by Golden Corral. The different name is due to a standing policy by NASCAR to not mention the race&#x27;s title sponsor on-air more than the required twice per hour unless an advertising premium is paid to the network.

===NBCSN/NBC===
Under the terms of a new $2.7 billion television deal from 2015 to 2024, the race is part of the &quot;NASCAR on NBC&quot; package. In 2015 and 2016, the race aired live on NBCSN. In 2017, as a deal with broadcasting changes, the race aired on NBC.

Also in 2015 and again in 2016, the race was advertised on NBCSN as NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Racing from the Brickyard Presented by Golden Corral, with the Golden Corral sponsorship being transferred from ESPN. Crown Royal has never paid the advertising premiums required by the network broadcasting the race to be mentioned as title sponsor of the race, either to ESPN/ABC or to NBC. In 2017, the race aired on NBC, returning to a broadcast network for the first time since 2006. The race moved back to NBCSN in 2018 before returning to NBC for its final two years (2019 and 2020).

===Radio===
All races have been broadcast on radio through the IMS Radio Network. Since 2004, Performance Racing Network has co-produced the race. Doug Rice, who is the chief announcer for PRN, currently anchors the broadcast, with PRN staff joining with IMS during the race broadcast.

From 1994 to 1999, Mike Joy anchored the broadcast. From 2000 to 2003, Mike King served as chief announcer. In 2004, Doug Rice joined King as co-anchor. In 2007–2008, the co-anchors were Doug Rice and Bob Jenkins. In 2009, Jenkins moved to Versus for IndyCar, and as a result, Chris Denari took over as co-anchor with Doug Rice.

<doc id="681315" wikidata="Q1363205" url="?curid=681315" title="Henry of Blois">
<text>Henry of Blois ( 1096 8 August 1171), often known as Henry of Winchester, was Abbot of Glastonbury Abbey from 1126, and Bishop of Winchester from 1129 to his death.

He was the son of Stephen II, Count of Blois and Adela of Normandy, a younger brother of Stephen, King of England, and a grandson of William the Conqueror. Henry was also a major patron of the arts, funding the Winchester Bible and the font in Winchester Cathedral. He founded the Hospital of St Cross and built much of Wolvesey Castle.

==Early life and education==
Henry was one of five sons of Stephen II, Count of Blois, by Adela of Normandy (daughter of William the Conqueror) and the younger brother of King Stephen. His birth date is uncertain, along with his siblings but he was the 4th or youngest son and he was most likely born at Blois c.1096, before his father left on the first crusade, or possibly c.1100, soon after his father&#x27;s return. Henry&#x27;s father died in 1102 while on crusade during the Second Battle of Ramla, leaving an estate with more than 350 castles and large properties in France including Chartres.

Henry was educated at Cluny and adhered to the principles of Cluniac reform, which included a sense of intellectual freedom and humanism, as well as a high standard of devotion and discipline.

==Abbot and bishop==
Henry was brought to England by King Henry I, to be Abbot of Glastonbury. On 4 October 1129, he was given the bishopric of Winchester and allowed to keep his beloved Glastonbury Abbey. He was consecrated bishop on 17 November 1129. He had ambitions to become Archbishop of Canterbury but refused to abandon his work and obligations to Glastonbury. Soon after his appointment to the see of Winchester, Henry came to resent his subservience to Canterbury. He therefore set about building a powerbase to persuade the king to create a third, West Country archdiocese with himself at the head. This scheme was unsuccessful. However, on 1 March 1139, during the reign of his brother Stephen, Henry obtained a commission as papal legate, which gave him higher rank than Theobald of Bec, Archbishop of Canterbury, making him the most powerful figure in the English Church during the troubled times of The Anarchy. Thus, when his brother was unavailable, Henry of Blois was the most powerful and wealthiest man in England.

Stephen of Blois was crowned King of England in 1135, but the relations between the two brothers were not always peaceful. After the Battle of Lincoln in 1141, Henry found it more advantageous to support Empress Matilda; but later found her arrogant and greedy. Later that year, Henry rejoined his brother&#x27;s side and, with the help of Queen Matilda and an army commanded by William of Ypres, his successful defence of Winchester against the Empress was the turning point of the civil war. As Abbot of Glastonbury, Henry remained in contact with Peter the Venerable at Cluny and was made aware of most of the controversies on the continent, specifically the persecution of Peter Abelard (whom Peter the Venerable defended) and the translation of the Koran from Arabic to Latin (which Peter the Venerable commissioned).

==Architecture==
Before and after his elevation to Bishop, Henry of Blois was an advisor to his brother Stephen and survived him. Henry of Blois engineered hundreds of projects, including villages and canals, abbeys and smaller churches. He was most proud of his contributions to the greatest developments at Glastonbury Abbey, long before the destructive fire of 1184. Like most great bishops of his age, Henry had a passion for architecture. He built the final additions to Winchester Cathedral and Wolvesey Castle in Winchester, including a tourist tunnel under the cathedral to make it easier for pilgrims to view relics. He also designed and built additions to many palaces and large houses including the castle of Farnham, Surrey and began the construction of the Hospital of St Cross at Winchester. In London he built Winchester Palace as a residence for the bishops of Winchester. In Rome, John of Salisbury reported, he acquired an impressive number of ancient Roman sculptures, defending his purchases as preventing the Romans of his day from worshipping these &quot;idols&quot;.

Henry was responsible for building six castles in 1138, namely those at Bishop&#x27;s Waltham, Downton, Farnham, Merdon, Taunton, and Wolvesey. Contemporaries were surprised that a bishop would be such a prolific builder of fortification. Much of Henry&#x27;s work was undone in 1155, when the new king, Henry II, ordered that his castles be thrown down.

==Literature==
Henry was also enamoured of books and their distribution. He wrote or sponsored several books including &quot;On the Antiquity of the Glastonbury Church&quot; by William of Malmesbury, a close personal friend. He sponsored the Winchester Bible, the largest illustrated Bible ever produced. It is a huge folio edition standing nearly three feet in height. This Bible is still on display at Winchester, although it was never fully finished. His production of the Winchester Psalter, also known as the &quot;Blois Psalter&quot;, is preserved in the British Library and is considered a British National Treasure.

==Later years and death==

The expiration of Henry&#x27;s legatine commission when Pope Innocent II died on 23 September 1143 deprived him of much of his power. His efforts to renew the commission were unsuccessful, but he made a personal visit to Rome and secured several favours for Glastonbury and the Benedictine order in general. Shortly after his brother&#x27;s death and the accession of Henry II, the bishop retired to Cluny, where he had sent much treasure, for at least two years and mourned there his mentor Peter the Venerable, who died on Christmas Day, 1156.

In his later years, he was among the bishops forced to agree to the Constitutions of Clarendon in January 1164, which paved the way for the Becket Controversy. He was also appointed to preside over the trial of Thomas Becket and secretly supported Becket&#x27;s family before and after his assassination.

Henry died on 8 August 1171. Among his gifts to Cluny, was a pyx set with gems in the choir. Henry of Blois is now buried in Winchester Cathedral in a plain stone crypt in the choir, but there is a controversy because some sources claim he was buried at Cluny. Recent research indicates he was also entombed for a time in a small church (St Mary the Virgin) at Ivinghoe, Buckinghamshire. One explanation describes his heart enshrined at Cluny while his corpse and other artifacts were moved from Ivinghoe to Winchester in the 17th century. For many years his sarcophagus was thought to be that of William II, son of William the Conqueror. In the &quot;Antiquities&quot;, William of Malmesbury who knew the bishop well, described him, saying, &quot;Yet, in spite of his noble birth he blushes when praised.&quot;

<text>The term racial hygiene was used to describe an approach to eugenics in the early 20th century, which found its most extensive implementation in Nazi Germany (Nazi eugenics). It was marked by efforts to avoid miscegenation, analogous to an animal breeder seeking purebred animals. This was often motivated by the belief in the existence of a racial hierarchy and the related fear that &quot;lower races&quot; would &quot;contaminate&quot; a &quot;higher&quot; one. As with most eugenicists at the time, racial hygienists believed that the lack of eugenics would lead to rapid social degeneration, the decline of civilization by the spread of inferior characteristics.

== Development ==
The German eugenicist Alfred Ploetz introduced the term &quot;racial hygiene&quot; (&#x27;) in 1895 in his &quot;Racial Hygiene Basics&quot; (&#x27;). He discussed the importance of avoiding &quot;counterselective forces&quot; such as war, inbreeding, free healthcare for the poor, alcohol and venereal disease. In its earliest incarnation it was more concerned by the declining birthrate of the German state and the increasing number of mentally-ill and disabled people in state-run institutions (and their costs to the state) than it was by the &quot;Jewish question&quot; and the &quot;degeneration of the Nordic race&quot; (&quot;&quot;) which would come to dominate its philosophy in Germany from the 1920s to the Second World War.

During the last years of the 19th century, the German racial hygienists Alfred Ploetz and Wilhelm Schallmayer regarded certain people as inferior, and they opposed their ability to procreate. These theorists believed that all human behaviors, including crime, alcoholism and divorce, were caused by genetics.

== Nazi Germany ==

During the 1930s and 1940s, institutes in Nazi Germany studied genetics, created genetic registries and researched twins. Nazi scientists also studied blood, and developed theories on the supposed racial specificity of blood types, with the goal of distinguishing an &quot;Aryan&quot; from a Jew by examining their blood. In the 1940s, Josef Mengele, a doctor in the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (&quot;SS&quot;), provided human remains that were taken from Auschwitzblood, limbs and other body partsto be studied at the institutes. Harnessing racial hygiene as a justification, the scientists used prisoners from Auschwitz and other concentration camps as test subjects for their human experiments.

Theories on racial hygiene led to an elaborate sterilization program, with the goal of eliminating what the Nazis regarded as diseases harmful to the human race. Sterilized individuals, reasoned the Nazis, would not pass on their diseases to their children. The Sterilization Law, passed on July 14, 1933, also known as the Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring, called for the sterilization of any person who had a genetically determined illness. The Sterilization Law was drafted by some of Germany&#x27;s top racial hygienists, including: Fritz Lenz, Alfred Ploetz, Ernst Rudin, Heinrich Himmler, Gerhard Wagner and Fritz Thyssen. Robert N. Proctor has shown that the list of illnesses which the law targeted included &quot;feeblemindedness, schizophrenia, manic depression, epilepsy, Huntington&#x27;s chorea, genetic blindness, and &#x27;severe alcoholism.&#x27;&quot; The estimated number of citizens who were sterilized in Nazi Germany ranges from 350,000 to 400,000. As a result of the Sterilization Law, sterilization medicine and research soon became one of the largest medical industries.In Nazi propaganda, the term &quot;race&quot; was often interchangeably used to mean the &quot;Aryan&quot; or Germanic &quot;&quot;, which was said to represent an ideal and pure master race that was biologically superior to all other races. In the 1930s, under eugenicist Ernst Rüdin, National Socialist ideology embraced this latter use of &quot;racial hygiene&quot;, which demanded Aryan racial purity and condemned miscegenation. That belief in the importance of German racial purity often served as the theoretical backbone of Nazi policies of racial superiority and later genocide. The policies began in 1935, when the National Socialists enacted the Nuremberg Laws, which legislated racial purity by forbidding sexual relations and marriages between Aryans and non-Aryans as &quot;Rassenschande&quot; (racial shame).

Racial hygienists played key roles in the Holocaust, the German National Socialist effort to purge Europe of Jews, Romani people, Slavs, Blacks, mixed race people, and physically or intellectually disabled people. In the &quot;Aktion T4&quot; program, Hitler ordered the execution of mentally-ill patients by euthanasia under the cover of deaths from strokes and illnesses. The methods and equipment that had been used in the murder of thousands of mentally ill persons were then transferred to concentration camps, because the materials and resources needed to efficiently murder large numbers of people existed and had been proven successful. The nurses and the staff who had assisted and performed the killings were then moved along with the gas chambers to the concentration camps, which were being built in order to be able to replicate the mass murders repeatedly.

The doctors who carried out experiments on the prisoners in concentration camps specialised in racial hygiene and used the supposed science to back their medical experiments. Some of the experiments were used for general medical research, for example by injecting prisoners with known diseases to test vaccines or possible cures. Other experiments were used to further the Germans&#x27; war strategy by putting prisoners in vacuum chambers to see what could happen to pilots&#x27; bodies if they were ejected at a high altitude or immerse prisoners in ice water to see how long they would survive and what materials could be used to prolong life if worn by German pilots shot down over the English Channel. The precursors of this notion were earlier medical experiments which German doctors performed on African prisoners of war in concentration camps in Namibia during the Herero and Namaqua Genocide.

A key aspect of National Socialism was the concept of racial hygiene and it was elevated to the primary philosophy of the German medical community, first by activist physicians within the medical profession, particularly amongst psychiatrists. That was later codified and institutionalized during and after the Nazis&#x27; rise to power in 1933, during the process of &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot; (literally, &quot;coordination&quot; or &quot;unification&quot;), which streamlined the medical and mental hygiene (mental health) profession into a rigid hierarchy with National Socialist-sanctioned leadership at the top.

The blueprint for Nazism&#x27;s attitude toward other races was written by Erwin Baur, Fritz Lenz, and Eugen Fischer and published under the title &quot;Human Heredity Theory and Racial Hygiene&quot; (1936).

== After World War II ==
After World War II, the idea of &quot;racial hygiene&quot; was denounced as unscientific by many, but there continued to be supporters and enforcers of eugenics even after there was widespread awareness of the nature of Nazi eugenics. After 1945, eugenics proponents included Julian Huxley and Marie Stopes, but they typically removed or downplayed the racial aspects of their theories.

<text>Global Goon is a former British programmer from Lydiate, England who earned a recording contract with Rephlex Records.

Global Goon has also been rumored to have released five acid records under the alias Syntheme on both Planet Mu and WéMè between 2007 and 2009, but this remains unconfirmed and Syntheme is also known as Louise Helena Wood, from Brighton, England.

Music critics have characterized Global Goon&#x27;s style as ambient music and &quot;easy listening fusion&quot;. From Bessemer Cocktail and after, his music took a turn towards acid house rather than the easy listening downtempo.

<doc id="681324" wikidata="Q5298117" url="?curid=681324" title="Dorneywood">
<text>Dorneywood is an 18th-century house near Burnham in southern Berkshire. Originally a Georgian farmhouse, it has Victorian and later additions, and following a fire in 1910, was remodelled in 1919 by Sir Robert Lorimer. It is a Grade II listed building.

It was given to the National Trust by Lord Courtauld-Thomson in 1947 as a grace-and-favour country home for a senior member of the Government, usually a Secretary of State or Minister of the Crown. The Dorneywood Trust has the objective of &#x27;maintaining the mansion house and gardens of Dorneywood&#x27;.

==Occupancy of the house==
The Prime Minister alone has the right to decide which Minister or Secretary of State is to occupy the house. In previous administrations it has been the residence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and, prior to 31 May 2006, was occupied by Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott. Prescott was forced to relinquish occupancy of Dorneywood, following a series of scandals over an affair with civil servant Tracey Temple and a snatched paparazzi photograph of him playing croquet on the lawn of the property whilst the Prime Minister Tony Blair was out of the country on a visit to Washington. However, given the controversies over John Prescott&#x27;s use of the house, senior politicians were reluctant to use it. The house was eventually taken over by Alistair Darling, Chancellor of the Exchequer when Gordon Brown became Prime Minister in 2007. &quot;A spokesman for Mr Brown ... explained that the house ... was owned by a trust, and would revert first to the Lord Mayor of London and then to the American Ambassador, if the Chancellor did not want it.&quot;

Various former Prime Ministers (before achieving the premiership) have occupied the house, among them Anthony Eden. On becoming Prime Minister, Alec Douglas-Home was reluctant to forsake the more comfortable and modern Dorneywood for the antique splendours of Chequers. Another, James Callaghan as Foreign Secretary, also had the use of Dorneywood (later Chevening was to become the official country home for the holder of that office).

In 2010, George Osborne, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, took occupancy of the house. It was also used by Osborne&#x27;s successors, Philip Hammond, Sajid Javid, and Rishi Sunak.

==Interior==

The interior of the house contains some decorations by Rex Whistler, as well as paintings and furniture belonging to the Government Art Collection. There is also furniture belonging to the National Trust.

==Grounds==
The National Trust arranges public tours of the house and gardens during the summer. The estate consists of the house and of parkland, woodland and farmland. The grounds are noted for their cottage and kitchen garden, as well as their herbaceous borders and rose displays. The upkeep of the estate is in part supported by the Dorneywood Thomson Endowment Trust Fund.

<doc id="681327" wikidata="Q1123788" url="?curid=681327" title="Microsoft Works">
<text>Microsoft Works is a discontinued productivity software suite developed by Microsoft and sold from 1987 to 2009. Its core functionality includes a word processor, a spreadsheet and a database management system. Later versions have a calendar application and a dictionary while older releases include a terminal emulator. Works is available as a standalone program and as part of a namesake home productivity suite. Because of its low cost, companies frequently preinstalled Works on their low-cost machines. Works is smaller, less expensive, and has fewer features than contemporary major office suites such as Microsoft Office.

Mainstream support for the final standalone and suite release ended on October 9, 2012, and January 8, 2013, respectively. 

==History==
Microsoft Works originated as MouseWorks, an integrated spreadsheet, word processor, and database program, designed for the Macintosh by ex-Apple employee Don Williams and Rupert Lissner. Williams planned to emulate the success of AppleWorks, a similar product for Apple II computers. Bill Gates and his Head of Acquisitions, Alan M. Boyd, convinced Williams in 1986 to license the product to Microsoft instead. Initially intended as a scaled-down version of Office for small laptops like TRS-80 Model 100, which was developed by Microsoft and sold by Radio Shack, Microsoft Works evolved as a popular product in its own right as laptops grew in power.

On September 14, 1987, Microsoft unveiled Works for DOS. The initial version 1.x of Works ran on any PC with at least 256k of memory. Works 2.x, introduced in 1990, required 512k and 3.x, introduced in 1992, required 640k.

In 1991, Microsoft issued the first Windows version of Works, titled MS Works for Windows 2.0. System requirements include Windows 3.0, a 286 CPU, and 1MB of memory. Works 3.x in 1993 requires Windows 3.1, a 386 CPU, and 4MB of memory. Subsequent releases are for Windows 95 and up, and the final version is Works 9.x in 2007, requiring Windows XP or Vista, 256MB of memory, and a Pentium 4 CPU.

Microsoft released Macintosh versions of Works starting with Works 2.0 in 1988. The version numbering roughly follows that of Windows releases.

Through version 4.5a, Works uses a monolithic program architecture whereby its word processor, spreadsheet and database documents run in windows of the same program interface. This results in a small memory and disk footprint, which enables it to run on slower computers with requirements as low as 6 MB of RAM and 12 MB free disk space. It also provides a mini version of Excel for DOS systems as a DOS version of that program is not available. Works 2000 (Version 5.0) switches to a modular architecture which opens each document as a separate instance and uses the print engine from Internet Explorer.

Version 9.0, the final version, is available in two editions: an advertisement-free version, available in retail and for OEMs, and an ad-supported free version (Works SE) which was available only to OEMs for preinstallation on new computers.

In late 2009, Microsoft announced it would discontinue Works and replace it with Office 2010 Starter Edition, although it replaced only the word processor and spreadsheet components but not the calendar or the database.

==Features==
Microsoft Works has built-in compatibility for the Microsoft Office document formats ( and ), including, but not limited to, the ability of the Works Word Processor to open Microsoft Word documents and the ability of the Works Spreadsheet to open Microsoft Excel workbooks. In the final version (Version 9.0), the Windows 95-era icons and toolbars are not updated to make them consistent with later application software.

While its utility for larger organizations is limited by its use of incompatible proprietary native (spreadsheet), (database), and (word processor) file formats, the simplicity of integrating database/spreadsheet data into word processor documents (e.g., mail merge) allow it to remain an option for some small and home-based business owners. Version 4.5a is particularly noted in this respect. The database management system, while a &quot;flat file&quot; (i.e., non-relational) allows the novice user to perform complex transformations through formulas (which use standard algebraic syntax and can be self-referential) and user-defined reports that can be copied as text to the clipboard. A &#x27;Works Portfolio&#x27; utility offers Microsoft Binder-like functionality.

By installing the 2007 Office System Compatibility Pack, the Works Word Processor and Spreadsheet can import and export Office Open XML document formats, although they will be converted rather than being operated upon natively. The Works Calendar can store appointments, integrates with the Windows Address Book, as well as Address Book&#x27;s successor, Windows Contacts, and can remind users of birthdays and anniversaries. It supports importing and exporting iCalendar () files. It does not support subscribing to iCalendar files or publishing them online via WebDAV. Up to version 8, using the Works Task Launcher, the calendar and contacts from Windows Address Book could be synchronized with portable devices. In Works 9.0, the sync capability has been removed.

==File format compatibility and other issues==
Microsoft (sometime in the past) made file format conversion filters for Microsoft Word for opening and saving to Works Word Processor format. Microsoft Office Excel could import newer Works Spreadsheets because the newer Works Spreadsheet also used the Excel format but with a different extension (*.xlr). There is an import filter for older Works 2.0 spreadsheet format (*.wks); however it may be disabled in the registry by newer Microsoft Office Service packs. As far as Works Spreadsheet 3.x/4.x/2000 (*.wks) and Works database (any version of *.wdb) files were concerned, in the past, Microsoft did not provide an import filter for Excel or Access. There are third party converters available for converting these filetypes to Excel spreadsheets: for database files (*.wdb), there was also a donateware utility; for spreadsheet (*.wks) and database (*.wdb) files, a commercial solution was available (at least apparently in 2008).

A general C++ library, &quot;libwps&quot;, can extract text from many different versions of Microsoft Works, this library is used by Collabora Online and LibreOffice.

One commercially available solution for converting to and from Microsoft Works files on the Macintosh platform in 2016 was the MacLinkPlus product from DataViz. Free online conversion services in 2016 were also available.

Works Spreadsheet and Works Database are unable to handle more than 500 fonts installed in Windows and throw error messages.

==Works Suite==
In 1997, Microsoft introduced Microsoft Home Essentials, a home productivity package sold as a low-price suite that a &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; review described as &quot;one of the best bargains ever offered.&quot; Home Essentials evolved to become Works Suite beginning with the 1999 edition, taking the namesake of Works. A slimmer version of the suite, Works Deluxe, was offered for that year but was discontinued thereafter.

As Works Suite&#x27;s programs were developed separately and sold individually, each has a unique look and feel. They are integrated by a task plane, which picks the appropriate program for the user to accomplish each task. Works Suite includes additional programs such as FoneSync in 2001 and PowerPoint Viewer beginning in 2003. Later editions prompt users to upgrade to featured versions of the programs at a discount.

In addition to retail sales, Works Suite was included with the purchase of a new computer by companies such as Dell and Gateway. Works Suite was discontinued after the 2006 edition. Works was later bundled with Word as Works Plus 2008, but this was made available only to OEMs.

<text>Michael Lawrence Marsh (born August 4, 1967) is a retired American sprinter, the 1992 Olympic champion in the 200 m.

==Biography==
Marsh was born in Los Angeles, and attended high school at Hawthorne High School in Hawthorne, California where he was overshadowed by Henry Thomas, who he joined on numerous championship relays. Marsh, Thomas, Michael Graham and Sean Kelly joined to bring Hawthorne the National High School Record in the 4 × 400 m relay set at the Texas Relays. The team joined to celebrate the silver anniversary of the record in 2010. When Thomas was sidelined with an appendix attack, requiring surgery just before the qualification cycle, Marsh won the 1985 CIF California State Meet in the 200 m. He continued running with Thomas at UCLA, his best achievement was a third place at the NCAA Championships. He was inducted into the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame in 2016.

Although Marsh could compete with the national class sprinters, he did not manage to qualify for an international event until 1991, when he qualified for the American relay team for the 1991 World Championships. Marsh ran in the heats on a team that set the Championship record, but not in the final, which was won by the Americans in World Record time. The next year, Marsh posted a time of 9.93s into a wind of 0.6 m/s at the Mt. SAC Relays in Walnut, which using a widely accepted wind/altitude correction calculator adjusted to the fastest ever intrinsic 100 m time recorded at that time in history. That was the second of what became a trend, a succession of eight early season outstanding 100 m marks set by Marsh at the Mt. SAC Relays. Marsh was elected into the Mt. SAC Relays Hall of Fame in 2003.

At the 1992 US Olympic Trials, Marsh disappointingly finished fourth in the 100 m, not enough for individual qualification, but sufficient to make the relay team. In the 200 m, he placed second to Michael Johnson and qualified for the Barcelona Olympics.

In Barcelona, Marsh surprised all observers in his semi-final. He cruised through the race, simply securing qualification for the final. His qualifying time, however, was 19.73, just one hundredth of a second slower than the standing world record (and it was the American Record). This run was remarkable for the fact that he eased off ten metres from the line, stating in later interviews that he hadn&#x27;t realised how fast he was running and wanted to save some energy for the final, which was to be held only a few hours later. See the race. Unofficial split analysis from video of that run indicates he would have run faster than the world record at the time, Pietro Mennea&#x27;s altitude-assisted 19.72s, if he hadn&#x27;t eased off. An improvement of this record was anticipated for the final, but Marsh could not live up to those expectations. He did win the race however, beating early leader Frankie Fredericks of Namibia. He did set a world record in the final of the 4 x 100 m, as the American team completed the race in 37.40.

As the reigning Olympic champion, he surprisingly did not medal in the 200 m at the 1993 World Championships, placing fourth. His 1994 season went without a win, but he did lead off the Santa Monica Track Club&#x27;s 4 × 200 m relay at the Mt. SAC Relays when the team of Marsh, Leroy Burrell, Floyd Heard and Carl Lewis set a world record in the event that would stand until 2014. He returned strongly in 1995. He won the national championships in the 100 m, and represented his country in that event at the World Championships. There, he disappointed, finishing fifth in the final. The disappointment was complete when the relay team failed to finish the heats after a bad exchange.

In 1996, Marsh managed to qualify for all three sprint events at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, and he reached the final of all three. In the 100 m, he placed fifth and in his attempt to retain his 200 m title (which was taken by Johnson in a new world record time) he finished last. The American relay team, with Marsh as the third runner, was heavily favoured to take the 4 x 100 m title, but they were surprised by the Canadian team in the final, and had to settle for silver.

He again qualified for the 100 m final at the 1997 World Championships, where he placed last due to a foot injury that required immediate surgery.

In 2021 he was elected into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame.

===Track records===
As of September 2024, Marsh holds the following track records for 100 metres and 200 metres.

<text>Skógafoss (pronounced ) is a waterfall on the Skógá River in the south of Iceland at the cliff marking the former coastline. After the coastline had receded (it is now at a distance of about from Skógar), the former sea cliffs remained, parallel to the coast over hundreds of kilometres, creating together with some mountains a clear border between the coastal lowlands and the Highlands of Iceland.

==Geography==

Skógafoss is one of the biggest waterfalls in the country, with a width of and a drop of . Due to the amount of spray the waterfall consistently produces, a single or double rainbow is normally visible on sunny days. Visitors can be drenched if they go too near the waterfall, again due to the spray. According to legend, the first Viking settler in the area, Þrasi Þórólfsson, buried a treasure in a cave behind the waterfall. The legend continues that locals found the chest years later, but were only able to grasp the ring on the side of the chest before it disappeared again. The ring was allegedly given to the local church. The old church door ring is now in the Skógar museum. 

At the eastern side of the waterfall, a hiking and trekking trail leads up to the pass Fimmvörðuháls between the glaciers Eyjafjallajökull and Mýrdalsjökull. It goes down to Þórsmörk on the other side and continues as the Laugavegur trail to Landmannalaugar. A 527-step staircase leads up the slope to the top of the waterfall.

==In popular culture==
In 2012, Skógafoss was the setting for Sólstafir&#x27;s music video &quot;Fjara&quot;, a song from their album &quot;Svartir Sandar&quot;. That same year, the opening task during the second episode of the twelfth season of the Dutch reality television series &quot;Wie is de Mol?&quot; took place at the waterfall.

The waterfall was a location for the filming of the 2013 film releases &quot;&quot; and &quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&quot;.

The 2015 Bollywood movie &quot;Dilwale&quot; features the waterfall was one of the locations of the song &quot;Gerua&quot;. That same year, the Justin Bieber music video for &quot;I&#x27;ll Show You&quot;, featuring glacial lagoons and rivers in South Iceland, includes Skógafoss.

The second episode of season 5 of the series &quot;Vikings&quot;, which aired in 2017, shows the character Floki (based on Hrafna-Flóki Vilgerðarson) coming upon Skógafoss when he discovers Iceland.

The final season of the series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, which aired in 2019, shows Daenerys Targaryen and Jon Snow flying to this waterfall on her dragons and kissing in front of it.

<text>Kelley Armstrong (born 14 December 1968) is a Canadian writer, primarily of fantasy novels since 2001.

She has published thirty-one fantasy novels , thirteen in her &quot;Women&quot; series, five in her &quot;Cainsville&quot; series, six in her Rockton series, three in her &quot;Darkest Powers&quot; series, three in her &quot;Darkness Rising&quot; trilogy and three in the &quot;Age of Legends&quot; series, and three stand-alone teen thrillers. She has also published three middle-grade fantasy novels in the &quot;Blackwell Pages&quot; trilogy, with co-author Melissa Marr. As well, she is the author of three crime novels, the Nadia Stafford trilogy. She has also written several serial novellas and short stories for the Otherworld series, some of which are available free from her website. Starting in 2014, a Canadian television series based on the &quot;Women of the Otherworld,&quot; called Bitten, aired for 3 seasons on Space, and SyFy.

== Biography ==
Kelley Armstrong was born on 14 December 1968, the oldest of four siblings in a &quot;typical middle-class family&quot; in Sudbury, Ontario.

After graduating with a degree in psychology from University of Western Ontario, Armstrong then switched to studying computer programming at Fanshawe College so she would have time to write.

I&#x27;m a former computer programmer, but I have escaped my corporate cubicle and hope never to return

Her first novel &quot;Bitten&quot; was sold in 1999, and it was released in 2001. Following her first success she has written a total of 13 novels and a number of novellas in the world of the &quot;Women of the Otherworld&quot; series, and her first crime novel, &quot;Exit Strategy&quot;, was released July 2007. Armstrong has been a full-time writer and parent since 2002.

Her novel &quot;No Humans Involved&quot; (the seventh book of the &quot;Women of the Otherworld&quot; series) was a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller in the hardback fiction category on 20 May 2007.
Also, her YA novel &quot;The Awakening&quot; was a No. 1 &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller in the Children&#x27;s Chapter books category on 17 May 2009.

== Description of work ==
Armstrong&#x27;s &quot;Women of the Otherworld&quot; series is part of a recently popular contemporary fantasy subgenre of the fantasy genre that superimposes supernatural characters upon a backdrop of contemporary North American life, with strong romantic elements. Within that subgenre, she is notable for including many types of supernatural characters, including witches, sorcerers, werewolves, necromancers, ghosts, shamans, demons and vampires, rather than limiting herself primarily to a single type of supernatural creature. Most of her works have a mystery genre plot, with leading characters investigating some novel situation or unsolved question.

In the &quot;Otherworld&quot; novels, most supernatural powers are either hereditary, or arise from the act of an existing supernatural of the same type. The &quot;Otherworld&quot;, while it has overarching conflicts and plotlines that span multiple novels, is not an epic battle between good and evil. The novels are largely episodic with the continuing plotlines primarily involving the developing lives of the main characters.

Her contemporary fantasy writings share genre similarities with writers Charlaine Harris, Laurell K. Hamilton and Kim Harrison.

<doc id="681348" wikidata="Q777882" url="?curid=681348" title="Seljalandsfoss">
<text>Seljalandsfoss () is a waterfall in Iceland. Seljalandsfoss is located in the South Region in Iceland right by Route 1 and the road that leads to Þórsmörk Road 249. The waterfall drops and is part of the Seljalands River that has its origin in the volcano glacier Eyjafjallajökull. Visitors can walk behind the falls into a small cave.
== Controversy ==
Plans to build an , information centre near the waterfall provoked controversy in Iceland in May 2017. Opponents of the plans argued that the building would spoil the view of the waterfall and interrupt the natural look of the area.

== In popular culture ==
Seljalandsfoss was a waypoint during the first leg of &quot;The Amazing Race 6&quot;.

Seljalandsfoss was featured in the movie &quot;CKY2K&quot; along with music from Björk Guðmundsdóttir.

A scene from the 1990 movie &quot;The Juniper Tree&quot; has Björk&#x27;s character walk behind the waterfall.

The official music video of &quot;I&#x27;ll Show You&quot; by Justin Bieber features glacial lagoons and rivers in South Iceland, including Seljalandsfoss.

The first episode of season three of &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; &quot;That Hope Is You, Part 1&quot; featured a brief scene at the waterfall.

<text>Warkany syndrome 1 was an X-chromosome linked recessive genetic condition originally described by Joseph Warkany in 1961 as part of an article on intrauterine growth retardation - the condition is no longer diagnosed. The family history was consistent with X-linked recessive inheritance of intrauterine growth retardation and small head size, but these features are not unique to this condition and no linkage to a specific gene was ever established. In fact, the condition appears to have been abandoned, given that the OMIM number (308400) assigned to it () and listed in a review article on X-linked mental retardation has been removed from the OMIM database. Furthermore, this condition is no longer mentioned in a more recent review of X-linked mental retardation.

<text>The Island-class patrol vessel was first designed and built for the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency. As a result of the Royal Navy&#x27;s experiences in the Cod Wars with Iceland, FPV &quot;Jura&quot; (loaned to the Navy as ) and FPV &quot;Westra&quot; were put in fishery protection patrols, the Navy built a further seven. These ships were designed and built by Hall Russell of Aberdeen, Scotland.

==Fishery protection cruisers==
FPV &quot;Jura&quot; and FPV &quot;Westra&quot; were built by Hall, Russell &amp; Company of Aberdeen in 1973 and 1975 respectively. &quot;Jura&quot; was loaned to the Royal Navy between 1975 and 1977 for evaluation.

==Royal Navy offshore fishery protection ships==
The success of &quot;Jura&quot; encouraged the Royal Navy to build a further seven ships to the same design; these ships formed the bulk of the Fishery Protection Squadron, whose mission was to patrol the Atlantic fishing grounds, and ensure the security of the British oil and gas fields in the North Sea. However, since the mid-1990s, the class has been gradually decommissioned; &quot;Jersey&quot; was sold to the Bangladesh Navy in 1994, to be followed by &quot;Shetland&quot;, &quot;Alderney&quot;, &quot;Anglesey&quot;, &quot;Guernsey&quot; and &quot;Lindisfarne&quot;, with &quot;Orkney&quot; going to Trinidad and Tobago. The Island class was replaced in the Fishery Protection Squadron by the three ships of the .

== Ships in class ==
==Disposal==
Presently, five Island-class patrol vessels are in active service with the Bangladesh Navy.

<text>Hraunfossar (; in Borgarfjörður, western Iceland) is a series of waterfalls formed by rivulets streaming over a distance of about 900 metres out of the Hallmundarhraun, a lava field which flowed from an eruption of one of the volcanoes lying under the glacier Langjökull. The waterfalls pour into Hvítá (Borgarfjörður), from ledges of less porous rock in the lava. The name comes from the Icelandic word for &quot;lava&quot; (&quot;hraun&quot;) and the word for &quot;waterfalls&quot; (&quot;fossar&quot;). The Hraunfossar are situated near Húsafell and Reykholt and the Víðgelmir lava tube is close by.

Literally a stone&#x27;s throw upstream from Hraunfossar, there is another waterfall called Barnafoss. Its name, the &quot;waterfall of the children&quot;, comes from an accident which is said to have taken place here in former times. There was a natural bridge over the waterfall and two children from a nearby farm fell to their deaths crossing the river on the bridge. Afterwards, the grief-struck mother had the bridge destroyed.

<text>Greg Costikyan (born July 22, 1959, in New York City), sometimes known under the pseudonym &quot;Designer X&quot;, is an American game designer and science fiction writer.
Costikyan&#x27;s career spans nearly all extant genres of gaming, including: hex-based wargames, role-playing games, boardgames, card games, computer games, online games, and mobile games. Several of his games have won Origins Awards. He co-founded Manifesto Games, now out of business, with Johnny Wilson in 2005.

==Personal life and education==
Greg Costikyan is the son of attorney and politician Edward N. and Frances (Holmgren) Costikyan. He and Warren Spector, a game designer, were friends since high school. He is a 1982 graduate (B.S.) of Brown University. He married Louise Disbrow (a securities analyst), September 4, 1986. They have three children. He is a frequent speaker at game industry events including the Game Developers Conference and E³.

==Career==
Greg Costikyan has been a game designer since the 1970s. Costikyan worked at SPI until it was closed by TSR in 1982; he came to West End Games in 1983. His 1983 game &quot;Bug-Eyed Monsters&quot; brought West End Games into the science-fiction and fantasy genres, and the following year he licensed his &quot;Paranoia&quot; role-playing game to West End Games for publishing after trying unsuccessfully to find a publisher. Costikyan designed &quot;Toon&quot; (1984) for Steve Jackson Games after developing it from an idea suggested by Jeff Dee; Costikyan felt that the game system was mostly &quot;arbitrary&quot; and that the theme of the game was far more important. West End Games acquired licensing to make a game based on &quot;Star Wars&quot;, and Costikyan designed &quot;Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game&quot;, published in 1987, assisted by Doug Kaufman and others.

Costikyan and Eric Goldberg left West End Games in January 1987, forming the short-lived Goldberg Associates. When West End Games declared bankruptcy in 1998, Costikyan and Goldberg tried to recover the rights to &quot;Paranoia&quot;; although West End&#x27;s founder Scott Palter tried to fight this, a judge gave the rights back to the creators in 2000. Costikyan designed the role-playing game &quot;Violence&quot; (1999) under the pseudonym &quot;Designer X&quot; for Hogshead Publishing, and made sure that the game would widely available by releasing it under a Creative Commons license. Costikyan and Goldberg licensed &quot;Paranoia&quot; to Mongoose Publishing, which began producing new books for the game in 2004.

Costikyan was the CEO of Manifesto Games, a start-up devoted to providing a viable path to market for independently developed computer games. He subsequently worked as a consultant for several years before joining Guerillapps as lead game designer in March 2010 to develop its game &quot;Trash Tycoon&quot; for Facebook. In May 2011, he joined Disney Playdom as senior games designer and in January 2014 assumed the same role at Loop Drop. In June 2015, Costikyan joined Boss Fight Entertainment as senior games designer.

He has written on games, game design, and game industry business issues for publications including: the &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;Wall Street Journal Interactive&quot;, &quot;Salon&quot;, &quot;The Escapist&quot;, &quot;Gamasutra&quot;, and &quot;Game Developers Magazine&quot;, and is the author of science fiction novels.

He has lectured on game design at universities including: the Copenhagen ITU, Helsinki University of Art &amp; Design, RPI, and Stony Brook University.

As of 2019, Costikyan and Goldberg both joined Playable Worlds, a gaming startup founded by Raph Koster focused on producing the MMORPG, Stars Reach.

==Games==
Costikyan&#x27;s notable works include:
*&quot;Web and Starship&quot; (1984, a starships combat science fiction board game)
*&quot;Toon&quot; (1984, a humor role-playing game)
*&quot;Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game&quot; (Origins Award Winner for &quot;Best Role-playing Rules of 1987&quot;)
*&quot;Pax Britannica&quot; (Charles S. Roberts Award Winner for &quot;Best Pre-20th Century Game of 1985&quot;)
*&quot;Paranoia&quot; (Origins Award Winner for &quot;Best Roleplaying Rules of 1984&quot;)
*&quot;The Creature That Ate Sheboygan&quot; (Charles S. Roberts Award Winner for &quot;Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Game of 1979&quot;)
*&quot;MadMaze&quot;
*&quot;Violence: The Roleplaying Game of Egregious and Repulsive Bloodshed&quot;
*&quot;The Price of Freedom&quot; (1986)

Costikyan&#x27;s other RPG credits include &quot;Acute Paranoia&quot; (1986) for &quot;Paranoia&quot;, and &quot;Your Own Private Idaho&quot; (1987) for &quot;The Price of Freedom&quot;.

In addition, Costikyan is a widely published author on the subject of game design and the role of games in culture. His essay &quot;I Have No Words and I Must Design&quot; is widely read as a conceptual approach to framing game design.

Costikyan worked on game design for many years, including writing and consulting for Nokia. In September 2005, he left Nokia to join with Johnny Wilson, former editor of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, in founding the startup indie game publisher Manifesto Games. He regularly contributed to the now defunct Manifesto Games&#x27; website, and was editor in chief of their now defunct offshoot game review blog &quot;Play This Thing&quot;.

In the 1970s and &#x27;80s, Costikyan was a leading player of &quot;Slobbovia&quot;. His novel &quot;One Quest, Hold the Dragons&quot; includes several stories about &quot;crottled greeps&quot;, a Slobbovian meme.

In 1997, he designed the video game &quot;&quot;.

In February 2009, Costikyan updated the rules and re-released his 1979 space combat game, &quot;Vector 3&quot;, under a Creative Commons license as a free PDF download.

==Books==
Costikyan has written four novels. The first two were parodies of genre fantasy: &quot;Another Day, Another Dungeon&quot; (1990, ) and its sequel &quot;One Quest, Hold the Dragons&quot; (1995, ). &quot;By the Sword&quot; (1993, ) is another irreverent fantasy about a young barbarian who is forced by circumstances to make his way in the larger world; it was originally serialized on the Prodigy online service.

His latest novel, &quot;First Contract&quot; (in French : Space O.P.A. - 2000, ), depicts (with much dry humor) the vast sociological and economic changes that happen after aliens arrive on Earth, and one entrepreneur&#x27;s efforts to survive and make a new start.

In 2013, Costikyan&#x27;s non-fiction look at the role of uncertainty in game development &quot;Uncertainty in Games&quot; was published by MIT Press. A paperback edition was subsequently published in 2015. .

==Awards and recognition==
Costikyan is the winner of five Origins Awards. On March 7, 2007, Costikyan received the Game Developers Choice Awards Maverick Award. The award was given for his tireless efforts to create a viable channel for indie games.
He was inducted into the Adventure Gaming Hall of Fame in 1999.

<text>Eötvös Loránd University (, ELTE, also known as &quot;University of Budapest&quot;) is a Hungarian public research university based in Budapest. Founded in 1635, ELTE is one of the largest and most prestigious public higher education institutions in Hungary. The 28,000 students at ELTE are organized into nine faculties, and into research institutes located throughout Budapest and on the scenic banks of the Danube. ELTE is affiliated with 5 Nobel laureates, as well as winners of the Wolf Prize, Fulkerson Prize and Abel Prize, the latest of which was Abel Prize winner László Lovász in 2021.

The predecessor of Eötvös Loránd University was founded in 1635 by Cardinal Péter Pázmány in Nagyszombat, Kingdom of Hungary (today Trnava, Slovakia) as a Catholic university for teaching theology and philosophy. In 1770, the university was transferred to Buda. It was named Royal University of Pest until 1873, then University of Budapest until 1921, when it was renamed Royal Hungarian Pázmány Péter University after its founder Péter Pázmány. The Faculty of Science started its autonomous life in 1949, when The Faculty of Theology was separated from the university (now Pázmány Péter Catholic University). The university received its current name in 1950, after one of its most well-known physicists, Baron Loránd Eötvös.

==History==

The university was founded in 1635 in Nagyszombat, Kingdom of Hungary (today Trnava, Slovakia) by the archbishop and theologian Péter Pázmány. Leadership was given over to the Jesuits. Initially the university only had two faculties (Faculty of Arts and Faculty of Theology). The Faculty of Law was added in 1667 and the Faculty of Medicine was started in 1769. After the dissolution of the Jesuit order, the university was moved to Buda (today part of Budapest) in 1777 in accordance with the intention of the founder. The university moved to its final location in Pest (now also part of Budapest) in 1784. The language of education was Latin until 1844, when Hungarian was introduced as an exclusive official language. Women have been allowed to enroll since 1895.

Although several Hungarian universities opted for the new foundation model, Eötvös Loránd University remained state-owned.

On 3 October 2023, a former student of the Faculty of Science, Ferenc Krausz was awarded Nobel Prize in Physics.

== Academic profile ==
ELTE is Hungary&#x27;s largest scientific establishment with 118 PhD programs at 17 doctoral schools, and also offers 38 bachelor&#x27;s programs, 96 master&#x27;s programs, and over 50 degree programs in foreign languages. The course credits awarded are transferable to universities in Europe through the Bologna process.
The nine faculties are (active faculties are in bold):
===Timeline (1873–present)===
===Reputation and rankings===

==Sport==

The Eötvös Loránd University has its own sport club, Budapesti Egyetemi Atlétikai Club (English: Budapest University Athletic Club). The biggest achievement of the association football department of the club was qualifying for the 1924-25 Nemzeti Bajnokság I season. However, in the subsequent season (1925-26 Nemzeti Bajnokság I) the club were relegated to the Nemzeti Bajnokság II and has never been able to qualify to the top flight ever since.https://www.beac.hu/

<text>Jan Jacob Slauerhoff (15 September 1898 – 5 October 1936), who published as J. Slauerhoff, was a Dutch poet and novelist. He is considered one of the most important Dutch language writers.

==Youth==
Slauerhoff attended HBS (secondary school) in Leeuwarden, where he first met fellow future writer Simon Vestdijk, who was from Harlingen. In 1916, Slauerhoff and Vestdijk both moved to Amsterdam to read medicine. While at the university, Slauerhoff wrote his first poems; his debut as a poet was in the Communist magazine &quot;De Nieuwe Tijd&quot;. He edited the Amsterdam student magazine &quot;Propria Cures&quot; from 1919 to 1920. In 1919, Slauerhoff became engaged to a Dutch language student, Truus de Ruyter. In 1921 he joined the staff of the literary magazine &quot;Het Getij&quot; and later that of &quot;De Vrije Bladen&quot;; in this period he became acquainted with poets Hendrik Marsman and Hendrik de Vries.

==Early career==
His first collection of verse, &quot;Archipel&quot; (&quot;Archipelago&quot;), was published in 1923. Afterwards, he started working as a medical doctor on board of ships, especially in South East Asia. Much of his work refers to travel, to longing for far coasts, to China and Japan, and to the sea.

==Marriage, final years==
From 1929 on, Slauerhoff stayed in the Netherlands more frequently. He was an assistant in the Utrecht University clinic for Dermatology and Venereal Diseases from 1929–1930. In September 1930, he married dancer and ballet teacher Darja Collin, the start of a short happy period in his life. By 1931, however, Slauerhoff had fallen ill again and left for the Italian health resort of Merano to recuperate. His wife followed him in 1932, so that they might experience the birth of their first child together. The child, Juan Darito, was stillborn, prompting a serious depression in Slauerhoff.

Later in 1932, Slauerhoff went to sea again, signing up with the Holland-West-Afrikalijn. His general bad health continued to trouble him and he considered moving to Northern Africa, as this would benefit his health. In March 1934, he set up a doctor&#x27;s practice in Tangier, then an international protectorate, but by October he had left again. His periods of illness grew longer as the symptoms grew more serious, and his relationship with Darja deteriorated.
His fame as a writer, meanwhile, spread. In 1932 he published &quot;Het verboden rijk&quot; (&quot;The Forbidden Kingdom&quot;), a partly historical, partly magical realist novel combining the life of a 20th-century European with that of Luís de Camões, the 16th-century Portuguese poet (author of sonnets and the epic &quot;The Lusiads&quot;) who spent part of his life in the Orient. Despite not being translated into English until 2012, it attracted attention from scholars publishing in English. Jane Fenoulhet, for instance, referred to it as an important modernist novel in 2001. Both &quot;Het verboden rijk&quot; and the follow-up novel &quot;Het leven op aarde&quot; (&quot;Life on Earth,&quot; 1934) were widely praised, and his 1933 verse collection &quot;Soleares&quot; was awarded the .

The year 1935 saw more sea voyages as a ship&#x27;s doctor, but also his divorce from Darja Collin. In this period of his life, Slauerhoff fell out with many of his literary friends, among them Du Perron and Vestdijk. During his last voyage, to South Africa, he fell severely ill with malaria on top of his neglected tuberculosis and returned to Merano for yet more recuperation.

Still ill, he returned to the Netherlands in 1936 to take up residence in a nursing home in Hilversum, where he died on 5 October, just after his 38th birthday and one month after the publication of his last collection of verse, &quot;Een eerlijk zeemansgraf&quot; (&quot;An Honourable Seaman&#x27;s Grave&quot;).

==Style and themes==
Though Slauerhoff writes in the time of expressionism, his poetry is, according to Garmt Stuiveling and G.J. van Bork, essentially romantic: strongly autobiographical, it evidences restlessness, imagination, and a longing for faraway places, expressed through an identification with tramps, discoverers, and pirates.

Much of Slauerhoff&#x27;s work is concerned with the poor and downtrodden; especially the poetry collections &quot;Archipel&quot; (1923), &quot;Eldorado&quot; (1928), &quot;Soleares&quot; (1933), and &quot;Een eerlijk zeemansgraf&quot; (1936). A performance of his play &quot;Jan Pietersz. Coen&quot; (1930), highly critical of Jan Pieterszoon Coen (seventeenth-century officer of the Dutch East India Company in Indonesia and two-term Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies), was prohibited by the mayor of Amsterdam in 1948.

==Posthumous editions==

Two works in progress that were nearly finished at the time of Slauerhoff&#x27;s death, the original novel &quot;De opstand van Guadalajara&quot; (&quot;The Guadalajara Uprising&quot;) and the translation of Martín Luis Guzmán&#x27;s novel &quot;In de schaduw van den leider&quot; (&quot;In the Shadow of the Leader&quot;), were published posthumously in 1937.

A Committee for the Preparation of Slauerhoff&#x27;s Complete Works was put together and convened to compile his &quot;Complete Works&quot;. This Committee, which consisted of leading literary figures, among which a number of friends of Slauerhoff, included D.A.M. Binnendijk, Menno ter Braak, N.A. Donkersloot, J. Greshoff, Kees Lekkerkerker, Hendrik Marsman, Adriaan Roland Holst, and Constant van Wessem. Du Perron contributed a general outline for the ordering and grouping of the contents, but declined to participate further. Work progressed slowly and was further slowed down by the events of World War II. The first volume appeared in 1941, one year behind schedule, and the series of eight volumes was not completed until 1958. Two of the Committee&#x27;s members, Ter Braak and Marsman, died at the start of the war and the publisher, Nijgh &amp; Van Ditmar, lost faith halfway through the project, which resulted in the intended separate volume of critical apparatus being scrapped and the last volume, containing Slauerhoff&#x27;s essays, being published independently by Lekkerkerker.
Lekkerkerker, ever the dedicated text researcher and caretaker of Slauerhoff&#x27;s literary heritage, continued over the years to unearth and study Slauerhoff&#x27;s manuscripts and uncollected publications, resulting in ever better versions of the &quot;Complete Poems&quot; and &quot;Complete Prose&quot; volumes.

In 2018 a revised complete edition of all his poems was published. Wim Hazeu, one of the main biographers of the Netherlands, published a revised edition of his Slauerhoff biography that same year. Slauerhoff&#x27;s 1934 novel, &quot;Het leven op aarde&quot;, was republished by Handheld Press in a new English translation by David McKay as &quot;Adrift in the Middle Kingdom&quot; in 2019.

<doc id="681398" wikidata="Q1342275" url="?curid=681398" title="Flight of the Bumblebee">
<text>&quot;Flight of the Bumblebee&quot; () is an orchestral written by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov (1844–1908) for his opera &quot;The Tale of Tsar Saltan&quot;, composed in 1899–1900. This perpetuum mobile is intended to musically evoke the seemingly chaotic and rapidly changing flying pattern of a bumblebee. Despite the piece&#x27;s being a rather incidental part of the opera, it is today one of the more familiar classical works because of its frequent use in popular culture.

The piece closes Act III, Tableau 1, during which the magic Swan-Bird changes Prince Gvidon Saltanovich (the Tsar&#x27;s son) into an insect so that he can fly away to visit his father (who does not know that he is alive). Although in the opera the Swan-Bird sings during the first part of the &quot;Flight&quot;, her vocal line is melodically uninvolved and easily omitted; this feature, combined with the fact that the number decisively closes the scene, made easy extraction as an orchestral concerto piece possible.

==Overview==

Following is the text of the scene where the Swan-Bird sings during this music:

Although the &quot;Flight&quot; does not have a title in the score of the opera, its common English title translates like the Russian one (&quot;Полёт шмеля&quot; = &quot;Polyot shmelya&quot;). Incidentally, this piece does not constitute one of the movements of the orchestral suite that Rimsky-Korsakov derived from the opera for concerts.

Those familiar with the opera &quot;Tsar Saltan&quot; may recognize two leitmotifs used in the &quot;Flight,&quot; both of which are associated with Prince Gvidon from earlier in the opera. These are illustrated here in musical notation:

:Gvidon&#x27;s Leitmotifs in &quot;Flight of the Bumblebee&quot;
:&lt;score override_midi=&quot;Fotbbmotives1.mid&quot; vorbis&gt;\relative c&#x27;{ \new PianoStaff « \new Staff { \tempo &quot;1.&quot; \time 2/4 e4^&quot;Fundamental form&quot; c8 f e4 c \bar &quot;||&quot;} \new Staff { e16^&quot;Transformation in the \&quot;Flight\&quot;&quot; ees d des c f e dis e ees d des c cis d dis } »}&lt;/score&gt;
:&lt;score override_midi=&quot;Fotbbmotives2.mid&quot; vorbis&gt;\relative c&#x27;{\tempo &quot;2.&quot; \clef &quot;bass&quot; \time 2/4 r4 e8 c a f a c e \bar&quot;||&quot;}&lt;/score&gt;

The music of this number recurs in modified form during the ensuing tableau (Act III, Tableau 2), at the points when the Bumblebee appears during the scene: it stings the two evil sisters on the brow, blinds Babarikha (the instigator of the plot to trick Saltan at the beginning into sending his wife away), and in general causes havoc at the end of the tableau. The readers of Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s original poem, upon which this opera is based, will note that Gvidon is supposed to go on three separate trips to Saltan&#x27;s kingdom, each of which requires a transformation into a different insect.

&quot;Flight of the Bumblebee&quot; is recognizable for its frantic pace when played up to tempo, with nearly uninterrupted runs of chromatic sixteenth notes. It is not so much the pitch or range of the notes that are played that challenges the musician, but simply the musician&#x27;s ability to move to them quickly enough. Because of this and its complexity, it requires a great deal of skill to perform. Often in popular culture, it is thought of as being notoriously hard to play.

In the &quot;Tsar Saltan&quot; suite, the short version is commonly played, taking less than two minutes. In the Opera version, the three-minute fifty-five-second version is performed.

<doc id="681406" wikidata="Q7370704" url="?curid=681406" title="Rotunda, Birmingham">
<text>The Rotunda is a cylindrical highrise building in Birmingham, England. The Grade II listed building is tall and was completed in 1965. Originally designed to be an office block, by architect James A. Roberts ARIBA, it was refurbished between 2004 and 2008 by Urban Splash with Glenn Howells who turned it into a residential building, with serviced apartments on 19th and 20th floors. The building was officially reopened on 13 May 2008.

==History==
A part of the James A. Roberts design for the original Bull Ring Shopping Centre included a 12-storey circular office block. This was revised to 25 storeys, abandoning plans for a rooftop restaurant and a cinema. The design was approved and construction began on the 81 metre (265 ft) building in 1961. It was constructed with aid of a tower crane located to the side of the reinforced concrete central core. Due to its proximity to a railway tunnel, the main load was built on to a twin ring of piled foundations directly beneath the circular structural core. The floors are supported by the core and perimeter columns. When opened, the podium had shops and its own work of art, &quot;The Rotunda Relief&quot; at Lloyds banking hall, a circular mural designed by John Poole. The building construction was unique at the time, possibly due to the lack of construction space, and was mostly built at ground floor level then &#x27;jacked up&#x27; one floor at a time. This allowed the plant room and boiler house, located on the top floor, to have their equipment installed at ground level, making access easier than having to crane the equipment once the building was complete. The supports for the hydraulic pumps used to jack up the building started to shift towards the New Street Station railway lines so the building&#x27;s planned height was never completed.

Completed in 1965 as an office block at a cost of £1 million during the post-war rebuilding of the Bull Ring, it was initially much derided and considered a &quot;dead building&quot;. However, suggestions in the 1980s that it should be demolished when the Bull Ring was again redeveloped met with equal, if not greater, hostility from the local populace.

In 1974 a pub on the ground floor and basement of the building, was one of the sites of the Birmingham pub bombings.

Since its construction and prior to the construction of the new Bullring, advertisements were displayed on the top of the building. In the 1960s and 1970s these advertisements were for the property company MEPC plc (top) and Double Diamond beer (bottom) while in the 1980s and 1990s the Rotunda displayed signs for Coca-Cola. During construction of the new Bullring, advertisements on the top of the building advertised the new development. The building also previously had a digital clock showing the time from the top floors. In August 2000, it received Grade II listed building status.

===Refurbishment===
From 2004 to 2008, the Rotunda, a Grade II listed building, was refurbished and partially converted for residential use by developer Urban Splash and Glenn Howells Architects. The redevelopment created 232 luxury apartments, including six penthouse suites on the 20th floor. The whole of the 19th floor and one of the penthouses on the 20th floor is run as serviced apartments by the Manchester-based operator, Staying Cool. There are fourteen apartments on each floor. All apartments have been sold, with the final 92 being sold within three hours of their release.

Two hi-tech LED illuminations were installed at the top of the building in 2007. Both LED boards have been removed to make way for a &#x27;light box&#x27; which was approved by Birmingham City Council in late 2007. The façade consists of 72 floor-to-ceiling height glass panes, each placed at 5° to the neighbouring window.

On 18 May 2006, strong winds dislodged a pane of glass causing it to fall to the ground resulting in the surrounding area being closed to the public.

In May 2004, its original architect Jim Roberts commented:

He also explained that the building had originally been intended to look like a candle, with a flame-like weather beacon on top, changing colour to reflect the weather.

However, by June 2008, investors were already facing a significant financial loss. Rents have been significantly below what was expected, and the value of the flats dropped an average of £25,000 from October 2005 to June 2008.

<text>Chaotic was originally a Danish trading card game. It expanded to an online game in America which then became a television program based on the game. The program aired on 4Kids TV (Fox affiliates, nationwide), Jetix, The CW4Kids, Cartoon Network and Disney XD. It was brought over to the United States from Denmark by Bryan C. Gannon and Chaotic USA Entertainment Group, and produced by Chaotic USA Entertainment Group, 4Kids Productions and Bardel Entertainment. The trading card game came out 6 September 2006 in the U.S. and Canada.

Each card comes with a unique code which the owner can upload onto the Chaotic website. This allows the owner to trade and play online using their own card collection. The game was well known to be the only game with a TV show, an online game, and a TCG that were all integrated. However, the online game is currently closed.

The rights have since defaulted to Bryan C. Gannon, who&#x27;s leading an effort to revive the game for modern audiences by licensing the franchise to Epic Story Media.

== History ==

Chaotic started out as a trading card game known as &quot;Grolls and Gorks&quot; and an idea for a cartoon series of the same name co-authored by Merlin P. Mann, co-author of the Taynikma graphic novels, in December 2000 as 20 years, to be produced by Solit Entertainment. The name of the manuscript was changed to Chaotic in early 2001. Before any episodes were made, Dracco Company Ltd. bought the rights to Chaotic from Solit Entertainment. The original storyline featured Tom Majors and Kaz Kalinkas, who were enemies, instead of friends as in the 4Kids animated series. Dracco Company Ltd. with Apex Marketing then created the online version of the game and established the basic universe of Chaotic. In September 2003 trading card Executive Bryan C. Gannon signed a worldwide Licensing and Distribution agreement with Henrik Andersen and his brother Jacob Anderson at Dracco to bring the Chaotic game to North America and to the world. Gannon created Chaotic USA Entertainment Group and, in August 2005, licensed the patented technology, (US Patents 5,810,666 &amp; 5,954,332) from Cornerstone Patent Technologies, LLC to bring the property up to the standards required for a global brand. He teamed with John Milito and in 2006, 4Kids Entertainment signed a Joint Marketing Agreement with Chaotic USA Entertainment (CUSA) to produce the cartoon and bring the property to market, both on TV and for licensed products. When 4Kids Entertainment teamed with CUSA, the work of CUSA was continued and included many additional improvements. The original cards were redesigned (and some renamed) along with the online game platform to give it a more mature look as well as the creation of a new animated series (with redesigned versions of Tom and Kaz) to promote the game. CUSA has been developing the online game experience for Chaotic named . A video game called Chaotic: Shadow Warriors was released on 30 December 2009.

Sam Murakami, a 4Kids employee, and Martin Rauff, the original designer with Bryan C Gannon and TC Digital Games, adapted the card game to the U.S.

== Animated series ==
The TV series is based on the storyline of the original Chaotic TCG. The main protagonist is a teenager named Tom, whose friend Kaz constantly tells him of his adventures in Chaotic. Tom, who believes that Chaotic is only a card game, thinks that Kaz is making things up, until he entered a password he received from the game, transporting him to the world of Chaotic. It was then Tom knew that Kaz wasn&#x27;t lying. In Chaotic, he also met some new friends, like the courageous Sarah and the comic Peyton, and new enemies, like the arrogant duo Klay and Krystella.

Players in Chaotic go to Perim, scan new creatures and use them to battle. In Perim, Tom also got to meet many creatures, including his favorite, Maxxor. The battles between players take place in dromes, which are virtual battles where players become the creatures they choose and fight for the right to battle against the drome master (code master). In Perim, the four tribes are currently at war for the Cothica, the power that controls all of Perim. In the second season, the fifth tribe, the M&#x27;arrillians, escapes from the Doors of the Deepmines and takes over the other four tribes by brainwashing other creatures. The second season featured true cel animation and manga/anime-styled artwork. Season three, although subtitled &quot;Secrets of the Lost City,&quot; was actually a set of differently themed mini-stories, only a few episodes of which involved the so-called &quot;Lost City&quot;.

== Trading card game ==
In the Chaotic Trading Card Game there are 5 different types of cards: Creatures, , Attacks, Mugic, and Locations. Creatures are the cards players control to do battle. is a specific item each creature is equipped with when it starts battle. Attacks are exactly that, they are used to do damage to the opponent&#x27;s creatures. Mugic is a combination of music and magic, it is used by creatures who have mugic counters. Locations are the places where creatures can battle at, they are all places in Perim.

There are five tribes of creatures in Chaotic: OverWorld, UnderWorld, Danian, Mipedian and M&#x27;arrillian. The OverWorld is a tribe made of various humanoid creatures and creatures which resemble real animals. The UnderWorld is a tribe which consists of creatures which resemble various monsters. Danians are usually made to resemble ants but there are some creatures based on other insects found within the tribe. Mipedians are a tribe which is made of creatures who resemble various lizards. The M&#x27;arrillians are a tribe which resembles various deep sea creatures, some of which have a transparent appearance such as that found in a jellyfish.

The game is played by two players who control an army of creatures. The object of the game is to lower the energy of that player&#x27;s opponent&#x27;s creatures to 0 by way of attacks, mugic, or creature abilities. The game can be played with a varying amount of creatures in each army (1vs1, 3vs3, 6vs6, 10vs10) and with a varying amount of complexity. The game can be played in the advanced apprentice ruleset where no mugic is used and combat is only attacks. Masters is the next step up where mugic and activated abilities are used. Masters games take longer and require full knowledge of the rules.

The rules of Chaotic are basic; each player starts the game with his creatures face-down and their face-down as well. When the game begins the creatures are flipped up and the which indicates to do so is as well. There can only be two of the same card in each army, unless specified as otherwise, cards that are limited to one per army are called unique. When the game begins the starting player (which can be chosen by who is the youngest, a coin toss, etc.) starts by flipping their top location card face-up. The other player then can move a creature to an unoccupied space on the mat, or move a creature into an opponent&#x27;s occupied space. Doing this will initiate combat, this is the only way to defeat a player&#x27;s opponent&#x27;s creatures in advanced apprentice seeing as no mugic or abilities are used. When combat begins the players see which creature has gained initiative, initiative is dependent on the location and the creatures that are battling in that location. Initiative can be anything from a stat to a certain tribe or an element. The player with the initiative gets to play the first attack.

Each player starts the game with an attack deck of 20 attacks and the game is started with 2 of these attacks in the hand, at the beginning of each player&#x27;s turn during combat an attack is drawn. The attack cards each have build points which when added up equal 20. This prevents the hogging of good cards. During a player&#x27;s turn they must play an attack, which sends it to the discard pile. By playing attacks the player decreases the energy of the opponent&#x27;s creature. This is the key to winning the game.

<doc id="681409" wikidata="Q620702" url="?curid=681409" title="Stable marriage problem">
<text>In mathematics, economics, and computer science, the stable marriage problem (also stable matching problem) is the problem of finding a stable matching between two equally sized sets of elements given an ordering of preferences for each element. A matching is a bijection from the elements of one set to the elements of the other set. A matching is &quot;not&quot; stable if:

In other words, a matching is stable when there does not exist any pair (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) which both prefer each other to their current partner under the matching.

The stable marriage problem has been stated as follows:

The existence of two classes that need to be paired with each other (heterosexual men and women in this example) distinguishes this problem from the stable roommates problem.

==Applications==
Algorithms for finding solutions to the stable marriage problem have applications in a variety of real-world situations, perhaps the best known of these being in the assignment of graduating medical students to their first hospital appointments. In 2012, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was awarded to Lloyd S. Shapley and Alvin E. Roth &quot;for the theory of stable allocations and the practice of market design.&quot;

An important and large-scale application of stable marriage is in assigning users to servers in a large distributed Internet service. Billions of users access web pages, videos, and other services on the Internet, requiring each user to be matched to one of (potentially) hundreds of thousands of servers around the world that offer that service. A user prefers servers that are proximal enough to provide a faster response time for the requested service, resulting in a (partial) preferential ordering of the servers for each user. Each server prefers to serve users that it can with a lower cost, resulting in a (partial) preferential ordering of users for each server. Content delivery networks that distribute much of the world&#x27;s content and services solve this large and complex stable marriage problem between users and servers every tens of seconds to enable billions of users to be matched up with their respective servers that can provide the requested web pages, videos, or other services.

The Gale-Shapley algorithm for stable matching is used to assign rabbis who graduate from Hebrew Union College to Jewish congregations.

==Different stable matchings==

In general, there may be many different stable matchings. For example, suppose there are three men (A,B,C) and three women (X,Y,Z) which have preferences of:

: A: YXZ   B: ZYX   C: XZY   
:X: BAC   Y: CBA   Z: ACB

There are three stable solutions to this matching arrangement:

* men get their first choice and women their third - (AY, BZ, CX);
* all participants get their second choice - (AX, BY, CZ);
* women get their first choice and men their third - (AZ, BX, CY).

All three are stable, because instability requires both of the participants to be happier with an alternative match. Giving one group their first choices ensures that the matches are stable because they would be unhappy with any other proposed match. Giving everyone their second choice ensures that any other match would be disliked by one of the parties. In general, the family of solutions to any instance of the stable marriage problem can be given the structure of a finite distributive lattice,
and this structure leads to efficient algorithms for several problems on stable marriages.

In a uniformly-random instance of the stable marriage problem with men and women, the average number of stable matchings is asymptotically formula_1.
In a stable marriage instance chosen to maximize the number of different stable matchings, this number is an exponential function of .
Counting the number of stable matchings in a given instance is #P-complete.

==Algorithmic solution==
In 1962, David Gale and Lloyd Shapley proved that, for any equal number of men and women, it is always possible to solve the stable marriage problem and make all marriages stable. They presented an algorithm to do so.

The Gale–Shapley algorithm (also known as the deferred acceptance algorithm) involves a number of &quot;rounds&quot; (or &quot;iterations&quot;):
* In the first round, first &quot;a&quot;) each unengaged man proposes to the woman he prefers most, and then &quot;b&quot;) each woman replies &quot;maybe&quot; to her suitor she most prefers and &quot;no&quot; to all other suitors. She is then provisionally &quot;engaged&quot; to the suitor she most prefers so far, and that suitor is likewise provisionally engaged to her. 
* In each subsequent round, first &quot;a&quot;) each unengaged man proposes to the most-preferred woman to whom he has not yet proposed (regardless of whether the woman is already engaged), and then &quot;b&quot;) each woman replies &quot;maybe&quot; if she is currently not engaged or if she prefers this man over her current provisional partner (in this case, she rejects her current provisional partner who becomes unengaged). The provisional nature of engagements preserves the right of an already-engaged woman to &quot;trade up&quot; (and, in the process, to &quot;jilt&quot; her until-then partner).
* This process is repeated until everyone is engaged.

This algorithm is guaranteed to produce a stable marriage for all participants in time formula_2 where formula_3 is the number of men or women.

Among all possible different stable matchings, it always yields the one that is best for all men among all stable matchings, and worst for all women.

It is a truthful mechanism from the point of view of men (the proposing side), i.e., no man can get a better matching for himself by misrepresenting his preferences. Moreover, the GS algorithm is even &quot;group-strategy proof&quot; for men, i.e., no coalition of men can coordinate a misrepresentation of their preferences such that all men in the coalition are strictly better-off. However, it is possible for some coalition to misrepresent their preferences such that some men are better-off and the other men retain the same partner.
The GS algorithm is non-truthful for the women (the reviewing side): each woman may be able to misrepresent her preferences and get a better match.

== Rural hospitals theorem ==

The rural hospitals theorem concerns a more general variant of the stable matching problem, like that applying in the problem of matching doctors to positions at hospitals, differing in the following ways from the basic -to- form of the stable marriage problem:
*Each participant may only be willing to be matched to a subset of the participants on the other side of the matching.
*The participants on one side of the matching (the hospitals) may have a numerical capacity, specifying the number of doctors they are willing to hire.
*The total number of participants on one side might not equal the total capacity to which they are to be matched on the other side.
*The resulting matching might not match all of the participants.
In this case, the condition of stability is that no unmatched pair prefer each other to their situation in the matching (whether that situation is another partner or being unmatched). With this condition, a stable matching will still exist, and can still be found by the Gale–Shapley algorithm.

For this kind of stable matching problem, the rural hospitals theorem states that:
* The set of assigned doctors, and the number of filled positions in each hospital, are the same in all stable matchings. 
* Any hospital that has some empty positions in some stable matching, receives exactly the same set of doctors in &quot;all&quot; stable matchings.

== Related problems ==
In stable matching with indifference, some men might be indifferent between two or more women and vice versa.

The stable roommates problem is similar to the stable marriage problem, but differs in that all participants belong to a single pool (instead of being divided into equal numbers of &quot;men&quot; and &quot;women&quot;).

The hospitals/residents problem – also known as the college admissions problem – differs from the stable marriage problem in that a hospital can take multiple residents, or a college can take an incoming class of more than one student. Algorithms to solve the hospitals/residents problem can be &quot;hospital-oriented&quot; (as the NRMP was before 1995) or &quot;resident-oriented&quot;. This problem was solved, with an algorithm, in the same original paper by Gale and Shapley, in which the stable marriage problem was solved.

The hospitals/residents problem with couples allows the set of residents to include couples who must be assigned together, either to the same hospital or to a specific pair of hospitals chosen by the couple (e.g., a married couple want to ensure that they will stay together and not be stuck in programs that are far away from each other). The addition of couples to the hospitals/residents problem renders the problem NP-complete.

The assignment problem seeks to find a matching in a weighted bipartite graph that has maximum weight. Maximum weighted matchings do not have to be stable, but in some applications a maximum weighted matching is better than a stable one.

The matching with contracts problem is a generalization of matching problem, in which participants can be matched with different terms of contracts. An important special case of contracts is matching with flexible wages.

<text>Idol (also known as SuperStar in some countries) is a reality television singing competition format created by British television producer Simon Fuller and developed by Fremantle. The format began in 2001 with the British television series &quot;Pop Idol&quot;; its first adaptation was the South African series &quot;Idols&quot; in 2002. It has since become the world&#x27;s most widely watched television franchise, as well as one of the most successful entertainment formats, adapted in over 56 regions around the world, with its various versions broadcast to 150 countries with a worldwide audience of roughly 3.2 billion people. The franchise has generated more than in revenue.

Each season, the series aims to find the most outstanding unsigned solo recording artist (or &quot;idol&quot;) in a region. Originally aimed for pop singers, the series has since evolved to accept singers from different genres of music, such as rock, R&amp;B, and country. Through a series of mass auditions, a group of finalists are selected by a panel of judges (which usually consists of artists and record producers) who offer critiques on their performances. The finalists then advance to the weekly live shows. On each live show, the contestants all sing, the television audience votes (by telephone, SMS Internet, and via apps), and then the contestant who receives the fewest votes gets eliminated. The final episode is the grand finale episode, when usually two, but sometimes three or four, finalists are left, and the contestant who gets the largest number of votes is declared the winner. The winner receives a recording contract, monetary prizes, and a title as their nation&#x27;s &quot;Idol&quot;, &quot;SuperStar&quot; or &quot;Star&quot;. Sometimes one or more of the runners-up get recording contracts as well.

The various series have launched the careers of a number of highly successful recording artists around the world, including &quot;Idol&quot; winners Will Young of the United Kingdom, Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood, Scotty McCreery, Fantasia, Ruben Studdard, David Cook, and Phillip Phillips of the United States, Kurt Nilsen of Norway, Ryan Malcolm and Kalan Porter of Canada, Loreen of Sweden, Guy Sebastian of Australia, and Elvis Blue of South Africa. Contestants who did not win but have still gone on to prominence include Anthony Callea, Ricki-Lee Coulter and Jessica Mauboy of Australia, Jacob Hoggard and Carly Rae Jepsen of Canada, and Clay Aiken, Chris Daughtry, Gabby Barrett, Lauren Alaina, and Adam Lambert of the United States, among many others. Some &quot;Idol&quot; contestants have also achieved success in acting and musical theater such as Melissa O&#x27;Neil of Canada, and most notably EGOT winner Jennifer Hudson of &quot;American Idol&quot;.

==Origin and background==
In 2001, British talent manager and television producer Simon Fuller created the British television series &quot;Pop Idol&quot;. The series was developed by production company Fremantle and was broadcast on ITV on 6 October 2001. Fuller, along with television producer Nigel Lythgoe, was inspired to create the series by the New Zealand television series &quot;Popstars&quot;, which was adopted in the United Kingdom as &quot;Popstars&quot; in January 2001. The first series of &quot;Pop Idol&quot; proved to be more popular than &quot;Popstars&quot;, in part due to the chemistry of the judges and the success of its first winner Will Young.

&quot;Pop Idol&quot;″s success led to an interest for adaptations in other countries. Before selling the format, Fuller reached out for an out-of-court settlement with &quot;Popstars&quot; creator Jonathan Dowling, in which international versions of &quot;Idols&quot; will be prohibited to use the prefix &quot;Pop&quot; in their local titles. As such, South Africa was the first international adaptation under the official franchise name - Idols. &quot;Idols&quot; was first televised on 10 March 2002, one month after the first series of &quot;Pop Idol&quot; ended.

Fuller, Lythgoe, and &quot;Pop Idol&quot; judge Simon Cowell attempted to sell the format in the United States in 2001, but the idea was met with poor response from major networks. Elisabeth Murdoch, daughter of News Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch, persuaded her father to buy the rights for an American adaptation. The series, &quot;American Idol: The Search for a Superstar&quot;, debuted on the Fox network on 11 June 2002. &quot;American Idol&quot; went on to become the all-time most dominant show in the U.S. TV ratings, due to the popularity of the judges (particularly Simon Cowell) and its contestants, which were led by its first winner, Kelly Clarkson.

The success brought by &quot;American Idol&quot; led to even more adaptations in other countries, where the Dutch &quot;Idols&quot; became the top television series in the Netherlands during its airing.

There has been a global version of the franchise, called &quot;World Idol&quot;. The show was a television special, where winners of national &quot;Idol&quot; shows will compete against each other. The special was won by Kurt Nilsen, a singer from Norway. A current World version of &quot;Idol&quot; acts as a YouTube channel, called &quot;Idols Global&quot;. The channel uploads clips of &quot;Idol&quot; shows from around the world. The channel currently has over 1 million subscribers. There are many more channels like this. Additionally, many individual &quot;Idol&quot; shows have their own YouTube channels.

==Concept==
The show is a reality television singing competition where the winner is selected by the audience voting. The show combines a number of elements previously used by other shows such as &quot;Popstars&quot; – mass auditioning, the search of a new star, and the use of a judging panel that critiques the auditioners&#x27; performance and selects the contestants. An important element is audience participation, where the audience may vote by telephone or text to decide which contestant can proceed further each week and ultimately win. According to the show creator, Simon Fuller, &quot;the interactivity was important because this would allow the audience to tell me who they liked best and this, in turn, would indicate to me who would have the most fans and eventually sell the most music and become the biggest stars.&quot; To this is added &quot;the drama of backstories and the real-life soap opera of the unfolding real-time events&quot; as the show is presented as a live competition event which drew &quot;more from a sporting concept of true competition&quot;.

==Format==
===Hosts===
Each show has at least one host that directs the show, introduces the singers and delivers the results of each episode including the finale. While some countries have one host (Ryan Seacrest in American Idol, Boy William in Indonesian Idol (replacing Daniel Mananta in season 3–10), Dominic Bowden in New Zealand Idol, ProVerb in Idols SA, IK Osakioduwa in Nigerian Idol and Phan Anh, Huy Khánh, Duy Hải and Đức Bảo in Vietnam Idol since the third season), most shows have two co-hosts. As well as judges, some countries have adopted new members to the hosting/jury party.

===Judges/jury===
A preselected panel of music industry representatives tour some, if not all audition cities (depending on which show) to observe and advance those auditioning throughout the show up to and including the Grand Finale. The judges offer critiques and/or advice after each contestant performance, which can be positive or negative; &quot;Nouvelle Star 4&quot; for the first time in any country introduced a red and blue &quot;score card&quot; type system where the jury award a blue &quot;positive&quot; or red &quot;negative&quot; rating and in &quot;Nouvelle Star 14&quot;, they introduced a scoring system where the jury give a point from a range of 1 to 10 after every mottoshow performance.

As many as five stable jury members have appeared in any one &quot;Idol&quot; season (&quot;Idol Poland 3&quot;, &quot;Indonesian Idol 9&quot;), though some versions offer &quot;guest judges&quot; or special musical guests on the program to also offer advice.

The judges of some shows gain a lot of popularity outside of the show as well as the contestants, due to their being collectively known to have a &quot;caustic&quot; or raw &amp; blunt attitude towards contestants&#x27; performances, notably Simon Cowell from American Idol and Pop Idol, Rossa, Judika, Bunga Citra Lestari, Ari Lasso, Anang Hermansyah, Agnez Mo, Ahmad Dhani, Titi DJ, and Indra Lesmana from Indonesian Idol, Amy Shark, Ian &quot;Dicko&quot; Dickson, and Kyle Sandilands from Australian Idol , Neha Kakkar, and Sonu Nigam, also Anu Malik from Indian Idol amongst others, and Mỹ Tâm and Maia Estianty in &quot;Vietnam Idol&quot; and &quot;Indonesian Idol&quot;.

===Performance stages===
Auditions are held in numerous places in any particular region or country that give most people (audition entry is bound by certain legal requirements such as age and citizenship for example) the chance to sing in front of musical/television producers and if successful, they advance to a recorded televised audition where the show &quot;judges&quot; advance up to 300 people in some countries to the next round.

The Theatre round is where a specially selected group of auditioners from all regional auditions converge (always in the host city) to perform in three sub stages: a &quot;chorus line&quot; in groups of 10 where free song choices are allowed, a &quot;trio&quot; (or less commonly a duo or quartet) where contestants must memorize a preselected song to perform and choreograph together, and finally a solo &quot;a cappella&quot; round where contestants sing a song of their own choice without musical backing in front of friends, family, judges &amp; fellow contestants.

Each stage of the theatre round, a number of contestants are eliminated and sent home by the judges, though in some countries there have been very few contestants brought back during the Wildcards show or by the disqualification or resignation of another contestant.

In &quot;American Idol&quot;, this stage was expanded to five stages (three in Hollywood, two in Las Vegas) from seasons 10 to 12.

The semi-finals occurs usually live or pre-recorded (in some countries) where contestants sing in a television studio fully televised; again judges give critiques but beginning at this stage, home viewers vote via telephone and SMS (and in some countries other voting mechanisms including via Internet or via Red Button) who they want to stay in the competition. During the &quot;semi-final&quot; weeks, contestants receive a workshop tuition with a vocal coach to prepare their song of choice. The format started out with contestants only singing along to a piano, though other instruments &amp; even a live band have been introduced to some versions.

An average semi-final usually consists of 18 to 50 contestants where they either perform in an even group of contestants (three groups of ten for example) or in a &quot;heat&quot; type semi-final where the contestants sing every week until all finalists have been chosen. During the format, a Wildcards feature was introduced which re-introduced past semi-finalists to receive a second chance to become a finalist, in some shows – the judges sometimes pick one or more contestants to advance as well as the viewers&#x27; vote. As of late, live audiences have been incorporated into the semi-final round.

A results show of the semi-finals usually airs either a few hours after the performance show or the night after where the results are given. Three or four contestants are told that they may have received highest votes, though only a selected two or three are put through to the finals.

The Live shows (a.k.a. Mottoshows, Spectacular shows or theme shows) are an elaborate and spectacular version of the semi-final. There is a weekly theme on which contestants must base their song choices, such as &quot;80s Hits&quot; or &quot;Hits of Elton John&quot; for example. In a bid to counter sagging ratings, contestants on &quot;Australian Idol&quot; were allowed to bring instruments on stage with them and had the opportunity to sing original material from the 2006 season, a world first. Since then America and Canada have followed Australia&#x27;s lead. Again a results show follows the show; this time it may include group performances, musical guests or extra footage of the contestants&#x27; time on the show. The contestant/s with the lowest polled votes leaves the competition. The live shows continue until there are only two contestants left in the competition or three contestants in some cases.

The Grand Finale occurs when there are two (or, rarely, three and only once so far four) contestants left in the competition. This is the pinnacle of the entire series and often highest rated show; also for some countries, it is venued in a prestigious location (&quot;American Idol&quot;: Dolby Theatre/Nokia Theatre, &quot;Canadian Idol&quot;: John Bassett Theatre, &quot;Australian Idol&quot;: Sydney Opera House, &quot;Philippine Idol&quot;: Araneta Coliseum, &quot;Indonesian Idol&quot;: Ecovention Ocean Ecopark/Hall D2 JIExpo/RCTI+ Studios, &quot;Idol Sweden&quot;: Ericsson Globe, &quot;Singapore Idol&quot;: Singapore Indoor Stadium). In this final stage a specially awarded song is sung by both remaining contestants which is ultimately slated to be released as the winner&#x27;s debut single though recently in some countries this has been phased out.

During the extended results show, there are usually group performances and/or special musical guests. Also, it has the best moments of the series which leads up to the announcement of the winner, which is determined by the highest number of votes. When that happens, he or she will perform an encore of the coronation single which sometimes includes pyrotechnics/fireworks.

While the show&#x27;s premise is to find one winner with promises of a recording deal and other frugal benefits, the Idol series often has several contestants who go onto the same route of fame, whether they be finalists, semi-finalists, or even auditioners. Key examples of this from &quot;American Idol&quot; include Clay Aiken (second place, season 2) and Chris Daughtry (fourth place, season 5, through his band Daughtry), who have each outsold all &quot;American Idol&quot; winners except Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood; Jennifer Hudson (seventh place, season 3), who would later win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress; and William Hung, who turned his off-key season 3 audition into a recording career and has outsold some finalists.

===Releases===
Often, a studio compilation album and/or a CD single is made to promote the show. In some cases, DVDs of highlights of the show will be released. While these releases have sold well in countries including the United States and Australia, many countries did not release CDs after the first series.

Since season 6, &quot;American Idol&quot; has sold only promotional downloads instead of CDs. For season 6, it sold studio-recorded MP3 and performance video downloads of the finalists on its website; no CDs were sold prior to the post-&quot;Idol&quot; releases of winner Jordin Sparks and runner-up Blake Lewis. For season 7, audio and video downloads are sold exclusively through the iTunes Store, which became a sponsor in that season; the iTunes downloads have included audio of all semi-finalist performances, studio recordings and performance videos for all finalists, videos of finalist group performances, and audio and video performances from the &quot;Idol Gives Back&quot; episode.

===Media/sponsorship===
Sony Music is the general record company associated and affiliated with the Idols format in most countries, though countries like Iceland, Vietnam and Kazakhstan have affiliate labels as they do not have a local Sony Music subsidiary. FremantleMedia and Sony Music were related through common parent Bertelsmann, which owns 90.4% of FremantleMedia&#x27;s immediate parent RTL Group and previously owned 50% of joint venture Sony BMG from 2004 to 2008. Since 2011, Universal Music Group replaced Sony Music Entertainment as the general record company associated and affiliated with the Idols format in most countries.

==Themes==
A notable commonality among Idol-format shows is the theme logo &amp; intro style.
Many different versions of the Idol logo and show intro have been created since Idol&#x27;s inception in June 2001.

===Logo===
The basic plan for the logo is an oval with the particular show&#x27;s name centered in custom lettering based on a common font (Kaufmann). Mostly the name of the show is written horizontally, however occasionally part of the name is angled upwards.

The original &quot;Pop Idol&quot; logo featured an enhanced star in the logo. The star also appeared briefly on the &quot;American Idol&quot; logo, but was scrapped early in the Season 1 auditions.

The logo for some countries comes with an underline on the words SuperStar, or Idol, such as &quot;Deutschland sucht den Superstar&quot;, &quot;Hrvatski Idol&quot;, Hrvatska traži zvijezdu, &quot;SuperStar Hrvatska&quot;, &quot;SuperStar Arab&quot;, &quot;(Česko Slovenská) SuperStar&quot;, &quot;Hay Superstar&quot;, &quot;Nouvelle Star&quot; (until 2017), &quot;Idol Puerto Rico&quot;, &quot;Idol Kids Puerto Rico&quot;, &quot;Nepal Idol&quot;, &quot;Narodniy Artist&quot;, &quot;SuperStar România&quot;, &quot;Super Idol&quot;, &quot;Bangladeshi Idol&quot;, &quot;Idol Colombia&quot;, &quot;Ídolos Kids Brasil&quot;, &quot;Cambodian Idol Junior&quot;, &quot;Indian Idol Junior&quot;, &quot;Indonesian Idol Junior&quot; and &quot;Pinoy Idol&quot; (which also has a raised word). &quot;Türkstar&quot; has the only Idol logo not to use the common font style. As part of a relaunch after the first season, the French &quot;Nouvelle Star&quot; logo was changed to purple, and their name was shortened. They are the only logo to depart from the standard blue palette until the fifth season of &quot;SuperStar Arab&quot; changed to the same color scheme as well. Several versions such as Vietnam Idol and Chinese Idol have both English and local language titles shown in their logos.

===&#x27;Intro&#x27; sequence===
Since the series debuted in 2001, this franchise has seen many variations of the opening intro. From its first creation &#x27;Idolatry&#x27; in 2001 to its latest creation &#x27;Hall of Idols 3.0&#x27; in 2023. Each show had its own version of the opening title from having a video length of the standard 30–35 seconds to some that even lasted as long as 5–10 seconds. The majority of the countries used the same intros at the same time and length of their release. While other franchises kept the older intros for a longer time or made their own versions. Here are some of the intros the series has seen over the years.

====Idolatry (2001–2006)====
The original version of the &quot;Idol&quot; intro was created by Liquid TV Graphics in London which started with the dark blue Idol logo descending on the screen. A CGI human figure appears, with arms raised, intended to be the &#x27;Idol&#x27; of the show&#x27;s name. While the Idol figure sings and then walks. Images of guitars, microphones, cameras, and airplanes flow by, representing the life of a superstar. During this, the gender of the figure alternates between male and female. Finally, the figure is again in front of the Idol logo, raising hands in victory. &quot;American Idol&quot; altered their logo in seasons 2–3, as well as displaying famous national landmarks in the first scene. They added new sound effects and replaced the jet airplanes with waving flags. The landmark and flag concepts were also used for &quot;Indian Idol&quot; and &quot;World Idol&quot;.

====Tunnel (2005–2012)====
In 2005, a new version of the &quot;Idol&quot; intro was created by Aerodrome Pictures in Los Angeles which first appeared on the Season 4 premiere of &quot;American Idol&quot;. The intro starts with the &quot;Idol&quot; logo without the dark blue background spinning in the American and Canadian versions while the other Idol formats have their logo glow and sparkle, next the logo zooms in featuring a long section of the CGI &quot;Idol&quot; figure riding an open elevator past large vertical screens and displays and then walking down a stylized tunnel to a stage, where the figure starts to perform. On this basic template, the American and Canadian versions are customized, with past &quot;Idol&quot; winners appearing on the screens in the American version, while the Canadian version&#x27;s screens feature Canadian landmarks. The American &amp; Canadian versions last for 30 seconds; the other &quot;Idol&quot; shows only lasts 15 seconds, with no customization and instead of the logo being &#x27;stuck down&#x27; to the outside of the tunnel, it is pasted over the top. Also, the intro sequence for Nouvelle Star has a purple and blue color scheme instead of the standard light blue/light green.

====Gyroscope (2008–2016, 2021-present)====
In 2008, a new version of the &quot;Idol&quot; intro was created and introduced by BLT &amp; Associates in Los Angeles on the &quot;American Idol&quot; 7th season finals. The intro starts with the Idol logo spinning behind a gyroscope then features real male and female Idol figures passing horizontal and arc displays then walking to an arena where the two figures start to perform. Finally, only one figure raises his/her hands in victory in front of a huge arc display and then zooms out to the atmosphere and to space, where the title of the show zooms out in front of planet Earth. The ending title of this intro is similar to the Universal Pictures logo of 1990 (for the starry background) and in 2012 (for the earth model). The American, Australian, Canadian, Croatian, Latin American, and Swedish versions are customized by featuring their past Idol winners in the horizontal and arc displays and last for 30 seconds. However, Sweden&#x27;s version only displayed their former Idol winners in 2010. They also displayed their 2 remaining finalists in the intro for their 2009 finale. Other versions are also customized and last for 30 seconds without featuring their past winners. The French version lasts for 20 seconds and Norway&#x27;s version in 2016 lasted 4 seconds. Some countries didn&#x27;t use the Gyroscope theme, like India and Germany. India used the Tunnel theme from 2005 to 2010. But in 2012, they switched to using the &#x27;Hall of Idols&#x27; theme. Meanwhile, Germany used the &#x27;Tunnel&#x27; theme from 2005 to 2012. From 2013 to 2021, the German version used its own intro in place of the &#x27;Gyroscope&#x27; and &#x27;Hall of Idols&#x27; intros called &quot;New Idol&quot;. Since 2021, Nigerian Idol has reverted to this opening title for their revival on Africa Magic.

====Hall of Idols (2011–present)====
In 2011, a new version of the &quot;Idol&quot; intro was created once again by Aerodrome Pictures in Los Angeles which first appeared on the Season 10 premiere of &quot;American Idol&quot;. The intro starts with a stage being spotted under a spotlight from the sky. Then, a stylized bridge leading towards a screen is shown. Winners of &quot;Idol&quot;, as well as notable alumni from past seasons are shown on the screen. The camera turns to a pyramid-like shape blooming and a CGI figure appears. Depending on the figure&#x27;s gender in the intro, the figure would yield a different action in front of the &quot;American Idol&quot; logo and the huge &quot;IDOL&quot; word string (in &quot;American Idol&quot; and &quot;Indonesian Idol&quot; (not shown anymore since Season 9). The male figure raises his hand in victory and strikes a pose while the female figure raises her arms in victory before bowing down. &quot;American Idol&quot; switched between the male and female CGI figures. While most franchises that used this intro always had the male figure. However, &quot;Arab Idol&quot;, &quot;Kurd Idol&quot; and &quot;Iraq Idol&quot; always used the female figure. Vietnam Idol started using the Hall of Idols intro in Season 5, the old logo was replaced by a new one titled &quot;Thần tượng Âm nhạc Việt Nam&quot;.

====New Idol (2013–2021)====
In 2013, a new version of the &quot;Idol&quot; Intro was created on the Season 10 premiere of &quot;Deutschland sucht den Superstar&quot;. The new intro begins with a mysterious person with a microphone at the mouth. As previous posting Intro male and female talents are displayed. They sing and dance on the big stage. In the meantime, always a person who appears followed a path. On that path along former candidates from earlier seasons are displayed on screens.

====Gyroscope 2.0 (2014-2023)====
In 2014, a new version of the &quot;Idol&quot; intro was created by The Mill in Los Angeles which first appeared on the Season 13 premiere of &quot;American Idol&quot;. The intro starts with a hole opening up. Then, the gyroscope logo comes out of the hole. A crowd cheers surroding the stage. Finally, the gyroscope logo appears with the Roman numerals &quot;XIII&quot; below the logo for the American version. The intro was also used in the South African version of Idol also starting in 2014 until their cancellation in 2023.

====Idol on Street (2015)====
In 2015, a new version of the &quot;Idol&quot; intro was created by Trollbäck + Company and appeared on the Season 14 premiere of &quot;American Idol&quot;. It starts by zooming out of a microphone on a mic stand with a spotlight coming out of it. Next you see a female CGI figure singing into the microphone on a city street with multiple microphones having spotlights come out of them. The female figure is also in front of a sunset while having other CGI figures dancing and watching the singer perform from the sidewalks. Next it cuts to an American Idol tour bus driving on the road with a line of microphones having spotlights come out of them next to the bus while having a male CGI figure in the sunset singing into the microphone. Then it cuts to a big hill with more microphones with spotlights and 4 CGI figures appear with 3 of them singing and 1 playing guitar. Finally it zooms out of another microphone with a spotlight with another CGI figure singing as the American Idol and the huge American Idol logo is titled to the left with the roman numerals &quot;XIV&quot; on the bottom right corner of the logo. The CGI figure at the end will also switch between a male and female figure. However, in the season finale, the intro featured the 2 remaining finalists as the CGI figures.

====The Farewell of Idol (2016)====
In 2016, a new version of the &quot;Idol&quot; intro was created by Spencer Tucker and appeared on the Season 15 premiere of &quot;American Idol&quot;. It starts by zooming into the American Idol logo which is surrounded by names of previous Idol contestants throughout the years. On the season premiere, it started the same and then had a montage of the previous intros that they used in reverse. They used the same intro concept on the season finale and didn&#x27;t reverse the montage.

====Hall of Idols 2.0 (2016–2017)====
In 2016, a new version of the &quot;Idol&quot; intro was created and appeared on the Season 5 premiere of &quot;Idols&quot; in The Netherlands. It starts by panning around city buildings surrounding a stage with light beams popping out of the spotlights, then it cuts to a sign that will say the current stage of the competition. Next it cuts to a building showing the map of the country and another building showing the judges desk while the camera turns to the left and moves up. Finally, you will see a spotlight in the middle of the stage appearing with the Idols logo appearing with a female CGI figure singing as the Idol and an audience watching the Idol perform.

====Shooting Star Idol (2018-present)====
&quot;American Idol&quot;″s revival on ABC was accompanied with a Disney-like intro starting with their Season 16 premiere. Which was created by Spencer Tucker and Rami Hachache. Possible Productions were added to the credits for seasons 18 and 19 only. It starts with several shooting stars falling from the sky before curving up and circling the neon American Idol logo with fireworks in the background at the end. This opening is much shorter than in previous years. It acts as an integrated part of a longer opening introduction in each episode rather than a standalone opening theme as in previous seasons. &quot;Ídolos&quot; (Portugal) used this intro in 2022 for their revival on SIC. &quot;Australian Idol&quot; also used this opening title for their revival starting in 2023 on 7 and 7+. &quot;Deutschland sucht den Superstar&quot; had a similar version of this intro in 2022, but they used a blue background with shooting stars.

====20th Anniversary Idol (2022)====
&quot;American Idol&quot;″s 20th season brought in a new intro which appeared on the season finale, created by The Other House in Los Angeles. It starts with a closeup of the logo at the top of the 2 in &#x27;20&#x27; and tracing itself with gold lines as the camera pans to the right. Next, you will see the middle of 2 and 0 panning to the bottom left of the logo. Then you&#x27;ll notice the left half of the logo while it pans to the right. Finally, the camera comes in from the bottom right corner and you&#x27;ll see the entire logo and then it zooms into the middle of the logo and cuts to the studio.

====Transparent Idol (2023-present)====

&quot;American Idol&quot; brought in a new intro which appeared on the twenty-first-season premiere. This time it was transparent. Once again created by The Other House in Los Angeles. There are 2 versions of this opening title. The first one starts with the logo appearing vertically from behind the camera and the word &#x27;American&#x27; comes in on top of the word &#x27;Idol&#x27; facing the left side of the screen and turns to the right as it comes in. The world &#x27;Idol&#x27; comes in under the word &#x27;American&#x27; and is slightly turned to the right but turns itself to the left as it forms the logo. Finally the logo faces slightly towards the left side of the screen and stays in position. The second version only has the logo coming in the frame horizontally and facing up. Next it comes down as the logo moves into the frame. Finally you&#x27;ll see the whole logo sitting still in the frame.

====Hall of Idols 3.0 (2023–present)====

In 2023, a new version of the &quot;Idol&quot; intro was created. It appeared on &quot;Vietnam Idol&quot; Season 8 revival, which was the remake of the original Hall of Idol intro with some differences such as the opening which became shorter, similar to 2018 ABC&#x27;s Idol intro, different background color and the opening uses an English title (Vietnam Idol) instead of its traditional Vietnamese title &quot;Thần tượng Âm nhạc Việt Nam&quot; which was used from Seasons 5–7.

<text>Paul Langevin (; ; 23 January 1872 – 19 December 1946) was a French physicist who developed Langevin dynamics and the Langevin equation. He was one of the founders of the &quot;Comité de vigilance des intellectuels antifascistes&quot;, an anti-fascist organization created after the 6 February 1934 far right riots. Being a public opponent of fascism in the 1930s resulted in his arrest and being held under house arrest by the Vichy government for most of World War II. Langevin was also president of the Human Rights League (LDH) from 1944 to 1946, having recently joined the French Communist Party.

He was a doctoral student of Pierre Curie and later a lover of widowed Marie Curie. He is also known for his two US patents with Constantin Chilowsky in 1916 and 1917 involving submarine detection.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1258/ult.2011.011027&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He is entombed at the Panthéon.

== Life ==
Langevin was born in Paris, and studied at the &quot;École de Physique et Chimie&quot; and the &quot;École Normale Supérieure&quot;. He then went to the University of Cambridge and studied in the Cavendish Laboratory under Sir J. J. Thomson. Langevin returned to the Sorbonne and obtained his PhD from Pierre Curie in 1902. In 1904, he became Professor of Physics at the &quot;Collège de France&quot;. In 1926, he became director of the &quot;École de Physique et Chimie&quot; (later became &quot;École supérieure de physique et de chimie industrielles de la Ville de Paris&quot;, &quot;ESPCI ParisTech&quot;), where he had been educated. He was elected in 1934 to the Académie des sciences.
Langevin is noted for his work on paramagnetism and diamagnetism, and devised the modern interpretation of this phenomenon in terms of spins of electrons within atoms. His most famous work was in the use of ultrasound using Pierre Curie&#x27;s piezoelectric effect. During World War I, he began working on the use of these sounds to detect submarines through echo location. However the war was over by the time it was operational. During his career, Paul Langevin also spread the theory of relativity in academic circles in France and created what is now called the twin paradox.

In 1898, he married Emma Jeanne Desfosses, and together they had four children, Jean, André, Madeleine and Hélène.

In 1910, he reportedly had an affair with the then-widowed Marie Curie; some decades later, their respective grandchildren, grandson Michel Langevin and granddaughter Hélène Langevin-Joliot married one another. He was also noted for being an outspoken opponent of Nazism, and was removed from his post by the Vichy government following the occupation of the country by Nazi Germany. He was later restored to his position in 1944. He died in Paris in 1946, two years after living to see the Liberation of Paris. He is buried near several other prominent French scientists in the Panthéon in Paris.

In 1933, he had a son with physicist Eliane Montel (1898–1993), Paul-Gilbert Langevin, who became a renowned musicologist.

His daughter, Hélène Solomon-Langevin, was arrested for Resistance activity and survived several concentration camps. She was on the same convoy of female political prisoners as Marie-Claude Vaillant-Couturier and Charlotte Delbo.

== Submarine detection ==
In 1916 and 1917, Paul Langevin and Chilowsky filed two US patents disclosing the first ultrasonic submarine detector using an electrostatic method (singing condenser) for one patent and thin quartz crystals for the other. The amount of time taken by the signal to travel to the enemy submarine and echo back to the ship on which the device was mounted was used to calculate the distance under water.

In 1916, Lord Ernest Rutherford, working in the UK with his former McGill University PhD student Robert William Boyle, revealed that they were developing a quartz piezoelectric detector for submarine detection. Langevin&#x27;s successful application of the use of piezoelectricity in the generation and detection of ultrasound waves was followed by further development.

<doc id="681416" wikidata="Q381827" url="?curid=681416" title="Paul Andreu">
<text>Paul Andreu (10 July 1938 – 11 October 2018) was a French architect, known for his designs of multiple airports such as Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, and multiple prestigious projects in China, including the National Centre for the Performing Arts in Beijing.

== Early life and education ==
Andreu was born at Caudéran (Gironde), in southwest France. He graduated in 1958 from the École Polytechnique and continued his studies at the École des ponts ParisTech, graduating in 1961. He next studied under architect Paul Lamarche in the École des Beaux-Arts, graduating in 1968.

== Projects ==
Andreu was responsible for the design of numerous airports, including Ninoy Aquino International Airport (Manila), Soekarno-Hatta International Airport (Jakarta), Shanghai Pudong International Airport in China, Abu Dhabi International Airport, Dubai International Airport, Tehran Imam Khomeini International Airport, Cairo International Airport, Brunei International Airport, and the Charles de Gaulle Airport, and Orly Airport in Paris. 

He was in charge of planning and constructing Charles de Gaulle Airport (Roissy) in Paris from 1967 on. On 23 May 2004 a portion of Terminal 2E collapsed, killing four people. Terminal 2E, inaugurated in 2003, is the seventh terminal at Roissy by Andreu, and has been described as one of Andreu&#x27;s boldest designs. The collapse was attributed by the ad hoc administrative enquiry commission to a variety of technical causes and the lack of margins of safety in the design. Andreu blamed the collapse on poor execution by the building companies.

Andreu&#x27;s other projects included the Grande Arche at La Défense in Paris (as associate of Johann Otto von Spreckelsen) and the National Grand Theater of China enclosed in a titanium and glass shell near Beijing&#x27;s Tiananmen Square which was inaugurated on 22 December 2007.

In 2008, Andreu was hired to design a cultural centre and ticket office in Montreal&#x27;s new Quartier des Spectacles entertainment district.

== Other activities==

In 2011, Andreu became dean emeritus and chair professor of the Architecture Department at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China, where he taught three months per year. In 2015 and 2016, he was a member of the Prix Versailles judges panel.

<doc id="681433" wikidata="Q2165325" url="?curid=681433" title="Death poem">
<text>The death poem is a genre of poetry that developed in the literary traditions of the Sinosphere—most prominently in Japan as well as certain periods of Chinese history, Joseon Korea, and Vietnam. They tend to offer a reflection on death—both in general and concerning the imminent death of the author—that is often coupled with a meaningful observation on life. The practice of writing a death poem has its origins in Zen Buddhism. It is a concept or worldview derived from the Buddhist teaching of the , specifically that the material world is transient and , that attachment to it causes , and ultimately all reality is an . These poems became associated with the literate, spiritual, and ruling segments of society, as they were customarily composed by a poet, warrior, nobleman, or Buddhist monk.

The writing of a poem at the time of one&#x27;s death and reflecting on the nature of death in an impermanent, transitory world is unique to East Asian culture. It has close ties with Buddhism, and particularly the mystical Zen Buddhism (of Japan), Chan Buddhism (of China), Seon Buddhism (of Korea), and Thiền Buddhism (of Vietnam). From its inception, Buddhism has stressed the importance of death because awareness of death is what prompted the Buddha to perceive the ultimate futility of worldly concerns and pleasures. A death poem exemplifies the search for a new viewpoint, a new way of looking at life and things generally, or a version of enlightenment (&quot;satori&quot; in Japanese;&quot; wu&quot; in Chinese). According to comparative religion scholar Julia Ching, Japanese Buddhism &quot;is so closely associated with the memory of the dead and the ancestral cult that the family shrines dedicated to the ancestors, and still occupying a place of honor in homes, are popularly called the &quot;Butsudan&quot;, literally &#x27;the Buddhist altars&#x27;. It has been the custom in modern Japan to have Shinto weddings, but to turn to Buddhism in times of bereavement and for funeral services&quot;.

The writing of a death poem was limited to the society&#x27;s literate class, ruling class, samurai, and monks. It was introduced to Western audiences during World War II when Japanese soldiers, emboldened by their culture&#x27;s samurai legacy, would write poems before suicidal missions or battles.

==Chinese death poems==

=== Yuan Chonghuan ===

Yuan Chonghuan (, 1584–1630) was a politician and military general who served under the Ming dynasty. He is best known for defending Liaodong from Jurchen invaders during the Later Jin invasion of the Ming. Yuan met his end when he was arrested and executed by lingchi (&quot;slow slicing&quot;) on the order of the Chongzhen Emperor under false charges of treason, which were believed to have been planted against him by the Jurchens. Before his execution, he produced the following poem.

=== Xia Wanchun ===
Xia Wanchun (, 1631–1647) was a Ming dynasty poet and soldier. He is famous for resisting the Manchu invaders and died aged 17. He wrote the poem before his death.

=== Zheng Ting ===
Zheng Ting (; died 621) was a politician in the end of the Sui dynasty. He was executed by Wang Shichong after trying to resign from his official position under Wang and become a Buddhist monk. He faced the execution without fear and wrote this death poem, which reflected his strong Buddhist belief.

=== Yang Jisheng ===

Yang Jisheng (; 1516 – 1555) was a Chinese court official of the Ming dynasty who held multiple posts during the reign of the Jiajing Emperor. He was executed because of his stand against political opponent Yan Song. The evening before his execution, Yang Jisheng wrote a poem which was preserved on monuments and in later accounts of his life. It reads:

=== Wen Tianxiang ===
Wen Tianxiang (; 1236 – 1283) was a Chinese poet and politician in the last years of the Southern Song dynasty. He was executed by Kublai Khan for the uprisings against Yuan dynasty.

=== Tan Sitong ===
Tan Sitong (; March 10, 1865 – September 28, 1898) was a well-known Chinese politician, thinker, and reformist in the late Qing dynasty (1644–1911). He was executed at the age of 33 when the Hundred Days&#x27; Reform failed in 1898. Tan Sitong was one of the six gentlemen of the Hundred Days&#x27; Reform, and occupies an important place in modern Chinese history.

==Japanese death poems==
===Style and technique===

The poem&#x27;s structure can be in one of many forms, including the two traditional forms in Japanese literature: &quot;kanshi&quot; or &quot;waka&quot;. Sometimes they are written in the three-line, seventeen-syllable haiku form, although the most common type of death poem (called a &quot;jisei&quot; ) is in the &quot;waka&quot; form called the &quot;tanka&quot; (also called a &quot;jisei-ei&quot; ) which consists of five lines totaling 31 syllables (5-7-5-7-7)—a form that constitutes over half of surviving death poems (Ogiu, 317–318).

Poetry has long been a core part of Japanese tradition. Death poems are typically graceful, natural, and emotionally neutral, in accordance with the teachings of Buddhism and Shinto. Excepting the earliest works of this tradition, it has been considered inappropriate to mention death explicitly; rather, metaphorical references such as sunsets, autumn or falling cherry blossom suggest the transience of life.

It was an ancient custom in Japan for literate persons to compose a &quot;jisei&quot; on their deathbed. One of the earliest was recited by Prince Ōtsu, executed in 686. More examples of &quot;jisei&quot; are those of the famous haiku poet Bashō, the Japanese Buddhist monk Ryōkan, Edo Castle builder Ōta Dōkan, the monk Gesshū Sōko, and the woodblock master Tsukioka Yoshitoshi. The custom has continued into modern Japan. Some people left their death poems in multiple forms: Prince Ōtsu made both &quot;waka&quot; and &quot;kanshi&quot;, and Sen no Rikyū made both &quot;kanshi&quot; and &quot;kyōka&quot;.

Fujiwara no Teishi, the first empress of Emperor Ichijo, was also known as a poet. Before her death in childbirth in 1001, she wrote three &quot;waka&quot; to express her sorrow and love to her servant, Sei Shōnagon, and the emperor. Teishi said that she would be entombed, rather than be cremated, so that she wrote that she will not become dust or cloud. The first one was selected into the poem collection Ogura Hyakunin Isshu.

On March 17, 1945, General Tadamichi Kuribayashi, the Japanese commander-in chief during the Battle of Iwo Jima, sent a final letter to Imperial Headquarters. In the message, General Kuribayashi apologized for failing to successfully defend Iwo Jima against the overwhelming forces of the United States military. At the same time, however, he expressed great pride in the heroism of his men, who, starving and thirsty, had been reduced to fighting with rifle butts and fists. He closed the message with three traditional death poems in &quot;waka&quot; form.

In 1970, writer Yukio Mishima and his disciple Masakatsu Morita composed death poems before their attempted coup at the Ichigaya garrison in Tokyo, where they committed seppuku. Mishima wrote:

Although he did not compose any formal death poem on his deathbed, the last poem written by Bashō (1644–1694), recorded by his disciple Takarai Kikaku during his final illness, is generally accepted as his poem of farewell:

Despite the seriousness of the subject matter, some Japanese poets have employed levity or irony in their final compositions. The Zen monk Tokō (杜口; 1710–1795) commented on the pretentiousness of some &quot;jisei&quot; in his own death poem:

This poem by Moriya Sen&#x27;an (d. 1838) showed an expectation of an entertaining afterlife:

The final line, &quot;hopefully the cask will leak&quot; (&quot;mori ya sen nan)&quot;, is a play on the poet&#x27;s name, Moriya Sen&#x27;an.

Written over a large calligraphic character 死 &quot;shi&quot;, meaning Death, the Japanese Zen master Hakuin Ekaku (白隠 慧鶴; 1685–1768) wrote as his jisei:

==Korean death poems==
Besides Korean Buddhist monks, Confucian scholars called seonbis sometimes wrote death poems ( ). However, better-known examples are those written or recited by famous historical figures facing death when they were executed for loyalty to their former king or due to insidious plot. They are therefore impromptu verses, often declaring their loyalty or steadfastness. The following are some examples that are still learned by school children in Korea as models of loyalty. These examples are written in Korean sijo (three lines of 3-4-3-4 or its variation) or in Hanja five-syllable format (5-5-5-5 for a total of 20 syllables) of ancient Chinese poetry (五言詩).

=== Yi Gae ===
Yi Gae (이개; 1417–1456) was one of &quot;six martyred ministers&quot; who were executed for conspiring to assassinate King Sejo, who usurped the throne from his nephew Danjong. Sejo offered to pardon six ministers including Yi Gae and Seong Sam-mun if they would repent their crime and accept his legitimacy, but Yi Gae and all others refused. He recited the following poem in his cell before execution on June 8, 1456. In the following sijo, &quot;Lord&quot; ( ) actually should read &quot;someone beloved or cherished&quot;, meaning King Danjong in this instance.

===Seong Sam-mun===
Like Yi Gae, Seong Sam-mun (성삼문, 1418–1456) was one of &quot;six martyred ministers&quot;, and was the leader of the conspiracy to assassinate Sejo. He refused the offer of pardon and denied Sejo&#x27;s legitimacy. He recited the following sijo in prison and the second one (five-syllable poem) on his way to the place of execution, where his limbs were tied to oxen and torn apart.

===Jo Gwang-jo===
Jo Gwang-jo (조광조; 1482–1519) was a neo-Confucian reformer who was framed by the conservative faction opposing his reforms in the Third Literati Purge of 1519. His political enemies slandered Jo to be disloyal by writing &quot;Jo will become the king&quot; ( , ) with honey on leaves so that caterpillars left behind the same phrase as if in supernatural manifestation. King Jungjong ordered his death by sending poison and abandoned Jo&#x27;s reform measures. Jo, who had believed to the end that Jungjong would see his errors, wrote the following before drinking poison on December 20, 1519. Repetition of similar looking words is used to emphasize strong conviction in this five-syllable poem.

===Chŏng Mong-ju===
Chŏng Mong-ju (정몽주; 1337–1392) was an influential high minister of the Goryeo dynasty when Yi Sŏng-gye sought to overthrow it and establish a new dynasty. When Yi Pang-wŏn, the son of Yi Sŏng-gye, asked Chŏng to support the founding of a new dynasty through a poem, Chŏng answered with a poem of his own reaffirming his loyalty to the falling Goryeo dynasty. Just as he suspected, he was assassinated the same night on April 4, 1392. Chŏng&#x27;s death poem is the most famous in Korean history.

=== Hwang Hyun ===
Hwang Hyun (or Hyeon) (황현; 1855–1910) was a Korean independence activist in the early 20th century. His art name was Maecheon (매천; 梅泉), and he was the author of the Maecheon Yarok (매천야록; 梅泉野錄), his diary of six volumes written from 1864 to 1910. Its detailed record of Korean historical events of the late 19th century makes it a notable primary source in the research and education about the late Joseon dynasty and Korean Empire, for example, it is used in the creation of modern textbooks. He showed great respect to other Korean independence activists, writing poems of mourning for activists who committed suicide after the signing of the Eulsa Treaty of 1905. However, in 1910, he himself would commit suicide after the annexation of Korea. He left four death poems, with this poem, the third one being the most well-known nowadays.

== Vietnamese death poems ==
In Vietnam, death poems are referred to as thơ tuyệt mệnh (chữ Hán: 詩絶命). These poems were commonly written in the Thất ngôn tứ tuyệt (七言四絶) form following Tang dynasty poetic form. This genre of poems were especially significant during the French conquest of Vietnam. The poems can be either written in Hán văn (漢文; Literary Chinese) or Vietnamese written in chữ Nôm (𡨸喃).

=== Hồ Huân Nghiệp ===
Hồ Huân Nghiệp (胡勳業; 1829–1864) was an influential scholar during the Nguyễn dynasty. He was also well known for being one of the first to fight against the French. The French eventually captured him in Gia Định (嘉定; present-day Ho Chi Minh City). Before he was executed by the French, he washed his face, fixed his turban, and recited four verses of poetry before being beheaded.

=== Hoàng Phan Thái ===
Hoàng Phan Thái (黄潘泰; 1819–1865) was a reformist and revolutionary during the reign of Emperor Tự Đức (嗣德帝). Advocating for the modernization of Vietnam, he proposed the creation of a new political party to implement reforms and challenge the stagnation of the Nguyễn dynasty. To rally support for his cause, he adopted the title Grand General of the Eastern Sea (東海大將軍; Đông Hải Đại Tướng Quân). In collaboration with Lê Duy Uẩn (黎維蘊) and Nguyễn Thịnh (阮盛), Hoàng Phan Thái sought to overthrow Tự Đức&#x27;s regime through a military uprising and to resist the French colonialists. Their strategy involved leveraging coastal forces and rallying support in the Nghệ Tĩnh region, with plans to weaken the Nguyễn dynasty&#x27;s central power. Despite their efforts, the uprising ultimately failed, and Hoàng Phan Thái was captured and executed for his revolutionary activities. Before his death, he wrote a death poem.
=== Lưu Thường ===
Lưu Thường (劉常; 1345–1388) was a Vietnamese official of the Trần dynasty. He is most notably remembered for his involvement in a failed plot to rescue Trần Phế Đế (陳廢帝). In 1388, Hồ Quý Ly (胡季犛), a powerful and ambitious official, manipulated the retired emperor, Trần Nghệ Tông (陳藝宗) into forcing Trần Phế Đế to commit suicide by hanging. Lưu Thường, along with Nguyễn Khoái (阮快) and Nguyễn Vân Nhi (阮雲兒), planned to save Trần Phế Đế, but their efforts were discovered, and all participants in the plot were executed. Before his death, Lưu Thường wrote a famous death poem that reflected his unwavering loyalty and sense of righteousness. His death poem is found in the eighth volume (卷之八) of Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư.

=== Nguyễn Sư Phó ===
Nguyễn Sư Phó (阮瑡傅; 1458–1519) was a Vietnamese court official of the Lê dynasty. He was well known for installing Lê Bảng (黎榜) as the new emperor (Đại Đức; 大德) after a series of rebellions and unrest. Around March 1519, Trịnh Tuy (鄭綏) deposed Lê Bảng and installed Bảng&#x27;s younger brother, Lê Do (黎槱), as emperor, changing the era name to Thiên Hiến (天憲). In July 1519, during a heavy rainstorm, Lê Chiêu Tông&#x27;s general, Mạc Đăng Dung (莫登庸), led both naval and land forces to besiege Emperor Thiên Hiến at Từ Liêm. Nguyễn Sư Phó fled to Ninh Sơn but were captured by Lê Chiêu Tông&#x27;s forces and taken prisoner. Before Nguyễn Sư Phó was executed, he wrote a death poem. His death poem is found in the fifteenth volume (卷之十五) of Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư.

=== Phan Thanh Giản ===
Phan Thanh Giản was a Nguyễn dynasty official who held position of Hiệp biện Đại học sĩ (協辦大學士; Assistant to the Grand Secretariat). He was most well known for negotiating the Treaty of Saigon which led to three provinces being ceded to the France. On 20 June 1867, the French captured the city of Vĩnh Long. Phan Thanh Giản who had been to France and knew overwhelming military strength of the French, surrendered the citadel without resistance, under the condition that the French would ensure the safety of the local population. After the fall of the citadel, Phan Thanh Giản wrote a death poem and committed suicide at the age of 72.

=== Nguyễn Trung Trực ===
Nguyễn Trung Trực (阮忠直; 1838–1868) was a Vietnamese fisherman who organized and led village militia forces which fought against French colonial forces in the Mekong Delta in southern Vietnam in the 1860s. After Nguyễn Trung Trực captured the French citadel in Rạch Giá, the French had taken his mother hostage. The French ended up regaining control of the citadel and captured Nguyễn Trung Trực. Nguyễn Trung Trực was beheaded by the French at Rạch Giá on October 27, 1868. Nguyễn Trung Trực wrote a death poem shortly before his death.

<text>In finance, a total return swap (TRS), total rate of return swap (TRORS), or cash-settled equity swap is a financial contract that transfers both the credit risk and market risk of an underlying asset.

== Contract definition ==

A swap agreement in which one party makes payments based on a set rate, either fixed or variable, while the other party makes payments based on the return of an underlying asset, which includes both the income it generates and any capital gains. In total return swaps, the underlying asset, referred to as the reference asset, is usually an equity index, loans, or bonds. This is owned by the party receiving the set rate payment.

Total return swaps allow the party receiving the total return to gain exposure and benefit from a reference asset without actually having to own it. These swaps are popular with hedge funds because they get the benefit of a large exposure with a minimal cash outlay.

In a total return swap, an investment bank could buy assets for a hedge fund, which is paid returns from the assets. The hedge fund can thereby remain anonymous insofar as the investment bank is the owner. If the value of the assets drop considerably, and the hedge fund is unable to provide more collateral on a margin call from the investment bank, the investment bank can sell the assets.

High-cost borrowers who seek financing and leverage, such as hedge funds, are natural receivers in Total Return Swaps.
Lower cost borrowers, with large balance sheets, are natural payers.

Less common, but related, are the partial return swap and the partial return reverse swap agreements, which usually involve 50% of the return, or some other specified amount. Reverse swaps involve the sale of the asset with the seller then buying the returns, usually on equities.

== Advantage of using total return swaps ==

The TRORS allows one party (bank B) to derive the economic benefit of owning an asset without putting that asset on its balance sheet, and allows the other (bank A, which does retain that asset on its balance sheet) to buy protection against loss in its value.

TRORS can be categorised as a type of credit derivative, although the product combines both market risk and credit risk, and so is not a pure credit derivative.

==Users==
Hedge funds use total return swaps to obtain leverage on the reference assets: they can receive the return of the asset, typically from a bank (which has a funding cost advantage), without having to put out the cash to buy the asset. They usually post a smaller amount of collateral upfront, thus obtaining leverage.

Hedge funds (such as The Children&#x27;s Investment Fund (TCI)) have attempted to use total return swaps to side-step public disclosure requirements enacted under the Williams Act. As discussed in &quot;CSX Corp. v. The Children&#x27;s Investment Fund Management&quot;, TCI argued that it was not the beneficial owner of the shares referenced by its total return swaps and therefore the swaps did not require TCI to publicly disclose that it had acquired a stake of more than 5% in CSX. The United States District Court rejected this argument and enjoined TCI from further violations of Section 13(d) Securities Exchange Act and the SEC-Rule promulgated thereunder.

Total return swaps are also very common in many structured finance transactions such as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). CDO Issuers often enter TRS agreements as protection seller in order to leverage the returns for the structure&#x27;s debt investors. By selling protection, the CDO gains exposure to the underlying asset(s) without having to put up capital to purchase the assets outright. The CDO gains the interest receivable on the reference asset(s) over the period while the counterparty mitigates their credit risk.

<text>Commander Venus was an American emo band from Omaha, Nebraska. Fronted by Conor Oberst and Tim Kasher, the band also included Todd Fink and Matt Bowen of The Faint, Ben Armstrong of Head of Femur and Robb Nansel, executive producer of the indie label Saddle Creek. Kasher subsequently went on to front the band Cursive, and Oberst later became famous as the core member of the indie folk collective Bright Eyes, and later the punk band Desaparecidos.

They recorded two albums, &quot;Do You Feel at Home?&quot; on Saddle Creek and &quot;The Uneventful Vacation&quot;, on Grass Records, which became Wind-up Records, that ultimately licensed the CD to Thick Records.

<text>Bonneville is an impact crater on Mars. It is located within the much larger crater Gusev. Bonneville was visited by the Mars Exploration Rover &quot;Spirit&quot; in 2004, during its exploration of the floor of Gusev. Bonneville is also the final resting place of &quot;Spirit&quot;″s heat shield, jettisoned during the landing procedure; the heat-shield could be seen glinting on the opposite wall when &quot;Spirit&quot; photographed the crater. The crater is 210 metres in diameter, 14 meters deep and its rim rises 6.4 metres above the surrounding terrain.

Bonneville is named after Benjamin Bonneville and Lake Bonneville, an ancient lake in Utah.

==Formation and geology==
The strata into which Bonneville formed is thought to be loose debris, although some of the ejecta may have originated from more competent rocks. No underlying bedrock was exposed in the crater or the numerous craterlets in Bonneville&#x27;s walls. The crater is relatively pristine and in particular has not been affected by water based erosion.

It is likely that Bonneville is a secondary crater, given its low depth to diameter ratio.

<doc id="681451" wikidata="Q1100454" url="?curid=681451" title="Clemson-class destroyer">
<text>The &quot;Clemson&quot; class was a series of 156 destroyers (6 more were cancelled and never begun) which served with the United States Navy from after World War I through World War II.

The &quot;Clemson&quot;-class ships were commissioned by the United States Navy from 1919 to 1922, built by Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Company, New York Shipbuilding Corporation, William Cramp &amp; Sons, Bethlehem Steel Corporation, Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Norfolk Naval Shipyard and Bath Iron Works, some quite rapidly. The &quot;Clemson&quot; class was a minor redesign of the for greater fuel capacity and was the last pre-World War II class of flush-deck destroyers to be built for the United States. Until the , the &quot;Clemson&quot;s were the most numerous class of destroyers commissioned in the United States Navy and were known colloquially as &quot;flush-deckers”, &quot;four-stackers&quot; or &quot;four-pipers&quot;.

==Design evolution==
As finally built, the &quot;Clemson&quot; class would be a fairly straightforward expansion of the &quot;Wickes&quot;-class destroyers. While the &quot;Wickes&quot; class had given good service there was a desire to build a class more tailored towards the anti-submarine role, and as such several design studies were completed, mainly about increasing the ships&#x27; range. These designs included a reduction in speed to between by eliminating two boilers, freeing up displacement for depth charges and more fuel. This proposal foreshadowed the destroyer escorts of World War II. 

Upgrading the gun armament from to guns was also considered, but only five ships (DD-231 to DD-235) were armed with 5-inch guns. In addition, the tapered stern of the &quot;Wickes&quot;-class destroyers resulted in a large turning radius and a correction to this defect was also sought, although this was not corrected in the final design. In the end the General Board decided the speed be retained so as to allow the &quot;Clemson&quot; class to be used as a fleet escort. The pressing need for destroyers overruled any change that would slow production compared to the proceeding &quot;Wickes&quot; class. Wing tanks for fuel oil were installed on either side of the ships to increase the operational range. This design choice meant the fuel oil would be stored above the waterline and create additional vulnerability, but the Navy felt a range was worth the risk. Additional improvements included provisions for 5-inch guns to be installed at a later date, an enlarged rudder to help reduce the turn radius, and an additional anti-aircraft gun on the after deck-house.

The class resulted from a General Board recommendation for further destroyers to combat the submarine threat, culminating in a total of 267 &quot;Wickes&quot;- and &quot;Clemson&quot;-class destroyers completed. However, the design of the ships remained optimized for operation with the battleship fleet.

== Armament ==

The main armament was the same as the &quot;Wickes&quot; class: four /50 caliber guns and twelve torpedo tubes. The Mark 8 torpedo was initially equipped, and probably remained the standard torpedo for this class, as 600 Mark 8 torpedoes were issued to the British in 1940 as part of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement.

Although the design provided for two anti-aircraft (AA) guns, most ships carried a single /23 caliber AA gun, typically on the aft deckhouse. A frequent modification was replacing the aft 4-inch gun with the 3-inch gun to make more room for the depth charge tracks. Anti-submarine (ASW) armament was added during or after construction. Typically, two depth charge tracks were provided aft, along with a Y-gun depth charge projector forward of the aft deckhouse.

Despite the provision for 5-inch guns, only seven ships were built with an increased gun armament. and had twin 4-inch/50 mounts for a total of eight guns, while DD 231–235 had four /51 caliber guns in place of the 4-inch guns.

== In operation ==
As with the preceding &quot;Wickes&quot; class, the fleet found that the tapered cruiser stern, which made for a nice depth charge deployment feature, dug into the water and increased the turning radius, thus hampering anti-submarine work. While an increased rudder size helped, the answer would be in a redesigned stern, but this was not implemented. They were reported to be prone to heavy rolling in light load conditions. The flush deck gave the hull great strength but this also made the deck very wet.

== Ships in class ==
156 &quot;Clemson&quot;-class destroyers were built, with an additional six cancelled.

== History ==
Fourteen ships of the class were involved in the Honda Point Disaster (aka Point Pedernales) in 1923, of which seven were lost.

Many never saw wartime service, as a significant number were decommissioned in 1930 and scrapped as part of the London Naval Treaty. About 40 &quot;Clemson&quot;-class destroyers with Yarrow boilers were scrapped or otherwise disposed of in 1930–31, as these boilers wore out quickly in service. Flush-deckers in reserve were commissioned as replacements. In 1936 only some 169 of the flush deck destroyers would be left, four &quot;Caldwell&quot; class and the rest &quot;Wickes&quot; and &quot;Clemson&quot; class. In 1937 four &quot;Clemson&quot; class were converted to destroyer minelayers (hull classification symbol DM), joining several &quot;Wickes&quot;-class ships in this role.

Nineteen were transferred to the Royal Navy in 1940 as part of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement, where they became part of the . Others were upgraded or converted to high-speed transports (APD), high-speed minesweepers (DMS), destroyer minelayers (DM), or seaplane tenders (AVD) and served through World War II. Four &quot;Wickes&quot;-class DM conversions and the four &quot;Clemson&quot;-class DM conversions survived to serve in World War II.
Most ships remaining in service during World War II were rearmed with dual-purpose 3-inch/50 caliber guns to provide better anti-aircraft protection. The AVD seaplane tender conversions received two guns; the APD high-speed transport, DM minelayer, and DMS minesweeper conversions received three guns, and those retaining destroyer classification received six. Their original low-angle 4-inch/50 caliber guns (Mark 9) were transferred to Defensively Equipped Merchant Ships for anti-submarine protection. For the ships converted to minesweepers, the twelve 21-inch torpedo tubes were replaced by minesweeping gear.

 was scuttled at Soerabaja on 2 March 1942, following the surrender of the Dutch East Indies to the Japanese. She was raised, repaired and recommissioned as Japanese patrol boat &quot;PB-102&quot; by the Imperial Japanese Navy. She was surrendered to the US Navy following the end of World War II and was used as a target for aircraft. In addition, 17 &quot;Clemson&quot;-class destroyers were lost during the war.

The wrecks of three &quot;Clemson&quot;-class destroyers remain in the San Francisco Bay area, a few miles north of Mare Island Navy Yard on the Napa River, in the southern part of the Bay where it was used as a bombing target in World War II, and the aforementioned USS &quot;Stewart&quot; in what is now the Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary.

A number of ships in the class were christened by the initial batch of women who enlisted in the Navy as Yeoman (F) in World War I. The USS &quot;Hatfield&quot; (DD-231) was sponsored by Mrs. J. Edmond Haugh (Helen Brooks) who had been a Yeoman during the Great War.

<text>Marius von Mayenburg (born 21 February 1972 in Munich) is a German playwright and dramaturg.

==Education==
In 1994, Mayenburg began his studies at the Hochschule der Künste in Berlin. His first play, &quot;Haarmann&quot;, was first performed at Baracke (Deutsches Theater in Berlin) in 1996. Since 1999 he is dramaturg and writer-in-residence at the Schaubühne am Lehniner Platz in Berlin.

==Career==
&quot;Fireface&quot; (German: &quot;Feuergesicht&quot;), written in 1997, was his breakthrough as a dramatist. The play was performed at Munich Kammerspiele the following year. Then it was played at the Kleist Theater in Frankfurt (Oder) and at the Deutsches Schauspielhaus in Hamburg. The Hamburg performance gained the most attention. His play &quot;Perplex&quot; saw its English-language premiere in April 2014 at the Sydney Theatre Company, Australia and &quot;Martyr&quot; (&quot;Märtyrer&quot;) at the Unicorn Theatre in London in October 2015. In 2016, a film adaptation of &quot;Martyrs&quot; was translated into Russian and filmed in Russia under the title &quot;The Student&quot; and was well received by international critics.

<text>Central Nova () is a federal electoral district in Nova Scotia, Canada that was represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1968 until 1996. In 1996, Antigonish County and part of Guysborough County were placed with Pictou County in a new electoral boundaries configuration to form the electoral district of Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough. A new version of Central Nova was established in 2003 and — in conjunction with the Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough iteration — represented a significant electoral boundaries change with specific reference to Antigonish County. Between 1867 and 1997, Antigonish County was not in a riding that included Pictou County; rather, it comprised either its own electoral district (Antigonish), or part of other districts shared with Eastern Nova Scotia (Antigonish-Guysborough) and Cape Breton Island communities (Cape Breton Highlands Canso, 1968–1997). In 2013, part of Antigonish County was &quot;placed back&quot; with communities in the electoral district of Cape Breton Canso, a riding which had emerged in part from the former Cape Breton Highlands Canso riding in 1996. The current version of Central Nova includes Pictou County, parts of Antigonish and Guysborough Counties (including the Town of Antigonish and the Municipality of the District of St. Mary&#x27;s) and extends into Halifax Regional Municipality.

==Political geography==
In 2008, the riding had the unusual scenario of having Green Party leader Elizabeth May run without any Liberal opposition. Thus, the race was mostly between Conservative candidate Peter MacKay and May. May&#x27;s support was concentrated in the community of Antigonish. Outside this area, she won just a few pockets of support. She was nearly shut out in the New Glasgow metropolitan area, where she won just one poll. MacKay won most of the rest of the riding, and the NDP picked up three polls.

==History==

The district was created in 1966 from Antigonish—Guysborough (with part of Guysborough added to Central Nova, while Antigonish County and a portion of Guysborough were placed with the Cape Breton Highlands Canso riding), Colchester—Hants, and Pictou. In sum, in 1966, Central Nova consisted of Pictou County, southern Colchester County, eastern Halifax County, and western Guysborough County. In 1976, it gained some territory in Halifax County (eastern central portion), and it lost its territory in Colchester County. In 1987, it lost most of Guysborough County except for the most extreme western point, and gained all of central and central western Halifax County. In 1996, it was merged into Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, and Sackville—Eastern Shore.

The electoral district was re-created in 2003: 93.3% of the riding came from Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough riding, and 6.7% came from Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore. In the 2004 election, Conservative Party candidate Peter MacKay, who had represented Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, was returned to the House of Commons from Central Nova. He was re-elected in the 2006 election.

Green Party leader Elizabeth May contested the seat in the 2008 federal election. In a move that startled political observers, Liberal leader Stéphane Dion announced on April 13, 2007, that his party would not contest the seat in order to give May a better chance of winning, a move that marked the first time in decades that the Liberals did not field a full slate of candidates in a general election. In return, the Greens (who also fielded a full slate in the last election) did not contest Dion&#x27;s Montreal riding. After coming in second to Peter MacKay, May announced she would not run in Central Nova in the next federal election.

Its new boundaries, determined during 2012 federal electoral boundaries redistribution, have been legally defined in the 2013 representation order. The new boundaries encompass most of the pre-2012 riding as well as a portion of Nova Scotia represented in the current electoral districts of Cumberland—Colchester—Musquodoboit Valley and Sackville—Eastern Shore. It lost 9% of its previous territory to Cape Breton—Canso, territory that, for decades prior to this, had already been part of Cape Breton Highlands Canso. It came into effect upon the call of the 42nd Canadian federal election, which took place on 19 October 2015.

==History==
In 2005, Hollinger merged the 80-year-old Lerner Newspapers chain into Pioneer Press, Pioneer&#x27;s first real inroads into the city of Chicago. Despite announcements by Publisher Larry Green that Pioneer intended to &quot;grow&quot; the Lerner Papers, over the course of the next six months, Pioneer dumped the venerable Lerner name, shut down most of its editions and laid off most of its employees. Subsequently, the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; ceased production of &quot;Skyline&quot;, the &quot;Booster&quot; and &quot;News-Star&quot;, the remaining members of the Lerner group, eliminated the jobs, and sold the titles to Oak Park-based &quot;Wednesday Journal&quot;. In 2014, the Pioneer Press newspapers were sold to the Chicago Tribune Media Group.

<doc id="681471" wikidata="Q4311286" url="?curid=681471" title="Castle-class patrol vessel">
<text>The Castle class was a class of British offshore patrol vessels of the Royal Navy. Two ships were constructed and after nearly 30 years service were sold to the Bangladesh Navy in 2010. The Bangladesh Navy upgraded these with more armaments including C-704 anti-ship missiles and sensors. These ships are now reclassified as corvettes by the Bangladesh Navy.

==Design==
The Castle class was designed by David K. Brown and was intended as a series of six offshore patrol vessels for the Royal Navy, designed in response to criticism of the previous for insufficient speed, sub-optimal sea-keeping and lack of a flight deck for rescue helicopters.

In the event, only two ships were built, and . Both vessels were built by Hall Russell in Aberdeen, Scotland. These had significant improvements over the Island-class – they were 300 tonnes larger, more stable in heavy seas, faster and fitted with a large flight deck capable of supporting a Sea King helicopter. For brief periods, the ships could accommodate up to 120 troops.

Their primary mission was to serve with the Fishery Protection Squadron, protecting both the fishing fleets and the oil and gas fields of the North Sea. They could also serve as minelayers, and had detergent spraying facilities on board for dispersing oil slicks.

==Operations==
After the Falklands War, one ship was kept long-term in the Falkland Islands as a guard ship. &quot;Leeds Castle&quot; and &quot;Dumbarton Castle&quot; rotated the role on a three-yearly basis, although the ship&#x27;s crew usually did a six-month rotation.

==Replacement==
The Castle class was replaced in the Falklands by a unique vessel based on the , , and both vessels of the class were decommissioned. Originally due to transfer to the Pakistan Maritime Security Agency in 2007, the deal fell through and both ships were sold to the Bangladesh Navy.

<text>Benjamin Creswick, RBSA (1853–1946) was an English sculptor.

==Life==

Benjamin Creswick was born in Sheffield, the son of a spectacle-maker. He started his working life as a knife-grinder, but took up sculpture with the encouragement of John Ruskin. In 1887 he modelled a terracotta frieze showing the processes of knife-grinding for the exterior of Cutlers&#x27; Hall, in Warwick Lane in the City of London. In the same year he made a frieze for Henry Heath&#x27;s shop in Oxford Street, London, showing hat-makers at work.

Creswick worked on various projects with A.H. Mackmurdo, such as the decoration of Pownall Hall in Cheshire, and contributed to the display by Mackmurdo&#x27;s Century Guild at the Inventions Exhibition in 1885, though he did not join the guild until the following year.

He spent some time in Liverpool and Manchester, before moving to Birmingham, where he was Master of Modelling and Modelled Design at the Birmingham School of Art from 1889 to 1918. He exhibited at the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists in 1914, becoming an associate, and subsequently a member, of the RBSA, and eventually its Professor of Sculpture. He was responsible for a number of architectural sculptures, which can still be seen on Birmingham buildings.

He lived at a house called Elmwood, in Jockey Road, Sutton Coldfield, then in Warwickshire.

His biography was co-written by his great-granddaughter, Annie Creswick Dawson.

<doc id="681476" wikidata="Q735273" url="?curid=681476" title="Alfred Carlton Gilbert">
<text>Alfred Carlton Gilbert (February 15, 1884 – January 24, 1961) was an American inventor, athlete, magician, toy maker and businessman. As the founder of A. C. Gilbert Company, Gilbert was known for inventing the Erector Set and American Flyer Trains.

==Early life and education==
Gilbert was educated at the Tualatin Academy and attended Pacific University in nearby Forest Grove, Oregon, where he was a member of the Gamma Sigma Fraternity. He left Pacific after 1902 and transferred to Yale University, financing his education by working as a magician, and earning a degree in medicine. His thesis had the title &quot;The Genito-Urinary Phenomena of Athletes&quot;.

An accomplished athlete, he broke the world record for consecutive chin-ups (39) in 1900 and the distance record for running a long dive in 1902. He invented the pole vault box and set two world records in the pole vault including a record for 12′ 3″ (3.66 meters) at the Spring meet of the Irish American Athletic Club, held at Celtic Park, New York, in 1906. He tied for gold with fellow American Edward Cook at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London for pole vaulting.

==Career==
Choosing not to pursue a medical career, Gilbert founded Mysto Manufacturing, a manufacturer of magic sets, with his friend John Petrie, in 1907. This company later became the A. C. Gilbert Company. Gilbert developed the Erector Set, a construction toy, in 1913 (preceded by the similar Meccano set conceived by Frank Hornby in 1898 which he developed and patented as &quot;Mechanics Made Easy&quot; in 1901). His inspiration was steel construction girders used on the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad. In 1918, with the United States embroiled in World War I and the Council of National Defense considering a ban on toy production, Gilbert argued successfully against it. The press gave him the nickname &quot;The man who saved Christmas.&quot; Gilbert had by then contributed to the war effort by becoming one of the Four Minute Men who gave short lectures to movie audiences, thus encouraging citizens to purchase war bonds.

By 1935, his company had sold more than 30 million of the Erector sets. He also added chemistry sets, microscope sets, and other educational toys to his product line, accumulating more than 150 patents during his 50-year career. In 1938, he acquired the rights to the American Flyer toy train line from W. O. Coleman and moved their production from Chicago to New Haven. At the same time, he adopted a 3/16 scale for this train line while keeping the three-rail O-gauge track then associated with Lionel, a competitor. Following World War II, O-gauge track was abandoned in favor of two-rail S-gauge track. Gilbert was lauded for his adherence to scale realism, making American Flyer trains look more real and less toylike.

Gilbert is credited with originating the concept of providing benefits for his employees, including free medical and legal advice and maternity leave. In 1915 he founded the Toy Manufacturers of America trade association and was its first president.

Frustrated that invention was an important part of American society not taught in schools, in 1941, Gilbert opened the Gilbert Hall of Science in New York City a science and technology museum. It served the dual purpose of promoting interest in science and selling Gilbert&#x27;s products.

In 1950–1951 he marketed the Gilbert U-238 Atomic Energy Laboratory, which contained radioactive ore samples of autunite, carnotite, torbernite and uraninite.

==Personal life==
In 1908, he married Mary Thompson, whom he had met at Pacific University. They had three children: two girls and a boy. In the 1930s, they lived in a property in Hamden, Connecticut called Maraldene which included kennels where Gilbert bred German Shepherds including one which won the Max von Stephanitz award. He also owned a nearby 600-acre estate that he called &quot;Paradise&quot;. He used it for hunting and it housed his big-game trophies. It was a venue for him to entertain clients and guests attending the Yale Bowl.

==Later years==
Upon his retirement in 1954, Gilbert turned his company over to his son. The same year, he published his autobiography, titled &quot;The Man Who Lives in Paradise.&quot; After his death in 1961, the family sold its remaining shares in the A. C. Gilbert Company to Jack Wrather. It went out of business in 1967, although the Erector trademark continued to be used.

==Legacy==
A museum in Gilbert&#x27;s birthplace of Salem, Oregon, A. C. Gilbert&#x27;s Discovery Village, is named in his honor. The museum comprises several historic structures, including the house of Gilbert&#x27;s uncle Andrew T. Gilbert. It opened in 1989.

The television movie &quot;The Man Who Saved Christmas&quot; is a dramatization of Christmas during the years 1917 and 1918 when America was involved in World War I. He was portrayed by Jason Alexander. The film takes several historical liberties. It debuted December 15, 2002.

Pacific University in Forest Grove, Oregon, has a residential hall named after him that was opened in 2009.

<doc id="681480" wikidata="Q1617091" url="?curid=681480" title="Woodsetts">
<text>Woodsetts is a village and civil parish in the Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham in South Yorkshire, England, on the border with Nottinghamshire. It lies between the towns of Dinnington and Worksop at an elevation of around 60 metres above sea level, and has a population of 1,746 at the 2011 Census. The village originated as a medieval farming hamlet of the manor of Anston, nestled amongst the ancient woodland of which a few patches remain. The village grew rapidly in the late 19th century when a colliery was sunk at Dinnington. The village now serves as a commuter base for travellers between nearby towns.

==History==
Woodsetts originated as a medieval hamlet, one of a cluster of hamlets in the area. The name &#x27;Woodsetts&#x27; comes from the middle-English word &#x27;Wodesete&#x27;, meaning a fold in the woods. The first written record of Woodsetts is in a 13th-century quitclaim (dated 1220) held at the Derbyshire Record Office (Hatfield de Rodes papers) where a bovate of land &#x27;in the territory of Lyndrick, in Wudsetes&#x27; is mentioned. Other geographical locations mentioned nearby confirm that it is Woodsetts being referred to. The placement of the village is likely due to the source of water in the streams to the North of the village, arable farming land, and the proximity to the historic monasteries of Roche Abbey and Worksop Priory. The nearest established castles were at Laughton-en-le-Morthen, Worksop, and Tickhill. 

Woodsetts appeared in a number of medieval and tudor records. In 1771 the first map of the village was drawn, showing a cluster of buildings around Lindrick Road. At the turn of the 19th century, the population of Woodsetts was a little over 100. Originally, inhabitants attended the 12th century St John&#x27;s Church at Throapham; to accommodate the growing population of the village a new church was constructed costing £1,100 (£115,470 in 2024). This church, St George&#x27;s Church (Church of England) consists of a modest nave to which an apse was later added, a porch, and a south facing extension; it sits in the Province of York, and the Diocese of Sheffield. The village also has a smaller brick-built Methodist church which was constructed in 1896. The Butchers Arms is the only public house in the village, built in the 19th century and extended in the 20th century.

Most of the buildings in the village are 20th century built. Some are from the 19th century, and a few date from the 18th century or earlier. Historic England lists three buildings in the village which are of national historical value and significance.

==Facilities==
There is a small shopping precinct in the village, which includes a post office. The new village hall was built in 2007, it sits in the centre of the village off the recreational ground, which includes football pitches, a cricket pitch and green, cricket pavilion, and small skate park. There is also an artificial games pitch, and a children&#x27;s play area. The village has its own scouts group in the Rotherham district.

There is one Junior and Infants School in the village. There are two secondary schools within a 4-mile radius, Dinnington High School and Outwood Academy Valley. There is 6th form provision at Dinnington High School, North Notts College, and Worksop College (independent). The nearest Universities are those of Sheffield.

Public transport consists of bus routes operated by stagecoach. The nearest railway station is at Shireoaks.

==Nearby==
To the north of Woodsetts is the smaller satellite settlement of Gildingwells. Historic places within an 8-mile radius are Roche Abbey (12th century Abbey), Tickhill Castle (12th century Castle), Worksop Priory (13th century Church), and All Saints Church, Steetley (Norman Church). The Tropical Butterfly House Conservation Park is also just outside the village.

The City of Sheffield is the closest major city. The village is about a 10-minute drive from the M1 Motorway.

==Fracking applications==

Rotherham Borough Council twice refused planning permission for exploration at Woodsetts with regard to shale gas hydraulic fracturing (fracking) in 2018, in March and September. A further public enquiry is to be held in June 2019.

<doc id="681481" wikidata="Q245956" url="?curid=681481" title="Immirzi parameter">
<text>The Immirzi parameter (also known as the Barbero–Immirzi parameter) is a numerical coefficient appearing in loop quantum gravity (LQG), a nonperturbative theory of quantum gravity. The Immirzi parameter measures the size of the quantum of area in Planck units. As a result, its value is currently fixed by matching the semiclassical black hole entropy, as calculated by Stephen Hawking, and the counting of microstates in loop quantum gravity.

==The reality conditions==
The Immirzi parameter arises in the process of expressing a Lorentz connection with noncompact group SO(3,1) in terms of a complex connection with values in a compact group of rotations, either SO(3) or its double cover SU(2). Although named after Giorgio Immirzi, the possibility of including this parameter was first pointed out by Fernando Barbero. The significance of this parameter remained obscure until the spectrum of the area operator in LQG was calculated. It turns out that the area spectrum is proportional to the Immirzi parameter.

==Black hole thermodynamics==
In the 1970s Stephen Hawking, motivated by the analogy between the law of increasing area of black hole event horizons and the second law of thermodynamics, performed a semiclassical calculation showing that black holes are in equilibrium with thermal radiation outside them, and that black hole entropy (that is, the entropy of the black hole itself, not the entropy of the radiation in equilibrium with the black hole, which is infinite) equals

:formula_1 (in Planck units)

In 1997, Ashtekar, Baez, Corichi and Krasnov quantized the classical phase space of the exterior of a black hole in vacuum General Relativity. They showed that the geometry of spacetime outside a black hole is described by spin networks, some of whose edges puncture the event horizon, contributing area to it, and that the quantum geometry of the horizon can be described by a U(1) Chern–Simons theory. The appearance of the group U(1) is explained by the fact that two-dimensional geometry is described in terms of the rotation group SO(2), which is isomorphic to U(1). The relationship between area and rotations is explained by Girard&#x27;s theorem relating the area of a spherical triangle to its angular excess.

By counting the number of spin-network states corresponding to an event horizon of area A, the entropy of black holes is seen to be
:formula_2

Here formula_3 is the Immirzi parameter and either

:formula_4

or

:formula_5

depending on the gauge group used in loop quantum gravity. So, by choosing the Immirzi parameter to be equal to formula_6, one recovers the Bekenstein–Hawking formula.

This computation appears independent of the kind of black hole, since the given Immirzi parameter is always the same. However, Krzysztof Meissner and Marcin Domagala with Jerzy Lewandowski have corrected the assumption that only the minimal values of the spin contribute. Their result involves the logarithm of a transcendental number instead of the logarithms of integers mentioned above.

The Immirzi parameter appears in the denominator because the entropy counts the number of edges puncturing the event horizon and the Immirzi parameter is proportional to the area contributed by each puncture.

==Immirzi parameter in spin foam theory==
In late 2006, independent from the definition of isolated horizon theory, Ansari reported that in loop quantum gravity the eigenvalues of the area operator are symmetric by the ladder symmetry. Corresponding to each eigenvalue there are a finite number of degenerate states. One application could be if the classical null character of a horizon is disregarded in the quantum sector, in the lack of energy condition and presence of gravitational propagation the Immirzi parameter tunes to:

:formula_7

by the use of Olaf Dreyer&#x27;s conjecture for identifying the evaporation of minimal area cell with the corresponding area of the highly damping quanta. This proposes a kinematical picture for defining a quantum horizon via spin foam models, however the dynamics of such a model has not yet been studied.

== Scale-invariant theory ==
For scale-invariant dilatonic theories of gravity with standard model-type matter couplings, Charles Wang and co-workers show that their loop quantization lead to a conformal class of Ashtekar–Barbero connection variables using the Immirzi parameter as a conformal gauge parameter without a preferred value. Accordingly, a different choice of the value for the Immirzi parameter for such a theory merely singles out a conformal frame without changing the physical descriptions.

==Interpretation==

The parameter may be viewed as a renormalization of Newton&#x27;s constant. Various speculative proposals to explain this parameter have been suggested: for example, an argument due to Olaf Dreyer based on quasinormal modes.

Another more recent interpretation is that it is the measure of the value of parity violation in quantum gravity, analogous to the theta parameter of QCD, and its positive real value is necessary for the Kodama state of loop quantum gravity. As of today (2004), no alternative calculation of this constant exists. If a second match with experiment or theory (for example, the value of Newton&#x27;s force at long distance) were found requiring a different value of the Immirzi parameter, it would constitute evidence that loop quantum gravity cannot reproduce the physics of general relativity at long distances. On the other hand, the Immirzi parameter seems to be the only free parameter of vacuum LQG, and once it is fixed by matching one calculation to an &quot;experimental&quot; result, it could in principle be used to predict other experimental results. Unfortunately, no such alternative calculations have been made so far.

<doc id="681485" wikidata="Q7361227" url="?curid=681485" title="Rolling Thunder (organization)">
<text>Rolling Thunder is a United States advocacy group that seeks to bring full accountability for prisoners of war (POWs) and missing in action (MIA) service members of all U.S. wars. The group&#x27;s first demonstration was in 1988. It was incorporated in 1995, and has more than 90 chapters throughout the US, as well as overseas.

Their main annual event occurs on the Sunday before Memorial Day, in Columbus Ohio at the National Veteran&#x27;s Memorial and Museum. Columbus is the new home for Rolling Thunder (Ohio/Midwest) beginning in 2020. Previously the event took place in Washington DC in which members make a slow motorcycle ride, called the &quot;First Amendment Demonstration Run&quot; or &quot;Ride for Freedom,&quot; on a dedicated, closed-off, pre-set route through Washington D.C., leaving the Pentagon parking lot at noon, crossing the Memorial Bridge, and ending at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial (&quot;the Wall&quot;). During the Rolling Thunder weekend, members and supporters spend time at the Thunder Alley (the official vendor site for the event), visit significant areas of Washington D.C., particularly the numerous memorials, and hear speeches given by members, supporters, military officials and politicians. In 2019 it was announced that the ride for that year would be the final time. On Sept. 19, National POW-MIA Recognition Day, AMVETS announced it will replace the demonstration ride in Washington with an event to be called &quot;Rolling to Remember,&quot; on the same day and place with the same mission Rolling Thunder had used, adding suicide prevention as an additional issue.

==History==

In 1987 Rolling Thunder made its first ride to the Vietnam War Memorial.

Ray Manzo, a former United States Marine Corps Corporal, U.S. Army Sergeant Major John Holland (Ret.), Marine First Sergeant Walt Sides (Ret.) and Sergeant Ted Sampley (Ret.) are the four men that are credited with starting Rolling Thunder before its incorporation in 1995.

In 1987, Manzo visited the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., talked with fellow veterans, and first learned that American servicemen had been abandoned in Southeast Asia at the end of the Vietnam War. This was counter to his Marine Corps training to leave no man behind, and he became consumed with the idea that he must do something to bring attention to this issue. Manzo attended a POW/MIA vigil sponsored by the Vietnam Veterans Motorcycle Club when the idea came to him to host a motorcycle rally in the nation&#x27;s capital to show the country and the world that U.S. prisoners of war and missing in action (POW/MIA) still mattered to their fellow servicemen and the country for which they sacrificed their freedom.

Manzo drafted a letter for a call to action and began mailing it to motorcycling publications. He enlisted fellow veterans from the Washington D.C. area to help him through the red tape of requirements. Sgt. Major John Holland was experienced in government legislation and included 1st Sgt. Walt Sides, and Washington activist Sgt. Ted Sampley also joined them. These were the founders of Rolling Thunder. Ted Sampley&#x27;s colleague, Bob Schmitt, coined the phrase &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot;. While staring at the Memorial Bridge and envisioning Manzo&#x27;s dream, he said, &quot;It will be like the sound of rolling thunder coming across the bridge.&quot;

On Memorial Day 1988, Cpl. Manzo recruited 2,500 men and women to attend Rolling Thunder I.

===Rolling Thunder Run to the Wall===
The First Amendment Demonstration Run, formerly Rolling Thunder Run to the Wall, was a motorcycle rally sponsored by the Rolling Thunder organization. The ride began on Sunday at the Pentagon after a &quot;blessing of the bikes&quot; at the National Cathedral on Friday and associated events end on Monday.

Beginning in 1987 and continuing through 2019, Rolling Thunder conducted the Run to the Wall on the Sunday of Memorial Day Weekend to show their continued support for the efforts to find lost service men and women of past conflicts. In May 2001 the estimated number of motorcycles involved in this rally was 200,000. The event drew an estimated 350,000 motorcyclists in May 2008, and 500,000 in 2018. The rally was canceled in 2019.

==Chapters==
Rolling Thunder has 88 chapters covering 29 states all of which are governed by the same constitution and bylaws. Many of Rolling Thunder&#x27;s members are veterans and own motorcycles; however, neither is a requirement for membership. All Members of this organization must be willing to help fight the prisoner of war missing in action issue, which still exists. To help protect future veterans from becoming POW-MIA&#x27;s and to help veterans in need from all wars.

Rolling Thunder also allows for the formation of new chapters worldwide. All chapters of Rolling Thunder have their own president and board members and are accountable for fund raising proceeds and tax information. New chapters must have a minimum of 20 members including the president and board members.

==Charities==
Rolling Thunder has expanded its operations to include Rolling Thunder Charities as of 2007, a class 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. This part of the organization adheres to the same laws that govern its parent corporation. Rolling Thunder Charities was designed to help members as well as U.S. Military troops and their families that are in need of financial help. Rolling Thunder Charities sells Rolling Thunder memorabilia and conducts other fundraising activities.

==Legislation==
Rolling Thunder was influential in the passing of the Missing Service Personnel Act of 1993. The bill states that a service member cannot be listed as killed in action (KIA) without substantial evidence. In 1995 Rolling Thunder Inc. won approval from the United States Government for a POW/MIA postage stamp to be put in circulation and the organization continues to work with the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives on new bills for the return of, and information about, servicemen and women. Rolling Thunder co-authored the 2006 Respect for America&#x27;s Fallen Heroes Act.

==Criticism==
&quot;The Economist&quot; said the organization &quot;was founded...to advance a specific crackpot belief: that successive Republican and Democratic administrations have concealed evidence that American captives are being held alive in South-East Asia.&quot;

The river has been popular as a trout stream since the early 19th century, when it became one of the first resort destinations in the United States. The subsequent depletion of the brook trout population by the 1850s led to an early conservation movement to preserve the river, including the introduction of hatcheries for brown trout. Its popularity as a trout stream arises in part from the many cold springs and deep pools in the upper river that keep the water at an even cold temperature. The fly fishing industry is centered on Roscoe, home to several fly-shops and bed and breakfasts catering to fishermen from around the world. More local fly fishing history and information can be found at the Catskill Fly Fishing Center and Museum located in Livingston Manor.

==Course==

The Beaver Kill rises in western Ulster County, beginning at an elevation of just south of the col between Graham and Doubletop mountains, two of the Catskill High Peaks in the Town of Hardenburgh. It descends gently from here, first on private land belonging to the descendants of Jay Gould, then into the Big Indian-Beaverkill Range Wilderness Area, part of the Forest Preserve in the Catskill Park. Shortly after entering state land, it receives its first tributary, an unnamed stream that flows down steeply from the southeast slopes of Doubletop.

At its first crossing, the Neversink-Hardenburgh Trail, the stream turns west and enters a different state-owned parcel, the Balsam Lake Mountain Wild Forest, paralleling the trail for two miles (3 km) to the Quaker Clearing trailhead at the end of Beaverkill Road. Here it turns southwest again and parallels the road through the minimally developed valley, widening slightly as it does, and receiving from the north tributaries such as Alder Creek. It gradually moves to a more westerly direction until just short of the Delaware County line it turns southwest again and parallels it just past the small hamlet of Lew Beach where it enters Sullivan County.

Here it keeps the same course. The covered Beaverkill Bridge crosses it at the Beaverkill State Campground, a popular fishing spot. After briefly bending into Delaware County it reaches the only significant settlement along its length, the hamlet of Roscoe, where its largest tributary, Willowemoc Creek, joins it from the east at the Junction Pool, the Beaver Kill&#x27;s best-known fishing hole. The confluence also marks the point where the Beaver Kill becomes part of the Blue Line, the boundary of the Catskill Park.

It also starts to parallel another road, the NY 17 expressway slowly being converted into Interstate 86. Widening and turning westward again, it soon enters Delaware County and the Town of Colchester for good, passing the small hamlet of Cooks Falls shortly afterwards. The river and the highway remain close, intersecting several times. At the Hancock town line, the Blue Line leaves the river.

For its last few miles, it bends northward slightly, staying alongside Route 17. At the hamlet of East Branch, it drains into the East Branch, approximately northeast of where it joins the West Branch to form the Delaware&#x27;s main stem.

==History==

The combination of its remoteness and contentious disputes over land titles in the Catskills stemming from the Hardenburgh Patent kept the Beaver Kill area unsettled and undeveloped well into the 19th century. Only loggers and trappers visited the area, on a road built in 1815. They told others of the river&#x27;s clear waters and ample supply of trout, which Washington Irving wrote of in 1819, noting that its isolation kept it out of easy reach of city dwellers attracted to the new sport of angling.

Later in the century the valley&#x27;s first significant industry adversely affected the water quality the trout depended on. Tanneries opened up, harvesting tannin from the bark of the extensive Eastern Hemlock stands on the mountain slopes. There were eventually eight in the valley, their effluents clouding the river and making it less attractive to trout. Charcoal makers also released acids into the river, further affecting its quality. The industries were prosperous enough to sustain the settlements of Beaverkill, where the oldest extant bridge over the river was constructed in 1865, and Shin Creek (today Lew Beach).

Those industries faded away due to changes in technology and depletion of forest resources in the 1880s. That same decade, New York created the Forest Preserve, by which state landholdings in the Adirondacks and Catskills were to be kept forever wild. This shift to conservation helped the region sustain a new tourism economy, as rail connections, and later the automobile, brought dry-fly fishermen to the valley. Many of the new sport&#x27;s early publicizers, like Theodore Gordon, wrote about the trout of the Beaver Kill, particularly the Junction Pool, rich in fish because the trout could not decide which river to swim up, and the waters from there down to the East Branch.

The new attention caused different problems. Overfishing led conservationists and private clubs to buy large sections of the river&#x27;s banks all the way up to almost its headwaters. The state built Beaverkill campground in the 1920s, one of its first in the Catskill Park, to concentrate angler impact in one area.

In the years after World War II, the river faced the prospect of being dammed by New York City for its water supply, along with the Willowemoc. The fly-fishing community opposed this strongly, and eventually when test borings showed that the bedrock in those valleys could not support the necessary dams, the city relented. It chose to acquire land along both branches of the Delaware and build Cannonsville and Pepacton reservoirs instead.

Anglers later protested the construction of the Quickway, the expressway section of Route 17, along the river. Their efforts resulted in some slight rerouting, and a section near Cooks Falls where the two roadways were stacked on each other in a narrow passage between state Forest Preserve land and the river. It does not appear to have had, by itself, the adverse impact on runoff and stream flows that was originally feared, although both have increased since the highway&#x27;s construction.

<doc id="681493" wikidata="Q1296766" url="?curid=681493" title="Shuar">
<text>The Shuar, also known as Jivaro, are an indigenous ethnic group that inhabits the Ecuadorian and Peruvian Amazonia. They are famous for their hunting skills and their tradition of head shrinking, known as Tzantsa.

The Shuar language belongs to the Jivaroan linguistic family and is spoken by over 50,000 people in the region. The Shuar are known for their skill in warfare, both in defending their territories and in offensive actions against external enemies. Currently, many Shuar live in communities organized around agriculture and hunting, although there are also some who work in mining and the timber industry.

==Name==
Shuar, in the Shuar language, means &quot;people&quot;. The people who speak the Shuar language live in tropical rainforest between the upper mountains of the Andes, and in the tropical rainforests and savannas of the Amazonian lowlands, in Ecuador. Shuar live in various places — thus, the &quot;muraiya&quot; (hill) Shuar are people who live in the foothills of the Andes; the &quot;achu&quot; (swamp-palm) Shuar (or Achuar) are people who live in the wetter lowlands east of the Andes (Ecuador).

Shuar refer to Spanish-speakers as &quot;apach&quot;, and to non-Spanish and non-Shuar speakers as &quot;inkis&quot;. Europeans and European Americans used to refer to Shuar as &quot;&quot;jívaros&quot; or &quot;jíbaros&quot;&quot;; this word probably derives from the 16th century Spanish spelling of &quot;shuar&quot; (see Gnerre 1973), but has taken other meanings including &quot;savage&quot;; outside of Ecuador, &quot;jibaro&quot; has come to mean &quot;rustic&quot;, and in Puerto Rico to describe a self-sufficient farmer. The Shuar are popularly depicted in a wide variety of travelogue and adventure literature because of Western fascination with their former practice of shrinking human heads (&quot;tsantsa&quot;).

== Social organization and contacts with Europeans ==

From the time of first contact with Europeans in the 16th century, to the formation of the Shuar Federation in the 1950s and 1960s, Shuar were semi-nomadic and lived in separate households dispersed in the rainforest, linked by the loosest of kin and political ties, and lacking corporate kin-groups or centralized or institutionalized political leadership.

The center of Shuar life was a relatively autonomous household consisting of a husband, his wives (usually two), unmarried sons, and daughters. Upon marriage sons would leave their natal household, and sons-in-law would move in (see matrilocal residence). Men hunted and wove clothes; women gardened. In 1527, the Shuar defeated an incursion by the Inca armies of Huayna Capac.

When Shuar first made contact with Spaniards in the 16th century, they entered into peaceful trade relations. They violently resisted taxation, and drove Spaniards away in 1599.

Colonization and missionization in the 20th century have led Shuar to reorganize themselves into nucleated settlements called &quot;centros&quot;. Centros initially facilitated evangelization by Catholic missionaries but also became a means to defend Shuar land claims against those of non-indigenous settlers. In 1964 representatives of Shuar centros formed a political Federation to represent their interests to the Ecuadorian state, non-governmental organizations, and transnational corporations.

== &quot;Tsantsa&quot;, the shrunken heads ==

In the 19th century &quot;muraiya Shuar&quot; became famous among Europeans and Euro-Americans for their elaborate process of shrinking the heads of slain Achuar. Although non-Shuar characterized these shrunken heads (&quot;tsantsa&quot;) as trophies of warfare, Shuar insisted that they were not interested in the heads themselves and did not value them as trophies. Instead, they sought the &quot;muisak&quot;, or soul of the victim, which was contained in and by the shrunken head. Shuar men believed that control of the &quot;muisak&quot; would enable them to pass the soul&#x27;s power to their wives&#x27; and daughters&#x27; which would aid them in their labor.

Since women cultivated manioc and made &quot;chicha&quot; (manioc beer), which together provided the bulk of calories and carbohydrates in the Shuar diet, women&#x27;s labor was crucial to Shuar biological and social life. In the late 19th century and early 20th century Europeans and Euro-Americans began trading manufactured goods, including shotguns, asking in return for shrunken heads. The result was an increase in local warfare, including head hunting, that has contributed to the perception of the Shuar as violent. In 1961 Edmundo Bielawski made the only footage showing what appears to be their head-shrinking process.

== Adulthood rituals ==

Prior to missionization in the 1940s and 1950s Shuar culture functioned to organize and promote a warrior society. Boys of about eight years would be taken by their fathers or uncles on a three- to five-day journey to a nearby waterfall, during which time the boy would drink only tobacco water. At some point the child would be given &quot;maikua&quot; (&quot;Datura arborea&quot;, Solanaceae), in the hope that he would then see momentary visions, or &quot;arútam&quot;. These visions were believed to be produced by a &quot;wakaní&quot; or ancestral spirit.

If the boy was brave enough he could touch the &quot;arútam&quot;, and acquire the &quot;arútam wakaní&quot;. This would make the boy very strong, and possession of several &quot;arútam wakaní&quot; would make the boy invincible. Shuar, however, believed that they could easily lose their &quot;arútam wakaní&quot;, and thus repeated this ritual several times.

A Shuar warrior who had lived to kill many people was called a &quot;kakáram&quot;. Shuar believed that if a person in possession of an &quot;arútam wakaní&quot; died a peaceful death, they would give birth to a new &quot;wakaní&quot;; if someone in possession of an &quot;arútam wakaní&quot; were killed, they would give birth to a &quot;muísak&quot;.

== Illness and shamanism ==

Shuar generally do not believe in natural death, although they recognize that certain epidemics such as measles and scarlet fever are diseases introduced through contact with Europeans or Euro-Americans. They fought primarily with spears and blowguns, but—like many other groups in the region—also believed that they could be killed by &quot;tsentsak&quot;, invisible darts.

Any unexplained death was attributed to such &quot;tsentsak&quot;. Although tsentsak are animate, they do not act on their own. Shamans (in Shuar, &quot;uwishin&quot;) are people who possess and control &quot;tsentsak&quot;. To possess &quot;tsentsak&quot; they must purchase them from other shamans; Shuar believe that the most powerful shamans are Quichua-speakers, who live to the north and east.

To control &quot;tsentsak&quot;, Shuar must ingest &quot;natem&quot; (&quot;Ayahuasca&quot;). Many Shuar believe that illness is caused when someone hires a shaman to shoot &quot;tsentsak&quot; into the body of an enemy. This attack occurs in secret and few if any shamans admit to doing this. If someone takes ill they may go to a shaman for diagnosis and treatment.

They have many plants that they use for common everyday illnesses. Most people know these plants and how to prepare and use them. Occasionally, an older woman will be asked for advice or help especially with fertility control, childbirth and new infants. &quot;Piripiri&quot; (Cyperus species) are used for a variety of ailments.

==Shuar and the Ecuadorian state==
The discovery of oil in the upper Amazon has motivated Ecuadorian and Peruvian interest in the region. In the 20th century Ecuadorian Shuar and Peruvian groups like the Achuar have had significantly different histories.

There are at least 40,000 Shuar, 5,000 &quot;Achuars&quot; and 700 &quot;Shiwiars&quot; in Ecuador.

At the end of the 19th century Catholic Jesuits re-established missions among the Shuar, and poor and landless Euro-Ecuadorians from the highlands (&quot;colonos&quot;) began to settle among Shuar. Shuar entered into peaceful trade relations, exchanged land for manufactured goods, and began sending their children to mission boarding schools to learn Spanish. In 1935 the Ecuadorian government created a Shuar reserve, in part to regulate Euro-Ecuadorian access to land, and gave Salesian (Catholic) missionaries charge over the reserve.

Missionaries were largely successful in the acculturation process, teaching Shuar Spanish, converting Shuar to Christianity, encouraging the Shuar to abandon warfare and the production of shrunken heads, encouraging Shuar to abandon the puberty rites through which Shuar acquired an &quot;arútam wakaní&quot;, and encouraging Shuar to participate in the market economy. They were largely but not completely successful in encouraging Shuar to abandon polygyny for monogamy. They were relatively unsuccessful in discouraging the practice of shamanism.

By the 1950s Shuar had lost a considerable amount of land to settlers. At this time they abandoned their semi-nomadic and dispersed settlement pattern and began to form nucleated settlements of five to thirty families, called &quot;centros&quot; (Spanish for &quot;centers&quot;). These &quot;centros&quot; facilitated missionary access to Shuar. They also provided a basis for Shuar petitions to the Ecuadorian government for land; in return Shuar promised to clear rainforest to convert to pasture, and the government provided loans for Shuar to purchase cattle which they would raise for market.

In the 1960s Salesian missionaries encouraged leaders of the &quot;centros&quot; to meet and form a new organization. In 1964 they formed the &quot;Federación Interprovincial de Centros Shuar-Achuar&quot; (&quot;Interprovincial Federation of Shuar and Achuar Centros&quot;; many &quot;Achuar&quot; live in Ecuador, although most live in Peru). The Federation is democratic and hierarchically organized, most of its leaders are salaried by the Ecuadorian state.

In 1969 the Federation signed an accord with the Ecuadorian government in which the Federation assumed administrative jurisdiction over the Shuar reserve. The Federation assumed the duties of educating children, administering civil registration and land-tenure, and promoting cattle-production and other programs meant to further incorporate Shuar into the market economy. Since that time the Federation has splintered into several groups, including a separate Achuar Federation, although the various groups maintain cordial relations.

Thanks to the work of the Federation, Shuar identity is very strong. Most Shuar also identify strongly to the Ecuadorian nation-state and have entered Ecuadorian electoral politics.

In the last few years, conflict emerged as result of mining projects in the provinces of Morona Santiago and Zamora Chinchipe

On 20 November 2018, Diana Atamaint, a Shuar woman, became the president of the National Electoral Council.

== Jungle Commands Group (Iwias) ==

Many Shuar also serve in the Ecuadorian Army, and the Army has appropriated the perception of Shuar as &quot;fierce warriors&quot;, forming elite &quot;Iwia&quot; units of Shuar soldiers (although all commissioned officers are non-Shuar). These units distinguished themselves in the 1995 Cenepa War between Ecuador and Peru. The name Iwia means &quot;Jungle Demon&quot;; it comes from the Shuar mythology: the Iwia is a feared demon that devours people.

According to its culture, young men become soldiers when they shrink the head of their enemies. The motto of IWIAS is &quot;Never defeated&quot;; this marks his warrior history defeating intruders e.g. Incas led by Huayna Capac. in 1527.

EWIAS (&quot;Escuela de Iwias Crnl. Gonzalo Barragán&quot;) is the entity in charge of training indigenous people from the Amazon region. Located in Shell, Pastaza Province, around 35 Iwia soldiers graduate from this school annually.

==In popular culture==
*In James Rollins&#x27; novel &quot;Amazonia&quot;, Dr. Favre&#x27;s Shuar mistress, Tshui, is described as a &quot;witch&quot; who concocts poisons, brews psychoactive tea, and maintains a large collection of shrunken heads. Her process of shrinking one such trophy, which she wears around her neck, is described in great detail.
*Luis Sepúlveda&#x27;s 1989 novel &quot;The Old Man Who Read Love Stories&quot; explores the Shuar people and their culture/traditions/beliefs as the main character is adopted/befriended by their people. The author was close friends with a Shuar union leader and built aspects of the story around the stories he told him about his way of life.
*In the film &quot;Back from Eternity&quot; (1956) the Shuar (called Jivaros in film) attack the stranded crew in an unnamed South American country.

<doc id="681495" wikidata="Q5339070" url="?curid=681495" title="Edmonton International Fringe Festival">
<text>The Edmonton International Fringe Theatre Festival is an annual arts festival held every August in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Produced by the Fringe Theatre (Fringe Theatre Adventures or FTA), it is the oldest and largest fringe theatre festival in North America (based on ticket sales). The Edmonton Fringe is a founding member of the Canadian Association of Fringe Festivals.

Fringe Theatre is a charitable arts organization, Fringe Theatre brings community together through the power of storytelling. Fringe supports Artists by giving them the tools and platform they need to put on their productions and reach audiences. 

In 2014, 118,280 tickets were sold, up from 117,000 in 2013. The 2014 event had over 210 shows and 1,600 performances, with an estimated outdoor site attendance of 665,750. In 2016, the attendance rate reached a record-breaking high of 850,000+ attendees. In 2017 there was a record-breaking 130,000 tickets sold and $1.2 million in box office sales during the festival, which held performances from over 1,500 artists in 220 shows.

In 2023, 114,632 tickets were sold. The 2023 event had 161 indoor theatre shows and over 1,400 performances with an estimated outdoor site attendance of ~550,000 and $1.2 million in ticket sales directly into the pockets of Fringe Artists. 

==History==
In 1982, Chinook Theatre&#x27;s artistic director Brian Paisley received $50,000 from Edmonton&#x27;s Summerfest to put together &quot;A Fringe Theatre Event&quot; in Edmonton&#x27;s Old Strathcona District. Inspired by the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, Scotland, the Edmonton Fringe (the first in North America) offered 200 live performances in five theatre venues.

The 2020 Edmonton International Fringe Festival (scheduled for August 13 to 23, 2020) was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the only time the festival has been cancelled since its inception.

2021 marked the 40th anniversary of the Edmonton International Fringe Theatre Festival and also the return of the Festival in a scaled-down capacity in order to meet the arts community where they were at amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Venues==
The festival itself largely takes place in Old Strathcona which has a number of permanent theatres (including the Westbury Theatre, the Backstage Theatre, and Studio Theatre in the Fringe Theatre Arts Barns, the Walterdale Playhouse, the Varscona Theatre, the Roxy on 124th, and the Princess Theatre) and a number of other venues which are converted by FTA or independent artists into temporary theatre venues. During the festival, the streets and alleys of the neighbourhood are also filled with street performers and masked or costumed actors promoting their plays.

Unlike the Edinburgh Festivals, where artists are responsible for finding and running their own venues, the Edmonton Fringe implements a system in which for an application fee, the festival provides some artists with a venue, a set number of performances, two technicians, and front-of-house and ticketing services and general festival marketing. In recent years, there have been more performances than venues available directly through the Edmonton Fringe, so a random lottery selection is used to choose which performances will be held in those venues. Artists (particularly those whose performances are not selected in the random lottery) may also arrange for their own performance space independently as a &quot;Bring Your Own Venue&quot; or BYOV, similar to the Edinburgh Fringe model. These venues may be found throughout Edmonton, with one concentration of such venues near the Faculté Saint-Jean in an area known as &quot;The French Quarter&quot;.

==Performers==

Admittance for performers to the festival is determined by application to a lottery held each November. The emphasis is on theatre, but performances can and do feature almost every form of art and entertainment. In addition to the hundreds of national and international artists who travel from around the world to bring their shows to the Edmonton Fringe, there are also hundreds of local performers who participate each year. Many of the local performers have been with the festival since the early years. Performers such as Ken Brown, local magician Ron Pearson, Rapid Fire Theatre, Die-Nasty, Jan Randall Teatro la Quindicina, Darrin Hagen and Kevin Hendricks of Guys in Disguise, Panties Productions, Mump and Smoot, The Wombats, Ribbit Productions, The Dan Show, Nikolai, Ryan Stock of Insane Entertainment, Three Dead Trolls in a Baggie and Tim Waterson have appeared at the festival regularly. 

== Support for Queer Artists ==
For Edmonton queer theatre artists, Fringe is a chance to tell stories they want to tell and to share them with audiences that are willing and interested to listen. It is a place where queer people can feel comfortable and free to be themselves.

<text>Háifoss () is a waterfall situated near the volcano Hekla in southern Iceland. The waterfall Granni is next to it. The river &quot;Fossá&quot;, a tributary of Þjórsá, drops here from a height of 122 m. This is the fourth highest waterfall of the island, after Morsárfoss, Glymur and Hengifoss.

From the historical farm Þjóðveldisbærinn Stöng, which was destroyed by a volcanic eruption of Hekla in the Middle Ages and reconstructed, it is possible to hike to the waterfall along the Fossá (5 to 6 hours both directions). Above the waterfall, there is also a parking lot, to allow hiking to be done in the other direction.

<doc id="681499" wikidata="Q5327909" url="?curid=681499" title="East Branch Delaware River">
<text>The East Branch Delaware River is one of two branches that form the Delaware River. It is approximately 75 mi (121 km) long, and flows through the U.S. state of New York. It winds through a mountainous area on the southwestern edge of Catskill Park in the Catskill Mountains for most of its course, before joining the West Branch along the northeast border of Pennsylvania with New York. Much of it is paralleled by State Route 30.

The river was impounded just north of Downsville in the mid-20th century to create Pepacton Reservoir, part of the New York City water supply system supplying drinking water to the City. It is a popular destination for fly fishing for brown trout.

In 1881 John Burroughs, a native of the area, published &quot;A Summer Voyage&quot;, recounting a solo boat trip down the East Branch from Arkville to Hancock.

There are many variant names for the river that include: Papaconck, Papakonk River, Papotunk River, Pepachton River, Pepacton Branch, Popacton River, Popaxtunk Branch.

==Course==
The East Branch Delaware River rises in eastern Delaware County, from a small pond next to a gas station on Route 30 just below the divide with the Hudson River watershed southwest of the hamlet of Grand Gorge and flows initially SSW, through the town of Roxbury. Its upper course winds through a narrow valley containing the river and Route 30. Just past the Middletown town line, the river flows through Wawaka Lake and then receives Dry Brook, whose tributaries drain the town of Halcott, the only part of Greene County in the Delaware&#x27;s watershed, from the east just outside Arkville. This confluence also puts the Catskill Park Blue Line in the middle of the channel.

Route 30 remains parallel as the East Branch returns to the southwest, flowing through the small village of Margaretville, the first significant settlement along the river, where NY 28 joins Route 30. The two roads remain alongside for the next few miles as the East Branch widens into Pepacton Reservoir. A short distance from the north end of the reservoir, Route 28 leaves Route 30 at the hamlet of Dunraven cleared to make room for the reservoir.

Pepacton Reservoir continues, with the Blue Line along its north shore, carrying the river through the towns of Andes and Colchester as its course moves more to the west. Route 30 crosses it midway along its length. The Downsville Dam just north of the village of that name marks the reservoir&#x27;s southern end. Below the dam and its spillway the river narrows again, to where routes 30 and 206 cross just outside the village.

It continues winding through a wider valley alongside Route 30 to East Branch, where the East Branch&#x27;s most significant tributary, the Beaver Kill, a world-renowned trout stream that rises in western Ulster County, flows in from the east. Here Route 30 ends at the Route 17 expressway, slowly being converted into Interstate 86, parallels the river, crossing back and forth. At the Hancock town line, the Blue Line turns to follow it south, taking the East Branch out of the Catskill Park. A few miles below that, at the village of Hancock, it turns south and joins the West Branch to create the Delaware&#x27;s main stem.

<text>Joel Lawrence Benjamin (born March 11, 1964) is an American chess player who holds the FIDE title of Grandmaster (GM). In 1998, he was voted &quot;Grandmaster of the Year&quot; by the U.S. Chess Federation.

==Life and career==
Benjamin is a native of Brooklyn, New York City, and grew up in the Marine Park neighborhood, where he attended PS 222. He was in the class for &quot;intellectually gifted children&quot;. He is now a New Jersey resident, married to Deborah, and they have two children, Aidan and Amy.

He graduated from Yale University with a major in history in 1985. He became the youngest-ever U.S. chess master at age 13, a record previously held by Bobby Fischer. This record was broken by Stuart Rachels and is now held by Samuel Sevian. As a junior, he won the National Elementary championship (1976), the National Junior High championship (1978), and the National High School championship (1980–81).

Other successes included the U.S. Junior Championship in 1980. In the same year he earned the International Master title. He won the U.S. Junior Championship again in 1982, and the U.S. Open Chess Championship in 1985. He earned the Grandmaster title in 1986. Benjamin was the U.S. Chess Champion in 1987 (sharing the title with Nick de Firmian), in 1997, and in 2000. He won the Saint John Open I in 1988, and the 2000 Canadian Open Chess Championship. In 1999, he placed first at the QVB Chess Festival in Sydney. He was inducted into the World Chess Hall of Fame in Miami on May 2, 2008. He is the youngest inductee.

Benjamin is known for playing offbeat openings such as the Black Knights&#x27; Tango, and for converting very small advantages into a win.

Benjamin tied for first place in the 1986 and 1987 U.S. Masters Chess Championships.

He co-authored &quot;Unorthodox Openings&quot; along with Eric Schiller, for Batsford publishers in 1987, is a frequent contributor to &quot;Chess Life&quot; magazine and other chess periodicals, and is a regular commentator on the Internet Chess Club, usually presenting its &quot;Game of the Week&quot; webcast. He was also the editor-in-chief and founder of the now defunct magazine &quot;Chess Chow&quot; from 1991 to 1994. His book &quot;American Grandmaster: Four Decades of Chess Adventures&quot; was a biographical work about his chess career. His latest book is &quot;Chessboard Combat: The Give and Take of Chess Tactics.&quot; He is also a frequent contributor to Chess Life Online articles on the USCF website.

Benjamin was hired as the official grandmaster consultant by IBM to help with the Deep Blue chess computer that defeated World Champion Garry Kasparov in 1997.

Benjamin appeared in the movies &quot;Searching for Bobby Fischer&quot; and &quot;Game Over: Kasparov and the Machine&quot;. He coaches the Columbia Grammar &amp; Preparatory School chess team.

==Notable games==
Benjamin beat grandmaster Eduard Gufeld in the U.S. Open, Hawaii 1998:
Benjamin vs. Gufeld 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Qxd4 a6 5.c4 Nf6 6.Nc3 Nc6 7.Qd2 e6 8.Be2 Be7 9.0-0 0-0 10.b3 Qa5 11.Bb2 Rd8 12.Rfd1 b5 13.cxb5 axb5 14.a3 Bb7 15.b4 Qb6 16.Qe1 Ba6 17.Qf1 Rab8 18.Rac1 d5 19.exd5 exd5 20.Na4 bxa4 21.Bxa6 Ne4 22.Bd3 Bd6 23.Rc2 Bf4 24.g3 Bh6 25.Re2 f5 26.Qh3 Rf8 27.Bb1 Rbe8 28.Ba2 Ne7 29.Ne5 Qb5 30.Rxe4 fxe4 31.Qe6+ Kh8 32.Qxh6 Nf5 33.Ng6+ Kg8 34.Rxd5 

In January 2025, Benjamin played an 8-game match on Lichess receiving knight odds against the neural net chess engine Leela Chess Zero with a specially trained network for playing at this handicap. Benjamin won the match, scoring two wins, one loss, and five draws. Grandmaster Matthew Sadler contributed live commentary on Youtube as the match progressed.

<doc id="681509" wikidata="Q4216703" url="?curid=681509" title="Wortley, Leeds">
<text>Wortley ( ) is an inner city area of Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. It begins one mile to the west of the city centre. The appropriate City of Leeds ward is called Farnley and Wortley.

It was known as &quot;Wirkelay&quot; until about 1700. Wortley was a weaving township within the parish of Leeds before it became industrial with coal pits, brickworks, railway yards and engine sheds—including a roundhouse, on Wellington Road. This listed building, originally constructed to house a dozen or so steam locomotives, is now the premises of a major commercial vehicle hire company. In the 1880s, Wortley became incorporated into the expanding (then) town of Leeds.

Wortley is divided into three areas: New Wortley, Upper Wortley and Lower Wortley.

== New Wortley ==
New Wortley is the area closest to Leeds city centre, Armley and Holbeck and close to HM Prison Leeds. It is largely made up of 1960s high-rise flats and maisonettes.

== Upper Wortley ==
Upper Wortley is situated between Armley and Lower Wortley; specifically between the boundaries of Tong Road to the north and Oldfield Lane/ Green Hill Lane to the south. It consists of a variety of Victorian terraces, 1950s semi-detached houses and modern low-rise flats and houses.

== Lower Wortley ==
Lower Wortley is furthest from the city centre, closer to Gildersome, Farnley and the Greenbelt. The area sits between the boundaries of Oldfield Lane to the north and Gelderd Road to the South. Housing in Lower Wortley is predominantly 1950s semi-detached with some modern low-rise flats and newly built houses.

Lower Wortley is home to Booker (formerly Makro) and Matalan as well as many car dealerships. These are popular in this area of the city due to Lower Wortley&#x27;s convenient location close to the Leeds Outer Ring Road and the M621 motorway. 

==History==
Wortley grew, much like surrounding areas during the Industrial Revolution. While Wortley was home to some smaller industrial works, its proximity to the industrial centres of Armley and Holbeck encouraged gradual growth. Perhaps Wortley&#x27;s most notable features at this time were the vast array of railway junctions and its two gasworks, a smaller one in Lower Wortley and Leeds&#x27; largest gasworks in New Wortley which, until early 2022, was marked by the presence of a large spiral guided gasholder.

Armley was formerly a township in the parish of Leeds and a chapelry, in 1866 Wortley became a separate civil parish, on 26 March 1904 the parish was abolished to form Armley and Bramley. In 1901 the parish had a population of 27,456.

The landscape of Wortley changed considerably following World War II, when both the Leeds Corporation and private developers redeveloped the Victorian slum areas which had characterised Wortley since it developed. New Wortley was largely developed through the building of social housing, mainly in the form of high rise flats and prefabricated houses. Despite being built opposite what was then a gas works and is now a storage facility, the prefabricated houses were built with &#x27;all-electric&#x27; heating, as was common at the time. In 2009, as part of a fuel poverty scheme the homes were connected to gas.

Lower Wortley and Upper Wortley saw less development than New Wortley with many of their larger Victorian through terracing still remaining and the redevelopment largely being undertaken by private developers who favoured low rise developments using more traditional methods of construction.

Between 1851 and 1852 the bones of the Armley Hippo, a great northern hippopotamus now extinct in the United Kingdom, was found in the ancient former southern channel of the River Aire, in an area previously part of Wortley, where the Armley Gyratory now stands.

==Amenities==
Wortley is largely a residential area, with a fairly high population density. Although it is close to Leeds City Centre and Armley Town Street, there are still many parades of smaller local shops and there is an ASDA supermarket in Upper Wortley. There are about 12 pubs, and although there are no restaurants there are numerous take-away establishments.
There are three main parks: Wortley Recreation Ground, Cliffe Park and Western Flatts Park

Wortley Recreation Ground is closest to the City Centre, and offers surprisingly good views of surrounding areas, including the City Centre. Often also referred to as New Worley Recreation Ground, it includes a children&#x27;s playground, a skateboard park, three bowling greens and a number of pitches are marked out for football and rugby. The bowling greens and club building were a major filming location for the four-part Yorkshire Television comedy drama the Beiderbecke Connection, broadcast in 1988. Other brief scenes were filmed in the locality, including on Colmore Grove and Highfield Avenue.

Cliffe Park and Western Flatts Park form one large park, though they were once the grounds of separate mansions – Cliffe House and Western Flatts House. The latter was demolished a long time ago, but in the 1930s the former was handed over to the then Leeds Education Committee and turned into a residential school for &#x27;difficult&#x27; boys, though now it has been lying derelict for many years.

Lower Wortley Methodist Church on Branch Road was built in 1884 as a United Methodist Free Church. It acts as a distribution centre for the Leeds North and West Foodbank.

==Education==
Wortley has one high school, Dixons Unity Academy, based at the former West Leeds High School site. Close by, in Old Farnley, is The Farnley Academy, and further west, in Pudsey, is Crawshaw Academy. The former Wortley High School (which merged with West Leeds High) is awaiting redevelopment, while the listed former West Leeds Boys&#x27; High School building was converted into apartments. There are three primary schools: Five Lanes, Lower Wortley, and Whingate primary schools.

== Landmarks ==
Since the demolition of the New Wortley gas holder, perhaps the most prominent structures in Wortley are the Clyde Grange and Clyde Court multistorey flats, situated off Tong Road, which are the tallest buildings in the Wortley area.
==Notable people==
Brighton &amp; Hove Albion footballer James Milner was born in Wortley.

England and Manchester City footballer, Kalvin Phillips was born in Wortley

Phil May English caricaturist (22 April 1864 – 5 August 1903) was born in Wortley.

The area has associations with three first world war Victoria Cross recipients. George Sanders was born in New Wortley in 1894, while the grave of Arthur Poulter is located in New Wortley cemetery and the grave of Wilfred Edwards is in Oldfield Lane cemetery.

<doc id="681510" wikidata="Q1928669" url="?curid=681510" title="Michael J. Moynihan">
<text>Michael Jenkins Moynihan (born 17 January 1969) is an American writer, editor, translator, journalist, artist, and musician. He is best known for co-writing &quot;Lords of Chaos&quot;, a book about black metal.
Moynihan is founder of the music group Blood Axis, the music label Storm Records and publishing company Dominion Press. Moynihan has interviewed numerous musical figures and has published several books, translations, and essays. He also supported and promoted the creation of James Mason&#x27;s neo-Nazi book &quot;Siege&quot;, writing the book&#x27;s introduction and helping Mason promote his work. Often linked to the far-right, Moynihan&#x27;s politics have shifted through the decades, but remained controversial throughout his career.

==Biography==
Moynihan was born in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1969, the only son of upper-middle-class parents. He became active in underground tape-trading and fanzine culture as a teenager. He began making experimental music from 1984 with the multi-media project Coup de Grâce, forming Blood Axis in 1989 and releasing his first album under that name in 1995.

Moynihan collaborated with noise musician Boyd Rice from 1989, and in 1990 the two moved into an apartment in Denver.

During the summer of 1991, Moynihan was visited at his apartment by agents of the United States Secret Service about an alleged plot to assassinate then-President of the United States George H. W. Bush. Moynihan agreed to a polygraph test, and no charges were filed. Moynihan stated that it was a simple case of intimidation stemming from his correspondence with Charles Manson, whom he was interviewing for a national magazine.

In 1995, Moynihan released the first full-length album by Blood Axis, &quot;The Gospel of Inhumanity&quot;, and moved from Denver to Portland, Oregon, where he became an editor at Feral House, a publishing company owned by Adam Parfrey. After studying language and history at the University of Colorado and Portland State University, Moynihan received his B.A. in German language in 2000. He received his Ph.D. in 2017 from the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

==Books and articles==
Moynihan&#x27;s first publication was an art fanzine called &quot;The Final Incision,&quot; which he published under the name Coup de Grâce in 1984. It featured contributions from various artists associated with the underground Industrial music scene, including &quot;MB&quot; (Maurizio Bianchi) and Trevor Brown. Coup de Grâce also issued various art posters and newsletters between 1985 and 1989. As a graphic artist, Moynihan designed posters for live performances by Coup de Grâce, Sleep Chamber, and Hunting Lodge in the mid-1980s.

Between 1990 and 1995, Moynihan contributed articles, photography, and editorial work to various magazines and journals including the &quot;extreme culture&quot; magazine&quot;The Fifth Path,&quot; an underground music and culture magazine edited by Robert Ward; the &quot;Colorado Music Magazine&quot;, a Denver-based music monthly; and the internationally distributed newsstand music and art interview magazine &quot;Seconds&quot;, edited by Steven Blush and George Petros. During this time, Moynihan also published journalistic work in &quot;High Society&quot;. 

Among the artists and figures Moynihan has interviewed are power electronics founder Whitehouse; Unleashed; Bathory; In the Nursery; Church of Satan founder Anton LaVey; convicted murderer Charles Manson; Peter Steele of Type O Negative; Burzum; George Eric Hawthorne of RAHOWA; Misfits founder Glenn Danzig; Throbbing Gristle and Psychic TV founder Genesis P-Orridge; and Swans founder Michael Gira.

Moynihan started a publishing house called Storm Books. In 1992, Moynihan edited a collection of writings by the neo-Nazi and Charles Manson idolater James Mason into a book entitled &quot;Siege: The Collected Writings of James Mason&quot;. Together with Stephen Flowers, Moynihan co-authored &quot;The Secret King&quot; (2001, rev. ed. 2007). In 2001, Moynihan edited a reprint of Julius Evola and the UR Group&#x27;s book &quot;Introduction to Magic&quot;, originally published in 1929, and in 2002, he edited the first English language translation of Evola&#x27;s 1953 book &quot;Men Among the Ruins&quot; (both published by Inner Traditions). In 2004, Moynihan edited with Annabel Lee the first English publication of a treatise by erotic and surrealist artist Hans Bellmer titled &quot;Little Anatomy of the Physical Unconscious, or The Anatomy of the Image&quot;. The book, which was issued in a limited edition of 1,100 numbered copies, is translated by Jon Graham and includes a preface by the artist Joe Coleman. In 2005, Moynihan edited and published a collection of essays by British writer John Michell (selected from Michell&#x27;s contributions to &quot;The Oldie&quot;) entitled &quot;Confessions of a Radical Traditionalist&quot;.

Moynihan was the co-editor of the journal &quot;TYR: Myth – Culture – Tradition&quot;.

===&quot;Lords of Chaos&quot;===
Moynihan co-authored with Norwegian journalist Didrik Søderlind the book &quot;Lords of Chaos: The Bloody Rise of the Satanic Metal Underground&quot; (Feral House, 1998), an account of the early Norwegian black metal scene. It won a 1998 Firecracker Alternative Book Award. In 2018 a full-length dramatic film based on the book and bearing the same title, &quot;Lords of Chaos&quot;, directed by Jonas Åkerlund and starring Rory Culkin, Emory Cohen, and Sky Ferreira, was released.

Reviews of &quot;Lords of Chaos&quot; were mixed. The publication was sometimes criticized for a perceived lack of distance towards its subject matter. This was considered especially alarming to groups and figures that had accused Moynihan of right-wing sympathies, charges which Moynihan has dismissed as inapplicable due to the &quot;intricacies of such subjects&quot;. However, several critics praised the book for offering an informative or at least interesting view on a relatively obscure subculture.

===&quot;Tyr&quot;===
&quot;Tyr: Myth—Culture—Tradition&quot; is a journal edited by Moynihan together with Joshua Buckley. The publication is named after Tyr, the Germanic god. The editors state that it &quot;celebrates the traditional myths, culture, and social institutions of pre-Christian, pre-modern Europe.&quot; The first issue was published in 2002 under the ULTRA imprint in Atlanta, Georgia.

The editorial preface of &quot;Tyr&quot;, vol. 1 defines an anti-modern, anti-capitalist ideal of &quot;Radical Traditionalism&quot; encompassing:
#Resacralization of the world versus materialism.
#Natural social hierarchy versus an artificial hierarchy based on wealth.
#The tribal community versus the nation-state.
#Stewardship of the earth versus the &quot;maximization of resources.&quot;
#A harmonious relationship between men and women versus the &quot;war between the sexes.&quot;
#Handicraft and artisanship versus industrial mass-production.

=== His involvement with &quot;Siege&quot; by James Mason ===
In 1992, Moynihan promoted the creation of &quot;Siege&quot;, an anthology of Neo-Nazi writings produced by James Mason. Moynihan wrote the introduction to the book, in which he stated that: The SIEGE volume you hold in your hands is intended both as a guide and a tool. For the observer, or the curious, it serves as a guide through the netherworld of extremist political thought... this book offers a unique and direct access-point to understanding the philosophy, tactics, and propaganda of an increasingly militant and uncompromising brand of National Socialism. ... Secondly, and more importantly, this book is meant to serve as a practical tool. A majority of readers will hopefully not be mere sociologists or researchers, but rather that small faction of people who may be already predisposed towards these ideas. This certainly does not only refer to National Socialists, but revolutionaries and fanatics of all stripes.His involvement in the book&#x27;s success continued into its promotion. During this promotion, Moynihan participated in an interview in &quot;No Longer a Fanzine&quot; #5, conducted by Joseph A. Gervasi. In this interview, Moynihan spoke to his perspective on The Holocaust. In this interview, he states that he has &quot;mix feelings&quot; on the number of Jews killed in the genocide, positing that the claim that 6 million Jews died is &quot;just arbitrary&quot; and &quot;probably a gross exaggeration.&quot; Moynihan would later shift away from National Socialist and fascist politics while still maintaining a distrust for the ruling class.

==Music==
Influenced by first-wave industrial music artists such as SPK and Throbbing Gristle, Moynihan started his first electronic music project in 1984, which he called &quot;Coup de Grâce&quot;. Along with audio cassette releases and live performances, Coup de Grâce also produced art booklets, posters, postcards, and texts. In 1988, at the age of 18, Moynihan published an edition of Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;The Antichrist&quot; featuring artwork by Trevor Brown.

According to Moynihan, a cassette from his project Coup de Grâce was received by an art group called Club Moral in Belgium, resulting in a positive review in the cultural magazine they produced called &quot;Force Mental&quot;. Club Moral invited Moynihan to come to perform at In Vitro, an art and music festival in Antwerp. He accepted, which resulted in a small European tour of Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands, while he was based in Antwerp, Belgium. In Germany, he came in contact with Cthulhu Records, the German underground label which would later release the first Blood Axis compilation tracks and album. Upon returning to Boston in the United States, he was invited to join the experimental music group Sleep Chamber.

While Moynihan was a member of Sleep Chamber, a friend of his who was active in the underground electronic music scene, Thomas Thorn, moved from Wisconsin to Boston and joined the band. According to Moynihan, a falling out occurred between Thorn and John Zewizz, founder of Sleep Chamber, resulting in Moynihan leaving Sleep Chamber and moving to Belgium, where he lived in the same warehouse where Club Moral had their home and offices.

Thorn, who had formed an electronic music project called Slave State in Wisconsin, visited Moynihan in Belgium in 1988 and the two collaborate for a live concert of Thorn&#x27;s project. The show was produced by Club Moral and took place in a cellar underneath their headquarters in Antwerp. After relocating back to the US in 1989, Moynihan formed the musical group Blood Axis and no longer produced music under the name Coup de Grâce.

Experimental musician Boyd Rice invited Moynihan to go to Japan and collaborate with him on three NON performances there in 1989. Moynihan performed in concert with the various musical groups rotating around Tony Wakeford, Douglas P., and Rose McDowall who were also performing. His performance in Japan with NON was later released as the &quot;Live in Osaka&quot; DVD. That year, an album entitled &quot;Music, Martinis, and Misanthropy&quot; grew out of these collaborations. Moynihan also took the cover photo and did the graphic design work for the album, which was loosely based on the 1954 easy listening release by Jackie Gleason, Music, Martinis and Memories.

In 1995, Cthulhu Records released the first full-length album by Blood Axis, &quot;The Gospel of Inhumanity&quot;, and has seen several subsequent re-issues on various labels. It was followed by a second Blood Axis album in 1997 entitled &quot;&quot; for the Swedish post-industrial music label Cold Meat Industry. In 2010, Blood Axis released a second studio album titled &quot;Born Again.&quot; Blood Axis was noted for using a speech by the British fascist Oswald Mosley and lyrics by the Nazi occultist Karl Maria Wiligut in music.

In 2001, Moynihan released a musical collaboration with French artist Les Joyaux de la Princesse entitled &quot;&quot; themed around absinthe, a beverage Moynihan has expressed fondness for, and collaborated with Portland natives B&#x27;eirth of In Gowan Ring, his partner Annabel Lee and Markus Wolff of Waldteufel for a project dubbed &quot;Witch-Hunt&quot;. Largely playing traditional acoustic Irish folk music, the group played various local shows in Portland and also, in 2001, performed in Portugal, where the album &quot;Witch-Hunt: The Rites of Samhain&quot; was released. In 2008, Moynihan appeared on the album &quot;Hoodwinked&quot; by The Lindbergh Baby and an Italian language book entitled &quot;Day of Blood&quot; was published focusing on the musical group.

==Political views==
In the 1990s, Moynihan was frequently characterized as a fascist or neo-fascist by some critics and fans. Moynihan accepted these descriptions with reservations, but in the 2000s dismissed them as inapplicable buzzwords used by &quot;anti-this and anti-that activist types&quot; and denounced the far-right.

Matthias Gardell writes in his 2003 book &quot;Gods of the Blood&quot;: &quot;Featured in different contexts, Moynihan projects many different faces and has been classified as an &#x27;extreme rightist&#x27;, an &#x27;extreme leftist&#x27;, a Nazi, a fascist, and an anarchist&quot;. Gardell wrote that Moynihan was a priest in the Church of Satan but &quot;rarely flashes his membership card&quot; and instead &quot;has long found the heathen path more rewarding&quot;.

Investigative journalist Kevin Coogan has linked Moynihan more explicitly with the extreme right but states that Moynihan does not fit into a &quot;conventional definitions of fascism&quot;. Coogan has classified Moynihan as an &quot;extreme rightist&quot;. Coogan states that &quot;Lords of Chaos&quot; &quot;itself, however, is not a &#x27;fascist&#x27; tract in the strict sense&quot; and that &quot;Moynihan [does not] himself fit easily into the more conventional definitions of fascism&quot;.

The album &quot;The Gospel of Inhumanity&quot; (1995) was favorably reviewed by far-right and neo-Nazi publications: the US Nazi skin journal &quot;Resistance&quot; (no. 6, 38) praised it as a &quot;fascist symphony&quot;. The album also brought Moynihan to the attention of the German neo-Nazi scene, a favorable review appearing in &quot;Einheit und Kampf. Das revolutionäre Magazin für Nationalisten&quot; (no. 18, p. 29, Aufruhr-Verlag, Bremen). As a consequence, Moynihan was identified by anti-fascist activists in the late 1990s. Blood Axis performances attracted protesters, on one occasion in 1998, &quot;about 75&quot; San Francisco protesters mobilized by a flyer denouncing Moynihan as &quot;a fascist and a hatemonger&quot; succeeded in preventing his appearance. Moynihan dismissed activists labeling him a Nazi or a fascist as misinformed hysterical alarmism.

In 1999, Moynihan was one of several musicians listed by Southern Poverty Law Center&#x27;s &quot;Intelligence Report&quot; magazine as examples of black metal music being used to recruit white supremacists. The magazine also excerpted an interview with &quot;No Longer a Fanzine&quot;, where Moynihan denied the Holocaust but said that he would &quot;prefer it if it were true&quot;. The SPLC article was criticized by &quot;Decibel Magazine&quot; in 2006 which described it as being misleading and being poorly researched. In the &quot;Decibel&quot; article, Moynihan responded to the SPLC report, saying it was &quot;packed with misinformation and outright errors&quot; and focused &quot;on a few provocative statements selectively culled from interviews done nearly 15 years ago&quot;. Gardell wrote in 2003 that &quot;Though he certainly does not care about the overwhelming majority of mankind, my impression is that Moynihan cares even less about building gas chambers&quot; and &quot;What he presumably does care about is publicity, a craving that has resulted in quite a few oddities that will follow him for some time.&quot;

German social scientist Christian Dornbusch remarks that Moynihan&#x27;s work &quot;evokes a mindset which wants to design a future based on völkisch and fascist respectively national socialist thinkers. It&#x27;s the same goal that the British fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley rants about for minutes in the sample at the beginning of the live album &quot;Blot – Sacrifice in Sweden&quot;: &#x27;... we are fighting for nothing less than the revolution of the spirit of our people ...&#x27;&quot;.

Moynihan has repeatedly denied political ties. In response to the various political accusations leveled against him, Moynihan calls the far-right &quot;a bunch of isolated losers&quot; who are &quot;all deluded&quot;. In response to accusations concerning the influence of his political views on the writing of &quot;Lords of Chaos&quot;, Moynihan made statements denouncing the far-right and white supremacism. The Southern Poverty Law Center later listed Moynihan as an intellectual leader of the far right for statements such as &quot;The number of six million [Jews killed in the Holocaust] is just arbitrary and inaccurate [...] If I were given the opportunity to start up the next Holocaust, I would definitely have more lenient entry requirements than the Nazis.&quot;

The anti-fascist researcher Spencer Sunshine offered this assessment of Moynihan&#x27;s political evolution in 2024:
Moynihan’s politics—or at least his representation of them—went in phases. In the first, roughly from 1989 to 1993, he was explicit about his interest in and desire to promote Masonite National Socialism while embracing Social Darwinism. By 1994, in the second stage, his self-identification moved closer to “fascist.” In the third, after &quot;Lords of Chaos&quot; came out in 1998, he became quite cagey and represented his view as being neither Left nor Right but also specified that they were neither National Socialist nor Social Darwinist. This was quickly followed by a fourth stage. Although still promoting Nazis and collaborators like Wiligut and Evola, Moynihan began expressing his allegiance to what could be called an ethno-separatism (although he did not use the term) based on sub-racial identities, a la de Benoist, and started using the description “radical traditionalist.”

<doc id="681518" wikidata="Q286670" url="?curid=681518" title="Giovanni Paolo Panini">
<text>Giovanni Paolo, also known as Gian Paolo Panini or Pannini (17 June 1691 – 21 October 1765), was an Italian Baroque painter and architect who worked in Rome and is primarily known as one of the &quot;vedutisti&quot; (&quot;view painters&quot;). As a painter, Panini is best known for his vistas of Rome, in which he took a particular interest in the city&#x27;s antiquities. Among his most famous works are his view of the interior of the Pantheon (on behalf of Francesco Algarotti), and his &quot;vedute&quot;—paintings of picture galleries containing views of Rome. Most of his works, especially those of ruins, have a fanciful and unreal embellishment characteristic of &quot;capriccio&quot; themes. In this they resemble the &quot;capricci&quot; of Marco Ricci. Panini also painted portraits, including one of Pope Benedict XIV.

==Biography==
As a young man, Panini trained in his native town of Piacenza, under Giuseppe Natali and Andrea Galluzzi, and with stage designer Francesco Galli-Bibiena. In 1711, he moved to Rome, where he studied drawing with Benedetto Luti.

In 1724 he married Miss Gossert, sister-in-law of Wengkels, director of the French Academy in Rome, with whom he had two sons: Giuseppe Pannini (Rome, 1720-1812), the architect, and Francesco Panini (Rome, 1745 - 1812), the painter, who followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps and manners.

In Rome, Panini earned a name for himself as a decorator of palaces. Some of his works included the Villa Patrizi (1719–1725), the Palazzo de Carolis (1720), and the Seminario Romano (1721–1722). In 1719, Panini was admitted to the &quot;Congregazione dei Virtuosi al Pantheon&quot;. He taught in Rome at the &quot;Accademia di San Luca&quot; and the &quot;Académie de France&quot;, where he is said to have influenced Jean-Honoré Fragonard. In 1754, he served as the prince (director) of the &quot;Accademia di San Luca&quot;.

The Spanish monarchs appreciated his work in such a way that, commissioned by Filippo Juvarra, he sent paintings to decorate the Lacquer Room of the Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso. In addition, King Carlos IV, when he was Prince, bought several of his works that are still preserved in the Prado Museum and in the royal palaces.

Panini died in Rome on 21 October 1765.

==Legacy==

Panini&#x27;s studio included Hubert Robert and his son Francesco Panini. His style influenced other vedutisti, such as his pupils Antonio Joli and Charles-Louis Clérisseau, as well as Canaletto and Bernardo Bellotto, who sought to meet the need of visitors for painted &quot;postcards&quot; depicting the Italian environs. Some British landscape painters, such as Marlow, Skelton and Wright of Derby, also imitated his capricci.

In addition to being a painter and architect, Panini was a professor of perspective and optics at the French Academy of Rome. His masterful use of perspective was later the inspiration for the creation of the &quot;Panini Projection&quot;, which is instrumental in rendering panoramic views. 
Panini&#x27;s works are held in the permanent collections of many museums worldwide, including the Prado Museum, the Louvre, the Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte, the Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza, the Hermitage, the Pushkin Museum, the Staatsgalerie Stuttgart, the Staatliche Museen, the Palazzo del Quirinale, the Toledo Museum of Art, the University of Michigan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Saint Louis Art Museum, the Detroit Institute of Arts, the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, the Getty Center, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, the Walters Art Museum, the Harvard Art Museums, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the Indianapolis Museum of Art.

<doc id="681520" wikidata="Q14951265" url="?curid=681520" title="West Branch Delaware River">
<text>The West Branch Delaware River is one of two branches that form the Delaware River. It is approximately 90 mi (144 km) long, and flows through the U.S. states of New York and Pennsylvania. It winds through a mountainous area of New York in the western Catskill Mountains for most of its course, before joining the East Branch along the northeast border of Pennsylvania with New York. Midway or so it is empounded by the Cannonsville Dam to form the Cannonsville Reservoir, both part of the New York City water supply system for delivering drinking water to the City.

==Course==
It rises in Schoharie County, New York and flows generally southwest, entering Delaware County and flowing past Stamford and Delhi. In southwestern Delaware County it flows in an increasingly winding course through the mountains, generally southwest. At Stilesville it is impounded to form the Cannonsville Reservoir. At Deposit, on the border between Broome and Delaware counties, it turns sharply to the southeast and is paralleled by New York State Route 17. It joins the East Branch at Hancock to form the Delaware. For the lower 6 mi (10 km) it forms part of the boundary between New York and Pennsylvania.

==Hydrology==

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) maintains many stream gauges along the West Branch Delaware River.

The station by the Village of Delhi, in operation since 1937, but making daily measurements since November 1996, is located upstream from the bridge on Route 28, and upstream from the confluence of the Little Delaware River. This station had a maximum discharge of about and a gauge height of from floodmark on January 19, 1996 and a maximum gage height of on August 28, 2011 as Hurricane Irene passed through the area. It had minimum discharge of on September 25, 1964 and a minimum gauge height of on September 16–17, 2016.

The Hobart station, in service since 2000, located upstream from Maple Street in the Hamlet of Hobart. This station had a maximum discharge of about and a gauge height of on August 28, 2011 caused by Hurricane Irene. It had minimum discharge of on November 13, 2001 and November 19, 2001.

The Walton station, in service since 1950, located downstream from West Brook in the Village of Walton. This station had a maximum discharge of about and a gauge height of on June 28, 2006 during the 2006 Mid-Atlantic United States flood. It had minimum discharge of on September 15 and November 22, 1964.

The Hale Eddy station, in service since 1912, located upstream from the confluence of East and West Branches. Since the construction of the Cannonsville Reseevoir this station had a maximum discharge of and a gauge height of on June 28, 2006 during the 2006 Mid-Atlantic United States flood. It had minimum discharge of on October 20, 1963. The maximum discharge, prior to construction of Cannonsville Reservoir in 1963, was on March 22, 1948. Outside the period of record: In the flood of October 10, 1903 this station reached a discharge of roughly 

==Fishing==
The West Branch is tailwater fishery. This means the same cold water releases that keep it cooler in the summer, keep the river a little warmer in the winter and early spring. The upper section can be cleaner than other rivers during periods of heavy runoff. During high water on the Cannonsville Reservoir, many bait fish spill over the dam. These factors all provide and excellent environment for trout to thrive in.

The trout population in this river is naturally reproducing, during the warm months stocked trout from smaller and warmer tributaries will seek sanctuary in its cool water. The West Branch Delaware River was divided into two sections when the Cannonsville Reservoir was formed. Downstream of the Cannonsville Reservoir, there are large numbered wild populations of brown trout and rainbow trout and an occasional brook trout can be caught although none are stocked. Seasonal anadromous runs of american shad with reports of occasional striped bass. This section is considered one of the best fly fishing trout streams in the United States, due to the cold water released from the reservoir.

<doc id="681526" wikidata="Q4811643" url="?curid=681526" title="Astronomical League">
<text>The Astronomical League is an umbrella organization of amateur astronomy societies. Currently their membership consists of over 330 organizations across the United States, along with a number of Members-at-Large, Patrons, and Supporting members. 

The mission of the Astronomical League is to promote the science of astronomy by (1) fostering astronomical education; (2) providing incentives for astronomical observation and research; and (3) assisting communication among amateur astronomical societies.

The Astronomical League provides a number of observing awards to members locating and describing certain specified astronomical objects or events, and produces a periodical publication, &quot;The Reflector&quot;.

== History ==
The beginning of the Astronomical League dates back to 1939 when members of eleven amateur astronomical societies met at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. Similar meetings followed in Pittsburgh, 1940, Washington D.C., 1941, and Detroit, 1946. During this process of formation, the naming of the organization evolved from the Amateur Astronomers League of America to the short-lived Amateur Astronomer&#x27;s League. World War II delayed much of this early progress, but at the 1946 meeting, final plans laid the foundation for a permanent organization constituting a nationwide federation of societies.

The next convention took place in Philadelphia, July 4, 1947, where the federation came into being with the adoption of bylaws was adopted, the election of officers, and the name &quot;Astronomical League&quot; was selected. Shortly thereafter, the organization was incorporated as a non-profit organization. 

In 2003, The Astronomical League achieved the long-sought goal of a permanent, National Office. This provided a central location for communications, file storage, and general operations. At the same time, the Astronomical League hired its first employee, an office manager. The National Office is located at 9201 Ward Parkway, Suite 100, Kansas City, MO 64114. 

== Awards ==
Awards given by the league include the Leslie C. Peltier Award, the Jack Horkheimer Award, and the National Young Astronomer&#x27;s Award.

===Leslie C. Peltier Award===
The Leslie C. Peltier Award is an annual award given by the Astronomical League to an amateur astronomer who has contributed observations of lasting significance. It was created in 1980 and was first awarded in 1981.

The award is named in honor of Leslie Peltier, an amateur astronomer from Delphos, Ohio, who was described by Harlow Shapley as &quot;the world&#x27;s greatest nonprofessional astronomer&quot;.

===National Young Astronomer&#x27;s Award===
The National Young Astronomer Award is an award given by the Astronomical League to students of high-school age who have excelled in astronomical research.

== Observing Programs ==
One of the most important programs of the Astronomical League is its Observing Programs, in which an individual follows a prescribed program and upon completion earns a certificate and often a lapel pin. The Astronomical League approved its first observing program called “Messier Club,” in 1966. The program challenged observers to locate and observe the deep sky objects listed in Charles Messier&#x27;s catalog of objects. Observers of 70 Messier objects receive a certificate, while those observing the complete list of 110 receive a certificate and pin. 

Fourteen years later, a second observing program was added for observing 400 of the objects in the Herschell list. By the year 2000, there were 15 observing programs, some of which had more than one level. In 2014, Mike Benson and Aaron Clevenson, were appointed as National Observing Program Directors supervising the work of each observing program&#x27;s coordinators. In 2015 Cliff Mygatt was appointed as a Director. Mike Benson retired in 2016. By 2018, with 63 observing programs and almost as many program coordinators, others joined the team of National Observing Program Directors: iAl Lamperti and Maynard Pittendreigh. Marie Lott joined this team in 2020. 

The Master Observer Progression Awards began in 2001, with the creation of the Master Observer Award, requiring the completion of five specific observing programs: Messier Observing Program, Binocular Messier Observing Program, Lunar Observing Program, Double Star Observing Program, and the Herschel 400 Observing Program, plus 5 observer-selected Observing Programs. Additional Master level programs were added in 2016. The Master Progression added an Observer Award, which was simpler than the original Master Observer Award, and added more complex and demanding levels of Advanced Observer, Silver, Gold, and Platinum Master Observer levels.

<doc id="681529" wikidata="Q595556" url="?curid=681529" title="Louder Than Love">
<text>Louder Than Love is the second studio album and major-label debut by American rock band Soundgarden. It was released on September 5, 1989, by A&amp;M Records. After touring in support of their debut album, &quot;Ultramega OK&quot; (1988), Soundgarden left SST, signed with A&amp;M and began work on their first album for a major label. The songs on the album featured a metal-leaning grunge sound with some songs featuring unusual or unorthodox time signatures.

Due to the nature of some of the lyrics (particularly &quot;Big Dumb Sex&quot;), a Parental Advisory sticker was placed on the album packaging. &quot;Louder Than Love&quot; would become the band&#x27;s first album to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at No. 108. The band supported the album with tours of North America and Europe. It was the last Soundgarden album to feature the band&#x27;s original bassist, Hiro Yamamoto. It was later reissued on January 25, 2002.

==Recording==
The album&#x27;s recording sessions took place from December 1988 to January 1989 at London Bridge Studios in Seattle, Washington. The band worked with producer Terry Date. The album was mixed by Steve Thompson and Michael Barbiero at both Mediasound, New York, and House of Music, West Orange, New Jersey.

Regarding the sessions, frontman Chris Cornell said, &quot;At the time Hiro [Yamamoto] had excommunicated himself from the band and there wasn&#x27;t a free-flowing system as far as music went, so I ended up writing a lot of it.&quot; Cornell would end up solely writing seven out of the album&#x27;s twelve tracks. Cornell stated that there &quot;was plenty of angst, anger, frustration and hell ... but none of it had anything to do with Terry. He was very supportive&quot;. He said that the sessions as a whole were a &quot;positive experience.&quot; Bassist Hiro Yamamoto left the band once the sessions were over and went back to college, frustrated that he was not contributing much.

Regarding the album&#x27;s production, Cornell said that the band tried to avoid 1980s production techniques. On the album&#x27;s sound as a whole, Cornell stated that the album &quot;was just a few degrees too produced and too clean, although I wouldn&#x27;t want to change any of it&quot;.

==Music and lyrics==
Steve Huey of AllMusic said that Soundgarden took &quot;a step toward the metal mainstream&quot; with &quot;a slow, grinding, detuned mountain of Sabbath/Zeppelin riffs and Chris Cornell wailing&quot;. At the time the band was trying to avoid the &quot;heavy metal&quot; label, with guitarist Kim Thayil stating that the band&#x27;s sound was &quot;as much influenced by British bands like Killing Joke and Bauhaus as it is by heavy metal&quot;. Cornell said that the band&#x27;s sound is &quot;enough for anyone into speed metal, but we&#x27;re heavy rock ... Neo-metal maybe.&quot;

Some songs on the album feature unusual or unorthodox time signatures. &quot;Get on the Snake&quot;, for example, is played in 9/4. &quot;I Awake&quot; uses 4/4, 6/4, 9/8, 11/8, and 14/8. &quot;Gun&quot; features varying tempos, which speed up and slow down over the course of the song. A lot of the songs on the album are tuned down to drop D tuning.

Cornell said that &quot;Hands All Over&quot; is about how humans defile the environment, and that &quot;Full on Kevin&#x27;s Mom&quot; is about &quot;a friend of mine who slept with another friend of mine&#x27;s mom. The guy who did it said to us, &#x27;Yeah, full on Kevin&#x27;s mom&#x27;.&quot; The lyrics of &quot;I Awake&quot; were originally part of a note written by Yamamoto&#x27;s then girlfriend Kate McDonald. In the late 1990s, an urban legend circulated on internet message boards which stated that Yamamoto, after writing the music, wrote some lyrics on the back side of McDonald&#x27;s note. When Yamamoto gave the paper containing these lyrics to Cornell, Cornell looked at the wrong side of the sheet and believed McDonald&#x27;s note was the lyrics to Yamamoto&#x27;s song. There was less material on the album intended as humorous compared with &quot;Ultramega OK&quot;. However, the song &quot;Big Dumb Sex&quot; was written as a parody of glam metal bands, who often metaphorically addressed sexual intercourse in their lyrics. The song, with its many uses of &quot;fuck&quot;, was the reason the album gained a Parental Advisory sticker upon release.

==Release and reception==

Before the official release, a US promo-only picture disc without a picture sleeve or insert was released on July 12, 1989.

Because of some of the song lyrics, most notably on &quot;Hands All Over&quot; (the &quot;kill your mother&quot; line) and &quot;Big Dumb Sex&quot;, the band faced various retail and distribution problems upon the album&#x27;s release. &quot;Louder Than Love&quot; peaked at number 108 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart in 1990. It was the band&#x27;s first album to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200. &quot;Louder Than Love&quot; spawned the &quot;Loudest Love&quot; EP and the &quot;Louder Than Live&quot; home video, both released in 1990.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; staff writer J. D. Considine wrote that &quot;Chris Cornell has the sort of soaring, muscular voice Ian Astbury can only dream of, while guitarist Kim Thayil comes across like The Edge with an attitude&quot;. He stated that &quot;the songs on &quot;Louder Than Love&quot; are mean, lean and fighting fit&quot;, but he criticized Cornell&#x27;s lyrics, observing that &quot;much of what the band has to say is clichéd, confused or generally incomprehensible&quot;. He ended his review by saying that &quot;even when his lyrics are as dumb as rocks ... Cornell delivers them with such full-throated intensity that they actually sound impressive.&quot; AllMusic staff writer Steve Huey stated that &quot;too much of the album drifts along without focus or variety.&quot; Critic Robert Christgau gave the album a negative review, stating that it is &quot;covertly conceptual, arty in spite of itself, and I bet metal fans don&#x27;t bite&quot;. Canadian journalist Martin Popoff considered &quot;Louder Than Love&quot; &quot;a limiting, slightly safe record despite daunting rhythmic explorations, one that plays too close to the vest, too tight and faithful to external perceptions of what the band should be and too damn slow!&quot;

Three singles were released from the album, &quot;Loud Love&quot;, &quot;Hands All Over&quot; and the radio-only &quot;Get on the Snake&quot;, each with accompanying music videos. &quot;Get on the Snake&quot; was featured in the 1989 movie and soundtrack, &quot;Lost Angels&quot;. &quot;Loud Love&quot; was featured in the 1992 film &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot;.

Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammett revealed that he was inspired to write the riff to &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; after listening to &quot;Louder Than Love&quot;.

Guns N&#x27; Roses covered &quot;Big Dumb Sex&quot; on its 1993 album, &quot;&quot;The Spaghetti Incident?&quot;&quot;, as part of a medley with T. Rex&#x27;s &quot;Buick Mackane&quot;.

The cover artwork of the 2020 single &quot;&quot;Deep Set&quot;&quot; by Greg Puciato is an homage to &quot;Louder Than Love&quot;.

In 2001, &quot;Q&quot; named &quot;Louder Than Love&quot; as one of the &quot;50 Heaviest Albums of All Time.&quot; In 2017, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Louder Than Love&quot; as 69th on their list of &#x27;The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time.&#x27;

In 2010, Soundgarden released a music video for the song &quot;Get on the Snake&quot;.

==Packaging and title==
The album&#x27;s cover art, photographed by Charles Peterson, features a black and white picture of Cornell. Cornell called the album cover &quot;the quintessential angry young man&quot;. Regarding the title, Cornell said, &quot;It&#x27;s sort of making fun of heavy metal bravado. Metal bands would say &quot;Louder Than Thunder&quot; or something. So &quot;Louder Than Love&quot;, what is &quot;Louder Than Love&quot;?&quot; Kim Thayil said that the band really wanted to call the album &quot;Louder Than Fuck&quot;.

The album&#x27;s graphic designer, Art Chantry said about the title on the 2009 book &quot;Grunge Is Dead: The Oral History of Seattle Rock Music&quot;:
They didn&#x27;t have a name for the record. We were talking about it and joking – I said, &quot;You should really call this record &#x27;Louder Than Shit.&#x27; They go, &quot;That&#x27;s a great name!&quot; I go, &quot;No... call it &#x27;Louder Than Fuck&#x27;&quot; &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s great!&quot; And [Soundgarden manager] Susan Silver goes, &quot;My band isn&#x27;t putting out a record with &#x27;Fuck&#x27; in the title.&quot; That&#x27;s where &quot;Louder Than Love&quot; came from.

A month before touring for &quot;Louder Than Love&quot; commenced, Yamamoto left to go back to college. Cornell stated, &quot;It seems an odd time to quit. We&#x27;re doing real well. We&#x27;ve got a touring budget now. We don&#x27;t haul amps or do such long van rides any more.&quot; He was replaced by Jason Everman, formerly of Nirvana. The band embarked on a North American tour that went from December 1989 to March 1990. On this tour the band served as the opening act for Voivod on the band&#x27;s &quot;Nothingface&quot; tour, with Faith No More and The Big F also serving as opening acts at the beginning and end of the tour. Cornell&#x27;s roommate, Andrew Wood, the lead singer of Mother Love Bone, died on March 19, 1990, of a heroin overdose, the day Cornell got back from touring in support of &quot;Louder Than Love&quot;.

As Cornell went on to tour Europe with Soundgarden a few days later, he started writing songs in tribute to his late friend. The result was two songs, &quot;Reach Down&quot; and &quot;Say Hello 2 Heaven&quot;, that he recorded as soon as he got back from touring. The two songs would eventually lead into the Temple of the Dog project. Bassist Jason Everman was fired immediately after Soundgarden completed its promotional tour for &quot;Louder Than Love&quot; in mid-1990. Thayil said that &quot;Jason just &quot;didn&#x27;t&quot; work out&quot;, and that the band &quot;didn&#x27;t need to go find someone better than him; we needed to find a kindred spirit that we&#x27;d hang out with anyway&quot;. The band later released the video compilation &quot;Louder Than Live&quot;, which was filmed at the Whisky a Go Go in 1989.

==Track listing==
*Some rare special editions of the album include a bonus disc of the &quot;Loudest Love&quot; EP. Cornell said in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview that the album would be fully complete if the last four tracks of the &quot;Loudest Love&quot; EP were added. Cornell said that he wanted to reissue the album remastered with these four tracks added, for a total of 16 tracks.

==Outtakes==
The album&#x27;s singles featured two B-sides from the &quot;Louder Than Love&quot; recording sessions that weren&#x27;t included on the album, &quot;Fresh Deadly Roses&quot; and &quot;Heretic&quot;. &quot;Fresh Deadly Roses&quot; was a B-side on the &quot;Loud Love&quot; single and was featured on the 1990 &quot;Pave the Earth&quot; compilation. &quot;Heretic&quot; was originally recorded for the 1986 &quot;Deep Six&quot; compilation. However, the song was re-recorded during the &quot;Louder Than Love&quot; recording sessions and this version is featured on the &quot;Hands All Over&quot; single, the &quot;Pump Up the Volume&quot; soundtrack, and the &quot;Loudest Love&quot; EP. A Cameron penned instrumental entitled &quot;Twin Tower&quot; was recorded during the sessions, but not released until it appeared on &quot;Echo of Miles: Scattered Tracks Across the Path&quot;.

<doc id="681531" wikidata="Q3531821" url="?curid=681531" title="Tony Martin (politician)">
<text>Anthony A. Martin (born August 31, 1948) is a Canadian politician. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1990 to 2003, representing the constituency of Sault Ste. Marie for the Ontario New Democratic Party (NDP). He subsequently served in the House of Commons of Canada, representing Sault Ste. Marie from 2004 until 2011.

==Background==
Martin was raised in Wawa, Ontario, and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Laurentian University in 1974. Later in the same year, he received a Diploma in Recreational Leadership from Confederation College. He was the founder of the Sault Ste. Marie Soup Kitchen, and was for some time the owner and General Manager of Transcend Homes, a local workers&#x27; cooperative. A devout Roman Catholic, Martin also served as a trustee on the Northern District Catholic School Board and was a pastoral assistant at the Blessed Sacrament Parish in Sault Ste. Marie from 1981 to 1990.

Martin is married to Anna Celetti. They have four children.

On February 9, 2014, Martin was hospitalized in Sault Ste. Marie after suffering a stroke.

==Provincial politics==
Martin ran for the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1990 after Karl Morin-Strom, the sitting Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for Sault Ste. Marie, announced his retirement. He faced a difficult challenge in retaining the seat for his party. The Ontario Liberal Party ran a strong candidate in Don MacGregor, while the upstart anti-bilingualism Confederation of Regions Party made strong inroads into the riding&#x27;s anglophone/working-class base, which traditionally voted NDP. After a late drive from the city&#x27;s unions, Martin defeated MacGregor by a slim 697-vote margin. Elsewhere in the province, the NDP won several historical breakthroughs and formed government for the first time in its history.

In his first term as an MPP, Martin was appointed as parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Education. He held this position for the next five years. The NDP government, under the leadership of Premier Bob Rae (with significant help from MPPs Shelley Martel of Nickel Belt and Bud Wildman of Algoma), facilitated a unique restructuring at Algoma Steel in Sault Ste. Marie that included majority worker ownership during the early 1990s. This contributed to Martin retaining the riding in the 1995 election with an increased majority, even as the NDP suffered major losses in most parts of the province. Martin defeated Liberal challenger Carmen Provenzano by almost 4,000 votes, and so became one of only seventeen New Democrats to return to the legislature. The Progressive Conservatives under Mike Harris replaced the NDP&#x27;s majority government with one of their own in 1995.

Martin again retained his seat in the 1999 election. He was appointed as one of the legislature&#x27;s Deputy Speakers on October 25, 1999. He dramatically resigned from this position on December 19, 2000, to protest the Mike Harris government&#x27;s inactivity on poverty issues. Following this, he chaired a series of &quot;People&#x27;s Parliament on Poverty&quot; meetings. In 2002–03, Martin supported Bill Blaikie&#x27;s campaign to lead the federal NDP.

Martin was initially expected to be re-elected in the 2003 provincial election, but a late surge in Liberal support saw David Orazietti win the seat by a significant margin.

==Federal politics==
Shortly after his provincial defeat, Martin was nominated as the federal NDP&#x27;s candidate for the general election of 2004.

Sault Ste. Marie&#x27;s vulnerable industrial economy and strong union base and the NDP&#x27;s populist strength in Northern Ontario made the riding a prime target for the party. Martin won by almost 1,000 votes, once again defeating incumbent Liberal Carmen Provenzano, who had taken the seat in the 1997 election. Martin was re-elected in the 2006 campaign, as the NDP increased its representation from 19 seats to 29. Martin won his third term federally in the 2008 snap election as the NDP won 37 seats.

In the NDP&#x27;s shadow cabinets under the leadership of Jack Layton, Martin served as critic for Social Policy, Childcare, Human Resources and Skills Development, and the FedNor agency. Martin lost his seat to challenger Bryan Hayes of the Conservative Party of Canada in the 2011 federal election.

<text>Burroughs is a large crater on Mars at latitude 72.5S / longitude 243.1W, with a diameter of .

The crater is named after Edgar Rice Burroughs, the American science fiction novelist who wrote a series of fantasy novels set on the planet.
An ice deposit in Burroughs Crater contains strong evidence that recent Martian climate is influenced by changes in the planet&#x27;s orbit and axial tilt.

<text>Firbeck is a village and civil parish in the Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham in South Yorkshire, England, on the border with Nottinghamshire. It lies between Maltby and Oldcotes, off the A634 and B6463 roads. Firbeck had a population of 317 in 2001, which had fallen to 299 at the 2011 Census.

==History==
The place name Firbeck is thought to derive from a wood streamlet, or beck of the Frith.

An oval field in the village marks what was once the private racecourse of 18th century racehorse owner Anthony St Leger, who originated the St Leger Stakes. While the first &quot;St. Leger&quot; race was held on Cantley Common in 1776, was not so named until over a year later, and moved to Doncaster Racecourse in 1778, local legend holds that the race was being run in Firbeck prior to this. St Leger lived at Park Hill, an estate to the south of Firbeck, the main house was demolished in 1935, but there are still Grade II listed farm buildings, dating from the 17th century and built of limestone rubble with a roof of pantiles, within the grounds of the estate.

Village amenities include The Black Lion public house, and St Martin&#x27;s Church, which was rebuilt on the site of a previous building in 1820. A north aisle was added in 1844, and in 1887, Henry Gladwyn Jebb commissioned the builders E I Hubbard of Rotherham to enlarge it further. When Jebb died, a tower was added in 1900 in his memory. The building includes two 19th-century wall monuments to the Knight family of Langold, while there is a larger 18th-century monument to other members of the family in the churchyard. Both the tomb and the church building are Grade II listed.

==Firbeck Hall==
Firbeck Hall was built in 1594 by William West, who was steward to Francis Talbot, 5th Earl of Shrewsbury, and to Gilbert Talbot, 7th Earl of Shrewsbury from 1580 to 1594. He was from Rotherham, and had made a fortune as a practising lawyer. West was the author of a legal textbook called &quot;Symbolaeographia&quot;, and stipulated in his will of 1598 that &quot;a grave stone be set for me and my said wife in Firbeck Church, and ingraven with our arms and names and some posy.&quot; In 1676, the hall was purchased by Jonathan Staniforth, son of William Staniforth of Rotherham. The family had been puritans during the English Civil War, and were staunch Nonconformists. Jonathan married four times, first to Dorothy Shaw, secondly to Anne Spateman, thirdly to Mary Disney, daughter of John Disney, and finally to Christian Knight, daughter of Ralph Knight. Upon Jonathan&#x27;s death in 1679, the house was passed down to his son Disney Staniforth. Disney married Mary Skinner and had a son named Jonathan, and three daughters Mary, Henrietta and Amelia. The children were known to be reclusive, never marrying or having offspring. In 1768, the estates of Firbeck and nearby Langold were inherited by Elizabeth Gally (née Knight), whose husband was Rev Dr Henry Gally, Rector of St Giles in the Fields, Camden, and chaplain to King George II. His two sons added the name Knight to their existing names, the eldest, John Gally Knight, living at Langold Hall, and the youngest, a barrister called Henry, residing in Firbeck Hall. Following Henry&#x27;s death in 1808, his widow Selina devoted herself to serving the community, rebuilding Firbeck Church, and establishing schools in Firbeck and the neighbouring village of Letwell. When she died in 1823, the estate passed to her son, another Henry.

Her son was the 19th-century architect and writer Henry Gally Knight who is assumed to have been a principal information source for Walter Scott during the writing of &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;. Knight was the Member of Parliament for North Nottinghamshire from 1814 to 1831, and was also the High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire. He wrote books on European medieval architecture, wrote poetry, and knew the poet Lord Byron. He intended to build a large mansion overlooking Langold Lakes, but having commissioned the plans, changed his mind, and lived at the Hall. He married his wife Henrietta in 1826. The hall was extended and improved, and a notable feature was the steep gables which he added. He died on 9 February 1846, and left the hall in his will to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Seven years later, the commissioners sold the estate, and it was purchased by Frances Harriett Miles (née Jebb). The Rev. Henry Gladwyn Jebb, who was involved in the rebuilding of St Martin&#x27;s church, inherited the building on the death of Mrs Miles, and it passed to his nephew Captain Sydney Gladwyn Jebb in 1898. Sydney Jebb was a wealthy landowner, and a Justice of the peace in the West Riding of Yorkshire, but chose to live in Maidstone, Kent. The house was rented out, after attempts to sell it failed in 1909. Some modernisation was carried out at the beginning of World War I, when several Belgian families were housed there.

===Country Club===
The estate was sold again in 1934 to Cyril Nicholson. Robert Cawkwell of Sheffield was responsible for the interior designs when, in 1935, Nicholson, a Sheffield stockbroker, opened the hall as a country club, investing £80,000 in its art deco renovation. The interior was dramatically modernised and featured a mirror-walled ballroom and an elaborate and versatile state-of-the-art lighting system. There was also a heated outdoor swimming pool, and membership fees ranged from three to seven guineas. Nicholson built an airfield in the grounds, enlisting the help of the pilot Captain Tom Campbell Black, who with C. W. A. Scott had won the air race from Mildenhall to Melbourne in 1935. Black was a well-connected socialite, and it was through him that the then Prince of Wales learned of the club, flying there in his private Dragon aircraft, which bore the royal insignia. The aviator Amy Johnson also patronised the club. Other facilities included an 18-hole golf course, the design of which Nicholson entrusted to the celebrity golfer John S.F. Morrison, championship-standard squash courts, and tennis courts. The swimming pool was built by the Sheffield-based construction company B. Powell and Son. Such was the club&#x27;s reputation, that the BBC transmitted its weekly Saturday show &quot;Late Night Dance Music&quot; with Henry Hall, Carroll Gibbons and Charlie Kunz from Firbeck.

===Second World War onwards===
At the outbreak of the Second World War, the hall was used by Sheffield Royal Infirmary and the Royal Air Force, with the adjacent aerodrome becoming RAF Firbeck. The hall was unsuccessfully offered for sale in 1943, but in 1945 it was bought by the Coal Industry Social Welfare Organisation (CISWO) for use as a convalescent home and rehabilitation centre for injured miners. This centre closed in 1984. It was subsequently used by the Trent Regional Health Authority as a rehabilitation centre for those suffering from industrial injuries, and till about 1990. It was bought by a development company in 1996, Cambs Construction Ltd, but from then the Hall fell into a state of disrepair. In 2009, a group called the Friends of Firbeck Hall was established, to attempt to secure a future for the site. Cambs Construction failed in May 2010, and the liquidators sold the estate to a development company based in Doncaster for £350,000. The company set about restoring the West Lodge, which was completed in early 2014, but there was another change of ownership later that year. The new owners held a consultation event outlining their plans for the building on 1 November 2016 in Firbeck Village Hall. The Friends group are optimistic that this might result in the building and its of surrounding conservation land, which forms a substantial part of the village, being rescued from dereliction.

===The airfield===
Nicholson&#x27;s airfield was used by the Sheffield Aero Club in 1938, who had a collection of de Havilland Tiger Moth and Gypsy Moth biplanes. With the Second World War looming, it became part of Sir Kingsley Wood&#x27;s &quot;Great Flying Scheme&quot; in 1939, which aimed to train volunteer pilots for the Royal Air Force, and in 1940, the whole site was requisitioned by the Air Ministry. It became RAF Firbeck and a base for No. 613 Squadron RAF initially, following their move from Netherthorpe Airfield and was used as a training base. After the war ended, it was decommissioned, with the hangar being dismantled in 1948, and the area was returned to agricultural use. A small area of concrete apron remains, and in 2011, a memorial was unveiled by Wing Commander John E Bates OBE, to honour those who served at the base.

<text>The Taoiseach (plural: &quot;Taoisigh&quot;) is the head of government of Ireland. Prior to the enactment of the Constitution of Ireland in 1937, the head of government was referred to as the President of the Executive Council. This office was first held by W. T. Cosgrave from 1922 to 1932, and then by Éamon de Valera from 1932 to 1937. By convention Taoisigh are numbered to include Cosgrave, for example Micheál Martin is considered the 15th Taoiseach.

<text>Glymur () is a waterfall in Hvalfjarðarsveit, Vesturland, Iceland. It is the second-tallest in the country with a cascade of . Glymur was long regarded as the tallest until being surpassed by Morsárfoss, a newly measured waterfall near Morsárjökull in 2011.

It is situated at the rear end of the Hvalfjörður. Since the opening of the Hvalfjörður Tunnel under this fjord, visitor numbers have dropped.

The river Botnsá runs from the Hvalvatn lake and after a short distance the water falls down alongside the Hvalfell mountain into a steep canyon. The waterfall can be accessed from a parking area at the end of the road. Hikers can view the waterfall from marked paths on the east side of the river Botnsá.

The second picture is an engraving showing people trying to escape from a monster whale. It is an illustration of the Icelandic legend of Redhead (Rauðhöfði ) which is said to be the cause of the formation of Glymur.

<text>The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) monitors meteorological, oceanographic, and solar-terrestrial physics for the United States Department of Defense. The program is managed by the United States Space Force with on-orbit operations provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The (originally classified) mission of the satellites was revealed in March 1973. They provide cloud cover imagery from polar orbits that are Sun-synchronous at nominal altitude of .

== History ==
During the 1960s, one of the most important projects that the United States civil space program was involved in dealt with meteorology and weather forecasting. Unbeknownst to many, the U.S. military services were also starting up a weather satellite program. This program, the DMSP, would relay important weather and climate data to the military for more effective operations. From the onset of the DMSP program, knowledge of its existence was limited to &quot;need-to-know&quot; personnel. The United States Congress had assigned a substantial budget towards the civil weather satellite program; if knowledge of a second military program came out, it would have been hard for the military to justify it.

Initial operations of early DMSP systems provided radio return of cloud-cover imagery for planning of U.S. high-resolution photographic reconnaissance and surveillance missions, which utilized film-return systems. DMSP satellites operated in a Sun-synchronous orbit; passing over the north and south poles, the satellite would see different strips of the Earth at the same local time each day. The DMSP satellites had periods of roughly 101.0 minutes, so they would orbit the Earth 14.3 times in 24 hours. This period combined with the Sun-synchronous orbit would have the satellite pass over the whole surface of the planet twice a day.

The images acquired were relayed to the Earth and received by two command and readout stations established at retired Nike missile sites located near Fairchild Air Force Base in Washington State and Loring Air Force Base in Maine. From these sites, the images were then sent to Air Force Global Weather Central (AFGWC) located at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska. Images would then be processed, forming a mosaic representing the cloud patterns that were observed from the orbiting satellites. Meteorologists could then provide flight crews and other commanders with up-to-date observations for their particular missions. Further advancements enabled data to be collected in the visual spectrum, down to a half-moonlit scene. Infrared processing enabled night viewing. Other enhancements increased on-board processing; this includes multiple on-board computers and expanded power requirements.

Now in its fifth decade of service, the DMSP program has proven itself to be a valuable tool in scheduling and protecting military operations on land, at sea, and in the air. In December 1972, DMSP data was declassified and made available to the civil scientific community. On 1 June 1998, the control and maintenance of the satellites were transferred to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in order to reduce costs.

DMSP was to be replaced by the Defense Weather Satellite System (DWSS) but that was cancelled in 2012. In 2017, the Air Force awarded a contract to build the first of the new defense weather satellites, the Weather System Follow-on Microwave (WSF-M) satellite.

== Losses of satellites ==

=== 2004 explosion ===
In 2004 the USAF weather satellite DMSP Block 5D-2 F-11 (S-12) or DMSP-11, launched in 1991 and retired in 1995, exploded in orbit with debris objects generated. It seems likely the fragmentation was due to either a battery explosion or to residual fuel in the attitude control system. Later, propulsion was identified as the &quot;assessed cause&quot; of DMSP-11 explosion.

=== 2015 explosion and debris field ===
On 3 February 2015, the 13th DMSP satellite — DMSP-F13 launched in 1995 — exploded while in a Sun-synchronous polar orbit leaving a debris field of at least 43 to 100 large fragments and more than 50,000 pieces smaller than 1 millimeter. The Joint Space Operations Center at Vandenberg Space Force Base, Lompoc, California is monitoring the expanding debris field, and &quot;will issue conjunction warnings if necessary&quot;. The cause of the explosion was the rupturing of an onboard battery due to a design flaw (no collision with another object took place).

=== 2016 failure of DMSP 19 without replacement ===
On 11 February 2016, a power failure left both the command-and-control subsystem and its backup without the ability to reach the satellite&#x27;s processor, according to the U.S. Air Force Space Command investigation released in July 2016 that also announced that DMSP 5D-3/F19 was considered to be &#x27;lost&#x27;. The satellite&#x27;s data can still be used, until it ceases pointing the sensors towards the Earth. The satellite was the most recent on-orbit, having been launched on 3 April 2014.

The failure only left F16, F17 and F18 – all significantly past their expected 3–5 year lifespan – operational. F19&#x27;s planned replacement was not carried out because Congress ordered the destruction of the already constructed F20 probe to save money by not having to pay its storage costs. It is unlikely that a new DMSP satellite would be launched before 2023; by then the three remaining satellites should no longer be operational.

=== 2016 explosion ===
In October 2016, the 12th DMSP satellite - DMSP-F12 launched in 1994 - exploded in orbit. The satellite had similar battery as the one that exploded in the DMSP-13 satellite, thus raising suspicions that DMSP-12 explosion was also caused by battery problems. At the time the cause of DMSP-12&#x27;s explosion was however unknown, although a collision with another object did not seem to be the cause. Apparently, very little debris (just one trackable piece) was generated in DMSP-12 explosion. DMSP-12 was decommissioned in 2008.

=== Near collision ===
In January 2017, the Joint Space Operations Center announced that two non-maneuverable satellites would come dangerously close, with a collision probability as high as 44%. DMSP F15 and Meteor 1-26 were considered to be the prime candidates for the encounter. The operations center, which announced the possible collision, didn&#x27;t identify the satellites involved but third party observers determined the most likely candidates. The two did not collide.

=== NOAA 16 and 17 ===
The NOAA-16 and NOAA-17 weather satellites were based on the same technology as DMSP satellites. NOAA-16 broke up in November 2015, and NOAA-17 disintegrated in orbit on 10 March 2021. 

=== 2024 explosion ===
The DMSP 5D-2/F14 (USA-131), launched 4 Apr 1997 and decommissioned in 2020, exploded in orbit in December 2024.

== Launch history ==

DMSP was initially known as Program 35. The first successful launch of a Program 35 spacecraft used a Scout X-2 rocket lifting off from Point Arguello near Vandenberg Space Force Base on 23 August 1962. This was P35-2, the earlier P35-1 launch on 24 May 1962 had failed to reach orbit. All five Program 35 launch attempts using Scout launch vehicle, including the two successes, were made from Vandenberg SLC-5. Other early launches were conducted using Thor-Burner launch vehicles, with Altair or Burner II upper stages. Program 35 had by this time been renamed the Data Acquisition and Processing Program, and the DAPP acronym is sometimes used for these satellites. Eight satellites were launched using Atlas E launch vehicles between 1982 and 1995. Three were launched aboard Titan II vehicles between 1997 and 2003. One has been launched on a Delta IV rocket.

The most recent launch of a DMSP satellite, DMSP-F19, occurred on 3 April 2014, from Vandenberg aboard an Atlas V launch vehicle.

=== Block 1 ===
The DSAP-1 (Defense Satellite Application Program Block 1) satellites series, also known as P-35, was the first series of military meteorological satellites of the United States. The project designation P-698BH was used concurrently with P-35 from June 1962 and P-35 became P-417 in October 1962. The designation DMSP-1 (Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Block 1) was retroactively assigned to these satellites.

===Block 2===
The DSAP-2 (Defense Satellite Application Program Block 2) satellites series consisted of three modified DSAP-1 satellites, retaining the shape and dimension of the earlier series, featuring improved infrared radiometers. The designation DMSP-2 (Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Block 2) was retroactively assigned to these satellites.

===Block 3===
The single DSAP-3 (Defense Satellite Application Program Block 3) was a modified DSAP-2 satellite to provide experimental tactical access to weather data, for which a tactical readout station was built near Saigon. The designation DMSP-3 (Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Block 3) was retroactively assigned to this satellite.

===Block 4A===
===Block 5A===
===Block 5B===
===Block 5C===

===Block 5D===
In 2015, Congress voted to terminate the DMSP program and to scrap the DMSP 5D-3/F20 satellite, ordering the Air Force to move on to a next-generation system. The Air Force had intended to keep DMSP F20 in climate-controlled storage at a Lockheed Martin clean room in Sunnyvale, California, for a time in case it needed to be called up for launch in the coming years, and in the aftermath of the failure of DMSP 5D-3/F19, the USAF was reconsidering the future of DMSP-5D3 F-20. However, in late 2016, the USAF began scrapping DMSP-5D3 F-20.

<text>The Neversink River (also called Neversink Creek in its upper course) is a tributary of the Delaware River in southeastern New York in the United States. The name of the river comes from the corruption of an Algonquian language phrase meaning &quot;mad river.&quot;

The Neversink River is considered by many to be the birthplace of American dry fly fishing.

==Course==
The Neversink&#x27;s main flow begins just south of the border between present-day Ulster and Sullivan counties, where the east and west branches of the river join near the hamlet of Claryville. Both branches begin on the slopes of Slide Mountain, the highest peak in the Catskills. The west branch is joined by several major tributaries, such as Biscuit Brook and Pigeon Creek at Frost Valley YMCA in the town of Denning, Ulster County. In its upper course, it is a rocky and wild stream, ideal for trout fishing. But, most of the land around it is privately owned and not open to fishermen.

It flows generally southwest through the mountains. Not far downriver from the confluence in Neversink, it is impounded to form the Neversink Reservoir of the New York City Water Supply System. It is connected by a water tunnel to Rondout Reservoir, and subsequently to the Delaware Aqueduct. Development of the Neversink Reservoir resulted in the displacement of many locals, as several towns along the river were flooded to make the reservoir. New York City paid for their relocation.

It flows through the town of Fallsburg, the hamlets of Woodbourne, Fallsburg, South Fallsburg, and Old Falls. It enters the town of Thompson near Bridgeville; New York State Route 17/Interstate 86 cross it at Exit 107. The Holiday Mountain Ski Area was developed near the river. Southern Sullivan County has less developed country, and the river passes over its largest waterfalls, Denton Falls and High Falls in the Neversink Gorge. It flows southeastward into western Orange County. Near Cuddebackville, it is joined from the northeast by Basher Kill, then flows southwest. US 209 runs parallel to the river, which joins the Delaware River at Port Jervis. At this confluence with the Delaware, the Tri-States Monument marks the tripoint of the borders of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania; Interstate 84 bridge passes over this point.

==Recreation==
Along much of its length, the Neversink is a popular trout stream, mostly north of Woodbourne. In addition to rainbow trout, it sustains brown trout, brook trout and the rare tiger trout. In the 1890s Theodore Gordon expertly matched dry fishing flies to actual insects. Edward Ringwood Hewitt conducted research on insect and flies from his property above the town of Neversink. Their work led to the river gaining a reputation as birthplace of American dry fly fishing. The river is home to other fish species such as smallmouth bass, carp, sucker, bluegill, American eel, and lampreys; and a diverse range of flora and fauna.

Other forms of recreation are rarely pursued on the river. Several swimming holes are available; however, many are on private property or restricted public property. The relative narrow nature of the river is not hospitable to boating. The river is mostly navigable with small watercraft from near its dam in Hasbrouck to its mouth; however, it is seldom traveled.

==History==
The Delaware &amp; Hudson Canal crossed the river at Cuddebackville by an early aqueduct bridge designed by John Roebling and built in 1851.

In the late 19th century the river was said to have been navigable to Claryville, where a tannery operated. The river provided a transportation waterway for the tannery&#x27;s products as well as smaller steam-propelled vessels.

In heavy rains the Neversink River sometimes floods near its mouth at the Delaware River. This occurred most recently in April 2005, causing some destruction and dislocation in the Port Jervis area. The Myers Grove community near Huguenot was particularly affected. In addition, heavy rains, in combination with an extended period of unusually warm weather after a moderate to heavy winter with a considerable snowpack, can produce devastating floods at the headwaters of the river from January to April. The snowpack melt increases the volume in the river at the same time as rain.

A detailed history of the river can be found in James Eldrige Quinlan&#x27;s &quot;History of Sullivan County&quot;, published in 1873.

<text>Gen Paul (July 2, 1895 – April 30, 1975) was a French painter and engraver.

==Biography==
Born as Eugène Paul in a house in Montmartre on the Rue Lepic painted by Van Gogh, he began drawing and painting as a child. His father died when he was only ten years old and Gen Paul was trained to work in decorative furnishings. He served in the French army during World War I and was wounded twice, losing one of his legs. During his convalescence, he returned to painting, and at Le Bateau-Lavoir he became friends with Juan Gris who helped him a great deal. Although Paul never received any formal training, he made a living from his art for almost 60 years. While his early works reflected the influences of his friends in Montmartre, Vlaminck, Utrillo and Frank Will, he soon developed dynamic form of expressionism reflecting influences as varied as Toulouse-Lautrec, Van Gogh, Cézanne, Goya, Velázquez and El Greco. Between 1925 and 1929, he produced many of his best works. The paintings during this phase are characterized by motion created by gestural brush strokes, daring compositions, forced perspectives, diagonals, zigzags, juxtaposed areas of abstraction and realism and flat areas of color. Unlike other expressionists of the time such as Soutine, Rouault and the German expressionists, Gen Paul&#x27;s works are full of optimism – fueled by his passion for life and daily life and his desire to overcome his handicap. Due to the dynamism and motion inherent in his paintings, some consider Paul to be the first action painter, a precursor to the abstract expressionists of the 1950s.

Paul died at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris on 30 April 1975 and was interred in the Cimetière Saint-Vincent in Montmartre. A great many of his works remain in private hands but a number of his important pieces can be found at museums in France and in other parts of Europe.

===Career===
Paul first exhibited at the Salon d’Automne and the Salon des Indépendants in Paris in 1920. In 1928, his works were exhibited with those of Pablo Picasso and Chaïm Soutine. Paul began the 1930s with a serious addiction to alcohol, further complicating his chronic health problems. The paintings of 1930s reflect a more somber mood with precise lines and carefully chosen colors and an emphasis of rhythm over motion. From the 1940s through his death, Paul reverted to a style of action painting characterized by many of the elements of his work in the 1920s, but his later work never again succeeded in recapturing the innovation, emotion and expressionism of his earlier works.

In 1934, he was recognized for his contributions to France and was awarded the Legion of Honor. In 1937, he was contracted to paint a large fresco for the Pavilion of Wines of France at the Paris International Exposition.

In addition to painting scenes from his native Montmartre, including that of his friends, composer Darius Milhaud, writer Louis Ferdinand Celine, Paul travelled to the United States where he painted jazz and classical musicians, a subject with which he had much interest.

<doc id="681561" wikidata="Q2936541" url="?curid=681561" title="Canso, Nova Scotia">
<text>Canso is a community in Guysborough County, on the north-eastern tip of mainland Nova Scotia, Canada, next to Chedabucto Bay. In January 2012, it ceased to be a separate town and as of July 2012 was amalgamated into the Municipality of the District of Guysborough. The area was settled in 1604, along with the original Port-Royal. The construction of a British fort in the village in 1720 was instrumental in contributing to the outbreak of Dummer&#x27;s War in 1722. The town is of national historic importance because it was one of only two British settlements in Nova Scotia prior to the establishment of Halifax (1749). Canso played a key role in the defeat of Fortress of Louisbourg. Today, the town attracts people internationally for the annual Stan Rogers Folk Festival.

== Geography ==
The community is located on the southern shore of Chedabucto Bay. The southern limit of the bay is at Cape Canso, a headland approximately southeast of the community.

Canso is the southeastern terminus of Trunk 16, an important secondary highway in Antigonish and Guysborough counties.

As the community is situated on the end of a peninsula jutting into the Atlantic Ocean, Canso frequently experiences fog, particularly during the warmer summer months when continental air temperatures collide with cooler ocean temperatures offshore.

=== Canso Islands ===
Canso Harbour is protected by the Canso Islands, a small archipelago lying immediately north and east of the mainland, with Durells Island (named after Philip Durell), Piscataqui Island, George Island, and Grassy Island being the largest.

The islands were designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1925 due to their role as an important fishing base for French in the 16th century and the British during the 18th century, and as the staging point for the 1745 expedition against Louisbourg. &quot;Grassy Island Fort&quot;, the remains of early 18th-century British fortifications (a 1720 redoubt, 1723–24 fort, and a 1745 blockhouse) on Grassy Island, was also individually designated as a National Historic Site in 1962.

== History ==

Since the 16th century, Canso has been a strategically important fishery base. It is said that the harbour of Canso was frequented by European fur traders and fishermen within a dozen years of the arrival of Columbus in America, and an attempt at settlement was made here as early as 1518.

Acadian Governor Isaac de Razilly built a fortified post, Fort Ste. Marie de Grace, in 1632 at La Hève (now LaHave) with Nicholas Le Creux du Breuil as lieutenant. Upon Razilly&#x27;s death in 1635, the new Governor Charles de Menou d&#x27;Aulnay moved the Acadians from La Hève to Port Royal, which had been given up by the Scottish also in 1632.

=== The &quot;Squirrel&quot; Affair ===

Shortly after Cyprian Southack established himself at Shelburne, Nova Scotia in 1715, the Mi&#x27;kmaq raided the station and burned it to the ground. In response, on September 17–24, 1718, Southack led a raid on Canso and Chedabucto (present-day community of Guysborough) in what became known as the &quot;Squirrel&quot; Affair. Leading , Southack laid siege for three days to Fort St. Louis at Chedabucto, which was defended primarily by Acadians. There were approximately 300 Acadians in the area.

Southack imprisoned numerous Acadians onboard &quot;Squirrel&quot; and killed several others. On September 18, British marines landed on Lasconde&#x27;s Grave and captured the entrance to Chedabucto Harbour. The following day &quot;Squirrel&quot; landed more marines at Salmon River who then proceeded to the rear of the village. &quot;Squirrel&quot; made its first attempt to enter the harbour but was beaten back by Acadian cannon fire from the fort. Later in the day the village was captured by the British. On September 20 &quot;Squirrel&quot; made a second, and successful, attempt to enter the harbour. Once in the harbour, she fired upon the fort.

On September 23, Southack&#x27;s men sacked and burned the village. Their haul was loaded onto several French ships that had been captured in the harbor. The following day, September 24, Southack released the Acadian prisoners onto the Canso Islands without any provisions or clothing. Others fled to Isle Madame and Petit-de-Grat, Nova Scotia. He seized two French ships, and encouraged Governor of Nova Scotia Richard Philipps to fortify Canso.

=== Raid on Canso (1720) ===
On August 7, 1720, 60–75 Mi&#x27;kmaq joined French fishermen from Petit de Grat, and attacked the fortification as it was being built. The Mi&#x27;kmaq killed three men, wounded four more and caused significant damage. The New Englanders took 21 prisoners which they transported to Annapolis Royal. The raid on Canso was significant because of the involvement of the Mi&#x27;kmaq and was a chief factor leading up to Father Rale&#x27;s War.

In the Fall of 1720, the New Englanders finished building Fort William Augustus (also known as Fort Phillips after Richard Philipps, the then Governor of Nova Scotia). Construction of such a permanent facility was a violation of long-standing agreements between the Mi&#x27;kmaq and the fishermen, and also helped to precipitate Father Rale&#x27;s War.

In 1721, the governor of Massachusetts took a proprietary attitude toward the Canso fisheries, and sent HMS &quot;Seahorse&quot; to patrol the waters off Nova Scotia. With the arrival of British colonial troops to the region, the Mi&#x27;kmaq were discouraged from attacking until the following year. HMS &quot;Seahorse&quot; was replaced in 1721 by the first naval ship of Nova Scotia, &quot;William Augustus&quot;, under the command of Cyprian Southack.

=== Father Rale&#x27;s War ===

==== Raid on Canso (1722) ====
In the lead up to Father Rale&#x27;s War, in July 1722, the Mi&#x27;kmaq and some Abenakis began a major offensive against New England fishermen and traders in an attempt to blockade the Nova Scotia capital of Annapolis Royal. Natives captured eighteen trading vessels in the Bay of Fundy and an additional eighteen New England fishing schooners between Cape Sable and Canso. As a result, the New England Governor declared war on the Mi&#x27;kmaq which lasted three years.

The ship William Augustus led ships from Canso to protect the fisheries, which resulted in the battle at Jeddore Harbour, Nova Scotia. Only five native bodies were recovered from the battle and the New Englanders decapitated the corpses and set the severed heads on pikes surrounding Canso&#x27;s new fort.

==== Raid on Canso (1723) ====
On July 23, 1723, the village was raided again by the Mi&#x27;kmaq and they killed three men, a woman and a child. In this same year, the New Englanders built a twelve-gun blockhouse to guard the village and fishery.

==== Raid on Canso (1725) ====
In 1725, sixty Abenakis and Mi&#x27;kmaq launch another attack on Canso, destroying two houses and killing six people.

=== King George&#x27;s War ===

==== Raid on Canso (1744) ====
At the outbreak of King George&#x27;s War, the French destroyed the flourishing fishing village during the Raid on Canso (1744).

==== Siege of Louisbourg ====
A year later, the village Canso was used as a staging area for the 1745 siege of Louisbourg. The British built a blockhouse, which they named Fort Prince William (Nova Scotia). General Sir William Pepperell arrived at Canso, Nova Scotia, with four thousand and seventy troops, April 4, 1745, and, in three weeks was joined by Commodore Warren, with four ships from England.

=== Father Le Loutre&#x27;s War ===

==== Raid on Canso (1749) ====
During Father Le Loutre&#x27;s War, in August 1749, Lieutenant Joseph Gorham was at Canso and his party was attacked by Mi&#x27;kmaq. They seized his vessel and took twenty prisoners and carried them off to Louisbourg. Three English and seven Mi&#x27;kmaq were killed. After Governor Edward Cornwallis complained to the Governor of Ile Royale, the prisoners were released.

==== Raid on Canso (1752)====
Another raid happened August 4, 1752.

==== Attack at Canso (1753) ====
On February 21, 1753, 9 Mi&#x27;kmaq in canoes attacked an English vessel which had a crew of four at near-by Country Harbour, Nova Scotia. The Mi&#x27;kmaq killed two English men and took two others captive for six weeks. After seven weeks in captivity, on April 8, the two English men killed six Mi&#x27;kmaq and managed to escape. In response, on the night of April 21 the Mi&#x27;kmaq attacked another English schooner in a naval battle between Outique Island and Isle Madame in which the Mi&#x27;kmaq attacked an English schooner. There were nine English men and one Acadian who was the pilot. The Mi&#x27;kmaq killed the English and let the Acadian off at Port Toulouse, where the Mi&#x27;kmaq sank the schooner after looting it.

=== French and Indian War ===

==== Expulsion of the Acadians ====
During the Expulsion of the Acadians the famous ship the Duke William was in port for almost a month awaiting passage to France (1758). While in port the vessel narrowly escaped a raid by Mi&#x27;kmaq.

=== American Revolution ===

==== Raid on Canso (1775) ====
During the American Revolutionary War, Canso was subject to numerous raids by American privateers. George Washington&#x27;s Marblehead Regiment raided Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island on November 17, 1775 and three days later, they raided Canso Harbor.

==== Raid on Canso (1776) ====
On September 22, 1776, Canso was attacked by American privateer John Paul Jones. The privateer sailed on and destroyed fifteen vessels, and damaged much property on shore. There he recruited men to fill the vacancies created by manning his prizes, burned a British fishing schooner, sank a second, and captured a third besides a shallop which he used as a tender. Jones then sacked the settlements of Petit-de-Grat and Arichat, Nova Scotia on Isle Madame, Nova Scotia and then returned to Boston.

On November 22, John Paul Jones returned to Canso in . Boats from the ship raided the community, his crews burned a transport bound for Canada with provisions and a warehouse full of whale oil, besides capturing a small schooner. Captain Jones then went on to present-day Sydney, Nova Scotia to free Americans imprisoned in local coal mines.

==== Raid on Canso (1779) ====

Again in 1779, American privateers destroyed the Canso fisheries, worth $50,000 a year to England.

In February 1780, the schooner Freemason struck a rock near Canso and sunk. They landed near Whitehead and 16 of the 19 perished in the woods because of the winter weather. The three survivors got to Canso on March 9, having survived by eating their fellow crew members.

=== Recent history ===

In a plebiscite held on July 12, 2008, residents narrowly voted to amalgamate the town with the neighbouring Municipality of the District of Guysborough. The decision to amalgamate was put off, and after review was rejected again in March 2023

On January 19, 2012, the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board granted the town&#x27;s application to dissolve. On July 1, 2012, Canso became part of The Municipality of the District of Guysborough.

In early 2017, Maritime Launch Services announced it intended to lease land near Canso to build and operate Canada&#x27;s only active commercial spaceport, using the Ukrainian Cyclone-4M rocket. Construction is slated to begin in late 2021 and is expected to take three or four years. The first suborbital flight from Canso will be conducted via a small-lift launch vehicle in 2023, while the Cyclone-4M is expected to make its first orbital flight from the facility in 2025.

== Annual events ==
Canso is host to the Stan Rogers Folk Festival, an annual event held around the Canada Day weekend. This event attracts over 10,000 visitors, who enjoy music from all over the world on seven different stages over the 3 days.

Each year, during the second week of August, a regatta is held within the town. This week-long event includes boat races, a mid-way, parade, seaman&#x27;s memorial, hootenannies as well as various activities for the youth. The regatta draws many previous generations of the town to serve the purpose of a Come Home week. Each year, the regatta has a theme which is reflected in the parade, with 2009&#x27;s being The Circus Comes to Town.

== Transportation ==
Nova Scotia Trunk 16, a secondary highway important to the counties of Antigonish and Guysborough, terminates in Canso, its easternmost point.

<text>Ásbyrgi () is a glacial canyon and forest in the north of Iceland, located approximately east of Húsavík on the Diamond Circle road. The horseshoe-shaped depression is part of the Vatnajökull National Park and measures approximately 3.5 km in length and over 1 km wide. For more than half of its length, the canyon is divided through the middle by a distinctive rock formation 25 meters high called &quot;Eyjan&quot; (, &quot;the Island&quot;), from which a vast landscape is seen.

The canyon&#x27;s steep sides are formed by cliffs up to in height. Within the canyon is a woodland of birch and willow. Between 1947 and 1977, a number of foreign tree species were introduced, including spruce, larch and pine. The small lake &quot;Botnstjörn&quot; is home to a variety of waterfowl species.

Ásbyrgi was most likely formed by catastrophic glacial flooding of the river Jökulsá á Fjöllum after the last ice age, first 8–10,000 years ago, and then again some 3,000 years ago. The river has since changed its course and now runs about 2 km to the east.

The legend explains the unusual shape of the canyon differently. Nicknamed &quot;Sleipnir&#x27;s footprint&quot;, it is said that the canyon was formed when Odin&#x27;s eight-legged horse, Sleipnir, touched one of its feet to the ground here.

<text>Carlyle Smith Beals, FRS (June 29, 1899 – July 2, 1979) was a Canadian astronomer.

== Early life and education ==
Carlyle Smith Beals was born in Canso, Nova Scotia to Rev. Francis H. P. Beals and his wife, Annie Florence Nightingale Smith Beals, on June 29, 1899. He is the brother of artist and educator Helen D. Beals.

Beals received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Acadia University in 1919, specializing in physics and mathematics. Although he wished to continue his studies, he was forced to postpone those plans due to poor health. He taught at a small country school in Nova Scotia during the winter of 1920.

He began his Ph.D. studies in physics at Yale University in 1921, but was forced to return home in the winter of 1921 when his health failed again. He resumed his graduate studies in 1922 at University of Toronto and received a master&#x27;s degree in Physics in 1923. His master&#x27;s thesis work on triboluminescence spectra, the frequencies of light generated by breaking chemical bonds, was done under the supervision of John Cunningham McLennan, one of the leading physicists in Canada at the time.

Beals spent one year as the Science Master at the High School of Quebec in Quebec City, before enrolling in a graduate programme in physics in 1924 at the Royal College of Science at Imperial College London. Working under Alfred Fowler, he studied the Zeeman effect and the spectra of palladium, copper, and ionized silver. During this time Beals became acquainted with observational astronomy by using the small observatory in the Royal College of Science building. He received a Ph.D. in 1926.

== Career ==
After obtaining his PhD, Beals returned to Acadia University as an assistant professor of physics, but left one year later for an Assistant Astronomer position at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory (DAO), Victoria, British Columbia. Beals worked at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory from 1927 until 1946, becoming Assistant Director of the DAO in 1940.

At the DAO, he studied emission lines in the spectra of hot stars and gas clouds in the interstellar medium. His work established a reliable temperature scale for hotter stars, based on their spectra. He showed that the broad emission lines seen in Wolf-Rayet and P Cygni-type stars were due to strong stellar winds. Beals was the first astronomer to quantitatively measure the ratio of sodium and calcium absorption lines in the interstellar medium (the gas between stars) and the ratio of the two lines in the sodium D doublet. He also found that rather than being uniform, the interstellar medium was clumpy and moved with different velocities.

During his time at the DAO, he developed several astronomical instruments to analyse astronomical spectra, including a self-recording micro-photometer and a high efficiency grating spectrograph.

During World War II, Beals spent two-year researching defenses against chemical weapons and designed gas masks.

In 1946, he left the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in British Columbia and began work at the Dominion Observatory in Ottawa, Ontario. He was appointed Dominion Astronomer one year later, and began to rebuild the observatory&#x27;s scientific programme, which had suffered due to budget cuts during the great depression and a lack of staff during World War II. He also oversaw the establishment of the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory, near Penticton, British Columbia.

While in Ottawa, he became interested in the geophysical activities of the observatory. He began a study of meteorite impact craters in the Canadian shield, searching for circular features in aerial photographs and organising drill core studies of the most promising targets.

He retired in 1964, but continued his work on impact craters and published several works during his retirement.

== Awards and recognition ==
Beals was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1933. He was president of Academy of Science of the Royal Society of Canada from 1949-1950, and received the Henry Marshall Tory Medal from the Society in 1957 for outstanding achievement in scientific research.

He served as president of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada from 1951-1952. He also served as president of the American Astronomical Society from 1962-1964, the only Canadian to hold the position.

In March 1951, Beals was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. In 1966, he was awarded the inaugural Meteoritical Society Leonard Medal for his work on identifying Canadian impact craters. In 1969, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.

Beals received honorary degrees from Acadia University, the University of New Brunswick, Queen&#x27;s University and the University of Pittsburgh.

The Carlyle S. Beals Award was established by the Canadian Astronomical Society (CASCA) in 1981.

The asteroid 3314 Beals and the crater Beals on the Moon are both named for Beals.

== Personal life ==
In 1931, Beals married Miriam White Bancroft, a professional musician and piano teacher. She was the daughter of Joseph Bancroft, a longtime Liberal member of the Nova Scotia House of Assembly. The couple adopted a daughter, Janitza.

Beals died on July 2, 1979, aged 80.

<text>Mandal Church () is a parish church of the Church of Norway in Lindesnes Municipality in Agder county, Norway. It is located in the town of Mandal. It is one of the two churches for the Mandal parish which is part of the Lister og Mandal prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Agder og Telemark. The white, wooden church was built in a long church design in 1821 using plans drawn up by the architect Jørgen Gerhard Løser. It was designed in an empire/neoclassical style. The church seats about 1,000 people, making it the largest wooden church in Norway.

The sanctuary is a large hall supported by colossal columns. A small, cylindrical pulpit is placed above the altarpiece, a rather unusual location compared to most churches in Norway. The church is notable for its distinctive rectangular shape with a simple tower on the roof above the main entrance.

==History==
The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1358, but the church was not new at that time. The stone church was called Halse Church at that time, but beyond that not much is known about. The church was almost certainly a &quot;fylkeskirke&quot; or a county church, since in medieval times the council council for Agder met at Halse (now Mandal). A map from 1766 has a depiction of the church, and from this it may appear that it was a rectangular building. The choir had probably been expanded or rebuilt in the late Middle Ages so that the building had a rectangular floor plan where the nave and choir where the same width and roof line. In 1785 the church was described as dilapidated with a number of dangerous cracks in the masonry, and a few years later a large part of the &quot;east wall&quot; was demolished and rebuilt. In 1810, the town of Mandal had a massive fire, and most of the town, including the church, burned down.

After the fire, the town and its roads were redesigned, and it was decided to move the church about to the northeast of the former location. The new church was built in a nice flat area with lots of space for a cemetery to surround the church. Construction of rebuilding the whole town began soon after the fire, but it was slow going. Work on the church began in 1812 and was mostly finished by 1819. The church was officially opened and consecrated in 1821.

The architect for the new church was Jørgen Gerhard Løser who used copper engravings of the old church from 1728 by James Gibbs as inspiration for his designs. It was the first monumental building built in Norway after the Norway&#x27;s independence from Denmark in 1814.

The painting () is in the church and it was painted by Adolph Tidemand who grew up in Mandal. The church has not undergone major changes since it was opened, but in 2014 a major restoration project on the building was begun to remove extensive dry rot and make many structural repairs. The repairs cost about .

===Election church===
In 1814, this church served as an election church (). Together with more than 300 other parish churches across Norway, it was a polling station for elections to the 1814 Norwegian Constituent Assembly which wrote the Constitution of Norway. This was Norway&#x27;s first national elections. Each church parish was a constituency that elected people called &quot;electors&quot; who later met together in each county to elect the representatives for the assembly that was to meet in Eidsvoll later that year.

<doc id="681572" wikidata="Q4406896" url="?curid=681572" title="Self-insurance">
<text>Self insurance is a risk management method in which an organization that is liable for some risk does not take out any third-party insurance, but rather chooses to bear the risk itself. When used prudently, the organization that self insures sets aside money using actuarial and insurance information and the law of large numbers so that the amount set aside (similar to an insurance premium) is enough to cover the future uncertain loss. The advantage is that no premium has to be paid, but the organizations own assets are used to pay out claims or losses.

The idea of self insurance is that by retaining, calculating risks, and paying the resulting claims or losses from captive or on-balance sheet financial provisions, the overall process is cheaper than buying commercial insurance from a commercial insurance company. Cost savings to the self-insured entity are usually realised through the elimination of the carrying-costs that commercial insurers are obliged to pass on to their insurance consumers. 

Self insurance is not often used by individuals because they rarely have the funds to cover large uncertain risks and rarely gain sufficient cost-savings on premiums to justify taking on the risk unless third party insurance is not available to them. Self-insurance may not be possible when there is a legal obligation to hold insurance such as mandatory third-party car insurance that is required in some countries. In some cases organizations need to apply for special licenses to self-insure certain risks, such as employee benefits insurance.

== Usage ==
Self insurance can be used for any insurable risk, meaning a risk that is predictable and measurable enough in the aggregate to be able to estimate the amount that needs to be set aside to pay for future uncertain losses. For a risk to be insurable, it must represent a future, uncertain event over which the insured has no control. Other characteristics which assist in making a risk self-insurable include the ability to price or rate the risk. If the insurable event is one in a large number of similar risks, the aggregate risk can be estimated according to the law of large numbers and the probability of that event occurring in the future can be quantified. 

Normally, catastrophic risks are not self-insured as they are highly unpredictable and high in loss-value. Catastrophic risks are normally underwritten by the re-insurance or wholesale insurance market. Any risk where the potential loss is so large that no one could afford to pay the market premium required to provide cover would not be commercially insurable. An example is that earthquakes cannot be fully insured against because an earthquake can cause more damage than any insurer or the combined insurance market is willing to risk in total assets. However, captives and self-insurance programmes are often designed to provide for a part of a risk that would be catastrophic to the business concerned, or catastrophic risks that are often commercially uninsurable, such as tobacco litigation liability risks.

Full or exclusive self-insurance is rare, most common is a combination of self-insurance and commercial insurance. Usually the predictable losses of the risk are retained and self-insured, forming a first or &quot;working&quot; layer of cover, and a stop-loss or stop-gap policy is purchased from the commercial insurance market. The commercial insurance market then pays for losses above the specified self-insurance limit per loss, thereby stopping the cost of losses to the self-insured above the retained values. Effectively the losses paid for by the insured before the stop-loss policy pays becomes the deductible layer. Depending on the level at which risks are stopped, commercial insurance cover should become less and less expensive the further away the commercial insurer moves from the working layer of paying claims each year.

A popular and cost-effective form of self-insurance can be found in various types of employee benefits insurance offered by corporations with many thousands of employees. Employee benefits self-insurance programmes are often underwritten by captive insurance companies formed, owned and managed by corporations in both on-shore and off-shore captive domiciles. The reason for this is that hundreds of thousands of employees constitute a large enough risk pool for the corporation to be able to predict and price the risk of losses from benefits offered to employees. In this way, corporations are able to manage their financial exposure to the self-insurance programme without buying commercial insurance.

Another example of this is a self-funded health care plan under which a smaller employer helps finance the health care costs of its employees by contracting with a Third Party Administrator (TPA) to administer many aspects of the plan. The employer may also contract with a reinsurer to pay amounts in excess of a certain threshold, in order to share the risk for potential catastrophic claims experience.

In the United States the concept applies especially to self-funded health care and may involve, for example, an employer providing certain benefits – generally health benefits or disability benefits – to employees and funding claims from a specified pool of assets rather than through an insurance company, as the term is traditionally used. In self-funded health care, the employer ultimately retains the full risk of paying claims, in contrast to traditional insurance, where all risk is transferred to the insurer.

<doc id="681579" wikidata="Q1047683" url="?curid=681579" title="Quasiparticle">
<text>In condensed matter physics, a quasiparticle is a concept used to describe a collective behavior of a group of particles that can be treated as if they were a single particle. Formally, quasiparticles and collective excitations are closely related phenomena that arise when a microscopically complicated system such as a solid behaves as if it contained different weakly interacting particles in vacuum.

For example, as an electron travels through a semiconductor, its motion is disturbed in a complex way by its interactions with other electrons and with atomic nuclei. The electron behaves as though it has a different effective mass travelling unperturbed in vacuum. Such an electron is called an &quot;electron quasiparticle&quot;. In another example, the aggregate motion of electrons in the valence band of a semiconductor or a hole band in a metal behave as though the material instead contained positively charged quasiparticles called &quot;electron holes&quot;. Other quasiparticles or collective excitations include the &quot;phonon&quot;, a quasiparticle derived from the vibrations of atoms in a solid, and the &quot;plasmon&quot;, a particle derived from plasma oscillation.

These phenomena are typically called &quot;quasiparticles&quot; if they are related to fermions, and called &quot;collective excitations&quot; if they are related to bosons, although the precise distinction is not universally agreed upon. Thus, electrons and electron holes (fermions) are typically called &quot;quasiparticles&quot;, while phonons and plasmons (bosons) are typically called &quot;collective excitations&quot;.

The quasiparticle concept is important in condensed matter physics because it can simplify the many-body problem in quantum mechanics. The theory of quasiparticles was started by the Soviet physicist Lev Landau in the 1930s.

==Overview==

===General introduction===
Solids are made of only three kinds of particles: electrons, protons, and neutrons. None of these are quasiparticles; instead a quasiparticle is an &quot;emergent phenomenon&quot; that occurs inside the solid. Therefore, while it is quite possible to have a single particle (electron, proton, or neutron) floating in space, a quasiparticle can only exist inside interacting many-particle systems such as solids.

Motion in a solid is extremely complicated: Each electron and proton is pushed and pulled (by Coulomb&#x27;s law) by all the other electrons and protons in the solid (which may themselves be in motion). It is these strong interactions that make it very difficult to predict and understand the behavior of solids (see many-body problem). On the other hand, the motion of a &quot;non-interacting&quot; classical particle is relatively simple; it would move in a straight line at constant velocity. This is the motivation for the concept of quasiparticles: The complicated motion of the &quot;real&quot; particles in a solid can be mathematically transformed into the much simpler motion of imagined quasiparticles, which behave more like non-interacting particles.

In summary, quasiparticles are a mathematical tool for simplifying the description of solids.

===Relation to many-body quantum mechanics===

The principal motivation for quasiparticles is that it is almost impossible to &quot;directly&quot; describe every particle in a macroscopic system. For example, a barely-visible (0.1mm) grain of sand contains around 1017 nuclei and 1018 electrons. Each of these attracts or repels every other by Coulomb&#x27;s law. In principle, the Schrödinger equation predicts exactly how this system will behave. But the Schrödinger equation in this case is a partial differential equation (PDE) on a 3×1018-dimensional vector space—one dimension for each coordinate (x, y, z) of each particle. Directly and straightforwardly trying to solve such a PDE is impossible in practice. Solving a PDE on a 2-dimensional space is typically much harder than solving a PDE on a 1-dimensional space (whether analytically or numerically); solving a PDE on a 3-dimensional space is significantly harder still; and thus solving a PDE on a 3×1018-dimensional space is quite impossible by straightforward methods.

One simplifying factor is that the system as a whole, like any quantum system, has a ground state and various excited states with higher and higher energy above the ground state. In many contexts, only the &quot;low-lying&quot; excited states, with energy reasonably close to the ground state, are relevant. This occurs because of the Boltzmann distribution, which implies that very-high-energy thermal fluctuations are unlikely to occur at any given temperature.

Quasiparticles and collective excitations are a type of low-lying excited state. For example, a crystal at absolute zero is in the ground state, but if one phonon is added to the crystal (in other words, if the crystal is made to vibrate slightly at a particular frequency) then the crystal is now in a low-lying excited state. The single phonon is called an &quot;elementary excitation&quot;. More generally, low-lying excited states may contain any number of elementary excitations (for example, many phonons, along with other quasiparticles and collective excitations).

When the material is characterized as having &quot;several elementary excitations&quot;, this statement presupposes that the different excitations can be combined. In other words, it presupposes that the excitations can coexist simultaneously and independently. This is never &quot;exactly&quot; true. For example, a solid with two identical phonons does not have exactly twice the excitation energy of a solid with just one phonon, because the crystal vibration is slightly anharmonic. However, in many materials, the elementary excitations are very &quot;close&quot; to being independent. Therefore, as a &quot;starting point&quot;, they are treated as free, independent entities, and then corrections are included via interactions between the elementary excitations, such as &quot;phonon-phonon scattering&quot;.

Therefore, using quasiparticles / collective excitations, instead of analyzing 1018 particles, one needs to deal with only a handful of somewhat-independent elementary excitations. It is, therefore, an effective approach to simplify the many-body problem in quantum mechanics. This approach is not useful for &quot;all&quot; systems, however. For example, in strongly correlated materials, the elementary excitations are so far from being independent that it is not even useful as a starting point to treat them as independent.

===Distinction between quasiparticles and collective excitations===
Usually, an elementary excitation is called a &quot;quasiparticle&quot; if it is a fermion and a &quot;collective excitation&quot; if it is a boson. However, the precise distinction is not universally agreed upon.

There is a difference in the way that quasiparticles and collective excitations are intuitively envisioned. A quasiparticle is usually thought of as being like a dressed particle: it is built around a real particle at its &quot;core&quot;, but the behavior of the particle is affected by the environment. A standard example is the &quot;electron quasiparticle&quot;: an electron in a crystal behaves as if it had an effective mass which differs from its real mass. On the other hand, a collective excitation is usually imagined to be a reflection of the aggregate behavior of the system, with no single real particle at its &quot;core&quot;. A standard example is the phonon, which characterizes the vibrational motion of every atom in the crystal.

However, these two visualizations leave some ambiguity. For example, a magnon in a ferromagnet can be considered in one of two perfectly equivalent ways: (a) as a mobile defect (a misdirected spin) in a perfect alignment of magnetic moments or (b) as a quantum of a collective spin wave that involves the precession of many spins. In the first case, the magnon is envisioned as a quasiparticle, in the second case, as a collective excitation. However, both (a) and (b) are equivalent and correct descriptions. As this example shows, the intuitive distinction between a quasiparticle and a collective excitation is not particularly important or fundamental.

The problems arising from the collective nature of quasiparticles have also been discussed within the philosophy of science, notably in relation to the identity conditions of quasiparticles and whether they should be considered &quot;real&quot; by the standards of, for example, entity realism.

===Effect on bulk properties===
By investigating the properties of individual quasiparticles, it is possible to obtain a great deal of information about low-energy systems, including the flow properties and heat capacity.

In the heat capacity example, a crystal can store energy by forming phonons, and/or forming excitons, and/or forming plasmons, etc. Each of these is a separate contribution to the overall heat capacity.

===History===
The idea of quasiparticles originated in Lev Landau&#x27;s theory of Fermi liquids, which was originally invented for studying liquid helium-3. For these systems a strong similarity exists between the notion of quasiparticle and dressed particles in quantum field theory. The dynamics of Landau&#x27;s theory is defined by a kinetic equation of the mean-field type. A similar equation, the Vlasov equation, is valid for a plasma in the so-called plasma approximation. In the plasma approximation, charged particles are considered to be moving in the electromagnetic field collectively generated by all other particles, and hard collisions between the charged particles are neglected. When a kinetic equation of the mean-field type is a valid first-order description of a system, second-order corrections determine the entropy production, and generally take the form of a Boltzmann-type collision term, in which figure only &quot;far collisions&quot; between virtual particles. In other words, every type of mean-field kinetic equation, and in fact every mean-field theory, involves a quasiparticle concept.

==Common examples ==

This section contains most common examples of quasiparticles and collective excitations. 

*In solids, an electron quasiparticle is an electron as affected by the other forces and interactions in the solid. The electron quasiparticle has the same charge and spin as a &quot;normal&quot; (elementary particle) electron, and like a normal electron, it is a fermion. However, its mass can differ substantially from that of a normal electron; see the article effective mass. Its electric field is also modified, as a result of electric field screening. In many other respects, especially in metals under ordinary conditions, these so-called Landau quasiparticles closely resemble familiar electrons; as Crommie&#x27;s &quot;quantum corral&quot; showed, an STM can image their interference upon scattering.
*A hole is a quasiparticle consisting of the lack of an electron in a state; it is most commonly used in the context of empty states in the valence band of a semiconductor. A hole has the opposite charge of an electron.
*A phonon is a collective excitation associated with the vibration of atoms in a rigid crystal structure. It is a quantum of a sound wave.
*A magnon is a collective excitation associated with the electrons&#x27; spin structure in a crystal lattice. It is a quantum of a spin wave.
*In materials, a photon quasiparticle is a photon as affected by its interactions with the material. In particular, the photon quasiparticle has a modified relation between wavelength and energy (dispersion relation), as described by the material&#x27;s index of refraction. It may also be termed a polariton, especially near a resonance of the material. For example, an exciton-polariton is a superposition of an exciton and a photon; a phonon-polariton is a superposition of a phonon and a photon.
*A plasmon is a collective excitation, which is the quantum of plasma oscillations (wherein all the electrons simultaneously oscillate with respect to all the ions).
*A polaron is a quasiparticle which comes about when an electron interacts with the polarization of its surrounding ions.
*An exciton is an electron and hole bound together.

<text>In physics, an effective field theory is a type of approximation, or effective theory, for an underlying physical theory, such as a quantum field theory or a statistical mechanics model. An effective field theory includes the appropriate degrees of freedom to describe physical phenomena occurring at a chosen length scale or energy scale, while ignoring substructure and degrees of freedom at shorter distances (or, equivalently, at higher energies). Intuitively, one averages over the behavior of the underlying theory at shorter length scales to derive what is hoped to be a simplified model at longer length scales. Effective field theories typically work best when there is a large separation between length scale of interest and the length scale of the underlying dynamics. Effective field theories have found use in particle physics, statistical mechanics, condensed matter physics, general relativity, and hydrodynamics. They simplify calculations, and allow treatment of dissipation and radiation effects.

==Renormalization group==
Presently, effective field theories are discussed in the context of the renormalization group (RG) where the process of &quot;integrating out&quot; short distance degrees of freedom is made systematic. Although this method is not sufficiently concrete to allow the actual construction of effective field theories, the gross understanding of their usefulness becomes clear through an RG analysis. This method also lends credence to the main technique of constructing effective field theories, through the analysis of symmetries. If there is a single energy scale formula_1 in the &quot;microscopic&quot; theory, then the effective field theory can be seen as an expansion in formula_2. The construction of an effective field theory accurate to some power of formula_2 requires a new set of free parameters at each order of the expansion in formula_2. This technique is useful for scattering or other processes where the maximum momentum scale formula_5 satisfies the condition formula_6. Since effective field theories are not valid at small length scales, they need not be renormalizable. Indeed, the ever expanding number of parameters at each order in formula_2 required for an effective field theory means that they are generally not renormalizable in the same sense as quantum electrodynamics which requires only the renormalization of two parameters (the fine structure constant and the electron mass).

==Examples==
===Fermi theory of beta decay===
The best-known example of an effective field theory is the Fermi theory of beta decay. This theory was developed during the early study of weak decays of nuclei when only the hadrons and leptons undergoing weak decay were known. The typical reactions studied were:

::formula_8

This theory posited a pointlike interaction between the four fermions involved in these reactions. The theory had great phenomenological success and was eventually understood to arise from the gauge theory of electroweak interactions, which forms a part of the standard model of particle physics. In this more fundamental theory, the interactions are mediated by a flavour-changing gauge boson, the W±. The immense success of the Fermi theory was because the W particle has mass of about 80 GeV, whereas the early experiments were all done at an energy scale of less than 10 MeV. Such a separation of scales, by over 3 orders of magnitude, has not been met in any other situation as yet.

===BCS theory of superconductivity===
Another famous example is the BCS theory of superconductivity. Here the underlying theory is the theory of electrons in a metal interacting with lattice vibrations called phonons. The phonons cause attractive interactions between some electrons, causing them to form Cooper pairs. The length scale of these pairs is much larger than the wavelength of phonons, making it possible to neglect the dynamics of phonons and construct a theory in which two electrons effectively interact at a point. This theory has had remarkable success in describing and predicting the results of experiments on superconductivity.

===Gravitational field theories ===
General relativity (GR) itself is expected to be the low energy effective field theory of a full theory of quantum gravity, such as string theory or loop quantum gravity. The expansion scale is the Planck mass.
Effective field theories have also been used to simplify problems in general relativity, in particular in calculating the gravitational wave signature of inspiralling finite-sized objects. The most common EFT in GR is non-relativistic general relativity (NRGR), which is similar to the post-Newtonian expansion. Another common GR EFT is the extreme mass ratio (EMR), which in the context of the inspiralling problem is called extreme mass ratio inspiral.

===Other examples===
Presently, effective field theories are written for many situations.
*One major branch of nuclear physics is quantum hadrodynamics, where the interactions of hadrons are treated as a field theory, which should be derivable from the underlying theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Quantum hadrodynamics is the theory of the nuclear force, similarly to quantum chromodynamics being the theory of the strong interaction and quantum electrodynamics being the theory of the electromagnetic force. Due to the smaller separation of length scales here, this effective theory has some classificatory power, but not the spectacular success of the Fermi theory.
*In particle physics the effective field theory of QCD called chiral perturbation theory has had better success. This theory deals with the interactions of hadrons with pions or kaons, which are the Goldstone bosons of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking. The expansion parameter is the pion energy/momentum.
*For hadrons containing one heavy quark (such as the bottom or charm), an effective field theory which expands in powers of the quark mass, called the heavy quark effective theory (HQET), has been found useful.
*For hadrons containing two heavy quarks, an effective field theory which expands in powers of the relative velocity of the heavy quarks, called non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD), has been found useful, especially when used in conjunctions with lattice QCD.
*For hadron reactions with light energetic (collinear) particles, the interactions with low-energetic (soft) degrees of freedom are described by the soft-collinear effective theory (SCET).
*Much of condensed matter physics consists of writing effective field theories for the particular property of matter being studied.
*Dissipationless hydrodynamics can also be treated using effective field theories.

<text>The Lithuanian Football Federation (LFF; ) is the governing body of football in Lithuania. The Federation is responsible for football development in the country and for the national teams, including the Lithuania national football team. It is based in Vilnius. LFF became a member of FIFA in 1923, but following Lithuania&#x27;s annexation by the Soviet Union it was disbanded. It became a member again in 1992 after Lithuania regained its independence. The top division is A Lyga.

When one French journalist saw a full basketball arena (where &quot;Lietuvos rytas&quot; fought in ULEB cup semifinals) close to an empty stadium (where a Baltic Football League match took place) he published an article that Lithuania is a land where the beautiful game has to live in basketball&#x27;s shadow.

In reality, the popularity of football is on the rise and the very few games that are on par in terms of quality with the ULEB cup semifinals also attract full stadiums as well as a TV following. This craze is mostly imported from other European nations, such as England, where many Lithuanians emigrated since the country has joined the European Union in 2004.

However, unlike basketball, Lithuanian football is relatively weak. The national team has never qualified for the European Championships or World Cup. In football, the element of luck is bigger than in basketball, therefore there were times when the Lithuanians scored draw against major teams such as Germany, Italy or Spain. However, defeats to the likes of the Faroe Islands or Liechtenstein soon afterward dash the hopes of Lithuanian fans and decrease the popularity of football.

Football clubs of Lithuania attract less funding than their basketball counterparts and so they are weak, relying on Lithuanian players and foreigners who did not manage to get a hold into their national leagues. Not a single Lithuanian team ever took part in the main stages of the Champions’ League or the UEFA Cup until 2022. Moreover, the Lithuanian national football league is frequently dipped into scandals of betting fraud. Panevėžio Ekranas from Panevėžys long dominated this league in the early 2010s, amassing a yearly budget of 2 million Euros. FBK Kaunas used to prevail in the 1990s and 2000s (both the Kaunas and Panevėžys teams were eventually expelled from the league in 2009 and 2015 respectively, because of debts and controversies). FK Zalgiris Vilnius was the best Lithuanian team in the 1980s and still has a larger fan base than other Lithuanian football clubs. It has recently returned to prominence, dominating the league once again in the 2010s.

The national futsal team have taken part in both FIFA Futsal World Cup and UEFA Futsal Euro.

Their first appearance team was in 2021 as the host and will do the same for the UEFA Futsal Euro 2026 also as host alongside Latvia.

<doc id="681587" wikidata="Q640299" url="?curid=681587" title="Little Deuce Coupe">
<text>Little Deuce Coupe is the fourth album by the American rock band the Beach Boys, released October 7, 1963 by Capitol Records. It reached No. 4 in the U.S. during a chart stay of 46 weeks, and was eventually certified platinum by the RIAA. It is considered to be one of the earliest examples of a rock concept album.

The album was released three weeks after &quot;Surfer Girl&quot;. Four of the tracks from &quot;Little Deuce Coupe&quot; (&quot;409&quot;, &quot;Shut Down&quot;, &quot;Little Deuce Coupe&quot;, and &quot;Our Car Club&quot;) had already appeared on previous albums, and discounting an alternate recording of &quot;Be True to Your School&quot;, no tracks from the album were issued as an A-sided single.

==Production==
As with the preceding &quot;Surfer Girl&quot; album, the date assigned for recording all eight of the new tracks (September 2, 1963) is highly doubtful. However, as no AFM contracts from these sessions are known to exist, the actual dates are currently unknown.

Although Nick Venet was listed as producer for &quot;Shut Down&quot; and Murry Wilson for &quot;409&quot;, the official producer&#x27;s credit for the entire &quot;Little Deuce Coupe&quot; album cites only Brian Wilson. Despite the rushed nature of the album&#x27;s sessions, Wilson&#x27;s song arrangements were notably becoming more complex, specifically songs like &quot;No-Go Showboat&quot; and &quot;Custom Machine&quot;. This was the last Beach Boys album to officially include rhythm guitarist David Marks until 2012&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s Why God Made the Radio&quot;.

After the album&#x27;s recording, Wilson re-recorded &quot;Be True to Your School&quot; for single release on October 28, resulting in another top 10 hit. An original Christmas-themed composition, &quot;Little Saint Nick&quot; was also recorded that month and issued as a Christmas single.

==Title and cover art==

A Deuce Coupe is a 1932 Ford Coupe (&quot;deuce&quot; being for the year). This was considered by many to be the definitive &quot;hot rod&quot;. The Model B had four cylinders and the Model 18 featured the Ford flathead V8 engine when the car was introduced. A &quot;pink slip&quot; (mentioned in the lyrics) was the title to the car, named for the color of the paper then used in California.

The picture featured on the front cover of the album was supplied by &quot;Hot Rod&quot; magazine, and features the body (with his head cropped in the photo) of hot-rod owner Clarence &#x27;Chili&#x27; Catallo and his own customized three-window 1932 Ford Coupe – known to hot rod enthusiasts as &quot;the lil&#x27; deuce coupe&quot;.

==Track listing==


Notes
* Some reissues of the album omit &quot;Car Crazy Cutie&quot; and &quot;Custom Machine&quot;.
* Because &quot;409&quot; was only available in mono, a Duophonic (fake stereo) mix was used on the otherwise true stereo version of the album. Both stereo and mono mixes are available on the 2012 CD.
* Mike Love was not originally credited for &quot;Be True to Your School&quot;, &quot;409&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Back Down&quot;, and &quot;Custom Machine&quot;. His credits were awarded after a 1994 court case.

<doc id="681590" wikidata="Q685501" url="?curid=681590" title="Lucrezia Borgia (opera)">
<text>Lucrezia Borgia is a melodramatic opera in a prologue and two acts by Gaetano Donizetti. Felice Romani wrote the Italian libretto after the play &quot;Lucrezia Borgia&quot; by Victor Hugo, in its turn after the legend of Lucrezia Borgia. &quot;Lucrezia Borgia&quot; was first performed on 26 December 1833 at La Scala, Milan.

==Performance history==

=== 19th century ===
Because of its scandalous subject matter, &quot;Lucrezia Borgia&quot; was taken up slowly in Italy and presented in many Italian theatres with altered titles and, in some cases, altered character names. It was given in Florence, beginning on 12 November 1838, as &quot;Eustorgia da Romano&quot;, in Trieste in the autumn of 1838 as &quot;Alfonso Duca di Ferrara&quot;, in Ferrara on 14 April 1841 as &quot;Giovanna I di Napoli&quot;, and in Rome on 26 December 1841 as &quot;Elisa da Fosco&quot;.

The first London production was at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre on 6 June 1839 with Giulia Grisi and Mario. When the opera was staged in Paris (Théâtre des Italiens) in 1840, Victor Hugo obtained an injunction against further productions within the domain of French copyright law. The libretto was then rewritten and retitled &quot;La rinnegata&quot;, with the Italian characters changed to Turks, and the performances were resumed.

The first English-language production was in London on 30 December 1843. The English tenor Sims Reeves was a noted Gennaro. &quot;Lucrezia&quot; was first presented in New Orleans on 27 April 1843 and then at New York&#x27;s American Theatre on 11 May 1843 and later at the Palmo&#x27;s Opera House in 1847: with Giulia Grisi in 1854; and with Thérèse Tietjens and Brignoli in 1876. It was given at the Academy of Music, Philadelphia, in 1882, and at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York, in 1904, with Enrico Caruso as Gennaro and Arturo Vigna conducting.

=== 20th century and beyond ===
A famous performance of &quot;Lucrezia Borgia&quot; presented by the American Opera Society Ensemble in 1965 at Carnegie Hall with soprano Montserrat Caballé, who was making her American debut, was soon followed by a recording featuring Caballé, Shirley Verrett, Alfredo Kraus, and Ezio Flagello, conducted by Jonel Perlea, who also led the Carnegie Hall performance.

&quot;Lucrezia Borgia&quot; is often produced as a vehicle for a star soprano, including Leyla Gencer, Mariella Devia, Beverly Sills, Dame Joan Sutherland, Renée Fleming, Edita Gruberová and Sondra Radvanovsky.

== Roles ==
== Synopsis ==

:Time: Early 16th century
:Place: Venice and Ferrara

===Prologue===

==== Scene 1 ====
&quot;The Palazzo Grimani in Venice&quot;

Gennaro and his friends, including Orsini, celebrate on the brightly lit terrace, in front of which lies the Giudecca Canal (&quot;Bella Venezia!&quot;). The friends&#x27; conversation turns to Don Alfonso, Duke of Ferrara, to whose house they will be travelling the next day, and to his wife, the infamous Lucrezia Borgia. On hearing Lucrezia&#x27;s name, Orsini tells of how Gennaro and he, alone in a forest, were warned by a mysterious old man to beware her and the entire Borgia family, and that the two of them would die together (&quot;Nella fatal di Rimini&quot;). Professing his boredom with Orsini&#x27;s tale Gennaro wanders off and falls asleep nearby. His friends are invited to rejoin the festivities, and he is left behind (&quot;Senti! La danza invitaci&quot;).

==== Scenes 2 and 3 ====
A gondola appears, and from it a masked woman exits onto the terrace (&quot;Tranquillo ei posa...&quot;). She observes the sleeping Gennaro with affection and hurries over to him (&quot;Com&#x27;è bello! Quale incanto in quel volto onesto e altero!&quot;). When she kisses Gennaro&#x27;s hand, he wakes and is instantly struck by her beauty (&quot;Leggiadra e amabil siete&quot;). He expresses his love for her, but admits that the one person nearer to him is his mother that he has never met. He sings of his childhood as an orphan brought up by a common fisherman father (&quot;Di pescatore ignobile esser figliuol credei&quot;). The woman, sympathetic to his plight, weeps for him (&quot;Ama tua madre, e tenero sempre per lei ti serba...&quot;).

The others return (&quot;Gente appressa... io ti lascio&quot;) and seem to recognise her, listing in turn the members of their families she has killed, to Gennaro&#x27;s horror and disbelief (&quot;Maffio Orsini, signora, son&#x27;io&quot;). Gennaro is then finally told that the woman is Lucrezia Borgia.

===Act 1===

&quot;Ferrara&quot;

The Duke, believing Gennaro to be Lucrezia&#x27;s lover, plots his murder with his servant Rustighello (&quot;Vieni: la mia vendetta è meditata e pronta&quot;). Gennaro and his companions leave the house for a party and pass the Duke&#x27;s palace with its large gilded coat of arms reading &quot;Borgia&quot;. Keen to show his contempt for the Borgia family, Gennaro removes the initial &quot;B&quot;, leaving the obscene &quot;Orgia&quot; (orgy).

In the palace, Lucrezia is shown into the Duke&#x27;s chamber. Having seen the defaced crest, she demands death for the perpetrator, not knowing that it is Gennaro. The Duke orders Gennaro to be brought before her and accuses him of staining the noble name of Borgia, a crime to which he readily confesses. Lucrezia, horrified, attempts to excuse the insult as a youthful prank, but Don Alfonso accuses Lucrezia of infidelity, having observed her meeting with Gennaro in Venice. In a scene full of drama and tension, she denies any impropriety, but he demands the prisoner&#x27;s death and forces her to choose the manner of Gennaro&#x27;s execution. Pretending to pardon him, the Duke offers Gennaro a poisoned glass of wine, which he proceeds to drink. After a stunning trio (&quot;Guai se ti sfugge un moto, se ti tradisce un detto!&quot;) the Duke leaves and Lucrezia hurries to Gennaro, giving him an antidote to the poison the Duke has mixed with the wine. He drinks, and in a last duet, she implores him to flee the city and her husband (&quot;Bevi e fuggi... te&#x27;n prego, o Gennaro!&quot;).

===Act 2===
&quot;The palace of the Princess Negroni&quot;

Ignoring Lucrezia&#x27;s advice, Gennaro attends a party at the palace, swearing never to be parted from his friend Orsini. Orsini leads the party in a &quot;brindisi&quot; or drinking song (&quot;Il segreto per esser felici&quot;) and they drink. Lucrezia enters and announces that in revenge for their insults in Venice she has poisoned their wine and arranged five coffins for their bodies. She has hitherto believed that Gennaro fled Ferrara on her advice, and is thus dismayed when he steps forward and announces that she has poisoned a sixth. Orsini, Liverotto, Vitellozzo, Petrucci and Gazella fall dead. Gennaro seizes a dagger and attempts to kill Lucrezia, but she stops him by revealing that he is in fact her son. Once again she asks him to drink the antidote, but this time he refuses, choosing to die with his friends. In a final cabaletta (&quot;Era desso il figlio mio&quot;), Lucrezia mourns her son and expires.

== Music ==

The closing cabaletta &quot;Era desso il figlio mio&quot; was added by Donizetti upon insistence by renowned soprano Henriette Méric-Lalande, who created the role of Lucrezia Borgia. It is one of the most demanding arias in all the operatic repertoire, with trills and coloratura passages that demand extreme vocal agility. Donizetti later removed the aria because he believed it damaged the credibility of the ending.

<doc id="681593" wikidata="Q1412851" url="?curid=681593" title="Geant4">
<text>Geant4 (for GEometry ANd Tracking) is a platform for &quot;the simulation of the passage of particles through matter&quot; using Monte Carlo methods. It is the successor of the GEANT series of software toolkits developed by The Geant4 Collaboration, and the first to use object oriented programming (in C++). Its development, maintenance and user support are taken care by the international Geant4 Collaboration. Application areas include high energy physics and nuclear experiments, accelerator and space physics studies. The software is used by a number of research projects around the world.

The Geant4 software and source code is freely available from the project web site; until version 8.1 (released June 28, 2006), no specific software license for its use existed; Geant4 is now provided under the Geant4 Software License.

== Features ==
Geant4 includes facilities for handling geometry, tracking, detector response, run management, visualization and user interface. For many physics simulations, this means less time needs to be spent on the low level details, and researchers can start immediately on the more important aspects of the simulation.

Following is a summary of each of the facilities listed above:
* &quot;Geometry&quot; is an analysis of the physical layout of the experiment, including detectors, absorbers, etc., and considering how this layout will affect the path of particles in the experiment.
* &quot;Tracking&quot; is simulating the passage of a particle through matter. This involves considering possible interactions and decay processes.
* &quot;Detector response&quot; is recording when a particle passes through the volume of a detector, and approximating how a real detector would respond.
* &quot;Run management&quot; is recording the details of each &quot;run&quot; (a set of &quot;events&quot;), as well as setting up the experiment in different configurations between runs.
* Geant4 offers a number of options for &quot;visualization&quot;, including OpenGL, Open Inventor, VRML or VTK and a familiar &quot;user interface&quot;, based on tcsh or Qt.

Geant4 can also perform basic histogramming; it requires external analysis tools for exploiting advanced histogramming features.

Since release 10.0, Geant4 implements multithreading, making use of thread-local storage to allow for efficient generation of simulated events in parallel. Geant4 can be installed under a Unix-based operating system such as MacOS, Linux or under Microsoft Windows.

== Some high energy physics experiments using Geant4 ==
* BES III at BEPCII
* BaBar and GLAST at SLAC
* ATLAS, CMS and LHCb at LHC, CERN
* COMPASS at SPS, CERN
* Borexino at Gran Sasso Laboratory
* DUNE, MINOS, Muon g-2, and Mu2e at Fermilab
* Enriched Xenon Observatory (EXO)
* SNO+
* IceCube
* T2K
* CUORE
* Dark Matter Detectors: SuperCDMS, LUX, LZ, XENON

== Applications outside high energy physics ==

Because of its general purpose nature, Geant4 is well suited for development of computational tools for analysing interactions of particle with matter in many areas. These include:
* Space applications where it is used to study interactions between the natural space radiation environment and space hardware or astronauts;
* Radiation effects in microelectronics where ionizing effects on semiconductor devices are modeled.
* Nuclear physics

<doc id="681596" wikidata="Q1539423" url="?curid=681596" title="Northrop Grumman X-47A Pegasus">
<text>The Northrop Grumman X-47 is a demonstration unmanned combat aerial vehicle. The X-47 began as part of DARPA&#x27;s J-UCAS program, and is now part of the United States Navy&#x27;s UCAS-D program to create a carrier-based unmanned aircraft. Unlike the Boeing X-45, initial Pegasus development was company-funded. The original vehicle carries the designation X-47A Pegasus, while the follow-on naval version is designated X-47B.

==Design and development==

The US Navy did not commit to practical UCAV efforts until mid-2000, when the service awarded contracts of US$2 million each to Boeing and Northrop Grumman for a 15-month concept-exploration program.

Design considerations for a naval UCAV included dealing with the corrosive salt-water environment, deck handling for launch and recovery, integration with command and control systems, and operation in a carrier&#x27;s high electromagnetic interference environment. The Navy was also interested in using their UCAVs for reconnaissance missions, penetrating protected airspace to identify targets for the attack waves.

The Navy went on to give Northrop Grumman a contract for a naval UCAV demonstrator with the designation of &quot;X-47A Pegasus&quot;, in early 2001. The proof-of-concept X-47A vehicle was built under contract by Burt Rutan&#x27;s Scaled Composites at the Mojave Spaceport. The Pegasus demonstrator looks like a simple black arrowhead with no vertical tailplane. It has a leading edge sweep of 55 degrees and a trailing edge sweep of 35 degrees. The demonstrator has retractable tricycle landing gear, with a one-wheel nose gear and dual-wheel main gear, and has six control surfaces, including two elevons and four &quot;inlaids&quot;. The inlaids are small flap structures mounted on the top and bottom of the wing forward of the wingtips.

The X-47A is powered by a single Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada JT15D-5C small high-bypass turbofan engine with 3,190 lbf (14.2 kN) thrust. This engine is currently in use with operational aircraft such as the Aermacchi S-211 trainer. The engine is mounted on the demonstrator&#x27;s back, with the inlet on top behind the nose. The inlet duct has a serpentine diffuser to prevent radar reflections off the engine fan. However, to keep costs low, the engine exhaust is a simple cylindrical tailpipe, with no provisions for reducing radar or infrared signature.

The X-47A&#x27;s airframe is built of composite materials, with construction subcontracted out to Burt Rutan&#x27;s Scaled Composites company, which had the expertise and tooling to do the job inexpensively. The airframe consists of four main assemblies, split down the middle with two assemblies on top and two on bottom.

The X-47A was rolled out on 30 July 2001 and performed its first flight on 23 February 2003 at the Naval Air Warfare Center at China Lake, California. The flight test program did not involve weapons delivery, but Pegasus does have two weapons bays, one on each side of the engine, that may be each loaded with a single 500 pound (225 kg) dummy bomb to simulate operational flight loads. The Pegasus was also used to evaluate technologies for carrier deck landings, though the demonstrator did not have a tailhook. Other issues related to carrier operations involve adding deck tie-downs without compromising stealth characteristics, and designing access panels so that they would not be blown around or damaged by strong winds blowing across the carrier deck. The J-UCAS program was terminated in February 2006 following the US military&#x27;s Quadrennial Defense Review. The US Air Force and US Navy proceeded with their own UAV programs. The Navy selected Northrop Grumman&#x27;s X-47B as its Unmanned Combat Air System Demonstrator (UCAS-D) program.

<text>The Tappan Zee (; also Tappan Sea or Tappaan Zee) is a natural widening of the Hudson River, about across at its widest, in southeastern New York. It stretches about along the boundary between Rockland and Westchester counties, downstream from Croton Point to Irvington. Its name is from the Tappan people of the Lenape, and the Dutch word &quot;&quot; , meaning a sea.

Flanked to the west by high steep bluffs of the Palisades, it forms something of a natural lake on the Hudson about north of Manhattan. Communities along the Tappan Zee include Nyack on the western side as well as Ossining and Tarrytown on the eastern side. It was formerly crossed by the Governor Malcolm Wilson Tappan Zee Bridge, opened in 1955 and about long, connecting Nyack and Tarrytown. It is crossed by the modern Tappan Zee Bridge (officially the Governor Mario M. Cuomo Bridge), which opened in 2017 (north or westbound span) and 2018 (south or eastbound span) at about the same length as the old bridge.

On September 14, 1609, the explorer Henry Hudson entered the Tappan Zee while sailing upstream from New York Harbor. At first, Hudson believed the widening of the river indicated that he had found the Northwest Passage. He proceeded upstream as far as modern Troy before concluding that no such strait existed there.

The Tappan Zee is mentioned several times in Washington Irving&#x27;s famous short story, &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.&quot; The tale is set in the vicinity of Tarrytown, in the area near Irving&#x27;s own home at Sunnyside. In Frederik Pohl&#x27;s 1977 Hugo Award-winning novel &quot;Gateway&quot;, the main character Robinette Broadhead has &quot;a summer apartment overlooking the Tappan Sea and The Palisades Dam.&quot; Pohl lived in the area while writing the book. Jazz pianist Bob James named one of the tracks from his 1977 album &quot;BJ4&quot;, in addition to his record label he founded, after the Tappan Zee.

<doc id="681602" wikidata="Q940474" url="?curid=681602" title="Syd Mead">
<text>Sydney Jay Mead (July 18, 1933 – December 30, 2019) was an American industrial designer and neo-futurist concept artist. He made designs for science-fiction films such as &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, &quot;Aliens&quot; and &quot;Tron&quot;. Mead has been described as &quot;the artist who illustrates the future&quot; and &quot;one of the most influential concept artists and industrial designers of our time.&quot;

==Life==
===Early life===
Mead was born on July 18, 1933, in Saint Paul, Minnesota. His father was a Baptist minister, who read him pulp magazines, such as &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; and &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, sparking his interest in science fiction. Mead was skilled in drawing at a young age. According to Mead, &quot;by the time I was in high school I could draw the human figure, I could draw animals, and I had a sense of shading to show shape. I was really quite accomplished at that point with brush technique and so-forth.&quot; He described himself as being an &quot;insular child.&quot; Mead graduated from high school in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in 1951. After serving a three-year enlistment in the U.S. Army, Mead attended the Art Center School in Los Angeles (now the Art Center College of Design, Pasadena), where he graduated in June 1959.

===Career===

In 1959, Mead was recruited to Ford Motor Company&#x27;s Advanced Styling Studio by Elwood Engel. From 1960 to 1961, Mead worked in Ford Motor Company Styling in Detroit, Michigan. Mead left Ford after two years to illustrate books and catalogues for companies including United States Steel, Celanese, Allis-Chalmers and Atlas Cement. In 1970, he launched Syd Mead, Inc. in Detroit with clients including Philips Electronics.

With his own company in the 1970s, Mead spent about a third of his time in Europe, primarily to provide designs and illustrations for Philips, and he continued to work for international clients. Through the 1970s and 1980s, Mead and his company provided architectural renderings, both interior and exterior, for clients including Intercontinental Hotels, 3D International, Harwood Taylor &amp; Associates, Don Ghia, Gresham &amp; Smith and Philip Koether Architects.

Beginning in 1983, Mead developed working relationships with Sony, Minolta, Dentsu, Dyflex, Tiger Corporation, Seibu, Mitsukoshi, Bandai, NHK and Honda.

Mead&#x27;s one-man shows began in 1973 with an exhibit at documenta 6 in Kassel, West Germany. His work was later exhibited in Japan, Italy, California and Spain. In 1983, Mead was invited by Chrysler Corporation to be a guest speaker to its design staff. He created a series of slides to provide visuals to the lecture, and the resulting presentation was a success. It was later expanded and enhanced with computer-generated images specifically created at the requests of several clients, including Disney, Carnegie Mellon University, Purdue University, Pratt Institute and the Society of Illustrators. In March 2010, Mead completed a four-city tour of Australia.

In 1992, he participated in the production of a TurboGrafx-CD video game, &quot;Syd Mead&#x27;s TerraForming&quot;. 

In 1993, a digital gallery consisting of 50 examples of his art with interface screens designed by him became one of the first CD-ROMs released in Japan. In 2004, Mead co-operated with Gnomon School of Visual Effects to produce a four-volume &quot;how-to&quot; DVD series titled &quot;Techniques of Syd Mead&quot;.

In 2018, Mead published his autobiography, titled &quot;A Future Remembered&quot;. Regarding his work, Mead said, &quot;the idea supersedes technique,&quot; and that &quot;I&#x27;ve called science fiction &#x27;reality ahead of schedule.&#x27;&quot;

===In film===

Mead worked with major studios on the feature films: &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;, &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, &quot;Tron&quot;, &quot;2010&quot;, &quot;Short Circuit&quot;, &quot;Aliens&quot;, &quot;Timecop&quot;, &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Elysium&quot;, &quot;Tomorrowland&quot; and &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot;. George Lucas created the AT-AT for his &quot;Star Wars&quot; saga based on art by Mead. Mead also contributed to the Japanese film &quot;Solar Crisis&quot;. In the 1990s, Mead supplied designs for two Japanese anime series, &quot;Turn A Gundam&quot; and the unfinished &quot;Yamato 2520&quot;.

In May 2007, he completed work on a documentary of his career with the director Joaquin Montalvan entitled &quot;Visual Futurist:The Art &amp; Life of Syd Mead&quot;. The short 2008 documentary film&quot; 2019: A Future Imagined,&quot; also explored his works. Mead also appears in movie documentaries such as &quot;Dangerous Days: Making Blade Runner&quot; and Mark Kermode&#x27;s &quot;On the Edge of Blade Runner&quot;, and promotional materials such as the DVD extra for &quot;Aliens&quot; and a promotional short film about the making of &quot;2010&quot;.

==Personal life==
Mead was in a relationship with Roger Servick; the couple married in 2016. They established a publishing extension, OBLAGON, Inc., in Hollywood and relocated in 1998 to Pasadena, California, where Mead continued to work.

==Death==
On December 30, 2019, Mead died in his Pasadena home at age 86, after three years of lymphoma.

<doc id="681607" wikidata="Q982891" url="?curid=681607" title="The Macallan distillery">
<text>The Macallan distillery is a Speyside single malt Scotch whisky distillery in Craigellachie in Moray in the north-east of Scotland. The Macallan Distillers Ltd is a wholly owned subsidiary of Edrington, which purchased the brand from Highland Distillers in 1999.

The Macallan is generally considered to be the second or third highest-selling single-malt scotch, next to Glenfiddich and, by some accounts, Glenlivet.

Originally, the Macallan was matured only in oak sherry casks brought to the distillery from Jerez de la Frontera, Spain. Beginning in 2004, the Macallan introduced a new main product, the Fine Oak series, with the whisky mellowed in bourbon oak casks as well as sherry ones. In 2018, the Fine Oak series was renamed as the Triple Cask Matured range.

== History ==
The Macallan distillery was founded in 1824 by Alexander Reid in Craigellachie. It was initially a farm distillery, and the Macallan name came from the Gaelic word &quot;magh&quot;, meaning &quot;fertile ground,&quot; and &quot;allan&quot;, referring to the local stream.

In 1892, the distillery was able to buy its first large copper pot still, which allowed it to increase production.

After the WWI the whisky industry was affected by Prohibition in the United States and the general global economic downturn, but Macallan continued producing Scotch whisky.

In the 1930s, Macallan began to age its whiskies for an extended period, with its 12-Year-Old distinguishing it from many competitors who relied on younger whiskies.

In 1996, Highland Distillers acquired The Macallan distillery.

In 1999, Macallan became part of the Edrington Group, a company that also owns brands like Highland Park and Glenrothes, after Edrington acquired Highland Distillers.This provided the distillery with the financial backing to expand operations further and increase production.

In 2002, Macallan released the Macallan Fine &amp; Rare Collection, a series of rare and aged whiskies from the distillery’s archives. These bottles became highly sought after by collectors.

In 2007, a bottle of 1926 the Macallan was sold at a Christie&#x27;s auction for $54,000, making it one of the most expensive bottles of whisky sold.

In 2010, a bottle of the Macallan 64-year-old single malt whisky in a one-of-a-kind &quot;Lalique: Cire Perdue&quot; crystal decanter was sold for $460,000 at an auction at Sotheby&#x27;s in New York City. All proceeds from the sale were donated to , an organization that helps provide access to clean, safe drinking water to people in developing nations. In 2012, the Macallan received the Guinness World Record for the most expensive whisky sold at auction.In 2018 Macallan’s new £140m distillery and visitor center opened. It was designed by architect Norman Foster and featured modern architecture alongside a deep integration into the history and craftsmanship of the distillery. The distillery has 36 stills, comprising 12 wash stills and 24 spirit stills. 

In July 2019, the £140 million new distillery and visitor experience, on the Easter Elchies estate near Craigellachie, made the shortlist for the Stirling Prize for excellence in architecture. It was designed by Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners. Also in 2019, the distillery won the RIAS Andrew Doolan Best Building in Scotland Award.

In October 2019, a bottle of the Macallan1926 sold at a Sotheby’s auction for £1.5 million, making it the most expensive bottle of whisky sold at that time.

In November 2023, a bottle of the Macallan1926 sold at auction for £2.1 million, making it the most expensive bottle of whisky sold.

==Bottlings==
The distillery produces a number of expressions in its core Sherry Oak series, the most generally available being the 12-year-old, although the 18-year-old is widely distributed, alongside a 10-year-old cask strength expression at 58% ABV. Expensive 25, 30 and 40-year-old versions can also be found.

In 2004, the Maccallan started to offer single malt expressions vatted with whisky matured in used casks other than ex-sherry casks as part of the Fine Oak range. Macallan also markets special scotches in duty-free shops at airports such as the 1824 Collection and the Quest Collection.

Many rare, special releases and other small production run bottlings also exist.

==Publicity and marketing==
In 2001, Michael Martin selected the Macallan 10 Years Old as the official Scotch of the Speaker of the House of Commons, even though Martin himself had given up drinking alcohol. He did smell whiskies to make his selection. This selection continued the tradition of the Speaker designating 
an official single malt. In 2003, the Macallan started laboratory tests to determine if some antique whiskies purchased for their collection were forgeries, perhaps generated by a dealer with mafia ties. In 2004, it was revealed that laboratory testing had determined at least 11 bottles in its antique whisky collection were fakes. Although the Macallan had tested the paper of the labels and were satisfied the whiskies were genuine, additional tests on the contents of some bottles revealed whisky believed to be only 10 years old. David Cox, director of fine and rare whiskies for the Macallan, said, &quot;As a result of these tests from now on, no antique bottles from the antique collection held at the distillery will be made available for sale.&quot;

== Archaeology ==
In advance of the creation of the new distillery and visitor experience, archaeological excavations were undertaken by AOC Archaeology in 2014. The archaeologists found that people had been working in the area in the Middle Bronze Age (radiocarbon dates of 1681–1503 cal BC); had built a small settlement in the Late Bronze Age (radiocarbon dates of between 1050 and 800 BC); then a single ring-ditch roundhouse in the Middle Iron Age (radiocarbon dates of 171 BC - AD 51); another small settlement between the ninth to twelfth centuries AD with two post-ring roundhouses; and a 19th century quarry. There was also some evidence (two stone tools) of people being in the area during the Mesolithic period. All of which indicates that people have been living and working on the site of the distillery for thousands of years.

<doc id="681611" wikidata="Q440297" url="?curid=681611" title="Konstantinos Kenteris">
<text>Konstantinos &quot;Kostas&quot; Kenteris, also spelled as Konstadinos &quot;Costas&quot; Kederis ( ; born July 11, 1973) is a Greek former athlete. He won gold medals in the 200 metres at the 2000 Summer Olympics, the 2001 World Championships in Athletics and the 2002 European Championships in Athletics, making him the only European sprinter (along with Linford Christie) to win the gold medal in all three major competitions and the only European World Champion in the 200 metres races. Additionally, he has won two gold, three silver and two bronze medals in the European Cup, as well as three gold medals in the 200 metres at the Athens Grand Prix Tsiklitiria. He is also a 14-time golden medalist at the Greek Athletics Championships and a five-time golden medalist at the Greek Indoor Athletics Championships. He withdrew from the 2004 Summer Olympics, held in his home country, after a doping violation (failed to attend drug test).

Kenteris was named the Greek Male Athlete of the Year three times, for the years 2000, 2001, and 2002. He was named the Best Balkan Athlete of the Year two times, for the years 2000 and 2001.

==Career==
Born in Mytilene, Kenteris, a student of physical education, started practising athletics at age 10, and started running seriously about ten years later, when he moved to Thessaloniki.

Kenteris specialised in the 200 m and 400 m. His first national titles were the three consecutive 400 m gold medals at the Greek Athletics Championships (1991 (46.90), 1992 (46.85), 1993 (46.27)) in Athens with 200 m (21.57) and 400 m (47.76) gold medals at the 1993 Greek Indoor Athletics Championships in Piraeus, representing his home town team, Arion Mytilene. He also competed at the 1992 World Junior Championships in Seoul where he finished 6th in 200 m (21.10). His first major international title was the gold medal in 400 m (45.70) at the 1993 Mediterranean Games in Narbonne. At the 1994 Greek Indoor Athletics Championships in Piraeus, he defended his 200 m (20.93) and 400 m (46.73) gold medals. He repeated his success in the 400 m (47.11) by winning gold at the 1996 Greek Indoor Athletics Championships. In 1997, Kenteris moved to Athens and Olympiacos CFP, with whom he won the 4 × 100 m relay gold (40.86) at the 1997 Greek Athletics Championships in Athens. Kenteris repeated his success the following year when he won the 400 m (45.87) and 4 × 400 m relay (3:11.95) gold medals at the 1998 Greek Athletics Championships in Athens.

It was not until 1998 that Kenteris took part in his first major international tournaments, when he took 9th place (semi finals) in both 400 m (45.74) and 4 × 400 m relay (3:06.48) at the 1998 European Championships in Budapest. He also took the 7th place at the 1998 IAAF World Cup in Johannesburg, in the 4 × 400 m relay race (3:03.95), representing the European team. In 1999, he continued by winning the 200 m (20.60) and 400 m (45.82) gold medals at the 1999 Greek Athletics Championships in Athens. His first European success was when he won the 400 m bronze medal at the 1999 European Cup in Paris with a time of 45.66. While Kenteris was eliminated in the 400 m heats of the indoor world championships, he returned that summer as a 200 m runner at the Outdoor World Championships in Seville. Kenteris won his heat # 5, defeating then 100 m world record holder Maurice Greene, but did not start the quarter-finals due to injury. The following year, Kenteris won the 4 × 100 m relay gold (40.46) at the 2000 Greek Athletics Championships in Athens, and also the 4 × 100 m relay silver (38.67) and 200 m bronze (20.48) at the 2000 European Cup in Gateshead.

Although Kenteris had established himself as a medal-winning national and European sprinter, few had heard of his name when he surprised by qualifying for the 200 m final at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. Although defending Olympic champion Michael Johnson and reigning world champion Maurice Greene did not compete, still nobody had included Kenteris in the list of medal favourites despite his being the fastest European at 200 m that summer with 20.25 seconds from June, but Kenteris raced to the gold medal with a time of 20.09, denying Britain&#x27;s Darren Campbell and Ato Boldon of Trinidad and Tobago. In doing so, Kenteris became the first white male to win a 200 m sprinting medal at the Olympics since Pietro Mennea achieved the feat, winning the 200 m gold at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. He also competed in the 4 × 100 m relay qualifying, but failed to reach the finals and took ninth place in 38.80 seconds.

In 2001, Kenteris won his first gold medal in 100 m (10.21) at the 2001 Greek Athletics Championships in Athens. Success continued, as Kenteris won his first 200 m gold medal (20.31) and the silver medal in 100 m (10.15 PB) at the 2001 European Cup in Bremen, and 200 m gold at the 2001 Athens Grand Prix Tsiklitiria with a performance of 20.10. He also won the 200 m title (20.04) at the 2001 World Championships in Edmonton after a season where he mostly stayed out of international competition. The following year, he won the 200 m (20.18) and 4 × 400 m relay (3:14.48) gold medals at the 2002 Greek Athletics Championships in Trikala. Kenteris completed his trilogy by also winning the European title at the 2002 European Athletics Championships in Munich with a time of 19.85, his personal best. This performance still stands as the national record in 200 m. The next year, Kenteris took part in the 2003 European Cup in Florence where he won the 200 m gold (20.37) and 4 × 400 m relay silver (3:02.69). Upon returning in Athens, he won the 200 m gold (20.30) at the 2003 Athens Grand Prix Tsiklitiria.

For the 2004 Summer Olympics, Kenteris was one of the hopes of the home crowd for winning a gold medal in athletics and favourite to light the Olympic flame, as he had won the 100 m (10.18) and 4 × 100 m relay (41.16) gold medals at the 2004 Greek Championship in Athens and the 200 m gold (20.27) at the 2004 Athens Grand Prix Tsiklitiria, just one month before the Summer Olympics. However, on the day prior to the Games, Kenteris and his training partner Ekaterini Thanou failed to attend a drug test. While they claimed to have been injured in a motorcycle accident – in a frantic attempt to return to the Olympic village for the test upon hearing the news in the media – an official Greek investigation would later find that the alleged accident had been staged. In the ensuing doping scandal, Kenteris and Thanou announced their withdrawal from the Games on August 18, after a hearing before the Disciplinary Commission of the IOC, for what they described to be &quot;in the interests of the country&quot;.

Kenteris retired from athletics and disappeared from the public eye following his withdrawal. After his retirement, Kenteris was offered an honorary officer position in the Hellenic Air Force by the Greek state, but he quit in 2011. In May 2011 he was (along with Thanou) given a suspended jail sentence of 31 months, after being charged with staging the crash, but an appeals court overturned this ruling. The World Athletics has banned him from entering the stadiums, as evidence was found that his coach was also involved in the BALCO scandal.

== Personal bests ==

As of August 2024, his 200m time is also the track record for Munich.

<text>Skeiðará () is a relatively short glacier river (about 30 km long). It has its source on the glacier Skeiðarárjökull, one of the southern arms of the Vatnajökull in the south of Iceland.

In spite of its short length, this river has a bad reputation. It is especially feared because of the frequent glacier runs that can be fatal.

In front of Skaftafell and Skeiðarárjökull, Skeiðará has formed the Skeiðarársandur, a black plain of lava sand and ashes crossed by a lot of small rivulets which covers the whole area between the park and the sea (about 40 km long and 5 to 10 km wide). In 1996, the latest of these glacier runs took place. It destroyed parts of Route 1 (the Ring Road). The bridge was damaged by floating ice boulders the size of houses. At the peak of this glacier run, 45,000 m3/s of water were coming down. No one was harmed, scientists having very carefully monitored the volcano Grímsvötn on Vatnajökull which caused the glacier run by its eruption.

<text>McFadden and Whitehead were an American R&amp;B duo, best known for their signature tune &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Stoppin&#x27; Us Now&quot;. They wrote and produced some of the most popular R&amp;B hits of the 1970s, and were primarily associated with the Gamble and Huff record label, Philadelphia International Records.

==Early career==
As teenagers, Gene McFadden and John Whitehead met at school in 1960s Philadelphia and formed a group called The Epsilons. The personnel included Allen Beatty, James Knight, and future Blue Notes member Lloyd Parks. When Otis Redding came to Philadelphia, The Epsilons were invited to become part of his revue. They toured with him during the late 1960s until Redding&#x27;s death in a plane crash in 1967. They signed a small record deal with Stax Records on the back of this opportunity and had a moderate success in 1970 with &quot;The Echo&quot;. 

After the departure of Lloyd Parks to Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes, Gene and John changed their name to Talk of the Town and worked with Gamble/Huff who groomed their talents on their North Bay label. Discovering their abilities for writing and producing, Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff employed McFadden &amp; Whitehead at their Philadelphia International Records (PIR) label through the 1970s, collaborating with them at first on &#x27;I&#x27;ll Always Love My Mama&#x27; for The Intruders. While at the label, their songs and/or productions were used by the O&#x27;Jays on their hit &quot;Back Stabbers&quot; in 1972 (which reached #3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and #1 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Hot Soul Singles chart), and Archie Bell &amp; the Drells for hits &quot;Let&#x27;s Groove&quot;, &quot;The Soul City Walk&quot;, &quot;Strategy&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Love Get You Down&quot;.

McFadden and Whitehead also wrote songs such as &quot;Bad Luck&quot;, &quot;Wake Up Everybody&quot;, &quot;Prayin&#x27;&quot; (on the Source label), and &quot;Where Are All My Friends&quot; for Harold Melvin &amp; The Blue Notes, as well as &quot;The More I Get, The More I Want&quot;, and &quot;Cold, Cold World&quot; for Teddy Pendergrass, and &quot;Just Got To Be More Careful&quot; for Carolyn Crawford. A number of these songs were written in collaboration with their associate Victor Carstaphen. 

The production team also worked with fellow producer Rahni Song and with artists Melba Moore, Freddie Jackson, Gloria Gaynor, Gladys Knight, The Jackson 5, James Brown, Stevie Wonder, Lou Rawls, Willie Collins, Jerry Bell and Beau Williams.

==Rise to stardom==
McFadden and Whitehead formed together as a group officially under the name &quot;McFadden &amp; Whitehead&quot; in 1977. The pinnacle of their success came in 1979 with dancefloor anthem &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Stoppin&#x27; Us Now&quot;, from their eponymously named album, which went to #1 on the R&amp;B charts, #13 on the pop charts, sold eight million records worldwide and was nominated for a Grammy Award. (Two more versions of the song were released back-to-back in 1981 - The Philadelphia Phillies version and The Philadelphia Eagles version, on the label&#x27;s T.S.O.P. subsidiary). After leaving PIR, they re-recorded &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Stoppin&#x27; Us Now&quot; as &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Stoppin&#x27; (Ain&#x27;t No Way)&quot; for the Sutra label in New York (1984) and worked on some individual projects. The duo was featured on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, where they sang their most famous song on an episode in which Oprah featured the top hits of the 1970s.

Hits co-written/produced by McFadden &amp; Whitehead include:
* &quot;Back Stabbers&quot; (the O&#x27;Jays)
* &quot;Bad Luck&quot; (Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes)
* &quot;Wake Up Everybody&quot; (Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes)

* &quot;All the Man You Need&quot; (Jerry Bell)

According to the &quot;American Top 40&quot; radio program for the week ended August 4, 1979, Casey Kasem reported that McFadden and Whitehead were in Chicago on May 25, 1979, promoting their music and doing various interviews. Because they agreed to do one more music interview at the last minute, they decided to reschedule their flight to Los Angeles to the next day, May 26. They were originally scheduled to fly on American Airlines Flight 191 on May 25, which crashed shortly after takeoff from O&#x27;Hare International Airport, killing all 258 passengers plus the crew.

==Deaths==
On May 11, 2004, Whitehead was murdered on the street outside of his Philadelphia home studio, while standing aside as a young man made repairs on his SUV. There, he was shot once by one of several unknown gunmen, who then fled. Whitehead was 55 years old. As of 2022, the murder remains unsolved. 

On January 27, 2006, McFadden died of liver and lung cancer. He was 56.

<text>The Slovakia national football team () represents Slovakia in men&#x27;s international football competition and it is governed by the Slovak Football Association (SFZ), the governing body for football in Slovakia. Slovakia&#x27;s home stadium from 2019 is the reconstructed Tehelné pole in Bratislava. Historically, up to the split in 1993, the team participated mostly as Czechoslovakia, while it also competed as Slovakia during Second World War.

Since 1993, Slovakia has qualified for four major international tournaments: the 2010 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 2016, UEFA Euro 2020, and UEFA Euro 2024. Slovakia qualified for the former tournament after winning their qualifying group, where they progressed beyond the group stage after a 3–2 victory against Italy, before bowing out of the tournament following a 2–1 defeat in the knockout stage against the eventual runners-up Netherlands. It was the first time the newly-independent national team had ever played in a major football competition, having played in every FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign since 1998 and every UEFA European Championship qualifying campaign since 1996. Slovakia came close to secure a berth at the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany after finishing second in their group ahead of Russia and behind Portugal, before drawing with Spain in their qualification play-off, in which the Slovaks lost by a wide margin on aggregate (1–5, 1–1).

==History==
===Slovak Republic and Czechoslovakia===

The first official match of the first Slovak Republic was played in Bratislava against Germany on 27 August 1939, and ended in a 2–0 victory for Slovakia. The Slovaks played numerous friendly matches during the Second World War, all against Axis-aligned nations.

After the Second World War, the national football team was subsumed into the team of Czechoslovakia, and for over 50 years Slovakia played no matches as an independent country. During this period, they contributed several key players to the Czechoslovak team, including the majority of the team that won the UEFA Euro 1976 (eight of the eleven players who defeated West Germany in the final were Slovak).

===1994–present: Slovakia===
Slovakia&#x27;s first official international after regaining independence was a 1–0 victory in Dubai over the United Arab Emirates on 2 February 1994. Their first home match was a 4–1 victory against Croatia in Bratislava on 20 April 1994. Slovakia suffered their biggest defeat since independence (6–0) on 22 June 1995 in Mendoza against Argentina. Their biggest victories (7–0) have come against Liechtenstein in 2004 as well as San Marino (twice) in 2007 and 2009.

Slovakia attempted qualifying for a major championship as an independent team for the first time in Euro 1996 qualifying, but finished in third place in their qualifying group, behind Romania and France, recording wins against Poland, Israel and Azerbaijan, twice. In the 1998 World Cup qualifiers, Slovakia finished fourth in their six-team group with five wins, one draw, and four defeats. Their first four games in this were all wins, one of them against their Czech neighbors, helping the team reach their highest FIFA World Ranking to date, 17th.

====2010 FIFA World Cup====

Slovakia participated in the FIFA World Cup for the first time as an independent nation after finishing in first in Group 3 of 2010 World Cup qualification ahead of Slovenia, Czech Republic, Northern Ireland, and Poland. On 14 October 2009, they clinched qualification with a 1–0 away victory against Poland. On 24 June 2010, at the tournament proper, Slovakia finished second in the group stage after defeating reigning champions Italy in a game which ESPN dubbed &quot;epic&quot;: the game saw three goals being scored after the 80th minute, two by Italy and one by Slovakia, as well as a disallowed goal by Italy flagged offside by &quot;the tightest of decisions&quot;. The result led Slovakia to the knockout stage and eliminated Italy, who finished last in the group. The result of this match meant that for the first time in World Cup history, both finalists from the previous tournament had been eliminated in the first round, champion Italy and runner-up France.

In the round of 16, Slovakia played the Netherlands in the round of 16, falling behind 2–0 only to score a late goal from the penalty spot by striker Róbert Vittek, the last kick of the game in a 2–1 defeat. Despite elimination, Vittek&#x27;s goal returned to the top of the goalscoring charts joint top with David Villa until Villa himself later scored against Portugal in Spain&#x27;s 1–0 victory in the same stage of the tournament.

====UEFA Euro 2012====
In the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying, Slovakia was drawn against Russia, the Republic of Ireland, Armenia, Macedonia and Andorra. The campaign in South Africa boosted team performance ahead of the qualifiers, which started in September with two 1–0 wins against Macedonia at Štadión Pasienky and Russia away. However, in October, they were easily beaten in Armenia (3–1) and drew 1–1 against the Republic of Ireland at home. In February 2011, the team was stunned in a 2–1 friendly defeat against Luxembourg and could only beat group minnows Andorra by one goal. Despite creating better chances, Slovakia earned a goalless draw with Ireland away. Four days later, after creating chances in a goalless first half, Slovakia conceded four goals to Armenia in a match that eliminated the team. In the final two group matches, Slovakia was beaten at home by Russia (1–0) and drew 1–1 in Macedonia, finishing in a mediocre fourth-place position and scoring only seven goals in the entire process. For the first time since the Euro 1996 qualifying process, Slovakia finished a qualifying campaign with a negative goal differential. As a result of this outcome, coach Vladimír Weiss left his job after four full years, being replaced by his assistants Michal Hipp and Stanislav Griga, although both themselves were later replaced due to poor results.

By late June, former Czechoslovakia national team footballer Ján Kozák became the head coach after the unsuccessful qualifying campaign with a victory in Bosnia and Herzegovina followed by two defeats to Bosnia and Greece.

====UEFA Euro 2016====

In the UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying, Slovakia was drawn against Spain, Ukraine, Belarus, Macedonia and Luxembourg. Slovakia began the qualifying campaign with a 1–0 victory against Ukraine in Kyiv. On 9 October 2014, Slovakia beat Spain 2–1 in a shock victory and claimed the first place. Slovakia&#x27;s 3–1 victory over Belarus confirmed their status as group leaders. Later on, they won 2–0 against Macedonia in the Philip II Arena, beat Luxembourg with a score of 3–0 in Žilina, and beat Macedonia 2–1 on 14 June 2015, also in Žilina. The next matches were a 2–0 defeat against Spain, a goalless draw against Ukraine, and a shocking 0–1 home defeat against Belarus. Slovakia finished qualification by defeating Luxembourg 4–2 and got the second place, qualifying to their fourth European Championship, first as an independent nation.

Slovakia was drawn in Group B of Euro 2016 alongside England, Russia, and Wales. Slovakia began their tournament against Wales where Ondrej Duda scored Slovakia&#x27;s first goal in the history of the European Championship in an eventual 2–1 defeat. Slovakia defeated Russia 2–1 with goals from Vladimír Weiss III and Marek Hamšík, then a goalless draw against England to advance to the round of 16 as one of the tournament&#x27;s best third-placed teams. They were eliminated at this stage by 2014 FIFA World Cup champion Germany with a 3–0 defeat.

====2018 FIFA World Cup qualification====
During the qualification campaign for the 2018 World Cup, Slovakia was drawn in UEFA Group F. They were third in the group after the penultimate match ended in a 1–0 defeat to Scotland, who moved up to second place. Slovakia won their final group match 3–0 against Malta, and overtook Scotland after they failed to beat Slovenia, but they missed out on a play-off place as the other second teams&#x27; results went against them, meaning Slovakia finished as the worst group runners-up.

====UEFA Euro 2020====
Slovakia qualified for the UEFA Euro 2020 after a difficult away victory against Northern Ireland. Being drawn with Spain, Sweden. and Poland in group E, Slovakia beat Poland 2–1. However, Slovakia subsequently lost to Sweden 0–1 before getting thrashed by Spain 5–0, thus finishing third with the worst goal difference due to scoring own goals as a result of their performance. Slovakia was eliminated in the group stage for the first time ever.

====2022 FIFA World Cup qualification====
The country finished third in 2022 World Cup qualifying behind Croatia and Russia, the latter of which would be banned from the final tournament due to the country&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine. Despite the third-place finish in the group, the team dropped points to footballing minnows Cyprus and Malta.

====UEFA Euro 2024====
After numerous poor results in the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying, former Napoli coach Francesco Calzona was appointed as the manager on 30 August 2022. This meant Slovakia was placed as low as the fifth pot for the qualifying phase of the tournament, the worst position the country has ever been in and realistically must qualify directly for UEFA Euro 2024. Slovakia was drawn into a group with Portugal, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iceland, Luxembourg, and Liechtenstein. After a poor goalless draw in the first match against Luxembourg, the team won seven and lost two matches in total, both being narrow losses against Portugal (0–1 at home and 3–2 away). As a result, Slovakia qualified automatically for Euro 2024 by finishing second in their qualifying group.

The team was drawn in Group E of Euro 2024, together with Belgium, Ukraine, and Romania. In Frankfurt on 17 June, Slovakia produced one of the biggest shocks in the history of the tournament by beating Belgium 1–0.

Slovakia eventually progressed to the knockout stage of the tournament. In the round of 16, they faced eventual runner-up England and lost 2-1 in extra time. Ivan Schranz became the joint-UEFA European Football Championship Top Goalscorer of Euro 2024.

==Stadium==
The Slovakia national football team plays its home matches at the Tehelné pole in Bratislava and the Štadión Antona Malatinského in Trnava. Štadión pod Dubňom in Žilina was used from 2003 to 2015, but cannot be used because of artificial grass installation in 2016. In the past, home games have occasionally been played at other venues including Všešportový areál and Štadión Lokomotívy in Košice, Štadión pod Zoborom in Nitra, Mestský štadión in Dubnica nad Váhom, and Tatran Stadion in Prešov.

==Team image==
===Nickname===
The team is typically referred to as the &quot;Repre&quot; (short for &quot;Reprezentácia&quot;, which translates into &quot;national team&quot;). However, in 2016, during the buildup to Slovakia&#x27;s first appearance at the European Championship, Slovak Football Association introduced a new nickname for the team. The national team was given the nickname &quot;Slovenskí sokoli&quot; (). The U15 to U21 national teams were given the nickname &quot;Slovenskí sokolíci&quot; (). Despite a lack of immediate identification with the nickname by the fans, it went into usage during the tournament and the subsequent qualification for the 2018 World Cup and is now often used, especially in the media, along with &quot;Repre&quot;, which still remains to be preferred in an informal conversation.

===Kit===

Slovakia&#x27;s home kit since 1993 has been blue, which was temporarily changed from blue to white from 2020. The players were either a set of white jerseys, shorts, and socks – or a set of blue jerseys, shorts and socks. A combination of a blue jersey and white shorts has also been used in some matches. In 2016, Slovak Football Association announced that the contract with Puma been terminated and national team was supplied by Nike, which had previously did so from 1995 to 2005.

<doc id="681622" wikidata="Q4669835" url="?curid=681622" title="Absolute theory">
<text>In philosophy, absolute theory (or absolutism) usually refers to a theory based on concepts (such as the concept of space) that exist independently of other concepts and objects. The absolute point of view was advocated in physics by Isaac Newton. It is one of the traditional views of space along with relational theory and the Kantian theory.

== Overview ==
According to the absolute theory of space, it is a homogeneous structure which exists and is independent of other things. The Newtonian arguments of this theory, particularly those concerned with the ontological status of space and time, had been related to the existence of God through the concepts of absolute space and absolute time. It was proposed that the universe was finite in extent and was said to have begun in time. Additionally, space exists prior to the body or matter that occupies it and it was held that the universe – as a finite object – is situated within it.

The theory was also promoted by Newton&#x27;s followers including Samuel Clarke and Roger Cotes during the 17th and 18th centuries.

== Related theories ==
An absolute theory is the opposite of a relational theory. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, the main proponent of relational theory, argued that there is no absolute space and time. He maintained that space is not independent nor a container of the matter that occupies it, explaining that physical objects or forces are ordered spatially and that space is merely a system of relations. According to the relational theory, without objects, there is no space.

Martin Heidegger&#x27;s theory of space also opposes the absolute theory, with the criticism that it is founded on metaphysical dichotomy of separated subject and object. He maintained that this nature keeps absolute theory from explaining the true nature of space.

<doc id="681625" wikidata="Q25303603" url="?curid=681625" title="Group-velocity dispersion">
<text>In optics, group-velocity dispersion (GVD) is a characteristic of a dispersive medium, used most often to determine how the medium affects the duration of an optical pulse traveling through it. Formally, GVD is defined as the derivative of the inverse of group velocity of light in a material with respect to angular frequency,
: formula_1
where formula_2 and formula_3 are angular frequencies, and the group velocity formula_4 is defined as formula_5. The units of group-velocity dispersion are [time]2/[distance], often expressed in fs2/mm.

Equivalently, group-velocity dispersion can be defined in terms of the medium-dependent wave vector formula_6 according to
: formula_7
or in terms of the refractive index formula_8 according to
: formula_9

==Applications==

Group-velocity dispersion is most commonly used to estimate the amount of chirp that will be imposed on a pulse of light after passing through a material of interest:
: formula_10

===Derivation===

A simple illustration of how GVD can be used to determine pulse chirp can be seen by looking at the effect of a transform-limited pulse of duration formula_11 passing through a planar medium of thickness &quot;d&quot;. Before passing through the medium, the phase offsets of all frequencies are aligned in time, and the pulse can be described as a function of time,
: formula_12
or equivalently, as a function of frequency,
: formula_13
(the parameters &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are normalization constants).
Passing through the medium results in a frequency-dependent phase accumulation formula_14, such that the post-medium pulse can be described by 
: formula_15

In general, the refractive index formula_8, and therefore the wave vector formula_17, can be an arbitrary function of formula_2, making it difficult to analytically perform the inverse Fourier transform back into the time domain. However, if the bandwidth of the pulse is narrow relative to the curvature of formula_19, then good approximations of the impact of the refractive index can be obtained by replacing formula_6 with its Taylor expansion centered about formula_3:
: formula_22

Truncating this expression and inserting it into the post-medium frequency-domain expression results in a post-medium time-domain expression
: formula_23

On balance, the pulse is lengthened to an intensity standard deviation value of
: formula_24
thus validating the initial expression. Note that a transform-limited pulse has formula_25, which makes it appropriate to identify 1/(2&quot;σt&quot;) as the bandwidth.

===Alternate derivation===

An alternate derivation of the relationship between pulse chirp and GVD, which more immediately illustrates the reason why GVD can be defined by the derivative of inverse group velocity, can be outlined as follows. Consider two transform-limited pulses of carrier frequencies formula_26 and formula_27, which are initially overlapping in time. After passing through the medium, these two pulses will exhibit a time delay between their respective pulse-envelope centers, given by 
: formula_28
The expression can be approximated as a Taylor expansion, giving 
: formula_29
or
: formula_30
From here it is possible to imagine scaling this expression up two pulses to infinitely many. The frequency difference formula_31 must be replaced by the bandwidth, and the time delay formula_32 evolves into the induced chirp.

==Group-delay dispersion==

A closely related yet independent quantity is the group-delay dispersion (GDD), defined such that group-velocity dispersion is the group-delay dispersion per unit length. GDD is commonly used as a parameter in characterizing layered mirrors, where the group-velocity dispersion is not particularly well-defined, yet the chirp induced after bouncing off the mirror can be well-characterized. The units of group-delay dispersion are [time]2, often expressed in fs2.

The group-delay dispersion (GDD) of an optical element is the derivative of the group delay with respect to angular frequency, and also the second derivative of the optical phase:
: formula_33
It is a measure of the chromatic dispersion of the element. GDD is related to the total dispersion parameter formula_34 as
: formula_35

<doc id="681626" wikidata="Q157974" url="?curid=681626" title="Glenmorangie distillery">
<text>Glenmorangie distillery (pronounced with the stress on the second syllable: ; the toponym is believed to derive from either Gaelic &quot;Gleann Mòr na Sìth&quot; &quot;vale of tranquillity&quot; or &quot;Gleann Mór-innse&quot; &quot;vale of big meadows&quot;) is a distillery in Tain, Ross-shire, Scotland, that produces single malt Scotch whisky. 

The distillery is owned by The Glenmorangie Company Ltd (a subsidiary of Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy), whose main product is the range of Glenmorangie single malt whisky. Glenmorangie is categorised as a Highland distillery and boasts the tallest stills in Scotland. It is available in Original, 18-, and 25-year-old bottlings, special cask bottlings, cask finishes, extra matured bottlings, and a range of special edition bottlings.

==History==
Legends tell that alcoholic beverages of one kind or another were produced in and around Tain since the Middle Ages.

According to the Glenmorangie Company, the earliest record of the production of alcohol at Morangie Farm is dated 1703. In the 1730s a brewery was built on the site that shared the farm&#x27;s water source, the Tarlogie Spring. A former distillery manager, William Matheson, acquired the farm in 1843 and converted the Morangie brewery to a distillery, equipped with two-second hand gin stills. He later renamed the distillery &quot;Glen&quot;morangie.

The distillery was purchased by its main customer, the Leith firm Macdonald and Muir, in 1918. The Macdonald family would retain control of the company for almost 90 years.

Glenmorangie, like all distilleries and breweries in Britain, suffered terribly between 1920 and 1950, with Prohibition and then the Great Depression in the United States reducing whisky sales. The distillery was effectively between 1931 and 1936. The depression ended with World War II, but the war effort left fuel and barley in short supply and the distillery was again mothballed between 1941 and 1944. Exports of whisky were important during the war, but enemy action disrupted and destroyed deliveries to the United States and Canada.

Towards the end of the war and in the immediate post-war period, the distillery increased production and was running at full capacity by 1948. The number of stills was increased from two to four during 1977. Water supply became a concern during the 1980s when development of the land around the Tarlogie Springs seemed likely. Development could have reduced the quality and quantity of water available to the distillery, so the decision was made to purchase around of land around and including the Tarlogie Springs. The distillery once again engaged in expansion during 1990 when it added a further four stills, and two additional fermentation vessels (or &quot;washbacks&quot;) were added during 2002. Four new stills were added in 2009, bringing the total to twelve.

The Macdonald family retained ownership of 52% of the company through a complicated London stock exchange listing which saw the family hold the majority of the voting shares in the company. In 2004, the company was sold to the French drinks company Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton for around £300 million.

Following the change of ownership, the Glenmorangie product line was rebranded to increase its appeal in the overseas luxury goods market. A new, more curvaceous, bottle was introduced and the Wood Finish whiskies were given new names such as The Quinta Ruban, Nectar d&#x27;Or and LaSanta. According to Professor Paul Freathy, the director of the Institute of Retail Studies at the University of Stirling, &quot;The French-sounding names are an unusual innovation, because what makes whisky unique is the traditional tie to Scotland. It&#x27;s a brave strategy.&quot;

For some years, The Glenmorangie Company supplied its whisky for the production of &quot;own brand&quot; blended whisky by supermarket groups. The practice ceased in 2009 when it sold off the Glen Moray brand.

Glenmorangie has been the best selling single malt in Scotland almost continuously since 1983, and produces around 10 million bottles per annum, of which 6 to 6.5 million are sold in the UK. Globally, Glenmorangie has a 6% share of the single malt market.

==Production==

Glenmorangie&#x27;s water source is the Tarlogie Springs, situated in the Tarlogie Hills above the distillery. Barley grain is supplied by Highland Grain Ltd, a co-operative of farmers in the area. The stills used, the tallest in Scotland at tall, with necks, are claimed by the company to produce an extremely light taste. The distillation process was for decades undertaken by a staff of 16, known as &quot;The Sixteen Men of Tain&quot;, who worked year round, with the exceptions of Christmas and periods of maintenance. Expansion of production since 2008 has led to a larger staff of 24, who are now referred to on bottles and in promotional leaflets just as &quot;The Men of Tain&quot;.
Glenmorangie uses a number of different cask types, with all products being matured in white oak casks which are manufactured from trees growing in Glenmorangie&#x27;s own forest in the Ozark Mountains of Missouri, United States. These new casks are left to air for two years before being leased to distillers Jack Daniel&#x27;s and Heaven Hill for them to mature bourbon in for four years. Glenmorangie then uses the barrels to mature their spirit. The &quot;Original&quot; range will mature entirely in ex-bourbon casks, while the &quot;Extra Matured&quot; range of bottlings are transferred into casks that were previously used to mature other products such as wine, port or sherry in a process called finishing. These form part of the regular range of products Glenmorangie makes. Glenmorangie also obtains small batches of other casks for finishing and release limited edition bottlings from these. Following acquisition by LVMH, Glenmorangie produced a rare limited edition aged in casks previously used to mature Château Margaux; these bottlings are now (2011) extremely hard to find and are priced accordingly.

The warehouses in which the casks are stored are also believed to affect the taste of the whisky. Glenmorangie have released a special edition bottling titled &quot;Cellar 13&quot;, which is from the warehouse closest to the sea, as the whisky is believed to have a distinctive flavour.

Bottling of the Glenmorangie and Ardbeg brands takes place at The Glenmorangie Company&#x27;s purpose-built bottling plant in The Alba Campus at Livingston, West Lothian, just outside Edinburgh, Scotland. Glenmorangie previously bottled Drambuie in a joint venture with the Drambuie Company; this arrangement ended in 2010.

<text>Hlöðskviða (also Hlǫðskviða and Hlǫðsqviða), known in English as The Battle of the Goths and Huns and occasionally known by its German name Hunnenschlachtlied, is an Old Norse heroic poem found in &quot;Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks&quot;. Many attempts have been made to try to fit it with known history, but it is an epic poem, telescoping and fictionalising history to a large extent; some verifiable historical information from the time are place names, surviving in Old Norse forms from the period 750–850, but it was probably collected later in Västergötland.

Most scholars place the tale sometime in the 4th and 5th centuries AD, with the battle taking place somewhere either in Central Europe near the Carpathian Mountains, or further east in European Russia.

==Texts, historicity, and analysis==

There are two main sources for the saga, &quot;H&quot;, from the &quot;Hauksbók&quot; (A.M. 544) early 14th century; and &quot;R&quot;, a 15th-century parchment (MS 2845). The final parts of the saga including &quot;Hlöðskviða&quot; are absent in H and truncated in R – the remainder of the text is found in better preserved 17th-century paper copies of these works.

The poem itself is thought to have originally been a stand-alone work, separate from the saga. It has several analogues, containing similar or related content, including the English &quot;Widsith&quot;, as well as &quot;Orvar-Odd&#x27;s Saga&quot; and the &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;.

The historicity of the &quot;Battle of the Goths and Huns&quot;, including the identification of people, places, and events, has been a matter of scholarly investigation since the 19th century, with no clear answer. Locations proposed for the setting include a number of places around the Carpathian Mountains; the actual battle has been identified as either the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains (451 AD), between Flavius Aetius and the Visigoths under Theodoric I and the Huns under Attila; or a battle between the Gothic king Ostrogotha and the Gepid king Fastida; or a battle between the Langobards and the Vulgares (Bulgars) in which the Lombard king Agelmundus (Agelmund) was killed; or a post-Attila (d. 453) conflict between the Gepids and Huns, possibly during the reign of the Gepid Ardaric; another interpretation makes the Goths the Crimean Goths. The battle has alternatively been placed as early as 386 AD, a destruction of peoples under Odotheus in a battle on the River Danube. Similarities between the story in the saga and the Battle of Nedao have also been noted. The identification of persons in the poem with historical figures is equally confused. Additionally any historical date of the &quot;Battle of Goths and Huns&quot; (whatever the exact attribution to historical events) is several centuries earlier than the supposedly preceding events recorded in the saga.

==Text==
The poem is preserved as 29 separate strophes or parts of strophes interspersed among the text in &quot;Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks&quot;, of which most are narrative not speech. Much of the saga is now in prose form, though it is thought that the original had been verse, with some textual evidence in the prose for a verse original. Christopher Tolkien supposes that it originally formed a complete narrative in itself, outside of the context it is now found in the saga.

Some damaged verses were recorded differently by different editors, and the text shows signs of different dates of composition or recording in different parts of the text – including rich verses similar to those found in early eddaic poems such as &quot;Atlakviða&quot; or &quot;Hamðismál&quot;, whilst other lines are less rich.

Most editions number the stanzas, but the numbering may start from the first poetic stanza in the saga, not the poem.

===Extracts===
Heiðrekr, king of the Goths, had two sons, Angantýr and Hlöðr. Only Angantýr was legitimate, so he inherited his father&#x27;s kingdom. Hlöðr, whose mother was the daughter of Humli, king of the Huns, and who was born and raised among the Huns, claimed half the inheritance, Angantýr refused to split evenly and war ensued, claiming first Hervör, their sister, then Hlöðr himself as casualties.

The first verses frame peoples and their rulers. It is noteworthy that the Geats (&quot;Gautar&quot;) and their king Gizurr have been inserted directly after the Huns, where one logically would expect the Goths and their king Angantyr to appear.

Valdar is also named as a king of the Danes in &quot;Guðrúnarkviða II&quot;.

After Heiðrekr&#x27;s death, Hlöðr travels to Árheimar to claim half of the Gothic realm as his inheritance. His demand refers to the forest on the boundary separating the Goths and the Huns and to a &quot;holy grave&quot;, apparently an important sanctuary of the Goths, but its background is unknown.
Angantýr offers Hlöðr a third of his realm, and Gizur, Heiðrekr&#x27;s old foster-father, says that this is more than enough for the son of a slave. On Hlöðr&#x27;s return to the Hunnic realm, his grandfather Humli is enraged at the insult and gathers the army of the Huns.

The poem ends with Angantýr finding his brother dead:

<text>Quasinormal modes (QNM) are the modes of energy dissipation of a perturbed object or field, &quot;i.e.&quot; they describe perturbations of a field that decay in time.

==Example==
A familiar example is the perturbation (gentle tap) of a wine glass with a knife: the glass begins to ring, it rings with a set, or superposition, of its natural frequencies — its modes of sonic energy dissipation. One could call these modes &quot;normal&quot; if the glass went on ringing forever. Here the amplitude of oscillation decays in time, so we call its modes &quot;quasi-normal&quot;. To a high degree of accuracy, quasinormal ringing can be approximated by

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the amplitude of oscillation,
formula_3 is the frequency, and
formula_4 is the decay rate. The quasinormal
frequency is described by two numbers,

:formula_5

or, more compactly

:formula_6

:formula_7

Here, formula_8 is what is commonly referred to as the
quasinormal mode frequency. It is a complex number with two pieces of information: real part is the temporal oscillation; imaginary part is the temporal, exponential decay.

In certain cases the amplitude of the wave decays quickly, to follow the decay for a longer time one may plot formula_9


==Mathematical physics==
In theoretical physics, a quasinormal mode is a formal solution of linearized differential equations (such as the linearized equations of general relativity constraining perturbations around a black hole solution) with a complex eigenvalue (frequency).

Black holes have many quasinormal modes (also: ringing modes) that describe the exponential decrease of asymmetry of the black hole in time as it evolves towards the perfect spherical shape.

Recently, the properties of quasinormal modes have been tested in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. Also, the asymptotic behavior of quasinormal modes was proposed to be related to the Immirzi parameter in loop quantum gravity, but convincing arguments have not been found yet.

==Electromagnetism and photonics==
There are essentially two types of resonators in optics. In the first type, a high-Q factor optical microcavity is achieved with lossless dielectric optical materials, with mode volumes of the order of a cubic wavelength, essentially limited by the diffraction limit. Famous examples of high-Q microcavities are micropillar cavities, microtoroid resonators, photonic-crystal cavities. In the second type of resonators, the characteristic size is well below the diffraction limit, routinely by 2-3 orders of magnitude. In such small volumes, energies are stored for a small period of time. A plasmonic nanoantenna supporting a localized surface plasmon quasinormal mode essentially behaves as a poor antenna that radiates energy rather than stores it. Thus, as the optical mode becomes deeply sub-wavelength in all three dimensions, independent of its shape, the Q-factor is limited to about 10 or less.

Formally, the resonances (i.e., the quasinormal mode) of an open (non-Hermitian) electromagnetic micro or nanoresonators are all found by solving the time-harmonic source-free Maxwell’s equations with a complex frequency, the real part being the resonance frequency and the imaginary part the damping rate. The damping is due to energy loses via leakage (the resonator is coupled to the open space surrounding it) and/or material absorption. Quasinormal-mode solvers exist to efficiently compute and normalize all kinds of modes of plasmonic nanoresonators and photonic microcavities. The proper normalisation of the mode leads to the important concept of mode volume of non-Hermitian (open and lossy) systems. The mode volume directly impact the physics of the interaction of light and electrons with optical resonance, e.g. the local density of electromagnetic states, Purcell effect, cavity perturbation theory, strong interaction with quantum emitters, superradiance.

==Biophysics==

In computational biophysics, quasinormal modes, also called quasiharmonic modes, are derived from diagonalizing the matrix of equal-time correlations of atomic fluctuations.
