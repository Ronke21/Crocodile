<text>Sylvain Salnave (; February 6, 1827 – January 15, 1870) was a Haitian general who served as the President of Haïti from 1867 to 1869. He was elected president after he led the overthrow of President Fabre Geffrard. During his term there were constant civil wars between the various factions. Eventually, he was overthrown in a coup by his eventual successor Nissage Saget, and Salnave was tried for treason and executed.

==Early life and career==
Salnave, a light-skinned mulatto, was born in Cap-Haïtien in 1827. He enlisted in the Haitian Army in 1850. He was captain of cavalry when Fabre Geffrard overthrew Faustin Soulouque in January 1859, and was rewarded for his aid with the rank of major. In 1861, Salnave was bitter in his denunciation of Geffrard for what he called Geffrard&#x27;s subserviency in the matter of the Spanish regime in neighboring Dominican Republic. Geffrard, whose popularity began to decline, was powerless to punish Salnave. Salnave promoted and encouraged frequent insurrections on the borders, and in 1864 he abetted an insurrection in the northern part of Haiti, but the movement was put down with the aid of the Spanish. In July 1866, Salnave led a new uprising at Gonaïves. Although he was again defeated, the revolt continued to increase. Geffrard resigned the presidency on March 13, 1867, and left for Jamaica, where he spent the remainder of his life.

==President of Haiti==
After Geffrard&#x27;s departure the Council of the Secretaries of State became the supreme authority for a time. But in April 1867, Salnave arrived in Port-au-Prince, where he was given a hearty welcome, and on May 2 he became, together with Nissage Saget and Victorin Chevallier, a member of the provisional government which was organized. His adherents were displeased at this distribution of power, and under their pressure he assumed, on May 4, the title of &quot;Protector of the Republic&quot;. The attitude of the masses and the growing popularity of Salnave began to occasion much concern to the liberals, who found themselves once more obliged to submit to a military man. This mistrust of their new leader boded ill for the country.

The National Assembly met at Port-au-Prince on May 6, 1867, and on June 14 adopted a Constitution which abolished the Presidency for life, the duration of the authority vested in the Chief of the Executive Power being fixed at four years. On the same day Salnave was elected President of Haiti. He gained the sympathy of the people by his courage and his simple tastes. But he was far from being a liberal; so much so in fact that he was soon at odds with the legislative body, which thought that the time had come to establish the parliamentary system. On October 11, 1867, the rupture with Congress was complete, caused by an interpellation of the Cabinet by the House of Representatives concerning the arrest and imprisonment of General Leon Montas. About that time the peasants had taken up arms at Vallières against Salnave; and the General was charged with being the instigator, if not the leader, of the uprising. The members of the Cabinet openly accused the House of Representatives of being in connivance with the rebels; whereupon the mob invaded the House on October 14 and drove out the Congressmen. This ill-considered act of violence was followed by grave consequences. In the meantime, the President had left for Gonaïves with a view of subduing the insurgents at Vallières, who had assumed the name of &quot;Cacos&quot;.

By forcibly ejecting the members of the House of Representatives, Salnave had suspended the Constitution; yet he affected to believe that the opposition he met with was due to his limited authority. Accordingly, on April 22, 1868, he committed yet another blunder by permitting the officers and non-commissioned officers of his army, whose headquarters were at Trou-du-Nord, to form a petition requesting the suspension of the Constitution and dictatorship for the head of the Executive Power. Thus Salnave reestablished the Presidency for life and arrogated unlimited power.

Nissage Saget, who was at that time Commandant of the arrondissement of Saint-Marc, took up arms against this usurpation. Once more frustrated in the hopes of having a government founded on legality and liberty, the country reached one of the most critical periods of its existence, as the insurrection soon became general. Pétion Faubert at Léogâne, Normil at Anse-à-Veau, Michel Domingue at Aquin, and Pierre Théoma Boisrond-Canal at Pétionville and Croix-des-Bouquets all rose up against the dictatorship assumed by Salnave, who was being besieged at Port-au-Prince. The insurgents from the South had their headquarters at Carrefour, at a distance of three leagues from the capital.

Salnave tried to come to terms with them; but failing in his attempt, he determined to rely henceforth on his energy and valor in maintaining his authority. He had the advantage of the unity of command over his opponents; for the rebels in the South had numerous leaders: Domingue, whose headquarters were at Cayes, Normil at Anse-à-Veau, etc.; whilst in the Artibonite, Nissage Saget&#x27;s authority was fully acknowledged. In consequence of a counter-revolution which occurred at Léogâne and in the mountains of Jacmel, the insurgents were compelled to raise the siege of Port-au-Prince on July 17, 1868. They now felt the necessity of organizing their government; therefore, on September 19, 1868, Nissage Saget was proclaimed at Saint-Marc provisional President, whilst on September 22 Domingue was acknowledged President of the Meridianal State, with headquarters at Cayes.

Salnave&#x27;s intrepidity gave him for a while all the chances of crushing his foes. He had purchased a steamer in the United States to replace the two men-of-war, &quot;Le 22 Décembre&quot; and &quot;Le Geffrard&quot;, which had gone over to the insurgents. The new steamer, which was given the name of &quot;Alexandre Pétion&quot;, arrived at Port-au-Prince on September 19, 1868. The next day Salnave went on board and sailed for Petit-Goâve, in which harbor the two steamers belonging to the rebels were anchored. The &quot;Alexandre Pétion&quot; opened fire on &quot;Le 22 Décembre&quot;, which was sunk; the commandant of &quot;Le Geffrard&quot; blew up his ship so as to prevent her being captured.

This success made Salnave master of Petit-Goave, which town the insurgents were compelled to evacuate. In February 1869, the whole of the Southern Department was once more under his authority, with the exception of Jérémie and Cayes, which were closely surrounded. From Camp-Boudet, where he had established his headquarters, he personally directed the siege of Cayes, of which eventually he would have taken possession had not fortunes of war gone contrary to his plan in the Artibonite. His principal lieutenant, General Victorin Chevallier, had been obliged to evacuate Gonaïves, which was occupied by Saget&#x27;s troops. On their arrival at Port-au-Prince Chevallier&#x27;s soldiers created such disturbances that Salnave had to leave Camp-Boudet hurriedly for the capital, where he arrived on September 1, 1869. He had also at that time to fight the opposition of the Catholic clergy. On June 28 he had summarily dismissed Martial-Guillaume-Marie Testard du Cosquer, the Archbishop of Port-au-Prince; and had taken the same measure against Alexis-Jean-Marie Guilloux, the Vicar-General, on October 16.

Salnave&#x27;s position was getting worse; one of his most faithful followers, General Victorin Chevallier, Secretary of War, who was in command of the army surrounding Jacmel, deserted his cause in November and joined the insurrection. Salnave now began to reflect that he might yet be able to allay the discontent reigning throughout the country by relinquishing the absolute power he had usurped. In August 1869, he appointed a Legislative Council. This body met in November and, reestablishing the Presidency for life assumed by Salnave, reenacted the Constitution of 1846. But it was too late to be of avail and the abolition of the dictatorship was powerless in saving the Government; for Cap-Haitien and the whole department of the Northwest had already joined the cause of the insurrection. A bold attack on Port-au-Prince at length put an end to this civil war. On December 16, 1869, Generals Georges Brice and Boisrond-Canal landed at the capital at the head of 1,200 soldiers; in the night they had surprised the Government man-of-war &quot;La Terreur&quot;. During the fight which ensued this ship began bombarding the Executive Mansion; a shot struck the powder magazine, causing it to explode just after Salnave had left the place. Salnave succeeded in reaching the Dominican territory; but General José María Cabral, who was in sympathy with his opponents, betraying the trust he had placed in him, gave him up to the Haitians.

On January 15, 1870, Salnave arrived at Port-au-Prince, where he appeared before a court martial. He was sentenced to death and shot on the same day at six o&#x27;clock in the evening, tied to a pole set up on the smoking ruins of the Executive Mansion.

<doc id="667505" wikidata="Q1321240" url="?curid=667505" title="Old North Church">
<text>The Old North Church (officially, Christ Church in the City of Boston), is an Episcopal mission church located in the North End neighborhood of Boston. The church, which was built in 1723, is the oldest standing church building in Boston and a National Historic Landmark. 

Old North Church is famous for its role in Paul Revere&#x27;s midnight ride on April 18, 1775. On that night, the church&#x27;s sexton, Robert Newman hung two lanterns in the church&#x27;s steeple, which alerted Revere and the other riders to British military movements prior to the Battles of Lexington and Concord, the first engagements of the American Revolutionary War.

==History==
Construction of the Old North Church began in April 1723, continuing throughout the year. Nine months later, the church was completed sufficiently enough for the congregation to hold and celebrate its first worship service on December 29, with only some interior finishing left to be completed. The architectural design was inspired by the works of English architect Christopher Wren, who was responsible for rebuilding London after the Great Fire. Timothy Cutler was the founding rector after serving as third rector of Yale College from 1719 to 1722. Jason Haven was called to minister, but his parishioners at the First Church and Parish in Dedham convinced him to stay.

===17th century===
As a port town in the 17th century, Boston played an important role in the world of Atlantic trade. Old North Church was established in 1723 and initially named Christ Church in the City of Boston. It was Boston&#x27;s second Anglican Church and a social nexus for Boston&#x27;s younger merchants and privateers. The older Anglican Church, King&#x27;s Chapel, was a long-time favorite of Boston&#x27;s wealthy elite. The esteemed status of the King&#x27;s Chapel and its rapidly increasing membership, made it difficult for the younger, less wealthy merchants of Boston to participate in the congregation and signal their status in order to create these necessary social networks of exchange. Therefore, the Old North fulfilled that social function, supplying merchants and ship captains with a religious common ground to build their inter-Atlantic trust upon.

Evidence from the trial of a 1743 mutiny aboard the &quot;Rising Sun&quot;, a merchant ship, revealed some of Boston&#x27;s merchants to be involved in the operations of a smuggling ring organized by Old North donor Gedney Clark, who resided in Barbados though he was a MA-born merchant.

Merchants of Boston would trade goods and traffic enslaved African peoples throughout the Caribbean in exchange for cacao from the Dutch colony, Suriname. From Suriname, the cacao would be transferred to the British colony of Barbados. Laundering the cacao through Barbados was a means to make it a &quot;British&quot; product, since British subjects were not permitted to trade outside the British Empire, which allowed merchants to re-export the cacao to London, with a fraction being smuggled back to Boston.

===18th century===
Clark and Peter Faneuil each donated 100 pounds for the creation of Old North Church, representing the two largest contributions for the purchase of the church&#x27;s bells. The two Old North members aboard the Rising Sun, Captain Newark Jackson and the merchant George Ledain, did not survive the mutiny. They were pew owners who made donations to fund the first steeple at Old North.

Historian Jared Ross Hardesty characterized the Church&#x27;s role within the greater Atlantic world and in Boston: &quot;Much like they laundered cacao through Barbados to make it a &#x27;legal&#x27; commodity, the men laundered their reputations through Old North, signaling that they were upstanding men of commerce who gave back to the community that supported their activities.&quot;

Logwood was another product that played a significant role in the church&#x27;s history. Logwood was sought after for its purple-red hue, becoming popular as a base for stable black and deep purple dyes for fabric, leather, etc. It can only be grown in the Yucatan Peninsula, and was exported out of present-day Belize, from what was then known as the &quot;Bay of Honduras.&quot; Before the 1720s, logwood was exported to England through Jamaica, but after 1720 it was exported to New England in order to be re-exported once again out of Boston and Newport, RI to England. Logwood quickly became one of the primary trade goods of the Americas at the time, second only to tobacco.

Like cacao, logwood was a product of the enslaved Black and Indigenous people whose labor made it an accessible commodity. With many Boston merchants profiting off of their participation in the logwood trade, a group of traders called the &quot;Gentlemen of the Bay of Honduras&quot; donated several loads of logwood to the Old North Church in 1727.

Their donation would largely fund the construction of the church&#x27;s first steeple. &quot;The Bay Pew,&quot; stylized in honor of the Gentlemen of the Bay of Honduras, stands at the front of the Old North Church today as the only remaining decorated pew in the church. Though the &quot;Bay Pew&quot; decor visitors see when they come to Old North today is not the original, the furnishing and fabric that adorn the pew demonstrate how some pew owners may have decorated their box pews.

===Old North Illuminated===
In 1991, the Old North Foundation was established as a secular non-profit organization independent of the church. Later renamed Old North Illuminated, it is responsible for the historic operations of the site, including interpretative, educational, and preservation programs. , Angela Johnson is the chairman of the board and Nikki Stewart is the executive director.

==Slavery==

Slavery existed in the New England colonies as early as the 1630s. Indian wars of the 17th century, including the Pequot War and King Philip&#x27;s War, resulted in the capture of indigenous prisoners of war, who were sold to the West Indies or other parts of the Caribbean in exchange for enslaved Africans. As one arm of the Atlantic Triangle Exchange, enslaved Africans were transported from the West Indies and Caribbean to the Thirteen Colonies on the Atlantic Coast. Most ended up in plantation economies of the South, but some were taken to northern hubs of commerce, such as Boston, which was then under European colonial rule and had a long historical association with African slavery. In the 18th century, slaves in Boston were the descendants of this small population of enslaved Africans that ended up in the New England Colonies.

Modern estimates suggest that enslaved Black African people made up 10-15% of Boston&#x27;s 18th century population. Additionally, there were many forms of &quot;unfreedom&quot; that confined Black and Indigenous peoples and poor white Europeans. Until slavery was abolished in Massachusetts in 1783, it was commonplace for wealthy families in and around Boston to enslave Black and Indigenous peoples as supplemental to household labor. Many of Old North&#x27;s members enslaved people, or profited off of their involvement in enterprises dependent on enslaved labor. Church records document the baptisms, marriages, and funerals of free and enslaved Black and Indigenous people.

The Old North Church&#x27;s first rector, Timothy Cutler, was among those counted as enslavers. He enslaved a woman named Ann in his home. Cutler was a missionary of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG), tasked with converting enslaved Black and Indigenous peoples in the area. The SPG was a pro-slavery organization that owned the Codrington Plantation in Barbados.

==Sanctuary and Upper Gallery==
Old North Church&#x27;s sanctuary was opened to the public in December 1723, with minimal work and plastering left to be completed. The box pews in the sanctuary would have cost an initial 30 pounds, but owners were also expected to pay an annual tax and make weekly contributions. If owners fell behind on their weekly contributions, the church reserved the right to sell their pew. Owning a pew made those owner&#x27;s church proprietors and gave them a vote in all church matters. The church also had two pews in the back of the center aisle designated for &quot;Wardens and Strangers&quot; possibly to entice non-members to join the congregation.

The brass chandeliers were obtained in 1723. The current organ was installed in 1759 and built by Thomas Johnston of Boston. It took the place of a previous organ obtained in 1736. The four angels surrounding the organ were donated by Captain Thomas Gruchy, owner of pew #25, in 1746 after he captured them from a French ship during King George&#x27;s War.

In 1726, the vestry voted to pay Thomas Bennet 70 pounds for building 24 pews in the North and South Galleries upstairs, in addition to 86 benches along the back walls. This seating would have been for people of lesser means, children under the age of 12, and Black and Indigenous church members.

The Upper Gallery housed the only discounted box pews in Old North. They cost about 20 pounds each, with families sometimes sharing a pew in order to make the cost more affordable. Congregants seated in the gallery could have been free, enslaved, or indentured Black people, Indigenous peoples, or those who couldn&#x27;t afford to purchase a pew below. Enslaved people were expected to be baptized and were required to attend church with their enslavers. They could not sit amongst their enslavers and sat in the gallery instead. Sermons were often difficult to hear from up there, and its position made it the coldest area of the church in the winter and the hottest in the summer. There are several reasons Black and Indigenous people may have worshiped at Old North Church; they may have been forced to attend by an enslaver or employer, they may have sought the social currency an Anglican church membership accorded, or they may have chosen to attend for their own spiritual purposes. They endured uncomfortable and inequitable conditions for a multitude of reasons, most of which were necessary to their survival in colonial-era Boston.

===American Revolution===


In April 1775, Paul Revere told three patriots in Boston to hang two lanterns in the steeple. These men were the church sexton Robert Newman and Captain John Pulling Jr., who historian David Hackett Fischer suggests each carried one lantern up to the steeple along with Thomas Bernard, who stood watch for British troops outside the church. The lanterns were displayed to send a warning to Charlestown patriots across the Charles River about the movements of the British Army. Revere and William Dawes later delivered the same message in person to patriots in Lexington, but there was a quicker way to inform the backup riders in Charlestown about the movements of the British; these backup riders, in turn, delivered the warning message to Lexington and Concord in case Revere and Dawes were arrested on the way.

The lanterns were hung for just under a minute to avoid catching the eyes of the British troops occupying Boston, but this was long enough for the message to be received in Charlestown. The militia waiting across the river had been told to look for the signal lanterns, and were prepared to act as soon as they saw them.

The meaning of two lanterns has been memorized by countless American schoolchildren. &quot;One if by land, and two if by sea&quot; is from Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s 1860 poem &quot;Paul Revere&#x27;s Ride&quot;. One lantern was to notify Charlestown that the British Army would march over Boston Neck and the Great Bridge, and two were to notify them that the troops were taking boats across the Charles River to land near the Phips farm on Lechmere Point in Cambridge (the British Army would take the &quot;sea&quot; route; thus, two lanterns were hung). After receiving the signal, the Charlestown Patriots sent out a rider to Lexington, but this rider did not reach his destination and his identity has disappeared from history, having possibly been captured by a British patrol.

But the warning was delivered miles away to dozens of towns, first by Revere and Dawes on horses, and then by other men on horses and men who rang church bells and town bells, beat drums, and shot off warning guns. The current status of the lanterns is not entirely clear; one is said to be in the hands of a private collector, another was broken during a tour, and yet another is on display at the Concord Museum.

===Post-American Revolution===
Between 1806 and 1912, the box pews were replaced with slip pews to accommodate the growing congregation, passing through the center aisle seen today. The pews in the sanctuary were restored in 1912, with some of the original doors, hinges, and paneling from 1723. They are reported to be numbered the same way they were in 1731.

From 1831 to 1912, a third level to the gallery was added to the West wall of the church on each side of the organ. This gallery was built by Thomas Clark for the children attending the 19th century Sunday School.

In 1806, the box pews were deconstructed and replaced with slip pews, commonly seen in churches today, to allow for more congregants to attend services. Slip pews were still purchased up until the restoration of 1912. The slip pews were replaced with box pews, and those families who wished to remain pew owners were grandfathered in to do so. After 1912, the Old North Church became an open congregation and seating was open to the public on a first-come, first-served basis.

===1912 Restoration===
In the Spring of 1912, the Old North Church underwent a reconstruction to align more with the simple Puritan style of other churches in early MA history. The intent was to restore the church to how the Founding Fathers would have seen it, mistakenly assuming it adhered to the plain Puritan style popular in the era.

Under the direction of architects R. Clipson Sturgis and Henry C. Ross, the original floor timbers and gallery stairs were replaced. The box pews, which had been deconstructed to make room for slip pews in 1806, were reconstructed along with the raised pulpit. The interior woodwork was &quot;incorrectly painted white, rather than in the rich variety of colors that have been described in early texts of the church.&quot;

The church re-opened December 29, 1912 (the 189th anniversary of its first service) to showcase its restoration. Theodore Roosevelt was in attendance, sitting in pew #25.

==Church structure==
===The Steeples===

Old North Church&#x27;s steeple is famous for the role it played in Paul Revere&#x27;s April 18, 1775, lantern signal to warn militias in Charlestown that the British were coming, launching the American Revolution. For this, Old North&#x27;s steeple has become an iconic symbol of liberty in the U.S.

While the 1727 load of logwood donated by the &quot;Gentlemen of the Bay of Honduras&quot; was a substantial contribution to the funds needed for the first steeple, in 1737 Old North Church leaders began a subscription campaign to collect the remaining funds needed to construct the first spire. In 1740, the spire, the design for which was attributed to William Price, was finished and hoisted atop Old North&#x27;s tower. The golden weathervane crafted by Shem Drowne was fixed to the top, making Old North Church the tallest structure in Boston. A young Paul Revere served as a bell-ringer at Old North. It would be this steeple that he would incorporate into his 1775 plan to signal that the British were marching &quot;by sea&quot; across the Charles River.

The original steeple of the Old North Church was destroyed by the 1804 New England hurricane. In October 1804, a &quot;very violent gale&quot; blew the wooden spire from Old North&#x27;s tower, destroying a house below it. Two years later, enough funds had been raised and a newly constructed spire was hoisted to the top once again in 1806. This replacement steeple&#x27;s design was based on drawings from Charles Bulfinch.

The replacement steeple was toppled by Hurricane Carol on August 31, 1954. Hurricane Carol tore down the second spire, sending it crashing onto Salem Street and Hull Street, with minimal damage done to a building across the street. This time, the congregation launched a national fundraising campaign. In October 1955, the third spire was completed, it replicated the first original steeple and was fixed with steel reinforcements to prevent another disaster. Drowne&#x27;s original weathervane, which was curiously &quot;borrowed&quot; by someone in the North End after the steeple came down the previous year, was restored atop the steeple. This is the steeple visitors to the Old North Church will see today.

The church is now tall.

===Bells===

Eight change ringing bells (tenor: in F) at Old North Church were cast by Abel Rudhall (Rudhall of Gloucester) in Gloucester, England, in 1744 and hung in 1745. One bell has the inscription: &quot;We are the first ring of bells cast for the British Empire in North America, A.R. 1744.&quot; The bells were restored in 1894 and in 1975. They are maintained and rung regularly by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Guild of Bellringers.

==The Crypt==
In 2009, an archeologist began examining the estimated 1,100 bodies buried in 37 tombs in the basement. The crypt was in use between 1732 and 1860, and each tomb is sealed with a wooden or slate door, with many doors covered over by plaster as ordered by the city of Boston in the 1850s.

Notable burials include founding rector the Rev. Timothy Cutler and his wife, who are buried under the altar together. Other notable figures buried under the church include British Marine Major John Pitcairn, who died due to injuries received at the Battle of Bunker Hill and was entombed along with many other soldiers killed in this battle. Captain Samuel Nicholson of the USS &quot;Constitution&quot; is also buried in the crypt. A behind the scenes tour run by the church takes tourists down into the crypt, as well as up to the bell-ringing chamber.

==Clough House==
Sitting behind the Old North Church on Unity Street, the Clough House is a historic building, serving multiple purposes for the Old North Historic Site. Ebenezer Clough, a master brick mason, built this house on pastureland around 1715. He went on to contribute his masonry skills to the construction of the Old North Church in 1723.

The Clough House is one of three remaining brick structures that date to the first decades of the 1700s in Boston. Today, the Clough House functions as an exhibit, gallery, and office space; housing the Printing Office of Edes and Gill and the Heritage Goods and Gifts shop.

==Old North Church gift shop==
Built in 1918, this building originally functioned as a Waldensian chapel for Italian immigrants in the North End. In 1914, Old North&#x27;s rector, William Dewart, realized he had the opportunity, as a fellow Protestant, to support these newcomers to Boston. Dewart made the Old North Church available for their worship on Sunday afternoons, arranging for the minister, Henry Sartorio, to give services in their native language, Italian. Cecelia Frances Lincoln of Brookline offered to help pay for a chapel if Old North would provide the land upon which to build it. On Thanksgiving Day, 1918, the chapel of St. Francis Assisi was dedicated. However, restrictions on immigration from Italy, coupled with the shifting of people living in the city to the suburbs, resulted in a rapidly eroding congregation by 1929. By the 1950s the chapel was no longer in use.

Around this time, interest in the Old North Church as a historic site was taking off, (aligning with national calls to restore the steeple in 1954) leading Old North to purchase the building and convert it to a museum and retail space. The museum aspect of the building was phased out, but the building remains Old North Church&#x27;s gift shop today.

Multiple architectural details remain intact; the cross adorning the roof, the haloed figures carved into the pillars, and the stone lions that sit on either side of the steps are all a part of the original architecture, observable to visitors today. For this history, the gift shop is on the National Register of Historic Places.

==19th Century==
Where the Parish House stands, there once was the Salem Street Academy, a Sunday school for children. Old North Church was part-owner of this school that opened on June 4, 1815. Excerpts from an 1830 report on the progress of the Sunday school reveals that it served a vital purpose to the community. Some who attended realized the opportunity for child-care, providing parents with the time to attend Old North Church&#x27;s services themselves. The Sunday school also presented an alternative opportunity for those with lesser means to attend a kind of church service when they did not have the &quot;suitable&quot; clothing required for a regular service.

Following the resignation of Rev. Asa Eaton, Reverend William Croswell became rector of Old North in 1829. In 1833, Croswell and three other Anglican ministers hosted Reverend William Levington, the third Black man to be ordained to the Episcopal Church in America, to come speak at Old North Church to raise money to fund his own church and school for free Black children in Baltimore. In 1845, Rev. Croswell became the founding minister of the Church of the Advent, the first Anglican church in Boston that did not require the purchase of pews. Croswell fulfilled this dream of his, ministering to the less fortunate, serving as rector to the Church of the Advent until his death in 1851.

==U.S. Bicentennial celebration==

On April 18, 1975, U.S. President Gerald Ford visited Old North Church. In his nationally televised speech, Ford said:

Let us pray here in the Old North Church tonight that those who follow 100 years or 200 years from now may look back at us and say: We were a society which combined reason with liberty and hope with freedom. May it be said above all: We kept the faith, freedom flourished, liberty lived. These are the abiding principles of our past and the greatest promise of our future.

Following Ford&#x27;s remarks, two lanterns were lit by Robert Newman Ruggles and Robert Newman Sheet, descendants of Robert Newman, who, as sexton of the Old North Church in 1775, lit the two lanterns which signaled the movement of British troops. The President then lit a third lantern, which hangs in a window of the church today.

On July 11, 1976, Queen Elizabeth II visited Boston as part of celebrations honoring the United States Bicentennial, and made reference to the aforementioned celebration events in April 1975 that followed President Ford&#x27;s speech. She said: &quot;At the Old North Church last year, your President lit a third lantern dedicated to America&#x27;s third century of freedom and to renewed faith in the American ideals. May its light never be dimmed.&quot;

The Queen and Prince Philip attended a Sunday morning service at the Old North Church, sitting in front of the chancel. The Rev. Robert W. Golledge led the service and later presented the Queen with a replica of a silver chalice made by Paul Revere. The Queen was shown the iconic statue of &quot;Paul Revere&quot; by Cyrus E. Dallin near the church before departing in a motorcade to attend a function at the Old State House.

==Rectors==
Old North Church&#x27;s first rector was Reverend Dr. Timothy Cutler. Cutler was born in Charlestown, MA in 1684 and attended Harvard College. He served as president and rector of Yale College until 1722. In 1722, Cutler notified Yale&#x27;s board of trustees that he, along with others, intended to seek ordination from the Church of England, admitting their doubt about their current ordination status as they had not been ordained by a bishop- which they felt the Scriptures mandated. This controversy came to be known by Congregationalists as the Yale Apostasy. After being released from his position by Yale, Cutler was invited to Boston by the committee building the Christ Church (Old North). Cutler journeyed to England for his ordination, returning to Boston one year later with a Doctorate in Divinity from both Oxford and Cambridge Universities. Cutler was ordained as a priest and a missionary for the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts. Cutler celebrated his first service at the Christ Church (Old North) on December 29, 1723. Cutler served at Old North until his death in 1765. As first rector, he is honored at Old North- entombed in the crypt, directly below the altar.

Like Timothy Cutler, Reverend Mather Byles Jr. left the Congregational ministry to be ordained as an Anglican priest. Like Cutler, Byles was an enslaver. Old North Church&#x27;s records document the baptism of Byles’ enslaved servant, a man named Cato in early April 1775. Byles served the Christ Church in the City of Boston (Old North) from 1768- April 1775. 

In 1774, the British Parliament closed the port of Boston, in a series of punishments under the Intolerable Acts, for the Boston Tea Party the year prior in 1773. With trade stalled, the congregation could not source the funds needed to pay Byles. However, contributing factors were complex as Byles was also a loyalist, and there were rumors circulating that he was considering serving another church. We do not know what factors ultimately motivated the congregation or Byles’ decisions, but it is documented that on April 18, 1775, Byles met with the church proprietor&#x27;s and turned his keys in. Later that evening, two men, who were likely vestryman Captain John Pulling Jr. and sexton Robert Newman, climbed the steeple and held high two lanterns to signal that the British were marching to Charlestown &quot;by sea” across the Charles River. In March 1776, Byles, his family, and likely their enslaved people, sailed to New Brunswick accompanied by fellow loyalists. The Banishment Act of 1778 named Byles as a person who was forbidden from returning to Massachusetts, “to suffer death without benefit of clergy if he should return.”
The Christ Church (Old North Church) was closed, like many other Church of England congregations, until August 1778.

In the summer of 1776, Stephen Lewis sailed from England with General Burgoyne&#x27;s 16th Regiment of Light Dragoons, as chaplain to the troops. The ship, troops, and Lewis were captured as prisoners of war; Lewis was held captive in the town of Boxford until 1778. In January 1778, Lewis was exchanged for a Continental Army prisoner of war and sent to New York. Before going to New York, he performed a private baptism at Christ Church (Old North), which had been closed since 1775. In July 1778, Lewis appealed to his captors saying he wished to sever his connection to the British government and wished to become, instead, a subject of Massachusetts. Records document that Lewis became the rector of Christ Church in August 1778, immediately resuming services thereafter. Lewis traveled to churches lacking a permanent clergy, to minister to the needs of their congregants, as most Anglican priests left Boston in 1776. During this time, prayers offered during service reflected the political temperaments of the era, no longer offering prayers for the King and royal family, as American Anglican churches moved away from loyalty to the King as head of the Church of England. Lewis served as rector of Christ Church (Old North) until 1784, when he moved to South Carolina. He died in 1790.

==Other Worshippers==
Recent research bridges the historical gap between the surplus of knowledge we have about wealthy and white Old North Church members, and the understudied experiences of Black and Indigenous congregants. Research on the Humphries family not only shines a light on their specific experiences within the congregation, but also serves as a representative archival presence that can inform us about the lives of other Black congregants.

John and Elizabeth Humphries were a free Black couple who first appeared in Old North&#x27;s records in March 1748 with the baptism of their daughter, Deborah. Over the course of the next four years, John and Elizabeth baptized seven more children: Robert, Richard, James, Catherine, Elizabeth, Thomas, and Ruth. Five of the Humphries children were baptized on the same day. There was a funeral service for one of their daughters a few days after she had been baptized, and John died shortly after the baptism of their last child in 1751. Their family name was occasionally present on Old North Church&#x27;s alms list: a list of families that received small donations from the church. After the death of John, three of their children were indentured out to Alexander Chamberlain, a sailmaker and prominent Old North member, in 1756 and 1757.Their youngest child, Ruth, who was just six at the time, was contracted to serve an indenture for twelve years.

A notice of death for an Indigenous woman named Jerusha Will, revealed that she had been taken in by the Humphries in 1743. She was baptized at Old North Church on May 9, 1743, passing away only a few days later, with orders being given to bury her on May 21 by Captain Steel to the &quot;Overseers of the Poor.&quot;

In October 1765, an &quot;Elizabeth Humphries&quot; appears in Old North Church&#x27;s marriage records, marrying an enslaved man named Robert Hunter. It cannot be known if Elizabeth was the mother or daughter. Their marriage is noteworthy because Elizabeth was a free woman marrying Robert, an enslaved man. Unlike in England, in the colonies, a child&#x27;s status was dependent on that of their mother. In this unfree society, Elizabeth and Robert were ensuring their children would be born as legally free people.

==The other &quot;Old North&quot;==

Before the construction of the &quot;Old North Church&quot; (Christ Church, Boston), there was another church in Boston called the &quot;Old North&quot; (Meetinghouse). This Congregationalist meeting house was founded in North Square, across the street from what is now called &quot;Paul Revere&#x27;s house&quot;. This church was once pastored by the Rev. Cotton Mather, the minister now known largely for his involvement in the Salem witch trials.

==Present-day==
Old North Church is today one of four church sites among the 16 stops on the Freedom Trail. It is an active congregation of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts with a Sunday morning service at 11 a.m. The current vicar is the Rev. Dr. Matthew Cadwell, who has served since November 2020.

==Archives==
Old North&#x27;s church records are held by the Massachusetts Historical Society. They are available for researchers to view by appointment.

== In Popular culture ==
The Old North Church makes an appearance in the post-apocalyptic video game &quot;Fallout 4&quot;, serving as the headquarters for one of the game&#x27;s main four factions, the Railroad. It became their headquarters after their old base of operations, a pre-war bunker used by the government called the Switchboard, was raided by the Institute. The player is able to explore the crypts beneath the church and access the hidden door that leads to the Railroad&#x27;s headquarters by imputing a password using the correct letters on a spinning wheel.

It was also featured at the end of the Disney film &quot;National Treasure&quot; when Sean Bean’s character and his men try to break in and the police and FBI promptly arrive and arrest him and his goons.

<text>New York, Rio, and Buenos Aires Line (NYRBA or NYRBA Air Lines) was an airline that operated seaplane service from New York City to Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, and intermediate points on the east coast of South America during the 1920s. It was forced to merge into its competitor, Pan American World Airways, in 1930.

==History==
NYRBA was founded by Colonel Ralph A. O&#x27;Neill, who had been a decorated ace fighter pilot in World War I and then been a main figure in the establishment of both civil and military aviation in Mexico. He was named the exclusive agent for Boeing and Pratt &amp; Whitney in all of Latin America in 1927, and in his travels he conceived the idea for the airline.

A self-made man, O&#x27;Neill personally establishing all South American stops for NYRBA, created designs for the company&#x27;s seaplanes with leading manufacturers, and arranged the financial backing for his new company. On August 21, 1929, NYRBA started to fly daily between Buenos Aires and Montevideo using the S-38. On September 1, 1929, a flight to Santiago de Chile was initiated and on November 29 on the same year, a flight between Buenos Aires and Yacuíba, Bolivia with multiple stops, started. Brazilian operations started on January 24, 1930, with the creation of its Brazilian subsidiary NYRBA do Brasil with flights along the Brazilian coast. The inaugural flight between Buenos Aires and Miami took place between February 19 and 25, 1930, using eight different Commodores seaplanes and from then on they became regular. Refueling bases consisted of barges and boats that were stationed every 125 to 460 miles along the routes. Most would fuel with five gallon tin cans shipped from Standard Oil in New Jersey. Passenger loads in March 1930 were 15% from Miami to Montevideo, 70% to Buenos Aires, and 45% to Santiago with 16 to 20 cents charged per mile.

Another coup by O&#x27;Neill was to secure the Ponta do Calabouço landfill, considered the most valuable real estate in Rio de Janeiro, for use as NYRBA&#x27;s base in the city.

With the construction of these first &quot;airports&quot;, NYRBA was at the time, the world&#x27;s longest airline, 7,800 miles.

O&#x27;Neill met callous opposition from Juan Trippe, who with his associates had taken control of Pan Am. Trippe, his wealthy Yale roommate Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney, and their Aviation Corporation of the Americas chairman Richard Hoyt were related by marriage and close to the Second Assistant Postmaster General, W. Irving Glover, the professional head of the U.S. Post Office as the position of Postmaster General was a political sinecure. Glover refused to grant air mail contracts to any company not controlled by Trippe&#x27;s triumvirate. This action was both highly illegal to monopoly laws and a morally corrupt abuse of power.

O&#x27;Neill soldiered on in the belief that an airline could actually support itself by carrying passengers, and managed to obtain backing from James Rand, Jr., head of Remington Rand, and others, and NYRBA took to the skies. Their proudest aircraft were the Consolidated Commodore flying boats, although they also used the Consolidated Fleetster, and the Sikorsky S-38.

After the onset of the Great Depression NYRBA&#x27;s backers were coerced by Trippe and Glover to began to pull out their investments. Though the company&#x27;s business was growing and it had far more assets, it was compelled to merge as the junior partner into Trippe&#x27;s Pan Am under circumstances O&#x27;Neill described as &quot;a shotgun wedding after a damnable rape&quot;. On August 19, 1930 Pan American took over NYRBA for the bargain price of US$2 million.

O&#x27;Neill, when offered to head Pan Am&#x27;s East Coast operations, stated: &quot;You can steal my house, but you can&#x27;t ask me to run it for you&quot;.

While the aviation business thrived, with financial credit given to Pan Am which contrived to take even when it was still controlled by NYRBA, the Brazilian government re-appropriated Ponta do Calabouço. The subsidiary NYRBA do Brasil, which Pan American retained 100% of the shares until 1942, was renamed Panair do Brasil on November 21, 1930. It later became that country&#x27;s flag carrier.

The NYRBA legacy has been greatly overshadowed by Pan Am, but it&#x27;s plethora of accomplishments cannot be denied.

<text>Sigrun Grau (née Ludwigs, then Wodars, born 7 November 1965) is an East German former middle distance athlete who was born Sigrun Ludwigs in Neu Kaliß, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. She started out as a 400 m hurdler in Schwerin and finished fourth at the 1981 European Junior Championships. She then switched clubs and changed to the 800 m like her new club mate, Christine Wachtel, who would also become her closest rival.

Now competing under the name of Wodars, she won her first national title in 1986 and placed second at the European Championships in Stuttgart, behind Nadezhda Olizarenko of the Soviet Union.

In 1987, she lost seven out of eight times to Wachtel, but the race she won was the World Championships in Rome, defeating her in a close finish. The two repeated their one-two finish at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul.

Wodars completed her set of titles by also winning the 1990 European Championships in Split, her last title. She divorced and took part as Sigrun Grau in the 1991 World Championships and the 1992 Olympics, reaching the semi-finals both times. She retired after the Barcelona Olympics and currently works as a physiotherapist.

<text>Theodemir or Theudimer (died 743) was a Visigothic &quot;comes&quot; (count) prominent in the southeast of Carthaginensis (the region around Murcia) during the last decades of the Visigothic kingdom and for several years after the Arab conquest. He ruled seven cities in southeastern Spain, mentioned in the Treaty of Orihuela that was preserved by the Andalusian historian Ibn Adarí in the thirteenth century: Orihuela, Valentila (possibly an equivalent for Valencia), Alicante, Mula, Bigastro, Eyya (probably Ojós), and Lorca.

Sometime probably during the joint reign of Egica and Wittiza, a Byzantine fleet raided the coasts of southern Iberia and was driven off by Theudimer. The dating of this event is disputed: it may have occurred as part of Leontios&#x27; expedition to relieve Carthage, under assault by the Arabs, in 697; perhaps later, around 702; or perhaps late in Wittiza&#x27;s reign. What is almost universally accepted is that it was an isolated incident connected with other military activities (probably against the Arabs) and not an attempt to reestablish the province of Spania, lost in the 620s. As E. A. Thompson states, &quot;We know nothing whatever of the context of this strange event.&quot;

After the defeat of king Roderic at the Battle of Guadalete in 711 or 712, Theudimer resisted the invading Arabs, but he was eventually defeated in pitched battle and made peace with the Muslim emir Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa. &quot;The text of the treaty he signed has been preserved in at least three separate sources, including a fourteenth-century biographical dictionary, and is dated to 5 April 713 (4 Recheb 94 AH).&quot; The treaty allowed that Christians who submitted to Muslim rule (&quot;the patronage of God&quot;) would be spared their lives and allowed to continue living with their families according to their mores and practising their Catholic faith in their churches, but they were required to pay a tribute &quot;per capita&quot; and to turn over any enemies of the conquerors to the government. The tribute consisted of one dinar, four measures (or jugfuls) each of wheat, barley, grape juice, and vinegar, plus two of honey and oil; and half this for slaves. Theudimer retained his land and his local authority.

Theudimer later travelled to Damascus to have his treaty confirmed by the Umayyad Caliph. However, it is unknown how long this treaty lasted in practice, whether it continued until Theudimer&#x27;s death (which is recorded in the &quot;Chronicle of 754&quot;) or after, or was cut short before his death. His prominence in the region is testified by the number of later Gothic nobles in the same region who tried to claim descent from him. The region itself was given the commemorative name Tudmir by the Arabs. Theudimer left a son, Athanagild, who was described as very wealthy by the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, but whether or not he was his successor is debated by scholars. If he did succeed, he would have done so around 740, but his fate is unknown and the region of Tudmir had lost its independence by the 780s.

==In fiction==
In the historical novel &quot;Amaya o los vascos en el siglo VIII&quot; (1879), the characters mention &quot;Teodomiro&quot; &quot;duke of Aurariola and Baetica, general prevost of the army&quot; as one of those who successfully resist Islamic dominance along with Pelayo of Asturias and García Jiménez of Navarre.

<doc id="667561" wikidata="Q892554" url="?curid=667561" title="Fifth-rate">
<text>In the rating system of the Royal Navy used to categorise sailing warships, a fifth rate was the second-smallest class of warships in a hierarchical system of six &quot;ratings&quot; based on size and firepower.

==Rating==

The rating system in the Royal Navy as originally devised had just four rates, but early in the reign of Charles I, the original fourth rate (derived from the &quot;Small Ships&quot; category under his father, James I) was divided into new classifications of fourth, fifth, and sixth rates. While a fourth-rate ship was defined as a ship of the line, fifth and the smaller sixth-rate ships were never included among ships-of-the-line. Nevertheless, during the Anglo-Dutch Wars of the 17th century, fifth rates often found themselves involved among the battle fleet in major actions. Structurally, these were two-deckers, with a complete battery on the lower deck, and fewer guns on the upper deck (below the forecastle and quarter decks, usually with no guns in the waist on this deck).

The fifth rates at the start of the 18th century were small two-deckers, generally either 40-gun ships with a full battery on two decks, or &quot;demi-batterie&quot; ships, carrying a few heavy guns on their lower deck (which often used the rest of the lower deck for row ports) and a full battery of lesser guns on the upper deck. The former were gradually phased out, though, as the low freeboard (the height of the lower deck gunport sills above the waterline) meant that opening the lower deck gunports in rough weather was often impossible. The 40-gun (or later 44-gun) fifth rates continued to be built until the latter half of the 18th century (a large number were built during the American Revolutionary War). From mid-century, a new fifth-rate type was introduced - the classic frigate, with no gun ports on the lower deck, and the main battery of from 26 to 30 guns disposed solely on the upper deck, although smaller guns were mounted on the quarterdeck and forecastle.

Fifth-rate ships served as fast scouts or independent cruisers, and included a variety of gun arrangements. The fifth rates of the 1750s generally carried a main battery of twenty-six 12-pounders on the upper deck, with six 6-pounders on the quarterdeck and forecastle (a few carried extra 6-pounders on the quarterdeck) to give a total rating of 32 guns. Larger fifth rates introduced during the late 1770s carried a main battery of twenty-six or twenty-eight 18-pounders, also with smaller guns (6-pounders or 9-pounders) on the quarterdeck and forecastle. Displacement ranged from 700 to 1450 tons, with crews of 215 to 294 men.

To be posted aboard a fifth-rate ship was considered an attractive assignment. Fifth rates were often assigned to interdict enemy shipping, offering the prospect of prize money for the crew.

Fifth-rate frigates were considered useful for their combination of manoeuvrability and firepower, which, in theory, would allow them to outmanoeuvre an enemy of greater force and run down one of lesser force. For this reason, frigates of this sort were commonly used in patrol and to disrupt enemy shipping lanes much as heavy cruisers would later in history.

<doc id="667564" wikidata="Q7294230" url="?curid=667564" title="Rapid single flux quantum">
<text>In electronics, rapid single flux quantum (RSFQ) is a digital electronic device that uses superconducting devices, namely Josephson junctions, to process digital signals. In RSFQ logic, information is stored in the form of magnetic flux quanta and transferred in the form of Single Flux Quantum (SFQ) voltage pulses. RSFQ is one family of superconducting or SFQ logic. Others include Reciprocal Quantum Logic (RQL), ERSFQ – energy-efficient RSFQ version that does not use bias resistors, etc. Josephson junctions are the active elements for RSFQ electronics, just as transistors are the active elements for semiconductor electronics. RSFQ is a classical digital, not quantum computing, technology.

RSFQ is very different from the CMOS transistor technology used in conventional computers:
* Superconducting devices require cryogenic temperatures.
* picosecond-duration SFQ voltage pulses produced by Josephson junctions are used to encode, process, and transport digital information instead of the voltage levels produced by transistors in semiconductor electronics.
* SFQ voltage pulses travel on superconducting transmission lines which have very small, and usually negligible, dispersion if no spectral component of the pulse is above the frequency of the energy gap of the superconductor.
* In the case of SFQ pulses of 1 ps, it is possible to clock the circuits at frequencies of the order of 100 GHz (one pulse every 10 picoseconds).

An SFQ pulse is produced when magnetic flux through a superconducting loop containing a Josephson junction changes by one flux quantum, Φ0 as a result of the junction switching. SFQ pulses have a quantized area ʃ&quot;V&quot;(&quot;t&quot;)&quot;dt&quot; = Φ0 ≈ = 2.07 mV⋅ps = 2.07 mA⋅pH due to magnetic flux quantization, a fundamental property of superconductors. Depending on the parameters of the Josephson junctions, the pulses can be as narrow as 1 ps with an amplitude of about 2 mV, or broader (e.g., 5–10 ps) with correspondingly lower amplitude. The typical value of the pulse amplitude is approximately 2&quot;I&quot;c&quot;R&quot;n, where &quot;I&quot;c&quot;R&quot;n is the product of the junction critical current, &quot;I&quot;c, and the junction damping resistor, &quot;R&quot;n. For Nb-based junction technology &quot;I&quot;c&quot;R&quot;n is on the order of 1 mV.

== Advantages ==
* Interoperable with CMOS circuitry, microwave and infrared technology
* Extremely fast operating frequency: from a few tens of gigahertz up to hundreds of gigahertz
* Low power consumption: about 100,000 times lower than CMOS semiconductors circuits, without accounting for refrigeration
* Existing chip manufacturing technology can be adapted to manufacture RSFQ circuitry
* Good tolerance to manufacturing variations
* RSFQ circuitry is essentially self clocking, making asynchronous designs much more practical.

== Disadvantages ==

* Requires cryogenic cooling. Traditionally this has been achieved using cryogenic liquids such as liquid nitrogen and liquid helium. More recently, closed-cycle cryocoolers, e.g., pulse tube refrigerators have gained considerable popularity as they eliminate cryogenic liquids which are both costly and require periodic refilling. Cryogenic cooling is also an advantage since it reduces the working environment&#x27;s thermal noise.
* The cooling requirements can be relaxed through the use of high-temperature superconductors. However, only very-low-complexity RFSQ circuits have been achieved to date using high-&quot;T&quot;c superconductors. It is believed that SFQ-based digital technologies become impractical at temperatures above ~ 20 K – 25 K because of the exponentially increasing bit error rates (thermally-induced junction switching) cause by decreasing of the parameter &quot;E&quot;J/&quot;k&quot;B&quot;T&quot; with increasing temperature &quot;T&quot;, where &quot;E&quot;J = &quot;I&quot;cΦ0/2π is the Josephson energy. 
* Static power dissipation that is typically 10–100 times larger than the dynamic power required to perform logic operations was one of the drawbacks. However, the static power dissipation was eliminated in ERSFQ version of RSFQ by using superconducting inductors and Josephson junctions instead of bias resistors, the source of the static power dissipation.

== Applications ==
* Optical and other high-speed network switching devices
* Digital signal processing, up to X-band signals and beyond
* Ultrafast routers
* Software-defined radio (SDR)
* High speed analog-to-digital converters
* High performance cryogenic computers
* Control circuitry for superconducting qubits and quantum circuits

The name Ballachulish (Ballecheles, 1522 – Straits town) was more correctly applied to the area now called North Ballachulish, to the north of Loch Leven, but was usurped for the quarry villages at East Laroch and West Laroch, either side of the River Laroch, which were actually within Glencoe and South Ballachulish respectively.

== Overview ==

As there was no road to the head of Loch Leven until 1927, the Ballachulish Ferry, established in 1733, and those at Invercoe/Callert and &quot;Caolas na Con&quot; were essential. The Ballachulish ferry closed in December 1975 when the Ballachulish Bridge finally opened.
The principal industry is now tourism. The Ballachulish Hotel and Ballachulish House (until recently [2010] a country house hotel) are located near the narrows at (south) Ballachulish Ferry rather than in the &quot;modern&quot; village some to the east. Ballachulish House was reputed to be haunted, and the drive leading to it was ridden by a headless horseman.

Ballachulish Peninsula extends into the loch.


The hamlet of Glenachulish lies in Gleann a&#x27; Chaolais, the glen that runs down to the narrows. This is the subject of the Gaelic song, Gleann Bhaile Chaoil written by John Cameron (1865–1951) and known locally both as the Paisley Bard and by his local nickname &quot;Iain Cealaidh&quot;. He is often confused with another local bard also called John Cameron, known locally as &quot;Iain Rob&quot; (1822–1898). Gleann a&#x27; Chaolais is ringed by Beinn a&#x27; Bheithir, a massif which contains two munros - Sgorr Dhearg and Sgorr Dhonuill. In recent years a number of new houses have been built locally along with holiday chalets and an art gallery. Also the fields of Gleann a&#x27; Chaolais have been turned into the 9-hole Dragon&#x27;s Tooth golf course.

Overlooking the narrows is the monument to James of the Glen, &quot;hanged on this spot for a crime of which he was not guilty&quot;. Robert Louis Stevenson based his novel &quot;Kidnapped&quot; around the story of the Appin Murder. Whoever was the sniper who did kill &quot;The Red Fox&quot; (Colin Roy Campbell of Glenure) is still not known for certain. In 2001, however, Amanda Penman, an 89-year-old descendant of the Scottish clan chiefs of the Stewarts of Appin, alleged that the Appin murder had been planned, in retaliation for the Red Fox&#x27;s role in the local Highland Clearances, by four young Stewart tacksmen without the sanction of James of the Glens. There was a shooting contest among them and the assassination was committed by the best marksman among the four, Donald Stewart of Ballachulish.

==Transport==
In 1903, a branch of the Callander and Oban Railway, from , was opened to Ballachulish. The site of the former railway halt of , the last stop on the line before the Laroch quarries, was next to Ballachulish House, some inland from the ferry. Traces of the line, which closed in 1966, remain between here and Connel Ferry. The old terminus station at Laroch (Ballachulish) is now a doctor&#x27;s surgery. The station, and stationmaster&#x27;s house, at , is now a private house and the station at , some south, has been refurbished in its old traditional Caledonian Railway brown. The station at Kentallen ( south of Ballachulish) included a pier. When the Oban-Ballachulish branch line closed, the station buildings were bought over by Scottie &amp; Bridget Stewart who ran the renowned Kentallen Station Tearooms for more than 15 years until finally retiring in 1974. Afternoon tea served here was a spectacular feast according to visitors&#x27; books from the day. This station has now been turned into The Holly Tree Hotel &amp; Leisure Club.

The A82 road serves Ballachulish and much of the old railway line has been re-used as part of National Cycle Route 78, once again giving the beautiful views previously seen from the train.

== Slate ==

Slate from the East Laroch quarries, established just two years after the infamous Glencoe Massacre of 1692, was used to provide the roofing slate for much of Edinburgh and Glasgow&#x27;s skyline in the succeeding centuries. It is of good quality but one weakness is the presence of Iron Pyrite in the rock. These crystals quickly rust away when exposed to the weather, leaving clean square holes and a brown rusty streak. Over 75% of the slate cut from the quarries was unusable as roof covering for this and other reasons. In 1955 the quarries closed, leaving waste mountains for the abruptly unemployed and impoverished villagers to sort out.

Between 1902 and 1905 the Ballachulish community was badly affected by two protracted conflicts in the slate quarries. The first began in July 1902, involved a twelve months lockout, and lasted eighteen months. The workers objected to the summary dismissal of the medical officer Dr. Lachlan Grant from both his work in the quarries and his post as Medical Officer for the Parish Council District of Ballachulish. They also objected to the unsatisfactory labour contracts, inadequate wages and excessive charges for the powder, coals and other materials supplied by the company.
The second dispute started in the summer of 1905 when members of a hostile crowd charged the quarry manager with autocratic, dictatorial and unfair behaviour towards both Dr. Grant and members of the quarrying labour force and the community.
A new company was formed in December 1907 and quarrying continued at Ballachulish until 1955.

==Sport==
=== Shinty===
Shinty is a popular local sport and the narrows is the traditional boundary of the north–south divide in shinty, with teams north of narrows playing in the North district&#x27;s competitions and those South playing in their respective competitions. Ballachulish Camanachd Club play in the South Leagues. However, Ballachulish is still considerably far North in relation to most of Scotland. The club has won the Camanachd Cup four times.

===Local Highland Games===
According to a report in The Oban Times in 1885, 

==Religion==
The former St John&#x27;s Episcopal Church, which replaced an earlier Episcopal church, is located to the west of the village. Its graveyard has an &quot;exceptional collection of 19th-century finely inscribed and carved&quot; gravestones made from Ballachulish slate. The Church of Scotland&#x27;s church was dedicated to St Munda. It was built in 1845 and closed in 2023.

<doc id="667570" wikidata="Q1770367" url="?curid=667570" title="SCADTA">
<text>Sociedad Colombo Alemana de Transportes Aéreos (SCADTA; ), was the world&#x27;s second airline, and the first airline in Latin America, operating from 1919 until World War II. After the war, SCADTA merged with Colombian regional carrier Colombian Air Service (), or SACO. Together, SCADTA and SACO formed Avianca - Aerovías Nacionales de Colombia, the Colombian flag-carrier. Avianca still operates to this day and claims SCADTA&#x27;s history as its own, thus making it the world&#x27;s second-oldest active airline, after KLM from the Netherlands.

==History==

SCADTA started out as a small airmail carrier using Junkers seaplanes capable of landing on Colombia&#x27;s Magdalena River, mostly since there were very few suitable landing strips in Colombia at the time. The German nationality of some of SCADTA&#x27;s owners motivated the United States government to subsidize Pan American World Airways&#x27; expansion in Latin America under the Hoover administration. SCADTA was barred from operating flights to the United States and the Panama Canal, although it continued to maintain a broad route network throughout the Andean region. The formation of Pan American-Grace Airways in the 1930s further eroded SCADTA&#x27;s position in the market. 

Prior to World War II, principal shareholder and Austrian industrialist Peter Paul von Bauer was forced by the US governments to sell his shares to the Pan American World Airways in an attempt to protect the airline from acquisition by Nazi Germany. Many of the airline&#x27;s pilots, technicians, and key administrators were German or Austrian, and even though most had lived in Colombia for several years, the United States was afraid that the SCADTA pilots were engaged in espionage, and could be plotting to convert civilian aircraft into bombers, in order to attack the Panama Canal.

The Colombian government was not concerned about SCADTA, though, and did not question the loyalty of the German pilots. However, restrictions were also placed on German pilots on how they could be utilized by an airline. For example, at least one pilot on every plane had to be Colombian.

Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in late 1941, SCADTA was forced to cease operations and its assets were merged by the Colombian government with the state-owned airline SACO, forming the modern Colombian national carrier: Avianca.

<doc id="667574" wikidata="Q1320589" url="?curid=667574" title="Pan American-Grace Airways">
<text>Pan American-Grace Airways, also known as Panagra, and dubbed &quot;The World&#x27;s Friendliest Airline&quot; was an airline formed as a joint venture between Pan American World Airways and Grace Shipping Company. On September 13, 1928, a small single-engine Fairchild airliner flew from Lima, Peru, to Talara, Peru, which marked not only the beginning of Pan American Grace Airways but also the inauguration of scheduled air transportation along the West Coast of South America. From this short flight in 1928 to nonstop flights from New York to South America with Douglas DC-8 Intercontinental Jets in 1966, Panagra became the standard-bearer for transportation between the US Mainland East Coast and the West Coast of South America for 39 years. The &quot;World&#x27;s Friendliest Airline&quot; merged with Braniff International Airways in 1967, and the combined carrier became the largest US airline serving South America.

==Formation of Pan American Grace Airways==
In June 1928, Pan American Airways Corporation, originally known as Aviation Corporation of the Americas, was formed to obtain the necessary capital to enable its operating subsidiary, Pan American, to bid for various foreign airmail contracts to Latin America. These contracts were soon to be announced by the US Postmaster General pursuant to the Foreign Air Mail Act of 1928 and Pan American believed that it would be ultimately conducting operations under any contracts that might be awarded.

Pan American was correct and during May and July 1928, the new company had three foreign airmail contracts bestowed for service to Latin America. Specifically, Pan American was awarded the contract for Foreign Air Mail Route (FAM) No. 5 for service between Miami and Panama in the Canal Zone. Interestingly, Pan American had already strategically decided that if it received FAM 5 then it would ask for extension services beyond the Canal Zone to and along the Western Coast of South America. The New York-based airline had also promulgated operating rights into Colombia, Panama, Ecuador and Peru, and had also purchase sufficient aircraft to operate the route system.

Aviation Corporation of America&#x27;s operating subsidiary, Pan American World Airways, operated only twelve aircraft with 100 employees, while AVCO&#x27;s entire capitalization was only US$3,775,000, at the end of 1928. The developments of 1928 introduced the auspices for the formation of a new company formed under the laws of Delaware. Pan American entered into an agreement with W. R. Grace and Company to operate airline operations into Peru, which was outlined in two letters of intent dated August 31, 1928, and September 7, 1928. Under this agreement, both companies subscribed to US$25000 of new capital stock in the new Panagra company, which would jointly study the possibility of operating air carrier and mail services between the Canal Zone and Valparaiso, Chile. If AVCO were to determine that it would be beneficial to bid on a mail contract for this type of service then W. R. Grace&#x27;s initial contribution would be treated as stock in the new company giving W. R. Grace the option to obtain an interest in the new venture not to exceed 50 percent of its capitalization.

Also, the agreement stated that Pan American would have full responsibility for the operation of the air carrier services, while W. R. Grace operations in cities along the proposed new route would act as agents for the new company, which was incorporated as Peruvian Airways Corporation. In September 1928, both companies contributed US$25,000 in capital to Peruvian Airways, forming a 50/50 partnership. On January 31, 1929, the US Postmaster General issued need for a contract for Foreign Air Mail Route No. 9, which would extend from Panama extending down the West Coast of South America to Santiago, Chile, with an option for the Postmaster General to offer extension services from Santiago across the lower belt of the Andes Mountains to Buenos Aires, Argentina, and beyond to Montevideo, Uruguay.

On February 21, 1929, Pan American World Airways and W. R. Grace and Company, the parent company to Grace Shipping at that time, announced the formation of Pan American Grace Airways, Inc., to bid on the new airmail contract. The new company bid on the contract and both partners subscribed US$500,000 each to the capitalization of the new Pan American Grace company, which also included the original amounts subscribed to the original operating entity, Peruvian Airways Corporation.

==First Scheduled Services==
Pan American and W. R. Grace&#x27;s new operating entity, Peruvian Airways Corporation, purchased its first aircraft on August 1, 1928. The new airliner, a Fairchild P-1 monoplane, featured a cabin for four passengers and was powered by a Wright Whirlwind engine with an output of 220 horsepower. Five weeks later on September 13, 1928, the new Fairchild P-1 inaugurated the first scheduled commercial flight along the West Coast of South America, with a nonstop flight from Lima, Peru, to Talara, Peru, carrying both passengers and mail.

The little Fairchild carried just a few letters and a full load of four passengers on the inaugural flight, which departed from a racetrack in Lima. Upon arrival in Talara, the legend-making airliner landed at an &quot;airport&quot; in Talara that was a soccer field. In spite of these drawbacks, Pan American Grace Airways first flight had been successfully completed without incident.

==Award of Panagra&#x27;s First Foreign Air Mail Contract==
Armed with a new Foreign Air Mail Act of March 2, 1929, which modified the 1928 Act by allowing the US Postmaster General to pay air carriers for transportation from foreign countries to the United States in addition to the outbound direction and the Postmaster-General could further amend Foreign Air Mail contracts issued via the Act of 1928 with the same new provisions. On the same date, the Postmaster General awarded Pan American Grace with Foreign Air Mail Contract No. 9.

It was an interesting fact that several other carriers had also bid on the new Route 9 and several had bid lower than Panagra. However, the Postmaster General noted that it was his discretion as to what carrier is ultimately selected. The Postmaster General stated that Pan American&#x27;s experience in the region put it well ahead of the other bidders and was therefore the lowest &quot;responsible bidder&quot; that could satisfactorily serve the needs of the government. It was found by the Postmaster-General that Pan American had spent two years in preparing for the new route down the West Coast of South America and the company&#x27;s successful operation of service in the Caribbean as well as the significance of the infrastructure already in place along the proposed routes along the West Coast that were in operation and in place by W. R. Grace and finally the financial abilities of Pan American and W. R. Grace played an additional significant role in the award.

==Inauguration of FAM Route 9==
On July 12, 1929, Pan American Grace inaugurated its first service over FAM Route 9. However, until the end of 1929, Pan American operated the route as far south as Guayaquil, Ecuador, which included the use of PAA aircraft and personnel.

==First Across the Andes==
On October 12, 1929, only 13 months after its first history-making first flight, Panagra inaugurated successful commercial flight across the Andes Mountains. Pan American Grace&#x27;s Ford Trimotor airliner departed Buenos Aires, Argentina, and headed toward Chile. The venerable Ford flew over the flat pampas and then landed at Mendoza, Argentina, where it refueled and prepared for the next leg of the trip.

Back in the air, the Trimotor crossed the Cordillera of the Andes and then through Uspallata Pass where it crossed at an unheard of altitude of 18,000 feet. Having left the Argentine capital city eight and one-half hours earlier, the aircraft landed at Santiago&#x27;s Los Cerrillos Airport.

==The Magna Carta of Aviation==

Braniff Airways Cofounder and President Thomas Elmer Braniff called the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938, the Magna Carta of Aviation because it revolutionized the entire industry into a cohesive whole that gave prominence to the air carriers in the United States. The Act, signed into law on June 23, 1938, transferred the responsibility of non-military aviation from the Bureau of Air Commerce to the newly formed Civil Aeronautics Agency to oversee the operation of all of the nation&#x27;s airlines including for economic reasons as well as safety needs and requirements. Airlines were now required to be issued a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity to prove that their service was viable to the nation&#x27;s air travel needs.

Upon enactment of the Act, it was immediately recommended that Pan American and Pan American Grace Airways be issued this certificate. Both carriers now operated a &quot;circle&quot; of service all the way around South America and their viability was more crucial than ever before. Pan American noted that the two carrier&#x27;s services were meant to be complementary rather than competitive and in nearly every instance they were. Specifically, a large percentage of Pan American&#x27;s traffic carried from the Canal Zone to the United States Mainland was as a result of flow-thru traffic from Pan American Grace destinations along the West Coast of South America to the Canal Zone and the same for Pan American Grace from Pan American&#x27;s southbound operations to the Canal Zone. Pan American-Grace received its certificate on 22 July 1940, backdated to 22 August 1938.

==Flying from the US to Buenos Aires in 1939==
Panagra&#x27;s network stretched from Panama and the U.S.-controlled Panama Canal Zone to Santiago, Chile and Buenos Aires. It was founded in 1929 to compete with SCADTA, a German-owned company, and held a quasi-monopoly over air travel in parts of Colombia and South America during the 1940s and 1950s.

In 1939, a passenger traveling from the U.S. to Buenos Aires would board a Pan Am Sikorsky S-42 flying boat at Miami and fly to Colon, Panama in the Canal Zone, stay overnight and then board a Panagra Douglas DC-2 or DC-3 and fly to Buenos Aires with overnight stops in Guayaquil, Arica and Santiago. This routing was a full day faster than the Pan Am service operated via the coast of Brazil. The one-way fare from Miami to Buenos Aires was US$550 ().After World War II, airliners could operate at night over South America, and in 1947 Panagra Douglas DC-6s made scheduled flights from Miami to Buenos Aires in 20 hours and 25 minutes.

Pan Am crewed the DC-6 south across the Caribbean to Albrook Field, near Balboa, Panama where Panagra flight crews took over. In 1949, Panagra flights serving Panama shifted to Tocumen Airport. In 1955, Panagra Douglas DC-6Bs and DC-7Bs began serving Washington DC and New York City with these flights being operated by National Airlines crews north of Miami. In 1957, the Panagra DC-7B service via Lima was several hours faster from New York Idlewild Airport (later renamed JFK Airport) to Buenos Aires than the Pan Am DC-7B service operated via Rio de Janeiro.

==Creating the Pan American Grace Juggernaut==
Invariably, the admitted complementary services of Pan American and Pan American Grace would begin to create situations that were on the verge of triggering anti-trust violations. It was the era of the late 1940s and a series of agreements between Pan American and Panagra that set in motion a battle that would not end until Pan American Grace merged with Braniff Airways in February 1967. In 1946, Pan American proposed to the Civil Aeronautics Board (formed 1940 to take over airline economic and route cases) that certain Pan American Grace aircraft would be chartered to PAA and operated by PAA over certain routes north of the Panama Canal Zone and more specifically between there and the Miami, Florida gateway. What this created was a convenient thru-plane service for passengers traveling between PAA and Panagra routes.

This agreement, known as the Through-Flight Agreement was approved by the CAB in 1947. Another key part of this agreement also provided for the eventual extension of this agreement beyond Miami to New York City should Pan American ever be approved to operate this particular route segment. Accordingly, in 1949, Pan American and Panagra entered into an agreement with Miami-based National Airlines, Inc., which enabled Pan American Grace Airways aircraft to be chartered to National for operation over its route between Miami and New York, thereby creating single-plane service from Buenos Aires to New York. National Airlines decided to leave the agreement in 1950 and PAA and Panagra then entered into a similar agreement with Miami-based Eastern Airlines over the same Miami-New York route. It was placed before the CAB in 1951 but ultimately, an &quot;interchange service&quot; agreement (see Transport hub) was awarded to Eastern and Braniff for thru-flights between New York and South America.

==The Panagra Road to Braniff Airways==
Panagra had been Braniff&#x27;s chief competitor along the South American West Coast since Braniff began serving the region in June 1948. Panagra&#x27;s history dated back to 1928, the same year that Braniff was first founded. The Airline was formed by the merger of Peruvian Airways and Chilean Airways. The new company, Pan American Grace Airways, Inc., was jointly and equally owned by both Pan American World Airways, Inc., and W. R. Grace and Company, the largest shipping company in South America.

As early as 1953, the Civil Aeronautics Board had recommended that Pan Am divest itself of Panagra, because of Pan Am&#x27;s decades-long control of air travel in the region and between US and Latin America. After years of failed negotiations between the two carriers, the mandate was finally fulfilled. Braniff President Charles Edmund Beard had negotiated an earlier agreement for Braniff to buy Panagra for US$22 million in 1964. Arrangements were made for Braniff to buy W. R. Grace&#x27;s half of Panagra for US$11 million with negotiations to continue into early 1965, for the purchase of Pan Am&#x27;s half of Panagra. A projected merger date was to have been late summer 1965 but Pan American&#x27;s legendary Founder and President Juan Terry Trippe did not accept Braniff&#x27;s offer. With the overhaul of Braniff&#x27;s management team in April 1965, the merger was further delayed until additional evaluation could be completed by the new management group.

Pan Am had been under pressure from the Civil Aeronautics Board, which had requested that the Justice Department file charges against Pan Am, to remedy antitrust problems that the carrier had become involved in by limiting the northward expansion of Panagra. Panagra only operated as far north as Panama and extended south along the West Coast of South America to cities such as Cali, Colombia, Quito and Guayaquil, Ecuador, Lima, Peru, La Paz, Bolivia, Antofagasta and Santiago, Chile and Buenos Aires, Argentina. Pan Am operated scheduled passenger flights north from Panama to Miami.

A New York Federal Court ruled that Pan Am was in violation of the Sherman Anti Trust Act by its actions in regard to limiting Panagra&#x27;s Northern expansion. The New York Court found that Panagra was not in violation of the antitrust act but that Pan Am was in violation and should divest itself of Panagra stock and its ownership. In 1963, the case was sent to the Supreme Court who ruled that the case fell under the jurisdiction of the CAB.
In December 1965, Braniff International successfully negotiated the purchase of W. R. Grace and Company&#x27;s 50-percent share in Panagra for US$15 million. Three months later on March 17, 1966, Braniff further completed an agreement to purchase Pan American World Airways&#x27;s 50-percent share in Panagra for the same amount. The plan was forwarded to the Civil Aeronautics Board who approved the merger agreement in July 1966.

==Panagra Merges with Braniff International==
On February 1, 1967, Braniff International merged with Pan American Grace Airways, also known by the trade name Panagra. Braniff purchased the 39-year-old South American West Coast airline for US$30 million from its two owners, W. R. Grace and Company and Pan American World Airways, Inc..
Braniff Executive Vice President Charles Edward Acker presented a check for US$15 million to W. R. Grace and Company Assistant General Council Walter Morris a month earlier in January 1967, which signaled the historic finalization of the merger between the two carriers. Earlier, Braniff had presented a check for US$15 million to Pan American World Airways for their one-half share in Panagra. With the payments in place, the merger was allowed to commence.

Braniff paid a very nominal amount for Panagra, which included a fleet of DC-8-31 jets along with prepaid deposits of $27 million on 5 ordered DC-8-62 Intercontinental Jets that were delivered to Braniff beginning in the summer of 1967. At the time of the 1964 merger negotiation, Panagra had not ordered the five Super 62 jetliners. The new negotiation figure of US$30 million did include the new jets and their handsome deposits, whereas the 1964 figure of US$22 million included the DC-8-31s and an aging fleet of propeller aircraft.

President Lyndon Baines Johnson approved the merger in October 1966, and on January 19, 1967, Braniff International completed the purchase agreement. The two carriers merged on February 1, 1967, and the combined airline operated 30 flights a week to South America. Braniff also acquired Panagra&#x27;s interest in the Peruvian airline Faucett.

Braniff Chairman of the Board of Directors Harding L. Lawrence held a press conference in New York City to announce the purchase of Panagra. Lawrence stated:This is perhaps the most significant development in air transportation between North and South America, since the advent of the jet aircraft. He further stated, &quot;On February 1, Braniff will merge the Latin American operations of Panagra with Braniff and begin the first combined service under the Braniff International name.&quot;

Lawrence emphasized that a quick integration of the two carriers would occur as well as a major reorganization for both companies. Months of intensive planning were completed and in place to begin a smooth transition that would emphasize leadership, the delegation of responsibilities, and effective utilization of the 9918 combined employees as a result of the merger.

==Service Highlights and Aircraft from the Merger==
New service that resulted from combining the two carriers, featured the first through-flights from San Francisco and Los Angeles to Lima and La Paz and Lima and Santiago that eliminated the need for a change of planes at Panama City. New nonstop service was also inaugurated between Santiago, Chile, and Miami, Florida, for the first time.

Prior to the merger, many of Braniff&#x27;s and Panagra&#x27;s flights departed at the same time but would now be equally spaced to provide more fluid and convenient schedules for Braniff passengers. Five US Gateways would also be used for the first time and included New York, Miami, Houston, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, which would allow service to be provided to South America from each major section of the US Mainland.

Braniff acquired seven used aircraft and five new aircraft orders as a result of the merger. The Panagra fleet included two Douglas DC-7B&#x27;s, one Douglas DC-8-55F (Freighter) Jet Trader, which was leased from Douglas in 1966, four Douglas DC-8-31s, and orders for five Douglas DC-8-62 Intercontinental Jets.
The Douglas DC-7B&#x27;s (N51703 and N51704) were quickly retired with only the four DC-8-31s and one Series -55 aircraft remaining in the Braniff system. The DC-8-31 aircraft were registered as N8274H, 8275H, 8276H, and N8277H with Panagra. Braniff reregistered N8274H as N1800, N8276H as N1801, and N8277H as N1802 with N8275 remaining as that registration during its service with Braniff.

==Painting the Panagra Fleet in Flying Colors==
The DC-8-55F Jet Trader was registered as N1590U and it was reregistered in Braniff&#x27;s name using that N number. All five DC-8 aircraft were initially left in the Green and Yellow Panagra Color Scheme but black Alexander Girard Braniff International titles were added down both sides of the fuselage replacing the Pan American Grace titles. The Panagra Feather Logo on the tail was replaced with a large Alexander Girard BI Logo in Black.

After May 1967, four of the DC-8&#x27;s were painted in the 1967 Alexander Girard/Harper and George Solid Color Scheme. N1800 was painted in Dark Panagra Green, N1801 in Orange, N1802 was painted in New Dark Blue, and the Jet Trader was painted in Orange. The DC-8-31 aircraft were quickly retired from the Braniff fleet as the new DC-8-62 Intercontinental Jets began delivery on August 22, 1967, through December 19, 1967. The Series -62 aircraft were never painted in a proposed Panagra Concept Color Scheme but were instead delivered in the updated 1967 Harper and George color palette for the Girard Solid Color Scheme. Harper and George used the Panagra DC-8 Concept Color Scheme Green and Yellow colors as inspiration for the Panagra Green and Panagra Yellow Solid colors.

==First Jet Service in South America==
Panagra entered the jet age in 1960 when it introduced new Douglas DC-8-31 jetliners.

According to the Panagra system timetable dated July 15, 1966, the airline was operating DC-8 &quot;El Inter Americano&quot; jet service between various destinations in Latin America and Los Angeles (Los Angeles International Airport), Miami (MIA), New York City (JFK) and San Francisco (San Francisco International Airport). Panagra was still cooperating with National Airlines and Pan American World Airways with regard to their service between the U.S. and Latin America at this time. This timetable listed the following destinations served by Panagra in Central and South America: Antofagasta, Chile; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Cali, Colombia; Guayaquil, Ecuador; La Paz, Bolivia; Lima, Peru; Panama City, Panama; Quito, Ecuador; and Santiago, Chile.
==Braniff&#x27;s South America Routes after 1983==
Panagra merged with Braniff International Airways in 1967. Braniff operated the former Panagra routes to South America until 1982 when Eastern Air Lines purchased Braniff&#x27;s South American operations. Beginning in 1990, these routes were then operated by American Airlines which had acquired them from Eastern.

==New Panagra Startup==
The Panagra name was resurrected during the late 1990s when a new airline which billed itself as Panagra Airways operating Boeing 727-200 jetliners.
==Pan American Grace Airways Intellectual Property==
Pan American Grace Airways and Panagra&#x27;s intellectual property is currently owned by Braniff Airways, Inc., and is administered by Braniff Airways Foundation, in Dallas, Texas. All Pan American Grace Airways posters were created by J. W. Thompson Agency at the Airline&#x27;s Lima, Peru, offices. These posters, similar to Braniff&#x27;s mid-century themed posters, which were also produced in South America, are not in the public domain but have undergone copyright restoration in the United States.

<text>Lucky imaging (also called lucky exposures) is one form of speckle imaging used for astrophotography. Speckle imaging techniques use a high-speed camera with exposure times short enough (100 ms or less) so that the changes in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere during the exposure are minimal.

With lucky imaging, those optimum exposures least affected by the atmosphere (typically around 10%) are chosen and combined into a single image by shifting and adding the short exposures, yielding much higher angular resolution than would be possible with a single, longer exposure, which includes all the frames.

== Explanation ==
Images taken with ground-based telescopes are subject to the blurring effect of atmospheric turbulence (seen to the eye as the stars twinkling). Many astronomical imaging programs require higher resolution than is possible without some correction of the images. Lucky imaging is one of several methods used to remove atmospheric blurring. Used at a 1% selection or less, lucky imaging can reach the diffraction limit of even 2.5 m aperture telescopes, a resolution improvement factor of at least five over standard imaging systems.

==Demonstration of the principle==
The sequence of images below shows how lucky imaging works. From a series of 50,000 images taken at a speed of almost 40 images per second, five different long exposure images have been created. Additionally, a single exposure with very low image quality and another single exposure with very high image quality are shown at the beginning of the demo sequence. The astronomical target shown has the 2MASS ID J03323578+2843554. North is up and East on the left.
The difference between the seeing limited image (third image from top) and the best 1% images selected result is quite remarkable: a triple system has been detected. The brightest component in the West is a V=14.9 magnitude M4V star. This component is the lucky imaging reference source. The weaker component consists of two stars of spectral classes M4.5 and M5.5. The distance of the system is about 45 parsecs (pc). Airy rings can be seen, which indicates that the diffraction limit of the Calar Alto Observatory&#x27;s 2.2 m telescope was reached. The signal to noise ratio of the point sources increases with stronger selection. The seeing halo on the other side is more suppressed. The separation between the two brightest objects is around 0.53 arcsec and between the two faintest objects less than 0.16 arcsec. At a distance of 45 pc this corresponds to 7.2 times the distance between Earth and Sun, around 1 billion kilometers (109 km).

==History==

Lucky imaging methods were first used in the middle 20th century, and became popular for imaging planets in the 1950s and 1960s (using cine cameras, often with image intensifiers). For the most part it took 30 years for the separate imaging technologies to be perfected for this counter-intuitive imaging technology to become practical. The first numerical calculation of the probability of obtaining &quot;lucky exposures&quot; was an article by David L. Fried in 1978.

In early applications of lucky imaging, it was generally assumed that the atmosphere &quot;smeared-out&quot; or &quot;blurred&quot; the astronomical images. In that work, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the blurring was estimated, and used to select exposures. Later studies took advantage of the fact that the atmosphere does not &quot;blur&quot; astronomical images, but generally produces multiple sharp copies of the image (the point spread function has &quot;speckles&quot;). New methods were used which took advantage of this to produce much higher quality images than had been obtained assuming the image to be &quot;smeared&quot;.

In the early years of the 21st century, it was realised that turbulent intermittency (and the fluctuations in astronomical seeing conditions it produced) could substantially increase the probability of obtaining a &quot;lucky exposure&quot; for given average astronomical seeing conditions.

==Lucky imaging and adaptive optics hybrid systems==
In 2007 astronomers at Caltech and the University of Cambridge announced the first results from a new hybrid lucky imaging and adaptive optics (AO) system. The new camera gave the first diffraction-limited resolutions on 5 m-class telescopes in visible light. The research was performed on the Mt. Palomar Hale Telescope of 200-inch-diameter aperture. The telescope, with lucky cam and adaptive optics, pushed it near its theoretical angular resolution, achieving up to 0.025 arc seconds for certain types of viewing.
Compared to space telescopes like the 2.4 m Hubble, the system still has some drawbacks including a narrow field of view for crisp images (typically 10&quot; to 20&quot;), airglow, and electromagnetic frequencies blocked by the atmosphere.

When combined with an AO system, lucky imaging selects the periods when the turbulence the adaptive optics system must correct is reduced. In these periods, lasting a small fraction of a second, the correction given by the AO system is sufficient to give excellent resolution with visible light. The lucky imaging system averages the images taken during the excellent periods to produce a final image with much higher resolution than is possible with a conventional long-exposure AO camera.

This technique is applicable to getting very high resolution images of only relatively small astronomical objects, up to 10 arcseconds in diameter, as it is limited by the precision of the atmospheric turbulence correction. It also requires a relatively bright 14th-magnitude star in the field of view on which to guide. Being above the atmosphere, the Hubble Space Telescope is not limited by these concerns and so is capable of much wider-field high-resolution imaging.

==Popularity of technique==
Both amateur and professional astronomers have begun to use this technique. Modern webcams and camcorders have the ability to capture rapid short exposures with sufficient sensitivity for astrophotography, and these devices are used with a telescope and the shift-and-add method from speckle imaging (also known as image stacking) to achieve previously unattainable resolution. If some of the images are discarded, then this type of video astronomy is called lucky imaging.

Many methods exist for image selection, including the Strehl-selection method first suggested by John E. Baldwin from the Cambridge group and the image contrast selection used in the Selective Image Reconstruction method of Ron Dantowitz.

The development and availability of electron-multiplying CCDs (EMCCD, also known as LLLCCD, L3CCD, or low-light-level CCD) has allowed the first high-quality lucky imaging of faint objects.

On October 27, 2014, Google introduced a similar technique called HDR+. HDR+ takes a burst of shots with short exposures, selectively aligning the sharpest shots and averaging them using computational photography techniques. Short exposures avoid blurry images or blowing out highlights, and averaging multiple shots reduces noise. HDR+ is processed on hardware accelerators including the Qualcomm Hexagon DSPs and Pixel Visual Core.

==Alternative methods==
Other approaches that can yield resolving power exceeding the limits of atmospheric seeing include adaptive optics, interferometry, other forms of speckle imaging and space-based telescopes such as NASA&#x27;s Hubble Space Telescope.

<text>The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution (AdTI) was a Washington, D.C.–based think tank.

AdTI was named after the French historian Alexis de Tocqueville. Founded in 1988, its president was Ken Brown and its chairman was Gregory Fossedal. At its peak it had 14 full-time staff researchers. In 2006, the organization ceased most operations, issuing its last press release in 2007 to announce that its former chairman, Mike Gravel, was running for President of the United States.

==Activities==
===Intellectual property studies===
The AdTI published a series of studies beginning in 2002 on the theme of intellectual property in the software industry. The Institution authored &quot;Opening the Open Source Debate&quot; (June 2002), a report critical of Microsoft&#x27;s open-source rivals. This report claimed that open source software was inherently less secure than proprietary software and hence a particular target for terrorists.

These studies culminated in &quot;&quot; (prereleased May 2004), questioning the generally accepted provenance of Linux and other open source projects, and recommending that government-funded programming should never be licensed under the GNU General Public License but under the BSD license or similar licenses. While the book called for increased investment in open source development, it criticized what it called &quot;hybrid&quot; source models, in which true open source code is mixed with proprietary code, with the result that intellectual property rights are nullified.

To illustrate potential problems with this approach, the book cited the case of Linus Torvalds, creator of Linux. It claimed Torvalds used source code taken from Minix, a small Unix-like operating system used in teaching computer science, to create Linux 0.01, on the theory that no mere student could write an entire Unix-like kernel single-handedly—although writing a kernel of similar size and capabilities is a standard part of many computer science degrees. These claims have been seriously questioned, including by many of those quoted in support, such as Andrew S. Tanenbaum, author of Minix; Dennis Ritchie, one of the creators of Unix; and Richard Stallman, leader of the GNU project. Others have said that quotes attributed as being from an &quot;interview with AdTI&quot; were in fact from prerelease papers (Ilkka Tuomi) or from message board posts (Charles Mills, Henry Jones). Alexey Toptygin said he had been commissioned by Brown to find similarities between Minix and Linux 0.01 source code, and found no support for the theory that Minix source code had been used to create Linux; this study is not mentioned in the book.

It cited a number of arguments for the claim, including an email from Tanenbaum saying MINIX &quot;was the base&quot; Torvalds used to create Linux. Tanenbaum later published a refutation of the book&#x27;s interpretation, wherein he recounted an interview with Ken Brown while the latter was researching the book, during which Tanenbaum had emphatically stated his belief that Torvalds wrote Linux single-handedly and provided examples of other people or small teams who had performed similar feats in the past.

The AdTI was preparing a new study in November 2004, tentatively titled &quot;Intellectual Property Left&quot;, to argue that &quot;the IT industry sector&#x27;s reluctance to pursue rampant IP infringement against public domain software developers and users is going to precipitate billions of dollars in balance sheet downgrades by Wall Street.&quot;
The later papers stand in contrast to the Institution&#x27;s 2000 paper, &quot;The Market Place Should Rule on Technology&quot;, which discusses Linux as a direct competitor to Microsoft Windows.

===Other publications===

The AdTI produced a number of papers on education policy.

When the B-2 bomber program was threatened in 1995, the AdTI organised a letter to President Bill Clinton signed by seven former Pentagon chiefs: Dick Cheney, Caspar Weinberger, Frank Carlucci, Harold Brown, James Schlesinger, Donald Rumsfeld and Melvin Laird. 

The AdTI published Newt Gingrich&#x27;s 2003 book, &quot;Saving Lives &amp; Saving Money: Transforming Health and Healthcare&quot;.

AdTI was a member organization of the Cooler Heads Coalition which asserts that &quot;the science of global warming is uncertain&quot; and is focused on &quot;dispelling the myths of global warming by exposing flawed economic, scientific, and risk analysis&quot;.

==Funding==
Microsoft had been one of the Institution&#x27;s backers for five years, although a Microsoft spokesman said they had not funded any specific research.

<text>Michael Lawson Bishop (November 12, 1945 – November 13, 2023) was an American author. Over five decades and in more than thirty books, he created what has been called a &quot;body of work that stands among the most admired and influential in modern science fiction and fantasy literature.&quot;

==Biography==
Michael Lawson Bishop was born on November 12, 1945, in Lincoln, Nebraska, the son of Leotis &quot;Lee&quot; Bishop and Maxine (&quot;Mac&quot;) Elaine Matison. His parents met in the summer of 1942 when his father, a recent enlistee of the Army Air Corps, was stationed in Lincoln. Bishop&#x27;s childhood was the peripatetic life of a military brat. He went to kindergarten in Tokyo, Japan, and he spent his senior year of high school in Seville, Spain. His parents divorced in 1951, and Bishop spent summers wherever his father happened to be based.

Bishop entered the University of Georgia in 1963, receiving his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1967, before going on to complete a master&#x27;s degree in English in 1968. In 1969, he married Jeri Ellis Whitaker of Columbus, Georgia. He taught English (including a course in science fiction) at the United States Air Force Academy Preparatory School in Colorado Springs from 1968 to 1972. After his service career, he taught composition and English literature at the University of Georgia in Athens. A son, Jamie, was born in 1971, and a daughter, Stephanie was born in 1973. Bishop left teaching in 1974 to become a full-time writer. In those early years of freelance writing, he would occasionally work as a substitute teacher in the public schools and as a stringer for the Ledger-Enquirer in Columbus.

In 1996, Bishop became writer-in-residence at LaGrange College located near his home (built in the 1890s) in Pine Mountain, Georgia. Bishop taught creative-writing courses and an occasional January interim-term course. He held this position until Spring 2012.

Bishop identified as a Christian.

Michael and Jeri, former counselor at Rosemont Elementary School, had two grandchildren, Annabel and Joel, by their daughter Stephanie. On April 16, 2007, their son Jamie, a lecturer in German and I.T. Studies, became one of the victims of the Virginia Tech shooting. Bishop and his wife subsequently advocated for stricter gun laws in the United States.

Bishop died from cancer at a hospice facility in LaGrange, Georgia, on November 13, 2023, one day after his 78th birthday.

==Career overview==
Bishop was twice awarded the Nebula: in 1981 for &quot;The Quickening&quot; (Best Novelette) and in 1982 for &quot;No Enemy But Time&quot; (Best Novel). He also received four Locus Awards and his work has been nominated for numerous Hugo Awards. In July 2009, &quot;The Pile&quot; was the recipient of the Shirley Jackson Award for Best Short Story of 2008.

In 1993, 20th Century Fox optioned his novel &quot;Brittle Innings&quot; for a film and bought the rights outright in 1995. (To date, no film has been made.)

Bishop published fifteen solo novels, three collaborative novels, and more than 150 pieces of short fiction, most of which have been gathered into eleven collections. A major career retrospective collection, &quot;The Door Gunner and Other Perilous Flights of Fancy&quot; was published in February 2012 by Subterranean Press. His stories have appeared in such publications as &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;, &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;, &quot;Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction Magazine&quot;, the &quot;Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;, the &quot;Missouri Review&quot;, the &quot;Indiana Review&quot;, the &quot;Chattahoochee Review&quot;, the &quot;Georgia Review&quot;, &quot;Omni&quot;, and &quot;Interzone&quot;. His work has been translated into more than a dozen languages.
Bishop edited seven anthologies, including the Locus Award-winning &quot;Light Years and Dark&quot; and &quot;A Cross of Centuries: Twenty-five Imaginative Tales about the Christ&quot;, published by Thunder&#x27;s Mouth Press in 2007. His latest anthology, &quot;Passing for Human&quot;, was co-edited with Steven Utley and published by PS Publishing in 2009.
In addition to his fiction, Bishop published poetry (gathered in two collections) and won the 1979 Rhysling Award for his poem &quot;For the Lady of a Physicist.&quot; He also had essays and reviews published in numerous newspapers and magazines, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot;, the &quot;Columbus Ledger-Enquirer&quot;, &quot;Omni Magazine&quot;, and the &quot;New York Review of Science Fiction&quot;. A collection of his nonfiction, &quot;A Reverie for Mister Ray&quot;, was published in 2005 by PS Publishing.
Bishop and British author Ian Watson collaborated on a novel set in the universe of one of Bishop&#x27;s earlier works. He also wrote two mystery novels with Paul Di Filippo, under the joint pseudonym Philip Lawson. Bishop&#x27;s collaboration with Steven Utley, the short story &quot;The City Quiet as Death&quot;, was published in June 2009 on Tor.com.

Bishop wrote introductions to books by Philip K. Dick, Theodore Sturgeon, James Tiptree, Jr., Pamela Sargent, Gardner Dozois, Lucius Shepard, Mary Shelley, Andy Duncan, Paul Di Filippo, Bruce Holland Rogers, and Rhys Hughes.
Bishop was Guest of Honor at more than a dozen science fiction conventions including the 1977 DeepSouthCon, the 1978 Philcon, the 1992 Readercon, the 1992 World Fantasy Convention, the 1999 World Horror Convention, the 2005 Norwescon, the 2009 Science Fiction Research Association Conference, and Special Guest at the 2010 ArmadilloCon. He was also one of the organizers of the three &quot;Slipstreaming in the Arts&quot; conferences (1997–2001). In 2001, he was given an Honorary Doctorate of Humanities from LaGrange College. In May 2013, he was the Guest of Honor at Italcon 39, the Italian national convention of fantastic literature.

===Early work===
Michael Bishop&#x27;s first published professional fiction sale was the short story &quot;Piñon Fall&quot; to Galaxy Science Fiction in 1970. It was shortly followed by &quot;If a Flower Could Eclipse&quot;, the first story in his Urnu sequence, Bishop&#x27;s longest and most significant series of related stories. His shorter series, Glaktik Komm, in the subgenre of anthropological science fiction, consists of two short stories and two novels published in the late 1970s. While &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; and &quot;If&quot; magazines were publishing his science-fiction stories, the &quot;Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot; became Bishop&#x27;s venue for his fantasy/horror stories. This early period is also noted for a number of high-profile novellas: in 1973 &quot;Death and Designation Among the Asadi&quot; and &quot;The White Otters of Childhood&quot; appeared on the shortlist ballots for both the Hugo and Nebula awards. The 1974 gonzo novella &quot;On the Street of the Serpents&quot; (including a character named &quot;Michael Bishop&quot;) first appeared in an anthology of original stories. It would eventually lead to a contract for his first novel from Ballantine Books, the anthology&#x27;s publisher.

===Anthropological novels===
Six of Bishop&#x27;s first eight novels are set on other worlds (the other two are the part of his UrNu sequence of stories.) Critic and author John Clute writes that &quot;…his early stories and novels display considerable intellectual complexity, and do not shirk the downbeat implications of their anthropological treatment of aliens and alienating milieux…&quot; In his major essay on these early novels, author Ian Watson writes &quot;Michael Bishop is both an exoticist and a moralist. He is sometimes guilty, in the first respect, of a certain over-writing – underlying exotic venue by exotic diction – though the two become more organically integrated as his work progresses; and in the second respect of what one might call an over-scrupulousness on the part of his characters and his perceived attitude to them… These, however, are merely the consequence of aspiration and conscience; and as more of Bishop&#x27;s work has appeared – and his reputation has grown – he has shown…a more coherent melding of exotic vision, ethics and style.&quot;

====&quot;A Funeral for the Eyes of Fire&quot;====
When Bishop&#x27;s first novel, &quot;A Funeral for the Eyes of Fire&quot;, was published by Ballantine Books in 1975, critics Alexei and Cory Panshin wrote that the novel &quot;shows an interest in the anthropological comparable to Ursula K. Le Guin and a sense of the alien comparable to James Tiptree, Jr. But it is an individual work, Bishop&#x27;s own and no one else&#x27;s. &quot;A Funeral for the Eyes of Fire&quot; is highly imperfect. It is a pied mirror, everywhere reflecting brilliantly bright, everywhere cloudy. It leads the eyes inward, and ultimately reveals nothing clearly. Even so, it is the most impressive first novel so far seen in the Seventies.&quot; They go on to declare that &quot;Bishop is one of the new and still rare breed of science fiction writer attempting to produce art without rejecting the pulp vigor that is science fiction&#x27;s continuing strengths.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PanshinFSF08/75&quot;&gt;Panshin, Alexei and Cory Panshin. &quot;Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;, Cornwall CT: Mercury Press. Aug. 1975: 49.&lt;/ref&gt; The novel was nominated for a Nebula Award in 1975.

====&quot;And Strange at Ecbatan the Trees&quot;====
Bishop&#x27;s second novel (and first hardcover publication) takes its title from Archibald MacLeish&#x27;s poem &quot;You, Andrew Marvell&quot;. Published by Harper &amp; Row in 1976, it is set in the same far future as his Hugo- and Nebula-nominated novella &quot;The White Otters of Childhood.&quot; There are two surviving races, both genetically engineered by a third, the Parfects, who also manipulate the ongoing struggle between them. Richard A. Lupoff praised the novel lavishly, calling it &quot;An eccentric, accomplished performance; and impressive and admirable one . . . a delightful book, a new treatment of a somewhat familiar theme, but crafted into a strange shape and told with such fineness of presence and such impressive language that it hardly matters what the book is about.&quot; Reviewer Keith L. Justice writes &quot;If Bishop never published another word of fiction, he would still have to be considered a milestone writer in the development of contemporary sf… Writers such as Le Guin, Tiptree, and Bishop are developing a whole new generation of artistry.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;JusticeDelap02/78&quot;&gt;Justice, Keith L. &quot;Paperbacks.&quot; &quot;Delap&#x27;s F&amp;SF Review&quot;, Dragonwood Press. Feb 1978: 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

====&quot;Stolen Faces&quot;====
In &quot;Stolen Faces&quot; (published by Harper &amp; Row in 1977), a recently demoted commissioner has been reassigned to a colony planet to govern a compound which isolates the sufferers of a leprosy-like disease. Ian Watson writes that the novel is &quot;about deceit, maskedness and discovery of self-truth…a harsh, arctic tale by contrast with [&quot;And Strange at Ecbatan the Trees&quot;] where the terrain may be stark but there is a mannered elegance in the tone of voice; it is a tale executed in an argot-ritualistic style.&quot; Critic Richard Delap writes &quot;There is an abundance of exploitable elements in Bishop&#x27;s story, so it is astonishing to see how the author keeps them under strict rein, always with a highly keyed visual sense but also with a literary flair that says more by implication than by direct description. The writing itself is crafted with a precision that becomes obvious only as the novel progresses.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DelapFSF10/775&quot;&gt;Delap, Richard. &quot;Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;. Cornwall CT: Mercury Press. Oct. 1977: 36-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

====&quot;Transfigurations&quot;====
The Hugo- and Nebula-nominated novella &quot;Death and Designation Among the Asadi&quot; forms the first part of &quot;Transfigurations&quot;, a novel published in 1979 by Berkley Putnam. The story continues when the daughter of the anthropologist who studied the Asadi, a hominid-like race on the planet Bosk&#x27;veld, investigates his disappearance. In the journal &quot;Foundation&quot;, John Clute writes that the novel is &quot;a fever of explanation. Hypothesis builds on hypothesis [as more and more data is added to the original observations], and much of the resulting construction is beautifully crafted, almost hallucinatory it is so plausible. But of course these explanations are never enough – and the intellectual tact by which Bishop makes them almost &quot;but not quite&quot; fit the data they are meant to make transparent is perhaps the strongest part of this extremely dense and carefully thought-through novel.&quot; Theodore Sturgeon writes &quot;Michael Bishop&#x27;s &quot;Transfigurations&quot; is as complex, as carefully thought-out, and as compelling an sf novel as you&#x27;ll find anywhere, ever.&quot; &quot;Transfigurations&quot; was nominated for the British Science Fiction Association Award in 1980.

====&quot;Eyes of Fire&quot;====
In 1980, Bishop was given the unusual opportunity by editor David Hartwell to rewrite his first novel. This completely revised version (or, as Bishop called it, wholesale &quot;reimagining&quot;) was published by Pocket Books as &quot;Eyes of Fire&quot;. In his introduction to the British hardcover edition of the revised work, Bishop writes &quot;…I still feel affection for the original version of &quot;A Funeral for the Eyes of Fire&quot;, its callow narrator, and a few of the flavorful images and metaphors with which I salted the text. But I also recognize the fumble-fingeredness and immaturity of that initial version.&quot; Very few publications (mostly fanzines) took enough notice to review the new version. (Pocket Books even used the artwork of the original publisher&#x27;s edition.) In one of the rare reviews, Robert Frazier writes &quot;In almost every detail, &quot;Eyes of Fire&quot; is crafted intelligently… It is not the type of sf that pushes to the heights of wonder. Instead it is a probing, disturbing, moving reflection on humanity… Bishop&#x27;s skill is at plumbing to the depths, and his basic tool is a two-way glass. [Other novels this year] will have to go a long distance to surpass this effort.&quot;

====&quot;Under Heaven&#x27;s Bridge&quot;====
When British author Ian Watson read Bishop&#x27;s &quot;A Little Knowledge&quot; (1977), he was so fascinated with the alien Cygnusians that he wrote to inquire whether Bishop had plans to write a story about the aliens&#x27; home planet. Thus began what Bishop calls &quot;the first ever science fiction collaboration&quot;, with all correspondence sent by post. Although often labeled as the third book in the series, it is not truly part of the main UrNu sequence. In this novel, published in the UK by Gollancz (1981) and in the US by Ace Books (1982), a Japanese linguist, crewmember of the research starship &quot;Heavenbridge&quot;, arrives on the home planet of the Kybers (so-called because they&#x27;re seemingly made of flesh and metal.) She soon learns that the planet&#x27;s sun will shortly go nova. Brian Stableford writes that the novel when compared with other recent sf collaborations &quot;is a very solid and rewarding piece of work. Its basic premise is original and intelligently worked-out, and the storyline sustains the fascination of the reader throughout. Nevertheless, it seems to me to fall slightly behind the standard set by recent solo works by either of the two authors.&quot; He concludes that the &quot;book is worth reading, but it is not an outstanding work in either author&#x27;s canon.&quot; This is Michael Bishop&#x27;s last novel-length work of other worlds fiction.

===UrNu sequence===
With &quot;If a Flower Could Eclipse&quot; (1970), his second published story, Bishop began a series of stories set in the Urban Nucleus of Atlanta, one of several domed cities in his future history. Over the next decade he would write seven stories of varying length and one novel to fill in the century-long chronology. Some of the stories first appeared in such prestigious anthology series as Damon Knight&#x27;s &quot;Orbit&quot; and Terry Carr&#x27;s &quot;Universe&quot;. Four of the stories would subsequently be chosen for best-of-the-year anthologies. (N.B.: According to the author&#x27;s website &quot;A Funeral for the Eyes of Fire&quot; and &quot;Under Heaven&#x27;s Bridge&quot; are only tangentially connected to the series and thus not part of the sequence proper.)

In 2019, all of the works in this series, including two short stories, a novelette, four novellas, and a novel, were revised, sequenced, and published as &quot;The City and the Cygnets&quot; with an introduction by Kelly Robson, revised chronology and interstitial material, and a new afterword by the author.

====&quot;A Little Knowledge&quot;====
The only novel-length work in the UrNu sequence, &quot;A Little Knowledge&quot;, was published in 1977 by Berkley/Putnam. Chronologically, its events fall just before the last story in the series, &quot;Death Rehearsals&quot;. The alien Cygnusians that first appeared in the novella &quot;Allegiances&quot; have been brought into the domed city of Atlanta, causing quite a stir when one of them converts to the state sponsored religion. Mary S. Weinkauf writes &quot;…this is a cleverly done book with many elements of previously admired sf…although it is maneuvered by too carefully contrived coincidences and leaves some questions at the end… [It] is a book to think about long after you put it down.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WeinkaufDelap02/78&quot;&gt;Weinkauf, Mary S. &quot;Fiction.&quot; &quot;Delap&#x27;s F&amp;SF Review&quot;, Dragonwood Press. Feb 1978: 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Delap writes that &quot;characters…scurry through this shifting maze as if they are buffeted by the social and political activities of this future world rather than by an author plotting to reach a predestined conclusion. &quot;A Little Knowledge&quot; is a lively, thought-provoking novel that will exercise your brain.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DelapFSF10/77&quot;&gt;Delap, Richard. &quot;Books.&quot; &quot;Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;, Cornwall CT: Mercury Press. Oct. 1977: 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

====&quot;Catacomb Years&quot;====

All of the previously published stories in Bishop&#x27;s UrNu sequence, along with a new novella, &quot;Death Rehearsals&quot;, are contained in &quot;Catacomb Years&quot;, a fix-up published in 1979 by Berkley/Putnam. Bishop also wrote new connecting material and provided a timeline.

===Later novels===

====&quot;No Enemy But Time&quot;====

Bishop&#x27;s critically acclaimed novel, the Nebula Award winning &quot;No Enemy But Time&quot;, was published in 1982 by Simon &amp; Schuster under David Hartwell&#x27;s editorship and the Timescape imprint. John Clute writes that the novel &quot;intensified the movement of [Bishop&#x27;s] imagination to a local habitat, and for the first time introduced a protagonist of sufficient racial (and mental) complexity to carry a storyline immured in the particular and haunted by the exotic.&quot; In this sophisticated twist on the traditional time-travel story, a modern-day African-American man is recruited by the military for his special ability to &quot;dream&quot; himself into the Pleistocene era where he becomes involved with a tribe of habilines. Thomas Disch writes &quot;Bishop is determined to write about human goodness without resorting to the mock heroics of formula adventure stories. There are no villains in the book, even among the habilines. The central and absorbing drama of the book is the hero&#x27;s growing love for the habiline, Helen. Looming behind this love story is a larger theme, the formation across the entire span of history of the Family of Man, a phrase that becomes, as the novel ripens to its conclusion, no mere liberal piety but a fully realized dramatic affirmation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DischTZ06/82&quot;&gt;Disch, Thomas M. &quot;Other Dimensions: Books.&quot; &quot;Rod Serling&#x27;s Twilight Zone Magazine&quot;, June 1982: 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In one of the few mixed reviews, Tom Easton writes that &quot;Kampa [the protagonist] is the only character who does come alive. All others are at least stiff. Some are outright caricatures. The book is not faultless, but it &quot;is&quot; overall a pleasure to read… Its treatment of anthropology is so effective that the few flaws are easily overlooked.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EastonAnalog09/82&quot;&gt;Easton, Tom. &quot;The Reference Library.&quot; &quot;Analog: Science Fiction/Science Fact&quot;. New York: Davis Publications. Sep. 1982: 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Editor and critic David Pringle writes that the novel &quot;is narrated in an oddly detached, quizzical and dryly humorous manner… The paleo-anthropological details are superbly imagined, the African landscapes beautifully described, yet the final effect is one of coolness, distance… Michael Bishop&#x27;s prose style is learned, witty, Latinate, although salted with placed colloquialisms and low jokes. This book is the work of a talented and serious writer.&quot; In addition to winning the Nebula Award, the novel was nominated for both the John W. Campbell Memorial and British Science Fiction Awards.

====&quot;Who Made Stevie Crye?&quot;====

Bishop followed-up his award-winning science fiction novel with a contemporary novel set in the rural American South. Mary Stevenson (&quot;Stevie&quot;) Crye is a young widow with two children struggling to take care of her family as a freelance writer. Her typewriter has started to act up, automatically transcribing her nightmares and subsequently her future. The only American edition of &quot;Who Made Stevie Crye?&quot; was published in 1984 by the highly esteemed specialty publisher Arkham House under the editorship of Jim Turner. This original edition, as well as the British edition, was photographically illustrated by J. K. Potter. When David Pringle chose it for inclusion in his book &quot;Modern Fantasy: The 100 Best Novels&quot;, he described the novel as &quot;a playful metafiction about the real and the fictitious, about the writer and his or her creation…&quot; and concluded that the novel is &quot;…a gripping and intelligent tale of the supernatural by an author who is adept at avoiding most of the clichés of the horror genre.&quot; In his mixed review of the novel, Joe Sanders writes &quot;Sometimes vivid, sometimes prosaic; sometimes involving but often affectless, this is not a novel to like casually. Even when it looks like standard mass-produced pop lit, it actually is nudging us toward something more disturbing and hilarious than we&#x27;re comfortable imagining. It finally is impressive enough to be uneasily recommended.&quot; Sanders&#x27; editor, Robert A. Collins, chides the reviewer with the footnote &quot;Ignore Sanders&#x27; uneasiness, which obviously stems from his difficulty in pegging the book&#x27;s genre; &quot;Stevie Crye&quot; is a marvelous book which transcends genre, as all the best of Bishop does.&quot; Author Ian Watson writes &quot;Here is a humane, trickster kaleidoscope questioning a genre and a market, and fiction, and reality too – yet exquisitely spiced with human reality – and delivering the eerie chill of the occult and the illicit, curdling the blood but also warming the heart.&quot;

====&quot;Ancient of Days&quot;====
Bishop&#x27;s 1983 Locus Award-winning novella &quot;Her Habiline Husband&quot; forms the first third of &quot;Ancient of Days&quot;, published in 1985 by Arbor House. It is the story of &quot;Adam&quot;, one of the last surviving &quot;Homo habilis&quot;, who is discovered in contemporary Georgia. In this thematic companion to his novel &quot;No Enemy But Time&quot; (with an almost inverse conceit), Bishop tackles issues of racial and cultural prejudice, and explores the question of what it means to be human. &quot;Locus&quot; reviewer Debbie Notkin writes &quot;This is science fiction so precise and so well-thought-out that it reads like history, although little history is so well-written, or cares so much about its characters.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Locus05/85&quot;&gt;Notkin, Debbie. &quot;&quot;Locus&quot; Looks at More Books.&quot; &quot;Locus&quot;, May 1985: 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard Goodman of &quot;Fantasy Review&quot; believes that &quot;Bishop&#x27;s theme of evil inherent in humanity echoes William Golding,&quot; and that the novel &quot;in some ways…parallels Golding&#x27;s &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;FR06/85&quot;&gt;Goodman, Bernard. &quot;News and Reviews.&quot; &quot;Fantasy Review&quot; 80, June 1985: 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Author Samuel R. Delany writes &quot;A wonder-filled novel of ideas—ideas that include questions of race, science, art, and spirituality, among many others. Bishop dramatizes each of these with a panache and a narrative energy that are a delight to read and dazzling to watch.&quot; &quot;Ancient of Days&quot; was nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1988.

====&quot;Philip K. Dick Is Dead, Alas&quot;====
Originally published as &quot;The Secret Ascension&quot; by Tor Books in 1987 (but subsequently reprinted with the author&#x27;s preferred title), this work is an homage to writer Philip K. Dick, a pastiche of his style, and includes an alternate reality version of Dick as a character. The novel is set in a world in which Richard &quot;Milrose&quot; Nixon, in his fourth term as president, holds fascistic control over America, and the science fiction works of Philip K. Dick remain unpublished, distributed underground as samizdat, while his realist fiction titles are the ones that are celebrated as masterpieces. Author and reviewer Orson Scott Card writes that &quot;the climax is not just an inward epiphany for a character… [T]he world changes in wonderful strange ways, and the audience can read the book passionately, with sweating fingers, eager to see what happens next, yet reluctant to leave the present moment. Imagine: A writer who is already one of the best, taking risks and finding ways to be better.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CardFSF02/88&quot;&gt;Card, Orson Scott. &quot;Books to Look For.&quot; &quot;Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;. Cornwall CT: Mercury Press. Feb. 1988: 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Card does take Bishop to task for the author&#x27;s characterization of Richard Nixon, calling it a &quot;caricature&quot; and a &quot;stock character of a madman.&quot; &quot;Locus&quot; reviewer Tom Whitmore calls the book &quot;a masterful pastiche&quot; and &quot;…the closest thing to a classic Dick sf novel anyone has ever done.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Locus11/87&quot;&gt;Whitmore, Tom. &quot;&quot;Locus&quot; Looks at More Books.&quot; &quot;Locus&quot;. Oakland CA: Locus Publications. Nov. 1987: 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Gerald Jonas in &quot;The New York Times&quot; writes &quot;Mr. Bishop is a solid, serious writer whose reach (in his previous work) has always seemed to me to exceed his grasp. Here, he catches some of Dick&#x27;s fire, especially in the early chapters… Then a lot happens very quickly (as in some of Dick&#x27;s own novels), and the satire, which should hold things together, turns predictable. But…the ending (starring Philip K. Dick) approaches sublimity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT02/07/88&quot;&gt;Jonas, Gerald. &quot;Science Fiction.&quot; &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot;. The New York Times. February 7, 1988: 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The novel was nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1989.

====&quot;Unicorn Mountain&quot;====
In this novel, published by Arbor House/William Morrow in 1988, a man dying of AIDS is taken in by his cousin, a rancher in the Colorado mountains. An excerpt, &quot;The Calling of Paisley Coldpony&quot;, was published in &quot;Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction&quot; in January 1988.

Nancy Kress wrote &quot;Michael Bishop has pulled off a rare and amazing feat. &quot;Unicorn Mountain&quot; successfully weaves such traditional fantasy elements as unicorns and Indian lore together with the all-too-contemporary...&quot; Orson Scott Card wrote &quot;The triumph of this, Bishop&#x27;s most artistically whole and successful novel to date, is that he set out to do something that is nearly impossible in fiction: He wrote a novel about constructing a tribe...To do it, he had to bring us to know and understand and care about more created characters than most writers produce in a career.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CardFSF09/88&quot;&gt;Card, Orson Scott. &quot;Books to Look For.&quot; &quot;Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;, Sep. 1988: 33.&lt;/ref&gt; John Clute&#x27;s assessment emphasized another theme of the work: &quot;Michael Bishop, whose voice is like a shout from the bottom of the well of the enormous South, and whose heart is on his sleeve, [manages] in &quot;Unicorn Mountain&quot; to generate a moving tale out of ecological disaster here and in another world, AIDS, the death of cultures, the death of species, and the slow sea-changing of America into themeparks.&quot; The novel won the Mythopoeic Fantasy Award, and was shortlisted for the 1989 Locus Award.

====&quot;Count Geiger&#x27;s Blues&quot;====
Xavier Thaxton, protagonist of &quot;Count Geiger&#x27;s Blues: A Comedy&quot; (Tor Books, 1992), is the fine arts editor for a newspaper in the fictional Southern metropolis of Salonika (a satirical/alternate reality version of contemporary Atlanta) with a particularly low opinion of pop culture. When he is accidentally exposed to illegally dumped nuclear waste, the radiation exposure turns him into a superhero (or, as Bishop designated, a &quot;stalwart&quot;). &quot;Analog&quot; reviewer Tom Easton writes about the novel&#x27;s resolution: &quot;This is where Bishop falters. The satire he has painstakingly created now teeters on the brink of farce. He quite properly makes the decision to yank it back from that brink, but then he loses the satire. He becomes heavy-handed and obvious.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EastonAnalog11/92&quot;&gt; Easton, Tom. &quot;The Reference Library.&quot; &quot;Analog: Science Fiction/Science Fact&quot;. New York: Davis Publications. Nov. 1992: 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Faren Miller disagrees: &quot;The most ambitious comic books are no longer merely comic – may even incorporate tragedy in a critique of modern life as savage and acute, in its way, as the ferocious satire of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;. &quot;Count Geiger&#x27;s Blues&quot; also goes beyond humor – well beyond, in its remarkable closing chapters. But they build on all that has gone before. In unleashing a startling talent for comedy and a wide-ranging knowledge of pop culture in both its absurdity and its splendor, Michael Bishop has written his best book yet.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Locus04/92&quot;&gt;Miller, Faren. &quot;&quot;Locus&quot; Looks at Books.&quot; &quot;Locus&quot;. Oakland CA: Locus Publications. Apr 1992: 17.&lt;/ref&gt; John Kessel writes &quot;Comedy is certainly a new tone from Bishop, and he demonstrates a talent for it…But it seems to me Bishop doesn&#x27;t really want to write comedy. It&#x27;s as if Bishop is running riffs on whatever wacky ideas come to hand, without much plan, holding his characters at arm&#x27;s length; as if, trying to avoid sententiousness, he has to avoid caring – but in the end can&#x27;t. The result being a loose, baggy sort of book.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;KesselFSF03/93&quot;&gt;Kessel, John. &quot;Books.&quot; &quot;Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;. Cornwall CT: Mercury Press. Mar. 1993: 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

====&quot;Joel-Brock the Brave and the Valorous Smalls&quot;====
Bishop&#x27;s first novel for young people &quot;whatever their age&quot; was published in June 2016 by the Fairwood Press imprint Kudzu Planet Productions. Ten-year-old Joel-Brock Lollis returns home from a baseball game to discover that his parents and sister have been kidnapped, and proceeds to recruit two employees of the local big-box department store in his quest to rescue his family. Reviewer Paul Di Filippo writes &quot;Bishop&#x27;s prodigious powers of invention serve him well here too. There are many angles to the tale, including an ongoing dialogue between Joel-Brock and his future self. The bulk of the book takes place in the Sporangium [the underground world beneath the department store], and there&#x27;s always a new miracle or horror around the bend. While the marvels are unpredictable and chaotic, they also exhibit the consistency and inner logic of the best dream worlds.&quot;

===Selected short fiction===
In his introduction to an interview with Michael Bishop, in a reference to Bishop&#x27;s short story collections, Nick Gevers writes &quot;These volumes, combining the sublimely exotic and the drawlingly familiar, satirical humour and timeless tragedy, constitute one of the finest short fiction oeuvres in SF&#x27;s history.&quot;. Author, critic and sometime collaborator, Paul Di Filippo writes

Since his first short-story sale in 1970, Michael Bishop has revealed a questing spiritual intelligence uniquely concerned with moral conundrums. While his works are often full of both the widescreen spectacles associated with science fiction and the subtle frissons typical of more earthbound fantasy, his focus remains on the engagement of characters with ethical quandaries any reader might encounter in his or her daily life. . . While only occasionally delving into explicitly religious themes, Bishop&#x27;s personal Christian faith—wide enough to embrace references to Buddhism, Sufism and other creeds—shines through in every tale. . . Acknowledged as one of the genre&#x27;s finest and most meticulous short-story writers, Bishop boasts six collections to date that function as treasure troves of both science fiction and fantasy. (A seventh lives up to its title, &quot;Emphatically Not SF, Almost&quot;, by hosting only mainstream tales.)

&quot;The Quickening&quot;, Bishop&#x27;s Nebula Award–winning novelette of 1981, is, according to Brian W. Aldiss and David Wingrove &quot;…perhaps, a perfect modern fable. A fable about America and her values. For what is being torn down stone by stone is a world spoiled by the trite commercial values of American culture.&quot; It&#x27;s the story of an ordinary American man who awakes to find himself in Seville, Spain. He soon discovers that the population of the whole world has been scattered, creating a potent stew of race, ethnicity, culture and language.

A major theme throughout much of Bishop&#x27;s work (and especially so in his short fiction) is the role of religion in the daily lives of human beings. When several readers wrote letters of protest to &quot;Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction Magazine&quot; about its 1983 publication of Bishop&#x27;s novella &quot;The Gospel According to Gamaliel Crucis,&quot; Isaac Asimov himself wrote an editorial defending the work and the editor&#x27;s decision to publish it. He wrote &quot;…we had a remarkable story that considered, quite fearlessly, an important idea, and we felt that most readers would recognize its legitimacy – if not at once, then upon mature reflection.&quot;

When Bishop&#x27;s story &quot;Dogs&#x27; Lives&quot; was reprinted in &quot;Best American Short Stories 1985&quot;, it became one of only a handful of genre stories to appear in the prestigious anthology series. The story might have languished in limbo, had the author not pulled its submission to Harlan Ellison&#x27;s never-published anthology &quot;The Last Dangerous Visions&quot;.

<text>The Vision for Space Exploration (VSE) was a plan for space exploration announced on January 14, 2004 by President George W. Bush. It was conceived as a response to the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster, the state of human spaceflight at NASA, and as a way to regain public enthusiasm for space exploration.

The policy outlined by the &quot;Vision for Space Exploration&quot; was replaced first by President Barack Obama&#x27;s space policy in April 2010, then by President Donald Trump&#x27;s &quot;National Space Strategy&quot; space policy in March 2018, and finally by President Joe Biden&#x27;s preliminary space policy proposals in spring 2021.

== Outline ==
The Vision for Space Exploration sought to implement a sustained and affordable human and robotic program to explore the Solar System and beyond; extend human presence across the Solar System, starting with a human return to the Moon by the year 2020, in preparation for human exploration of Mars and other destinations; develop the innovative technologies, knowledge, and infrastructures both to explore and to support decisions about the destinations for human exploration; and to promote international and commercial participation in exploration to further U.S. scientific, security, and economic interests.

In pursuit of these goals, the vision called for the space program to complete the International Space Station by 2010; retire the Space Shuttle by 2010; develop a new Crew Exploration Vehicle (later renamed Orion) by 2008, and conduct its first human spaceflight mission by 2014; explore the Moon with robotic spacecraft missions by 2008 and crewed missions by 2020, and use lunar exploration to develop and test new approaches and technologies useful for supporting sustained exploration of Mars and beyond; explore Mars and other destinations with robotic and crewed missions; pursue commercial transportation to support the International Space Station and missions beyond low Earth orbit.

Outlining some of the advantages, U.S. president George W. Bush addressed the following:

One of the stated goals for the Constellation program is to gain significant experience in operating away from Earth&#x27;s environment, as the White House contended, to embody a &quot;sustainable course of long-term exploration.&quot; The Ares boosters are a cost-effective approach – entailing the Ares V&#x27;s enormous, unprecedented cargo-carrying capacity – transporting future space exploration resources to the Moon&#x27;s weaker gravity field. While simultaneously serving as a proving ground for a wide range of space operations and processes, the Moon may serve as a cost-effective construction, launching and fueling site for future space exploration missions. For example, future Ares V missions could cost-effectively deliver raw materials for future spacecraft and missions to a Moon-based space dock positioned as a counterweight to a Moon-based space elevator.

NASA has also outlined plans for human missions to the far side of the Moon. All of the Apollo missions have landed on the near side. Unique products may be producible in the nearly extreme vacuum of the lunar surface, and the Moon&#x27;s remoteness is the ultimate isolation for biologically hazardous experiments. The Moon would also become a proving ground toward the development of In-Situ Resource Utilization, or &quot;living off the land&quot; (i.e., self-sufficiency) for permanent human outposts.

In a position paper issued by the National Space Society (NSS), a return to the Moon should be considered a high priority space program, to begin development of the knowledge and identification of the industries unique to the Moon. The NSS believes that the Moon may be a repository of the history and possible future of Earth, and that the six Apollo landings only scratched the surface of that &quot;treasure&quot;. According to NSS, the Moon&#x27;s far side, permanently shielded from the noisy Earth, is an ideal site for future radio astronomy (for example, signals in the 1–10 MHz range cannot be detected on Earth because of ionosphere interference).

When the vision was announced in January 2004, the U.S. Congress and the scientific community gave it a mix of positive and negative reviews. For example, U.S. representative Dave Weldon (Republican–Florida) said, &quot;I think this is the best thing that has happened to the space program in decades.&quot; Though physicist and outspoken crewed spaceflight opponent Robert L. Park stated that robotic spacecraft &quot;are doing so well it&#x27;s going to be hard to justify sending a human,&quot; the vision announced by the president states that &quot;robotic missions will serve as trailblazers—the advanced guard to the unknown.&quot; Others, such as the Mars Society, have argued that it makes more sense to avoid going back to the Moon and instead focus on going to Mars first.

Throughout much of 2004, it was unclear whether the U.S. Congress would be willing to approve and fund the Vision for Space Exploration. However, in November 2004, Congress passed a spending bill which gave NASA the $16.2 billion that President Bush had sought to kick-start the vision. According to then-NASA chief Sean O&#x27;Keefe, that spending bill &quot;was as strong an endorsement of the space exploration vision, as any of us could have imagined.&quot; In 2005, Congress passed S.1281, the NASA Authorization Act of 2005, which explicitly endorsed the vision.

Former NASA administrator Michael Griffin is a supporter of the vision, but modified it somewhat, saying that he wants to reduce the four-year gap between the retirement of the Space Shuttle and the first crewed mission of the Crew Exploration Vehicle.

== Lunar Architecture ==
NASA&#x27;s &quot;Lunar Architecture&quot; forms a key part of its Global Exploration Strategy, also known as the Vision for Space Exploration. The first part of the Lunar Architecture is the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which launched in June 2009 on board an Atlas V. The preliminary design review was completed in February 2006 and the critical design review was completed in November 2006. An important function of the orbiter will be to look for further evidence that the increased concentrations of hydrogen discovered at the Moon&#x27;s poles is in the form of lunar ice. After this the lunar flights will make use of the new Ares I and Ares V rockets.

== Critical perspectives ==
In December 2003, Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin voiced criticism for NASA&#x27;s vision and objectives, stating that the goal of sending astronauts back to the Moon was &quot;more like reaching for past glory than striving for new triumphs&quot;.

In February 2009, the Aerospace Technology Working Group released an in-depth report asserting that the vision had several fundamental problems with regard to politics, financing, and general space policy issues and that the initiative should be rectified or replaced.

Another concern noted is that funding for VSE could instead be harnessed to advance science and technology, such as in aeronautics, commercial spacecraft and launch vehicle technology, environmental monitoring, and biomedical sciences. However, VSE itself is poised to propel a host of beneficial Moon science activities, including lunar telescopes, selenological studies and solar energy beams.

With or without VSE, human spaceflight will be made sustainable. However, without VSE, more funds could be directed toward reducing human spaceflight costs sufficiently for the betterment of low Earth orbit research, business, and tourism. Alternatively, VSE could afford advances in other scientific research (astronomy, selenology), in-situ lunar business industries, and lunar-space tourism.

The VSE budget required termination the Space Shuttle by 2010 and of any US role in the International Space Station by 2017. This would have required, even in the most optimistic plans, a period of years without human spaceflight capability from the US. Termination of the Space Shuttle program, without any planned alternatives, in 2011 ended virtually all US capability for reusable launch vehicles. This severely limited any future of low Earth orbit or deep space exploration. Ultimately, the lack of proper funding caused the VSE to fall short of its original goals, leaving many projects behind schedule as President George W. Bush&#x27;s term in office ended.

Keith Cowan wrote in 2014, &quot;The damage done to America and the rest of the world by unsustainable deficits is real, and any lack of zeal in facing this problem would be a mistake. In that context, this would be a good time for Congress to look again at Bush&#x27;s plans for NASA to re-establish a human presence in deep space. The outgoing Republican Congress gave its Republican president too much benefit of the doubt on this undertaking. The new Congress must, at the very least, articulate more convincing reasons than have yet been heard for such a colossal expenditure.&quot;

&quot;A large portion of the scientific community&quot; concurs that NASA is not &quot;expanding our scientific understanding of the universe&quot; in &quot;the most effective or cost-efficient way.&quot; Proponents for VSE argue that a permanent settlement on the moon would drastically reduce costs for further space exploration missions. President George W. Bush voiced this sentiment when the vision was first announced (see quote above), and the United States Senate has re-entered testimony by Space Frontier Foundation founder Rick Tumlinson offered previously to the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation advocating this particular perspective. The reason that the National Space Society regards a return to the Moon as a high space program priority is to begin development of the knowledge and identification of the industries unique to the Moon, because &quot;such industries can provide economic leverage and support for NASA activities, saving the government millions.&quot;

As Tumlinson additionally notes, the goal is to &quot;open space ... to human settlement ... to create ways to harvest the resources ... not only saving this precious planet, but also ... assuring our survival.&quot; Regarding &quot;the Moon, NASA should support early exploration now. ... &quot;

<text>A palace economy or redistribution economy is a system of economic organization in which a substantial share of the wealth flows into the control of a centralized administration, the palace, and out from there to the general population. In turn the population may be allowed its own sources of income but relies heavily on the wealth distributed by the palace. It was traditionally justified on the principle that the palace was most capable of distributing wealth efficiently for the benefit of society. The temple economy (or temple-state economy) is a similar concept.

The concept of economic distribution is at least as old as the advent of the pharaohs. Anthropologists have noted many such systems, from those of tribesmen engaged in common subsistence economies of various sorts to complex civilizations, such as that of the Inca Empire, which assigned segments of the economy to specific villages. The essence of the idea is that a central administration plans production, assigns elements of the population to carry it out, collects the goods and services thus created, and redistributes them to the producers.

A palace economy is a specific type of distribution system in which the economic activities of the civilization are conducted on or near the premises of central administration complexes, the palaces of absolute monarchs, or a group of priests in temple-led versions. It is the function of the palace administration to supply the producers with the capital goods for the production of further goods and services, which are regarded as the property of the monarch. Typically this is not an altruistic undertaking. The palace is primarily interested in the creation of capital, which may then be disposed of as the ruler pleases. Some may become merchandising capital, to be sold or bartered for a profit, or some may be reinvested in further centers, including additional production facilities, wars (economic activities from which a profit is expected to be extracted), favorable alliances, fleets, and mastery of the seas.

In ancient palace systems, the producers were typically part of the working capital. From highest to lowest, they were tied to the palace economy by bonds of involuntary servitude or patronage. Any investment in a war would be expected to bring a return of plunder and prisoners, which became part of the endowment of the palace complex. The palace was responsible for meeting the expenses of the producers. It had to provide food, clothing and shelter, which it often did on the premises.

==Etymology==
The thread leading to the current use of the terms came from the study of the palaces of the Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations, which flourished in the Late Bronze Age on Crete and mainland Greece respectively. The term palace economy began as a label for the economic activities of individual palaces, which contained very large areas for the storage of agricultural produce. For example, Sir Arthur Evans would refer to the palace economy, meaning the economy of the palace of Knossos. Others followed suit, without fully exploring what sort of economy that might be.

In 1956 Ventris and Chadwick published an idea that they had been considering previously:Nor is there any evidence in the tablets of anything approaching currency. Every commodity is listed separately, and there is never any sign of equivalence between one unit and another.

Contemporaneously M. Finley had noticed the evidence of redistribution in the tablets and sought to understand how that could occur in those pre-currency times. In &quot;The World of Odysseus&quot; he noted that most distribution was internal:All the production work, the seeding and harvesting and milling and weaving, even the hunting and raiding, though carried on by individuals, was performed on behalf of the household as a whole ... and from the centre they were redistributed ...

Finley further hypothesized that gift-giving, &quot;the basic organizing mechanism among many primitive peoples,&quot; had been developed into a system of exchange, without prices, and dependent on the ad hoc valuation of the exchangers:The act of giving was ... always the first half of a reciprocal action, the other half of which was a counter-gift.

Finley&#x27;s observations were immediately and almost universally accepted; however, some reservations developed over the decades since then. Mycenaean ships were sent out from the palace complexes laden with ceramics, oils, perfumes and other goods precisely as though they were exports for sale, rather than gift-giving.

Like the other archaeologists of the time, Ventris did not use the term palace economy for anything more than the day-to-day economics of the palace, although Ventris and Chadwick did remark on the &quot;similarities in the size and organization of the royal palaces&quot; of Nuzi, Alalakh and Ugarit. Similarly, Finley in the late 1950s did not refer to his system as a palace economy. The status of the word had changed by 1960, when historical theorists had put the two together.

Exactly who was the first is unclear, but the best candidate is Karl Polanyi, the economic typologist, then toward the end of his life and at the peak of his career. He endorsed Finley&#x27;s work and went further. In the 1960 compendium, &quot;City Invincible&quot;, written before 1958, he recalled Ventris stating that currency was absent from the tablets: &quot;Michael Ventris ... has asserted the absence of money in the palace economy of Mycenaean Greece.&quot; Ventris did not refer to Mycenaean Greece as a palace economy himself, making Finley&#x27;s paraphrasing an early example of this usage. Following this, many theorists began using the term. Grahame Clark (1961) wrote of a &quot;palace economy introduced from Crete ...&quot; Chester Starr (1961) said &quot;Artisans and peasants were largely embraced in a palace economy under royal control, ...&quot; Leonard R. Palmer (1963) referred to the &quot;highly centralized &#x27;palace economy&#x27;&quot; of Knossos and Pylos.

By 1965, the concept of a palace economy was being applied widely to Aegean and Near and Middle Eastern civilizations of the Late Bronze Age. It became such a fixture that subsequently it was applied to modern economic system types. There was, however, a notable abstention. Chadwick, who inherited the work and tradition of Ventris, in &quot;The Mycenaean World&quot; (1976), notably does not refer to a palace economy. Instead he implies questions, such as ... it is not so clear how small a palace can be ... What we can infer from the palace buildings is that there are administrative centres ... each centre of administration implies an administrator, whether he be an independent monarch, a semi-autonomous prince, or a local baron ...

This implying that the palace economy model might be simplistic foreshadowed the current trend. Halstead summarizes a forum begun by Nakassis and others asThe term &#x27;redistribution&#x27; has been used with a range of meanings in the context of the Aegean Bronze Age and so obscures rather than illuminates the emergence and functioning of political economies.

==Mediterranean and Middle Eastern Bronze Age==

===Cretan civilization===

====Middle Minoan Crete====
As early as the Middle Bronze Age, roughly the first half of the 2nd millennium BC, the eastern Mediterranean was dominated by a civilization named Minoan by its discoverer, Sir Arthur Evans, excavating the Palace of Knossos, which he termed the Palace of Minos. The civilization was maritime, its fleets were legendary, its settlements were mainly coastal, and its operations were mainly peaceful. There are legends, such as that of Theseus and the Minotaur, which indicate that tribute of some sort was collected by Crete from overseas locations, but its legendary history is far different from the wars and warriors of the mainland.

The evolution of palatial structures, if that is what they were, began on Crete in the Middle Minoan (MM) period of the Middle Bronze Age. The beginning of what Shaw calls &quot;the big three&quot; – Knossos, Phaestos, Malia – is dated to MMI, but others began in MMII. The relationships between all the foundings remain unknown, but a single foundation act is now to be ruled out.

The type of economic system prevailing on Crete and presumably wherever Cretan influence reached is very well documented by hundreds of tablets found at multiple locations in Crete. Only the persistent resistance of the writing script, Linear A, to decipherment prevents these documents from being read, and the information they contain assimilated. Consequently, nothing is known about the economy beyond what can be deduced from the archaeology or inferred by drawing risky parallels to the information presented in Late Bronze Age documents, which can be read. That the Minoans, as Evans called them in the absence of knowledge of their real name or names, may have had a palace economy is pure speculation.

====Late Minoan Crete====
The economy of the Minoan civilization depended on the cultivation of wheat, olives, grapes and other products and also supported several industries such as the textile, pottery and metalwork industries. Some of the manufacturing industries were based in the palaces. Produce from surrounding farmland was collected, recorded, and stored in the palaces as seen from the large number of storerooms and pithoi (storage jars) recovered. The palaces appear to have had an extent of control over overseas trade. The discovery of Linear A and Linear B tablets, listing commodities in the archive areas of the Palace of Knossos, suggests a highly organised bureaucracy and a system of record keeping that controlled all incoming and outgoing products.

===Other locations===
The palace economies in Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Anatolia, and the Levant were waning in the late Bronze Age, being replaced by primitive market economies led by private merchants or officials who owned private businesses on the side. The last holdout and epitome of the palace system was Mycenaean Greece which was completely destroyed during the Bronze Age collapse and the following Greek Dark Ages.

==Asia==
The mandala model for describing the patterns of diffuse political power in early Southeast Asian history, originated by O. W. Wolters 1982, does not address economic issues. Following British agent John Crawfurd&#x27;s Siam mission in 1822, his journal describes a &quot;palace economy&quot; that he attributes to rapacity. His mission was delayed at the port of Pak Nam until he had given a satisfactory account of gifts to the palace, ending with interrogation into minute details with regards to the gift of a horse, which Crawfurd considered &quot;but a good specimen of the indelicacy and rapacity which we afterwards found so characteristic of the Siamese Court and its officers, upon every question of a similar nature&quot;. This situation began the change to a market economy with the Bowring Treaty, negotiated by free-trade advocate Sir John Bowring with Siam&#x27;s modernizing King Mongkut, signed on April 18, 1855.

<text>Karin Balzer (&quot;née&quot; Richert; 5 June 1938 – 17 December 2019) was an East German hurdler who competed in the 80 m hurdles event at the 1960, 1964 and 1968 Olympics, and in the 100 m hurdles in 1972. She won a gold medal in 1964 and a bronze in 1972, while finishing fifth in 1968. During her career she set 37 world&#x27;s best performances.

==Biography==
She was born Karin Richert in Magdeburg, and competed in several track and field events in her teens. She showed her best results in the 80 m hurdles and qualified for the 1960 Summer Olympics. The United Team of Germany then included athletes of both East and West Germany. She finished fourth in her Olympic semifinal and narrowly missed the final.

The following year, she married her coach, retired pole vaulter, Karl-Heinz Balzer. Some years earlier, they had briefly fled the DDR, but had returned weeks later. Now competing as Karin Balzer, she won her first international medal, silver, at the 1962 European Athletics Championships. In 1964, she tied the world record in the hurdles during a pentathlon competition. Despite showing good results she never competed in pentathlon at major meets.

At the Tokyo Olympics that same year, she placed first in the final of the 80 m hurdles. In a close finish, the first three runners all timed 10.5 seconds, equal to the world record (although the record was not ratified due to a wind). Electronic timing showed Balzer had beaten the two other medalists by one and two hundredths of a second, respectively.

Two years later, Balzer won a second title at the 1966 European Athletics Championships, and then placed fifth in the 1968 Olympic final; she was the Olympic flag bearer for East Germany at those Games. That was the last major event in which the high hurdles were run over 80 m; from 1969 on, the event became the 100 m. Balzer set the inaugural world record in that event, in June 1969, then subsequently lowered it twice during that same year. She also successfully defended her European title in Athens, which she repeated in Helsinki in 1971. That year she was voted German Sportspersonality of the Year.

While in training for the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Balzer&#x27;s son, Andreas was involved in an accident, and was comatised. He died the day before the final of the 100 m hurdles, but her husband did not tell her until after the race, in which she won her second Olympic medal, bronze. Balzer&#x27;s second son, Falk Balzer (born 1973) also became a hurdler. His best achievement was a second place in the 110 m hurdles at the 1998 European Championships.

Balzer was trained as a chemist, and worked as a lab technician from 1955 to 1961. From 1961 until 1976 she was a sports school teacher in Frankfurt and then in Leipzig. In parallel, from 1970 to 1976 she studied at Deutsche Hochschule für Körperkultur (DHfK) and earned a degree in physical education, and from 1973 to 1976 coached athletics at SC Leipzig together with her husband. They were suspended in 1976 after refusing to administer anabolic steroids to their trainees, and moved to Dresden, where Balzer worked as a school teacher through the 1970s and 80s. From 1991 to 1993 she lectured at the BAW Saxony, and from 1994 to 1997 at the Cologne business school. In 1997 Karin and Karl Balzer were reinstated as athletics coaches. Karl died in 2007.

<doc id="667600" wikidata="Q976105" url="?curid=667600" title="Impactite">
<text>Impactite is rock created or modified by one or more impacts of a meteorite. Impactites are considered metamorphic rock, because their source materials were modified by the heat and pressure of the impact. On Earth, impactites consist primarily of modified terrestrial material, sometimes with pieces of the original meteorite.

== Creation ==
When a large meteorite hits a planet, it can radically deform the rocks and regolith that it hits. The heat, pressure, and shock of the impact changes these materials into impactite. Only very massive impacts generate the heat and pressure needed to transform a rock, so impactites are created rarely.

==Characteristics==
Impactite includes shock-metamorphosed target rocks, melts (suevites) and mixtures of the two, as well as sedimentary rocks with significant impact-derived components (shocked mineral grains, tektites, anomalous geochemical signatures, etc.). In June 2015, NASA reported that impact glass has been detected on the planet Mars. Such material may contain preserved signs of ancient life—if life existed. Impactites are generally classified into three groups: shocked rocks, impact melt, and impact breccias.

=== Shocked rock ===
Shocked rocks have been transformed by shock metamorphism caused by the impact. They include shatter cones and high-pressure minerals, for example coesite and stishovite.

=== Impact melts ===
When a meteor strikes a planet&#x27;s surface, the energy released from the impact can melt rock and soil into a liquid. The liquid then cools and becomes an impact melt. If the liquid cools and hardens quickly into a solid, impact glass forms before the atoms have time to arrange into a crystal lattice. Impact glass can be dark brown, almost black, and partly transparent. Sometimes, the cooled liquid does form a crystal structure. In that case, it would still be considered an impact melt, but not an impact glass.

=== Impact breccias ===

Breccia is &quot;a rock consisting of angular fragments cemented together&quot;. An impact breccia is formed when a meteor shatters a rock and then cements it back together. Some breccias contain impact melts.

==Examples of impactite==

Impactite has been found, for example, at the following impact craters and structures:
* Alamo bolide impact (Late Devonian), Nevada, United States
* Alga crater on the planet Mars
* Barringer crater, Arizona, United States
* Charlevoix impact structure, Québec, Canada
* Darwin Crater, Tasmania (source of Darwin glass)
* Lake Lappajärvi, Finland (source of Kärnäite)
* Manicouagan impact structure, Québec, Canada
* Neugrund crater, Estonia
* Nördlinger Ries crater, Germany 
* Rochechouart impact structure, France
* Stac Fada Member, Scotland
* Wabar craters, Saudi Arabia

He is portrayed by Verne Troyer in the film adaptation of &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; and by Warwick Davis in &quot;Deathly Hallows Part 1&quot; and &quot;Part 2&quot;.

===H===
* – Harry&#x27;s snowy owl, whom he got as a birthday gift from Rubeus Hagrid in &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;. She is killed in the Battle of the Seven Potters near the beginning of &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;.

===K===
* – House-elf who belongs to Sirius Black, but wishes to serve Bellatrix Lestrange and the Malfoys. Kreacher lures Sirius and Harry into a trap at the Department of Mysteries, which results in Sirius&#x27;s death. Harry then inherits ownership of Kreacher. In &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;, Harry and his friends send Kreacher to retrieve a locket which is one of Voldemort&#x27;s Horcruxes. During the Battle of Hogwarts, Kreacher rallies the Hogwarts house-elves against the Death Eaters. Kreacher is voiced by Timothy Bateson in the film adaptation of &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot;. The film&#x27;s producers wanted to cut the character from the film, but Rowling advised them to keep him in. The elf is voiced by Simon McBurney in &quot;Deathly Hallows – Part 1&quot;.

===M===
*Muggle Prime Minister – The unnamed sitting Prime Minister of the United Kingdom during the events of the novels. He is referred to as the Muggle Prime Minister by wizards. He is aware of the wizarding world and is protected by an Auror.

===N===
* – Voldemort&#x27;s massive snake that does his bidding. He communicates with her by speaking Parseltongue, the language of snakes. She is one of his Horcruxes. In &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;, Nagini devours Charity Burbage, the Hogwarts Muggle Studies professor. Nagini is later placed inside the corpse of Bathilda Bagshot, which enables a surprise assault on Harry when he visits Godric&#x27;s Hollow. Nagini is slain by Neville Longbottom during the Battle of Hogwarts. The prequel film &quot;Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald&quot; reveals that Nagini was once a cursed woman who eventually transformed into a snake. The human Nagini is portrayed by Claudia Kim in the film.
* – The ghost of Gryffindor House. He was the victim of a botched beheading, which left his head barely attached to his neck. His full name is Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington. He is portrayed by John Cleese in the first two &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films.

===P===
* – A mischievous Hogwarts poltergeist. Rowling has explained that Peeves is not a ghost, but rather an &quot;indestructible spirit of chaos&quot;. Throughout the series, Peeves only listens to a select few individuals: Albus Dumbledore, the Bloody Baron, Nearly Headless Nick and Fred and George Weasley. The Hogwarts caretaker, Argus Filch, repeatedly tries to remove him from the castle. However, Rowling stated in an interview that not even Dumbledore would be able to remove Peeves from Hogwarts forever. Peeves was portrayed by Rik Mayall in the film adaptation of &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, but his scenes were cut from the finished film.

===R===
*Madam Rosmerta – Proprietor of The Three Broomsticks in the village of Hogsmeade. Portrayed by Julie Christie in the film adaptation of &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; (2004).

<text>Kingsessing is a neighborhood in the Southwest section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. On the west side of the Schuylkill River, it is next to the neighborhoods of Cedar Park and Elmwood Park, as well as the borough of Yeadon in Delaware County. It is roughly bounded by 53rd Street to the northeast, Baltimore Avenue to the northwest, Cobbs Creek and 60th Street to the southwest, and Woodland Avenue to the southeast.

==History==

The name Kingsessing, also spelled Chinsessing, comes from a Delaware word meaning &quot;a place where there is a meadow&quot;. The historic Lenape, or Delaware as the English called them, had a village of the same name that roughly occupied the same site as where the current neighborhood was later developed. When the township was organized to encompass where the Lenape and a later Swedish village stood, it also was named as Kingsessing.

Mount Moriah Cemetery was founded next to Cobbs Creek in 1855. The neighborhood near the cemetery is also known as Mount Moriah, part of which is in Elmwood Park.

In 1669 Hans Månsson, a Swedish settler, received a patent for an 1,100-acre plantation along the Schuylkill River between the current location of 60th Street and Woodlands Cemetery, extending as far west as Cobb&#x27;s Creek.

Bartram&#x27;s Garden, started by colonial botanist John Bartram in 1728, is still operated in this neighborhood. It had an international reputation and is considered the first true botanical garden in the United States. It has been designated as a National Historic Landmark.

The S. Weir Mitchell School, Regent-Rennoc Court and Anna Howard Shaw Junior High School are on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Demographics==
As of 2011, Kingsessing is 83.2% black.

==Infrastructure and government==
* The United States Postal Service operates the Kingsessing Post Office at 5311 Florence Avenue.
* Grays Ferry Bridge
* 49th Street station (SEPTA Regional Rail)

<text>Jeffrey C. Wynn is a research geophysicist with the United States Geological Survey (USGS). He is currently based in the Cascades Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, WA, one of the five USGS volcano observatories in the United States

==Professional career==
Wynn has served as vice president for R&amp;D of Zonge International, and in several rotational management positions in the USGS. These include Chief Scientist for Volcano Hazards, Chief of the Office of Geochemistry &amp; Geophysics, Chief of the Venezuelan Guayana &amp; Amazonas Exploration Mission (&quot;Jefe del Grupo Asesor&quot;), where he was first author of the first complete geologic map of southern Venezuela,
and also published a full assessment of discovered and undiscovered mineral resources for the roadless southern half of Venezuela.
Wynn also served for four years as the Deputy Chief for Science and Chief of the USGS Saudi Arabian Mission before assuming responsibility for volcano research and monitoring as Chief Scientist for Volcano Hazards in the USGS.

Wynn has studied and published on the historical era Wabar craters asteroid impact event in the Empty Quarter of Saudi Arabia.
 
 He has also developed a new technology for mapping sub-seafloor minerals, buried wrecks, buried oil and gas infrastructure,
and migrating hydrocarbon plumes in the open ocean using a physical property called 
induced polarization (&quot;IP&quot;).

 He has also done extensive geophysical mapping in SE Alaska.

Wynn co-developed an airborne electromagnetic technology to rapidly map groundwater deep beneath arid 
basins in 3D. Using this technology, he successfully mapped the groundwater of the San Pedro Basin in southern Arizona and northern (Sonora), Mexico in three dimensions.

==Publications==
He has published over 300 articles, books, patents, and maps in fields as diverse as geology, oceanography, hydrology, geophysics, archeology, and astrophysics.

Wynn is a past president of the Environmental &amp; Engineering Geophysical Society (2002–2003).. He has also served as Special Editor of &quot;Geophysics&quot; and is currently an Associate Editor of &quot;Exploration Geophysics&quot;.

==Self Defense==
Wynn holds a 7th degree black belt (Shihan or Master Teacher) in Japanese origin Jujutsu and 6th degree black belt in Taiho-Jutsu. 
As a community service he has taught over 3,000 women for free, along with his senior black belts, self-defense clinics in northern Virginia and southwestern Washington State . He has provided self-defense training to agents of the Washington State Department of Revenue . He also teaches quarterly self-defense classes at Clark College, and Washington State University - Vancouver.

==Awards==
Wynn has been awarded the Department of Interior Meritorious Service Award for &quot;...his outstanding career in geophysics and...scientific leadership of the US Geological Survey.&quot;

In 1999 the Mars-crossing asteroid 9564 Jeffwynn was named in his honor. It was discovered by astronomers Carolyn and Eugene Shoemaker at Palomar Observatory in 1987. Jeff is an Advanced Open Water diver (PADI certification) and has served as a CPR-AED Instructor (National Safety Council) 

He has been awarded three patents on marine IP, most recently in June 2013 for mapping hydrocarbons in the open ocean, with one more pending. A commercial version of the towed-streamer technology was successfully tested in the
Bismarck Sea in February 2005 and off the east coast of South Africa in a successful large-scale commercial sub-seafloor mineral resource mapping deployment during May - June 2007. In 2018 a consortium was formed (Induced Polarization Associates) to commercialize the &quot;Wynn&quot; patents.

<doc id="667620" wikidata="Q715010" url="?curid=667620" title="Manimal">
<text>Manimal is an American superhero television series created by Glen A. Larson and Donald R. Boyle which aired on Fridays at 9:00 pm ET on NBC from September 30 to December 17, 1983. The show centers on the character Jonathan Chase (Simon MacCorkindale), a shape-shifting man who can turn himself into any animal he chooses. He uses this ability to help the police solve crimes.

The series ended after a brief eight episode run.

==Opening narration==
For every episode except the pilot, actor William Conrad recites the opening narration that tells of Chase&#x27;s wealthy present life and his early days in Africa with his missionary father:
==Overview==
&quot;Manimal&quot; premiered as a 90-minute pilot that aired on September 30, 1983. The series featured the story of Jonathan Chase, a shape-shifter who could turn himself into any animal he chose, and used this ability to fight crime. Only two people were aware of Jonathan&#x27;s secret, his friend Ty Earl and police detective Brooke Mackenzie. Jonathan and Ty would assist Brooke with a case she was working on, with Jonathan transforming himself into an animal when it became useful.

While Jonathan had the ability to change himself into any animal, he would transform into a hawk and a black panther in nearly every episode. In some episodes, he would transform into a third animal, such as a horse, dolphin, bear, or bull, with the transformation taking place offscreen, though once he was shown becoming a snake. In one episode, he was shown to be able to assume the aspect of various animals simultaneously, rather than adopt their forms, such as the agility and speed of a panther or the suppleness and fast strikes of a snake. The transformation sequences were designed and created by the Academy Award-winning SFX artist Stan Winston.

Another aspect of the transformations that added to the show&#x27;s camp factor involved Chase&#x27;s clothing during a transformation: He was depicted generally wearing a three-piece suit and tie, and the viewer would see it rip off him as he shape-shifted into an animal, though once the transformation was complete there would be no sign of his discarded clothing. A bit later, he would transform back into human form with all of his clothing perfectly restored upon his person, even if he was unconscious.

==Cast==
* Simon MacCorkindale as Jonathan Chase
* Melody Anderson as Brooke Mackenzie
* Glynn Turman as Tyrone &quot;Ty&quot; C. Earl (pilot episode)
* Michael D. Roberts as Tyrone &quot;Ty&quot; C. Earl
* Reni Santoni as Lt. Nick Rivera
* William Conrad as Narrator (opening scene)
* Jack Greer as Young Jonathan Chase (pilot episode)

==US television ratings==
==Episodes==
===&quot;Night Man&quot;===
* Glen A. Larson, the creator, briefly resurrected the Jonathan Chase character for a crossover with his 1990s series &quot;Night Man&quot;. In that episode, &quot;Manimal&quot;&#x27;s traditional, practical-effects transformation was abandoned in favor of a CGI sequence.

==Home media releases==
On August 27, 2012, &quot;Manimal: The Complete Series&quot; was released on DVD in the UK in PAL region 2 by Fabulous Films. The three-disc set includes the TV-movie pilot and seven original full-length episodes. Special features includes a near 20-minute interview with series creator Glen A. Larson, production notes, biographies, galleries, &quot;Automan&quot; TV series trailer and episode guide booklet.

&quot;Manimal&quot; was released on DVD by Condor Entertainment (3 disc set) in France on October 18, 2012.

Shout! Factory released the complete series on DVD in Region 1 for the very first time on November 10, 2015.

==Annual==
In 1984, a Manimal Annual was released in the UK - a book containing stories, comics and games based on the show.

==Reception and cancellation==
&quot;Manimal&quot; was scheduled opposite CBS&#x27;s highly popular prime time soap opera &quot;Dallas&quot;. The 90-minute pilot aired on September 30, 1983; the one-hour series debuted two weeks later, but was placed on hiatus after only four regular episodes had aired, with production ceasing at that time. The show returned to the NBC schedule a month later, airing the three remaining already-produced episodes before the show was officially canceled due to low ratings on December 14, 1983. NBC&#x27;s 1983 fall line-up also featured eight other series that were axed before their first seasons ended (including &quot;Jennifer Slept Here&quot;, &quot;Bay City Blues&quot;, and &quot;We Got It Made&quot;).

&quot;Manimal&quot; is not well regarded by many TV viewers and the series received negative reviews from critics. John Javna&#x27;s book &quot;The Best of Science Fiction TV&quot; included &quot;Manimal&quot; in its list of the &quot;Worst Science Fiction Shows of All Time&quot;, along with &quot;&quot;, &quot;Lost in Space&quot;, &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot;, and &quot;The Starlost&quot;. &quot;TV Guide&quot; also ranked &quot;Manimal&quot; number 15 on their list of the 50 Worst TV Shows of All Time in 2002. In 2004, readers of the British trade weekly &quot;Broadcast&quot; voted &quot;Manimal&quot; as one of the worst television shows ever exported by the U.S. to the U.K. It placed fifth on their list, exceeded only by &quot;Baywatch&quot;, &quot;The Anna Nicole Show&quot;, &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; and &quot;Wild Palms&quot;. &quot;The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Fantasy&quot; described &quot;Manimal&quot; thus: &quot;Axed after seven regular episodes, the only surprise being that it ever got past the pilot stage&quot;.

&quot;Manimal&quot; was the subject of much sarcastic ribbing on fellow NBC show &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, including a nearly nine-minute segment called &quot;Manimal: Show At The Crossroads&quot; that aired November 8, 1983, after it was announced that &quot;Manimal&quot; would be put on hiatus. After a detailed recounting of the show&#x27;s plots, and a call to NBC headquarters to determine if the show would be brought back, a psychic was brought in to predict &quot;Manimal&quot;&#x27;s future: the verdict was &quot;nope, not on another network, not in syndication, not on home cassettes...it&#x27;s a ghost, it&#x27;s history, it&#x27;s vapor&quot;.

&quot;Manimal&quot; had an associated toy line of solid, non-articulated figurines sold as rack toys made by Fleetwood Toy Corporation. These depicted the character in mid-transformation, such as to a cobra and to a lion.

==Film==
In September 2012, Sony Pictures Animation was developing a live-action/CGI film based on &quot;Manimal&quot;. The series creator and producer, Glen A. Larson, was once again attached as a producer. The film was slated to be produced by Will Ferrell and Adam McKay through their Gary Sanchez Productions, and by Jimmy Miller through his Mosaic Media Group. Jay Martel and Ian Roberts have been hired to write the script. Larson died in 2014, and as of 2024, no further news of the project has emerged since its announcement.

<doc id="667624" wikidata="Q1570468" url="?curid=667624" title="Mindscape (company)">
<text>Mindscape was a video game developer and publisher. The company was founded by Roger Buoy in October 1983 in Northbrook, Illinois, originally as part of SFN Companies until a management buyout was completed in 1987. Mindscape went public in 1988 and was acquired in 1990 by The Software Toolworks, eyeing Mindscape&#x27;s Nintendo license. When Toolworks was acquired by Pearson plc in 1994, Mindscape became the primary identity for the development group. Mindscape was then sold to The Learning Company in 1998 and bought out by Jean-Pierre Nordman in 2001, becoming headquartered in Boulogne-Billancourt, France. Following the poor performance of its products, Mindscape exited the video game industry in August 2011 and soon ceased operations after filing for liquidation. However, its Dutch and Australian-based subsidiaries, Mindscape B.V. and Mindscape Asia Pacific Pty, Ltd., continue to operate as independent publishers and distributors.

Notable titles released by Mindscape include the MacVenture series, &quot;Balance of Power&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Legend&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Lego Island&quot;.

== History ==

=== Early years (1983–1988) ===
Mindscape was founded in October 1983 as a wholly owned subsidiary of the holding company SFN Companies. Mindscape&#x27;s founder, the Australian entrepreneur Roger Buoy, had previously been a computer analyst for Rolls-Royce and later worked for the software division of Scholastic Inc. before being hired by SFN. Buoy acted as the president and chief executive officer (CEO) of Mindscape, and the company released its first product in April 1984. Early games include &quot;Déjà Vu&quot;, &quot;Balance of Power&quot;, and &quot;Sub Mission: A Matter of Life and Death&quot;. In its early years, Mindscape lost about annually.

In July 1986, Mindscape acquired the assets of Scarborough Systems, a software company from Tarrytown, New York. Scarborough Systems continued its operations through Lifeboat Associates, a subsidiary that was not acquired by Mindscape. In October, SFN announced that it would be selling or closing large parts of its business, including plans to liquidate Mindscape. On December 31, Mindscape bought the assets of Roslyn, New York-based company Learning Well. Since Mindscape was not liquidated by the end of 1986, it was assigned to SFN Partners L.P., a limited partnership company. A new corporation set up by Buoy and SFN&#x27;s former president and chairman, John Purcell, subsequently acquired Mindscape from SFN Partners on January 16, 1987, for . Buoy retained his positions in the company, while Purcell became its chairman. Around this time, Mindscape had 74 employees.

With sales of , Mindscape was profitable for the first time in the fourth quarter of 1986; it started publishing black numbers by 1987. In early 1987, Mindscape introduced the Thunder Mountain label to produce software at a lower price, with &quot;&quot; being its first release. In March 1987, Mindscape acquired the software division of Holt, Rinehart and Winston formerly known as CBS Interactive Learning, with all operations transferred to Mindscape&#x27;s Northbrook, Illinois, headquarters. By June 1988, Mindscape filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to prepare an initial public offering (IPO) and become a public company. The move aimed at raising through sale of stock to reduce bank loan debts of . The IPO was completed later that month, with the company beginning trading over-the-counter, and the first shares were issued by July. Bob Ingersoll and Dennis O&#x27;Malley were appointed vice president (VP) of marketing and VP of sales, respectively, in May 1987. In November, Mindscape signed a lease of of office space in Wheeling, Illinois, for . Robert A. Drell, formerly of Dresher Inc., became VP of finance and chief financial officer in October 1988.

=== Under The Software Toolworks and Pearson (1989–1997) ===
In December 1989, the video game company The Software Toolworks reached an agreement to acquire Mindscape, exchanging every Mindscape share for 0.4375 shares in newly issued Toolworks common stock. The deal was completed on March 13, 1990, and valued at . Mindscape had been one of the approximately forty companies licensed to develop for Nintendo video game platforms, which was a major driver of the acquisition. The two companies merged, and Buoy joined Les Crane on Toolworks&#x27;s board of directors. Following the acquisition, Mindscape became Toolworks&#x27;s division working exclusively on games for Nintendo platforms, which sharply increased Toolworks&#x27;s earnings. Subsequently, in March 1994, Pearson plc agreed to acquire Toolworks for , with the deal closing on May 12, 1994.

Pearson was criticized for overpaying in the acquisition, and the acquired company lost within its first few years under the new ownership. By November 1994, the Toolworks name was discontinued in favor of the Mindscape brand. The same year, Mindscape acquired the video game developer Strategic Simulations. In September 1995, it acquired Micrologic Software of Emeryville, California, to undisclosed terms. In January 1996, John F. Moore became CEO after leaving the same position at Western Publishing. In November, Mindscape laid off twelve developed staff as a cost reduction measure. In 1997, Mindscape acquired software company Multimedia Design. In 1997, the final year under Pearson, Mindscape became profitable again, earning . One day prior to the release of &quot;Lego Island&quot; that year, Mindscape fired all of the development team which worked on the game to avoid paying them any bonuses.

=== Under The Learning Company (1998–2001) ===
Pearson proceeded to sell Mindscape to The Learning Company (TLC) in March 1998 for in cash and stock. A waiting period was temporarily imposed by the Federal Trade Commission and subsequently terminated the same month. TLC expected that its stocks would rise per share as a result of the acquisition, while Pearson lost around . Later that year, when TLC integrated its Broderbund division, Mindscape took over Broderbund&#x27;s productivity, reference and entertainment brands. The company&#x27;s Mindscape unit would acquire &quot;Petz&quot; developer PF.Magic in 1998. TLC would be eventually acquired by Mattel in May 1999 and became a subsidiary of the company&#x27;s Mattel Media division, later renamed Mattel Interactive. By then, Mattel occasionally used the Mindscape name for publishing.

TLC and Mattel Interactive&#x27;s gaming assets were acquired by Gores Technology Group in 2000 and its game brands were reformed under a new entity, Game Studios, in January 2001. 

=== French Relaunch (2001-2010) ===
In October 2001, former TLC-Edusoft executive Jean-Pierre Nordman purchased The Learning Company&#x27;s international assets from Gores and reconciled them under Mindscape SA, a new company formed by Nordman located in Boulogne-Billancourt, a suburb of Paris, France with Nordman assuming a managerial role. The new Mindscape continued the work on the publication and distribution of video games and software, mostly focusing towards the family and educational markets.

In November 2002, the company purchased the assets of bankrupt software publisher Montparnasse Multimedia.

The UK division signed many licensing deals throughout the next few years, including one with Atari and HIT Entertainment to re-release the former&#x27;s &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; titles in July 2005, including a contract to produce two new titles; and a budget reissue deal with Focus Multimedia in June 2006.

In October 2005, Mindscape purchased French video game developer and publisher Coktel Vision from Vivendi Universal Games. The company absorbed the studio into its operations, including its remaining eleven employees.

The company saw major expansion in 2009. On 20 October, they purchased the company Violet out of liquidation and took over production of their Nabaztag smart device range., announcing a new a third generation Nabaztag, called &quot;Karotz&quot; in October 2010. In November, the company opened up an internal development studio, Punchers Impact, in Paris to develop multi-platform digital download games. The company developed two games: &quot;Crasher&quot;, a racing game, and &quot;U-Sing&quot;, a music game. By December 2009, Thierry Bensoussan had become the managing director for Mindscape.

In September 2010, Punchers Impact&#x27;s studio managers, Guillaume Descamps and Jérôme Amouyal, left the studio to found Birdies Road.

=== Collapse (2011) ===
On June 23, 2011, Mindscape was placed into insolvency after failing to reach a deal with its lawyers and banks to pay off its debts. The company announced that they would begin a restructuring process. This followed the unsuccessful sales of &quot;Crasher&quot;, and the high music licensing costs for &quot;U-Sing&quot; affecting the profits the game would end up getting, despite it selling well. On August 10, Mindscape announced its exit from the video game industry by closing Punchers Impact and laying off its forty employees. On 24 August, the Nanterre Commercial Court converted Mindscape&#x27;s insolvency status into judicial liquidation. In November, Aldebaran Robotics, the makers of the Nao robot range, acquired Mindscape&#x27;s robotic assets.

The company&#x27;s regional subsidiaries, including Mindscape Asia Pacific in Australia, which was sold to private investors in October 2010 and Mindscape B.V., were unaffected by the company&#x27;s insolvency and continue to operate.

<doc id="667631" wikidata="Q376544" url="?curid=667631" title="Herbstmilch (novel)">
<text>Herbstmilch (English: Autumn Milk) is the German autobiography of Anna Wimschneider (1919–1993), a peasant woman from Lower Bavaria. It was published in 1984. Although it is the autobiography of an unknown, &#x27;ordinary&#x27; person, the book became a huge bestseller and remained in the bestseller charts for three years.

The title derives from the Bavarian word for a type of fermented milk, from which soup is made.

==Story==

Wimschneider tells of the hard conditions in which she grew up, on a farm. In 1927, at the age of 8, after her mother&#x27;s death, she had to look after her family of 9. She later married Albert Wimschneider, but he was then conscripted and went off to war, leaving Anna to look after their farm, together with her mother-in-law.

==Film==
The book was made into a film, titled &quot;Autumn Milk&quot;, in 1988 by Joseph Vilsmaier.

<text>Kristine Z. Kochanski is a fictional character from the British science fiction situation comedy &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;. Kochanski was the first console officer in the navigation chamber on board the spaceship &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;. As well as appearing in the television series, she is also a major character in the &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; novel &quot;Last Human&quot;. In series 1, 2, and 6 she was played by Clare Grogan and was then played by Chloë Annett for series 7 and 8, and the 2009 special &quot;Back to Earth&quot;.

==Fictional history==
===Television===
====1980s====
Kochanski (played by Clare Grogan) briefly appears in &quot;The End&quot; (1988). Later in the episode, after Dave Lister (Craig Charles) is released from three million years in stasis, Holly (Norman Lovett) confirms to Lister that Kochanski is dead following a radiation leak caused by a drive plate aboard the spaceship &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; being repaired inefficiently. Lister tells Holly that she was going to come with him as part of his plan to buy a farm in Fiji, but Lister never got round to telling her.
In the first two series, it becomes apparent that Lister lusted after Kochanski from a distance and occasionally flirted with her but never had a relationship with her, never having had the courage to ask her out. Indeed, in &quot;Balance of Power&quot; (1988), Holly tells Lister that he had shared a total of 173 words with her, fewer words than he had shared with his rubber plant. In the same episode, Lister mentions that he had always been crazy about Kochanski but never acted on his feelings, and is also insecure enough to believe Arnold Rimmer, posing as Kochanski (again played by Grogan), when Rimmer tells him, &quot;I just don&#x27;t like you.&quot; The Kochanski Rimmer also asks Lister why he didn&#x27;t tell Kochanski about his feelings for her while she was still alive, and Lister, upon realising that &quot;Kochanski&quot; is in fact Rimmer in disguise, tells Rimmer that Lister and Kochanski &quot;never made love&quot;. When Lister is revived from stasis, one of the first things he wants to do is revive Kochanski&#x27;s hologram. But as the ship can only officially generate one hologram at a time, Rimmer (played by Chris Barrie) refuses to allow it, and goes so far as to hide Kochanski&#x27;s personality disc.

In &quot;Confidence and Paranoia&quot; (1988), Lister, after looking through Kochanski&#x27;s dream recorder, discovers that Kochanski dreamt about him three times. He believes from this that Kochanski might have been infatuated with him, too, and questions why he never asked Kochanski out. Lister (along with a physical manifestation of his confidence, played by Craig Ferguson) hits upon an idea of how to generate two holograms at once and also deduces where Rimmer has hidden the personality discs – only to discover too late that Kochanski&#x27;s personality disc has been switched for a duplicate of Rimmer&#x27;s. It was originally going to be Kochanski&#x27;s hologram that was generated, but as the script for &quot;Bodysnatcher&quot; wasn&#x27;t finished, they dumped the idea and immediately came up with &quot;Me²&quot;.

In a possible future seen in the episode &quot;Stasis Leak&quot; (1988), Lister finds out that his future self from five years hence has gone back in time and married Kochanski three weeks before the accident which causes &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; to leave the Solar System; their wedding and honeymoon taking place while Kochanski is on planet leave at the Ganymede Holiday Inn. This version of Lister&#x27;s future has still yet to be portrayed outside of &quot;Stasis Leak&quot; as of 2024.

====1990s====

Lister&#x27;s fantasy of his perfect companion in &quot;Camille&quot; (1991) was initially intended to be Kochanski (played by Clare Grogan once again), but it was felt that the inexplicable and implausible re-appearance of Lister&#x27;s true love (or at least enduring obsession) would tip him off too early as to the true nature of the creature that Kryten (Robert Llewellyn) rescues in the episode. The character was changed in clothing and attitude to more or less a female version of Lister, played by Suzanne Rhatigan; however, the fact that Rhatigan bore a physical resemblance to Grogan still allowed her to be identified as playing &quot;Kochanski Camille&quot; in the credits. A line of dialogue by Lister explicitly referencing their resemblance was ultimately cut from the broadcast episode, and later included in deleted scenes on the Series IV DVD.

Kochanski&#x27;s previously established history with Lister where she barely interacted with him is retconned in &quot;DNA&quot; (1991), when Lister mentions Kochanski having &quot;finished with [him]&quot; back before the accident that killed her. Following this break up, he recalls going for a walk in the botanical gardens and looking at a squirrel, thinking, &quot;You lucky little sod. You like your job, you&#x27;re your own boss and you&#x27;ve got no woman trouble, so you&#x27;ll never feel as bad as I feel now.&quot; This affected Lister enough for him to tell the crew of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; that for a split second, he would have given anything to swap places with the squirrel.

In &quot;Dimension Jump&quot; (1991), a Kochanski from a dimension where Lister is more successful is mentioned but not seen as being married to that dimension&#x27;s Lister &quot;Spanners&quot; (also played by Craig Charles), with twin boys, Jim and Bexley.

In &quot;Psirens&quot; (1993), while rejogging Lister&#x27;s memory following Lister awakening from two hundred years of deep sleep, Kryten explicitly explains to Lister that Kochanski dated Lister for three weeks before &quot;discard[ing]&quot; him for a catering officer. Grogan returns in this episode, portraying an illusion of Kochanski created by the genetically engineered lifeforms the Psirens to tempt Lister.

In &quot;Ouroboros&quot; (1997), Kochanski (now played by Chloë Annett) is seen crossing through a linkway originating from a parallel universe along with alternate versions of Lister, Kryten and the Cat (played by Charles, Llewellyn and Danny John-Jules), who agree to exchange supplies with the &quot;Dwarfers&quot;. In a flashback set in her parallel world, Kochanski&#x27;s backstory shows Lister returning from shore leave on Mimas to take a few days off to get over Kochanski after she broke up with him. This version of Kochanski later apologises for the Dear John letter she sent Lister the previous week. She describes her love life with Lister as having gone nowhere and amounting to &quot;hanging out in [Lister&#x27;s] bunk, eating delivery curries and having fantastic sex&quot;. She explains to Lister that she is back together with her ex, a chef called Tim. Kochanski discovers the unquarantined cat Lister smuggled on board and takes her, but is unable to kill her and hides her instead.

Back in the present, the original Lister is shown coming to the realisation that the parallel Lister had to have died in the radiation leak that wiped out &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, and the parallel Lister explains that he was brought back as a hologram by that universe&#x27;s version of Holly. He says that the cat was discovered, and Kochanski was the person who was punished and put into stasis instead. The original Lister also realises that the parallel Lister&#x27;s relationship with Kochanski was rekindled. Kryten later tells the original Lister that after the parallel universe Lister&#x27;s death, that universe&#x27;s Lister was originally a soft light hologram before becoming hard light, and this made him &quot;caring in a way that most men aren&#x27;t&quot;.

The linkway between universes is shown breaking apart being fired upon by a GELF spaceship, with Kochanski subsequently being left stranded on board &quot;Starbug&quot; in the original Lister&#x27;s universe. Kochanski asks the living Lister to fill an in-vitro tube which already has Kochanski&#x27;s DNA inside with his own, as Kochanski, the last known human from her universe, wishes to have children some day. Lister also realises that the in-vitro tube with Kochanski and Lister&#x27;s genetic information is Lister himself, creating a paradox where Lister is his own father and Kochanski is &quot;me ex-girlfriend and me mum&quot;. Lister also says that at some point after his development and birth inside a uterine simulator, the baby Lister must have been sent back in time to the pub that Lister (Alexander John-Jules) is seen abandoned in the beginning of the episode. The story later skips ahead to when this happens.

After being trapped with the &quot;Dwarfers&quot; in their universe, the alternate Kochanski adds something of a new dynamic to the show. Much of the humour in her scenes comes from the difference between her frame of reference and that of the others. Although Annett lacks Grogan&#x27;s Scottish accent, in &quot;Duct Soup&quot; (1997), Kochanski reveals that she was from the trendiest part of Glasgow (the Gorbals, according to Lister), and had spent her childhood in &quot;Cyberschool&quot; with perfect computer-generated settings and perfect computer-generated friends and a pony named &quot;Trumper&quot; before entering Space Cadet School. Her initial reaction to the meagre conditions of life aboard &quot;Starbug&quot; is one of utter despair, as well as disdain for the &quot;Dwarfers&quot; as inferior versions of the people she knew in her dimension.

In &quot;Epideme&quot; (1997), Lister is infected by the Epideme virus (voiced by Gary Martin) after it transfers from the corpse of one of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;″s old crewmembers, Caroline Carmen (Nicky Leatherbarrow), into Lister&#x27;s body. Kryten attempts to isolate the virus and amputate Lister&#x27;s left arm in an attempt to stop the virus from killing him, but this still does not work because Kochanski makes a mistake, and as a result they are forced to amputate Lister&#x27;s right arm instead. Kochanski then temporarily stops Lister&#x27;s heart, and tricks the virus into jumping to Caroline&#x27;s arm, which Kochanski had injected with adrenaline and blood, by making the virus think it was Kochanski&#x27;s. Subsequently, Kryten restarts Lister&#x27;s heart.

In &quot;Nanarchy&quot; (1997), the crew discover Kryten&#x27;s nanobots in Lister&#x27;s dirty washing basket, and get them to rebuild Lister&#x27;s arm and turn the sandy planetoid the nanobots had converted from the atoms of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; back to its original form. Continuing from the end of &quot;Nanarchy&quot;, &quot;Back in the Red&quot; (1999) depicts the crew crash landing &quot;Starbug&quot; in &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;″s landing bay, where the deceased crew are shown having been brought back by an all new set of nanobots created by Holly after Kryten&#x27;s had gone missing. After being put on trial via a scan of their minds, the original charges against Lister, Kryten, the Cat (also played by Danny John-Jules) and Kochanski are dropped, but the four members of &quot;Starbug&quot;, along with Holly and a Rimmer reconstructed by the nanobots, are sentenced to the brig for two years after being found guilty of abusing classified information. In &quot;Cassandra&quot; (1999), Kochanski, along with the rest of the cast, are shown being signed up by Lister to the convict army the Canaries, after Holly lies to Lister that they&#x27;re a singing troupe.

In &quot;Only the Good...&quot; (1999), a corrosive and chameleonic microbe is shown eating apart &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;. After Rimmer tries and fails to obtain the formula for an antidote from a &quot;mirror universe&quot; and not being able to find anyone on &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, a vending machine (voiced by Tony Slattery) informs Rimmer that everyone had crossed back into the mirror universe. The machine opening the way to the mirror universe is shown to have been destroyed by the microbe, leaving Rimmer stranded and the only crew member aboard &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; in his universe.

====2000s====
In &quot;Red Dwarf: Back to Earth&quot; (2009), Lister believes Kochanski to be dead, but a conversation between Lister and two children (played by Charlie Kenyon and Nina Southworth) in a hallucination caused by a female version of the despair squid, which causes joy rather than despair, reveals that her death is a cover story and that in truth she dumped Lister by fleeing &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; in a &quot;Blue Midget&quot; shuttle and that Kryten hid the truth by claiming she was sucked out of an airlock. This is later confirmed by Kryten. Annett appears briefly in the special, as a hallucination of Kochanski created by Lister&#x27;s desire to be reunited with her. In the end Lister rejects the hallucination, in the hope of one day finding the real Kochanski again.

====2010s====
In &quot;Fathers and Suns&quot; (2012), a video recording of Lister is shown advising his &quot;son&quot; watching the video (a near-future version of Lister) that one of the things he should do after getting his life back on track is to &quot;find Krissie&quot;, confirming that Kochanski still hasn&#x27;t been found. In &quot;Entangled&quot; (2012), Lister mentions that he asked the BEGGs if they had seen Kochanski, but they had not. It was originally intended that the final two episodes of Series X would see the reintroduction of Kochanski, but production problems meant that the plan had to be ditched, with replacement stories found at short notice.

===Novels===
The backstory with Kochanski is different in the novel &quot;Red Dwarf: Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers&quot; (1989). In the book, she seems somewhat more intelligent and witty, is learning Japanese in her spare time, and holds her own against arrogant young officers. Lister has a brief but intense relationship with her, spending most of the time in her quarters making love and watching &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;, their favourite movie. Kochanski, however, reveals she is still hooked on her ex-and-future boyfriend Tim, a catering officer. She was dating Lister on the rebound, and goes back to Tim, leaving Lister heartbroken. It is Kochanski&#x27;s rejection of him that leads Lister to his plan to be caught with his cat Frankenstein and be sent to stasis for the rest of the trip, resulting in Lister being the sole survivor of the radiation leak.

Kochanski also appears prominently in the &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; novel &quot;Last Human&quot; (1995), written by Doug Naylor. In the novel, following being reunited with Lister as an aged couple in a world where time runs backwards (following the death of Dave Lister in the &quot;real&quot; universe), Kochanski and Lister have entered into a loving relationship with each other. Now part of the &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; crew, Kochanski is in a clear position of authority as the highest-ranking member of the crew – a fact that Rimmer clearly resents (having been robbed of what minuscule authority &quot;he&quot; could claim in that position), although the others either appreciate or at least do not mind due to her clear intelligence and competence. The novel ends with Kochanski and Lister, stranded on an idyllic world in an unknown parallel universe, attempting to start a family with help from the Luck virus.

==Casting and development==
Liverpudlian actress Alexandra Pigg was originally cast in the role of Kochanski, but was unavailable for new recording dates following an electrician&#x27;s strike, so the part then went to Glaswegian actress and lead singer of the new wave band Altered Images, Clare Grogan. Stage manager Dona DiStefano briefly portrays Kochanski near the end of &quot;Stasis Leak&quot; (1988). In a behind the scenes interview on the Bodysnatcher DVD set, DiStefano says that Clare Grogan had only been scheduled to appear in the pre-recorded scenes and not in the studio scenes. DiStefano has no lines, and her face is mostly obscured by the brim of a hat.

Chloë Annett had auditioned for a role on the second series of &quot;The 10%ers&quot;. Although she didn&#x27;t get the part, she was kept in mind when a new actor for Kochanski was sought after for series VII, after &quot;[i]t was felt that Clare Grogan was more of a &#x27;presenter&#x27; now, and perhaps wasn&#x27;t right to play the part as a regular character.&quot; According to the official &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; website, the &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; movie was &quot;more likely to go ahead&quot; at the time with the introduction of a female character, and Kochanski&#x27;s inclusion &quot;had been likely to happen&quot; even if Chris Barrie&#x27;s character of Arnold Rimmer didn&#x27;t leave &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; around the same time Annett had joined the show. Annett&#x27;s portrayal of Kochanski was more explicitly posh.

In the Series 8 episode &quot;Pete: Part 1&quot; a young Kochanski was played by Holly Earl.

In the unaired pilot for the American version of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, &quot;Christine&quot; Kochanski was played by Elizabeth Morehead.

<doc id="667634" wikidata="Q757749" url="?curid=667634" title="Atrial septal defect">
<text>Atrial septal defect (ASD) is a congenital heart defect in which blood flows between the atria (upper chambers) of the heart. Some flow is a normal condition both pre-birth and immediately post-birth via the foramen ovale; however, when this does not naturally close after birth it is referred to as a patent (open) foramen ovale (PFO). It is common in patients with a congenital atrial septal aneurysm (ASA).

After PFO closure the atria normally are separated by a dividing wall, the interatrial septum. If this septum is defective or absent, then oxygen-rich blood can flow directly from the left side of the heart to mix with the oxygen-poor blood in the right side of the heart; or the opposite, depending on whether the left or right atrium has the higher blood pressure. In the absence of other heart defects, the left atrium has the higher pressure. This can lead to lower-than-normal oxygen levels in the arterial blood that supplies the brain, organs, and tissues. However, an ASD may not produce noticeable signs or symptoms, especially if the defect is small. Also, in terms of health risks, people who have had a cryptogenic stroke are more likely to have a PFO than the general population.

A cardiac shunt is the presence of a net flow of blood through a defect, either from left to right or right to left. The amount of shunting present, if any, determines the hemodynamic significance of the ASD. A right-to-left-shunt results in venous blood entering the left side of the heart and into the arterial circulation without passing through the pulmonary circulation to be oxygenated. This may result in the clinical finding of cyanosis, the presence of bluish-colored skin, especially of the lips and under the nails.

During development of the baby, the interatrial septum develops to separate the left and right atria. However, a hole in the septum called the foramen ovale allows blood from the right atrium to enter the left atrium during fetal development. This opening allows blood to bypass the nonfunctional fetal lungs while the fetus obtains its oxygen from the placenta. A layer of tissue called the septum primum acts as a valve over the foramen ovale during fetal development. After birth, the pressure in the right side of the heart drops as the lungs open and begin working, causing the foramen ovale to close entirely. In about 25% of adults, the foramen ovale does not entirely seal. In these cases, any elevation of the pressure in the pulmonary circulatory system (due to pulmonary hypertension, temporarily while coughing, etc.) can cause the foramen ovale to remain open.
==Types==

The six types of atrial septal defects are differentiated from each other by whether they involve other structures of the heart and how they are formed during the developmental process during early fetal development.

===Ostium secundum===
The &quot;ostium secundum atrial septal defect&quot; is the most common type of atrial septal defect and comprises 6–10% of all congenital heart diseases. It involves a patent ostium secundum (that is, a patent foramen secundum).
The secundum atrial septal defect usually arises from an enlarged foramen ovale, inadequate growth of the septum secundum, or excessive absorption of the septum primum. About 10 to 20% of individuals with ostium secundum ASDs also have mitral valve prolapse.

An ostium secundum ASD accompanied by an acquired mitral valve stenosis is called Lutembacher&#x27;s syndrome.

====Natural history====
Most individuals with an uncorrected secundum ASD do not have significant symptoms through early adulthood. More than 70% develop symptoms by about 40 years of age. Symptoms are typically decreased exercise tolerance, easy fatigability, palpitations, and syncope.

Complications of an uncorrected secundum ASD include pulmonary hypertension, right-sided congestive heart failure. 

While pulmonary hypertension is unusual before 20 years of age, it is seen in 50% of individuals above the age of 40. Progression to Eisenmenger&#x27;s syndrome occurs in 5 to 10% of individuals late in the disease process.

===Patent foramen ovale===
A patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a remnant opening of the fetal foramen ovale, which often closes after a person&#x27;s birth. This remnant opening is caused by the incomplete fusion of the septum primum and the septum secundum; in healthy hearts, this fusion form the fossa ovalis, a portion of the interatrial septum which corresponds to the location of the foramen ovale in the fetus. In medical use, the term &quot;patent&quot; means open or unobstructed. In about 25% of people, the foramen ovale does not close, leaving them with a PFO or at least with what some physicians classify as a &quot;pro-PFO&quot;, which is a PFO that is normally closed, but can open under increased right atrial pressure. On echocardiography, shunting of blood may not be noted except when the patient coughs.

PFO is linked to stroke, sleep apnea, migraine with aura, cluster headache, decompression sickness, Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon, hyperventilation syndrome, transient global amnesia (TGA), and leftsided carcinoid heart disease (mitral valve). No cause is established for a foramen ovale to remain open instead of closing, but heredity and genetics may play a role. In rats research showed a link to the amount of Cryptosporidium infestation and the number of newborn rats that failed to close their foramen ovale. PFO is not treated in the absence of other symptoms.

The mechanism by which a PFO may play a role in stroke is called paradoxical embolism. In the case of PFO, a blood clot from the venous circulatory system is able to pass from the right atrium directly into the left atrium via the PFO, rather than being filtered by the lungs, and thereupon into systemic circulation toward the brain. Also multiple substances -including the prothrombotic agent serotonin- are shunted bypassing the lungs. PFO is common in patients with an atrial septal aneurysm (ASA), a much rarer condition, which is also linked to cryptogenic (i.e., of unknown cause) stroke.

PFO is more common in people with cryptogenic stroke than in those with a stroke of known cause. While PFO is present in 25% in the general population, the probability of someone having a PFO increases to about 40 to 50% in those who have had a cryptogenic stroke, and more so in those who have a stroke before the age of 55. Treatment with anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications in this group appear similar.

===Ostium primum===

A defect in the ostium primum is occasionally classified as an atrial septal defect, but it is more commonly classified as an atrioventricular septal defect. Ostium primum defects are less common than ostium secundum defects. This type of defect is usually associated with Down syndrome.

===Sinus venosus===
A sinus venosus ASD is a type of atrial septum defect in which the defect involves the venous inflow of either the superior vena cava or the inferior vena cava.

A sinus venosus ASD that involves the superior vena cava makes up 2 to 3% of all interatrial communication. It is located at the junction of the superior vena cava and the right atrium. It is frequently associated with anomalous drainage of the right-sided pulmonary veins into the right atrium (instead of the normal drainage of the pulmonary veins into the left atrium).

===Common or single atrium===
Common (or single) atrium is a failure of development of the embryologic components that contribute to the atrial septal complex. It is frequently associated with heterotaxy syndrome.

=== Mixed ===
The interatrial septum can be divided into five septal zones. If the defect involves two or more of the septal zones, then the defect is termed a mixed atrial septal defect.

==Presentation==
===Complications===
Due to the communication between the atria that occurs in ASDs, disease entities or complications from the condition are possible. Patients with an uncorrected atrial septal defect may be at increased risk for developing a cardiac arrhythmia, as well as more frequent respiratory infections.

====Decompression sickness====
ASDs, and particularly PFOs, are a predisposing venous blood carrying inert gases, such as helium or nitrogen does not pass through the lungs.
The only way to release the excess inert gases from the body is to pass the blood carrying the inert gases through the lungs to be exhaled. If some of the inert gas-laden blood passes through the PFO, it avoids the lungs and the inert gas is more likely to form large bubbles in the arterial blood stream causing decompression sickness.

====Eisenmenger&#x27;s syndrome====

If a net flow of blood exists from the left atrium to the right atrium, called a left-to-right shunt, then an increase in the blood flow through the lungs happens. Initially, this increased blood flow is asymptomatic, but if it persists, the pulmonary blood vessels may stiffen, causing pulmonary hypertension, which increases the pressures in the right side of the heart, leading to the reversal of the shunt into a right-to-left shunt. Reversal of the shunt occurs, and the blood flowing in the opposite direction through the ASD is called Eisenmenger&#x27;s syndrome, a rare and late complication of an ASD.

====Paradoxical embolus====
Venous thrombus (clots in the veins) are quite common. Embolizations (dislodgement of thrombi) normally go to the lung and cause pulmonary emboli. In an individual with ASD, these emboli can potentially enter the arterial system, which can cause any phenomenon attributed to acute loss of blood to a portion of the body, including cerebrovascular accident (stroke), infarction of the spleen or intestines, or even a distal extremity (i.e., finger or toe).

This is known as a paradoxical embolus because the clot material paradoxically enters the arterial system instead of going to the lungs.

====Migraine====

Some recent research has suggested that a proportion of cases of migraine may be caused by PFO. While the exact mechanism remains unclear, closure of a PFO can reduce symptoms in certain cases. This remains controversial; 20% of the general population has a PFO, which for the most part, is asymptomatic. About 20% of the female population has migraines, and the placebo effect in migraine typically averages around 40%. The high frequency of these facts make finding statistically significant relationships between PFO and migraine difficult (i.e., the relationship may just be chance or coincidence). In a large randomized controlled trial, the higher prevalence of PFO in migraine patients was confirmed, but migraine headache cessation was not more prevalent in the group of migraine patients who underwent closure of their PFOs.

==Causes==
* Down syndrome – patients with Down syndrome have higher rates of ASDs, especially a particular type that involves the ventricular wall. As many as one half of Down syndrome patients have some type of septal defect.
* Ebstein&#x27;s anomaly – about 50% of individuals with Ebstein anomaly have an associated shunt between the right and left atria, either an atrial septal defect or a patent foramen ovale.
* Fetal alcohol syndrome – about one in four patients with fetal alcohol syndrome has either an ASD or a ventricular septal defect.
* Holt–Oram syndrome – both the osteium secundum and osteum primum types of ASD are associated with Holt–Oram syndrome
* Lutembacher&#x27;s syndrome – the presence of a congenital ASD along with acquired mitral stenosis

==Mechanisms==

In unaffected individuals, the chambers of the left side of the heart are under higher pressure than the chambers of the right side because the left ventricle has to produce enough pressure to pump blood throughout the entire body, while the right ventricle needs only to produce enough pressure to pump blood to the lungs.

In the case of a large ASD (&gt; 9 mm), which may result in a clinically remarkable left-to-right shunt, blood shunts from the left atrium to the right atrium. This extra blood from the left atrium may cause a volume overload of both the right atrium and the right ventricle. If untreated, this condition can result in enlargement of the right side of the heart and ultimately heart failure.

Any process that increases the pressure in the left ventricle can cause worsening of the left-to-right shunt. This includes hypertension, which increases the pressure that the left ventricle has to generate to open the aortic valve during ventricular systole, and coronary artery disease which increases the stiffness of the left ventricle, thereby increasing the filling pressure of the left ventricle during ventricular diastole. The left-to-right shunt increases the filling pressure of the right heart (preload) and forces the right ventricle to pump out more blood than the left ventricle. This constant overloading of the right side of the heart causes an overload of the entire pulmonary vasculature. Eventually, pulmonary hypertension may develop.

The pulmonary hypertension will cause the right ventricle to face increased afterload. The right ventricle is forced to generate higher pressures to try to overcome the pulmonary hypertension. This may lead to right ventricular failure (dilatation and decreased systolic function of the right ventricle).

If the ASD is left uncorrected, the pulmonary hypertension progresses and the pressure in the right side of the heart becomes greater than the left side of the heart. This reversal of the pressure gradient across the ASD causes the shunt to reverse – a right-to-left shunt. This phenomenon is known as Eisenmenger&#x27;s syndrome. Once right-to-left shunting occurs, a portion of the oxygen-poor blood gets shunted to the left side of the heart and ejected to the peripheral vascular system. This causes signs of cyanosis.


==Diagnosis==
Most individuals with a significant ASD are diagnosed &quot;in utero&quot; or in early childhood with the use of ultrasonography or auscultation of the heart sounds during physical examination. Some individuals with an ASD have surgical correction of their ASD during childhood. The development of signs and symptoms due to an ASD are related to the size of the intracardiac shunt. Individuals with a larger shunt tend to present with symptoms at a younger age.

Adults with an uncorrected ASD present with symptoms of dyspnea on exertion (shortness of breath with minimal exercise), congestive heart failure, or cerebrovascular accident (stroke). They may be noted on routine testing to have an abnormal chest X-ray or an abnormal ECG and may have atrial fibrillation. If the ASD causes a left-to-right shunt, the pulmonary vasculature in both lungs may appear dilated on chest X-ray, due to the increase in pulmonary blood flow.

===Physical examination===

The physical findings in an adult with an ASD include those related directly to the intracardiac shunt and those that are secondary to the right heart failure that may be present in these individuals.

In unaffected individuals, respiratory variations occur in the splitting of the second heart sound (S2). During respiratory inspiration, the negative intrathoracic pressure causes increased blood return into the right side of the heart. The increased blood volume in the right ventricle causes the pulmonic valve to stay open longer during ventricular systole. This causes a normal delay in the P2 component of S2. During expiration, the positive intrathoracic pressure causes decreased blood return to the right side of the heart. The reduced volume in the right ventricle allows the pulmonic valve to close earlier at the end of ventricular systole, causing P2 to occur earlier.

In individuals with an ASD, a fixed splitting of S2 occurs because the extra blood return during inspiration gets equalized between the left and right atria due to the communication that exists between the atria in individuals with ASD.

The right ventricle can be thought of as continuously overloaded because of the left-to-right shunt, producing a widely split S2. Because the atria are linked via the atrial septal defect, inspiration produces no net pressure change between them, and has no effect on the splitting of S2. Thus, S2 is split to the same degree during inspiration as expiration, and is said to be &quot;fixed&quot;.

===Echocardiography===

In transthoracic echocardiography, an atrial septal defect may be seen on color flow imaging as a jet of blood from the left atrium to the right atrium.

If agitated saline is injected into a peripheral vein during echocardiography, small air bubbles can be seen on echocardiographic imaging. Bubbles traveling across an ASD may be seen either at rest or during a cough. (Bubbles only flow from right atrium to left atrium if the right atrial pressure is greater than left atrial). Because better visualization of the atria is achieved with transesophageal echocardiography, this test may be performed in individuals with a suspected ASD which is not visualized on transthoracic imaging.
Newer techniques to visualize these defects involve intracardiac imaging with special catheters typically placed in the venous system and advanced to the level of the heart. This type of imaging is becoming more common and involves only mild sedation for the patient typically.

If the individual has adequate echocardiographic windows, use of the echocardiogram to measure the cardiac output of the left ventricle and the right ventricle independently is possible. In this way, the shunt fraction can be estimated using echocardiography.

===Transcranial doppler bubble study===

A less invasive method for detecting a PFO or other ASDs than transesophagal ultrasound is transcranial Doppler with bubble contrast. This method reveals the cerebral impact of the ASD or PFO.

===Electrocardiogram===

The ECG findings in atrial septal defect vary with the type of defect the individual has. Individuals with atrial septal defects may have a prolonged PR interval (a first-degree heart block). The prolongation of the PR interval is probably due to the enlargement of the atria common in ASDs and the increased distance due to the defect itself. Both of these can cause an increased distance of internodal conduction from the SA node to the AV node.

In addition to the PR prolongation, individuals with a primum ASD have a left axis deviation of the QRS complex, while those with a secundum ASD have a right axis deviation of the QRS complex. Individuals with a sinus venosus ASD exhibit a left axis deviation of the P wave (not the QRS complex).

A common finding in the ECG is the presence of incomplete right bundle branch block, which is so characteristic that if it is absent, the diagnosis of ASD should be reconsidered.
==Treatment==

=== Patent foramen ovale ===
Most patients with a PFO are asymptomatic and do not require any specific treatment. However, those who develop a stroke require further workup to identify the etiology. In those where a comprehensive evaluation is performed and an obvious etiology is not identified, they are defined as having a cryptogenic stroke. The mechanism for stroke is such individuals is likely embolic due to paradoxical emboli, a left atrial appendage clot, a clot on the inter-atrial septum, or within the PFO tunnel.

==== PFO closure ====

Until recently, patients with PFO and cryptogenic stroke were treated with antiplatelet therapy only. Previous studies did not identify a clear benefit of PFO closure over antiplatelet therapy in reducing recurrent ischemic stroke. However, based on new evidence and systematic review in the field, percutaneous PFO closure in addition to antiplatelet therapy is suggested for all who meet all the following criteria:
* Age ≤ 60 years at onset of first stroke,
* Embolic-appearing cryptogenic ischemic stroke (i.e., no evident source of stroke despite a comprehensive evaluation), and
* PFO with a right-to-left interatrial shunt detected by bubble study (echocardiogram)

A variety of PFO closure devices may be implanted via catheter-based procedures.
==== Medical therapy ====
Based on the most up to date evidence, PFO closure is more effective at reducing recurrent ischemic stroke when compared to medical therapy. In most of these studies, antiplatelet and anticoagulation were combined in the medical therapy arm. Although there is limited data on the effectiveness of anticoagulation in reducing stroke in this population, it is hypothesized that based on the embolic mechanism, that anticoagulation should be superior to antiplatelet therapy at reducing risk of recurrent stroke. A recent review of the literature supports this hypothesis recommending anticoagulation over the use of antiplatelet therapy in patients with PFO and cryptogenic stroke. However, more evidence is required comparing of PFO closure with anticoagulation or anticoagulation with antiplatelet therapy.

=== Atrial septal defect ===
Once someone is found to have an atrial septal defect, a determination of whether it should be corrected is typically made. If the atrial septal defect is causing the right ventricle to enlarge a secundum atrial septal defect should generally be closed. If the ASD is not causing problems the defect may simply be checked every two or three years. Methods of closure of an ASD include surgical closure and percutaneous closure.

====Evaluation prior to correction====
Prior to correction of an ASD, an evaluation is made of the severity of the individual&#x27;s pulmonary hypertension (if present at all) and whether it is reversible (closure of an ASD may be recommended for prevention purposes, to avoid such a complication in the first place. Pulmonary hypertension is not always present in adults who are diagnosed with an ASD in adulthood).

If pulmonary hypertension is present, the evaluation may include a right heart catheterization. This involves placing a catheter in the venous system of the heart and measuring pressures and oxygen saturations in the superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, right atrium, right ventricle, and pulmonary artery, and in the wedge position. Individuals with a pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) less than 7 wood units show regression of symptoms (including NYHA functional class). However, individuals with a PVR greater than 15 wood units have increased mortality associated with closure of the ASD.

If the pulmonary arterial pressure is more than two-thirds of the systemic systolic pressure, a net left-to-right shunt should occur at least 1.5:1 or evidence of reversibility of the shunt when given pulmonary artery vasodilators prior to surgery. (If Eisenmenger&#x27;s physiology has set in, the right-to-left shunt must be shown to be reversible with pulmonary artery vasodilators prior to surgery.)

Surgical mortality due to closure of an ASD is lowest when the procedure is performed prior to the development of significant pulmonary hypertension. The lowest mortality rates are achieved in individuals with a pulmonary artery systolic pressure less than 40 mmHg. If Eisenmenger&#x27;s syndrome has occurred, a significant risk of mortality exists regardless of the method of closure of the ASD. In individuals who have developed Eisenmenger&#x27;s syndrome, the pressure in the right ventricle has raised high enough to reverse the shunt in the atria. If the ASD is then closed, the afterload that the right ventricle has to act against has suddenly increased. This may cause immediate right ventricular failure, since it may not be able to pump the blood against the pulmonary hypertension.

====Surgical closure====
Surgical closure of an ASD involves opening up at least one atrium and closing the defect with a patch under direct visualization.

====Catheter procedure====

Percutaneous device closure involves the passage of a catheter into the heart through the femoral vein guided by fluoroscopy and echocardiography. An example of a percutaneous device is a device which has discs that can expand to a variety of diameters at the end of the catheter. The catheter is placed in the right femoral vein and guided into the right atrium. The catheter is guided through the atrial septal wall and one disc (left atrial) is opened and pulled into place. Once this occurs, the other disc (right atrial) is opened in place and the device is inserted into the septal wall. This type of PFO closure is more effective than drug or other medical therapies for decreasing the risk of future thromboembolism.
The most common adverse effect of PFO device closure is new-onset atrial fibrillation. Other complications, all rare, include device migration, erosion and embolization and device thrombosis or formation of an inflammatory mass with risk for recurrent ischemic stroke.

Percutaneous closure of an ASD is currently only indicated for the closure of secundum ASDs with a sufficient rim of tissue around the septal defect so that the closure device does not impinge upon the superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, or the tricuspid or mitral valves. The Amplatzer Septal Occluder (ASO) is commonly used to close ASDs. The ASO consists of two self-expandable round discs connected to each other with a 4-mm waist, made up of 0.004– to 0.005-inch Nitinol wire mesh filled with Dacron fabric. Implantation of the device is relatively easy. The prevalence of residual defect is low. The disadvantages are a thick profile of the device and concern related to a large amount of nitinol (a nickel-titanium compound) in the device and consequent potential for nickel toxicity.

Percutaneous closure is the method of choice in most centres. Studies evaluating percutaneous ASD closure among pediatric and adult population show that this is relatively safer procedure and has better outcomes with increasing hospital volume.

==Epidemiology==
As a group, atrial septal defects are detected in one child per 1500 live births. PFOs are quite common (appearing in 10–20% of adults), but when asymptomatic go undiagnosed. ASDs make up 30 to 40% of all congenital heart diseases that are seen in adults.

The ostium secundum atrial septal defect accounts for 7% of all congenital heart lesions. This lesion shows a male:female ratio of 1:2.

<text>Awareness under anesthesia, also referred to as intraoperative awareness or accidental awareness during general anesthesia (AAGA), is a rare complication of general anesthesia where patients regain varying levels of consciousness during their surgical procedures. While anesthesia awareness is possible without resulting in any long-term memory of the experience, it is also possible for victims to have awareness with explicit recall, where they can remember the events related to their surgery (intraoperative awareness with explicit recall).

Intraoperative awareness with explicit recall is an infrequent condition with potentially devastating psychological consequences. While it has gained popular recognition in media, research shows that it only occurs at an incidence rate of 0.1–0.2%. Patients report a variety of experiences, ranging from vague, dreamlike states to being fully awake, immobilized, and in pain from the surgery. Intraoperative awareness is usually caused by the delivery of inadequate anesthetics relative to the patient&#x27;s requirements. Risk factors can be anesthetic (e.g., use of neuromuscular blockade drugs, use of intravenous anesthetics, technical/mechanical errors), surgical (e.g., cardiac surgery, trauma/emergency, C-sections), or patient-related (e.g., reduced cardiovascular reserve, history of substance use, history of awareness under anesthesia).

Currently, the mechanism behind consciousness and memory under anesthesia is unknown, although there are many working hypotheses. However, intraoperative monitoring of anesthetic level with bispectral index (BIS) or end-tidal anesthetic concentration (ETAC) may help to reduce the incidence of intraoperative awareness, although clinical trials have yet to show a decreased incidence of AAGA with the BIS monitor.

There are also many preventative techniques considered for high-risk patients, such as pre-medicating with benzodiazepines, avoiding complete muscle paralysis, and managing patients&#x27; expectations. Diagnosis is made postoperatively by asking patients about potential awareness episodes and can be aided by the modified Brice interview questionnaire. A common but devastating complication of intraoperative awareness with recall is the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from the events experienced during surgery. Prompt diagnosis and referral to counseling and psychiatric treatment are crucial to the treatment of intraoperative awareness and the prevention of PTSD.

==Signs and symptoms==
Intraoperative awareness can present with a variety of signs and symptoms. A large proportion of patients report vague, dreamlike experiences, while others report specific intraoperative events, such as:
* hearing noises or conversations in the operating room
* remembering details of the operation
* sensing pain associated with intubation or surgery
* having weakness or muscle paralysis
* feeling anxiety, helplessness, or an impending sense of doom

Intraoperative signs that may indicate patient awareness include:
* hypertension
* tachycardia
* patient movement
* tachypnea
* intravenous anesthesia line infiltrated or occluded

Patients under anesthesia are paralyzed if a neuromuscular blockade drug, a type of muscle relaxant, has been given as part of general anesthesia. When paralyzed, patients may not be able to communicate their distress or alert the operating room staff of their consciousness until the paralytic wears off. After surgery, recognition of the symptoms of an awareness event may be delayed. One review showed that only about 35% of patients are able to report an awareness event immediately after the surgery, with the rest remembering the experience from weeks to months afterward. Depending on the awareness experience, patients may have postoperative psychological problems that range from mild anxiety to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is characterized by recurrent anxiety, irritability, flashbacks or nightmares, avoidance of triggers related to the trauma, and sleep disturbances.

==Causes ==

===Paralytic and muscle relaxant use===

The biggest risk factor is anesthesia performed by unsupervised trainees and the use of a medication that induces muscle paralysis, such as suxamethonium (succinylcholine) or non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs (muscle relaxants). During general anesthesia, the patient&#x27;s muscles may be paralyzed in order to facilitate tracheal intubation or surgical exposure (abdominal and thoracic surgery can be performed only with adequate muscle relaxation). Because the patient cannot breathe for themselves, mechanical ventilation must be used. The paralyzing agent does not cause unconsciousness or take away the patient&#x27;s ability to feel pain, but does prevent the patient from breathing, so the airway (trachea) must be protected and the lungs ventilated to ensure adequate oxygenation of the blood and removal of carbon dioxide.

A fully paralyzed patient is unable to move, speak, blink the eyes, or otherwise respond to the pain. If neuromuscular blocking drugs are used, this causes skeletal muscle paralysis but does not interfere with cardiac or smooth muscle or the functioning of the autonomic nervous system, so heart rate, blood pressure, intestinal peristalsis, sweating and lacrimation are unaffected. The patient cannot signal distress and may not exhibit the signs of awareness that would be expected to be detectable by clinical vigilance, because other drugs used during anaesthesia may block or obtund these.

Many types of surgery do not require the patient to be paralyzed. A patient who is anesthetized but not paralyzed can move in response to a painful stimulus if the analgesia is inadequate. This may serve as a warning sign that the anesthetic depth is inadequate. Movement under general anesthesia does not imply full awareness but is a sign that the anesthesia is light. Even without the use of neuromuscular blocking drugs the absence of movement does not necessarily imply amnesia.

===Light anesthesia===

For certain operations, such as caesarean section, or in hypovolemic patients or patients with minimal cardiac reserve, the anesthesia provider may aim to provide &quot;light anesthesia&quot; and should discuss this with patients to warn them. During such circumstances, consciousness and recall may occur because judgments of depth of anesthesia are not precise. The anesthesia provider must weigh the need to keep the patient safe and stable with the goal of preventing awareness. Sometimes, it is necessary to provide lighter anesthesia in order to preserve the life of the patient. &quot;Light&quot; anesthesia means less drugs by the intravenous route or via inhalational means, leading to less cardiovascular depression (hypotension) but permitting &quot;awareness&quot; in the anesthetized subject.

===Anesthesiologist error===

Human errors include repeated attempts at intubation during which the short-acting anesthetic may wear off but the paralyzing drug does not; esophageal intubation; inadequate drug dose; a drug given by the wrong route or a wrong drug given; drugs given in the wrong sequence; inadequate monitoring; patient abandonment; disconnections and kinks in tubes from the ventilator; and failure to refill the anesthetic machine&#x27;s vaporizers with volatile anesthetic. Other causes include unfamiliarity with techniques used, e.g. ⁠intravenous anesthetic regimes, and inexperience. Most cases of awareness are caused by inexperience and poor anesthetic technique, which can be any of the above, but also includes techniques that could be described as outside the boundaries of &quot;normal&quot; practice. The American Society of Anesthesiologists in 2007 released a Practice Advisory outlining the steps that anesthesia professionals and hospitals should take to minimize these risks. Other societies have released their own versions of these guidelines, including the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists.

To reduce the likelihood of awareness, anesthetists must be adequately trained, and supervised while still in training. Equipment that monitors depth of anesthesia, such as bispectral index monitoring, should not be used in isolation.

Current research attributes the incidence of AAGA to a combination of the risks mentioned above, together with ineffective practice from ODPs, anesthetic nurses, HCAs and anesthetists. The main failures include:
* Inattention or judgment errors related to drugs and volatile agents
* Termination of anesthesia too soon before surgery has finished, due to poor communication
* Lack of understanding of offset times of volatile agents
* Backflow of induction agent up a giving set
* Failure to fill vaporizers (which is the cause of 19% of the cases of AAGA)
* Under-dosing of induction agent during difficult intubation
* Failure to monitor MAC (minimum alveolar concentration of inhaled anaesthetic required to prevent movement in 50% of patients in response to surgical incision)
* Syringe swaps
* Rushing caused by organizational or individual circumstances (often associated with staff shortage and stressful work environment)
* Distractions caused by another member of staff

===Equipment failure===

Machine malfunction or misuse may result in an inadequate delivery of anesthetic. Many Boyle&#x27;s machines in hospitals have the oxygen regulator serving as a slave to the pressure in the nitrous oxide regulator, to enable the nitrous oxide cut-off safety feature. If nitrous oxide delivery suffers due to a leak in its regulator or tubing, an &#x27;inadequate&#x27; mixture can be delivered to the patient, causing awareness. Many World War II-vintage Boyle &#x27;F&#x27; models are still functional and used in UK hospitals. Their emergency oxygen flush valves have a tendency to release oxygen into the breathing system, which, when added to the mixture set by the anesthesiologist, can lead to awareness. This may also be caused by an empty vaporizer (or nitrous oxide cylinder) or a malfunctioning intravenous pump or disconnection of its delivery tubing. Patient abandonment (when the anesthesiologist is no longer present) causes some cases of awareness and death.

===Patient physiology===
Very rare causes of awareness include drug tolerance, or a tolerance induced by the interaction of other drugs. Some patients may be more resistant to the effects of anesthetics than others; factors such as younger age, obesity, tobacco smoking, or long-term use of certain drugs (alcohol, opioids, or amphetamines) may increase the anesthetic dose needed to produce unconsciousness. There may be genetic variations that cause differences in how quickly patients clear anesthetics, and there may be differences in how the sexes react to anesthetics as well. In addition, anesthetic requirement is increased in persons with naturally red hair. Marked anxiety prior to the surgery can increase the amount of anesthesia required to prevent recall.

== Conscious sedation ==

There are various levels of consciousness. Full wakefulness and general anesthesia are the two extremes of the spectrum. Conscious sedation and monitored anesthesia care (MAC) refer to an awareness somewhere in the middle of the spectrum, depending on the degree to which a patient is sedated. Monitored anesthesia care involves titration of local anesthesia along with sedation and analgesia. Awareness/wakefulness does not necessarily imply pain or discomfort. The aim of conscious sedation or MAC is to provide a safe and comfortable anesthetic while maintaining the patient&#x27;s ability to follow commands.

Under certain circumstances, a general anesthetic, whereby the patient is completely unconscious, may be unnecessary or undesirable. For instance, with a caesarean delivery, the goal is to provide comfort with neuraxial anesthetic yet maintain consciousness so that the mother can participate in the birth of the child. Other circumstances may include, but are not limited to, procedures that are minimally invasive or purely diagnostic (and thus not uncomfortable). Sometimes, the patient&#x27;s health may not tolerate the stress of general anesthesia. The decision to provide MAC versus general anesthesia can be complex, involving careful consideration of individual circumstances and discussion with the patient about their preferences.

Patients who undergo conscious sedation or monitored anesthesia care are never meant to be without recall. Whether a patient remembers the procedure depends on the type of anesthetic, dosages, patient physiology, and other factors. Many patients undergoing monitored anesthesia may go through profound amnesia, depending on the amount of anesthetic used.

Some patients undergo sedation for smaller procedures such as biopsies and colonoscopies and are told they will be asleep, although in fact they are getting a sedation that may allow some level of awareness as opposed to a general anesthetic.

== Memory ==
New research has been carried out to test what people can remember after a general anesthetic, in an effort to understand anesthesia awareness more clearly and help to protect patients from experiencing it. A memory is not one simple entity; it is a system of many intricate details and networks.

Memory is currently classified under two main subsections.
* Explicit or conscious memory, which refers to the conscious recollection of previous experiences. An example of explicit memory is remembering what you did last weekend. When it comes to an anesthetized patient, a doctor may ask the patient after undergoing general anesthesia if he or she could remember hearing any distinct sounds or words while under anesthesia. This approach is called a &quot;recall test&quot; because patients are asked to recall any memories they had during surgery.
* Implicit memory or unconscious memory, which refers to the changes in performance or behavior that are produced by previous experiences but without any conscious recollection of those experiences. An example of this is a recognition test, where patients are asked to determine, after surgery, which of a selection of words could be heard during the surgery. The following scenario is an example. Patients were exposed during anesthesia to a list of words containing the word &quot;pension&quot;. Postoperatively, when presented with the three-letter word stem PEN___ and asked to supply the first word that came to their minds beginning with those letters, they gave the word &quot;pension&quot; more often than &quot;pencil&quot; or &quot;peninsula&quot; or others.

Some researchers are now formally interviewing patients postoperatively to calculate the incidence of anesthesia awareness. It is good practice for the anesthesiologist to visit the patient after the operation and check that the patient was not aware. Most patients who were not unduly disturbed by their experiences do not necessarily report cases of awareness unless directly asked. Many who are greatly disturbed report their awareness but anesthesiologists and hospitals deny that it has happened. It has been found that some patients may not recall experiencing awareness until one to two weeks after undergoing surgery. It was also found that some patients require a more detailed interview to jog their memories for intraoperative experiences but these are only untraumatic cases. Some researchers have found that while anesthesia awareness does not commonly occur in minor surgeries, it may occur more frequently in more serious surgeries, and that it is good practice to warn of the possibility of awareness in those cases where it may be more likely.

==Prevention==
The risk of awareness is reduced by avoidance of paralytics unless necessary; careful checking of drugs, doses and equipment; good monitoring, and careful vigilance during the case. The Isolated Forearm Technique (IFT) can be used to monitor consciousness; the technique involves applying a tourniquet to the patient&#x27;s upper arm before the administration of muscle relaxants, so that the forearm can still be moved consciously. The technique is considered a reference standard by which other means of monitoring consciousness can be assessed.

Because the medical staff may not know if a person is unconscious or not, it has been suggested that the staff maintain the professional conduct that would be appropriate for a conscious patient.

==Monitors==

Recent advances have led to the manufacture of monitors of awareness. Typically these monitor the EEG, which represents the electrical activity of the cerebral cortex, which is active when awake but quiescent under anesthesia (or in natural sleep). The monitors usually process the EEG signal down to a single number, where 100 corresponds to a patient who is fully alert, and zero corresponds to electrical silence. General anesthesia is usually signified by a number between 60 and 40 (this varies with the specific system used). There are several monitors now commercially available. These newer technologies include the bispectral index (BIS), EEG entropy monitoring, auditory evoked potentials, and several other systems such as the SNAP monitor and the Narcotrend monitor.

None of these systems are perfect. For example, they are unreliable at extremes of age (e.g., neonates, infants or the very elderly). Secondly, certain agents, such as nitrous oxide, may produce anesthesia without reducing the value of the depth monitor. This is because the molecular action of these agents (NMDA receptor antagonists) differs from that of more conventional agents, and they suppress cortical EEG activity less. Third, they are prone to interference from other biological potentials (such as EMG), or external electrical signals (such as electrosurgery). This means that the technology that will reliably monitor depth of anesthesia for every patient and every anesthetic does not yet exist. This may in part explain why a 2016 systematic review and meta analysis concluded that depth-of-anesthesia monitors had a similar effect to standard clinical monitoring on the risk of awareness during surgery.

== Incidence ==
The incidence of anesthesia awareness is variable; it seems to affect 0.2% to 0.4% of patients. This variation reflects the surgical setting as well as the physiological state of the patient; the incidence is 0.2% in general surgery, about 0.4% during caesarean section, between 1% and 2% during cardiac surgery and between 10% and 40% for anesthesia of the traumatized. The majority of these do not feel pain, although around one-third did, in a range of experience from a sore throat caused by the endotracheal tube, to traumatic pain at the incision site. The incidence is halved in the absence of neuromuscular blockade.

The quoted incidences are controversial as many cases of &quot;awareness&quot; are open to interpretation.

The incidence is higher and has more serious sequelae when muscle relaxants or neuromuscular-blocking drugs are used. This is because without relaxant the patient will move and the anesthesiologist will then deepen the anesthesia.

One study has indicated that this phenomenon occurs in 0.13% of patients, or between 1 and 2 per 1000. There are conflicting data, however, as another study suggested it is a rarer phenomenon, with an incidence of 0.0068%, after review of data from a population of 211,842 patients.

Postoperative interview by an anesthetist is common practice to elucidate whether awareness occurred in the case. If awareness is reported, a case review is immediately performed to identify machine, medication, or operator error.

==Outcomes==
Patients who experience full awareness with explicit recall may have suffered an enormous trauma due to the extreme pain of surgery. Some patients experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), leading to long-lasting after-effects such as nightmares, night terrors, flashbacks, insomnia, and in some cases even suicide. Some cases of awareness alert the patient to intra-operative errors.

A study from Sweden in 2002 attempted to follow up 18 patients for approximately 2 years after having been previously diagnosed with awareness under anesthesia. Four of the nine interviewed patients were still severely disabled due to psychiatric/psychological after-effects. All of these patients had experienced anxiety during the period of awareness, but only one had stated feeling pain. Another three patients had less severe, transient mental symptoms, although they could cope with these in daily life. Two patients denied any lasting effects from their awareness episode.

<text>Charles Harold St. John Hamilton (8 August 1876 – 24 December 1961) was an English writer, specialising in writing long-running series of stories for weekly magazines about recurrent casts of characters, his most frequent and famous genre being boys&#x27; public school stories, though he also wrote in other genres. He used a variety of pen-names, generally using a different name for each set of characters he wrote about, the most famous being Frank Richards for the Greyfriars School stories featuring Billy Bunter. Other important pen-names included Martin Clifford (for St Jim&#x27;s), Owen Conquest (for Rookwood) and Ralph Redway (for The Rio Kid). He also wrote hundreds of stories under his real name such as the Ken King stories for &quot;The Modern Boy.&quot;

He is estimated to have written about 100 million words in his lifetime and has featured in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; as the world&#x27;s most prolific author. Vast amounts of his output are available on the Friardale website.

==Working life==

===Early life and career (1876–1906)===

Hamilton was born in Ealing, London, one of the eight children of Mary Ann Hannah (&quot;née&quot; Trinder - born 1847) and John Hamilton (1839-1884), a master carpenter. Charles Hamilton was privately educated at Thorn House School in Ealing, where he studied Classical Greek among other subjects. He then embarked on a career as a writer of fiction, having his first story accepted almost immediately, appearing in 1895.

Over the following years he was to establish himself as the main writer with the publisher Trapps Holmes, providing several thousand stories on a range of subjects including police, detectives, firemen, Westerns as well as school stories. In 1906 he started to write for the Amalgamated Press and although he continued to have stories published for Trapps Holmes until 1915 (many of which were reprints), his allegiance was gradually to move.
===Heyday (1907–1940)===

Amalgamated Press started a new story paper for boys called &quot;The Gem&quot; in 1907 and by issue number 11 it had established a format: the major content was to be a story about St Jim&#x27;s school, starring Tom Merry as the main character and written by Charles Hamilton under the pen name of Martin Clifford. This paper rapidly established itself and, to capitalise on its success, a similar venture was launched in 1908. This was to be known as &quot;The Magnet&quot;. The subject matter was a school called Greyfriars and Hamilton was again to be the author, this time using the name Frank Richards.

In 1915 Hamilton started a third school series for Amalgamated Press, Rookwood, this time under the name Owen Conquest and featuring a leading character called Jimmy Silver. These appeared in the &quot;Boys&#x27; Friend Weekly&quot;, and were shorter than the Greyfriars and St Jim&#x27;s stories.

These three schools absorbed most of Hamilton&#x27;s energies over the following 30 years and constitute the work for which he is best remembered. In the early part of this period the St Jim&#x27;s stories were more involved and more popular. The Greyfriars stories, however, evolved gradually over the early years of &quot;The Magnet&quot;, eventually becoming Hamilton&#x27;s main priority. His &quot;golden age&quot; is generally regarded as lasting from about 1925 to about 1935. In all he provided stories for 82 per cent of the issues of &quot;The Magnet&quot; and two thirds of the issues of &quot;The Gem&quot;. If a Hamilton story was not available, the story was provided by another author but still using the Clifford or Richards name.

By the late 1930s the circulations of both &quot;The Gem&quot; and &quot;The Magnet&quot; had declined, partly because of competition from publications by D.C. Thomson. In December 1939 &quot;The Gem&quot; was cancelled, in the traditional manner of British comics, by being merged with another paper, the &quot;Triumph&quot;. There is reason to believe that the same fate would have overtaken &quot;The Magnet&quot; in the summer of 1940, but in the event a sudden shortage of paper, caused by the progress of the war, led to its ceasing publication abruptly and without notice in May that year. The final issue contained the opening story of a new series.

===Later career (1940–1961)===

Following the closure of &quot;The Magnet&quot; in 1940 Hamilton had little work, but he became known as the author of the stories following a newspaper interview he gave to the London &quot;Evening Standard&quot;. He was not able to continue the Greyfriars saga, as Amalgamated Press held the copyright and would not release it. He was obliged to create new schools such as Carcroft and Sparshott, as well as trying the romance genre under the name of Winston Cardew. 

By 1946 Richards had received permission to write Greyfriars stories again, and obtained a contract from publishers Charles Skilton for a hardback series, the first volume of which, &quot;Billy Bunter of Greyfriars School&quot;, was published in September 1947. The series continued for the rest of his life, the publisher later changing to Cassells. In addition, he wrote further St Jim&#x27;s, Rookwood and Cliff House stories, as well as the television scripts for seven series of Billy Bunter stories for the BBC.

Frank Richards died on 24 December 1961, aged 85, and was cremated at the Kent County Crematorium at Charing in Kent.

==Personal life==
Hamilton never married, but some details of one romance are provided in a biography, and another is briefly mentioned in his autobiography. Early in the 20th century he was briefly engaged to a lady called Agnes, and later he formed a brief attachment to an American lady whom he alluded to as Miss New York.

His life interests were writing stories, studying Latin, Greek and modern languages, chess, music, and gambling, especially at Monte Carlo. The Roman poet Horace was a particular favourite. He travelled widely in Europe in his youth, but after 1926 he left England only to visit France. He lived in a small house called Rose Lawn, in Kingsgate, a hamlet in St Peter parish, now part of Broadstairs, Kent, where he was looked after by a housekeeper, Miss Edith Hood. She continued to reside in Rose Lawn following his death.

While Hamilton was reclusive in later years, he conducted a prolific correspondence with his readers. He generally wore a skull cap to conceal his hair loss and sometimes smoked a pipe.

He had a close relationship with his sister Una, her husband Percy Harrison and their daughter, Una Hamilton-Wright, who produced her own biography of Hamilton in 2006.

Portraits of Hamilton were painted by the artist Norman Kadish.

==Literary output==
 
It has been estimated by the researchers Lofts and Adley that Hamilton wrote around 100 million words or the equivalent of 1,200 average-length novels, making him the most prolific author in history. He is known to have created over 100 schools that were the subjects of his stories as well as writing many non-school stories. More than 5,000 of his stories have been identified, of which 3,100 were reprinted.

===Pen-names===
At least 25 pen-names have been identified as having been used by Hamilton. These are listed below.

===Style and content===

Hamilton employed a lightly ironic voice, often studded with humorous classical references which had the effect of making the stories both accessible and erudite. In this respect, he has been compared to P. G. Wodehouse, who emerged from a similar period and was also a prolific author in a light-hearted genre. His extraordinary output has been suggested as arising from a very fluent style that came naturally to him and, in turn made the stories very readable, while at the same time being somewhat wordy.

Much of his popularity derives from his ability to allow the reader to participate vicariously in the ongoing adventure. As with many later children&#x27;s writers, the stories centred on a small core group of characters who form a close knit unit – at St Jim&#x27;s there was the Terrible Three, at Rookwood the Fistical Four and at Greyfriars, The Famous Five. Such groups, while being closed to other pupils, are implicitly open to readers who are subliminally invited to include themselves amongst their number, thereby establishing their involvement with the story.

The stories also uphold a moral code of honesty, generosity, respect and discipline, while condemning Hamilton&#x27;s own weaknesses of smoking and gambling. There is also a strong message against racism in the inclusion of an Indian schoolboy, Hurree Singh, into the core group of the Famous Five in 1908, and by subsequently introducing a Jewish boy, Monty Newland, as a respected member of the Remove (the main form featured in the stories). Both of these &#x27;foreign&#x27; characters personify &#x27;British&#x27; values of honesty and sportsmanship, and were extremely popular with readers. This attitude did not extend to Africans, however, whom Hamilton describes in racist stereotypes.

Charles Hamilton was a keen gambler at continental casinos before the First World War. Although his stories always had a strong anti-gambling message, such conduct being described as &#x27;sweepy&#x27; or &#x27;shady&#x27;, Hamilton often introduced gambling storylines, such as horserace betting or casinos, and warned of its compulsive dangers.

The moral message throughout is subtly tempered through comic characters, of whom Billy Bunter is the most famous. Bunter is the antithesis of everything the stories value: lazy, greedy, dishonest, and self-centred. However, he is tolerated because of his extreme incompetence and (usually) good nature and lack of malice. His absurd interventions deflate the high seriousness of authority figures, and frequently reduce their efforts to farce. 

The public school is a world where adult supervision is light, allowing the juvenile characters to create a society of their own, and dare to adventure beyond the experience of the young readers. This formula became standard in juvenile fiction, though Hamilton&#x27;s originality and technique were seldom equalled.

===Substitute writers===
During the 1910s Hamilton&#x27;s input dropped during his frequent trips to the Continent and the gambling tables of Monte Carlo, and for about 20 years nearly 35 other authors wrote stories for publication under the pen names &#x27;Martin Clifford&#x27; and &#x27;Frank Richards&#x27;; these included Edwy Searles Brooks (1889–1965), Hedley Percival Angelo O&#x27;Mant (1899–1955), William Edward Stanton Hope (1889–1961), Julius Herman (1894–1955) John Nix Pentelow (1872–1931) and George Richmond Samways (1895–1996), the last writing nearly 100 Greyfriars stories among others. Hamilton disparagingly referred to this pool of substitutes as &quot;the Menagerie&quot;. The last substitute-written story appeared in &quot;The Magnet&quot; in 1931; all subsequent stories were solely written by Hamilton.

==Criticism==

Before World War II, all of Hamilton&#x27;s writing was for weekly papers, produced on cheap paper and lacking any suggestion of permanence; it had nonetheless attracted a loyal following but, unsurprisingly, no critical attention from the mainstream media. However, there emerged in 1940 a privately printed publication called the &quot;Story Paper Collector&quot;. This was printed at irregular times in Canada until 1966 when the founder, originally from Croydon, England, died. It was distributed around the world and printed critical discussions and articles about the work of Charles Hamilton and other story paper writers. In November 1946 another magazine, the &quot;Collectors&#x27; Digest&quot; began. Created by Herbert Leckenby, and in due course edited by Eric Fayne and Mary Cadogan, it was to run at mostly monthly intervals until early 2005 (a last issue being published in 2007). Discussion and debates continued through internet based Groups.

A 1940 essay by George Orwell entitled &quot;Boys&#x27; Weeklies&quot; paid particular attention to Hamilton&#x27;s work. Orwell suggested that the style was deliberately formulaic so that it could be copied by a panel of authors whom he supposed to lie behind the Frank Richards name. He denigrated the world of the stories as an outdated, snobbish, and right-wing fantasy, while conceding that Billy Bunter was a &quot;really first-rate character&quot;. Hamilton&#x27;s retort included his first public acknowledgement of himself as author:In the presence of such authority, I speak with diffidence and can only say that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, I am only one person and have never been two or three. and defended the wholesome comfort of the stories:A boy of fifteen or sixteen is on the threshold of life: and life is a tough proposition; but will he be better prepared for it by telling him how tough it may possibly be? I am sure that the reverse is the case. . . . Happiness is the best preparation for misery, if misery must come. At least, the poor kid will have had something! He may, at twenty, be hunting for a job and not finding it—why should his fifteenth year be clouded by worrying about that in advance? . . . Even if making miserable children would make happy adults, it would not be justifiable. But the truth is that the adult will be all the more miserable if he was miserable as a child. Every day of happiness, illusory or otherwise—and most happiness is illusory—is so much to the good. It will help to give the boy confidence and hope. Frank Richards tells him that there are some splendid fellows in a world that is, after all, a decent sort of place. He likes to think himself like one of these fellows, and is happy in his daydreams. Mr Orwell would have him told that he is a shabby little blighter, his father an ill-used serf, his world a dirty, muddled, rotten sort of show. I don&#x27;t think it would be fair play to take his twopence for telling him that!Cultural historian Jeffrey Richards has written extensively about Hamilton&#x27;s work, providing many examples of admirers, including John Arlott, Peter Cushing, Ted Willis and Benny Green. He says the works recall a world which contrasts with &quot;the birth of an age which knew all about its rights but had forgotten its responsibilities&quot;.

<doc id="667642" wikidata="Q2638988" url="?curid=667642" title="Billy Bunter">
<text>William George Bunter is a fictional schoolboy created by Charles Hamilton using the pen name Frank Richards. He features in stories set at Greyfriars School, a fictional English public school in Kent, originally published in the boys&#x27; weekly story paper &quot;The Magnet&quot; from 1908 to 1940. The character has appeared in novels, on television, in stage plays and in comic strips.

He is in the Lower Fourth form of Greyfriars School, known as the Remove, whose members are 14–15 years of age. Time is frozen in the Greyfriars stories; although the reader sees the passing of the seasons, the characters&#x27; ages do not change and they remain in the same year groups. Originally a minor character, Bunter&#x27;s role was expanded over the years with his antics being heavily used in the stories for comic relief and to advance the plots.

Bunter&#x27;s defining characteristics are his naive greed, self-indulgence, and overweight appearance. He is in many respects an obnoxious anti-hero. Besides his gluttony, he is obtuse, lazy, racist, nosy, deceitful, pompous, and conceited, but he is blissfully unaware of his defects. In his own mind, he is a handsome, talented, and naturally aristocratic young man surrounded by uncouth &quot;beasts&quot;. His vices are offset by several redeeming features, including a sporadic but genuine courage in aid of others; his ability to be generous during his rare occasions of prosperity; and above all his very real love and concern for his mother. All these, along with Bunter&#x27;s irrepressible optimism, and his comically transparent untruthfulness and inept attempts to conceal his antics from his schoolmasters and schoolfellows, combine to make the character highly entertaining, though hardly sympathetic.

== Origins ==
Charles Hamilton invented the character for an unpublished story in the late 1890s. He claimed Bunter was derived from three persons: a corpulent editor, a short-sighted relative, and another relative who was perpetually trying to raise a loan.

The identity of the fat editor is unclear: various sources suggest either Lewis Ross Higgins, editor of a number of comic papers and who is described as resembling the author G. K. Chesterton; or Percy Griffith, the original editor of &quot;The Magnet&quot;. The short-sighted relative was Hamilton&#x27;s younger sister Una, who had suffered poor sight since childhood, and who had been wont to &quot;peer at him somewhat like an Owl&quot;; while the other relative was his older brother Alex, who was described as &quot;generally anxious to borrow a pound or two&quot; on the strength of the anticipated arrival of a cheque that never materialised.

==&quot;Magnet&quot; stories==
Billy Bunter featured in 1,670 of the 1,683 issues of &quot;The Magnet&quot; published during the 32-year period from 1908 to 1940. He was introduced in Magnet No. 1 &quot;The Making of Harry Wharton&quot; (1908) as a minor character, but developed into one of the principal characters of the stories as author Charles Hamilton realised his comic potential.

George Orwell described him as &quot;a real creation. His tight trousers against which boots and canes are constantly thudding, his astuteness in search of food, his postal order which never turns up, have made him famous wherever the Union Jack waves.&quot; 

In addition to stories set at Greyfriars School, he featured in many travel series, with trips to China, India, Egypt, Brazil, Hollywood and the South Seas.

===Appearance===

In his first appearance, Billy Bunter was introduced thus:

Bunter&#x27;s big round spectacles and rolling gait earned him the nickname the &quot;Owl of the Remove&quot;.

In the early stories, both Bunter and classmate Johnny Bull were described as &quot;stout&quot; in appearance; and it was Magnet illustrator C. H. Chapman who first put Bunter into checked-pattern trousers to distinguish the two characters. With the passage of time, the illustrations showed Bunter&#x27;s circumference ever more pronounced, while Johnny Bull became indistinguishable from the other schoolboys.

A list of the members of the Remove (Lower Fourth) form was published in Magnet No. 1659 &quot;Billy Bunter&#x27;s Bargain&quot; (1939), and provided the boys&#x27; ages, heights, and weights. Billy Bunter&#x27;s age is given as 15 years 1 month; his height as ; and his weight as .

===Character===
On many levels, Bunter is deeply unattractive, amply displaying most of the seven deadly sins: pride, wrath, envy, sloth and, most especially, greed and gluttony (though sexual lust is absent in the innocent world of the stories). Bunter is also nosy, deceitful and obtuse. However these traits are softened by his cheery optimism, his comically transparent untruthfulness and his reliable ineptitude when attempting to conceal his antics from his schoolfellows and schoolmasters.

From the very first &quot;Magnet&quot; story, Bunter suffers an ongoing shortage of cash and is forever attempting to borrow money from his schoolfellows, explaining that he is imminently expecting a postal money order from one of his &quot;titled relations&quot;. Over the course of stories spanning several decades, Bunter&#x27;s celebrated postal order almost never materialises; and the subject becomes a long-running cause of railery in the Greyfriars Remove. Even so, Bunter is a skilful and persistent sponger and succeeds in extracting countless loans from his schoolfellows. Wealthier schoolboys such as Lord Mauleverer frequently part with a few shillings to be rid of Bunter; but even the notoriously tight-fisted American junior Fisher T. Fish is once persuaded to loan him cash.

Bunter&#x27;s morals are peculiarly his own. He has every intention of repaying his debts, but they end up lingering for months or years. He is obsessed with food – the sweeter and stickier, the better – and is compulsively helps himself to his schoolfellows&#x27; sweets, cakes and hampers, for which he earns countless kickings. But despite his complete lack of scruples in such matters, Bunter is otherwise as honest as any other Greyfriars schoolboy. He would never dream of stealing money or valuables.

In the early stories, Bunter was associated with his stammering stock phrase: &quot;I&#x27;m s-sincerely sorry&quot;. As his character developed, the stammer disappeared, and his stock phrases became his greeting &quot;I say, you fellows!&quot;, the reproachful &quot;Oh really, Wharton!&quot; (or whichever character he is addressing), the anguished exclamation &quot;Yaroooh!&quot; and the distinctive giggle &quot;He, he, he!&quot;

Although Bunter has a keen sense of his own importance, this is rarely shared by anyone else. A notable exception occurs in a 1932 story, during an election for a new Remove Form Captain. The support of the form divides equally between two candidates, leaving Bunter with the casting vote, which is keenly solicited by both camps. Bunter becomes the centre of attention, which he exploits to the full. His view of the two candidates illustrates his priorities:

In the classroom, Bunter&#x27;s erudition is slight to non-existent. His extreme laziness and ineptitude is the despair of his Form master, Mr Quelch.

Bunter&#x27;s personal habits are lazy and slovenly. He is always the last to rise in the morning and always chooses to remain in bed a few extra minutes instead of washing. His handkerchief is permanently filthy, and his waistcoat usually displays remains of his breakfast.

A running theme at the beginning of each holiday season is Bunter&#x27;s persistent attempts to avoid going home and instead to gatecrash the holidays of his schoolfellows, and their generally unsuccessful attempts to avoid Bunter&#x27;s company.

He has two talents: for cooking, and an uncanny ability to imitate voices (usually called ventriloquism in the stories). This talent was developed in the early Magnet stories, commencing with Magnet No. 32 &quot;The Greyfriars Ventriloquist&quot; (1908). In a series of stories in which Bunter unsuccessfully attempts, in turn, a physical exercise regime, hypnotism, and mind reading, a visiting ventriloquism show inspires him to believe himself a born ventriloquist. &quot;More like a born idiot&quot;, comments Bob Cherry – but Bunter perseveres and eventually masters the art. It is a talent unappreciated by his schoolfellows, since he generally uses it for mischief, or to get himself out of trouble.

Among Bunter&#x27;s few virtues is an occasional tendency to display courage for the sake of others, despite his extreme terror on such occasions. This characteristic was first seen in Magnet No. 364 &quot;Surprising the School&quot; (1915) when he saved his schoolmaster&#x27;s niece, Cora Quelch, from an angry bull, and was afterwards repeated many times. Unfortunately, Bunter&#x27;s vanity frequently leads him to spoil matters by boasting and exaggerating afterwards. Oddly enough, he also displays generosity on the rare occasions when he is in possession of food or cash.

Billy Bunter&#x27;s main redeeming feature is his very genuine love and concern for his mother. This is seen in several stories, usually involving his mother falling ill, which draws out Bunter&#x27;s unselfish side (&quot;Magnet&quot; Nos. 1016, 1206 and 1532).

===Bunter as a plot driver===
For the first fifteen years of the &quot;Magnet&quot; stories, Bunter was one of the crowd. From the mid-1920s, as Hamilton increasingly developed Bunter&#x27;s comic potential, he also began to use his antics to initiate and drive forward the plots.

Conspiratorial conversations or gossip would be overheard by Bunter through a keyhole, or from under the seat in a rail compartment while hiding from the ticket inspector, or under a table hiding from some outraged fellow whose food he had purloined. He would invariably gossip about such knowledge. Letters would be purloined by Bunter and not reach the intended recipient. Bunter&#x27;s ventriloquism skills would provoke conflicts between other characters. Whilst he was usually not the main protagonist, his influence as a comic interlude and a plot driver was felt at every turn.

In &quot;The Secret Seven&quot; series of 1934, the entire plotline is initiated by Bunter&#x27;s stupidity, which causes a road accident that sends a number of leading characters to the hospital.

===Bunter as a principal character===
During &quot;The Magnet&quot; era, Billy Bunter is not yet the permanent principal character he would become in the post-war era. Each principal character would take a leading role in turn. Stronger characters such as Remove Captain Harry Wharton, the hard and rebellious Herbert Vernon-Smith, and Fifth form duffer Horace Coker are frequently given leading roles in their own series; and even lesser characters such as American junior Fisher T. Fish and aspiring actor William Wibley would occasionally be brought to the fore in their own series.

Eventually, Bunter took his turn with the rest, in a number of stories that placed him as the lead protagonist. Some notable examples include:

* The &quot;Bunter Court&quot; series from 1925 (&quot;Magnet&quot; Nos. 910 to 917) – by a combination of trickery and co-incidence, Bunter manages to obtain the tenancy of a stately home, Combermere Lodge, and passes it off as Bunter Court. Despite the author&#x27;s comment that this was one of the most contrived plots he had ever been forced to employ, this series is highly regarded. Remarkably, Billy Bunter succeeds in being entertaining without the reader ever being invited to feel the slightest affection or sympathy for him. After borrowing from his guests to pay the servants&#x27; wages, and locking the estate agent, the butler, and others into the cellar to hide his tracks, Bunter finally flees before receiving his just desserts. 
* The &quot;Whiffles Circus&quot; series from 1928 (&quot;Magnet&quot; Nos. 1069 to 1076) – Billy Bunter assumes the identity of Mr Whiffles, the proprietor of a circus, by stealing his clothes, wig and false whiskers, and sustains the impersonation over the course of the storyline when all the circus hands mistake him for the proprietor. 
* The &quot;Bunter £100 Boater Hat&quot; series from 1933 (&quot;Magnet&quot; Nos. 1325 to 1326) – tramp Harold Hinks steals a £100 note belonging to Vernon-Smith&#x27;s father and hides it under the lining of Bunter&#x27;s straw hat. However, Bunter is wearing a borrowed hat at the time, leading to Mr Hinks&#x27; hapless attempts to recover the banknote by snatching a succession of wrong hats from Bunter&#x27;s head. Charles Hamilton considered this one of his funniest stories.
* The &quot;Popper Island Rebellion&quot; series from 1934 (&quot;Magnet&quot; Nos. 1374 to 1382) – Billy Bunter is expelled after being wrongfully accused of drenching Fifth Form master Mr Prout in ink. The Remove rise up in his support and build a fortified camp on Popper Island, which they successfully defend against a number of assaults by the prefects and other seniors.

In 1929, the editors of &quot;The Magnet&quot; persuaded Charles Hamilton to drop the character of Billy Bunter altogether for several editions and attempt a storyline in the style of an action thriller, resulting in the &quot;Ravenspur Grange&quot; series (&quot;Magnet&quot; Nos. 1122 to 1125). This provoked a strong outcry from &quot;Magnet&quot; readers dismayed at Bunter&#x27;s disappearance, and Billy Bunter would never be absent from the stories again.

===Racism and chauvinism===

Charles Hamilton&#x27;s writings displayed a pronounced prejudice against Americans. His American characters were either comical or had unsavoury tendencies such as racism or usury. A notable example is Billy Bunter&#x27;s fellow form member Fisher T. Fish, the son of a New York businessman, whose moneylending frequently brings him into conflict with the school authorities and who, on occasion, displays racist behaviour.

In comparison with contemporary literature, the Greyfriars stories are unusually firm in rejecting racism. Hamilton uses the technique of giving racist dialogue to antihero characters in a way that demonstrates the offensive nature of racist attitudes, including Bunter himself, who often uses language that modern-day readers would characterise as racist.

In an age when the word &quot;nigger&quot; was fairly common, the Greyfriars stories consistently emphasised the offensive nature of the term from as early as 1922 and the narratives even included unfashionable anti-British sentiments in stories set against the background of imperial India.

===Family===
Billy Bunter has two siblings: a younger sister, Elizabeth Gertrude (Bessie), who attends the nearby Cliff House School, and a younger brother, Samuel Tuckless (Sammy) in the Second Form at Greyfriars School. Bessie first appears in &quot;The Magnet&quot; No. 582 &quot;The Artful Dodger&quot; (1919), before appearing as a regular character in &quot;School Friend&quot; later that year. Bessie appears in a total of 116 &quot;Magnet&quot; stories. Sammy Bunter first appears in &quot;The Magnet&quot; No. 144 &quot;Billy Bunter&#x27;s Minor&quot; (1910) and appears in a further 291 &quot;Magnet&quot; stories.

There is little love lost among the three siblings:

Their father is Mr William Samuel Bunter, a portly, largely unsuccessful, stockbroker with a severe manner; although it is noted that &quot;like many middle-aged gentlemen, Mr. Bunter was better tempered after breakfast.&quot; He is perpetually complaining about income tax and school fees, and is brusque with his children. As often as Billy writes to ask for pocket money, his father refuses. By contrast, Billy is particularly close to his mother, Mrs Amelia Bunter, a kindly lady who appears only briefly in seven stories.

Billy&#x27;s cousin Walter Gilbert (Wally) Bunter was introduced in &quot;Magnet&quot; No. 333 &quot;The Dark Horse&quot; (1914) and appears in a further 32 &quot;Magnet&quot; stories. He is Billy&#x27;s exact double, excepting only his spectacles, but is his opposite in every other respect.

Other members of the Bunter family to appear briefly over the years include Billy&#x27;s uncles James, George and Claude, aunts Prudence and Claribel, great-aunt Eliza Judith, and (in a one-off story) Sir Foulkes Bunter and his son.

Bunter boasts of living at Bunter Court, a stately home with liveried servants and a fleet of chauffeured Rolls-Royce cars. In fact, this turns out to be the modest Bunter Villa in Surrey, with a maid, a cook and a single Ford car.

Many stories from &quot;The Magnet&quot; were reprinted in the Schoolboys Own Library before World War II, and some by Armada and Paul Hamlyn in the 1970s. Most of the 1,683 issues of &quot;The Magnet&quot; were reprinted in hardback facsimile by publisher W. Howard Baker, under his Howard Baker and Greyfriars Book Club imprints between 1969 and 1990.

==Post-war stories==

=== Hardback stories ===
Following the closure of &quot;The Magnet&quot; in 1940, Hamilton had little work; but he became known as the author of the Greyfriars stories following an interview in the London &quot;Evening Standard&quot;.

Although he had written many thousands of stories between 1900 and 1940 for the Amalgamated Press, he had used dozens of pen names, and was himself unknown prior to the newspaper article. It was not even widely known that his many pseudonyms represented a single writer.

Hamilton was at first prevented from continuing the Greyfriars saga, as the Amalgamated Press claimed exclusive rights to all the characters except Billy Bunter, who did appear in a Sparshott story in 1946. However, by 1947 they relented, and Hamilton contracted with publisher Charles Skilton for a series of stories to be issued in hardback. The first of these, &quot;Billy Bunter of Greyfriars School&quot;, illustrated by R. J. Macdonald, was published in September 1947. The series continued for the rest of Hamilton&#x27;s life. In the 1950s the initial novels were reprinted by Cassells, who continued the series.

=== Radio ===
Billy Bunter has been adapted in a radio play several times, the last a 90-minute adaptation of the novel &quot;Billy Bunter&#x27;s Christmas Party&quot; on BBC Radio 4 &quot;Saturday Night Theatre&quot; in December 1986.

In the 1990s, a series of 15-minute dramas adapted from Charles Hamilton&#x27;s novels were performed by &quot;The Goodies&quot; (Graeme Garden, Bill Oddie, Tim Brooke-Taylor) for BBC radio.

A radio documentary about the character aired in 1980, on the 40th anniversary of the closure of &quot;The Magnet&quot;.

=== Television ===

Charles Hamilton wrote the scripts for 52 half-hour episodes of the BBC television series &quot;Billy Bunter of Greyfriars School,&quot; broadcast over seven series between 1952 and 1961, including three specials. The show was centred around Bunter, with other characters in peripheral roles.

Billy Bunter was played by Gerald Campion. The series also featured Anthony Valentine as Harry Wharton, Michael Crawford as Frank Nugent, Jeremy Bulloch as Bob Cherry, Melvyn Hayes as Harold Skinner, John Woodnutt, Raf De La Torre, Kynaston Reeves and Jack Melford as Mr Quelch, Roger Delgado as Monsieur Charpentier and Kenneth Cope as school bully Gerald Loder.

The memorable theme music was the &quot;Portsmouth&quot; section of Ralph Vaughan Williams&#x27;s &quot;Sea Songs&quot;. The episodes were transmitted live in black and white, and a dozen still exist in the BBC&#x27;s archive as telerecordings (see Wiping), including the complete third series of six episodes, one of the specials, one episode from the fifth series, and four from the sixth series.

=== Stage ===
Billy Bunter appeared in several Christmas stage shows with different casts:
* 1958. &quot;Billy Bunter&#x27;s Mystery Christmas&quot; (Palace Theatre, London)
* 1959. &quot;Billy Bunter Flies East&quot; (Victoria Palace Theatre)
* 1960. &quot;Billy Bunter&#x27;s Swiss Roll&quot; (Victoria Palace Theatre)
* 1961. &quot;Billy Bunter Shipwrecked&quot; (Victoria Palace Theatre)
* 1962. &quot;Billy Bunter&#x27;s Christmas Circus&quot; (Queen&#x27;s Theatre)
* 1963. &quot;Billy Bunter meets Magic&quot; (Shaftesbury Theatre)

=== Comics ===
After &quot;The Magnet&quot; closed in 1940, Bunter appeared in children&#x27;s comics, as a strip cartoon character: initially, from 15 June 1940 in &quot;Knockout&quot; (which, like &quot;The Magnet,&quot; was published by The Amalgamated Press). Although &quot;Knockout&quot; had begun only in 1939, it already had a circulation several times that of &quot;The Magnet&quot;. C H Chapman, the last illustrator for &quot;The Magnet&quot;, drew the first nine &quot;Knockout&quot; strips in 1939, after which several artists were tried, before Frank Minnitt established himself with a beaming and bouncy Bunter, which at first followed Chapman&#x27;s style, then later branched into a style of his own, concentrating on slapstick humour. Soon the Famous Five vanished from the strip, replaced by Jones minor, who had all the good qualities Bunter lacked, but who was prone to being led astray by Bunter. The form-master, Mr Quelch, stayed (at least in name), but he lost his dignity and aloofness.
Minnitt continued producing the strip until his death in 1958. Reg Parlett then took over until &quot;Knockout&quot; ceased publication in 1961, when the strip transferred to &quot;Valiant&quot; comic, and then to &quot;TV Comic&quot;, where it ran until 1984. Bunter also appeared in many &quot;Knockout&quot; annuals, even on some covers.

C. H. Chapman drew a strip for &quot;The Comet&quot; comic in 1956, which featured the classical old Bunter of &quot;The Magnet&quot; and the Famous Five, consisting of twelve weeks of 2-page strips (24 pages in all). Altogether, Bunter&#x27;s appearances in &quot;Comet&quot; lasted from March 1950 until June 1958, with picture stories from February 1952.

From 1955, Billy Bunter comic strips were published in the Netherlands, in the Dutch-language comic &quot;Sjors&quot;, with the character renamed &quot;Billie Turf&quot;. Bunter thus became one of the house characters of that comic and its successors, and so continued appearing in anthology-style collections in Dutch until the end of the 20th century. &quot;Billie Turf&quot; comic strip albums were published from 1963 onwards, and have continued into the 21st century. Three Billie Turf movies were made by Henk van der Linden between 1978 and 1983, mostly spelling the name of the main character as &quot;Billy Turf&quot;: &quot;Billy Turf het dikste studentje ter wereld&quot; (1978), &quot;Billy Turf Haantje de voorste&quot; (1981) and &quot;Billy Turf contra Kwel&quot; (1982).

=== Appearances in other fiction ===
* Billy Bunter appears in Alan Moore and Kevin O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier&quot;, and still resides at the now closed Greyfriars in 1958 as an old man. He sells information about the former students of the school, which is supposed to have been a recruiting ground for spies and agents for the crown since the 16th century. To avoid copyright issues, as the character was still under copyright, the graphic novel only refers to the character by his first name.
* Bunter appears in the &quot;Viz&quot; cartoon strip &quot;Baxter Basics&quot; (the title spoofing a slogan of the Conservative Party, &quot;Back to Basics&quot;) as Sir William Bunter, Conservative MP for Greyfriars Central. The character was immediately killed off by Baxter, so that he could take over that Parliamentary seat.
* In &quot;Bunter Sahib&quot; by Daniel Green, Bunter&#x27;s identical ancestor is placed in 19th-century India.
* David Hughes in &quot;But for Bunter&quot; creates the idea that the Greyfriars stories were based on real people, and set out to find them and hear their stories. This echoed the theme of a contemporary BBC radio documentary, &quot;Whatever Happened to... Henry Samuel Quelch&quot;.
* Cyril, a thinly veiled version of Billy Bunter, appears in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;The Celestial Toymaker&quot;. As the character was still under copyright, a BBC continuity announcer was obliged to deny any deliberate similarity between the characters after the episodes aired.

<text>Nueva Extremadura means &quot;New Extremadura&quot; in Spanish, and originates from Extremadura, Spain.

Nueva Extremadura could refer to

* a large jurisdiction in the north of New Spain, bordered in the 17th century to its west and south by Nueva Vizcaya, by Nuevo León to its southeast; by Nuevo Santander to its east, and, to its northeast, by Louisiana. After 1722, its northeastern border was the New Philippines. Today many identify the state of Coahuila in Mexico with the former Nueva Extremadura, but the present state&#x27;s borders are not the same. For example, Nueva Vizcaya occupied the southwest of present-day Coahuila; Nuevo León, the neighbor to the east, also had claims to eastern New Extremaduran lands; the border with the New Philippines was at the Medina river (near present-day San Antonio, in the U.S. state of Texas). From 1687, the territory&#x27;s official name was &quot;Provincia de San Francisco de Coahuila y Nueva Extremadura.&quot;

* the name originally given to Chile by Pedro de Valdivia. Its capital was then known as Santiago de Nueva Extremadura.

<doc id="667648" wikidata="Q282973" url="?curid=667648" title="Southern giant hummingbird">
<text>The southern giant hummingbird (Patagona gigas) is one of two species in the genus &quot;Patagona&quot; and the second largest hummingbird species, after its close relative the northern giant hummingbird.

== Taxonomy ==

In 2014, &quot;P. gigas&quot; was split into two species, the northern giant hummingbird (&quot;P. chaski&quot;) and the southern giant hummingbird (&quot;P. gigas&quot;). The subspecies &quot;P. g. peruviana&quot; became invalid as it was found to be a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;. This is because the putative type series for the subspecies includes both giant hummingbird species: one Southern and three Northern giant hummingbirds.

== Description ==
The subspecies are visually distinguishable. &quot;P. g. peruviana&quot; is yellowish brown overall and has white on the chin and throat, where &quot;P. g. gigas&quot; is more olive green to brown and lacks white on the chin and throat.

== Distribution and habitat ==

The giant hummingbird is widely distributed throughout the length of the Andes on both the east and west sides. It typically inhabits the higher altitude scrubland and forests that line the slopes of the Andes during the summer and then retreats to similar, lower altitude habitats in winter months. The species persists through a large altitude range, with specimens retrieved from sea level up to 4600 m. They have shown to be fairly resilient to urbanisation and agricultural activities; however, the removal of vegetation limits their distribution in dense city areas and industrial zones. The giant hummingbird migrates in summer to the temperate areas of South America, reaching as low as 44° S. Correspondingly, it migrates north to more tropical climates in winter (March–August), though not usually venturing higher than 28° S.

&#x27;&quot;P. g. peruviana&quot;&#x27; occurs from Ecuador to the southeastern mountains of Peru and &quot;&#x27;P. g. gigas&quot;&#x27; from northern Bolivia and Chile to Argentina. Contact between these previously accepted subspecies is most likely to occur around the eastern slopes of the north Peruvian Andes.

== Cultural significance ==
The giant hummingbird holds significant value for some of the aboriginal inhabitants of the Andes. The people of Chiloé Island believe that if a woman captures a hummingbird then they will gain great fertility from it. This species is a likely inspiration to the people of the Nazca culture who created the Nazca hummingbird geoglyph.

==Status==
The range of the giant hummingbird is sizable, estimated at , with total numbers of about 10,000 adults. The species is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern.

<doc id="667658" wikidata="Q208361" url="?curid=667658" title="Places in Harry Potter">
<text>The &quot;Wizarding World&quot; contains numerous settings for the events in the novels, films and other media of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; and the &quot;Fantastic Beasts&quot; series. These locations are divided into four main categories: residences, education, business, and government.

==Residences==

===Number 4, Privet Drive===
Harry is raised from infancy by his aunt Petunia Dursley and his uncle Vernon Dursley at Number 4, Privet Drive. The house is located in the fictional town of Little Whinging, which is south-west of London in the county of Surrey. Albus Dumbledore explains to Harry that when his mother sacrificed herself to save him, an &quot;ancient magic&quot; was created that protects Harry while he lives with her sister Petunia. Unbeknownst to Harry, his neighbour Arabella Figg is a Squib who was placed in Little Whinging by Dumbledore to keep an eye on Harry.

Scenes set at the Dursley residence in the film adaptation of &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; were filmed at 12 Picket Post Close in the town of Bracknell in the neighbouring county of Berkshire. Filming for subsequent films took place on a constructed set at Leavesden Film Studios, near Watford, Hertfordshire that proved to be cheaper than filming on location.

===Godric&#x27;s Hollow===
Godric&#x27;s Hollow is a fictional West Country wizarding village where Lily and James Potter lived with their infant son Harry. It has been a home to Albus Dumbledore, Bathilda Bagshot and Godric Gryffindor, after whom it was named. At the centre of the village square is a war memorial that magically transforms into a monument to the Potter family. At the end of the main street are the remains of Harry&#x27;s old home. In &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;, Harry discovers that the Godric&#x27;s Hollow cemetery where his parents are buried also contains the grave of Ignotus Peverell.
===The Burrow===

The home of the Weasley family is known as the Burrow. It is located outside the village of Ottery St Catchpole in Devon, England, near the homes of the Lovegoods, the Diggorys and the Fawcetts. The Burrow is used as the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix in &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;. The dilapidated house has seven floors and remains standing only through the use of magic.

===Little Hangleton===
Little Hangleton is a fictional Muggle village near a fictional Muggle town of Great Hangleton in the north of England, around 200 miles from Little Whinging in Surrey. It contains the graveyard where Voldemort is restored to bodily form in &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;. On a hill above the village is the former estate of the Riddle family, where Voldemort killed his father, his grandparents and the Muggle gardener Frank Bryce. Also nearby is the former home of the Gaunt family.

===Malfoy Manor===
Malfoy Manor is the home of Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy and their son Draco. The novel &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot; states that the manor is located in Wiltshire. In &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;, Voldemort uses Malfoy Manor as his headquarters and imprisons Luna Lovegood, Dean Thomas, Mr. Ollivander and Griphook in the basement. When Snatchers capture Harry, Ron, and Hermione, they are also imprisoned in the manor. Some scenes set at Malfoy Manor in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films were shot at Hardwick Hall in Derbyshire.

===Number 12, Grimmauld Place===

===Spinner&#x27;s End===
The house of Severus Snape is located on a fictional Muggle street called Spinner&#x27;s End. The street first appears in &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot; when Snape is visited by Bellatrix Lestrange and Narcissa Malfoy. In &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;, it is revealed that Snape lived in Spinner&#x27;s End as a child, and that Lily Potter and Petunia Dursley lived in the same town.
===Shell Cottage===

Shell Cottage is the home of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour after they get married. It overlooks a beach outside the village of Tinworth in Cornwall county. The cottage serves as a hiding place for Harry and his companions after they escape from Malfoy Manor. After Dobby dies, Harry buries him in the garden. The scenes set at Shell Cottage in the film adaptations of &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot; were shot on Freshwater West beach in Wales.

==Education==

=== Beauxbatons ===

The Beauxbatons Academy of Magic is a French magic school. It is first introduced in &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; when a delegation of students from Beauxbatons arrives at Hogwarts for the Triwizard Tournament. Beauxbatons is described as a boarding school located in the Pyrenees mountains. The school has a preponderance of French students, although students from Spain, Portugal, Holland, Luxembourg and Belgium also attend in large numbers. The headmistress of Beauxbatons is Olympe Maxime, and the school&#x27;s champion in the Triwizard Tournament is Fleur Delacour. In the film adaptation of &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;, all Beauxbatons students are female, while in the novel the school is co-educational. &quot;Beauxbatons&quot; translates from French as &quot;beautiful sticks&quot;.

The depiction of French students in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series has been described as stereotypical by several scholars. Marek Oziewicz has called the Beauxbatons delegation &quot;homogeneous&quot; and lacking the cultural diversity of Hogwarts. Christina Flotmann claimed that the contrast depicted between Beauxbatons and Hogwarts functions as an allusion to a historical competition between the &quot;sober and proper&quot; England and the &quot;immoral and decadent&quot; France.

=== Castelobruxo ===
Castelobruxo () is a Brazilian school of magic that specialises in Magizoology and Herbology. The exact location of the school is unknown, but it is said to appear to wizards as a golden temple, and to Muggles as nothing more than ruins. Castelobruxo is guarded by magical creatures called Caipora.

===Durmstrang===

The Durmstrang Institute for Magical Learning is a school that makes its first appearance in &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;. Like Beauxbatons, Durmstrang sends a delegation of students to Hogwarts for the Triwizard Tournament. According to the Wizarding World website, Durmstrang is located in the &quot;far Northern reaches of Europe&quot;. The school&#x27;s headmaster is the former Death Eater Igor Karkaroff, and the novel reveals that Durmstrang students are instructed in the Dark Arts. Durmstrang is portrayed as an all-boys school in the film adaptation of &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;, but is depicted as co-educational in the novel. In &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;, it is revealed that the Dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald attended Durmstrang. 

Several writers have commented on the depiction of the Durmstrang students. The British journalist Julia Eccleshare has claimed that the Durmstrang delegation is depicted as dishonest and untrustworthy. Marek Oziewicz called Durmstrang a &quot;medley of scary stereotypes&quot; of Eastern Europe. Christina Flotmann wrote that the first appearance of the Durmstrang delegation links the school with &quot;sinister literary tropes such as the Flying Dutchman.&quot; She also suggested that the name &quot;Durmstrang&quot; sounds dark and threatening. The name of the school is likely a play on the German phrase &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot;, meaning &quot;storm and stress&quot;.

===Hogwarts===
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is a British school of magic. It is the primary setting for the first six &quot;Harry Potter&quot; novels.

===Ilvermorny===

Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is an American school of magic. It first appeared in a short story by J. K. Rowling in 2016, and was subsequently depicted in the film &quot;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them&quot;. The school was founded in the seventeenth century by Isolt Sayre in Adams, Massachusetts. It is located on Mount Greylock and is concealed from Muggles with enchantments. Like Hogwarts, Ilvermorny is divided into four houses. The Ilvermorny houses are Horned Serpent, Pukwudgie, Thunderbird and Wampus, each said to represent a different aspect of the ideal wizard.

===Mahoutokoro===
Mahoutokoro is the smallest wizarding school, and is located in Japan. Students wear enchanted robes which grow in size with the wearer. The robes change colour, from faint pink to gold, as the wearer increases their knowledge of magic. The students of Mahoutokoro are known for their academic prowess and skill at Quidditch.

===Uagadou===

==Business==
===The Leaky Cauldron===
The Leaky Cauldron is described as a dark and shabby pub and inn, located on the Muggle street Charing Cross Road in London. The Leaky Cauldron is a way of entering Diagon Alley from the Muggle world. The rear of the pub opens onto a courtyard, in which a particular brick must be tapped three times to open a path to Diagon Alley.

===Diagon Alley===
Diagon Alley is a winding London high street — with a number of side-streets and back alleys — that is accessible to wizards, but hidden from Muggles. It contains Gringotts Wizarding Bank and various types of shops for magical items and creatures. 

====Shops and Places in Diagon Alley====

* Eeylops Owl Emporium sells owls, which deliver wizard mail. It is here that Rubeus Hagrid purchases the snowy owl Hedwig as a birthday gift for Harry.

Objects that have appeared in Borgin and Burkes include a cursed opal necklace, a Hand of Glory, and a Vanishing Cabinet which is used by Draco Malfoy to infiltrate Hogwarts in &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot;. Voldemort worked at Borgin and Burkes briefly during the 1940s. The shop is owned by Caractacus Burke and Mr. Borgin, though Mr. Borgin is the only owner to appear in the novels and films.

===Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, King&#x27;s Cross===
The Hogwarts Express train departs from the fictional platform 9¾ at King&#x27;s Cross railway station in central London. The platform is accessed by magically walking through a solid barrier between platforms 9 and 10. After the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; novels were published, Rowling found that she had confused the layout of King&#x27;s Cross with that of Euston station. During production of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films, the St Pancras Renaissance London Hotel, which is part of St Pancras station, was used for King&#x27;s Cross station.

A plaque depicting the supposed location Platform 9¾ was placed on a wall at King&#x27;s Cross, along with a luggage trolley &quot;stuck&quot; halfway through the wall. A wrought-iron &quot;Platform 9¾&quot; gate used in the film set is preserved at the National Railway Museum. After Alan Rickman&#x27;s death in 2016, &quot;Harry Potter&quot; fans created a memorial to the actor at Platform 9¾. A &quot;Harry Potter&quot;–themed store is also located in the station near the plaque.

There is a replica of King&#x27;s Cross at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter themed area at Universal Orlando Resort. It features a wall between Platforms 9 and 10, which visitors can &quot;walk through&quot; to access Platform 9¾.

=== Hogsmeade ===
Hogsmeade Village, or simply Hogsmeade, is a wizarding village located near Hogwarts in the north-west Scottish Highlands. It primarily consists of a single thoroughfare called High Street, which is home to shops and pubs all served by the Hogsmeade railway station nearby. Hogwarts students who are in their third year or above are permitted to visit Hogsmeade during scheduled weekends. In the films, it is only seen in under mid-winter snow.

Places in Hogsmeade

* Dervish &amp; Banges sells and repairs magical equipment.
* Gladrags Wizardwear is a clothing shop full of quirky merchandise, including a selection of strange and unusual socks.
* Honeydukes is a popular sweets shop. There is a secret passageway in the cellar that leads into Hogwarts.

Scenes depicting Hogsmeade Station in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films were filmed at Goathland railway station on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway. Extensive filming of the Hogwarts Express for the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series took place on the West Highland Line with the Glenfinnan Viaduct located at the top of Loch Shiel in Inverness-shire, Scotland. The scene of the flying Ford Anglia meeting the Express train is on this viaduct in &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; and in the following &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; film, the train stops there for the dementors&#x27; inspection just before entering Hogsmeade Station. In later films, filming took place on the same rail-line as it crossed Rannoch Moor.
* The Hog&#x27;s Head is a filthy pub owned by Aberforth Dumbledore. A few months before Harry was born, Sybill Trelawney uttered a prophecy in The Hog&#x27;s Head which connected Voldemort and Harry. In &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot;, the first meeting of Dumbledore&#x27;s Army is held at The Hog&#x27;s Head. During &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;, Aberforth reveals a secret passage in the pub that leads into Hogwarts.
* Madam Puddifoot&#x27;s is a small teashop located on a side street. On Valentine&#x27;s Day, floating cherubs throw pink confetti on visiting couples. In &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot;, Harry and Cho Chang visit Madam Puddifoot&#x27;s on Valentine&#x27;s Day.
* Scrivenshaft&#x27;s Quill Shop sells stationery items such as quills, ink, parchment and envelopes.
* The Shrieking Shack stands on the outskirts of Hogsmeade, with boarded-up windows and an overgrown garden. It was built as a hiding place for the werewolf Remus Lupin, then a Hogwarts student. He accessed the shack from a secret tunnel underneath the Whomping Willow on the Hogwarts grounds, and would stay there during his monthly transformations to avoid harming fellow students. Nearby villagers heard Lupin&#x27;s howling and a rumour started that the shack was haunted by spirits.
* The Three Broomsticks is an inn and pub known for its delicious butterbeer.
* Zonko&#x27;s Joke Shop sells joke and trick items.

===La Place Cachée, Paris===
La Place Cachée or The Hidden Square, as seen in the film, &quot;Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald&quot;, is close to the River Seine and is the Parisian equivalent to Diagon Alley in London to hide the shops and businesses of the Wizarding World from Muggles. It is accessed via a portal in a brick pedestal under a verdigris bronze statue of a reclining woman. Seen in 1927, its style and design is heavily influenced by the Art Nouveau style from late 19th and early 20th centuries.

==Government==

===Azkaban===
Azkaban is a prison for criminals of the British and Irish wizarding world. According to &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot;, Azkaban is located somewhere in the North Sea. It is guarded by Dementors, which render the inmates incapable of happiness. According to Sirius Black, many inmates simply stop eating and eventually die of starvation. It was considered impossible to escape from Azkaban until Sirius managed to do it. Performing any of the Unforgivable Curses on a human is punishable by a life sentence in the prison, although there are occasions when Aurors are allowed to perform those curses. Following Voldemort&#x27;s demise, Kingsley Shacklebolt becomes Minister of Magic and ends the use of Dementors at Azkaban.

===Ministry of Magic===

The Ministry of Magic is the government of the wizarding community of Britain and Ireland.

===Magical Congress of the United States of America===
The Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA), as seen in the film, &quot;Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them&quot;, is the magical body in charge of governing the wizarding population of the United States as an equivalent to the Ministry of Magic. The MACUSA is led by a President instead of a Minister. It is located in a tower in the Wizarding World — all within the same footprint as the Woolworth Building in Lower Manhattan, New York City — but far larger on the inside, with a vast atrium and extensive basement levels, and at ground level is only accessible by a specific side door.

===The French Ministry of Magic===
The French Ministry of Magic, as seen in the film, &quot;Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald&quot;, is in central Paris and is accessed via a hidden lift in the centre of a quiet square that descends through a translucent glass atrium. At night, it is patrolled and defended by matagots, large black cat-like spirits. Seen in 1927, its style and design is heavily influenced by the Art Nouveau movement from late 19th and early 20th centuries.

===The German Ministry of Magic===
The German Ministry of Magic, as seen in the film, &quot;Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore&quot;, is in central Berlin and is a large imposing triangular building in the centre of an arrowhead-shaped forum full of imposing columns. Its interior design of the large halls with vast murals is heavily influenced by the Reichstag building and its offices are sparely decorated, dominated by green-tinged glass, chrome, and black bakelite. Seen in 1932, its style and design is heavily influenced by the Bauhaus school of the Art Deco movement that dominated the 1920s and 1930s.

===St Mungo&#x27;s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries===
Located in London, St Mungo&#x27;s Hospital in the Wizarding World is for treating witches and wizards who have suffered magical injuries or are infected by magical diseases. It also acts as a long-term asylum to keep those left totally and permanently disabled by magic or suffering dangerous conditions — such as an obscurial — locked away in order to prevent any exposure the Wizarding World to Muggles.

===Nurmengard===
Nurmengard is a prison that the Dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald built to incarcerate Muggles and foes. After Albus Dumbledore defeated Grindelwald, the prisoners were released and Grindelwald himself was imprisoned in the top-most cell. In &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;, Voldemort arrives at Nurmengard seeking information about the Elder Wand. When Grindelwald refuses to tell him anything, Voldemort kills him.

===Erkstag ===
Erkstag is a prison in Berlin that is supposedly closed and decommissioned, but is still surreptitiously being operated and is accessed via a closed U-Bahn entrance. It appears a vast underground quarry with a spiral walkway down to its depths. It is populated by thousands of baby manticores with an enormous mother manticore that snatches away prisoners, who hang inverted on the perimeter of the walkway, from time to time and injecting them with an acidic venom that dissolves the body so she can feed the remains to her offspring.

<doc id="667665" wikidata="Q913796" url="?curid=667665" title="Honda S2000">
<text>The Honda S2000 is a front-mid engine open top sports car that was manufactured by Japanese automobile manufacturer Honda, from 1999 until 2009. First shown as a concept car called the SSM at the Tokyo Motor Show in 1995, the production version was launched on April 15, 1999, to celebrate the company&#x27;s 50th anniversary. The S2000 is named for its engine displacement of two litres, while &quot;S&quot; stood for &quot;sports&quot; carrying on in the tradition of the S500, S600, and S800 roadsters of the 1960s.
Several revisions were made throughout the car&#x27;s production life, including changes to the engine, gearbox, suspension, interior and exterior. Officially two variants exist: the initial launch model was given the chassis code AP1; though cosmetically similar, the facelifted version, known as the AP2 in North America and Japan, incorporated significant changes to the drivetrain and suspension. Production of the S2000 ceased on August 19, 2009.

The Honda S2000 was notable for its exceptional specific power output of about per litre, or about two horsepower per cubic inch, the highest of any mass production, naturally aspirated engined car, until 2010.

The S2000 has since become a legitimate modern classic car, having seen a significant appreciation in price for valued examples in good condition. In the JDM community and the car community as a whole, the most sought-after models are special edition productions such as the CR (Club Racer) in the USA market; the standard AP1 and AP2 models have achieved collectible status as well.

==Concept car==

Introduced at the 1995 Tokyo Motor Show, the Honda Sport Study Model concept car was the design study for the production version of the S2000. The inspirations for the concept car were the first prototype Honda Formula One racing car, the Honda RA270 from 1963 and the Caterham Seven. The SSM was a front-mid engine rear-wheel-drive roadster powered by a inline four-cylinder engine. It featured a rigid &#x27;high X-bone frame&#x27; which Honda claimed improved the vehicle&#x27;s rigidity and collision safety. The concept car was constructed with aluminum body panels and featured a 50:50 weight distribution. The SSM was designed by Honda&#x27;s own staff, should not be confused with the Argento Vivo roadster concept designed by Pininfarina, introduced same year and powered by a Honda in-line four cylinder engine as well.

The SSM appeared in many automotive shows for several years afterwards, hinting at the possibility of a production version, which Honda announced in 1999.

==Development==
The whole development process was carried out by Honda designers and engineers. The development team was sticking curiously to the classic Honda values, instead of marketing requirements, as former Chief Engineer Shigeru Uehara revealed in an interview:

&quot;You will be surprised to know that we had very little input from the marketing people. This was a deliberate move, as we wanted to create something to please us as an engineering team, rather than try and please everyone. If you listen to everyone, included everything they ask for, all cars end up the same. We wanted a vehicle that was more focused - more Honda.&quot;

The development team focused on keeping the compact size and low weight of the concept car according to Uehara:

&quot;The reaction garnered by the SSM meant we had to keep the S2000 as close as possible to the concept car. Using a Civic CRX Del Sol-based mule, it was obvious the packaging was going to be tight, but the early prototype was tried against rival models at Suzuka, and it looked so right, we felt obliged to continue down the same development path.&quot;

The car was tested primarily on race tracks and mountain roads of Japan and Europe, reflecting well the purpose of the roadster:

&quot;As the project evolved, to make sure we were on the right track, we did a lot of real world testing - first in Hokkaido, and then all over Europe, taking in an average of 450 miles (720 km) a day at high speed. We wanted a car that delivered just the right amount of tension for the driver, with direct and linear response, sharp handling and the necessary power and torque for fast progress and safe overtaking, but nothing too excessive. The final fine-tuning was done on the track to ensure the handling was right without being that sharp that the car became unruly, whatever the weather, followed by more road testing, including a fair bit around the Hakone area. Ultimately, overall driving feel and sound were considered more important than outright speed.&quot;

==AP1 (1999–2003)==

The S2000 was introduced in 1999 for the 2000 model year and was given the chassis designation of &quot;AP1&quot;. It features a front-mid engine rear-wheel-drive layout with power delivered by a inline four-cylinder DOHC VTEC engine. The engine (codenamed F20C) generates power outputs of , and of torque depending on the target market. The engine is mated to a six-speed manual transmission and Torsen limited-slip differential. The S2000 achieved what Honda claimed as the highest specific output of a normally aspirated production automobile engine in the world. The most powerful version; the JDM F20C was rated at or per litre as a result of a higher 11.7:1 compression ratio.


Notable features include independent double wishbone suspension, electrically assisted steering and integrated roll hoops. The car had wheels with Bridgestone Potenza S-02 tyres equipped. The compact and lightweight engine, mounted entirely behind the front axle, allow the S2000 to achieve a 50:50 front/rear weight distribution and lower rotational inertia. The dashboard got similar design to late eighties-early nineties McLaren-Honda Formula-1 racing cars (MP4/5, MP4/6 and MP4/7), as a reference to the racing pedigree of high rev line and output Honda engines. An electrically powered vinyl top with internal cloth lining and plastic rear window was standard, with an aluminum hardtop available as an optional extra (in 2001). Honda initially offered the S2000 in Berlina Black, New Formula Red, Grand Prix White, and Silverstone Metallic exterior colours in the US domestic market. On some other markets Monte Carlo Blue Pearl and Spa Yellow Pearl / Indy Yellow Pearl were also available from the beginning.

The 2001 model was largely unchanged; Honda added a digital clock to the radio display and made the rear wind blocker standard. Honda also added Spa Yellow exterior colour to the US domestic market lineup. For the 2002 model year, suspension settings were revised and the plastic rear window was replaced by a glass unit incorporating an electric defroster. Other updates included slightly revised tail lamps with chrome rings, an upgraded radio with separate tweeters, a leather-wrapped gearshift knob, leatherette console cover and a revised engine control unit. Honda added Suzuka Blue Metallic and Sebring Silver Metallic exterior colours to the US domestic market lineup.

The AP1 was manufactured until 2003 at Honda&#x27;s Takanezawa plant, alongside the NSX and Insight hybrid.

===Type V (Japan - 2000)===
Honda announced the S2000 Type V on July 7, 2000, in the Japanese domestic market. Notable changes from the standard model include variable gear ratio steering (VGS), a steering system that continuously changes steering ratio based upon vehicle speed and steering angle to provide improved handling as well as more comfortable maneuvering in tight low-speed situations such as parking. It was the first system of its kind to be incorporated into a production car. The lock-to-lock steering ratio was reduced to 1.4 turns (versus 2.4 for the base model). Honda outfitted Type V cars with revised damper units, stabilizers and limited-slip differentials to &quot;complement the VGS&quot;. Equipped cars came with a special steering wheel and a VGS badge on the rear. The Type V was retired upon the introduction of the Type S in 2007.

=== 20th Anniversary Prototype (Japan - 2019) ===

To mark the 20th anniversary of the S2000, Honda unveiled the S2000 20th Anniversary Prototype at the 2019 Tokyo Auto Salon. Essentially a restomod, the prototype was based on the AP1 and featured an updated exterior, suspension and audio system. Honda later made parts for the prototype available for purchase, including the Modulo X front bumper, sport suspension system and rear diffuser, alongside other S2000 parts as an effort to help owners keep their cars on the road.

==AP2 (2004–2009)==
The 2004 model S2000 underwent several significant changes. Production moved to Suzuka. The new model introduced wheels and Bridgestone RE-050 tyres along with a retuned suspension to reduce oversteer. The spring rates and shock absorber damping were altered and the suspension geometry was modified to improve stability by reducing toe-in changes under cornering loads. The subframe also received a revision in design to achieve high rigidity. In the gearbox the brass synchronizers were replaced with carbon fibre. In addition, cosmetic changes were made to the exterior with new front and rear bumpers, revised headlight assemblies, new LED tail-lights, and oval-tipped exhaust pipes. Although all the cosmetic, suspension and most drivetrain upgrades were included on the Japanese, Australian and European models, they retained the 2.0-litre F20C engines and remained designated as AP1 (facelift) models.

For the North American market, the updates also included the introduction of a larger version of the F20C (with a designation of F22C1); this larger engine gave the new model a chassis designation of AP2. The engine&#x27;s stroke was lengthened, increasing its displacement to . At the same time, the redline and fuel cutoff were reduced from 8,800 rpm and 9,000 rpm to 8,000 rpm and 8,200 rpm respectively, mandated by the longer travel of the pistons. Peak torque increased by 6% to at 6,800 rpm while power output remained unchanged at achieved at a lower 7,800 rpm. In conjunction with the introduction of the F22C1, Honda also changed the transmission gear ratios by shortening the first five gears and lengthening the sixth.
In 2006, the F22C1 was also introduced to the Japanese market, with a power output of and . The F20C continued in all other markets. The 2006 model introduced a drive by wire throttle, an electronic stability control system, new wheels, and one new exterior color, Laguna Blue Pearl. Interior changes included revised seats and additional stereo speakers integrated into the headrests.

===Club Racer (U.S. - 2008)===
The 2008 model year marked the first time the S2000 was offered in more than one trim level in the United States. In addition to the base model, Honda offered a more track-oriented version of the S2000, distinguished by reduced weight, fewer amenities, and an increase in performance. The S2000 Club Racer made its world debut at the New York International Auto Show on 4 April 2007. Changes for the CR included a lower ratio steering rack, revised exhaust system, black lug nuts, darker colored wheels, clear side markers, stiffer suspension and new Bridgestone Potenza RE070 tyres that were 10mm wider at the rear (255/40R-17 vice the base model&#x27;s 245/40R-17). A revised body kit, composed of a redesigned front lip, and a large spoiler, were wind-tunnel tested and claimed to reduce the overall coefficient of lift by 70–80%. The power folding soft top was removed and replaced with a Berlina Black hard top (regardless of the car&#x27;s body paint colour), while the space into which the soft top would normally fold when lowered was filled with additional chassis bracing and topped off with a body-color tonneau cover. Honda also used a CR-unique yellow-lettered spherical aluminum shift knob which rests 12.6 mm lower than the base model&#x27;s cylindrical shift knob (aluminum/leather wrapped). The CR knob provided a 6 percent reduction in shift stroke, and correspondingly presented a 10 percent higher shift load effort.

CR models were only available with yellow and black Alcantara interiors. Faux carbon fiber overlays on the center console and radio door were unique to the CR trim, as was a peak power indicator light on the instrument gauge cluster, which flashes when the engine is producing its peak power output. To reduce weight and lower the center of gravity, the spare tire was omitted and air conditioning and stereo were offered only as options. Net weight savings without the additional hardtop came to relative to the standard model. The engine in the S2000 CR was unchanged from the standard trim. Shigeru Uehara, the designer of the S2000, stated that the CR was positioned between the Type S and a hypothetical Type R. However, Honda never made an official Type R S2000 variant.

Production volume of fewer than 2,000 units was expected at launch, and 668 were made for the 2008 model year, representing just over a quarter of the total U.S. production. Honda continued to offer both the standard and CR versions unchanged for the 2009 model year, but with flagging sales caused by the 2008 automotive industry crisis, the S2000 was cancelled mid-model-year. Just 355 U.S. S2000s were manufactured for 2009, of which 31 were CR models. Thus, total CR production over the two model years was 699 units.

===Type S (Japan - 2008)===

The Japanese domestic market received the Type S edition for the last two years of production (2008–2009). Changes are similar to the U.S. market&#x27;s CR edition, sharing the weight loss, a purpose built bodykit providing much higher downforce, bespoke wheels and interior. Although it shares the wheels with the CR edition, the Type S retains the rear tyre size of 245/40R-17 for better handling. A specific Type S suspension setup with improved geometry was designed to enhance the handling, the setup is stiffer but more compromising than the CR setup to suit it better to everyday spirited driving and the Japanese &quot;touge&quot; experience. The Type S retains its soft top folding mechanism.

The interior is a Type S specific yellow and black Alcantara material scheme (similar to the CR). Leather interior from the standard S2000 was available as a no cost option. The aluminum shift knob with reduced shift stroke is shared with the CR. While the CR is designed to be a pure track car, the Type S is designed for improved handling and retains some creature comforts. Only 1,755 units of the Type S were made and sold exclusively in Japan. (2007:168 units, 2008:827 units, 2009:737 units, 2010 [Jan-Jun]:23 units)

===GT (U.K. - 2002)===
In the United Kingdom, from 2002, the S2000 was offered in both roadster and GT trim. The GT featured a removable hard-top and an outside temperature gauge. On-the-road prices of these trims were £27,300 and £27,850 respectively.

===Ultimate Edition and GT Edition 100 (Europe - 2009)===
The S2000 Ultimate Edition (continental Europe) and GT Edition 100 (UK market) were limited versions of the S2000 released to commemorate the end of production. Notable changes on both of the cars included Grand Prix White body colour, a removable hard top, graphite-colored alloy wheels with black wheel bolts, aluminium ball gear lever, black S2000 badging and red leather interior with red coloring for stitching on the gear lever gaiter.

The Ultimate Edition was unveiled at the 2009 Geneva Motor Show and went on sale in March 2009. The GT Edition 100 was a limited run of 100 units made specifically for the UK market. In addition to the Ultimate Edition&#x27;s specification, it features a numbered plaque on the kick-plate indicating which vehicle in the series it is (numbers ranging from 1 to 101. Number 49 was omitted).

==Motorsport==
The Honda S2000 has been used in various forms of motorsport. In the Super Taikyu Series, the car has won numerous championships in the ST-4 class and scored class victories at the Tokachi 24 Hours race. It has also won its class at the Nürburgring 24 Hours, and won at the SCCA National Championship Runoffs. The S2000 is popular in autocross and track day events.

In time attack competition, an S2000 modified by Top Fuel set the lap record for rear-wheel drive cars at the Tsukuba Circuit in 2008, which it held for three years. With further modifications, the car produced tuning car lap records at Fuji Speedway, Suzuka Circuit, Okayama International Circuit and Autopolis in 2014 and 2015, while its laptime of 51.762 seconds at Tsukuba set in 2016 ranks among the fastest ever recorded for time attack cars.

In drifting, the S2000 scored several podiums in Formula D during the mid-2000s, including a win at an invitational event at Irwindale, which featured the top 16 drivers from the series&#x27; 2004 season. Tetsuya Hibino competed with a 2JZ-powered S2000 in the D1 Grand Prix series between 2017 and 2018, taking a solo run win at the 2017 Tsukuba round.

==Sales and production==
After several years of steady production, sales of the roadster began falling dramatically starting in 2006, and the trend accelerated during the 2008 automotive industry crisis. In 2008, only 2,538 units were sold in the U.S. - a 74% decline from the 2002 sales peak. In November of that year, for the first time since its launch, only 90 new S2000s were sold nationwide during a calendar month.

Production of the S2000 ceased in June 2009 and plans for a successor were scrapped in the aftermath of the automotive industry crisis; Honda reaffirmed their stance on plans for a successor for the S2000 after patents and trademark filings for what would be the Honda Sports Vision Gran Turismo surfaced in 2015, following the launch of the aforementioned concept car specifically designed for the &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; series. During the 2009 announcement of the vehicle&#x27;s production end, Honda reported that worldwide sales through the end of 2008 totaled 110,673 units. The final official production figure was 113,889 by the end of 2009. Different sources indicate different sales numbers for Europe, presumably because Honda indicates final numbers including States entered the EU during the production run, but it should be around 19,800-20,700. On the UK market more than 70% of the originally registered cars still remain, means currently nearly 6,300 cars registered out of 8,500 sold.

*Note: No new cars were produced in 2010 and 2011; sales represent clearance of residual inventory.Figures are not directly comparable as they are obtained through different methodologies in different markets.

<doc id="667666" wikidata="Q892278" url="?curid=667666" title="Sixth-rate">
<text>In the rating system of the Royal Navy used to categorise sailing warships, a sixth-rate was the designation for small warships mounting between 20 and 28 carriage-mounted guns on a single deck, sometimes with smaller guns on the upper works and sometimes without. It thus encompassed ships with up to 30 guns in all. In the first half of the 18th century the main battery guns were 6-pounders, but by mid-century these were supplanted by 9-pounders. 28-gun sixth-rates were classed as frigates, those smaller as &#x27;post ships&#x27;, indicating that they were still commanded by a full (&#x27;post&#x27;) captain, as opposed to sloops of 18 guns and less, which were under commanders.

== Rating ==
Sixth-rate ships typically had a crew of about 150–240 men, and measured between 450 and 550 tons. A 28-gun ship would have about 19 officers; commissioned officers would include the captain, and two lieutenants; warrant officers would include the master, ship&#x27;s surgeon, and purser. The other quarterdeck officers were the chaplain and a Royal Marines lieutenant. The ship also carried the standing warrant officers, the gunner, the bosun and the carpenter, and two master&#x27;s mates, four midshipmen, an assistant surgeon, and a captain&#x27;s clerk. The rest of the men were the crew, or the &#x27;lower deck&#x27;. They slept in hammocks and ate their simple meals at tables, sitting on wooden benches. A sixth-rate carried about 23 marines, while in a strong crew the bulk of the rest were experienced seamen rated &#x27;able&#x27; or &#x27;ordinary&#x27;. In a weaker crew there would be a large proportion of &#x27;landsmen&#x27;, adults who were unused to the sea.

The larger sixth-rates were those of 28 guns (including four smaller guns mounted on the quarterdeck) and were classed as frigates. The smaller sixth-rates with between 20 and 24 guns, still all ship-rigged and sometimes flush-decked vessels, were generally designated as post ships. These vessels could perhaps be considered comparable to the light cruisers and destroyers of more recent times, respectively.

Regardless of armament, sixth-rates were known as &quot;post ships&quot; because, being &quot;rated&quot;, they were still large enough to have a post-captain in command instead of a lieutenant or commander.

During the Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815), the now elderly sixth-rate frigates were found to be too small for their expected duties, which were more easily performed by fifth-rate frigates. Most were phased out without replacement, although a few lasted in auxiliary roles until after 1815.

== In fiction ==
The Aubrey–Maturin series of novels by Patrick O&#x27;Brian features the sixth-rate ship HMS &quot;Surprise&quot; as the frigate captained by Jack Aubrey. It is based on the actual historical frigate of the same name, formerly the French ship &quot;Unité&quot;, which was captured and renamed by the Royal Navy in 1796. The &quot;Surprise&quot; was portrayed in the 2003 film &quot;Master and Commander&quot; which was adapted from the novels.

In the novel &quot;Mason and Dixon&quot; by Thomas Pynchon, the title characters set sail for Sumatra in 1761 to view the Venus transit in the sixth-rate ship HMS &quot;Seahorse&quot;.

The novel &quot;The Watering Place of Good Peace&quot; by Geoffrey Jenkins includes a fictional sixth-rate ship called HMS &quot;Plymouth Sound&quot;, which is described as being one of the fastest sailing ships in the Royal Navy.

In &quot;Hornblower and the Atropos&quot; by C.S. Forester, the titular character – Horatio Hornblower – commands a sixth-rate ship of 22 guns.

<text>Huittinen () is a town and municipality in Finland. It is located in the Satakunta region, southeast of Pori and southwest of Tampere. The town has a population of () and covers an area of of which is water. The population density is .

The town is unilingually Finnish. Municipality of Vampula was consolidated with Huittinen on 1 January 2009.

The Huittinen coat of arms is designed by Erkki Honkanen in 1953.

Risto Ryti, the president of Finland in 1940–44, was born in Huittinen in 1889.

== History ==
In 1904, one of Finland&#x27;s most famous ancient objects, the Elk&#x27;s Head of Huittinen from the Stone Age, was found in the village of Palojoki in Huittinen. It is now in the National Museum. In addition to the artefact finds, there is a comb ceramic residence in Korkeakoski and a younger burial site in Sammu village, as well as some cemeteries. Researchers have concluded that the Huittinen got their first inhabitants mainly from the northwest, from the direction of the lower course of the Kokemäenjoki.

Huittinen is mentioned as a churchwarden in 1414. The gray stone church of the Huittinen was built at the end of the 15th century. The church burned down in 1783 and a high tower was added during the repair. On flat terrain, the tower can be seen far into the surroundings. Before the stone church, there was a wooden church in Huittinen.

The Juusela farm in Nanhia village has been considered the seat of the Juslenius family. The most famous member of the family was bishop Daniel Juslenius. Vicar Nils Idman Sr., known for his financial and scientific interests, also came from the same house. Archbishop Erkki Kaila&#x27;s father, Jonatan Johansson, served as assistant keeper of Huittinen in the 1860s.

Lauttakylä, the center of Huittinen, became Southwest Finland&#x27;s most important land transport hub long before the age of cars. The railways were far away and the waterways were not navigable for long distances. However, a passenger ship operated from Lauttakylä along the Kokemäenjoki to the Kyttälä railway station on the Tampere–Pori line right from the completion of the line until the 1930s. Lauttakylä was born at the intersection of the old Helsinki–Pori and Turku–Tampere roads, where Loimijoki was crossed by ferry. Bus service from Lauttakylä to all directions started as early as the early 1920s.

== Geography ==
In terms of surface forms, Huittinen is mostly flat and the lowest areas are located along the rivers in the central part of the city. The bedrock, which is mostly granodiorite, is not visible anywhere in the city area. The highest hills, reaching more than 100 meters above sea level, are located in the south in the direction of Vampula. Well-known viewpoints are Ripovuori, Kännönvuori and Korkeakallio. A ridge section runs through Huittinen, which comes from the northwest from the Kokemäki side and continues through Huhtamo to the Punkalaidun side.

== Politics ==
Results of the 2011 Finnish parliamentary election in Huittinen:

* True Finns 29.7%
* Centre Party 24.1%
* National Coalition Party 18.1%
* Social Democratic Party 13.9%
* Left Alliance 7.2%
* Green League 3.4%
* Christian Democrats 3.1%

== Religion ==
According to the 2018 regional distribution, Huittinen has the following congregations of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland:

* Huittinen congregation
** Vampula chapel congregation

Among the congregations of the Finnish Orthodox Church, the Turku Orthodox congregation operates in the Huittinen area.

== Economy ==
The Jokisivu gold mine in Huittinen is operated by Polar Mining, with an annual production of around 300–400 kilos of gold.

== Transport ==
Thanks to its location, Huittinen is a very busy hub for bus traffic. The current bus station was completed in 1965. Before Huittisten became a town, Lauttakylän Auto was Finland&#x27;s largest company operating bus services from the rural municipality, and Huittinen bus station was Finland&#x27;s busiest rural bus station.

There is no train station in Huittinen, but there is a section of the Tampere-Pori railway line of about one hundred meters running in the municipality&#x27;s territory – at the northern end of Kuukinmaantie. The nearest train stations are in Kokemäki and Sastamala.

<text>The Wading River is a tributary of the Mullica River, approximately long, in southern New Jersey in the United States. The river drains a rural forested area of the Pinelands, one of the most pristine areas along the coast of the northeastern United States.

==Course==
The primary source of the Wading River is its West Branch, which rises north of Chatsworth in central Burlington County, south of Brendan T. Byrne State Forest, and flows generally south through Wharton State Forest. It joins the Oswego River near Harrisville to form the main stem of the Wading River. The Wading flows southeast and joins the Mullica River from the north near its mouth, approximately north of Atlantic City. The lower of the river forms a navigable estuary, an arm of the estuary of the Mullica, just west of the Garden State Parkway.

Like the Mullica, the river is noted for its extensive wetlands, including large runs of striped bass.

<doc id="667677" wikidata="Q145401" url="?curid=667677" title="Zaman Shah Durrani">
<text>Zaman Shah Durrani, or Zaman Shah Abdali (Persian: ; 1767 – 1844) was the third King of the Durrani Empire from 1793 until 1801. An ethnic Pashtun of the Sadozai clan, Zaman Shah was the grandson of Ahmad Shah Durrani and the fifth son of Timur Shah Durrani.

== Early years ==
Zaman Shah was born as the son of Timur Shah Durrani. The year of his birth is disputed however. Fayz Muhammad gives 1767 as his year of birth, while Noelle-Karimi gives the year as 1770. Zaman Shah had always wanted to follow his father, Timur Shah Durrani with his conquests in Punjab, however Timur Shah Durrani did not allow it, and Zaman Shah very early grew interests of being like his grandfather, Ahmad Shah Durrani, as a child he had dreamt of conquering Hindustan, but to no avail, as his father did not allow Zaman Shah to accompany him on his campaigns. Zaman Shah Durrani took the Durrani throne in 1793 after his father&#x27;s death.

== Reign ==
=== Opposition ===
When Zaman had taken the throne, he was opposed by many of his brothers, among whom were Mahmud Shah Durrani and Humayun who had their respective regional zones of influence. To deal with these claims over succession, an election was held in Kabul over who the next Durrani ruler would be, Abbas Mirza was a running candidate and would have taken the vote if the election was held right after Timur Shah Durrani&#x27;s death, however with the given time, Barakzai tribal leaders and Zaman&#x27;s influence had by then grew, allowing him to receive the popular vote and become the ruler, specifically supported by Chief Payandah Khan.

=== Securing the throne ===
Having now been declared King of the Durrani Empire and recognized by all but his brothers, he led his brothers to Kabul, where he imprisoned his opposing brothers. He implicated a diet to starve his brothers, with a diet of two to three ounces of bread each day, with the effect, the brothers gave in on the sixth day, where they had given in and recognized Zaman Shah as the King of the Durrani Empire. The Princes were then freed but kept under surveillance in the Bala Hissar, Kabul.

=== Reforms ===
Zaman Shah had wanted a ministry and cabinet that would be loyal to him and of his people, as a result he had replaced his old ministry and replaced them with loyal Pashtuns devoted to Zaman Shah, strengthening his position on the throne. Zaman Shah had also led hard campaigns to tie himself to the chiefs who had opposed him in the Kabul election, where in most cases he succeeded, bringing more strength to his rule and throne, to those who did oppose him still as the chiefs, he put them to death.

=== March on Kandahar against Humayun ===
Zaman Shah, wanting to further secure his throne from the growing popularity of Mahmud Shah in Herat and older brother Humayun in Kandahar wanted to mobilise his army to march on Kandahar to prevent them uniting against his rule. Humayun, disregarded the advise to stay in defense within Kandahar&#x27;s great walls and wait for Mahmud Shah reinforcements to arrive from Herat, and marched out to meet Zaman Shah&#x27;s army and was defeated at Qalati Ghilji and forced to flee to Baluchistan. With his victory, Zaman Shah, secured Kandahar. 

Before being able to move against Mahmud Shah in Herat, he had received news of possible rebellion on the outer provinces of the empire, and that his presence was urgently required in Kabul. He signed a truce with Mahmud Shah and returned to Kabul as a result.

=== Return to Kabul ===
Having then recaptured Kandahar and being recalled, he had led a reign of terror, seeing his father, Timur Shah Durrani&#x27;s implicated systems as too lenient, every person correlating to any influence within the Durrani Empire was watched upon. Zaman Shah also ordered the execution of anybody who opposed him, often leading to massacres within the city to rout out small groups of resistance and opposition. The same Barakzai tribal leaders, who had led Zaman Shah in effort to consolidate his holdings and capture the throne were deprived of all power, with other chiefs also being arrested, or put to death. The outerlying provinces of the empire, having heard of the news in the capital had led prolific revolts in return, not wanting to meet the same fate as many of the nobles in Kabul; revolts broke out in Kashmir and Punjab; and Sindh had severed itself of influence and correlation to the Durrani Empire; and the Uzbeks had crossed the Oxus.

=== Second march to Kandahar and Sindh ===
Zaman Shah, now seeing his realm disintegrating, had marched to Peshawar, where he heard the news of his brother, Humayun, with the assistance of the Talpur in Sindh had seized Kandahar. He turned from Peshawar to meet him at Kandahar. Humayun was betrayed by the Afghans in Kandahar, forcing him to flee again, this time to Sindh, but then attempted to escape to Herat in the domain of his brother Mahmud Shah. Humayun was captured with a detachment of horses and ordered by Zaman Shah to be put to death, making sure Kandahar wouldn&#x27;t be under threat from him once again.

Zaman Shah, having been forced to turn his expedition because of the Talpur had marched on Sindh, enraged and with the ideal of reintegrating the province into the Durrani Empire ever since it started to drift off from his father, Timur Shah Durrani&#x27;s reign. When Zaman Shah entered Sindh, he heard the news of his brother, Mahmud Shah had been marching on Kandahar to cut him off from Afghanistan. Zaman Shah had then spared the Talpur but put under the conditions that they would tribute to the Durrani Empire once again, and confirmed the Talpur chief, Fath Ali Khan. With the Talpur&#x27;s dealt with, he returned to Kandahar to deal with his brother Mahmud Shah.

=== Battle with Mahmud Shah ===
Zaman Shah, after dealing with the Talpur had marched back to Kandahar to prevent Mahmud Shah from seizing Kandahar. Mahmud Shah, having heard the news of his brother returning had set up position in the Siah-band range, remaining there until he heard further news of Zaman Shah&#x27;s movements. Mahmud Shahhad heard his brother, Zaman Shah, was but three marches away from him after leaving Kandahar, as a result he broke up his armies and moved to the plains, meeting Zaman Shah&#x27;s army at Gurak Village. The two armies had fought, with the fight seemingly a close victory for Mahmud Shah initially, however his men finally gave way, leading to the decisive victory for Zaman Shah. Mahmud Shah had first fled to Farah, Afghanistan, then moving to Herat, where by inciting the Uzbeks to attack had made Mahmud Shah pardoned by Zaman Shah, allowing Mahmud Shah to continue his affairs in government.

=== Dealing with revolts and march to Punjab ===
Zaman Shah, having dealt with Mahmud Shah had coerced the Uzbeks into a treaty after they heard of Mahmud Shah&#x27;s defeat in Garuk Village. In revolt, Kashmir was also put down by a dispatchment of forces under Zaman Shah. Now having consolidated his realm, Zaman Shah, wanting to remake his grandfather&#x27;s conquests in India had mobilized in Peshawar, planning to invade Punjab. In November 1796, Zaman Shah had readied his army and was prepared to march to Punjab, however there was pressing issues throughout the empire that always needed him, when he marched on Punjab, and had just captured Lahore. However, intelligence in Kabul had notified Zaman Shah about Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar&#x27;s invasion of Khorasan Province and had taken Mashhad on May 14, which was ruled by the Afsharid dynasty (vassals of the Durrani Empire). As a result, Zaman Shah was forced to withdraw and prepare an army to invade Khorasan. However, due to Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar&#x27;s assassination on 17 June 1797, one of Nader&#x27;s grandsons had resumed control and declared his independence.

== Later Reign ==
=== Zaman Shah retakes Herat ===
Zaman Shah, seeing Mahmud Shah as a future threat if the Persians had ever invaded again, had decided to try and retake Herat and strip Mahmud of his administrative titles. Zaman Shah had met Mahmud at a battle near Girishk. He defeated Mahmud Shah and this allowed him to besiege Herat. The city however, held out. Eventually, Mahmud Shah&#x27;s mother had broken a deal between the two brothers. The terms of which would be Zaman Shah being recognized as King of the Durrani Empire in exchange for keeping his governorship of Herat. However, nobody had seemed to give notice to Kamran Mirza, Son of Mahmud Shah. Kamran Shah, with the army of the city, noticing Zaman Shah leaving back to Helmand, led his armies in pursuit. Once Kamran had left, Qilij Khan, the governor of Herat in place for Kamran, while he was on his campaign had led a rebellion and opened the gates to Zaman Shah. Mahmud Shah and Kamran had then fled to Tehran in Persia.

=== Second and Third march to Punjab ===

With the Khorasan Province situation having blown over, Zaman Shah had returned to Peshawar to invade Punjab again, he advanced as far as Lahore and had planned to further invade into India. Zaman Shah had then heard the news that Mahmud Shah was in revolt and was planning to march on Kandahar once again. Zaman Shah, annoyed, and having enough of these constant issues had brought over one of Mahmud Shah&#x27;s chief generals, occupied Herat, and forced him to flee to Persia.

Having now dealt with Mahmud Shah, Zaman Shah had resumed his plans for invading Punjab and India, he led his armies to Peshawar and had advanced as far as Lahore once again, before he was recalled by his intelligence, that the Persians, under Fath-Ali Shah Qajar, were threatening Khorasan Province once again, this had forced Zaman Shah to withdraw to Peshawar and then Herat. The action that had prompted the Qajars to threaten the Durranis was provocated by the British East India Company, where the East India company had heard of Zaman Shah&#x27;s attempts to repeat his fathers success in Hindustan. However, despite the Persian invasion, its attempted were foiled as Fath-Ali Shah Qajar had advanced as far as Sabzwar, and then withdrew. Though the invasion had failed, it had distracted Zaman Shah and forced him to hole in Kandahar for the winter. According to historian Hari Gupta, Zaman Shah&#x27;s costly failed campaigns against the Sikhs, specifically failure to reach Delhi, led him to lose his crown as well as his eyes.

=== Mahmud Shah&#x27;s return to Herat ===
Mahmud Shah, having seen Zaman Shah distracted, had mobilized a force of over 10,000 men from the outer lying provinces of Persia, he had then led these forces to Herat, where Zaman Shah, having heard of the news had also led his armies to march to Herat. However, Mahmud Shah&#x27;s allies had seen how he failed against Zaman Shah before, as a result they had little confidence and low morale for the circumstances he was facing. Zaman Shah, seeing this had capitalized on this by creating doubts and fights in Mahmud Shah&#x27;s camp. With this, Zaman Shah had broken Mahmud Shah&#x27;s morale and his allies belief to fight, as a result, Mahmud Shah had then fled to Khiva, and then the court of Fath-Ali Shah Qajar, where he led a petition to depose his brother, Zaman Shah. Mahmud Shah had attempted to seek help from Persia to invade the Durrani Empire to topple Zaman Shah&#x27;s regime, however, nobody sought to help him. As a result, Mahmud Shah, retired to the mountains of Persia.

=== Conspiracy and deposition of Zaman Shah ===
With Zaman Shah at his zenith of power, he ushered through an era of prosperity not seen for a while within the Durrani Empire, however all was not good, with the Barakzais chiefs then planning for the topple of Zaman Shah, they had laid the constituent articles that Zaman Shah should be overthrown and replaced by his brother, Sujah Mirza, the Durrani crown should be elective, with the chiefs voting in for these. And that the kings who have been proven unworthy can be deposed by the chiefs.

Despite setting their main framework of ideals and plans, Zaman Shah&#x27;s prime minister, Wafadar Khan, had found out about this, and invited the Barakzai chiefs separately to the palace, where he had executed them. One of his victims was Payandah Khan, one of the same chiefs that helped Zaman Shah to the Durrani throne. However it did not stop there, with Wafadar Khan then ordering the complete capture of all Mohammadzai and Barakzai chiefs. Prominent of this was Fathi Khan, the son of Payandah Khan. Fathi Khan had fled to Khorasan Province, where he met Mahmud Shah Durrani. Mahmud Shah had given up on his attempts of capturing the Durrani throne, however, after hearing news of what happened, Mahmud Shah had agreed, where they had marched to Farah with 18 supporters. Mahmud Shah had led fiery speeches and rallies against Zaman Shah, talking about his oppressive government and the tyrannies of Zaman Shah and Wafadar Khan. He had announced his intention to become the Durrani king and march on Kabul with their support. With this, the Barakzais had risen and flocked to his support, with many of the Durrani doing the same, with his support now large, Mahmud Shah had marched on Kandahar.

Mahmud Shah had begun sieging the city, for 42 days the city garrison held fierce, however, on the 43rd day, Fathi Khan had managed to gain the support of two tribal chiefs in Kandahar. With insurrection now fighting in the city and Mahmud Shah closing in, Kandahar fell to Mahmud Shah&#x27;s forces. Zaman Shah, unaware of the events at Kandahar, had been focused on the King of Persia&#x27;s movements, or what the Barakzais might do next in Kabul had then faced the reality of the situation. Instead of sending a force against his rebel brother, he left most of his forces with Shah Shujah Durrani at Peshawar. Zaman Shah, sensing his weakened position in Kabul had retreated in form to Jalalabad and had attempted to raise a large army, he failed to do this and only rallied around 400 artillerymen, and 200 cavalrymen. He marched to a fort not far from the Lataband Pass, where he appealed to the Afghans and tried to rally more support. Zaman Shah had succeeded in doing so, with many partisan fighters also flocking to his support such as Ahmad Khan. With this, his force numbered around 30,000. With Zaman Shah now ready, he marched ahead to meet Mahmud Shah once again in battle. The two armies met near Zabul. Ahmad Khan, leading the advance of Zaman Shah&#x27;s army had flocked and deserted to Mahmud Shah&#x27;s army. Zaman Shah, recognizing his situation had fled to a fort near again the Lataband Pass. Zaman Shah had also heard the news that Mahmud Shah had then captured Kabul. Mahmud Shah Durrani had led efforts to imprison Zaman Shah, with Zaman Shah leading a messenger to Mahmud Shah. The next day, Zaman Shah found out that he would be prisoner to Mahmud Shah, after conflicting with himself, he resigned to his fate, hiding his jewels including the Koh-i-Noor diamond, he was then led by a guard to Kabul. He had then met Asad Khan, a surgeon, where he was ordered to blind Zaman Shah from orders of Mahmud Shah. With Zaman Shah being defeated, Mahmud Durrani had now started his first reign on the Durrani throne.

Zaman Shah escaped out of Kabul and took refuge at Rawalpindi where he was met by Ranjit Singh who gave him a house to stay in but later due to his safety concerns, Ranjit Singh welcomed him to stay in Lahore, with a monthly allowance of 1,500 rupees. Later, from Lahore, Zaman Shah moved to Ludhiana where he lived for the rest of his life.

==Death and legacy==
Zaman Shah died at Ludhiana on 13 September 1845. He is buried at the Ahmad al-Fārūqī al-Sirhindī Mazar in Sirhind, Punjab (India).

Zaman Shah was seen by many Afghans as a kind and strong leader, however, after Wafadar Khan had begun murdering prominent tribal leaders, especially from the Barakzais, Zaman Shah and his regime were seen as cruel. Zaman Shah had attempted to repeat his Grandfathers success in India, advancing as far as Lahore, however having to give up the campaign due to many issues complicating things, usually being Zaman&#x27;s brother, Mahmud Shah in open revolt, or the Persians threatening Durrani northern territories in Khorasan Province. Despite all these, under Zaman Shah, the Durrani Empire had faced a prosperous state once again, having not been seen since the times of Zaman Shah&#x27;s grandfather, Ahmad Shah Abdali. From all of Zaman Shah&#x27;s efforts, he fell as he rose, having attempted to consolidate power through brutal methods, usually by killing tribal chiefs who opposed him, including stripping people of their ranks, and thwarting their influence.

<doc id="667678" wikidata="Q2267081" url="?curid=667678" title="Side-channel attack">
<text>In computer security, a side-channel attack is any attack based on extra information that can be gathered because of the fundamental way a computer protocol or algorithm is implemented, rather than flaws in the design of the protocol or algorithm itself (e.g. flaws found in a cryptanalysis of a cryptographic algorithm) or minor, but potentially devastating, mistakes or oversights in the implementation. (Cryptanalysis also includes searching for side-channel attacks.) Timing information, power consumption, electromagnetic leaks, and sound are examples of extra information which could be exploited to facilitate side-channel attacks.

Some side-channel attacks require technical knowledge of the internal operation of the system, although others such as differential power analysis are effective as black-box attacks. The rise of Web 2.0 applications and software-as-a-service has also significantly raised the possibility of side-channel attacks on the web, even when transmissions between a web browser and server are encrypted (e.g. through HTTPS or WiFi encryption), according to researchers from Microsoft Research and Indiana University. 

Attempts to break a cryptosystem by deceiving or coercing people with legitimate access are not typically considered side-channel attacks: see social engineering and rubber-hose cryptanalysis.
General classes of side-channel attack include:

* Cache attack — attacks based on attacker&#x27;s ability to monitor cache accesses made by the victim in a shared physical system as in virtualized environment or a type of cloud service.
* Timing attack — attacks based on measuring how much time various computations (such as, say, comparing an attacker&#x27;s given password with the victim&#x27;s unknown one) take to perform.
* Power-monitoring attack — attacks that make use of varying power consumption by the hardware during computation.
* Electromagnetic attack — attacks based on leaked electromagnetic radiation, which can directly provide plaintexts and other information. Such measurements can be used to infer cryptographic keys using techniques equivalent to those in power analysis or can be used in non-cryptographic attacks, e.g. TEMPEST (aka van Eck phreaking or radiation monitoring) attacks.
* Acoustic cryptanalysis — attacks that exploit sound produced during a computation (rather like power analysis).
* Differential fault analysis — in which secrets are discovered by introducing faults in a computation.
* Data remanence — in which sensitive data are read after supposedly having been deleted. (e.g. Cold boot attack)
* Software-initiated fault attacks — Currently a rare class of side channels, Row hammer is an example in which off-limits memory can be changed by accessing adjacent memory too often (causing state retention loss).
* Whitelist — attacks based on the fact that the whitelisting devices will behave differently when communicating with whitelisted (sending back the responses) and non-whitelisted (not responding to the devices at all) devices. Whitelist-based side channel may be used to track Bluetooth MAC addresses.
* Optical - in which secrets and sensitive data can be read by visual recording using a high resolution camera, or other devices that have such capabilities (see examples below).

In all cases, the underlying principle is that physical effects caused by the operation of a cryptosystem (&quot;on the side&quot;) can provide useful extra information about secrets in the system, for example, the cryptographic key, partial state information, full or partial plaintexts and so forth. The term cryptophthora (secret degradation) is sometimes used to express the degradation of secret key material resulting from side-channel leakage.

==Examples==
A works by monitoring security critical operations such as AES T-table entry or modular exponentiation or multiplication or memory accesses. The attacker then is able to recover the secret key depending on the accesses made (or not made) by the victim, deducing the encryption key. Also, unlike some of the other side-channel attacks, this method does not create a fault in the ongoing cryptographic operation and is invisible to the victim.

In 2017, two CPU vulnerabilities (dubbed Meltdown and Spectre) were discovered, which can use a cache-based side channel to allow an attacker to leak memory contents of other processes and the operating system itself.

A timing attack watches data movement into and out of the CPU or memory on the hardware running the cryptosystem or algorithm. Simply by observing variations in how long it takes to perform cryptographic operations, it might be possible to determine the entire secret key. Such attacks involve statistical analysis of timing measurements and have been demonstrated across networks.

A power-analysis attack can provide even more detailed information by observing the power consumption of a hardware device such as CPU or cryptographic circuit. These attacks are roughly categorized into simple power analysis (SPA) and differential power analysis (DPA). One example is Collide+Power, which affects nearly all CPUs. Other examples use machine learning approaches.

Fluctuations in current also generate radio waves, enabling attacks that analyze measurements of electromagnetic (EM) emanations. These attacks typically involve similar statistical techniques as power-analysis attacks.

A deep-learning-based side-channel attack, using the power and EM information across multiple devices has been demonstrated with the potential to break the secret key of a different but identical device in as low as a single trace.

Historical analogues to modern side-channel attacks are known. A recently declassified NSA document reveals that as far back as 1943, an engineer with Bell telephone observed decipherable spikes on an oscilloscope associated with the decrypted output of a certain encrypting teletype. According to former MI5 officer Peter Wright, the British Security Service analyzed emissions from French cipher equipment in the 1960s. In the 1980s, Soviet eavesdroppers were suspected of having planted bugs inside IBM Selectric typewriters to monitor the electrical noise generated as the type ball rotated and pitched to strike the paper; the characteristics of those signals could determine which key was pressed.

Power consumption of devices causes heating, which is offset by cooling effects. Temperature changes create thermally induced mechanical stress. This stress can create low level acoustic emissions from operating CPUs (about 10 kHz in some cases). Recent research by Shamir et al. has suggested that information about the operation of cryptosystems and algorithms can be obtained in this way as well. This is an acoustic cryptanalysis attack.

If the surface of the CPU chip, or in some cases the CPU package, can be observed, infrared images can also provide information about the code being executed on the CPU, known as a thermal-imaging attack.

An optical side-channel attack examples include gleaning information from the hard disk activity indicator to reading a small number of photons emitted by transistors as they change state.

Allocation-based side channels also exist and refer to the information that leaks from the allocation (as opposed to the use) of a resource such as network bandwidth to clients that are concurrently requesting the contended resource.

==Countermeasures==
Because side-channel attacks rely on the relationship between information emitted (leaked) through a side channel and the secret data, countermeasures fall into two main categories: (1) eliminate or reduce the release of such information and (2) eliminate the relationship between the leaked information and the secret data, that is, make the leaked information unrelated, or rather &quot;uncorrelated&quot;, to the secret data, typically through some form of randomization of the ciphertext that transforms the data in a way that can be undone after the cryptographic operation (e.g., decryption) is completed.

Under the first category, displays with special shielding to lessen electromagnetic emissions, reducing susceptibility to TEMPEST attacks, are now commercially available. Power line conditioning and filtering can help deter power-monitoring attacks, although such measures must be used cautiously, since even very small correlations can remain and compromise security. Physical enclosures can reduce the risk of surreptitious installation of microphones (to counter acoustic attacks) and other micro-monitoring devices (against CPU power-draw or thermal-imaging attacks).

Another countermeasure (still in the first category) is to jam the emitted channel with noise. For instance, a random delay can be added to deter timing attacks, although adversaries can compensate for these delays by averaging multiple measurements (or, more generally, using more measurements in the analysis). When the amount of noise in the side channel increases, the adversary needs to collect more measurements.

Another countermeasure under the first category is to use security analysis software to identify certain classes of side-channel attacks that can be found during the design stages of the underlying hardware itself. Timing attacks and cache attacks are both identifiable through certain commercially available security analysis software platforms, which allow for testing to identify the attack vulnerability itself, as well as the effectiveness of the architectural change to circumvent the vulnerability. The most comprehensive method to employ this countermeasure is to create a Secure Development Lifecycle for hardware, which includes utilizing all available security analysis platforms at their respective stages of the hardware development lifecycle.

In the case of timing attacks against targets whose computation times are quantized into discrete clock cycle counts, an effective countermeasure against is to design the software to be isochronous, that is to run in an exactly constant amount of time, independently of secret values. This makes timing attacks impossible. Such countermeasures can be difficult to implement in practice, since even individual instructions can have variable timing on some CPUs.

One partial countermeasure against simple power attacks, but not differential power-analysis attacks, is to design the software so that it is &quot;PC-secure&quot; in the &quot;program counter security model&quot;. In a PC-secure program, the execution path does not depend on secret values. In other words, all conditional branches depend only on public information. (This is a more restrictive condition than isochronous code, but a less restrictive condition than branch-free code.) Even though multiply operations draw more power than NOP on practically all CPUs, using a constant execution path prevents such operation-dependent power differences (differences in power from choosing one branch over another) from leaking any secret information. On architectures where the instruction execution time is not data-dependent, a PC-secure program is also immune to timing attacks.

Another way in which code can be non-isochronous is that modern CPUs have a memory cache: accessing infrequently used information incurs a large timing penalty, revealing some information about the frequency of use of memory blocks. Cryptographic code designed to resist cache attacks attempts to use memory in only a predictable fashion (like accessing only the input, outputs and program data, and doing so according to a fixed pattern). For example, data-dependent table lookups must be avoided because the cache could reveal which part of the lookup table was accessed.

Other partial countermeasures attempt to reduce the amount of information leaked from data-dependent power differences. Some operations use power that is correlated to the number of 1 bits in a secret value. Using a constant-weight code (such as using Fredkin gates or dual-rail encoding) can reduce the leakage of information about the Hamming weight of the secret value, although exploitable correlations are likely to remain unless the balancing is perfect. This &quot;balanced design&quot; can be approximated in software by manipulating both the data and its complement together.

Several &quot;secure CPUs&quot; have been built as asynchronous CPUs; they have no global timing reference. While these CPUs were intended to make timing and power attacks more difficult, subsequent research found that timing variations in asynchronous circuits are harder to remove.

A typical example of the second category (decorrelation) is a technique known as &quot;blinding&quot;. In the case of RSA decryption with secret exponent formula_1 and corresponding encryption exponent formula_2 and modulus formula_3, the technique applies as follows (for simplicity, the modular reduction by &quot;m&quot; is omitted in the formulas): before decrypting, that is, before computing the result of formula_4 for a given ciphertext formula_5, the system picks a random number formula_6 and encrypts it with public exponent formula_2 to obtain formula_8. Then, the decryption is done on formula_9 to 
obtain formula_10. Since the decrypting system chose formula_6, it can compute its inverse modulo formula_3 to cancel out the factor formula_6 in the result and obtain formula_4, the actual result of the decryption. For attacks that require collecting side-channel information from operations with data &quot;controlled by the attacker&quot;, blinding is an effective countermeasure, since the actual operation is executed on a randomized version of the data, over which the attacker has no control or even knowledge.

A more general countermeasure (in that it is effective against all side-channel attacks) is the masking countermeasure. The principle of masking is to avoid manipulating any sensitive value formula_5 directly, but rather manipulate a sharing of it: a set of variables (called &quot;shares&quot;) formula_16 such that formula_17 (where formula_18 is the XOR operation). An attacker must recover all the values of the shares to get any meaningful information.

Recently, white-box modeling was utilized to develop a low-overhead generic circuit-level countermeasure against both EM as well as power side-channel attacks. To minimize the effects of the higher-level metal layers in an IC acting as more efficient antennas, the idea is to embed the crypto core with a signature suppression circuit, routed locally within the lower-level metal layers, leading towards both power and EM side-channel attack immunity.

<text>Lee John Westwood (born 24 April 1973) is an English professional golfer. Noted for his consistency, he is one of the few golfers who has won tournaments on five continents – Europe, North America, Asia, Africa and Oceania – including victories on the European Tour and the PGA Tour. He has also won tournaments in four decades, the 1990s, 2000s, 2010s and 2020s. He was named European Tour Golfer of the Year for the 1998, 2000, 2009 and 2020 seasons. He has won the 2000 European Tour Order of Merit, and the renamed 2009 and 2020 Race to Dubai. He has frequently been mentioned as one of the best golfers without a major championship victory, with several near misses including three runner-up finishes.

Westwood has represented Europe in ten Ryder Cups. In October 2010, he became the world number one in the Official World Golf Ranking, ending the reign of Tiger Woods, and becoming the first British golfer since Nick Faldo in 1994 to hold that position. He held the number one position for a total of 22 weeks. Westwood and fellow countryman Luke Donald share the distinction of reaching the number one world ranking despite never winning a major. He holds the record of playing in the most major championships without winning one. He is sometimes referred to by his nickname Westy.

==Early life==
Born in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, Westwood attended Sir Edmund Hillary Primary School and Valley Comprehensive School (now an Outwood Grange Academies Trust school) in his youth. He has family and heritage in South Wales. Westwood began to play golf aged 13 with a half set bought by grandparents. His father John, a mathematics teacher, took up the game at the same time to encourage his son. A talented sportsman at school, Lee played rugby, cricket and football.

Westwood had a later start at the game than many future tournament professionals, but less than two years later he was the junior champion of Nottinghamshire. He played for England in the Boys Home Internationals in August 1989, and played for Great Britain and Ireland boys team in the Jacques Léglise Trophy in both 1990 and 1991. In 1991 he won his first important amateur tournament, the Peter McEvoy Trophy. In 1993 he won the British Youths Open Amateur Championship and turned professional.

==Professional career==
In 1996, Westwood won his first professional tournament, the Volvo Scandinavian Masters, closely followed by the Sumitomo Visa Taiheiyo Masters in Japan. His success continued in 1997, defending his Japanese title and winning the Malaysian Open, the Volvo Masters in Spain, and the Holden Australian Open, beating Greg Norman in a playoff. He also partnered with Nick Faldo in the Ryder Cup that year.

Westwood has won 25 events on the European Tour and has also won tournaments in North America, Africa, Asia and Australia. His most successful year to date has been 2000 when he won seven tournaments worldwide and was ranked first on the European Order of Merit, ending Colin Montgomerie&#x27;s long run of European Tour dominance. His win on the Sunshine Tour&#x27;s Dimension Data Pro-am in 2000 made him the first golfer to win events on all 6 of the International Federation of PGA Tours. Ernie Els (2005) and Justin Rose (2017) are the only golfers to have joined him on this list. Westwood took a significant break from the game following the birth of son Samuel Bevan in 2001, and together with a restructuring of his swing under David Leadbetter, led to him being out of contention in tournaments until his 2003 victory in Germany, his 25th worldwide.

Westwood returned to the winners circle in 2007 by winning both the Valle Romano Open de Andalucía and the Quinn Direct British Masters to bring his total European Tour wins to 18. As a result, he moved back into the top 50 of the Official World Golf Ranking. Westwood finished the 2007 season with five top 10 finishes in the last five events. He carried this form into the 2008 season, starting with two tied second places and a fifth, moving back into the top 20 in the world rankings. At the Masters, Westwood finished tied for 11th and he narrowly missed out on becoming the first European in 38 years to win the U.S. Open, finishing 3rd on level-par.

In 2009, Westwood had two further 3rd-place finishes at major championships, in the Open and the PGA Championship. In October 2009, Westwood ended his two-year wait for a tournament win by winning the Portugal Masters. This was followed the next month with a win at the Dubai World Championship, which also brought with it the inaugural Race to Dubai title.

Westwood has played in the Gary Player Invitational charity event several times to assist Player raise money for children in need around the world. Westwood earned a career-best second place at the 2010 Masters Tournament, leading by one shot going into the final day before being overtaken by eventual champion Phil Mickelson. Westwood came through with his 2nd tour victory at the St. Jude Classic the week before the U.S. Open. Westwood claimed another second-place finish at the 2010 Open Championship, although he was a distant runner-up to Louis Oosthuizen. Despite the two 2nd-place finishes at the season&#x27;s first three majors, Westwood did not compete in the PGA Championship due to injury.

In May 2011, Westwood contested a playoff at the BMW PGA Championship with fellow Englishman and at the time world number two Luke Donald. On the par five 18th, Donald hit his approach shot into the green leaving six feet for birdie. Westwood attempted to follow him in close to the hole but got too much backspin on his pitch and the ball spun back into the water hazard. Westwood eventually chipped up from the drop zone and went on to make double bogey. Donald then holed his birdie putt to win the championship and in the process became the new world number one.

In June 2011, Westwood equalled his best performance at the U.S. Open finishing in a tie for third place at Congressional CC, an event which was dominated by Rory McIlroy. This was the fourth time in his career that Westwood had finished third in a major. In December 2011, Westwood shot the lowest round of his career, a 60, at the Thailand Golf Championship. He followed that up with a 64 to equal the lowest 36-hole total on the Asian Tour and won the tournament by seven shots.

Westwood rejoined the PGA Tour for the 2012 season, stating that &quot;It felt right in a Ryder Cup year&quot; and intimated that he would like to experience the challenge for the FedEx Cup in the end of season playoffs for the first time. In February 2012, Westwood recorded his best ever performance at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship when he reached the semi-finals for the first time. In all eleven previous attempts he had never once made it past the second round. He beat Nicolas Colsaerts, Robert Karlsson, Nick Watney and Martin Laird en route before falling, 3&amp;1, to Rory McIlroy in the semi-finals. He finished in 4th place after losing the consolation match to American Mark Wilson, 1 up. Had he won the tournament, he would have regained the number one ranking.

Westwood continued his fine run of performances in the major championships with a tied third finish at the Masters in April 2012. He finished two strokes behind Bubba Watson and Louis Oosthuizen and bemoaned his putting performance as the reason he did not win the tournament. This was the seventh occasion that he had recorded a top three finish at a major without actually winning one. In April 2012, he successfully defended his title at the Indonesian Masters on the Asian Tour, winning by two strokes. In June 2012, Westwood won the Nordea Masters for the third time, the week prior to the U.S Open, with a five stroke victory over Ross Fisher. This was Westwood&#x27;s 22nd victory on the European Tour and moved him into ninth place alone on the all time European Tour winners list.

At the 2012 U.S. Open, Westwood was in contention again after firing a three-under-par round of 67 in the third round to position himself three strokes behind the leaders. During the final round, Westwood lost his ball in a tree on the par-four fifth hole after his drive clattered into the pines. The ball was declared lost and he had to play his third shot from the tee, resulting in a double-bogey six which effectively ended his challenge. He finished in a tie for 10th.

In the 2013 Open Championship, Westwood led after 54 holes by two strokes over Hunter Mahan and Tiger Woods. They were the only three players in the field under par for the tournament. Westwood shot a four-over-par 75 in his final round to finish in a tie for third, four strokes back at one-over-par. Phil Mickelson went on to win the tournament with a total of three-under-par, the only player to complete the tournament under par. This was the second time Westwood had taken the lead into the final round of a major championship, with the other being in the 2010 Masters, which Mickelson also won. Westwood has now finished in the top-three eight times in majors without ever winning one.

In April 2015, Westwood won the CIMB Niaga Indonesian Masters for the third time in his career. He won in a sudden-death playoff over Chapchai Nirat, having held a five-stroke lead at the 54-hole stage. This was Westwood&#x27;s ninth victory in Asian Tour events.

At the 2016 Masters, Westwood finished joint runner-up with Jordan Spieth, three strokes behind winner Danny Willett. He was briefly only one stroke off the lead during the final round following an eagle on the par five 15th, but bogeyed the 16th to end his chances. This was the third time Westwood has finished as runner-up in a major championship. At the 2016 U.S. Open, Westwood was again near the top of the leaderboard after the first three rounds, but playing in the penultimate group during the final round he fell away badly shooting a round 80 (+10) to finish T32.

Westwood holds the record for most major championship appearances without winning, surpassing Jay Haas at the 2021 Open Championship, his 88th major.

In an interview with CNN in November 2017, Westwood spoke of his desire to go into the golf course design industry once he had finished playing, saying he would vow to make courses &quot;more playable and enjoyable&quot;.

On 11 November 2018, Westwood fired an eight-under 64 to storm to a three-shot victory in the Nedbank Golf Challenge. Westwood&#x27;s win in Sun City, South Africa claimed his 24th European Tour victory and his first since the 2014 Malaysian Open. The victory was worth $1,250,000. The Nedbank was his first Rolex Series title and third victory at Gary Player Country Club following wins in 2010 and 2011 before the tournament joined the European Tour international schedule. He also won the Dimension Data Pro-Am in 2000 also played at the Gary Player Country Club.

In July 2019, Westwood finished tied for fourth in the 2019 Open Championship at Royal Portrush Golf Club in Northern Ireland. He has now finished 12 times in the top five of a major without actually winning. This was his best finish at the Open since 2013 and it earned him entry into the 2020 Masters Tournament. &quot;It&#x27;s brilliant,&quot; said Westwood. &quot;Augusta is a very special place. I&#x27;ve played great there in the past and had a chance to win it. It is another course like Royal Portrush Golf Club that I don&#x27;t strictly think is a bomber&#x27;s paradise, although I think it helps. If you&#x27;ve played it a lot and you play it well, there are a lot of repeat winners. It will be lovely to go back.&quot;

In January 2020, Westwood won the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship on the European Tour. This tournament was part of the Rolex Series. This win meant he had won titles in four different decades on the European Tour. Westwood finished on 19 under par, two shots ahead of Tommy Fleetwood, Matt Fitzpatrick and Victor Perez. The 46-year-old shot a five-under-par 67 at the Abu Dhabi Golf Club to win the event for the first time. In December of that year, Westwood claimed his third Race to Dubai by finishing solo second in the season-ending DP World Tour Championship, Dubai. At 47 years of age, he became the oldest winner of the title.

In March 2021, Westwood held the 54-hole lead at the Arnold Palmer Invitational. He eventually missed out by one shot to Bryson DeChambeau. This was his best result on the PGA Tour since his tied for second place at the 2016 Masters. The following week, Westwood again held the 54-hole lead at a PGA Tour event; The Players Championship. He shot an even-par 72 and finished second by one shot to eventual champion Justin Thomas. He won more than $1.6 million for this finish, the largest official cheque of his career to date.

In June 2022, Westwood was suspended from the PGA Tour for playing in a LIV Golf event. In May 2023, the European Tour announced that he had resigned his membership of the tour.

In April 2023, Westwood turned 50 and became age eligible for senior golf. He applied for entry to the 2023 Senior Open Championship, to be played in late July and for which he had fulfilled several exemption categories. However, in June he was denied entry due to outstanding fines to the European Tour, related to breaching conflicting tournament regulations.

==World ranking==
Westwood first reached the top 10 in the Official World Golf Ranking in July 1998 and spent a total of 160 weeks in the top 10 between then and August 2001.

Westwood dropped out of top 100 in mid-2002. Returning to the top 100 in late 2003, Westwood&#x27;s ranking remained in the 20 to 80 range from 2004 and 2007. Early in 2008 he returned to the top 20 where he has remained since. He returned to the top 10 briefly at the end of the 2008 season and again after the 2009 PGA Championship.

On 31 October 2010, Westwood became the World number one golfer, ending the reign of Tiger Woods. He remained World number one for 17 weeks, before being replaced by Martin Kaymer who held the top spot for 8 weeks. Westwood regained the number one spot after winning the Indonesian Masters on 24 April 2011 and held it for 5 weeks before being replaced by Luke Donald. He spent over 350 weeks in the top-10.

==Ryder Cup==
Westwood made his Ryder Cup debut in 1997 where he partnered fellow Englishman Nick Faldo in both sets of fourballs and foursomes. In the 1999 Ryder Cup, he partnered Darren Clarke for the fourballs and foursomes, picking up 2 points. At The Belfry in 2002 he teamed up with Sergio García in a successful partnership in which they won 3 and lost 1 of their four matches.

In the 2004 Ryder Cup, Westwood sank the putt which took Europe&#x27;s points tally to 14 and thereby ensured that they retained the Cup. Europe eventually won 18½–9½. It was his first victory in singles. He and Darren Clarke were the wildcard selections in 2006 and Westwood justified his selection by not losing a game, a feat he had also achieved in 2004. He is the eighth most successful European golfer on points scored, with the second highest scoring rate.

During the 2008 Matches, Westwood sat out for the first session in his Ryder Cup career during the matches after a controversial decision by captain Nick Faldo. The European Team ended up losing to the U.S. 16½–11½. In October 2010, Westwood was a member of the European team that won the 2010 Ryder Cup with a one-point win over the USA.

For the 2012 and 2014 tournaments, Westwood was once again a member of winning teams, with Europe beating USA at Medinah Country Club and Gleneagles. In 2016, his friend Darren Clarke was captain and he was once again chosen as a wildcard, this time part of a losing team for the first time since 2008.

In 2018, Thomas Bjørn selected Westwood as one of his five vice-captains for the 2018 Ryder Cup at Le Golf National, alongside Graeme McDowell, Luke Donald, Pádraig Harrington and Robert Karlsson.

In September 2021, Westwood played on the European team in the 2021 Ryder Cup at Whistling Straits in Kohler, Wisconsin. The U.S. team won 19–9 and Westwood went 1–2–0 including a win in his Sunday singles match against Harris English.

He is the European player who has the greatest number of appearances in Ryder Cup winning teams (7 wins, 4 losses).

*Singles: played 11, won 4, lost 7, halved 0
*Foursomes: played 20, won 9, lost 7, halved 4
*Fourballs: played 16, won 8, lost 6, halved 2

==Personal life==
Westwood married Laurae Coltart, the sister of Scottish Ryder Cup player Andrew Coltart, in January 1999. The couple have two children, Samuel Bevan and Poppy Grace. The two divorced in 2017. After his divorce, Westwood moved back to Europe from his residence in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. Westwood now lives in Jesmond, Newcastle upon Tyne with his wife, Helen Storey, who also caddies for him on tour. The pair married in Las Vegas in June 2021.

He is good friends with fellow Ryder Cup star Darren Clarke and from April 2006 he co-owned a private jet with him. 

In 2007, Westwood was presented with an Honorary degree of Doctor of Science by Nottingham Trent University. The University named its sports hall after the golfer in October 2010. He announced the creation of the Lee Westwood Golf School in 2010, which offers young golfers the ability to combine golf training with their education as part of their school life. In addition, since 2010 Westwood has created a Junior Lee Westwood Golf Tour and Lee Westwood Golf Camps. In recognition of his work with young golfers, he was awarded with the Golf Foundation&#x27;s &#x27;Spirit of Golf&#x27; Award just before the Open Championship, an award which was previously held by Gary Player and Tony Jacklin.

Westwood&#x27;s major passion is horse racing, in which he has had an interest in several successful horses, including Hoof It which won the Stewards Cup twice. Other interests include films, snooker and cars. He is a keen football fan who supports Nottingham Forest. He also supports and sponsors his local semi professional side Worksop Town FC. Westwood is a follower of Dumfries based football club Queen of the South, most likely due to having Andrew Coltart as a former brother-in-law, who himself is a passionate supporter of the Scottish club.

Westwood was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2011 Birthday Honours.

<text>Palos de la Frontera () is a town and municipality located in the southwestern Spanish province of Huelva, in the autonomous community of Andalusia. It is situated some from the provincial capital, Huelva. According to the 2015 census, the city had a population of 10,365. It is most famous for being the place from which Columbus set sail in 1492, eventually reaching the Americas.

==History==
The official date of foundation for Palos is 1322, when the town was granted to Alonso Carro and Carro&#x27;s wife Berenguela Gómez by Alfonso XI of Castile, although the town may have been occupied during earlier centuries by Paleolithic, Tartessian, Roman, Visigothic, and Muslim inhabitants. Palos&#x27;s name is derived from the Latin word &quot;palus&quot; (“lagoon”). It acquired its “surname” as &quot;Palos de la Frontera&quot; in May 1642.

At the time of its establishment as a town by Alfonso XI, Palos was part of the Almohad kingdom of Niebla, and was a small nucleus whose population subsisted on fishing and took advantage of the area&#x27;s geographic protection against pirates and storms.

Álvar Pérez is considered the city&#x27;s real founder. He was only fourteen when Juan I of Castile granted him the towns of Palos and Villalba del Alcor in 1379 to make up for the fact that Pérez de Guzmán was forced to give up Huelva and Gibraleón, which had become part of the county of Medinaceli. Álvar Pérez de Guzmán received from Juan I the right to tax the first fifty families who settled at Palos, and he began utilizing the lands around Palos for the cultivation of olive trees and production of olive oil. After the death of Álvar Pérez de Guzmán, his widow, Elvira de Ayala, daughter of the Chancellor of Castile, continued her husband&#x27;s work until her death in 1434.

Palos&#x27;s Golden Age is considered to have occurred in the 15th century (especially between 1470 and 1479), when it increased its population to 2,500 inhabitants and its economy, based on fishing and seafaring expeditions to Guinea, flourished.
Palos took advantage of the War of the Castilian Succession, which became a war between Castile and Portugal, to challenge Portuguese domination of the Atlantic trade. Castilian naval forces always included natives of Palos, who were considered navigational experts:

Nevertheless, the war ended in defeat for the Castilian forces, and Ferdinand and Isabella, in the Treaty of Alcáçovas (1479) gave up all rights to Atlantic and African lands and seas, with the exception of the Canary Islands, which remained Castilian. Many natives of Palos nevertheless violated the agreement and encroached upon Portuguese sea routes in the Atlantic.

On August 3, 1492, the Pinta, Niña, and Santa María sailed from Palos. On board were the Spanish crew of Christopher Columbus and the Pinzón Brothers, who were natives of Palos. Palos is also the site of the Rábida Monastery where Columbus consulted with the Franciscans about his plans for organizing an expedition of discovery. The three Spanish ships landed in America on October 12, 1492. The Santa María foundered in American waters, but the other two ships returned to Palos on March 15, 1493.

Palos would play a pivotal role in the settlement and Christianization of the New World in succeeding centuries. La Rábida would play a central part in the Christian evangelization of the Americas. As La Rábida was a Franciscan monastery, that order would play a dominant role in this Christianization, and some of the first missionaries were natives of Palos, including Juan Izquierdo, Juan de Palos, Juan Cerrado, Pedro Salvador, Alonso Vélez de Guevara, , Thomás de Narváez, and Francisco Camacho.

With the establishment of the Casa de Contratación at Seville in 1503, Palos suffered a decline. Natives of Palos emigrated to America or to Seville, and Palos soon had few sailing vessels of its own. By the 18th century, the town had only about 125 inhabitants. However, during the same century, Catalan investors established a viticultural industry centered at Palos, and the population slowly reached its pre-1492 levels. Palos also transformed itself into a center of the shrimp industries, and also became a center for the cultivation of the “fresón de Palos” (Palos-grown garden strawberries), which are now exported to the European Union.

On June 22, 1926, the first hydroplane to cross the Atlantic, the Plus Ultra flying boat, took off from Palos. The journey, done in six stages, ended at Buenos Aires, Argentina. Alfonso XIII of Spain gave the Plus Ultra to the Argentine Navy, in which it served as a postal service airplane; the Argentines donated to Spain a statue of Icarus, which is situated at La Rábida. Alfonso XIII also granted to Palos the status as a city during this time.

John Paul II visited Palos on June 14, 1993, the only time a pope has visited the city. John Paul symbolically crowned the Palos&#x27;s patron saint, the Virgin of Miracles (&quot;Virgen de los Milagros&quot;).

There is a station in the Madrid Metro named after this town.

In 1850 the small town of Trenton, Illinois, located southwest of Chicago, changed its name to Palos. This recommendation was made by M. S. Powell, the local postmaster, whose ancestor Pedro Alonso Niño sailed with Christopher Columbus from Palos de la Frontera. When it incorporated as a Village in 1914, Palos officially became Palos Park. The neighboring communities of Palos Hills and Palos Heights incorporated at later points. All three municipalities lie within Palos Township.

<text>Edward Joseph Derwinski (September 15, 1926 – January 15, 2012) was an American politician who served as the first Cabinet-level United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs, serving under President George H. W. Bush from March 15, 1989 to September 26, 1992. He previously served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1959 to 1983, representing south and southwest suburbs of Chicago.

==Early life==
He was born in Chicago, Illinois, on September 15, 1926, to Sophia Zmijewski and Casimir Ignatius Derwinski, who died in 1947. He attended Loyola University of Chicago. Derwinski served in the United States Army in the Pacific Theater during World War II and in the postwar U.S. occupation of Japan. He graduated from Loyola University Chicago in 1951. He was a celebrated member of Alpha Delta Gamma National Fraternity.

==Legislative career==
In 1957, he was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives, where he served one term before winning election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1958. He served 12 terms as a Republican representative from the 4th District of Illinois, a suburban region south and west of Chicago, eventually becoming ranking member of the House Foreign Relations Committee. He also served as a delegate to the United Nations General Assembly 1971–1972 and as chairman of the U.S. delegation to the Interparliamentary Union from 1970–1972 and 1978-1980.

==Executive career==
A Democratic redistricting plan after the 1980 Census carved up the 4th District, with only about 15% of its territory being retained and added to various territory from other districts; Derwinski and fellow Republican congressman George M. O&#x27;Brien were placed in the same district, and O&#x27;Brien won the 1982 primary on the strength of having more of his previous district included in the new configuration. After Derwinski&#x27;s loss, President Ronald Reagan appointed him Counselor to the State Department. In 1987, Reagan appointed him Under Secretary of State for Security Assistance, Science and Technology, where he served until the end of Reagan&#x27;s term, shortly after which he was appointed Administrator of Veterans Affairs, in charge of the Veterans Administration, which was elevated to cabinet-level status as the Department of Veterans Affairs in 1989, making Derwinski the first Secretary of Veterans Affairs.

==Advocacy==
A Polish American, Derwinski was noted for his efforts on behalf of Eastern Europe throughout his career. Notably, he aided in the rehabilitation of the Serbian Royalist general Draža Mihailović. Mihailović had received the Legion of Merit for his resistance efforts against the Axis—but this information was marked &quot;secret&quot; at the behest of the State Department so as not to harm relations with Marshal Tito, the current ruler of Yugoslavia in 1967. Tito was Mihailović&#x27;s rival in World War II, and after Tito&#x27;s forces emerged triumphant, Mihailović was accused of collaboration with the Nazis and executed. At the urging of airmen involved in Operation Halyard who had been saved by Mihailović&#x27;s forces and had heard rumors of the award to him, Derwinski insisted that the State Department make the text of President Truman&#x27;s citation public, confirming that Mihailović had not collaborated. Derwinski served as head of &quot;Ethnic Americans for Dole/Kemp&quot; during the 1996 presidential election.

==Post-politics==
Derwinski resided in Glen Ellyn, Illinois with his wife, the former Bonita Hickey, known as Bonnie. He had two adult children, Maureen and Michael, from his first marriage to Patricia Derwinski.

Derwinski died in a nursing home from Merkel cell carcinoma, on January 15, 2012, at age 85. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia.

On learning of his death, former United States Senator Peter Fitzgerald (R-IL) described Derwinski as &quot;a giant in Illinois politics [...] [H]e had incredible connections in all the different ethnic neighborhoods in Chicago, he was really loved by everybody on both sides&quot;.

<text>Shamit Kachru (born 1970) is an American theoretical physicist, a professor emeritus of physics at Stanford University, and a former Wells Family Director of the Stanford Institute for Theoretical Physics. He served as the Stanford Physics Department Chair from 2018 to 2021. He retired in 2023.

==Career==
Kachru&#x27;s research has explored a broad range of topics in string theory and quantum field theory, and their applications in cosmology, condensed matter physics, and elementary particle theory. He has made central contributions to the study of compactifications of string theory from ten to four dimensions, especially in the investigation of mechanisms which could yield string models of dark energy or cosmic inflation. He has also made notable contributions to the discovery and exploration of string dualities, to the study of models of supersymmetry breaking in string theory, and to the construction of calculable dual descriptions of strongly coupled particle physics and condensed matter systems. More recently, his work has focused on connections between geometry, number theory, and string theory. His research has also moved into theoretical questions in evolutionary biology and ecology.

Kachru is a recipient of a Department of Energy Outstanding Junior Investigator Award, an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Fellowship, the Bergmann Memorial Award, a David and Lucile Packard Foundation Fellowship, and a Simons Investigator Award. He was elected as a Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2022.

In 1986, Kachru attended the prestigious Research Science Institute. He graduated from University High School in Urbana, Illinois and from Harvard University before obtaining a doctorate in physics from Princeton University under the supervision of Edward Witten. Kachru was a junior fellow in the Harvard Society of Fellows. In 2017 he received a Simons Investigator Award.

Kachru is best known for his extensive research on flux compactifications (including work with Steve Giddings and Joseph Polchinski), which can stabilize the extra dimensions of string theory. In collaboration with Renata Kallosh, Andrei Linde, and Sandip Trivedi, he found the first models of accelerated expansion of the universe in low energy supersymmetric string compactifications (see KKLT mechanism). He made notable contributions to string theory duality (with Cumrun Vafa), the AdS/CFT correspondence (with Eva Silverstein), and to the construction of models of cosmic inflation. He has also done significant work on the holographic description of finite density quantum matter, the theory of non-Fermi liquids, and the understanding of moonshine and its connections to physics and geometry.

As of September 2023, Kachru is working with PDT Partners, and according to his website his &quot;current scientific research is focused on understanding dynamics of various liquid global financial markets&quot;. 

He is the son of Braj Kachru and Yamuna Kachru, and is married to fellow Stanford professor Eva Silverstein.

<text>Eva Silverstein (born October 24, 1970) is an American theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and string theorist. She is a professor of physics at Stanford University and director of the Modern Inflationary Cosmology collaboration within the Simons Foundation Origins of the Universe initiative.

==Life, education, and work==
Raised in Spokane, Washington, Silverstein is the daughter of Harry S. and Lorinda Knight Silverstein and graduated from Lewis and Clark High School. Her father is a professor emeritus of philosophy at Washington State University in Pullman. Silverstein earned her bachelor&#x27;s degree in physics from Harvard University in 1992 and her doctoral degree from Princeton University four years later.

Silverstein&#x27;s primary research areas include cosmic inflation, namely the creation of predictive and testable new mechanisms which have enabled systematic understanding of the process and the role of ultraviolet-sensitive qualities in observational cosmology (including string-theoretic versions of large field inflation and novel mechanisms involving inflation interactions); implications of long-range interactions in string theory for black hole physics; and mechanism development for breaking super-symmetry and stabilizing the extra dimensions of string theory. In her work on early-universe cosmology, she makes extensive contributions to string theory and gravitational physics. Her early work included control of tachyon condensation in string theory and resulting resolution of some spacetime singularities (with Joseph Polchinski and others). Other significant research contributions include the construction of the first models of dark energy in string theory, some basic extensions of the AdS/CFT correspondence to more realistic field theories (with Shamit Kachru), as well as the discovery of a predictive new mechanism for cosmic inflation involving D-brane dynamics (with David Tong) which helped motivate more systematic analyses of primordial non-Gaussianity.

Silverstein is married to fellow string theorist Shamit Kachru; both were doctoral students of Edward Witten.

<doc id="667719" wikidata="Q1355060" url="?curid=667719" title="Miniclip">
<text>Miniclip is a Swiss mobile game publisher and former browser game website that was first launched on 30 March 2001. It was started by Robert Small and Tihan Presbie with a budget of £40,000. In 2008, Miniclip was valued at over £275 million. In 2018, the company gained over $400 million in revenue through its mobile gaming hit, &quot;8 Ball Pool&quot;.

==History==
As of July 2009, over 400 applications were hosted on its own website.

In February 2015, Tencent acquired majority stakes of Miniclip. In December 2016, Miniclip surpassed 1 billion downloads across its published mobile games on iOS-based, Android-based, and Windows Phone-based devices. In March 2022, Miniclip announced that it had reached 4 billion downloads worldwide with &quot;8 Ball Pool&quot; alone accounting for 1 billion of them.

In April 2021, Miniclip had celebrated its 21st anniversary. In response, the CEO of Miniclip claimed that it would be keeping away from developing browser-based games to prioritize its mobile gaming products, including &quot;Agar.io&quot;, &quot;8 Ball Pool&quot;, &quot;Mini Militia&quot;, &quot;Ludo Party&quot; and more.
In April 2022, Miniclip announced that it would begin prioritizing its mobile games. As a result, the browser game portal was shut down in July 2022 and the website lost all but its two most popular games of the time, &quot;Agar.io&quot; and &quot;8 Ball Pool&quot;.

In June 2022, Miniclip agreed to acquire SYBO, the co-publisher and co-developer of &quot;Subway Surfers&quot;, in an undisclosed deal. The deal with SYBO went through in July 2022.

In November 2024, Embracer Group announced that they would divest Easybrain to Miniclip for a consideration of $1.2 billion, with the transaction expected to close in early 2025.

==Studios==
==Mobile games==
Miniclip has developed and published numerous mobile games for iOS, Android, Symbian, and Windows Phone. This includes &quot;8 Ball Pool&quot;, &quot;Golf Battle&quot;, &quot;Gravity Guy&quot;, &quot;Bloons Tower Defense&quot;, &quot;On The Run&quot;, &quot;Plague Inc.&quot; for Android, &quot;Berry Rush&quot;, &quot;Agar.io&quot;, &quot;Diep.io&quot;, &quot;Mini Militia&quot;, and &quot;Ludo Party&quot;.

== Other platforms ==
In September 2012, Microsoft announced on the Windows blog on 31 August 2012 (see also List of Xbox games on Windows) that Miniclip games would be able to distribute their games on the Xbox division of Windows 8. Miniclip games that are supported by Xbox for Windows 8 include &quot;Gravity Guy&quot;, &quot;iStunt 2&quot;, and &quot;Monster Island&quot;. &quot;Gravity Guy&quot; was released on Windows Store on 29 November 2010.

In April 2013, most Miniclip games for Windows 8 and Windows Phone were distributed for free for one year.

On 14 February 2017, Miniclip released their first mobile racer game which was compatible with Xbox One, PC, and PlayStation 4, titled &quot;MX Nitro&quot;.

==Malicious software issues==
On 1 September 2005, the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team issued an advisory concerning Miniclip:

In 2006, several security firms reported that some Miniclip users had installed a &quot;miniclipgameloader.dll&quot; which contained the hostile code identified as &quot;Trojan Downloader 3069.” In the same year, another download related to Miniclip installed &quot;High Risk&quot; malware called &quot;Trojan-Downloader.CR64Loader.”

<doc id="667739" wikidata="Q620225" url="?curid=667739" title="Apostolic vicariate">
<text>An apostolic vicariate is a territorial jurisdiction of the Catholic Church under a titular bishop centered in missionary regions and countries where dioceses or parishes have not yet been established. The status of apostolic vicariate is often a promotion for a former apostolic prefecture, while either may have started out as a mission &quot;sui iuris&quot;. It is essentially provisional, though it may last for a century or more. The hope is that the region will generate sufficient numbers of Catholics for the Church to create a diocese one day. 

It is exempt under canon law, directly subject to the missionary Dicastery for Evangelization of the Vatican in Rome. Like the stage of apostolic prefecture which often precedes it, the vicariate is not part of an ecclesiastical province. It is intended to mature in developing Catholic members until it can be promoted to a (usually suffragan) diocese. 

The Eastern Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Church counterpart is an (apostolic, patriarchal, or archiepiscopal) exarchate.

==Institution==

An apostolic vicariate is led by a vicar apostolic, who is usually a titular bishop. While such a territory can be classed as a particular church, according to canon 371.1 of the Latin Code of Canon Law, a vicar apostolic&#x27;s jurisdiction is an exercise of the jurisdiction of the pope—the territory comes directly under the pope as &quot;universal bishop&quot;, and the pope exercises this authority through a &quot;vicar&quot;. 
This is unlike the jurisdiction of a diocesan bishop, whose jurisdiction derives directly from his office.

Like any ecclesiastical jurisdiction, an apostolic vicariate may be administered by the bishop of a neighbouring diocese, or by a priest appointed transitionally as an apostolic administrator. As in a regular diocese, the vicar apostolic may appoint priests as vicars exercising limited jurisdiction over the apostolic vicariate. Normally, a titular bishop is appointed to administer the apostolic vicariate. When someone who does not qualify or has not been ordained as bishop is appointed &quot;ad interim&quot;, he may be styled Pro-vicar.

An apostolic vicariate is to be distinguished from an apostolic prefecture, a similar type of territory whose chief distinction from an apostolic vicariate is that its prefect is not a titular bishop, but a priest. The prefecture is not considered organised enough to be elevated to apostolic vicariate. The less developed instance is the mission sui iuris, which other than the ones mentioned before is not a particular church, although it shares some similarities to one; at its head, an &quot;ecclesiastical superior&quot; is named. The usual sequence of development is mission, apostolic prefecture, apostolic vicariate, and finally diocese (or even archdiocese). See also apostolic exarch for an Eastern Catholic counterpart.

The apostolic vicariate is distinguished from a territorial abbacy (or &quot;abbey nullius&quot;)—an area not a diocese but under the direction of the abbot of a monastery.

Starting in 2019, new vicars apostolic, although they are (or become) bishops, are no longer assigned titular sees.

<doc id="667743" wikidata="Q2422185" url="?curid=667743" title="Thug Behram">
<text>Thug Behram ( – 1840), also known as Buhram Jamedar and the King of the Thugs, was a leader of the Thuggee cult active in Awadh in central India during the late 18th and early 19th century, and is often cited as one of the world&#x27;s most prolific serial killers. He may have been involved in up to 931 murders by strangulation between 1790 and 1840 performed with a ceremonial rumāl, a handkerchief-like cloth used by his cult as a garrote. Only 125 were confirmed.

==Biography==
While Behram is sometimes suspected of having committed 931 murders, James Paton, an East India Company officer working for the Thuggee and Dacoity Office in the 1830s who wrote a manuscript on Thuggee, quotes Behram as saying he had &quot;been present&quot; at 931 cases of murder, and &quot;I may have strangled with my own hands about 125 men, and I may have seen strangled 150 more.&quot;

The English word &#x27;thug&#x27; is, in fact, borrowed from the Hindi word &#x27;thag&#x27; (ठग). The thugs were covert members of a group, and the term &#x27;Thugee&#x27; typically referred to an act of deceitful and organised robbery and murder.

Buhram used his cummerbund or &quot;rumāl&quot;, with a large medallion sewn into it, as a garrote to execute his killing. Through sheer skill, he could cast the &quot;rumal&quot; to cause the medallion to land at the adam&#x27;s apple of his victims, adding pressure to the throat when he strangled them.

<doc id="667748" wikidata="Q2643510" url="?curid=667748" title="Kimberly Hart">
<text>Kimberly Ann Hart is a fictional character in the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; universe. Played by American actress Amy Jo Johnson during the first three seasons of the show, plus on the two feature films of the franchise, Kimberly has the longest tenure of any female ranger in the series&#x27; history, and fourth overall. She is best remembered as the first Pink Ranger (pterodactyl) and first Pink Ninja Ranger from the first entry of the franchise &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;. Kimberly was the Pink Ranger for nearly three years before she was written off the show as having given up her powers for good to Zordon&#x27;s new pink ranger Katherine Hillard, to participate at the Pan Global Games in Florida. However, she would briefly return as the Pink Ranger on three occasions. She first returned during the Legendary Battle of &quot;Power Rangers Super Megaforce&quot; alongside former teammates Zack Taylor, Billy Cranston, Trini Kwan, and Jason Lee Scott. The five of them later fought alongside the Dino Thunder Rangers, Dino Charge Rangers, and the Grid Battleforce Rangers against Goldar Maximus in &quot;Power Rangers Beast Morphers&quot;. She also returned to fight a robotic version of Rita Repulsa with the other four original rangers and Tommy Oliver in &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Once &amp; Always&quot;. Johnson did not reprise her role for any of these appearances. A reimagined version of Kimberly would appear in the 2017 reboot film, played by British actress Naomi Scott.

==Character history==
===&quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;===
Kimberly is one of the original five Power Rangers chosen by Zordon when Rita Repulsa attacked Earth following her release from containment. She, along with her close friends Jason Lee Scott, Zack Taylor, Billy Cranston and Trini Kwan, was one of the five teens chosen by Zordon to receive a great power, drawn from the spirits of the prehistoric animals. Kimberly receives the Pterodactyl Power Coin and the Pterodactyl Dinozord, thus becoming the Pink Power Ranger. Kimberly starts the series as a stereotypical valley girl, but with a heightened awareness for her friends. Throughout the series, she is the member of the team most likely to fire off a sarcastic or witty retort. However, as the series progresses, she becomes a deeper and kind-hearted person, due to experiences such as switching bodies with the nerdy Billy Cranston and being turned into a punk after Baboo administers a potion to one of Kimberly&#x27;s drinks. She also displays a cunning, clever and intuitive side, also inherited from her time in switching bodies with Billy.

Kimberly is a capable gymnast and was often shown training and using her abilities in fights against Rita&#x27;s forces, as she fought with a blend of gymnastic maneuvers, elbows and kicks. She often uses the environment around her as a springboard for her attacks and is often needed to defeat monsters with visible weaknesses, such as the archery-based Snizzard and the Terror Toad. She also teaches dance classes at Angel Grove&#x27;s Youth Center while using American Sign Language to interpret for a student with a disability. Kimberly is revealed to be proficient in many hobbies throughout the series, including designing and arranging the floral pattern for a parade float, being regarded as a great cheerleader throughout Junior High School and being able to sing and play guitar.

Kimberly&#x27;s best friend is Trini Kwan, with whom she starts a petition for environmental awareness and volunteered to become &quot;Big Sisters&quot; to Maria, a young girl who needed guidance. When Kimberly starts a botany club that is less popular than Trini&#x27;s volleyball club, Lord Zedd uses a spell to turn Kimberly&#x27;s jealousy into hatred; however, she overcomes the spell and the two girls defeat Zedd&#x27;s monster, the Bloom of Doom, before reaffirming that they are lifelong friends. Later, Mr. Caplan apologized to both Kimberly and Trini for accidentally switching the forms. When Trini leaves for a Peace Conference in Switzerland, Kimberly becomes close with Trini&#x27;s replacement, Aisha Campbell, with whom she shops with every day.

When Tommy Oliver transfers to Angel Grove, Kimberly becomes attracted to the young man on the spot and becomes visibly upset when Tommy&#x27;s demeanor toward her becomes hostile. After Tommy breaks Rita Repulsa&#x27;s spell, a relationship develops between the two after a series of tender moments, including the couple&#x27;s first kiss when Kimberly supports Tommy after losing his Green Ranger powers and accepts his invitation to a dance. Skull, one of the local bullies, had a crush on Kimberly, but she rejected him until beginning her relationship with Tommy. Years later, Skull was shown to still harbor feelings toward Kimberly, who was put under a love spell and became attracted to him. After the spell was broken, Kimberly apologized for her behavior, noting the two were friends and offering to dance with him.

In show&#x27;s second season, Kimberly controlled the Firebird Thunderzord. After Tommy lost his Green Ranger powers once again, this time permanently, and left Angel Grove, Kimberly frequently wished Tommy was still around. She was also kidnapped by Lord Zedd&#x27;s forces to serve as his new Queen as Zedd was attracted to her beauty and tenacity. However, Kimberly shows a clever and intuitive side to her and was able to stall Goldar with convincing Rita imitations. Irritated with reminders of Rita abusing him, Goldar was forced to retreat and her friends saved her. When Tommy returned as the White Ranger, Kimberly fainted upon seeing him and the two resumed their relationship, going on dates together.

Tommy and Kimberly&#x27;s relationship, as well as Kimberly and Aisha&#x27;s friendship, were tested many times by Lord Zedd, but the relationships always maintained intact. When Tommy and Kimberly ran against each other to become class president, they bickered until Tommy conceded the race. Kimberly was often isolated from the rest of the team and put into danger, but she overcame adversity each time, including landing her uncle&#x27;s airplane, escaping from Samurai Fan Man, Lord Zedd&#x27;s failed attempt to make her his newest consort, and recruiting the ancestors of her present-day friends to become the Wild West Rangers when she falls into a time hole that brings her to 1880s Angel Grove.

In the show&#x27;s third season, Kimberly remains on Earth with the flu while her friends travel to the planet Edenoi to help Dex, the Masked Rider; as a result, Kimberly battles a monster, Repellator, despite her illness. When Rito Revolto destroys the Thunderzords, Kimberly and the other Rangers travel to the Desert of Despair and gain new powers from the creator of the Power Coins, Ninjor. Kimberly becomes the Pink Ninja Ranger, harnessing the spirit of the crane and controlling the Pink Crane Ninjazord. Kimberly later moves in with Aisha&#x27;s family when her mother becomes engaged to a painter and moves to France; Zedd creates a monster, Artistmole, from Kimberly&#x27;s nightmares about her mother&#x27;s fiancé, but Kimberly defeats it. Kimberly was sad when her mother was not present for the 1995 holiday season, but she returned from France to surprise her daughter.

Midway through season three, Amy Jo Johnson requested that Kimberly be written off the show because she wanted to pursue other opportunities in acting. The character was accommodated with a 10-episode story arc focused on Kimberly, leading up to her departure. Kimberly and Aisha adopt a stray white cat, &quot;P.C.,&quot; who is the secret form of Rita&#x27;s new spy Katherine Hillard. Katherine also spies the Rangers in her human form; she ultimately develops feelings for Tommy and jealous of Kimberly&#x27;s relationship with him, steals Kimberly&#x27;s Power Coin; with the Coin in evil hands, Kimberly&#x27;s very life force is in danger. Lord Zedd kidnaps Kimberly and uses her as ransom for the other Rangers, but they rescue her. Zordon disconnects Kimberly&#x27;s connection to the Morphing Grid, forcing her to receive power from the other Rangers, much like Tommy had when he was losing his Green Ranger powers; Tommy consoled Kimberly through this time, as she had done previously for him.

Meanwhile, Kimberly caught the interest of a gymnastics coach, Gunthar Schmidt, and began training for the preliminaries of the Pan Global Games. As she trained, Rita and Zedd plotted to exploit this and tire Kimberly in battles; they succeed when she falls off a balance beam while training and injures herself. However, this event breaks Rita&#x27;s spell over Katherine, who calls an ambulance and convinces Kimberly not to give up on gymnastics. Katherine also returns Kimberly&#x27;s Power Coin back to her. When Zordon allows Kimberly to give up her Ranger duties to participate in the Pan Global Games, which occurred in Florida, Kimberly chose Katherine to replace her as the Pink Ranger, ending her appearances on the show. She is later referenced in &quot;Power Rangers Zeo&quot; when she sends a breakup letter to Tommy, explaining she had found someone else.
Amy Jo Johnson makes a final appearance as Kimberly in the franchise in &quot;&quot;, when she and Jason Lee Scott, return to Angel Grove to surprise the Rangers but are captured by the evil pirate queen Divatox, who plans to sacrifice the two to her fiancé, Maligore. Toward the end of the film, Jason and Kimberly are lowered into the volcano and possessed by the evil being Maligore. The Power Rangers must fight Jason and Kimberly until the wizard Lerigot cures them both of the evil influence. Shortly after Maligore&#x27;s defeat, Kimberly was last seen cheering on Jason, Tommy, and Adam in their martial arts tournament. The film hints at her being a romantic interest or in a relationship with Jason. She also switches from surfing clothes to leather outfits.

===&quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Once &amp; Always&quot;===
Kimberly was part of the reunited Mighty Morphin team who fought Robo-Rita in the battle that ended with Trini&#x27;s death. One year later, while gathering at the graveyard where Trini is buried, she, Jason, Tommy, Zack, and Billy are attacked again by Robo-Rita and two monsters the team had fought in the past, the Mighty Minotaur (from the episode &quot;Teamwork&quot;) and Snizard (from &quot;Foul Play in the Sky&quot;). She, Jason, and Tommy wind up captured by the latter and used by Robo-Rita to power a time machine so she can travel to the past and facilitate her conquest by killing the would-be Power Rangers before Zordon has a chance to choose them. They, as well as a handful of other captured Rangers, are released when the villains and the machine are destroyed. Because Johnson had declined to reprise her role, Kimberly does not appear unmorphed, but she is shown in archive footage at the end of the special playing a song of her composition (from the season 2 episode &quot;The Song of Guitardo&quot;).

===&quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot; tie-ins===

Kimberly appears in the &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot; and &quot;Go Go Power Rangers&quot; comics published by Boom! Studios, set during her early years as a ranger.

An alternate version of Kimberly also appears in the comic, first introduced as part of the &quot;Shattered Grid&quot; crossover event. This version of Kimberly hails from an alternate universe in which Tommy chose to stay with Rita, becoming the evil Lord Drakkon and conquering Earth. Kimberly and the other rangers formed a resistance group, but she was captured by Drakkon and brainwashed into becoming his henchman, now dubbed the Ranger Slayer. After Drakkon was captured while attacking the main universe, she and her Gravezord are sent to retrieve him but inadvertently emerges too far in the past. She attempts to attack the command center, but is found by her past self, who attacks her and breaks Drakkon&#x27;s mind control. To make up for her actions under Drakkon, Ranger Slayer saves this dimension&#x27;s Tommy, preventing his death in the future, and is recruited to the Promethea base to help stop Drakkon&#x27;s final plan. Following the reconstruction of the multiverse, Ranger Slayer and the Promethea are left drifting in a seemingly empty void, where she leads a new team of rangers in searching for a way home.

====&quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Pink&quot;====
Kimberly stars in a comic book miniseries published by Boom! Studios. The series is a modern remake but also serves as a continuation from Kimberly&#x27;s exit in the third season of &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;. After handing her powers over to Kat, Zordon uses the Sword of Light to activate the latent pink energy within Kimberly to make her a ranger once again. As the main team of Power Rangers are off world in this series, Kimberly asks Zack and Trini to join her on a mission as the black and yellow rangers respectively. She later recruits two French siblings as the blue male ranger and red female ranger. In forming this new team of rangers, Kimberly effectively becomes the leader. The events that take place in this series lead to Kimberly writing her letter which Tommy eventually receives in the &quot;Power Rangers Zeo&quot; episode, &quot;There&#x27;s No Business Like Snow Business&quot;. The comics ending shows that Kimberly had been changed from the experience, deciding that she preferred living life outside of being a full time Ranger, and that she initially lies to him about finding someone else so he doesn&#x27;t have to face how distant they became. It&#x27;s also suggested that Jason may indeed be the &quot;other guy&quot; in the letter as she sees a text from him confirming a lunch date as she is vocalizing her thoughts in regards to ending things with Tommy.

===Other versions===
====1995 film====
In &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie&quot;, Amy Jo Johnson portrayed a similar version of her character from the television series, who receives new powers from warrior Dulcea and becomes the Pink Ninja Ranger; she harnesses the spirit of the crane and controls the Pink Crane Ninjazord to defeat Ivan Ooze with her team. Unlike the television series, Kimberly&#x27;s Pink Ranger costume is more of an armor than a formfitting spandex garment.

==== &quot;Power/Rangers&quot; (2015 short film) ====
In &quot;Power/Rangers&quot; Kimberly Hart (played by Katee Sackhoff), in this much darker reimagining, in this timeline the Machine Empire defeats the Power Rangers and destroys the Megazord in battle, Earth&#x27;s governments negotiate a truce with the Machine Empire and the Power Rangers are disbanded. Kimberly married Jason Lee Scott, but their marriage lasted eight hours after Farkas Bulkmeier and Eugene Skullovitch betrayed them to the police. Jason was killed in the crossfire and Kimberly captured, whilst being interrogated by Rocky DeSantos, who has defected to the Machine Empire, he reveals it&#x27;s all part of his plan to capture Tommy Oliver. When Tommy appears, he and Rocky fight. Kimberly escapes her bonds and kills Rocky, however Tommy knows the real Kimberly died in his arms during the final battle, and it&#x27;s revealed she is Rita Repulsa in disguise the whole time, after killing Tommy&#x27;s teammates as part of her plan for him to re-join her so they can rule the world together.

====2017 film====

Kimberly appears in the 2017 film adaptation, played by English actress Naomi Scott. A former &#x27;mean girl&#x27; cheerleader at the school, Kimberly was removed from the cheerleading team and punished with detention for the remainder of the year after leaking a photograph of an ex-teammate, and former friend, in a compromising position. The largely negative reaction to the photograph forces Kimberly to realize how cruel her actions were for the first time. After falling out with her old friends, she cuts her hair short to represent the desire for change and new beginnings. Later that night she hikes up the mountains near the mining quarry and goes swimming to clear her head. She runs into Jason, who gave Billy a ride up to the quarry earlier that evening, and is subsequently present when Billy blows up the cliffside revealing the Power Coins. When the team is unable to morph, Kimberly confides in Jason that she believes she is the cause, as she cannot bring herself to tell her personal story to the team. He consoles her and tells her to be the person she wants to be and to not let past mistakes define her. Kimberly eventually joins the Rangers in the battle against Goldar and Rita.

In the teaser trailer, Kimberly is shown to be romantically involved with Jason when they kiss in his room, though this scene did not appear in the film. However, there still does seem to be a romantic interest in him and undertone between the two in the released film. In another deleted scene, she is shown to have a white father and an Indian mother (just as Naomi Scott has in real life), who do not approve of her new haircut.

Amy Jo Johnson makes a cameo appearance alongside Jason David Frank at the conclusion of the film as part of a crowd of civilians watching the battle between the newly formed Megazord and Rita&#x27;s monster, Goldar.

==Reception==
Kimberly has been criticized for being too stereotypically female by academia. Hart is considered the most popular female Power Ranger.

<doc id="667775" wikidata="Q7107685" url="?curid=667775" title="Ostium primum atrial septal defect">
<text>The ostium primum atrial septal defect is a defect in the atrial septum at the level of the tricuspid and mitral valves. This is sometimes known as an endocardial cushion defect because it often involves the endocardial cushion, which is the portion of the heart where the atrial septum meets the ventricular septum and the mitral valve meets the tricuspid valve.

Endocardial cushion defects are associated with abnormalities of the atrioventricular valves (the mitral valve and the tricuspid valve). These include the cleft mitral valve, and the single atrioventricular valve (a single large, deformed valve that flows into both the right ventricle and the left ventricle).

Endocardial cushion defects are the most common congenital heart defect that is associated with Down syndrome.

==Signs and symptoms==
On ECG a left axis deviation is generally found in ostium primum ASD, but an RSR pattern (M pattern) in V1 is characteristic. Fixed splitting of the second heart sound (S2) occurs because of equal filling of the left and right atria during all phases of the respiratory cycle.
Patients with atrial Septal Defects may have atrial fibrillation, atrial tachycardia, or atrial flutter, but these abnormal heart rhythms are not usually seen until the affected individual grows older. Features also seen on the ECG include right atrial enlargement and varying degrees of atrioventricular block. When a person is suspected of having an ASD based on the findings of an incomplete right bundle branch block with a rSr&#x27; or rSR&#x27;, the frontal plane QRS should be examined. The frontal plane QRS is the most helpful clue to distinguish between an ostium secundum ASD and an ostium primum ASD. In primum defects left axis deviation is seen in most patients with an axis of &gt; -30 degrees and very few patients have right axis deviation. In contrast ostium secundum defects have an axis between 0 degrees and 180 degrees with most cases to the right of 100 degrees.

In the ECG above, you can see an example of the rSR&#x27; pattern in V1 with a R&#x27; greater than S with T wave inversion which is commonly seen in volume overload right ventricular hypertrophy.

==Diagnosis==
===Classification===
A defect in the ostium primum is occasionally classified as an atrial septal defect, but it is more commonly classified as an atrioventricular septal defect.

==Treatment==
Hemodynamically significant ASDs (flow ratio 1.5:1) are large enough to be closed surgically. The long term prognosis is excellent. Pulmonary hypertension with shunt reversal is a contraindication for surgery, however the pulmonary hypertension can frequently be treated with medicines. The hole can then be closed safely with a good long term prognosis.

<doc id="667776" wikidata="Q1140574" url="?curid=667776" title="Shakespeare Programming Language">
<text>The Shakespeare Programming Language (SPL) is an esoteric programming language designed by Jon Åslund and Karl Wiberg. Like the Chef programming language, it is designed to make programs appear to be something other than programs — in this case, Shakespearean plays.

A character list in the beginning of the program declares a number of stacks, naturally with names like &quot;Romeo&quot; and &quot;Juliet&quot;. These characters enter into dialogue with each other in which they manipulate each other&#x27;s topmost values, push and pop each other, and do I/O. The characters can also ask each other questions which behave as conditional statements. On the whole, the programming model is very similar to assembly language but much more verbose.

== Programming in Shakespeare ==

=== Title ===
The first line in a Shakespeare program is called the &#x27;title&#x27;. The compiler considers anything from the first line to the first period to be a comment.

=== Dramatis Personae ===
This is the section where variables are declared. Each variable can hold a signed integer value and is of the following form:
 Name, Description
Where codice_1 is the name of the variable and codice_2 is ignored by the compiler. The compiler will recognize only those names that correspond to actual Shakespearean characters.

=== Acts and scenes ===
A piece of code in Shakespeare is broken into codice_3 which contain codice_4 in which characters (variables) interact. Each codice_5 and codice_6 is numbered with a Roman numeral and serves as a codice_7 label. Any code after the colon is considered a comment. They are written in the form:
 Act I: Hamlet&#x27;s insults and flattery.
 Scene I: The insulting of Romeo.

=== Enter, exit and exeunt ===
Individual lines of code generally take the form of a piece of dialogue spoken by one character to another; this is how the value of a variable (the character spoken to) is assigned, changed, or output. A character can only be addressed as &quot;You&quot;, &quot;Thou&quot;, or &quot;Thee&quot;. Thus, there must typically be exactly two characters &quot;on stage&quot; whenever lines are spoken: one to speak, and the other to be spoken to. To call a variable to the stage the codice_8 command is used with a list of one or more characters. The codice_9 command tells exactly one listed character to leave the stage. codice_10 calls more than one character to leave, or in the case that no characters are listed all the characters will leave the stage. The following format is used:
 [Enter Juliet]
 [Enter Romeo and Juliet]
 [Exit Romeo]
 [Exeunt Romeo and Juliet]
 [Exeunt]

=== Lines ===
Lines are represented as dialogue spoken by a character, and consist of at least one sentence. Each sentence may assign a new value to a variable, direct a variable to output its value, or direct it to receive an input. Lines can also manipulate stacks or act as if/then or goto statements. A line starts with a character&#x27;s name and a colon. Since this character is the speaker, the other character on stage is the variable that is addressed as &quot;You&quot;, &quot;Thou&quot;, or &quot;Thee&quot;.

==== Constants and assignment of values ====
Constants are represented by combinations of nouns and adjectives; the language recognizes a finite list of each, and both lists are separated into those having positive, negative, or neutral tone, as perceived by Åslund and Hasselström. Positive and neutral nouns have a value of 1 and negative nouns have a value of -1. Any adjective multiplies a noun by 2, and adjectives can be compounded. Possessive pronouns are ignored by the parser, while words pertaining to basic arithmetic are recognized as operations, such as &quot;sum&quot;, &quot;quotient&quot;, and &quot;cube&quot;. A sentence that assigns a value to a character starts with &quot;You&quot;, &quot;Thou&quot;, or &quot;Thee&quot;, may optionally continue with &quot;are as [any adjective] as&quot;, and then gives the mathematical formula in nouns, adjectives, variables, and operations for the new value. Examples of such lines follow:
 Hamlet:
 You lying stupid fatherless big smelly half-witted coward!
 Juliet:
 You are as villainous as the square root of Romeo!

The mathematical formulae can also use the names of other characters (even if those characters are not on stage) to utilize the current value of that character in a computation, or &quot;yourself&quot; or &quot;thyself&quot; for the character being spoken to.

==== Input and output ====
Lines can also call for a variable to give output or receive input. &quot;Open your heart&quot; outputs the variable&#x27;s numerical value, while &quot;Speak your mind&quot; outputs the corresponding ASCII character. &quot;Listen to your heart&quot; or &quot;Open your mind&quot; cause the variable to receive input from the user; the former for a number and the latter for a character.

==== Conditional statements and gotos ====
An if/then statement is phrased as a question posed by a character. The words &quot;as [any adjective] as&quot; represent a test for equality, while &quot;better&quot; and &quot;worse&quot; correspond to greater than and less than, respectively. A subsequent line, starting &quot;if so&quot; or &quot;if not&quot;, determines what happens in response to the truth or falsehood of the original condition. A goto statement begins &quot;Let us&quot;, &quot;We shall&quot;, or &quot;We must&quot;, continues &quot;return to&quot; or &quot;proceed to&quot;, and then gives an act or scene. A scene will be parsed as that scene in the current act; a goto statement cannot call a scene in a different act. A conditional statement to call a goto would look like this:
 Juliet:
 Am I better than you?
 Hamlet:
 If so, let us proceed to scene II.

==== Pushing and popping stacks ====
Each variable is a stack. A variable will have an integer pushed onto its stack if a line tells the character to &quot;remember&quot; an appropriate value, such as &quot;Remember me&quot;, or &quot;Remember yourself&quot;. The topmost value in the stack is popped (i.e., the variable assumes this value) if the character is told to &quot;recall&quot; anything; all text after this word is treated as a comment.

== Example code ==
The standard &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program:

The idea is to generate the ASCII values for each character of the string and print it using the &quot;Speak your mind&quot; command. For instance, the first line of dialog said by Hamlet uses a combination of arithmetic operations to assign the decimal value 72 (binary 1001000) to the other protagonist Romeo, which in ASCII corresponds to the letter &#x27;H&#x27;.

<text>Nuevo Reino de Galicia (New Kingdom of Galicia; ) or simply Nueva Galicia (&quot;New Galicia&quot;, &quot;Nova Galicia&quot;), known in Nahuatl as Chimalhuacán (‘the land of shield bearers’), was an autonomous kingdom of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. It was named after Galicia in Spain. Nueva Galicia&#x27;s territory consisted of the present-day Mexican states of Aguascalientes, Guanajuato, Colima, Jalisco, Nayarit and Zacatecas.
==History==
Spanish exploration of the area began in 1531 with Nuño Beltrán de Guzmán&#x27;s expedition. He named the main city founded in the area Villa de Guadalajara after his birthplace and called the area he conquered &quot;la Conquista del Espíritu Santo de la Mayor España&quot; (&quot;the Conquest of the Holy Spirit of Greater Spain&quot;). The name was not approved. Instead, Queen Joanna — at the moment the acting regent of Spain — named the area &quot;Reino de Nueva Galicia.&quot;

Guzmán&#x27;s violent conquest left Spanish control of the area unstable, and within a decade full war had reemerged between the settlers and the Native peoples of the area. The Mixtón War, which lasted from 1540–1541, pitted an alliance of Coras, Guachichils and Caxcans against the settlers. Nine years later the Chichimeca War broke out, this time pitting mostly Zacatecos against their former allies, the Caxcan, who had now allied with the Spanish. Nahuas from the Valley of Mexico moved into the region along with the Spanish as the area was settled. In the last decades of the sixteenth century Huichols also arrived.

Given the growing wealth of the region with the discovery of silver to the north, especially in Nueva Vizcaya, Guadalajara became the seat of the second mainland Audiencia of New Spain in 1548. The Audiencia of Guadalajara had oversight of all the northern mainland provinces of the Viceroyalty. The Audiencia at first was subordinate to the Royal Audiencia of Mexico but was made independent in 1572, with a separate governor or president. This enabled New Galicia to be ruled largely separate from the rest of the Viceroyalty.

There are a number of published chronicles on colonial Nueva Galicia. A 1621 account by Domingo Lázaro de Arregui, &quot;Descripción de la Nueva Galicia&quot; gives considerable information about the indigenous peoples of the area.

In the late 18th century, as part of the Bourbon Reforms, an Intendancy was established in Guadalajara. In 1824, after Mexican independence was consolidated, the kingdom was transformed into the State of Jalisco and the Territory of Colima.

===First territorial division===
