<text>Women&#x27;s basketball is the team sport of basketball played by women. It was first played in 1892, one year after men&#x27;s basketball, at Smith College in Massachusetts. It spread across the United States, in large parts via women&#x27;s college competitions, and has since spread globally. As of 2020, basketball is one of the most popular and fastest growing sports in the world.

There are multiple professional leagues and tournaments for professional women basketball players. The main North American league is the WNBA. The FIBA Women&#x27;s Basketball World Cup and Women&#x27;s Olympic Basketball Tournament feature top national teams from continental championships. In the US, the NCAA Women&#x27;s Division I Basketball Championship is also popular. The strongest European women&#x27;s basketball clubs participate in the EuroLeague Women.

== Early women&#x27;s basketball ==

Women&#x27;s basketball began in the fall of 1892 at Smith College. Senda Berenson, recently hired as a young &quot;physical culture&quot; director at Smith, taught basketball to her students, hoping the activity would improve their physical health. While for men, basketball was designed as an indoor addition to existing team sports such as baseball and football, basketball became the first women&#x27;s team sport, followed shortly after by hockey, rowing, and volleyball. Basketball&#x27;s early adherents were affiliated with YMCAs and colleges throughout the United States, and the game quickly spread throughout the country.

However, Berenson was taking risks simply in teaching the game to women. Nineteenth-century Victorian culture stressed the frailty of women and prioritized the status of women in the home, and Berenson expressed concern about the women suffering from &quot;nervous fatigue&quot; if games were too strenuous for them. In order to keep it acceptable for women to play at all within Victorian ideals of refinement and gentility, she taught modified rules. She increased participation to nine players per team, and the court was divided into three areas. Three players were assigned to each area (guard, center, and forward) and could not cross the line into another area. The ball was moved from section to section by passing or dribbling, and players were limited to three dribbles and could only hold the ball for three seconds. No snatching or batting the ball away from another player was allowed. A center jump was required after each score. Variations of Berenson&#x27;s rules spread across the country via YMCAs and women&#x27;s colleges, where educated middle-class women were following the prevailing trend in men&#x27;s games of playing intercollegiate sports.
Early basketball was played with peach baskets and soccer balls, similarly to the men&#x27;s game, but women&#x27;s uniforms again reflected the Victorian culture of the times and were designed to be practical, yet maintain the woman athlete&#x27;s dignity and femininity. While upper-class women had been playing sports at country clubs since the mid-nineteenth century, they were able to participate in activities such as tennis and croquet in full-length skirts and corsets. However, similar attire was impractical for a more active sport like basketball, so the first trousers for women were worn. Initially loose and covered by a knee-length skirt, these early pants were replaced soon after by loose bloomers over stockings. Despite men being forbidden from watching these collegiate games, the attire still drew public ridicule.
Originally exclusively intramural, the first intercollegiate women&#x27;s basketball game was played between teams from Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley, on April 4, 1896. Berenson herself opposed intercollegiate play for women, and prioritized the health and fitness benefits for a larger goal: she believed that women, newly entering the workforce and seeking paid jobs outside the home, were at a health-related disadvantage to men, which she saw as limiting women&#x27;s opportunities and the possibility for equal wages. For much of the early 20th century, other coaches and administrators felt similarly, due in part to an increasing sentiment that men&#x27;s college sports were becoming too commercialized and exploitive of the athletes. The women&#x27;s branch of the National Amateur Athletic Foundation was founded in the 1920s, and the organization&#x27;s goals included keeping women&#x27;s sports non-competitive by discouraging travel and awards, discouraging publicity, and keeping women coaches and administrators in charge of women&#x27;s sports.

From 1895 until 1970, the term &quot;women&#x27;s basketball&quot; (or, in New Zealand, &quot;outdoor basketball&quot;) was also used to refer to netball, at the time a women&#x27;s only sport broadly derived from basketball, which evolved in parallel with modern women&#x27;s basketball. The first professional women&#x27;s basketball team were the All American Red Heads. They were founded by C. M. &quot;Ole&quot; Olson in 1936.

== Recent women&#x27;s basketball ==
The popularity of women&#x27;s basketball grew steadily around the world for decades. By the 1970s, the sport had attracted the notice of the International Olympic Committee, which added women&#x27;s basketball as an official sport of the Olympic Games in 1976; the men had debuted in 1936. Throughout the 1970s, funding for (and interest in) women&#x27;s basketball began to dramatically increase as schools receiving federal funding began to come into compliance with new laws mandating a lack of discrimination based on sex. The sport was also gaining attention at the collegiate level, under the auspices of the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW). America&#x27;s first professional basketball league for women was founded in 1978 as the Women&#x27;s Basketball League. The WBL competed for three seasons, launching in 1979 with 8 teams. The league expanded to 14 teams in 1980. Financial issues, poor marketing, and the cancelation of America&#x27;s participation in the 1980 Summer Olympic Games severely impacted the league&#x27;s viability, and it collapsed at the end of its third season in 1981. The next major development in women&#x27;s basketball occurred in 1982 when the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) began to sponsor the sport. . After several failed attempts at women&#x27;s professional leagues in the U.S., the NBA founded the WNBA in 1996.

The first nationally televised championship game occurred in 1979. Ivy Kirkpatrick of Stephen F. Austin State University coordinated the collaboration between NBC Sports and the AIAW. Only the title game was televised with Old Dominion University defeating Louisiana Tech University. Thereafter the Women&#x27;s Final Four has been televised as an annual event. 

The recent Iowa-UConn women&#x27;s Final Four match in April 2024 was the most-watched basketball game in ESPN history with an audience peak at 17 million and is expected to feature as one of the top 50 primetime telecasts of 2024.

In the most recent 2024 season, the WNBA consisted of 12 teams across the United States. A 13th U.S. team will start play in 2025, with two more (one each from the U.S. and Canada) starting play in 2026.

A new 3-on-3 league, Unrivaled, will start play in January 2025, giving WNBA players a U.S.-based competitive outlet during that league&#x27;s offseason

==Rules and equipment==
Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly with five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball through the defender&#x27;s hoop. The rules for women&#x27;s basketball are almost identical to the rules for men&#x27;s basketball. The most noticeable differences are the circumference and mass of the women&#x27;s basketball, with the circumference being and the mass less than the men&#x27;s basketball. The smaller ball was introduced for NCAA play in the 

===Basketball size===
The regulation WNBA ball is a minimum in circumference, which is smaller than the NBA ball. This is a standard size 6 ball. As of 2008, this size is used for all senior-level women&#x27;s competitions worldwide.

===Court dimensions===
The standard court size in U.S. college and WNBA play is , while the FIBA standard court is slightly smaller at . For most of its distance, the three-point line is from the middle of the basket under both FIBA and WNBA rules. Near the sidelines, the three-point line runs parallel to the.sideline, at a distance of exactly a yard in the WNBA and 0.9 m in FIBA play. Under NCAA rules, the three-point distance is for most of the width of the court, with a minimum distance of from the sidelines. The WNBA, FIBA, and NCAA all use a block/charge arc near each basket, with the NCAA using an arc identical to the radius of the basket, the WNBA setting it at from the center of the basket and FIBA using a marginally wider radius of exactly .

===Shot clock===
The WNBA shot clock was changed from 30 to 24 seconds, which has been in FIBA play since 2000, and has been used by the NBA since the shot clock was first introduced in 1954. Both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s NCAA college basketball use a 30-second shot clock; the men&#x27;s clock was introduced in 1985 at 45 seconds, lowered to 35 seconds in 1993, and 30 seconds in 2015.

===Game clock===
Most high school games are played with four 8-minute quarters, while NCAA, WNBA, and FIBA games are played in four 10 minute quarters. In 2015–2016 the NCAA changed the rules to 10 minute quarters from 20 minute halves. High lobs or tip-ins can be attempted with up to 0.3 seconds left in the period per the Trent Tucker Rule.

A WNBA rule removed the jump ball at the start of the second half.

==Governance==
Women&#x27;s basketball is governed internationally by the International Basketball Federation (FIBA). Since 1953 FIBA has hosted a world championship tournament for women, currently known as the FIBA Women&#x27;s Basketball World Cup. The event, renamed from &quot;FIBA World Championship for Women&quot; after its 2014 edition, is currently held in even-numbered non-Summer Olympic years.

== Levels of competition ==
=== University ===
Berenson&#x27;s freshmen played the sophomore class in the first women&#x27;s collegiate basketball game held on 22 March 1893. University of California and Miss Head&#x27;s School, had played the first women&#x27;s extramural game in 1892. Also in 1893, Mount Holyoke and Sophie Newcomb College, coached by Clara Gregory Baer (the inventor of Newcomb ball) women began playing basketball. By 1895, the game had spread to colleges across the country, including Wellesley, Vassar and Bryn Mawr. The first intercollegiate women&#x27;s game was on 4 April 1896. Stanford women played California, 9-on-9, ending in a 2–1 Stanford victory. Clara Gregory Baer published the first book of rules for women&#x27;s basketball in 1895 she first called the game &#x27;Basquette&#x27;, a name later dropped in her first revision of rules, the Newcomb College Basketball Rules, published in 1908.

Despite participating in the first intercollegiate women&#x27;s basketball game, Stanford&#x27;s faculty athletic committee banned intercollegiate competition for women, first in team sports like basketball and later extending to all sports, and Cal (as well as many other prestigious colleges at the time) followed suit. In many cases, such bans were not lifted until the 1970s and the introduction of Title IX.

While Senda Berenson&#x27;s desire to limit competition was not realized forever, her larger goals were. College basketball and other women&#x27;s college sports impacted the American cultural mindset around women and women&#x27;s rights at the turn of the century, and colleges played a large role in enabling women to participate in athletics at all levels. Though in 1900 only 2.8% of American women were enrolled in college, the percentage of total college graduates who were women had increased to 36%, as colleges increased in number, size, and accessibility to larger portions of the population. The cultural significance of these college graduates exceeded their numbers, as college-educated women comprised the bulk of progressive professionals of their era. Women who played sports were able to craft a new image of femininity and athleticism, and the association between athletics and college was able to make sports acceptable and a central part of the image of progressive women in the early 1900s.

Women&#x27;s basketball continued to grow in universities across the country, expanding especially rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s as the Equal Rights Amendment raised awareness of unequal treatment in college athletics and the official position of the Division for Girls and Women in Sport (which later developed into the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women) was changed to allow and encourage women&#x27;s intercollegiate competition. In 1971 the five-player, full court game was adopted, followed by the Women&#x27;s Sports Foundation, which was formed in 1974. Women&#x27;s college basketball remains very popular throughout North America, with the sport being sponsored by all of the major college athletic associations: the NCAA, the NAIA, and the NCCAA for U.S. four-year schools; the NJCAA and CCCAA for U.S. two-year schools; the CCAA for Canadian colleges (equivalent to U.S. junior or community colleges); and U Sports for Canadian universities. NCAA Division I is considered the highest level of college competition, with the winner of the annual Division I championship game declared &quot;national champion&quot;.

===Professional leagues===

There have been professional leagues established in numerous countries.

==== Olympic Games ====
Women&#x27;s basketball has been contested in the Summer Olympics since 1976.


==== Additional International Competitions ====
In addition to the Olympics and Women&#x27;s World Cup, women&#x27;s basketball is also contested in the Pan American Games and the Central American and Caribbean Games. Women&#x27;s basketball made its first appearance at the Commonwealth Games in 2006. Basketball (for both men and women) is one of the sports that the host nation of the Island Games may select for competition. Wheelchair basketball, one of the original eight events of the Paralympic Games, also has a women&#x27;s wheelchair basketball championship program.

==Around the world==
===Africa===
AfroBasket Women is the women&#x27;s basketball continental championship of Africa, played biennially under the auspices of FIBA, the basketball sport governing body, and the African zone thereof. The tournament also serves to qualify teams for participation in the quadrennial FIBA Women&#x27;s Basketball World Cup and the Olympic basketball tournament.

===Asia===
The Women&#x27;s Chinese Basketball Association (WCBA) is a professional women&#x27;s basketball league established in 2002.

The Women&#x27;s Hong Kong Basketball Association is the highest women&#x27;s professional club basketball competition in Hong Kong.

The Indian National Basketball Championship for Women is a professional basketball tournament in India for women 

The Women&#x27;s Japan Basketball League is a premier women&#x27;s basketball league in Japan.

The Lebanese Basketball League or FLB League is the top-tier professional basketball league in Lebanon.

The Women&#x27;s Philippine Basketball League was a women&#x27;s basketball league in the Philippines

The Women&#x27;s Korean Basketball League (WKBL) is the premier women&#x27;s basketball league in South Korea

The Women&#x27;s Super Basketball League is the highest women&#x27;s professional club basketball competition in Republic of China

===Europe===
Before the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Russian Women&#x27;s Basketball Premier League was the dominant league in Europe (largely because it was the main attraction of the WNBA players during the off-season). Other notable leagues are the Italian Serie A1, the Spanish Liga Femenina and the Turkish Super League.

===England===

In England, the Women&#x27;s English Basketball League is a semi-professional and amateur competition. The league has grown steadily over recent years, and has now reached a level of thirty national league sides. The league is split into two levels. Division 1 is as close to professional as women&#x27;s sport gets in the United Kingdom, with teams such as Rhondda Rebels and Sheffield Hatters bringing in players from the US and Europe. The Nottingham Wildcats make up the trio of clubs that helped establish the women&#x27;s league and remain amongst the top three or four places. The gap between these top teams and the rest of the league has remained, but gradually as the women&#x27;s game has developed, the gulf in results has been reduced, and each year there have been more competitive games. 

Promotion from Division 2 has always reinforced the gap between the two leagues, as the winner of the Division 2 promotion play-offs has found the step-up difficult. The Division 2 play-offs take the top four teams from the North and South of the Second Divisions, with the top playing the bottom of the other pool. This year (2006/7) saw several new teams join the second division, showing the continual growth of the women&#x27;s game. These included the SevenOaks Suns, Enfield Phoenix, Taunton Tigers and Bristol Storm.

===Australia===

Professional women&#x27;s basketball exists in Australia in the form of the Women&#x27;s National Basketball League. The league was founded in 1981 as a way for the best women&#x27;s basketball teams in the various Australian States to compete against each other on a regular basis. Today the WNBL is the premier women&#x27;s basketball league in Australia.

===United States===
One of the major important events in the development of women&#x27;s basketball in the United States was Title IX.

Title IX was passed in 1972 to end sexual discrimination and stereotyping in admission to colleges and also in academic subjects (McDonagh, Pappano, 2008). Therefore, Congress&#x27; original goal was eliminating this discrimination in academic and educational processes. “Title IX is today generally viewed as having fixed the problem of gender inequality of sports, at least in educational settings” (McDonagh, Pappano, 2008, 79). It started out as simply involving education but then shifted in a debate to sports. Some groups such as the NCAA fought to keep things the way they were in reference to men&#x27;s sports. The NCAA had built up the programs and earned financial support and popularity and did not want to throw that down the drain (McDonagh, Pappano, 2008). In 1974, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare issued Title IX regulations regarding intercollegiate athletics (McDonagh, Pappano, 2008). Title IX implies that if a school has a specific sport&#x27;s team for boys then they must have a team in that same sport for girls. This will occur unless the men&#x27;s sport happens to be a contact sport in which the rule will not necessarily apply (McDonagh, Pappano, 2008). In 1978, colleges and universities were forced to apply Title IX&#x27;s rules and regulations. Athletic departments had to adhere to one of three requirements which were the proportionality rule, the gender equity rule, or historical progress rule (McDonagh, Pappano, 2008). Each of these requirements addressed Title IX and its regulations in a fair manner. To ensure that schools comply with Title IX, they face the consequence of losing federal funding for any violation (Sadker, 2001).

The proportionality rule entails that a school provides opportunities proportional to its enrollment. As an example, if a school is 55% male and 45% female then the athletic participation should be 55:45 (McDonagh, Pappano, 2008). Not only does the proportionality rule apply to athletic participation, but it also addresses scholarships. “So if a college is spending $400,000 per year on athletic scholarships and half of the athletic participants are women then half of that amount, $200,000, should be funding athletic scholarships for women (McDonagh, Pappano, 2008, 299). The gender equity rule entails that a school must prove that it “meets the interest of the gender that is underrepresented” (McDonagh, Pappano, 2008, 107) which happens to be women. The historical progress rule entails that if a school is unable to provide proportional opportunities then they must put forth an effort to create more opportunities for the underrepresented gender (McDonagh, Pappano, 2008).

Between 1971 and 2000, Title IX has proven to have had a huge impact on female collegiate sports. Sports participation among college women has risen from 372 percent over that time, from 32,000 to more than 150,000 women (McDonagh, Pappano, 2008, 108). Also now 33.5% of female students participate in sports (McDonagh, Pappano, 2008). The issue still remaining is that women&#x27;s sports beyond college do not benefit from Title IX. As a whole, they make less income than men in professional sports which Title IX cannot do much about. However, due to Title IX some women have gotten recognition as a result of the debate. &quot;Women athletes receive greater respect today but relatively skimpy media attention. Thank Title IX for…the growing visibility of women&#x27;s college basketball that has USA Today producing a pullout section for the women’s NCAA March Madness tournament&quot; (McDonagh, Pappano, 2008, 109).

Professional women&#x27;s basketball has been played in the United States. There have been several leagues, the most recent of which is the WNBA. The first attempt was the Women&#x27;s Pro Basketball League. The league played three seasons from the fall of 1978 to the spring of 1981. The league is generally considered to be the first American professional women&#x27;s basketball league to be founded.

The second women&#x27;s professional league to be created in the United States was the WBA. The league played three seasons from the summer of 1993 to the summer of 1995. The league is considered to be the first American professional women&#x27;s basketball league to be successful as a summer league, like the WNBA. The league played three full seasons with plans to play as a 12-team league in 1997 but disbanded before 1997 season. The WBA played a 15-game schedule and games were broadcast on Liberty Sports of Dallas. When FOX Sports purchased Liberty Sports and the WBA, they disbanded the league. 

In 1996, two professional women&#x27;s leagues were started in the United States. They were the American Basketball League and the WNBA. The American Basketball League was founded in 1996 during an increase in the interest in the sport following the 1996 Summer Olympics. The league played two full seasons (1996–97 and 1997–98) and started a third (1998–99) before it folded on 22 December 1998.

==== WNBA ====
The Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association or WNBA is an organization governing a professional basketball league for women in the United States. The WNBA was formed in 1996 as the women&#x27;s counterpart to the National Basketball Association, and league play began in 1997. The regular WNBA season is June to September (North American Spring and Summer). Most WNBA teams play at the same venue as their NBA counterparts. Most team names are also very similar to those of NBA teams in the same market, such as the Washington Wizards and Washington Mystics, the Minnesota Timberwolves and Minnesota Lynx.

Officially approved by the NBA Board of Governors on 24 April 1996, the creation of the WNBA was first announced at a press conference with Rebecca Lobo, Lisa Leslie and Sheryl Swoopes in attendance. While not the first major women&#x27;s professional basketball league in the United States (a distinction held by the defunct WBL), the WNBA is the only league to receive full backing of the NBA.

On the heels of a much-publicized gold medal run by the USA women&#x27;s national team at the 1996 Summer Olympic Games, the WNBA began its first season on 21 June 1997 to much fanfare. The league began with eight teams. The first WNBA game featured the New York Liberty facing the Los Angeles Sparks in Los Angeles and was televised in the United States on the NBC television network. At the start of the 1997 season, the WNBA had television deals in place with NBC, ESPN and Lifetime Television Network.

The league is divided into two conferences, the Eastern Conference and the Western Conference. In 2025, each of the 13 teams plays a 44-game regular season schedule, beginning in May and ending in mid September. Although the WNBA is divided into conferences for scheduling purposes, it has used a single table for purposes of playoff qualifying since the 2016 season. The eight teams with the best overall records, regardless of conference affiliation, compete in the WNBA Playoffs during September with the WNBA Finals in early October.

An All-Star Game is typically held in the middle of July, while regular play stops temporarily for it. From 2004 to 2020, no All-Star Game was played in Olympic years. With the rescheduling of the 2020 Olympics to 2021 due to COVID-19 concerns, an official All-Star Game was held in 2021, and again during the lead-in to the next Olympics in 2024. In all Olympic years, a break of about five weeks in the middle of the WNBA season allows players to participate in the Olympics as members of their national teams.

There have been a total of 18 teams in WNBA history, with the Golden State Valkyries starting play in 2025 and Portland&#x27;s as-yet-unnamed team and the Toronto Tempo set to start play by 2026. A total of five teams have folded: the Charlotte Sting, the Cleveland Rockers, Houston Comets, the Miami Sol and the Portland Fire (not related to the city&#x27;s future team). Three other teams have moved, two of them twice and the other once. The Utah Starzz have moved twice, first after the 2002 season to San Antonio, where they were first known as the Silver Stars and later as the Stars, and then after the 2017 season to Las Vegas as the Aces. At the same time the Starzz moved to San Antonio, the Orlando Miracle moved to Uncasville, Connecticut, where they now play as the Connecticut Sun. The Detroit Shock moved after the 2009 season to Tulsa, Oklahoma, where they played as the Tulsa Shock, and then moved to the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex after the 2015 season, now playing as the Dallas Wings. Since 1997 when the league was established, 12 teams have won the WNBA title. The Houston Comets were the first team to win the championship, winning 4 years in a row (1997, 1998, 1999, 2000). The Los Angeles Sparks have won 3 championships in their time in the league, 2001, 2002, 2016. The Tulsa Shock also won 3 championships before its relocation to Dallas–Fort Worth (2003, 2006, 2008). The Seattle Storm has 4 titles to its name, 2004, 2010, 2018, 2020. The Sacramento Monarchs were a WNBA team that won a championship in 2005. The Phoenix Mercury Won the WNBA championship 3 times in 2007, 2009, 2014. The Indiana Fever have one title to their name, coming in 2012. Both Seattle &amp; the Minnesota Lynx have the most championships of any of the teams currently active in the WNBA, with Lynx&#x27;s 4 championships that came in 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017. The Washington Mystics won their only title in 2019. In 2021 the Chicago Sky won the title. The Las Vegas Aces won back-to-back titles in 2022 and 2023, and the New York Liberty won the most recent 2024 title.

The WNBA values diversity and taking a stand.  Leadership within the WNBA has continuously broken-down barriers for women, racial injustice, and LGBTQ community as well as other underrepresented groups.  Since the birth of the WNBA in 1996, league leadership has empowered their athletes to do what is right for the league and what is right for society.  The WNBA’s stand with diversity and inclusion across the sports world has enabled a generation of women, people of color, the LGBTQ community, and many more to believe in themselves and strive to achieve greatness. The WNBA has been holding LGBTQ community celebrations since 2001, the year the Los Angeles Sparks became the first team across any professional sport to acknowledge and celebrate Pride Month, sparking a revolution in the sporting community to stand by and support the LGBTQ community. 

The WNBA continuously invests considerable amounts of recourses into educating youth through programs such as the Jr. NBA’s Her Time To Play program, the WNBA Cares program, as well as partner with several other community partners to deliver WNBA Pride and Take a Seat, Take a Stand initiatives.

<text>In the United States, the number of homeless people on a given night in January 2024 was more than 770,000 according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Homelessness has increased in recent years, in large part due to an increasingly severe housing shortage and rising home prices in the United States. Most homeless people lived in California, New York, Florida, and Washington in 2022, according to the annual Homeless Assessment Report. The majority of homeless people in the United States have been homeless for less than one year; two surveys by YouGov in 2022 and 2023 found that just under 20 percent of Americans reported having ever been homeless.

The main contributor to homelessness is a lack of housing supply and rising home values. Interpersonal and individual factors, such as mental illness and addiction, also play a role in explaining homelessness. However, mental illness and addiction play a weaker role than structural socio-economic factors, as West Coast cities such as Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, and Los Angeles have homelessness rates five times that of areas with much lower housing costs like Arkansas, West Virginia, and Detroit, even though the latter locations have high burdens of opioid addiction and poverty.

Historically, homelessness emerged as a national issue in the 1870s. Early homeless people lived in emerging urban cities, such as New York City. Into the 20th century, the Great Depression of the 1930s caused a substantial rise in homelessness. In 1990, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated the homeless population of to be 228,621, or 0.09% of the 248,709,873 enumerated in the 1990 U.S. census, which homelessness advocates criticized as an undercount. In the 21st century, the Great Recession of the late 2000s and the resulting economic stagnation and downturn have been major driving factors and contributors to rising homelessness rates. Increases in homelessness broke records in 2022 and in 2023. In 2023, record levels of homelessness have been declared in Los Angeles and New York City, and other cities around the country have reported increased levels of homelessness, with the main drivers being a shortage of affordable housing and the increased cost of living. In 2024, homelessness increased by a record 18%.

Health complications are significant concern for homeless people, as lack of residence inhibits hygiene and access to healthy food, and exposes individuals to both cold and heat stress, violence, and traffic deaths. This contributes to increased mortality rates. In &quot;City of Grants Pass v. Johnson&quot; (2024), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that anti-camping laws do not constitute a cruel and unusual punishment under the 8th Amendment even when no shelter is available, allowing cities to jail and fine homeless populations for sleeping and camping outside.

== Historical background ==

=== Pre-colonial and colonial periods ===

Following the 1381 Peasants&#x27; Revolt in England, constables were authorized under 1383 English Poor Laws to collar vagabonds and force them to show support. If they could not, the penalty was gaol.

Vagabonds could be sentenced to the stocks for three days and nights. In 1530, whipping was added. The presumption was that vagabonds were unlicensed beggars. In 1547, a bill was passed that subjected vagrants to some of the more extreme provisions of the criminal law, namely two years&#x27; servitude and branding with a &quot;V&quot; as the penalty for the first offense and death for the second.

Large numbers of vagabonds were among the convicts transported to the American colonies in the 18th century.

=== Urbanization ===

Homelessness emerged as a national issue in the 1870s. There are no national figures documenting homeless people&#x27;s demography at this time. Jacob Riis wrote about, documented, and photographed the poor and destitute, although not specifically homeless people, in New York City tenements in the late 19th century. His book, &quot;How the Other Half Lives&quot;, published in 1890, raised public awareness of living conditions in the slums, causing some changes in building codes and some social conditions.

The growing movement toward social concern sparked the development of rescue missions, such as America&#x27;s first rescue mission, the New York City Rescue Mission, founded in 1872 by Jerry and Maria McAuley. In smaller towns, there were hobos, who temporarily lived near train tracks and hopped onto trains to various destinations. Especially following the American Civil War, a large number of homeless men formed part of a counterculture known as &quot;hobohemia&quot; all over America.

By the late 19th century, many American towns and cities had significant numbers of homeless people. In New York City, for example, there was an area known as &quot;the Bowery&quot;. Rescue missions offering &quot;soup, soap, and salvation&quot;, a phrase introduced by The Salvation Army, sprang up along the Bowery thoroughfare, including the oldest one, The Bowery Mission. The mission was founded in 1879 by the Rev. and Mrs. A.G. Ruliffson.

=== 20th century ===

==== 1930s and 1940s ====

The Great Depression of the 1930s caused a devastating epidemic of poverty, hunger, and homelessness. There were two million homeless people migrating across the United States. Many lived in shantytowns they called &quot;Hoovervilles&quot; deriding the President they blamed for the Depression. Residents lived in shacks and begged for food or went to soup kitchens. Authorities did not officially recognize these Hoovervilles and occasionally removed the occupants for technically trespassing on private lands, but they were frequently tolerated out of necessity. When Franklin D. Roosevelt took over the presidency from Herbert Hoover, he passed the New Deal, which greatly expanded social welfare, including providing funds to build public housing.

==== 1960s and 1970s ====

A 1960 survey by Temple University of Philadelphia&#x27;s poor neighborhoods found that 75 percent of the homeless were over 45 years old, and 87 percent were white.

The Community Mental Health Act of 1963 was a pre-disposing factor in setting the stage for homelessness in the United States. Long term psychiatric patients were released from state hospitals into single-room occupancies and sent to community health centers for treatment and follow-up. Never adequately funded, the community mental health system struggled to meet patient needs and many of the &quot;deinstitutionalized&quot; wound up living on the streets, with no sustainable support system. In the United States, during the late 1970s, the deinstitutionalization of patients from state psychiatric hospitals was a precipitating factor which seeded the population of people that are homeless, especially in urban areas such as New York City.

==== 1980s and 1990s ====

The number of homeless people grew in the 1980s, nearly doubling from 1984 to 1987. According to Don Mitchell, this was in part due to the neoliberal reforms of the Reagan presidency, as housing and social service cuts increased and also the economy suffered a recession early in the decade. In 1984, the Federal government determined that somewhere between 200,000 and 500,000 Americans were homeless. There were some U.S. federal initiatives that aimed to help, end and prevent homelessness. However, there were no designated homeless-related programs in the Office of Management and Budget. Tent cities, which had largely vanished during the post-war period, began to re-emerge during this time.

The history of the United States in the 1980s illustrates that this was a time when there was economic distress, and high unemployment at points, and was the period when chronic homelessness became a societal problem. In 1980, federal funds accounted for 22% of big city budgets. By 1989, the similar aid composed only 6% of urban revenue, part of a larger 60% decrease in federal spending to support local governments. It is largely, although not exclusively, in these urban areas, that homelessness became widespread and reached unprecedented numbers.

Most notable were cuts to federal low-income housing programs. An advocacy group claims that Congress halved the budget for public housing and Section 8, the government&#x27;s housing voucher subsidization program, and that between 1980 and 1989, HUD&#x27;s budget authority was reduced from $74 billion, to $19 billion. Such alleged changes are claimed to have resulted in an inadequate supply of affordable housing to meet the growing demand of low-income populations. In 1970, there were 300,000 more low-cost rental units (6.5 million) than low-income renter households (6.2 million). By 1985, the advocacy group claimed that the number of low-cost units had fallen to 5.6 million, and the number of low-income renter households had grown to 8.9 million, a disparity of 3.3 million units.

In response to the ensuing homelessness crisis of the 1980s and after many years of advocacy and numerous revisions, President Reagan signed into law the McKinney–Vento Homeless Assistance Act in 1987. This remains the only piece of federal legislation that allocates funding to the direct service of homeless people. The McKinney–Vento Act paved the way for service providers in the coming years. In the 1990s, homeless shelters, soup kitchens, and other supportive services sprouted up in towns and cities nationally. Despite these efforts and the dramatic economic growth marked by this decade, homeless numbers rose and remained high from 1990 to 1999 according to the &quot;coalition for the homeless&quot; webpage. 

It became increasingly apparent that simply providing services to alleviate the symptoms of homelessness, such as shelter beds, hot meals, psychiatric counseling, although needed, were not successful at solving the root causes of homelessness. In 1987, the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH), a federal agency contained in the Executive Branch, was established as a requirement of the McKinney–Vento Act of 1987.

A 1990 survey found that most homeless people were unable to bathe or shower.

In 1992, the National Commission on Severely Distressed Public Housing published a report identifying 6% of public housing as &quot;severely distressed&quot;. This led to a 5 billion dollar funding package, HOPE VI, for replacing distressed public housing with mixed-income developments. The demolition of SROs was incentivized by increased real estate prices and neighborhood pressure, resulting in the teardown of more units than were initially identified. Redevelopments did not include nearly as many units of public housing as were demolished, decreasing the total stock of public housing and putting more people on the streets.

=== 21st century ===


==== Improved data ====
Over the past decades, the availability and quality of data on homelessness has improved considerably, due, in part, to initiatives by the United States government. Since 2007, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development has issued an Annual Homeless Assessment Report, which revealed the number of individuals and families that were homeless, both sheltered and unsheltered.

In the US Department of Housing and Urban Development&#x27;s 2008 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, the most common demographic features of all sheltered homeless people are: male, members of minority groups, older than age 31, and alone. More than 40 percent of sheltered homeless people have a disability. At the same time, sizable segments of the sheltered homeless population are white, non-Hispanic (38 percent), children (20 percent), or part of multi-person households (33 percent). About 68 percent of the 1.6 million sheltered homeless people were homeless as individuals and 32 percent were persons in families.

In 2008, more than 66% of all sheltered homeless people were located in principal cities, with 32% located in suburban or rural jurisdictions. About 40% of people entering an emergency shelter or transitional housing program during 2008 came from another homeless situation (sheltered or unsheltered), 40% came from a housed situation (in their own or someone else&#x27;s home), and the remaining 20% were split between institutional settings or other situations such as hotels or motels. Most people had relatively short lengths of stay in emergency shelters: 60% stayed less than a month, and a 33% stayed a week or less.

In 2009, there were about 643,000 sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons nationwide. About two-thirds of those stayed in emergency shelters or used transitional housing programs. The remainder lived on the street in abandoned buildings or other areas not meant for human habitation. About 1.56 million people, or about 0.5% of the U.S. population, used an emergency shelter or a transitional housing program between October 1, 2008, and September 30, 2009. Around 44% of homeless people were employed. In 2009, it was estimated that one out of 50 children or 1.5 million children in the United States of America would experience some form of homelessness each year.

There were an estimated 37,878 homeless veterans in the United States in January 2017, or 8.6 percent of all homeless adults, compared with about 7 percent of the U.S. adult population in 2018 that were military veterans. In 2013, Texas, California and Florida had the highest numbers of unaccompanied homeless youth under the age of 18, comprising 58% of the total homeless under 18 youth population. In 2020, New York City reported it had about 114,000 temporarily homeless school children.

From 2007 to 2015, homelessness appeared, from the federal survey, to be in decline. Beginning in 2016, the surveys showed a steady increase in homelessness, particularly among the unsheltered. 

The COVID-19 pandemic, and associated economic downturn, housing shortages and housing price inflation, outpacing wage growth, and the end of government protections and assistance to counter the economic effects of COVID-19 -- along with the explosive growth in addictions to methamphetamine, opioids, and Fentanyl -- contributed to a sharp rise in homelessness in the early 2020s. By 2023, according to the federal survey, a record 653,104 homeless were identified in the annual federal survey -- a 12% jump over the previous year, quadruple any other year&#x27;s increase, with increases in every category and demographic of homelessness.

In June 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling in the case &quot;Grants Pass v. Johnson&quot; that allowed for cities to ban homeless encampments. The homeless population in the United States rose by more than 18 percent in a single year in 2024, government officials said, driven by high housing costs, natural disasters and increased migration to big cities. According to the poll, the number of homeless people on a given night in January 2024 was more than 770,000. Children under 18 experienced the largest increase, with nearly 150,000 homeless on survey night. Overall, family homelessness is up 39 percent from the previous year.

== Causes ==

Lack of available and affordable housing as a cause of homelessness was named at the 2004 United States Conference of Mayors, surveying the mayors of major cities on the extent and causes of urban homelessness. The next three causes identified by mayors, in rank order, were mental illness or the lack of needed services, substance use and lack of needed services, and low-paying jobs. The lowest ranking cause, cited by five mayors, was prisoner reentry. Other causes cited were unemployment, domestic violence, and poverty.

The major causes of homelessness include:
* Lack of affordable housing throughout much of the country is considered the &quot;root cause&quot; of the contemporary homelessness crisis. Writing for &quot;The Atlantic&quot; in 2023, Jerusalem Demsas says that &quot;homelessness is primarily a function of the broader housing-unaffordability crisis, which in turn is primarily a function of how difficult local governments have made building new housing in the places that need it the most.&quot;
* Lack of sufficient urban housing projects to provide safe, secure, and affordable housing to the financially underprivileged. For low-wage workers, rents can be unaffordable in areas where their workplace is located.
* The deinstitutionalization movement from the 1950s onwards in state mental health systems, to shift towards &#x27;community-based&#x27; treatment of the mentally ill, as opposed to long-term commitment in institutions. There is disproportionally higher prevalence of mental disorders relative to other disease groups within homeless patient populations, at both inpatient hospitals and hospital-based emergency departments.
* Redevelopment and gentrification activities instituted by cities, through which low-income neighborhoods are declared blighted and demolished, to make way for projects that generate higher property taxes and other revenue, creating a shortage of housing affordable to low-income working families, the elderly poor, and the disabled.
* Nearly half of foster children in the United States become homeless when they are released from foster care at age 18.
* Natural disasters that destroy homes: hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, etc. Places of employment are often destroyed, causing unemployment and transience.
* People who have served time in prison, have used addictive substances, or have a history of mental illness find it difficult to find employment for years at a time because of the use of computer background checks by potential employers. Also inclusive of registered sex offenders who are considered unwelcome in some metropolitan areas. See prisoner reentry.
* People with criminal charges at large that are in hiding seeking to evade law enforcement.
* Adults and children who flee domestic violence.
* Teenagers who flee or are thrown out by parents who disapprove of their child&#x27;s sexual orientation or gender identity. A 2010 study by the Center for American Progress shows that a disproportionately high number of homeless youth, between 20 and 40%, are gay or transgender.
* Complex building codes which can make it difficult to build and construct. Traditional huts, cars, and tents can be illegal, classified as substandard and may require removal by the owner or be subject to removal by the government.

* Foreclosures of homes, including foreclosure of apartment complexes which displaces tenants renting there.
* Evictions from rented property.
* Lack of support from friends or family.
* Individuals who prefer homelessness and wish to remain off the grid for political and ideological purposes. Often self-identified as gutter punks or urban survivalists. The Department of Housing and Urban Development rarely reports on this counter-cultural movement, since its adherents often refuse to participate in governmental studies and do not seek governmental assistance for ideological or political purposes.
* Lack of resources in place in the communities to help aid in prevention of homelessness before it becomes a crisis.
* Neoliberal policies, reforms to the welfare state and the retrenchment of the social safety net.
* High rents, in particular areas where individuals could pay over a third of their income on rent and related costs increase the potential of homelessness. In poor communities, landlords increase the rent burden on tenants in what they perceive to be risky investments, extracting more profits from them than their counterparts in more affluent communities, which according to sociologist Matthew Desmond and his colleague, &quot;directly contributes to their economic scarcity and hardship and is a source of residential insecurity, eviction, and homelessness.&quot;
* Low-income workers are at increased risk of homelessness as wages for the typical American worker have stagnated over the last three decades, while housing costs have climbed, according to the National Alliance to End Homelessness.

=== Adverse childhood experiences ===
In a study on adverse childhood experiences, &quot;Nearly nine in ten homeless adults have been exposed to at least one early traumatic experience, and more than half of homeless adults have been exposed to four or more early traumatic experiences&quot;.

=== 2001–2020 ===
According to the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the demand for emergency shelter in 270 U.S. cities increased 13 percent in 2001 and 25 percent in 2005. Twenty-two percent of those requesting emergency shelter were turned away.

In response to the Great Recession in the United States, President Obama signed several pieces of legislation that addressed the homelessness crisis. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 addressed homelessness prevention, in which he allocated an additional $1.5 billion to HUD for the &quot;Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Rehousing Program (HPRP).&quot; The purpose of HPRP was to assist individuals and families who are otherwise healthy and not chronically homeless in escaping homelessness or preventing homelessness of the vulnerable population. 

In May 2009, President Obama signed the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing (HEARTH) Act, reauthorizing HUDs Homeless Assistance programs. It was part of the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009. The HEARTH act allows for the prevention of homelessness, rapid re-housing, consolidation of housing programs, and new homeless categories.

In 2011, the Federal government launched of &quot;Opening Doors: The Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness.&quot; &quot;Opening Doors&quot; is a publication of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, which worked with all Federal agencies and many state and local stakeholders on its creation and vision, setting a ten-year path on preventing and ending all types of homelessness. This plan was presented to the President and Congress in a White House Ceremony in June 2010.

In New York City, the number of homeless people using nightly shelter service tripled from about 20,000 to more than 60,000 between January 2000 and January 2015. By 2016, homelessness was considered an epidemic in several U.S. cities. In 2016, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and seven of the 15 City Council members announced they would declare a state of emergency and try to find $100 million &quot;to cure what has become a municipal curse.&quot;

In September 2018, in &quot;Martin v. City of Boise&quot;, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that the city&#x27;s Camping and Disorderly Conduct Ordinances violated the Eighth Amendment&#x27;s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. Cities cannot punish homeless people for sleeping in public when the homeless shelters are full.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, mass job loss and unemployment led to fears of mass evictions, as tenants became unable to pay rent. According to US government sources, homelessness has increased drastically, particularly in the US West, as real estate shortages drove up rents even higher, when people from already lower income levels were laid off from their jobs and evicted from existing housing. The estimates for homeless persons in the US during the COVID-19 pandemic range from 600,000 to 1.5 million people, making the US the worst affected industrialized country with regard to unhoused individuals.

In 2020, local city governments in California and Oregon started to intensify anti-homelessness campaigns, with limited success as local citizens reported extensive sprawls of homeless people in parks and public areas, creating unsanitary conditions with negative effects on small businesses. In March 2021, there were an estimated 6.4 million American households that were behind on rent.

Due to COVID, the Department of Housing and Urban Development&#x27;s 2021 report to Congress on the state of homelessness in the United States was unable to perform an accurate count of unsheltered homeless individuals. Instead, the report focused on point-in-time counts of sheltered homeless peoples.

=== Unaffordable housing ===
Homelessness is driven by a number of causes, but one of the most direct causes is a lack of affordable housing. According to the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, &quot;affordable housing shortages&quot; is among the top policy-related causes of homelessness, and 40%-60% of homeless people have a job, yet still cannot afford housing. In academic research, homelessness rates are directly correlated with increases in rent, most notably when the cost of rent in an area exceeds 30% of an area&#x27;s median income. In 2023, the surge in homelessness has been linked to soaring rents eating away at any worker wage gains not only in California and Washington, but also Arizona, Ohio, Tennessee and Texas.

In 2024, in California in particular, high housing costs were found to be a key driver of homelessness. A 2023 survey of homeless individuals in California found that among typical causes of homelessness, many people were driven into homelessness due to high rents and low incomes which could not cover the cost of rent. In San Diego, according to a 2023 report by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, Blackstone Inc. has contributed to the problem through aggressive evictions and rent increases of some 43-64% on vacant properties in two years.

In a 2022 book titled &quot;Homelessness is a Housing Problem&quot;, Clayton Page Aldern, a policy analyst and data scientist in Seattle, and Gregg Colburn, an assistant professor of real estate at the University of Washington&#x27;s College of Built Environments, studied homelessness rates across the country, along with what possible factors might be influencing the rates. They found that high rates of homelessness are caused by shortages of affordable housing, not by mental illness, drug addiction, or poverty.
 They found that mental illness, drug addiction and poverty occur nationwide, but not all places have equally expensive housing costs. One example cited is that two states with high rates of opioid addiction, Arkansas and West Virginia, both have low per capita rates of homelessness, because of low housing prices. With respect to poverty, the city of Detroit is one of the poorest cities, yet Detroit&#x27;s homelessness rate is 20% that of West Coast cities like Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego.

== Definitions and categories ==

The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development acknowledges four categories of people who qualify as legally homeless: (1) those who are currently homeless, (2) those who will become homeless in the imminent future, (3) certain youths and families with children who suffer from home instability caused by a hardship, and (4) those who suffer from home instability caused by domestic violence.

According to the 1994 Stewart B. McKinney Act, a person is considered homeless if they &quot;lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence and ... has a primary nighttime residency that is: (A) a supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide temporary living accommodations... (B) an institution that provides a temporary residence for individuals intended to be institutionalized, or (C) a public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings.&quot; Human Rights Watch (2010) identified emancipated teenagers in California as a new homeless population.

=== Homeless veterans ===
Homeless veterans are persons who have served in the armed forces, who are homeless or living without access to secure and appropriate accommodation. In January 2020, by HUD point-in-time measurements, there were an estimated 37,252 homeless veterans in the United States, or 8 percent of all homeless adults. In 2020, just over 8 percent of homeless U.S. veterans were female.

Throughout the 21st century, homeless service providers and the Federal government have been able to reduce chronic homelessness and homelessness among Veterans with targeted efforts and interagency cooperation on initiatives, like the HUD-VASH program. Indeed, the prominent role of the Department of Veterans Affairs and its joined up approach to veteran welfare help to distinguish the US response to veteran homelessness internationally.

=== Youth homelessness ===


The number of homeless children in the US grew from 1.2 million in 2007 to 1.6 million in 2010. The US defines homelessness as &quot;individuals who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence,&quot; per the 1987 McKinney–Vento Homeless Assistance Act. The number of homeless children reached record highs in 2011, 2012, and 2013 at about three times their number in 1983. In 2010, a study found that an &quot;estimated two million [youth] run away from or are forced out of their homes each year&quot; in the United States.

In 2009, one out of 50 children or 1.5 million children in United States of America was homeless each year. In 2013, that number jumped to one out of 30 children, or 2.5 million.

Texas, California and Florida have the highest numbers of unaccompanied homeless youth under the age of 18; comprising 58% of the total homeless under 18 youth population.

Street children in the United States tend to stay in the state. 83% do not leave their state of origin. If they leave, &quot;street children&quot; are likely to end up in large cities, notably New York City; Los Angeles; Portland, Oregon; and San Francisco. In 2010, street children were predominantly Caucasian and female in the United States, and 42% identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT).

The United States government has been making efforts since the late 1970s to accommodate this section of the population. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act of 1978 made funding available for shelters and funded the National Runaway Switchboard. Other efforts include the Child Abuse and Treatment Act of 1974, the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System, and the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act. There has been a decline of arrest rates in street youth, dropping in 30,000 arrests from 1998 to 2007. Instead, the authorities are referring homeless youth to state-run social service agencies.

In 2020, the National Center for homeless Education reported that in the U.S. public education system, over 1.5 million students experienced homelessness during their 2017 and 2018 school year.

According to the data, between 2023 and 2024, children under 18 see a 33% increase in homelessness, with 150,000 children experiencing this crisis.

==== LGBTQ+ youth ====
According to the Massachusetts Youth Risk Behavior Survey, one in four teens that participated in this survey who identify as gay or lesbian are homeless. Various sources report between 20 percent and 40 percent identify as LGBT. 2015 research shows that a disproportionate number of homeless youth in the United States identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, or LGBT.
=== Homeless families ===
The topic of homeless families first emerged in the United States during the 1980s, when social welfare programs were being cut and high rates of income inequality, child poverty, and the lack of affordable housing were becoming an issue. The issue of homeless families came back in 2009 after the Recession, which replicated the same issues from the 80s. The 2000s saw a new population of those experiencing homelessness: families with children. While an emerging problem at the beginning of the decade, the problem continued to persist to 2010. 

At the close of the decade the trend continued, with the number of individuals in homeless families increasing from 431,541 in 2007 to 535,447 in 2009. Though the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) conducts an annual Point-in-Time count of homeless people, including homeless families, its methodology has been criticized for under-reporting the number of homeless families. HUD reported that the number of homeless families decreased by 2% from 2017 to 2018, and by 23% from 2007 to 2018. However, 85% of local services for homeless people reported an increase during the same time. While HUD reported 111,592 homeless minors in 2018, the United States Department of Education reported 1.3 million homeless minors in the 2016 – 2017 school year.

In 2019, the state of New York had the greatest number of homeless families, at 15,901. California had the second-greatest number of homeless families, at 7,044, followed by Massachusetts at 3,766. Wyoming had the fewest, at 37.

In 2024, the percentage of families with children experiencing homelessness increased by 39%.

==== Homeless women with children ====

A 2007 study discovered that the three biggest risk factors that contributed to family homelessness in the United States are: ethnicity, lack of resources (specifically funds), and young children/pregnancy. There is a strong correlation between homeless families and households run and financed by a single female, especially one from a minority group and with at least two children. Single-income families, especially those below the federal poverty line, have a harder time finding housing than other families, especially given the limited affordable housing options.

Homeless families do not always take refuge in shelters, but being homeless also does not necessarily mean living on the streets. Homeless women with children are more likely to live with family or friends than those without children, and this group is treated with higher priority by both the government and society. In 2020, homeless mothers had a much higher prevalence of depression, at 40 to 85%, compared to 12% in women of all socioeconomic groups. Homeless mothers have higher rates of substance use, anxiety disorders, and PTSD. Nearly all of them (92%) experience physical or sexual abuse.

=== Chronic homelessness ===

In 2017, about 85,000 chronically homeless people were sleeping on the streets or in shelters. A chronically homeless individual is defined as an unaccompanied person who has been homeless for a consecutive year, or four or more periods of homelessness within the last three years, with a disability preventing them from working. This definition was expanded in 2009 due to the HEARTH act, to include families who were experiencing prolonged or repeating homelessness due to a disabled parent. A 2017 study found that leaving these individuals to remain on the streets can cost taxpayers up to $50,000 per year for a single chronically homeless individual, by them cycling in and out of treatment facilities, jails, hospitals and other institutional care facilities. Since 2007, the number of chronically homeless individuals has decreased by 33%, with Utah reporting to have achieved an end to chronic homelessness.

=== Episodic homelessness ===
An episodic homeless person is someone that has experienced three instances of homelessness within a given year. After four instances within a year, they are classified as chronically homeless. Episodic homelessness usually afflicts younger people that are fighting health issues or addiction.

=== Transitional homelessness ===
Transitional homelessness is a type of homelessness that&#x27;s a result of a major life change or catastrophic event. Those life events could include losing a job, a medical condition, divorce, domestic abuse, and more. It is likely that people experiencing episodic homelessness are young, and end up staying in shelters for a brief period.

=== Hidden homelessness ===
Hidden homelessness goes unreported and undocumented. Individuals who are classified as such are temporarily living with others with no guarantees for the long term.

The community of homeless people in the United States is aided by governmental and non-governmental organizations. According to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, in 2017, the number of people experiencing homelessness in unsheltered locations increased for a second straight year by 9% between 2016 and 2017. This issue is partly caused by a lack of affordable housing and is exacerbated by the criminalization of behaviors associated with homelessness. This problem is also costly for the country in supporting these individuals. Multiple studies have demonstrated success in reducing the homeless population as well as its harmful financial and societal effects by providing these individuals with a combination of housing without preconditions and supportive care. These studies include the 2014 Housing first implementation of the Department of Veterans Affairs National Center on Homelessness Among Veterans and a study performed through Brown University.

== Effects of homelessness ==

=== Effects ===
In 2004, the downtown partnership in Nashville, Tennessee, conducted a census on businesses. Sixty percent of respondents identified that public inebriates, transients and vagrants affect their employees, clients and customers. Businesses were solicited to identify issues that need to be addressed; transients and panhandlers ranked amongst the top five issues.

===Audio deterrents===

In 2019, two 7-Eleven locations — one in Sacramento, California, and one in Portland, Oregon — briefly employed a high-pitched noise maker to repel panhandlers and vagrants. In Portland, a local news source (750 KXL) described the sidewalk in front of the Downtown Portland 7-Eleven as being transformed from &quot;barely walkable&quot; to clean and orderly for the first time in years, after the repelling device was installed by the building&#x27;s owner, Standard Insurance Company. The manager of the 7-Eleven told reporters he would see as many as a dozen transients simultaneously loitering in front of his store, and that this loitering adversely affected his business. The building&#x27;s owner issued a statement that the goal was to protect the &quot;safety of their employees, tenants, and guests in a location that has been consistently plagued by public drug use and menacing behavior.&quot;

In 2019, a manager for a 7-Eleven in Modesto, California, also attested to the effectiveness of sound for deterring undesirable activity, commenting that &quot;Once the music started, the riffraff left.&quot;

=== The McKinney–Vento Homeless Assistance Act ===

Homelessness has a tremendous effect on a child&#x27;s education. Education of homeless youth is thought to be essential in breaking the cycle of poverty. The 1987 McKinney–Vento Homeless Assistance Act mandates equal opportunity to a free public education to homeless students. This act is supposed to break down the barriers homeless students have to receiving an education. These barriers include residency restriction, medical record verification, and transportation issues.

Once a student surpasses these barriers, they are still subject to the stigma of being homeless, and the humiliation they feel because of their situation. Some families do not report their homelessness, while others are unaware of the opportunities available to them. Many report that maintaining a stable school environment helps the students because it is the only thing that remains normal. Many homeless students fall behind their peers in school due to behavioral disorders, and lack of attendance in school.

Since the United States housing bubble collapse, there has been a rise in the number of homeless students. In December 2008, NAEHCY or the National Association for the Education of Homeless for Children and Youth, reported a 99% increase in homeless students within a three-month period in San Diego.

Of 1,636 schools in December 2008, 330 reported no increase in student homelessness, 847 reported an increase of half, and 459 reported an increase of 25 percent or more. Due to underfunding, many school districts struggled to provide the necessary services to support homeless students, as mandated in the provisions of the McKinney–Vento Act, such as rising transportation needs and the greater range and usefulness of services. Wisconsin Rapids Public Schools Homeless Liaison Heather Lisitza says:

This is especially worrisome since homeless students are 1) 1.5 times more likely to perform below grade level in reading; 2) 1.5 times more likely to perform below grade level in spelling; and 3) 2.5 times more likely to perform below grade level in math.
There are a few worries that there will be false reports of homeless students, but mostly it is not an issue.


As of 2011, there were laws that both directly and indirectly criminalized people that are homeless. As of 2012, some jurisdictions had made it illegal to attempt to feed homeless people outdoors. As of 2014, at least 31 cities have criminalized feeding people that are homeless.

In 2014, the United Nations Human Rights Committee criticized the United States for the criminalization of homelessness, noting that such &quot;cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment&quot; is in violation of international human rights treaty obligations. A 2018 report by Philip Alston, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, found that homeless persons have effectively been criminalized in many cities around the United States, and noted that &quot;punishing and imprisoning the poor is the distinctively American response to poverty in the twenty-first century.&quot; As of 2023, both Missouri, Tennessee, and Texas have passed laws to ban homeless public camping by homeless people, often punishing such behavior with felony charges, with other states considering similar legislation.

==== Vagrancy ====

As of 2024, some municipalities in the US make it a crime to provide food or shelter to homeless people. Some local jurisdictions make it illegal for homeless people to use blankets or soap.

In August 2012, a federal district judge in Philadelphia ruled that laws prohibiting serving food to homeless people outdoors were unconstitutional.

In June 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit struck down a 1983 ordinance in the city of Los Angeles which &quot;bans people from living in cars or recreational vehicles on city streets or in parking lots&quot; as being unconstitutionally vague, saying &quot;This broad and cryptic statute criminalizes innocent behavior, making it impossible for citizens to know how to keep their conduct within the pale. ... Unlike other cities, which ban overnight parking or sleeping in vehicles, Los Angeles&#x27; law prohibits using cars as &#x27;living quarters&#x27; both overnight and &#x27;day-by-day, or otherwise&#x27;.&quot;

In 2015, homeless rights advocates were pushing for &quot;Right to Rest&quot; bills in several states, to overturn laws that target homeless people for sitting, eating, and sleeping in public places.

In 2018, in &quot;Martin v. Boise&quot; the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that city ordinances banning sleeping outside cannot be enforced, if there are not enough shelter beds available in the city.

In 2024, in &quot;Grants Pass v. Johnson&quot; the US Supreme Court ruled that cities may criminalize homelessness, as homelessness constitutes conduct, not status, and that the precedent set in &quot;Robinson v. California&quot; does not apply.

=== Crimes against homeless people ===
Since the 1990s, there has been a growing number of violent acts committed upon people experiencing homelessness. The rate of such documented crimes in 2005 was 30% higher than of those in 1999. Some teens engage in this activity as a source of amusement. CNN reported in 2007 that such incidents were on the rise.

In 2006, the Center for the Study of Hate &amp; Extremism (CSHE) at California State University, San Bernardino in conjunction with the NCH found that 155 homeless people were killed by non-homeless people in &quot;hate killings&quot;, while 76 people were killed in all the other traditional hate crime homicide categories, such as race and religion, combined.

Studies and surveys indicate that homeless people have a much higher criminal victimization rate than the non-homeless, but that most incidents never get reported to authorities. A 2007 study found that the number of violent crimes against homeless people is increasing. In 2013, there were 109 attacks on homeless people, a 24 percent increase on the previous year, according to the NCH. Eighteen people died as a result of the attacks. In July 2014, three boys 15, 16 and 18, were arrested and charged with beating to death two homeless men with bricks and a metal pole in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

As in other countries, criminals—both individuals and organized groups—sometimes exploit homeless people, ranging from identity theft to tax and welfare scams. Homeless people, and homeless organizations, are also known to be accused or convicted of frauds and scams. These incidents often lead to negative impressions of homeless people by the general public.

=== Health ===
Homelessness is a public welfare and health epidemic within the United States. Any period of homelessness is associated with adverse health consequences. These adverse health consequences are associated with poor living conditions and a lack of access to treatment facilities. Due to living in extreme poverty, it is unlikely for an individual or a family to have a healthcare plan. These healthcare plans are important in obtaining treatment for illnesses or injury from treatment facilities. Without it, individuals and families are left to deal with their ailments themselves or endure further financial burden by receiving treatments without a health insurance plan. 

Respiratory infections and outbreaks of tuberculosis and other aerosol transmitted infections have been reported. Homeless intravenous drug users are at an increased risk of contracting HIV, and hepatitis B and C infections. 

The close living spaces of areas such as Skid Row in California provide an environment in which infectious diseases can spread easily. These areas with a high concentration of homeless individuals are dirty environments, with little resources for personal hygiene. A 2018 report to congress estimated that 35% of homeless people were in unsheltered locations not suitable for human habitation.

There is a bidirectional relationship between homelessness and poor health. Homelessness exacts a heavy toll on individuals. The longer individuals experience homelessness, the more likely they are to experience poor health and be at higher risk for premature death. Health conditions, such as substance use and mental illness, can increase people&#x27;s susceptibility to homelessness. Conversely, homelessness can cause further health issues, due to constant exposure to environmental threats such as violence and communicable diseases. Homeless people have disproportionately high rates of poly substance use, mental illness, physical health problems and legal issues/barriers in attaining employment.

A 2000 study found that large numbers of homeless people work, but few homeless people are able to generate significant earnings from employment alone. Physical health problems limit work and daily activities, which are barriers to employment. Substance use is positively associated with a lower work level, and negatively related to a higher work level. Those with physical health problems are substantially more likely than those with mental health problems to be in the more generous disability programs. Substance use disorders are a barrier to participation in disability programs. A 2015 study found that rates of participation in government programs are low, and that people with major mental disorders have a low participation rate in disability programs.

====Homeless deaths====
US homeless deaths surged 77% from 2016 to 2020. A February 2022 analysis in &quot;The Guardian&quot; found that some 18,000 homeless people died on the streets and in encampments and shelters over a five year period, with 5,000 of these deaths occurring in 2020. The non-profit National Health Care for the Homeless Council places homeless deaths at between 17,000 and 40,000 annually. Many are never counted, given that the federal government does not track homeless deaths nationally.

The top direct causes of death among the homeless population include &quot;drug overdoses, violence, traffic deaths and premature lethality of treatable conditions like heart disease.&quot; Regarding drug deaths, methamphetamine is a significant killer, as people who are homeless use the stimulant drug to stay awake and alert in order to protect themselves from violence. The report notes that outside of direct medical causes of death, a major factor contributing to both the epidemic of homelessness and surge in deaths among the homeless population is the lack of affordable housing throughout much of the country.

====Homelessness among the elderly====
A 2023 report found that Homelessness among the elderly has been increasing. A 2002 report by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health found that homeless persons die at greater rates than the general public from specific causes. They are more likely to die by: 35 times from alcohol or drug overdoses, 16 times from auto accidents, 14 times from murder, 8 times from suicide, and 4 times from heart disease. September 2023 HUD data found that the elderly are the fastest growing demographic of the homeless population.

In 2023, Judge Milan Smith Jr., an American jurist claimed that homelessness is &quot;presently the defining public health and safety crisis in the western United States.&quot; According to 2023 Los Angeles homeless services authority data, on average, six unhoused people die in Los Angeles each day. The causes reported of death are overdoses, heart disease, traffic accidents, homicides, hypothermia, and heat exhaustion. Va Lecia Adams Kellum, Lahsa&#x27;s CEO, believes &quot;The primary causes of homelessness are economic.&quot;

==== Comprehensive health care ====
Comprehensive healthcare usually refers to a form of medical care that meets a patient&#x27;s whole needs through the provision of a wide range of health services. This form of holistic care in relation to homeless people is often difficult for them to access, due to issues of location, stigma, etc, and difficult for care givers to perform and manage, as a result of the unpredictability of homeless people day to day.

==== Tailored care approach ====
As high-risk and socially disadvantaged persons, homeless patients tend to require a lot of acute care, of short term but active treatment, with poor results. Due to the conditions homelessness creates, acute care and health is difficult to manage and maintain. The Tailored Care approach recognizes the situation of homeless people and seeks to provide specialized care to the homeless community. Studies have found that the tailored approach is good at engaging homeless persons seeking health care for the first time. These health care facilities position themselves in homeless shelters or in areas easily accessible to the homeless population. Some of these health care providers also provide meal kits, on-site showers, transportation, and hygiene kits. This form of holistic and tailored care leads to the reduction in emergency service use, and hospitalizations amongst the homeless community.

This approach has been used in the government-sponsored Health Care for the Homeless Model (HCH Model). Each HCH project is federally funded, and works as federally qualified health centers that work at the intersection of multiple disciplines. These health centers usually provide their patients access to health services such as primary care, mental health services, and addiction services, as well as social services such as after-jail services and case management. There is no set structure that each health center needs to follow—each health center has the agency to provide a variety of services based on their networks and connections with the local neighborhood, government, or community, but are not mandated to do so except for providing primary care.

==== Children&#x27;s health ====
For children, there are risks to seeking refuge in shelters, which are heightened and more noticeable for children. Children&#x27;s homelessness health risks include malnutrition from lack of access to food with nutritional content, behavioral problems associated with coping, social insecurity from growing up in an unstable environment, and mental illnesses such as PTSD and trauma.

==== Mother&#x27;s health ====
Just as children who come from homeless families are at a higher risk of developing behavioral, mental, and physical health problems than their peers, their mothers are also at a higher risk especially in developing mental illnesses. There are many things that contribute to why homeless women are at a higher rate of developing a mental illness compared to the general population, but there has been a reoccurring theme among studies focused on this issue.

==== Mental health ====
In 2006, homeless individuals reported mental illness as being the number three reason for becoming or staying homeless. Such illnesses are often closely linked with the fourth reason—substance use—and therefore it is generally accepted that both of these issues should be treated simultaneously. Although many medical, psychiatric, and counseling services exist to address these needs, it is commonly believed that without the support of reliable and stable housing, such treatments remain ineffective. In the absence of a universal healthcare plan, many of those in need cannot afford such services.

A 2020 representative sample of homeless youth across multiple US cities found that, in each city, more than 80% of the sampled individuals met criteria for at least one psychiatric diagnosis. A 2020 Epidemiological study found that only about 25–30% of homeless persons have a severe mental illness such as schizophrenia. Early studies, comparing homeless persons found that depression and suicidal thoughts were very prevalent, along with symptoms of trauma and substance abuse.

== Efforts towards ending homelessness ==

=== Housing ===

In 2006, homeless individuals reported a lack of affordable housing as the number one reason for becoming homeless.

The two main types of housing programs provided for homeless people are transitional and permanent housing. Transitional housing programs are operated with one goal in mind—to help individuals and families obtain permanent housing as quickly as possible. Transitional housing programs assist homeless for a fixed amount of time, or until they are able to obtain housing on their own and function successfully in the community, or whichever comes first.

Some shelters and associated charitable foundations have bought buildings and real estate to develop into permanent housing for homeless people in lieu of transitional Housing.

The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and Veterans Administration have a special Section 8 housing voucher program called VASH (Veterans Administration Supported Housing), or HUD-VASH, which gives out a certain number of Section 8 subsidized housing vouchers to eligible homeless and otherwise vulnerable US armed forces veterans. The HUD-VASH program has been successful in housing many homeless veterans.

In 2018, the number of U.S. citizens residing in their vehicles because they cannot find affordable housing has &quot;exploded&quot;, particularly in cities with steep increases in the cost of living such as Seattle, Los Angeles, Portland, and San Francisco. Bloomberg reported in November 2018 that the wealthiest cities in the U.S., in particular those in the Western states, are experiencing a homelessness crisis driven largely by stagnant wages and &quot;skyrocketing rents&quot;.

In 2019, Google pledged one billion USD into funding 20,000 homes over the next decade throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. The Bay Area is booming with economically successful people, who end up driving up the price of housing and increases the divide between the people who need the housing and the new houses being built. In particular, the metropolitan area of San Francisco has some of the most expensive real estate in the United States.

==== Housing First ====
Housing First is an evidence based approach, that recognizes housing as one of the most impactful social determinants of health that affect those experiencing homelessness. Housing First has been met with success since its initial implementations in 2009, by providing relatively no strings-attached housing to homeless people with substance use disorder problems or mental health issues. Housing First allows homeless men and women to be taken directly off the street into private community-based apartments, without requiring treatment first. This allows homeless people to return to some sense of normalcy, from which it is believed that they are better-poised to tackle their addictions or sicknesses. The relapse rate through these types of programs is lower than that of conventional homeless programs. 

The BHH Collective is a program that has implemented the Housing First approach. It began in 2015 as an initiative in Chicago, Illinois, between BHH and University of Illinois Hospital to provide for frequently homeless emergency department patients. The housing was paid for by the hospital and federal housing subsidies. The program provides the individuals with case managers, specialized health services based on the individual&#x27;s needs, and other services they need. BHH Collective aims to address the connection between housing and health by providing supportive housing to homeless individuals in order to improve the health of homeless people and address homelessness at the same time.

==== Other transitional housing interventions ====
Studies have been conducted to demonstrate the ability of homeless people to receive and maintain houses and jobs when provided with adequate support. In LA&#x27;s Homeless Opportunity Providing Employment (HOPE), for homeless adults with mental illness, individual characteristics in regards to specific mental illness or substance abuse played little role in the systemic difference to the employment outcomes. However, these factors including race and ethnicity, affected individual housing outcomes.

The provision of housing for homeless people reduces healthcare costs, inpatient hospitalizations, and emergency room costs. When provided with supportive housing, many homeless people are eligible for healthcare coverage. People with housing are less likely to need health services, as a stable home provides protection from the elements, prevention from sicknesses, wounds and infections, and a generally safer environment than the streets. This is what Rapid Rehousing programs (RRHP) support. Designed to aid families experiencing homelessness, RRHP provides access to private affordable housing markets for a better transition back into stable housing. The three major parts necessary for the program&#x27;s success are: finding landlords and appropriate housing, providing move-in assistance; providing case management and support services to ensure the prolonged and eventual permanent rehousing success of each family.

In the early 2000s, the provision of housing for homeless persons was contingent on their treatment and abstinence from addictive substances. However, emerging Permanent supportive housing approaches reversed the requirements, and provided homeless people housing without evidence of treatment for mental illness or substance abuse. These interventions are usually paired with case managers. With the inclusion of income assistance programs, there is a significant increase in number of days spent stably housed for participating individuals.

=== Employment ===
Many homeless people in the United States work, both part-time and full-time. Employment opportunities can be useful in providing financial stability to homeless individuals. Estimates of unemployment within the homeless population range from 57% to 90%. Programs seeking to help homeless people find and maintain jobs usually focus on individual characteristics of homeless people as barriers, such as addiction and mental illness. 

Research indicates that there are systemic factors that exclude homeless people from the work force, such as expectations, and the overall structure of the labor market. The rise of temporary employment in the modern labor market has made homeless people unable to secure stable employment and income, to ensure their ability to afford and maintain a house.

=== Federal and presidential efforts ===
In 2001, President Bush made ending chronic homelessness by 2012 as part of his Compassion Agenda, as his campaign promised to fully fund the McKinney Act. The bi-partisan, congressionally mandated, Millennial Housing Commission included ending chronic homelessness in 10 years, among its principal recommendations in its Report to Congress in 2002. By 2003, the Interagency Council on Homelessness had been re-engaged and charged with pursuing the President&#x27;s 10-year plan. 

In October 2003, the Administration announced the award of over $48 million in grants aimed at serving the needs of the chronically homeless, through two initiatives. The &quot;Ending Chronic Homelessness through Employment and Housing&quot; initiative was a collaborative grant offered jointly by HUD and the Department of Labor (DOL). With the focus on providing housing and employment for the homeless population, there was not much attention placed on their comprehensive health. Addressing homeless health is difficult in a traditional healthcare setting, due to the complex nature of the needs of homeless people and the multitude of health consequences they face. In 2003–04, during the 108th United States Congress meeting, the proposed Bringing America Home Act was intended to provide comprehensive treatment for many homeless mental and substance use disorder patients - it has not been passed or funded.

In 2010, under President Obama&#x27;s administration, a federal strategic plan to end homelessness was released. This plan created four key goals: Prevent and end homelessness among Veterans in 5 years; Finish the job of ending chronic homelessness in 7 years; Prevent and end homelessness for families, youth, and children in 10 years; Set a path to ending all types of homelessness. Capitalizing on these insights, the Plan built on previous reforms and the intent by the Obama Administration to directly address homelessness through intergovernmental cooperation for rehabilitating the homeless population and preventing homelessness to those at high-risk. In 2015, First Lady Michelle Obama called for the collaboration of mayors, governors, and county officials to commit to ending Veteran homelessness in their communities, and reached out to additional mayors and local leaders to participate.

=== Public libraries ===
In May 1991, Richard Kreimer, a homeless man in Morristown, N.J. sued the local public library and the Town of Morristown for expelling him from the library, after other patrons complained about his disruptive behavior and pungent body odor. He later won the case and settled for $250,000.

Public libraries can and often do significantly assist with the issues presented by homelessness. In many communities, the library is the only facility that offers free computer and internet access. This is where many people experiencing homelessness go to locate services for basic needs, such as healthcare, education, and housing. Library computers are necessary for building a resume, searching for open jobs in the area, and completing job applications.

A 2010 article and video entitled, &quot;SF library offers Social Services to Homeless,&quot; speaks about the San Francisco library having a full-time social worker at the library to reduce and help homeless patrons. It mentions that Leah Esguerra, who is a psychiatric social worker, has a usual routine making her rounds to different homeless patrons, and greeting them to see if she could help them. She offers help in different forms that could range from linking patrons with services, or providing them with mental health counseling. She supervises a 12-week vocational program that culminates in gainful employment in the library for the formerly homeless.

The San Jose University Library became one of the first academic libraries to pay attention to the needs of homeless people and implement changes to better serve this population. In 2007, the merged University Library and Public Library made the choice to be proactive in reaching out. Collaborations with non-profit organizations in the area culminated in computer classes being taught, as well as nutrition classes, family literacy programs, and book discussion groups. After eighteen months, the library staff felt they still were not doing enough and &quot;analyzed program participation trends supplemented by observation and anecdotes&quot; in order to better understand the information needs of homeless people. When it was understood that these needs are complex, additional customer service training was provided to all staff who were interested. 

Once the staff more fully understood the needs of homeless people, it was determined that many programs in place already, with a few minor adjustments, would be helpful to homeless people. For example, the providing book clubs have proven to be very effective bridges between librarians and homeless people. Programs were tailored to meet these needs. Additional changes implemented included temporary computer passes and a generous in-house reading space to counteract the policies in place that may prevent a homeless person from obtaining a library card.

The Dallas Public Library started &quot;Coffee and Conversation&quot; which is part of their Homeless Engagement Initiative. The staff hopes these bimonthly events between staff and homeless patrons will help them better serve the homeless people population in Dallas. They sponsor Street View podcast, a library produced podcast featuring the stories and experiences of the city&#x27;s homeless population. Guests often include social service providers.

== Situations in cities and states ==
As of 2023, the issue of homelessness in the US is severe, with states like California, New York, Florida, Texas, and Washington having a combined number of over 330,000 homeless people. In 2023, California alone had over 161,000. Although begging and panhandling is one of the main ways homeless people obtain money, in Kansas, Mississippi, and Maryland, begging and panhandling are considered crimes. In June 2024, a U.S. Supreme Court 6-3 ruling, permitted cities to enforce bans on homeless people sleeping in public places.

== Public attitudes ==
Many advocates for homeless people contend that a key difficulty is the social stigma surrounding homelessness. Many associate a lack of a permanent home with a lack of a proper bathroom and limited access to regular grooming. Thus, people that are homeless become &quot;aesthetically unappealing&quot; to the general public. Research shows that &quot;physically attractive persons are judged more positively than physically unattractive individuals on various traits... reflecting social competence.&quot;

In addition to the physical component of stigmatization exists an association of homeless people with mental illness. Many people consider the mentally ill to be irresponsible and childlike and treat them with fear and exclusion, using their mental incapacitation as justification for why they should be left out of communities.

A common misconception persists that many individuals who panhandle are not actually homeless, but actually use pity and compassion to fund their lifestyles, making up to $20 an hour and living luxurious lives. This exception to the rule seems more prevalent due to media attention, but in reality, only a few cases exist.

Public opinion surveys show relatively little support for this view. A 1995 paper in the &quot;American Journal of Community Psychology&quot; concluded that &quot;although the homeless are clearly stigmatized, there is little evidence to suggest that the public has lost compassion and is unwilling to support policies to help homeless people.&quot; A Penn State study in 2004 concluded that &quot;familiarity breeds sympathy&quot; and greater support for addressing the problem.

A 2007 survey conducted by Public Agenda, a non-profit organization that helps leaders and their citizens navigate through complex social issues, found that 67 percent of New Yorkers agreed that most homeless people were without shelter because of &quot;circumstances beyond their control&quot;, including high housing costs and lack of good and steady employment. More than one-third (36 percent) said they worried about becoming homeless themselves, with 15 percent saying they were &quot;very worried.&quot; 90 percent of New Yorkers believed that everyone has a right to shelter, and 68 percent believed that the government is responsible for guaranteeing that right to its citizens. The survey found support for investments in prevention, rental assistance and permanent housing for homeless people.

Research by Public Agenda concluded that the public&#x27;s sympathy has limits. In a 2002 national survey, the organization found 74 percent say the police should leave a homeless person alone if they are not bothering anyone. In contrast, 71 percent say the police should move homeless people if they are keeping customers away from a shopping area. 51 percent say homeless people should be moved if they are driving other people away from a public park.

== Statistics and demographics ==

Completely accurate and comprehensive statistics are difficult to acquire for any social study, but especially so when measuring the ambiguous hidden, and erratic reality of homelessness. All figures given are estimates. These estimates represent overall national averages. The proportions of specific homeless communities can vary substantially depending on local geography.

=== Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress ===
Perhaps the most accurate, comprehensive, and current data on homelessness in the United States is reported annually by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in the Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress (AHAR), released every year since 2007. The AHAR report relies on data from two sources: single-night, point-in-time counts of both sheltered and unsheltered homeless populations reported on the Continuum of Care applications to HUD; and counts of the sheltered homeless population over a full year provided by a sample of communities based on data in their Management Information Systems (HMIS).

=== Other statistics ===
==== Total number ====

Over the course of the year (October 2009 – September 2010), the 2010 Annual Homeless Assessment Report found that 1,593,150 individuals experienced homelessness. Most were homeless temporarily. The chronically homeless population, those with repeated episodes or who have been homeless for long periods, decreased from 175,914 in 2005 to 123,833 in 2007. In the 2017 AHAR (Annual Homeless Assessment Report) about 553,742 people experienced homelessness, which was a 1% increase from 2016. An April 2022 YouGov survey found that 19 percent of Americans reported having ever been homeless, while a December 2023 survey found that 17 percent of Americans reported having been homeless at one point in their lives.

==== Familial composition ====

In the 2010 NCHWIH report:
* 51.3% are single males.
* 24.7% are single females.
* 23% are families with children—the fastest growing segment.
* 5% are minors unaccompanied by adults.
* 39% of the total homeless population are children under the age of 18.

==== Marital status ====

In the 2014 NCHWIH report:
* 24% are married.
* 76% are single.
* 67.5% are single males within the single percentage.
* 32.5% are single females within the single percentage.

==== Race and ethnicity ====

In the 2010 SAMHSA report, among all sheltered individuals over the course of a year (October 2009-September 2010):
Gender, Age, Race/Ethnicity
* 41.6% are White, Non-Hispanic
* 9.7% are White, Hispanic

<text>Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole (March 26, 1871 – January 7, 1922) was a prince of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi until it was overthrown by a coalition of American and European businessmen in 1893. He later went on to become the delegate of the Territory of Hawaii to the United States Congress, and as such is the only royal-born member of Congress.

Kūhiō was often called Ke Aliʻi Makaʻāinana (Prince of the People) and is well known for his efforts to preserve and strengthen the Hawaiian people.

Kalanianaʻole was born March 26, 1871, in Kukuiʻula, Kōloa on the island of Kauaʻi. Like many &quot;aliʻi&quot; (Hawaiian nobility) his genealogy was complex, but he was an heir of Kaumualiʻi, the last ruling chief of Kauaʻi. He was named after his maternal grandfather Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, a High Chief of Hilo, and his paternal grandfather Jonah Piʻikoi, a High Chief of Kauaʻi. His Hawaiian name Kuhio translated into &quot;Chief who leaned forward as he stood,&quot; and &quot;Kalanianaʻole&quot; meant &quot;ambitious Chief,&quot; or &quot;Chief who is never satisfied.&quot;

== Education ==
He attended St. Alban&#x27;s College, now ʻIolani School and Oahu College (now Punahou School), in Honolulu on the island of Oʻahu. In the 1870s, a French school teacher at St. Alban&#x27;s, commented on how the young man&#x27;s eyes twinkled merrily and how he kept a perpetual smile. &quot;He is so cute, just like the pictures of the little cupid&quot;, teacher Pierre Jones said. The nickname, &quot;Prince Cupid&quot;, stuck with Prince Kūhiō for the rest of his life.

After completing his basic education he traveled abroad for further study. His uncle King Kalākaua pushed for future Hawaiian leaders to attain a broader education with his 1880 Hawaiian Youths Abroad program. The Hawaiian government sent Kūhiō and his two brothers Kawānanakoa and Keliʻiahonui to attend Saint Matthew&#x27;s School in San Mateo, California in 1885. Keliʻiahonui died in 1887 while at home from school.

In 1890, Kūhiō and Kawānanakoa were sent to attend schools in the United Kingdom. This came a year after their cousin Kaʻiulani was also sent to England for school He studied at the Royal Agricultural College in England before graduating from business school in England. He was described as an excellent marksman and athlete at sports such as football and cycling.

== Surfing ==
While attending school in San Mateo, Kūhiō and his brothers surfed the Pacific seashore at Santa Cruz. The brothers demonstrated the Hawaiian sport of board surfing to the locals, becoming the first California surfers in 1885. In September 1890, Kawānanakoa and Kūhiō became the first surfers in the British Isles and taught their English tutor John Wrightson to surf on the beaches of Bridlington in northern England.

== Prince of the Kalākaua dynasty ==

After the rule of the House of Kamehameha ended with the death of King Kamehameha V in 1872, and King Lunalilo died in 1874, the House of Kalākaua ascended to the throne of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi. He became an orphan after his father died in 1878 and mother in 1884. Kalanianaʻole was adopted by King David Kalākaua&#x27;s wife, Queen Kapiʻolani, who was his maternal aunt. This practice was called &quot;hānai&quot;, a traditional form of adoption widely used in ancient Hawaii, which made Kalanianaʻole a Prince of the Kingdom. After Kalākaua&#x27;s death in 1891, Liliʻuokalani became queen, and she continued to favour Kalanianaʻole.

He worked in a minor position within the Department of the Interior and Customs Office.

However, in 1893 the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii put in power first a Provisional Government of Hawaii, and then a republic with no role for monarchs.

== Post-overthrow activities ==

At age twenty-four, he participated in the 1895 Wilcox rebellion against the Republic of Hawaiʻi. The rebels proved no match for the Republic troops and police, and shortly after hostilities began, all those involved in the rebellion were routed and captured. Kūhiō was sentenced to a year in prison while others were charged with treason and sentenced to execution (commuted to imprisonment). Kūhiō served his full term. His fiancée, Elizabeth Kahanu Kalanianaʻole visited him daily.

In 1898, the United States annexed Hawaii and the Territory of Hawaii was formed in 1900. His cousin Princess Kaʻiulani and his aunt Queen Dowager Kapiʻolani, who left her properties to Kūhiō and his brother, died in 1899. In responses to these personal losses, Kūhiō and his wife left Hawaii from March 1900 to September 1901. They traveled widely in the United States and Europe, where they were treated as royalty. He traveled to South Africa where he either enlisted in the British Army or accompanied the army as an observer in the Second Boer War.

== From prince to statesman ==

Kūhiō returned from his self-imposed exile to take part in politics. He became active in the Home Rule Party of Hawaii, which represented native Hawaiians and continued to fight for Hawaiian independence.

On July 10, 1902, Prince Kūhiō split from the Home Rule Party, walking out of its convention along with nearly half of the other delegates. He formed the short-lived Hui Kuokoa Party. However, by September 1, 1902, Kuhio decided to join the Republican Party, was nominated as their candidate for Congress, and dramatically altered the political landscape. Kūhiō was elected delegate to the U.S. Congress as a Republican.

Kūhiō circulated a letter to Senators in 1920 that is descriptive of his thinking. &quot;After extensive investigation and survey on the part of various organizations organized for the purpose of rehabilitating the race, it was found that the only method in which to rehabilitate the race was to place them back upon the soil.&quot;

He served from March 4, 1903, until his death, winning a total of ten elections. During this time he instituted local government at the county level, creating the county system that survives in Hawaiʻi. He staffed the resulting civil service positions with Hawaiian appointees. This move combined the political patronage system of 19th century American politics with the traditional Hawaiian chiefly role of beneficent delegation of authority to trusted retainers.

In 1903, Kūhiō reorganized the Royal Order of Kamehameha I, which held the first observance of the Kamehameha Day holiday in 1904. He was a founder of the first Hawaiian Civic Club on December 7, 1918. He helped organize a centenary celebration of the death of Kamehameha I in 1919.

In 1919, Kūhiō introduced in Congress the first-ever Hawaii Statehood Act. Forty years passed before it came to fruition.

=== Women&#x27;s suffrage ===
In 1915, political parties in the territory asked Kūhiō to bring a bill to the U.S. Congress that requested the right for the territorial legislature to rule on women&#x27;s suffrage. The Organic Act which established the Territory of Hawaii and specifically forbade the territorial legislature from granting suffrage on the local level contrary to the federal constitution. Kūhiō received no attention from Congress on the matter, but brought the issue forward again in 1916.

In 1917 Kūhiō brought another bill to the United States Congress that was put forward by Senator John F. Shaforth. The bill would allow the territory of Hawaii to decide suffrage. In 1918 New England suffragist Almira Hollander Pitman, who was married to the son of Hawaiian chiefess Kinoʻoleoliliha, helped successfully advocate for the passage of that bill. Pitman used her political contacts to help Kūhiō. The bill was enacted in June 1918.

After the revision to the Organic Act, the Hawaiian legislature debated allowing women&#x27;s suffrage from 1919 to 1920. The issue became deadlocked due to disagreement between the Hawaii Territorial Senate and the Hawaii Territorial House about whether the bill would take effect in the primary election of 1919 or 1920 and whether a referendum should decide the issue. Local legislation never passed because the following year Congress passed the suffrage-granting Nineteenth Amendment.

=== Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1921 ===
During this period, the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1921 was enacted. Despite Kūhiō&#x27;s wishes, the Act required that recipients verify blood-quantum requirements (the degree to which their ancestors were native Hawaiian), and leased land instead of granting fee-simple ownership, creating a perpetual government institution. This act and those that followed remain controversial in Hawaiian politics, and were used to justify more recent legislation such as the Akaka Bill. Kūhiō served on the first Hawaiian Homes Commission starting on September 16, 1921.

==Death and funeral==
Kūhiō died on January 7, 1922. His body was interred near his royal family at the Royal Mausoleum known as Mauna ʻAla in Nuʻuanu on the island of Oʻahu. His widow Kahanu used her own funds (later reimbursed by the territorial government) to renovate the chapel at the mausoleum in his honor.

== Personal life ==
In 1888, Kalākaua sent Kūhiō to Japan where he was a guest of the Japanese government. He had wished that Kūhiō would marry a Japanese princess but this political alliance never materialized.

On January 29, 1894, when Princess Kaʻiulani was nineteen, Liliʻuokalani wrote asking her to consider marrying either Prince David Kawānanakoa, Prince Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, or an unnamed Japanese prince (then studying in London). She reminded her, &quot;It is the wish of the people that you should marry one or the other of the Princes, that we may have more [A]liis. There are no other Aliis who they look to except Prince David or his brother, who would be eligible to the throne...&quot; It took five months for Kaʻiulani to respond to Liliʻuokalani&#x27;s suggestion. In a June 22, 1894, letter Kaʻiulani asserted that she would prefer to marry for love unless it was necessary stating, &quot;I feel it would be wrong if I married a man I did not love.&quot;

Kūhiō married Elizabeth Kahanu Kaʻauwai.

== Legacy ==
Kūhiō is memorialized by streets, beaches and surf breaks, Kuhio Beach Park in Poipu near his birthplace, the Prince Kūhiō Plaza Shopping Center, and the Prince Kuhio Federal Building named in his honor. Prince Kūhiō Day on March 26 is a state holiday that honors Kūhiō&#x27;s birth. Three of Hawaii&#x27;s public schools also honor him: Kalani High School in Honolulu, Prince Jonah Kūhiō Elementary School in Honolulu and Prince Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole Elementary and Intermediate School in Papaikou, Hawaii, near Hilo on the Island of Hawaii.

<doc id="667990" wikidata="Q2698246" url="?curid=667990" title="Über">
<text>Über (, sometimes written uber in English-language publications) is a German language word meaning &quot;over&quot;, &quot;above&quot; or &quot;across&quot;. It is an etymological twin with German &quot;ober&quot;, and is a cognate (through Proto-Germanic) with English &quot;over&quot;, Dutch &quot;over&quot;, Swedish &quot;över&quot; and Icelandic &quot;yfir&quot;, among other Germanic languages; it is a distant cognate to the Sanskrit word &quot;ūpari&quot; and Hindi &quot;ūpar&quot; (both meaning &#x27;above&#x27;, &#x27;over&#x27; or &#x27;up&#x27;), probably through Proto-Indo-European. The word is relatively well known within Anglophone communities due to its occasional use as a hyphenated prefix in informal English, usually for emphasis. The German word is properly spelled with an umlaut, while the spelling of the English loanword varies.

==In German==
In German, &quot;über&quot; is a preposition, as well as being used as a prefix. Both uses indicate a state or action involving increased elevation or quantity in the physical sense, or superiority or excess in the abstract.

:elevation: &quot;überdacht&quot; - roof-covered, roofed, [also: reconsidered, thought over] (&quot;überdacht&quot; (from &quot;Dach&quot; (roof)) means roof-covered, roofed while &quot;überdacht&quot; (from the strong verb &quot;denken&quot;-[&quot;dachte&quot;, &quot;gedacht&quot;] (&quot;think&quot;, &quot;thought&quot;, &quot;thought&quot;) means reconsidered, thought over)
:quantity: &quot;über 100 Meter&quot; - more than 100 meters, &quot;Überschall&quot; - supersonic
:superiority: &quot;überlegen&quot; - (adj) superior, elite, predominant. (verb) to think something over
:excess: &quot;übertreiben&quot; - to exaggerate, &quot;überfüllt&quot; - overcrowded)

As a preposition, &quot;über&quot;″s meaning depends on its context. For example, &quot;über etwas sprechen&quot; – to speak about something, &quot;über die Brücke&quot; – across the bridge.

&quot;Über&quot; also translates to &quot;over&quot;, &quot;above&quot;, &quot;meta&quot;, but mainly in compound words. The actual translation depends on context. One example would be Nietzsche&#x27;s term &quot;Übermensch&quot;, discussed below; another example is the Deutschlandlied, which begins with the well-known words &quot;Deutschland, Deutschland über alles&quot; meaning &quot;Germany, Germany above everything&quot; (this stanza is not sung anymore, because it is mistaken as meaning &quot;Germany above the rest of the world&quot;; its original meaning was the German nation above its constituent states [Prussia, Hanover, Württemberg etc.]).

The German word &quot;unter&quot;, meaning &quot;beneath&quot; or &quot;under&quot;, is antonymous to &quot;über&quot;. &quot;Unter&quot; can be found in words such as U-Bahn (&quot;Untergrundbahn&quot; – underground (rail-)way), U-Boot (&quot;Unterseeboot&quot; – submarine, lit. &quot;under sea boat&quot;), as well as toponyms, such as Unter den Linden (&quot;Below the linden trees&quot;).

Grammatically, &quot;über&quot; belongs to that set of German prepositions that can govern either the accusative case or the dative case (&quot;an, auf, hinter, in, neben, über, unter, vor, zwischen&quot;). The choice is determined by whether the prepositional phrase indicates movement (accusative) or an unmoving state (dative).

==In English==

===Origins===
The crossover of the term &quot;über&quot; from German into English goes back to the work of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. In 1883, Nietzsche coined the term &quot;Übermensch&quot; to describe the higher state to which he felt men might aspire. The term was brought into English by George Bernard Shaw in the title to his 1903 play &quot;Man and Superman&quot;. During his rise to power, Adolf Hitler adopted Nietzsche&#x27;s term, using it in his descriptions of an Aryan master race. It was in this context that American Jewish comic book creator Jerry Siegel encountered the term and conceived the 1933 story &quot;The Reign of the Superman&quot;, in which the mentally advanced superman (not to be confused with his later superhero character) is a villain. Shortly afterward, Siegel and artist Joseph Shuster recast Superman into the iconic American hero he subsequently became. It is through this association with the superhero that the term &quot;über&quot; carries much of its English sense implying irresistibility or invincibility.

===Differences from the German===

====Spelling====
The normal transliteration of the &quot;ü&quot; (&#x27;u&#x27; with an umlaut) when used in writing systems without diacritics (such as airport arrival boards, older computer systems, etc.) is &quot;ue&quot;, not just &quot;u&quot;.

====Meaning====
Because of different usage, the English language version of the word is distinct from &quot;über&quot;. It is not possible to translate every English &quot;uber&quot; back into &quot;über&quot;: for example, &quot;uber-left&quot; could not be translated into &quot;Überlinks&quot;: a Germanophone would say &quot;linksaußen&quot; (literally &quot;outer left&quot;, meaning a left-winger in either sports or politics).

<text>USS &quot;Chauncey&quot; (DD-667) was a of the United States Navy, the third Navy ship named for Commodore Isaac Chauncey (1779–1840).

&quot;Chauncey&quot; was launched 28 March 1943 by Federal Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, Kearny, New Jersey; sponsored by Mrs. R. K. Anderson; and commissioned 31 May 1943.

==Service history==

===World War II===
Clearing Norfolk, Virginia, 28 August 1943, &quot;Chauncey&quot; reached Pearl Harbor 19 September. She was assigned to the screen of a fast carrier task force for a punishing series of air strikes on Wake Island 5 and 6 October 1943. While screening the carriers, &quot;Chauncey&quot; rescued three downed aviators from the water. After a brief return to Pearl Harbor, &quot;Chauncey&quot; sailed with another carrier task force for Espiritu Santo, arriving 6 November 1943.

The destroyer sailed 3 days later for the air raids on Rabaul of 11 November, in coordination with the Bougainville landings. After the first successful strike launched by the carriers, enemy planes came swarming out to seek vengeance, and a furious 46-minute action, during which &quot;Chauncey&quot;″s guns blazed almost continuously, resulted in a large number of splashed Japanese aircraft. Chauncey, continuing to screen the same carrier force, now sailed north to begin the preassault air strikes on Tarawa, 18, 19, and 20 November. As the landings began on 20 November, the carriers launched combat air patrol, antisubmarine searches, and close support strikes, which continued until the island was secured after furious fighting ashore. During this operation, &quot;Chauncey&quot; again helped drive a Japanese counterattack from the air above the ships she guarded.

With the Marshall Islands operation scheduled for the next month, &quot;Chauncey&quot;″s force was assigned a strike at Kwajalein, center of Japanese air power in the Marshalls, and the shipping in its harbor. Air strikes were launched 4 December 1943 at Kwajalein and Wotje, but Japanese retaliation came in the evening, and &quot;Chauncey&quot; joined in the fire which splashed many enemy planes and drove them away just after midnight. Her task force sailed on to replenish and repair at Pearl Harbor. Bound for action once more, &quot;Chauncey&quot; sailed to Funafuti, where she made rendezvous with a seaplane tender whom she and another destroyer escorted up to Tarawa. After brief patrol duty there, she returned to Funafuti to prepare for the next operation, Majuro.

&quot;Chauncey&quot; sailed on 22 January 1944 to screen escort carriers north to Majuro, assaulted on 30 January. The destroyer screened and patrolled at Majuro and Kwajalein during the assault and occupation of the atolls, and in mid-March returned to the South Pacific. After 10 days early in April on watchful patrol off newly occupied Emirau Island, &quot;Chauncey&quot; screened escort carriers into position to cover the Aitape landings 22 April, and guarded them as they provided close air support, sailed north to replenish at Manus on 28 April, and returned to their covering strikes off New Guinea until 12 May.

Now &quot;Chauncey&quot; was assigned to guard the escort carriers assembling and rehearsing for the Marianas operation, and on 8 June 1944, arrived at Kwajalein for final preparations. She got underway two days later to screen carriers supporting the landings on Saipan with preassault raids on 13 and 14 June, and air cover during the assault on 15 June. Next day &quot;Chauncey&quot; joined the group operating off Guam for bombardments and air strikes, and her guns aided in driving off enemy air attacks on the 16th and 17th. Returning to Saipan, she screened carriers there until the 25th, when she got underway to escort transports to Eniwetok. She returned to operate with the carriers off Saipan and Guam from early July, and on 9 July began her part in the continuous bombardment of Guam before the landings there 21 July.

&quot;Chauncey&quot; continued to screen carriers covering operations on Guam through July, aside from an escort voyage to Eniwetok with unladen transports, and on 10 August, left Guam eastern bound for Eniwetok and repairs at Pearl Harbor. She returned to Manus to prepare for the massive Philippine operation, and on 14 October sailed for Leyte guarding the Southern Attack Force transports. She offered close-in protection during the landings on 20 October, and that night patrolled watchfully around the transports, which remained dangerously close to shore in order to speed their unloading. On 22 October, two days before the opening of the decisive Battle of Leyte Gulf, &quot;Chauncey&quot; cleared to escort unloaded ships to Manus, from which she made two voyages to escort ships to Leyte and Palau during November.

After overhaul and training off the west coast until late February 1945, the destroyer returned to Pearl Harbor. Here she was joined by a carrier, whom she escorted to Ulithi, where &quot;Chauncey&quot; was assigned to mighty Task Force 58 for the preliminaries to the Okinawa operation. The force got underway 14 March for strikes on airfields on Kyūshū and shipping in the Inland Sea and at Kure and Kobe, &quot;Chauncey&quot; and other destroyers providing the essential screening services. Japanese retaliation came in a bombing raid on 19 March, when carrier was badly damaged but kept afloat by her crew&#x27;s heroic work. &quot;Chauncey&quot; moved in to protect the stricken giant, and to guard her as she was towed and later steamed under her own power toward safety. Japanese air attacks were beaten off once more on the 20th and 21st, &quot;Chauncey&quot; firing with the others to splash many enemy planes.

Her force launched prelanding strikes at Okinawa and nearby islands, and after the landings on 1 April 1945, supported the ground forces and protected the transports. &quot;Chauncey&quot; continued her screening, and from 6 April, when the first great &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks were hurled at American shipping off Okinawa, fired often to drive the would-be suicides off. She also served in shore bombardment and radar picket duty until 29 May, when she sailed for repairs and replenishment in San Pedro Bay, Philippine Islands. She then joined Task Force 38 for the final smashing air raids on Japan.

Following the war, &quot;Chauncey&quot; remained in the Far East on occupation duty until 11 November, when she cleared Tsingtao, China for the west coast. She was placed out of commission in reserve at San Diego 19 December 1945.

===Korean War===

Upon the outbreak of the Korean War, &quot;Chauncey&quot; was recommissioned 18 July 1950, and on 1 November, sailed to join the Atlantic Fleet. &quot;Chauncey&quot; operated from her home port at Norfolk, Virginia, along the east coast, and in the Caribbean, until 10 January 1953, when she got underway for the west coast on the first leg of a round-the-world voyage. Reaching Sasebo, Japan, 11 February, &quot;Chauncey&quot; screened the carriers of TF 77 off Korea during the final months preceding the Korean Armistice, and in June sailed on to call at Hong Kong, Singapore, Colombo, Aden, Athens, Naples, Cannes, and Gibraltar before her return to Norfolk 6 August.

&quot;Chauncey&quot; resumed her east coast and Caribbean operations until 14 May 1954, when she was again decommissioned and placed in reserve.

==Awards==
&quot;Chauncey&quot; received seven battle stars for World War II service, and two for Korean service.

<text>David Jay Grisman (born March 23, 1945) is an American mandolinist. His music combines bluegrass, folk, and jazz in a genre he calls &quot;Dawg music&quot;. He founded the record label Acoustic Disc, which issues his recordings and those of other acoustic musicians. He was inducted into the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame in 2023.

==Biography==
Grisman grew up in a Conservative Jewish household in Passaic, New Jersey. His father was a professional trombonist who gave him piano lessons when he was seven years old. As a teenager, he played piano, mandolin, and saxophone.

In the early 1960s, he attended New York University. He belonged to the Even Dozen Jug Band with Maria Muldaur and John Sebastian. He played in the bluegrass band the Kentuckians led by Red Allen, then in the psychedelic rock band Earth Opera with Peter Rowan. He moved to San Francisco, met Jerry Garcia, and appeared on the Grateful Dead album &quot;American Beauty&quot;. He played in Garcia&#x27;s bluegrass band Old &amp; In the Way with Peter Rowan and Vassar Clements. When Grisman was 17 years old, he was invited on stage by Doc Watson to join him on mandolin for a rendition of “In the Pines”.

Garcia named him &quot;Dawg&quot; after a dog that was following him while they were driving in Stinson Beach, California.
&quot;Dawg Music&quot; is what Grisman calls his mixture of bluegrass and Django Reinhardt/Stéphane Grappelli-influenced jazz as highlighted on his album &quot;Hot Dawg&quot; (recorded Oct. 1978, released 1979). It was Grisman&#x27;s combination of Reinhardt-era jazz, bluegrass, folk, Old World Mediterranean string band music, as well as modern jazz fusion that came to embody &quot;Dawg&quot; music.

In the 1970s, he started the David Grisman Quintet with Darol Anger, Joe Carroll, Todd Phillips, and Tony Rice. They released their eponymous first album in 1977 for Kaleidoscope Records and their second, &quot;Hot Dawg&quot;, two years later for Horizon Records, the jazz division of A&amp;M Records. When the quintet recorded for Warner Bros. Records, the membership changed to include Mike Marshall, Mark O&#x27;Connor, and Rob Wasserman, with occasional guest appearances by jazz violinist Stéphane Grappelli.

In the 1980s, Grisman formed the record label Acoustic Disc, which issued his recordings and those by other acoustic musicians. The folk and bluegrass part of his personality emerged when he recorded with Mark O&#x27;Connor, Tony Rice, and Andy Statman.

==Family==
Grisman is married to Tracy Bigelow and was married twice before. He has three grown children: Samson, Gillian, and Monroe. Samson, a bassist and recording session musician living in Portland, often performs with his father. Gillian, a filmmaker living in Novato, California, directed &quot;Grateful Dawg&quot; and the music documentary, &quot;Village Music: Last of the Great Record Stores&quot;.

Monroe Grisman, named for bluegrass music pioneer Bill Monroe, lives in Fairfax, California, and plays in the Tom Petty tribute band Petty Theft.
==In media==

Grisman&#x27;s song &quot;Dawggy Mountain Breakdown&quot; was the opening theme song for &quot;Car Talk&quot; on NPR.

Grisman sued YouTube in May 2007, asserting in federal court that YouTube should be required to prevent individuals from illegally uploading recordings of his music. Grisman&#x27;s attorneys requested voluntary dismissal of the suit.

The documentary &quot;Grateful Dawg&quot; (October 14, 2001) chronicles the friendship between Jerry Garcia and David Grisman.

Grisman was a judge for the 6th and 7th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists.

He wrote much of the bluegrass music for the 1974 film &quot;Big Bad Mama&quot; directed by Roger Corman. It was played by the Great American Music Band, and they were recorded and mixed by Bill Wolf.

==Discography==
==Acoustic Disc==
Acoustic Disc is an independent record label founded by Grisman in 1990. The label is based in San Rafael, California, and specializes in bluegrass, folk, jazz, and Dawg music.

<doc id="668022" wikidata="Q926135" url="?curid=668022" title="Isaac Chauncey">
<text>Isaac Chauncey (February 20, 1772 – January 27, 1840) was a United States Navy officer who served in the Quasi-War, the Barbary Wars and the War of 1812. In the latter part of his naval career he was President of the Board of Navy Commissioners.

==Involvement in the Quasi-War and First Barbary War==
Chauncey, born in Black Rock, Connecticut, to Wolcott Chauncy and Ann Brown. His father was the great-great-grandson of Charles Chauncy, the 2nd President of Harvard College. At 19, he was given the command of the ship Jenny, belonging to Peter Schermerhorn, grandfather of Mrs. Astor, and was appointed a lieutenant in the Navy from September 17, 1798. He fought with gallantry in the West Indies during the Quasi-War with France. In a letter dated 21 July, 1802 he was ordered to take command of General Greene for an anticipated deployment to the Mediterranean during the First Barbary War. In a letter dated 13 August the order was rescinded and he and her crew were transferred to USS New York. He served in the Mediterranean during the First Barbary War; and commanded &quot;John Adams&quot; (1804–5), &quot;Hornet&quot; (1805–6), &quot;Washington&quot; and the Mediterranean Squadron (1815–1820). He was promoted to captain in 1806.

==War of 1812==

Perhaps his most outstanding service was during the War of 1812 when he commanded American naval forces on Lake Ontario, conducting amphibious operations in cooperation with the United States Army and trying to counter a Royal Navy force under the command of Sir James Yeo stationed there. He also served twice as commandant of the New York Naval Shipyard. Isaac Chauncey played a prominent role in the creation of the navy yard. His service there, began prior to its official designation as a shipyard.

===Raiding British shipment===
On November 6, 1812, Commodore Isaac Chauncey set out on a raiding expedition to intercept the enemy vessels on their return from Fort George to Kingston. The enemy&#x27;s force was the &quot;Royal George&quot;, 26 guns, 260 men; the &quot;Earl of Moira&quot;, 18 guns, 200 men; the &quot;Prince Regent&quot;, 18 guns, 150 men; the &quot;Duke of Gloucester&quot;, 14 guns, 80 men; the &quot;Simcoe&quot; 12 guns, 76 men; and the &quot;Seneca&quot;, 4 guns, 40 men. On November 8, Commodore Chauncey fell in with the &quot;Royal George&quot; and chased her into the Bay of Quinte. On the morning of Nov. 10th he took a small schooner and burnt it, and chased the &quot;Royal George&quot; into Kingston harbor, and engaged her batteries for an hour and forty-five minutes, but stood off with night coming up. The American loss in this engagement was one killed and three wounded. The next morning, with winds too strong to attack, he turned out and soon came upon the &quot;Simcoe&quot;. They chased her over a reef of rocks and severely disabled her with shot. Commodore Chauncey returned to Sackets Harbor on the 12th of November with three captured British trading schooners.

===Raids the following week===
In the following week, Commadore Chaunceys fleet made two short cruises and captured three vessels. Two of the vessels were brought into Sackets Harbor and the third was burnt and sunk.

===First Raid on York===

Commodore Chauncey was the commander of the American fleet transporting 1,700 American Regulars with Benjamin Forsyth&#x27;s Riflemen leading the way. The American raiding force landed on the beach and routed opposing British forces, who suffered several casualties and retreated from the field. The Americans occupied York for a while looting and burning private property. Then all of the Americans boarded Chauncey&#x27;s vessels and the entire American raiding force withdrew safely.

===Raid on Burlington Heights===
From around July 30, 1813, to July 31, 1813. Commodore Chauncey with his fleet arrived near Burlington Heights from Niagara during the morning. A force of several hundred troops, including sailors and U.S. Marines, under Lt. Colonel Winfield Scott, debarked. About 150 British troops under Major Maule put up stiff resistance. The Americans seized some prisoners (civilians, possibly militia in the town) and returned to the ships. The American fleet then departed.

===Second Raid on York===

One of his most successful operations was taking part of a naval raid by transporting Winfield Scott&#x27;s force of raiders in the successful raid at York, Upper Canada from July 31, 1813 – August 1, 1813. Isaac Chauncey transported Winfield&#x27;s American raiding force of 340-500 men to York. The American raiders freed prisoners in jail, made wounded soldiers their captives (on paper), and confiscated British military baggage left there and whatever else they could find. The next day, the American raiders found a hidden bateau and carted off 400 barrels of food. The Americans also took 11 bateaux, 5 cannons, and some flour. Winfield and his American force of raiders set fire to barracks, a wood yard, and a storehouse on Gibraltar Point. Winfield and his force of American raiders withdrew safely aboard Chauncey&#x27;s ships. The American raiders destroyed some artillery and boats, confiscated supplies and ammunition, and all withdrew back to New York.

===Raid on Lake Ontario===

Around October 5, 1813, Chauncey was sailing with his squadron and spotted some British vessels sail on Lake Ontario. Chauncey pursued the British ships, which consisted of seven gunboats being used as troops transports. Chauncey&#x27;s squadron captured five gunboats and destroyed one. The remaining gunboat escaped. 260 enemy soldiers were captured. Isaac Chauncey and his fleet withdrew back to Sacket&#x27;s Harbor with the captured ships and 260 prisoners of war.

==Further career==
Chauncey went on to be Brooklyn&#x27;s longest serving commandant July 13, 1807 – May 16, 1813, and again December 21, 1824 – June 10, 1833. His letters to the Secretary of the Navy provide perhaps the fullest picture and most candid portrait by a career naval officer of the early yard. These letters deliver rich detail about the officers and employees, and the problems he encountered making the new yard a viable concern.

Writing November 27, 1807, to the Secretary of the Navy, Chauncey pleads for maintenance funds – &quot;The following things are almost indispensable to promote the public service and for the accommodation of the yard. Two wells to be sunk, in the yard, with pumps in them, windows in the armory, a horse &amp; cart to transport stores, fill holes about the wharf &amp;c &amp;c The tide ebbs &amp; flows in 24 hours consequently leaving a dampness that must destroy the timber next to the ground very soon There is sufficient for the horse in the yard Six wheel barrows with more other little conveniences which I will hope you will leave to my discretion I will not abuse you&#x27;re your confidence.&quot;

Commodore Chauncey was particularly tough when negotiating wages. Writing on January 5, 1808, to Secretary of the Navy Robert Smith he explained &quot;Some of them (in consequence of Mr. Buckland having mentioned publicly that twenty three gun boats was to be built) immediately had an idea that we could not do without them and would not go to work.

I however was able to find a sufficient number willing to work at the reduced wages and these who refused will in a week come back and beg for work and I shall be able to reduce their wages 25 cents more for the merchants have no work for them to do therefore they must either work for us at our price or go unemployed.&quot;

In May 1829, while in command of the shipyard, Chauncey led a series of searches for the body of George Washington Adams, who committed suicide by jumping from the deck of the steamship &quot;Benjamin Franklin&quot;.

In December 1835 Chauncey led navy yard marines and sailors in suppressing the Great Fire of New York by blowing up buildings in the fire&#x27;s path.

His last service was as member, and, for four years, President, of the Board of Navy Commissioners. Commodore Chauncey died in Washington, on January 27, 1840.

<text>General of the Armies of the United States, more commonly referred to as General of the Armies, is the highest military rank in the United States. The rank has been conferred three times: to John J. Pershing in 1919, as a personal accolade for his command of the American Expeditionary Forces during World War I; to George Washington in 1976, as a posthumous honor during the United States Bicentennial celebrations; and posthumously to victorious Civil War commander Ulysses S. Grant in 2024.

The grade is sometimes described as a six-star general, as being senior to the five-star grade of General of the Army, but no six-star insignia was ever officially created and Pershing, the only person to be General of the Armies during his own lifetime, never wore more than four stars. Whether Pershing&#x27;s grade should rank as four, five, or six stars has been a subject of debate ever since the five-star grades were created in 1944. To make Washington unambiguously the highest ranking Army officer in 1976, Congress specified that his new grade of General of the Armies ranked above all other grades of the Army, past or present, while the law authorizing Grant&#x27;s promotion made his rank in parity with Pershing&#x27;s rank.

The General of the Armies enjoyed several privileges not afforded to other generals, including a much higher salary and the right to retire at full pay and allowances. Even in retirement, Pershing—the only-ever living person with the rank—was the second-highest-paid official in the federal government, after only the president of the United States.

==History==
===Origin===
====Attempt to appoint Washington====

The office of &quot;General of the Armies of the United States&quot; was created by an Act of Congress on March 3, 1799, which stated:

The law was intended to elevate George Washington, who was then a lieutenant general commanding the provisional army being organized to fight the Quasi-War against France, but President John Adams never made the appointment, concerned it would infringe on the president&#x27;s constitutional function as &quot;commander-in-chief of the armed forces&quot;. Washington died on December 14, 1799, and the grade lapsed on March 16, 1802, when not mentioned in the law that defined the peacetime military establishment.

====American Civil War====
After the American Civil War, Congress honored Ulysses S. Grant for his successful command of the Union Army by authorizing his promotion to the grade of general under the Act of July 25, 1866, which stated:

Despite being titled &quot;General of the Army&quot; instead of &quot;General of the Armies&quot;, the Comptroller General of the United States would rule in 1924 that the grade revived in 1866 for Grant (and later William T. Sherman and Philip H. Sheridan) was the same grade that had been created for Washington in 1799 and revived for Pershing in 1919.

Pershing would inherit several of his unique perquisites as General of the Armies through this legislative continuity with the Grant, Sherman, and Sheridan grade, including a much higher salary than other generals and the right to retire at full pay instead of three-quarters pay.

===John J. Pershing (1919)===

During World War I, Congress authorized the &quot;ex officio&quot; grade of general for the chief of staff of the Army and the commander of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) in France, but only during the wartime emergency. Unlike the 1866 grade, which was a permanent personal appointment, the 1917 grade was only held while occupying a specific office. Army chief of staff Tasker H. Bliss and AEF commander John J. Pershing were commissioned emergency generals on October 8, 1917, with Peyton C. March succeeding Bliss as chief of staff and emergency general on May 20, 1918.

====Attempt to appoint March with Pershing====
When the war ended, Pershing and March were due to lose their emergency grades and revert to major general, so on June 18, 1919, President Woodrow Wilson asked Congress to promote both men to permanent general in a way that gave Pershing precedence over March. Six weeks later, the House Military Affairs Committee reported out two bills authorizing Pershing and March to each be appointed General of the Armies. To ensure that Pershing would outrank March, Pershing&#x27;s bill also repealed the 1917 law that gave the Army chief of staff precedence over all other Army officers.

Congress and Pershing both opposed March&#x27;s promotion, having clashed with him during the war, so March&#x27;s bill did not pass and he reverted to major general. He was later advanced to general on the retired list.

====Pershing appointment====

On September 3, 1919, President Wilson signed , providing:

The bill had been rushed through Congress in only two days so that Secretary of War Newton D. Baker could hand Pershing his new commission as soon as he arrived from France on September 8, when his emergency grade would expire.

In the haste to promote Pershing, Wilson accidentally nominated him to be a general in the Army instead of a General of the Armies, a difference that could have cost Pershing half his income when he retired.

Official Army publications subsequently took care to spell out Pershing&#x27;s title as General of the Armies, as distinct from the emergency generals of 1917 and the rank of general that was held by the chief of staff of the Army after 1929. In 1928, Secretary of War Dwight F. Davis even increased the 17-gun salute authorized for a General of the Armies to the 19 guns of a European field marshal.

====Continued privileges during retirement====

Pershing transferred to the retired list on September 12, 1924, but continued to draw full pay and allowances, a privilege not granted to other generals.

Even after retiring, the General of the Armies maintained a spacious office in the old State, War, and Navy Building until it was relocated to the Pentagon in 1947, years after ill health had permanently confined Pershing to Walter Reed General Hospital. In 1939, Congress created the office of military secretary to the General of the Armies with the rank of colonel so Pershing&#x27;s longtime aide, Captain George E. Adamson, could continue to manage Pershing&#x27;s affairs after his own retirement.

===World War II===
There were several attempts to appoint senior World War II officers as Generals of the Armies, but none came to fruition.

====Attempts to appoint Marshall and Arnold====

In August 1943, Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Ernest J. King increased his efforts to create a grade higher than four stars after being outranked by his British counterpart at the First Quebec Conference. The Navy could even be outranked by the Army if Pershing died and Army chief of staff George C. Marshall inherited his title of General of the Armies with its &quot;de facto&quot; five-star rank, as retired CNO William V. Pratt warned King in January 1944.

Marshall opposed any higher grade, saying he did not need one. King and Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson both suspected that as Pershing&#x27;s longtime protégé, Marshall would resist any rank equivalent to General of the Armies while his mentor was still alive. Stimson did ask President Franklin D. Roosevelt to appoint Marshall as General of the Armies in September 1943 so he could command the planned invasion of France while remaining chief of staff, but Roosevelt ultimately gave the command to Dwight D. Eisenhower instead.

In February 1944, King&#x27;s lobbying led both houses of Congress to submit bills reviving the grades of General of the Armies and Admiral of the Navy. King wanted the American Joint Chiefs of Staff to rank with the British field marshals on the Combined Chiefs of Staff, raising both Marshall and Army Air Forces commander Henry H. Arnold to five-star General of the Armies. However, House Naval Affairs Committee chairman Carl Vinson wanted King and Marshall to have even higher rank, so the House bills inserted a five-star fleet admiral below a six-star Admiral of the Navy, which the Army was expected to match with its own five-star grade and a six-star General of the Armies. Even King thought six stars was too much, and public opposition convinced supporters of higher grades to defer legislation until after a successful landing in Europe.

====Creation of five-star grade====

With the invasion of Europe well underway by September 1944, the War Department finally gave its blessing to a five-star grade on condition that it not be called General of the Armies, a title reserved for the higher rank held by Pershing. In a press conference on September 14, 1944, Stimson said:

On December 14, 1944, established the five-star grade of General of the Army, preserving Pershing&#x27;s status as the only General of the Armies and further stating that nothing would change about the 1919 law that had promoted him:

====Six-star debate====

By specifying that nothing about the General of the Armies would be changed by the law that created the five-star grades, Congress intended Pershing to remain the highest-ranking officer in the Army. This sparked a long-running debate over whether Pershing was now a six-star general; the senior five-star general; or even just a four-star general, as later argued by an influential pair of articles by Frederick Bernays Wiener, who pointed out that the 1919 law that revived his office did not actually say that the General of the Armies outranked all other Army officers, but merely repealed a 1917 law that would have let the Army chief of staff outrank him.

For the rest of Pershing&#x27;s life, official publications consistently treated the General of the Armies as being one grade higher than a five-star general. As late as 1951, Army regulations specified 19 guns to salute the General of the Armies, and only 17 guns for a General of the Army.

Pershing himself never wore more than four stars. Army regulations let the General of the Armies design his own uniform, but by the time the five-star grade was created in 1944, Pershing was too infirm to consider updating his insignia. When Pershing died on July 15, 1948, a proposal to bury him in a uniform bearing six stars was rejected in favor of the four stars he had always worn.

====Attempts to appoint MacArthur====

In January 1955, Congressional supporters of General of the Army Douglas MacArthur introduced legislation to appoint him General of the Armies, backdated to his 75th birthday on January 26. The proposal stalled in the House Armed Services Committee after the Defense Department opposed it on the grounds that promoting only MacArthur would downgrade all other five-star officers and &quot;arouse interservice, intraservice and popular misunderstanding and controversies.&quot; Another attempt was still pending in Congress when MacArthur died on April 5, 1964.
Further efforts were made to grant a posthumous promotion to MacArthur following his death.

===George Washington (1976)===
In September 1953, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that because George Washington had never been appointed General of the Armies in 1799, he remained a lieutenant general who was now outranked by 45 other generals, living and dead. Citing this low rank, Senator Edward Martin introduced a bill in April 1954 to appoint Washington posthumously as General of the Armies.

Twenty-two years later, a veterans group in the district of Representative Mario Biaggi observed that Washington had still not been promoted, prompting Biaggi to sponsor a joint resolution to elevate Washington to General of the Armies as part of the United States Bicentennial celebration in 1976.

When the House Armed Services Committee met to consider the resolution, a committee counsel acknowledged that it was still debatable whether Pershing was ever more than a four-star general, but Representative F. Edward Hébert asserted that the language of this resolution did make Washington a six-star general, saying, &quot;We have three grades—general, General of the Army, and this is General of the Armies of the United States.&quot;

Representative Lucien N. Nedzi objected that Washington&#x27;s stature was already so high that giving him a modern Army rank just made Congress look ridiculous. &quot;It&#x27;s like having the Pope offer to make Christ a cardinal.&quot;

====Washington appointment====

Deeming it &quot;fitting and proper that no officer of the United States Army should outrank Lieutenant General George Washington on the Army list,&quot; declared that:

Although President Gerald Ford signed the law on October 11, 1976, no further action was taken to promote Washington until February 1978, when a military driver studying for a promotion board asked his passenger, General Donn A. Starry, whether Washington now outranked Pershing. The specialist five&#x27;s question to a four-star general triggered a chain of inquiries that caused the Department of the Army to issue on March 13, 1978, posthumously promoting Washington to the grade of General of the Armies of the United States, effective from the 200th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1976. When the question was asked again in 1992, the U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry considered Pershing&#x27;s rank to be equivalent to five stars and junior to Washington.

===Ulysses S. Grant (2024)===

In September 2021, joint resolutions authorizing the President to appoint Ulysses S. Grant posthumously to the grade of General of the Armies of the United States were introduced in the House and Senate by a bipartisan Congressional delegation from his home states of Ohio, Missouri, and New York. In a letter to the secretary of defense, three of the bill&#x27;s sponsors argued that by reestablishing the General of the Armies grade with &quot;precedence over all other grades of the Army, past or present,&quot; the 1976 law authorizing Washington&#x27;s promotion had effectively lowered the grade to which Grant was appointed in 1866.

Supporters of Grant&#x27;s promotion hoped the law would pass in time for his 200th birthday on April 27, 2022, the date of rank specified in the bill, which was titled the &quot;Ulysses S. Grant Bicentennial Recognition Act&quot;. The joint resolutions were referred to the House Armed Services Committee and Senate Judiciary Committee, neither of which took any action. Instead, the annual defense policy bill used different language to authorize Grant&#x27;s appointment to the grade of General of the Armies, adding a clause that tied his rank and precedence to that of Pershing.

====Grant authorization====
Section 583 of the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023, signed into law on December 23, 2022, states:
In compliance with the law signed by President Joe Biden, the secretary of defense, Lloyd Austin approved and issued a memorandum to the secretary of the Army to posthumously advance Grant to General of the Armies on April 19, 2024.

==Insignia==
No insignia was ever officially specified for the General of the Armies, who was allowed to define it for himself.

Upon being appointed General of the Armies in 1919, Pershing continued to wear the four silver stars and gold collar eagle that he had selected for his insignia as a general in 1917, when Army regulations authorized generals to prescribe their own shoulder and collar insignia. Pershing and Generals Tasker H. Bliss and Peyton C. March all chose to wear four silver stars on their shoulders, instead of the previous insignia of two silver stars and a gold eagle. Pershing and Bliss also replaced the regulation bronze &quot;U.S.&quot; insignia on their collars with a gold eagle representing the Great Seal of the United States.

In 1937, Pershing created a custom full dress uniform to attend the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, denoting his rank with four gold stars embroidered on each sleeve. Full dress uniforms for other general officers used silver stars, including the custom uniform that Army chief of staff Malin Craig designed for himself the following year.

Because the General of the Armies prescribed his own insignia, later tradition held that Pershing could have worn as many stars as he wanted. Claimed one expert in 1976, &quot;if a General of the Armies wants to wear six stars, he can. Or seven. Or 10, I guess.&quot; The creation of the five-star grades in 1944 led to suggestions that Pershing clarify his seniority by adopting a six-star insignia, but by then he was too ill. When Pershing died in 1948, funeral planners considered affixing a six-star insignia to his uniform, but instead buried him with the four stars he wore in life.

==Special privileges==
===Compensation===
As General of the Armies, Pershing was paid much more than other generals. The 1919 law that promoted Pershing gave the General of the Armies the same annual pay of that was set in 1870 for General William T. Sherman, plus in allowances.

All other generals fell under the Joint Service Pay Readjustment Act of 1922, which set the pay for a major general at . Higher ranks had the same pay as a major general plus a personal money allowance of for a lieutenant general, for a general, or for a general of the Army. Including food and housing, the annual compensation for a general of the Army in December 1944 was , versus for the General of the Armies (respectively equivalent to $ and $ in ).

===Retirement===
The General of the Armies retired with full pay and allowances, another benefit created for Sherman and inherited by Pershing, who continued to receive $21,500 for the rest of his life. Even in retirement, he drew a higher annual compensation than any other official in the federal government except the president of the United States.

Other generals retired at three-quarters pay and no allowances. When Army chief of staff Charles P. Summerall retired in 1931, his annual compensation fell to only $6,000, three-quarters of a major general&#x27;s pay.

===Uniform===
Starting in 1933, the General of the Armies was allowed to design his own uniform, as were current and former Army chiefs of staff. Pershing used this authority to create the unique uniform he wore to the 1937 coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, styled after the full dress uniform introduced by the Army in 1902 but discontinued in 1917. Whereas the 1902 uniform portrayed the rank of a general officer by embroidering silver stars on each sleeve, Pershing&#x27;s 1937 uniform sleeves bore four gold stars. When Army chief of staff Malin Craig designed his own custom uniform in 1938, he returned to the usual silver stars.

Pershing&#x27;s estate donated his General of the Armies uniforms to the Smithsonian Institution, including the 1921 service coat with four silver stars that he wore as Army chief of staff and the 1937 full dress coat with four gold stars that he wore to the coronation.

==Equivalence with Admiral of the Navy==

On March 2, 1899, Congress created the grade of Admiral of the Navy to honor George Dewey for his victory at the Battle of Manila Bay. Only Dewey ever held this grade, which is often treated as the United States Navy equivalent of General of the Armies, although the two grades never overlapped since Dewey died on January 16, 1917, two years before Pershing&#x27;s appointment.

Admiral of the Navy and General of the Armies were permanent grades awarded as personal accolades for past service, unlike the later &quot;ex officio&quot; ranks of admiral and general. Both grades carried the same annual pay of $13,500 for life, and the proposal to create more Admirals of the Navy in 1944 continued to tie their compensation to the General of the Armies.

After Dewey was mistakenly nominated to be an admiral in the Navy instead of Admiral of the Navy in 1899 and had to be renominated in 1903, the Navy carefully distinguished between Dewey&#x27;s grade and the rank of admiral that was held by the three fleet commanders from 1915, and the Chief of Naval Operations from 1916. The Army took similar care to distinguish between Pershing&#x27;s grade and the rank of general held by the chief of staff of the Army from 1929, after Pershing was mistakenly nominated to be a general in the Army instead of General of the Armies in 1919.

Because Dewey and Pershing were both treated as if they held grades higher than admiral or general, before World War II they were sometimes thought to be on par with a British admiral of the fleet or field marshal. When the five-star grades were created in 1944, the initial legislation called them Admiral of the Navy and General of the Armies. However, House Naval Affairs Committee chairman Carl Vinson inserted a five-star fleet admiral below Admiral of the Navy, which he wanted to be a six-star grade. Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson then required that the five-star Army grade not be called General of the Armies, which he thought was also a higher rank.

Although the 1944 proposal to create six-star grades was dropped, Army and Navy regulations in 1951 still authorized only 17 guns to salute a five-star officer, and 19 guns for an Admiral of the Navy or General of the Armies.

<text>José Ortega y Gasset (; ; 9 May 1883 – 18 October 1955) was a Spanish philosopher and essayist. He worked during the first half of the 20th century while Spain oscillated between monarchy, republicanism, and dictatorship. His philosophy has been characterized as a &quot;philosophy of life&quot; that &quot;comprised a long-hidden beginning in a pragmatist metaphysics inspired by William James, and with a general method from a realist phenomenology imitating Edmund Husserl, which served both his proto-existentialism (prior to Martin Heidegger&#x27;s) and his realist historicism, which has been compared to both Wilhelm Dilthey and Benedetto Croce.&quot; 

==Biography==
José Ortega y Gasset was born 9 May 1883 in Madrid. His father was director of the newspaper &quot;El Imparcial&quot;, which belonged to the family of his mother, Dolores Gasset. The family was definitively of Spain&#x27;s end-of-the-century liberal and educated bourgeoisie. The liberal tradition and journalistic engagement of his family had a profound influence in Ortega y Gasset&#x27;s activism in politics.

Ortega was first schooled by the Jesuit priests of St. Stanislaus Kostka College, Málaga, Málaga (1891–1897). He attended the University of Deusto, Bilbao (1897–98) and the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters at the Central University of Madrid (now Complutense University of Madrid) (1898–1904), receiving a doctorate in Philosophy. From 1905 to 1907, he continued his studies in Germany at Leipzig, Nuremberg, Cologne, Berlin and, above all Marburg. At Marburg, he was influenced by the neo-Kantianism of Hermann Cohen and Paul Natorp, among others.

On his return to Spain in 1908, he was appointed professor of Philosophy, Logic and Ethics at the Escuela Superior del Magisterio de Madrid. In 1910, he married Rosa Spottorno Topete, a Spanish translator and feminist, and was named full professor of Metaphysics at Complutense University of Madrid, a vacant seat previously held by Nicolás Salmerón.

In 1917 he became a contributor to the newspaper &quot;El Sol&quot;, where he published, as a series of essays, his two principal works: &quot;España invertebrada&quot; (&quot;Invertebrate Spain&quot;) and &quot;La rebelión de las masas&quot; (&quot;The Revolt of the Masses&quot;). The latter made him internationally famous. He founded the &quot;Revista de Occidente&quot; in 1923, remaining its director until 1936. This publication promoted translation of (and commentary upon) the most important figures and tendencies in philosophy, including Oswald Spengler, Johan Huizinga, Edmund Husserl, Georg Simmel, Jakob von Uexküll, Heinz Heimsoeth, Franz Brentano, Hans Driesch, Ernst Müller, Alexander Pfänder, and Bertrand Russell.

Elected deputy for the Province of León in the constituent assembly of the Second Spanish Republic, he was the leader of a parliamentary group of intellectuals known as &quot;Agrupación al Servicio de la República&quot; (&quot;The Grouping at the Service of the Republic&quot;), which supported the platform of Socialist Republican candidates, but he soon abandoned politics, disappointed.

Leaving Spain at the outbreak of the Civil War, he spent years of exile in Buenos Aires, Argentina until moving back to Europe in 1942. He settled in Portugal by mid-1945 and slowly began to make short visits to Spain. In 1948 he returned to Madrid, where he founded the Institute of Humanities, at which he lectured. Upon his return to Spain, he often privately expressed his hostility to the Franco regime, stating that the government did not deserve anyone&#x27;s confidence and that his beliefs were &quot;incompatible with Franco.&quot;

==Philosophy==
===Liberalism===
&quot;The Revolt of the Masses&quot; is Ortega&#x27;s best known work. In this book he defends the values of meritocratic liberalism reminiscent of John Stuart Mill against attacks from both communists and right-wing populists. Ortega likewise shares Mill&#x27;s fears of the &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot; and the &quot;collective mediocrity&quot; of the masses, which he believes threaten individuality, free thought, and protections for minorities. Ortega characterized liberalism as a politics of &quot;magnanimity.&quot;

Ortega&#x27;s rejection of the Spanish Conservative Party under Antonio Cánovas del Castillo and his successors was unequivocal, as was his distrust of the Spanish monarchy and Catholic Church. Yet, Ortega&#x27;s political thought has been characterized as anti-democratic and conservative, and his work &quot;The Revolt of the Masses&quot; is widely regarded as a conservative classic.

Ortega wrote about education, focusing broadly on the overarching goals of learning, on university reform, types of pedagogy, and the need to empower individuals to seek self-improvement throughout their lives. His philosophy of education balanced progressive and conservative elements. Central to his thought was an advocacy of the Socratic teaching methods that were central to his vision. 

In a manner similar to Mill, Ortega was open-minded toward certain socialists and non-Marxist forms of socialism, and even complimented Pablo Iglesias Posse as a &quot;lay saint&quot;. Under the influence of German social democrats, such as Paul Natorp and Hermann Cohen, he adopted a communitarian ontology and could be critical of capitalism, particularly the laissez-faire variant, declaring that &quot;nineteenth-century capitalism has demoralized humanity&quot; and that it had &quot;impoverished the ethical consciousness of man.&quot;

===&quot;Yo soy yo y mi circunstancia&quot;===

For Ortega y Gasset, philosophy has a critical duty to lay siege to beliefs in order to promote new ideas and to explain reality. To accomplish such tasks, the philosopher must—as Husserl proposed—leave behind prejudices and previously existing beliefs, and investigate the essential reality of the universe. Ortega y Gasset proposes that philosophy must overcome the limitations of both idealism (in which reality centers around the ego) and ancient-medieval realism (in which reality is outside the subject) to focus on the only truthful reality: &quot;my life&quot;—the life of each individual. He suggests that there is no &quot;me&quot; without things, and things are nothing without me: &quot;I&quot; (human being) cannot be detached from &quot;my circumstance&quot; (world). This led Ortega y Gasset to pronounce his famous maxim &quot;Yo soy yo y mi circunstancia&quot; (&quot;I am me and my circumstance&quot;) (&quot;Meditaciones del Quijote&quot;, 1914) which he always put at the core of his philosophy.

For Ortega y Gasset, as for Husserl, the Cartesian &#x27;cogito ergo sum&#x27; is insufficient to explain reality. Therefore, the Spanish philosopher proposes a system wherein the basic or &quot;radical&quot; reality is &quot;my life&quot; (the first &quot;yo&quot;), which consists of &quot;I&quot; (the second &quot;yo&quot;) and &quot;my circumstance&quot; (&quot;mi circunstancia&quot;). This &quot;circunstancia&quot; is oppressive; therefore, there is a continual dialectical interaction between the person and his or her circumstances and, as a result, life is a drama that exists between necessity and freedom.

In this sense Ortega y Gasset wrote that life is at the same time fate and freedom, and that freedom &quot;is being free inside of a given fate. Fate gives us an inexorable repertory of determinate possibilities, that is, it gives us different destinies. We accept fate and within it we choose one destiny.&quot; In this tied down fate we must therefore be active, decide and create a &quot;project of life&quot;—thus not be like those who live a conventional life of customs and given structures who prefer an unconcerned and imperturbable life because they are afraid of the duty of choosing a project.

===Ratiovitalism===
With a philosophical system that centered around life, Ortega y Gasset also stepped out of Descartes&#x27; &quot;cogito ergo sum&quot; and asserted &quot;I live therefore I think&quot;. This stood at the root of his Kantian-inspired perspectivism, which he developed by adding a non-relativistic character in which absolute truth does exist and would be obtained by the sum of all perspectives of all lives, since for each human being life takes a concrete form and life itself is a true radical reality from which any philosophical system must derive. In this sense, Ortega coined the terms &quot;vital reason&quot; (, &quot;reason with life as its foundation&quot;) to refer to a new type of reason that constantly defends the life from which it has surged and &quot;ratiovitalism&quot; (), a theory that based knowledge in the radical reality of life, one of whose essential components is reason itself. This system of thought, which he introduces in &quot;History as System&quot;, escaped from Nietzsche&#x27;s vitalism in which life responded to impulses; for Ortega, reason is crucial to create and develop the above-mentioned project of life.

===Historical reason===
For Ortega y Gasset, vital reason is also &quot;historical reason&quot;, for individuals and societies are not detached from their past. In order to understand a reality we must understand, as Dilthey pointed out, its history.

==Influence==
Ortega y Gasset&#x27;s influence was considerable, not only because many sympathized with his philosophical writings, but also because those writings did not require that the reader be well-versed in technical philosophy.

Among those strongly influenced by Ortega y Gasset were Luis Buñuel, , , Xavier Zubiri, Ignacio Ellacuría, Emilio Komar, José Gaos, Luis Recasens, , Francisco Ayala, María Zambrano, , Máximo Etchecopar, Pedro Laín Entralgo, , Julián Marías, John Lukacs, Pierre Bourdieu, , Vicente Ferreira da Silva, Vilém Flusser and Félix Martí Ibáñez.

The Ortega hypothesis, based on a quote in &quot;The Revolt of the Masses&quot;, states that average or mediocre scientists contribute substantially to the advancement of science.

German grape breeder Hans Breider named the grape variety Ortega in his honor.

The American philosopher Graham Harman has recognized Ortega y Gasset as a source of inspiration for his own object-oriented ontology.

&quot;La rebelión de las masas&quot; (&quot;The Revolt of the Masses&quot;) has been translated into English twice. The first, in 1932, is by a translator who wanted to remain anonymous, generally accepted to be J.R. Carey.
The second translation was published by the University of Notre Dame Press in 1985, in association with W.W. Norton &amp; Co. This translation was by Anthony Kerrigan (translator) and Kenneth Moore (editor), with an introduction by Saul Bellow.

Mildred Adams is the translator (into English) of the main body of Ortega&#x27;s work, including &quot;Invertebrate Spain&quot;, &quot;Man and Crisis&quot;, &quot;What is Philosophy?&quot;, &quot;Some Lessons in Metaphysics&quot;, &quot;The Idea of Principle in Leibniz and the Evolution of Deductive Theory&quot;, and &quot;An Interpretation of Universal History&quot;.

===Madrid School===
The Madrid School (also School of Madrid; ) was a group of philosophers, the members of which were students of Ortega y Gasset, who share an intellectual tradition of arguing against naturalism and positivism. Members included José Gaos, Julián Marías, and Xavier Zubiri.

===Influence on the Generation of &#x27;27===
Ortega y Gasset had considerable influence on writers of the Generation of &#x27;27, a group of poets that arose in Spanish literature in the 1920s.

<text>Legionowo County () is a unit of territorial administration and local government (powiat) in Masovian Voivodeship, east-central Poland. It came into being on 1 January 1999 as a result of the Polish local government reforms passed in 1998. Its administrative seat and largest town is Legionowo, which lies north of Warsaw. The only other town in the county is Serock, lying north-east of Legionowo.

The county covers an area of . As of 2019, its total population is 106,321, out of which the population of Legionowo is 54,049, that of Serock is 4,506, and the rural population is 47,766.

Legionowo is part of the greater Warsaw area and has a large commuter population. The train connection takes about 30 mins to central Warsaw (connection to Warsaw Metro at Warszawa Gdańska station) and is planned to be added to the Warsaw Rapid Train system by 2010. Both the road and the train connection pass through the national reserve forest which separates Legionowo from Warsaw and is a favorite weekend walk and biking destination. On the opposite side of Legionowo is the Zegrze Reservoir, created in 1970 with the building of a river dam, now a popular leisure destination.

The village of Jabłonna, between Legionowo and Warsaw, housed the largest population of private production and greenhouse businesses in communist times, making the village the richest in Poland at that time and continuing to this day in the form of a thriving business community.

Legionowo is also famous throughout Poland for its police training college.

==Neighbouring counties==
Legionowo County is bordered by Pułtusk County to the north, Wyszków County and Wołomin County to the east, the city of Warsaw and Warsaw West County to the south, and Nowy Dwór County to the west.

==Administrative division==
The county is subdivided into five gminas (one urban, one urban-rural and three rural). These are listed in the following table, in descending order of population.

<text>Ghassan Fayiz Kanafani (; 8 April 1936 – 8 July 1972) was a prominent Palestinian author and politician, considered to be a leading novelist of his generation and one of the Arab world&#x27;s leading Palestinian writers. Kanafani&#x27;s works have been translated into more than 17 languages.

Kanafani was born in Acre, Mandatory Palestine in 1936. During the 1948 Palestine war, his family was forced out of their hometown by Zionist militias. Kanafani later recalled the intense shame he felt when, at the age of 12, he watched the men of his family surrender their weapons to become refugees. The family settled in Damascus, Syria, where he completed his primary education. He then became a teacher for displaced Palestinian children in a refugee camp, where he began writing short stories in order to help his students contextualize their situation. He began studying for an Arabic Literature degree at the University of Damascus in 1952, but before he could complete his degree, he was expelled from the university for his political affiliations with the Movement of Arab Nationalists (MAN), to which he had been recruited by George Habash. He later relocated to Kuwait and then Beirut, where he became immersed in Marxism.

In 1961, he married Anni Høver, a Danish pedagogue and children&#x27;s rights activist, with whom he had two children. He became an editor and wrote articles for a number of Arab magazines and newspapers. His 1963 novel &quot;Men in the Sun&quot; received widespread acclaim and, along with &quot;A World that is Not Ours&quot;, symbolizes his first period of pessimism, which was later reversed in favor of active struggle in the aftermath of the 1967 Six-Day War. That year, he joined the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and became its spokesman. In 1969, he drafted a PFLP program in which the movement officially adopted Marxism–Leninism, which marked a departure from pan-Arab nationalism towards revolutionary Palestinian struggle.

In 1972, while he was in Beirut, Kanafani and his 17-year-old niece Lamees were killed by a bomb planted in his car by the Mossad, which Israel claimed was in response for the group&#x27;s role in the Lod Airport massacre; however, Kanafani&#x27;s assassination may have been planned long before.

== Early life ==
Kanafani was born in Acre in 1936 to a middle-class Sunni Muslim family of Kurdish descent. He was the third child of Muhammad Fayiz Abd al Razzag, a lawyer who was active in the Palestinian nationalist movement that opposed the British Mandate and its policies of enabling Jewish immigration, and who had been imprisoned on several occasions by the British when Ghassan was still a child. Ghassan received his early education in a French Catholic missionary school in the city of Jaffa.

In May, when the outbreak of hostilities in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War spilled over into Acre, Kanafani and his family were forced into exile, joining the Palestinian exodus. In a letter to his own son written decades later, he recalled the intense shame he felt on observing, aged 10, the men of his family surrendering their weapons to become refugees. After fleeing some north to neighbouring Lebanon, they finally settled in Damascus, Syria. They were relatively poor; the father set up a small lawyer&#x27;s practice, with the family income being supplemented by the boys&#x27; part-time work. There, Kanafani completed his secondary education, receiving a United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) teaching certificate in 1952. He was first employed as an art teacher for some 1,200 displaced Palestinian children in a refugee camp, where he began writing short stories in order to help his students contextualize their situation.

== Political background ==

In 1952, Kanafani also enrolled in the Department of Arabic Literature at the University of Damascus. The next year, he met George Habash, who introduced him to politics and was to exercise an important influence on his early work. In 1955, before he could complete his degree, with a thesis on &quot;Race and Religion in Zionist Literature&quot;, which was to form the basis for his 1967 study &quot;On Zionist Literature&quot;, Kanafani was expelled from the university for his political affiliations with the Movement of Arab Nationalists (MAN) to which Habash had recruited him. Kanafani moved to Kuwait in 1956, following his sister Fayzah Kanafani and the brother who had preceded him there, to take up a teaching position. He spent much of his free time absorbed in Russian literature. In the following year, he became editor of Jordanian &quot;Al Ra&#x27;i&quot; (&quot;The Opinion&quot;), which was an MAN-affiliated newspaper.

In 1960, he relocated again, this time to Beirut, on the advice of Habash, where he began editing the MAN mouthpiece &quot;al-Hurriya&quot; and took up an interest in Marxist philosophy and politics. In 1961, he married Anni Høver, a Danish educationalist and children&#x27;s rights activist, with whom he had two children. In 1962, Kanafani was forced briefly to go underground since he, as a stateless person, lacked proper identification papers. He reappeared in Beirut later the same year, and took up editorship of the Nasserist newspaper &quot;Al Muharrir&quot; (&quot;The Liberator&quot;), editing its weekly supplement &quot;Filastin&quot; (Palestine). He went on to become an editor of another Nasserist newspaper, &quot;Al Anwar&quot; (&quot;The Illumination&quot;), in 1967, writing essays under the pseudonym of Faris Faris. He was also editor of &quot;Assayad&quot; magazine, which was the sister publication of &quot;Al Anwar&quot;. In the same year, Kanafani also joined The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and in 1969, resigned from &quot;Al Anwar&quot; to edit the PFLP&#x27;s weekly magazine, &quot;Al Hadaf&quot; (&quot;The Goal&quot;), while drafting a PFLP program in which the movement officially took up Marxism-Leninism. This marked a departure from pan-Arab nationalism towards revolutionary Palestinian struggle. Kanafani was also one of the contributors to &quot;Lotus&quot;, a magazine launched in 1968 and financed by Egypt and the Soviet Union. At the time of his assassination, he held extensive contacts with foreign journalists and many Scandinavian anti-Zionist Jews. His political writings and journalism are thought to have made a major impact on Arab thought and strategy at that time.

==Literary output==
Though prominent as a political thinker, militant, and journalist, Kanafani is on record as stating that literature was the shaping spirit behind his politics. Kanafani&#x27;s literary style has been described as &quot;lucid and straightforward&quot;; his modernist narrative technnique—using flashback effects and a wide range of narrative voices—represents a distinct advance in Arabic fiction. Ihab Shalback and Faisal Darraj sees a trajectory in Kanafani&#x27;s writings from the simplistic dualism depicting an evil Zionist aggressor to a good Palestinian victim, to a moral affirmation of the justness of the Palestinian cause where however good and evil are not absolutes, until, dissatisfied by both, he began to appreciate that self-knowledge required understanding of the Other, and that only by unifying both distinct narratives could one grasp the deeper dynamics of the conflict.

In many of his fictions, he portrays the complex dilemmas Palestinians of various backgrounds must face. Kanafani was the first to deploy the notion of &quot;resistance literature&quot; (&quot;adab al-muqawama&quot;) with regard to Palestinian writing; in two works, published respectively in 1966 and 1968, one critic, Orit Bashkin, has noted that his novels repeat a certain fetishistic worship of arms, and that he appears to depict military means as the only way to resolve the Palestinian tragedy.
Ghassan Kanafani began writing short stories when he was working in the refugee camps. Often told as seen through the eyes of children, the stories manifested out of his political views and belief that his students&#x27; education had to relate to their immediate surroundings. While in Kuwait, he spent much time reading Russian literature and socialist theory, refining many of the short stories he wrote, winning a Kuwaiti prize.

===&quot;Men in the Sun&quot; (1962)===

In 1962, his novel, &quot;Men in the Sun&quot; (&quot;Rijal fi-a-shams&quot;), reputed to be &quot;one of the most admired and quoted works in modern Arabic fiction,&quot; was published to great critical acclaim. Rashid Khalidi considers it &quot;prescient&quot;. The story is an allegory of Palestinian calamity in the wake of the nakba in its description of the defeatist despair, passivity, and political corruption infesting the lives of Palestinians in refugee camps. The central character is an embittered ex-soldier, Abul Khaizuran, disfigured and rendered impotent by his wounds, whose cynical pursuit of money often damages his fellow countrymen. Three Palestinians, the elderly Abu Qais, Assad, and the youth Marwan, hide in the empty water tank of a lorry in order to cross the border into Kuwait. They have managed to get through as Basra and drew up to the last checkpoint. Abul Khaizuran, the truck driver, tries to be brisk but is dragged into defending his honor as the Iraqi checkpoint officer teases him by suggesting he had been dallying with prostitutes. The intensity of heat within the water carrier is such that no one could survive more than several minutes, and indeed they expire inside as Khaizuran is drawn into trading anecdotes that play up a non-existent virility—they address him as though he were effeminized, with the garrulous Abu Baqir outside in an office. Their deaths are to be blamed, not on the effect of the stifling effect of the sun&#x27;s heat, but on their maintaining silence as they suffer. The ending has often been read as a trope for the futility of Palestinian attempts to try to build a new identity far away from their native Palestine, and the figure of Abul Khaizuran a symbol of the impotence of the Palestinian leadership. Amy Zalman has detected a covert leitmotif embedded in the tale, in which Palestine is figured as the beloved female body, while the male figures are castrated from being productive in their attempts to seek another country. In this reading, a real national identity for Palestinians can only be reconstituted by marrying awareness of gender to aspirations to return. A film based on the story, &quot;Al-Makhdu&#x27;un&quot; (&quot;The Betrayed&quot; or &quot;The Dupes&quot;), was produced by Tewfik Saleh in 1972.

===&quot;All That&#x27;s Left to You&quot; (1966)===
&quot;All That&#x27;s Left to You&quot; (&quot;Ma Tabaqqah Lakum&quot;) (1966) is set in a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. It deals with a woman, Maryam, and her brother, Hamid, both orphaned in the 1948 war, their father dying in combat—his last words being a demand that they abstain from marriage until the national cause has been won—and their mother separated from them in the flight from Jaffa. She turns up in Jordan, they end up with an aunt in Gaza, and live united in a set of Oedipal displacements; Hamid seeks a mother-substitute in his sister, while Maryam entertains a quasi incestuous love for her brother. Maryam eventually breaks the paternal prohibition to marry a two-time traitor, Zakaria, since he is bigamous, and because he gave the Israelis information to capture an underground fighter, resulting in the latter&#x27;s death. Hamid, outraged, tramps off through the Negev, aspiring to reach their mother in Jordan. The two episodes of Hamid in the desert, and Maryam in the throes of her relationship with Zakaria, are interwoven into a simultaneous cross-narrative: the young man encounters a wandering Israeli soldier who has lost contact with his unit, and wrestles his armaments from him, and ends up undergoing a kind of rebirth as he struggles with the desert. Maryam, challenged by her husband to abort their child, whom she will call Hamid, decides to save the child by killing Zakaria. This story won the Lebanese Literary prize in that year.

===&quot;Umm Sa&#x27;ad&quot; (1969)===

In &quot;Umm Sa&#x27;ad&quot; (1969), the impact of his new revolutionary outlook is explicit as he creates the portrait of a mother who encourages her son to take up arms as a resistance fedayeen in full awareness that the choice of life might eventuate in his death.

===&quot;Return to Haifa&quot; (1970)===

&quot;Return to Haifa&quot; (&quot;A&#x27;id lla Hayfa&quot;) (1970) is the story of a Palestinian couple, Sa&#x27;id and his wife Safiyya, who have been living for nearly two decades in the Palestinian town of Ramallah, which was under Jordanian administration until it and the rest of the West Bank were conquered in the Six-Day War. The couple must learn to face the fact that their five-month-old child, a son they were forced to leave behind in their home in Haifa in 1948, has been raised as an Israeli Jew, an echo of the Solomonic judgement. The father searches for the real Palestine through the rubble of memory, only to find more rubble. The Israeli occupation means that they have finally an opportunity to go back and visit Haifa in Israel. The journey to his home in the district of Halisa on the al-jalil mountain evokes the past as he once knew it. The dissonance between the remembered Palestinian past and the remade Israeli present of Haifa and its environs creates a continuous diasporic anachronism. The novel deals with two decisive days, one 21 April 1948, the other 30 June 1967; the earlier date relates to the fall of Haifa, when the Haganah launched its assault on the city and Palestinians who were not killed in resistance actions fled. Sa&#x27;id and his wife were ferried out on British boats to Acre. A Polish Jew and Holocaust survivor, Evrat Kushan, and his wife, Miriam, find their son Khaldun in their home, and take over the property and raise the toddler as a Jew, with the new name &quot;Dov&quot;. When they visit the home, Kushen&#x27;s wife greets them with the words: &quot;I&#x27;ve been expecting you for the a long time.&quot; Kushen&#x27;s recall of the events of April 1948 confirms Sa&#x27;id&#x27;s own impression, that the fall of the town was coordinated by the British forces and the Haganah. When Dov returns, he is wearing an IDF uniform, and vindictively resentful of the fact they abandoned him. Compelled by the scene to leave the home, the father reflects that only military action can settle the dispute, realizing however that, in such an eventuality, it may well be that Dov/Khaldun will confront his brother Khalid in battle. The novel conveys nonetheless a criticism of Palestinians for the act of abandonment, and betrays a certain admiration for the less than easy, stubborn insistence of Zionists, whose sincerity and determination must be the model for Palestinians in their future struggle. Ariel Bloch indeed argues that Dov functions, when he rails against his father&#x27;s weakness, as a mouthpiece for Kanafani himself. Sa&#x27;id symbolizes irresolute Palestinians who have buried the memory of their flight and betrayal of their homeland. At the same time, the homeland can no longer be based on a nostalgic filiation with the past as a foundation, but rather an affiliation that defies religious and ethnic distinctions. Notwithstanding the indictment of Palestinians, and a tacit empathy with the Israeli enemy&#x27;s dogged nation-building, the novel&#x27;s surface rhetoric remains keyed to national liberation through armed struggle. An imagined aftermath to the story has been written by Israeli novelist Sami Michael, a native Arabic-speaking Israeli Jew, in his &quot;Yonim be-Trafalgar&quot; (Pigeons in Trafalgar Square).

His article on Izz ad-Din al-Qassam, published in the PLO&#x27;s Research Centre Magazine, &quot;Shu&#x27;un Filistiniyya&quot; (Palestinian Affairs), was influential in diffusing the image of the former as a forerunner of the Palestinian armed struggle, and, according to Rashid Khalidi, consolidated the Palestinian narrative that tends to depict failure as a triumph.

== Assassination ==
On 8 July 1972, Kanafani, was assassinated in Beirut by the Mossad, the Israeli foreign intelligence service. When Kanafani turned on the ignition of his Austin 1100, a grenade connected to the ignition switch detonated and in turn detonated a 3 kilo plastic bomb planted behind the bumper bar. Both Kanafani and his 17-year-old niece Lamees Najim, who had been accompanying him, were killed.
Israel stated the assassination was in response for the group&#x27;s role in the Lod Airport massacre carried out by three members of the Japanese Red Army, but Kanafani&#x27;s assassination may have been planned long before. At the time, Kanafani was the spokesperson of the PFLP, and the group claimed responsibility for the attack. Kanafani also appeared in photographs together with the three Japanese Red Army members shortly before they carried out the attack. According to Mark Ensalaco, Kanafani had justified tactics used by the attackers in July. Kameel Nasr states that Kanafani, together with his deputy, Bassam Abu Sharif, had demanded in press conferences dealing with Palestinian hijackings common at the time, that Israel release prisoners; however, Nasr states that Kanafani and Abu Sharif had mellowed and had started speaking against indiscriminate violence. Several days after the Lod massacre, a picture of Kanafani together with one of the Japanese terrorists was circulated. Rumours circulated suggesting Lebanese Security forces had been complicit. Bassam Abu Sharif, who survived an attempt on his life two weeks later, suspected that the attempts on Kanafani and later himself were ordered by Israel but had employed an Arab intermediary, perhaps Abu Ahmed Yunis; Yunis was executed by the PFLP in 1981.

Kanafani&#x27;s obituary in Lebanon&#x27;s &quot;The Daily Star&quot; wrote that: &quot;He was a commando who never fired a gun, whose weapon was a ball-point pen, and his arena the newspaper pages.&quot;

On his death, several uncompleted novels were found among his Nachlass, one dating back as early as 1966.

==Commemoration==
A collection of Palestinian Resistance poems, &quot;The Palestinian Wedding,&quot; which took its title from the eponymous poem by Mahmoud Darwish, was published in his honor. He was the posthumous recipient of the Afro-Asia Writers&#x27; Conference &#x27;s Lotus Prize for Literature in 1975. Ghassan Kanafani&#x27;s memory was upheld through the creation of the Ghassan Kanafani Cultural Foundation, which has since established eight kindergartens for the children of Palestinian refugees. His legacy lives on among the Palestinians, and he is considered to be a leading novelist of his generation and one of the Arab world&#x27;s leading Palestinian writers.

<doc id="668034" wikidata="Q4657127" url="?curid=668034" title="A Good School">
<text>A Good School is a novel by American writer Richard Yates first published in 1978. It is set at a fictional Connecticut prep school in the early 1940s and relates the coming of age of a group of mainly WASP boys who at the same time prepare themselves if half-heartedly, to go to war immediately after graduation. &quot;A Good School&quot; also delves into the complex private lives of some of the masters and their love-hate relationship with both their profession and the particular school they are teaching at.

==Plot summary==
The school, modeled on Yates&#x27; own experiences as an adolescent at Avon Old Farms School, is called Dorset Academy, a small private institution dependent on its now senile founder, a wealthy older woman named Abigail Church Hooper, a thinly-veiled reference to Avon Old Farms founder Theodate Pope Riddle. Dorset Academy is at best a second-rate institution, having the reputation of an unusual sort of prep school, where many of the students are on scholarship, and Dr. Stone, the English master, is the only &quot;Harvard man&quot;. However, throughout the book, parents, teachers, even students insist that it is &quot;a good school&quot;.

In the &quot;Foreword&quot;, the first person narrator, 15-year-old William Grove, a stand-in for Yates, relates what makes his divorcée mother, decide on Dorset Academy for her son. The main body of the novel is told in the third person, with Grove retreating into a group of schoolmates only to re-emerge at the end of the book, in the &quot;Afterword&quot;, which is told from a distance of more than 30 years. There, William Grove, now a writer, looks back nostalgically on Dorset Academy where, as the editor of the school paper, he learned &quot;the rudiments of [his] trade&quot;.

As one of the masters puts it, the school harbors &quot;a tremendous amount of sheer sexual energy&quot;. This is certainly true of the boys, who make a game of selecting one of the weaker boys, pinning him down on his bed and giving him a handjob to the point of ejaculation. On the other hand, they try hard to hide their erections from adults and girls, whether it is Dr. Stone&#x27;s beautiful daughter Edith or the girls arriving for the annual Spring Dance. The teachers also suffer under too much sexual energy, especially Jack Draper, the chemistry master, crippled from polio, who becomes the witness of his wife&#x27;s crude attempts to hide a year-and-a-half-long affair with the French master, Jean-Paul La Prade. When, toward the end of the novel, it is announced that Dorset Academy will have to close due to mounting debt, Draper decides to hang himself in his chemistry lab in humiliation. He is too weak, however, to push the chair away from under his feet and proceeds home where he reconciles with his estranged wife.

The &quot;Foreword&quot; and the &quot;Afterword&quot; create the impression of Yates, the author, directly addressing his audience and could be seen as &quot;false documents&quot;.

<text>The waist is the part of the abdomen between the rib cage and hips. Normally, it is the narrowest part of the torso.

&quot;Waistline&quot; refers to the horizontal line where the waist is narrowest, or to the general appearance of the waist.

==Structure==
Because of this and because the waist is often synonymous with the stomach, one can become confused as to the exact location of the waist. Another confusing factor is that the waistline differs on different people. A study showed that self-reported measurements, as opposed to measurement done by a technician, underestimated waist circumference and this underestimation increased with increased body size. In the study, waist circumference measured at the level of the umbilicus was larger than that measured at the natural waist. 

To locate the natural waistline, one need simply stand upright and then tilt over to the side, keeping the legs and hips straight. Where the torso creases is the natural waistline.

===Waist measurement===
The waist is usually measured at the smallest circumference of the natural waist, usually just above the belly button. Where the waist is convex rather than concave, as in pregnancy and obesity, the waist may be measured at a vertical level 1 inch above the navel.

Strictly, the waist circumference is measured at a level midway between the lowest palpable rib and the iliac crest, respectively typically 60% and 64% of total height. It can be predicted as 72% of the neck height; an alternative approximation, very relevant in anthropometry, is Small of the Back (SOB) + 2cm.

Variables such as posture significantly influence the measurement of the waist, and therefore any measurements for a group need to maintain a constant posture between the subjects.

Waist size (waist circumference) is an indicator of abdominal obesity and is one of the criteria for diagnosing the metabolic syndrome. Excess abdominal fat is a risk factor for developing heart disease and other obesity related diseases. A study published in the &quot;European Heart Journal&quot; in April 2007 showed that waist circumference and waist–hip ratio (defined as waist circumference divided by hip circumference) were predictors of cardiovascular events. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute classifies the risk of obesity-related diseases as high if men have a waist circumference greater than and women have a waist circumference greater than . Further, whether waist circumference or body mass index (BMI) is a better predictor of adverse health outcomes is debatable. For example, those who lift weights may have high BMI but are at relatively low risk for cardiovascular consequences. For these people, waist circumference may be a better indicator of overall health. Some research suggests waist circumference can be predicted from brain function, therefore capturing the neurobehavioral pathophysiology of obesity.

An extremally high waist circumference can lead to falsely low estimates of bone health when using the trabecular bone score. 

===Waist–hip ratio===

Waist–hip ratio is the ratio of the circumference of the waist to that of the hips. It measures the proportion by which fat is distributed around the torso.

==Society and culture==
===Fashion===
In modern clothing, the region referred to as the waist is considerably below the waist as defined anatomically. 
With the advent of pants and skirts that do not require support from above, the clothing waist moved down to a position where the body starts to expand to form the buttocks and a support is therefore available. However, the waist region remains a highly important measurement and anthropometric landmark in garment construction.

Jewellery, such as a belly chain, may be worn around either the clothing or anatomical waist.

===Waist reduction and training===
Waist reduction or waist training refer to the act of wearing a corset or other constricting garment to reduce or alter the waistline. The four floating ribs may be permanently compressed or moved by such garments. A girdle may also be used to alter the appearance of the waist.

Waist reduction may be used simply to reduce the width of the waist. This change can be permanent or temporary.

Waist training may be used to achieve a certain permanent waist shape, such as a pipe-stem waist.

==History==
===Etymology===
Definition: &quot;middle part of the body,&quot; also &quot;part of a garment fitted for the waist, portion of a garment that covers the waist&quot; (but, due to fashion styles, often above or below it), probably from Old English &#x27;growth&#x27;, hence, &#x27;where the body grows&#x27;, from Proto-Germanic (cognates: Old English , Old Norse , Swedish , Old High German &#x27;growth, increase&#x27;, Gothic &#x27;stature&#x27;, Old English &#x27;to grow&#x27;.

<text>Mauna ʻAla (Fragrant Hills) in the Hawaiian language, is the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii (also called Royal Mausoleum State Monument) and the final resting place of Hawaii&#x27;s two prominent royal families: the Kamehameha Dynasty and the Kalākaua Dynasty.

== Background ==
In the early 19th century, the area near an ancient burial site was known as Pohukaina. It is believed to be the name of a chief (sometimes spelled Pahukaina) who according to legend chose a cave in Kanehoalani in the Koʻolau Range for his resting place. The land belonged to Kekauluohi, who later ruled as Kuhina Nui, as part of her birthright.

After 1825, the first Western-style royal tomb was constructed for the bodies of King Kamehameha II and his queen Kamāmalu near the current ʻIolani Palace. They were buried on August 23, 1825. The idea was heavily influenced by the tombs at Westminster Abbey during Kamehameha II&#x27;s trip to London. The mausoleum was a small house made of coral blocks with a thatched roof. It had no windows, and it was the duty of two chiefs to guard the iron-locked koa door day and night. No one was allowed to enter the vault except for burials or Memorial Day, a Hawaiian holiday celebrated on December 30. Over time, as more bodies were added, the small vault became crowded, so other chiefs and retainers were buried in unmarked graves nearby. In 1865 a selected eighteen coffins were removed to the Royal Mausoleum named Mauna ʻAla in Nuʻuanu Valley. But many chiefs remain on the site including: Keaweʻīkekahialiʻiokamoku, Kalaniʻōpuʻu, Chiefess Kapiʻolani, and Haʻalilio.

Prior to the 19th century, the remains of aliʻi of Hawaiʻi island were buried at Hale o Keawe and Hale o Līloa. Other Western-style tombs include a burial site at Honolulu Fort which was lost when the fort was demolished in 1857, a tomb in Lahaina located near Halekamani, and a tomb on the island of Mokuʻula in Lahaina. The royal remains from the last two burial sites were transferred to the cemetery of Waiola Church in 1884.

== Construction ==
The 2.75-acre (11,000 m2) mausoleum was designed by architect Theodore Heuck. By 1862, the Royal Tomb at Pohukaina was full and there were no space for the coffins of Prince Albert, who died August 27, 1862, and King Kamehameha IV, who died November 30, 1863. Kamehameha IV&#x27;s funeral was delayed for three months while a new mausoleum was built.

Immediately Kamehameha V, brother of Kamehameha IV, started construction of a new mausoleum building in the Nuʻuanu Valley on a site chosen by Kamehameha IV and his wife Queen Emma. The Right Reverend Thomas Nettleship Staley, first Anglican Bishop of Honolulu (1823–1898), oversaw construction. The west &quot;(ʻEwa)&quot; wing was completed at the end of January 1864. A large funeral procession February 3, 1864, brought the body of Kamehameha IV from ʻIolani Palace. His casket was placed on a stand in the new wing. Later in the evening, bearers brought the casket of &quot;Ka Haku o Hawaiʻi&quot; (as Prince Albert was known) and laid him to rest alongside his father. Queen Emma was so overcome with grief that she camped on the grounds of Mauna ʻAla, and slept in the mausoleum.

The mausoleum was completed in 1865, adjacent to the public 1844 Oahu Cemetery. The mausoleum seemed a fitting place to bury other past monarchs of the Kingdom of Hawaii and their families. The remains of past deceased royals were transferred in a torchlit ceremony at night leading from Pohukaina to the Nuʻuanu Valley on October 30, 1865.

Robert Crichton Wyllie, Minister of Foreign Affairs, was buried here in October 1865. Over time, the remains of almost all of Hawaii&#x27;s monarchs, their consorts, and various princes and princesses would rest at the Royal Mausoleum.

Kamehameha I and William Charles Lunalilo are the only two kings not resting at the mausoleum. William Charles Lunalilo, the shortest-reigning Hawaiian monarch, (one year and 25 days only), was buried in the Lunalilo Tomb in the church cemetery resting in the courtyard of Kawaiahaʻo Church. Princess Nāhiʻenaʻena and Queen Keōpūolani are buried on Maui at Waiola Church.
Kamehameha I&#x27;s remains were hidden in a traditional practice to preserve the &quot;mana&quot; (power) of the aliʻi at the time of the Hawaiian religion. For several generations, descendants of Hoʻolulu, one of the few chosen to help bury the remains of Kamehameha, have been appointed as caretakers.

=== Additional modifications ===
On November 9, 1887, after the main mausoleum building became too crowded, the caskets belonging to members of the Kamehameha Dynasty were moved to the newly built Kamehameha Tomb, an underground vault commissioned by Charles Reed Bishop, husband of Bernice Pauahi Bishop. The Territory of Hawaii built a second underground crypt, the Wyllie Tomb (formerly known as the Queen Emma Tomb) in 1904 to separate the caskets of Robert Crichton Wyllie and the relatives of Queen Emma. In 1907, the Territory of Hawaii allocated $20,000 for the construction of a separate underground vault for the Kalākaua family. Queen Liliʻuokalani and Prince Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole were consulted in the construction process. On June 24, 1910, the caskets from the Kalākaua family were moved to newly construct Kalākaua Crypt in a torchlit nighttime ceremony supervised by the former queen. 

In 1922 the main building was converted to a chapel after the last royal remains were moved to tombs constructed on the grounds. The chapel was added to the National Register of Historic Places August 7, 1972.

In 2023, Abigail Kinoiki Kekaulike Kawānanakoa (1926–2022) became the most recent person to be buried in the Royal Mausoleum. Prior to her death there had not been a burial at the Royal Mausoleum since David Kalākaua Kawānanakoa in 1953. A new tomb was constructed since the Kalākaua vault was at capacity.

== Legal Status ==
Mauna ʻAla was removed from the public lands of the United States by a joint resolution of Congress in 1900, two years after the annexation in 1898 of Hawaii by the Newlands Resolution and President William McKinley.

The Mausoleum is one of the only places in Hawaii where the flag of Hawaii can officially fly alone without the American flag. The other three places are Iolani Palace, the Puʻuhonua o Hōnaunau Heiau and Thomas Square.

<doc id="668041" wikidata="Q484195" url="?curid=668041" title="Timurid Empire">
<text>The Timurid Empire was a late medieval, culturally Persianate, Turco-Mongol empire that dominated Greater Iran in the early 15th century, comprising modern-day Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, much of Central Asia, the South Caucasus, and parts of contemporary Pakistan, North India, and Turkey. The empire was culturally hybrid, combining Turkic, Mongolic, and Persian influences, with the last members of the dynasty being &quot;regarded as ideal Perso-Islamic rulers&quot;.

The empire was founded by Timur (also known as Tamerlane), a warlord of Turco-Mongol lineage, who established the empire between 1370 and his death in 1405. He envisioned himself as the great restorer of the Mongol Empire of Genghis Khan, regarded himself as Genghis&#x27;s heir, and associated closely with the Borjigin. Timur continued vigorous trade relations with Ming China and the Golden Horde, with Chinese diplomats like Ma Huan and Chen Cheng regularly traveling west to Samarkand to buy and sell goods. The empire led to the Timurid Renaissance, particularly during the reign of astronomer and mathematician Ulugh Begh.

By 1467, the ruling Timurid dynasty, or Timurids, had lost most of Persia to the Aq Qoyunlu confederation. However, members of the Timurid dynasty continued to rule smaller states, sometimes known as Timurid emirates, in Central Asia and parts of India. In the 16th century, Babur, the Timurid prince of Ferghana (modern Uzbekistan), invaded Kabulistan (modern Afghanistan) and established a small kingdom there. Twenty years later, he used this kingdom as a staging ground to invade the Delhi Sultanate in India and established the Mughal Empire.

== Names of the state ==
Timurid historian Sharaf al-Din Ali Yazdi states in his work &quot;Zafarnama&quot; (Book of victories) that the name of the Timur&#x27;s state was Turan (). Timur personally ordered the name of his state as &quot;Turan&quot; be carved onto a rock fragment in Ulu Tagh mountainside (present-day Kazakhstan), known today as Karsakpay inscription. The original text, in particular, states:

&quot;... Sultan of Turan, Timur bey went up with three hundred thousand troops for Islam on the Bulgarian Khan, Tokhtamysh Khan...&quot;

In the literature of the Timurid era, the realm was formally referred to as Iran-o-Turan () in the same manner that the words &#x27;Turk&#x27; and &#x27;Tajik&#x27; were paired together. The border between the two areas was considered to be at the Oxus River. Both terms were concerned with imperial traditions, Iran being Persian and Perso-Islamic, and Turan with the steppe empires of the Turks and the Mongols. Mawarannahr () also appears as the name of the realm.

According to Shia authors, the ruling dynasty of Timurids was called Gurkani (, Gurkāniyān). Gurkani means &#x27;son-in-law&#x27;, a title applied by Timur to help legitimise his rule as he could not claim Genghisid descent. To this end, he married a Genghisid princess, Saray Mulk Khanum.

== Genealogy ==

The Timurid dynasty originated from the Barlas tribe. Timur&#x27;s father told him the story of how his family was descended from &quot;Abu al-Atrāk&quot; ( &#x27;Father of the Turks&#x27;), according to the statement of his father.

According to the Timurid ruler Ulugh Beg&#x27;s &quot;Tārīkh-i arbaʿ ulūs&quot; ( &#x27;History of Four Nations&#x27;), abridged as the &quot;Shajarat al-atrāk&quot; ( &#x27;Genealogy of Turks&#x27;)&quot;,&quot; Timurids were descendants of Turk, son of Yāfas (Japheth). Turk was commonly referred as &quot;Father of the Turks&quot;. Mughul and Tatar were twin brothers and children of Aljeh Khan, and therefore fifth generation descendants of Turk.

Ulugh Beg&#x27;s work on genealogy classified Mongols as &quot;Turks&quot;, while also praising their warrior spirit.&quot;&quot; Ulugh Beg included Yāfas (Japheth), Turk, Mughūl, Tātār and Ughūz in the genealogical record of the Genghisids and Timurids.

==History==
Timur conquered large parts of the ancient greater Persian territories in Central Asia, primarily Transoxiana and Khorasan, from 1363 onwards with various alliances. He took Samarkand in 1366 and Balkh in 1369. He was recognized as ruler over them in 1370. Acting officially in the name of Suurgatmish, the Chagatai khan, he subjugated Transoxiana and Khwarazm in the years that followed. Already in the 1360s, he had gained control of the western Chagatai Khanate. While as emir he was nominally subordinate to the khan, in reality it was now Timur who picked the khans. These became mere puppet rulers. The western Chagatai khans were continually dominated by Timurid princes in the 15th and 16th centuries, and their figurehead importance was eventually reduced into total insignificance.

===Rise===
Timur began a campaign westwards in 1380, invading the various successor states of the Ilkhanate. By 1389, he had removed the Kartids from Herat and advanced into mainland Persia where he enjoyed many successes. This included the capture of Isfahan in 1387, the removal of the Muzaffarids from Shiraz in 1393, and the expulsion of the Jalayirids from Baghdad. Tokhtamysh, the khan of the Golden Horde, was a major rival to Timur in the region. In 1394–1395, he triumphed over the Golden Horde, following his successful campaign in Georgia, after which he enforced his sovereignty in the Caucasus.

In 1398, the anarchy prevailing in the Delhi Sultanate had drawn Timur&#x27;s attention. At the beginning of 1398, Timur sent an army led by his grandson Pir Muhammad to cross the Indus and attack Multan; the successful siege lasted six months. Later in the same year, Timur himself marched the main army across the Indus, and after destroying Tulamba joined Pir Muhammad. At Sutlej, he defeated the Khokhar chief Jasrat and then took the Loni and Bhatnair forts, seven miles northeast of Delhi. In December 1398, Timur engaged with the armies of Sultan Mahmud Shah and won. This led to his triumphal entry into Delhi, where he conducted a massacre but spared the craftsmen to be sent to Samarkand. He left Delhi in January 1399. During Timur&#x27;s entry into India, he was faced by a sultanate that was already in decline due to the secession of its richest provinces.

Later in 1400–1401 he conquered Aleppo, Damascus and eastern Anatolia. In 1401 he destroyed Baghdad, and in 1402 he defeated the Ottomans in the Battle of Ankara. This made Timur the most preeminent Muslim ruler of the time, as the Ottoman Empire plunged into civil war. Meanwhile, he transformed Samarkand into a major capital and seat of his realm.

===Stagnation and decline===

Timur appointed his sons and grandsons to the main governorships of the different parts of his empire, and outsiders to some others. After his death in 1405, the family quickly fell into disputes and civil wars, effectively weakening themselves, and many of the governors became conclusively independent. Due to the fact that the Persian cities were desolated by wars, the seats of Persian culture were now in Samarkand and Herat, cities that became the centre of the Timurid renaissance. The costs of Timur&#x27;s conquests included the deaths of possibly 17 million people.

Shahrukh Mirza, the fourth ruler of the Timurids, dealt with the Qara Qoyunlu, who aimed to expand into Iran. But in the wake of Shahrukh&#x27;s death, the Qara Qoyunlu under Jahan Shah drove the Timurids out to eastern Iran after 1447 and also briefly occupied Herat in 1458. After the death of Jahan Shah, Uzun Hasan, bey of the Aq Qoyunlu, conquered the holdings of the Qara Qoyunlu in Iran between 1469 and 1471.

===Fall===
The power of Timurids declined rapidly during the second half of the 15th century, largely due to the Timurid/Mongol tradition of partitioning the empire as well as several civil wars. The Aq Qoyunlu conquered most of Iran from the Timurids, and by 1500, the divided and war-torn Timurid Empire had lost control of most of its territory, and in the following years it was effectively pushed back on all fronts. Persia, the Caucasus, Mesopotamia, and Eastern Anatolia fell quickly to the Shiite Safavid Empire, secured by Shah Ismail I in the following decade. Much of the Central Asian lands was overrun by the Uzbeks of Muhammad Shaybani who conquered the key cities of Samarkand and Herat in 1505 and 1507, and who founded the Khanate of Bukhara. From Kabul, the Mughal Empire was established in 1526 by Babur, a descendant of Timur through his father and possibly a descendant of Genghis Khan through his mother. The dynasty he established is commonly known as the Mughal dynasty though it was directly inherited from the Timurids. By the 17th century, the Mughal Empire ruled most of India but eventually declined during the following century. The Timurid dynasty finally came to an end when the remaining nominal rule of the Mughals was abolished by the British Empire following the 1857 rebellion.

==Culture==


Although the Timurids hailed from the Barlas tribe, which was of Turkicized Mongol origin, they converted to Islam, and resided in Turkestan and Khorasan. Thus, the Timurid era had a dual character, reflecting both its Turco-Mongol origins and the Persian literary, artistic, and courtly high culture of the dynasty.

===Language===
During the Timurid era, Central Asian society was bifurcated, with the responsibilities of government and rule divided into military and civilian spheres along ethnic lines. At least in the early stages, the military was almost exclusively Turco-Mongolian, while the civilian and administrative element was almost exclusively Persian. The spoken language shared by all the Turko-Mongolians throughout the area was Chaghatay. The political organization hearkened back to the steppe-nomadic system of patronage introduced by Genghis Khan. The major language of the period, however, was Persian, the native language of the Tājīk (Persian) component of society and the language of learning acquired by all literate or urban people. Timur was already steeped in Persian culture and in most of the territories he incorporated, Persian was the primary language of administration and literary culture. Thus the language of the settled &quot;diwan&quot; was Persian, and its scribes had to be thoroughly adept in Persian culture, whatever their ethnic origin. Persian became the official state language of the Timurid Empire and served as the language of administration, history, belles lettres, and poetry. The Chaghatay language was the native and &quot;home language&quot; of the Timurid family, while Arabic served as the language &quot;par excellence&quot; of science, philosophy, theology and the religious sciences.

===Literature===
====Persian====

Persian literature, especially Persian poetry, occupied a central place in the process of assimilation of the Timurid elite to the Perso-Islamic courtly culture. The Timurid sultans, especially Shāh Rukh Mīrzā and his son Mohammad Taragai Oloğ Beg, patronized Persian culture. Among the most important literary works of the Timurid era is the Persian biography of Timur, known as &quot;Zafarnāmeh&quot; (), written by Sharaf al-Din Ali Yazdi, which itself is based on an older &quot;Zafarnāmeh&quot; by Nizam al-Din Shami, the official biographer of Timur during his lifetime. The most famous poet of the Timurid era was Nūr ud-Dīn Jāmī, the last great medieval Sufi mystic of Persia and one of the greatest figures in Persian poetry. Hearing of the Persian culture of the Timurid empire, the Ottoman sultan Mehmed II encouraged those under his patronage to engage with the models provided by Persian cultural centers like Shiraz and Tabriz, and in particular by the Timurid court of Sultan Husayn Bayqara (r. 1469–1506) in Herat. Mehmed II was determined to foster the creation of a new language and literary-artistic culture for his burgeoning court in Istanbul.

In addition, some of the astronomical works of the Timurid sultan Ulugh Beg were written in Persian, although the bulk of it was published in Arabic. The Timurid prince Baysunghur also commissioned a new edition of the Persian national epic Shāhnāmeh, known as &quot;Shāhnāmeh of Baysunghur&quot;, and wrote an introduction to it. The Persian poet &#x27;Ismat Allah Bukhari taught poetry to Khalil Sultan, grandson of Timur. According to T. Lenz:

Following the publication of &quot;Mukhtar al-Ikhtiyar&quot;, a legal manual that was used until the twentieth century, by the head magistrate of Bayqara in Herat, Persian was used as a language of jurisprudence (fiqh) under the late Timurids.

During the reign of sultan Husayn Bayqara, the &quot;Irshad al-zira&#x27;a&quot;, a Persian agricultural treatise, was written by Qasim b. Yusuf Abu Nasiri. Based on in-depth, first-hand conversations with farmers, the &quot;Irshad al-zira&#x27;a&quot;, covered the agricultural development of Herat and included minor architectural suggestions for gardens.

====Chagatai====
The Timurids also played a very important role in the history of Turkic literature. Based on the established Persian literary tradition, a national Turkic literature was developed in the Chagatai language. Chagatai poets such as Mīr Alī Sher Nawā&#x27;ī, Sultan Husayn Bāyqarā, and Zāhiruddīn Bābur encouraged other Turkic-speaking poets to write in their own vernacular in addition to Arabic and Persian. Nawa’i&#x27;s work, predominantly based on Persian designs, was an attempt to create a culture that was specific to the Turkophone audience. The Bāburnāma, the autobiography of Bābur (although being highly Persianized in its sentence structure, morphology, and vocabulary), as well as Mīr Alī Sher Nawā&#x27;ī&#x27;s Chagatai poetry are among the best-known Turkic literary works and have influenced many others.

Despite being spread throughout Central and South Asia, Chaghatai Turkic remained the junior partner to Persian, and was not promoted systemically in the Timurid Empire to replace Persian. Chaghatai texts were found at Sultan Husayn Bayqara&#x27;s court, but the Timurid chancery and court continued to use Persian. Although the body of Turkic literature produced in Central Asia increased during the Timurid era of the fifteenth century—partially as a result of Mir &#x27;Ali Shir Nawa&#x27;i&#x27;s independent efforts toward the end of the Timurid century—it was still dwarfed by the Persian literary output that the Timurid elite supported. There are no surviving Turkic historical work from the Timurids, although two Turkic histories seem to have been written during the Timurid period before the flowering of the Timurid historiography in Persian.

===Art===
The golden age of Persian painting began during the reign of the Timurids. During this period – and analogous to the developments in Safavid Iran – Chinese art and artists had a significant influence on Persian art. Timurid artists refined the Persian art of the book, which combines paper, calligraphy, illumination, illustration and binding in a brilliant and colourful whole. The Mongol ethnicity of the Chaghatayid and Timurid khans was the source of the stylistic depiction of Persian art during the Middle Ages. These same Mongols intermarried with the Persians and Turks of Central Asia, even adopting their religion and languages. Yet their simple control of the world at that time, particularly in the 13th–15th centuries, reflected itself in the idealised appearance of Persians as Mongols. Though the ethnic make-up gradually blended into the Iranian and Mesopotamian local populations, the Mongol stylism continued well after and crossed into Asia Minor and even North Africa.

===Architecture===

Timurid architecture elaborated on the existing tradition of Iranian and Central Asian architecture that had grown up to the preceding Ilkhanid period. The Timurid style is distinguished by large-scale buildings, layouts with strong axial symmetry, prominent double-shelled domes in bulbous form, rich exterior tile decoration (in both tile mosaic and &quot;banna&#x27;i&quot; techniques), and sophisticated interior vaulting. Timur used various tools for legitimisation, including urban planning in his capital, Samarkand. One of the earliest surviving Timurid monuments is the Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi in present-day Kazakhstan (1389–1399). Many of the major imperial monuments of the era are found in Samarkand, including the Gur-i Amir Mausoleum (completed ), the Bibi-Khanym Mosque (1399–1404), the Shah-i Zinda necropolis (late 14th to early 15th centuries), and the Ulugh Beg Madrasa (1417–1420). The most important patron of architecture in the 15th century was Gawhar Shad, whose constructions demonstrate a high quality of decoration and increasingly elaborate structural elements, with important examples being her religious and funerary complex in Herat and the mosque of Gawhar Shad in Mashhad. The power and prestige of the empire, along with the scale of its patronage, ensured that its architectural style was a major subsequent influence in many regions. In Iran, it was inherited by the Safavids, while in the east it was inherited by the Mughals (of Timurid origin) on the Indian subcontinent, where it was blended with Indo-Islamic influences to create the Mughal style. Further west, it also influenced early Ottoman architecture.

==Military==

In the Chagatay translation of Ali Yazdi&#x27;s &quot;Zafarnama&quot;, Timur&#x27;s army is called a &quot;Chagatay army&quot; (&quot;Čaġatāy čerigi&quot;).

The Timurids relied on the conscription of troops from settled populations. They were unable to fully subjugate many other nomadic tribes. This was not because of lack of military power as Timur succeeded in defeating them, but rather because he was unwilling to integrate autonomous tribes into his power structure due to his centralised governance. The tribes were too mobile to effectively suppress and the loss of their autonomy was unattractive to them. Hence, Timur was unable to win the loyalty of the tribes, and his hold over them did not survive his death.

The role of slave soldiers such as the ghilman and mamluks was considerably smaller in Mongol-based armies like the Timurids, as compared to other Islamic societies.

The Timurids had a contingent called the nambardar levy, which mostly consisted of native Iranians, and occasionally scholars and fiscal administrators. The nambardar were used to bolster the size of the army for large expeditions.

== Symbols of the state ==

The main symbol of the Timurids is thought to have been the so-called &quot;sign of Timur&quot;, which is three equal circles (or rings) arranged in the form of an equilateral triangle (). Ruy de Clavijo (d. 1412), the ambassador of the king of Castile to the court of Timur in 1403, and the Arab historian, Ibn Arabshah described the sign, which was encountered on the seal of the Amir, as well as on Timurid coins. Timur himself issued several coins bearing the &quot;three annulets&quot; tamgha on the reverse.

It is not known for certain what meaning the triangular sign had, but according to Clavijo, each circle meant a part of the world (of which there were three before 1492), and the owner of the symbol was their ruler. The sign consisting of circles perhaps tried to illustrate Timur&#x27;s nickname of &quot;Sahib-Qiran&quot; (the ruler of three benevolent planets). According to Ruy de Clavijo, the emblem adopted by Timur was composed of &quot;three circlets&quot; arranged into the shape of a triangle:&lt;br&gt; 
Often images of abstract symbols (tamga) on coins were accompanied by the Persian expression &quot;Rāstī rustī&quot; (), which can be translated as &quot;In rectitude lies salvation&quot;. It is also known that the same expression was used in flags as well.

===Flag===

Standards with a golden crescent are mentioned in different historical sources. Some miniatures depict the red banners of Timur&#x27;s army, and it is thought that Timur generally used red banners, probably for visibility, with variable cut-outs, to which may have been added the tail of a horse or yak (the Mongol &quot;tugh&quot;), topped with the crescent of Islam. During the Indian campaign, a black banner with a silver dragon was used. Before the campaign to China, however, Timur ordered the depiction of a golden dragon on the army&#x27;s banners.
There is little certainty about the actual flag of the Timurid Empire. Yuka Kadoi studied the possibility that the &quot;brown or originally silver flag with three circles or balls&quot; in the Catalan Atlas could be associated with the &quot;earlier dominions of the Timurid Empire&quot;, specifically referencing a flag raised over the city of &quot;Camull&quot; (the modern city of Khamil in Xinjiang). 

Yuka Kadoi also noted the existence of Timur&#x27;s umbrella detail with three-dots decorative motif, as well as some contemporary coins from Samarkand which also have the three circles as a motif. Beyond that, the evidence remains scant and ambiguous, but according to Kadoi &quot;one can reasonably conclude that the flag with a tri-partite motif had a certain iconographic association with the Timurid Empire&quot;. For other authors, the flag with the three red crescent moons (), which is seen all over Mongol dominions in eastern Asia in the Catalan Atlas (dated to 1375), is simply intended as the flag of the Empire of the Great Khan (Yuan China).

<text>Admiral of the Navy was the highest-possible rank in the United States Navy, prior to the creation of fleet admiral in 1944. The rank is considered to be at least equivalent to that of a five-star admiral, with Admiral George Dewey being the only officer to be appointed to the rank.

==History==
===Post-Spanish American War===
The rank has only been awarded once, to George Dewey, in recognition of his victory at Manila Bay in 1898. On March 2, 1899, Congress approved the creation of the grade of Admiral of the Navy. On March 3, President McKinley transmitted to the Senate his nomination of Dewey for the new grade, which was approved the same day. But McKinley&#x27;s nomination had used the term &quot;Admiral in the Navy,&quot; while the act creating the new grade had used &quot;Admiral of the Navy.&quot; On March 14, 1903, this discrepancy was addressed when President Roosevelt nominated and the Senate approved Dewey to the grade of &quot;Admiral of the Navy,&quot; retroactive to March 2, 1899. The Navy Register of 1904 listed Dewey for the first time as &quot;Admiral of the Navy&quot; instead of 
&quot;Admiral.&quot;

Though this clarified the grade&#x27;s unique title, the precedence of the new rank was still considered &quot;four star&quot;, equivalent to general in the army, in the US Navy Regulations of 1909. In the U.S. Navy Regulations of 1913, the gun salute for Admiral of the Navy was set to 19, the equivalent salute for a British field marshal or admiral of the fleet. More four-star officers were appointed after an act authorizing the temporary grade of admiral for three fleet commanders-in-chief was passed in 1915.

In terms of insignia, Dewey appears in a photograph soon after his promotion wearing the sleeve stripes last worn by Admiral David Dixon Porter, which are the same as present-day admirals (one two-inch band with three half-inch stripes above). When a new edition of US Navy Uniform Regulations was issued in May 1899, the sleeve insignia for admiral was specified as &quot;two strips of 2-inch gold lace, with one 1-inch strip between, set one-quarter of an inch apart.&quot; In the 1905 Uniform Regulations, a similar description was used but with the title &quot;Admiral of the Navy.&quot; The collar and shoulder insignia were four silver stars, with gold foul anchors under the two outermost stars. Unlike other U.S. four-star insignia, the stars pointed inwards to the center of the insignia, not upwards.

=== World War II ===

In 1944, with the establishment of the rank of fleet admiral, the Department of the Navy specified in a Bureau of Navigation memo that &quot;the rank of Fleet Admiral of the United States Navy shall be considered the senior most rank of the United States Navy&quot;. As Dewey had been deceased for nearly thirty years, no comparison between his rank and that of fleet admiral was made until 1945. At that time, during the preparations for Operation Downfall, the proposed invasion of Japan, the possibility was raised of promoting one of the serving United States Fleet Admirals to &quot;six-star rank&quot; should the Army take a similar measure by promoting Douglas MacArthur to the rank of General of the Armies.

As Congress was trying to create the rank of fleet admiral in 1944, the Navy wanted to re-establish and elevate Admiral of the Navy be equivalent to General of the Armies, but it could not legally do so without a congressional act. The Navy&#x27;s chief of naval personnel, Vice Admiral Randall Jacobs, testified before the Committee on Naval Affairs of the House of Representatives, recommending that the rank of Admiral of the Navy should be made equivalent to General of the Armies, but a previous bill submitted for its re-establishment on February 25, 1944, failed to be passed into law. Congress passed Pub.L. on December 14, 1944, creating the rank of fleet admiral, without re-establishing the rank of Admiral of the Navy. As such, the rank remained nonexistent. By 1955, the Navy concluded that the rank was honorary. And while it held to the belief that the rank was equivalent to General of the Armies, the Navy amended its regulations to establish fleet admiral as its highest achievable rank, adhering to the standard set by the law.

==Text of Act==

The act to create the grade of Admiral of the Navy read as follows:

Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the President is hereby authorized to appoint, by selection and promotion, an Admiral of the Navy, who shall not be placed upon the retired list except upon his own application; and whenever such office shall be vacated by death or otherwise the office shall cease to exist.

<text>Nikolayevsk-on-Amur () is a town in Khabarovsk Krai, Russia located on the Amur River close to its liman in the Pacific Ocean. Population: 17,815 (2024);

==History==
===Medieval and early-modern history===
In the late Middle Ages, the people living along the lower course of the Amur (Nivkh, Oroch, Evenki) were collectively known in China as the &quot;wild Jurchen&quot;. The Yuan dynasty Mongols sent expeditions to this area with an eye toward using the region as a base for attack on Japan, or for defending against the Sakhalin Ainus. According to the History of Yuan, in 1264 the Nivkhs recognized the Mongol sovereignty. In 1263, the Mongols set up the &quot;Command Post of the Marshal of the Eastern Campaign&quot; near the modern settlement of Tyr, some upstream from today&#x27;s Nikolayevsk-on-Amur. At roughly the same time, a shrine was built on the Tyr Rock.

From 1411 to 1433, the Ming eunuch Yishiha, a man of Haixi Jurchen origin, led four large missions to win over the allegiance of the &quot;Jurchen&quot; tribes along the Sunggari and Amur Rivers. During this time, the Yongning Temple was constructed at Tyr, and stelae with inscriptions erected.

===Russian period===
The Russian settlement, likely preceded by the Manchu village of Fuyori, was founded as Nikolayevsky Post by Gennady Nevelskoy on 13 August 1850 and named for Tsar Nicholas I.

The settlement quickly became one of the main economic centres on the Pacific coast of the Russian Empire. It became Russia&#x27;s main Pacific harbour (replacing Petropavlovsk) in 1855 after the Siege of Petropavlovsk of 1854. It was granted town status and renamed Nikolayevsk-on-Amur in 1856, when Primorskaya Oblast was established. Admiral Vasily Zavoyko supervised the construction of a naval base in Nikolayevsk-on-Amur.

The town emerged as an important commercial harbour; however, due to navigational difficulties caused by the sandbanks in the Amur estuary and because sea ice made the harbour unusable for five months each year, the main Russian shipping activities in the Pacific transferred to the better situated Vladivostok in the early 1870s. The town remained the administrative centre of this region until 1880, when the governor relocated to Khabarovsk. Anton Chekhov, visiting the town on his journey to Sakhalin in 1890, noted its rapid depopulation, although this trend slowed somewhat in the late 1890s with the discovery of gold and the establishment of salmon fisheries.

During the Russian Civil War of 1917–1922 the town&#x27;s population plummeted from 15,000 to 2,000, as a local Soviet partisan leader, Yakov Tryapitsyn, later executed by the same Bolsheviks he was supposed to be aligned with, razed the entire town to the ground and massacred the minority Japanese population along with most of the Russian population. In response to this event, Northern Sakhalin was briefly occupied by Japan between 1920 and 1925. During this time, the town was called .

Around 1940 a prison camp of the gulag system was located in the town.

Like many other places in the Russian Far East, the town has seen a drop in population since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, dropping from 36,296 inhabitants recorded in the (1989 Census), to 22,772 in 2010.

==Geography==
The town is situated on the left bank of the Amur River, from where it flows into the Amur estuary, north of Khabarovsk and from the Komsomolsk-on-Amur railway station. It is the closest significant settlement to the Strait of Tartary separating the mainland from Sakhalin.

===Climate===
Nikolayevsk-on-Amur has a borderline humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;), almost cold enough to be a subarctic climate (&quot;Dfc&quot;). Precipitation is not as low in the winter as over most of Siberia since the coast in on the fringe of influence from the Aleutian Low. The near-maritime location only marginally—by —moderates the winters compared to interior Siberia, but makes the summers noticeably cool (especially in May and June) though the Oyashio fogs are less prevalent than on Sakhalin itself and sunshine hours therefore rather longer.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Nikolayevsk-on-Amur serves as the administrative center of Nikolayevsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the town of krai significance of Nikolayevsk-na-Amure—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the town of krai significance of Nikolayevsk-na-Amure is incorporated within Nikolayevsky Municipal District as Nikolayevsk-na-Amure Urban Settlement.

==Economy==
Fishing and fish processing are the main industries of the town, along with ship maintenance and some agricultural production in the surrounding area.

==Transportation==
Nikolayevsk-on-Amur has no land transport connections. Traffic to and from the town enters via the port on the Amur, or the small airport, namely Nikolayevsk-on-Amur Airport , which is home to Nikolaevsk-Na-Amure Air Enterprise.

<text>Dick and Jane are the two protagonists created by Zerna Sharp for a series of basal readers written by William S. Gray to teach children to read. The characters first appeared in the &quot;Elson-Gray Readers&quot; in 1930 and continued in a subsequent series of books through the final version in 1965. These readers were used in classrooms in the United States and in other English-speaking countries for nearly four decades, reaching the height of their popularity in the 1950s, when 80 percent of first-grade students in the United States used them. Although the Dick and Jane series of primers continued to be sold until 1973 and remained in use in some classrooms throughout the 1970s, they were replaced with other reading texts by the 1980s and gradually disappeared from school curricula.

The Dick and Jane series were known for their simple narrative text and watercolor illustrations. For a generation of middle-class Americans, the characters of &quot;Dick&quot;, &quot;Jane&quot;, and their younger sister &quot;Sally&quot; became household words. The Dick and Jane primers have become icons of mid-century American culture and collectors&#x27; items.

Despite criticisms of the stereotypical content that depicted white, middle-class Americans and despite the &quot;whole-word&quot; or &quot;sight word&quot; (look-say) method of teaching reading on which these readers are based, they retain cultural significance for their impact on literacy education in the mid-twentieth century.

==Origins==
The predecessors to the Dick and Jane primers were the phonics-based McGuffey Readers, which were popular from the mid-nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century, and the &quot;Elson Basic Readers&quot;. William Scott Gray (1885–1960), director of the Curriculum Foundation Series at Scott, Foresman and Company and dean of the University of Chicago&#x27;s college of education, co-authored with William H. Elson the &quot;Elson Basic Readers&quot; (renamed the &quot;Elson-Gray Basic Readers&quot; in 1936), which Scott Foresman published in Chicago, Illinois. Gray&#x27;s research focused on methods to improve reading instruction using content that would be of interest to children and develop their word-recognition skills.

Zerna Sharp, a former teacher, came up with the idea for what became the Dick and Jane readers for elementary school children while working as a reading consultant and textbook editor for Scott Foresman. She worked with Gray to develop the readers after noting the reduced reading ability of children and urged the use of a new reading format for primers. In addition, Sharp developed the main characters of &quot;Dick&quot; and &quot;Jane&quot;, the older brother and sister in a fictional family that included &quot;Mother&quot;, &quot;Father&quot;, and a younger sister named &quot;Sally&quot;, their pets, &quot;Spot&quot; (originally a cat in the 1930s, but a dog in later editions), and &quot;Puff&quot;, their cat; and a toy teddy bear named &quot;Tim&quot;. Sharp named the characters, selected and edited the storylines from ideas that others submitted, and supervised production of the books. Gray and others wrote the Dick and Jane stories; illustrator Eleanor B. Campbell did most of the early illustrations.

&quot;Dick&quot; and &quot;Jane&quot; originally appeared in &quot;Elson-Gray Readers&quot; in 1930. Before the appearance of the first Dick and Jane stories, reading primers &quot;generally included Bible stories or fairy tales with complicated language and few pictures.&quot; After the Elson-Gray series ended in 1940, the characters continued in a subsequent series of primary readers that were later revised and enlarged into newer editions. The Dick and Jane readers were widely used in classrooms in the United States and in other English-speaking countries for nearly four decades and reached the height of their popularity in the 1950s, when 80 percent of first-grade students in the United States were learning to read though these stories. The 1965 edition, the last of the Dick and Jane series, introduced the first Black family as characters in a first-grade reader. Although the Dick and Jane series of primers continued to be sold until 1973 they remained in use in some classrooms throughout the 1970s. By the 1980s, the Dick and Jane stories had been replaced with other reading texts and gradually disappeared from school curricula. However, some believe they continue to serve as a model for restrictive reading practices in classrooms.

==Content and illustrations==
William Gray and Zerna Sharp worked together to develop readers that incorporated the whole-word or look-say method of word recognition (also called sight reading). The Dick and Jane primers introduced new readers to one new word on each page and only five new words in each individual story. Gray and Sharp also wanted children who read the books to be able to readily identify with the characters. Sharp chose stories where the characters participated in typical children&#x27;s activities.

The Dick and Jane primers taught reading as well as American middle-class values to school-aged children. The storylines described the lives and experiences of a stereotypical American middle-class, white family in their suburban home. &quot;Father&quot; wore a suit, worked in an office, mowed the lawn, and washed the car. &quot;Mother&quot; stayed at home, did housework, and raised the children. &quot;Dick&quot;, the oldest of the family&#x27;s three children, was active and well-behaved; &quot;Jane&quot;, the middle child, was pretty and carefree. She also helped care for &quot;Sally&quot;, the baby of the family.

The texts and illustrations for the Dick and Jane primers were intended to work together to help young readers understand the story. The texts introduced a repetitive pattern of words; the illustrations provided visual reinforcements to help convey the meaning of the words. The simple but distinctive illustrations for the books were done by artists Eleanor Campbell and Keith Ward. Robert Childress did the illustrations during the 1950s. Richard Wiley took over the illustrations in the 1960s. The Dick and Jane beginning readers became well known for their simple narrative text and watercolor illustrations. Because the primers were intended for nationwide distribution, the text and illustrations intentionally lacked references to specific regional geographical features such as mountains, rivers, lakes, plains, or the seashore.

Scott Foresman made changes in their readers in the 1960s in an effort to keep the stories relevant, updating the series every five years.

In 1965, Scott Foresman became the first publisher to introduce an African American family as characters in a first-grade reader series. The family included two parents and their three children: a son, &quot;Mike&quot;, and twin daughters, &quot;Pam&quot; and &quot;Penny&quot;.

In 1967, two years after Scott Foresman retired the Dick and Jane series, the company launched its Open Highways series, which included heavily illustrated classic children&#x27;s stories and poems, as well as placing greater emphasis on multicultural content and phonics training in its subsequent readers.

==Adaptations==
The Dick and Jane readers inspired other publishers to adopt a similar format, but Scott Foresman&#x27;s Dick and Jane series were the market leaders until the early 1960s, 
In Catholic editions of the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s series (including the Cathedral Basic Readers and the New Cathedral Basic Readers), the &quot;Sally&quot;, &quot;Dick&quot;, and &quot;Jane&quot; characters were renamed &quot;Judy&quot;, &quot;John&quot;, and &quot;Jean&quot; to reflect the names of Catholic saints. Another series, published by Ginn and Company, featured characters named &quot;David&quot; and &quot;Ann&quot;. Groups of stories in each book were replaced by Catholic-oriented stories of the saints or portrayed moral choices. Some 1960s grade-level readers also had Seventh-day Adventist versions that used the 1965 multi-ethnic characters with revised book title. For example, &quot;Now We Read&quot; became &quot;Friends to Know&quot; and &quot;Fun Wherever We Are&quot; became &quot;Places to Know&quot;. W. J. Gage published British English language versions in Canada with appropriate spelling changes. In lower grades French language versions also were issued in the 1950s in Canada, with the main characters renamed Jeanne, Paul, and Lise in these editions.

==Teaching methodology==
For three decades (roughly 1940 to 1970), the whole-word or look-say method (also called sight reading) on which the Dick and Jane readers were based remained the dominant reading method in American schools. Phonics-based reading methods came into fashion in the 1970s. The whole-language movement developed in the 1980s. Other methods were also in use for shorter periods before they were replaced as well. The look-say method used a controlled vocabulary and taught readers to memorize the words through repetition, placing less emphasis on teaching phonics Texts in the Dick and Jane readers repeated words within phrases such as Oh, oh!&#x27; said Jane. &#x27;It is Baby!&#x27; &#x27;It is Baby!&#x27; said Dick. Baby said, &#x27;See, see! Pretty, pretty kitten.&#x27; Dick and Jane laughed. &#x27;Funny, funny Baby,&#x27; said Dick.&quot; Teacher&#x27;s guides accompanying the texts also encouraged adoption of the whole-word (look-say) method of identifying the meaning of words from the illustrations and repeating words introduced in the text.

For this reason, the Dick and Jane readers came to be used less and less as overuse of systematic phonics replaced the more effective method of foundational literacy skills.

==Criticisms==
According to the history of the Institute for Juvenile Research, psychologist Marion Monroe developed methods for early childhood reading programs, which led to the Dick and Jane stories.

===Impact on students===
For decades, critics and advocates continued to debate the impact of the sight reading method and the primers that used it. Samuel T. Orton, a neuropathologist, warned educators in his article published in the February 1929 issue of the &quot;Journal of Educational Psychology&quot; that the look-say method would lead to reading disability. In &quot;Why Johnny Can&#x27;t Read&quot; (1955), author Rudolf Flesch concluded that the whole-word (look-say) method was ineffective because it lacked phonics training. In addition, Flesch was critical of the simple stories and limited text and vocabulary in the Dick-and-Jane-style readers that taught students to read through word memorization. Flesch and other critics also believed that the look-say method did not properly prepare students to read more complex materials in the upper grade levels. Arther Trace also criticized the Dick and Jane series in his book, &quot;Reading Without Dick and Jane&quot; (1965). In 2002, author Samuel L. Blumenfeld, a supporter of teaching reading skills with phonics reading, argued that the Dick and Jane series and others that used the whole-word, look-say, or sight-reading method caused poor reading skills among the millions of American students who learned to read using this method. Harold Henderson asserted in his book &quot;Let&#x27;s Kill Dick and Jane&quot; (2006) that the series focused on trivial aspects of reading and left children far behind their peers in Europe.

===Bias and stereotypes===
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, critics of the Dick and Jane readers began to point out its stereotypes; class, gender, and racial bias; and errors in content and illustrations. Critics objected to the Dick and Jane storylines and stereotyped roles, arguing that &quot;many students could not relate to family with two children, a dog named Spot, and a cat named Puff.&quot; Increasing social changes, including the civil rights movement in the 1960s and efforts to include a stronger presentation of other races and cultures in classroom texts, made the white, middle-class characters of &quot;Dick and Jane seem increasingly irrelevant to some.&quot; Zerna Sharp, who created the characters and edited the readers countered the harsh criticisms with the reply, &quot;That&#x27;s all an adult&#x27;s viewpoint.&quot;

Although the Dick and Jane primers were already declining in popularity by the mid-1960s, critics continued to attack the look-say method and the content of the readers, especially their gender stereotypes (i.e., the mother staying at home to take care of the children and keep house, while the father went to work, along with passive female characters such as Jane) and lack of racial and cultural diversity.

==Collectibles and reprint editions==
The primers that made the characters of &quot;Dick&quot;, &quot;Jane&quot;, and &quot;Sally&quot; household words have become icons of mid-century American culture, as well as collectors&#x27; items.

===Literature===

*Nobel Prize-winner Toni Morrison invents her own version of a Dick and Jane text in the opening chapter of her 1970 novel, &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot;, and the text is repeated with variations throughout the book to signify on the idyllic white family in their suburban setting, juxtaposing it with black families living in poverty in 1940, years after the Great Depression.

*&quot;3rd Rock from the Sun&quot; (1996–2001), a sitcom revolving around a man named Dick Solomon, often has episode titles based on book/movie titles or popular sayings, sometimes with the names of the show&#x27;s characters added in. Dick and Jane are the source for a number of these - e.g., &quot;See Dick Run,&quot; &quot;See Dick Continue to Run,&quot; &quot;Fun with Dick and Janet,&quot; etc.

===Video games===
*&quot;See Spot burn!&quot; is the catchphrase of Hot Dog, a playable character in the &quot;Skylanders&quot; game series; the catchphrase is a reference to &quot;See Spot run&quot;.

<text>Candela is a city in the central region &quot;(Región Centro)&quot; of the northern Mexican state of Coahuila. It is the municipal seat of the surrounding municipality of Candela. There were 1,669 inhabitants in 2000. In 2011, according to Wolfram Alpha, it had a population of 1,672.

It was founded in 1690 by General Alonso de León as a mission called San Bernardino de la Candela.

==Attractions==

Candela attracts people with its beautiful mountainous features and gaping deserts. There are three aquatic recreational areas in Candela: Los Carrisitos, Las Lajitas and El Ojo de Agua.
Los Carrisitos is made up of pools that are filled with clean mountain water. It is also a great place to go on a &quot;carne asada&quot; (term for a Mexican-style barbecue).

Las Lajitas is part of the Candela river which leads downstream to the town. It is notable for the shape of its rocks, hence the name &quot;Las Lajitas&quot;.

El Ojo de Agua is a spring of thermoheated waters. One can enjoy a skin renewal bath there.

Another noteworthy asset of Candela is that it boasts several vast ranch-estates in its vicinity, such as the Santa Lucia de Sanmiguel - one of a few hidden jewels amongst the mountains. Like other isolated mountain towns, Candela is a religiously cultured place. One well-known chapel that is near the previously mentioned ranch, a tiny, open-air structure erected in the honor of the Virgen of Guadalupe, is a place in which many ranchers and townspeople alike use as a sanctuary to lay roses and rosaries and to pray for their loved ones.

<doc id="668090" wikidata="Q994153" url="?curid=668090" title="Brunswick Corporation">
<text>Brunswick Corporation, formerly known as the Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company, is an American corporation that has been developing, manufacturing and marketing a wide variety of products since 1845. Brunswick has more than 13,000 employees operating in 24 countries. Brunswick owns major boating brands, including Sea Ray, Boston Whaler, Bayliner, Mercury Marine, Attwood, Lund, Crestliner, Mastervolt, MotorGuide, Harris Pontoons, Freedom Boat Club, Princecraft, Heyday, Lowe, Uttern, Quicksilver and CZone, among many others. In 2021, Brunswick reported sales of US$5.8 billion. Brunswick&#x27;s global headquarters is in the northern Chicago suburb of Mettawa, Illinois.

==History==
=== 19th century ===

Brunswick was founded by John Moses Brunswick who came to the United States from Switzerland at the age of 15. The J. M. Brunswick Manufacturing Company opened for business on September 15, 1845, in Cincinnati, Ohio. Originally J. M. Brunswick intended his company to be mainly in the business of making carriages, but soon after opening his machine shop, he became fascinated with billiards and decided that making billiard tables would be more lucrative, as the better tables then in use in the United States were imported from England. Brunswick billiard tables were a commercial success, and the business expanded and opened the first of what would become many branch offices in Chicago, Illinois, in 1848. It was later renamed J. M. Brunswick &amp; Brother by 1860, after a family member came on board, and the company&#x27;s slogan at this time was: &quot;The oldest and most extensive billiard table manufacturers in the United States&quot;.
In 1874, the Brunswick company merged with competitor Great Western Billiard Manufactory owned by Julius Balke to become the J. M. Brunswick &amp; Balke Company. It was incorporated in 1879 with a capital stock of $275,000, the same year it merged with another competitor, H. W. Collender Company of New York City (founded by Hugh W. Collender), to acquire Collender&#x27;s patented billiard cushions. In 1884, the partners formed the Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company (or Company for short) with capital of $1.5 million.

The company expanded into making a number of other products. Large ornate neo-classical style bars for saloons were a popular product. Bowling balls, pins, and equipment led a growing line of sporting equipment. It popularized bowling balls of manufactured materials, vulcanized rubber at first; earlier bowling balls had been solid wood.

=== 20th century ===
==== 1900–1949 ====

In the early 20th century, Brunswick expanded the product line to include such diverse products as toilet seats, automobile tires, and phonographs. In the late 1910s, they introduced a quickly popular line of disc phonograph records, under the name Brunswick Records. In 1930, Brunswick sold the control of the record company to Warner Brothers and came out with a line of refrigerators.

During World War II, Brunswick-Balke-Collender made small target-drone aircraft for the U.S. military.
After the war, Brunswick introduced a line of school furniture. In 1949, the Brunswick &quot;Model A&quot; Mechanical Pinsetter fully automated unit premiered, for the purpose of handling bowling pins for ten-pin bowling, in competition with American Machine and Foundry (AMF). Previously, Brunswick had made two models of semi-automated, manually operated &quot;spotting tables&quot; for the tenpin sport, that the &quot;Model A&quot; unit replaced.

A historical marker at 623 S. Wabash Ave. in Chicago was dedicated by the Illinois State Historical Society in 1995 at the site of Brunswick&#x27;s headquarters from 1913-1964. The building today is used by Columbia College Chicago. 

==== 1950–1999 ====

The 1950s also saw the introduction of a line of golfing equipment to compete with AMF in the leisure-products and sporting-goods markets.

The Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company officially changed its name to the Brunswick Corporation on April 10, 1960. The following year the company reported sales of $422 million. Brunswick acquired Mercury Marine in 1961. In the 1970s, Brunswick introduced the automatic scorer, which electronically tallied the score instead of the bowler doing it by hand.

The Brunswick Corporation patented a machine gun using a delayed blowback operation via a fluted chamber as part of the weapon&#x27;s operation. Another platform was the Rifleman&#x27;s Assault Weapon, an unusual grenade launcher that used a spherical rocket propelled grenade.

In the 1980s, Brunswick became a major maker of yachts and pleasure boats, under brands including Bayliner, Boston Whaler, Maxum, Sea Ray, and Trophy.

During the Gulf War, Brunswick supplied the military with camouflage nets. They also made radomes for the Patriot missile.

In 1997, Brunswick purchased the Roadmaster bicycle division, one of the last U.S. manufacturers of low-cost, mass-market bicycles. However, it became apparent that continued U.S. manufacture of such products was not viable in the presence of surging low-priced imports from overseas producers, primarily China. In 1999, Brunswick sold its Roadmaster bicycle division and brand to Pacific Cycle.

=== 21st century ===
==== 2000s ====
As of the early 21st century, the Brunswick Corporation still manufactured sporting and fitness equipment (Life Fitness, Hammer Strength, Parabody) in addition to boats (Sea Ray, Bayliner, Maxum, etc.) and marine engines under the Mercury Marine brand name.

In 2001, Brunswick acquired Hatteras Yachts from Genmar Industries for approximately $80 million in cash. Brunswick sold its Hatteras/Cabo brand in 2013 to Versa Capital Management.

In 2004, Brunswick acquired Lowe Boats. The same year, the company also purchased Northstar Technologies, a leading marine electronics provider based in Acton, Massachusetts, from Canadian Marconi Corporation (now CMC Electronics, a wholly owned subsidiary of Esterline Technologies Corporation). Brunswick then merged Navman, based in Auckland, New Zealand, with Northstar to make Northstar/Navman a supplier to the Brunswick Boat Groups. Brunswick also acquired Mx-Marine. When George Buckley, CEO at the time, left to join 3M in 2006, new leadership decided to sell Northstar, Navman and Mx-Marine. Navico now owns those three brands in addition to the Eagle, Lowrance, B&amp;G, and Simrad lines.
Brunswick has established regional headquarters in Verviers, Belgium; Monterrey, Mexico; Dandenong, Australia; and Dubai, UAE, to better serve its customers by designing, engineering, manufacturing and distributing products based on local needs, using local talent.

==== 2010s ====
On July 17, 2014, Brunswick announced plans to leave the bowling business by the end of 2014. The company disclosed that it had agreed to sell its bowling center business, which brought in $187 million in revenue in the prior year, to competitor Bowlmor AMF (now known as Bowlero Corporation) for $270 million. It also disclosed that it had retained Lazard to find a buyer for its bowling equipment and products business. The company said it was making these changes to focus on its “core” Marine and Fitness businesses, which provided 92% of company net revenues in 2013. It would retain its heritage billiards business and report billiards financial results as part of the Fitness segment. The sale of the bowling center business to Bowlmor AMF (Bowlero) was completed in September 2014.

Brunswick completed its exit from the bowling business in May 2015 with the sale of its bowling equipment and products division to BlueArc Capital Management, a private investment firm. BlueArc completed the acquisition with investments from Gladstone Investment Corporation, and Capitala Finance Corp. BlueArc continues to produce bowling balls under the Brunswick and DV8 brand names, and on November 15, 2019, it acquired Ebonite International and all of its bowling product brands.

In August 2018, Brunswick Corporation acquired Power Products – Global Marine &amp; Mobile business, which includes the global marine, specialty vehicle, mobile, industrial power, and transportation aftermarket products businesses of Power Products, for $910 million in cash from San Francisco-based private equity firm Genstar Capital.

Also in 2018, the company announced it would be separating the fitness business as Life Fitness Holdings in 2019. In May 2019, Brunswick announced the sale of Brunswick Billiards, Life Fitness, Cybex, Hammer Strength, Indoor Cycling Group, and SCIFIT for $490 million to KPS Capital Partners. The sale was completed in June 2019.

In May 2019, Brunswick announced it would be purchasing the largest marine franchisor in the United States, Freedom Boat Club.

Also in 2019, Brunswick announced a new business structure, Advanced Systems Group (ASG) and named Brett Dibkey as President. ASG is composed of 11 Power Products brands combined with the Attwood Group of businesses including Attwood, Garelick, MotorGuide, and Whale – as well as NAUTIC-ON.

==== 2020s ====
On October 4, 2021, Brunswick Corporation announced that it has completed its acquisition of Navico, a global leader in marine electronics and sensors for $1.05 billion, adding to Brunswick the industry leading Navico brands of Lowrance, Simrad, B&amp;G, and C-MAP.

<text>Claire Patricia Grogan (born 17 March 1962), known professionally as Clare Grogan or sometimes as C. P. Grogan, is a Scottish actress and singer. She is best known as the lead singer of the 1980s new wave music group Altered Images, as well as for supporting roles in the 1981 film &quot;Gregory&#x27;s Girl&quot; and the science fiction sitcom &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; as the first incarnation of Kristine Kochanski.

==Early life==
Born in Glasgow, Grogan and her two sisters all attended the Notre Dame Convent School. Her mother was Irish and born in Dublin.

Aged 17, while she was dancing at the Glasgow College of Technology, a fight broke out nearby between several patrons. Grogan attempted to head away from the violence but was injured by thrown broken glass, causing a deep facial wound and a prominent scar on the left side of her face. Grogan states her parents still find it hard to read about the incident. She began filming &quot;Gregory&#x27;s Girl&quot; just three months after the incident. In 1998, while she was working in a theatre at Watford, it was discovered that part of the glass was still in the facial tissue and had to be surgically removed.

==Acting career==
===Theatre===
As a member of Scottish Youth Theatre, she was originally obliged to appear as &quot;C. P. Grogan&quot; because there was already a member of Equity named Claire Grogan. (The other Claire Grogan went on to become a photographer.) She would later drop the &quot;i&quot; from her first name.

Grogan played the part of Rita in &quot;Educating Rita&quot; at Dundee Repertory Theatre in 1987.

In 1996, she played a fitness instructor on the Edinburgh Fringe in the play &quot;Lady Macbeth Firmed My Buttocks&quot;.

===Film and television===
While working as a waitress at the Spaghetti Factory restaurant in Glasgow, she was spotted by film director Bill Forsyth. This led to her breakthrough acting role in 1981&#x27;s &quot;Gregory&#x27;s Girl&quot; as Susan. Because of her facial wound there were objections from the producers, but Forsyth refused to recast the role and Grogan was filmed mostly in profile. When filmed in close up, makeup artists covered Grogan&#x27;s scar with Derma wax.

In 1984, she played Charlotte in Forsyth&#x27;s &quot;Comfort and Joy&quot;. In 1985, she was the receptionist in the BBC Television version of &quot;Blott on the Landscape&quot;. Grogan appeared in the second episode of the acclaimed &quot;The Monocled Mutineer&quot; in 1986. She had a recurring role playing Dave Lister&#x27;s would-be love-interest, Kristine Kochanski, in series 1, 2 and 6 of the TV show &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;. However, she was later deemed too old for the role. Grogan has also appeared in &quot;Father Ted&quot; (episode &quot;Rock-a-Hula Ted&quot;) in a thinly veiled parody of Sinéad O&#x27;Connor and in &quot;EastEnders&quot; as Ian Beale&#x27;s love interest, Ros Thorne (1997–1998).

In 1992, Grogan appeared as Mary Catto in series 8 episode 21 of &quot;Taggart&quot; (again credited as C.P. Grogan).

She had the role of Maggie in a 1998 comedy &quot;Jilting Joe&quot;, played an eye surgeon in a 2002 short film &quot;Bury It&quot;, appeared in &quot;Doctors&quot; in 2003, and performed another Edinburgh Fringe play &quot;Forbidden&quot; in 2004, as Lily, married to a WW2 Nazi officer but falling in love with a young Jewish woman.

In 2006, Grogan portrayed Sandra Reeves, a control-freak office manager, in the film &quot;The Penalty King&quot; played Cathy in an episode of &quot;Sea of Souls&quot;, and May, Danny&#x27;s mother, in the Scottish sit-com &quot;Legit&quot;. She appeared in the video for Peter Kay and Matt Lucas&#x27; charity single &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Be (500 Miles)&quot;, recorded for Comic Relief&#x27;s Red Nose Day 2007, along with two TV films &quot;Wedding Belles&quot; and &quot;Forgiven&quot;.

Grogan had a role in the 2011 TV series &quot;Skins&quot; as Shelley, mother of Mini McGuinness and played Jenny Ferris in the Scottish gangster film &quot;The Wee Man&quot; in 2013.

She starred as Myriam in the 2017 film &quot;Delirium&quot;, filmed entirely at Royal Holloway, University of London.

Grogan co-presented, alongside Gary Maclean, BBC Scotland&#x27;s &quot;Corner Shop Cook-Off&quot;. The six episode series originally aired from 19 February to 25 March 2020.

==Music career==
Grogan developed her singing career as the lead singer of Altered Images, originally a five-piece band that included Johnny McElhone (later of the Scottish rock band Texas), whom she met while studying for her Highers exams. It became a four-person band with the departure of two members and the addition of Stephen Lironi, who played both guitar and drums. The band had several hits in the early 1980s, including &quot;Happy Birthday&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Talk to Me About Love&quot;, &quot;I Could Be Happy&quot; and &quot;See Those Eyes&quot;. The group split up after the release of their third album, &quot;Bite&quot; (1983).

In 1984, Grogan made a cameo appearance in the music video to &quot;Young at Heart&quot; by The Bluebells.

Grogan later attempted a solo career, but after her single &quot;Love Bomb&quot; failed to gain chart success in 1987, her album &quot;Trash Mad&quot; was never released. Grogan formed Universal Love School in 1989 with Lironi, performing a series of gigs around the UK. However, it was short-lived and produced no hit singles. In 2000, she contributed vocals to the song &quot;Night Falls Like a Grand Piano&quot; on The 6ths&#x27; album &quot;Hyacinths and Thistles&quot;. She recorded a version of &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot; for the Frankie Miller tribute album. The track &quot;Her Hooped Dream&quot; appears on &quot;The Ultimate Celtic Album&quot;.

In 2002, Grogan performed as Altered Images on the Here and Now Tour which featured other well known artists from the 1980s. She performed on similar tours in 2005, 2008 and 2009. She appeared with Chesney Hawkes, Toyah Willcox and Limahl as The 80s Supergroup in the 2011 series of &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance for Comic Relief&quot;.

Grogan sometimes covers for radio presenters on BBC 6 Music.

Grogan appeared in Series 2, Episode 2 of John Shuttleworth&#x27;s Lounge Music on BBC Radio 4 on 27 November 2016.

Clare Grogan is the inspiration for the song &quot;True&quot; by Spandau Ballet.

Grogan began presenting shows on Absolute Radio 80s from 11 September 2017, presenting Monday to Thursday 8-9pm and Sundays 7-9pm.

In 2021, Grogan duetted with Sharleen Spiteri on the track &quot;Look What You&#x27;ve Done&quot;, from &quot;Hi&quot;, the tenth album released by Johnny McElhone&#x27;s band Texas.

==Writing==
Grogan&#x27;s first book was published in October 2008, a children&#x27;s novel (aimed at age 7 and up) titled &quot;Tallulah and the Teenstars&quot;, about a girl, Tallulah Gosh, who forms a pop band.

In 2015, it was followed by &quot;Tallulah On Tour&quot;.

Tallulah Gosh was an alias Grogan thought of using at the start of her career because Equity had already registered a Claire Grogan and a more showbiz name might help her career, but Bill Forsyth persuaded her that she would come to regret it.

The band Talulah Gosh took their name from the headline of an interview with Grogan in NME.

==Personal life==
Grogan married bandmate Stephen Lironi in Glasgow in 1994. They live in Haringey in north London, and adopted a daughter in 2005.

<text>A lesson or class is a structured period of time where learning is intended to occur. It involves one or more students (also called pupils or learners in some circumstances) being taught by a teacher or instructor. A lesson may be either one section of a textbook (which, apart from the printed page, can also include multimedia) or, more frequently, a short period of time during which learners are taught about a particular subject or taught how to perform a particular activity. Lessons are generally taught in a classroom but may instead take place in a situated learning environment.

In a wider sense, a lesson is an insight gained by a learner into previously unfamiliar subject-matter. Such a lesson can be either planned or accidental, enjoyable or painful. The colloquial phrase &quot;to teach someone a lesson&quot;, means to punish or scold a person for a mistake they have made in order to ensure that they do not make the same mistake again.

Lessons can also be made entertaining. When the term &quot;education&quot; is combined with &quot;entertainment&quot;, the term &quot;edutainment&quot; is coined.

==Types of lessons==
The potential format and speaks to one or more people in the same room or space. This may be supplemented with gestures and tools. A lesson may range from a lecture, to a demonstration, to a discussion or a blend of some of these common presentation methods.

Some lessons may involve work by the student. Traditionally this might include reading and writing or creating something, perhaps when the instructor is not present. The student may work independently or collaborate with others.

More recent technologies have expanded the way a lesson can be delivered. For example: film strips, pre-recorded audio and video tapes, television programs and podcasts are some ways to deliver or add to a lesson. Distance education techniques such as video conferencing, or electronic learning in a virtual learning environment have allowed interactive lessons to be presented to students who may not be in the same physical location. These tools offer new synchronous, asynchronous and blended ways to deliver lessons.

==Lesson plan==

Teachers and instructors usually have a lesson plan which dictates the structure of the teaching. A group of lessons may be linked together in a unit plan, scheme, or work. The detail of the plan may vary with some being a simple list of what is going to be taught in a lesson with others working including much more detail, such as a time plan and the learning aims and objectives. Student teachers and beginning teachers are usually advised to put a great amount of detail into the written plan. This ensures that the plan will be cohesive, that all the components of a successful lesson are taken care of, and that one has a checklist to ensure that practicalities are taken care of (e.g., resources, scheduling, and classroom management considerations). Furthermore, beginning teachers are often advised to script some sections for themselves, such as questions they might ask the students in order to get a discussion going at the beginning of the lesson. The expectation is that the teachers can and should depart from the script when appropriate; improvisation is definitely encouraged and the fact of having written it out in advance ensures that an adequate amount of thought has been put into it ahead of time. Another reason for including a great amount of detail is that student teachers are often required to submit lesson plans in advance to their mentor teachers or professors in order to receive feedback on their ideas. When creating the lesson plan it is usual to look at the following:
* The aims (the broader goals of the lesson, what it is reaching towards)
* The objectives (the specific, measurable outcomes of the lesson – the particular skills or knowledge students should have acquired by its conclusion)
* The number of attendees and the student-teacher ratio
* The previous knowledge of the learners (which may or may not be the same for all) and how this will be activated at the start of the lesson
* The motivation of the learners (school students, for example, have no choice but to attend so the teacher must build some kind of motivation into the lesson)
* The time required for each section of teaching and learning
* The resources required and available
* Catering for the different needs (cultural differences, learning styles, special needs) of the individuals
* How the lesson is to be evaluated

==Etymology==
The word &quot;lesson&quot; comes from Latin &quot;lectio&quot; &quot;the action of reading (out)&quot;. From there, the word was also used for the text itself, very often a passage from the Bible read out during a religious service (&quot;first lesson&quot;, &quot;second lesson&quot;). Finally, any portion of a book to be studied was referred to as a &quot;lesson&quot;.

<text>Caterpillar Inc., also known as Cat, is an American construction, mining and other engineering equipment manufacturer. The company is the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of construction equipment.
In 2018, Caterpillar was ranked number 73 on the &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 list and number 265 on the Global &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 list. Caterpillar stock is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Caterpillar Inc. traces its origins to the 1925 merger of the Holt Manufacturing Company and the C. L. Best Tractor Company, creating a new entity, California-based Caterpillar Tractor Company. In 1986, the company reorganized itself as a Delaware corporation under the current name, Caterpillar Inc. It announced in January 2017 that over the course of that year, it would relocate its headquarters from Peoria, Illinois, to Deerfield, Illinois, scrapping plans from 2015 of building an $800 million new headquarters complex in downtown Peoria. Its headquarters are located in Irving, Texas, since 2022.

The company also licenses and markets a line of clothing and workwear boots under its Cat / Caterpillar name. Additionally, the company licensed the Cat phone brand of toughened mobile phones and rugged smartphones from 2012 to 2024. Caterpillar machinery and other company-branded products are recognizable by their trademark &quot;Caterpillar Yellow&quot; livery and the &quot;CAT&quot; logo.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
The company traces its roots to the steam tractor machines manufactured by the Holt Manufacturing Company in 1890. The steam tractors of the 1890s and early 1900s were extremely heavy, sometimes weighing per horsepower, and often sank into the earth of the San Joaquin Valley Delta farmland surrounding Stockton, California. Benjamin Holt attempted to fix the problem by increasing the size and width of the wheels up to tall and wide, producing a tractor wide, but this also made the tractors increasingly complex, expensive, and difficult to maintain.

Another solution considered was to lay a temporary plank road ahead of the steam tractor, but this was time-consuming, expensive, and interfered with earthmoving. Holt thought of wrapping the planks around the wheels. He replaced the wheels on a Holt steamer, No. 77, with a set of wooden tracks bolted to chains. On Thanksgiving Day, November 24, 1904, he successfully tested the updated machine plowing the soggy delta land of Roberts Island.

Contemporaneously, Richard Hornsby &amp; Sons in Grantham, Lincolnshire, England, developed a steel plate-tracked vehicle, which it patented in 1904. This tractor was the first to be steered using differential braking of the tracks, eliminating the forward tiller and steering wheel. Several tractors were made and sold to operate in the Yukon, one example of which was in operation until 1927, and remnants of it still exist. Hornsby found a limited market for their tractor, so they sold their patent to Holt five years after its development.

Company photographer Charles Clements, looking at the machine&#x27;s upside-down image through his camera lens, commented that the track rising and falling over the carrier rollers looked like a caterpillar, and Holt seized on the metaphor. &quot;Caterpillar it is. That&#x27;s the name for it!&quot; Some sources, though, attribute this name to British soldiers who had witnessed trials of the Hornsby tractor in July 1907. Two years later, Holt sold his first steam-powered tractor crawlers for US$5,500, about US$185,000 in 2024. Each side featured a track frame measured high by wide and were long. The tracks were by redwood slats.

Holt received the first patent for a practical continuous track for use with a tractor on December 7, 1907, for his improved &quot;Traction Engine&quot; (&quot;improvement in vehicles, and especially of the traction engine class; and included endless traveling platform supports upon which the engine is carried&quot;).

=== Headquarters locations ===

On February 2, 1910, Holt opened up a plant in East Peoria, Illinois, led by his nephew Pliny Holt. There, Pliny met farm implement dealer Murray Baker, who knew of an empty factory that had been recently built to manufacture farm implements and steam traction engines. Baker, who later became the first executive vice president of what became Caterpillar Tractor Company, wrote to Holt headquarters in Stockton and described the plant of the bankrupt Colean Manufacturing Co. of East Peoria.
On October 25, 1909, Pliny Holt purchased the factory, and immediately began operations with 12 employees. Holt incorporated it as the Holt Caterpillar Company, although he did not trademark the name Caterpillar until August 2, 1910.

The addition of a plant in the Midwest, despite the hefty capital needed to retool the plant, proved so profitable that only two years later, the company employed 625 people and was exporting tractors to Argentina, Canada, and Mexico. Tractors were built in both Stockton and East Peoria.

On January 31, 2017, the company announced plans to move their headquarters from Peoria to Deerfield, Illinois, by the end of 2017. The new location at 500 Lake Cook Road is the former site of a Fiatallis plant that manufactured wheel loaders for many years.

On June 14, 2022, the company announced plans to move its global headquarters from Deerfield, Illinois, to Irving, Texas, beginning later in the year, citing &quot;the best strategic interest of the company.&quot;

=== Use in World War I ===
The first tanks used in WWI were manufactured by William Foster &amp; Co., also in Lincolnshire, England, and were introduced to the battlefield in 1916. That company had collaborated with Hornsby in the development of the vehicles demonstrated to the British military in 1907, providing the paraffin (kerosene) engines.

Holt&#x27;s track-type tractors played a support role in World War I. Even before the U.S. formally entered WWI, Holt had shipped 1,200 tractors to England, France, and Russia for agricultural purposes. These governments, however, sent the tractors directly to the battlefront, where the military put them to work hauling artillery and supplies. When World War I broke out, the British War Office ordered a Holt tractor and put it through trials at Aldershot. The War Office was suitably impressed and chose it as a gun tractor. Over the next four years, the Holt tractor became a major artillery tractor, mainly used to haul medium guns such as the 6-inch howitzer, the 60-pounder, and later the 9.2-inch howitzer.

Holt tractors were also the inspiration for the development of the British tank, which profoundly altered ground warfare tactics. Major Ernest Swinton, sent to France as an army war correspondent, very soon saw the potential of a track-laying tractor. Although the British later chose an English firm to build its first tanks, the Holt tractor became &quot;one of the most important military vehicles of all time.&quot;

=== Postwar challenges ===
Holt tractors had become well known during World War I. Military contracts formed the major part of the company&#x27;s production. When the war ended, Holt&#x27;s planned expansion to meet the military&#x27;s needs was abruptly terminated. The heavy-duty tractors needed by the military were unsuitable for farmers. The company&#x27;s situation worsened when artillery tractors were returned from Europe, depressing prices for new equipment and Holt&#x27;s unsold inventory of military tractors. The company struggled with the transition from wartime boom to peacetime bust. To keep the company afloat, they borrowed heavily.

C. L. Best Gas Tractor Company, formed by Clarence Leo Best in 1910, and Holt&#x27;s primary competitor, had during the war received government support, enabling it to supply farmers with the smaller agricultural tractors they needed. As a result, Best had gained a considerable market advantage over Holt by war&#x27;s end. Best also assumed considerable debt to allow it to continue expansion, especially the production of its new Best Model 60 &quot;Tracklayer&quot;.

Both companies were adversely impacted by the transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy, which contributed to a nationwide depression, further inhibiting sales. On December 5, 1920, 71-year-old Benjamin Holt died after a month-long illness.

=== Caterpillar company formed (1925) ===
The banks and bankers who held the company&#x27;s large debt forced the Holt board of directors to accept their candidate, Thomas A. Baxter, to succeed Benjamin Holt. Baxter initially cut the large tractors from the company&#x27;s product line and introduced smaller models focused on the agricultural market. When the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921 funded a US$1 billion federal highway building program, Baxter began refocusing the company towards building road-construction equipment. Both companies also faced fierce competition from the Fordson company.

Between 1907 and 1918, Best and Holt had spent about US$1.5 million in legal fees fighting each other in a number of contractual, trademark, and patent infringement lawsuits. Harry H. Fair of the bond brokerage house of Pierce, Fair &amp; Company of San Francisco had helped to finance C. L. Best&#x27;s debt and Holt shareholders approached him about their company&#x27;s financial difficulty. Fair recommended that the two companies should merge. In April and May 1925, the financially stronger C. L. Best merged with the market leader Holt Caterpillar to form the Caterpillar Tractor Co.

The new company was headquartered in San Leandro until 1930, when under the terms of the merger, it was moved to Peoria. Baxter had been removed as CEO earlier in 1925, and Clarence Leo Best assumed the title of CEO, and remained in that role until October 1951.

The Caterpillar company consolidated its product lines, offering only five track-type tractors: the 2 Ton, 5 Ton, and 10 Ton from the Holt Manufacturing Company&#x27;s old product line and the and from the C. L. Best Tractor Co.&#x27;s former product line. The 10 Ton and 5 Ton models were discontinued in 1926. In 1928, the 2 Ton was discontinued. Sales the first year were US$13 million. By 1929, sales climbed to US$52.8 million, and Caterpillar continued to grow throughout the Great Depression of the 1930s.

Caterpillar adopted the diesel engine to replace gasoline engines. During World War II, Caterpillar products found fame with the Seabees, construction battalions of the United States Navy, which built airfields and other facilities in the Pacific Theater of Operations. Caterpillar ranked 44th among United States corporations in the value of wartime military production contracts. During the postwar construction boom, the company grew at a rapid pace, and launched its first venture outside the U.S. in 1950, marking the beginning of Caterpillar&#x27;s development into a multinational corporation.

In 2018, Caterpillar was in the process of restructuring, closing a demonstration center in Panama and an engine-manufacturing facility in Illinois.

=== Expansion in developing markets ===

Caterpillar built its first Russian facility in the town of Tosno, located near St. Petersburg, Russia. It was completed in 16 months, occupied in November 1999, and began fabricating machine components in 2000. It had the first electrical substation built in the Leningrad Oblast since the Communist government was dissolved on December 26, 1991. The facility was built under harsh winter conditions, where the temperature was below . The facility construction was managed by the Lemminkäinen Group in Helsinki, Finland.

In May 2022, production at the Tosno plant was stopped. In November 2023, an agreement was reached on the sale of Caterpillar assets to the Russian company PSK - New Solutions, founded by people from Sberbank. Experts believe that the resumption of Caterpillar production is unlikely and the plant will be repurposed.

The $125 million Caterpillar Suzhou, People&#x27;s Republic of China facility, manufactures medium-wheel loaders and motor graders, primarily for the Asian market. The first machine was scheduled for production in March 2009. URS Ausino, in San Francisco, California, manages facility construction.

Caterpillar has manufactured in Brazil since 1960. In 2010 the company announced plans to further expand production of backhoe and small wheel loaders with a new factory.

Caterpillar has been manufacturing machines, engines, and generator sets in India, as well. Caterpillar has three facilities in India, which are in Tamil Nadu (Thiruvallur and Hosur) and Maharastra (Aurangabad).

=== Acquisitions ===

In addition to increasing sales of its core products, much of Caterpillar&#x27;s growth has been through acquisitions, including:

=== Divestitures ===

Caterpillar occasionally divests assets that do not align with its core competencies.



==Business lines==
Through fiscal year 2010, Caterpillar divided its products, services, and technologies into three principal lines of business: machinery, engines, and financial products for sale to private and governmental entities. As of 2022, Caterpillar reports its financials using four business segments: construction industries, resource industries, energy &amp; transportation, and financial products.

===Machinery===

Caterpillar has a list of some 400 products for purchase through its dealer network. Caterpillar&#x27;s line of machines range from tracked tractors to hydraulic excavators, backhoe loaders, motor graders, off-highway trucks, wheel loaders, agricultural tractors, and locomotives. Caterpillar machinery is used in the construction, road-building, mining, forestry, energy, transportation, and material-handling industries.

Caterpillar is the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of wheel loaders. The small size wheel loaders (SWL) are designed and manufactured at facilities in Clayton, North Carolina. The medium size (MWL) and large size (LWL) are designed at their Aurora, Illinois facility. Medium wheel loaders are manufactured at: Aurora, Illinois; Sagamihara, Kanagawa, Japan; Piracicaba, São Paulo, Brazil; India; and the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Large wheel loaders are manufactured exclusively in the United States on three separate assembly lines at Aurora, Illinois.

===On-road trucks===
Caterpillar began selling a line of on-road trucks in 2011, the Cat CT660, a Class 8 vocational truck.
As of March 2016, Caterpillar has ceased production of on-highway vocational trucks stating that “Remaining a viable competitor in this market would require significant additional investment to develop and launch a complete portfolio of trucks, and upon an updated review, we determined there was not a sufficient market opportunity to justify the investment,” said Ramin Younessi, vice president with responsibility for Caterpillar&#x27;s Industrial Power Systems Division. “We have not yet started truck production in Victoria, and this decision allows us to exit this business before the transition occurs.”

===Engines and gas turbines===

A portion of Caterpillar&#x27;s business is in the manufacturing of diesel and natural gas engines and gas turbines which, in addition to their use in the company&#x27;s own vehicles, are used as the prime movers in locomotives, semi trucks, marine vessels, and ships, as well as providing the power source for peak-load power plants and emergency generators.

Caterpillar 3116 engine was used up until 1997, when Caterpillar introduced the inline 6 cylinder 7.2 litre Caterpillar 3126 engine as its first electronic diesel engine for light trucks and buses. Caterpillar decreased emissions and noise the next year in the 3126B version of the engine, and improved emissions further in 2002 with the 3126E which had an improved high-pressure oil pump and improved electronics. In 2003 Caterpillar started selling a new version of this engine called the C-7 to meet increased United States emission standards that came into effect in 2004; it had the same overall design as the 3126 version, but with improved fuel injectors and electronics which included its new Advanced Combustion Emissions Reduction Technology (ACERT) system. In 2007, as ultra-low-sulfur diesel became required in North America, Caterpillar updated the C7 to use common rail fuel injectors and improved ACERT electronics.

In 1998 Caterpillar purchased Perkins Engines of Peterborough, England, a maker of small diesel and gasoline engines. Perkins engines are used in various applications. Perkins engine products are dual branded with the Perkins nameplate for both loose and OEM engines, and the CAT nameplate for captive engines within Caterpillar products.

In June 2008, Caterpillar announced it would be exiting the on-highway diesel engine market in the United States before updated 2010 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) emission standards took effect, as costly changes to the engines, which only constituted a small percentage of Caterpillar&#x27;s total engine sales, would be likely.

In October 2010, Caterpillar announced it would buy German engine-manufacturer MWM GmbH from 3i for $810 million.

=== Caterpillar Defense Products ===

The Caterpillar Defence Products subsidiary, headquartered in Shrewsbury, United Kingdom, provides diesel engines, automatic transmissions, and other parts for the UK&#x27;s Titan armored bridge layer, Trojan combat engineering tank, Terrier combat engineering vehicles, and tank transporters; the Romanian MLI-84 armored personnel carrier; and the Swiss Piranha III light armored vehicle, which is currently being developed for use by American light armored formations; large fleets of military trucks in both the U.S. and UK; and the CV90 family of infantry fighting vehicles used by the armies of Sweden, Norway, Finland, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Denmark.

This division also provides both propulsion engines and power generation systems to the naval shipbuilding industry, such as the Series 3512B turbocharged V-12 diesel engine for American nuclear submarines. Caterpillar diesel engines are also used in s, Spanish s, British s, Mexican patrol boats, and Malaysian MEKO A-100 offshore patrol vessels. The poor network security of the Caterpillar engines put the United States&#x27; submarine force at risk for cyberattack. In a 2015 interview on cybersecurity, the United States Navy clarified that Caterpillar actually has some of the most secure control systems. It will be used as a model of how the Navy will design cyber protections into its control systems.

The Israel Defense Forces&#x27; use of highly modified Caterpillar D9 bulldozers has led to Caterpillar being criticized by pro-Palestinian activists and some shareholders. In particular, the IDF Caterpillar D9 was involved in an incident in 2003, in which the American activist Rachel Corrie was killed by an Israeli soldier driving a bulldozer to demolish Gaza homes. A lawsuit against Caterpillar by her family and families of Palestinians, who were also killed by Caterpillar equipment, was unsuccessful. A lawsuit against Israel and Israeli Defense Ministry was rejected by an Israeli court, ruling that her death was an accident, caused by restricted field of view from the heavily armored operators&#x27; cabin. In 2014 Presbyterian Church (USA) sold its shares in Caterpillar citing the use of Caterpillar bulldozers involved in demolitions of Palestinian houses and Israeli surveillance activities in the West Bank. In August 2024, San Francisco State University announced that, as part of a deal with student activists, it would divest from four companies that supply weapons for the Israeli army, among them Caterpillar.

===Caterpillar Electronics===
The Caterpillar Electronics business unit has formed Caterpillar Trimble Control Technologies LLC (CTCT), a 50:50 joint venture with Trimble Inc. CTCT develops positioning and control products for earthmoving and paving machines in the construction and mining industries, using technologies such as GNSS, optical total stations, lasers, and sonics. The products are used in a range of applications where the operator of the machine benefits from having accurate horizontal and vertical guidance. CTCT is based in Dayton, Ohio, and started its operations on April 1, 2002.

===Agriculture products===
Caterpillar introduced the &quot;Challenger&quot; range of agricultural tractors as the result of several development programs over a long period of time. The program started in the 1970s and involved both the D6-based units and the Grader power units. A parallel program was also developing wheeled high hp tractors based on using the articulated loading shovel chassis was later merged with the crawler team. The result was the Challenger Tractor and the &quot;Mobi-Trac&quot; system.

The Challenger has been marketed in Europe as Claas machines since 1997, with Caterpillar marketing the Claas-built Lexion combine range in the USA. Claas and Caterpillar formed a joint venture, &quot;Claas Omaha&quot;, to build combine harvesters in Omaha, Nebraska, USA under the &quot;CAT&quot; brand. In 2002, Cat sold its stake to Claas, and licensed the use of &quot;CAT&quot; and the CAT yellow livery to Claas. They are marketed as &quot;Lexion&quot; combines now.

Also in 2002, Caterpillar sold the &quot;Challenger&quot; tracked tractor business to AGCO and licensed the use of the Challenger and CAT names and livery to them. This ended Cat&#x27;s venture into agriculture.

===Financial products and brand licensing===

Caterpillar provides financing and insurance services to customers via Cat Financial and Caterpillar Insurance Services, both of which are subsidiaries of Caterpillar, Inc. Cat Financial provides retail and wholesale financing for Caterpillar products and services, in addition to other equipment provided or facilitated by the company. The company also generates income through the licensing of the Caterpillar and CAT trademarks and logos.

Caterpillar sells the right to manufacture, market, and sell products bearing the Cat trademark to licensees worldwide. Wolverine World Wide is one example, a licensee since 1994 and currently the sole company licensed to produce Cat branded footwear. Other licensees sell items including scale models of Cat products, clothing, hats, luggage, watches, flashlights, shovels, knives, fans, gloves, smartphones, and other consumer products.

==Operations==

===Manufacturing===

Caterpillar products and components are manufactured in 110 facilities worldwide. 51 of the 110 plants are located in the United States and 59 of the 110 plants are located overseas in Australia (until 2015), Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Czech Republic, England, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Poland, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, and Sweden.

Caterpillar&#x27;s historical manufacturing home is in Peoria, Illinois, which also has been the location of Caterpillar&#x27;s world headquarters and core research and development activities. Although Caterpillar has contracted much of its local parts production and warehousing to third parties, Caterpillar still has four major plants in the Peoria area: the Mapleton Foundry, where diesel engine blocks and other large parts are cast; the East Peoria factory, which has assembled Caterpillar tractors for over 70 years; the Mossville engine plant, built after World War II; and the Morton parts facility.

=== Remanufacturing ===
Major facilities in Latin America:
* Mexico: Oradel Industrial Center, Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, México (Since 1988)

===Distribution===

Caterpillar products are distributed to end-users in nearly 200 countries through Caterpillar&#x27;s worldwide network of 220 dealers. Caterpillar&#x27;s dealers are independently owned and operated businesses with exclusive geographical territories. Dealers provide sales, maintenance and repair services, rental equipment, and parts distribution. Finning, a dealer based in Vancouver, Canada, is Caterpillar&#x27;s largest global distributor. Gmmco Ltd is India&#x27;s No. 1 Dealer for Caterpillar Machines. United Tractor &amp; Equipment (Pvt) Limited also known as UTE is the sole authorized dealer of Caterpillar machines and heavy equipment in Sri Lanka.

Most dealers use a management system called DBS for their day-to-day operations.

As of the first quarter of 2006, 66% of Caterpillar&#x27;s sales are made by one of the 63 dealers in the United States, with the remaining 34% sold by one of Caterpillar&#x27;s 157 overseas dealers.

=== Management ===
Caterpillar has a corporate governance structure where the chairman of the board also acts as chief executive officer (CEO). The board of directors is fully independent and is made up of non-employee directors selected from outside the company. Several group presidents report to the CEO, and multiple vice presidents report to each group president.

The board has three committees: audit; compensation and human resources; governance and public policy.

The behavior of all employees is governed by a code of worldwide business conduct, first published in 1974 and last amended in 2005, which sets the corporate standard for honesty and ethical behavior. Management employees are retested on this code annually.

===Current board of directors===
, the board of directors was composed as follows:

* D. James Umpleby III
* Daniel M. Dickinson
* Gerald Johnson
* David W. MacLennan
* Debra L. Reed-Klages
* Susan C. Schwab
* Jim Umpleby—chairman and CEO
* Rayford Wilkins, Jr.
On January 1, 2017, Jim Umpleby succeeded Douglas R. Oberhelman as CEO and Dave Calhoun became non-executive chairman. On December 12, 2018, Umpleby was named chairman of the board as well, reversing Caterpillar&#x27;s previous decision to split the CEO and chairman position.

==Workforce and labor relations==
As of December 31, 2009, Caterpillar employed 93,813 persons of whom 50,562 are located outside the United States. Current employment figures represent a decline of 17,900 employees compared the third quarter of 2008. Due to the restructuring of business operations which began in the 1990s, there are 20,000 fewer union jobs in the Peoria, Illinois area while employment outside the U.S. has increased.

In 2020, it was reported that Caterpillar was planning to cut 700 jobs at its Northern Ireland operations.

===Labor practices===
Caterpillar came close to bankruptcy in the early 1980s, at one point losing almost US$1 million per day due to a sharp downturn in product demand as competition with Japanese rival Komatsu increased. (At the time, Komatsu used the internal slogan &quot;encircle Caterpillar&quot;.) Caterpillar suffered further when the United States declared an embargo against the Soviet Union after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, causing the company to be unable to sell US$400 million worth of pipelaying machinery that had already been built.

Due to the drastic drop in demand, Caterpillar initiated employee layoffs, which led to strikes, primarily by the members of the United Auto Workers, against Caterpillar facilities in Illinois and Pennsylvania. Several news reports at the time indicated that products were piling up so high in facilities that replacement workers could barely make their way to their work stations.

In 1992, the United Auto Workers conducted a five-month strike against Caterpillar. In response, Caterpillar threatened to replace Caterpillar&#x27;s entire unionized work force. Over ten thousand UAW members struck again in 1994–1995 for 17 months, a record at that time. The strike ended with the UAW deciding to return to work without a contract despite record revenues and profits by Caterpillar. In 1994, Caterpillar offered a contract to the UAW members that would have raised the salary of top workers from $35,000 to $39,000 per year. However, the UAW was seeking the same top wage of $40,000 that was paid to workers at John Deere &amp; Company in 1994.

During the strikes, Caterpillar used management employees in an attempt to maintain production. It suspended research and development work, sending thousands of engineers and other non-bargained for employees into their manufacturing and assembly facilities to replace striking or locked out union members.

Rather than continuing to fight the United Auto Workers, Caterpillar chose to make itself less vulnerable to the traditional bargaining tactics of organized labor. One way was by outsourcing much of their parts production and warehouse work to outside firms. In another move, according to UAW officials and industry analysts, Caterpillar began to execute a &quot;southern strategy&quot;. This involved opening new, smaller plants, termed &quot;focus facilities&quot;, in right-to-work states. Caterpillar opened these new facilities in Clayton and Sanford, North Carolina; Fountain Inn, South Carolina; Corinth, Mississippi; Dyersburg, Tennessee; Griffin and LaGrange, Georgia; Seguin, Texas; and North Little Rock, Arkansas.

In 2012, the company locked out workers at a locomotive plant in London, Ontario, Canada and demanded some accept up to a 50% cut in pay, in order to become cost-competitive with comparable Caterpillar manufacturing facilities in the United States. The move created controversy in Canada, with some complaining the plant was acquired under false pretenses. Retail store Mark&#x27;s Work Wearhouse began pulling Caterpillar boots from its shelves as a result.

On May 1, 2012, 780 members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Local Lodge 851 went on strike. An agreement was reached in August, resulting in a 6-year wage freeze. Striking workers expressed anger about the freeze given the company&#x27;s record 2011 profits and CEO Oberhelman&#x27;s 60% salary increase.

==== Coerced labor in Xinjiang ====
In June 2020, it was reported that a Caterpillar clothing wholesaler, Summit Resource International, participates in a Chinese government-run labor transfer scheme that uses forced labor of Uyghurs in internment camps.

==Environmental record==

===Environmental stewardship===

Caterpillar divisions have won Illinois Governor&#x27;s Pollution Prevention Awards every year since 1997. Caterpillar was awarded the 2007 Illinois Governor&#x27;s Pollution Prevention Award for three projects: The Hydraulics and Hydraulic Systems business unit in Joliet implemented a flame sprayed coating for its truck suspension system, replacing a chroming process, reducing hazardous waste by annually, and saving of water. Caterpillar&#x27;s Cast Metals Organization in Mapleton worked with the American Foundry Society to help produce a rule to reduce hazardous waste in scrap metal that meet strict quality requirements, and also allow foundries to continue recycling certain types of scrap and maintain a competitive cost structure. Caterpillar&#x27;s Mossville Engine Center formed a team to look at used oil reuse and recycle processes that forced MEC to send large amounts of used oil off-site for recycling, and developed an updated system for reclaiming it for reuse on-site. The resulting benefits included a usage reduction of about of oil per year.

In 2004 Caterpillar participated in initiatives such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s National Clean Diesel Campaign program, which encourages retrofitting fleets of older buses and trucks with newer diesel engines that meet higher emissions standards.

In 2005, Caterpillar donated $12 million to The Nature Conservancy in a joint effort to protect and preserve river systems in Brazil, U.S.A., and China.

Caterpillar has, for many years, been a member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development based in Geneva, Switzerland and has been listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index each year since 2001.

===Clean Air Act violation===
In July 1999, Caterpillar and five other diesel engine manufacturers signed a consent decree with the Justice Department and the State of California, after governmental investigations revealed violations of the Clean Air Act. The violation involves over a million diesel engines sold with defeat devices, devices that regulated emissions during pre-sale tests, but that could be disabled in favor of better performance during subsequent highway driving. Consequently, these engines &quot;...emit up to triple the permissible level of smog-forming nitrogen oxides (NOx). In 1998 alone, these violating vehicles emitted of additional NOx – an amount equal to the emissions of 65 million cars.&quot; For this reason, Caterpillar was named the &quot;Clean Air Villain of the Month&quot; for August 2000 by the Clean Air Trust. The consent decree provided that $83 million be paid in civil penalties and determined new deadlines for meeting emissions standards. Caterpillar, however, was successful in lobbying for an extension of deadlines they considered too severe. Even so, in October 2002, Caterpillar – the only diesel engine company (of those that signed decrees) to fail to meet the new emissions standards deadline – was forced to pay $128 million in per-engine non-conformance penalties.

===Carbon footprint===
Caterpillar reported Total CO2e emissions (Direct + Indirect) for the twelve months ending 31 December 2020 at 1,521 Kt (-310 /-16.9% y-o-y). Caterpillar plans to reduce emissions 30% by 2030 from a 2018 base year.

==Controversies==
===Tax deferral techniques===
In March 2017, when US federal agents raided Caterpillar&#x27;s headquarters in Peoria Ill., it was already evident that the company engaged in aggressive measures to control tax costs. Since April 2014, the company&#x27;s tax policies have been investigated by a senate subcommittee headed by Senator Carl Levin. Those investigations uncovered significant changes in Caterpillar&#x27;s offshore tax strategy, culminating in the creation of the new Swiss subsidiary Caterpillar SARL (CSARL) in Geneva. In 1999, former Caterpillar executive Daniel Schlicksup accused the company of funneling profits made on replacement parts into Switzerland, even though it had no warehouses or factories there. The Internal Revenue Service found the firm liable for a billion dollars of unpaid taxes for the years 2007 to 2009.

At the same time, the architect of Caterpillar&#x27;s fiscal strategy, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC), came under scrutiny because of PWC&#x27;s conflict of interest in acting as Caterpillar&#x27;s controller as well as being its global tax consultant. The Senate uncovered documents from PWC saying the elaborate move was simply a way to evade American taxes. &quot;We are going to have to do some dancing&quot; one said. Another noted, &quot;What the heck, we will all be retired when this comes up on audit.&quot;

In January 2023, Caterpillar reached a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service and was not ordered to pay any penalties.

===Israel Defense Forces sales===

The sale of Caterpillar bulldozers to the Israeli military, and specifically the IDF Caterpillar D9, for use in the occupied Palestinian territories has long drawn criticism from human rights groups, society groups and responsible investment monitors.

Amnesty International released a report in May 2004 on home demolition in the occupied Palestinian territories that noted the risk of complicity for Caterpillar in human rights violations. The Office of the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights also sent a warning letter to the company the next month about its sales of bulldozers to the Israel Defense Forces and their use to destroy Palestinian farms. Human Rights Watch reported the same year on the systematic use of D9 bulldozers in illegal demolitions throughout the occupied territories and called on Caterpillar to suspend its sales to Israel, citing the company&#x27;s own code of conduct.

The pro-Palestinian group Jewish Voice for Peace and four Roman Catholic orders of nuns planned to introduce a resolution at a Caterpillar shareholder meeting subsequent to the human rights reports asking for an investigation into whether Israel&#x27;s use of the company&#x27;s bulldozer to destroy Palestinian homes conformed with the company&#x27;s code of business conduct. In response, the pro-Israel advocacy group StandWithUs urged its members to buy Caterpillar stock and to write letters of support to the company.

The US investment indexer MSCI removed Caterpillar from three of its indices for socially responsible investments in 2012, citing the Israeli military&#x27;s use of its bulldozers in the Palestinian territories. In 2017, documents emerged that showed Caterpillar had hired private investigators to spy on the family of Rachel Corrie, the American human rights activist who was killed by a D9 bulldozer in Rafah in early 2003. In 2022, Stop the Wall called Caterpillar, alongside Hyundai Heavy Industries, JCB and Volvo Group, complicit in Israel&#x27;s ethnic cleansing of the occupied Palestinian territories through the use of its equipment in the demolition of eight Palestinian villages in Masafer Yatta in the southern West Bank.

=== Trademark claims ===
Caterpillar Inc. has sought the revocations of registered trademarks in the United States incorporating the word &quot;Cat&quot; in markets unrelated to its machinery business, such as &quot;Cat &amp; Cloud&quot; (a cafe in Santa Cruz, California), and Keyboard Cat. The company has faced criticism for this perceived &quot;bullying&quot;, especially in cases where the likelihood of confusion is low.

=== Defective engines ===
In 2014, Caterpillar paid $46M to settle claims that one of its engines caused a fiery explosion on a ship owned by Bender Shipbuilding and Repair Company Inc. In 2016 Caterpillar paid $60M to settle claims that its bus engines were prone to breakdowns and fires.

==Advocacy, philanthropy and awards==
Caterpillar is a member of the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition. A Washington D.C.–based coalition of over 400 major companies and NGOs that advocates for increased funding of American diplomatic and development efforts abroad through the International Affairs Budget. Economic development projects in developing countries (particularly in rural, agricultural regions) serve as new markets for Caterpillar products by improving political and economic stability and raising average incomes.
2011 recipient of the Henry C. Turner Prize for Innovation in Construction Technology from the National Building Museum.

<doc id="668130" wikidata="Q3399572" url="?curid=668130" title="Thermochemical equation">
<text>In thermochemistry, a thermochemical equation is a balanced chemical equation that represents the energy changes from a system to its surroundings. One such equation involves the enthalpy change, which is denoted with formula_1 In variable form, a thermochemical equation would appear similar to the following:
:formula_2
:formula_3

formula_4, formula_5, and formula_6 are the usual agents of a chemical equation with coefficients and formula_7 is a positive or negative numerical value, which generally has units of kJ/mol. Another equation may include the symbol formula_8 to denote energy; formula_8&#x27;s position determines whether the reaction is considered endothermic (energy-absorbing) or exothermic (energy-releasing).

:formula_10

:formula_11

==Understanding aspects of thermochemical equations==

Enthalpy (formula_12) is the transfer of energy in a reaction (for chemical reactions, it is in the form of heat) and formula_1 is the change in enthalpy. formula_1 is a state function, meaning that formula_1 is independent of processes occurring between initial and final states. In other words, it does not matter which steps are taken to get from initial reactants to final products, as formula_1 will always be the same. formula_17, or the change in enthalpy of a reaction, has the same value of formula_1 as in a thermochemical equation; however, formula_17 is measured in units of kJ/mol, meaning that it is the enthalpy change per moles of any particular substance in an equation. Values of formula_1 are determined experimentally under standard conditions of 1 atm and 25 °C (298.15K).

As discussed earlier, formula_1 can have a positive or negative sign. If formula_1 has a positive sign, the system uses heat and is endothermic; if formula_1 is negative, then heat is produced and the system is exothermic.

formula_24

Since enthalpy is a state function, the formula_1 given for a particular reaction is only true for that exact reaction. Physical states of reactants and products matter, as do molar concentrations.

Since formula_1 is dependent on the physical state and molar concentrations in reactions, thermochemical equations must be stoichiometrically correct. If one agent of an equation is changed through multiplication, then all agents must be proportionally changed, including formula_1.

The multiplicative property of thermochemical equations is mainly due to the first law of thermodynamics, which says that energy can neither be created nor destroyed; this concept is commonly known as the conservation of energy. It holds true on a physical or molecular scale.

==Manipulating thermochemical equations==

=== Coefficient multiplication ===
Thermochemical equations can be changed, as mentioned above, by multiplying by any numerical coefficient. All agents must be multiplied, including formula_1. Using the thermochemical equation of variables as above, one gets the following example.

:formula_29
:formula_3

One must assume that formula_4 needs to be multiplied by two in order for the thermochemical equation to be used. All the agents in the reaction must then be multiplied by the same coefficient, like so:

:formula_32

:formula_33

This is again considered to be logical when the first law of thermodynamics is considered. Twice as much product is produced, so twice as much heat is removed or given off. The division of coefficients functions in the same way.

=== Hess&#x27;s law: Addition of thermochemical equations ===
Hess&#x27;s law states that the sum of the energy changes of all thermochemical equations included in an overall reaction is equal to the overall energy change. Since formula_1 is a state function and is not dependent on how reactants become products as a result, steps (in the form of several thermochemical equations) can be used to find the formula_1 of the overall reaction. For instance:

&lt;chem block&gt;Reaction\ 1: \quad C_{graphite}(s)\ + O2 (g) \to CO2 (g)&lt;/chem&gt;

This reaction is the result of two steps (a reaction sequence):

&lt;chem block&gt;C_{graphite} (s) \ + \frac{1}{2}O2 (g) \to CO(g)&lt;/chem&gt;

formula_36

&lt;chem block&gt;CO(g)\ + \frac{1}{2}O2(g) \to CO2 (g)&lt;/chem&gt;

formula_37

Adding these two reactions together results in Reaction 1, which allows formula_1 to be found, so whether or not agents in the reaction sequence are equal to each other is verified. The reaction sequences are then added together. In the following example, &lt;chem&gt;CO&lt;/chem&gt; is not in Reaction 1 and equals another reaction.

&lt;chem block&gt;C_{graphite} (s) \ + \frac{1}{2} O2 (g) \ + \frac{1}{2} O2 (g) \to CO2(g)&lt;/chem&gt;

and

&lt;chem block&gt;C_{graphite} (s) \ + O2 (g) \to CO2(g), \ Reaction \ 1&lt;/chem&gt;

To solve for formula_1, the formula_1s of the two equations in the reaction sequence are added together:

formula_41

Another example involving thermochemical equations is that when methane gas is combusted, heat is released, making the reaction exothermic. In the process, 890.4 kJ of heat is released per mole of reactants, so the heat is written as a product of the reaction. 

=== Other notes ===
*If reactions have to be reversed for their products to be equal, the sign of formula_1 must also be reversed.
*If an agent has to be multiplied for it to equal another agent, all other agents and formula_1 must also be multiplied by its coefficient.
*Generally, formula_1 values given in tables are under 1 atm and 25 °C (298.15 K), otherwise known as Standard Lab Conditions.

==Locations of values of ΔH==
Values of formula_1 have been experimentally determined and are available in table form. Most general chemistry textbooks have appendixes including common formula_1 values. There are several online tables available. A software offered with Active Thermochemical Tables (ATcT) provides more information online.

<text>In 2004, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched Operation Rainbow in Cloud () in the southern Gaza Strip on 12–24 May 2004, involving an invasion and siege of Rafah. The operation was started after the deaths of eleven Israeli soldiers in two Palestinian attacks, in which M113 armored vehicles were attacked.

Human Rights Watch reported 59 Palestinians killed during 12–24 May, including 11 under age eighteen and 18 armed men. The IDF razed some 300 homes to expand the buffer zone along the Egypt–Gaza border, expanding it far inside the Gaza Strip. Also, a zoo and at least 700 dunams (70 ha) of agricultural land were destroyed.

Israel&#x27;s declared aims of &quot;Operation Rainbow&quot; were finding and destroying smuggling tunnels, targeting terrorists, and securing the Philadelphi Route by expanding the buffer zone.

==Background==
In response to a repeated shelling of Israeli communities with Qassam rockets and mortar shells from Gaza, the IDF operated mainly in Rafah – to search and destroy smuggling tunnels used by militants to obtain weapons, ammunition, fugitives, cigarettes, car parts, electrical goods, foreign currency, gold, drugs, and cloth from Egypt. The IDF launched a series of armored raids on the Gaza Strip (mainly Rafah and refugee camps around Gaza). On 22 March 2004, an Israeli helicopter gunship killed Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and on 17 April, Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi was killed by IDF helicopter gunship strike.

=== Buffer zone ===
Since 2001, the IDF has routinely demolished Palestinian houses in Rafah, to create a buffer zone. Persons entering or approaching the buffer zone, including humanitarian workers, foreign dignitaries and UN observers came under fire. Until 2000, the IDF used a 20–40 meter wide buffer zone along the Gaza/Egypt border with a 2.5 to 3 meters high concrete wall topped with barbed wire. In 2002, the IDF destroyed hundreds of houses in Rafah, needed for expansion of the buffer zone and the building of an eight meter high and 1.6 kilometers long metal wall along the border. The wall also extends two meters underground. The wall is built some eighty to ninety meters from the border, which doubled the width of the patrol corridor. After the metal wall was completed in early 2003, the demolitions continued and were even increased dramatically. According to Human Rights Watch, the wall was built far inside the demolished area to create a new starting point for justifying further demolitions. Between 1 April 2003 and 30 April 2004, 487 more houses were demolished in Rafah.

In May 2004, the Israeli government approved a plan to further expand the buffer zone. The Israeli military recommended demolishing all homes within three hundred meters of its positions, or about four hundred meters from the border.

Human rights group PCHR recorded 290 destroyed houses in Rafah in May 2004. According to UNWRA, the total number of house buildings destroyed by the IDF in May 2004 was some 298. 131 homes were destroyed between 1 and 10 May, already before the Government&#x27;s decision; some 100 houses between 14 and 16 May (Human Rights Watch mentions several rows of houses on 12 May and quotes 88 to 116 between 14 and 16 May).

According to HRW, the IDF&#x27;s justifications for the destruction were doubtful and rather consistent with the goal of having a wide and empty border area to facilitate long-term control over the Gaza Strip.

== Aims of the operation ==

Initially, the operation just started as a response on the death of five soldiers in the Philadelphi corridor on 12 May 2004; on 13 May, the Israeli government reportedly approved a plan to widen the Philadelphi Route by destroying &quot;dozens or perhaps hundreds&quot; of homes.

On 17 May, the IDF launched &quot;Operation Rainbow&quot; with the objectives: finding and destroying smuggling tunnels, targeting &quot;terrorists&quot;, and securing the Philadelphi Route. On 18 May, rumours were spread about arms shipments in the Sinai from Iran, waiting to be smuggled through the tunnels into Gaza. Israeli media mentioned anti-aircraft missiles and long-range rockets waiting to get in, possibly via tunnels underneath the Suez canal. Justice Minister Yosef Lapid said on 20 May that the Rafah operation was necessary to protect Israeli civilian airliners from anti-aircraft missiles that smugglers were attempting to bring into Rafah. No captures of such weapons are known, and a high-ranking Egyptian official interviewed by Human Rights Watch denied the existence of the shipment.

Many saw the assault on Rafah as excessive, and mainly motivated by an IDF desire to appear strong in the event of disengagement.

==The operation==
=== Preceding military actions ===
On May 11 and May 12, two M-113 armoured personnel carriers, one of Givati&#x27;s Dolev combat engineering company and of the Combat Engineering Corps &quot;Tunnels&#x27; Team&quot;, were destroyed by Palestinian militants. The two separate attacks, in Gaza City&#x27;s Zeitoun neighbourhood and the Philadelphi Route near Rafah and the Egyptian border, claimed the lives of 11 IDF soldiers. Soon, Israeli troops entered the buffer zone to recover body parts of the dead soldiers. In the evening, the IDF attacked Rafah with tanks and helicopter gunships, firing shells and missiles as residents fled. Several rows of houses were demolished.
On 14 May, a large IDF force entered the &quot;Brazil block&quot; of Rafah and in a heavy fighting, as reported by UNWRA, 12 Palestinians were killed and 52 injured. Israeli forces began demolishing houses in the Qishta neighborhood. and destroyed scores of houses. Around midnight the same day, the Israeli High Court of Justice issued an interim order temporarily barring the IDF from demolishing homes in the refugee camp, if the action was not part of &quot;a regular military operation&quot;. Nevertheless, the IDF continued the destruction of homes until 15 May 5:00 am because of &quot;immediate military necessity, a risk to soldiers, or a hindrance to a military operation&quot;, raising the number of destroyed houses to just over 100, according to Mezan, even to circa 120.

On 16 May, the High Court ruled that the IDF may destroy homes according to their needs; the IDF had pledged that it would refrain from unnecessarily demolishing houses. The ruling caused panic among the residents and hundreds of Palestinians fled from their homes. Israeli helicopters fired missiles on the office of the weekly newspaper &quot;al-Resala&quot; in Gaza City, destroying its offices. The next day, Israel started &quot;Operation Rainbow&quot;.

===Operation Rainbow===
In the morning of 17 May 2004, the Israel army launched &quot;Operation Rainbow&quot;. At 1 pm, the IDF closed the only road between Rafah and Khan Yunis and initiated a total siege. Armoured vehicles, main battle tanks and armoured bulldozers entered Rafah from the east through the Sofa Crossing, effectively cutting off Rafah from the rest of the Gaza Strip.

The next day before dawn, the army surrounded Tel al-Sultan. Armoured vehicles, tanks and bulldozers supported by helicopter gunships entered the Tel al-Sultan quarter of Rafah simultaneously from several directions; the troops established a cordon around the area and separated the area from the rest of Rafah. A number of armoured vehicles entered through UNRWA schools in the southeastern part, causing extensive damage to the school grounds. Ambulances were prevented from evacuating the casualties out of fear that they would be hijacked by terrorists. Palestinians were prevented from accessing UNRWA&#x27;s health clinic in the area. An ambulance was fired at. When a convoy of four ambulances accompanied by a Reuters vehicle were sent, they were also fired at. When they arrived at the victim, Israeli soldiers continued to fire. Israeli IDF Caterpillar D9 armoured bulldozers erected sand-barriers around Rafah to isolate it. Later, the D9s entered into the Rafah in order to open routes and demolish houses, allegedly used by militants. Extensive damage was caused to roads, water and sewage pipes and agricultural areas with greenhouses.

Under pressure of sharp international criticism, the Israel government declared on 18 May that the plan to widen a buffer zone along the Egyptian border was cancelled, while the same day, the army massively invaded Rafah and continued its large-scale destruction. The next day, the United Nations Security Council adopted &quot;Resolution 1544&quot;, condemning the killing of Palestinian civilians and the demolition of homes.

On 19 May, the IDF ordered all males in Tel al-Sultan aged 16 years and above to gather at an UNRWA school and carried out house-to-house searches. An IDF tank fired four tank shells and a helicopter fired a missile on a group of demonstrating residents in Tel al-Sultan, killing 9 Palestinians and injuring 40–50 others. The IDF asserted there were gunmen in the crowd, although it did not claim to have come under fire. The IDF claimed that the shelling was intended as a warning to deter protesters and was not meant to cause casualties. IDF snipers used abandoned houses as firing positions. Many houses were damaged or destroyed. Israeli snipers shot at suspected militants who claimed they were civilians looking for water. The gunfire claimed the life of a Palestinian teen.

On 20 May the IDF entered the &quot;Brazil&quot;, &quot;As-Salam&quot; and &quot;Junena&quot; areas of eastern Rafah and sealed off the areas. In some cases, water and electricity were cut off during the operation. Tens of homes were demolished in Brazil and As Salam without warning. Some Palestinians claimed that the IDF commenced the demolitions when they were still in their homes.

A testimony describes attacks on an ambulance: When the ambulance arrived at al-Brazil to pick up a woman and her three wounded children, Israeli tanks fired. With bulldozers and tanks, the ambulance was surrounded. A bulldozer started to place sand barriers in front of the ambulance, while another bulldozer was demolishing houses and putting the ruins behind the ambulance to lock it in. When the medical workers tried to leave the car, Israeli tanks fired. After 3 hours, the army started to remove the barriers and the ambulance returned, without the wounded civilians.

On 21 May, the Rafah zoo adjacent to the &quot;Brazil&quot; section of the Rafah refugee camp was destroyed during the operation. Some 60 homes were demolished and 35 others partially destroyed. also greenhouses and equipment were destroyed. The IDF withdrew their main forces from the center of Tel al-Sultan and the curfew was lifted.

On 22 and 23 May, a new incursion into the Brazil district took place. The IDF ordered all males in Abu Halaweh aged 16 years and above to gather and carried out house-to-house searches and demolitions. The IDF deliberately demolished two houses with the family who refused to leave inside. A soldier entered a house with a Palestinian as human shield. In Tel al-Sultan, the IDF destroyed with bulldozers and tanks two large agricultural areas full of greenhouses.

During the early hours of 24 May, Israeli forces withdrew completely from Tel al-Sultan, but remained present in the Brazil area until the end of the month. About 40 homes were destroyed from early in the morning until 6 pm.

On 1 June the operation officially ended. Surprisingly, the IDF choose to invade areas where armed resistance was limited, apparently to minimize confrontation with armed groups.

== Destruction of the Rafah zoo ==

On 21 May the Israeli army completely destroyed the Rafah zoo, nearly 800 meters from the Egypt–Gaza border.

The IDF said they had destroyed the zoo while en route to another objective and because an alternate route had been booby-trapped. According to Human Rights Watch, the deliberate and time-consuming nature of the destruction, the seizure of the four-story Juma’ house, and the stationing of several tanks there for over a day means that it was not an action en route, but rather part of enforcing a cordon. &quot;The Guardian&quot; alleged that the IDF evolved the explanation of its actions. Mohammed Juma also accused Israeli soldiers of stealing valuable African parrots.

== Accusations of human rights violations ==

Al Mezan reported grave human rights violations. Many Palestinian civilians were killed. Many homes were destroyed or damaged. Medical services were obstructed, ambulances attacked, dead bodies could not be collected. Humanitarian assistance was denied. Large-scale wilful destruction of properties was reported; properties were stolen, soldiers urinated on mattresses and furniture. Civilians were systematically used as human shields. According to Al Mezan, the use as human shield was common use in such Israeli operations.

==Results==

=== Casualties ===
From 12 to 15 May the IDF reportedly killed nine Palestinian civilians and six fighters. Eleven IDF soldiers died on 12–13 May, later during the military operation two Israeli soldiers were killed and two more wounded. 
Al Mezan reported 15 killed Palestinians, all from missile attacks on 14 and 15 May, and at least 44 Palestinians during &quot;Operation Rainbow&quot;, making a total of at least 59.

The IDF reportedly killed 32 Palestinian civilians, of whom 10 under age eighteen, as well as 12 armed fighters.
Based on a variety of reports, accounts and statements, Human Rights Watch reported 59 Palestinians killed during 12–24 May, including 11 under age eighteen and 18 armed men.

According to the IDF, 41 militants and 12 civilians were killed during the operation, where some of the civilians were killed by Palestinian fire. During the operation, from 18 May to 25 May, no Israeli soldier was killed.

=== Damage ===
Pictures from Rafah showed a devastated city. Due to the use of armored bulldozers and tanks, extensive damage was caused to schools, roads, water and sewage pipes and agricultural areas with greenhouses, resulting in floods and risk of disease. At least 700 dunams (70 ha) of agricultural land were destroyed.

As of 23 May 2004 one smuggling tunnel had been found, which according to the Israeli army was 25 feet deep and contained explosives.

According to UN relief agency UNRWA, the IDF destroyed 45 buildings during the operation and 155 buildings in Rafah over the past month. Human rights groups estimated that the army had demolished some 170–180 buildings in Rafah, including some 300 homes. About 2,000 people became homeless in Operation Rainbow. According to Human Rights Watch, during 12–24 May, 254 houses were destroyed, leaving nearly 3,800 people homeless, and 44 another houses in the Rafah area during the same month in other operations.

==Aftermath==

On 29 June 2004, Israel started an invasion of Beit Hanoun. On 29 September, after a Qassam rocket hit the Israeli town of Sderot and killed two Israeli children, the IDF launched an invasion of the north of the Gaza Strip. The operation&#x27;s stated aim was to remove the threat of Qassam rockets from Sderot. The operation ended on 16 October, leaving widespread destruction and some 130 Palestinians dead.

<doc id="668147" wikidata="Q1602782" url="?curid=668147" title="Hellenization">
<text>Hellenization is the adoption of Greek culture, religion, language, and identity by non-Greeks. In the ancient period, colonisation often led to the Hellenisation of indigenous peoples; in the Hellenistic period, many of the territories which were conquered by Alexander the Great were Hellenized.

== Etymology ==
The first known use of a verb that means &quot;to Hellenize&quot; was in Greek (ἑλληνίζειν) and by Thucydides (5th century BC), who wrote that the Amphilochian Argives were Hellenised as to their language by the Ambraciots, which shows that the word perhaps already referred to more than language. The similar word Hellenism, which is often used as a synonym, is used in 2 Maccabees (c. 124 BC) and the Book of Acts (c. AD 80–90) to refer to clearly much more than language, though it is disputed what that may have entailed.

== Background ==
=== Historical ===

By the 4th century BC, the process of Hellenization had started in southwestern Anatolia&#x27;s Lycia, Caria and Pisidia regions. (1st century fortifications at Pelum in Galatia, on Baş Dağ in Lycaonia and at Isaura are the only known Hellenistic-style structures in central and eastern Anatolia).

When it was advantageous to do so, places like Side and Aspendos invented Greek-themed origin myths; an inscription published in SEG shows that in the 4th century BC Aspendos claimed ties to Argos, similar to Nikokreon of Cyprus who also claimed Argive lineage. (Argos was home to the Kings of Macedon.) Like the Argeads, the Antigonids claimed descent from Heracles, the Seleucids from Apollo, and the Ptolemies from Dionysus.

The Seuthopolis inscription was very influential in the modern study of Thrace. The inscription mentions Dionysus, Apollo and some Samothracian gods. Scholars have interpreted the inscription as evidence of Hellenisation in inland Thrace during the early Hellenistic, but this has been challenged by recent scholarship.

However, Hellenization had its limitations. For example, areas of southern Syria that were affected by Greek culture mostly entailed Seleucid urban centres, where Greek was commonly spoken. The countryside, on the other hand, was largely unaffected, with most of its inhabitants speaking Syriac and clinging to their native traditions.

By itself, archaeological evidence only gives researchers an incomplete picture of Hellenization; it is often not possible to state with certainty whether particular archaeological findings belonged to Greeks, Hellenized indigenous peoples, indigenous people who simply owned Greek-style objects or some combination of these groups. Thus, literary sources are also used to help researchers interpret archaeological findings.

=== Modern ===
== Regions ==
=== Anatolia ===
The first properly Greek settlements in Anatolia originated shortly after the end of the Bronze age, around the 11th century BCE. Mycenaean settlements at Halicarnassus, Miletus, and Colophon existed before this, but Mycenaean colonization in the region was sporadic at best and not on the same scale as the later Greek colonization of Anatolia. These initial posts in the 2nd millennium BCE, however, were less colonies in the traditional sense and more akin to the factories of the Age of Discovery; that is, that they were trading posts initially established to conduct trade with Anatolian locals. By the beginning of the Archaic period, settlement of Anatolia had begun to grow at a quick rate, and proper colonies in the traditional sense were established in the form of predominantly Greek city-states (, ). Extensive trade between mainland Greece and the Hellenistic portions of Anatolia was underway by the 8th to 7th centuries BCE, with fish, grain, timber, metal, and often slaves being exported from the land. It is believed that this kind of contact with the spread of Hellenistic culture, religion, and ideas in Anatolia was a peaceful process.

Worship of the Greek pantheon of gods was practiced in Lydia. Lydian king Croesus often invited the wisest Greek philosophers, orators and statesmen to attend his court. Croesus himself often consulted the famous oracle at Delphi-bestowing many gifts and offerings to this and other religious sites for example. He provided patronage for the reconstruction of the Temple of Artemis, to which he offered a large number of marble columns as dedication to the goddess.

It was in the towns that Hellenisation made its greatest progress, with the process often being synonymous with urbanisation. Hellenisation reached Pisidia and Lycia sometime in the 4th century BC, but the interior remained largely unaffected for several more centuries until it came under Roman rule in the 1st century BC. Ionian, Aeolian and Doric settlers along Anatolia&#x27;s Western coast seemed to have remained culturally Greek and some of their city-states date back to the Archaic Period. On the other hand, Greeks who settled in the southwestern region of Pisidia and Pamphylia seem to have been assimilated by the local culture.

=== Crimea ===

Panticapaeum (modern day Kerch) was one of the early Greek colonies in Crimea. It was founded by Miletus around 600 BC on a site with good terrain for a defensive acropolis. By the time the Cimmerian colonies had organised into the Bosporan Kingdom much of the local native population had been Hellenized. Most scholars date the establishment of the kingdom to 480 BC, when the Archaeanactid dynasty assumed control of Panticapaeum, but classical archaeologist Gocha R. Tsetskhladze has dated the kingdom&#x27;s founding to 436 BC, when the Spartocid dynasty replaced the ruling Archaeanactids.

=== Judea ===

The Hellenistic Seleucid and Ptolemaic kingdoms that formed after Alexander&#x27;s death were particularly relevant to the history of Judaism. Located between the two kingdoms, Judea experienced long periods of warfare and instability. Judea fell under Seleucid control in 198 BC. By the time Antiochus IV Epiphanes became king of Judea in 175 BC, Jerusalem was already somewhat Hellenized. In 170 BC, both claimants to the High Priesthood, Jason and Menelaus, bore Greek names. Jason had established institutions of Greek education and in later years Jewish culture started to be suppressed including forbidding circumcision and observance of the Sabbath.

Hellenization of members of the Jewish elite included names and clothes, but other customs were adapted by the rabbis, and elements that violated the halakha and midrash were prohibited. One example is the elimination of some aspects of Hellenistic banquets, such as the practice of offering libations to the gods, while incorporating certain elements that gave the meals a more Jewish character. Discussion of Scripture, the singing of sacred songs and attendance of students of the Torah were encouraged. One detailed account of Jewish-style Hellenistic banquets comes from Ben Sira. There is literary evidence from Philo about the extravagance of Alexandrian Jewish banquets, and &quot;The Letter of Aristeas&quot; discusses Jews dining with non-Jews as an opportunity to share Jewish wisdom.

=== Parthia ===

=== Pisidia and Pamphylia ===
Pamphylia is a plain located between the highlands of Lycia and Cilicia. The exact date of Greek settlement in the region is not known; one possible theory is that settlers arrived in the region as part of Bronze Age maritime trade between the Aegean, Levant and Cyprus, while another attributes it to population movements during the instability of the Bronze Age Collapse. The Greek dialect established in Pamphylia by the Classical period was related to Arcado-Cypriot.

Mopsus is a legendary founder of several coastal cities in southwestern Anatolia, including Aspendos, Phaselis, Perge and Sillyon. A bilingual Phoenician and neo-Hittite Luwian inscription found at Karatepe, dated to 800 BC, says that the ruling dynasty there traced their origins to Mopsus. Mopsus, whose name is also attested to in Hittite documents, may originally have been an Anatolian figure that became part of the cultural traditions of Pamphylia&#x27;s early Greek settlers. Attested to in Linear B texts, he is given a Greek genealogy as a descendant of Manto and Apollo.

For centuries the indigenous population exerted considerable influence on Greek settlers, but after the 4th century BC this population quickly started to become Hellenised. Little is known about Pisidia prior to the 3rd century BC, but there is quite a bit of archeological evidence that dates to the Hellenistic period. Literary evidence, however, including inscriptions and coins are limited. During the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, native regional tongues were abandoned in favour of koine Greek and settlements began to take on characteristics of Greek &quot;polis&quot;.

The Iron Age Panemoteichos I may be an early precursor to later regional Hellenistic settlements including Selge, Termessos and Sagalassos (believed to be the three most prominent cities of Hellenistic Pisidia). The site is evidence of &quot;urban organisation&quot; that predates the Greek &quot;polis&quot; by 500 years. Based on Panemoteichos I and other Iron Age sites, including the Phrygian Midas şehri and the Cappadocian fortification of Kerkenes, experts believe that &quot;behind the Greek influence that shaped the Hellenistic Pisidian communities there lay a tangible and important Anatolian tradition.&quot;

According to the writings of Arrian the population of Side, who traced their origins to Aeolian Cyme, had forgotten the Greek language by the time Alexander arrived at the city in 334 BC. There are coins and stone inscriptions that attest to a unique script from the region but the language has only been partially deciphered.

=== Phrygia ===
The latest dateable coins found at the Phrygian capital of Gordion are from the 2nd century BC. Finds from the abandoned Hellenistic era settlement include imported and locally produced imitation Greek-style terracotta figurines and ceramics. Inscriptions show that some of the inhabitants had Greek names, while others had Anatolian or possibly Celtic names.
Many Phrygian cult objects were Hellenised during the Hellenistic period, but worship of traditional deities like the Phrygian mother goddess persisted. Greek cults attested to include Hermes, Kybele, the Muses and Tyche.

=== Syria ===
Greek art and culture reached Phoenicia by way of commerce before any Greek cities were founded in Syria, but the Hellenisation of Syrians was not widespread until it became a Roman province. Under Roman rule in the 1st century BC, there is evidence of Hellenistic style funerary architecture, decorative elements, mythological references, and inscriptions. However, there is a lack of evidence from Hellenistic Syria; concerning this, most scholars view it as the case that the &quot;absence of evidence is not evidence of absence&quot;.

=== Bactria ===
The Bactrians, an Iranian ethnic group who lived in Bactria (northern Afghanistan), were Hellenised during the reign of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and soon after various tribes in northwestern regions of the Indian subcontinent underwent Hellenisation during the reign of the Indo-Greek Kingdom.

== Early Christianity ==
The periodisation of the Hellenistic Age, between the conquests of Alexander the Great up to Octavian″s victory at the Battle of Actium, has been attributed to the 19th-century historian J. G. Droysen. According to this model the spread of Greek culture during this period made the rise of Christianity possible. Later, in the 20th century, scholars questioned this 19th-century paradigm for failing to account for the contributions of Semitic-speaking and other Near Eastern cultures.

The twentieth century witnessed a lively debate over the extent of Hellenisation in the Levant, particularly among the ancient Jews, which has continued until today. Interpretations on the rise of Early Christianity, which was applied most famously by Rudolf Bultmann, used to see Judaism as largely unaffected by Hellenism, and the Judaism of the diaspora was thought to have succumbed thoroughly to its influences. Bultmann thus argued that Christianity arose almost completely within those Hellenistic confines and should be read against that background, as opposed to a more traditional Jewish background. With the publication of Martin Hengel&#x27;s two-volume study &quot;Hellenism and Judaism&quot; (1974, German original 1972) and subsequent studies &quot;Jews, Greeks and Barbarians: Aspects of the Hellenisation of Judaism in the pre-Christian Period&quot; (1980, German original 1976) and &quot;The &#x27;Hellenisation&#x27; of Judaea in the First Century after Christ&quot; (1989, German original 1989), the tide began to turn decisively. Hengel argued that virtually all of Judaism was highly Hellenised well before the beginning of the Christian era, and even the Greek language was well known throughout the cities and even the smaller towns of Jewish Palestine. Scholars have continued to nuance Hengel&#x27;s views, but almost all believe that strong Hellenistic influences were throughout the Levant, even among the conservative Jewish communities, which were the most nationalistic.

In his introduction to the 1964 book &quot;Meditations&quot;, Anglican priest Maxwell Staniforth discussed the profound influence of Stoic philosophy on Christianity:

Again in the doctrine of the Trinity, the ecclesiastical conception of Father, Word, and Spirit finds its germ in the different Stoic names of the Divine Unity. Thus Seneca, writing of the supreme Power which shapes the universe, states, &#x27;This Power we sometimes call the All-ruling God, sometimes the incorporeal Wisdom, sometimes the holy Spirit, sometimes Destiny.&#x27; The Church had only to reject the last of these terms to arrive at its own acceptable definition of the Divine Nature; while the further assertion &#x27;these three are One&#x27;, which the modern mind finds paradoxical, was no more than commonplace to those familiar with Stoic notions.

==Eastern Roman Empire==

The Greek East was one of the two main cultural areas of the Roman Empire and began to be ruled by an autonomous imperial court in AD 286 under Diocletian. However, Rome remained the nominal capital of both parts of the empire, and Latin was the state language. When the Western Empire fell and the Roman Senate sent the regalia of the Western Emperor to the Eastern Emperor Zeno in AD 476, Constantinople (Byzantium in Ancient Greek) was recognised as the seat of the sole Emperor. A process of political Hellenisation began and led, among other reforms, to the declaration of Greek as the official language.

== Modern times ==

In 1909, a commission appointed by the Greek government reported that a third of the villages of Greece should have their names changed, often because of their non-Greek origin. In other instances, names were changed from a contemporary name of Greek origin to the ancient Greek name. Some village names were formed from a Greek root word with a foreign suffix or vice versa. Most of the name changes took place in areas populated by ethnic Greeks in which a stratum of foreign or divergent toponyms had accumulated over the centuries. However, in some parts of northern Greece, the population was not Greek-speaking, and many of the former toponyms had reflected the diverse ethnic and linguistic origins of their inhabitants.

The process of the change of toponyms in modern Greece has been described as a process of Hellenisation. A modern use is in connection with policies pursuing &quot;cultural harmonization and education of the linguistic minorities resident within the modern Greek state&quot; - the Hellenisation of minority groups in modern Greece. The term &quot;Hellenisation&quot; (or Hellenization) is also used in the context of Greek opposition to the use of the Slavic dialects of Greece.

In 1870, the Greek government abolished all Italian schools in the Ionian islands, which had been annexed to Greece six years earlier. That led to the diminution of the community of Corfiot Italians, which had lived in Corfu since the Middle Ages; by the 1940s, there were only 400 Corfiot Italians left.

=== Arvanites ===
Arvanites are descendants of Albanian settlers who came to the present southern Greece in the late 13th and early 14th century. With participation in the Greek War of Independence and the Greek Civil War, this has led to increasing assimilation amongst the Arvanites. The common Orthodox Christian faith they shared with the rest of the local population was one of the main reasons that led to their assimilation. Other reasons for assimilation are large-scale internal migration to the cities and subsequent intermingling of the population. Although sociological studies of Arvanite communities still used to note an identifiable sense of a special &quot;ethnic&quot; identity among Arvanites, the authors did not identify or never identified a sense of &#x27;belonging to Albania or to the Albanian nation&#x27;. Many Arvanites find the designation &quot;Albanians&quot; offensive as they identify nationally and ethnically as Greeks and not Albanians. Because of this, relations between Arvanites and other Albanian-speaking populations have diverged over time. During the onset of the Greek war of Independence, Arvanites fought alongside Greek revolutionaries against Muslim Albanians. For example, Arvanites participated in the 1821 Tripolitsa Massacre of Muslim Albanians, while some Muslim Albanian speakers in the region of Bardounia remained after the war, converting to Orthodoxy. In recent times, Arvanites have expressed mixed opinions towards recent Albanian settlers within Greece. Other Arvanites during the late 1980s and early 1990s expressed solidarity with Albanian immigrants, due to linguistic similarities and being politically leftist. Relations too between Arvanites and other Orthodox Albanian-speaking communities such as those of Greek Epirus are mixed, as they are distrusted regarding religious matters due to a past Albanian Muslim population living amongst them.

There are no monolingual Arvanitika-speakers, as all are today bilingual in Greek. However, while Arvanites are bilingual in Greek and Arvanitika, Arvanitika is considered an endangered language as it is in a state of attrition due to the large-scale language shift towards Greek among the descendants of Arvanitika-speakers in recent decades, becoming monolingual Greek speakers in the end, and since Arvanitika is almost exclusively a spoken language, Arvanites also no longer have practical affiliation with the Standard Albanian language used in Albania, as they do not use this form in writing or in media.

<text>WFMU (91.1 MHz) is a non-commercial, listener-supported, independent community radio station licensed to East Orange, New Jersey, with studios in Jersey City. It is owned by Auricle Communications, broadcasting a free-form radio format. The station holds periodic on-air fundraisers and seeks donation on its website.

WFMU is a Class A station. It has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 1,250 watts. The station&#x27;s transmitter is on Prospect Avenue and Mount Pleasant Avenue in West Orange. Programming is also heard on 10-watt FM translator W220EJ at 91.9 FM in Weehawken. The lower Catskills, parts of Northern New Jersey and Eastern Pennsylvania can receive sister station WMFU&#x27;s simulcast on 90.1 MHz, licensed to Mount Hope, New York, with its transmitter in Otisville. That station also has a 10-watt translator at 91.9 MHz in New City, New York, serving Rockland County.

==Philosophy and awards==
WFMU does not belong to any public broadcasting network. Most programming is done in-house by volunteer DJs. Its website says that &quot;experimentation, spontaneity and humor are among the station&#x27;s most frequently noted distinguishing traits.&quot;

&quot;WFMU is a place where the Singing Dogs are just as important as Elvis; a place where you will, in fact, hear Elvis, but in close proximity to ritual disinterment music from Sumatra, the soundtrack from &quot;Mothra&quot;, a theremin band called Lothar and the Hand People, and the intergalactic jazz improvisations of Sun Ra&#x27;s Arkestra,&quot; wrote Jaime Wolf in a 1999 &quot;New York Times&quot; station profile.

WFMU was named &quot;Best Radio Station in the Country&quot; by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine for four consecutive years: 1991 to 1994. And has also been dubbed the best radio station in either NYC or the US by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, &quot;New York Press&quot;, and &quot;CMJ&quot;, among others. The station also won three awards (&quot;Best Specialty Programming&quot;, &quot;Most Eclectic Programming&quot;, and &quot;Music Director Most Likely to Never Sell Out&quot;) at the 2006 CMJ College Radio Awards.

==History==
===Upsala College===
WFMU signed on the air in April 1958. WFMU was owned by Upsala College in East Orange, New Jersey, a small, independent college in the suburbs of New York City. Initially it was a student-staffed and faculty-administered college radio operation. But as time went on, the station only had a loose association with the college. By the 1980s most of the station&#x27;s staff were not students and the station&#x27;s management, though hired by the college, had little involvement with the academic community.

In December 1983, Ken Freedman joined WFMU as a DJ and succeeded Bruce Longstreet as general manager in August 1985.

In 1989, WFMU successfully fended off a challenge to the station&#x27;s license from four rival broadcasters, who claimed that WFMU was broadcasting above its legal power limit.

A 1990 telephone performance on WFMU by Daniel Johnston was the primary inspiration for filmmaker Jeff Feuerzeig to create the documentary film, &quot;The Devil and Daniel Johnston&quot;.

In late 1991, Jeff Buckley made his radio debut on WFMU and returned numerous times before signing with Columbia Records.

===Auricle Communications===
In 1992, the non-profit organization Auricle Communications was founded. Auricle purchased WFMU&#x27;s license from Upsala College in 1994, one year prior to the college&#x27;s bankruptcy in 1995.

In 1993, the station launched its website, and in 1997 it began streaming its broadcasts full-time.

In August 1998, listener donations funded a new studio and office in Jersey City.

In May 2001, WFMU received worldwide attention when both national and international media outlets covered DJ Glen Jones&#x27;s successful attempt to break the Guinness World Record for longest consecutive radio broadcast. Jones stayed on the air a full 100 hours and 42 seconds.

In 2005, WFMU expanded its online broadcasting efforts by offering 15 hours a week of Internet-only live programming, as well as an independent 24-hour-a-day webcast of Nachum Segal&#x27;s &quot;Jewish Moments in the Morning&quot; program.

===Streaming===
In January 2006, WFMU announced the availability of the station&#x27;s live stream and archives to mobile devices running the operating systems Windows Mobile (Pocket PC) and Palm OS.

In November 2007, WFMU became the first radio station in the world to offer live streaming to the Apple iPhone.

From 2014 to 2015, a documentary on WFMU, &quot;Sex and Broadcasting: A Film About WFMU&quot;, screened at American film festivals and independent cinemas nationwide.

===Monty Hall===
In 2014, WFMU acquired the building at 43 Montgomery Street, that has housed their studios and offices since 1998. That same year the station built out and opened a performing arts venue called Monty Hall.

<text>The Bass River is a tributary of the Mullica River in southeastern New Jersey in the United States.

The river is located primarily in Bass River, New Jersey, which was named for the river, which was in turn named for Jeremiah Basse, who served as governor of both West Jersey and East Jersey.

It rises in the Pinelands of southeastern Burlington County and flows generally south, through Bass River State Forest, and joins the Mullica from the north approximately upstream from its mouth on Great Bay. The lower of the river forms an arm of the estuary of the Mullica. The river is part of the watershed of the Mullica that drains an extensive unspoiled wetlands region of New Jersey. The majority of the land within the drainage basin is forested, and under state protection. Near the mouth and lower parts of the river, there is tidal influence.

He was governor of the northern state of Coahuila during the presidency of Porfirio Díaz. Garza Galán, native of Múzquiz, wanted to be again governor in 1893, but there were protests. Eventually, Porfirio Díaz asked Garza Galán to withdraw his candidacy.

=== Politician ===
Porfirista politician. He fought the Apaches to their extermination. He was elected governor of Coahuila in 1885. harassed the mayor of Cuatro Cienegas, Venustiano Carranza, to force him to resign. When he tried to reelect, the powerful families Madero and Carranza led a rebellion that ended with the intervention of Bernardo Reyes, who as representative of Porfirio Díaz deposed Garza Galan (1890).

<text>AltGr (also Alt Graph) is a modifier key found on computer keyboards. It is primarily used to type characters that are used less frequently in the language that the keyboard is designed for, such as foreign currency symbols, typographic marks and accented letters. 
The AltGr key is used to access a third and a fourth grapheme for most keys. Most are accented variants of the letters on the keys, but some are additional symbols and punctuation marks. Some languages, such as Bengali, use this key when the number of letters of their alphabet is too large for a standard keyboard. For example, when the US-International keyboard mapping is active, the key can be used to insert four different characters:
* → c (lowercase — first level)
* → C (uppercase — second level)
* → © (copyright sign — third level)
* → ¢ (cent sign — fourth level)

On keyboard layouts that do not include an AltGr key, such as US keyboards, the key position is labelled as a right-hand Alt key. When a relevant keyboard mapping is chosen in the operating system, this key will function separately as AltGr (despite being marked identically to the left-hand Alt key). In macOS, the Option key has functions similar to the AltGr key.

==History==

IBM states that &quot;AltGr&quot; is an abbreviation for alternate graphic.
A key labelled with some variation of &quot;Alt Graphic&quot; was on many computer keyboards before the Windows international layouts. On early home computers the alternate graphemes were primarily box-drawing characters.

This likely was the intended purpose of the Alt key on PC keyboards, however software quickly used this as a combination key for shortcuts, requiring a new key for producing additional characters.

===Ctrl+Alt===
Windows interprets as , to accommodate some compact keyboards like those of netbooks which have neither the AltGr key nor a right-hand Alt key. Thus has the same effect as . Because of this feature, Microsoft advises that not be used as part of any application keyboard shortcut, as it would prevent typing the matching character on such keyboards.

== Function by default national keyboard==
In most of the keyboard diagrams the symbol one gets when holding down AltGr is in blue in the lower-right of the corner. If different, the symbol for Shift+AltGr is shown in the upper-right.

===Bangladesh===
=== Belgium ===
The Windows version of the Belgian keyboard may only support a subset of these characters. Several of the AltGr combinations are themselves dead keys, which are followed by another letter to produce an accented version of that letter.

=== Brazil ===


==== Some notes ====
* The combination results in the (obsolete) symbol ₢ for the former Brazilian currency, the Brazilian cruzeiro.
* The , , combinations are useful as a replacement for the &quot;/?&quot; key, which is physically absent on non-Brazilian keyboards.
* Some software (e.g. Microsoft Word) will map to ® and to ™.

=== Finland ===
The new Finnish keyboard standard of 2008 (SFS 5966) was designed for easily typing 1) Finnish, Swedish, Danish and Norwegian; 2) Nordic minority languages and 3) European Latin letters (based on MES-2, with emphasis on contemporary proper nouns), without needing engravings different from those on existing standard keyboards of Finland and Sweden. AltGr and dead diacritic keys are extensively used, although letters of Finnish and Swedish are mostly provided as normal keys.

=== France ===
On AZERTY keyboards, AltGr enables the user to type the following characters:
=== Germany ===
On German keyboards, AltGr enables the user to type the following characters, which are indicated on the keyboard:
Windows 8 introduced the ability of pressing to produce ẞ (capital ß). Even though this is usually not indicated on the physical keyboard—potentially due to a lack of space, since the ß-key already has three different levels ( → &quot;ß&quot;, → &quot;?&quot;, and, as shown above, → &quot;\&quot;)—, it can be seen in the Windows On-Screen Keyboard by selecting the necessary keys with the German keyboard layout selected. Some newer types of German keyboards offer the assignment → capital ß.

=== Greece ===
Some of these key combinations also result in different characters if the polytonic layout is used.

=== Israel ===
==== Hebrew====
On Hebrew keyboards, AltGr enables the user to type the Hebrew vowels and pronunciation marks.
In addition, there are several combinations for special characters:

* → €
* → ₪
* → °
* → ֫
* → ֽ
* → ×
* → LRM
* → RLM

* → ־
* → –
* → ÷
* ‎ → ”
* ‎ → “
* ‎ → „
* ‎ → ’

* ‎ → ‘
* ‎ → ‚
* → ׳
* → ״
* ‎ → ׆
==== Yiddish ====
Using a Hebrew keyboard, one may write in Yiddish as the two languages share many letters. However, Yiddish has some additional digraphs not otherwise found in Hebrew, which are entered via AltGr:
* ‎ → 
* ‎ → 
=== Italy ===

On Italian keyboards, AltGr enables the user to type the following characters:
* → €
* → @

* → ]
* → }
There is an alternate layout, which differ just in disposition of characters accessible through AltGr and includes the tilde and the curly brackets.

=== Nordic countries and Estonia ===
The keyboard layouts in the Nordic countries Denmark (DK), Faroe Islands (FO), Finland (FI), Norway (NO) and Sweden (SE) as well as in Estonia (EE) are largely similar to each other. Generally the AltGr key can be used to create the following characters:
* → @
* → $
* → 
* → [
* → }
* → ~ (excluding EE)
Other AltGr combinations are peculiar to just some of the countries:
* → \ (EE, FI, SE)
* → | (EE, FI, SE)
* → \ (DK, FO)
* → | (DK, FO)
* → ´ (NO)
* → ~ (FO)
* → ¨ (FO)

* → ^ (FO)
* → € (NO, DK, FO, SE, sometimes FI)
* → š (EE, sometimes FI)
* → ž (EE, sometimes FI)
* → § (EE)
* → ½ (EE)
==== Finnish multilingual ====
The Finnish multilingual keyboard standard adds many new characters to the traditional layout via the AltGr key, as shown in the image below (the blue characters can be written with the AltGr key; several dead key diacritics, shown in red, are also available as an AltGr combination).

=== Poland ===
Typewriters in Poland used a QWERTZ layout specifically designed for the Polish language with accented letters in the Polish alphabet obtainable directly. When personal computers became available worldwide in the 1980s, commercial importing into Poland was not supported by its communist government, so most machines in Poland were brought in by private individuals. Most had US keyboards, and various methods were devised to make available the accented Polish letters. An established method was to configure the rightAlt key as an AltGr key and to use it in combination with a Latin base letter to obtain the equivalent precomposed character (accented form of the letter). 
* → ą
* → ć
* → ę
* → ł
* → ń
* → ó
* → ś
* → ź 
* → ż
(Because there are two types of &quot;z with diacritic&quot; ( and ), is a special case.)

At the time of the Fall of communism and opening of commercial import channels this practice was so widespread that it was adopted as the de facto standard. Nowadays nearly all PCs in Poland have standard US keyboards and use the AltGr method to enter Polish diacritics. This keyboard mapping is referred to as the &quot;Polish programmers&#x27; layout&quot; (&quot;&quot;) or simply &quot;Polish layout&quot;.

Another layout is still used on typewriters, mostly by professional typists. Computer keyboards with this layout are available, though difficult to find, and supported by a number of operating systems; they are known as &quot;Polish typists&#x27; layout&quot; (&quot;&quot;). Older Polish versions of Microsoft Windows used this layout, describing it as &quot;Polish layout&quot;. On current versions it is referred to as &quot;Polish (214)&quot;.

=== Russia ===
Since release 1903, versions of Windows 10 have the binding:
* → ₽ (Ruble sign)

=== South Slavic Latin and Czech keyboards===
On South Slavic Latin (used in Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia) and on Czech keyboards, the following letters and special characters are created using AltGr:
* → \
* → €
* → ×
* → ]
* → ł
* → Ł
* → ß
* → @
* → }
* → &lt;
* → ~
* → ˇ

* → °
* → `
* → ´
* → ¨


South Slavic cyrillic keyboards use a different layout.

=== Switzerland ===
On Swiss keyboards, AltGr in combination with the following keys types the following characters:
* → ¦
* → #

* → ¬
* → ¢
* → €
* → ´ (dead key)
* → ~ (dead key)

* / → [ (See explanation below)
* / → { (See explanation below)


Switzerland has four national Languages (German, French, Italian, and Romansh). The Swiss keyboard layout is therefore designed with compatibility in mind for all four languages. In German-speaking and Romansh-speaking Switzerland (as well as the Czech Republic), the Swiss German layout is used, while in the French-speaking and Italian-speaking Switzerland, the Swiss French layout is used. The two layouts only differ on three keys—OEM1, OEM5, and OEM7. On the Swiss German layout, these three keys are labelled , , and , respectively, while on the Swiss French layout, the labels are inverted as , , and ; namely, the base layer and the layer are swapped. However, with respect to the layer, the region-specific layouts are irrelevant.

Swiss German: → {

Swiss French: → {

=== Turkey ===
In Turkish keyboard variants the AltGr can be used to display the following characters:
* → æ
* → ß
* → ₺
* → i
* a → ã
* a → ä
* a → á
* a → à
=== Ukraine ===
In Ukrainian (enhanced) keyboard, added in Windows Vista, combination (or as it is written in Cyrillic keyboards gives letter ґ and Ґ.

=== United Kingdom and Ireland ===

* → á and Á
* → é and É
* → í and Í
* → ó and Ó
* → ú and Ú
* → \


In UK and Ireland keyboard layouts, only two alternative use symbols are printed on most keyboards, which require the AltGr key to function. These are:
* € the euro sign. Located on the &quot;4/$&quot; key.
* ¦ the broken bar symbol. Located on the &quot;`/¬&quot; key, to the immediate left of &quot;1&quot;.

Using the AltGr key on Linux produces many other characters and symbols, e.g. (If reconfigured as a compose key, an even larger repertoire is available). 

With the UK extended keyboard setting (below), ChromeOS offers a large repertoire of symbols and precomposed characters.

====Scotland and Wales====
For the diacritics used by Welsh (ŵ and ŷ) and Scottish Gaelic (à, è, ì, ò and ù), the UK extended keyboard setting is needed. This makes available (for circumflex accent) and (for grave accent) as dead keys.

====UK extended keyboard layout====
The UK-Extended keyboard mapping (available with Microsoft Windows, Linux and ChromeOS) allows many characters with diacritical marks (including those used in other European countries) to be generated by using the AltGr key, dead keys or a compose key, in combination with others.

 &lt;br&gt;] 
|◉||A &lt;br&gt;a ||S &lt;br&gt;s ||D &lt;br&gt;d ||F &lt;br&gt;f ||G &lt;br&gt;g ||H &lt;br&gt;h ||J &lt;br&gt;j ||K &lt;br&gt;k ||L &lt;br&gt;l ||: &lt;br&gt;; ||@ &lt;br&gt;&#x27; ||~ &lt;br&gt;# 
|shift||| &lt;br&gt;\ ||Z &lt;br&gt;z ||X &lt;br&gt;x ||C &lt;br&gt;c ||V &lt;br&gt;v ||B &lt;br&gt;b ||N &lt;br&gt;n ||M &lt;br&gt;m ||&lt; &lt;br&gt;, ||&gt; &lt;br&gt;. ||? &lt;br&gt;/ ||
Notes: Dotted circle (◌) is used here to indicate a dead key, invoked using AltGr. The (grave accent) key is the only one that acts as a free-standing dead key and thus does not respond as shown on the key-cap. (For a complete list of the characters generated using dead keys, see QWERTY#ChromeOS.) 
 (°) is a degree sign; (º) is a masculine ordinal indicator. is an em-dash; there is no provision for en-dash.

=== United States ===
Most keyboards sold in the US do not have an (engraved) key. However, if there is a right-hand key it will act as if a layout using it is installed (conversely a foreign keyboard will act like the right-hand if the standard US keyboard layout is installed).

====US-International====

Microsoft provides a US-International keyboard layout that uses (or right-hand or ) key to produce more characters:
Red characters are dead keys; for example ä can be entered with .

Other operating systems such as Linux and ChromeOS follow this layout but increase the repertoire of glyphs provided.

== X Window System ==
In the X Window System (Linux, BSD, Unix), AltGr can often be used to produce additional characters with almost every key on the keyboard. 
Furthermore, with some keys, AltGr will produce a dead key; for example on a UK keyboard, semicolon can be used to add an acute accent to a base letter, and left square bracket can be used to add a trema:
* followed by → é
* followed by → Ö

This use of dead keys enables one to type a wide variety of precomposed characters that combine various diacritics with either uppercase or lowercase letters, achieving a similar effect to the Compose key.

===Keyboard maps===

Below are some diagrams and examples of country-specific key maps. For the diagrams, the grey symbols are the standard characters, yellow is with , red is with , and blue is with .

====Danish keyboard====

The Danish keymap features the following key combinations:
* → Ω
* → œ

====Italian keyboard====
The Italian keymap includes, among other combinations, the following:
* → ħ

* → ×
==== Norwegian keyboard ====
==== Polish keyboard ====
The Polish keymap on X-based systems features changed combination for € sign:
 results in ↓ instead.
It also introduces several symbols and characters from different languages, including among others:
* → ß
* → þ
* → ð
* → π
* → Ω
* → ∞
* → æ
* → œ

<text>Arnold Dwight &quot;Gatemouth&quot; Moore (November 8, 1913 – May 19, 2004) was an American blues and gospel singer, songwriter, radio disc jockey, community leader and pastor, later known as Reverend Gatemouth Moore. During his career as a recording artist, Moore worked with Bennie Moten, Tommy Douglas and Walter Barnes, and his songs were recorded by B.B. King and Rufus Thomas. He was noted for his mellow singing voice, much in the style of Billy Eckstine.

==Biography==
Moore was born in Topeka, Kansas, and raised in Memphis, Tennessee, where he sang ballads and spirituals in his youth. He graduated from Booker T. Washington High School in Memphis. Around 1930 he left home, joined F. S. Wolcott&#x27;s Rabbit&#x27;s Foot Minstrels, and began performing with Ida Cox, Ma Rainey and Bertha &quot;Chippie&quot; Hill. He toured widely but settled in Clarksdale, Mississippi, around 1934.

According to some sources his nickname was derived from his loud speaking and singing voice, but Moore himself repeated a story that at a performance in Atlanta a drunken woman told him to &quot;sing it, you gatemouth sonofabitch&quot;. He sang with the bands of Bennie Moten and Walter Barnes. In 1940, he was working with Barnes but was outside the hall when Barnes and most of his band died in the Natchez Rhythm Club fire.

He made his first recordings in 1941 for the Gay Paree record label in Kansas City, Missouri, and moved between residencies in Kansas City, Memphis and Chicago. He recorded for Damon Records and National Records and then for King Records in Cincinnati, Ohio. His songs, often improvised and based on actual incidents in his life, included &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Mad at You Pretty Baby&quot;, &quot;Did You Ever Love a Woman&quot;, and &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Got to Go&quot;. Several of his compositions were recorded by other performers, including Louis Jordan, Lonnie Johnson, Johnny Otis, Rufus Thomas, Jimmy Witherspoon, and B. B. King, who regarded Moore as a major influence and as &quot;one of the greatest blues singers ever&quot;. Moore re-recorded many of his songs for King in 1947. He was also responsible for recruiting the blues singer Wynonie Harris to the label.

Moore was reportedly the first blues singer to perform at the Apollo Theater and many other theaters around the country, including Carnegie Hall in New York City. In Chicago, he appeared regularly at the Rhumboogie and at the Club DeLisa. At the latter club, in December 1948, he shocked clubgoers by stopping his performance of &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Mad at You Pretty Baby&quot; and singing an old spiritual. Moore said, &quot;Folks started screaming. They thought I had lost my mind. I just singing and crying &#x27;Shine on Me&#x27;... I walked off [stage] and walked right out the club and folks were hollering and screaming. When I walked out to the bar, one of the greatest preachers in Chicago was sitting out there and said, &#x27;Gate, I be waiting on you&#x27;.&quot;

In 1949, Moore was ordained as a minister of the First Church of Deliverance in Chicago, becoming a bishop. He maintained his flair for showmanship in his work as a minister and gospel singer, on one occasion delivering an Easter sermon from a funeral casket with hearse and pallbearers, to raise money for charity. He recorded gospel music for Chess and Coral and became a DJ at radio stations in Memphis, Birmingham, and Chicago. He also became the pastor of several churches in Mississippi and Louisiana, including in later years Yazoo City, Mississippi. According to his citation on the Mississippi Blues Trail, &quot;His elegance and exuberance enabled him to easily cross social, racial, and religious lines, and though he devoted himself to the church, community work, charities, and education, he still enjoyed singing the blues on occasion.&quot; He became an MC at both blues festivals and religious conventions, president of the Birmingham Black Barons baseball team, and a leader of the &quot;black Elks&quot; (Improved Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks of the World).

He made his last recordings for Johnny Otis&#x27; Blues Spectrum label in 1977, including a new song, &quot;Beale Street Ain&#x27;t Beale Street No More&quot;. A brass note on Beale Street Walk of Fame was dedicated to Moore in 1996. He was also featured in the documentary film &quot;The Road to Memphis&quot;, directed and photographed by Richard Pearce), a part of the 2003 series &quot;The Blues&quot;, of which Martin Scorsese was the executive producer.

He died in Yazoo City, Mississippi, in 2004 at the age of 90.

<text>In music, a permutation (order) of a set is any ordering of the elements of that set. A specific arrangement of a set of discrete entities, or parameters, such as pitch, dynamics, or timbre. Different permutations may be related by transformation, through the application of zero or more &quot;operations&quot;, such as transposition, inversion, retrogradation, circular permutation (also called &quot;rotation&quot;), or multiplicative operations (such as the cycle of fourths and cycle of fifths transforms). These may produce reorderings of the members of the set, or may simply map the set onto itself.

Order is particularly important in the theories of composition techniques originating in the 20th century such as the twelve-tone technique and serialism. Analytical techniques such as set theory take care to distinguish between ordered and unordered collections. In traditional theory concepts like voicing and form include ordering; for example, many musical forms, such as rondo, are defined by the order of their sections.

The &quot;permutations&quot; resulting from applying the &quot;inversion&quot; or &quot;retrograde&quot; operations are categorized as the prime form&#x27;s &quot;inversions&quot; and &quot;retrogrades&quot;, respectively. Applying both &quot;inversion&quot; and &quot;retrograde&quot; to a prime form produces its &quot;retrograde-inversions&quot;, considered a distinct type of permutation. 

Permutation may be applied to smaller sets as well. However, transformation operations of such smaller sets do not necessarily result in permutation the original set. Here is an example of non-permutation of trichords, using retrogradation, inversion, and retrograde-inversion, combined in each case with transposition, as found within the tone row (or twelve-tone series) from Anton Webern&#x27;s Concerto:

: &lt;score vorbis=&quot;1&quot; lang=&quot;lilypond&quot;&gt;
\override Score.TimeSignature
#&#x27;stencil = ##f
\override Score.SpacingSpanner.strict-note-spacing = ##t
 \set Score.proportionalNotationDuration = #(ly:make-moment 1/1)
 \relative c&quot; {
 \time 3/1
 \set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \tempo 1 = 60
 b1 bes d 
 es, g fis 
 aes e f 
 c&#x27; cis a
}
&lt;/score&gt;

If the first three notes are regarded as the &quot;original&quot; cell, then the next 3 are its transposed retrograde-inversion (backwards and upside down), the next three are the transposed retrograde (backwards), and the last 3 are its transposed inversion (upside down).

Not all prime series have the same number of variations because the transposed and inverse transformations of a tone row may be identical, a quite rare phenomenon: less than 0.06% of all series admit 24 forms instead of 48.

One technique facilitating twelve-tone permutation is the use of number values corresponding with musical letters. The first note of the first of the primes, actually prime zero (commonly mistaken for prime one), is represented by 0. The rest of the numbers are counted half-step-wise such that: B = 0, C = 1, C/D = 2, D = 3, D/E = 4, E = 5, F = 6, F/G = 7, G = 8, G/A = 9, A = 10, and A/B = 11.

&quot;Prime zero&quot; is retrieved entirely by choice of the composer. To receive the &quot;retrograde&quot; of any given prime, the numbers are simply rewritten backwards. To receive the &quot;inversion&quot; of any prime, each number value is subtracted from 12 and the resulting number placed in the corresponding matrix cell (see twelve-tone technique). The &quot;retrograde inversion&quot; is the values of the inversion numbers read backwards. 

Therefore:

A given prime zero (derived from the notes of Anton Webern&#x27;s Concerto):

 0, 11, 3, 4, 8, 7, 9, 5, 6, 1, 2, 10

The retrograde:

 10, 2, 1, 6, 5, 9, 7, 8, 4, 3, 11, 0

The inversion:
 0, 1, 9, 8, 4, 5, 3, 7, 6, 11, 10, 2

The retrograde inversion:

 2, 10, 11, 6, 7, 3, 5, 4, 8, 9, 1, 0

More generally, a musical &quot;permutation&quot; is any reordering of the prime form of an ordered set of pitch classes or, with respect to twelve-tone rows, any ordering at all of the set consisting of the integers modulo 12. In that regard, a musical permutation is a combinatorial permutation from mathematics as it applies to music. Permutations are in no way limited to the twelve-tone serial and atonal musics, but are just as well utilized in tonal melodies especially during the 20th and 21st centuries, notably in Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Variations on the Theme of Paganini for orchestra and piano.

Cyclical permutation (also called rotation) is the maintenance of the original order of the tone row with the only change being the initial pitch class, with the original order following after. A secondary set may be considered a cyclical permutation beginning on the sixth member of a hexachordally combinatorial row. The tone row from Berg&#x27;s &quot;Lyric Suite&quot;, for example, is realized thematically and then cyclically permuted (0 is bolded for reference):
 5 4 0 9 7 2 8 1 3 6 t e
 3 6 t e 5 4 0 9 7 2 8 1

<text>The Michigan Senate is the upper house of the Michigan Legislature. Along with the Michigan House of Representatives, it composes the state legislature, which has powers, roles and duties defined by Article IV of the Michigan Constitution, adopted in 1963. The primary purpose of the Legislature is to enact new laws and amend or repeal existing laws.

The Michigan Senate is composed of 38 members, each elected from a single-member district with a population of between approximately 212,400 to 263,500 residents. Legislative districts are drawn on the basis of population figures, provided by the federal decennial census. In January 2023, Democrats took the majority with 20 seats to Republicans&#x27; 18 seats. The Senate chamber is located in the State Capitol building.

==Titles==
Members of the Michigan Senate are called senators. Because this shadows the terminology used to describe members of the United States Senate, constituents and the news media, using &quot;The Associated Press Stylebook&quot;, often refer to members of the Michigan Senate as state senators when necessary to avoid confusion with their federal counterparts.

==Terms==
Senators are elected on a partisan basis for four-year terms, concurrent with the election of the Governor of Michigan. Terms for senators begin on January 1 at noon, following the November general election and end on January 1 when their replacements are sworn in.

Senate elections are always held two years after the election for President of the United States, with the next election scheduled for November 3, 2026.

==Term limits==
On November 3, 1992, almost 59 percent of Michigan voters backed Proposal B, the Michigan Term Limits Amendment, which amended the state constitution, to enact term limits on federal and state officials. In 1995, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states could not enact congressional term limits, but ruled that the state-level term limits remain. Under the amendment, a person could be elected to the state senate two times. A provision governing partial terms was also included. These provisions became Article IV, section 54 and Article V, section 30 of the Michigan Constitution. On November 8, 2022, nearly 2 in 3 voters approved Proposal 1, limiting state legislators to 12 years combined in either chamber of the legislature, but incumbent senators re-elected in 2022 would remain eligible for their new terms even if it pushed them over the 12-year limit.

==Qualifications==
Each senator must be a citizen of the United States, at least 21 years of age, and an elector of the district they represent. Under state law, moving out of the district shall be deemed a vacation of the office. No person who has been convicted of subversion or who has within the preceding 20 years been convicted of a felony involving a breach of public trust shall be eligible for either house of the legislature.

==Legislative session==
For reckoning periods of time during which the legislature operates, each two-year period coinciding with the election of new members of the House of Representatives is numbered consecutively as a legislature, dating to the first legislature following Michigan&#x27;s admission as a state. The current two-year term of the legislature (January 1, 2025 – December 31, 2026) is the 103rd Legislature.

Each year during which the legislature meets constitutes a new legislative session. According to Article IV Section 13 of the State Constitution, a new session of the legislature begins when the members of each house convene, on the second Wednesday of January every year at noon. A regular session of the legislature typically lasts throughout the entire year with several periods of recess and adjourns &quot;sine die&quot; in late December.

The Michigan legislature is one of ten full-time state legislative bodies in the United States. Members receive a base salary of $71,685 per year, which makes them the fourth-highest paid state legislators in the country, after California, Pennsylvania and New York. While legislators in many states receive per diems that make up for lower salaries, Michigan legislators receive $10,800 per year for session and interim expenses. Salaries and expense allowances are determined by the State Officers Compensation Commission.

Any legislation pending in either chamber at the end of a session that is not the end of a legislative term of office continues and carries over to the next legislative session.

==Powers and process==
The Michigan legislature is authorized by the Michigan Constitution to create and amend the laws of the U.S. state of Michigan, subject to the governor&#x27;s power to veto legislation. To do so, legislators propose legislation in the forms of bills drafted by a nonpartisan, professional staff. Successful legislation must undergo committee review, three readings on the floor of each house, with appropriate voting majorities, as required, and either be signed into law by the governor or enacted through a veto override approved by two-thirds of the membership of each legislative house.

== Composition ==
===Leadership===
The Michigan Senate is headed by the Lieutenant Governor of Michigan, who serves as President of the Senate but may cast a vote only in the instance of a tie. The presiding officers of the senate, apart from the president, are elected by the body at its first session and serve until their term of office is up. Majority and minority party officers are elected at the same time by their respective caucuses.

The senate majority leader controls the assignment of committees and leadership positions, along with control of the agenda in the chamber.

<doc id="668177" wikidata="Q5550871" url="?curid=668177" title="Geritol">
<text>Geritol is a United States trademarked name for various dietary supplements, past and present. Geritol is a brand name for several vitamin complexes plus iron or multimineral products in both liquid form and tablets containing from 9.5 to 18 mg of iron per daily dose. The name conveys a connection with aging, as in &quot;geriatric.&quot; The product has been promoted from almost the beginning of the mass media era as a cure for &quot;iron-poor tired blood.&quot;

==History==
Geritol was introduced as an alcohol-based, iron and B vitamin tonic by Pharmaceuticals, Inc., in August 1950 and primarily marketed as such into the 1970s. Geritol was folded into Pharmaceuticals&#x27; 1957 acquisition of J. B. Williams Co., founded in 1885. J. B. Williams Co. was bought by Nabisco in 1971. In 1982, the Geritol product name was acquired by the multinational pharmaceutical firm Beecham (later GlaxoSmithKline). Geritol was acquired by Meda Pharmaceutical in 2011. Meda was acquired by Mylan in 2016.

The earlier Geritol liquid formulation was advertised as &quot;twice the iron in a pound of calf&#x27;s liver,&quot; and daily doses contained about 50–100 milligrams of iron as ferric ammonium citrate. The Geritol tonic contained about 12% alcohol and some B vitamins.

==Federal Trade Commission investigation==
Geritol was the subject of years of investigation starting in 1959 by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). In 1965, the FTC ordered the makers of Geritol to disclose that Geritol would relieve symptoms of tiredness only in persons who suffer from iron deficiency anemia, and that the vast majority of people who experience such symptoms do not have such a deficiency. Geritol&#x27;s claims were discredited in court findings as &quot;conduct amounted to gross negligence and bordered on recklessness,&quot; ruled as a false and misleading claim, and heavily penalized with fines totaling $812,000 (equivalent to $ in dollars), the largest FTC fine up to that date (1973). Although subsequent trials and appeals from 1965 to 1973 concluded that some of the FTC demands exceeded its authority, Geritol was already well known and continued to be the largest U.S. company selling iron and B-vitamin supplements through 1979.

A 1976 settlement agreement between J.B. Williams &amp; Co. and the FTC had the company agreeing to pay $125,000 ($ in dollars).

Since then, supplemental iron products, including Geritol, have been contraindicated because of concerns over hemochromatosis, and serious questions raised in studies for men, postmenopausal women, and nonanemic patients with liver disease, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, or cancer.

==Media sponsorships==
In the early days of television, the marketing of Geritol was involved in the quiz show scandal, as the sponsor of &quot;Twenty-One&quot;. For many years after that, Geritol was largely marketed on television programs that appealed primarily to older viewers, such as &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot;, &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, &quot;Hee Haw&quot;, and &quot;Ted Mack&#x27;s Original Amateur Hour&quot;, as well as Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s daily show. It was also one of the sponsors of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series.

== In popular culture ==
Geritol was often used in the 1960s as a punch line for a joke in sitcoms or in comedy routines; comic singer Allan Sherman referenced Geritol on his 1962 album &quot;My Son, the Folk Singer&quot;, singing &quot;Yasha got a bottle of Geritol&quot; to the tune of &quot;Joshua Fought the Battle of Jericho&quot;.

Geritol is famous for a controversial 1972 television commercial tag line, &quot;My wife, I think I&#x27;ll keep her.&quot; This line, brought out during the height of the Women&#x27;s Liberation Movement, was not appreciated by some women and was lambasted by news and comedy shows. Comedian Robert Klein commented on his 1972 album &quot;Child of the Fifties&quot;: &quot;Where does he get the nerve?... She has to keep begging him, &quot;Will you keep me one more day?&quot; &quot;All right, one more day: now, get back to the kitchen!&quot; The line was the inspiration for Mary Chapin Carpenter&#x27;s 1993 song &quot;He Thinks He&#x27;ll Keep Her&quot;.

In 1992, George Jones used the line “I don&#x27;t need your rockin&#x27; chair, your Geritol or your Medicare” in his hit song &quot;I Don&#x27;t Need Your Rockin&#x27; Chair&quot;.

In 1994, a reunion of members of Bill Haley &amp; His Comets released the album &quot;You&#x27;re Never Too Old to Rock&quot; (Hydra Records BCK 27013). One track, &quot;Let&#x27;s Rock and Roll Some More&quot; features 70-year-old drummer Dick Richards singing &quot;We&#x27;ve been away a while, but we ain&#x27;t gone/Take a Geritol and put your dancin&#x27; shoes on.&quot;

In the 2002 stage musical &quot;Hairspray&quot;, Edna and Wilbur Turnblad sing to each other of love as they grow old in the song &quot;Timeless to Me&quot;. In one line, Edna sings &quot;Pass that Geritol!&quot;

<text>Mavis Hutchison (25 November 1924 – 19 May 2022) was a South African athlete, primarily known for running in ultramarathons.

==Career==
Born in South Africa, Hutchison&#x27;s career began as a race walker, and her first record was in the 50-mile walk known as the Rand Daily Mail Big Walk in 1963 (9 hours 35 minutes). That same year she was timed over the standard marathon distance of 42.2 km, but took about ten minutes longer than Violet Piercy had done in 1926, and 13 minutes longer than Merry Lepper&#x27;s time a few months later.

In 1965, she was (as an unofficial entrant) the third woman in history to finish the 90 km of the Comrades Marathon, and the first since the 1930s. In later years she completed the race seven more times (1966, 1971, 1973, 1976, 1977, 1980, 1981).

Hutchison went on to set new women&#x27;s world records for the 100-mile and 24-hour run in 1971, and for the 100-mile and 24-hour walk in 1973. In 1973 Hutchison became the first woman to run the 602 km from Germiston (near Johannesburg) to Durban in 1973, following this with the &#x27;up&#x27; run from Durban to Germiston the following year. By this time she was well known in South Africa as the &#x27;Galloping Granny&#x27;. In 1975 she took a bit over 22 days to run the 1000 miles from Pretoria, South Africa&#x27;s administrative capital, to Cape Town, the legislative capital. That same year she entered the Comrades for the first time as an official participant, even though the Pretoria to Cape Town run had left her in poor shape for the race, but dropped out toward the end when she realized she would finish outside the maximum allowed time of 11 hours. In 1976 she ran from Germiston to Cape Town (about the same distance), beating her previous time by more than three days, and in 1977 she ran from Messina, on South Africa&#x27;s northern border, to Johannesburg.

Hutchison became famous as the first woman to run across the United States, from Los Angeles to New York City. Her route, run in 1978 as a 53-year-old grandmother, took her 2871 miles and 69 days, 2hours and 40 minutes. According to the Guinness Book of Records this record still stands, although there is a claim by Lorna Michael (age 34) in 1993, of 64 days as part of the Trans-America Footrace in 1993.

Two years later, Hutchison set a new women&#x27;s record for the John O&#x27;Groats to Land&#x27;s End, once more fighting extreme physical difficulties to reach her goal. Her last long runs were from Pretoria to Cape Town in 1982, and a circuitous 3200 km run around much of South Africa in 1985, starting in Kimberley and ending in Cape Town.

Hutchison first entered the World Master&#x27;s Games in 1977 (Gothenburg Sweden), and subsequently entered the Master&#x27;s Games in 1979 (Hanover Germany), 1993 (Maizaki Japan), 2006 (San Sebastian Spain) and 2007 (Riccione Italy), winning numerous medals.

From 2005, Hutchison set South African W80+ master records for 100 metres (18.84 sec), 200 metres (45.46 sec), 400 metres (1:52.88 min), and 800 metres (4:34.13 min).

==Death==
Hutchison died in Fish Hoek on 19 May 2022, at the age of 97.

<doc id="668180" wikidata="Q1494590" url="?curid=668180" title="Michigan House of Representatives">
<text>The Michigan House of Representatives is the lower house of the Michigan Legislature. There are 110 members, each of whom is elected from constituencies having approximately 77,000 to 91,000 residents, based on population figures from the 2020 U.S. census. Its composition, powers and duties are established in Article IV of the Michigan Constitution.

Members are elected in even-numbered years and take office at 12 p.m. (EST) on January 1 following the November general election. Concurrently with the Michigan Senate, the House first convenes on the second Wednesday in January, according to the state constitution. Each member is limited to serving at most six terms of two years, but may not serve more than twelve years combined across the Michigan House and Michigan Senate. The House meets in the north wing of the Michigan Capitol in Lansing. The Republican Party currently has a majority in the chamber.

In recent years, the Republican majority in the House has been widely attributed to Republican gerrymandering, implemented by the legislature after the 2010 census. In many legislative elections since then, the Democratic Party has won the popular vote, but nonetheless failed to attain a majority. However, after the passage of Proposal 2, a 2018 ballot initiative, redistricting in the state was instead delegated to a nonpartisan commission, which drew new maps after the 2020 census. Aided by the redrawn district lines, in 2022, Democrats won a majority in the House for the first time since 2008. Then, in 2024, Republicans took back the House, defeating four Democratic incumbents to achieve a 58-52 seat majority. 

==Qualifications==
According to the constitution of Michigan, to be eligible for the office of State Representative a person must be a citizen of the United States, at least 21 years of age, and a registered and qualified elector of the district he or she wishes to represent by the filing deadline.

==Title==
Members of the Michigan House of Representatives are commonly referred to as representatives. Because this mirrors the terminology used to describe members of Congress, constituents and news media, abiding by the Associated Press guidelines for journalists, often refer to members as state representatives to avoid confusion with their federal counterparts. As elected officials, members of the Michigan House of Representatives also receive the courtesy title of &quot;the Honorable&quot; (abbreviated to &quot;Hon.&quot; or &quot;Hon&#x27;ble&quot;) for life.

== Composition ==
==Leadership==

===Majority party===

*Speaker of the House: Matt Hall of Richland Township (R-42)
*Speaker pro tempore: Rachelle Smit of Shelbyville (R-43)
*Majority Floor Leader: Bryan Posthumus of Cannon Township (R-90)

===Minority party===

*Minority Leader: Ranjeev Puri of Canton (D-24)
*Minority Floor Leader: John Fitzgerald of Wyoming (D-83)

== Members ==
*↑: First elected in a special election.

==Officials==

===Speaker of the House===
The 77th and current Speaker of the House of Representatives is the presiding officer of the House and the leader of the majority party. The current Speaker is Matt Hall, a Republican from Battle Creek.

The Speaker calls the House to order at the hour to which the House last adjourned, preserves order and decorum in the chamber, recognizes Members to speak, and puts all questions. The Speaker is the chief administrator of the House and is technically the employer of all legislative staff. There is also a Speaker &quot;pro tempore&quot; and two associate Speakers &quot;pro tempore&quot; who preside in the absence of the Speaker. The full duties of the Speaker are described in Chapter II of the Rules of the House.

===Clerk of the House===

The Clerk of the House of Representatives is elected by Members of the House at the beginning of each two-year term. The 33rd and current clerk is Gary L. Randall. Randall also served as clerk from 1999 to 2006. The assistant clerk is Richard J. Brown, who served as clerk from 2007 to 2010. Both Randall and Brown are former Members of the House.

Under the rules of the House, the clerk is the parliamentarian of the House, presides in the absence of the Speaker or any Speaker pro tempore, takes roll at the beginning of each session day and announces whether or not a quorum is present, prepares the official calendar and journal of the House, is responsible for the care and preservation of all bills introduced in the House, and for bills sent from the Senate until they are returned to the Senate.

===Sergeant at Arms===
The sergeant at arms of the House of Representatives is the chief police officer of the House, appointed by the Speaker. The current chief sergeant at arms is David D. Dickson Jr.

The chief sergeant and the assistant sergeants are empowered as law enforcement officers by statute. The sergeants at arms have authority to serve subpoenas and warrants 
issued by the House or any duly authorized officer or committee, see that all visitors are seated and at no time are standing on the floor or balconies of the House, ensure that reasonable decorum is maintained in the lobby immediately in front of the entrance to the chamber to ensure access for Members and to ensure equal treatment for all citizens.

==Committees==
Article IV of the Michigan Constitution authorizes each house of the Legislature to &quot;establish the committees necessary for the conduct of its business.&quot; The House does much of its work in committees, including the review of bills, executive oversight, and the budget and appropriations process. Members of committees and their chairmen are appointed by the Speaker. Bills are referred to a committee by the Speaker, and the chairman of a committee sets its agenda, including whether or not a bill will be reported to the full House. The Committee on Appropriations divides its work among subcommittees ordinarily structured by state department or major budget area.

There are also four statutory standing committees: Joint Committee on Administrative Rules; House Fiscal Agency Governing Committee; Legislative Council; Michigan Capitol Committee. Currently, it would appear, the House committees meet on a &#x27;year by year&#x27; basis. A full list may be accessed here.

Unlike the Senate, the House does not utilize the committee of the whole.

==House Fiscal Agency==
The House Fiscal Agency is a nonpartisan agency within the House of Representatives which provides nonpartisan expertise to members of the House Appropriations Committee, as well as all other Members of the House. Fiscal analysts review the governor&#x27;s budget recommendation, review and prepare budget bills, supplemental appropriations, and certain transfer requests, provide fiscal impact statements on legislative proposals, monitor state and national situations that may have budgetary implications, research and analyze fiscal issues, prepare reports and documents to assist legislative deliberations, and prepare special reports at the request of Representatives. The economist analyzes legislation related to tax and lottery issues, respond to Representatives&#x27; inquiries regarding state tax revenue, revenue sharing, and other economic issues, monitors state revenue, tracks state, and national economic conditions, and prepares reports on revenue and other economic issues. Legislative analysts prepare concise, nonpartisan summaries and analyses of bills. Summaries, completed prior to committee deliberations, describe how a bill would change current law, including any fiscal impact. Analyses are prepared for bills reported to the full House from committee and include, with the summary information, a description of the problem being addressed, arguments for and against the bill, and positions of interested organizations.

The agency is governed by a six-member board consisting of the chairman and minority vice chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the Speaker of the House and the minority leader, and the majority and minority floor leaders. The governing committee is responsible for HFA oversight, establishment of operating procedures, and appointment of the HFA director. The director is one of three state officials charged with annually forecasting the state&#x27;s revenues at the Consensus Revenue Estimating Conferences, which are held at least twice each year.

In January 1993, a front-page story in &quot;The Detroit News&quot; detailed a massive scandal in the House Fiscal Agency. For six years, the agency&#x27;s imprest account was used to finance credit card payments, vacations, and property tax payments as well as payments to HFA employees and contract workers for non-existent workers. The scandal threatened to collapse the joint leadership agreement between the Democrats and Republicans brought about by a 55-55 partisan split in the House from the 1992 election. It resulted in Representative Dominic J. Jacobetti of Negaunee in the Upper Peninsula, the longest-serving Member in history, losing his position as chairman of the powerful Appropriations Committee; the conviction and imprisonment of HFA Director John Morberg; and the resignation of state representative Stephen Shepich as part of a plea bargain.

<text>In music, transposition refers to the process or operation of moving a collection of notes (pitches or pitch classes) up or down in pitch by a constant interval.

For example, a music transposer might transpose an entire piece of music into another key. Similarly, one might transpose a tone row or an unordered collection of pitches such as a chord so that it begins on another pitch.

The transposition of a set &quot;A&quot; by &quot;n&quot; semitones is designated by T&quot;n&quot;(&quot;A&quot;), representing the addition (mod 12) of an integer &quot;n&quot; to each of the pitch class integers of the set &quot;A&quot;. Thus the set (&quot;A&quot;) consisting of 0–1–2 transposed by 5 semitones is 5–6–7 (T5(&quot;A&quot;)) since , , and .

==Scalar transpositions==
In scalar transposition, every pitch in a collection is shifted up or down a fixed number of scale steps within some scale. The pitches remain in the same scale before and after the shift. This term covers both chromatic and diatonic transpositions as follows.

===Chromatic transposition===
Chromatic transposition is scalar transposition within the chromatic scale, implying that every pitch in a collection of notes is shifted by the same number of semitones. For instance, transposing the pitches C4–E4–G4 upward by four semitones, one obtains the pitches E4–G4–B4.

===Diatonic transposition===
Diatonic transposition is scalar transposition within a diatonic scale (the most common kind of scale, indicated by one of a few standard key signatures). For example, transposing the pitches C4–E4–G4 up two steps in the familiar C major scale gives the pitches E4–G4–B4. Transposing the same pitches up by two steps in the F major scale instead gives E4–G4–B4.

==Pitch and pitch class transpositions==
There are two further kinds of transposition, by pitch interval or by pitch interval class, applied to pitches or pitch classes, respectively. Transposition may be applied to pitches or to pitch classes. For example, the pitch A4, or 9, transposed by a major third, or the pitch interval 4:
:formula_1
while that pitch class, 9, transposed by a major third, or the pitch class interval 4:
:formula_2.

==Sight transposition==

Although transpositions are usually written out, musicians are occasionally asked to transpose music &quot;at sight&quot;, that is, to read the music in one key while playing in another. Musicians who play transposing instruments sometimes have to do this (for example when encountering an unusual transposition, such as clarinet in C), as well as singers&#x27; accompanists, since singers sometimes request a different key than the one printed in the music to better fit their vocal range (although many, but not all, songs are printed in editions for high, medium, and low voice).

There are three basic techniques for teaching sight transposition: interval, clef, and numbers.

===Interval===
First one determines the interval between the written key and the target key. Then one imagines the notes up (or down) by the corresponding interval. A performer using this method may calculate each note individually, or group notes together (e.g. &quot;a descending chromatic passage starting on F&quot; might become a &quot;descending chromatic passage starting on A&quot; in the target key).

===Clef===
Clef transposition is routinely taught (among other places) in Belgium and France. One imagines a different clef and a different key signature than the ones printed. The change of clef is used so that the lines and spaces correspond to different notes than the lines and spaces of the original score. Seven clefs are used for this: treble (2nd line G-clef), bass (4th line F-clef), baritone (3rd line F-clef or 5th line C-clef, although in France and Belgium sight-reading exercises for this clef, as a preparation for clef transposition practice, are always printed with the 3rd line F-clef), and C-clefs on the four lowest lines; these allow any given staff position to correspond to each of the seven note names A through G. The signature is then adjusted for the actual accidental (natural, sharp or flat) one wants on that note. The octave may also have to be adjusted (this sort of practice ignores the conventional octave implication of the clefs), but this is a trivial matter for most musicians.

===Numbers===
Transposing by numbers means, one determines the scale degree of the written note (e.g. first, fourth, fifth, etc.) in the given key. The performer then plays the corresponding scale degree of the target chord.

==Transpositional equivalence==

Two musical objects are transpositionally equivalent if one can be transformed into another by transposition. It is similar to enharmonic equivalence, octave equivalence, and inversional equivalence. In many musical contexts, transpositionally equivalent chords are thought to be similar. Transpositional equivalence is a feature of musical set theory. The terms &quot;transposition&quot; and &quot;transposition equivalence&quot; allow the concept to be discussed as both an operation and relation, an activity and a state of being. Compare with modulation and related key.

Using integer notation and modulo 12, to transpose a pitch &quot;x&quot; by &quot;n&quot; semitones:
:formula_3
or
:formula_4
For pitch class transposition by a pitch class interval:
:formula_5
==Twelve-tone transposition==

Milton Babbitt defined the &quot;transformation&quot; of transposition within the twelve-tone technique as follows:
By applying the transposition operator (T) to a [twelve-tone] set we will mean that every &quot;p&quot; of the set &quot;P&quot; is mapped homomorphically (with regard to order) into a T(&quot;p&quot;) of the set T(&quot;P&quot;) according to the following operation:
:formula_6
where &quot;to&quot; is any integer 0–11 inclusive, where, of course, the &quot;to&quot; remains fixed for a given transposition. The + sign indicates ordinary transposition. Here &quot;To&quot; is the transposition corresponding to &quot;to&quot; (or &quot;o&quot;, according to Schuijer); &quot;pi,j&quot; is the pitch of the &quot;i&quot;th tone in &quot;P&quot; belong to the pitch class (set number) &quot;j&quot;.

Allen Forte defines transposition so as to apply to unordered sets of other than twelve pitches:
:the addition mod 12 of any integer &quot;k&quot; in &quot;S&quot; to every integer &quot;p&quot; of &quot;P&quot;.
thus giving, &quot;12 transposed forms of &quot;P&quot;&quot;.

==Fuzzy transposition==
Joseph Straus created the concept of fuzzy transposition, and fuzzy inversion, to express transposition as a voice-leading event, &quot;the &#x27;sending&#x27; of each element of a given PC [pitch-class] set to its T&quot;n&quot;-correspondent...[enabling] him to relate PC sets of two adjacent chords in terms of a transposition, even when not all of the &#x27;voices&#x27; participated fully in the transpositional move.&quot;. A transformation within voice-leading space rather than pitch-class space as in pitch class transposition.

<text>William Henry Meredith (30 July 1874 – 19 April 1958) was a Welsh professional footballer. He was considered one of the early superstars of football due to his performances, notably for Manchester City and Manchester United. He won each domestic trophy in the English football league and gained 48 caps for Wales, for whom he scored eleven goals and won two British Home Championship titles. His favoured position was outside right, and his key skills were dribbling, passing, crossing and shooting. A dedicated and extremely fit professional, his habit of chewing on a toothpick during games made him instantly recognisable.

In 27 seasons in the Football League from 1892 to 1924 (not including the four seasons lost to the First World War and the 1905–06 season in which he was banned for bribing an opposition player), he scored 194 goals in 740 league and cup appearances. He played for Chirk before joining Northwich Victoria in 1892. His career took off when he signed with Manchester City in 1894 and turned professional in January 1895. He captained the team to the club&#x27;s first major honour, a 1–0 victory over Bolton Wanderers in the 1904 FA Cup final. He moved to Manchester United in May 1906 after being banned for bribing Aston Villa half-back Alex Leake £10 to lose a match. There, he won the league title in 1907–08 and 1910–11, the FA Cup in 1909, and two FA Charity Shields. He also helped to set up the Players&#x27; Union, which was a forerunner of the Professional Footballers&#x27; Association. He returned to Manchester City in 1921 at age 47 and played 32 games before retiring in 1924, making him the oldest-ever player for City, United and Wales. He later ran the Stretford Road Hotel and helped to coach the short-lived Manchester Central.

==Early life==
Meredith was born in 1874 in Chirk, a small mining town in Denbighshire, Wales, just south of Wrexham. He started work at Black Park Colliery as a pit pony driver at the age of 12. His family were Primitive Methodists, and Meredith himself remained a lifelong teetotaller. He spent eight years working in the mines and worked during a tough time for the industry, enduring a 25% pay cut which led to strike action in 1893; this experience helped to shape his political views, which would become significant later in his life. An interest in football was kindled by his elder brothers. Elias, the eldest, was a train driver for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. His work allowed him to take Meredith to watch professional teams such as Everton. Football was a keen pastime for the miners, and the standard of amateur teams from towns and villages in north east Wales was high as a result; Chirk won the Welsh Cup five times between 1887 and 1894, with miners making up a large proportion of the team. All the Meredith brothers played football, but Sam, two years older than Billy, was the first to make an impression. He left Chirk to attempt a professional career and went on to play for Stoke City as a full-back.

Meredith made his debut for the Chirk first team in September 1892. The club played in The Combination, a league which contained a mixture of town clubs and reserve teams of clubs from big cities. At the end of his first season, Meredith played in the 1893 Welsh Cup final, which Chirk lost 2–1 to Wrexham. Meredith formed a solid understanding with inside-right William Owen, a former Wales international. Chirk withdrew from The Combination and entered only the Welsh league in 1893 due to low attendances caused by the coal miners&#x27; strike. In an attempt to make ends meet, Meredith not only played for Chirk but accepted an offer to play for Football League club Northwich Victoria as well, who gave him a small fee on top of his expenses. Northwich were a struggling side who withdrew from the Football League at the end of the 1893–94 season after finishing bottom of the Second Division. The club won just three league matches; Meredith featured in each win. Back at Chirk, Meredith gained his first honour as part of the team that beat Westminster Rovers to win the 1894 Welsh Cup. Meredith also played for Wrexham in 1894, sharing his talents between them, Chirk and Northwich Victoria that year.

==Club career==

===First spell at Manchester City===
Meredith&#x27;s performances for Northwich gained the attention of several other clubs in the Football League. Bolton Wanderers full-back Di Jones, a former Chirk player, spoke with him about a possible move. Still, Bolton secretary J.J. Bentley felt Meredith was too inexperienced and his frame too slight. Lawrence Furniss, an official at Ardwick, had first noticed him while refereeing a Northwich match. Meredith also played in both meetings between the clubs that season. Later, in 1894, Ardwick, known as Manchester City, vigorously pursued Meredith&#x27;s signature. Two club officials travelled to Wales to meet the player. One was secretary-manager Joshua Parlby, the other either Furniss or chairman John Chapman. The pair were met with suspicion. Anecdotes by contemporary figures suggest locals initially chased them away and were only allowed to speak to Meredith after they bought drinks for his mining colleagues. Meredith did not wish to abandon life in Chirk. His mother was particularly against the idea: &quot;It is all very well for you gentlemen to leave your big cities and come to our villages to steal our boys away ... Our boys are happy and healthy, satisfied with their work and innocent amusements ... if Billy takes my advice he will stick to his work and play football for his own amusement when work is finished.&quot; Meredith eventually signed for Manchester City as an amateur. He continued to work at the pit for at least a year, commuting for matches.

Meredith made his Manchester City debut in November 1894 in a 5–4 loss to Newcastle United. The following week he played his first home match for the club at Hyde Road, and scored two goals against Newton Heath – who later became Manchester United – in the first Manchester derby to take place in the league. Newton Heath won the match 5–2. He turned professional in January 1895. He ended the 1894–95 season with 12 goals in 18 appearances, just three strikes behind top-scorer Pat Finnerhan, who had played an extra 12 games.

Meredith finished as top scorer in his first full season at Manchester City. He was appointed club captain in his second season at the club, aged just 21. The club finished as Second Division runners-up in 1895–96, but were denied promotion after heavy defeats to West Bromwich Albion and Small Heath in the test matches. After the departure of strike partner Pat Finnerhan to Liverpool in March 1897, Meredith remained as City&#x27;s star player.

His new partner for the 1897–98 season was William Smith (known as &quot;Stockport Smith&quot; to differentiate him from another William Smith in the team), whilst Billie Gillespie was placed at centre-forward. Meredith provided Gillespie with many crosses into the box, picking up numerous assists as Gillespie outscored Meredith by 19 goals to 12. Meredith also mentored the slightly younger Gillespie, steering him away from drinking sessions by taking him along on fishing trips. The final match of the season saw Meredith score his first hat-trick for the club in an emphatic 9–0 win against Burton Swifts.
City dominated the Second Division in the 1898–99 season and won promotion as champions. Helping them to keep them in winning ways in the close season was late signing Jimmy Ross, a veteran forward who Meredith considered to be his &quot;favourite hero&quot;. Meredith claimed 30 goals in 34 games, including hat-tricks against Grimsby Town, Loughborough, Darwen and Barnsley.

Meredith scored City&#x27;s first goal in the First Division on the opening day of the 1899–1900 season in a 4–3 defeat to Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park on 2 September. Seven days later he claimed two goals in a 4–0 home victory over Derby County, and &quot;led the field that day&quot; by dribbling the ball almost the whole length of the pitch before launching a powerful shot that settled into the corner of Jack Fryer&#x27;s net. The &quot;Athletic News&quot; reported that &quot;for real brilliance the right-wing [Meredith and Ross] took the biscuit&quot;.

First Division defences managed to limit Meredith&#x27;s contribution in the 1900–01 campaign by singling him out for rough treatment, though Liverpool manager Tom Watson felt compelled to write a letter to Manchester City denying that a Liverpool director had stated that &quot;all that the opposition had to do was watch Meredith – the rest are no good&quot;. He finished the season with just seven goals in 35 appearances.

Meredith found the net eight times in 37 games in the 1901–02 campaign, as City were relegated back out of the First Division. The club&#x27;s secretary, Sam Ormerod, selected 29 different players as the club slumped to defeat in 13 of the opening 20 games. Ormerod was forced to step down as new business figures took control behind the scenes and began to sign promising young Scottish players. New manager Tom Maley was more willing than his predecessor to confront Meredith over his tendency to stray out of position and attempt to dominate the City attack.

City won immediate promotion as Second Division champions in 1902–03, with Meredith scoring 23 goals in 35 appearances and claiming a hat-trick against Chesterfield Town. Maley found him a suitable inside-right partner in Jimmy Bannister, who was unselfish in his play and willing to feed the ball through to Meredith. He also played Sammy Frost at half-back, who was able to win the ball and bring Meredith into the play, and signed outside-left Frank Booth to balance the attack. Maley encouraged teamwork, meaning there was less pressure on Meredith from opposition defenders.

Meredith was partnered with George Livingstone for the 1903–04 campaign, who was able to supply him and the rest of the team with quality passes. Drawn against a strong Sunderland club in the First Round of the FA Cup, Meredith was the &quot;raider-in-chief&quot; as City claimed a 3–2 victory at Hyde Road. City then defeated Woolwich Arsenal and Middlesbrough to reach the semi-finals. There they faced The Wednesday at Goodison Park, and Meredith scored one goal (bundled in by Gillespie) and claimed two assists as City won the game 3–1. Their opponents in the final at Crystal Palace were mid-table Second Division club Bolton Wanderers, and Meredith was cautiously optimistic before the match, stating &quot;We ought to win ... if we play anything like our normal game the cup is ours ... but this is the cup final and, well, anything might happen.&quot; With just over 20 minutes played, Livingstone found Meredith with a long ball, who then beat goalkeeper Dai Davies to score the only goal of the game; Bolton supporters long maintained that Meredith had been offside. As captain, Meredith was handed the trophy by Prime Minister Arthur Balfour.

He scored ten goals in 35 games in the 1904–05 season, as City came within two points and two places of champions Newcastle United. The season ended in controversial circumstances at Villa Park. With a 3–2 defeat to Aston Villa ending any hopes of winning the league, Sandy Turnbull and Villa captain Alex Leake exchanged blows. The Football Association launched an investigation into the violence, and the findings shocked the sporting world as Meredith was suspended for the entirety of the 1905–06 season for (unsuccessfully) attempting to bribe Alex Leake. No evidence was taken from Meredith, who denied the charge, and the evidence was not made public. The club, fearful of FA sanctions, refused to pay Meredith during the campaign. He was transfer listed in May 1906 after he claimed that he had only attempted to bribe Leake on the orders of manager Tom Maley and that illegal payments were common practice at Hyde Road. The FA acted on his information, and fined Manchester City £900 for illegal payments and suspended numerous players, boardroom members and staff members.

===Manchester United===

In May 1906 while serving his ban, Meredith moved to Manchester United. He joined on a free transfer and received a £500 signing-on fee from United; Manchester City reluctantly accepted the transfer as they had previously signed an undertaking promising Meredith a benefit match, and he was willing to forego the agreement if the club granted his transfer. He returned from suspension on 1 January 1907 and marked his debut at Bank Street with an assist for Sandy Turnbull to score the only goal of the game against Aston Villa. In addition to Turnbull, Meredith was joined at United by former City teammates Jimmy Bannister and Herbert Burgess. This new forward line made the team into a powerful force, as they already possessed a dominant half-back line in captain Charlie Roberts, Dick Duckworth and Alex Bell. They ended the 1906–07 season in eighth place in the First Division.

Manager Ernest Mangnall signed Jimmy Turnbull, and the forward line of Meredith, Bannister, Jimmy Turnbull and Sandy Turnbull were dominant in the 1907–08 campaign. United won the title with a nine-point margin over second-placed Aston Villa, and secured the 1908 FA Charity Shield (the first ever Charity Shield) with a 4–0 win over Queens Park Rangers at Stamford Bridge.

United slipped to a disappointing 13th-place finish in 1908–09. Meredith was suspended for January in punishment for kicking a Brighton &amp; Hove Albion player in an FA Cup match. The club reached the 1909 FA Cup final, knocking out Brighton, Everton, Blackburn Rovers, Burnley and Newcastle United. Their cup final opponents at Crystal Palace were Bristol City, captained at centre-half by Billy Wedlock – England captain and staunch opponent of the Players&#x27; Union. A Sandy Turnbull goal settled the tie, which was described as quite a boring game; Meredith himself dismissed reports of the match, stating &quot;it was a good game for dashing, keen, thrilling football, great goalkeeping and narrow escapes at either end&quot;. Meredith and his teammates celebrated the victory with music hall stars such as George Robey.

United finished fifth in 1909–10 and exited the FA Cup in the First Round with a defeat to Burnley at Turf Moor. However, the club continued to advance under the generous chairmanship of John Henry Davies, and Old Trafford was opened in February 1910.

Harold Halse was to partner Meredith at inside-right for the 1910–11 season but proved too much of a &quot;free-spirit&quot; and was replaced by Jack Picken, a &quot;plodder [who] understands what Meredith requires&quot;. A defeat at Villa Park in the penultimate game of the season left United needing to beat third-place Sunderland and hope that Aston Villa failed to beat Liverpool. United were a goal down when Meredith provided Enoch West with a cross which West sent into the net for the equalising goal. Four more goals came and they won the game 5–1 and left the field as champions of England for the second time.

Meredith played in the 1911 FA Charity Shield, as United beat Swindon Town 8–4 at Stamford Bridge. However, the 1911–12 campaign ended in a disappointing 13th-place finish, and Mangnall left the club to manage rivals Manchester City. Meredith&#x27;s Benefit match was played on 7 September 1912 between Manchester United and Manchester City, and the Welsh FA also donated the proceeds of two trial matches to the fund. There were 39,911 spectators and a total of £1,400 was raised.

New manager John Bentley led United to a fourth-place finish in 1912–13. He dropped Meredith to blood a young Jackie Sheldon. By this time, Meredith made headlines primarily due to his squabbling with the club over them stalling payment of his benefit matches and his dissatisfaction at being dropped. The club dropped to 14th spot in 1913–14 and only avoided relegation on the last day of the 1914–15 season after bribing Liverpool to lose 2–0 at Old Trafford; Meredith this time played no part in the resulting bribery scandal. He claimed to be baffled as to why his teammates refused to pass him during the game.

During the First World War, he played a match against United, making a guest appearance for Port Vale, with Vale recording a 5–2 victory at the Old Recreation Ground. Frustrated with the club for delaying payments over his benefit match, he also played as a guest for Manchester City. After the war ended, he demanded a free transfer and was repulsed that the club demanded a transfer fee, stating that the transfer market was a &quot;degrading business&quot; for players. On 26 April 1920, in a league match against Notts County, Meredith became the club&#x27;s top appearance maker, overtaking George Wall with 320 caps to his name. On 7 May 1921, at 46 years, 281 days, he became United&#x27;s oldest ever player when he took to the field in a league game against Derby County. His total of 335 appearances was Manchester United&#x27;s record until 27 August 1928, when Joe Spence made 336th of his 510 appearances for the club.

===Return to Manchester City===
In 1921 he returned to Manchester City on a free transfer. He played 25 first-team games in the 1921–22 season, helping City to record a derby victory over rivals Manchester United. He featured once in the 1922–23 campaign, playing the club&#x27;s final game at Hyde Road. He played four FA Cup and two First Division games in the 1923–24 season. Mangnall, now his manager at City, shocked Manchester when he selected Meredith for the cup game with Brighton &amp; Hove Albion at the Goldstone Ground, but was vindicated with a 5–1 victory; Meredith also scored a goal, though this was due to a poor mistake from the Brighton goalkeeper. He played both games against Cardiff City in the next round, a 0–0 draw at Maine Road and 1–0 win at Ninian Park, and claimed an assist in the goal that settled the tie. His last match was against Newcastle United in the semi-finals at the age of 49 years and 245 days, making him City&#x27;s oldest ever player; the game ended in a 2–1 defeat.

==International career==

Meredith won his first cap for Wales in a 2–2 draw with Ireland on 16 March 1895 in Belfast. He won 12 caps in the 1890s. Still, he was forced to miss six games as his club would not let him play in games that clashed with league fixtures. Wales could compete with Ireland but were regularly beaten by Scotland and England. On 26 March 1900, Wales played for the first time in South Wales, at Cardiff Arms Park, and Meredith scored a goal to earn the Welsh a celebrated 1–1 draw with England. After serving his suspension, he returned to Wales for the British Home Championship title victory in 1907, the nation&#x27;s first success in the competition. In those three games, he scored against Ireland in a 3–2 victory and captained Wales to a 1–0 win over Scotland and a 1–1 draw with England. Wales were denied a late penalty against the English, and Meredith was later recorded to have said, &quot;Never mind, little Wales will win some day [against England]. May I be there at the death.&quot;

After draws with Ireland and Scotland, Meredith &quot;wept unashamedly&quot; as he helped Wales to beat England 2–1 at Highbury to claim the 1920 British Home Championship. It was only his second victory against the English in 20 attempts, marking the last of his 48 caps. Though his record number of caps was later surpassed, at 45 years and 229 days, he remains the oldest player to win a Wales cap and an international call from any national team ever. He was actually chosen by the selectors for 71 consecutive matches, but only made 48 appearances as his clubs regularly refused to release him for international duty.

==Style of play==
Meredith was able to avoid injury throughout his career despite the extremely physical nature of the game during the period. This was due in part to his extraordinary balance and agility, which allowed him to avoid clumsy challenges, and the toughness he had built up from spending his adolescence working in the mines. A model professional, he spent his spare time improving his game with extra training sessions and maintained peak physical fitness by avoiding alcohol and tobacco. His &quot;gimmick&quot; was to chew on a toothpick during matches, and this unusual trait was picked up on by cartoonists of the time.

Writing a 1947 critique of Stanley Matthews, Meredith criticised the lack of direct play on show in the 1940s and stated that when he was playing, &quot;I knew what was expected of me – to beat the wing-half and the full-back, take the ball down to the corner flag and centre&quot;. His ball control skills were unparalleled, leaving opposition players unable to tackle him. He also was an extremely accurate passer and crosser of the ball. His dribbling and crossing gave him a large advantage over rival wingers, who relied solely on speed to beat opposition full-backs. In addition to wing-play, he was also highly skilled at sending in long-range shots across the face of the goal, and could be relied upon to meet crosses from his left-winger with a powerful volley.

Meredith had to deal with extremely physical defences and was often boxed into the corner of the pitch by as many as four players. As his talents became widely regarded, more well-organised defences would designate him with a man-marker, to try and isolate him from his teammates. This often left him reliant on an unselfish inside-right partner willing to fetch and carry the ball for him without expecting much goals or glory in return. A hard-working wing-half would also improve Meredith&#x27;s effectiveness by winning the ball and sending him a pass down the flank. The best teams he played in also had a centre-forward able to make the most of his accurate crosses.

==Players&#x27; Union==

Meredith organised the first meeting of the Players&#x27; Union (PU) in December 1907. Meredith had previously been involved with the Association Footballers&#x27; Union (the &quot;AFU&quot;), the first attempt by football players in England to organise a trade union. Like the AFU before it, the Players&#x27; Union sought the relaxation of restrictions on transfers and wages. Others made the argument that a free market wage structure would ruin the amateur principles the sport was founded on, but Meredith felt that these words rang hollow considering that club directors and shareholders made vast profits. At the first annual meeting in December 1908, the PU stated their aims as to allow unlimited wages, the right to transfer from club to club, and for players to take a percentage of any transfer fee.

With the union threatening strike action, particularly at international matches, in April 1909, the Football Association insisted that all players agree to leave the union and pledge loyalty to the FA. Manchester United refused to issue the revised contracts to its players, and the FA suspended the entire squad. The club then refused to pay the players in lieu of their suspension, and so the players instead took away ornaments from the club&#x27;s office before Mangnall persuaded them to return the items. The players continued to train, and captain Charlie Roberts came up with the name of Outcasts F.C. The FA organised a meeting of 200 players, excluding the Outcasts, but a rambling speech from chairman Charles Clegg failed to win them over, and an agreement was reached where the PU would be recognised by the FA.

In October 1909, the Union balloted its members over the organisation&#x27;s membership of the General Federation of Trade Unions (GTFU). The result of the vote, a decisive &quot;no&quot; to GFTU support, effectively supported the FA&#x27;s position that professional footballers were fundamentally different from workmen in other industries. Meredith resumed league football in November 1909, bemoaning his view that &quot;many players refuse to take things seriously and continue to live a kind of schoolboy life&quot;.

==Personal life and legacy==

He married Ellen Negus in 1901, and the couple had two daughters. He was a supporter of the Liberal Party. He ran businesses throughout his career, with little success, and was declared bankrupt in July 1909 after his clubting shop was damaged by fire. During the 1910s he ran a public house (despite being a teetotaller). He later pursued an interest in the film industry by buying shares in numerous Stretford cinemas in the 1930s. He also starred in the 1926 picture &quot;The Ball of Fortune&quot;, playing himself as a football trainer; the film received generally positive reviews. In 1928, together with former colleague Charlie Roberts, he became a coach for the ambitious but short-lived Manchester Central. Meredith&#x27;s son-in-law, former City captain Charlie Pringle, was a player. He retained a passion for football and spent much of his retirement discussing the game with former colleagues and regulars at his hotel, the Stretford Road Hotel, which he ran from 1930 to 1945. He rarely missed the chance to attend a Wales game in the 1920s and 1930s.

Meredith died in Withington, Manchester in April 1958 at the age of 83, and was buried in Southern Cemetery, Manchester. After he spent many years in an unmarked grave, the Professional Footballers&#x27; Association, the Welsh FA, Manchester City and Manchester United all agreed to cover the cost of upkeep on a new headstone. Meredith is honoured in the hall of fame at the City of Manchester Stadium. It was announced in August 2007 that Meredith was one of the ten new inductees for 2007 to the English Football Hall of Fame. There is a street in Manchester named Billy Meredith Close in his honour and there are a pair of plaques dedicated to Meredith in his home village of Chirk (&quot;Cymraeg&quot;: Y Waun): one at Chirk AAA FC&#x27;s home ground; the other in Millennium Gardens at the Station Avenue entrance to the park and cricket ground. The latter was unveiled in 2002 by Billy&#x27;s daughter Winifrede.

<text>The Great Egg Harbor River is a river in South Jersey. It is one of the major rivers that traverse the largely pristine Pinelands, draining of wetlands into the Atlantic Ocean at Great Egg Harbor, from which it takes its name.

Great Egg Harbor (and thus the river) got its name from Dutch explorer Cornelius Jacobsen May. In 1614, Mey came upon the inlet to the Great Egg Harbor River. The meadows were so covered with shorebird and waterfowl eggs that he called it &quot;Eyren Haven&quot; (Egg Harbor). Today, the National Park Service considers it one of the top 10 places in North America for birding.

==Description==

The Great Egg Harbor River rises in the suburbs southeast of Camden near Berlin and flows generally southeast, to the south of the Atlantic City Expressway, entering Great Egg Harbor approximately southwest of Atlantic City. The lower of the river provide a navigable estuary as far as Mays Landing. The Tuckahoe River enters Great Egg Harbor just to the south of the mouth of the river.

Before the arrival of Europeans to the area in the 18th century, it was inhabited by Lenape. During the American Revolutionary War, its estuary sheltered privateers. The presence of &quot;bog iron&quot; along the river provided material for cannonballs and led to the construction of blast furnaces, as well as glass and brick factories, until the middle of the 19th century.

In 1992, the United States Congress designated of the river and its tributaries as the Great Egg Harbor Scenic and Recreational River, as part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. It is the longest canoeing river within the Pinelands. It can be paddled for from New Brooklyn, near Route 536, all the way to Beesley&#x27;s Point. The river is noted for its tea-colored &quot;cedar water&quot;, the product of the iron and tannin content of the fallen cedar leaves along much of its length. It provides abundant habitat for waterfowl in the region. The fish populations include striped bass and alewife herring.

As of July 2015, of land along the river in Atlantic County is owned and administered by the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife as the Great Egg Harbor River Wildlife Management Area.

<doc id="668216" wikidata="Q3526823" url="?curid=668216" title="Warden's Five Rings">
<text>Warden&#x27;s Five Rings represent a theory of military strategic attack, based on five levels of system attributes. They are named in honor of Col. John A. Warden III, a former United States Air Force officer and theorist of air power.

The Five Rings include:
* Leadership
* Organic/System Essentials/Key Production
* Infrastructure
* Population
* Fielded Military Forces

Each level of system or &quot;ring&quot; was considered one of the enemy&#x27;s centers of gravity. The idea behind Warden&#x27;s five rings was to attack each of the rings to paralyze their forces, an objective also known as &quot;physical paralysis&quot;. To optimize a strike attack the attacker would engage as many rings as possible with special emphasis on taking out the center ring, which is the enemy&#x27;s leadership. This would result in total physical paralysis.

Warden&#x27;s theories on the application of air power in modern war have been criticized as little more than a reiteration of earlier strategic bombing concepts discredited by historical analysis of the Second World War and the Vietnam War, similar to the effect on the writings of Giulio Douhet. Warden differs from Douhet in assigning leadership the highest priority, where Douhet espoused attacking the morale of populations. This made Warden&#x27;s theory more applicable for attacking developing and weaker regimes, while Douhet&#x27;s theories were based on stronger nations engaged in large conventional wars as was the concern in interwar Europe. Dismissal of the theories has led some to mistakenly conclude that the theories have no application, thereby missing the application of air power as a modern means of accomplishing the Strategic Indirect of Sir B. H. Liddell Hart.

<doc id="668242" wikidata="Q464636" url="?curid=668242" title="Augusta Holmès">
<text>Augusta Mary Anne Holmès (16 December 1847 – 28 January 1903) was a French composer of Irish descent. In 1871, Holmès became a French national and added the accent to her last name. She wrote the texts to almost all of her vocal music herself, including songs, oratorios, the libretto of her opera &quot;La Montagne noire&quot; and the programmatic poems for her symphonic poems including &quot;Irlande&quot; and &quot;Andromède&quot;.

==Biography==
Holmès was born in Paris, the only child of Charles William Scott Dalkeith Holmes (17 July 1797 - 19 December 1869), originally from Youghal, Ireland, and Tryphina Anna Constance Augusta Shearer (1811–1858). The poet Alfred de Vigny, who was her godfather, was rumored to be her natural father.

Despite showing talent at the piano, she was not allowed to study at the Paris Conservatoire, but took lessons privately. She developed her piano playing under the tutelage of local pianist Mademoiselle Peyronnet, the organist of Versailles Cathedral Henri Lambert, and Hyacinthe Klosé. Also, she showed some of her earlier compositions to Franz Liszt. Around 1876, she became a pupil of César Franck, whom she considered her real master. She led the group of Franck&#x27;s students who in 1891 commissioned for Franck&#x27;s tomb a bronze medallion from Auguste Rodin.

Camille Saint-Saëns wrote of Holmès in the journal &quot;Harmonie et Mélodie&quot;: &quot;Like children, women have no idea of obstacles, and their willpower breaks all barriers. Mademoiselle Holmès is a woman, an extremist.&quot; Like other female composers from the nineteenth century including Fanny Mendelssohn and Clara Schumann, Holmès published some of her earlier works under a male pseudonym (&quot;Hermann Zenta&quot;) because women in European society at that time were not taken seriously as artists and were discouraged from publishing.

For the 1889 celebration of the centennial of the French Revolution, Holmès was commissioned to write the &quot;Ode triomphale&quot; for the Exposition Universelle, a work requiring about 1,200 musicians. She gained a reputation of being a composer of programme music with political meaning, such as her symphonic poems &quot;Irlande&quot; and &quot;Pologne&quot;.

==Musical style==
Holmès&#x27; oeuvre is made up of cantatas, symphonic poems, operas, a few works for solo piano and over 100 songs.

First hearing Wagner&#x27;s work at the age of 13, Holmès was influenced by Wagner all her life and advocated to have his works performed in the Concerts Populaires, a formidable concert series in Paris. Many parallels can be found in the music of Holmès and Wagner. One of the most direct examples of stylistic likeness can be heard in Wagner&#x27;s Ride of the Valkyries from &quot;Die Walküre&quot; (1856) and Holmès&#x27; &quot;Roland furieux&quot; (1876). Both works make use of chromaticism and use similar orchestral colour, with dominant brass sections, announcing strong, rhythmically catching, melodic motives, while the strings drive the music forward with rapid, galloping patterns underneath the melody.

Holmès wrote four operas, largely inspired by Wagner, however, &quot;La Montagne Noire&quot;, staged in 1895, was the only one to be performed. It was one of the few operas written by a woman to be produced at the Paris Opéra in the nineteenth century, but it was poorly received, possibly due to its outdated Wagnerian influences.

The gender rhetoric of the nineteenth century, which prescribed that female composers should limit themselves to smaller, feminine genres, had an impact on the reception towards the music of Holmès. Although praised for her creative gifts, she, like many other female composers of her time, was criticised for crossing the boundary into styles which were thought of as masculine territory. Saint-Saëns, in a review of Holmès&#x27; symphonic poem, &quot;Les Argonautes&quot;, remarked on her &quot;excessive virility – a frequent fault with women composers – and flamboyant orchestration in which the brass explodes like fireworks...&quot;

==Personal life==

Holmès never married, but she cohabited with the poet Catulle Mendès; the couple had five children, including:
* Huguette Mendès (1871–1964)
* Claudine Mendès (1876–1937)
* Helyonne Mendès (1879–1955)
Holmès bequeathed most of her musical manuscripts to the Paris Conservatoire.

<text>Jökulsárgljúfur National Park () is a former national park situated in the north of Iceland around the river Jökulsá á Fjöllum. It lies to the north of the Dettifoss waterfall. On 7 June 2008, it became a part of the larger Vatnajökull National Park.

==Geography==

The area is of interest because of its chaotic canyon and volcanic mountains. Eight thousand years ago, volcanic fissures of the Askja volcanic system erupted directly underneath the river and glacial ice. This caused explosions and chaotic flooding.

The center of the park was Vesturdalur with &quot;Hljóðaklettar&quot; (rock of echoes). &quot;Rauðhólar&quot; (red mountain) is of interest because of its special colouring due to iron oxidations. Another sight is the canyon of Ásbyrgi to the north of the park which is formed like a horseshoe.

<doc id="668261" wikidata="Q727773" url="?curid=668261" title="39/Smooth">
<text>39/Smooth is the debut studio album by the American rock band Green Day, released on April 13, 1990, by Lookout Records. After finalizing their line-up, the band played frequent shows at the 924 Gilman Street venue, where they started attracting a following and eventually caught the attention of Lookout Records&#x27; founder Larry Livermore. Following the release of their debut EP &quot;1,000 Hours&quot; (1989) and stints in other bands, Green Day went to Art of Ears Studio, located in San Francisco, California, to record their debut studio album, which was co-produced with Andy Ernst. Sessions started at late December 1989 and ended in January 1990, costing $675. &quot;39/Smooth&quot; has been tagged as punk rock, pop-punk and skate punk, with comparisons made to the work of older punk bands the Buzzcocks and the Ramones, as well to contemporaries Crimpshrine and the Lookouts. Written mostly by frontman and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, unrequited love and longing for desire served as the main lyrical topics, while reminiscing on youth appeared in two of the songs.

&quot;39/Smooth&quot; was met with acclaim within Green Day&#x27;s contemporary community; retrospective reviews praised the songwriting and individual musicianship of each of the band members, while some critics were more negative of the album. In the lead up to the album&#x27;s release, Armstrong dropped out of high school, and the members took up odd jobs while bassist Mike Dirnt and drummer John Kiffmeyer continued their education. To promote &quot;39/Smooth&quot;, the band embarked on a 45-date tour of the United States, which began in June 1990. By its end, Kiffmeyer opted to enroll in college and did not tell the other members, with Armstrong learning of it through a friend.

The album, plus related EPs from the time, were included on the &quot;1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours&quot; (1991) compilation album, which is often erroneously referred to as the band&#x27;s debut. By 1994, &quot;39/Smooth&quot; had sold 75,000 copies, and in the following year, peaked at number five on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Pop Catalog Albums chart. Publications have ranked the album towards the lower end of the band&#x27;s discography, such as number 10 by &quot;Kerrang!&quot; and &quot;Paste&quot; and number 11 by &quot;Spin&quot;.

==Background and recording==

Following a shared interest in music, and the creation of original material, guitarists Billie Joe Armstrong and Mike Dirnt formed a band. After going through another name, they stuck with Sweet Children; Armstrong and Dirnt worked security at punk club 924 Gilman Street in Berkeley, California. John Kiffmeyer, also known as &quot;Al Sobrante&quot;, drummer of Gilman performers Isocracy, was invited to play with them. He helped refine Sweet Children&#x27;s sound, and taught them a work ethic of recording music as cheaply and quickly as possible. Sweet Children played their first Gilman show in November 1988, where they accumulated a fan base; after the departure of bassist Sean Hughes, Dirnt moved to bass. During a house party, Sweet Children were brought to the attention of Larry Livermore, who operated Lookout Records, which was originally planned to only release material from Livermore&#x27;s band the Lookouts.

Livermore subsequently signed Sweet Children following a show with the Lookouts. The record deal made the members of Sweet Children realize that they needed a new name, ultimately choosing Green Day. They played their last show under the old moniker on April 1, 1989, at Gilman for a benefit show. That same month, the &quot;1,000 Hours&quot; EP was released through on seven-inch vinyl. Livermore commented that due to the poppy nature of the release that it would be difficult to sell to record buyers, taking around six months for the EP to start attracting attention from the public. Author Ben Myers wrote in &quot;Green Day: American Idiots &amp; The New Punk Explosion&quot; (2006) that while it did not have a unique musical direction amongst the band&#x27;s peers, the EP helped to place Green Day as well as Berkeley &quot;on the map.&quot; They performed for the first time since the name change supporting Operation Ivy on May 28, 1989, at Gilman. During this time, Armstrong and Dirnt played in other bands, such as Blatz, Corrupted Morals and Crummy Musicians.
Green Day recorded their debut album at Art of Ears Studio in San Francisco, California, around Christmas 1989 when recording time was inexpensive. Andy Ernst, who previously worked on the &quot;1,000 Hours&quot; EP, co-produced the sessions with members of the band. Sessions started on December 29, 1989; Armstrong and Dirnt tracked their vocals at the same time in order to save on both money and time. Myers noted that the members&#x27; influences, such as the Buzzcocks, the Clash and the Ramones, &quot;all of whom recorded quickly, and it clearly showed as they applied the same sense of pared-down economy to their own blistering debut.&quot; The majority of the album was finished the following day, preceded by guitar parts and vocal harmonies. The album was mixed and completed by January 2, 1990. The sessions cost $675 (), charged to Livermore. John Golden mastered the recordings at K Disc Mastering in Hollywood, California Prior to the album coming out, Livermore wanted to issue another single to build hype. Subsequently, the band went back to Art of Ears and recorded four songs in a few hours, which became the &quot;Slappy&quot; (1990) EP.

==Composition==
The main lyrical theme of &quot;39/Smooth&quot; revolves around unrequited love and longing for desire, which appeared in &quot;At the Library with Waba Sé Wasca&quot;, &quot;Disappearing Boy&quot; and &quot;The Judge&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. While &quot;I Was There&quot; and &quot;16&quot; are about reminiscing on youth, which Gaar suggested that these were interesting declarations from the band as the members themselves were still young. Musically, &quot;39/Smooth&quot; has been tagged as punk rock, pop-punk, skate punk, and power pop. Myers said the songs merged the band members&#x27; overt adoration of pop hooks by British acts from the 1960s, topped by the &quot;regionalized intonation of British punk&#x27;s strongest voices.&quot; He also highlighted the sound of the Buzzcocks and Hüsker Dü as points of comparison, while &quot;Stereogum&quot; Jay Papandreas drew comparison to labelmates Crimpshrine and the Lookouts, and Eduardo Rivadavia, writing for Discogs, said its three-chord tracks were indebted to the work of the Ramones.
With album opener &quot;At the Library with Waba Sé Wasca&quot;, Allyson Johnson of The Young Folks said the band presented the Southern Californian sound that managed to &quot;both fit them in the scene while allowing them to stand out ...&quot; She added that it displayed the formula for which they would continue to use throughout their career: &quot;The gritty and buzzsaw sounding guitars only make for a more immediate, satisfying star.&quot; Armstrong said &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me&quot; was about an occasion in the seventh grade where a girl had broken up with him. &quot;I Was There&quot; has lyrics written by Kiffmeyer; Gaar said it was a broad retrospective view of &quot;one&#x27;s past — torn between wanting it to last, but ultimately choosing to look ahead toward tomorrow.&quot; Jack Holly of The Young Folks said Armstrong can be heard recounting locations him and his bandmates had visited and individuals they have encountered in their brief run as a band. &quot;Green Day&quot;, which starts with the sound of a bong hit, discusses being inebriated while dreaming about a girl and staring directing at the ceiling. On &quot;Going to Pasalacqua&quot;, Holly wrote that Armstrong was adamant about trying to get the attention of girl that he would visit a funeral home, Pasalacqua, located in Benicia, California, to achieve this. Johnson spotlighted &quot;16&quot; as a highlight, touching on the song&#x27;s sense of heightened youthfulness, and noted that it was more restrained compared to the rest of the tracks. &quot;Road to Acceptance&quot;, which was influenced by racism, talks about a person who lambasts their own reputation as an outsider. Preceded by the slower song &quot;Rest&quot;, &quot;The Judge&#x27;s Daughter&quot; concluded &quot;39/Smooth&quot;; Armstrong said it was about a girl from Pinole Valley High School.

==Release==
===Promotion and packaging===
In February 1990, Armstrong dropped out of high school shortly prior to the release of their debut album, in order to focus exclusively on Green Day. Around this time, as Dirnt and Kiffmeyer focused on working and education, a tour for the band spanning 45 dates across the US was scheduled. To raise money for the trek, the members took up odd jobs. Lookout Records released &quot;39/Smooth&quot; on April 13, 1990, issued on the vinyl and cassette formats. It was released around the time of albums by the likes of their contemporaries Bad Religion, NOFX, the Offspring and Pennywise, all of whom were frequently playing shows, though were ignored by major publications and record labels. Attitudes towards alternative music were slowly shifting, as Myers remarked, &quot;but not &quot;that&quot; quickly. Green Day and the punks&#x27; true time was yet to come, and for now they existed in a vacuum unaffected by traditional rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll conceits. ... [&quot;39/Smooth&quot;] was released and life carried on.&quot; As Lookout Records did not have enough funds for promotion, word of mouth about &quot;39/Smooth&quot; spread from the small amount of reviews it earned in zines.

When the members of Green Day were wrapping up the production of the album, the word &quot;smooth&quot; was in frequent rotation, and they wanted to use it in the title. It was during this time that Alen, Armstrong&#x27;s oldest sibling, had turned 39, which they jokingly wanted to use it in the name as well as they were unsure if they would get the chance to make another album. The album was eventually titled &quot;39/Smooth&quot;. The cover of &quot;39/Smooth&quot;, which was designed by Jesse Michaels of Operation Ivy, depicts a black-and-white image of a woman in a cemetery. Michael Roffman of &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; said the cover was &quot;a little eerie&quot; which he attributed to the shining tree branches seen in the image. Out of all of the band&#x27;s albums, Myers remarked that its monochrome and somber nature made it stand out as the &quot;least Green Day-&quot;looking&quot;&quot; cover. Aaron Cometbus, editor of the &quot;Cometbus&quot; zine, created some additional artwork for the sleeve; Myers said his &quot;recognizable pen-and-ink style came to define the band&#x27;s early works and nicely complemented the content within.&quot; The back of the sleeve featured three photographs, shot by Murray Bowles, of Green Day performing at Gilman. Accompanying the images were cartoon illustrations, done by Michaels, which included keys, safety pins, a matchbox and faces of monsters. A martini glass can also be seen, which Gaar said was a comment on the no-alcohol policy enforced at Gilman. The lyric sheet included in the sleeve included an alleged letter from major label I.R.S. Records, who claimed to have an interest in the band, saying they were best act from the Bay Area since the emergence of the Dead Kennedys. In addition to this was two response letters, one from Kiffmeyer and other from Livermore; Gaar said the I.R.S. letter was forged as the result of Kiffmeyer having located some stationery belonging to the label from a trash receptacle. Around two years after the album&#x27;s release, Livermore received threatening letters from I.R.S. for the incident, and apologized to them.

===US tour and related events===

To assist the release of &quot;39/Smooth&quot;, Green Day appeared at several Gilman gigs, some that served as benefit shows for Lookout or fanzines in the area, namely &quot;Cometbus&quot;. One show also included a May 1990 performance at Pinole Valley High School, who were hosting local acts for Foreign Food Day. The day after Dirnt graduated from that high school, the band embarked on the aforementioned 45-date US tour. They used a van that was bought from Armstrong&#x27;s brother, and was refurbished as to have more space to sleep and store their equipment. They were accompanied by Hughes, who served as their roadie. It started on June 19, 1990, on the West Coast, going up to Canada, before returning to the US, from where they journeyed to the East Coast, travelling to Florida, moving to the Midwest and ending in California.

They played in a variety of punk clubs, house parties and bars, with crowd sizes varying from 50 people to 500. Venues that scheduled the band received contracts from them with two requests – that nourishment and accommodation was prioritized over money, and did ask for a minimum of $100 if there was enough to spare, though stipulated this was not a requirement. The band stated on the contracts the places &quot;do not have to give us any of these things, of course we don&#x27;t have to tune before we play either.&quot; Funds that Green Day made from the performances ended up going to paying for food and buying gas. To aid their income, they bought inexpensive shirts from local business, which were then printed with their band logo and promptly put on sale at the gigs. They also gave a discount to attendees to bring their own shirts to the shows for printing.

Though the tour was seen as a success by the band, Kiffmeyer did not want to go through the hassle of such an endeavor again and instead enrolled in Humboldt State College in Arcata, California later in the year. He did not outright tell them that he was departing. Armstrong was surprised by this as he only found out through Cometbus. Afterwards, Armstrong was unsure if he wanted to continue the band. Dave EC of Filth and the Wynona Riders joined Green Day, though left after a few weeks. Armstrong remembered Tré Cool and learned that he was free. Cool had been playing with the Lookouts since he was 12. At age 16, Cool was a regular of the Gilman scene, going to parties and playing with various acts. Through this, he became familiar with Armstrong and Dirnt. Cool ultimately joined Green Day in late 1990.

The later CD release of &quot;39/Smooth&quot; featured tracks from the two prior EPs, in addition to I Want to Be Alone, which was previously released on a &quot;Flipside&quot; magazine various artist compilation in 1990. This version was retitled &quot;1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours&quot;, which omitted the letters from Kiffmeyer, Livermore and I.R.S., and included the &quot;1,000 Hours&quot; and &quot;Slappy&quot; EPs. In late 2005, citing a royalty dispute, the band took control of their Lookout Records-era releases, including &quot;1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours&quot;, second studio album &quot;Kerplunk&quot; (1991), and the &quot;1,000 Hours&quot; and &quot;Slappy&quot; EPs. &quot;Going to Pasalacqua&quot; was pressed on a seven-inch vinyl record, with &quot;Road to Acceptance&quot; and &quot;Disappearing Boy&quot; as the B-sides, as part of the &quot;Ultimate Collectors 7&quot; Vinyl Singles Box Set&quot; (2009) collection. In the lead up to the &quot;Green Day: Rock Band&quot; (2010) video game, Cool said that while the master tapes for &quot;39/Smooth&quot; still exist, the process to digitize them would destroy the tape given their age.

==Reception==

&quot;39/Smooth&quot; was met with acclaim within the local community and on a national level due to Lookout Records&#x27; outreach.

Some critics praised the songwriting found on &quot;39/Smooth&quot;. Spitz and Gaar said the writing had positively evolved from &quot;1,000 Hours&quot;, with the former praising the lyrics, and the latter impressed with the progression in such a short time frame. Myers said the band were able to mould a sonic direction &quot;bubbling with energy, melodies and lyrical themes that struck a chord.&quot; Al Shipley of &quot;Spin&quot; saw the album as a &quot;revealing listen&quot;, as it &quot;sounds shockingly close to the skate punk sound which with the band would conquer the world four years later.&quot; Louder writer Alistair Lawrence wrote that the album had the &quot;hint of something special, ... &quot;39/Smooth&quot; takes the raw ingredients that make Green Day unique and starts them simmering.&quot;

A few reviews focused on the individual aspects of the band members. Robbins and Neugebauer complimented Armstrong for his &quot;well-mannered lyrics - hopeful, uncertain, self-conscious&quot;, which &quot;manage only mild psychic discomfort ... and romantic tension rather than any rebellious insurgence.&quot; Raggett said his vocal &quot;balance of disaffection and nervous, goofy passion is well in place, while he&#x27;s already showing his effective, no-frills approach to chewy feedback melody. Reed Strength of &quot;Paste&quot; said Armstrong&#x27;s voice was the album&#x27;s biggest weakness, referring to it as &quot;ear-grating, brow-furrowing singing.&quot; Raggett remarked that Dirnt was &quot;no slouch himself, providing good backing vocals when needed for harmony ...&quot; Robbins and Neugebauer said Dirnt and Kiffmeyer push &quot;the songs along, and Billie Joe sings them earnestly, without the contrived English accent he would later affect. A very tentative start.&quot; Raggett highlighted Kiffmeyer for the &quot;most prominent performance throughout&quot; the album, while Shipley thought he was not &quot;quite a force of nature like Tre Cool, but he has similar instincts on how to keep the tempos brisk and the drum fills splashy.&quot;

Others were more negative of &quot;39/Smooth&quot;, with some only highlighting a single track. AllMusic reviewer Ned Raggett said it &quot;isn&#x27;t a truly great album in the first place. It&#x27;s not bad, by any means ... It&#x27;s just little more than a fun punk-pop album with some entertaining metallic flash here and there,&quot; akin to a multitude of albums created in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Finn White for &quot;IGN&quot; found it to be lackluster, lamenting that the tracks were dissimilar from one another, though clarified that as it shows the band at their &quot;least refined, ... therein lies its charm and primary appeal.&quot; For &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, writer Ian Winwood said upon hearing the album in the present day, it comes across as a &quot;collection rich in promise but lacking in real-time impact.&quot; Ira Robbins and Delvin Neugebauer of &quot;Trouser Press&quot; said the album was a &quot;relatively tame power-pop affair. Although plucky and brash, the music is too timid to even flirt with punk intensity levels.&quot; Papandreas said that the album was evidently the creation of a &quot;924 Gilman band&quot; that was not &quot;anything to write home about. ... The record itself is middling, disposable pop-punk until you get to &#x27;Going To Pasalacqua,&#x27; which gives the best glimpse of what Green Day had to come.&quot; Winwood, reviewing for BBC Music, also highlighted &quot;Going to Pasalacqua&quot;, Marc Hogan of &quot;PopMatters&quot; singled out &quot;I Was There&quot; as a songwriting achievement.

Prior to the release of Green Day&#x27;s major label debut, &quot;Dookie&quot; (1994), &quot;39/Smooth&quot; had sold 75,000 copies. Lookout Records&#x27; operations director Chris Appelgren said the joint efforts of &quot;39/Smooth&quot; and &quot;Kerplunk&quot; boosted sales of other albums in the label&#x27;s catalog. In 1995, &quot;39/Smooth&quot; peaked at number five on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Pop Catalog Albums chart; &quot;Kerplunk&quot; appeared in the same listing, topping the chart. Publications have ranked the album towards the lower end of the band&#x27;s discography: number six by &quot;IGN&quot; and &quot;Stereogum&quot;; number seven by Louder; number 10 by &quot;Kerrang!&quot; and &quot;Paste&quot;; and number 11 by &quot;Spin&quot;. The tribute album &quot;A Different Shade of Green: A Green Day Tribute&quot;, issued in 2003, included covers of &quot;Going to Pasalacqua&quot; and &quot;Rest&quot;. Jaret Reddick of Bowling for Soup, and Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion, expressed admiration for the album, with the latter saying that whenever bands came to his studio, they also hyped up the release.
