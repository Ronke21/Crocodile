<text>A long-range reconnaissance patrol, or LRRP, is a small, well-armed reconnaissance team that patrols deep into enemy-held territory.

The concept of scouts dates back to the origins of warfare itself. However, in modern times these specialized units evolved from examples such as Rogers&#x27; Rangers in colonial British America, the Lovat Scouts in World War One, the Long Range Desert Group and the Special Air Service in the Western Desert Campaign and North West Europe, similar units such as Force 136 in East Asia, and the special Finnish light infantry units during the Second World War.

Postwar, the role was carried in various North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and British Commonwealth countries by units that could trace their origins to these wartime creations such as the British SAS, Australia&#x27;s Special Air Service Regiment and the New Zealand Special Air Service, 1er RPIMa, 13e RDP, GCP, Groupement de Commandos Mixtes Aéroportés in France and the United States Army Rangers, Long Range Surveillance teams, and the dismounted reconnaissance troops of RSTA squadrons.

==History==
As indicated, the use of scouts is ancient, however, during the French and Indian War (1754–1763), the techniques of long-range reconnaissance and raiding were significantly implemented by the British in colonial North America. The British employed Major Robert Rogers to make long-range attacks against the French and their Indian allies along the frontiers of the British colonies and New France. The achievements of Major Roberts&#x27;s dozen companies of approximately 1,200 men during the French and Indian War were so extraordinary that his doctrine, &quot;Standing Orders, Rogers&#x27; Rangers,&quot; 1759, became the cornerstone of future U.S. Army long-range reconnaissance patrol units.

==Long-range reconnaissance patrol by nation==

===Australia===

During the Second World War, the 2/1st North Australia Observer Unit was tasked with patrolling the remote areas of northern Australia on horseback. Many from the Unit were recruited to join M Special Unit and Z Special Unit for long-range specialist reconnaissance and sabotage behind Japanese lines.

From 1966 until 1971 troopers from the Australian Special Air Service Regiment (SASR) served in Vietnam as part of the 1st Australian Task Force at Nui Dat, Phuoc Tuy Province. Missions included medium range reconnaissance patrols, observation of enemy troop movements, and long range offensive operations and ambushing in enemy dominated territory in support of 1ATF operations throughout Phuoc Tuy Province as well as Bien Hoa, Long Khanh and Binh Tuy provinces.

In the 1980s the Regional Force Surveillance Units (NORFORCE, The Pilbara Regiment and 51st Battalion, Far North Queensland Regiment) were formed to conduct long-range reconnaissance and surveillance patrols in the sparsely populated and remote regions of northern Australia.

===Canada===
The Canadian Rangers conduct long-range surveillance or sovereignty patrols in the sparsely settled areas of Northern Canada. Although part of the Canadian Army, they are an irregular military force.
Patrol Pathfinders units form part of the Reconnaissance Platoon of the 3rd (Light Infantry) Battalion of each Regular Force infantry Regiment. Patrol Pathfinders are trained in airborne and amphibious insertion, including by submarine, and conduct deep reconnaissance missions

===Denmark===
The Danish Defence Forces had three Long-Range Surveillance companies (LRSC) known as &quot;Patrol-Companies&quot; (PTLCOY): two assigned to the two Land Commands: LANDJUT and LANDZEALAND (Corps-level) (abbreviated &quot;SEP/ELK&quot; and &quot;SEP/VLK&quot; for: &quot;Specielle Efterretningspatruljer/Østre resp. Vestre Landskommando&quot; i.e. Special Intelligence Patrols) – two all-volunteer units within the Danish Home Guard - that was changed into the Special Support and Reconnaissance Company (SSR) in 2007 as a Special Reconnaissance (SR) Company dedicated to supporting the Danish Special Operations. 
The third and last company (PTLCOY/DDIV) was assigned to the Jutland Division (later Danish Division/DDIV) and was trained by instructors from the Danish Army Special Operations Forces: &quot;Jægerkorpset&quot; (i.e. Hunter Force) in Aalborg. PTLCOY/DDIV was disbanded in 2002 due to budget-cuts and the intent to implement UAV in the Danish Army as the primary means of ISR. The first UAV project later failed and was disbanded too.

In addition to these units, the 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion, Guard Hussar Regiment, also has Long range reconnaissance capabilities, particularly in 1st and 2nd Light Reconnaissance Squadrons (1.LOPESK &amp; 2.LOPESK), whose primary role is long range reconnaissance and sabotage in light vehicles and with minimal support and resupply.

Likely to be the world&#x27;s smallest LRS unit is the Sirius Dog Sled Patrol (Danish: &quot;Slædepatruljen Sirius&quot;), known informally as &quot;Siriuspatruljen&quot; (the Sirius Patrol). It is a small squad-sized elite unit in the Danish Navy, that enforces Danish sovereignty in the Arctic wilderness of northern and eastern Greenland, and conducts long-range reconnaissance patrolling. Patrolling is usually done in pairs, sometimes for four months and often without additional human contact.

===Finland===
In Finland, long-range patrols (&quot;kaukopartio&quot;) were especially notable during World War II. For example, &quot;Erillinen Pataljoona 4&quot; (4th Detached Battalion), a command of four different long-range patrol detachments; Detachment Paatsalo, Detachment Kuismanen, Detachment Vehniäinen and Detachment Marttina, operated in the Finnish-Soviet theater of WWII, also known as the Continuation War, from 1941 through 1944. These units penetrated Soviet lines and conducted reconnaissance and destroy missions. During the trench warfare period of the war, long-range patrols were often conducted by special Finnish Sissi troops. After the war, NATO hired former members of the 4th Detached Battalion to spy on Soviet Union&#x27;s military bases in the Kola Peninsula and Karelian Isthmus. NATO ended the spy operation in 1957. From then on, espionage data was obtained from forward satellites.

Former President of Finland, Mauno Koivisto, served in Lauri Törni&#x27;s specially designed Jäger Company (called Detachment Törni) in the Finnish 1st Infantry Division. Lauri Törni became a US citizen and entered the US Army Special Forces. He gave important knowledge in long-range patrolling techniques and was declared MIA during the Vietnam War in 1965. His remains were later found, brought to the US, and buried in Arlington on 26 June 2003.

===France===
French Army has 2 units specialised in reconnaissance : 13th Parachute Dragoon Regiment and 2nd Hussar Regiment

Other French units can perform long-range reconnaissance but are not specialised in it: 1er RPIMa, Commandos Marine, GCP and GCM, dedicated companies in cavalry regiments...

===Germany===
In the German &quot;Bundeswehr&quot;, LRRP is called &quot;Fernspäher&quot; (long-range scouts). Historically, the German Fernspäher units were modelled after the Finnish long-range patrols and derived from the existing elite units of &quot;Gebirgsjäger&quot; (mountain troops) and &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; (airborne troops). Originally, there were three companies of Fernspäher in the Bundeswehr, one being assigned to each corps. Since the reformation of German Special Forces in 1996, the Fernspählehrkompanie 200 (FSLK200) is the single remaining Fernspäher unit. The Fernspähers are part of the Special Operations Division. FSLK200 is the only German special force-type unit which has also recruited women. Details about operations of the FSLK200 are secret but it is known that Fernspäher carried out missions in Bosnia and Herzegovina, during the Kosovo War and later during Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan.

===India===

Special Frontier Force is considered a long-range reconnaissance patrol or pathfinder. They were trained against the Chinese but used to great success in Pakistan administered Kashmir and in the northern state of Punjab.

===Indonesia===

Kopassus and Tontaipur of the Indonesian Army are units able to conduct long-range reconnaissance patrolling including pathfinder and Special reconnaissance operations.

===Italy===
Historically, airborne units are normally tasked with carrying, apart from the ordinary airborne assaults, deep infiltration small unit reconnaissance. After World War 2, during the Cold War, the main LRRP unit was the &quot;Col Moschin&quot; Parachute Assault Company (later battalion and then regiment). Another LRRP unit specialising as artillery observers were the 13th Target Acquisition Group &quot;Aquileia&quot;, where &quot;Group&quot; is a definition of the Italian artillery indicating three batteries of guns, roughly a battalion sized unit) of the 3rd Missile Brigade &quot;Aquileia&quot;, and especially the Batteria Acquisizione Obiettivi &quot;Pipistrelli&quot; (Target Acquisition Battery &quot;Bats&quot;), a company-sized fully airborne LRRP unit composed of artillery soldiers that trained at the I-LRRP school of Weingarten. This group later was incorporated in the Paratroopers Brigade &quot;Folgore&quot;, becoming the 185th Paratroopers Reconnaissance Target Acquisition Regiment &quot;Folgore&quot;.

===Kenya===

The Kenya Defence Forces has one LRS unit based in Nairobi. This unit shares LRP missions with the Special Forces Group.

===Netherlands===

The Korps Commandotroepen and NLMARSOF are LRRP capable. During the Cold War, the Korps Commandotroepen were known as Waarneming en Verkenning Compagnie (observation and reconnaissance company) and specialized in staying behind enemy lines. NLMARSOF&#x27;s C-Squadron consists of two special recon units: Mountain Leaders and Special Forces Underwater Operators. From 1995 until 2010 the 11th Airmobile Brigade Air Assault had 3 platoons of long range scouts (RECCE). Main objective battlefield intelligence and direct actions. Trained in stay behind operations working in small units. These highly flexible units operated completely on its own in cross FLOT operations.

===New Zealand===

The New Zealand Special Air Service (NZSAS) is New Zealand&#x27;s Special forces branch. NZSAS served with the Australian SAS Squadron during the Vietnam War and carried out Long-range reconnaissance patrols and ambushing of enemy supply routes, mounting 155 patrols over three tours.

===Norway===

The Norwegian Army has LRRP operations dating back to the 1960s, &quot;Fjernoppklaring&quot; (remote reconnaissance). It was split in two, creating a new group of airborne special forces, &quot;Hærens Jegerkommando&quot;, and the current LRRP unit &quot;Fjernoppklaringseskadronen&quot;. &quot;Fjernoppklaringseskadronen&quot; is part of the Norwegian army under &quot;Etterretningsbataljonen&quot; (Military Intelligence Battalion).

===Portugal===
Presently, in the Portuguese Army, LRRP operations are carried out by the Special Operations Forces.

The Special Actions Detachment of the Portuguese Navy also carries out LRRP missions, mainly in the scope of amphibious operations.

From 1983 to 1993, the Portuguese Army Comando Regiment included the REDES Company, a specialist LRRP unit.

===Serbia===

LRRP units within the Serbian Army Special Brigade and 72nd Reconnaissance Commando Battalion have been operating since 1992.

===Spain===

LRRP is carried out in Spain by the Advanced Reconnaissance Parachute Company of the Paratroopers Brigade &quot;Almogávares&quot; VI and the Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (TAR) Company of the HQ Battalion within the Spanish Marine Infantry. In the past long-range reconnaissance patrols of Spanish forces have played a notable role in the Bosnian War, specially the deep reconnaissance patrols carried out by the Special Operations Unit (UOE) of the Spanish marines within the multinational battalion.

===Sri Lanka===
Long-range reconnaissance patrols of the Armed forces of Sri Lanka have played a notable role in Sri Lanka&#x27;s multi-phase military campaign against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). LRRP members attached to Special forces of the Sri Lankan Army have been most successful in carrying out assassinations on high-ranking members of the LTTE. The LRRP concept was developed by Major Sreepathi Gunasekara who formed a special recon unit named &#x27;Delta Patrols&#x27; in 1986 which later evolved into a highly secretive SF LRRP battalion. Special mission units such as the 3rd Commando Regiment and the 3rd Army Special Forces Regiment have Specialized LRRP battalions. There are also LRRP units attached to Infantry battalions.

Until the end of the war, the government kept their very existence under wraps.

===United Kingdom===
The Honourable Artillery Company (HAC) and its regular sister unit, 4/73 (Sphinx) Special Observation Post Battery Royal Artillery, currently operate in the surveillance and target acquisition role.

During the Second World War, the Long Range Desert Group performed long-range reconnaissance and raiding during the North African Campaign and during the Cold War, the Corps Patrol Unit (CPU) consisted of 21 and 23 SAS and the HAC.

====Cold War====

The 21 SAS was stood up in 1947 specifically for the task of letting themselves be bypassed and staying-behind in the event of a Soviet Invasion of Western Europe, they were later joined by 23 SAS and in 1973, the Honourable Artillery Company (HAC) which became a Surveillance and Target Acquisition (STA) Patrol Regiment providing Stay-Behind Observation Posts (SBOP) with their three squadrons each with a number of four to six man patrols. HAC provided SBOP capabilities to the HQs of 1st Artillery Brigade (HQ Sqn HAC), 1 Armoured Division (I Sqn HAC), 4 Armoured Division (II Sqn HAC), and 1 BR Corps (III Sqn HAC) with one ‘sabre’ squadron each

===United States===

====World War II====
The predecessor of the U.S. Army&#x27;s LRRP teams was the U.S. Sixth Army Special Reconnaissance Unit, better known as the Alamo Scouts. In the South West Pacific Theater of Operations, the Alamo Scouts conducted over 110 intelligence gathering missions behind enemy lines throughout New Guinea and the Philippines during 1944–45. General Walter Krueger established the Alamo Scouts Training Center to train candidates in long-range reconnaissance patrol techniques, including rubber boat handling, intelligence gathering, report writing, scouting and patrolling, jungle navigation, communications, weapons training, and camouflage. Of those that successfully completed the rigorous course, 138 became full-time Alamo Scouts, while the others returned to their units to serve as reconnaissance troops. After Japan&#x27;s surrender, the Alamo Scouts Training Center was closed down and the unit was disbanded. In 1988, the U.S. Army retroactively awarded members of the Alamo Scouts the Special Forces tab due to their wartime record and the techniques they pioneered.

====In Germany====

The modern US Army long-range reconnaissance patrol concept was created in 1956 by the 11th Airborne Division in Augsburg, Germany. They patrolled near the Czechoslovakian and East German borders, then members of the Communist Warsaw Pact states, and in event of war in Europe would be inserted behind enemy lines to provide surveillance and to select targets of opportunity. The LRRP concept was well known throughout the Army though concentrated in 7th Army in Germany. Provisional LRRP Companies made up of both trained LRRPs and regular soldiers were put together for a series of exercises called Wintershield and proved themselves in the field. After the 11th Airborne Division was inactivated on 1 July 1958, the Department of the Army authorized two Airborne LRRP companies in 1961: Company D, 17th Infantry and Company C, 58th Infantry in the Wildflecken and Nellingen Barracks (near Stuttgart), and were respectively assigned to V Corps and VII Corps. In 1963, V Corps LRRPs (Company D) transferred to the Gibbs Kaserne in Frankfurt near Corps HQ. In 1965, these companies developed the first LRRP Table of Organization and Equipment and in doing so increased their strength to 208 men, team size from 4 to 5 men, as well as adding an organic transport component. All LRRPs from team leader and above were to be Ranger qualified. The experiences of these two companies formed the basis of the first US Army LRRP manual. Both companies used carrier wave (Morse Code) radios including the AN/TRC-77 for long-range communications to their respective Corps G2 (Intelligence) center. In 1968, both companies were transferred to the United States, but neither were sent to Vietnam because they retained their status as LRRP units for V and VII Corps in the event of war in Europe.

All LRRPs were redesignated as &quot;Ranger&quot; on 1 February 1969, and these two units (companies C and D) respectively became Companies B and A, 75th Infantry (Ranger). They were the only Ranger units to remain on active duty at the end of the Vietnam War and they continued in service until November 1974 when they were inactivated, with most of their personnel forming the core of the new 1st and 2nd Battalions (Ranger), 75th Infantry.

====In Italy====
In the 1960s, the U. S. Army Southern European Task Force (SETAF) utilized the Airborne Recon Platoon of the 1st Combat Aviation Company (Provisional) located in Verona, Italy. They provided reconnaissance missions as well as target acquisition and battle damage assessment for SETAF which was a missile command.

The Airborne Recon Platoon was a LRRP unit that served as the “eyes and ears” for SETAF. During the period of 1961-62 Lieutenant James D. James commanded the platoon. Three years later in 1965 when Captain James served in Vietnam with the 1st Cavalry Division he utilized much of the tactics, structure, and doctrine of the Airborne Recon Platoon when creating Company E, 52nd Infantry (LRP). Captain James retired from the army as a colonel.

====In Vietnam====

In December 1965, the 1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division, formed a LRRP platoon, and by April 1966, the 1st Infantry Division, 25th Infantry Division and each of the four Battalions of the 173rd Airborne Brigade formed LRRP units as well. On 8 July 1966, General William Westmoreland authorized the formation of a (LRRP) unit in each infantry brigade or division in Vietnam. By 1967 formal LRRP companies were organized, most having three platoons, each with five six-man teams equipped with VHF/FM AN/PRC-25 radios. LRRP training was notoriously rigorous and team leaders were often graduates of the U.S. Army&#x27;s 5th Special Forces Group Recondo School in Nha Trang, Vietnam.

Tiger Force was the nickname of an infamous long-range reconnaissance patrol unit of the 1st Battalion (Airborne), 327th Infantry Regiment, 1st Brigade (Separate), 101st Airborne Division, which fought in the Vietnam War, and was responsible for counterinsurgency operations against the North Vietnamese People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and Viet Cong. 

The platoon-sized unit, approximately 45 paratroopers, was founded by Colonel David Hackworth in November 1965 to &quot;outguerrilla the guerrillas&quot;. Tiger Force (Recon) 1-327th was a highly decorated small unit in Vietnam, and paid for its reputation with heavy casualties. In October 1968, Tiger Force&#x27;s parent battalion was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation by President Lyndon B. Johnson, which included a mention of Tiger Force&#x27;s service at Đắk Tô in June 1966.

Since satellite communications were a thing of the future, one of the most daring long-range penetration operations of the war was launched by members of Company E, 52nd Infantry (LRP) of the 1st Air Cavalry Division, against the PAVN when they seized &quot;Signal Hill&quot; the name attributed to the peak of Dong Re Lao Mountain, a densely forested mountain, midway in A Shau Valley, so its 1st and 3rd Brigades, who would be fighting behind a wall of mountains, could communicate with Camp Evans near the coast or with approaching aircraft.

The US Marine Corps also performed long-range reconnaissance missions typically assigned to Marine Recon, especially Force Recon at the corps-level (i.e., Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF)) level, as opposed to the Battalion Recon units answering to battalion commanders. Marine Recon teams typically were twice as large as Army LRRPs and were more heavily armed, however, sacrificing a degree of stealth. In addition, the Marines did not employ indigenous Montagnards as front and rear scouts as Army LRRPs and Special Forces teams did which proved invaluable in confusing the enemy if contact was made. The tactical employment of LRRPs was later evaluated to be generally used far too dangerously by commanders, who were pleased by the kill ratios of LRRPs teams (reported as high as 400 enemy troops for every LRRP killed). Writes one commentator: &quot;During the course of the war Lurps conducted around 23,000 long-range patrols, of this amount two-thirds resulted in enemy sightings.&quot; LRRPs also accounted for approximately 10,000 enemy KIA through ambushes, air strikes, and artillery.

In February 1969, all US Army LRRP units were folded into the newly formed 75th Infantry Regiment (Ranger), a predecessor of the 75th Ranger Regiment, bringing back operational Ranger units for the first time since the Korean War. The Army had inactivated Ranger units after Korea, but kept Ranger School, on the premise that spreading Ranger School graduates throughout the Army would improve overall performance. The initial Ranger companies formed in 1969 were: &quot;A&quot; V Corps, Fort Hood, Texas; &quot;B&quot; VII Corps, Fort Lewis, Washington; &quot;C&quot; I Field Force, Vietnam; &quot;D&quot; II Field Force, Vietnam; &quot;E&quot; 9th Infantry Division, Vietnam; F 25th Infantry Division, Vietnam; &quot;G&quot; 23d Infantry Division, Vietnam; &quot;H&quot; 1st Cavalry Division, Vietnam; &quot;I&quot; 1st Infantry Division, Vietnam; &quot;K&quot; 4th Infantry Division, Vietnam; &quot;L&quot; 101st Airborne Division, Vietnam; &quot;M&quot; 199th Light Infantry Brigade, Vietnam; &quot;N&quot; 173d Airborne Brigade, Vietnam; &quot;O&quot; 3d Brigade, 82d Airborne Division, Vietnam; and &quot;P&quot; 1st Brigade, 5th Infantry Division (Mechanized), Vietnam. Following its mobilization for Vietnam service, Company D (LRP), 151st Infantry of the Indiana Army National Guard completed its tour in Vietnam and, as it departed, Company D (Ranger), 75th Infantry was raised to replace it. Company F (LRP), 425th Infantry of the Michigan Army National Guard and Company E (Ranger) 65th Infantry of the Puerto Rico Army National Guard were not mobilized or sent to Vietnam. As National Guard units, D-151st, E-65th, and F-425th retained their regimental designations and were not reflagged as companies of the 75th Infantry.

As the Vietnam War matured, I Field Force LRRPs widened their area of operation to include I Corps and II Corps, and II Field Force LRRPs respectively included III Corps and IV Corps.

The legacy of LRRP units later continued with the U.S. Army&#x27;s Long Range Surveillance (both detachments and companies), which have been dropped from the force structure and inactivated, and exists today in the dismounted reconnaissance troops of Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition squadrons.

==NATO International Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol School==

In 1977, Belgium, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom sent instructors to Germany to work on the planning of an international long-range reconnaissance patrol (LRRP) school. From 1979 onward, joint training for LRRP and military stay-behind units was conducted at NATO&#x27;s International Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol School (ILRRPS) in Weingarten, Germany, under the lead of UK SF. British SAS, German Fernspäher, Dutch Marines, Belgian Para-Commandos, US SF, and others worked and trained together on a daily basis. ILRRPS provided specialist training to allow soldiers to operate effectively in gathering intelligence behind enemy lines. Courses included Long Range Reconnaissance, Combat Survival (E&amp;E and resistance to interrogation), Advanced WP Specialist Recognition, Close Quarter Battle and so on. TRISTAR, a NATO LRRP exercise originally sponsored by the SAS, was conducted annually.
In May 2001, the ILRRPS was renamed the International Special Training Center (ISTC).

<text>The Statimc (), also known as the Lillooet (), St̓át̓imc, or Stl&#x27;atl&#x27;imx (), are an Interior Salish people located in the southern Whale Mountains and Fraser Canyon region of the Interior of the Canadian province of British Columbia.
Statimc culture displayed many features typical of Northwest Coast peoples: the potlatch, clan names, mythology, prestige afforded the wealthy and generous, and totem poles in some communities, especially in the Lil&#x27;wat First Nation (&quot;Lil&#x27;wat7ul&quot;), whose tribal lands and trade routes in the Whistler Valley and Green River Valley overlapped with those of the Squamish First Nation, a Coast Salish people. Today they total about 6259.

==Groups==
The Statimc are divided linguistically, culturally and geographically into two main tribes or First Nations.

* The Upper Statimc (Upper Lillooet or Fraser River Lillooet), living near the present city of Lillooet on the Fraser River. They refer to themselves as &quot;STLA&#x27;tlei-mu-wh-talk&quot; and speak &quot;Statimcets&quot; dialect.
* The Lower Statimc (Lower Lillooet or Mount Currie Lillooet), living in the vicinity of today&#x27;s Mount Currie in the Pemberton Valley and south to Skookumchuk. They refer to themselves as &quot;LEEL&#x27;-wat-OOL&quot; – &#x27;The true People&#x27;, &#x27;The true Lillooet&#x27; (of which were the words &#x27;Lillooet&#x27; and &#x27;Lilwat&#x27; derived) and speak &quot;Ucwalmícwts&quot; dialect.
* The Lakes Lillooet (&quot;Lexalexamux&quot; or &quot;Tsala&#x27;lhmec&quot; – &#x27;Lake People&#x27;), a group only sporadically recognized, living between the territories of Upper Statimc and Lower Statimc around Seton Lake and Anderson Lake – whose descendants are today&#x27;s N&#x27;quatqua First Nation (also known as &quot;Anderson Lake Indian Band&quot;) and Seton Lake First Nation (also known as &quot;Seton Lake Indian Band&quot;), historically a group at the foot of Seton Lake, near Lillooet, known as the &quot;Skimka&#x27;imx&quot; were also included in this group.

===Lower Statimc===
*the Lil&#x27;wat First Nation, their traditional territory extended south to Rubble Creek in the Cheakamus River drainage, near Garibaldi townsite, north to just below Anderson Lake, east to the Upper Stein Valley and west to the Toba Inlet of the Pacific Ocean, in total approximately 780,000 ha, the current community Mount Currie (or &quot;Lilwatul&quot;) is the heart of the Lil’wat Nation territory
*the Xa&#x27;xtsa First Nation (also known as the Douglas First Nation), Xa’xtsa (pronounce: &quot;ha-htsa&quot;) is made up of two communities: Port Douglas at the northern end of Little Harrison Lake, about 90 km northeast of Vancouver, and their main community Tipella, on the west side of the Lillooet River, southernmost of the In-SHUCK-ch communities, and also of the entire St’atl’imx linguistic group ()
*the Skatin First Nations (pron. ), at Skookumchuck Hot Springs on the Lillooet River, the community is located on the east side of the Lillooet River, on the 19-Mile Post of the old Harrison-Lillooet wagon road (about 35 kilometres from the head of Harrison Lake), before the arrival of European settlers, this community was considered to be the largest on the lower Lillooet River, comparable in size to the pre-contact village of present-day Mount Currie of the Lil&#x27;wat First Nation
*the Samahquam First Nation () (‘warm place out of the cold’, pronounced: &#x27;shah-MAH-kwum&#x27;), returned to their reservation lands in the early 1990s and constructed the Baptiste Smith community, at the southwest end of Little Lillooet Lake (aka &quot;Tenas Lake&quot;, derived from the Chinook Jargon &quot;tenass&quot; – &#x27;little&#x27;) on the Lillooet River system. They once occupied both sides of Little Lillooet Lake.

The tiny and remote communities of Samahquam, Xa&#x27;xtsa and Ska&#x27;tin Bands collectively, including the Tenas Lake Band, seceded from the larger Lillooet Tribal Council (now called the Statimc Nation) at the same time to join the N&#x27;quatqua First Nation at (D&#x27;Arcy) to form the In-SHUCK-ch Nation. Since the 1980s these First Nations called themselves Nsvq’tsmc (&#x27;In-SHUCK-ch micw&#x27;), derived from &quot;Nsvq’ts&quot; – &#x27;split like a crutch&#x27;, the name of the holy mountain, now called In-SHUCK-ch Mountain (also called Gunsight Mountain).

===Upper Statimc===
The tribal territory of the different groups of the Upper Státimc extended west of the Fraser River from the mouth of the Pavilion Creek (′Sk&#x27;elpáqs′) to the Texas Creek in the mountains above the Bridge River and westward through the valleys of Seton Lake and Anderson Lake to Duffey Lake. The territory of the Upper Státimc east of the Fraser River included the Three Lake Valley (also known as &quot;Fountain Valley&quot;) and the adjacent mountains and stretched towards the Hat Creek, a tributary of the Bonaparte River.

The Upper Státimc settled in several main settlements on the banks above the Fraser River and on the banks of the Seton and Anderson Lake — probably the word &#x27;Státimc&#x27; is derived from a former village &quot;Tatlh&quot; on Keatley Creek. Previous there were the following communities: &quot;Sk&#x27;ámqain&quot; on the shore of Seton Lake, &quot;Sat&quot; at the site of present-day city of Lillooet, &quot;Nxwísten&quot; at the mouth of the Bridge River, &quot;Xáxlip&quot; (′Fountain′), &quot;Slha7äs&quot; and &quot;Tsal&#x27;álh&quot; along Seton Lake and &quot;Nk&#x27;wátkwa&quot; on the western shore of Lake Anderson. Beside those significant settlements there have been several smaller villages. In Pavilion (Tsk&#x27;wáylacw), a mainly ethnically and linguistically Secwepemc settlement in the 19th century, since the beginning of the 20th century this community speaks usually Statimcets, but their particular dialect is a hybrid of Statimcets and Secwepemctsin, because there had been many mixed marriages between Secwepemc and Státimc, know forming the Tsk&#x27;weylecw&#x27;mc or Pavilion Indian Band.

*N&#x27;quatqua in D&#x27;Arcy. Also known as the Anderson Lake Band and one of the original members of the breakaway In-SHUCK-ch Nation, although now on its own from that organization and from the Lillooet Tribal Council, despite close family ties to the various bands of that organization. Located at the head of Anderson Lake, northeast of Pemberton. Historically the N&#x27;Quatqua and Tsalalh bands were one group, the Lakes Lillooet or Lexalexamux, and included a group at the foot of Seton Lake, near Lillooet, known as the Skimka&#x27;imx.
*Tsaľálh (Shalalth), Skeil, Ohin, Lh7us (Slosh) and Nquayt (Nkiat). Lh7us and Nquayt are at Seton Portage, Skeil, Ohin and Shalalth farther east along Seton Lake. All of these are collectively self-governed within the Lillooet Tribal Council as the Seton Lake First Nation.
*Sekw&#x27;el&#x27;wás in Lillooet (Cayoose Creek/Pashilqua Reserves)
*Títq&#x27;et in Lillooet, also spelled Tl&#x27;itl&#x27;kt (Lillooet Reserve)
*Nxwísten in Lillooet (Bridge River Indian Band)
*Cácl&#x27;ep near Lillooet (pron. and also spelled Xa&#x27;xlip) Fountain Indian Band.
*Tsk&#x27;weylecw (in an older spelling used in Statimcets called &quot;Tsk&#x27;waylaxw&quot;, also known as the Pavilion Indian Band and located at Pavilion, which is between Lillooet and Cache Creek on the lip of the Fraser Canyon and at the outlet of the karst landscape forming Marble Canyon, beyond which are the territories of the Bonaparte Band of the Secwepemc (Shuswap) peoples, who are part of the Shuswap Nation Tribal Council.

==History==
They had several types of dwellings—long plank houses, winter earthlodges, and summer bark- or mat-covered lodges, not unlike those at the Keatley Creek Archaeological Site. Salmon and other fish were the basis of the economy, and numerous animals (bear, sheep, caribou, deer, and small mammals) were hunted and trapped, and berries and fruit were gathered. Warfare with other groups was unusual, with intensive intertribal trade the more typical state of affairs. The Tsilhqot’in-St’at’imc war was one brutal war for the St’at’imc and threatened their survival as a nation. The Tsilhqot’in raided all 11 bands of the Statimc and took women and children as slaves. Both nations met at many roots (Graveyard Valley) in the St’at’imc territory at which the Statimc were victorious. Chief In-Kick-Tee (Hunter Jack) was the warchief in that battle and made a peace treaty in 1845.

===Declaration of the Lillooet Tribe===
The declaration of the Lillooet Tribe was made in 1911 in Spences Bridge and is the nation&#x27;s declaration of ownership over lands that had been seized by non-native settlers at Seton Portage at the onset of the 20th century, and is considered a general statement of principle regarding ownership of all traditional territories of the Statimcets-speaking peoples. The Declaration of the Lillooet Tribe is the Lillooet Tribe&#x27;s first formal declaration to the world of the tribes status as a Country, in International terms, as they understood them at that time. The Declaration is mentioned as the foundation document of all the various organizations of the Lillooet Tribe in place today, such as the Statimc Chiefs Council, Lillooet Tribal Council and the In-SHUCK-ch Nation. The Declaration brings the tribe together at the grassroots level as a Country.

==Language==

The ancestral language of the Státimc people is Lillooet (also known as Statimcets, also spelled &quot;St̓át̓imcets&quot; or sometimes even &quot;Sƛ̓áƛ̓imxəc&quot;, pronounced [ˈʃtɬʼætɬʼɪmxətʃ]), a member of the Interior Salish group which includes the languages of the neighbouring Secwepemc (Shuswap) and Nlaka&#x27;pamux (Thompson) peoples.

<text>The Watzmann () is a mountain in the Berchtesgaden Alps south of the village of Berchtesgaden. It is the third highest in Germany, and the highest located entirely on German territory.

Three main peaks array on a N-S axis along a ridge on the mountain&#x27;s taller western half: Hocheck (2,651 m), Mittelspitze (Middle Peak, 2,713 m) and Südspitze (South Peak, 2,712 m).

The Watzmann massif also includes the 2,307 m Watzmannfrau (&quot;Watzmann Wife&quot;, also known as Kleiner Watzmann or &quot;Small Watzmann&quot;), and the Watzmannkinder (&quot;Watzmann Children&quot;), five lower peaks in the recess between the main peaks and the Watzmannfrau.

The entire massif lies inside Berchtesgaden National Park.

== Watzmann Glacier and other icefields ==
The Watzmann Glacier is located below the famous east face of the Watzmann in the Watzmann cirque and is surrounded by the &quot;Watzmanngrat&quot; arête, the &quot;Watzmannkindern&quot; and the &quot;Kleiner Watzmann&quot;.

The size of the glacier reduced from around in 1820 until it split into a few fields of firn, but between 1965 and 1980 it advanced significantly again and now has an area of .

Above and to the west of the icefield lie the remains of a JU 52 transport-bomber that crashed in October 1940.
Amongst the other permanent snow and icefields the &quot;Eiskapelle&quot; (&quot;Ice Chapel&quot;) is the best known due to its easy accessibility from St. Bartholomä. The &quot;Eiskapelle&quot; may well be the lowest lying permanent snowfield in the Alps. Its lower end is only 930 metres high in the upper Eisbach valley and is about an hour&#x27;s walk from St. Bartholomä on the Königssee. The &quot;Eiskapelle&quot; is fed by mighty avalanches that slide down from the east face of the Watzmann in spring and accumulate in the angle of the rock face. Sometimes a gate-shaped vault forms in the ice at the point where the Eisbach emerges from the &quot;Eiskapelle&quot;. Before entering there is an urgent warning sign that others have been killed by falling ice.

In the east face itself is another icefield in the so-called Schöllhorn cirque, called the &quot;Schöllhorneis&quot;, which is crossed by the Kederbach Way (&quot;Kederbacher-Weg&quot;). The cirque and icefield are named after the Munich citizen, Christian Schöllhorn, who was the first victim on the east face. On 26 May 1890 he fell at the upper end of the icefield into the randkluft and was fatally injured. Another small nameless snowfield is located several hundred metres below the Mittelspitze also in the east face.

==Climbing==
===From the North===

The best climbing period is June through September, in some years October. The easiest route is to follow hiking trails from the village of Ramsau near the small town of Berchtesgaden up to the Watzmann Hut at 1,928 metres, such as hiking trail 441 from Wimbachbrücke. This is quoted as taking four hours, though an experienced hiker can do it in less than three. One typically spends the night there and then climbs to the summit the next morning. The climb from the hut to the Hocheck peak (2,651 m) is quite straightforward, though a head for heights is required on the peak. The Hocheck is around two hours from the Watzmann Hut. From the Hocheck, hikers can return to the hut or continue and traverse to the Mittelspitze and from there to the Südspitze. The traverse is more challenging, at the easier end of UIAA Class II, and very exposed. Permanent cables once existed along the ridge, but were dismantled at some points to prevent inexperienced hikers from attempting the traverse, having a false sense of security. From the Südspitze, most hikers will not return to the Watzmann Hut but continue to descend into the &quot;Wimbachgries&quot; valley and from there back to Ramsau. One should estimate 12 to 17 hours for the complete circuit, stable weather conditions are essential as drastic weather change on the ridge between the peaks can be fatal.

=== Archenkanzel ===

On the northeastern face of the massif at is a scenic viewpoint called Archenkanzel. From there, it is possible to look down to lake Königssee, which is 743 meters below, and also to St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Church.

===East Face===
A much more serious and challenging climb is the famous East Face (&quot;Watzmann-Ostwand&quot;), which rises from the Hirschau peninsula at lake Königssee to the main peaks in a vertical ascent of around 1,800 metres (the longest wall in the Eastern Alps). While the easiest routes through the east wall is rated UIAA Class III, the wall has claimed almost 100 lives so far. Difficulties include the length of the climb, route-finding, and deteriorating weather conditions approaching from west, the predominant direction for weather change in the area, difficult to ascertain from the face. A simple emergency shelter has been erected in the wall. Even experienced climbers are advised to hire a local guide for the wall as finding the route can be challenging.

<text>John Morin &quot;Jack&quot; Bradbury (December 27, 1914 – May 15, 2004) was an American animator and comic book artist. Bradbury began working for Disney at age 20 and was responsible for key scenes in films like &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, &quot;Fantasia&quot; and &quot;Bambi&quot;. After working briefly for Friz Freleng at Warner Bros., he began working for Western Publishing in 1947, illustrating Little Golden Books, other children&#x27;s books, and comic books for the Dell Comics and Gold Key Comics imprints along with the Disney Studio Program. Reportedly, Walt Disney told Western that they didn&#x27;t need his approval for any of Bradbury&#x27;s work. Also, Bob Clampett specifically requested Bradbury to illustrate the comic book adaptation of his show &quot;Time for Beany&quot;.

==Career==
According to the book &quot;Walt&#x27;s People - Volume 3: Talking Disney with the Artists who Knew Him&quot; by Didier Ghez, which presents a full reprint of an interview with Jack conducted by Klaus Strzyz in 1978, he never considered himself a &quot;very good duck man&quot;, preferring to draw stories with Mickey and Goofy. When Mr. Strzyz asked him about the quality of 1940s, 1950s and 1960s Disney comic stories in comparison with the 1970s ones, he answered that the then later ones were far better in terms of quality, the only exception being Barks&#x27; old ones. He also affirmed that he felt embarrassed when he saw some of his own early works.

Although he didn&#x27;t have a very good opinion about his own work with Donald and his family, Bradbury drew important and popular stories with them, like &quot;Family Tree&quot;. And some of those ones presented noteworthy one-off characters as well, such as Blarney O&#x27;Duck (a cunning and obstinate sea captain), Cousin Daniel Duck (an old sheriff with rheumatism), Dick Duck (a self-important and terribly frank private detective), Myron O&#x27;Duck (a scoundrel who almost married Grandma Duck), and Aunt Myrtle (an absurdly strong but nice aunt of Daisy).

Eye problems forced Bradbury to cut back on his output after 1970, though he still continued to work on a few projects for Disney.

He died in 2004 from kidney failure.

<doc id="662376" wikidata="Q1066396" url="?curid=662376" title="Tex Watson">
<text>Charles Denton &quot;Tex&quot; Watson (born December 2, 1945) is an American murderer who was a central member of the &quot;Manson Family&quot; led by Charles Manson. On August 9, 1969, Watson, Patricia Krenwinkel, and Susan Atkins murdered pregnant actress Sharon Tate, Jay Sebring, Wojciech Frykowski, Abigail Folger, and Steven Parent at 10050 Cielo Drive in Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles. The next night, Watson traveled to Los Feliz, Los Angeles, and participated in the murders of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca. Watson was convicted of murder in 1971 and sentenced to death. As a result of a 1972 California Supreme Court decision on the constitutionality in the state of the death penalty, he avoided execution but has remained incarcerated ever since.

==Early life==
Watson was born in Dallas, Texas, on December 2, 1945, and grew up in nearby Copeville. He was the youngest of three children. Watson grew up attending church locally, and was an honor student, editor on the school paper, and captain of the football team, and set a record for the high hurdles at Farmersville High School. In September 1964, Watson moved to Denton, Texas, to attend the University of North Texas, where he became a member of Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity.

== Introduction to Manson Family ==

In January 1967, Watson began working at Braniff International as a baggage handler. Using free airline tickets to travel, he visited a fraternity brother in Los Angeles; there he became interested in the psychedelic and music lifestyle of the late 1960s. While driving one day, Watson picked up a hitchhiker, Dennis Wilson of The Beach Boys, and drove him to Wilson&#x27;s house. There he was first introduced to the Manson Family who lived with Wilson.

== Time at Spahn Ranch ==
Watson lived with the Manson Family at Spahn Ranch for nine months before the crimes, becoming close to Manson, and eventually choosing to believe Manson&#x27;s lies and deception. According to the late prosecuting attorney Vincent Bugliosi, Manson employed “a variety of techniques&quot; to accomplish this, and was able to bring Watson and others to conspire in following Manson’s delusion to ignite a massive race war (which Manson called “Helter Skelter”, inspired by the Beatles song of the same name) intended to bring in Manson&#x27;s kingdom following this war.

== Drug dealing and Bernard Crowe ==

In December 1968, Watson left the Manson Family. He moved in with a woman who sold small quantities of marijuana and LSD to his friends, and became her lover. The two lived in Hollywood for a few months, improving their illegal activity, until Watson became restless and rejoined the Family.

Following Manson&#x27;s orders to &quot;find money for Helter Skelter&quot;, Watson contrived to steal money from his lover&#x27;s friend, Bernard Crowe. Crowe called the ranch, spoke to Manson and told him he would come to the ranch and kill everyone if he did not get his money back. In response, Manson shot Crowe in the stomach using the same pistol that Watson would use in the Tate murders.

The two encountered one another in the California Men&#x27;s Colony in the early &#x27;80s. Following a long conversation about the past and religion Crowe forgave Watson for his role in the theft and the shooting.

== Tate–LaBianca murders ==
===Tate murders===

On August 9, 1969, as a member of the Manson Family, Watson led Susan Atkins, Linda Kasabian, and Patricia Krenwinkel to 10050 Cielo Drive, the home of Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate. They murdered all four people inside the house, and also Steven Parent in the driveway. Watson and his crime partners inflicted 28 stab wounds to one victim, Abigail Folger, alone.

=== LaBianca murders ===

The following night, Watson and six others went to the home of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca. Manson and Watson entered the home. According to Watson&#x27;s book &quot;Will You Die For Me?&quot;, Manson held the occupants at gunpoint while Watson tied them up, before the gang killed them.

===Conviction===
On October 2, 1969, Watson fled the Spahn Ranch and headed back to his native state of Texas. On November 30, 1969, he was arrested in Texas for the Tate–LaBianca murders. He and his lawyers fought extradition to California for nine months. Upon arriving in California, he stopped talking and eating, losing 55 pounds, and began regressing to a catatonic state. He was admitted to Atascadero State Hospital for a 90‑day evaluation period to determine if he was fit to stand trial. He stayed there until February 1971, when he was deemed able to stand trial.

On October 12, 1971, Watson was convicted on seven counts of first-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder. One week later, the same jury took only two and a half hours to determine that he was sane. On October 21, 1971, he was sentenced to death. He arrived on California&#x27;s death row on November 17, 1971, but avoided execution when the California Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;People v. Anderson&quot; decision resulted in the invalidation of all death sentences imposed in California prior to 1972. He was found guilty of the murders of seven people: Abigail Folger; Wojciech Frykowski; Steven Parent; Sharon Tate Polanski, who was eight months pregnant; Jay Sebring; Leno LaBianca; and Rosemary LaBianca.

==Incarceration==
According to his prisoner outreach website, Watson converted to Christianity in 1975. &quot;Will You Die for Me?&quot;, Watson&#x27;s autobiography, as told to Raymond &quot;Chaplain Ray&quot; Hoekstra, was published in 1978. In 1979, he married Kristin Joan Svege, and together they founded Abounding Love Ministries, Inc. in 1980. Through conjugal visits they were able to have four children (three boys, one girl), but those visits for life prisoners were banned in October 1996. After 24 years of marriage, Svege divorced Watson after meeting another man in 2003. Svege and Watson remain friends. He had become an ordained minister in 1981 and received a B.S. in Business Management in 2009 from California Coast University, a distance-learning college.

In August 1982, a Southern California‑based group, Citizens for Truth, submitted some 80,000 petition signatures and several thousand letters opposing Watson&#x27;s parole. The group received support from Doris Tate, the mother of victim Sharon Tate. In later years the group, with Doris Tate and her daughters Patricia and Debra, submitted petitions with more than two million signatures.

In May 2023, Watson started the Abounding Love Podcast, consisting of sermons given from 1977 to 1984 in the chapel of the California Men&#x27;s Colony, San Luis Obispo, California.

In 2012, Watson disputed a request to release recordings made in 1969 with his defense attorney Bill Boyd. The recordings became part of a bankruptcy proceeding involving the deceased attorney&#x27;s law firm. Members of the Los Angeles Police Department said they believed the recordings might contain clues about unsolved murder cases involving the Manson Family. Watson asked the presiding judge to allow police to listen to the tapes but not take possession of them. Judge Richard A. Schell ruled Watson had waived attorney-client privilege for the tapes after he allowed the co-author of his 1978 memoir to hear the recordings. The LAPD acquired the tapes, which allegedly contained Watson confessing to other murders, but reportedly no new information. In September 2014, Richard Pfeiffer, an attorney for Leslie Van Houten, said that he was considering subpoenaing the tapes to look for information that might help Van Houten in her next parole hearing.

Watson&#x27;s minimum eligible parole date was November 26, 1976; he has been denied parole 18 times since then, including two stipulations. He was most recently given a five-year denial of parole at a board hearing in October 2021. He remains incarcerated at Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego County, California.

== In popular culture ==
* In the 2018 film &quot;Charlie Says&quot;, he is played by Chace Crawford.
* In Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s 2019 film &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot;, a fictionalized version of him is portrayed by Austin Butler.
* In 2019, he was portrayed by Christopher Backus in David Fincher&#x27;s Netflix series &quot;Mindhunter&quot;.

<text>Violent Cases is a short graphic novel written by Neil Gaiman and illustrated by Dave McKean. It was McKean&#x27;s first published work in comics. Though drawn by McKean in shades of blue, brown, and grey, when it was first published by Escape Books in 1987, it was printed in black-and-white. Later editions have been printed in colour.

A narrator, who is drawn to look like Gaiman, tells of how, as a small child in Portsmouth, he was taken by his father to be treated by an osteopath who was once employed by Al Capone. The nature of the narrator&#x27;s relationship with his father, the tales the osteopath told, and the disturbing events that followed, are partially obscured by the narrator&#x27;s imperfect recollection, since he was not old enough to understand those properly at the time.

The book won the 1988 Mekon Award for &quot;Best British Work&quot;, presented by the Society of Strip Illustration. It was nominated for the 1992 Harvey Award for &quot;Best Graphic Album: Previous Released Material&quot;.

== Further reading ==
Both &quot;The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch&quot; and &quot;The Ocean at the End of the Lane&quot; are also set around Portsmouth and employs elements from Gaiman&#x27;s childhood. The three works can be seen as a loose trilogy.

<text>The Cayuga (Cayuga: Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫʼ, &quot;People of the Great Swamp&quot;) are one of the five original constituents of the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois), a confederacy of Native Americans in New York. The Cayuga homeland lies in the Finger Lakes region along Cayuga Lake, between their league neighbors, the Onondaga to the east and the Seneca to the west. Today, Cayuga people belong to the Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation in Ontario, and the federally recognized Cayuga Nation of New York and the Seneca-Cayuga Tribe of Oklahoma.

== History ==
Political relations between the Cayuga, the British, and the Thirteen Colonies during the American Revolution were complicated and variable, with Cayuga warriors fighting on both sides (as well as abstaining from war entirely). Most of the Iroquois nations allied with the British, in part hoping to end encroachment on their lands by colonists. In 1778, various Iroquois bands, oft allied with British-colonial loyalists (Tories) conducted a series of raids along the frontier from Connecticut to New York and into south-central Pennsylvania threatening much of the Susquehanna Valley. From the revolutionary government&#x27;s point of view in Philadelphia, several of these were atrocities, and in the early summer that body proceeded to order Washington to send regiments to quell these disturbances.

Consequently, in 1779, General George Washington of the Continental Army appointed General John Sullivan and James Clinton to lead the Sullivan Expedition, a retaliatory military campaign designed to unseat the Iroquois Confederacy and prevent the nations from continuing to attack New York militias and the Continental Army. The campaign mobilized 6200 troops and devastated the Cayuga and other Iroquois homelands, destroying 40-50 villages. Those destroyed included major Cayuga villages such as Cayuga Castle and &quot;Chonodote&quot; (Peachtown). The expedition, with attacks from the spring through the fall, also destroyed the crops and winter stores of the Iroquois, to drive them out of the land. Survivors fled to other Iroquois tribes, or to Upper Canada. Some were granted land there by the British in recognition of their loyalty to the Crown.

Following the end of the war, the Central New York Military Tract was established in order to grant land bounties to veterans. The tract originally included a Cayuga reservation surrounding the north end of Cayuga Lake, but the reservation was given up a few years later in a treaty with the state.

Some Seneca and Cayuga had left the area earlier even as Tuscarora were migrating north in the early decades of the 1700s, going west of the Alleghenies to the long depopulated Ohio Country lands; settling in Western Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Eastern Ohio. These tribes became known as the Mingo or &quot;Black Mingo&quot;, for they had a bad reputation, so were able to take in their kin after that systematic bloodletting in 1779. After the Sullivan Campaign, more Cayuga joined them, as well as some other bands of Iroquois who left New York before the end of the Revolutionary War. As the American Revolution was nearing its end, settlers resumed trekking west of the Alleghenies in a trickle that by 1810, became a flood. Other eastern Amerindians, joined by eastward remnants of Susquehannock and large groups of Delaware peoples had also traveled the ancient trails through the gaps of the Allegheny to found settlements such as Kittanning (village) and others in the Ohio Valley. Only weakened cobbled together tribes, such as the Mingo, were in the land, which was still mostly empty; creating a situation drawing settlers west in increasing numbers. By 1831 those Indians left in the lands east of Ohio were encouraged by bigotry, and at times forcibly removed to the Indian Territory, in what became Oklahoma. Their remnants, consequently, the Seneca-Cayuga Tribe of Oklahoma are a federally recognized tribe.

On November 11, 1794, the (New York) Cayuga Nation (along with the other &quot;Haudenosaunee&quot; nations) signed the Pickering Treaty with the United States, by which they ceded much of their lands in New York to the United States, forced to do so as allies of the defeated British. It was the second treaty the United States entered into. It recognized the rights of the &quot;Haudenosaunee&quot; as sovereign nations. The Pickering Treaty remains an operating legal document; the U.S. government continues to send the requisite gift of muslin fabric to the nations each year.

The state of New York made additional treaties with the tribes but failed to get them ratified by the Senate. As it lacked the constitutional authority to deal directly with the tribes, individual tribes have sued for land claims since the late 20th century, charging New York had no authority for their actions. The state rapidly arranged sales of more than of former Iroquois lands at inexpensive prices to encourage development in the state. It also granted some western lands to war veterans in lieu of pay. Speculators bought up as much land as they could and resold it to new settlers. Land-hungry Yankees from New England flooded into New York in waves of new settlement, as did some settlers from the Mohawk Valley. Immigrants also came from the British Isles and France after the war.

== Recognized bands ==
There are three Cayuga bands. The two largest, the Lower Cayuga and Upper Cayuga, still live in Ontario, both at Six Nations of the Grand River, a reserve recognized by the Canadian government. Two federally recognized tribes of Cayuga constitute the third band in the United States: the Cayuga Nation of New York in Seneca Falls, New York, and the Seneca-Cayuga Tribe of Oklahoma.

The Cayuga Nation of New York does not have a reservation. Members have lived among the Seneca Nation on their reservation. Since the late 20th century, they have acquired some land in their former homeland by purchase.

== Land claims ==
The Cayuga Nation of New York filed an action on November 19, 1980, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York to pursue legislative and monetary restitution for land taken from it by the State of New York during the 18th and 19th centuries. New York had entered into land sales and leases with the Cayuga Nation after the signing of the Treaty of Canandaigua after the American Revolutionary War. Its failure to get approval of the United States Senate meant the transactions were illegal, as the state had no constitutional authority to deal directly with Indian nations. The Treaty of Canandaigua holds that only the United States government may enter into legal discussions with the &quot;Haudenosaunee&quot;.

In 1981, the Seneca-Cayuga Tribe of Oklahoma was added as a plaintiff in the claim. Following many years of pre-trial motions, a jury trial on damages was held from January 18-February 17, 2000. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the Cayuga Indian Nation of New York and the Seneca-Cayuga Tribe of Oklahoma, finding current fair market value damages of $35 million and total fair rental value damages of $3.5 million. The jury gave the state a credit for the payments it had made to the Cayuga of about $1.6 million, leaving the total damages at approximately $36.9 million. On October 2, 2001, the court issued a decision and order which awarded a prejudgment interest award of $211 million and a total award of $247.9 million.

Both the plaintiffs and the defendants appealed this award. On June 28, 2005, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rendered a decision that reversed the judgment of the trial court. It ruled in favor of the defendants, based on the doctrine of &quot;laches&quot;. Essentially the court ruled that the plaintiffs had taken too long to present their case, when it might have been equitably settled earlier.

The Cayuga Indian Nation of New York sought review of this decision by the Supreme Court of the United States, which was [ denied on May 15, 2006]. The time in which the Cayuga Indian Nation could ask the U.S. Supreme Court to rehear the case has passed.

The Nation reclaimed its first land on July 17, 1996, by purchasing in Seneca Falls, within their land claim area. On August 2, 1997 a dedication was held where members of all the Iroquois Confederacy nations were present. This purchase began the return of the Cayuga People to their ancestral homelands. They planted a pine tree at this dedication as a symbol that the Cayuga People are still alive and wanting to return. The elder women of the Cayuga Nation broke the ground and planted the pine tree to welcome the return of their people to their home territory.

In December 2005, the S.H.A.R.E. (Strengthening Haudenosaunee-American Relations through Education) Farm (including a house) was signed over to the Cayuga nation by United States citizens who had purchased and developed the farm in Aurora, New York. This is the first property which the Cayuga Nation has owned since after being forced to cede its lands after the Revolutionary War. It is the first time they have lived within the borders of their ancestral homeland in more than 200 years. The Cayuga continue to debate having the Bureau of Indian Affairs take this land into trust for them. They have been developing projects featuring indigenous planting, cultivation of herbs and medicinal plants, wild plant collection and a seed saving program.

==Current population==
In 1995 there were nearly 450 Cayuga members in New York. In the 21st century, there are about 4,892 combined members of the Cayuga-Seneca Nation in Oklahoma.

The total number of Iroquois is difficult to establish. About 45,000 Iroquois lived in Canada in 1995, more than 39,000 in Ontario and the remainder in Quebec. Among the six nations and federally recognized units in the United States, total tribal enrollment in 1995 numbered about 30,000. In the 2000 US Census, 45,217 respondents identified solely as Iroquois (but this does not mean they were enrolled as members); and 80,822 as having Iroquois ancestry.

<text>Drug tolerance or drug insensitivity is a pharmacological concept describing subjects&#x27; reduced reaction to a drug following its repeated use. Increasing its dosage may re-amplify the drug&#x27;s effects; however, this may accelerate tolerance, further reducing the drug&#x27;s effects. Drug tolerance is indicative of drug use but is not necessarily associated with drug dependence or addiction. The process of tolerance development is reversible (e.g., through a drug holiday) and can involve both physiological factors and psychological factors.

One may also develop drug tolerance to side effects, in which case tolerance is a desirable characteristic. A medical intervention that has an objective to increase tolerance (e.g., allergen immunotherapy, in which one is exposed to larger and larger amounts of allergen to decrease one&#x27;s allergic reactions) is called drug desensitization.

The opposite concept to drug tolerance is reverse tolerance, in which case the subject&#x27;s reaction or effect will increase following its repeated use. The two notions are not incompatible and tolerance may sometimes lead to reverse tolerance. For example, heavy drinkers initially develop tolerance to alcohol (requiring them to drink larger amounts to achieve a similar effect) but excessive drinking can cause liver damage, which then puts them at risk of intoxication when drinking even very small amounts of alcohol.

Drug tolerance should not be confused with drug tolerability, which refers to the degree to which overt adverse effects of a drug can be tolerated by a patient.

==Tachyphylaxis==

Tachyphylaxis is a subcategory of drug tolerance referring to cases of sudden, short-term onset of tolerance following the administration of a drug.

==Pharmacodynamic tolerance==

Pharmacodynamic tolerance begins when the cellular response to a substance is reduced with repeated use. A common cause of pharmacodynamic tolerance is high concentrations of a substance constantly binding with the receptor, desensitizing it through constant interaction. Other possibilities include a reduction in receptor density (usually associated with receptor agonists), other mechanisms leading to changes in action potential firing rate, or alterations in protein transcription among others adaptations. Pharmacodynamic tolerance to a receptor antagonist involves the reverse, i.e., increased receptor firing rate, an increase in receptor density, or other mechanisms.

While most occurrences of pharmacodynamic tolerance occur after sustained exposure to a drug, instances of acute or instant tolerance (tachyphylaxis) can occur.

==Pharmacokinetic (metabolic) tolerance==

Pharmacokinetics refers to the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of drugs (ADME). All psychoactive drugs are first absorbed into the bloodstream, carried in the blood to various parts of the body including the site of action (distribution), broken down in some fashion (metabolism), and ultimately removed from the body (excretion). All of these factors are very important determinants of crucial pharmacological properties of a drug, including its potency, side effects, and duration of action.

Pharmacokinetic tolerance (dispositional tolerance) occurs because of a decreased quantity of the substance reaching the site it affects. This may be caused by an increase in induction of the enzymes required for degradation of the drug e.g. CYP450 enzymes. This is most commonly seen with substances such as ethanol.

This type of tolerance is most evident with oral ingestion, because other routes of drug administration bypass first-pass metabolism. Enzyme induction is partly responsible for the phenomenon of tolerance, in which repeated use of a drug leads to a reduction of the drug&#x27;s effect. However, it is only one of several mechanisms leading to tolerance.

==Behavioral tolerance==
Behavioral tolerance occurs with the use of certain psychoactive drugs, where tolerance to a behavioral effect of a drug, such as increased motor activity by methamphetamine, occurs with repeated use. It may occur through drug-independent learning or as a form of pharmacodynamic tolerance in the brain; the former mechanism of behavioral tolerance occurs when one learns how to actively overcome drug-induced impairment through practice. Behavioral tolerance is often context-dependent, meaning tolerance depends on the environment in which the drug is administered, and not on the drug itself. Behavioral sensitization describes the opposite phenomenon.

<text>Affymetrix is now Applied Biosystems, a brand of DNA microarray products sold by Thermo Fisher Scientific that originated with an American biotechnology research and development and manufacturing company of the same name. The Santa Clara, California-based Affymetrix, Inc. now a part of Thermo Fisher Scientific was co-founded by Alex Zaffaroni and Stephen Fodor. Stephen Fodor and his group, based on their earlier development of methods to fabricate DNA microarrays using semiconductor manufacturing techniques.

In 1994, the company&#x27;s first product under the &quot;GeneChip&quot; Affymetrix trademark, an HIV genotyping chip was introduced, and the company went public in 1996.

After incorporation, Affymetrix grew in part by acquiring technologies from other companies, including Genetic MicroSystems (slide-based Microarrays and scanners) and Neomorphic (for bioinformatics) in 2000, ParAllele Bioscience (custom SNP genotyping), USB/Anatrace (biochemical reagents) in 2008, Panomics (low to mid-plex applications) in 2008, and eBioscience (flow cytometry) in 2012. Affymetrix spun off Perlegen Sciences in 2000, as a discrete business focusing on wafer-scale genomics to characterize population-variance of genomic markers.

In January 2014, the Food and Drug Administration approved Affymetrix&#x27;s postnatal blood test, CytoScan Dx Assay, looking at whole-genome correlates of congenital abnormalities and other causes of childhood developmental delay.

On January 8, 2016, Thermo Fisher Scientific announced its acquisition of Affymetrix for approximately $1.3 billion, which closed on March 31, 2016.

==History==
Affymetrix, Inc. was spun-off from Affymax Research Institute by Alex Zaffaroni in 1993, and was eventually based in Santa Clara, California, United States. It began as a unit in Affymax N.V. in 1991 under Fodor and his group. In the late 1980s, that group had developed methods for fabricating DNA microarrays, under the &quot;GeneChip&quot; Affymetrix trademark, using semiconductor manufacturing techniques. The company&#x27;s first product, an HIV genotyping GeneChip, was introduced in 1994 and the company went public in 1996.

==Acquisitions==
Prior to its acquisition by Thermo Fisher, and its becoming a line of its products, Affymetrix, Inc. had acquired the technologies of a number of companies. It acquired Genetic MicroSystems for slide-based microarrays and scanners and Neomorphic for bioinformatics, both in 2000, ParAllele Bioscience for custom SNP genotyping, USB/Anatrace for biochemical reagents in 2008, eBioscience for flow cytometry in 2012, and Panomics in 2008 and True Materials to expand its offering of low to mid-plex applications. In 2000, Perlegen Sciences spun out from Affymetrix to focus on wafer-scale genomics for massive data creation and collection required for characterizing population variance of genomic markers and expression for the drug discovery process.

==FDA test approval==
In January 2014, the Food and Drug Administration cleared a first-of-a-kind whole-genome postnatal blood test that can aid physicians in identifying the underlying genetic cause of developmental delay, intellectual disability, congenital anomalies, or dysmorphic features in children, where it was noted that &quot;[a]bout 2 to 3 percent of U.S. children have some sort of intellectual disability, according to the National Institutes of Health.&quot; The test, known as CytoScan Dx Assay, was designed to diagnose these disabilities earlier to expedite appropriate care and support.

<doc id="662411" wikidata="Q980840" url="?curid=662411" title="Gudeg">
<text>Gudeg is a traditional Javanese dish from Yogyakarta, in the Special Region of Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Gudeg is made from young, unripe jackfruit (, ) stewed for several hours with palm sugar and coconut milk. Additional spices include garlic, shallot, candlenut, coriander seed, galangal, bay leaves, and teak leaves, the latter gives a reddish-brown color to the dish. It is often described as &quot;green jack fruit sweet stew&quot;.

==Serving==

Served on its own, gudeg can be considered as a vegetarian food, since it only consists of unripe jackfruit and coconut milk. However, gudeg is commonly served with egg or chicken. Gudeg is served with white steamed rice, chicken either as &quot;opor ayam&quot; (chicken in coconut milk) or &quot;ayam goreng&quot; (fried chicken), &quot;telur pindang&quot;, &quot;opor telur&quot; or just plain hard-boiled egg, tofu and/or tempeh, and &quot;sambel goreng krechek&quot; a stew made of crisp beef skins.

==Variations==

There are several types of gudeg; dry, wet, Yogyakarta style, Solo style and East Javanese style. Dry gudeg has only a bit of coconut milk and thus has little sauce. Wet gudeg includes more coconut milk. The most common gudeg comes from Yogyakarta, and is usually sweeter, drier and reddish in color because of the addition of teak leaves as coloring agent. Solo gudeg from the city of Surakarta is more watery and soupy, with much coconut milk, and is whitish in color because teak leaves are generally not added. Yogyakarta&#x27;s gudeg is usually called &quot;red gudeg&quot;, while Solo&#x27;s gudeg is also called &quot;white gudeg&quot;. The East Javanese style of gudeg has a spicier and hotter taste compared to the Yogyakarta style gudeg, which is sweeter.

Gudeg is traditionally associated with Yogyakarta, and Yogyakarta is sometimes nicknamed &quot;Kota Gudeg&quot; (city of gudeg). The center of Yogyakarta gudeg restaurants is in the Wijilan area to the east side of the Yogyakarta Sultanate palace.

==Availability and packaging==
Gudeg can be packed into a &quot;besek&quot; (box made from bamboo) or &quot;kendil&quot; (clay jar), or canned. Canned gudeg can last up to one year.

Warung and restaurants serving gudeg can be found throughout Indonesian cities, such as Greater Jakarta. It is a popular dish in Javanese restaurants, and can be found in neighboring countries, such as Singapore.

<doc id="662415" wikidata="Q1588658" url="?curid=662415" title="Limited liability partnership">
<text>A limited liability partnership (LLP) is a partnership in which some or all partners (depending on the jurisdiction) have limited liabilities. It therefore can exhibit aspects of both partnerships and corporations. In an LLP, each partner is not responsible or liable for another partner&#x27;s misconduct or negligence. This distinguishes an LLP from a traditional partnership under the UK Partnership Act 1890, in which each partner has joint (but not several) liability. In an LLP, some or all partners have a form of limited liability similar to that of the shareholders of a corporation. Depending on the jurisdiction, however, the limited liability may extend only to the negligence or misconduct of the other partners, and the partners may be personally liable for other liabilities of the firm or partners.

Unlike corporate shareholders, the partners have the power to manage the business directly. In contrast, corporate shareholders must elect a board of directors under the laws of various state charters. The board organizes itself (also under the laws of the various state charters) and hires corporate officers who then have as &quot;corporate&quot; individuals the legal responsibility to manage the corporation in the corporation&#x27;s best interest. An 

LLP also contains a different level of tax liability from that of a corporation.

The combination of the flexibility of the partnership structure with the protection from liability for the individual negligence or misconduct of other partners makes the structure attractive to professional-services firms with potentially large exposure to professional malpractice claims in the absence of limited liability. The form has thus historically been adopted most widely by law firms and accounting firms.

==Effect of limited liability==
Limited Liability Partnerships, as well as all forms of limited liability companies, offer alternatives to traditional company and corporate structures. Limited liability can enable opportunities for new business growth that were formerly accessible only to those who had access to large amounts of capital or other resources.

Depending on jurisdiction and industry, there can be negative consequences for stakeholders associated with limited liability. For some large accountancy firms in the UK, reorganizing as LLPs and LLCs has relieved them of owing the &quot;duty of care&quot; to individuals and clients who are adversely affected by audit failures.
Accountancy firm partners share the profits, but don&#x27;t have to suffer the consequences of negligence by firm or fellow partners. Not content with lobbying and financing political parties to get their way, accountancy firms have hired entire governments to advance their interests. PricewaterhouseCoopers and Ernst &amp;Young hired the legislature of Jersey to enact an LLP Bill, which they themselves had drafted. They awarded themselves protection from lawsuits, with little public accountability... Accounting is central to all calculations about institutionalised abuses, tax and responsibility avoidance. 

In the U.S., the Delaware Supreme Court Chief Justice Myron Steele suggested that limited liability entities should not be held to common law standards of fiduciary principles (as applied to all other company and corporate structures). Instead, he argued that courts should use contractual analysis of the partnership agreement when assessing cases of improper corporate governance. This directly led to elimination of the &quot;independent fiduciary duty of good faith&quot; in Delaware corporate law in 2006.

==Worldwide==
Limited liability partnerships are distinct from limited partnerships in some countries, which may allow all LLP partners to have limited liability, while a limited partnership may require at least one unlimited partner and allow others to assume the role of a passive and limited liability investor. As a result, in these countries, the LLP is more suited for businesses in which all investors wish to take an active role in management.

In some countries, an LLP must have at least one person known as a &quot;general partner&quot;, who has unlimited liability for the company.

There is considerable difference between LLPs as constituted in the U.S. and those introduced in the UK under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000 and adopted elsewhere. The UK LLP is, despite its name, specifically legislated as a corporate body rather than as a partnership.

=== Australia ===
Partnerships are governed on a state-by-state basis in Australia. In Queensland, a limited liability partnership is composed of at least one general partner and one limited partner. It is thus similar to what is called a limited partnership in many countries.

===Canada===
All provinces and territories—except Yukon, Prince Edward Island, and Nunavut—permit LLPs for lawyers and accountants. In British Columbia, the Partnership Amendment Act, 2004 (Bill 35) permits LLPs for lawyers, accountants, and other professionals, as well as businesses.

===China===
In China, the LLP is known as a special general partnership (特殊普通合伙). The organizational form is restricted to knowledge-based professions and technical service industries. The structure shields co-partners from liabilities due to the willful misconduct or gross negligence of one partner or a group of partners.

===France===
There is no exact equivalent of a Limited Liability Partnership in France. A limited partnership is equivalent to the French law vehicle known as a fr:Société en Commandite. A partnership company can be an equity partnership, known as a fr:Société en Participation (SEP), of a general partnership known as a :fr:Société en Nom Collectif (SNC).

===Germany===
The German &quot;Partnerschaftsgesellschaft&quot; or PartG is an association of non-commercial professionals, working together. Though not a corporate entity, it can sue and be sued, own property and act under the partnership&#x27;s name. The partners, however, are jointly and severally liable for all the partnership&#x27;s debts, except when only some partners&#x27; misconduct caused damages to another party — and then only if professional liability insurance is mandatory. Another exception, possible since 2012, is a Partnerschaftsgesellschaft mbB (mit beschränkter Berufshaftung) where all liabilities from professional misconduct are limited by the partnership&#x27;s capital.

The &quot;Partnerschaftsgesellschaft&quot; is not subject to corporate or business tax, only its partners&#x27; respective income is taxed.

===Greece===
An LLP is an approximate equivalent to the Greek ΕΠΕ (Εταιρεία Περιορισμένης Ευθύνης &quot;Etería Periorizménis Evthínis&quot;) meaning Company of Limited Liability. In an ΕΠΕ the partners own personal shares that can be sold by a partner only when all other partners agree. The business management can be exercised either directly by the board of partners or by a General Manager. In the aspect of liability, an ΕΠΕ is identical to an LLP.

===India===
The Limited Liability Partnership Act 2008 was published in the official &quot;Gazette of India&quot; on 9 January 2009 and has been in effect since 31 March 2009. However, only limited sections of the Act have been ratified. Rules of the Act were published in the official Gazette on 1 April 2009 and amended in 2017. The first Limited liability partnership (LLP) was incorporated on 2 April 2009.

In India as in many other jurisdictions, an Limited liability partnership (LLP) is different from a Limited Partnership. A limited liability partnership (LLP) operates like a limited partnership, but in an Limited liability partnership (LLP), each member is protected from personal liability, except to the extent of their capital contribution in the LLP.

# In India, for all purposes of taxation (service tax or any other stipulated tax payment), an LLP is treated like any other Partnership firm.
# Liability is limited to each partners agreed upon contribution to the Limited liability partnership (LLP).
# No partner is liable on account of the independent or unauthorized actions of other partners, thus allowing individual partners to be shielded from joint liability created by another partner&#x27;s wrongful business decisions or misconduct.
# An Limited liability partnership (LLP) shall be a body corporate and a legal entity separate from its partners. It will have perpetual succession. Indian Partnership Act, 1932 shall not be applicable to LLPs and there shall not be any upper limit on number of partners in an LLP unlike an ordinary partnership firm where the maximum number of partners can not exceed 20.
# The Limited liability partnership (LLP) Act has a mandatory requirement that one of the partners in the LLP must be an Indian.
# Provisions have been made for corporate actions like mergers and acquisitions.
# While enabling provisions in respect of winding up and dissolution of LLPs have been made, detailed provisions in this regard would be provided by way of rules under the Act.
# The Registrar of Companies (RoC) shall register and control LLPs.
# The Act also provides rules for Limited Liability Partnerships.

# Separate legal entity: Like a company, LLP also has a separate legal entity. So the partners and the Limited liability partnership (LLP) in are distinct from each other. This is like a company where directors are different from the company.
# No requirement of minimum capital: In the case of companies there should be a minimum amount of capital that should be brought by the members or owners who want to form it. But to start an Limited liability partnership (LLP) there is no requirement of minimum capital.
# Minimum number of members: To start a limited liability partnership at least two members are required initially. However, there is no limit on the maximum number of partners.
# No requirement of compulsory audit: All the companies, whether private or public, irrespective of their share capital, are required to get their accounts audited from a practicing Chartered Accountant in India. But in case of Limited liability partnership (LLP), there is no such mandatory requirement. A limited liability partnership is required to get the audit done only if:
::* the contributions of the LLP exceeds ₹ 25 lakhs or
::* the annual turnover of the LLP exceeds ₹ 40 lakhs

====Benefits====
# It is more flexible to organize the internal structure of LLP. Comparatively, it is complex to organize the internal structure of a company.
# There is no maximum limit for the number of partners in LLP. In the private limited company, shareholders are limited to the extent of 200 shareholders.
# Raising and utilization of funds depends on the partners will. Funds can be bought and utilized only as per the norms listed under the Companies Act, 2013.
# Limited liability partnership (LLP) is exempt from Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT). In contrast, a company has to pay DDT on dividend distribution.
# Professionals like Chartered accountants, Cost Accountants (CMA), Advocates, engineers, and doctors may prefer to register as LLPs.
# No requirement of compulsory audit: All the companies, whether private or public, irrespective of their share capital, are required to get their accounts audited. But in case of Limited liability partnership (LLP), there is no such mandatory requirement. A limited liability partnership is required to get the audit done only if:
#::* the contributions of the LLP exceeds ₹ 25 lakhs or
#::* the annual turnover of the LLP exceeds ₹ 40 lakhs

====Disadvantages====
# Any act of the partner without the other partner may bind the Limited liability partnership (LLP).
# Limited liability partnership (LLP) cannot raise money from the public.
# Angel investors and venture capital firms generally prefer not to invest in LLPs. Private Limited companies are preferred over LLPs. Though its not a very big disadvantage as LLP&#x27;s are generally incorporated by the entrepreneurs to save the compliance costs of Private Limited Company. If a LLP has reached to a stage of raising funds then in such case it can always convert LLP to Private Limited or Public limited. Angel investors and venture capital firms understands it and allows the partners of LLP to convert it to Private Limited and then invests in the converted private limited. Conversion of LLP to Private Limited is not a very difficult thing and as part of ease of doing business, the government of India has made it easier for LLP&#x27;s to covert from LLP to Private Limited in a complete online manner.

====Incorporation process====
* Obtain digital signature from the partners.
* Apply for the Designated Partner Identification Number (DPIN) which is necessary to become a partner in the Limited liability partnership (LLP). Also, it is not mandatory to apply for the DPIN in advance, MCA itself allots it as well at the time of approval of the LLP Registration.
* Apply for the name approval for the LLP (Limited liability partnership) Registration. (One can also proceed without name approval of the LLP, and file the applications for registration)
* India Registrar of Companies issues the Certificate of Incorporation which is the proof for the registration.
* File for a Permanent Account Number (PAN) from NSDL. (In case of LLP Registration in India, there is no need to file for PAN card of LLP after the LLP is Incorporated, LLP Incorporation Certificate, LLP PAN Card and LLP TAN card are issued by the Government on its on once the LLP Incorporation applications are approved.
* Execute an LLP agreement and file with the registrar within thirty days of the formation of the LLP.
* LLP details can be checked on the Ministry of Corporate Affairs website. Go to mca.gov.in &gt; mca services &gt; Master Data &gt; Master Data Services V3 &gt; Enter your LLP Name or LLPIN.

===Ireland===
Limited liability partnerships are permitted in Ireland under the Legal Services Regulation Act, 2015.

===Japan===
 were introduced to Japan in 2006 during a large-scale revamp of the country&#x27;s laws governing business organizations. Japanese LLPs may be formed for any purpose (although the purpose must be clearly stated in the partnership agreement and cannot be general), have full limited liability and are treated as pass-through entities for tax purposes. However, each partner in an Limited liability partnership (LLP) must take an active role in the business, so the model is more suitable for joint ventures and small businesses than for companies in which investors plan to take passive roles.

Japanese LLPs may &quot;not&quot; be used by lawyers or accountants, as these professions are required to do business through an unlimited liability entity.

A Japanese Limited liability partnership (LLP) is not a corporation, (i.e. a separate legal entity from partners within the meaning of Anglo-American Law) but rather, exists as a contractual relationship between the partners, similar to an American Limited liability partnership (LLP). Japan also has a type of corporation with a partnership-styled internal structure, called a godo kaisha, which is closer in form to a British Limited liability partnership (LLP) or American limited liability company.

===Kazakhstan===
The concept of LLP exists in Kazakhstan law. All partners in a Kazakhstan LLP have limited liability, and they are liable for the debts of the partnership to the extent of the value of their corresponding participatory interests in the partnership. The names for LLP in Kazakhstan are &quot;ЖШС&quot; (which stands for ) in Kazakh and &quot;ТОО&quot; (which stands for &quot;Tovarishchestvo s ogranichennoy otvyetstvyennostʼyu&quot;) in Russian. This is the most popular business form in Kazakhstan. Almost any private business may be incorporated as an LLP (notable exceptions are banks, airlines, insurance companies, and mortgage companies, which must be incorporated in the form of a joint stock company).

An LLP in Kazakhstan is a corporate body, and in fact, is a Limited Liability Corporation (LLC). Partners cannot conduct business on their own, and it is the corporate body that conducts the business.

There is also a concept of &quot;simple partnership&quot; in Kazakhstan law, which corresponds more closely to the general concept of partnership, but it is not widely used and is not well developed in Kazakhstan.

===Kenya===
In Kenya, limited liability partnerships have a legal personality distinct from its member partners. The liability of the partners is limited to any amount that may remain unpaid over the capital of the partnership. However, partners may be deemed liable for omissions or actions done by themselves if they lacked the relevant authority from the partnership or the affected party knew that such partner lacked authority or had no reason to believe that such person was a partner in the partnership. Registration is what vests such legal personality upon the entity. Registration is done by the registrar of companies after meeting. The requirements are set out in the Limited Liability Partnership Act of 2011.

===Nigeria===
In Nigeria, limited liability partnerships (LLP) have legal personality. However, one must register a partnership first before it can gain the status of limited liability partnerships. Either way the liability of the partners are limited.

===Poland===
A close equivalent to limited liability partnerships under Polish law is the &quot;spółka partnerska&quot;, where all partners are jointly and severally liable for the partnership&#x27;s debts apart from those arising from another partner&#x27;s misconduct or negligence. This partnership type is only addressed to representatives of some &quot;high risk&quot; occupations, such as lawyers, medicine doctors, tax advisers, accountants, brokers, sworn translators etc.

===Romania===
An Limited liability partnership (LLP) is equivalent to the Romanian law vehicle known as a Societate civilă profesională cu răspundere limitată.

===Singapore===
LLPs are formed under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2005. This legislation draws on both the US and UK models of LLP, and like the latter establishes the Limited liability partnership (LLP) as a body corporate. However, for tax purposes it is treated like a general partnership, so that the partners rather than the partnership are subject to tax (tax transparency).

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom LLPs are governed by the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000 (in Great Britain) and the Limited Liability Partnerships Act (Northern Ireland) 2002 in Northern Ireland, with the rules governing this scheme consolidated across the UK with the Companies Act 2006, the latter coming into effect in 2009. It was lobbied for by the Big Four auditing firms, all of which had converted by January 2003, limiting their liability for their audits. A UK limited liability partnership is a corporate body - that is to say, it has a continuing legal existence independent of its members, as compared to a partnership which may (in England and Wales, does not) have a legal existence dependent upon its membership.

A UK LLP&#x27;s members have a collective (&quot;joint&quot;) responsibility, to the extent that they may agree in an &quot;LLP agreement&quot;, but no individual (&quot;several&quot;) responsibility for each other&#x27;s actions. As with a limited company or a corporation, members in an LLP cannot, in the absence of fraud or wrongful trading, lose more than they invest.

In relation to tax, however, a UK LLP is similar to a partnership, namely, it is tax-transparent. That is to say it pays no UK corporation tax or capital gains tax. Instead, LLP income and/or gains are distributed gross to partners as self-employed persons, rather than as PAYE employees. Partners receiving income and/or gains from an LLP are liable for their own taxation.

There is no requirement for the LLP agreement even to be in writing because simple partnership-based regulations apply by way of default provisions. It has been closely replicated by Japan, Dubai, and Qatar. It is perhaps closest in nature to a limited liability company in the United States of America although it may be distinguished from that entity by the fact that the LLC, while having a legal existence independent of its members, is not technically a corporate body because its legal existence is time limited and therefore not &quot;continuing.&quot;

The LLP structure is commonly used by accountants to retain the tax structure of traditional partnerships whilst adding some limited liability protection. LLPs are also becoming more common among firms in the legal profession such as solicitors although they are permitted to use a limited company structure.

===United States===
In the United States, each individual state has its own law governing their formation. Limited liability partnerships emerged in the early 1990s: while only two states allowed LLPs in 1992, over forty had adopted LLP statutes by the time LLPs were added to the Uniform Partnership Act in 1996.

The limited liability partnership was formed in the aftermath of the collapse of real estate and energy prices in Texas in the 1980s. This collapse led to a large wave of bank and savings and loan failures. Because the amounts recoverable from the banks were small, efforts were made to recover assets from the lawyers and accountants that had advised the banks in the early 1980s. The reason was that partners in law and accounting firms were subject to the possibility of huge claims which would bankrupt them personally, and the first LLP laws were passed to shield innocent members of these partnerships from liability.

Although found in many business fields, the LLP is an especially popular form of organization among professionals, particularly lawyers, accountants, and architects. In some U.S. states, namely California, New York, Oregon, and Nevada, LLPs can only be formed for such professional uses. Formation of an LLP typically requires filing certificates with the county and state offices. Although specific rules vary from state to state, all states have passed variations of the Revised Uniform Partnership Act.

The liability of the partners varies from state to state. Section 306(c) of the Revised Uniform Partnership Act (1997) (RUPA), a standard statute adopted by a majority of the states, grants LLPs a form of limited liability similar to that of a corporation:
An obligation of a partnership incurred while the partnership is a limited liability partnership, whether arising in contract, tort, or otherwise, is solely the obligation of the partnership. A partner is not personally liable, directly or indirectly, by way of contribution or otherwise, for such an obligation solely by reason of being or so acting as a partner.

However, a sizable minority of states only extend such protection against negligence claims, meaning that partners in an LLP can be personally liable for contract and intentional tort claims brought against the LLP. While Tennessee and West Virginia have otherwise adopted RUPA, their respective adoptions of Section 306 depart from the uniform language, and only a partial liability shield is provided.

As in a partnership or Limited liability company (LLC), the profits of a Limited liability partnership (LLP) are allocated among the partners for tax purposes, avoiding the problem of &quot;double taxation&quot; often found in corporations.

Some US states have combined the LP and LLP forms to create limited liability limited partnerships.

Only 58 of the games developed for the system received a North American retail release, with two retail releases being exclusive for PAL territories. However, a few titles only saw release through either digital distribution or bundles that came inside a MMC movie card. In addition, one more game, &quot;Space Impact Evolution X&quot;, came with the system on CD-ROM that was later made available for Symbian S60v2 cell phones.

== Games ==
There are officially released N-Gage games on this list.

In the 2021 Census of Population by Statistics Canada, Port McNeill&#x27;s population was 2,356, living in 1,019 of its 1,111 total private dwellings, higher than its 2016 population of 2,337. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

=== Religion ===
According to the 2021 census, religious groups in Port McNeill included:
*Irreligion (1,545 persons or 65.9%)
*Christianity (730 persons or 31.1%)
*Buddhism (10 persons or 0.4%)

== Tourism and location ==
Along with housing the headquarters of the Regional District of Mount Waddington, Port McNeill is the gateway to the Broughton straight. It offers the only access to the villages of Alert Bay (Cormorant Island) and Sointula (Malcolm Island) via BC Ferries which run daily off Alex&#x27;s Beach. Port McNeill Airport is five minutes to the south on highway 19.

The town is also a popular summer tourism destination. There is a large population of wildlife including black bear, cougar, elk and deer. The town has a museum and a history centred on the area&#x27;s logging history.

== Other information ==
Logging remains the primary employer in Port McNeill, accounting for 25.7% of the labour force and contributing about 8% of the total BC timber harvest. The main contractors are Western Forest Products and LeMare Lake Logging. Port McNeill is also the home to the remains of the world&#x27;s largest burl.

Orca Sand &amp; Gravel LP, the largest sand and gravel quarry in the northern hemisphere, opened here in February 2007. Material is shipped via 70,000 tonne container ships to ports in California and Hawaii and via 7000 tonne barges to Vancouver.

Kwagis Power, owned by Brookfield Renewable Power and the &#x27;Namgis First Nation, built a 45-megawatt hydroelectric facility on the Kokish River near Port McNeill. The Steelhead Society of B.C. and the Western Canada Wilderness Committee opposed the project. The project was finished in early 2014.

Port McNeill is the hometown of Willie Mitchell, a former NHL defenceman, and the birthplace of former NHL defenceman Clayton Stoner. It is also the hometown of Thomas Symons, Canada&#x27;s rookie representation at the 2022 STIHL World Timbersports Championship, which began May 27 in Vienna, Austria.

The first, second and fourth seasons of the History channel television show Alone were filmed in the forest outside Port McNeill. The third season filmed in Patagonia and featured local resident Megan Hanacek.

<text>The Puyallup River ( ) is a river in the U.S. state of Washington. About long, it is formed by glaciers on the west side of Mount Rainier. It flows generally northwest, emptying into Commencement Bay, part of Puget Sound. The river and its tributaries drain an area of about in Pierce County and southern King County.

The lower, northwestern half of the river&#x27;s watershed is a complex amalgam of glacial and tectonic features dating back to the Pleistocene, as well as more recent (Holocene) changes caused by a series of mudslides which flowed down from Mount Rainier between 5,600 and 800 years Before Present. The valley&#x27;s 150,000 residents are at risk from future lahars. For this reason, the United States Geological Survey has installed a lahar warning system.

==Course==
The upper watershed of the Puyallup River flows off of Mount Rainier through the South Cascade Range of Washington towards the lowlands surrounding Puget Sound. The Puyallup River begins from two forks, the North Puyallup River and the South Puyallup River. The North Puyallup River flows from the toe of Puyallup Glacier, while the South Puyallup River flows from Tahoma Glacier. The two streams flow through the western part of Mount Rainier National Park, joining just outside the park boundary and forming the Puyallup River proper, which then flows generally north and northwest until it reaches the edge of the foothills near the town of Electron. A third significant tributary, the Mowich River, flows down from the Edmunds and North Mowich Glaciers, on the northwestern slopes of Mount Rainier, and joins the Puyallup River slightly more than 7.3 kilometers (4.5 miles) northwest of the fork. The river is dammed at Electron Diversion Dam shortly below the Mowich confluence. The dam diverts a portion of the Puyallup River into a long flume, which runs for several miles to Electron, where the water is passed through turbines in a hydroelectric powerhouse before being returned to the river. The Puyallup River passes through a steep and narrow gorge between Electron Dam and the powerhouse.

The main valley flows north from Electron along a lateral meltwater channel (a meltwater channel formed along the edge of a glacier) and into a larger subglacial meltwater channel (formed beneath the glacier), collecting the Carbon River on the way to Alderton and Sumner. At Sumner, the Puyallup River is joined by the White River and the valley splits in two, with the Lower Puyallup River Valley leading west-northwest to Commencement Bay along a fault trace associated with the Tacoma Fault Zone, and the Duwamish Valley continuing north along the purely glacial channel towards Seattle. At present, the Puyallup River follows the Lower Puyallup River Valley northwest past the cities of Puyallup and Fife, and through the Puyallup Indian Reservation, before emptying into Commencement Bay at the Port of Tacoma, part of the city of Tacoma.

==Natural history==
The upper watershed (upstream of Electron) of the Puyallup River was created by the advance of alpine glaciers on Mount Rainier, limiting its maximum possible age to approximately 500,000 years when Mount Rainier was first formed. It is characterized by deep glacial valleys carved through the low mountains and rugged foothills of Washington&#x27;s South Cascade Range.

The lower watershed (downstream of Electron) is much younger than the upper watershed: a combination of glacial and tectonic features less than 20,000 years old as well as changes caused by the Osceola Mudflow and younger lahars between 5,600 years Before Present and today. The main valley was originally part of a much larger lateral meltwater channel network formed during the Vashon Glaciation, which drained large portions of the Puget Sound Area as well as most of Washington&#x27;s Cascade Range south into the Chehalis River prior to the unblocking of the Strait of Juan de Fuca around 14,800 years Before Present. After the retreat of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet allowed Puget Sound to connect with the Pacific Ocean through the Strait, the channel network fragmented into a collection of large, independent river valleys draining into Puget Sound. The Puyallup River&#x27;s portion consisted of small section of lateral meltwater channel between Lake Kapowsin and Orting, a primary subglacial channel running north from Orting through the Duwamish Valley to Lake Washington, and a channel fork which split off at Sumner to follow a tectonic fault associated with the Tacoma Fault Zone.

At the end of the Vashon Glaciation, the majority of the valley in the lower watershed was dry: sea levels were 150 meters (490 feet) lower than they are today, although the land between Tacoma and Electron was also up to 30 meters (100 feet) lower due to the ice sheet&#x27;s weight, and the shore of Puget Sound was likely at or very near Browns Point, almost 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) northwest of its present location. As both sea level and land level recovered from the glaciation, the valley flooded and became a saltwater embayment of Puget Sound which extended through the Puyallup and Duwamish Valleys from Kenmore, Washington, on what is now Lake Washington, to Orting at the foothills of the Cascade Range. Sediment from the Puyallup River, Carbon River, and White River steadily built up in the valley through the early Holocene, and by approximately 5,700 years Before Present the valley was filled in to Sumner, separating the Duwamish Valley from the fork running west-northwest to Tacoma. The Puyallup River split, emptying into Puget Sound to both the north and the west. Starting around 5,600 years Before Present and continuing to 800 years Before Present, a series of large mudslides from Mount Rainier flowed down the Puyallup River and White River watersheds and filled in the Puyallup and Duwamish Valleys, creating the present landscape.

Today, the Puyallup River and its tributaries are still fed by the glaciers of Mount Rainier. These glaciers continually provide sediment such as silt and gravel to the rivers, creating sand and gravel bars. The thick sediment deposits in the stream beds lower water capacity, which causes the river to meander and flood during periods of high streamflow. It also causes the rivers to become braided and meandering. During the summer, glacial meltwater dominates the streamflow, turning the Puyallup River turbid. In addition, the glaciers delay the onset of spring-summer runoff, compared to unglaciated river basins.

Historically, these factors resulted in frequent flooding and extensive floodplain wetlands, and provided a rich and complex habitat for fish and other animals. In addition, the river&#x27;s mouth at Commencement Bay occupied an extensive tidal flat and wetland estuary delta. Urbanization and an extensive system of flood control structures such as dams, levees, and culverts, have radically altered much of the Puyallup River and its tributaries. The estuary delta at the mouth of the Puyallup River has been almost completely replaced with the facilities of the Port of Tacoma, with less than 5% of the original estuarine habitat remaining.

A fall run of chinook salmon occurs on the river. coho, chum, and pink salmon are also found in the river, along with steelhead, sea-run coastal cutthroat trout, and a threatened species, bull trout. Sockeye salmon are considered indigenous to the basin, but are rarely seen today.

==River modifications==

The Puyallup River and its main tributary, the White River, have been subjected to major modifications during the 20th century. The Puyallup River between Sumner and its mouth at Tacoma was straightened. A diversion dam was built at Game Farm Park in 1914 to prevent the White River from flowing on its natural course into the Green River at Auburn; since then it has flowed into the Puyallup River instead of the Green River. Flood protection structures were built along many rivers in the basin, including extensive levees. A flood storage reservoir, Mud Mountain Lake, was created on the White River with the construction of Mud Mountain Dam. As part of the flood control efforts, river channels and embankments have been generally kept clear of debris such as gravel bars, large trees, logjams, and other woody debris. These modifications have radically altered the natural character of the rivers. River widths have been generally reduced. Water now fills nearly all of the land between river banks, instead of the historic pattern of braided meanders and wetlands.

==History==
The river is named for the Puyallup tribe, who lived throughout the river basin. After the Treaty of Medicine Creek and the Puget Sound War the Puyallup were granted a reservation on the lower Puyallup River. The Treaty of Medicine Creek recognized native fishing rights on the Puyallup River. These rights were ignored for decades until Bob Satiacum was arrested in 1954 for fishing illegally on the river. His legal case continued for years and resulted in the 1974 Boldt Decision, which granted half of all fishing rights in Washington state to native tribes.

The Puyallup tribe continues to maintain several buildings and properties on reservation lands near the mouth of the river. They are stakeholders in many issues about the river, such as the amount of water diverted at Electron Diversion Dam.

The first known European to explore the Puyallup River valley was William Fraser Tolmie, who in August 1833 made a journey to the Mount Rainier area via the Puyallup and Mowich river valleys. Two Native American guides accompanied Tolmie, Lachalet, a Nisqually Indian, and Nuckalkat, a Puyallup.

<text>Cyangugu (formerly Shangugu) is a city and capital of the Rusizi District in Western Province, Rwanda. The city lies at the southern end of Lake Kivu, and is contiguous with Bukavu, Democratic Republic of the Congo, but separated from it by the Ruzizi River. Two bridges and a dam cross the river frontier.

The settlement has two main areas: Cyangugu itself is the low-density district on the lake shore, while Kamembe, the higher density industrial and transport centre is further inland and to the north. Kamembe Airport serves the city with flights 11 times a week to Kigali, operated by RwandAir.

The city lies near Nyungwe Forest, a popular tourist destination, being one of the last remaining forest areas of Rwanda and home to chimpanzees and many other species of primate.

In 2022 the city had a population of 43,866.

<text>The Mutants is the fourth serial of the ninth season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which was first broadcast in six weekly parts on BBC1 from 8 April to 13 May 1972.

The serial is set on and high above the Earth colony world Solos in the 30th century. In the serial, the Marshal of Solos (Paul Whitsun-Jones) plots to change Solos&#x27; atmosphere to make it breathable for humans but not for the native Solonians. At the same time, the alien time traveller the Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee) delivers a set of tablets containing lost information about the Solonians&#x27; life cycle to the Solonian Ky (Garrick Hagon).

==Plot==
In the 30th century, the Earth Empire is contracting and plans are made to decolonise the planet of Solos. The militaristic and bigoted Marshal and other human soldiers, known as Overlords, rule it and the disunionised tribal Solonian people from Skybase One, an orbiting space station. The Marshal opposes the decolonisation plans outlined by an Earth Administrator, and is obsessed with eradicating the arthropod-like mutants or &quot;Mutts&quot; developing on the planet. The Solonians are split between those who actively oppose the occupation, and those who collaborate with the Overlords to eradicate the Mutants, believing them to be a disease. The Marshal and one Solonian, Varan, along with his son, all ensure the Administrator is assassinated before he can confirm Solos&#x27; independence. The Third Doctor and Jo arrive on Skybase, the Time Lords having transported the TARDIS there, with a pod which will only open for an intended recipient, which seems to be Ky, another Solonian framed for the Administrator&#x27;s murder. Ky teleports to the planet&#x27;s surface, abducting Jo as well. 

On Solos, daylight-exposed atmosphere is poisonous to humans. With Ky&#x27;s help, Jo survives. The Doctor learns that the Marshal and his chief scientist Jaeger plan to terraform Solos, to make the planet habitable for humans, but not for indigenous life. The Marshal betrays Varan by killing his son. In response, Stubbs and Cotton, the Marshal&#x27;s most senior officers, secretly ally with the Doctor. The now-fugitive Varan takes the Doctor hostage, fleeing to Solos&#x27; caverns, but the Doctor convinces him into a truce. There, they encounter many mutants, but fend them off. The Doctor reunites with Ky and Jo, and gives the pod to Ky. It opens to reveal ancient etched tablets that Ky cannot decipher. Frustrated at the lack of help, Varan stubbornly flees from the group. The Marshal later knowingly fumigates the caves with the Doctor, Jo, Ky, Stubbs, and Cotton still inside, but an outcast human scientist, Sondergaard, a Solonian anthropology expert, saves the group. He also explains his attempt to report the Marshal to Earth Control, but it was intercepted, so Sondergaard fled and hid in fear for his life. The Doctor and Sondergaard interpret the tablets as a lengthy Solonian calendar, and while investigating the caves, also find a mysterious crystal. From the calendar and crystal, the Doctor deduces the Mutant phase is a natural part of the Solonian life-cycle, triggered by Solos&#x27; transition into summer, but the Marshal&#x27;s experiments triggered the mutations too soon.

To look into the strange events, the Earth government has dispatched an Investigator. Despite partly mutating, Varan attacks Skybase with his warriors, with Jo, Ky, Stubbs and Cotton as hostages. It fails, and a hull breach from the fight blows Varan out into space, nearly taking everyone else. The Marshal later sentences summary execution on the remaining four, but are saved by Jaeger&#x27;s timely revelation of the terraform attempt failing and instead poisoning Solos&#x27; environment. Later, the four attempt to escape, while warning the Investigator&#x27;s shuttle, but Stubbs is killed. The Doctor returns to Skybase – without Sondergaard, who was weakened from breathing the sun-exposed portions of Solos&#x27; atmosphere. To force the Doctor to rapidly decontaminate the planet with Skybase&#x27;s technology before the Investigator&#x27;s arrival, the Marshal imprisons Jo and the rest in a soon-to-be-radioactive thaesium refuelling bay. The inquiry is held, but the Marshal gives more lies, supported by the Doctor under duress. Luckily, the prisoners escape their fate and arrive to help the Investigator see the truth of the situation. Sondergaard recovers, discovers the mutants aren&#x27;t animalistic, and also reaches Skybase to offer testimony. Unfortunately, a Mutant follows him and accidentally scares the Investigator enough to reinstate the Marshal&#x27;s command and recommendation to eradicate the creatures.

Escaping from the guards, the Doctor quickly studies the crystal in the Skybase laboratory, confirming that it focuses and converts thaesium radiation from the deposits deep in the caves, beneficially accelerating the mutation process. The Marshal, now unbalanced from thoughts of ruling grandeur, forces Sondergaard (to whom the Doctor secretly gives the crystal), Jo, Cotton, and Ky back into the refuelling bay. There, Sondergaard gives a severely weakened Ky the crystal, who then absorbs all of the thaesium fuel and rapidly mutates, emerging as a radiant angel-like super-being and saving the prisoners. Meanwhile, the Marshal holds the Investigator&#x27;s entourage hostage to be the first forced citizens of New Earth (on Solos), and orders the terraforming completed, but the Doctor covertly sabotages the terraformer&#x27;s circuits, which overloads when Jaeger tries to operate it, killing him. Furious at his lost chance of domination, The Marshal takes aim at the Doctor, but Ky arrives and dispenses justice, vapourising the Marshal. Sondergaard and Cotton elect to stay to help see the other Solonians through their mutations, while Jo and the Doctor slip away, their mission from the Time Lords complete.

==Production==
Working titles for this story included &quot;Independence&quot; and &quot;The Emergents&quot;. Writers Bob Baker and Dave Martin, as well as producer Barry Letts, intended for &quot;The Mutants&quot; to have an anti-racist message. The basis of the story came from Letts, who had submitted the idea for Season 4 but it was rejected by script editor Gerry Davis for the 1966 story &quot;The Mutant&quot;. Martin was highly concerned about the &quot;Apartheid&quot; system in South Africa, which was reflected in the script. The story of &quot;The Mutants&quot; was intended to be a metaphor for South Africa with the Earth Empire standing for the white supremacist government of South Africa and the Solonians for the black population of South Africa. Martin had become fascinated with South Africa after an incident where his neighbor in Bristol had told him that he was moving to South Africa &quot;to be a kind of master&quot; over non-white people, leading him to learn about the &quot;apartheid&quot; system, which led him to become active in the anti-apartheid movement.

The way that Solos descends into chaos on the verge of independence was inspired by the bloody riots that erupted during the partition of India in 1947 as the British colony of India was divided into the new nations of Pakistan and India. Over a million people killed during the partition of India with the violence being especially vicious in the Punjab. The script editor, Terrance Dicks, had long wanted to do a story that would be an analogy for the end of the British empire, and worked extensively on the script by Martin and Baker in late 1971. Dicks was opposed to the anti-imperialist views of Martin and Baker as he recalled: &quot;They [Baker and Martin] wanted to do something on the evils of Empire, which I didn&#x27;t necessarily agree with because I was rather pro-British Empire. My view was and I suppose still is to a some extent is that it would had been a lot better if it was still there, you know. If you have a look at Africa or Asia or the rest of the world if the Brits were still in charge, it would all be running smoothly.&quot; Dicks softened the anti-imperialist theme of the original script. but Martin and Baker were able to hold onto to their primary message. The Doctor&#x27;s remarks about a &quot;crumbled&quot; empire which can not longer afford the costs of the imperial project are about the Earth Empire in the 30th century, but could have just as easily have been about the British empire circa 1972. Initially, the term used for the mutants of Solos was to be &quot;munt&quot; (an abbreviation for &quot;mutant native&quot;), which was a real derogatory term used by South African whites to describe South African blacks. The term was changed to &quot;mutt&quot; in the final script because &quot;munt&quot; sounds similar to &quot;cunt&quot;.

The bombastic crazed militarist, the Marshal, was based upon Benito Mussolini. That the Marshal is opposed to Solos being granted independence as he wishes to displace the native population of Solos in order to make way for colonists from Earth was a reference to Rhodesia. The Marshal is so determined to hang onto Solos as a colony that he assassinates the Administrator sent out from Earth to grant independence to Solos. In 1965, Ian Smith, the prime minister of the self-governing British colony of Southern Rhodesia (modern Zimbabwe) whose franchise was restricted to white settlers illegally declared unilateral independence rather than accept British plans to grant Southern Rhodesia independence on the basis of majority rule. The way the Marshal tries to keep the imperial project going in defiance of his own empire&#x27;s wish to give up Solos in order to colonise it with millions of settlers from Earth was based on Rhodesia. The British critics Maura Grady and Celcia Hemstrom note that both the Administrator and the Marshal are caught up in imperial nostalgia as the Marshal wishes to turn Solos into a &quot;new Earth&quot; that will be colonised by settlers from Earth while the Administrator complains that Earth is now a toxic wasteland and the Earth Empire is economically &quot;finished&quot; owing to its ruined environment. The amoral German-accented scientist, Professor Jaeger, whose experiments are intended to exterminate the native population of Solos was based upon those German scientists who served the Nazi regime in devising every more efficient methods of killing people. The more benevolent scientist, Professor Sondergaard, is dressed in a hippie style, which seems to reflect some approval of hippies by the writers. The way that the Earth in the story was portrayed in the 30th century as being so hopelessly polluted as to be toxic for human beings to live in was an environmentalist message about what the future of humanity would be if measures were not taken to save the environment in the 20th century.

The opening shot of the story features a bedraggled, hermit-like bearded figure (Sidney Johnson) shambling out of the mist towards the camera. Both fans and Jon Pertwee alike have compared the scene to the &quot;It&#x27;s&quot; man at the start of most episodes of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;.

The mines of Solos were filmed at Chislehurst Caves near Bromley. They also filmed at Bluewater Quarry which was the setting for the planet Solos, before it was a shopping centre and Stone House Farm Caves which was the entrance to Solos caves.

==Broadcast and reception==
In 2009, Patrick Mulkern of &quot;Radio Times&quot; stated that the serial was &quot;peculiarly variable&quot;, with uneven performances and quality; he wrote that &quot;the first episode is surprisingly leaden and unengaging, whereas episode four is one of the most stimulating and creatively innovative under Barry Letts&#x27; stewardship&quot;. He praised the design of the Mutants and some of the cliffhangers. DVD Talk&#x27;s John Sinnott gave the story two and a half out of five stars, calling it &quot;terribly average&quot; but &quot;a solid adventure ... worth watching&quot;. He was critical of the acting, especially Rick James, and felt that overall it was too long and &quot;a bit convoluted&quot;. IGN reviewer Arnold T. Blumburg gave the story a score of 7 out of 10, writing that there was more to be appreciated as an adult to see &quot;its role as a hard-edged indictment of the culture in which it was created&quot;. Ian Berriman of &quot;SFX&quot; gave &quot;The Mutants&quot; three out of five stars, noting its ambition to tackle social issues but concluded that the execution was &quot;bungled&quot;.

The British critics Maura Grady and Cecilia Hemstrom praised &quot;The Mutants&quot; was one of the stronger anti-imperialist stories in &quot;Dr. Who&quot;. Grady and Hemstrom noted in the story the environment of the Earth in the 30th century has been ruined by centuries of pollution, turning the entire Earth into a monstrous toxic wasteland, which has led to humans colonising other planets to replace the ruined Earth with no thought for any of the natives of those planets. Grady and Hemstrom further noted that the colonists from Earth have not only set about ruining the environment of Solos in the same manner that they ruined the Earth, but also destroyed the culture of the Solonians to such an extent that the Solonians can no longer read their ancient hieroglyphs. Cut off from their culture and history, the Solonians are thus are unaware of their 500-year life cycle. Neither the Solonians nor the humans can understand that the mass mutations are merely part of the natural 500-year life cycle of the Solonians, and the humans react to a development that they do not understand by embarking on a genocide of the Solonians. Grady and Hemstron concluded that it not been for the colonialism the Solonians would have completed their life cycle without incident and that: &quot;The episode is a fair warning that, no matter how well intended, interference with indigenous cultures can have dangerous and far-reaching consequences&quot;.

<text>A buzzer or beeper is an audio signaling device, which may be mechanical, electromechanical, or piezoelectric (&quot;piezo&quot; for short). Typical uses of buzzers and beepers include alarm devices, timers, train and confirmation of user input such as a mouse click or keystroke.

== History ==

=== Electromechanical ===
The electric buzzer was invented in 1831 by Joseph Henry. They were mainly used in early doorbells until they were phased out in the early 1930s in favor of musical chimes, which had a softer tone.

=== Piezoelectric ===

Piezoelectric buzzers, or piezo buzzers, as they are sometimes called, were invented by Japanese manufacturers and fitted into a wide array of products during the 1970s to 1980s. This advancement mainly came about because of cooperative efforts by Japanese manufacturing companies. In 1951, they established the Barium Titanate Application Research Committee, which allowed the companies to be &quot;competitively cooperative&quot; and bring about several piezoelectric innovations and inventions.

== Types ==

===Electromechanical===
Early devices were based on an electromechanical system identical to an electric bell without the metal gong. Similarly, a relay may be connected to interrupt its own actuating current, causing the contacts to buzz (the contacts buzz at line frequency if powered by alternating current) Often these units were anchored to a wall or ceiling to use it as a sounding board. The word &quot;buzzer&quot; comes from the rasping noise that electromechanical buzzers made.

===Mechanical===
A joy buzzer is an example of a purely mechanical buzzer and they require drivers. Other examples of them are doorbells.

===Piezoelectric===

A piezoelectric element may be driven by an oscillating electronic circuit or other audio signal source, driven with a piezoelectric audio amplifier. Sounds commonly used to indicate that a button has been pressed are a click, a ring or a beep.

A piezoelectric buzzer/beeper also depends on acoustic cavity resonance or Helmholtz resonance to produce an audible beep.

==Modern applications==
While technological advancements have caused buzzers to be impractical and undesirable, there are still instances in which buzzers and similar circuits may be used. Present day applications include:
* Novelty uses
* Judging panels
* Educational purposes
* Annunciator panels
* Electronic metronomes
* Game show lock-out device
* Microwave ovens and other household appliances
* Sporting events such as basketball games
* Electrical alarms
* Joy buzzer (mechanical buzzer used for pranks)

* Alarm management
* Klaxon
* Vibrator (mechanical)
* Joy buzzers
* UVB-76, a Russian radio station that emits a characteristic buzzing sound and is also called The Buzzer.

<doc id="662467" wikidata="Q27075669" url="?curid=662467" title="Indian blue robin">
<text>The Indian blue robin (Larvivora brunnea) is a small bird found in the Indian Subcontinent. Formerly considered a thrush, it is now considered one of the Old World flycatchers in the family Muscicapidae. It was earlier also called the Indian blue chat. It is migratory, breeding in the forests along the Himalayas of Nepal, India, Myanmar and Bangladesh. They winter in the hill forests of the Western Ghats of India and in Sri Lanka.

==Taxonomy==
The Indian blue robin was described by Hodgson who placed it in a new genus &quot;Larvivora&quot; but it was later placed in the genus &quot;Luscinia&quot;. A large-sample molecular phylogenetic study published in 2010 found that &quot;Luscinia&quot; was not monophyletic. The genus was therefore split and several species including Indian blue robin were moved to the reinstated genus &quot;Larvivora&quot;. &quot;Larvivora&quot; is a sister of the species &quot;Brachypteryx cruralis&quot;, &quot;Brachypteryx leucophrys&quot; and &quot;Brachypteryx hyperythra&quot;.

==Description==
The Indian blue robin is similar in size to the related bluethroat at 15 cm long. The adult male has blue upperparts and rufous underparts. A bright white supercilium contrasts with a black mask that continues down the neck. The lower belly and undertail are also whitish. The female is olive brown above and buff below with a light eye-ring and rufescent rump. The breast and flanks are buffy.

Young birds are dark brown with buff spots.

==Distribution==
The nominate race breeds from Eastern Afghanistan to the eastern Himalayas. Race &quot;wickhami&quot; (Stuart Baker, 1916) breeds in the Chin Hills of western Myanmar and is said to be non-migratory.

==Behaviour and ecology==

The Indian blue robin is insectivorous and feeds mainly on the ground. It skulks in undergrowth and hops on the ground, frequently flicking and fanning its tail. The breeding season is May to July and the nest is a large cup of vegetation placed on the ground between the roots of large fir tree or in depression. The nest is lined with roots, hair and down. The usual clutch is 4 light blue eggs. Only the female is believed to incubate but both sexes take part feeding the young. The cuckoo &quot;Cuculus canorus&quot; has been recorded in old literature as a brood parasite of the species.

These birds arrive in the Himalayan breeding grounds in May and leave in September. Southward migration begins in August. During the migratory season they may be found as passage migrants all over peninsular India. In winter they are found mainly in the hill forests of southern India, the Western Ghats and in Sri Lanka. They arrive in mid-September and leave the winter quarters in mid-April. Males appeared to be commoner than females in a survey conducted in the Nilgiris suggesting either differences in the timing of migration of males and females or variation in wintering areas. At Point Calimere they have been regularly trapped during October and November on their return migration from Sri Lanka but rarely on the southward migration with suggestions that they may follow different routes.

The habitat in which they are found is usually dense and dark forest with undergrowth and leaf litter. They sing and call in their winter grounds. The song consists of a sudden and sharp series of whistles ending in a rapid series of notes. They also utter a sharp and low clicking alarm note.

<doc id="662478" wikidata="Q170873" url="?curid=662478" title="Franconia–Springfield station">
<text>Franconia–Springfield station is a Washington Metro rapid transit station and Virginia Railway Express commuter rail station located in Springfield, Virginia, United States. The station is the southwestern terminus of the Metro Blue Line and an intermediate station on the VRE Fredericksburg Line. It is also a major bus terminal for Fairfax Connector buses, plus other local and intercity bus routes. The station has one island platform serving the two Metro tracks, plus two side platforms serving the RF&amp;P Subdivision on which the Fredericksburg Line runs.

Located in a suburban area near I-95, the station is primarily used by commuters from more distant suburbs. Its parking garage is the largest on the Metro system, with 5,069 spaces. With an average of 2,491 daily riders in 2023, Franconia–Springfield was the 41st-busiest Metro station and the ninth-busiest in Virginia.

The VRE stop opened in 1995, followed by the Metro station on June 29, 1997. From 2003 to 2010, the station was also served by Amtrak &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; intercity rail trains.

==History==
Prior to construction by WMATA, Franconia–Springfield station was the site of Franconia Station, a standard railroad station built by the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad. It was built in 1870 and demolished in 1952. Original Metro plans called for separate stations for Franconia and Springfield, but before 1979 – due to the expense and complications of running separate branches – plans had changed to combine the two stations into one. In 1979 the &quot;Franconia&quot; station was renamed &quot;Franconia–Springfield&quot;.

In 1981, WMATA held a series of public hearings to discuss issues related to the expansion of the then Yellow Line to Springfield by 1986, although the project was unfunded at that time. By 1987, the Northern Virginia Transportation Commission began to evaluate whether or not state funding would be necessary to complete the station as federal funding was not guaranteed at that time. By 1991, funding for the expansion was secured and plans for the station, parking garage, and other commuter facilities were approved by the Metro board.

The VRE platform opened in 1995, the second infill station on the system. The Metrorail station opened on June 29, 1997; its opening coincided with the completion of of rail west of the Van Dorn Street station. The final cost for both the station and rail expansion was $175 million.

On October 10, 2003, due to increases in ridership on both the Metro and VRE lines, WMATA opened an additional parking garage on the premises for park-and-ride users, offering an additional 1,000 parking spaces, and bringing the total to 5,100 spaces.

On June 25, 2017, Yellow Line trains stopped serving the station due to the elimination of Rush+, which is part of major changes to the Metrorail system.

In May 2018, Metro announced an extensive renovation of platforms at twenty stations across the system. The Blue and Yellow Lines south of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport station, including the Franconia–Springfield station, would be closed from May to September 2019.

Between September 10 and November 5, 2022, Franconia–Springfield was closed due to the Potomac Yard station tie-in, closing all stations south of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport station. Shuttle buses were provided throughout the shutdown.

==Station layout==

Access to the station is provided by an elevated walkway connecting the parking garage and bus bays to the platforms. Blue Line trains stop at an island platform below the elevated walkway, with fare control on the same level as the walkway. VRE trains stop at two side platforms adjacent to the Metro tracks.

<doc id="662480" wikidata="Q4260226" url="?curid=662480" title="John Charles Daly">
<text>John Charles Patrick Croghan Daly (February 20, 1914 – February 24, 1991) was an American journalist, host, CBS radio and television personality, ABC News executive, TV anchor, and game show host, best known for his work on the CBS panel game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;

Daly was the first national correspondent to report the attack on Pearl Harbor and the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt. During World War II, Daly covered front-line news from Europe and North Africa.

==Early life==
Daly was born in Johannesburg, South Africa in 1914, where his father was working as a geologist; after his father died of tropical fever, Daly&#x27;s mother moved the family to Boston, Massachusetts. At that time, John was 11 years old, and attended the Tilton School, where he later served on the board of directors for many years, contributing to the construction or restoration of many buildings on campus. He did his post-secondary education at a junior college and graduated from Boston College. Daly worked for a time in a wool factory, and at a transit company in Washington, D.C., before becoming a reporter for NBC Radio, and later for CBS.

==Career==
===Radio===
Daly began his broadcasting career as a reporter for NBC Radio and then WJSV, the local CBS Radio Network affiliate in Washington, D.C., as CBS&#x27; White House correspondent. He appears on the famous &quot;One Day in Radio&quot; tapes of September 21, 1939, in which WJSV preserved its entire broadcast day for posterity. In this presentation, Daly has a mid-morning show as a man-on-the-street reporter asking quiz questions of passersby.

While covering the Roosevelt White House, Daly became known to the national CBS audience as the network announcer for many of the President&#x27;s speeches. In late 1941, Daly transferred to New York City, where he became anchor of &quot;The World Today&quot;. During World War II, he covered the news from London as well as the North African and Italian fronts. Daly was a war correspondent in 1943 in Italy during Gen. George S. Patton&#x27;s infamous &quot;slapping incidents.&quot; After the war, he was a lead reporter on CBS Radio&#x27;s news/entertainment program &quot;CBS Is There&quot; (later revived for television as the Walter Cronkite-hosted series &quot;You Are There&quot;), which recreated the great events of history as if CBS correspondents were on the scene.

====Notable broadcasts====
As a reporter for the CBS radio network, Daly was the voice of two historic announcements. He was the first national correspondent to deliver the news of the attack on Pearl Harbor on Sunday, December 7, 1941, and he was also the first to relay the wire service report of the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt on April 12, 1945, interrupting the program &quot;Wilderness Road&quot; to deliver the news. Those bulletins have been preserved on historical record album retrospectives and radio and television documentaries. 

In July 1959, along with the Associated Press writer John Scali, Daly reported from Moscow on the infamous Kitchen Debate between First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev and Vice President Richard M. Nixon.

===Television===
Daly&#x27;s first foray into television was as a panelist on the game show &quot;Celebrity Time&quot;. This led to a job in 1950 as the host and moderator on a new panel show produced by Goodson–Todman, &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; The show lasted 17 years, with Daly hosting all but four episodes of the weekly series.

Each &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; panelist introduced the next in line at the start of the show. On Fred Allen&#x27;s death in 1956, Random House book publisher and humorist Bennett Cerf became the anchor panelist who would usually introduce Daly. Cerf usually prefaced his introduction with a pun or joke that over time became a pun or joke at Daly&#x27;s expense. Daly would then often fire back his own retort. Cerf and Daly enjoyed a friendly feud from across the stage for the remainder of the history of the program. The mystery guest on the final CBS program (aired September 3, 1967) was Daly himself. Daly had received many letters over the years asking him to fill that role; until the finale he never could, because Daly served as the &quot;emergency mystery guest&quot; in case the scheduled celebrity failed to show on the live program.

According to producer Gil Fates, Daly was resistant to changes that would have diminished the show&#x27;s dignity. Daly insisted on a formal procedure; for example, he addressed the panelists as &quot;Miss&quot; or &quot;Mister&quot;, and both Daly and the panelists always wore formal attire in keeping with the moderator&#x27;s scholarly bearing. Toward the end of the network run, in the mid-1960s, Fates broached the idea of expanding the usual format to include playful, on-stage demonstrations of the contestants&#x27; products or services, for the sake of variety, only to be met with Daly&#x27;s &quot;Look, kiddo. If you want to do stuff like this, do it on &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret.&quot;&quot; The producers, Fates said, were unable to challenge Daly for fear of losing him as the show&#x27;s moderator, and the format remained sedentary with Daly presiding from his desk. Only after Daly&#x27;s departure was Fates able to expand the format, when the retooled &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; was revived for syndication in 1968.

The series spawned a brief radio version in 1952, also hosted by Daly. The series also inspired a multitude of concurrent international versions and a syndicated U.S. revival in 1968 in which Daly did not participate. He was a vice president at ABC during the 1950s. He did hosting duties on &quot;Who Said That?&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s News to Me&quot;, &quot;We Take Your Word&quot;, and &quot;Open Hearing.&quot; Daly was a narrator on &quot;The Voice of Firestone&quot; starting in 1958.
He also had several television and movie guest appearances from the late 1940s to the mid-1960s, including an uncredited role in &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; (as the reporter announcing the title character&#x27;s induction into the Army) and as the narrator, in a mock documentary style, on the premiere episode of the rural comedy series &quot;Green Acres&quot;. In 1949 he starred in the short-lived CBS Television newspaper drama &quot;The Front Page&quot;, where it was thought that his presence and journalistic experience would give the series more authenticity.

During the 1950s, Daly became the vice president in charge of news, special events, and public affairs, religious programs and sports for ABC and won three Peabody Awards. From 1953 to 1960, he anchored &quot;John Daly and the News&quot; each weeknight and other ABC News broadcasts and was the face of the network&#x27;s news division, even though &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; was then on competing CBS. In addition, he provided the voice of a Conelrad radio announcer on the May 18, 1954, broadcast of The Motorola Television Hour on ABC titled &quot;Atomic Attack&quot;, which showcases a story about a family in a New York City suburb dealing with the aftermath of an H-bomb attack fifty miles away. At the time, this was a very rare instance of a television personality working on two different US broadcast TV networks simultaneously. (Daly did not work for CBS but for the producers of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, Goodson-Todman Productions. He also filled in occasionally on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Today Show&quot;, making Daly one of the few people to work simultaneously on all &quot;three&quot; networks.)

One of his most memorable days as host of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today Show&quot; was when Harpo Marx was a guest promoting his book &quot;Harpo Speaks&quot;. Marx caused chaos on-camera for Daly. Daly became completely convulsed in laughter during the live telecast on the NBC network.

In addition to the Harpo Marx segment and most of the live telecasts of “What’s My Line?” preserved via kinescope, at least a few of Daly&#x27;s 15-minute live newscasts for the ABC network survive.

Daly&#x27;s closing line on the ABC newscasts was &quot;Good night, and a good tomorrow.&quot; He resigned from ABC on November 16, 1960, after the network preempted the first hour of 1960 presidential election night coverage to show Bugs Bunny cartoons and &quot;The Rifleman&quot; from 7:30 to 8:30 pm while CBS and NBC were covering returns from the Kennedy–Nixon presidential election and other important vote counts. Daly stated that &quot;the last straw&quot; that led to his resignation was the decision of the then-president of ABC, Leonard Goldenson, to bring in Time Inc. to co-produce documentaries that had previously been under Daly&#x27;s direction for the network.

In May 1967, during the final year of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, it was announced that Daly would become the director of the Voice of America after the show ended. He assumed the position on September 20, 1967, but lasted only until June 6, 1968, when he resigned over a claim that Leonard H. Marks, his superior at the U.S. Information Agency, had been making personnel changes behind Daly&#x27;s back.
From December 1968 to January 1969, Daly hosted the arts and humanities program &quot;Critique&quot; on NET. Funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Old Dominion Foundation (later the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation), and the Louis Calder Foundation (paper industry leader), “Critique” was originally scheduled for 26 weekly programs. However, Daly resigned after only five programs because the producing station of the program, Newark, New Jersey-licensed WNDT, declined to delete a remark by WCBS radio reporter David Goldman that Daly considered obscene from a taped program in the series titled &quot;Huui, Huui,&quot; an opening production of the New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater. The most notable and last guest on a &quot;Critique&quot; program hosted by Daly was Bronx-born singer/songwriter/pianist Laura Nyro, probably recorded on December 4, 1968, and originally broadcast on January 1, 1969, in which she performed demos of &quot;And When I Die,&quot; &quot;The Man Who Sends Me Home,&quot; &quot;Captain Saint Lucifer,&quot; &quot;Mercy on Broadway,&quot; &quot;You Don&#x27;t Love Me When I Cry,&quot; and &quot;Save the Country,&quot; and also featured an interview with her manager David Geffen. Following Daly&#x27;s resignation, only one more episode of &quot;Critique&quot; was produced and broadcast, an April 1969 episode featuring The Doors as the musical guests.

Daly did not host the syndicated version of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, although he did co-host a 25th-anniversary program about the show for ABC in 1975. Daly was a member of the Peabody Awards Board of Jurors from 1966 to 1982. He spent most of the 1980s as a frequent forum moderator for the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.

==Tilton School==
At his alma mater, the Tilton School, there is an award named for Daly given to &quot;persons whose pursuit of excellence and deep commitment as a member of the school family resembles that of John Daly&#x27;s involvement with Tilton: continuous and widely known expressions of support in word and deed, inspiring others to reach goals that common experience dictates are impossible.&quot;
Every year during Alumni Weekend Tilton School recognizes outstanding alumni during School Meeting on Saturday. Four awards for consideration are Alumnus of the Year, George L. Plimpton Award, John Charles Daly Award, and Artist Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
He married twice, first to Margaret Criswell Neal (1913–1967) in January 1937. The marriage resulted in two sons, John Neal Daly and John Charles Daly III, and a daughter, Helene Grant &quot;Bunsy&quot; Daly. It ended in divorce in April 1959.

On December 22, 1960, Daly married Virginia Warren (1928-2009), daughter of then–chief justice Earl Warren, at Glide Memorial Church in San Francisco. They were married for more than 30 years, until Daly&#x27;s death. Their marriage yielded three children: John Warren Daly, John Earl Jameson Daly, and Nina Elisabeth Daly.

===Death===
Daly died of cardiac arrest at his home in Chevy Chase, Maryland, on February 24, 1991, at the age of 77. His widow, Virginia Warren Daly, died on February 19, 2009, at the age of 80.

<text>Commencement Bay is a bay of Puget Sound in the U.S. state of Washington. The city of Tacoma is located on the bay, with the Port of Tacoma occupying the southeastern end. A line drawn from Point Defiance in the southwest to Browns Point in the northeast serves to mark the generally accepted division between the bay and the open sound. Commencement Bay has become home to one of the most active commercial ports in the world. The Port of Tacoma is the main port facility.

The Puyallup River is the largest freshwater stream emptying into the bay. Others include Ruston Creek, Mason Creek, Asarco Creek, Puget Creek, Hylebos Creek, and Wapato Creek.

==History==


Lieutenant Charles Wilkes of the United States Exploring Expedition 
named Commencement Bay in 1841, commemorating the place where he started his survey of southern Puget Sound.

The first Euro-American habitation on Commencement Bay was by Swede Nicolas Delin (b. ca. 1817). He built a water-powered sawmill in 1852 where a creek entered the head of the bay. A small community grew up around the operation, but the settlers evacuated during the Puget Sound War of 1855–56 and did not return.

In 1873 the Northern Pacific Railway, the first transcontinental railroad in the northern United States, announced it would locate its terminus at Commencement Bay. When the railroad reached the bay in 1883 it caused a boom of development in Tacoma. The railroad facilities were located near the extensive tide flats by the mouth of the Puyallup River, about a mile from the original site of Tacoma. Not only did the tide flats provide level ground compared to the steep slopes surrounding the rest of the bay, but dredging work would quickly provide deep water access to the railyards and warehouses. A new town, called New Tacoma, quickly grew up by the railroad hub. &quot;Old town&quot; Tacoma and New Tacoma soon merged. Large land grants were provided to the Northern Pacific, including a significant part of the coast of Commencement Bay. Over time the city of Tacoma bought up this land.

Originally the boundary between Pierce and King counties ran east from the mouth of the Puyallup River, splitting Commencement Bay between the two counties. In 1901 the border was changed, giving Pierce County the entire bay.

&quot;Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding&quot; operated out of the bay during World War 2 producing escort carriers and auxiliaries as one of the yards belonging to the Todd Corporation, which included a nearby yard on Harbor Island, Seattle.

==Environmental issues==
For much of the 20th century a large smelting facility was operated by ASARCO on the shore of Commencement Bay near Point Defiance. The town of Ruston surrounds the former ASARCO plant. Tailing waste was dumped into the bay, eventually forming a long peninsula. Today it is a project area within the Commencement Bay Superfund site.

The Thea Foss Waterway, an arm of Commencement Bay near downtown Tacoma, was declared a Superfund site in 1983. In 1991, the Environmental Protection Agency announced that the St. Paul Waterway, once among the most contaminated parts of Commencement Bay, had been the first marine Superfund site in the nation to be cleansed of pollution.

It awarded its annual Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide Fan Awards from 1983 to circa 2010. The publication ceased with the March 2013 issue. The magazine was headquartered in Iola, Wisconsin, after originally being published in the Quad Cities region.

==History==
===Alan Light years: 1971–1983===
&quot;CBG&quot; was founded in February 1971 by Alan Light under the title The Buyer&#x27;s Guide for Comic Fandom (TBG) as a monthly newspaper in a tabloid format. &quot;TBG&quot; began primarily as an advertising venue – known in comics fandom as an &quot;adzine&quot;, i.e. a fanzine devoted to ads. Ron Frantz, in his book &quot;Fandom: Confidential&quot;, traces the lineage of Light&#x27;s endeavor to &quot;Stan&#x27;s Weekly Express&quot; (aka &quot;WE&quot;), a pioneering adzine published from 1969 to 1973, whose bare-bones approach was inspired by an &quot;obscure journal of flower advertising known as &quot;Joe&#x27;s Bulletin&quot;&quot;. Frantz also provides background on Light&#x27;s interaction with the WE Seal of approval program, with which he cooperated in order to help combat mail fraud. Frantz in addition describes the infamous long-running feud between Light and &quot;Comics Journal&quot; founder Gary Groth. 

&quot;TBG&quot;&#x27;s frequency was changed to twice-monthly with issue #18 (August 1, 1972). Besides occasional letter columns, beginning with issue #19 (Aug. 15, 1972), prominent fans Don and Maggie Thompson began a monthly column, &quot;Beautiful Balloons.&quot; A news column, &quot;What Now?&quot; by Murray Bishoff, was added with #26 (Dec. 1, 1972). These provided the editorial content required by the United States Postal Service to qualify for second class mail (along with paid subscriptions being instituted with issue #27, January 1, 1973). At this time, &quot;TBG&quot;&#x27;s circulation was about 3,600 copies.

&quot;TBG&quot; went weekly with issue #86 (July 18, 1975). In 1977, &quot;TBG&quot;&#x27;s circulation topped 10,000. Cat Yronwode succeeded Bishoff as news reporter with issue #329 (March 7, 1980), renaming the column &quot;Fit to Print&quot;.

=== Krause Publications years: 1983–2002===
In 1983, &quot;The Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot; was purchased by Krause Publications. Columnists Don and Maggie Thompson were hired as editors. Krause changed the name with their first issue #482 (February 11, 1983) to Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide. At that time Krause instituted the controversial CBG Customer Service Award, the display of which signifies an advertiser had a &quot;clean bill of health&quot;. By the late 1980s, the publication had more than 20,000 subscribers.

Writer Peter David&#x27;s column, &quot;But I Digress...&quot;, joined the publication in 1990. The magazine added Mark Evanier&#x27;s column &quot;P.O.V.&quot; in late 1994.

In 1992, the magazine spun off its distributor and retailer news into a separate periodical, &quot;Comics &amp; Games Retailer&quot; (which ceased publication in 2007). Co-editor Don Thompson died on May 23, 1994. In 1998, Krause brought on John Jackson Miller as managing editor and Brent Frankenhoff as projects editor, with Maggie Thompson remaining as editor.

&quot;CBG&quot; was named Best Comics Publication in the 1985 Kirby Awards, and it was given the Eisner Award for Best Comics-Related Periodical/Publication in 1992 and 1993.

In July 2002, Krause was acquired by F+W Publications.

===F+W Publications years: 2002–2013===
With issue #1595 (June 2004), &quot;CBG&quot; changed its format from a weekly tabloid to a monthly perfect bound magazine. In addition, in hopes of enhancing newsstand sales, &quot;CBG&quot; added a price guide for contemporary comics as well as other new features intended to make the magazine more appealing to those with an avid interest in comic books as an investment. This marketing strategy was also tied to the yearly publication of the &quot;Standard Catalog of Comic Books&quot;, produced in conjunction with Human Computing, the makers of the comic collectors’ software ComicBase.

In July 2005, the magazine began archiving past features at its CBGXtra.com service. Brett Frankenhoff was promoted to &quot;CBG&quot; Editor in 2006, with Maggie Thompson assuming the title of Senior Editor. In late 2009, &quot;CBG&quot;&#x27;s page count was reduced, the perfect binding ended, and some of the features changed, including the removal of the price guide listings.

==== Cancelation and legacy ====
On January 9, 2013, Krause Publications announced the cancellation of &quot;Comics Buyer’s Guide&quot; effective with issue #1699 (March 2013). The website CBGXtra and its Facebook page continued as archived resources for a time but are no longer online, replaced by the website of the new owner &quot;Antique Trader&quot;. 

&quot;Alter Ego&quot; #122 (Jan. 2014) was a tribute issue devoted to &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot;, with features regarding what would have made the 1700th &quot;CBG&quot; issue if the magazine had continued.

A complete collection of &quot;TBG&quot;/&quot;CBG&quot; is held by the Michigan State University Comic Art Collection.

== Columnists ==
&quot;CBG&quot; hosted many columns over the years in addition to Don and Maggie Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Beautiful Balloons&quot;, Murray Bishoff&#x27;s &quot;What Now?&quot;, and Cat Yronwode&#x27;s &quot;Fit to Print&quot;. With issue #25 (Nov. 15, 1972) Martin L. Greim, publisher of the fanzine &quot;The Comic Crusader&quot;, began to contribute an occasional column initially titled &quot;M. L. G. on Comics&quot;, that later would be known as &quot;Crusader Comments&quot;. With issue #162 in 1976 Shel Dorf began an occasional series &quot;Shel Dorf and the Fantasy Makers&quot; interviewing creators in comics, television and film. Another columnist in the 1970s was David Scroggy.

Another column was Robert Ingersoll&#x27;s &quot;The Law is A Ass!&quot;. The column dealt with how comics writers erred in their depiction of the law, and what Ingersoll thought they should have done. It also dealt with procedural errors.

In the &quot;CBG&quot; era, the magazine has been noted for its letter column &quot;Oh, So?&quot;, as well as columns by Peter David, Tony Isabella, Catherine Yronwode, Rick Norwood, Mark Evanier, John Jackson Miller, Bob Ingersoll, Heidi MacDonald, Rik Offenberger, Chuck Rozanski (&quot;Tales from the Database&quot;), Craig Shutt, Beau Smith, Andrew Smith, and others. As part of the June 2004 switch to monthly publication, Maggie Thompson revived the &quot;Beautiful Balloons&quot; column.

== Cartoons and strips ==
Cartoonists whose work appeared in &quot;CBG&quot; include Marc Hansen, Chuck Fiala, Jim Engel, Dan Vebber, Fred Hembeck, Mark Engblom, Brian Douglas Ahern, Chris Smigliano, Mark Martin, Batton Lash, Brian Hayes, and others. For some years &quot;CBG&quot; reprinted installments of The Spirit comic strip by Will Eisner. The panel cartoon &quot;Last Kiss&quot; by John Lustig was also among the longtime fixtures. Professional comic book artists such as Jack Kirby, C.C. Beck and Alex Toth, as well as otherwise-unknown fan artists, regularly contributed covers along with headers and spot illustrations to the &quot;Beautiful Balloons&quot; and &quot;Fit to Print&quot; columns.

== Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide Fan Awards ==
&quot;CBG&quot; administered the annual Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide Fan Awards from 1983 to circa 2010, with the first awards announced in issue #500 (June 17, 1983).

Upon taking over as &quot;CBG&quot; editors, Don and Maggie Thompson aspired to bring back a series of comic book fan awards like the Goethe Awards, which they had administered in the first half of the 1970s. (The Goethe Award — later known as the Comic Fan Art Award — originated with the Thompsons&#x27; fanzine &quot;Newfangles&quot; and then shared close ties with &quot;The Buyer&#x27;s Guide to Comics Fandom&quot;. Perhaps not coincidentally, &quot;TBG&quot; was given the Goethe Award for Favorite Fanzine in 1972.)

The format and balloting of the CBG Fan Awards were in many ways derived from the Goethe Award/Comic Fan Art Award. The awards were initially voted on by &quot;CBG&quot; subscribers; the voting was later opened up to everyone. As many as 5,000 votes were cast per year during the 1990s.

The awards were often presented at the annual Chicago Comicon until 1996 (when the Wizard Fan Awards moved in); from that point forward the CBG Award results were simply published in the magazine.

<doc id="662497" wikidata="Q89901" url="?curid=662497" title="Frederick Redlich">
<text>Frederick Carl Redlich (&quot;Fritz&quot;) (June 2, 1910 – January 1, 2004) was a psychiatrist and academic administrator. He was dean of the Yale School of Medicine from 1967 to 1972.

==Personal life==
Redlich was born in Vienna, the son of Ludwig Johann and Emma Redlich, and received his M.D. in 1935 from the University of Vienna. Following graduation, Redlich was an intern at Vienna General Hospital (1935-1936) and a psychiatric resident at Vienna University Clinic (1936-1938). He moved to the United States in 1938 with his wife Elsa (divorced 1953). They had two sons, Erik Christopher (1941-2002), and Peter J. 195?. They became U.S. citizen in 1943. Later Fritz married operatic mezzo-soprano Herta Glaz with whom he was together for nearly 50 years.

==Career==
He joined the faculty of Yale in 1942. In addition to his time as dean of the School of Medicine, Redlich was head of the department of psychiatry from 1950 to 1967.

He was a member of the Institute of Medicine and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was honored with Distinguished Service Awards from the American College of Psychiatrists and the American Psychiatric Association.
==Works==
In 1952 Redlich co-edited with Eugene Brody the widely read book, &quot;Psychotherapy With Schizophrenics.&quot;

Redlich is best known within the field of Community Mental Health for his groundbreaking study done in the late 1950s with sociologist August Hollingshead. In the study, &quot;Social Class and Mental Illness&quot; the two researched the mentally ill population of New Haven, Connecticut and the treatment they received within a calendar year.

Two aspects of the study have contributed to its historical significance. First, was the large, almost complete sample of all people from New Haven who sought psychiatric treatment in that year. This was achieved by identifying and communicating with psychiatric practitioners throughout the eastern United States as well as within New Haven.
The second aspect of the study was its definition of social class by income level with the designation of five social classes using the Roman numerals I though V (V being the poorest). This system of class designation is still utilized in current social science research.
The outcome of the study demonstrated that the majority of people in the upper two social classes received insight or talking therapy which was non-bodily intrusive and took place in private settings. The majority of the lowest social class received their treatment in public institutions. Their treatment consisted primarily of constraint and intrusive methods ( such as cold packs, electroshock, and lobotomies). The conclusions of their study were that social class plays a significant role in psychiatric diagnosis and treatment, with the upper social classes receiving less intrusive therapy.

<text>King Street–Old Town station (also known by its former name, King Street) is a Washington Metro station in Alexandria, Virginia, United States. The station opened on December 17, 1983, and is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). Providing service for both the Blue and Yellow Lines, this is the southernmost transfer station for the Blue and Yellow lines, as the two lines diverge just south of the station. During inclement weather, is commonly used as an unofficial transfer point, being the southernmost underground station common to both lines . King Street was originally served only by the Yellow Line, until the Blue Line was extended from to in 1991.

The station is located at King Street and Commonwealth Avenue. Entrances to the station are located on King Street and on the Diagonal Road side of the station. The station is above ground, and access to the single island platform is provided by one pair of escalators, one staircase, and one elevator.

==History==
Originally scheduled to open in summer 1982, its opening was delayed due to both unavailability of new subway cars and the lack of a test track. Construction of the station was complete by summer 1982, and in September 1983 Metro announced the station would open that December as the new cars would be ready for service. The station opened on December 17, 1983. Its opening coincided with the completion of of rail between National Airport and Huntington and the opening of the , and stations.

An expansion to the station added a second entrance and mezzanine across Commonwealth Avenue from the existing mezzanine, with the new entrance located on Cameron Street, across from the nearby Hilton Hotel. The expansion also includes a new canopy over the north end of the platform, designed to match the original canopy. A gap was left between the two canopies to preserve the view of the George Washington Masonic Memorial from Old Town.

The station was named King Street from its 1983 opening until November 3, 2011, when the station was given its present name as part of a preparation for service changes planned for 2012.

In May 2018, Metro announced an extensive renovation of platforms at twenty stations across the system. The Blue and Yellow Lines south of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport station, including the King Street–Old Town station, were closed from May 25 to September 9, 2019, during which the platforms at this station were rebuilt, along with new platform tiles, new passenger information displays, and other improvements.

The bus, parking, and Kiss and Ride area of King is undergoing a complete reconstruction and is closed, beginning November 2018 until planned reopening dates of Spring 2020 for buses and Fall 2020 for Kiss and Ride and taxis. Temporary bus bays are on Diagonal Road, along portions of Daingerfield Road, and on King Street.

Between September 10 and November 5, 2022, King Street-Old Town was closed due to the Potomac Yard station tie-in, closing all stations south of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport station. Shuttle buses were provided throughout the shutdown.

== Transit connections ==
The station is adjacent to Alexandria Union Station, together with which it serves Old Town Alexandria and as a transit hub for the city as a whole. Plans are in place to build a tunnel to allow a direct connection between the heavy rail station and the Metro station; presently transfers must be made by exiting either station and walking along a narrow sidewalk on King Street. Both Metrobus and DASH provide service to the station. A free daily trolley service provides direct access to Old Town and the Waterfront, making many stops along King Street. Car sharing is also available. The station is about 12 blocks (one mile or 1.6 kilometers) from the intersection of King and Washington Streets; it is about 17 blocks from the Waterfront.

==Station layout==
The station has an elevated island platform over King Street west of Diagonal Road. Two fare control areas on either side of King Street provide escalator and elevator access to the platform.

<doc id="662502" wikidata="Q11241519" url="?curid=662502" title="Disciple (Christianity)">
<text>In Christianity, a disciple is a dedicated follower of Jesus. This term is found in the New Testament only in the Gospels and Acts. Originating in the ancient Near East, the concept of a disciple is an adherent of a teacher. Discipleship is not the same as being a student in the modern sense; a disciple in the ancient biblical world actively imitated both the life and teaching of the master. It was a deliberate apprenticeship which made the fully formed disciple a living copy of the master.

The New Testament records many followers of Jesus during his ministry. Some disciples were given a mission, such as the Little Commission, the commission of the seventy in Luke&#x27;s Gospel, the Great Commission after the resurrection of Jesus, or the conversion of Paul, making them &quot;apostles&quot;, charged with proclaiming the gospel (the Good News) to the world. Jesus emphasised that being his disciples would be costly.

==Background of the term==
The term &quot;disciple&quot; represents the Koine Greek word (), which generally means &quot;one who engages in learning through instruction from another, &quot;pupil, apprentice&quot;&quot; or in religious contexts such as the Bible, &quot;one who is rather constantly associated with someone who has a pedagogical reputation or a particular set of views, &quot;disciple, adherent.&quot;&quot; The word &quot;disciple&quot; comes into English usage by way of the Latin &quot;discipulus&quot; meaning a learner, but given its biblical background, should not be confused with the more common English word &quot;student.&quot;

A disciple is different from an apostle, which instead means a messenger, more specifically &quot;messengers with extraordinary status, especially of God’s &quot;messenger, envoy.&quot;&quot; But predominately in the New Testament it is used of &quot;a group of highly honored believers with a special function as God’s envoys.&quot; While a disciple is one who learns and apprentices under a teacher or rabbi, an apostle is one sent as a missionary to proclaim the good news and to establish new communities of believers.

The meaning of the word &quot;disciple&quot; is not derived primarily from its root meaning or etymology but from its widespread usage in the ancient world. Disciples are found in the world outside of the Bible. For example among the ancient Greek philosophers, disciples learned by imitating the teacher’s entire way of life and not just by remembering the spoken words of the teacher.

The first-century philosopher Seneca appeals to the &quot;living voice and intimacy of common life&quot; of the discipleteacher relationship of many different philosophers:

In the world of the Bible, &quot;a disciple&quot; was a person who followed a teacher, or rabbi, or master, or philosopher. The disciple desired to learn not only the teaching of the rabbi, but to imitate the practical details of their life. A disciple did not merely attend lectures or read books, they were required to interact with and imitate a real living person. A disciple would literally follow someone in hopes of eventually becoming what they are.

A Christian disciple is a believer who follows Christ and then offers his own imitation of Christ as model for others to follow (1 Corinthians 11:1). A disciple is first a believer who has exercised faith (Acts 2:38; see also Born again (Catholicism)) This means they have experienced conversion and put Jesus at the center of their life and participated in rites of Christian imitation. A fully developed disciple is also a leader of others who attempts to pass on this faith to his followers, with the goal of repeating this process.(1 Corinthians 4:16–17; 2 Timothy 2:2).

==Great crowd and the seventy==

In addition to the Twelve Apostles there is a much larger group of people identified as disciples in the opening of the passage of the Sermon on the Plain. In addition, seventy (or seventy-two, depending on the source used) people are sent out in pairs to prepare the way for Jesus (Luke 10). They are sometimes referred to as the &quot;Seventy&quot; or the &quot;Seventy Disciples&quot;. They are to eat any food offered, heal the sick and spread the word that the Kingdom of God is coming.

==Undesirables==
Jesus practiced open table fellowship, scandalizing his critics by dining with sinners, tax collectors, Samaritans, and women.

===Sinners and tax collectors===
The gospels use the term &quot;sinners and tax collectors&quot; to depict those he fraternized with. Sinners were Jews who violated purity rules, or generally any of the 613 mitzvot, or possibly Gentiles who violated Noahide Law, though halacha was still in dispute in the 1st century, see also Hillel and Shammai and Circumcision controversy in early Christianity. Tax collectors profited from the Roman economic system that the Romans imposed in Iudaea province, which was displacing Galileans in their own homeland, foreclosing on family land and selling it to absentee landlords. In the honor-based culture of the time, such behavior went against the social grain.

===Samaritans===

Samaritans, positioned between Jesus&#x27; Galilee and Jerusalem&#x27;s Judea, were mutually hostile with Jews. In Luke and John, Jesus extends his ministry to Samaritans.

===Women who followed Jesus===
In Luke (10:38–42), Mary, sister of Lazarus, is contrasted with her sister Martha, who was &quot;cumbered about many things&quot; while Jesus was their guest, while Mary had chosen &quot;the better part,&quot; that of listening to the master&#x27;s discourse. John names her as the &quot;one who had anointed the Lord with perfumed oil and dried his feet with her hair&quot; (11:2). In Luke, an unidentified &quot;sinner&quot; in the house of a Pharisee anoints Jesus&#x27; feet. 
Luke refers to a number of people accompanying Jesus and the twelve. From among them he names three women: &quot;Mary, called Magdalene, ... and Joanna the wife of Herod&#x27;s steward Chuza, and Susanna, and many others, who provided for them out of their resources&quot; (Luke 8:2–3). Mary Magdalene and Joanna are among the women who went to prepare Jesus&#x27;s body in Luke&#x27;s account of the resurrection, and who later told the apostles and other disciples about the empty tomb and words of the &quot;two men in dazzling clothes&quot;. Mary Magdalene is the most well-known of the disciples outside of the Twelve. More is written in the gospels about her than the other female followers. There is also a large body of lore and literature covering her.

Other gospel writers differ as to which women witness the crucifixion and witness to the resurrection. Mark includes Mary, the mother of James and Salome (not to be confused with Salomé the daughter of Herodias) at the crucifixion and Salome at the tomb. John includes Mary the wife of Clopas at the crucifixion.

Tabitha (Dorcas) is the only female follower of Jesus named in the New Testament and explicitly called a disciple.

===Cleopas and companion on the road to Emmaus===
In Luke, Cleopas is one of the two disciples to whom the risen Lord appears at Emmaus (Luke 24:18). Cleopas and an unnamed disciple of Jesus are walking from Jerusalem to Emmaus on the day of Jesus&#x27;s resurrection. Cleopas and his friend are discussing the events of the past few days when a stranger asks them what they spoke of. The stranger is asked to join Cleopas and his friend for the evening meal. There the stranger is revealed, in blessing and breaking the bread, as the risen Jesus before he disappears. Cleopas and his friend hasten to Jerusalem to carry the news to the other disciples, to discover that Jesus has appeared there also and will do so again. The incident is without parallel in Matthew, Mark, or John.

==Discipleship==

===&quot;Love one another&quot;===

A definition of disciple is suggested by Jesus&#x27;s self-referential example from the Gospel of John 13:34–35: &quot;I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.&quot; (NRSV) Further definition by Jesus can be found in the Gospel of Luke, Chapter 14. Beginning with a testing trap laid out by his adversaries regarding observance of the Jewish Sabbath, Jesus uses the opportunity to lay out the problems with the religiosity of his adversaries against his own teaching by giving a litany of shocking comparisons between various, apparent socio-political and socio-economic realities versus the meaning of being his disciple.

===&quot;Be transformed&quot;===
The canonical gospels, Acts, and the Pauline epistles urge disciples to be imitators of Jesus Christ or of God himself. Being imitators requires obedience exemplified by moral behavior. With this biblical basis, Christian theology teaches that discipleship entails transformation from some other worldview and practice of life into that of Jesus Christ, and so, by way of Trinitarian theology, of God himself.

Paul the Apostle stressed transformation as a prerequisite for discipleship when he wrote that disciples must &quot;not be conformed to this world&quot; but must &quot;be transformed by the renewing of [their] minds&quot; so that they &quot;may discern what is the will of God—what is good and acceptable and perfect.&quot; Therefore, a disciple is not simply an accumulator of information or one who merely changes moral behavior in conformity with the teachings of Jesus Christ, but seeks a fundamental shift toward the ethics of Jesus Christ in every way, including complete devotion to God.

In several Christian traditions, the process of becoming a disciple is called the &quot;Imitation of Christ.&quot; This concept goes back to the Pauline epistles: &quot;be imitators of God&quot; (Ephesians 5:1) and &quot;be imitators of me, as I am of Christ&quot; (1 Corinthians 11:1). &quot;The Imitation of Christ&quot; by Thomas à Kempis promoted this concept in the 14th century.

===The Great Commission===

Ubiquitous throughout Christianity is the practice of proselytism, making new disciples. In Matthew, at the beginning of Jesus&#x27; ministry, when calling his earliest disciples—Simon, Peter, and Andrew—he says to them: &quot;Follow me and I will make you fishers of men&quot; (Matthew 4:19). Then, at the very end of his ministry Jesus institutes the Great Commission, commanding all present to &quot;go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you&quot; (Matthew 28:19-20a).

===Family and wealth===

Jesus called on disciples to give up their wealth and their familial ties. In his society, family was the individual&#x27;s source of identity, so renouncing it would mean becoming virtually nobody. In , Jesus used a hyperbolic metaphor to stress the importance of this, and another in : &quot;If anyone comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters—yes, even their own life—such a person cannot be my disciple.&quot; There are different interpretations of this text on counting the cost of discipleship.

===Discipleship Movement===

The &quot;Discipleship Movement&quot; (also known as the &quot;Shepherding Movement&quot;) was an influential and controversial movement within some British and American churches, emerging in the 1970s and early 1980s. The doctrine of the movement emphasized the &quot;one another&quot; passages of the New Testament, and the mentoring relationship prescribed by the Apostle Paul in 2 Timothy 2:2 of the Holy Bible. It was controversial in that it gained a reputation for controlling and abusive behavior, with a great deal of emphasis placed upon the importance of obedience to one&#x27;s own shepherd. The movement was later denounced by several of its founders, although some form of the movement continues today.

===Radical discipleship===
Radical discipleship is a movement in practical theology that has emerged from a yearning to follow the true message of Jesus and a discontentment with mainstream Christianity. Radical Christians, such as Ched Myers and Lee Camp, believe mainstream Christianity has moved away from its origins, namely the core teachings and practices of Jesus such as turning the other cheek and rejecting materialism. Radical is derived from the Latin word &quot;radix&quot; meaning &quot;root&quot;, referring to the need for perpetual re-orientation towards the root truths of Christian discipleship.

Radical discipleship also refers to the Anabaptist Reformation movement beginning in Zurich, Switzerland in 1527. This movement grew in part out of the belief that the Protestant Reformers such Martin Luther, John Calvin and Ulrich Zwingli were not going far enough in their respective reforms.

<doc id="662505" wikidata="Q46435" url="?curid=662505" title="Black drongo">
<text>The black drongo (Dicrurus macrocercus) is a small Asian passerine bird of the drongo family Dicruridae. It is a common resident breeder in much of tropical southern Asia from southwest Iran through Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka east to southern China and Indonesia and accidental visitor of Japan. It is an all black bird with a distinctive forked tail and measures in length. It feeds on insects, and is common in open agricultural areas and light forest throughout its range, perching conspicuously on a bare perch or along power or telephone lines. 

The species is known for its aggressive behaviour towards much larger birds, such as crows, never hesitating to dive-bomb any bird of prey that invades its territory. This behaviour earns it the informal name of king crow. Smaller birds often nest in the well-guarded vicinity of a nesting black drongo. Previously grouped along with the African fork-tailed drongo (&quot;Dicrurus adsimilis&quot;), the Asian forms are now treated as a separate species with several distinct populations.

The black drongo is listed as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) on the IUCN Red List, due to its large range and relative commonness. It has been introduced to some Pacific islands, where it has thrived and become abundant to the point of threatening and causing the extinction of native and endemic bird species there.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The black drongo was once considered a subspecies of the fork-tailed drongo (&quot;Dicrurus adsimilis&quot;), a close relative that diverged relatively recently. The two are now considered distinct species, with the fork-tailed drongo restricted to Africa and separated from the Asian range of the black drongo.

Seven subspecies have been named but the largely contiguous populations show clinal variation and intergrade with each other. Individuals from northern India (ssp. &quot;albirictus&quot;) are larger than those from the Sri Lankan population &quot;minor&quot; while those from the peninsular India (nominate subspecies) are intermediate in size. Race &quot;cathoecus&quot; is found in Thailand, Hong Kong and China. This race has a much smaller rictal spot and the wings are dark with a greenish gloss. In southern Siam a race &quot;thai&quot; is resident, but overlaps with wintering &quot;cathoecus&quot;. Race &quot;javanus&quot; is found on the islands of Java and Bali. Race &quot;harterti&quot; found in Formosa has the tail length less than the wing.

==Description==
This bird is glossy black with a wide fork to the tail. Adults usually have a small white spot at the base of the gape. The iris is dark brown (not crimson as in the similar ashy drongo). The sexes cannot be told apart in the field. Juveniles are brownish and may have some white barring or speckling towards the belly and vent, and can be mistaken for the white-bellied drongo. First-year birds have white tips to the feathers of the belly, while second-years have these white-tipped feathers restricted to the vent.

They are aggressive and fearless birds, and although only in length, they will attack much larger species that enter their nesting territory, including crows and birds of prey. This behaviour led to their former name of king crow. They fly with strong flaps of the wing and are capable of fast manoeuvres that enable them to capture flying insects. With short legs, they sit upright on thorny bushes, bare perches or electricity wires. They may also perch on grazing animals.

They are capable of producing a wide range of calls but a common call is a two note &quot;tee-hee&quot; call resembling that of the shikra (&quot;Accipiter badius&quot;).

==Distribution and habitat==
The black drongo is found predominantly in open country and usually perches and hunts close to the ground. They are mostly aerial predators of insects but also glean from the ground or off vegetation. They are found as summer visitors to northeastern Afghanistan and northern Pakistan but are residents from the Indus Valley until Bangladesh and into India and Sri Lanka. Some populations show seasonal movements that are poorly understood while populations in Korea are known to be migratory. The black drongo can be found in savanna, fields, and urban habitats.

Black drongos were introduced just before the Second World War from Taiwan to the island of Rota to help in the control of insects. It is believed that they dispersed over the sea to the island of Guam in the 1950s. By 1967, they were the fourth most commonly seen birds in roadside counts on Guam and are today the most abundant bird there. Predation by and competition from black drongos have been suggested as factors in the decline of endemic bird species such as the Rota bridled white-eye and the Guam flycatcher.

==Behaviour and ecology==

===Food and foraging===

Black drongos become active very early at dawn and roost later than many other birds. They feed mainly on insects such as grasshoppers, cicadas, termites, wasps, bees, ants, moths, beetles and dragonflies. They sometimes fly close to tree branches, attempting to disturb any insects that may be present. They congregate in fields being ploughed, picking up exposed caterpillars and beetle grubs. As many as 35 birds have been seen at such congregations. They are also attracted to fires in scrub and grasslands habitats where insects are disturbed. They appear to avoid flies. They associate with common mynas, cattle egrets and other birds that share a similar diet and habitat. Drongos benefit from this association and are more successful in their foraging. There is only partial overlap in the insect prey sought by mynas and drongos although in rare instances the drongos may rob prey from mynas. It is said that they imitate the call of the shikra so as to put mynas to flight and then to steal prey. Similar behaviour, using false alarm calls, has been noted in the fork-tailed drongo. There are some cases of the black drongo preying on small birds, reptiles, or maybe even bats. It has been suggested that they may feed on birds more intensively on migration. An individual on a migratory stop-over island in Korea caught several birds one after the other, killing them by striking at the back of the head and neck and feeding selectively on parts, especially the brain. They have also been on occasion seen feeding on fish. Flowers of trees such as &quot;Erythrina&quot; and &quot;Bombax&quot; may be visited for water and nectar and they are sometimes known to feed on grains. They are only rarely known to take larger arthropods such as scorpions and centipedes. They feed on milkweed butterflies that are often avoided by other predators and are known to feed late in the evening or night, often on insects attracted to artificial lights.

===Nesting and breeding===
Black drongos breed mainly in February and March in southern India, and until August in other parts of the country. Males and females sing in the mornings during the breeding season. Courtship can include aerobatic chases and they may lock their wings and beaks together, with the pair sometimes falling to the ground. Displays may be made on the ground. Pair bonds are retained for a whole breeding season. The nest is a cup made with a thin layer of sticks placed in the fork of branch, and is built in a week by both the male and female. Eggs are laid close to the first rains in April. The usual clutch is three or rarely four eggs laid in a cup nest placed in the fork of an outer branch of tree. Large leafy trees such as the jackfruit are preferred. The eggs are pale cream to red with spots and markings and are long and wide. The eggs are incubated by both parents and hatch after 14 to 15 days. Nestlings are brooded for the first five days, after which the young are capable of maintaining a fairly constant body temperature. A second clutch may be laid if the first is destroyed. Nests are sometimes built in telephone poles. A nesting territory of 0.003 to 0.012 km2 (0.3 to 1.2 hectares) is maintained.

Helpers, offspring from the previous brood, have sometimes been noted to assist in feeding the fledglings at the nest of their parents. Cases of brood parasitism by the Asian koel have been noted. An average breeding success of 44% has been noted with the main cause of fledgling mortality being shortage of insect food which in turn was dependent on rainfall.

===Mobbing and proximity nesting===

Their habit of driving away predators from near their nests is believed to encourage other birds such as orioles, doves, pigeons, babblers, and especially bulbuls, to nest in the vicinity. In one study 18 of 40 nests had red-vented bulbuls nesting within . An abnormal case of interspecific feeding with a red-vented bulbul feeding the chicks of a black drongo at their nest has been recorded.

 It has been suggested that the Asian drongo-cuckoo (&quot;Surniculus lugubris&quot;) has evolved to mimic this species. The intensity of mobbing predators was studied in Java and observations showed that there was a significant increase in mobbing, during the nesting season, of some predators such as the Javan hawk-eagle but the black eagle, a nest predator is mobbed with equal intensity in all seasons. It has been suggested that this strategy may avoid giving away the location of nests during the breeding season.

===Growth and development===

Young birds have a yellowish-red gape. The feather follicles appear on the fourth day and pin feathers emerge after a week. Nestlings increase in weight steadily until they are 12 days old. The eyes open on the eighth day, the iris reddish-black while the gape turns red. The young leave the nest after about 16 to 20 days after hatching. They do not have the fork in the tail until three weeks. The parents continue to feed and protect them for a month. Young birds may beg for food for longer, but are often ignored or chased away by the adults. Birds reach breeding condition in about two years.

They are so aggressive that they may sometimes land on large birds of prey and peck them when mobbing.
Play behaviour has been observed with birds dropping a leaf in the air and catching it in mid-air and these may possibly help young birds acquire aerobatic skills.

In southern India, they moult their feathers from June to October. The wing moult begins in July with the first primary and proceeds towards the tenth. Secondaries are replaced from August after the primaries are at the third quill. The secondary moult is not orderly, the 8th and 7th being dropped earlier than the rest. The tail feathers are moulted centrifugally. Seasonal colour changes in the testicular tissues are caused by variation in melanin synthesis, with the dark pigmentation being lost during the breeding season.

===Parasites and diseases===
Many ectoparasitic bird lice (&quot;Myrsidea&quot; spp. and &quot;Menacanthus&quot; spp.), endoparasitic cestodes and nematodes have been described from this species. However no predators or diseases are significant factors in adult mortality.

==Relationship to humans==

Their habit of preying on bees makes them a nuisance to bee-keepers, but farmers attract them to their fields using artificial perches in fields to encourage them to feed on pest insects.

===In culture===
Being common, they have a wide range of local names. The older genus name of &quot;Buchanga&quot; was derived from the Hindi name of &quot;Bhujanga&quot;. Other local names include &quot;srigunting hitam&quot; in Indonesia, &quot;Thampal&quot; in Pakistan, &quot;Gohalo&quot;/&quot;Kolaho&quot; in Baluchistan, &quot;Kalkalachi&quot; in Sindhi, &quot;Kotwal&quot; (policeman) in Hindi; &quot;Finge&quot; or &quot;Finga&quot; in Bengali; &quot;Phesu&quot; in Assamese; &quot;Cheiroi&quot; in Manipuri; &quot;Kosita&quot;/&quot;Kalo koshi&quot; in Gujarati; &quot;Ghosia&quot; in Marathi; &quot;Kajalapati&quot; in Oriya; &quot;Kari kuruvi&quot; (charcoal bird), &quot;Erettai valan&quot; (two tail) in Tamil; &quot;Passala poli gadu&quot; in Telugu; &quot;Aanaranji&quot; (elephant snatcher) in Malayalam; &quot;Kari bhujanga&quot; in Kannada and &quot;Kalu Kawuda&quot; in Sinhalese. The soliga people do not differentiate this and the bronzed drongo, both being known as &quot;karaḷi&quot; but the greater racket-tailed drongo is called &quot;dodda&quot; &quot;karaḷi&quot; (or large &quot;karaḷi&quot;). A superstition in central India is that cattle would lose their horn if a newly fledged drongo alighted on it. It is held in reverence in parts of Punjab in the belief that it brought water to Husayn ibn Ali, revered by Shī‘a Muslims.

<text>Eisenhower Avenue station is a rapid transit station on the Yellow Line of the Washington Metro in Alexandria, Virginia. It opened on December 17, 1983.

==Location==
The station is located at Eisenhower Avenue near Stovall Street, next to the Capital Beltway and the Hoffman Town Center entertainment complex. The station provides connections to Metro&#x27;s REX (Richmond Highway Express) bus service and the DASH bus service run by the city of Alexandria.

==History==
Originally scheduled to open in summer 1982, its opening was delayed due to both unavailability of new subway cars and the lack of a test track. Construction of the station was complete by summer 1982, and in September 1983 Metro announced the station would open that December as the new cars would be ready for service. The station opened on December 17, 1983. Its opening coincided with the completion of of rail between the and stations and the opening of the , Huntington, and stations.
In May 2018, Metro announced an extensive renovation of platforms at twenty stations across the system. The Blue and Yellow Lines south of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport station, including the Eisenhower Avenue station, would be closed from May to September 2019, during which the platforms at this station would be rebuilt.

From March 26, 2020 until June 28, 2020, this station was closed due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic.

Between September 10, 2022, and November 5, 2022, Eisenhower Avenue was closed due to the Potomac Yard station tie-in, closing all stations south of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport station. Shuttle buses were provided throughout the shutdown. Additionally, beginning on November 6, 2022, Blue Line trains began serving Eisenhower Avenue due to the suspension of the Yellow Line from the 14th Street Bridge project. Trains operated between Huntington and stations until May 7, 2023, when service on the Yellow Line resumed but truncated from its northeastern terminus from to .

==Station layout==
Eisenhower Avenue station is one of only two elevated side-platformed stations in the Metro system (the other being ). Access to each platform is provided by a pair of escalators and an elevator. It is also one of only two stations that are serviced exclusively by the Yellow Line, the other being .

<text>Huntington station is an island-platformed Washington Metro station in the Huntington area of Fairfax County, Virginia, United States (though its mailing address says Alexandria). The station was opened on December 17, 1983, and is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). Serving as the southern terminus for the Yellow Line, the station is built into a hillside; the south mezzanine, along with escalator access, is accessible via an incline elevator.

The station serves the suburban area of Fairfax County and is a popular commuter station with over 3,000 parking spaces. It is located between North Kings Highway (State Route 241) and Huntington Avenue, with parking facilities and station entrances available off of both roads. Service began on December 17, 1983, making it the first station to open in Fairfax County, and the first to extend the system beyond the Capital Beltway. The station is located on the ruins of Fort Lyon, a Civil War-era fort.

==History==
Originally scheduled to open in summer 1982, its opening was delayed due to both unavailability of new subway cars and the lack of a test track. Construction of the station was complete by summer 1982, and in September 1983 Metro announced the station would open that December as the new cars would be ready for service. The station opened on December 17, 1983. Its opening coincided with the completion of of rail between National Airport and Huntington and the opening of the , , and stations.
In May 2018, Metro announced an extensive renovation of platforms at twenty stations across the system. The Blue and Yellow Lines south of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport station, including the Huntington station, would be closed from May to September 2019. This will allow for the eventual demolition of an abandoned parking structure at Huntington, as well as the rehabilitation of a track crossover. The platform at the Huntington station itself was rebuilt from January to May 2020.

Between September 10, 2022 and November 5, 2022, Huntington was closed due to the Potomac Yard station tie-in, closing all stations south of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport station. Shuttle buses were provided throughout the shutdown. Additionally, beginning on November 6, 2022, Blue Line trains began serving Huntington due to the suspension of the Yellow Line from the 14th Street Bridge project. Trains operated between Huntington and stations until May 7, 2023, when service on the Yellow Line resumed but truncated from its northeastern terminus from to .

==Station layout==

Architecturally, Huntington station is different from the rest of the Metro network. It is partially elevated and built into the surrounding hillside. Riders enter the station from the north on a viaduct carrying the tracks from downtown Washington, D.C., but the south end of the island platform is below grade. The tracks continue into short tunnels in the hill, allowing for a future extension. The canopy is supported by buttresses that bridge the tracks into the sloped walls of the depression in which the station is built. As a result of the unusual topography, there is an incline elevator at this station, the only one installed anywhere in the Metrorail system and one of only a handful of such elevators in the United States. WMATA is unsure why the design used such an elevator, rather than a traditional vertical elevator plus a horizontal walkway.

Huntington is one of only two stations that is serviced exclusively by the Yellow Line, the other being .

==Buses and parking==
Bus routes from Huntington on Metrobus and Fairfax Connector serve much of southern Fairfax County, Virginia.

A new 1,424-space parking garage located on the station&#x27;s east side opened on August 14, 2008. There are 3,617 parking spaces at the station. The former surface parking lot off North Kings Highway is the center of an ongoing residential and business redevelopment project. Parking at Huntington Station costs $4.85 all day on weekdays, but is free on weekends and federal holidays.

<doc id="662530" wikidata="Q4395105" url="?curid=662530" title="Cokie Roberts">
<text>Mary Martha Corinne Morrison Claiborne &quot;Cokie&quot; Roberts (née Boggs; December 27, 1943 – September 17, 2019) was an American journalist and author. Her career included decades as a political reporter and analyst for National Public Radio, PBS, and ABC News, with prominent positions on &quot;Morning Edition&quot;, &quot;The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour&quot;, &quot;World News Tonight&quot;, and &quot;This Week&quot;. She was considered one of NPR&#x27;s &quot;Founding Mothers&quot; along with Susan Stamberg, Linda Wertheimer and Nina Totenberg.

Roberts, along with her husband, Steve, wrote a weekly column syndicated by United Media in newspapers around the United States. She served on the boards of several non-profit organizations such as the Kaiser Family Foundation and was appointed by President George W. Bush to his Council on Service and Civic Participation.

==Early life and education==
Roberts was born in New Orleans. She received the nickname Cokie from her brother, Tommy, who as a child could not pronounce her given name, Corinne.

Her parents were Lindy Boggs and Hale Boggs, each of whom served for decades as Democratic members of the House of Representatives from Louisiana; Lindy succeeded Hale after his plane disappeared over Alaska in 1972. Cokie was their third child. Her sister Barbara became mayor of Princeton, New Jersey and a candidate for the United States Senate. Her brother Tommy became a prominent attorney and lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

She attended the Academy of the Sacred Heart, an all-girls Roman Catholic high school in New Orleans, and graduated from the Stone Ridge School, an all-girls school outside Washington, D.C., in 1960. She graduated from Wellesley College in 1964, where she received a Bachelor of Arts in political science.

==Career==
Roberts&#x27; first job in journalism was at WRC-TV in Washington, D.C., where she was host of its weekly public affairs program &quot;Meeting of the Minds&quot;. After moving with her husband Steve, also a journalist, to New York City, she found work in 1967 as a reporter for Cowles Communications. She worked briefly as a producer for WNEW-TV before Steve&#x27;s career had them relocating to Los Angeles. She worked for Altman Productions and then for KNBC-TV as producer of the children&#x27;s program &quot;Serendipity&quot;, which won a 1971 Los Angeles Area Emmy Award. She also moved with her husband to Greece, where she was a stringer for CBS News in Athens.

Roberts began working for National Public Radio (NPR) in 1978, working as the congressional correspondent for more than 10 years. Because of her early involvement as a female journalist in the network at a time when women were not often involved in journalism at the highest levels, she has been called one of the &quot;founding mothers of NPR.&quot; Roberts was a contributor to the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) on the evening television news program &quot;The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour&quot;. Her coverage of the Iran-Contra Affair for that program won her the Edward Weintal Prize for Diplomatic Reporting in 1988. From 1981 to 1984, in addition to her work at NPR, she also cohosted &quot;The Lawmakers&quot;, a weekly public television program on Congress. Starting in 1992, Roberts served as a senior news analyst and commentator for NPR, primarily on the daily news program &quot;Morning Edition&quot;. In 1994, &quot;The New York Times&quot; credited her, along with NPR&#x27;s Linda Wertheimer and Nina Totenberg, with transforming male-dominated Washington, D.C., political journalism.

Roberts went to work for ABC News in 1988 as a political correspondent for ABC&#x27;s &quot;World News Tonight&quot; with Peter Jennings, continuing to serve part-time as a political commentator at NPR.
She appeared as a panelist for many years on ABC News&#x27; Sunday morning broadcast &quot;This Week with David Brinkley&quot;. After Brinkley&#x27;s retirement, she co-anchored the program with Sam Donaldson (renamed &quot;This Week with Sam Donaldson &amp; Cokie Roberts&quot;) from 1996 to 2002, while serving as the chief congressional analyst for ABC News. The two were replaced as anchors in September 2002 by George Stephanopoulos. She also covered politics, Congress, and public policy while reporting for &quot;World News Tonight&quot; and other ABC News broadcasts. Roberts continued to serve occasionally as a panelist on &quot;This Week&quot; and work on NPR. Her final assignment with NPR was a series of segments on &quot;Morning Edition&quot; titled &quot;Ask Cokie,&quot; in which she answered questions submitted by listeners about subjects usually related to U.S. politics.

==Reporting on Dianna Ortiz case==
In 1989, Sister Dianna Ortiz, a Catholic sister from New Mexico, was abducted, raped, and tortured while working in Guatemala by members of a Guatemalan government-backed death squad. Her abductors believed Ortiz was a subversive. During a subsequent interview, Roberts contested Ortiz&#x27;s claim that an American was among her captors. (The United States provided significant military aid to Guatemala at the time.) Roberts implied that Ortiz was lying about the entire episode, although Ortiz later won a lawsuit against a Guatemalan general she accused in the case. It was later revealed that Patton Boggs, the law firm of Roberts&#x27; brother Tommy, was paid by the Guatemalan government to promote a more positive image of the regime, which was widely criticized internationally for human rights abuses.

==Awards and honors==
Roberts won the Edward R. Murrow Award, the Everett McKinley Dirksen Award for coverage of Congress, and a 1991 Emmy Award for her contribution to &quot;Who Is Ross Perot?&quot; In 1997, she received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member Sam Donaldson. In 2000, she won the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism.

Roberts and her mother, Lindy Boggs, won the Foremother Award from the National Center for Health Research in 2013.

She was made an honoris causa initiate of Omicron Delta Kappa in 1995 from the University of Akron and later received the organization&#x27;s highest honor, the Laurel Crowned Circle. Roberts was also inducted into the Broadcasting &amp; Cable Hall of Fame in 2000. She was also cited as one of the 50 greatest women in the history of broadcasting by the American Women in Radio and Television.

Roberts was a president of the Radio and Television Correspondents&#x27; Association.

==Personal life and death==
From 1966 until her death, Roberts was married to Steven V. Roberts, a professor and fellow journalist. They met in summer 1962, when she was 18 and he was 19. They resided in Bethesda, Maryland. They had two children: a son, Lee, and a daughter, Rebecca. Roberts was a Roman Catholic.

In 2002, Roberts was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer. She was successfully treated at the time but died from complications of the disease in Washington, D.C., on September 17, 2019.

<text>Braddock Road station is an island-platformed Washington Metro station in Alexandria, Virginia, United States. The station was opened on December 17, 1983, and is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). Providing service for both the Blue and Yellow Lines, the station is located at Braddock Road and West Street.

== History ==
Originally scheduled to open in summer 1982, its opening was delayed because of both unavailability of new subway cars and the lack of a test track. Construction of the station was complete by summer 1982, and in September 1983 Metro announced the station would open that December as the new cars would be ready for service. The station opened on December 17, 1983. Its opening coincided with the completion of of rail between National Airport and Huntington and the opening of the Eisenhower Avenue, Huntington and King Street–Old Town stations.

In 2012, a Capital Bikeshare station was installed across the street as part of Alexandria&#x27;s initial bikeshare expansion and another station was added closer to the entrance in early 2022.

In 2014, the Metroway Bus Rapid Transit system began service with Braddock Road station serving as the southern terminus.

In May 2018, Metro announced an extensive renovation of platforms at twenty stations across the system. The Blue and Yellow Lines south of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport station, including the Braddock Road station, would be closed from May to September 2019, during which the platforms at this station would be rebuilt.

Between September 10 and November 5, 2022, Braddock Road was closed due to the Potomac Yard station tie-in, closing all stations south of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport station. Shuttle buses were provided throughout the shutdown.

== Station layout ==
Access to the island platform is provided by one pair of escalators and one elevator. The Metro tracks and platform are on an embankment relative to street level, supported by a concrete retaining wall. West of the platform are the three tracks of the RF&amp;P Subdivision, which carry Amtrak and Virginia Railway Express trains, while east of the platform there are bus bays serving DASH and Metrobus and a small metered parking lot.

<text>Nikkor is the brand of lenses produced by Nikon Corporation, including camera lenses for the Nikon F-mount and more recently, for the Nikon Z line of mirrorless cameras. 

The &quot;Nikkor&quot; brand was introduced in 1932, a Westernised rendering of an earlier version &quot;Nikkō&quot; (日光), an abbreviation of the company&#x27;s original full name &quot;Nippon Kōgaku&quot; (&quot;Japan Optics&quot;; 日本光学工業株式会社). (&quot;Nikkō&quot; also means &quot;sunlight&quot; and is the name of a Japanese town.) In 1933, Nikon marketed its first camera lens under the Nikkor brand name, the &quot;Aero-NIKKOR,&quot; for aerial photography.

Nikon originally reserved the Nikkor designation for its highest-quality imaging optics, but in recent history almost all Nikon lenses are so branded.

Notable Nikkor branded optics have included:
* F-mount lenses for 35mm SLR and DSLR photography (for a full list see Nikon F-mount).
* Z-mount lenses for Nikon mirrorless cameras.
* 1-mount lenses for Nikon 1 series cameras.
* Lenses for Zenza Bronica and Plaubel Makina medium format cameras.
* Lenses for Nikon S-mount and Leica rangefinder cameras, as well as very early Canon cameras.
* Amphibious lenses for Nikonos underwater cameras.
* Macro lenses under the Micro-Nikkor designation.
* Lenses for large format photography.
* EL-Nikkor photographic enlarger lenses.
* Microscope objectives.
* Industrial lenses, including lenses in support of the Japanese war effort during World War II.

==Lenses for Nikon systems==

===Nikon Z-mount===
Nikon introduced the Z-mount in 2018 for their system of digital full-frame and APS-C (DX) mirrorless cameras. All of Nikon&#x27;s Z-mount lenses are Nikkors.

===Nikon F-mount===
Nikkors constitute the majority of lenses available for the Nikon F-mount, which is itself the largest system of interchangeable flange-mount photographic lenses in history. These lenses are designed for the 135 (35mm) and Nikon DX formats. Over 400 different F-mount Nikkor models are known to exist.

===Nikon 1-mount===
Nikon introduced the compact mirrorless Nikon 1 camera system using 2.7x-crop sensors in 2011. The Nikon 1 system was effectively discontinued in 2018 with the introduction of the full-frame Nikon Z system.

===Nikonos===
The original Nikonos system introduced in 1963 is a scale-focus and rangefinder system for underwater photography. The 1992 Nikonos RS system is an underwater autofocus SLR system based on the F-mount.

===Nikon S-mount===

Rangefinder camera system dating to the late 1940s which became popular with the 1951 Nikon S.

==Lenses for other camera systems==
Note: In the case of the Nikkor wides, &quot;W&quot; just means &quot;wide&quot;. Prior to approximately 1976, most Nikon lenses had a suffix appended directly after the &quot;Nikkor&quot; name that was used to denote the number of optical elements in the lens design.

For example, a lens with eight elements would be marked &quot;Nikkor-O&quot;, and a lens with eleven elements &quot;Nikkor-UD&quot;.

<doc id="662541" wikidata="Q171074" url="?curid=662541" title="Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport station">
<text>Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport station is a Washington Metro station in Arlington, Virginia on the Blue and Yellow Lines. The station platform is elevated and covered and is the last above-ground station on the Yellow Line in Virginia, heading into Washington, D.C. It is one of only two stations in the system to have three tracks (the other being ). The station is located across Smith Boulevard from Terminal 2 at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport; the mezzanine is directly connected to Level 2 of the terminal (security checkpoints/gates level) by two pedestrian bridges. Airport shuttle buses or a walkway connect the station and Terminal 1. The airport&#x27;s Abingdon Plantation historical site is near the station.

== History ==

The station opened on July 1, 1977. Its opening coincided with the completion of of rail between National Airport and RFK Stadium and the opening of the , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and stations.

When service began on July 1, 1977, it was the southern terminus of the Blue Line. After the Yellow Line extension to opened on December 17, 1983, the station remained the southern terminus for the Blue Line until the station opened in 1991.

During construction of a second canopy at the station, Metro began running trains through the center track even though it had not been constructed for standard operations, and on January 20, 2003, a Blue Line train derailed at the switch. No injuries resulted, but the accident delayed construction by a number of weeks. The center track was originally intended for relaying trains.

In 2014, a train was temporarily parked in the middle track while one of the elevators in the station was repaired, creating a &quot;train bridge&quot; to allow passengers to walk through the train to transfer between directions.

In May 2018, Metro announced an extensive renovation of platforms at twenty stations across the system. The Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport station served as a temporary southern terminal for the Blue and Yellow Lines from May to September 2019, while the stations south of the National Airport station were closed. The platforms at the National Airport station itself were rebuilt from August to December 2020.

Between May 25 and September 8, 2019, all trains terminated at this station due to the Platform improvement project which closed stations south of Ronald Reagan Airport. Between September 10 until November 5, 2022, all trains also terminated at Ronald Reagan airport due to the station tie-in, closing all stations south of the station.

=== Renaming controversy ===
The station retained its original name after the airport was renamed in 1998 from &quot;Washington National Airport&quot; to &quot;Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport&quot;. In early 2001, a letter signed by 24 members of Congress requested WMATA rename the station to conform. However, according to a Metro policy adopted in 1987, groups seeking to rename a station were required to pay the cost of replacing signs and maps. The Arlington County government, which could have made the change, demurred—the price was estimated at $400,000—and WMATA subsequently declined to rename the station on April 19, 2001. In response, Republican Congressman Bob Barr of Georgia threatened to withhold federal funding from the agency unless the station was renamed. Congress ultimately voted to require the renaming on November 30, 2001. According to then-General Manager Richard A. White, Metro paid to complete the renaming.

== Station layout ==
The station has two island platforms serving three tracks. Between 2022-2024 the escalators at this station were replaced stopping at the opposite platforms. For example the trains to Downtown Largo and Mt Vernon SQ would stop at the southbound platform in the center track and vice versa.

<doc id="662542" wikidata="Q7655305" url="?curid=662542" title="Sweet Eros">
<text>Sweet Eros is a one-act, two-character play by Terrence McNally, which premiered Off-Broadway in 1968.

==Productions==
&quot;Sweet Eros&quot; opened Off-Broadway at the Gramercy Arts Theatre on November 21, 1968, on a double bill with another McNally play, &quot;Witness&quot;. The two plays closed on January 26, 1969. Directed by Larry Arrick, the cast starred Sally Kirkland as &quot;The Girl&quot; and Robert Drivas as the &quot;Young Man&quot; (to whom McNally dedicated the work).

===Regional and international===
Some U.S. productions of &quot;Sweet Eros&quot; (as of 2008) have been produced:

* Washington, D.C., by Source Theatre Company and Yellow Taxi Productions (Feb.-March 2004), directed by Dominic A. D&#x27;Andrea, featuring Justin Benoit and MaryBeth Fritzky
* Madison, Wisconsin, by Mercury Players Theatre (MercLab) (July 2006), directed by Cara Peterson and featuring Kelly Lee Kriesel and R. Peter Hunt
* Austin, Texas, by Tongue and Groove Theatre (Sept. 2006), directed by David Yeakle and featuring Mark Stewart and Hilah Johnson
* Tucson, Arizona, by Live Theatre Workshop (May 2008), directed by Danielle Dryer and featuring Miranda McBride and Christopher Johnson
A May 2005 revival in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, was staged by and featured Robert Braiden and Veronica Smith.

==Plot==
A disturbed young man, soured by two failed romantic relationships, has kidnapped a young woman (a complete stranger) and taken her to his home in the country. As the play opens, the woman is seated in a chair, bound and gagged, the man sitting opposite, observing her. The man explains to the woman his reasons for kidnapping her, saying he had long fantasized about doing such a thing to a young woman. He methodically strips his captive naked, presumably rapes her, then proceeds to subject her to an ongoing series of rants, ruminations and reflections on life and love as he seeks to force the woman to understand him – and, ultimately, to submit to him.

==Nudity==
&quot;Sweet Eros&quot; caused a sensation when it first opened in New York because its female star, Sally Kirkland, was nude for nearly the entire length of the play, which lasts approximately 45 minutes. Because of this play, Kirkland has claimed to be the first actress to perform completely naked in legitimate New York theatre, but this claim is undercut by the fact that the rock musical &quot;Hair&quot;, with its notorious group nude scene, had opened on Broadway seven months earlier.

According to an article in the &quot;Daytona Beach Morning Journal&quot;, &quot;The event was duly noted as the first completely nude role.&quot;

<doc id="662543" wikidata="Q6039601" url="?curid=662543" title="Institute for Research on Public Policy">
<text>The Institute for Research on Public Policy (IRPP; ) is an independent, national, bilingual, not-for-profit organization based in Montreal, Quebec. Its mission is to &quot;improve public policy in Canada by generating research, providing insight and informing debate on current and emerging policy issues facing Canadians and their governments.&quot; It publishes peer-reviewed research and acts as a convenor of policy debates by organizing conferences, round tables and panel discussions among stakeholders, academics, policymakers and the general public. It is also the publisher of &quot;Policy Options&quot; magazine and the home of the Centre of Excellence on the Canadian Federation.

The institute`s current research agenda focuses on several issues including Canadian federalism and intergovernmental affairs, affordability, income support, industrial policy, skills and training, and community transformations.

The IRPP was created as a result of a commitment the government of Prime Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau made in a Speech from the Throne in 1968 to establish an &quot;independent and autonomous&quot; institute for public policy research, whose work would be &quot;available to all governments.

The IRPP is financed by an endowment fund, to which federal and provincial governments and the private sector contributed in the early 1970s. The Institute is a registered charity under the &quot;Income Tax Act&quot;, and is incorporated under Part II of the &quot;Canada Corporations Act&quot;.

Elizabeth Roscoe is the current Chair of the Board of Directors and Jennifer Ditchburn is the current President and CEO.

==Purpose and mission==
The IRPP&#x27;s stated mission is to &quot;improve public policy in Canada by generating research, providing insight and informing debate on current and emerging policy issues facing Canadians and their governments.&quot;

Although Prime Minister Trudeau&#x27;s original proposal for the institute was as a resource to be drawn on by the federal and provincial governments, Ronald S. Ritchie – who accepted an invitation from the federal government to prepare a study on the concept – broadened this scope in a commissioned report published in 1969. Ritchie proposed that the IRPP should provide research and analysis &quot;designed to improve the basis for informed choice and decisions by the public of Canada and its leaders on questions of public policy,&quot; and specified that &quot;its intended audience should rather be opinion leaders, public servants and political leaders,&quot; and not only &quot;academics.&quot;

The research agenda defined by its second president, Michael Kirby, aimed to conduct research &quot;where existing policies were inadequate, where the need for change was recognized and where other institutions could not satisfy the need.&quot;

The IRPP&#x27;s research is sometimes released with a direct aim of influencing policy-makers. For example, a September 2000 report titled &quot;Recommendations to First Ministers&quot; was issued a few days before the First Ministers&#x27; Meeting that year. This report was the product of an eight-person task force of expert practitioners and academics convened by the IRPP to advise on health care policy.

==Governance==

==Political orientation==
The founding principles of the IRPP state that &quot;the Institute should dedicate itself to impartial service of the national cultures, the various regions and the various governments of the people of Canada in its research and analysis on public policy questions.&quot; According to former acting secretary Peter Dobell, the IRPP&#x27;s non-partisan position aims to &quot;let the research speak for itself.&quot;

Hilary Clark of TVO&#x27;s Inside Agenda blog places the IRPP in the political centre, while a report prepared by George Fetherling for the Sheldon Chumir Foundation for Ethics in Leadership describes the Institute as centre-right.

Academic Evert Lindquist describes the IRPP as &quot;Canada&#x27;s equivalent to the Brookings Institution.&quot; According to Lindquist, the Institute is generally perceived as a moderate supporter of the market system, free trade and limited government. However, the IRPP is often considered to be slightly to the left because of its links to prominent Liberals and the reformist views expressed in some of its publications.

Regarding the IRPP&#x27;s plurality, &quot;Maclean’s&quot; and &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; journalist Mary Janigan has said that &quot;the reason the IRPP is fabulous is that they allow every idea to enter the fray.&quot; The IRPP&#x27;s board of directors and staff have had members with ties to all of the major Canadian political parties, and has had numerous unaffiliated members.

==Finances==
The IRPP is financed by an endowment fund, to which federal and provincial governments and the private sector contributed in the early 1970s. This endowment fund was conceived with the goal of ensuring the institute&#x27;s independence.

In addition to its endowment, the IRPP accepts donations from both public and private donors – to the extent that these donations do not come with conditions. The Institute strives to invest its own resources in all of its projects and to seek a diversity of donors, so that no single source of funding becomes indispensable. The IRPP&#x27;s endowment fund is overseen by an investment committee and managed by professional investment firms. This committee advises the Board of Directors on investment strategies that aim to maintain the real value of the fund (after inflation).

==History==
Following Prime Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau’s commitment to establish the Institute, Ronald S. Ritchie was tasked to prepare a study in this direction. His report titled &quot;An Institute for Research on Public Policy&quot; was submitted to the federal government in December 1969. It touched on questions of financing, governance and the mission of the Institute. In addition, the report proposed the establishment of an endowment fund to ensure the Institute&#x27;s independence. It also recommended that the Institute seek incorporation as a nonprofit corporation under the direction of a Board of Directors composed of &quot;a small number of distinguished citizens.&quot;

In the spring of 1971, the Canadian government accepted the core ideas of Ritchie&#x27;s report. Deputy Secretary of the Cabinet Michael Pitfield qualified Ritchie&#x27;s proposal of an endowment by requiring a council of trustees to be established. This council of trustees, with about 50 members, would include a representative from each government in Canada, and would oversee the annual election of the board of directors and the governance of the institute.

The founding board of directors applied for incorporation on March 16, 1972, and the letters patent were approved on April 11. The founding Board of Directors was made up of J.V. Clyne (a Vancouver businessman), Louis Armand Desrochers (a lawyer from Edmonton), Louis Lorrain (a union executive from Montreal), Reverend Joseph MacNeil (bishop of Saint John), the Hon. John Robarts (former premier of Ontario), and Jeanne Sauvé (then a broadcaster in Montreal). Peter Dobell served as acting secretary, and Ron Ritchie was elected chair of the board.

==&quot;Policy Options&quot;==
&quot;Policy Options&quot; is the digital magazine published by the IRPP. The first issue of &quot;Policy Options&quot; was published in March 1980 under the leadership of founding editor Tom Kent. In 2016 the magazine transitioned from a print to a digital publication.

&quot;Policy Options&quot; features daily articles on issues of public policy by English- and French-language contributors from academia, research institutions, the political world, the public service and the nonprofit and private sectors. Its stated goal is to provide a window into some of the discussions that key decision-makers are having or should be having, and to feature a diversity of viewpoints. The magazine also has a biweekly podcast, called the &quot;Policy Options Podcast&quot;. The magazine also features reports, such as the March 2024 report assessing Canada&#x27;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2017 &quot;Policy Options&quot; regular contributor Tim Caulfield received gold in the Digital Publishing Awards’ Best Blog or Online-Only Column category for his column &quot;The Cure&quot;. &quot;Policy Options&quot; was also a silver medalist in the 2017, 2018 and 2019 Canadian Online Publishing Awards, in the categories for best blog/column and best podcast.

Les Perreaux is the current editor-in-chief of Policy Options. He began his post in 2021.

Previous editors of the magazine:
* Jennifer Ditchburn (2016–21)
* Dan Gardner (2015–16)
* Bruce Wallace (2012–14)
* L. Ian MacDonald (2002–12)
* William Watson (1999-2002)
* Alfred Leblanc (1994–98)
* Mathew Horsman (1991–93)
* Walter Stewart (1987–90)
* Thomas Worrall Kent (1980–87)

==Centre of Excellence on the Canadian Federation==
In 2020, the Institute launched its Centre of Excellence on the Canadian Federation, a permanent research body “that will build a deeper understanding of Canada as a federal community,” led by Charles Breton. It is financed by a $10 million commitment from the Government of Canada.

<doc id="662547" wikidata="Q7892616" url="?curid=662547" title="United States of America Mathematical Olympiad">
<text>The United States of American Mathematical Olympiad (USaMO) is a highly selective high school mathematics competition held annually in the United States. Since its debut in 1972, it has served as the final round of the American Mathematics Competitions. In 2010, it split into the USAMO and the United States of America Junior Mathematical Olympiad (USAJMO).

Top scorers on both six-question, nine-hour mathematical proof competitions are invited to join the Mathematical Olympiad Program to compete and train to represent the United States at the International Mathematical Olympiad.

==Eligibility==
In order to be eligible to take the USAMO, a participant must be either a U.S. citizen or a legal resident of the United States or Canada. Only US citizens and permanent residents could be invited to the USAMO until 2003, other students legally residing in the US can be invited since 2004. Starting from IMO 2022, only U.S. permanent residents and citizens may join the American IMO team. In addition, all participants, regardless of geographic location, must meet qualification indices determined by previous rounds of the AMC contests. Entry to the USAMO is by invitation only.

==History==
The USAMO was created in 1972 at the initiative of Nura D. Turner and Samuel L. Greitzer, and served as the next round to the AHSME until 1982. In 1983, the American Invitational Mathematics Examination was introduced as a bridge between the AHSME and USAMO. In 2010, the USAMO split into the USAMO and USAJMO.

==Historical participant selection process==
The USAMO (and the USAJMO since 2010) is restricted to approximately 500 (250 prior to 2006) participants combined each year. To keep this quota constant, the AMC Committee uses a selection process, which has seen a number of revisions in the competition&#x27;s history.

===Present===
AMC 12 based indices are determined by taking AMC 12 Score + 10*(AIME Score). AMC 10 based indices are determined by taking AMC 10 Score + 10*(AIME Score). Cutoffs, based on AMC 12 indices, are determined so that approximately 260-270 students qualify for the USAMO. Cutoffs, based on AMC 10 indices, are determined so that approximately 230-240 students qualify for the USAJMO. If a student took the AMC 10 and 12 (i.e. AMC 10A and 12B or AMC 12A and 10B) and qualified for both the USAMO and USAJMO, the student must take the USAMO. In 2020, due to grading constraints caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, lower numbers of students were admitted (223 USAMO qualifiers and 158 USAJMO qualifiers). In addition, students who qualify for the AIME through scoring at least 68/75 on the United States of America Mathematical Talent Search can qualify for the USAMO by scoring at least 11 on the AIME or the USAJMO by scoring 9-10 on the AIME, provided the student is eligible.

===2011===
Since 2011, the goal has been to select approximately 500 students total for the two Olympiads where 270 students qualify for the USA Mathematical Olympiad (USAMO) and 230 students qualify for the 2011 USA Junior Mathematical Olympiad (USAJMO). Selection for the USAMO and USAJMO are made according to the following rules:

1. U.S. citizens and students residing in the United States and Canada (with qualifying scores) are eligible to take the USAMO and USAJMO.

2. Selection to the USAMO will be based on the USAMO index which is defined as AMC 12 Score + 10 * AIME Score. Selection to the USAJMO will be based on the USAJMO index which is defined as AMC 10 Score + 10 * AIME Score.

3. Only AMC 12 A or AMC 12 B takers who are U.S. citizens and students residing in the United States and Canada will be eligible for the USAMO.

4. Only AMC 10 A or AMC 10 B takers who are U.S. citizens and students residing in the United States and Canada will be eligible for the USAJMO. This automatically limits Junior Math Olympiad participation to 10th graders and below. Students who take ONLY the AMC 10 test, whether AMC 10 A or AMC 10 B or both, will NOT be eligible for the USAMO regardless of their score on the AMC 10 or the AIME.

5. The approximately 260-270 individual students with the top AMC 12 based USAMO indices will be invited to take the USAMO. These indices will be selected from the pool of AMC 12 takers with an AIME score.

6. The approximately 230-240 individual students with the top AMC 10 based USAMO indices will be invited to take the USAJMO. These indices will be selected from the pool of AMC 10 takers with an AIME score after removing students who also took an AMC 12 test and qualified for the USAMO in rule 5. This means young students MUST take the USAMO if they qualify through an AMC 12 index.

7. We will select the student with the numerically largest index, whether AMC 10 based USAJMO index or AMC 12 based USAMO index, from each US state not already represented in either the USAMO or the USAJMO. The student will be invited to the USAMO if the numerically highest index in the state is AMC 12 based, and invited to the USAJMO if the index is AMC 10 based.

===2010===
Starting in 2010, the USA Mathematical Olympiad is split into two parts. The USA Mathematical Olympiad will be administered to approximately 270 students, mostly selected from top ranking AMC12 participants. The AMC10 only participants will take part in USA Junior Mathematical Olympiad.

1.Selection to the USAMO and JMO will be based on the USAMO index which is defined as AMC score + 10 * AIME score.

2.Only AMC 12A or AMC 12B takers are eligible for the USAMO (with the slight exception mentioned in item 5 below).

3.Only AMC 10A and AMC 10B takers are eligible for the JMO. (This automatically limits Junior Math Olympiad participation to 10th graders and below.)

4.Approximately the top 260 AMC12 based USAMO indices will be invited to the USAMO.

5.In order to find unrecognized young talent, AMC 10 takers who score 11 or more on the AIME will be invited to the USAMO. (In 2008 and 2009 this was 5 or 6 students).

6.Select the top index from any state not already represented in the USAMO.

7.Approximately the top 220-230 students with AMC10 based USAMO indices and not already selected to the USAMO via an AMC12 based index will be invited to the JMO.

&quot;Source: &quot;

===2008===
Selection for the USAMO will be made according to the following rules:

1. The goal is to select about 500 of the top scorers from this year&#x27;s AIME and AMC 12A, AMC 12B, AMC 10A and AMC 10B contests to participate in the USAMO.

2. Selection will be based on the USAMO index which is defined as 10 times the student&#x27;s AIME score plus the student&#x27;s score on the AMC 12 or the AMC 10.

3. The first selection will be the approximately 330 highest
USAMO indices of students taking the AMC 12A or AMC
12B contest.

4. The lowest AIME score among those 330 first selected will
determine a floor value. The second selection of approximately 160 USAMO participants will be among students in
the 10th grade and below who received an AIME score at least as high as the floor value. If there are more than 160
young students with a score above the floor value, then approximately 160 students will be selected from this group by using the USAMO index.

5 The student with the highest USAMO index from each state, territory, or U.S. possession not already represented in the selection of the first and second groups will be invited to take the USAMO.

6. To adjust for variations in contest difficulty, the number of students selected from A &amp; B contests will be proportional to the number of students who took the A &amp; B Contests.

7. In advising young students (in grade 10 or below) who desire to be selected for the USAMO whether to take the AMC 12 contest or the AMC 10 contest, please be aware of the following facts:

a. In 2007, among 506 students invited to take the USAMO, 229 were in 10th grade and below. Those students had scored 6 or greater on the AIME.

b. Among those 229 students, 87 had their AIME qualifying high score based on the AMC 12 and 142 had their AIME qualifying high score based on the AMC 10.

c. In 2007, among 8,312 students who took the AIME, 2,696 were in grades 10 and below. Of those, 998 qualified for the AIME from the AMC 12 and 1,698 qualified from the AMC 10.

===2006-2007===
Beginning in 2006, the USAMO was expanded to include approximately 500 students (around 430 were actually invited, read below) due to a proposal and sponsorship from the Art of Problem Solving website:
# The goal is to select about 500 of the top scorers from this year&#x27;s AIME and AMC 12A, AMC 12B, AMC 10A and AMC 10B contests to participate in the USAMO.
# Selection will be based on the USAMO index which is defined as 10 times the student&#x27;s AIME score plus the student&#x27;s score on the AMC 12 or the AMC 10.
# The first selection will be the approximately 240 highest USAMO indices of students taking the AMC 12A or AMC 12B contest.
# The lowest AIME score among those 240 first selected will determine a floor value. The second selection of approximately 120 USAMO participants will be among students in the 10th grade and below who received an AIME score at least as high as the floor value. If there are more than 120 young students with a score above the floor value, then approximately 120 students will be selected from this group by using the USAMO index.
# The student with the highest USAMO index from each state, territory, or U.S. possession not already represented in the selection of the first and second groups will be invited to take the USAMO.
# To adjust for variations in contest difficulty, the number of students selected from A &amp; B contests will be proportional to the number of students who took the A &amp; B Contests.
# The selection process is designed to favor students who take the more mathematically comprehensive AMC 12A and AMC 12B contests.*
&quot;Source: American Mathematics Competitions&quot;

*Statement 7 above (quoted from the AMC website) has recently come under controversy. During the selection for the 2006 USAMO, students who qualified by the floor value (in grades seven through ten) were qualified based on AMC scores as well (see * below) as their AIME scores, yet no distinction was made between the AMC 12 contest and the generally easier AMC 10 contest, giving those who took the AMC 10 an advantage over those who took the AMC 12. Students in grades seven through ten who were in the first selection of qualifiers (see 3. above) would still have qualified even if they had taken the AMC 10, except in the rare case that they set the floor themselves, making the AMC 12 still non-advantageous.

===2002-2005===
Since 2002, the following set of guidelines have been adopted for use in determining each year&#x27;s USAMO participants:

# The goal is to select about 250 of the top scorers from the prior AIME and AMC 12A, AMC 12B, AMC 10A and AMC 10B contests to participate in the USAMO.
# Selection will be based on the USAMO index which is defined as 10 times the student&#x27;s AIME score plus the student&#x27;s score on the AMC 12 or the AMC 10.
# The first selection (consisting of participants from all grade levels) will be the approximately 160 highest USAMO indices of students taking the AMC 12A or AMC 12B contest.
# The lowest AIME score among those 160 first selected will determine a floor value. The second selection of USAMO participants will be from the highest USAMO indices among students in grades seven through ten who got an AIME score at least as high as the floor value. 
# The student with the highest USAMO index from each state, territory, or U.S. possession not already represented in the selection of the first and second groups will be invited to take the USAMO.
# To adjust for variations in contest difficulty, the number of students selected from A &amp; B contests will be proportional to the number of students who took the (A &amp; B) Contests.
# The selection process is designed to favor students who take the more mathematically comprehensive AMC 12A and AMC 12B contests.

===2001 and earlier===
From 1998 to 2001, the following guidelines were used:

* First Group: The top 120 students.
* Second Group: The next 20 students in grades 11 and below.
* Third Group: The next 20 students in grades 10 or below.
* Fourth Group: The next 20 students in grades 9 or below.
* Fifth Group: One student from each state, one student from the combined U.S.A. Territories, and one student from the APO/FPO schools- if not represented in the first four groups.

===Recent qualification indices===

*In 2020, the AIME I took place as normal on March 11, 2020. However, the escalating COVID-19 Pandemic which had just shut down most U.S. Schools forced the postponement of the AIME II, which was scheduled for March 19, and the USA(J)MO which was scheduled for mid-April. Both competitions were eventually rescheduled in June as online competitions which students participated in at home and were renamed as the AOIME (American Online Invitational Mathematics Examination) and the USO(J)MO (United States Online (Junior) Mathematical Olympiad) respectively. They were sponsored by Art of Problem Solving (AoPS).

==Test format and scoring==
===Post-2002===

Since 2002, the USAMO has been a six-question, nine-hour mathematical proof competition spread out over two days. (The IMO uses the same format.) On each day, four and a half hours are given for three questions.

Each question is graded on a scale from 0 to 7, with a score of 7 representing a proof that is mathematically sound. Thus, a perfect score is 42 points. The number of perfect papers each year has varied depending on test difficulty. The top scorers are published by MAA and the recognition changes over the years. Please refer to Award section for more details.

The scale of 0 to 7 goes as follows:
*0 - No work, or completely trivial work
*1-2 - Progress on the problem, but not completely solved
*3-4 - All steps are present, but may lack clarity. (These scores are very rare.)
*5-6 - Complete solution with minor errors
*7 - Perfect solution

===1996 to 2001===
The test consisted of two three-problem sets. Three hours were given for each set; one set was given in the morning (9:00-12:00), and the other in the afternoon (1:00-4:00).

===1995 and earlier===
The test consisted of five problems to be solved in three and a half hours (earlier, three hours). Each problem was worth 20 points, for a perfect score of 100.

==Test procedures==
In most years, students have taken the USAMO at their respective high schools. Prior to 2002, the problems were mailed to the schools in sealed envelopes, not to be opened before the appointed time on the test day. Since 2002, test problems have been posted on the AMC website (see links below) fifteen minutes prior to the official start of the test. Student responses are then faxed back to the AMC office at the end of the testing period.

In 2002, the Akamai Foundation, as a major sponsor of the American Mathematics Competitions, invited all USAMO participants to take the test at a central event at MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts, all expenses paid. In addition, Akamai invited all 2002 USAMO participants who were not high school seniors (approximately 160 students) to take part in an enlarged Mathematical Olympiad Program (also known as &quot;MOP&quot;) program. Since holding this central event every year would be prohibitively expensive, it has been discontinued. In 2004 and 2005, however, funding was found to send 30 rising sophomores and juniors to MOP as well, in a program popularly called &quot;Red MOP.&quot;

Top USAMO and USAJMO participants are selected to MOP through multiple criteria of entry. As of 2016, the IMO team members, the next approximately 18 non-graduating USAMO students, the next approximately 12 USAMO students in 9th or 10th grade, the top approximately 12 students on the USAJMO, as well as some varying number of female contestants from the USAMO or USAJMO are invited to MOP, with middle school students invited on a case-by-case basis.

Here are the subjects on the test in different years by problem number (i.e. what subject each problem was from). Calculus, although allowed, is never required in solutions.

<text>The Counterterrorism Division (CTD) is a division of the National Security Branch of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. CTD investigates terrorist threats inside the United States, provides information on terrorists outside the country, and tracks known terrorists worldwide. In the wake of the September 11 attacks in 2001, CTD&#x27;s funding and manpower have significantly increased. 

The Division employs counterterrorism field operations organized into squads, the number of which varies according to the amount and diversity of activity in the local field office&#x27;s jurisdiction. Larger field offices, such as Los Angeles, maintain counterterrorism squads for each major terrorist group, as well as for domestic terrorism and terrorist financing, while smaller field offices combined such responsibilities across two to three squads.

==Leadership==
The Counterterrorism Division is headed by an assistant director, who reports to the executive assistant director of the FBI National Security Branch.

==Organization==
The Counterterrorism Division has several branches:
* Intelligence Branch
* Operations Branch I
* Operations Branch II
* Operations Branch III
* Analytical Branch
* Operational Support Branch

Operations Branch I is composed of two sections: International Terrorism Operations Section I (ITOS-I) and International Terrorism Operations Section II (ITOS-II). The ITOS-I covers al Qaeda terrorist activity on a regional basis in the United States and abroad. ITOS-II focuses on four non-al Qaeda groups: Palestinian rejectionist groups, Iran and Hezbollah, Iraq/Syria/Libya, and other global terrorist groups. ITOS II has a Central Intelligence Agency officer serving as Deputy Section Chief, and an FBI agent is detailed to the CIA&#x27;s Counterterrorism Center as that unit&#x27;s Deputy Director.

Operations Branch II includes three more disparate sections: the Domestic Terrorism Operations Section (DTOS), Exploitation Threat Section (XTS), and Terrorist Financing Operations Section (TFOS).
** The DTOS mission is overseeing and providing operational support to FBI domestic terrorism investigations nationwide.
** The TFOS is an operational and coordinating entity. It directs terrorism financing investigations and works jointly with partners to block and freeze assets. However, its primary role is to coordinate and support the financial components of terrorism investigations conducted by ITOS I and II. The TFOS mission is to identify, investigate, prosecute, disrupt, and incrementally dismantle all terrorist-related financial and fund-raising activities. The section is composed of four units:
*** Radical Fundamentalist Financial Investigative Unit
*** Domestic WMD and Global Financial Investigations Unit
*** Global Extremist Financial Investigations Unit
*** Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit.

The Analytical Branch includes two sections: the Counterterrorism Analysis Section (which supports Operations I and II) and the Terrorism Reports and Requirements Section (TRRS). The Branch also includes a Strategic Assessment and Analysis Unit, Production and Publications Unit.

The Operational Support Branch manages the CTD&#x27;s administrative and resource functions, FBI detailees to other agencies, and the Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force. The various local Joint Terrorism Task Forces falls under the domain of this branch.

==Notable former members==
*Mark F. Giuliano, former assistant director of the FBI Counterterrorism Division, former 15th Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
*Andrew McCabe (born 1968), former agent in the FBI Counterterrorism Division, former acting Director of the FBI
*Max Wise (born 1975), former agent in the FBI Counterterrorism Division, serving as a member of the Kentucky Senate

<text>Pentagon City station is an underground Washington Metro station in the Pentagon City neighborhood of Arlington, Virginia, United States. It serves the Blue and Yellow Lines.

==History==
The station was opened on July 1, 1977, along with 16 other stations as part of the opening of the – segment. 

On April 17, 2016, the Metroway bus rapid transit system was extended to Pentagon City, with the station becoming the northern terminus.

In February 2021, the Arlington County Board awarded a $6.5 million construction contract to add a second surface elevator to the station, with expected completion in spring 2025.

==Station layout==
Pentagon City station has two underground side platforms serving two tracks. The station has four entrances from the mezzanine level, which runs under Hayes Street: entrances from the east and west sides of Hayes Street via escalator, a direct entrance from the Fashion Centre at Pentagon City, and an entrance from the northeast corner of the 12th and Hayes Street intersection. The pedestrian tunnel for the latter entrance was built in 1984 but did not open to the public until 2018. Additionally, a provision exists at the station&#x27;s south end for a future second mezzanine, with knock-out panels visible above the tracks on the station&#x27;s south wall.

<doc id="662563" wikidata="Q161115" url="?curid=662563" title="Agave americana">
<text>Agave americana, commonly known as the century plant, maguey, or American aloe, is a flowering plant species belonging to the family Asparagaceae. It is native to Mexico and the United States, specifically Texas. This plant is widely cultivated worldwide for its ornamental value and has become naturalized in various regions, including Southern California, the West Indies, South America, the Mediterranean Basin, Africa, the Canary Islands, India, China, Thailand, and Australia.

Despite being called &quot;American aloe&quot; in common parlance, &quot;Agave americana&quot; is not a member of the same family as &quot;Aloe&quot;, although it falls under the same order, Asparagales.

==Description==
The common name &quot;century plant&quot; stems from its semelparous nature of flowering only once at the end of its long life. After flowering, the plant dies but produces adventitious shoots from the base, allowing its growth to continue. Although it is called the century plant, it typically lives only 10 to 30 years. It has a spread around with gray-green leaves measuring in length, each with a prickly margin and a heavy spike at the tip that can pierce deeply. Towards the end of its life, the plant produces a tall, branched stalk adorned with yellow blossoms, which can reach a height of .

==Taxonomy and naming==
Taxonomically, &quot;A. americana&quot; was described by Carl Linnaeus in the 1753 edition of &quot;Species Plantarum&quot;, and its binomial name is still in use today.

==Cultivation==
&quot;A. americana&quot; is cultivated as an ornamental plant, particularly valued for its large, dramatic mature form. It is often found in modernist, xeriscapes (drought-tolerant), and desert-style cactus gardens. It is popularly used in hot climates and areas prone to drought. The plant&#x27;s presence can evoke the ambiance of 18th- to 19th-century Spanish colonial and Mexican provincial areas in the Southwestern United States, California, and xeric regions of Mexico. In dry beach gardens in Florida and coastal areas of the Southeastern United States, it is a favored choice for landscaping.

When grown as a houseplant, &quot;A. americana&quot; is tolerant of light levels ranging from direct sunlight to shade and requires minimal watering. It undergoes a winter resting period at temperatures around . It thrives in a highly porous, sandy potting soil, should be allowed to dry out between waterings, and should be repotted annually in the spring.

===Subspecies and varieties===
The World Checklist of Selected Plant Families recognizes two subspecies and two varieties of &quot;A. americana&quot;. Additionally, there are several cultivars, including &#x27;Marginata,&#x27; &#x27;Mediopicta,&#x27; &#x27;Mediopicta Alba,&#x27; &#x27;Mediopicta Aurea,&#x27; &#x27;Striata,&#x27; and &#x27;Variegata.&#x27; Some of these cultivars, along with the parent species, have received the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

Two subspecies and two varieties of &quot;A. americana&quot; are:
*&quot;A. americana&quot; subsp. &quot;americana&quot;
*&quot;A. americana&quot; subsp. &quot;protamericana&quot; 
*&quot;A. americana&quot; var. &quot;expansa&quot; 
*&quot;A. americana&quot; var. &quot;oaxacensis&quot; 
*&quot;A. americana&quot; var. &quot;marginata&quot; 
*&quot;A. americana&quot; var. &quot;picta&quot; 
Cultivars include:
*&#x27;Marginata&#x27; with yellow stripes along the margins of each leaf
*&#x27;Mediopicta&#x27; with a broad cream central stripe
*&#x27;Mediopicta Alba&#x27; with a central white band
*&#x27;Mediopicta Aurea&#x27; with a central yellow band
*&#x27;Striata&#x27; with multiple yellow to white stripes along the leaves
*&#x27;Variegata&#x27; with white edges on the leaves.
(those marked , as well as the parent species, have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit).

==Uses==
===Cuisine===
&quot;Agave americana&quot; has various uses starting in pre-Columbian Mexico. If the flower stem is cut before flowering, a sweet liquid known as &quot;aguamiel&quot; (“) can be collected from the plant&#x27;s hollowed heart. This liquid can be fermented to produce the alcoholic drink called &quot;pulque&quot; or &quot;octli&quot; used in pre-Columbian Mexico.

In the tequila-producing regions of Mexico, agaves are known as &quot;mezcales&quot;. Mezcal refers to the high-alcohol product obtained through fermented agave distillation, and &quot;A. americana&quot; is among the several &quot;Agave&quot; species used for this purpose. The specific mezcal known as tequila is produced from &quot;Agave tequilana&quot;, commonly referred to as &quot;blue agave.&quot; Mezcal comes in various types, some of which may be flavored with the intensely pungent mezcal worm.

Mezcal and tequila, despite being produced from agave plants, differ from pulque in their sugar extraction techniques and classification as distilled spirits. In mezcal and tequila production, the sugars are obtained by heating the piñas (or hearts) of the plants in ovens, as opposed to collecting aguamiel from the cut stalk of the plant. Therefore, if pulque were to be distilled, it would not be classified as mezcal but rather as a distinct beverage.

Agaves are also found throughout Latin America and are used in similar ways. In Ecuador, the equivalent of &quot;pulque&quot; is known as &quot;guarango&quot;, which has recently been distilled as &quot;miske&quot;.

Agave nectar is marketed as a natural sweeteners with a low glycemic index, primarily due to its high fructose content.

=== Fibers ===
The leaves of &quot;A. americana&quot; yield fibers called &quot;pita&quot;, which are suitable for making ropes, nets, bags, sacks, matting, and coarse cloth. They are also used for leather embroidery in a technique known as &quot;piteado&quot;. Both pulque and maguey fiber played significant roles in the pre-Columbian economy of Mexico.

===Medicine===
&quot;Agave americana&quot; contains agavose, a sugar that is isomeric (similar) to sucrose () but with reduced sweetening power, as well as agavasaponins and agavosides. It is used in traditional medicine to treat various ailments, and as a laxative, diuretic, and diaphoretic. However, a comprehensive review of research literature using systematic methods (scientific review) did not find sufficient data to support its effectiveness or safety. It is important to note that &quot;A. americana&quot; can cause severe allergic dermatitis.

===Heraldry===
The plant holds heraldic significance and is featured in the coat of arms of Don Diego de Mendoza, a Native American governor of the village of Ajacuba, Hidalgo.

===Art===
Additionally, the Aztecs used the pulped leaves of &quot;A. americana&quot; to create paper. The fragments known as the Humboldt fragments were made using this technique.

<text>The white-throated guenon (Cercopithecus erythrogaster), also known as the red-bellied monkey and the red-bellied guenon, is a diurnal primate that lives on trees of rainforests or tropical areas of Nigeria and Benin.

The white-throated guenon is usually a frugivore but insects, leaves, and crops are also in its diet. It usually lives in small groups of four to five individual monkeys however, there have been groups of 30 discovered, and in cases, some males wander alone. It is arboreal, living in moist tropical forest and the wettest parts of dry tropical forest, however it can also be found in secondary bush and old farmland.

Males weigh from 3.5–4.5 kg and females weigh 2–4 kg. Females give birth to one offspring, which is a factor of decreasing population.

The white-throated guenon was once considered extinct due to constant hunting for the fur of its unique red belly and white front legs. Yet, a small group was found near the Niger River in 1988.

The white-throated guenon is still considered an endangered species due to its decreasing population. It is present within Nigerian forest reserves and sacred groves in Benin but hunting and logging restrictions are difficult to enforce or nonexistent. It is one of the species that live in the Guinean Forests of the West Africa Biodiversity Hotspot.

There are two subspecies of white-throated guenon:
*Red-bellied guenon, &quot;Cercopithecus erythrogaster erythrogaster&quot;
*Nigerian white-throated guenon, &quot;Cercopithecus erythrogaster pococki&quot;

<doc id="662578" wikidata="Q3522619" url="?curid=662578" title="The Scots Magazine">
<text>The Scots Magazine is a magazine containing articles on subjects of Scottish interest. It claims to be the oldest magazine in the world still in publication, although there have been several gaps in its publication history. It has reported on events from the defeat of the Jacobites through the Napoleonic wars to the Second World War and on to the creation of the new Scottish Parliament.

==History==
&quot;The Scots Magazine&quot; was originally published in January 1739. It was intended as a rival to the London-based &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, in order that &quot;our countrymen might have the production of every month sooner, cheaper and better collected than before&quot;. Its first issue, dated Monday 9 February 1739, cost 6d. and appeared in a blue cover with the motto &quot;Ne quid falsi dicere audeat, ne quid veri non audeat&quot;. Popular through the 18th century, it innovated a register of births, marriages and deaths, which other journals soon copied. From 1759 until 1765 it was edited by William Smellie.

In 1801 Archibald Constable bought the magazine, and three years later amalgamated it with the &quot;Edinburgh Magazine and Literary Miscellany&quot;. Its popularity, however, was eroded by competition with serious literary journals such as the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; and &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. By 1826 sales had declined to such a point that it was withdrawn. Attempts to revive the name as the &quot;New Scots Magazine&quot; in 1828 and the &quot;Scots Weekly Magazine&quot; in 1832 were unsuccessful.

In December 1887 publication resumed as a partial successor to &quot;The Scottish Church&quot; under a new owner (S. Cowan, Perth) and continued until 1893 when once again it was withdrawn. It was published between 1922 and 1924 as &quot;The Scottish Church&quot;. In 1924 publication as &quot;The Scots Magazine&quot; resumed, this time by the St Andrew&#x27;s Society (Glasgow). In 1927 D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. Ltd took over and have continued to publish it ever since.

With a monthly average readership of over 178,000, &quot;The Scots Magazine&quot; is the world&#x27;s best-selling Scottish-interest publication, containing articles on culture, history, nature, etc., and is targeted at Scots at home and abroad. In 2013, the magazine moved to a B5 format.

<text>The Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists (ANZCA) is responsible for examining and qualifying anaesthetists in Australia and New Zealand. The College maintains standards of practice in anaesthesia.

==Membership==
The College has approximately 3200 fellows; about a fifth are female. Among current trainees, the gender ratio is nearly even. In addition to Australia and New Zealand, the College has accredited training hospitals in Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia. In all, nearly eight hundred trainees learn in 140 ANZCA-accredited hospitals worldwide.

==History==
In 1952, the Australian Society of Anaesthetists, which had been established in 1934 to represent the emerging medical specialty of anaesthesia, was successful in establishing the
Faculty of Anaesthetists within the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons to undertake higher professional training in the specialty. An interim board was made up of five Society nominees: Drs Renton, Travers and Gillespie from Victoria, Dr. Daly of Sydney and Dr. Troup of Perth; and two College nominees, Sir Victor Hurley and Mr Henry Searby. An Acting Board was constituted in June 1953 with Dr. Douglas Renton as Dean and Dr. Harry Daly as Vice-Dean.
By 1992, the Faculty of Anaesthetists had grown to 2100 Fellows and
five hundred trainees, and represented Australia&#x27;s third-largest group
of medical specialists. This group dissociated itself from the College
of Surgeons in that year, forming the Australian and New Zealand
College of Anaesthetists. The College continues to train anaesthetists and maintain standards of practice in
Australia and the region, while the Society continues as the member-based professional organisation for the specialty.

==Training with the Australia and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists==
Completion of the Fellowship of the ANZCA requires:
* Completion of 5 years training in accredited training position in a hospital.
* Completion of the Primary Examination
* Completion of the Final Examination
* Completion of all specialised study units; including areas such as neuroanaesthesia, cardiac anaesthesia, paediatrics and obstetrics.

Most accredited hospitals are in Australia and New Zealand, and such hospitals are grouped into training rotations. Registrars move between two or more hospitals to complete the 5-year training period. The fifth and final year sees the trainee take on increasing responsibility and autonomy. Such final year trainees may be appointed to positions as &quot;Provisional Fellows&quot; if certain ANZCA requirements are met.

Those completing the above are eligible to become a Fellow of the ANZCA.Fellows of the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists are permitted to use the post nominals FANZCA.

<doc id="662583" wikidata="Q575973" url="?curid=662583" title="First Battle of Zurich">
<text>The First Battle of Zurich, from 4 to 7 June 1799, forced French General André Masséna to yield the city of Zurich to the Austrians, under Archduke Charles, and to retreat beyond the Limmat, where he managed to fortify his positions, which resulted in a stalemate.

The Helvetic Republic in 1798 became a battlefield of the French Revolutionary Wars. During the summer, Russian troops, under General Alexander Korsakov, replaced the Austrian troops, and at the Second Battle of Zurich, the French regained control of the city, along with the rest of Switzerland.

==Background==
===Political and diplomatic situation===

Initially, the rulers of Europe viewed the revolution in France as an event between the French king and his subjects, and not something in which they should interfere. As revolutionary rhetoric grew more strident, they declared the interest of the monarchs of Europe as one with the interests of Louis and his family; this Declaration of Pillnitz threatened ambiguous, but quite serious, consequences if anything should happen to the royal family. The French position became increasingly difficult. Compounding problems in international relations, French émigrés continued to agitate for support of a counter-revolution. On 20 April 1792, the French National Convention declared war on Austria. In this War of the First Coalition (1792–1798), France ranged itself against most of the European states sharing land or water borders with her, plus Portugal and the Ottoman Empire. Although the Coalition forces achieved several victories at Verdun, Kaiserslautern, Neerwinden, Mainz, Amberg and Würzburg, the efforts of Napoleon Bonaparte in northern Italy pushed Austrian forces back and resulted in the negotiation of the Peace of Leoben (17 April 1797) and the subsequent Treaty of Campo Formio (17 October 1797).

The treaty called for meetings between the involved parties to work out the exact territorial and remunerative details. Convened at a small town in the mid-Rhineland, Rastatt, the Congress quickly derailed in a mire of intrigue and diplomatic posturing. The French demanded more territory. The Austrians were reluctant to cede the designated territories. Compounding the Congress&#x27;s problems, tensions grew between France and most of the First Coalition allies. Ferdinand of Naples refused to pay agreed-upon tribute to France, and his subjects followed this refusal with a rebellion. The French invaded Naples and established the Parthenopean Republic. Encouraged by the French Republic, a republican uprising in the Swiss cantons led to the overthrow of the Swiss Confederation and the establishment of the Helvetic Republic. The French Directory was convinced that the Austrians were planning to start another war. Indeed, the weaker France seemed, the more seriously the Austrians, the Neapolitans, the Russians, and the English discussed this possibility. In mid-spring, the Austrians reached an agreement with Tsar Paul of Russia by which the legendary Alexander Suvorov would come out of retirement to assist Austria in Italy with another 60,000 troops.

===Outbreak of war in 1799===
The French Directory&#x27;s military strategy in 1799 called for offensive campaigns on all fronts: central Italy, northern Italy, the Swiss cantons, the upper Rhineland, and Holland. Theoretically, the French had a combined force of 250,000 troops, but this was on paper, not in the field. As winter broke in 1799, General Jean-Baptiste Jourdan and the Army of the Danube, at a paper strength of 50,000 and an actual strength of 25,000, crossed the Rhine between Basel and Kehl on 1 March. This crossing officially violated the Treaty of Campo Formio. The Army of the Danube advanced through the Black Forest and, by mid-March, established an offensive position at the western and northern edge of the Swiss Plateau by the village of Ostrach. André Masséna had already pushed into Switzerland with his force of 30,000, and successfully passed into the Grison Alps, Chur, and Finstermünz on the Inn river. Theoretically, his left flank was to link with Jourdan&#x27;s right flank, commanded by Pierre Marie Barthélemy Ferino, at the far eastern shore of Lake Constance.

The Austrians had arrayed their own army in a line from the Tyrol to the Danube. A force of 46,000 under command of Count Heinrich von Bellegarde formed the defence of the Tyrol. Another small Austrian force of 26,000 commanded by Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze guarded the Vorarlberg. The main Austrian Army—close to 80,000 troops under the command of Archduke Charles—had wintered in the Bavarian, Austrian, and Salzburg territories on the eastern side of the Lech river. At the battles of Ostrach (21 March) and Stockach (25 March), the main Austrian force pushed the Army of the Danube back into the Black Forest. Charles made plans to cross the upper Rhine at the Swiss town of Schaffhausen. Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze brought a portion (approximately 8,000) of his force west, leaving the rest to defend the Vorarlberg. At the same time, Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf, brought the left wing of the main Austrian force across the Rhine by Eglisau. They planned to unite with the main Austrian army, controlling the northern access points of Zürich and forcing an engagement with Masséna.

By mid-May, French morale was low. They had suffered terrible losses at Ostrach and Stockach, although these had been made up by reinforcements. Two senior officers of the Army of the Danube, Charles Mathieu Isidore Decaen and Jean-Joseph Ange d&#x27;Hautpoul, were facing courts-martial on charges of misconduct, proffered by their senior officer, Jourdan. Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte and Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr were sick, or claimed they were, and had left the army&#x27;s encampments to recover their health. Masséna&#x27;s force had been repelled by Hotze&#x27;s army at Feldkirch, and forced to fall back, and LeCourbe&#x27;s failure to push through against Bellegarde&#x27;s Austrian force in the Tyrol, meant Masséna had to pull his southern wing back as well as his center and northern wing, to maintain communication with the retreating armies on his flanks. At this point, also, the Swiss revolted again, this time against the French, and Zürich became the last defensible position Masséna could take.

===Dispositions===

After pushing the Army of the Danube out of the northern portion of the Swiss Plateau—the territory north of the Rhine and south of the Danube—following the battles at Ostrach and Stockach, Archduke Charles&#x27; sizable force—about 110,000 strong—crossed the Danube west of Schaffhausen, and prepared to join with the Vorarlberg Corps of Friedrich, Baron von Hotze before Zürich. During the month of May André Masséna, now commander of both the French Army of Helvetia and the Army of the Danube began pulling back his forces to concentrate towards Zürich. Charles crossed the Rhine at Stein with an advanced corps of 21 battalions and 13 squadrons under Nauendorf on 20 May, while two days later in the evening, Hotze crossed at Meiningen and Balzers with 18 battalions and 13 squadrons. On the 23rd the Archduke led 15 more battalions and 10 squadrons over the Rhine at Büsingen.

Learning of the double-pronged advance, Masséna seized the opportunity to drive a wedge between the two Austrian commands and on 25 May launched attacks against Hotze&#x27;s Corps to the east and Nauendorf&#x27;s to the north. Hotze&#x27;s advance troops under Petrasch were driven from Frauenfeld by Soult, while against the Archduke Michel Ney erupted from Winterthur, seized Andelfingen and threw back Nauendorf from Pfyn. Although the French were forced to withdraw on the appearance of Austrian reserves, nevertheless for a loss of 771 men they&#x27;d inflicted some 2,000 casualties and 3,000 prisoners on the Austrians.

On the 27th Ney was wounded and his men driven from Winterthur, Masséna thereafter concentrated his forces at Zürich, closely pressed by the Archduke Charles and Hotze.

By the end of the month the French were positioned: 
Soult&#x27;s Division was on the Zürichberg overlooking the open country to the north from an entrenched camp constructed by Andréossi. To his left Oudinot&#x27;s Division lay in support, with Gazan&#x27;s brigade in the town of Zürich itself. Tharreau&#x27;s Division continued the line across the Aare, with troops under Lorge&#x27; guarding the left of the Rhine to Basel. To Soult&#x27;s right Chabran guarded the south of Lake Zürich, with outposts stretched to link with the troops of Lecourbe&#x27; at Lucerne and the Andermatt valley. In all some 52,000 French and Swiss troops. The entrenchments on the Zürichberg were in a 5-mile long semi-circle from Riesbach to Hongg, but were incomplete.

Charles decided to launch his main attack by the surest (though difficult) route, directly against the Zürichberg with his left and centre, holding his right wing back to protect his line of retreat.

==Jelačić&#x27;s advance against Witikon==
On 2 June, Archduke Charles became aware that Hotze&#x27;s advance guard under Jelačić was advancing up against the main French positions near Witikon, and sent a message ordering him not to attack until all his other troops were ready; however, from 3:00 am on the 3rd, Jelačić was already engaged against Humbert&#x27;s brigade by the time these instructions arrived and the action soon grew into a desperate fight. After 4 hours Soult&#x27;s men were driven from Witikon and the fighting continued all through the day. As things began to look serious for Soult, Masséna, musket in hand, led a counter-attack at the head of his reserve grenadiers. The combined effort eventually pushed back the Austrians and secured the camp after a bloody fight, the French losing 500 killed and wounded, including Masséna&#x27;s Chief of Staff Chérin mortally wounded.

==Attack on the Zürichberg==

The next day on 4 June, Charles crossed the Glatt and launched a broad attack in five columns:
* On the Austrian left, the First column under Jelačić (five battalions and three squadrons) marched against Zürich along the high road and succeeded in breaking through the Rapperswil gate but was driven back by Gazan&#x27;s brigade of Oudinot&#x27;s Division, and despite repeated attacks made no further headway.
* To its right, the Second Column under Bey (four battalions and three squadrons) seized the village of Hirslanden and attempted to climb the slopes; however, the French under Brunet counterattacked and forced the Austrians back to join the First Column.
* The Third Column under the Prince of Lorraine found its direct route of march impractical and was diverted via Fällanden and Pfaffhausen. However, the attack failed before a murderous fire from the entrenchments.
* The Fourth Column under Hotze (seven battalions and 12 squadrons) crossed the Glatt at Dübendorf behind the third column, and advancing through Stettbach, drove the French from Schwamendingen.
* The Fifth Column under the Prince of Reuss (10 battalions and 20 squadrons) carried Seebach and Oerlikon then detached part of its command under Rosenberg on its left at Oerlikon to join in the assault on Zürich.

Oudinot, though missing half of his force in Zürich, nevertheless threw himself on Rosenberg, attempting to drive in the Austrian flank. After a desperate fight, the French were driven back, Oudinot carried from the field wounded by a ball in the chest. Charles&#x27; right flank under Nauendorf (15 battalions and 9 squadrons) remained held back to guard Glattfelden.

On the Zürichberg, Soult&#x27;s Division was assailed by three columns and pinned down to their trenches. Repeated assaults were beaten off and the fighting bogged down into an intense firefight. At 2:00 pm, Charles assembled five battalions from his reserve including his own Guard of honour and directed Olivier, Count of Wallis to lead these storming up the hill. Leaving one battalion to watch the bridges, Wallis led the other four up a steep and narrow ravine against the French defences. The combat degenerated into close hand-to-hand fighting, with soldiers using the butts of their muskets against the French abatis.

At last at 8:00 pm, after a desperate fight, the Austrians were able to break through and pour into the camp behind. Sword in hand, Soult and his staff placed themselves at the head of a few companies of troops, launched a counter-attack against the rear of the Austrian column and drove them back to the bottom of the hill. Masséna urged his artillery to redouble their efforts and brought up his reserve of grenadiers. The Austrian attack crumbled; those in the camp were scattered, those behind driven back.

Over the course of the day, Charles lost 2,000 men, including three generals wounded, and 1,200 prisoners. The French lost more than 1,200 killed and wounded.

==Aftermath==

After the bloody fighting on the 4th Charles fell back a short distance to recover and devise a second attack for the 6th. Masséna used the time on the 5th to regroup, and that night as the Austrians assembled for their attack, he withdraw to a strong position in front of Zürich, abandoning 28 guns commandeered from Zürich. His forces were now more concentrated, while the lake would oblige his opponent to divide his forces.

The second day of battle never came. At noon on the 6th, following a parley, the French were allowed to leave Zürich, Masséna withdrew to the Uetliberg and arrange his line along the banks of the Limmat. In Zürich, Charles found 150 cannons of various calibers. The outcome of the battle also damaged Austro-Russian relations, because Charles failed to follow up on the French defeat.

In terms of personnel, both sides lost a general: Louis Nicolas Hyacinthe Chérin and Olivier Wallis.

<text>Jerome Irving Wald (September 16, 1911 – July 13, 1962) was an American screenwriter and a producer of films and radio programs.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York, he had a brother and sons who were active in show business. He attended James Madison High School.

He began writing a radio column for the &quot;New York Evening Graphic&quot;, while studying journalism at New York University. This led to him producing several &quot;Rambling &#x27;Round Radio Row&quot; featurettes for Vitaphone, Warner Brothers&#x27; short subject division (1932–33).

===Screenwriter===
Wald&#x27;s first feature credit was for the Warners movie &quot;Twenty Million Sweethearts&quot; (1934); he provided the story along with Paul Finder Moss at Warners. Wald provided the story (along with Philip Epstein) for Universal&#x27;s &quot;Gift of Gab&quot; (1934).

Wald then signed with Warners where would be based for many years. He worked on the script for &quot;Maybe It&#x27;s Love&quot; (1935) and the Rudy Vallée musical &quot;Sweet Music&quot; (1935).

====Julius Epstein====
Wald worked on a series of scripts with Julius J. Epstein: the drama &quot;Living on Velvet&quot; (1935); &quot;In Caliente&quot; (1935); &quot;Broadway Gondolier&quot; (1935) (both uncredited); &quot;Little Big Shot&quot; (1935); &quot;Stars Over Broadway&quot; (1935); &quot;I Live for Love&quot; (1935); and &quot;Sons o&#x27; Guns&quot; (1936) with Joe E. Brown.

Other writers with whom Wald regularly worked were Sig Herzig and Warren Duff who were both on &quot;Sing Me a Love Song&quot; (1937).

====Richard Macaulay====
Wald worked on &quot;Ready, Willing and Able&quot; (1937) based on a story by Richard Macaulay. Wald, Macaulay, Duff and Herzig worked on &quot;Varsity Show&quot; (1937). Wald did some work on &quot;Ever Since Eve&quot; (1937).

Wald and Macaulay had both mostly worked on musicals but they had a big hit with the gangster film &quot;The Roaring Twenties&quot; (1939), with James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart, co-written with Robert Rossen.

They worked on &quot;Brother Rat and a Baby&quot; (1939) (uncredited); &quot;3 Cheers for the Irish&quot; (1940), a comedy; &quot;Torrid Zone&quot; (1940), with Cagney and Ann Sheridan; &quot;Flight Angels&quot; (1940); &quot;Brother Orchid&quot; (1940); &quot;They Drive by Night&quot; (1940) with George Raft and Bogart; &quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot; (1941), a comedy co written with Casey Robinson; &quot;Out of the Fog&quot; (1941) with Lupino, working with Rossen; &quot;Manpower&quot; (1941) with Raft, Edward G Robinson and Marlene Dietrich.

===Producer===
Wald was promoted to producer at the recommendation of Mark Hellinger. His first credit was &quot;Navy Blues&quot; (1941), which he also wrote with Macaulay.

Wald was associate producer on &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot; (1941), adapted by the Epsteins; &quot;All Through the Night&quot; (1942), with Bogart; &quot;Larceny, Inc.&quot; (1942) with Robinson; and &quot;Juke Girl&quot; (1942) with Sheridan and Ronald Reagan.

Wald was promoted to full producer, and soon established himself as one of the leading filmmakers on the lot: &quot;Across the Pacific&quot; (1942), with Bogart and director John Huston, written by Macaulay; &quot;George Washington Slept Here&quot; (1942) and &quot;The Hard Way&quot; (1943); he also contributed to the story of the latter, but had effectively given up writing.

Wald went on to produce &quot;Action in the North Atlantic&quot; (1943) with Bogart; &quot;Background to Danger&quot; (1943) with Raft; &quot;Destination Tokyo&quot; (1943) with Cary Grant and directed by Delmer Daves; &quot;In Our Time&quot; (1944) with Lupino; &quot;The Very Thought of You&quot; (1944) with Dennis Morgan and Eleanor Parker; &quot;Objective, Burma!&quot; (1945) with Errol Flynn; and &quot;Pride of the Marines&quot; (1945) with John Garfield.

Wald produced Joan Crawford&#x27;s first film at Warners, &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; (1945) which won her an Oscar and earned Wald an Oscar Nomination for Best Picture. He did her next film, &quot;Humoresque&quot; (1946), written by Clifford Odets and directed by Jean Negulesco.

Wald produced &quot;The Unfaithful&quot; (1947) with Ann Sheridan and director Vincent Sherman; &quot;Possessed&quot; (1947) with Crawford; &quot;Dark Passage&quot; (1947) with Bogart and Lauren Bacall for Daves; and &quot;To the Victor&quot; (1948) with Morgan and Dves.

He produced a series of classic films: &quot;Key Largo&quot; (1948) with Bogart, Bacall and Edward G. Robinson; &quot;Johnny Belinda&quot; (1948), which won an Oscar for star Jane Wyman; and &quot;Adventures of Don Juan&quot; (1948) with Flynn.

Wald&#x27;s credits then included &quot;One Sunday Afternoon&quot; (1949), with Morgan; &quot;John Loves Mary&quot; (1949) with Ronald Reagan; &quot;Flamingo Road&quot; (1949) with Crawford; Daves&#x27; &quot;Task Force&quot; (1949) with Gary Cooper; &quot;Always Leave Them Laughing&quot; (1949) with Milton Berle; and &quot;The Inspector General&quot; (1949) with Danny Kaye.

Wald produced &quot;Young Man with a Horn&quot; (1950) with Kirk Douglas; &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; (1950) with Morgan and Ginger Rogers; Sherman&#x27;s &quot;The Damned Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; (1950) with Crawford; &quot;Caged&quot; (1950), with Eleanor Parker; the first adaptation of &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; (1950); &quot;The Breaking Point&quot; (1950), from a Hemingway novel, with Garfield; and &quot;Storm Warning&quot; (1951), an anti-Ku Klux Klan film with Rogers, Reagan and Doris Day.

His story, Hot Air shot as &quot;Twenty Million Sweethearts&quot; (1934), was filmed as the Doris Day musical &quot;My Dream Is Yours&quot; (1949).

===Wald-Krasna Productions===
Wald and Norman Krasna formed Wald/Krasna Productions to release films through RKO Radio Pictures. Howard Hughes reportedly paid Warners $150,000 to release Wald from his contract with them. They were to make 12 films a year for five years with a budget of $50 million.

Their movies together included &quot;Two Tickets to Broadway&quot; (1951), a musical; &quot;The Blue Veil&quot; (1951), with Jane Wyman; &quot;Behave Yourself!&quot; (1952), a comedy with Shelley Winters; &quot;The Lusty Men&quot; (1952), a rodeo drama with Robert Mitchum; and &quot;Clash by Night&quot; (1953), from a play by Clifford Odets. Wald did some uncredited producing on &quot;Macao&quot; (1952) with Robert Mitchum.

Krasna and Wald dissolved their partnership because of interference from Howard Hughes, then head of RKO, in their productions.

===Columbia===
Wald went to Columbia in 1952 as vice president in charge of production.

At Columbia he produced &quot;Miss Sadie Thompson&quot; (1953) starring Rita Hayworth; &quot;Queen Bee&quot; (1955) with Crawford, directed by Ranald MacDougall; &quot;The Harder They Fall&quot; (1956), Bogart&#x27;s last movie; and &quot;The Eddy Duchin Story&quot; (1957), a biopic with Tyrone Power and Kim Novak.

===Jerry Wald Productions at 20th Century Fox===
Wald signed a contract with 20th Century Fox where he established Jerry Wald Productions. He had a solid hit with &quot;An Affair to Remember&quot; (1957) starring Grant and Deborah Kerr, and some minor ones with &quot;No Down Payment&quot; (1957) directed by Martin Ritt, and &quot;Kiss Them for Me&quot; (1957) with Grant. Wald had one of the biggest successes of his career with &quot;Peyton Place&quot; (1957), directed by Mark Robson.

Wald also produced &quot;The Long, Hot Summer&quot; (1958) with Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward from the novel by William Faulkner for Ritt; &quot;In Love and War&quot; (1958), a war film with Robert Wagner and Jeffrey Hunter directed by Philip Dunne; &quot;Mardi Gras&quot; (1958) a musical with Pat Boone; and &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; (1959), more Faulkner from Ritt with Woodward and Yul Brynner.

During this time Wald told the press that a filmmaker&#x27;s motto should be &quot;Don&#x27;t offend the innocent but don&#x27;t frustrate the intelligent.&quot;

Wald produced &quot;The Best of Everything&quot; (1959) with Crawford, directed by Negulesco; &quot;Hound-Dog Man&quot; (1959), an attempt to make a film star of Fabian Forte; &quot;Beloved Infidel&quot; (1959) with Kerr and Gregory Peck; &quot;The Story on Page One&quot; (1959), written and directed by Odets, starring Hayworth.

===Final Films===
Wald spent a period in England to make &quot;Sons and Lovers&quot; (1960). Back in Hollywood he produced &quot;Let&#x27;s Make Love&quot; (also 1960), Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s penultimate film; &quot;Return to Peyton Place&quot; (1961); &quot;Wild in the Country&quot; (1961), an Elvis Presley film written by Odets and directed by Dunne; &quot;Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation&quot; (1962) starring James Stewart and Fabian; &quot;Hemingway&#x27;s Adventures of a Young Man&quot; (1962) for Ritt with Richard Beymer; &quot;The Stripper&quot; (1963) with Woodward and Beymer.

He also produced the Academy Awards telecast twice, the ceremonies for 1957 and 1958.

Among the films Wald was working on at the time of his death were adaptations of &quot;The Enemy Within&quot;, &quot;Ulysses&quot; and &quot;A High Wind in Jamaica&quot;.

==Awards==
He received four Academy Award nominations as producer of the following nominees for Best Picture: &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot;, &quot;Johnny Belinda&quot;, &quot;Peyton Place&quot; and &quot;Sons and Lovers&quot;. Although he never won a competitive Academy Award, he was awarded the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award in 1949.

==Impact==
Wald is often cited as the real-life inspiration for the character Sammy Glick in the novel &quot;What Makes Sammy Run&quot; by Budd Schulberg.

Jerry Wald, was a close friend of Joan Crawford in the forties, offering her many parts including the title role in &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot;, which he produced. He convinced director Michael Curtiz that she would succeed in the role, which brought her the Oscar for Best Actress in 1946. Jerry Wald not only produced &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot;, but also &quot;Humoresque&quot; (1946), considered one of the best performances of Crawford&#x27;s career, &quot;Across the Pacific&quot; (1942), &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot; (1942), &quot;Possessed&quot; (1947), &quot;Flamingo Road&quot; (1949), &quot;The Damned Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; (1950). After her career at Warner&#x27;s fizzled out slowly even though she wished to remain with Warner&#x27;s, after years of reinventing herself, she bought out her contract.

He is alleged to have responded, when asked why he attended Harry Cohn&#x27;s funeral, “Just to be sure the bastard was dead”

==Marriage==
Wald married his wife Constance Emily &quot;Connie&quot; Polan (née Polan) on Christmas Day 1941; the couple had two sons. She became a California socialite and hostess whose dinner parties, frequented by her friend Audrey Hepburn, continued after her husband died.

==Death==
Wald had been ill for the last few years of his life. He died, aged 50, at his home in Beverly Hills, California from a heart attack.

<text>Pentagon station is a split platform station on the Washington Metro located adjacent to The Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia. The station was opened on July 1, 1977, and is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. Providing service for both the Blue and Yellow Lines, the station is where the two lines diverge and thus acts as a transfer point. Northbound, both lines rise above ground, with the Blue Line serving the station, and the Yellow Line crossing the Potomac River into the District of Columbia.

The station opened on July 1, 1977 with the completion of of rail between National Airport and RFK Stadium.

Photography is not allowed anywhere on the station grounds.

==Bus service==
Pentagon station is also a major bus hub in northern Virginia. The current bus facility opened in 2001 as part of the Pentagon Renovation Program.

== Station layout ==
The station is located underground, adjacent to The Pentagon, and formerly had a direct (but secure) entrance to the Pentagon and its underground shopping center. This entrance was closed in 2001 as part of the Pentagon Renovation Program. Access to the Pentagon is now gained via a new secured entrance facility above ground near the bus depot and the entrances to the subway station. The new exit features signage displayed at Gallery Place-Chinatown and newer stations.

Pentagon is one of two stations (the other being the Rosslyn station) at which trains going one direction are boarded on a different station level than trains going the other direction, as a way to prevent an at-grade crossing. This is because the Blue and Yellow lines split apart an extremely short distance from the station.

An indicator sign at the north end of the station flashes to inform passengers of the arriving train&#x27;s destination, showing Blue for , and Yellow for . This feature is only used at final transfer stations; another example being .

South of the station, two empty tunnels diverge from the tracks towards Columbia Pike for future extension, but the plans were later dropped.

== Incidents ==
=== 2010 ===
On March 4, 2010, a gunman, identified as John Patrick Bedell, who espoused anti-government views, shot and wounded two Pentagon police officers at a security checkpoint in the Pentagon station. The officers returned fire, striking him in the head. Bedell died the next day, on March 5, 2010.

=== 2021 ===
At 10:40 a.m. EST, on August 3, 2021, a stabbing occurred, killing officer George Gonzalez and leading to a lockdown of the Pentagon that was later lifted. The perpetrator, 27-year-old Austin William Lanz, shot and killed himself using Gonzalez&#x27;s service weapon. In an apology issued by Lanz&#x27;s family, they stated that in his final few months, he suffered from &quot;many mental health challenges&quot;. There was a warrant out for Lanz&#x27;s arrest due to an incident months earlier, in which Lanz broke into a Georgia home with a crowbar.

<doc id="662590" wikidata="Q1029967" url="?curid=662590" title="Planet of the Daleks">
<text>Planet of the Daleks is the fourth serial of the tenth season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which was first broadcast in six weekly parts on BBC1 from 7 April to 12 May 1973. It was the first Dalek story to be written by their creator Terry Nation since 1965’s &quot;The Daleks&#x27; Master Plan&quot;.

Continuing from the events of the serial &quot;Frontier in Space&quot;, the story involves a small team of Daleks plotting to revive an army of Daleks which are being kept in suspended animation on the planet Spiridon.

==Plot==
The Third Doctor has been wounded after being shot by the Master. Jo helps the Doctor into the TARDIS, where he sends a message to the Time Lords before he collapses then falls into a coma. The Time Lords direct the TARDIS to the planet Spiridon, where Jo leaves the TARDIS in an attempt to find help, and encounters a party of Thals, the Daleks&#x27; oldest enemy. The Thals rescue the Doctor from the TARDIS, the outside of which has been overtaken by a lethal fungus, and explain to the Doctor that the Daleks have set up a research base on the planet to gain the native Spiridons&#x27; power of invisibility.

The Thals take the Doctor back to their ship, but the Daleks arrive first, destroy the ship and capture the Doctor. He presumes Jo to be dead, but fortunately she had already been removed from the ship by a Spiridon named Wester, having become infected with the fungus, which Wester cures. As the Doctor is held captive in the Dalek base, another party of Thals arrives and informs the first group that their intelligence had been mistaken; there isn&#x27;t just a small research team of Daleks on the planet, but an army of ten thousand, which will form a galactic invasion force.

As the Doctor and a fellow captive Thal break out of their cell, the other Thals break into the base, and the Doctor confirms the existence of the Dalek army, before the group escapes and reunites with Jo and Wester. The Doctor realises that making use of the planet&#x27;s natural ice volcanos will be key to defeating the Daleks. Meanwhile, a Dalek ship commanded by a Supreme Dalek lands on the planet, and the Supreme executes the lead Dalek for failing to deal with the Doctor and the Thals.

The group sneaks back into the base, where the Daleks are preparing a bacterial weapon in a laboratory chamber to destroy all life on the planet. However, Wester unleashes the weapon prematurely, ensuring he is its only casualty and creating a no-win situation for the Daleks, where those previously inoculated in the laboratory cannot leave or open the chamber, lest they infect their bretheren. The Doctor, Jo, and the Thals return to the cavern where the Dalek army is being brought out of stasis, and the Doctor sets off an explosion that floods the entire base with liquid ice, freezing the army. The Thals take the Supreme Dalek&#x27;s ship to return to their home world of Skaro, while the Doctor and Jo narrowly get away in the TARDIS, though the Supreme Dalek vows that they are not defeated, and that they will someday thaw their army back out. The Doctor offers to take Jo anywhere in time and space, but after their recent adventures, Jo is happy to go back to Earth.

The story was originally commissioned as &quot;Planet of the Daleks&quot;, but during production it briefly changed to &quot;Destination: Daleks&quot;. Episodes 2 &amp; 4 do not feature a reprise of the previous episode&#x27;s cliffhanger ending, while the reprises in Episodes 3 and 5 are re-performances. Though this latter technique was commonplace in 1960s episodes, by this time in the programme&#x27;s history it was an approach almost never used.

The Dalek Supreme in this story was a modified prop from the film &quot;Daleks&#x27; Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.&quot; (1966) that had been given to Terry Nation. Its eyestalk has been replaced with a conventional torch, which flashes when it speaks.

For many years Episode 3 of the serial existed in the BBC Archives only as a black-and-white 16mm telerecording, as the 625-line colour PAL transmission master videotape for that episode was wiped for reuse by the BBC in 1976. Episode 3 was restored to full colour in 2008, using a combination of computer colourisation by Legend Films with software developed by the Colour Recovery Working Group. This version was released on DVD in 2009. The colour masters for the other five episodes are still extant.

===Cast notes===
Bernard Horsfall had previously appeared as Lemuel Gulliver in &quot;The Mind Robber&quot; (1968) and as the First Time Lord in &quot;The War Games&quot; (1969). He appeared once more in &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot; (1976), as Chancellor Goth. All these serials were directed by David Maloney.

Prentis Hancock had appeared as a reporter in &quot;Spearhead from Space&quot; (1970), and would return as Salamar in &quot;Planet of Evil&quot; (1975) and as the Shrieve Captain in &quot;The Ribos Operation&quot; (1978).

==Broadcast and reception==

The serial was repeated on BBC One on Friday evenings between 5 November and 17 December 1993, as part of &quot;Doctor Who and the Daleks&quot;, celebrating 30 years of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Each episode was preceded by a specially made 5 min vignette, which were &#x27;Bigger on the Inside&#x27;, &#x27;The Antique Doctor Who Roadshow&#x27;, &#x27;Missing in Action&#x27;, &#x27;I Was That Monster&#x27;, &#x27;The Master&#x27; and &#x27;U.N.I.T. Recruitment Film&#x27;. The repeat of Episode 3 of &quot;Planet of the Daleks&quot; on 19 November 1993 was shown in black and white, the only time since June 1969 that a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode has been broadcast in black and white on BBC One. The ratings achieved were 3.6, 4.0, 3.9, 3.3, 3.3 and 3.5 million viewers, respectively.

Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping gave an unfavourable review of the serial in &quot;The Discontinuity Guide&quot; (1995), writing that it was &quot;a typical coincidence-based Dalek story of hammy deaths and ridiculous escapes. A reworking of the themes and set pieces of &quot;The Daleks&quot;, with pacifism and an anti-nuclear stance becoming weak monologues on bravery and caution.&quot; In 2010, Mark Braxton of &quot;Radio Times&quot; awarded it three stars out of five, describing &quot;Planet of the Daleks&quot; as &quot;an exciting story, but a tawdry spectacle&quot; with it being &quot;continually compromised&quot; in production values. While he found that some elements of the story were enjoyable, he felt that it lacked emotional continuity and the Daleks did not impress. DVD Talk&#x27;s John Sinnott found the story more enjoyable than &quot;Frontier in Space&quot;, praising the way Nation &quot;filled the plot with creative other-worldly creatures and devices and used them nicely to move the story&quot;. In the book &quot;Doctor Who: The Episode Guide&quot;, Mark Campbell also rated it as better than &quot;Frontier in Space&quot;, awarding it eight out of ten, concluding &quot;a believable jungle setting and ambitious (if unoriginal) ideas make this live-action comic strip romp breeze along in fine style.&quot;

==Commercial releases==

===In print===
A novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in October 1976. The novelisation opens with the cliffhanger from &quot;Frontier in Space&quot; of a comatose Doctor pursuing the Daleks through space, even though this was removed from the &quot;Space War&quot; novelisation. A German translation was published in 1980.

In 1995 an abridged version of the novel was issued by BBC Audio as an audio book, read by Jon Pertwee. It was later reissued on the MP3-CD release &quot;Tales from the TARDIS Volume 2&quot;. An unedited audio book version was released in June 2013, narrated by actor and writer Mark Gatiss, with Dalek voices performed by Nicholas Briggs.

===Home media===
This story, together with &quot;Revelation of the Daleks&quot; was released on VHS in a special Dalek tin set in 1999, with episode 3 in black and white. The stories were released on VHS individually in North America. It was released on DVD alongside the previous story, &quot;Frontier in Space&quot;, in the box set &quot;Dalek War&quot; on 5 October 2009, with episode 3 now restored to full colour using the pioneering chroma dot recovery process and some more traditional colourisation techniques. In July 2019 the story was released for the first time on Blu-ray as part of the Season 10 boxset. It featured optional updated visual effects and 5.1 Surround Sound. In November 2020, it was released as part of the &quot;Time Lord Victorious: Road to the Dark Times&quot; blu-ray set along with &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot;, &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot;. &quot;State of Decay&quot;, &quot;The Curse of Fenric&quot;, &quot;The Runaway Bride&quot; and &quot;The Waters of Mars&quot;.

<doc id="662592" wikidata="Q2692553" url="?curid=662592" title="Archbishop of Cologne">
<text>The archbishop of Cologne governs the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cologne in western North Rhine-Westphalia. Historically the archbishop was &quot;ex officio&quot; one of the prince-electors of the Holy Roman Empire and ruled the Electorate of Cologne.

Since the early days of the Catholic Church, there have been ninety-four bishops and archbishops of Cologne. Seven of these ninety-four retired by resignation, including four resignations which were in response to impeachment. Eight of the bishops and archbishops were coadjutor bishops before they took office. Seven individuals were appointed as coadjutors freely by the pope. One of the ninety-four moved to the Curia, where he became a cardinal. Additionally, six of the archbishops of Cologne were chairmen of the German Bishops&#x27; Conference.

Cardinal Rainer Woelki has been the archbishop of Cologne since his 2014 transfer from Berlin, where he was also cardinal archbishop.

== Bishops and archbishops of Cologne ==

===Bishops of Colonia Agrippina, 88–784===
All names before Maternus II are to be approached with considerable skepticism, as little contemporary evidence is available. Maternus was present at a council in Rome in 313. The bishops between Severinus and Charentius are also apocryphal. Domitianus was the Bishop of Maastricht (Mosa Traiectum). The given dates of office before Gunther are also conjectural, at best.

<doc id="662596" wikidata="Q2361208" url="?curid=662596" title="Ætheling">
<text>Ætheling (; also spelt aetheling, atheling or etheling) was an Old English term (&quot;æþeling&quot;) used in Anglo-Saxon England to designate princes of the royal dynasty who were eligible for the kingship.

The term is an Old English and Old Saxon compound of &quot;aethele&quot;, &quot;æþele&quot; or &quot;(a)ethel&quot;, meaning &quot;noble family&quot;, and &quot;-ing&quot;, which means &quot;belonging to&quot;. It was usually rendered in Latin as &quot;filius regis&quot; (king&#x27;s son) or the Anglo-Latin neologism &quot;clito&quot;.

Ætheling can be found in the Suffolk toponym of Athelington.

== Meaning and use in Anglo-Saxon England ==
During the earliest years of the Anglo-Saxon rule in England, the word &quot;ætheling&quot; was probably used to denote any person of noble birth. Its use was soon restricted to members of a royal family. The prefix &quot;æþel-&quot; formed part of the name of several Anglo-Saxon kings, for instance Æthelberht of Kent, Æthelwulf of Wessex and Æthelred of Wessex, and was used to indicate their noble birth. According to a document which probably dates from the 10th century, the weregild of an ætheling was fixed at 15,000 thrymsas, or 11,250 shillings, which was equal to that of an archbishop and one-half of that of a king.

The annal for 728 in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; referred to a certain Oswald as an ætheling, due to his great-great-grandfather having been King of Wessex. From the 9th century, the term was used in a much narrower context and came to refer exclusively to members of the house of Cerdic of Wessex, the ruling dynasty of Wessex, most particularly the sons or brothers of the reigning king. According to historian Richard Abels, &quot;King Alfred transformed the very principle of royal succession. Before Alfred, any nobleman who could claim royal descent, no matter how distant, could strive for the throne. After him, throne-worthiness would be limited to the sons and brothers of the reigning king.&quot; In the reign of Edward the Confessor, Edgar the Ætheling received the appellation as the grandson of Edmund Ironside, but that was at a time when for the first time in 250 years there was no living ætheling according to the strict definition.
&quot;Ætheling&quot; was also used in a poetic sense to mean &quot;a good and noble man&quot;. Old English verse often used &quot;ætheling&quot; to describe Christ, as well as various prophets and saints. The hero of the 8th century &quot;Beowulf&quot; is introduced as an &quot;ætheling&quot;, possibly in the sense of a relative of the King of the Geats, though some translators render &quot;ætheling&quot; as &quot;retainer&quot;. Since many early Scandinavian kings were chosen by competition or election, rather than primogeniture, the term may have been reserved for a person qualified to compete for the kingship.

== Other uses and variations ==
The term was occasionally used after the Norman conquest of England and then only to designate members of the royal family. The Latinised Germanic form, &quot;Adelin(us)&quot; was used in the name of the only legitimate son and heir of Henry I of England, William Adelin, who drowned in the &quot;White Ship&quot; disaster of 1120.

It was also sometimes translated into Latin as &quot;clito&quot;, as in the name of William Clito. It may have been derived from the Latin &quot;inclitus/inclutus&quot;, &quot;celebrated&quot;.

The historian Dáibhí Ó Cróinín has proposed that the idea of the &quot;rígdomna&quot; in early medieval Ireland was adopted from the Anglo-Saxon, specifically Northumbrian, concept of the &quot;ætheling&quot;. The earliest use of &quot;tanaíste ríg&quot; was in reference to an Anglo-Saxon prince in about 628. Many subsequent uses related to non-Irish rulers, before the term was attached to Irish kings-in-waiting.

In Wales, the variant &quot;edling&quot; was used to signify the son chosen to be the heir apparent.

<text>Herbert &quot;Herbie&quot; Coleridge (7 October 1830 – 23 April 1861) was an English philologist, technically the first editor of what ultimately became the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;. He was a grandson of the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

==Biography==
He was the son of Sara and Henry Nelson Coleridge. He earned a double first in Classics and Mathematics at Balliol College, Oxford. After graduation, he became a barrister, but, living off a small annuity, devoted most of his time and energy to linguistic studies. At age 27, as a member of the Philological Society, he formed a committee with Richard Chenevix Trench and Frederick Furnivall to identify and research words unlisted and undefined in English dictionaries of the period. The efforts of this committee eventually led to the development of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;. A dedicated editor, he died of tuberculosis at age 30 after completing some fundamental work for the project.

He died on 23 April 1861 at Chester Place, Regents Park and is buried, with his parents and grandparents, in the crypt of St Michael&#x27;s, Highgate. The coffins were moved in 1961 from the Highgate School Chapel.

<text>Arlington Cemetery station is a side platformed Washington Metro station in Arlington, Virginia, United States. The station was opened on July 1, 1977, and is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). The station provides service for only the Blue Line, and is located at the entrance to Arlington National Cemetery, underneath Memorial Drive. There is no public parking near the station except at the cemetery, which is reserved for cemetery visitors. It is the only station that closes earlier than the rest of the system, closing at 7 PM from October to March, and 10 PM from April to September.

The station is one of three stations to be exclusively serviced by the Blue Line. The rest of the Blue Line&#x27;s stations are shared with the Yellow Line to the south (except for two of the southernmost stations), and with the Orange Line and Silver Line to the north.

==History==

The station opened on July 1, 1977. Its opening coincided with the completion of of rail between National Airport and RFK Stadium and the opening of the Capitol South, Crystal City, Eastern Market, Farragut West, Federal Center SW, Federal Triangle, Foggy Bottom–GWU, L&#x27;Enfant Plaza, McPherson Square, National Airport, Pentagon, Pentagon City, Potomac Avenue, Rosslyn, Smithsonian, and Stadium–Armory stations.

In May 2018, Metro announced an extensive renovation of platforms at twenty stations across the system. The platforms at the Arlington Cemetery station were rebuilt from February 13 to May 23, 2021.

On March 19, 2020, this station closed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The station reopened on August 23, 2020.

Between January 15 to January 21, 2021, this station was closed because of security concerns related to the 2021 Inauguration.
== Station layout ==
Arlington Cemetery is unique in its design, located just below ground level and only covered by a bridge carrying Memorial Drive. It is also one of two stations with three levels (the other being Fort Totten). Escalators from Memorial Drive go down two levels to the mezzanine, where customers may purchase SmarTrip cards at vending machines and pass through fare control. A knock-out panel exists between the exits at the mezzanine level. Escalators on the other side of fare control then go up to the side platforms. Elevators go directly to the platforms with one fare gate for each elevator at platform level.

<text>Larry McCormick (January 4, 1940 – May 3, 2011) was a Canadian politician. He was born in Enterprise, Ontario.

McCormick was a member of the Liberal Party of Canada in the House of Commons of Canada, representing the riding Hastings—Frontenac—Lennox and Addington from 1993 to 2004. Benefiting from vote-splitting between the Progressive Conservatives and the Reform Party, he was the first Liberal since 1935 to win a seat in this area in the House of Commons. McCormick was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food.

McCormick&#x27;s seat was merged with parts of the former riding of Lanark—Carleton, forcing him into a contest with that riding&#x27;s Conservative incumbent, Scott Reid in the 2004 election. With the end of vote-splitting on the right, Reid won the seat by over 10,000 votes.

Before serving in Ottawa, McCormick owned and operated McCormick&#x27;s Country Store on County Road 4 in Camden East. He was married to wife Reta and had one child, a daughter, Kayla.

<text>Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) is a British private detective television series, starring Mike Pratt and Kenneth Cope respectively as the private detectives Jeff Randall and Marty Hopkirk. The series was created by Dennis Spooner and produced by Monty Berman, and was first broadcast in 1969 and 1970. In the United States, it was given the title My Partner the Ghost.

ITC Entertainment produced a single series of 26 episodes in 1968 and 1969, which was aired from September 1969 to March 1970. The pilot episode was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on 19 September 1969 by ATV in the Midlands. London Weekend Television broadcast the pilot two days later on 21 September 1969.

The series was remade in 2000, starring Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer.

==Plot==
In the initial episode, &quot;My Late Lamented Friend and Partner&quot;, Marty Hopkirk is murdered during an investigation but returns as a ghost. He chooses his partner, Jeff Randall, to be the only main character able to see or hear him, in order to solve his own murder. Unfortunately, Marty chooses at the end of the episode not to return to his grave before dawn and is therefore to be trapped on earth for a century. Marty&#x27;s wife Jeannie will continue in the series as Jeff&#x27;s secretary. Later in the series, certain minor characters are also able to see Marty in various circumstances, such as mediums, drunks, or those under hypnosis.

==Production==
===Conception===
The idea for the series was conceived by Dennis Spooner, who had an office adjoining producer Monty Berman at Elstree Studios. They had already collaborated on &quot;The Champions&quot;. In March 1968, the pair conceived &quot;Department S&quot;. Spooner&#x27;s interest in the paranormal, inspired by several feature films, contemplated the possibility of a television series featuring a ghost, and he thought a detective series would offer greater scope for storylines.

The idea was put to Head of ATV Lew Grade but he was not enthusiastic as the series lacked a leading American, which he felt would inhibit overseas sales. However, the synopsis caught the eye of Ralph Smart, who had worked on &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;, &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;, and &quot;Danger Man&quot; and he wanted to write the pilot. This convinced Lew Grade to green-light the series.

===Casting===
The role of Jeff Randall, originally named Steven Randall, was considered for the comedian Dave Allen who had made &quot;Tonight with Dave Allen&quot; for Lew Grade&#x27;s ATV. When Dave Allen signed for the BBC, attention turned to Mike Pratt, who had appeared in a number of episodes of various ITC series, and he was deemed to be right for the part by the production team, including Cyril Frankel, creative consultant on the series.

Marty Hopkirk proved to be more difficult to cast, and several actors were considered after the creators scoured the pages of casting resources Spotlight. Cyril Frankel was at a new Italian restaurant in Soho, London and sitting at the next table was Kenneth Cope, with his wife, and Cyril Frankel thought he would be right for the part. Cyril Frankel told Monty Berman, and then directed a screen test, and Kenneth Cope got the part.

Jean Hopkirk, not in the original concept, is portrayed by Australian actress Annette Andre. She was well known to the production team, having appeared in six episodes of &quot;The Saint&quot; as well as &quot;The Baron&quot;. She had been short listed for one of the lead roles in &quot;The Champions,&quot; but lost to Alexandra Bastedo, reportedly at the whim of an American CBS executive.

===Filming and locations===
Filming commenced with the pilot in May 1968 with the aim to shoot a 48-minute episode over a fortnight working Monday to Friday from 8:30am to 5:30pm with some filming on alternate Sundays. The bulk of filming with the main cast was on two sound stages at ABC Elstree in Borehamwood where &quot;Department S&quot; and other series were also in production. Establishing shots would use library footage. Location sequences were usually filmed by a second unit using stand-ins or the guest cast who were only needed for one episode filmed by one director while the main cast were completing the previous episode with another director. To keep costs down, a simple jump cut was used to make Marty Hopkirk disappear and reappear. Walking through walls was costly and time consuming using an image reflected on plain glass at an angle in front of the camera often used in the theatre called Pepper&#x27;s ghost.

The exterior of the Randall &amp; Hopkirk&#x27;s office was a doorway at the side of Adam&#x27;s Furniture Fabric on the corner of Kymberly Road and Springfield Road in Harrow, now completely redeveloped as St George&#x27;s Shopping Centre. Jeff Randall&#x27;s flat was located at Hanover House, close to the corner of St John&#x27;s Wood High Street, and Jean Hopkirk&#x27;s flat was on Lauderdale Road, Maida Vale, London.

Numerous country houses in the northern Greater London and Hertfordshire area were used for the external shots of the many mansions featured in the series. In the episode &quot;For the Girl Who Has Everything&quot;, the exterior of Hilfield Castle in Aldenham was used for Kim Wentworth&#x27;s (Lois Maxwell&#x27;s) home. The Tudor-looking Edgwarebury Hotel on Barnet Lane in Elstree, now The Manor Elstree, was used in the episodes &quot;Who Killed Cock Robin?&quot; and &quot;The House on Haunted Hill&quot; and a plethora of other ITC series. The exterior of the Lambert Clinic in the comical episode &quot;A Disturbing Case&quot;, written by Mike Pratt himself, is now the Institute of Grocery Distribution in Letchmore Heath, Hertfordshire. The Seaton Residence, a large white house with Doric columns at the front used in &quot;The Smile Behind the Veil&quot; episode is the Dyrham Park Country Club, the club house of a golf club in Galley Lane, Barnet. Woburn Abbey in Woburn, Bedfordshire, is featured in the episode &quot;The Man from Nowhere&quot; and is visited by Jeannie and a Marty imposter.

===Cars===

The car Jeff Randall drove was a white Vauxhall Victor, with the registration number . It was also used in two episodes of &quot;Department S&quot;; in that series Joel Fabiani&#x27;s character Stewart Sullivan drove a white Vauxhall Ventora with the registration RXD 997F. The red Mini used by Jean Hopkirk was registered in May 1964 and had been used in an episode of &quot;The Saint&quot; (1968), an episode of &quot;Department S&quot; (1969) and driven by Tony Curtis&#x27;s character Danny Wilde in an episode of &quot;The Persuaders!&quot; (1970).

===Music===
The theme music was composed by Edwin Astley, who in the previous years had composed many themes and incidental music for film series produced and distributed by ITC and its forerunners. Astley used the harpsichord because of its distinctive sound and used the C minor key because of the &quot;death&quot; part in it. In all Astley composed 188 numbered cues used throughout the series. Music composed by Astley from &quot;The Champions&quot; was briefly used, as was music by Albert Elms from the same series. Music was also used by Astley from his own library of music, the Chappell library, and other music composed by Robert Farnon, Johnny Hawksworth, Sidney Torch, Vivaldi.

==Characters and cast==

* Mike Pratt as Jeffrey &quot;Jeff&quot; Randall, a successful (albeit &quot;slightly seedy&quot; and often morally ambiguous) private detective whose success in solving mysteries becomes inevitably greater once he has the benefits and paranormal abilities of his deceased friend and partner Marty Hopkirk. Randall is short-tempered, becoming irritated with certain situations and people, particularly the ghost of Marty.
* Kenneth Cope as Martin &quot;Marty&quot; Hopkirk, a private detective and Jeff&#x27;s friend and partner, who is murdered in the course of an investigation by being run down by a car travelling at high speed. Marty dies instantly, but returns as a ghost to help Jeff (the only living person who can see him) bring his killer to justice. Marty remains with Jeff throughout the entire series, a cynical, often perturbed character who torments Jeff as much as helps him. 
* Annette Andre as Jean &quot;Jeannie&quot; Hopkirk, secretary at the Randall and Hopkirk private investigation office. She is the widow of Marty. Though resourceful, she can be very naïve and vulnerable, putting her own life in danger on many occasions.
* Ivor Dean as Inspector Large (5 episodes), a lugubrious police inspector, always suspicious of Randall and looking to arrest him. Their relationship is highly adversarial, though Randall eventually helps the inspector bring the real culprits to justice.
* Richard Kerley as Sergeant Hinds (3 episodes), Inspector Large&#x27;s subordinate. 
* Judith Arthy as Jennifer (2 episodes), the sister of Jeannie, who comes to London to visit her sister.
* Garfield Morgan (2 episodes) in different roles in each
* Michael Griffiths as Inspector Nelson (2 episodes), a police inspector who, much like Inspector Large, treats Randall as a criminal and the first suspect for various crimes.

==Episodes==
Airdates given here are for London Weekend Television. It was the only ITV region to screen all 26 episodes without breaks in transmission. Other ITV regions varied airdates and transmission order.

Filming took place between May 1968 and July 1969.

==Broadcast==

The 26 episodes were broadcast in the UK between 26 September 1969 and 31 July 1971; ATV delayed their initial transmission of the last five episodes after 21 episodes had been transmitted. In the United States it was syndicated from 1974 to 1983 under the title &quot;My Partner the Ghost&quot;. The series has been shown in 2020 in the UK on the Sony Channel, and again in 2022 on the channel Great! TV. As of January 2023, all episodes are available on ITV&#x27;s free-to-air on-demand service ITVX, and Britbox Britbox.

==Home media==
On October 2, 2017, the complete series of &quot;Randall And Hopkirk (Deceased)&quot; was released on Blu-ray in the UK by a company called Network. It was newly remastered to HD from the original 35mm element prints. Though listed as Region B, the discs are actually Region A/B/C or Region Free, meaning they will also play in American Blu-ray players. The episodes on the discs are listed in production order instead of the air date order.

== Remakes ==
In 2000–2001, the series was remade by Working Title Films for the BBC with a more elaborate storyline, starring Vic Reeves as Hopkirk (once again in a white suit) and Bob Mortimer as Randall, with Emilia Fox as Jeannie. Two series were made. The show was produced and primarily written by Charlie Higson, who also directed some episodes, and featured numerous writers including Gareth Roberts, Mark Gatiss, Paul Whitehouse and Jeremy Dyson. The premise of the show was the same, but the circumstances of Hopkirk&#x27;s death were changed.

On 10 May 2010, the SyFy Channel announced that it had secured the rights to &quot;Randall &amp; Hopkirk (Deceased)&quot; and were looking to develop a pilot, and in January 2011, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; announced that Jane Espenson and Drew Z. Greenberg would be writing a pilot for SyFy. Espenson told &quot;io9&quot; that &quot;The version we&#x27;re proposing is quite different in tone and content from the original.&quot; She added, &quot;We took the basic premise of a Ghost Detective and his still-living partner and invented our own take on it.&quot;

<text>Nodwick is a comic strip created by Aaron Williams, based around the conventions of fantasy role-playing games, in particular &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;D&amp;D&quot;). It debuted in &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine issue No. 246 (April 1998), first with short strips, and later receiving a second strip in &quot;Dungeon&quot; magazine, making fun of one of the adventures published in each issue. In &quot;Dragon&quot; No. 270 (April 2000), &quot;Nodwick&quot; was expanded to a two-page spread and replaced &quot;Knights of the Dinner Table&quot; as a full-page comic that served as a parody of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; adventuring. It later became a single page strip, related to the issue&#x27;s theme; later, the strip was removed from &quot;Dungeon&quot;, but still appeared in &quot;Dragon&quot;, now unrelated to the main theme of the issue, until &quot;Dragon&quot; ceased print publication late in 2007.

The titular character, Nodwick, is a henchman (as opposed to a hireling) in the employ of a typical &quot;D&amp;D&quot;-style adventuring party. &quot;Nodwick&quot; is published in &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine and on Nodwick.com, along with a &quot;sibling&quot; comic, &quot;Full Frontal Nerdity&quot;. Nodwick and the adventurers he works with were given statistics for the 2nd edition &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;AD&amp;D&quot;) rules as part of the Giants in the Earth article in &quot;Dragon&quot; No. 270. A &quot;Nodwick&quot; card game is also available.

A bi-monthly comic book was published by the author, which ran for 36 issues before its cancellation. The strip has since become a back-up strip in Nodwick&#x27;s more popular sister title &quot;PS238&quot;, although collections of the comic book are available as trade paperbacks.

A &quot;reinvented&quot; version of Nodwick and his adventuring group have also appeared in a &quot;City of Heroes&quot; based comic strip as the superhero team &quot;Q-4orce.&quot;

==Main characters==
Nodwick
:A short henchman, Nodwick has served the adventurers for many years. As the artist&#x27;s style evolved, Nodwick grew shorter and his nose grew larger; this was actually commented upon in the comics themselves, with Artax trying to understand how it happened and Nodwick suggesting his nose grew to create balance for the oft-ridiculous weights he is forced to carry (generally orders of magnitude greater than his own weight). As most of the other henchmen in the strip look very similar to Nodwick, this seems to be a relatively common phenomenon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Artax and Yeagar frequently use Nodwick to set off traps, or to distract or bait monsters. Nodwick has died numerous times, but each time Piffany manages to revive him with her duct tape of healing, usually wrapping him from head to toe to put him back together (On one occasion, Nodwick was reduced to a pile of ashes, so the group poured his ashes into a &quot;Hench Mold&quot; with the words &quot;Just add water&quot; written on it; about the only time she hasn&#x27;t used the duct tape); so Yeagar and Artax usually don&#x27;t worry about tossing him into gruesome traps, feeding him to dragons, etc., if it will advance their quests. At least one comic has mentioned that he has also been cloned several dozen times by Artax when Piffany was unavailable. Nodwick isn&#x27;t as knowledgeable as Artax or as wise as Piffany, but he possesses the most common sense in the group, and is the most likely to protest their hare-brained schemes..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the course of his travails, Nodwick has developed a dry sense of humor and a jaded wit, and lost whatever fear of death he ever held. According to the 2nd edition character sheet for Nodwick, if he ever encounters a deity, there is a 20% chance that the deity in question recognizes him from his all-too frequent trips to the hereafter. Still, he prefers to avoid dying if he can. (The trade paperbacks include a &quot;Rest Index Peace&quot; at the end of each volume, listing all the ways Nodwick has died up to that volume, this Index doesn&#x27;t include Nodwick&#x27;s deaths from Dragon and Dungeon Magazines, nor from the online comic)..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &quot;Dragon&quot; #270&#x27;s Giants in the Earth article, Nodwick is stated as being a level 21 Henchman, with eighteen ranks in each of the Nonweapon Proficiences Schlepping, Toting, Hauling, and Lifting with Knees. He also counts as having 15 ranks in the Religion Nonweapon Proficiency, due to his frequent deaths. His Nonweapon Proficiences are what allows Nodwick to carry such ridiculously large amounts of junk, and only apply to things designated &quot;loot&quot;. In all other situations, Nodwick&#x27;s Strength statistic is given as a mere eight. In this article, Nodwick is stated as being of Lawful Good alignment, which is why he attempts to merely find a loophole in his contract in order to escape rather than simply absconding while unattended or even murdering his employers in their sleep. It is noted that there is a base 5% chance that Nodwick may be carrying any item from the Player&#x27;s Handbook, with this chance increasing by +2% for every cubic foot of junk Nodwick is hauling.

Yeagar
:Buff fighter with muscles between his ears. It is often Yeagar who drags the party off on life-threatening looting runs. Yeagar&#x27;s exploits frequently involve consuming large quantities of &quot;Skull-whomper ale&quot; and making a fool of himself and his companions. Yeager is portrayed as a proficient warrior who is nevertheless overly eager and impetuous, lacking in brainpower, and all too willing to use Nodwick as monster-bait; in one notable episode, his companions realized that Yeagar had been replaced with a doppelganger when he opted to throw a rock at a switch across a lava bed instead of throwing Nodwick at it. Noted for his chainmail body stocking and very large spiked shoulder pauldrons..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &quot;Dragon&quot; #270&#x27;s Giants in the Earth article, Yeager is described as a level 8 Chaotic Good Fighter with the special defence of a 50% resistance to attempts at reasoning. He has 12 skill ranks in Scheme, 15 in Simple Solutions For Complex Problems, and 11 in Running. Pioneer of the various abuses of henchman, he treats his Intelligence as being 18 when attempting to figure out reasons to use a henchman for something like stopping a portcullis from closing. Yeager&#x27;s armor is described as being +3 chainmail, and his sword is a +1 longsword- at least, in his hands. Yeager&#x27;s sword is actually a Reaper of Evil +5, +10 vs. Evil Creatures. As well as its potent magical effects, it is a sentient weapon with an Intelligence and an Ego of 18 that provides its wielder with the ability to turn undead three times per day as though they were a level 15 cleric, the power to cure disease with a touch and the ability to directly contact their patron god once per year. However, the horrific experiences it suffered shortly after coming into Yeager&#x27;s possession (being used to kill a skunk, scrape dragon dung off Yeager&#x27;s boots and cut a path through a field of bile weeds, then fatally impaling a saintly monk after trying to leap from Yeager&#x27;s possession) have left it mentally scarred and locked in a catatonic state. The only method able to cure it will be removal from Yeagar&#x27;s possession and several years of therapy.

Artax
:Tall, skinny wizard with a pointy green hat and an extremely long moustache. Long on intelligence, short on wisdom, and Yeagar&#x27;s best friend. Artax is ostensibly the leader of the outfit, directing their efforts, but just as often Yeagar and Piffany just do as they please. Artax is not as impetuous as Yeagar and more inclined to question the advisability of his friend&#x27;s scheme, but usually caves in and goes along with whatever Yeagar has in mind. Like Yeagar, he frequently uses Nodwick to set off traps, lure monsters out of their lairs, et cetera. When at home, Artax frequently uses Nodwick as a laboratory assistant (or guinea pig).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &quot;Dragon&quot; #270&#x27;s Giants in the Earth article, Artax is stated as having come from a long line of magicians. A few of his ancestors became quite famous and/or powerful, but the majority of them were lucky enough to breed before killing themselves in some spectacular magical accident. A level 7 Generalist Wizard of Neutral Good alignment, Artax has Nonweapon Proficiency ranks in Spellcraft (16), Henchcraft (18), Ancient Languages (18), Reading/Writing (19) and Forgery (15). Artax&#x27;s elongated mustache is said to be infested with so many food particles that it can be ingested with all the nutritional value of a single iron ration, while his pointy hat has the powers of a +4 Ring of Protection. He is noted to have a special defence; a 30% resistance to pleas of mercy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to his background in this article, Artax originally adventured with a different group of adventurers- consummate professionals who were truly interested in doing good. This put them at odds with Artax, who is self-obsessed and power hungry. Yeager and Artax met when Artax&#x27;s previous party was interviewing potential replacements for a slain member, a footman implicitly murdered by Artax (he was struck by lightning, while only Artax was around, in the middle of a sunny day); Artax&#x27;s previous party rejected Yeagar, and that made Artax decide he was the perfect partner.

Piffany
:Small, bespectacled cleric of good. Unfailingly honest, Piffany is also unwilling to seriously harm any living thing; the closest she comes is whacking things over the head with her staff while screaming &quot;NAUGHTY! NAUGHTY! NAUGHTY!&quot; She spends a lot of time putting Nodwick back together with her &quot;duct tape of healing&quot; and is probably the closest thing he has to a friend among the party. Although she possesses a great deal of wisdom and is the purest soul in the universe, Piffany isn&#x27;t quite the brightest bulb in the box and is commonly manipulated by her companions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Piffany is the only member of the party who treats Nodwick with any kind of dignity, but Artax and Yeagar often take advantage of her natural gullibility to use Nodwick to trigger traps &quot;for the greater good.&quot; When she isn&#x27;t patching Nodwick together or scolding Yeagar and Artax for their general naughtiness, Piffany spends her time proselytizing in the name of niceness and baking the universe&#x27;s best cookies – the recipe of which was used to settle a dispute among the gods once. Despite their differences with the young cleric, Artax and Yeagar are actually quite protective of Piffany and would never let any harm come to her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &quot;Dragon&quot; #270&#x27;s Giants in the Earth article, Piffany is described as being a Lawful Good Cleric of 8th level. Her outfit functions as +3 leather armor and her staff is described as being a Staff of Harmony. This makes it an enchanted item that can be wielded in combat as a +3 mace, with the added feature that it warns the wielder of any evil alignment creature of at least five Hit Dice that has come within 30 feet of them. It can be used three times each day to cast the Command spell, and can also be &#x27;charged&#x27; with up to three clerical spells for cases of emergency.

==Other characters==

*Count Repugsive: A recurring villain, similar in stature to Yeagar, wearing a skull-faced helmet. Described as an &quot;anti-paladin.&quot; Repugsive is not a very effective villain; his schemes are often incomplete or downright silly, such as creating zombie hordes to move into cities, thus lowering property values so he can take over by buying at cheap prices. Should Repugsive die, he has the power to re-form in about a week, as was discovered after he exploded upon fighting a paladin (they canceled each other out). Recently, Count Repugsive was fitted with the Gauntlet of Supremacy, wiping his mind and channeling the spirit of the dead swordsman Utharr, Yeagar&#x27;s evil counterpart; however, he was only &quot;out of service&quot; for a while, and eventually contested possession of their shared body, at least until Utharr and the Gauntlet were removed, permanently. It was also recently discovered that Repugsive is in fact a woman, and not a man as we had all been led to believe over the comic strip&#x27;s history. She claims that she allowed the charade to continue because &quot;evil gals are only taken seriously if they&#x27;re hot&quot;, which she apparently wasn&#x27;t even before her death. In the same story arc, he/she also admits to being the inventor of &quot;healing strips&quot;, better known as Piffany&#x27;s duct tape.
*Claret Copin: A bard Nodwick&#x27;s run into a few times. She writes epic ballads about the group&#x27;s heroic exploits, such as feeding Nodwick to hydras, sundering ancient seals with his head, and so on, which tend to make the four even bigger laughingstocks than they were before.
*Bezzler: An elf or half-elf thief who worked with the group before they hired Nodwick; they disposed of him when it came out that he was stealing from them. Bezzler came back seeking re-employment, but Nodwick managed to catch him stealing again, and so he parted ways with them once more – after stealing the clothes off Nodwick&#x27;s back.
*Frigg: A kobold encountered by the group on a couple of occasions. Nodwick met Frigg while scouting ahead in a dungeon and struck up a conversation, but when he returned to the party with Frigg in tow, Nodwick&#x27;s companions attacked the kobold. However, when they learned that Frigg was an economics major who could increase the value of their loot, they welcomed him with open arms. They ran into Frigg once more after that, when the kobold came to complain about Yeagar trashing his accounting firm.
*The Brotherhood of Evil Henchmen: A cabal of unsavory hirelings who desire to recruit Nodwick so they can learn from his &quot;skills in the art of object transportation&quot; (i.e., schlepping vast quantities of loot), in addition to their own talent of finding even the most strange, rare and unusual things for the use of their masters. The Brotherhood is &quot;a band of humans, humanoids, and other mostly ill-spirited races, bound to serve those who strive to bring chaos and wickedness into the world.&quot; All of the Brotherhood&#x27;s members have the same short, big-headed stature as Nodwick, although they lack the big nose all good/neutral henchmen develop. They are led by Theobor, a mysterious robed figure with glowing yellow eyes (actually, Baphuma&#x27;al in disguise). Theobor&#x27;s chief lackey is Beobor, a dim-witted hunchback.
*Henchmen&#x27;s Local 246: The henchmen&#x27;s union, it is run by a (figurehead super-powered female) hamster that enables the adventurer&#x27;s guild to deprive henchmen of their rights. One of several recurring staff members is Heathwick, a clerk of sorts. The Henchmen&#x27;s Union also underwent an April Fool&#x27;s Day ordeal every year at the hands of the wizard&#x27;s and adventurer&#x27;s guilds until the pranks got out of hand, unleashing a scourge upon an anti-prank parade and carnival Piffany&#x27;s sisterhood was holding in front of the Henchmen&#x27;s Union Hall. Piffany and her sisters then marched to city hall demanding action, with a resulting declaration of all April Fool&#x27;s Day festivities being capital offenses.
*Baphuma&#x27;al: A dark god of foul magic, he appears every so often to give a glimpse of his multiversal plan to envelop the world in darkness. He was trapped in Nodwick&#x27;s world for centuries after a wizard accidentally used a magical pillow on Baphuma&#x27;al&#x27;s face at the stroke of midnight, summoning a tooth fairy who stole two of the deity&#x27;s teeth, giving him a lisp. Upon regaining his teeth he returned to his home plane. When Nodwick was hurled into a parallel universe by the Cleft of the Cosmos, it was to a world dominated by Baphuma&#x27;al.
*Rowen: An attractive and intelligent woman with whom Yeagar is in love (he believes secretly, although it is obvious to all). Rowen and Yeagar were childhood friends and there are unanswered questions about some parts of her history. It has also been hinted at that Rowen might be less noble than Yeagar&#x27;s idealized image of her is (as indicated by an incident with an illegal dragon mount).
*Orville: Rowen&#x27;s riding dragon. Too dumb to defend his mistress in times of danger unless verbally alerted, and has a tendency to gobble up everything he finds edible, including Nodwick.

There&#x27;s also an evil group who closely resembles the party, however, this group doesn&#x27;t employ a henchman, except for their first appearance, when they tried to loot the Henchmen Cemetery.
*Utharr: Evil fighter and worshipper of Baphuma&#x27;al, he was lured to his death by Nodwick (who slapped a steak on his back and suggested that he examine a well that contained a tentacled, Lovecraftian monster), later revived by Elonan, and killed again in an avalanche. Currently, he inhabits Count Repugsive&#x27;s body, controlling his undead army. One of the few persons who have elicited a fearful reaction from Yeagar &quot;The accessories on their warrior! My spiked shoulder plates are no match for his blade-festooned finery!&quot;
*Elonan: An evil female cleric, Elonan&#x27;s evil career as a worshipper of Uthok ended when Piffany covered her armor with smileys; however, after losing her deity&#x27;s favor, she started again as a cleric of Baphuma&#x27;al. According to Piffany, Elonan &quot;Smells like the lead electric mandolinist for `Crossbows and Roses`&quot;.
*Ildomir: An evil elderly wizard. After Piffany destroyed his book of black magic, Baphuma&#x27;al gave him a new, even more sinister one. During their first encounter, Artax was quite impressed with his &quot;permanent pyrotechnic effects&quot;, meaning glowing eyes with an energy release.
The group was defeated by the party in two separate occasions before they turned to worshipping Baphuma&#x27;al, and their power has been raised by the evil god.

The party has also run into various characters from classic D&amp;D adventures and novels, such as Raistlin Majere from Dragonlance, Elminster from the Forgotten Realms, and Count Strahd von Zarovich from Ravenloft, as well as the game&#x27;s creators, Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson. They&#x27;ve also encountered characters who appear to be from other sources as well (a pageful of cameos including and Harry Potter in one issue, Death from The Sandman appearing in another, Spider-Man being chased by an amorous Lolth in a comic strip in Dragon Magazine, etc.).

<text>In mathematics, noncommutative topology is a term used for the relationship between topological and C*-algebraic concepts. The term has its origins in the Gelfand–Naimark theorem, which implies the duality of the category of locally compact Hausdorff spaces and the category of commutative C*-algebras. Noncommutative topology is related to analytic noncommutative geometry.

== Examples ==

The premise behind noncommutative topology is that a noncommutative C*-algebra can be treated like the algebra of complex-valued continuous functions on a &#x27;noncommutative space&#x27; which does not exist classically. Several topological properties can be formulated as properties for the C*-algebras without making reference to commutativity or the underlying space, and so have an immediate generalization.
Among these are:
* compactness (unital)
* σ-compactness (σ-unital)
* dimension (real or stable rank)
* connectedness (projectionless)
* extremally disconnected spaces (AW*-algebras)

Individual elements of a commutative C*-algebra correspond with continuous functions. And so certain types of functions can correspond to certain properties of a C*-algebra. For example, self-adjoint elements of a commutative C*-algebra correspond to real-valued continuous functions. Also, projections (i.e. self-adjoint idempotents) correspond to indicator functions of clopen sets.

Categorical constructions lead to some examples. For example, the coproduct of spaces is the disjoint union and thus corresponds to the direct sum of algebras, which is the product of C*-algebras. Similarly, product topology corresponds to the coproduct of C*-algebras, the tensor product of algebras. In a more specialized setting,
compactifications of topologies correspond to unitizations of algebras. So the one-point compactification corresponds to the minimal unitization of C*-algebras, the Stone–Čech compactification corresponds to the multiplier algebra, and corona sets correspond with corona algebras.

There are certain examples of properties where multiple generalizations are possible and it is not clear which is preferable. For example, probability measures can correspond either to states or tracial states. Since all states are vacuously 
tracial states in the commutative case, it is not clear whether the tracial condition is necessary to be a useful generalization.

== K-theory ==
One of the major examples of this idea is the generalization of topological K-theory to noncommutative C*-algebras in the form of operator K-theory.

A further development in this is a bivariant version of K-theory called KK-theory, which has a composition product 

formula_1

of which the ring structure in ordinary K-theory is a special case. The product gives the structure of a category to KK. It has been related to correspondences of algebraic varieties.

<text>Rail transport in Belgium benefits from an extensive rail network. The country is a member of the International Union of Railways (UIC). The UIC Country Code for Belgium is 88.

==History==

On May 5, 1835, the first railway in continental Europe opened between Brussels-Groendreef/Allée verte and Mechelen. Some sort of railroad or canal had been envisaged as early as 1830. The feasibility of a railroad was investigated by engineers Pierre Simons and Gustave De Ridder. The first trains were Stephenson engines imported from Great Britain. The engines were called &quot;Pijl&quot; meaning Arrow, &quot;Olifant&quot; meaning Elephant, and &#x27;Stephenson&#x27; (named after its designer). They pulled bench-cars and diligences. On the return from Mechelen, the &quot;Olifant&quot; pulled all 30 cars. By 1840, Ghent, Bruges, Ostend, Antwerp, Mechelen, Brussels and Leuven were connected. The lines that had to reach Liège, Mons and Kortrijk were partially completed. In 1843, when the major East-West/North-South axes were complete, private companies were allowed to construct and use their own rail systems. These were crucial in the industrialisation of the country.

In 1870, the Belgian state owned of rail lines, while the private enterprises owned . From 1870 to 1882, the railways were gradually nationalised. In 1912, were state property compared to private lines. Full nationalisation was considered at the time but was not enacted until 1926, when the SNCB was started. It was named the SNCB (&quot;Société nationale des Chemins de Fer belges&quot;) or NMBS (&quot;Nationale Maatschappij der Belgische Spoorwegen&quot;), named in a similar way to the French rail network, SNCF, which was founded 12 years later. In 1958 the network was fully state-owned. On 5 May 1935 the SNCB started with electrification on the line Brussels North to Antwerp Central, .

==Infrastructure==
In 2003, the network constituted of railways, all of which were standard gauge: . Of all of those railways, were also electrified. Most electrified Belgian lines use a 3 kV DC overhead power supply, but the high speed-lines are electrified at 25 kV AC, as are recent electrifications in the south of the country (Rivage - Gouvy and Dinant - Athus lines).

Trains in Belgium normally run on the left hand track. This is in contrast to road vehicles, which drive on the right hand side of the road and is evidence of the British involvement in building the rail network in the 19th century.

The railway network is controlled and maintained by Infrabel.

==Policy==
Belgium operates a policy of cheap rail travel. Citizens in Belgium, especially students and older citizens, are offered incentives and cheaper fares in order to alleviate congestion on the nation&#x27;s roads. Public sector employees are entitled to a free or heavily subsidised season ticket for commuting by rail. Many private sector employers will make a contribution to the cost of a season ticket. Smoking is prohibited in all railway stations, and all tracks since January 2023 (enclosed and outside too), and passenger cars.

== Rail links with adjacent countries ==
All adjacent countries use the same in standard gauge.
* Netherlands - different voltage 3 kV DC/1500 V DC. The change of voltage occurs south of Roosendaal, and between the Dutch stations of Eijsden and Maastricht Randwijck; monovoltage 3 kV Belgian trains proceed under reduced power to the first large station past the border (Roosendaal or Maastricht). Border crossings are at:
** Essen, Visé (&quot;Wezet&quot;)
** Meer (high speed line, 25 kV 50 Hz)
** Hamont, Lanaken and Zelzate (all three: not electrified, freight only; line 20 Lanaken – Maastricht is &quot;temporarily out of service&quot; from Lanaken to the border, and not connected to the rest of the Belgian net.)
** Eisden (planned, opening scheduled between 2012 and 2017)
** Achel (closed, reopening scheduled between 2012 and 2017)
** Sint-Gillis-Waas (closed), Turnhout (closed)
* Germany - different voltage 3 kV DC/15 kV AC. The change of voltage occurs in Aachen station where there is a switchable track so that 3 kV monovoltage trains can reach Aachen. Change of voltage also on the Moresnet viaduct on the freight only line Visé - Montzen - Aachen West. Border crossings are at:
** Welkenraedt
** Kelmis-Hergenrath (includes high speed traffic on the upgraded line)
** Losheimergraben (dismounted), Raeren (dismounted), Gemmenich (freight only, voltage change between goods stations Montzen(B) and Gemmenich(D), several kilometers inside the Belgian side of the border).
** Steinebrück (closed),
* Luxembourg - different voltage 3 kV DC/25 kV AC. All Belgian lines going to the grand-duchy of Luxembourg use 25 kV 50 Hz long before the border so there is no voltage change. Border crossings are at:
** Arlon - Sterpenich(B) – Kleinbettingen(L)
** Gouvy(B) – Troisvierges(L)
** Athus(B) or Aubange(B) - Rodange(L)
** Lengeler, Benonchamps, Lommersweiler (all closed)
* France - different voltage 3 kV DC/25 kV AC. The change of voltage occurs at the border, except for the high-speed line which is 25 kV throughout and as mentioned below. Border crossings are at:
** Mouscron(B) (&quot;Moeskroen&quot;) – Tourcoing(F)
** Tournai(B) – Froyennes(B) – Blandain(F) (voltage change long before the border, at the switch &quot;Y Froyennes&quot; from line 75A Tournai – Mouscron)
** Quiévrain (dismounted)
** Quévy(B) – Feignies(F)
** Erquelinnes(B) – Jeumont(F)
** Aubange(B) – Mont-Saint-Martin(F) (Belgian line is on 50 kV AC long before the border, no voltage change)
** high speed line at Esplechin
** Adinkerke to Dunkirk track in situ, line closed to passengers and freight
** Momignies the track has been taken off in favor of a cycle track 
** Heer-Agimont (line from Dinant to Givet): track in situ, line closed to passengers and freight. Part of the line from Dinant used to be the site of a tourists&#x27; steam train, but no more in exploitation.
** Menen, Comines-Warneton, Leupegem, Antoing, Péruwelz, Dour, Doische (closed)
* United Kingdom - using HSL 1, LGV Nord, the Channel Tunnel and the High Speed 1/Channel Tunnel Rail Link is 25 kV AC. All rail transport between Belgium and the UK transits through France.

<text>The Tupolev Tu-160 (; NATO reporting name: Blackjack) is a supersonic, variable-sweep wing nuclear-capable heavy strategic bomber and airborne missile platform designed by the Tupolev Design Bureau in the Soviet Union in the 1970s. The Tu-160 is operated by the Long Range Aviation branch of the Russian Aerospace Forces.

Entering service in 1987, the Tu-160 was the last strategic bomber designed for the Soviet Air Forces and was built to serve as a conventional and nuclear-capable strike aircraft. Production was stopped in 1992 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, and the newly independent Russian and Ukrainian air forces inherited a fleet of 13 and 19 Tu-160s, respectively. Following protracted negotiations, eight Ukrainian Tu-160s were purchased by the Russian Federation while the remaining 11 were scrapped in the late 1990s under the Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction agreement. Following these actions, the sole operator of the aircraft type became the Russian Aerospace Forces&#x27; Long Range Aviation branch, which still had 17 Tu-160s in service as of 2022. The type had its combat debut in November 2015 during the Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War, conducting numerous airstrikes using Kh-101 air-launched cruise missiles. Various overseas deployments have been conducted, including to distant nations such as Venezuela and South Africa.

Since the early 2000s, the active fleet has been subject to several upgrades, largely focusing on various electronics systems. The Tu-160M modernization program of existing models began with the first updated aircraft delivered in December 2014. Plans announced in 2015 called for the delivery of 50 new-built Tu-160Ms as well as the upgrading of 16 existing aircraft.

In January 2022, a newly-built Tu-160M performed a test flight, the first of the resumed serial production, with two new aircraft planned for delivery in 2022 from 10 on order.

==Development==
===Origins===
The first competition for a supersonic strategic heavy bomber was launched in the Soviet Union in 1967. In 1972, the Soviet Union launched a new multi-mission bomber competition to create a new supersonic, variable-geometry (&quot;swing-wing&quot;) heavy bomber with a maximum speed of Mach 2.3, in response to the US Air Force B-1 bomber project. The Tupolev design, named &quot;Aircraft 160M&quot;, with a lengthened blended wing layout and incorporating some elements of the Tu-144, competed against the Myasishchev M-18 and the Sukhoi T-4 designs. Work on the new Soviet bomber continued despite an end to the B-1A and, in the same year, the design was accepted by the government committee. The prototype was photographed by an airline passenger at a Zhukovsky Airfield in November 1981, about a month before the aircraft&#x27;s first flight on 18 December 1981. Production was authorized in 1984, beginning at the Kazan Aircraft Production Association (KAPO).

===Modernization===
In 2002, the Russian Defence Ministry and KAPO agreed to modernise 15 Tu-160s. In July 2006, the first overhauled and partially modernized aircraft was accepted into Russian service after testing; it reportedly received the capability to use conventional weapons but was not upgraded with new avionics as previously planned. The first modernized aircraft capable of carrying the new long-range Kh-555 conventional cruise missile was delivered to the Russian Air Force in April 2008; a follow-up contract for the modernization of three more aircraft is estimated to cost RUR3.4 billion (US$103 million).
The modernization appeared to be split into two phases, first concentrating on life extension with some initial communication–navigation updates, followed by engine upgrades after 2016. In November 2014, a Tu-160 upgraded with new radar and avionics performed its first flight. The aircraft was delivered to the Russian Air Force as the Tu-160M model in December 2014. The phase I update was due to be completed by 2016, but industrial limitations may delay it to 2019 or beyond.

Although Kuznetsov designed an NK-32M engine with improved reliability over the NK-32 engines, its successor company has struggled to deliver working units. Metallist-Samara JSC had not produced new engines for a decade when it was given a contract in 2011 to overhaul 26 of the existing engines; two years later, only four had been finished. Ownership and financial concerns hinder the prospects of a new production line; the firm insists it needs a minimum of 20 engines ordered per year but the government is only prepared to pay for 4–6 engines per year. A further improved engine was bench tested in 2012 and projected to potentially enter production as early as 2016.

On 2 February 2020, the modernized Tu-160M performed its first test flight at the airfield of the Kazan Aviation Plant named for I. Gorbunov. Deliveries started later that year, five aircraft were equipped with the new engines by August 2022. According to Vladimir Putin, 4 Tu-160M were delivered in 2023.

===Resumed production===

In 2008, Russia revealed plans for one new Tu-160 to be delivered every one to two years with the aim of increasing the active inventory to 30 or more aircraft by 2025–2030. On 29 April 2015, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, on order of President Putin, announced that Tu-160 production would resume. In May 2015, TASS reported that the Russian Air Force would purchase at least 50 KAPO-built Tu-160s. General Viktor Bondarev stated that development of the PAK DA will proceed alongside Tu-160 production.

On 16 November 2017, a newly assembled Tu-160, built from an unfinished airframe, was unveiled during a roll-out ceremony at KAPO, signifying a restoration of certain production techniques such as electron-beam welding or titanium work reportedly lost after the termination of serial production in 1992. According to Dmitri Rogozin, the serial production of wholly new airframes for the modernized Tu-160M2 should begin in 2019 with deliveries to the Russian Aerospace Forces in 2023. The aircraft, named &quot;Petr Deinekin&quot;, after the first commanding officer of the Russian Air Force.
Tu-160 &quot;Petr Deinekin&quot; performed its first public flight on 25 January 2018, during President Vladimir Putin&#x27;s visit to KAPO plant. The same day, a contract for ten upgraded Tu-160M2s was signed. On 12 January 2022 a new-build Tu-160M had its first low altitude basic test flight. It is planned to deliver two new-build Tu-160M in 2022 with production increasing until all 50 new aircraft on order are delivered. In December 2022, United Aircraft Corporation announced that the second new-build Tu-160M and the fourth modernized Tu-160M were starting flight tests. It was also reported that the first new Tu-160 had completed factory testing. 4 aircraft were delivered on 21 February 2024.

===Other proposed variants===
A demilitarized, commercial version of the Tu-160, named &quot;Tu-160SK&quot;, was displayed at Asian Aerospace in Singapore in 1994 with a model of a small space vehicle named Burlak attached underneath the fuselage.

In January 2018, Vladimir Putin, while visiting the KAPO plant, floated an idea of creating a civilian passenger supersonic transport version of Tu-160. Experts quoted by the news media were skeptical about the commercial and technological feasibility of such a civilian conversion.

==Design==
The Tu-160 is a variable-geometry wing aircraft. The aircraft employs a fly-by-wire control system with a blended wing profile, and full-span slats are used on the leading edges, with double-slotted flaps on the trailing edges and cruciform tail. Titanium constitutes around 30% of the aircraft&#x27;s empty weight, and the largest component (the swing wing hinge) weighs . The Tu-160 has a crew of four (pilot, co-pilot, bombardier, and defensive systems operator) in K-36LM ejection seats.
The Tu-160 is powered by four Kuznetsov NK-32 afterburning turbofan engines, the most powerful ever fitted to a combat aircraft. Unlike the American B-1B Lancer, which reduced the original Mach 2+ requirement for the B-1A to achieve a smaller radar cross-section, the Tu-160 retains variable intake ramps, and is capable of reaching Mach 2.05 speed at altitude. The Tu-160 is equipped with a probe-and-drogue in-flight refueling system for extended-range missions, although it is rarely used. The Tu-160 has an internal fuel capacity of . In February 2008, Tu-160 bombers and Il-78 refueling tankers practiced air refueling during air combat exercise, as well as MiG-31, A-50 and other Russian combat aircraft.

The aircraft carries a TsNPO Leninets &quot;Obzor-K&quot; (Survey, NATO: Clam Pipe) radar for tracking ground and air targets, and a separate &quot;Sopka&quot; Terrain-following radar. Although the Tu-160 was designed for reduced detectability to both radar and infrared signature, it is not a stealth aircraft.

Weapons are carried in two internal bays, each capable of holding of free-fall weapons or a rotary launcher for missiles capable of carrying conventional or nuclear-warheads. The aircraft&#x27;s total weapons load capacity is 45,000 kg (99,208 lb). No defensive weapons are provided; the Tu-160 is the first post-World War II Soviet bomber to lack such defenses. In 2020, officials stated that the Russian Aerospace Forces is planning to arm the Tu-160 with new hypersonic missiles, in particular the nuclear-capable Kh-47M2 Kinzhal hypersonic air-launched ballistic missile.

While similar in appearance to the American B-1 Lancer, the Tu-160 is a different class of combat aircraft; its primary role being a standoff missile platform (strategic missile carrier). The Tu-160 is also larger and faster than the B-1B and has a slightly greater combat range, though the B-1B has a larger combined payload with external payload. Another noticeable difference is that the B-1&#x27;s colour scheme is usually subdued dark gray to reduce visibility; the Tu-160 is painted with anti-flash white, giving it the nickname among Russian airmen &quot;White Swan&quot;. On 16 September 2023, Commander of the long-range aviation Lieutenant General Sergei Kobylash announced that Russian Tu-160s were outfitted with the newest Kh-BD cruise missile with range of 6,500 km. Each bomber can carry 12 missiles separated on two rotary launchers.

==Operational history==
In April 1987, the Tu-160 entered operational service with the 184th Guards Heavy Bomber Regiment located at Pryluky, Ukrainian SSR. The regiment, previously operating Tu-16 and Tu-22M3 strategic bombers, was the first unit to receive the Tu-160. Squadron deployments to Long Range Aviation began that same month. The Tu-160&#x27;s first public appearance in a parade came in 1989. During 1989 and 1990, a total of 44 world speed flight records in its weight class were set. In January 1992, Boris Yeltsin decided to end serial production of the Tu-160; 35 aircraft were completed by this time. Russia also unilaterally suspended flights of strategic aviation over remote regions.

A total of 19 Tu-160s were based inside the newly independent Ukraine during the dissolution of the Soviet Union. On 25 August 1991, the Ukrainian parliament decreed that the new nation would take control of all military units on its territory; a Defence Ministry was created that same day. By the mid-1990s, the Pryluky regiment had lost its value as a combat unit; 19 Tu-160s were effectively grounded due to a lack of technical support and spare parts. Ukraine considered the Tu-160s to be a bargaining chip in economic negotiations with Russia and of limited military value. While Russian experts, who examined the aircraft at the Pryluky Air Base in 1993 and 1996, assessed their technical condition as good, the US$3 billion price proposed by Ukraine was considered by Russia to be unacceptable. In April 1998, amid stalled negotiations, Ukraine decided to commence scrapping the fleet under the Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction agreement. In November, the first Tu-160 was deconstructed at Pryluky.

In April 1999, Russia resumed talks with Ukraine, proposing to purchase eight Tu-160 and three Tu-95MS bombers manufactured in 1991 (those in the best technical condition), as well as 575 Kh-55SM cruise missiles. An agreement was reached and a US$285 million contract was signed, the value of which was deducted from Ukraine&#x27;s debt for natural gas. On 20 October 1999, a group of Russian military experts went to Ukraine to prepare the aircraft for the flight to Engels-2 air base. On 5 November, the first two aircraft, a Tu-160 and a Tu-95MS, departed Pryluky. During the following months, the balance were flown to Engels-2.
Alongside buying Ukrainian Tu-160s, Russia pursued other means to expanding its fleet. In June 1999, the Russian Defence Ministry and KAPO signed a contract for a delivery of a single near-complete bomber. Named &quot;Aleksandr Molodchiy&quot;, it was the second aircraft in the eighth production batch. It arrived at Engels-2 on 10 September and was commissioned into service on 5 May 2000. The unit operating the fleet from Engels-2 was the 121st Guards Heavy Bomber Regiment which was formed up in early 1992 and received six aircraft by 1994. By the end of February 2001, the fleet stood at 15 with the addition of the eight Ukrainian Tu-160s and the new-build. The fleet was reduced to 14 due to the crash of the &quot;Mikhail Gromov&quot; during flight trials of a replacement engine on 18 September 2003. On 5 July 2006, a Tu-160 named &quot;Valentin Bliznyuk&quot;, named after the Tu-160&#x27;s chief designer, entered service with the Russian Air Force after completing its overhaul, bringing the total number back to 15. Built in 1986, it was formerly used as a test aircraft by Tupolev.

On 22 April 2006, the commander of the Long-Range Aviation Lieutenant General Igor Khvorov reported a pair of Tu-160s flew undetected through a US-controlled sector during a military exercise in the Arctic.

On 17 August 2007, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the resumption of strategic aviation flights stopped in 1991. On 14 September 2007, British and Norwegian fighters intercepted two Tu-160s in international airspace near the United Kingdom and Finland, as they were patrolling the North Atlantic. On 25 December 2007, two Danish Air Force F-16s were scrambled to intercept two Tu-160s near Danish airspace.

On 11 September 2007, according to Russian government sources, a Tu-160 deployed a massive fuel-air explosive device, called Father of All Bombs, for its first field test. Some US military analysts expressed skepticism that the weapon was actually delivered by a Tu-160.

On 29 April 2008, a new Tu-160 named &quot;Vitaly Kopylov&quot; joined the Russian Air Force, increasing the total number of aircraft in service to 16. In early 2008, Tu-160s took part in an exercise with the Russian Navy in the Atlantic Ocean.

On 10 September 2008, two Tu-160s made an unprecedented deployment to Russia&#x27;s ally Venezuela as part of military manoeuvres amid increasingly tense relations between Russia and the United States. The Russian Defence Ministry said &quot;Vasily Senko&quot; and &quot;Aleksandr Molodchiy&quot; would conduct training flights over neutral waters before returning to Russia. They were escorted by NATO fighters as they crossed the Atlantic Ocean.
On 12 October 2008, Tu-160s were involved in the largest Russian strategic bomber exercise since 1984. A total of 12 bombers including Tu-160 and Tu-95 aircraft conducted a series of launches of their cruise missiles. Some bombers launched a full complement of missiles; it was the first time that a Tu-160 had ever fired a full complement of missiles.

On 10 June 2010, two Tu-160s carried out a record-breaking 23-hour patrol with a planned flight range of , having flown along Russia&#x27;s borders and over neutral waters in the Arctic and Pacific Oceans.

In August 2011, Russian media claimed that only four of the sixteen Tu-160s were flight worthy. &quot;Flight International&quot; reported eleven were combat-ready by mid-2012; between 2011 and 2013, eleven were observed in flight.

On 1 November 2013, &quot;Aleksandr Golovanov&quot; and &quot;Aleksandr Novikov&quot; entered Colombian airspace on two separate occasions while flying from Venezuela to Nicaragua. Noting a lack of clearance, the Colombian government issued a letter of protest to the Russian government after the first violation. In the second violation, two Colombian Air Force IAI Kfirs stationed at Barranquilla intercepted and escorted the two Tu-160s out of Colombian airspace.
On 17 November 2015, as part of the Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War, several Tu-160 and Tu-95MS strategic bombers of the Russian Aerospace Forces fired Kh-101 air-launched cruise missiles from above the Mediterranean Sea, striking targets in Idlib and Aleppo provinces. In total, between 34 and 83 cruise missiles were fired, destroying 14 targets. In addition, Tu-22M3 strategic bombers hit numerous claimed Islamic State targets with unguided munitions. This operation also marked the combat debut for the Tu-160 and Tu-95MS.

In August 2018, a number of Russian military aircraft including two Tu-160, Tu-95MS strategic bombers and Il-78 aerial tankers were deployed for the first time to the Russian Far East as part of a long-range tactical flight exercise, flying 7,000 km non-stop flight from their home base in Saratov Oblast to Chukotka. During the exercise, the crews practised the combat use of cruise missiles at the Komi Test Range and performed aerial refueling.

In November 2018, a modernized Tu-160M test-fired a full complement of 12 Kh-101 cruise missiles at the Pemboi Test Range in the northeastern region of Komi Republic.

On 10 December 2018, two Tu-160s accompanied by an An-124 cargo plane and an Il-62 passenger plane, landed at the Maiquetía airport in Venezuela. On 23 October 2019, two Tu-160s accompanied by an An-124 and an Il-62 visited South Africa as part of strengthening ties between the two nations; the aircraft performed a 13 hours non-stop flight over the Caspian Sea, Arabian Sea, and Indian Ocean, covering with mid-air refueling and landed at Waterkloof Air Force Base in South Africa. It was the Tu-160&#x27;s first visit to the African continent.

On 11 November 2021, the Belarusian Defense Ministry announced that two Russian Tu-160s flew on a training mission over Belarus alongside Belarusian Air Force Sukhoi Su-30s.

The type was involved in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. According to Ukrainian sources, on 6 March 2022, a Tu-160 along with a Tu-95MS strategic bomber launched eight cruise missiles, presumably the Kh-101, at the Havryshivka Vinnytsia International Airport from the Black Sea area. On 26 June 2022, Ukrainian Air Force spokesman Yurii Ihnat reported four to six Kh-101 cruise missiles were launched by Tu-160 and Tu-95MS bombers at Kyiv from the Caspian Sea area.
On 20 January 2025, during the Russo-Ukrainian War, Ukraine launched a drone attack on the Gorbunov Kazan Aviation Plant in Kazan, Russia where the Tu-160 is built, about from the border with Ukraine, causing several explosions. Russian sources stated that damage was minimal and all drone threats had been neutralized.

=== Potential operators ===
In 2022, retired Air Chief Marshal Anoop Raha said India was interested in purchasing Tu-160s. Reports emerged in late 2022 that India was in talks with Russia to acquire six Tu-160s that could make India the only country other than US, Russia and China to have operational strategic bombers.

<doc id="662640" wikidata="Q1786705" url="?curid=662640" title="Religion in Belgium">
<text>Christianity is the largest religion in [[Belgium]], with the Catholic Church representing the largest community, though it has experienced a significant decline since the 1950s (when it was the nominal religion of over 80% of the population). Belgium&#x27;s policy separates the state from the churches, and freedom of religion of the citizens is guaranteed by the country&#x27;s constitution.

According to the Eurobarometer poll carried out by the European Commission in 2021, the share of Christians was 49%, with Catholicism being the largest denomination at 44%. Protestants and other Christians comprised 4% and Orthodox Christians comprised 1%. Non-religious people comprised 41% of the population and were divided between those who primarily identified as atheists (15%) or as agnostics (26%). A further 2% of the population was Muslim, with the remainder belonging to other religious or unspecified groups.

== Beliefs and practices ==

According to a 2010 Eurobarometer poll:

* 37% of Belgian citizens believe there is a god.
* 31% believe there is some sort of spirit or life force.
* 27% do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life force.
* 5% declined to answer.

Some religious people dispute these precise figures, as it is difficult to determine the number of Belgian Christians that believe in a personal deity. What is also unclear is the number of registered Belgian Catholics with deistic beliefs or who periodically attend small Evangelical churches.

===Chronological statistics===
An online Ipsos survey conducted between 20 January and 3 February 2023 on a representative sample of Belgians aged 16 to 74 found that 47% had no religion, 44% was Christian, 4% was Muslim and 2% followed an other religion. The remaining 3% refused to answer. The Christians were further subdivided into 38% of total respondents being Catholic and 5% being other Christians. The sample size was more than 500 people and the confidence interval was +/- 5 percentage points.

==Government and religion==
The Belgian constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the government generally respects this right in practice. However, government officials have the authority to research and monitor religious groups that are not officially recognised. There are a few reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice, and some reports of discrimination against minority religious groups.

Belgian law officially recognizes many religions, including Catholicism, Protestantism, Anglicanism, Islam, Judaism, and Eastern Orthodoxy, as well as non-religious philosophical organizations (Dutch: &quot;vrijzinnige levensbeschouwelijke organisaties&quot;; French: &quot;organizations laïques&quot;). Buddhism is in the process of being recognized under the secular organization standard. Official recognition means that priests (called &quot;counselors&quot; within the secular organizations) receive a state stipend. Also, parents can choose any recognized denomination to provide religious education to their children if they attend a state school. Adherents to religions that are not officially recognized are not denied the right to practice their religion but do not receive state stipends.

After attaining autonomy from the federal government in religious matters, the Flemish Parliament passed a regional decree installing democratically elected church councils for all recognised religious denominations and making them subject to the same administrative rules as local government bodies, with important repercussions for financial accounting and open government. In 2006, however, Catholic bishops still appointed candidates to the Catholic Church councils because they had not decided on the criteria for eligibility; they were afraid that candidates might be merely baptized Catholics. By 2008, however, the bishops decided that candidates for the church councils had only to prove that they were over 18, a member of the parish church serving the town or village in which they lived, and baptized Catholic.

In 2022, the country was scored 3 out of 4 for religious freedom.

== Religions ==

=== Christianity ===

==== Catholicism ====


Catholicism has traditionally been Belgium&#x27;s majority religion, with particular strength in Flanders. However, by 2009, Sunday church attendance was 5.4% in Flanders, down from 12.7% in 1998. Nationwide, Sunday church attendance was 5% in 2009, down from 11.2% in 1998. As of 2015, 52.9% Belgian population claimed to belong to the Catholic Church. According to Ipsos, only 41% of the working-age, internet connected people declared to be Catholics.

Until 1998, the Catholic Church annually published key figures such as Sunday mass attendance and the number of baptized children. In 2006, it announced that mass attendance for the Christmas period was 11.5%, and weekly mass attendance (not only on Sundays) was 7%, for the Flanders region. Since 2000, Sunday church attendance in Flanders has dropped by an average of 0.5%–1% each year. In the years 2010 to 2016, 12,442 people in Flanders formally left the Catholic Church.

The “Catholic Church in Belgium 2023” report said that 50% of Belgium’s population identified as Catholic in 2022 down from 53% in 2017 with 8.9% attending Mass at least once a month.

==== Protestantism ====
In 1566, at the peak of Belgian Reformation, there were an estimated 300,000 Protestants, or 20% of the Belgian population. The Spanish reconquest of the Southern Netherlands in the Eighty Years&#x27; War prompted most of the Belgian Protestants to flee to the north or convert, causing the region to again be overwhelmingly Catholic. As of 2017, Protestantism represented 4% of the total population, according to Pew Research.

The Administrative Council of Protestant and Evangelical Religion in Belgium is a coordinating group that mediates between many Protestant groups and the government. The largest Protestant denomination is the United Protestant Church in Belgium, with some 138 affiliated churches.

Belgium had thirteen Anglican churches as of 2012, including the pro-cathedral, Holy Trinity, Brussels. They are part of the Church of England&#x27;s Diocese in Europe, and of the Convocation of Episcopal Churches in Europe.

==== Orthodox Christianity ====
Eastern Orthodox Christians made up 1.6% of the total Belgian population in 2015. The region with the greatest proportion of Eastern Orthodox Christians was the Bruxelles-Capital Region, in which they formed 8.3% of the population. Ipsos&#x27; survey in 2016 found that Orthodox Christianity was the religion of about 1% of the working-age, internet connected Belgians. The Eastern Orthodox Church in Belgium is subdivided into several canonical jurisdictions: Russian, Ecumenical, Serbian, Romanian, and Bulgarian.

There are significant Armenian communities that reside in Belgium, many of them are descendants of traders who settled during the 19th century. Most Armenian Belgians are adherents of the Armenian Apostolic Church, with smaller numbers belonging to the Armenian Catholic Church or the Armenian Evangelical Church. These churches have not yet received official recognition.

=== Islam ===

In 2015, according to the Eurobarometer survey made by the European Commission, 5.2% of the total Belgian population was Muslim. In a 2016 study, Ipsos found that 3% of the working-age, internet connected Belgian population declaring to be believers in Islam.

As of 2015, it was estimated that 7% of the Belgians (781,887) were Muslims, including 329,749 in Flanders (forming 5.1% of the region&#x27;s population), 174,136 in Wallonia (4.9%), and 277,867 in Brussels (23.6%).

===Judaism===


There is a small but long-standing Jewish community concentrated in Antwerp.

===Buddhism===

Eurobarometer 2015 found only 0.2% of the total Belgian population declaring to be Buddhist. Despite that, one year later Ipsos found that 2% of the working-age, internet connected Belgians were Buddhists.

===Confucianism===

According to Ipsos, 1% of the working-age, internet-connected Belgians declared that they believed in Confucianism. This segment of the population may include many – if not all – the Chinese communities in Belgium.

===Hinduism===

Hinduism forms a negligible but growing minority in Belgium. In 2006, there were about 6,500 Hindus in the country. this increased to 7,901 Hindus in 2015 and 10,000 in 2020. The majority of Hindus in Belgium originate from Nepal, some come from diamond trading communities in India, and some are native converts, mostly of the ISKON movement. Hindus in Belgium in 2023 push to be recognized as an official religion in Belgium.

===Antoinism===

Antoinism is a Christian-inspired new religious movement which was created by Louis-Joseph Antoine (1846–1912). It remains the only significant such movement to originate in Belgium and has adherents in France and elsewhere.

=== Jainism ===

Jainism is an Indian religion which has around 2,000 adherents in Belgium (as of 2020), consisting mainly of Indian migrants who specialize in the diamond trade within Antwerp. The Shankheswar Parshvanath Jain temple, which is located in the Antwerpian municipality of Wilrijk, remains the only Jain temple within continental Europe.

==History==


===6th–7th century: Christianisation===

After the Roman period, Christianity was brought back to the southern Low Countries by missionary saints like Willibrord and Amandus. In the 7th century, abbeys were founded in remote places, and it was mainly from these abbeys that the Christianization process was started. This process was expanded under the auspices of the Merovingian dynasty, and later by Charlemagne, who even waged war to impose the new religion.

===17th–18th century: Catholicism as the state religion===

From the Spanish military conquest of 1592 until the re-establishment of religious freedom in 1781 by the Patent of Toleration under Joseph II of Austria, Catholicism was the only religion allowed, on penalty of death, in the territories now forming Belgium. However, a small number of Protestant groups managed to survive at Maria-Horebeke, Dour, Tournai, Eupen, and Hodimont.

===19th–20th century===

Religion was one of the differences between the almost solidly Catholic south and the predominantly Protestant north of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, formed in 1815. The union broke up in 1830 when the south seceded to form the Kingdom of Belgium. In Belgium&#x27;s first century, Catholicism was such a binding factor socially that it prevailed over the language divide (Dutch versus French). The decline in religion&#x27;s importance as a social marker across late-20th-century Western Europe explains to a large extent the current centrifugal forces in Belgium, with language differences (increasingly reinforced by a positive feedback effect in the media) no longer being kept in check by a religious binding factor. If anything, the Catholic Church has acquiesced to these changes by having a Dutch-speaking university (Katholieke Universiteit Leuven) and a French-speaking university (Universite Catholique de Louvain).

Until the late 20th century, Catholicism played an important role in Belgian politics. One significant example was the so-called Schools&#x27; Wars (Dutch: &quot;schoolstrijd&quot;; French: &quot;guerres scolaires&quot;) between the country&#x27;s philosophically left-wing parties (liberals at first, joined by Socialists later) and the Catholic party (later the Christian Democrats), which took place from 1879 to 1884 and from 1954 to 1958. Another important controversy happened in 1990, when the Catholic monarch, King Baudouin I, refused to ratify an abortion bill that had been approved by Parliament. The king asked Prime Minister Wilfried Martens and his government to find a solution, which proved novel. The government declared King Baudouin unfit to fulfill his constitutional duties as monarch for one day. Government ministers signed the bill in his place and then proceeded to reinstate the king after the abortion law had come into effect.

===21st century===

In 2002, the officially recognized Protestant denomination at the time, the United Protestant Church of Belgium (consisting of around 100 member churches, usually with a Calvinist or Methodist past) and the unsubsidized Federal Synod of Protestant and Evangelical Churches (which had 600 member churches in 2008 but did not include all Evangelical and Charismatic groups outside the Catholic tradition) together formed the Administrative Council of the Protestant and Evangelical Religion (ARPEE in Dutch, CACPE in French). The council is now the accepted mouthpiece of Protestantism in all three linguistic communities of Belgium: Dutch, French, and German.

The 21st century has witnessed significant changes in the religious demography of Belgium, characterized by a decline of Catholicism and the growth of irreligion and other religions, some of them brought by waves of immigration from foreign countries, including Pentecostalism, Orthodox Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism and Chinese religions.

Apart from Islam, however, these groups are very small demographically, especially alongside the unaffiliated demographic of 37%.

<doc id="662647" wikidata="Q994859" url="?curid=662647" title="Homocystinuria">
<text>Homocystinuria (HCU) is an inherited disorder of the metabolism of the amino acid methionine due to a deficiency of cystathionine beta synthase or methionine synthase. It is an inherited autosomal recessive trait, which means a child needs to inherit a copy of the defective gene from both parents to be affected. Symptoms of homocystinuria can also be caused by a deficiency of vitamins B6, B12, or folate.

==Signs and symptoms==
This defect leads to a multi-systemic disorder of the connective tissue, muscles, central nervous system (CNS), and cardiovascular system. Homocystinuria represents a group of hereditary metabolic disorders characterized by an accumulation of the amino acid homocysteine in the serum and an increased excretion of homocysteine in the urine. Infants appear to be normal and early symptoms, if any are present, are vague.

Signs and symptoms of homocystinuria that may be seen include the following:
==Cause==
It is usually caused by the deficiency of the enzyme cystathionine beta synthase, mutations of other related enzymes such as methionine synthase, or the deficiency of folic acid, vitamin B12 and/or pyridoxine (vitamin B6).

==Diagnosis==
The term homocystinuria describes an increased excretion of the thiol amino acid homocysteine in urine (and incidentally, also an increased concentration in plasma). The source of this increase may be one of many metabolic factors, only one of which is CBS deficiency. Others include the re-methylation defects (cobalamin defects, methionine synthase deficiency, MTHFR) and vitamin deficiencies including riboflavin (vitamin B2), pyridoxal phosphate (vitamin B6), folate (vitamin B9), and cobalamin (vitamin B12). In light of this, a combined approach to laboratory diagnosis is required to reach a differential diagnosis.

CBS deficiency may be diagnosed by routine metabolic biochemistry. Genetic testing may be used to screen for known SNPs (mutations). In the first instance, plasma or urine amino acid analysis will frequently show an elevation of methionine and the presence of homocysteine. Many neonatal screening programs include methionine as a metabolite. The disorder may be distinguished from the re-methylation defects (e.g., MTHFR, methionine synthase deficiency, or the cobalamin defects) in lieu of the elevated methionine concentration. Additionally, organic acid analysis or quantitative determination of methylmalonic acid should help to exclude cobalamin (vitamin B12) defects and vitamin B12 deficiency giving a differential diagnosis.

The laboratory analysis of homocysteine itself is complicated because most homocysteine (possibly above 85%) is bound to other thiol amino acids and proteins in the form of disulphides (e.g., cysteine in cystine-homocysteine, homocysteine in homocysteine-homocysteine) via disulfide bonds. Since as an equilibrium process the proportion of free homocysteine is variable a true value of total homocysteine (free + bound) is useful for confirming diagnosis and particularly for monitoring of treatment efficacy. To this end it is prudent to perform total homocyst(e)ine analysis in which all disulphide bonds are subject to reduction prior to analysis, traditionally by HPLC after derivatisation with a fluorescent agent, thus giving a true reflection of the quantity of homocysteine in a plasma sample.

==Treatment==
No specific cure has been discovered for homocystinuria; however, many people are treated using high doses of vitamin B6 (also known as pyridoxine). Slightly less than 50% respond to this treatment and need to take supplemental vitamin B6 for the rest of their lives. Those who do not respond usually respond to supplementation with folic acid and trimethylglycine (betaine). Typically this is mediated by cystathionine beta-synthase activity, i.e. those who have adequate CBS activity typically respond to B6 . Occasionally adding cysteineto the diet can be helpful, as glutathione is synthesized from cysteine (so adding cysteine can be important to reduce oxidative stress). Riboflavin, a cofactor for the MTHFR enzyme pathway and multiple glutathione-related pathways, may also be used.

Betaine (N,N,N-trimethylglycine) is used to reduce concentrations of homocysteine by promoting the conversion of homocysteine back to methionine, i.e., increasing flux through the re-methylation pathway independent of folate derivatives (which is mainly active in the liver and in the kidneys). The re-formed methionine is then gradually removed by incorporation into body protein. The methionine that is not converted into protein is converted to S-adenosyl-methionine which goes on to form homocysteine again. Betaine is, therefore, only effective if the quantity of methionine to be removed is small. Hence treatment includes both betaine and a diet low in methionine. In classical homocystinuria (CBS, or cystathione beta synthase deficiency), the plasma methionine level usually increases above the normal range of 30 micromoles/L and the concentrations should be monitored as potentially toxic levels (more than 400 micromoles/L) may be reached.

===Recommended diet===
For the subset of patients whose homocystinuria is caused by cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency (i.e. those that do not respond to B6 supplementation), low-protein food is recommended for this disorder, which requires food products low in particular types of amino acids (e.g., methionine) in addition to supplementation.

==Prognosis==
The life expectancy of patients with homocystinuria is reduced only if untreated. It is known that before the age of 30, almost one quarter of patients die as a result of thrombotic complications (e.g., heart attack).

==Society and culture==
One theory suggests that Akhenaten, a pharaoh of the eighteenth dynasty of Egypt, may have had homocystinuria.

<text>The National Assessment Agency (NAA) was, until December 2008, a subsidiary unit of the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA), an executive non-departmental public body (NDPB) of the Department for Education and Skills (now the Department for Education) in England and Wales. The agency was based on Bolton Street in west London.

==History==
First announced in November 2003, the agency was not officially launched until April 2004. The agency took over the delivery and administration of the National Curriculum Tests in England, previously undertaken by the QCA to whom they are accountable.

==Functions==
As well as being responsible for the national curriculum tests, the agency worked work with examination bodies in further reforms of the GCSE and A-level examinations in England and Wales.

===Examination reforms===
The agency claimed that it would modernise the examination system, for which it was given a remit from the government of £100m. The remit covered a two-year period from 2004 to 2006. The NAA&#x27;s Managing Director was David Gee. He was forced to leave on 16 December 2008.

===Administration of tests===
Whilst the NAA took over the administrative task of test delivery, QCA retained their role in regulating testing standards. Prior to the launch of the NAA, Charles Clarke, the then Secretary of State for Education and Skills stated that the separation of these two roles, made possible by the creation of the new agency, would decrease what was regarded by the government as conflicting responsibilities.

<doc id="662671" wikidata="Q1149167" url="?curid=662671" title="Chinese mantis">
<text>The Chinese mantis (Tenodera sinensis) is a species of mantis native to Asia and the nearby islands. In 1896, this species was accidentally introduced by a nursery tender at Mt. Airy near Philadelphia, United States. &quot;Tenodera sinensis&quot; often is erroneously referred to as &quot;Tenodera aridifolia sinensis&quot; because it was at first described as a subspecies of &quot;Tenodera aridifolia&quot;, but &quot;Tenodera sinensis&quot; is now established as a full species.

&quot;Tenodera sinensis&quot; feeds primarily on other insects, though adult females sometimes catch small vertebrates. For example, they have been observed feeding on hornets, spiders, grasshoppers, katydids, small reptiles, amphibians, and even hummingbirds. Like most mantids, they are known to be cannibalistic. One study found that cannibalism occurs in up to 50% of matings. These mantids have been observed eating the larvae of monarch butterflies, while discarding the entrails.

==Description==

The Chinese mantis is a long, slender, brown and green praying mantis. It is typically longer than other praying mantis species, reaching just over , and is the largest mantis species in North America (spread throughout the Northeast United States). Its color can vary from overall green to brown with a green lateral stripe on the borders of the front wings in the brown color form. In low light, the eyes of the mantis appear black, but in daylight appear to be clear, matching the color of the head. Chinese mantids look similar to another mantis species that has been introduced to the United States, the narrow-winged mantid (&quot;Tenodera angustipennis&quot;). &quot;Tenodera sinensis&quot; and &quot;Tenodera angustipennis&quot; are similar in appearance; however, it is possible to tell them apart by locating a spot in between their front legs, as the spot is yellow in the Chinese mantis but orange in the narrow-winged mantis. The female can produce several semi-spherical oothecae, roughly in diameter, containing up to 300 eggs. The oothecae are often affixed to vegetation such as bushes and small trees.
==Native range==
This mantis is native to China, Japan, the Korean Peninsula, Micronesia, and Thailand. Populations of &quot;T. sinensis&quot; in Japan are sympatric with &quot;Tenodera aridifolia&quot;, the Japanese giant mantis, of which &quot;T. sinensis&quot; was formerly considered a subspecies.

=== Invasive status ===
The Chinese mantis is regarded by some experts as invasive in various regions of the United States, particularly where the native Carolina mantis (&quot;Stagmomantis carolina&quot;) is found. While commonly sold for pest control, it is said that Chinese mantids lack effectiveness in pest management. As ambush predators, they attack anything within reach that they can subdue, but they do not actively hunt for insect pests. Their non-selective predatory behavior and significant size has led to documented attacks on beneficial insects such as pollinators, small birds, mammals, frogs, and snakes. As a result, the Chinese mantis can alter food webs and affect the dynamics of local insect populations.

==Growth==
Chinese mantises hatch in the spring, eat, grow, and molt through the summer, and lay eggs at the end of summer. When it gets too cold, they die, only living around a year long. First instar nymphs that eat less take a longer time to molt to the next instar and are smaller at the second instar than first instar nymphs that have been fed more.

==Captivity==
&quot;Tenodera sinensis&quot; is a common pet for mantis enthusiasts, and oothecae can be purchased from plant nurseries across the US.

== Predators ==
The Chinese mantis is preyed on by other mantises, birds, and the Asian giant hornet in its native range. The female mantis specifically preys on male mantises. She often kills and eats her male partner after mating, providing nutrition for her offspring. Sexual cannibalism is a strange phenomenon not yet completely understood by scientists.

== Similar species ==
The European mantis (&quot;Mantis religiosa&quot;) and the Carolina mantis (&quot;Stagmomantis carolina&quot;) are both smaller mantises closely resembling the Chinese mantis. The European mantis is anywhere from tan to green in color and about 7.5 cm (3 in) long. The Carolina mantis, on the other hand, is only 6 cm (2.5 in) in length and varies more in color.

== Culture ==
There are two martial arts styles created to mimic the movements of the Chinese mantis. Developed in the Shandong province of China in the mid-17th century, Praying Mantis kung-fu is based on the quick movements and techniques of the Chinese mantis. An unrelated style of kung fu that was developed by the Hakka people in Southern China is known as Southern Praying Mantis.

Master Mantis, one of the supporting characters in the 2008 Dreamworks Animation film franchise &quot;Kung Fu Panda&quot;, is a Chinese mantis and one of the members of the Furious Five.

<text>The Royal Automobile Club of Australia (RACA) is an Australian motoring organisation, which has also incorporated the Australian Imperial Services Club since 1987.

The RACA was established in March 1903 in Sydney, and is the oldest motoring club in Australia, founded by Henry Alfred ‘Harrie’ Skinner, WE Fisher and HE Jones.
The organisation also advocated for specific localised issues for motorists in Sydney.
The Royal Automobile Club of Australia had an important role in shaping early motoring legislation, in safeguarding the rights of motorists, and in establishing motorsport in Australia. 

In the 1920s and 1930s it was involved in organising hill climbing races, and similar events in New South Wales.

Most states of Australia have organisations named &quot;Royal Automobile Club&quot; with the state names added:Royal Automobile Club of Queensland, Royal Automobile Club of Tasmania, Royal Automobile Club of Victoria, Royal Automobile Club of Western Australia.

The organisation used to provide roadside service and insurance but in 1945 in an agreement with the 
NRMA ceased offering these services with members gaining reciprocal access to NRMA provided services.
The RACA is a member of the Australian Automobile Association.

<doc id="662681" wikidata="Q16025290" url="?curid=662681" title="Henry Skinner (businessman)">
<text>Henry Alfred &#x27;Harrie Skinner (July 12, 1854 – October 1936) was the founder of the [[Royal Automobile Club of Australia]] (RACA). He was a photographic pioneer and was a manager of a circus.

== Early life ==
Skinner was born in England on 12 July 1854. He came with his parents to Sydney around 1870, eventually settling in Melbourne. From there he found a bank job. At age 21, he decided to run off and join the circus. The circus he joined was called Cooper and Bailey&#x27;s Great American International Circus.

== Career ==
In his 1936 obituary in The Truth, Harrie went on to run various sideshows, becoming a manager for Harrie Rickards. Harrie Skinner was the scheme behind several celebrities such as the US Minstrels, Ada Ward and Millie Walton and the &quot;Fakir of Oolu&quot; (actually an English magician called Sylvester, who performed Indian-style levitations). It is likely that Harrie introduced the gramophone to Sydney with a stage performance in mind – the first gramophones were pitted against live musicians in theatre.

He was in Sydney as early as 1878, when he took control of the Pier Hotel in Manly, and afterwards the Tivoli in Castlereagh Street and the Agincourt in George Street. For 11 years from 1882 he published Skinner&#x27;s NSW Gazetteer, detailing timetables, postal and telegraph information according to the Evening News &quot;replete with all information commonly found in such publications and much that is not&quot;. The Gazetteer was a success, but foundered when the Commissioners for Railways began publishing their own timetables &quot;at about one fourth of the cost of production&quot;.

His theatrical management continued, with 27 years spent as the sole manager of the Palace Theatre, and some time as acting manager of the Tivoli. With the eye for spectacle, Harrie was the only businessman who agreed to back a foreign aviator who arrived in Sydney claiming he would build a machine that would flap its wings and fly. Harrie charged thousands of spectators to see the machine during its construction in a Castlereagh Street allotment, and interest reached high following a trial run with a donkey engine and the construction of a runway down one of the hills over Chowder Bay. Ferry boats kept a cautious distance below, with all the passengers paying the promoters for the privilege of their close-up view.

While the foreign aviator was keen to go ahead with the flight of his machine, Harrie had few illusions as to the likelihood of success and, fearing for the life of the pilot, arranged for the chocks holding the machine to be deliberately kicked out. The machine rolled down the hill without a pilot, hitting the water with a great splash and sinking like a stone. The machine&#x27;s builder was distraught, despite his share of the takings, and stories were placed in the newspapers about &quot;ruffians from Woolloomooloo&quot; sabotaging the flight.

== Founding of the Royal Automobile Club of Australia ==
Harrie Skinner&#x27;s love of machines made him an enthusiast for the new automobiles arriving in Sydney, and he purchased his De Dion car from retail baron Mark Foy, who would later become another founding member of the Royal Automobile Club of Australia.
The story of his founding of the club is detailed down below.

The following tale relates a trip taken with good friend William &#x27;Billy&#x27; Elliott driving a new vehicle to Bulli one Saturday. 
&quot;Mr Elliott worked on the car all Friday night and we set off about 9.30 in the morning, hoping to arrive at Bulli about lunch time,&quot; Mr Skinner later recalled. &quot;Everything went well until we reached the turning to Helensburgh, via Brown&#x27;s Hill, and the top Sandy Road via Bulli Pass. Here we discovered the petrol was running out too quickly. Additional supplies had been sent to Bulli by rail.

&quot;At the top of Brown&#x27;s Hill, Billy said, &#x27;Here&#x27;s where we save some petrol&#x27;. He shut off the supply and started to coast down the hill. After going about 20 yards the pace became a cracker.

&quot;I said, &#x27;What&#x27;s up?&#x27; and Billy replied, &#x27;The damned brakes won&#x27;t work!&#x27; Next, he tried to put his gears in, but they stripped, and off we went on our mad race.

&quot;Two tires burst, we jumped water-courses, and the scenery rushed past in whirling array. There were two cows on the road; one went up the hill and the other down.

&quot;There was no fence in those days and few places where a cart could pass. Fortunately, we met none. At the bottom Billy drove sideways into an embankment. Four tires were burst and missing, the gears were gone and our nerves were not functioning well. Billy says we reached 150 miles an hour (241.4 kilometers per hour). My estimate was 500. With the assistance of three different horses, we reached our destination at 7.30 PM. Ultimately, one of the brakes was found in the back of the car.&quot;

In the early days when horseless carriages were still drawing crowds of onlookers wherever they went, the difficulty was finding a place to stop the car. One day Harrie Skinner took his wife for a drive to La Perouse. On arriving, a tire was flat, and he proceeded to pump the tyre up, surrounded by an audience of hundreds, according to a story printed in &quot;The Motor&quot; in 1927, Mrs Skinner objected to this publicity, and threatened never to get into the car again. To please her, Skinner drove into the bush away from prying eyes, and continued working on the car. While he was busy, three young fellows drove up in a horse-drawn cart, and sensed that something was wrong.

&quot;Can we gi&#x27; yer a hand?&quot;

&quot;No, thanks,&quot; replied Mr Skinner.

&quot;Gi&#x27; yer a pull?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Well, can we take yer tart?&quot;

== Driving examiner ==
As car numbers began to increase on New South Wales roads, and public safety became an issue for police, the authorities, who had already worked in close association with the club on motoring issues, approached it to provide an experienced driver to undertake the examination of drivers for licences. Harrie was nominated as the member &quot;with the most time on his hands&quot; — a surprising statement given his level of activity. He was authorised to examine drivers and issue certificates.

Harrie Skinner&#x27;s work for the RACA and his founding role earned him the honour of the first Honorary Life Membership of what was by then the Royal Automobile Club of Australia. A year before his death in 1936, an honorary portrait of him was unveiled at a special presentation at the RACA&#x27;s Club House in Macquarie Street, where it remains on display.

== Death ==
Skinner died in October 1936 presumably at the age of 81. His body was buried in Waverley Cemetery, with his self-penned epitaph on his headstone:

&quot;Life is Done, Time Ends, Eternity&#x27;s Begun&quot;.

&quot;Life was a funny proposition after all.&quot;

<text>Katherine Rich (née Allison, born 16 December 1967) served as a member of the New Zealand House of Representatives for the National Party from 1999 to 2008. She has been chief executive of the New Zealand Food &amp; Grocery Council, an industry lobby group, since 2009.

==Early life and family==
Rich was born in Australia on 16 December 1967, the daughter of agricultural scientist Jock Allison, and moved to New Zealand in 1969. She was educated at St Hilda&#x27;s Collegiate School in Dunedin from 1980 to 1985, and studied at the University of Otago, from where she graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce in 1990 and a Bachelor of Arts in 1993. When she voted for the first time, in the , she gave her vote to her uncle, the Labour MP Clive Matthewson.

After leaving university she held a number of management and analytical roles in both the public and private sectors. Her jobs were:
* Project analyst for the Ministry of Agriculture in Palmerston North
* Project analyst for the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology in Wellington
* Marketing manager for the knitting yarns division of Alliance Textiles
* General manager of Silverstream Ltd in Dunedin

==Political career==

===Member of Parliament===

Rich entered Parliament in 1999 as a list MP for the National Party. At this election, Rich was ranked twenty-third on the National list, a very high placing for someone not already in Parliament. She had contested the Dunedin North electorate, but finished second behind incumbent Labour MP Pete Hodgson. However, even though National lost government, her ranking on the party list was high enough for her to enter Parliament.

Once in Parliament, Rich rose quickly through the National Party hierarchy, and eventually was ranked fourth in the party caucus. At various times she served as her Party&#x27;s spokesperson for employment, broadcasting, economic development, state-owned enterprises, and culture. In January 2005, however, she refused to give full support to the &quot;tough-on-welfare&quot; Orewa Speech by then-party leader Don Brash, who demoted her to tenth place and dismissed her as social welfare spokesperson and gave the portfolio to Judith Collins. Following the resignation of Don Brash as National Party leader on 27 November 2006, the incoming Leader of the Opposition, John Key, elevated Rich to eighth place within the National caucus and shadow Cabinet. She was appointed, on 1 December 2006, the party&#x27;s spokesperson on education. Some notable achievements included co-presenting to Parliament a petition for a Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Peter Ellis case (2003); exposing a huge rise in the number of unallocated cases of physically and sexually abused children (2005); highlighting Labour Government inaction over understaffed PlunketLine (2005); leading National&#x27;s support for a bill to allow mothers in prison to keep their babies with them until they turn two (2006); revealing irresponsible government spending, including the hip-hop tour spending debacle (2004). She was also the only National MP prepared to cross the floor and vote for the &#x27;anti-smacking bill&#x27; in 2007 prior to the compromise clause 4 being added.

In 2002, Rich was the second woman MP (after Ruth Richardson) to take her baby to parliament and breastfeed there.

For both the 2002 and 2005 general elections, Rich stood unsuccessfully in the Dunedin North electorate, but was returned as a list MP. She announced, on 13 February 2008, that she would not stand in the 2008 general election, saying that she wanted to spend more time with her children. She was replaced as National candidate for Dunedin North by Michael Woodhouse.

=== Political views ===
Rich, who has described her own position as &quot;centrist&quot; and &quot;centre right&quot;, had a reputation as one of the more liberal members of the National Party. She was the inaugural parliamentary co-chair of the party&#x27;s internal Classical Liberal Policy Advisory Group, which advocates policies that are both economically and socially liberal.

National MP Nikki Kaye, herself known for what has been described as &quot;socially liberal&quot; views, has cited her as a role model.

==Career after Parliament==
Rich took up the position of Chief Executive of the New Zealand Food &amp; Grocery Council in March 2009, following appointment in November 2008. The Council represents grocery manufacturers and suppliers.

She was appointed to the board of the Health Promotion Agency in June 2012. Prime Minister John Key of the National Party said she would be able to manage conflicts of interest with her role with the Food &amp; Grocery Council.

She has been on the National Advisory Council for the Employment of Women since 2016, and has been on the board of children’s charity Barnardos NZ since 2014. In 2013, she was appointed to the APEC Business Advisory Council, and stepped down in 2019.

===&quot;Dirty Politics&quot; controversy===

Emails leaked to political writer Nicky Hager implied that Rich, in her role as Chief Executive of the Food &amp; Grocery Council, and while on the board of the Health Promotion Agency (a Crown entity), had given prominent blogger Cameron Slater information that rebutted comments made by academics. These allegations were denied by Rich. HPA chair Lee Mathias said she believed any potential conflicts of interest with Rich&#x27;s dual roles had been managed in terms of the State Services Commission&#x27;s guidelines. &quot;She&#x27;s been a very strong supporter of every decision made by this agency.&quot;
A subsequent review of Rich&#x27;s role by the Auditor-General found no conflict of interest and Rich said she felt vindicated by the Auditor-General&#x27;s declaration. She said &quot;I&#x27;m pleased with the result, which vindicates my position. Accusations that I had broken the law and not declared interests were disappointing, wrong and defamatory.”

On 3 March 2021, the New Zealand news site Newsroom reported Rich and the Food and Grocery Council had made a confidential settlement with academics Boyd Swinburn, Doug Sellman and Shane Bradbrook after they sued for defamation. The plaintiff&#x27;s lawyers told the judge in the case that Rich was keen to keep the settlement confidential. The PR firm of Carrick Graham, another defendant, had received $365,619 from the Food and Grocery Council between November 2009 and July 2016. Rich said the Food and Grocery Council &quot;did not pay anyone to write any stories on its behalf on Whale Oil, or any other publication&quot;. Nor was it otherwise involved in any such stories. She told NZ Listener that Bradbrook, whose complaints comprised nearly half of the trio&#x27;s action, earlier conceded his case and was ordered to pay &quot;considerable&quot; costs. She also said the [plaintiffs failed to prove one of their most serious allegations – that she and the Food and Grocery Council planted objectionable material blackguarding them on the Whale Oil blog.

<doc id="662698" wikidata="Q4381660" url="?curid=662698" title="Sonjay Dutt">
<text>Retesh Bhalla (born April 7, 1982) is an American professional wrestler signed to All Elite Wrestling (AEW) as a producer and manager. He is best known for his time with Total Nonstop ActionImpact Wrestling under the ring name Sonjay Dutt. He also worked for WWE as a producer from 2019 to 2021.

Dutt is known for his several stints in Jeff Jarrett&#x27;s promotion Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), later renamed Impact Wrestling, where he started in 2003. Dutt competed in the X-Division for several years, winning the Impact X Division Championship in 2017. He also competed for Jarrett&#x27;s Global Force Wrestling, where he was a former GFW NEX*GEN Champion. Dutt also wrestled for the independent promotion Combat Zone Wrestling during his early years, where he captured the CZW World Junior Heavyweight Championship and won the Best of the Best tournament in 2004. Due to his contributions, he was inducted into the CZW Hall of Fame in 2019. His ring name is modeled after that of famous Bollywood actor Sanjay Dutt.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career (2000–2004)===
Dutt&#x27;s parents moved from India to the United States before he was born, though most of his extended family still lives in New Delhi. He later worked for KYDA Pro wrestling for the first two years of his professional career.

Dutt got his first break wrestling in Major League Wrestling (MLW) in 2003 where he debuted the Dragon Rana on Jimmy Yang at the promotion&#x27;s August 3 event, &quot;Summer Apocalypse&quot;. Dutt would go on to win an international tournament, hosted by MLW in September 2003 to win the company&#x27;s Junior Heavyweight Championship, defeating Tony Mamaluke, Eddie Colón, and Christopher Daniels. In an early 2004 MLW Junior Heavyweight Title match Dutt pinned Jack Evans to retain the title at &quot;MLW Reloaded&quot;.

===NWA Total Nonstop Action (2003–2009)===
Dutt made his debut for NWA Total Nonstop Action (TNA) on October 15, 2003, when he teamed with Eric Young to defeat Jerrelle Clark and El Fuego in a tag team match. He began working regularly for the promotion the following year. In May 2004, Dutt began a Best of Three Series with Amazing Red to determine the number one contender to the TNA X Division Championship, which Red won. Throughout the summer of 2004 Dutt participated in the America&#x27;s X-Cup as a part of Team USA along with Jerry Lynn, Chris Sabin, and Elix Skipper against Team AAA (Héctor Garza, Mr. Águila, Juventud Guerrera, and Abismo Negro). After several months, Dutt became the onscreen protégé of Sabu, with Raven using him to vicariously assault Sabu. In addition, Dutt acted as a mouthpiece for the perpetually mute Sabu. This angle was postponed and then dropped after Sabu was sidelined with various health problems, and in the interim Dutt made appearances with World Wrestling Entertainment, provoking rumors of an imminent contract offer.

Dutt&#x27;s presence in TNA was reduced in late-2004 and early-2005 during the tenure of Dusty Rhodes as booker, but his role within the promotion was once again expanded after Rhodes resigned. Dutt won a four-way X Division match at No Surrender on July 17, 2005, to qualify for the 2005 Super X Cup. He lost to Samoa Joe, however, in the first round of the tournament.

In September 2005, Dutt, Shark Boy, and Simon Diamond spent two weeks in India, where they visited several cities, promoting the debut of &quot;Impact!&quot; on ESPN Star Sports. On September 28 in Bhopal, a riot broke out when 1000 fans were excluded from an event after attendance exceeded expectations. None of the three TNA wrestlers were injured.

At Bound for Glory on October 23, Dutt defeated Austin Aries, Roderick Strong, and Alex Shelley in a four way X Division match on the pre-show. In 2006, Dutt earned a spot on Team USA in the 2006 World X Cup.
Throughout late 2006 and early 2007, Dutt was involved in the Paparazzi Championship Series, led by Kevin Nash, who insinuated throughout the PCS Challenge that Dutt was taking steroids, as a running joke, which would usually lead to the hotheaded Dutt comically losing his temper. Although he did not win the series, it put him over with the fans. After PCS ended, Nash took Dutt and his newfound tag team partner Jay Lethal under his wing and promised to give them an extreme makeover. After Lethal got a new character mimicking the &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage, Nash attempted to get Dutt a new character as well. All of these attempts were Kevin Nash&#x27;s past gimmicks, including Oz, Vinnie Vegas, and Diesel, all of which Dutt despised.

On the April 26 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Dutt and Lethal won a shot at the X Division Championship held by Chris Sabin at Sacrifice. Dutt was unhappy at Lethal getting the pinfall, however, Dutt and Lethal started fighting with each other. Kevin Nash came out and separated the two, but Dutt kicked him and left the ring. On a later episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Dutt apologized to Nash and claimed &quot;it was the heat of the moment&quot;. Nash forgave Dutt but warned him not to do it again.

On June 7, Dutt introduced a new gimmick reminiscent of a New Age guru in which he called himself &quot;The Guru&quot; Sonjay Dutt. As part of the gimmick, he began dressing all in white, and apologized to Nash and Lethal for his behavior. At Victory Road, Dutt competed in the 10 man Ultimate X match in an attempt to become the number one contender for the X Division Championship, but was eliminated in the Gauntlet portion of the match.

Dutt and Lethal began to have some problems when Dutt began showing interest in Lethal&#x27;s on-screen girlfriend SoCal Val. Dutt participated in the Xscape match at Lockdown where he was the first participant eliminated. At Slammiversary, Dutt ruined Lethal and SoCal Val&#x27;s wedding, when he begged Val to marry him instead. Dutt attacked Lethal, and began a villainous turn, which led to Dutt and Lethal facing off in matches at Victory Road and Hard Justice, splitting the victories. At No Surrender, Val turned on Lethal and assisted Dutt in winning a &quot;Ladder of Love&quot; ladder match. On February 20, 2009, Dutt left TNA after his contract expired due to he and TNA management being unable to come to terms on a new deal.

===Independent circuit (2009–2019)===

Since making his TNA debut, he has worked for independent promotions such as Ring of Honor, UWA, Combat Zone Wrestling, MXW Pro Wrestling, VCW and NWA Virginia and has toured Japan with Pro Wrestling Zero1. He also has wrestled for HUSTLE in Japan as a member of the stable Takada Monster Army under the ring name &quot;Monster J&quot;. On July 28, 2006, Dutt lost to Último Dragón in UWA. In November 2006, Sonjay returned to UWA and won the 2006 Grand Prix Tournament Championship.

On May 9, 2008, Dutt was announced as the eighth and final participant in the Chikara 2008 Rey de Voladores tournament, having previously competed in the 2007 King of Trios alongside The Motor City Machine Guns (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin) as Team TNA. On June 21, 2008, he appeared at a Combat Zone Wrestling show, where he was defeated by Pinkie Sanchez. He appeared on the July 12, 2008 show to team with Chuck Taylor in a losing effort against Pinkie Sanchez and Ruckus. On September 19, 2008, he teamed up with Shelley and Sabin to challenge Último Guerrero, Atlantis, and Negro Casas for the CMLL World Trios Championship at the company&#x27;s 75th Anniversary Show, but were unable to defeat the reigning champions.

After leaving TNA, Dutt returned to Japan to compete for Pro Wrestling Zero1, after a four-year hiatus, and on March 15, 2009, defeated Ikuto Hidaka to win the Zero1 International Junior Heavyweight Championship. Dutt vacated the title on November 29, 2009, for the Tenka-Ichi 2009 tournament. He attempted to regain the title, but was eliminated from the tournament in the semifinals by Prince Devitt.

Dutt made his Pro Wrestling Guerrilla debut on April 11, 2009, at &quot;Ninety-Nine&quot;, where he defeated Roderick Strong in a singles match. The following day at &quot;One Hundred&quot;, the promotion&#x27;s 100th show, he was defeated by El Generico. Since leaving TNA, Dutt has also begun making appearances for Ring of Honor. He made his return to the company on May 8, 2009, in Boston, Massachusetts, wrestling in a 3-way dance with Eddie Edwards and Bryan Danielson, who ended up winning the match. On August 31 Dutt made his &quot;Ring of Honor Wrestling&quot; debut in a losing effort against Delirious, with whom he would feud for the rest of the year.

After an eleven-month break from Ring of Honor, Dutt returned to the promotion on December 17, 2010, replacing an injured Kenny Omega and facing ROH World Champion Roderick Strong in a losing effort in a non–title match. At the following day&#x27;s Final Battle 2010 pay-per-view Dutt again replaced Omega and faced Eddie Edwards in another losing effort.
In 2011, it was revealed that Dutt would take part in a new hiphop/pro wrestling collaboration, the Urban Wrestling Federation, with taping of the first event &quot;First Blood&quot; taking place on June 3.

<text>The NRMA (trading name of National Roads and Motorists&#x27; Association) is an Australian organisation offering roadside assistance, advocacy for motorists and road-users, motoring advice, car servicing, International Driving Permits, travel, and other services in all of Australia except Victoria. It is a member-owned mutual company limited by guarantee. It was formed in 1920.

Prior to 2000, the organisation offered mutual insurance but that part of the business was demutualised and spun out as NRMA Insurance, which is now part of Insurance Australia Group. NRMA and NRMA Insurance are independent companies with an agreement to use the same brand name even though each company is responsible for distinguishing the difference between the two organisations.

==History==

===Early history===
====National Roads Association====

The Australian National Roads Association, which would become the NRMA, was launched in 1920. Its original aim was not to provide road service or insurance, but to obtain &quot;reasonable and just legislation&quot; to fund and improve roads.
The early 1900s brought the arrival of motorised road transport and car and truck use were gaining popularity. The government was placed under pressure to improve roads as competition increased with railways. The 1919 Local Government Act left all decisions to local councils, where decisions were made &quot;from the point of view of the local utility.&quot;

The 1950s heralded the beginning of a huge surge in the number of cars on Australian roads, and NRMA membership increased in kind. It hit one million members in the 1970s, and by the late 1980s, that number had doubled.

====Role of the RACA====
The Royal Automobile Club of Australia (RACA) had been campaigning for better roads since its creation. The club had initiated a Good Roads Association in 1912.

The National Roads Association aimed to become a broader and stronger pressure group with the same objectives as RACA, and it received full support from the latter. RACA&#x27;s President, WJ McKinney, and DM Cooper, the chairman of RACA&#x27;s Roads and Tours committee, were among the provisional committee members when the Association was formally established on 4 February 1920.

====Creation of NRMA and continued RACA involvement====

Former prime minister Chris Watson became NRA president in 1920 and served until his death in 1941. The National Roads Association was restructured as the National Roads and Motorists&#x27; Association at the beginning of 1924. With a goal strikingly similar to that of RACA, it positioned the NRMA as a competitor as much as a collaborator, particularly when it began to employ its own road service &quot;guides&quot;. These returned servicemen &quot;of exemplary character&quot; patrolled specific areas, including the popular beaches of Coogee, Bondi Beach and Bronte, or were based at congested spots on the roads out of the city where they could receive messages by phone or relayed by other motorists.
The NRMA attended a 1925 meeting convened by RACA on traffic regulations. Together with other motoring lobby groups, they resolved to draft suggested reforms. Particular concerns included the need for a special traffic court, and a change to the &quot;plethora of danger signs&quot; that had appeared in the streets, accompanied by &quot;frequently incomprehensible signals of police&quot; at intersections. As an alternative to the red triangle placed by police at danger spots.

====Launch of NRMA Insurance====

By 1925, NRMA had 7,637 members, nearly double the previous year&#x27;s. In that year NRMA formed NRMA Insurance, which also became a sub-agency of Lloyd&#x27;s of London, and offered new household policies in addition to motoring insurance.

The NRMA is now Australia-wide with the exception of Victoria.. 

====MyNRMA====
NRMA is a member-owned mutual organisation. In 2024, MyNRMA provided roadside assistance to over 2.8 million members in NSW. Outside NSW, service to MyNRMA members from NSW is provided by the other state-based motoring clubs such as RACV, RACQ and RAA. Likewise, when members from other states visit NSW MyNRMA provides roadside assistance to them. MyNRMA provides a range of discounts exclusive to members on products and services including roadside assistance, car servicing, car loans, driver training, batteries, and windscreen replacement. 

====Relationship with RACA====

When World War II began, it followed the RACA&#x27;s early lead in forming the NRMA Transport Auxiliary. This force of 500 drivers would provide rapid troop transport if required. Staff member, Miss K. Broadbent, organised a Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Transport Corps which trained 506 women to drive more complex vehicles such as trucks, ambulances and motorcycles.

At the end of the war, RACA made the decision to cease its road service operations. The NRMA&#x27;s growth had made its competing operations considerably wider in scope and reach. RACA&#x27;s members were served by an agreement with the NRMA whereby RACA membership included entitlement to full NRMA services. 

====Demutualisation====

NRMA Insurances&#x27; financial success had led to a huge accumulation of surplus funds which could not be distributed back to members and was attractive to outside interests. Insurance premium rebates to members had the effect of artificially and harmfully deflating the price of NRMA&#x27;s insurance products

After years of discussion and acrimony, NRMA Insurance Limited was demutualised in August 2000 and was separated from the National Roads and Motorists&#x27; Association Limited. NRMA Insurance Limited later changed its name to Insurance Australia Group.

====Separate paths====

NRMA remains a mutual company owned by its members. Insurance Australia Group is a listed company owned by its shareholders. It has a number of operating subsidiaries using the NRMA brand, including NRMA Insurance Limited, as well as a number of other insurance and related brands.

During 2004 and 2005, the NRMA, in a joint venture agreement with JF Meridian Trust, acquired the Travelodge Australia chain of hotels in Australia. This was sold in 2021.

In September 2006, the NRMA purchased a 75% shareholding in the Australian Thrifty Car Rental franchise from Mitsubishi Motors Australia. The deal was highlighted in the media and in NSW Parliament as potentially involving conflict of interest with the board member Gary Punch. In December 2008, the NRMA acquired the remaining 25% shareholding in Thrifty. In 2021 the Thrifty franchise was relinquished and the NRMA became a Sixt franchisee.

It has also continued to grow its travel and holiday operations by investing in tourist parks, and in January 2007, acquired a major stake in the travel wholesaler Adventure World. In March 2021, it was announced that the NRMA had purchased the Tasmanian tourism assets of the Royal Automobile Club of Tasmania (RACT) including Cradle Mountain Hotel, Freycinet Lodge, Gordon River Cruises and Strahan Village to be operated under the NRMA Expeditions brand. In November 2022, the NRMA acquired Pumphouse Point, located in the Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park, to also be operated under the NRMA Expeditions brand in Tasmania.

In 2017 the NRMA purchased Manly Fast Ferry.

==== EV ==== 
In 2012 the NRMA opened free public charging stations for electric vehicles in Sydney (fast charger) and Canberra. They also undertook electric vehicle roadshows to help raise awareness, and also trialled one of the first electric vehicles as roadside assistance vehicles.

====Criticism====
In 2008 the NRMA was criticised for its anti-cycleway stance. Lord Mayor of Sydney, Clover Moore, said the NRMA, like big petroleum companies, has a vested interest in campaigning for car use. Greens MP Lee Rhiannon said the NRMA has an anti-cycleway agenda. Said Rhiannon: &quot;The NRMA&#x27;s anti-cycleway campaign is a crude attempt to boost money for road building. It&#x27;s time the NRMA leadership came into the 21st century and recognised that encouraging more cyclists is an easy way to reduce road congestion.&quot; Rhiannon accused the NRMA of using misleading statistics in its campaign.

==Advocacy==
The NRMA advocates for improving road safety, reducing the cost of motoring and ensuring a better road and public transport network for all. In 1982, the NRMA worked with the Government of New South Wales to improve road safety by introducing random breath testing, and in 2012 NRMA was responsible for ensuring that all revenue raised by speed and red-light cameras is reinvested back into the road network.

Thousands of members have taken part in the NRMA&#x27;s annual Seeing Red on Roads and Seeing Red on Rail surveys, marking the roads and train stations that frustrate them the most. In 2014, the NRMA launched its online advocacy platform, Speak Out, giving members the chance to get involved in its advocacy work by suggesting and voting on campaign ideas, signing petitions and asking questions of NRMA subject matter experts.

In recent years, NRMA&#x27;s advocacy has led to significant reforms, including:
* Fuel price transparency legislation in NSW, forcing petrol stations to provide real time fuel information to motorists;
* Improved speed awareness signage and high visibility markings at mobile speed camera locations;
* Mandatory alcohol interlock devices for repeat drink drive offenders to reduce the number of drink drive offences committed;
* Increased fines and the loss of a demerit point for those who illegally park in disabled parking spaces;
* The recall of dangerous and hard-to-read &#x27;bright lights&#x27; coloured number plates from NSW roads; and
* Record infrastructure investment in major road projects, including the full duplication of the Pacific Highway, improving road safety and reducing congestion.

==Publication==
NRMA launched &quot;The Open Road&quot; to inform its members about its activities, including campaigning governments for improved roads, road safety and information about motoring. It was launched in 1921 under the name &quot;Good Roads&quot; and was renamed &quot;The Open Road&quot; in 1927.

<text>The Imperial Service Club was a club for Australian military officers returning from war service.

The club was incorporated into the Royal Automobile Club of Australia (RACA) in 1986, bringing with it a history stretching back to World War I.

==History==
The ISC&#x27;s first premises were in Penzance Chambers at 29 Elizabeth Street, Sydney. These were secured and furnished at the end of 1917 by a committee of returned officers who &quot;felt the need and realised the national value of such an institution&quot;. The first ideas for this institution may have emerged from the Oxford Hotel at the corner of King and Phillip Streets, a regular meeting house for the Royal New South Wales Lancers.

An early Club document proclaimed, &quot;It is scarcely possible to emphasise too strongly the necessity for such a Club as this, which will be a rallying point for the Officers who have served and will bind them into one strong united body, which they certainly were on service&quot;.
The objects of the Club were stated as:
# Social;
# Preserve the Friendships formed on Service;
# Maintain the Patriotic Spirit which made the AIF.

According to a fund-raising document issued in 1919, the qualifications for ISC membership were “Commissioned rank in HM Naval or Military Forces, and Active Service in a War of the Empire”. It was also intended to later admit those officers who were not of military age during the First World War, “including graduates of Duntroon Military and Jervis Bay Naval Colleges”.

The second floor of the Elizabeth Street building was fitted out to include a Smoking and Reading Room, a Billiards Room with one table, Dining and Card Rooms, and a Lounge. A dormitory and servants’ quarters were provided on the fifth floor.

===Phillip Street===
Soon after the Club was opened it became apparent that the Elizabeth Street premises were too small, and it was decided at a general meeting held at the end of 1918 to purchase a site and build new premises. By 1 September 1919, the Club had 900 members, and distinguished visitors to the Club had included the Governor-General Sir Ronald Ferguson, the State Governor Sir Walter Davidson, and the Admiral of the Fleet Viscount Jellicoe.

The Committee purchased three buildings covering a 62 ft frontage at 140, 142 and 144 Phillip Street, and produced plans to remodel the front portion, obtaining a total of four floors and a basement for a total cost estimated, including purchase, at £36,000. Of this, it was necessary to raise £11,600 by direct appeal to the members. The Club President, Commander RS Lambton, sent out a letter describing the situation as &quot;almost a matter of &#x27;life or death&#x27; – &#x27;club or no club&#x27;&quot;.

===Barrack Street===
The results of the appeal for funds are unrecorded, other than a list of donations including £2000 from the State government and £400 from the Australian Jockey Club. It is uncertain whether the Phillip Street premises were ever occupied. (If they were, it is an interesting coincidence that the ISC would have been a near neighbour of RACA, which occupied 132–134 Phillip Street at this time.) Certainly by the 1930s the Imperial Service Club was operating from what were to be long-held rooms in Barrack Street. One of Sydney&#x27;s shortest streets, Barrack Street once formed the side gate of the George Street military barracks.

The Club was situated on several floors above Sydney&#x27;s first Savings Bank, the Savings Bank of New South Wales, later the Government Savings Bank. Barrack Street itself survived potential demolition under Dr. Bradfield&#x27;s plans to extend a 100 ft-wide Martin Place to York Street as part of Sydney&#x27;s redesign in preparation for the new Harbour Bridge.

The Harbour Bridge provides another ISC connection; the de Groot incident is alleged to have been planned in the ISC&#x27;s Barrack Street rooms, according to Sydney historian Shirley Fitzgerald. On 19 March 1932, Francis Edward de Groot, described by the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald as &quot;an officer of the New Guard&quot;, rode past Premier Jack Lang and cut the ribbon on the Bridge, shouting &quot;I declare this bridge open on behalf of the respectable citizens of New South Wales&quot;. He was arrested and charged with &quot;being deemed to be insane&quot; and released the next day. With Lang&#x27;s nationalism anathema to the officer and commercial classes, current ISC members agree it likely that such an &quot;officers&#x27; coup&quot; could have originated in the city&#x27;s primary meeting place for commissioned servicemen.

The Club became the venue of choice for Battalion reunions and annual dinners. Links were maintained with forces in action during the Second World War. In 1942, when the crucial role of the 2/17th Battalion in the Battle of El Alamein was learned, ISC members from the 1/17th sent a message of congratulations to their successors. This message was said to have &quot;tickled them most of all&quot;.

===York Street===
The Imperial Service Club&#x27;s next premises were in York Street. Facilities included a small gymnasium, a steam and sauna room, billiards tables, and public and private dining rooms. Characters still fondly remembered by members today included Betty the cashier, who &quot;knew everyone and everything&quot;, and Rupert the waiter, who was kept on even when he &quot;got the shakes&quot; in later life. Celebrated regulars included Brigadier Sir F &#x27;Black Jack&#x27; Galleghan, who had commanded AIF troops in Changi and later became deputy head of the Commonwealth Investigation Service (which evolved from the wartime Military Intelligence Bureau). He could be seen most lunchtimes in the &quot;always full&quot; dining room, enjoying his sandwich and cup of tea. Newly commissioned young officers would usually be invited to York Street by other officers for a celebratory drink.

The York Street premises proved the Club&#x27;s downfall. A fixed rent had been negotiated, but a vital clause in the contract was overlooked, allowing the raising of rent to market rates after a fixed period. This came into effect in 1984/5, almost doubling the Club&#x27;s rent. 
In April 1985 the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; reported a proposal by the ISC to the Union Club in Bent Street regarding a merger. The article detailed the Club&#x27;s declining membership accompanied by escalating average fees, from a high of 4145 members and average fees of $31 in 1974, to 1574 members and fees of $260 in 1985. &quot;Each day brings us nearer to the inevitable liquidation&quot;, said ISC President Colonel Browne.
The Club&#x27;s problems were attributed to &quot;declining membership, coupled with the effect of inflation, random breath testing and changing community attitudes towards clubs&quot;. It also noted the Club&#x27;s reduction to only &quot;dining facilities and a small bank of poker machines&quot;.

==Joining RACA==
The Union Club merger was rejected the following week. RACA&#x27;s then President, Basil Clifton, later recalled that the Union club had a problem because &quot;at that time some nurses were members of the Imperial Club but the Union Club did not accept lady members. So the Imperial Club approached me and, after due discussion with the RACA Council, we decided that we would go ahead with a merger.”

The Imperial Service Club was incorporated within RACA in 1986. At RACA&#x27;s annual general meeting of February 1987, a special resolution was passed that the name of the club be changed to Royal Automobile Club of Australia incorporating Imperial Service Club. The ISC was allowed to devolve its assets into RACA as a subsidiary company, ISC Holdings Pty Ltd. The voluntary liquidation of this company was begun in 1991, the first distribution of $1,700,000 being noted in the RACA President&#x27;s Report of that year.

RACA&#x27;s 100th year saw the opening of the newly refurbished ISC Lounge on the third floor of the Macquarie Street Clubhouse. From there the Imperial Service Club continues its activities.

<text>The European mantis (Mantis religiosa) is a large hemimetabolic insect in the family of the Mantidae (&#x27;mantids&#x27;), which is the largest family of the order Mantodea (mantises). Their common name praying mantis is derived from the distinctive posture of the first pair of legs that can be observed in animals in repose. It resembles a praying attitude. Both males and females have elongated bodies with two pairs of wings. The most striking features that all Mantodea share are a very mobile, triangular head with large compound eyes and their first pair of legs (the &#x27;raptorial legs&#x27;), which is highly modified for the efficient capture and restraint of fast-moving or flying prey.

In Germany, &quot;M. religiosa&quot; is listed as &quot;Gefährdet&quot; [endangered] on the German Red List on the basis of an assessment from 1998. It is not supposed to be caught or held as a pet. At a global level, it is assessed by the IUCN as least concern.

==Anatomy==
Though females of &quot;M. religiosa&quot; are usually larger and heavier than males (7–9 cm versus 6–7 cm), the antennae and the eyes of male animals outsize those of the females. Along with the forward-directed, compound eyes, simple eyes also are found on the head. These three dorsal ocelli are also more pronounced in males than in females.

Males are often found to be more active and agile, whereas females are physically more powerful. Adult females are generally too large and heavy for their wings to enable a take-off.

Mantids show strong deimatic display from very early life stages on. This behavior can be observed throughout different groups of animals and is used to scare or startle potential predators to give the attacked animals a chance to escape. The deimatic display in &quot;M. religiosa&quot; involves wing spreading and bending of the raptorial legs to reveal two matched black eyespots with a yellow or white center at the base of the coxae (legs). It makes the animal appear much larger and more of a threat to the attacker. The black eyespots are also a distinct feature for species discrimination of the European mantis. 
Another unique feature of &quot;M. religiosa&quot; is its midline metathoracic ear (see Ultrasound avoidance). This “tympanal auditory organ” is an unpaired structure found on the ventral side of the animal on the metathorax between the third pair of legs. Unlike other sound-processing organs found among different groups of insects, the metathoracic ear has a high sensitivity across high and low frequencies and even ultrasound. Therefore, the authors call it a ‘true ear’.

==Coloration==
The great variation in the coloration of &quot;M. religiosa&quot; from different shades of yellow, brown, green, and sometimes black has been the cause of numerous hypotheses and studies for over 100 years. However, no generally accepted answer about reason, benefit, or mechanism of the coloration or the change of coloration has been found.

Di Cesnola observed in 1904 that green mantids were found on fresh green grass, whereas brown individuals seemed to prefer brown grass burned by the sun. When forced to change the location as to no longer match their coloration, almost all the ‘not matching’ animals were killed by predators such as birds. This indicates a camouflaging purpose of the coloration.

Przibram also observed in 1907 that a change in temperature can trigger a change in coloration: animals that hatched in a cold environment turned green after moulting when heat and sunlight were provided. Without the change in temperature and only a change in the color of the background, no change in coloration occurred. This finding contradicts with Di Cesnola, who claims to have observed the animals within the same time and location (and therefore the same temperature).

==Distribution==
&quot;M. religiosa&quot; can be found throughout Europe, Asia, and Africa, as well as North America, where it is considered introduced. Two confirmed stable populations are in Germany: one in Rhineland-Palatinate and one in Baden-Württemberg. In the last years, more reports have been made of the distribution of the animals in Northern Europe (Latvia, Estonia), as well.

While it is absent from the British Isles, &quot;M. religiosa&quot; has been recorded breeding on the Channel Islands - with a particularly abundant population on the island of Jersey - suggesting that its range may be capable of expanding north to Great Britain.

Despite being an introduced species, it is the official state insect of Connecticut.

==Reproduction==
The sexual behavior of praying mantids in general is curious, so has received interest from scientists over the last century. The differences between the various species are well known.

In &quot;M. religiosa&quot;, courtship and mating are separated into two steps: Preliminary courtship begins with the first visual contact between the animals and ends with the first physical contact. Copulation begins with physical contact and ends when the spermatophore is deposited:

Only a few days after the final moult into adults, the animals begin to show interest in the opposite sex; this point is marked as the achievement of sexual maturity. Males have been observed to be most attracted to females during the middle of the day when the temperature is hottest. Theories are that the female pheromones are most volatile in the heat and that also the male, as a thermophilic insect, is most active.

Instead of just observing them, sexually mature males approach sexually mature females when they see them, but due to the physical superiority of the females, males of &quot;M. religiosa&quot; face certain challenges in doing so. When a female spots a male, she is very likely to attack and kill him (see also: Sexual cannibalism). Therefore, males can be observed to be very slow and cautious in their approach; after spotting a female, the male usually freezes and turns his head to look directly at her. Since the foveae in his eyes face directly forwards, he has the most accurate and detailed view of her and can watch every one of her moves. He then proceeds to approach her from behind. Males can be observed to stop as soon as the female turns her head or even moves. Mantids are very good at detecting moving structures, but are almost unable to see immobile objects. Using this ‘stop-and-go’ tactic, the male stalks closer to the female. This can often take several hours. Depending on the environment, males sometimes show a light ‘rocking’-behavior which is believed to imitate the leaves of surrounding plants to blend in with the background. Males doing this had no higher probability of being detected and attacked, which supports this hypothesis of concealment.

No mention of male or female courtship has been made in either the field or captivity. The male, in fact, does not win by display; he wins by the absence of display.
Once the male is close enough to the female, he opens his wings a little to facilitate his jump on the female&#x27;s back. As soon as he lands, he proceeds to hold on to her with his raptorial legs. His tibiae fit into a pair of grooves on either side of the female&#x27;s mesothorax in front of her wing bases.
When the male is in a secure position, copulation is initiated. The genitals, which are found on the end of the abdomen in both sexes, look quite different; the males possess a pair of asymmetrical claspers, while the females have an ovipositor. The ovipositor is rather short in comparison to other insects. It is covered in part by the edges of the last sternum. 
The abdomen of the male curves and twists in a 90° angle around the female&#x27;s to insert the claspers between the ovipositor and the sternum. The abdomen of the male then contracts in a peristaltic manner. The animals can stay in this position for four to five hours before a spermatophore is deposited inside the female and the claspers are withdrawn.
The male then lets go of the female to drop to the ground to get out of her reach for his own safety. After getting away about 50 cm, he stops and freezes for about four minutes before he leaves eventually. This behavior could be interpreted as necessary rest after the efforts of copulating in a safe distance from the female.

==Larval development==
The intervals of oviposition after copulating depend on the food intake and the overall physical fitness of the female. On average, 11 days are needed for the female to form and deposit an ootheca, which contains around 100 to 200 eggs. Copulation usually takes place in September or October, but the eggs overwinter and the larva do not hatch until the following spring. Hatching is strongly influenced by environmental conditions such as temperature (at least 17 °C) and humidity. Females prefer to deposit their eggs on solid substrates at warm and sunny sites. Most eggs from one ootheca hatch at the same time along the entire convex site, as worm-like prelarvae (L1). The hatchings always occur in the morning.

The L1 just exists for a very short time; the first moult happens on or very close to the ootheca. The now-emerging nymphs already look a lot like the adults, but are maybe a tenth of their size. Very few animals (about 10%) survive this first instar stage due to lack of appropriately sized food, low temperatures, or insufficient humidity.

The L2–L6 stages generally last about 14 days each. During this time, a growth around 6 mm per stadium can be observed. Each stadium is completed with a moult. The L7 develops a more compact shape. Wing pads become visible. L7 and L8 show the same growth rate and duration as the previous stadia. After the next moult, the adult animal emerges. It now has wings and is fully developed. While more than eight moults have never been observed in &quot;M. religiosa&quot;, females usually need one more moult than males under similar circumstances.

Closely related mantids have been reported to be larger than &quot;M. religiosa&quot; and require more moults (9–11). The fact that females need a longer time to develop and more moults might be due to the difference in size.

==Sexual cannibalism==

The phenomenon that conspecifics are attacked and eaten after, during, and even before copulation is called sexual cannibalism. Many examples are known in various groups of invertebrates, including the mantids. Some speculations exist about the benefits of this behaviour, but its causes are not fully understood yet.
For quite some time, the belief that sexual cannibalism in &quot;M. religiosa&quot; only occurred in captivity was widespread. It was believed to be an artefact of improper animal keeping (too little food or space). In 1992, however, the cannibalising behaviour of female &quot;M. religiosa&quot; was observed in a field study. Lawrence compared the percentage of cannibalism in natural and manipulated (males and females were put close together in the field) pairings and found rates of 31% and 24%. 
This proves that sexual cannibalism in this praying mantid is not caused by laboratory conditions. They can, however, intensify the phenomenon; females that were starved for more than three days were more likely to attack males, even before copulation. While the cannibalisation before the copulation is still puzzling to scientists, some theories about the benefits of sexual cannibalism in general include:
*Eating her mate provides the female with nutrients so she does not have to hunt. She has a prey item available that is bigger than the prey she would be able to catch in the manner she usually hunts. 
*The meal also usually takes place during or shortly after she was fertilised, giving her more resources for the faster production of a large ootheca with large eggs, thus increasing the chance of her offspring to survive. Males have also been known to be more attracted to heavier, well-nourished females for this reason.

At first glance, however, this behaviour does not seem to be very beneficial for the male, since he dies and cannot create more offspring with his genetic material, yet males usually do not mate more than once, anyway. They have a shorter life expectancy than females (7–8 months versus 11–12 months) and since food can begin to become scarce in September and October, the male might starve before he has the chance to mate again. Copulation is also known to take longer when cannibalisation occurs. It seems advantageous to transfer more sperm in this elongated time and additionally provide the female with nutrients. Doing this, the male might just pass on his genes once, but he can ‘make sure’ that his offspring are successful, since they come from a well-nourished female.

Some controversy exists, though, concerning this theory. The absence of elaborate display behaviour does not support this ‘selfless’ behaviour of the males. It could have also been observed that males are more likely to approach a female that is distracted by feeding or cleaning herself. The approach is also happening faster in these cases. The male seems to try to avoid his cannibalisation very actively.

The fact that sexual cannibalisation happens so often is surely also supported because a male without a head can continue and even initiate copulation. The cerebral ganglion might have an inhibitory effect on copulatory reflexes. Once it is removed by removing the head, copulation might even be longer, since the male can never ‘decide’ to let go. A few mantids can also start copulating when the heads of both animals get removed artificially beforehand. The beheaded animals can live up to five hours and usually just die when they bleed out or starve to death.

==Hunting==

&quot;M. religiosa&quot; is a carnivorous ambush predator that actively scans its environment and feeds on most insects that are not too large to be captured by rapid extension of its raptorial legs. Only living and moving prey is captured and consumed immediately using their powerful mandibles. Grasshoppers seem to be rather popular, probably because of their type of movement (flying or leaping), but crickets and cockroaches are also frequently preyed upon. The attack or consumption of Mollusca, Aranea, Myriapoda, or Oligochaeta is also not unknown. Caught prey gets trapped between the spikes on the femora and tibiae and is now immobilized. The mantis then starts eating the still-living and preferably moving prey. Some years ago, the general opinion was that they killed their prey with a bite in the neck before consuming it, but current observations do not support this; the animals just start eating the body parts closest to their mouths.

&quot;M. religiosa&quot; is also known to eat conspecifics outside a sexual context. Because of this, they usually need to be kept isolated from each other in captivity.

==Visual system==
The large compound eyes that account for a great portion of the head make clear that vision seems to be important for &quot;M. religiosa&quot;. Their hunting behaviour and their sexual interactions rely almost exclusively on sight and the detection of movement. The capture of fast-flying prey out of the air would not be possible without a high level of temporal resolution. The localisation of the direction and distance of the prey are crucial here.

The eyes of &quot;M. religiosa&quot; are apposition eyes with eight types of photoreceptor cells, so are best adapted for daylight vision. One compound eye of an adult mantid consists of 8,000 to 10,000 optically isolated ommatidia with an interommatidial angle of 2° in the periphery and 0.7° in the fovea. Interommatidial angles in insects vary from tens of degrees to 0.24° in dragonflies, which puts the mantids on the upper end of spatial resolution. The overlap of the visual field of the two eyes is 40° in nymphs and up to 70° in adults.

The pseudopupil, a small, dark region in the eye, is rather conspicuous. It moves when the animal&#x27;s head is moving and represents the area of parallel ommatidia, which absorb the incident light, so appear darker than the rest of the eye.

The peering behaviour observed in &quot;M. religiosa&quot; is believed to be essential for the measurement of distances and depth perception; a side-to-side pendulum-like movement of the head or the whole body in a horizontal plane is used to scan the environment. Motion parallax is a depth cue that describes the fact that the closer the object is, the faster it seems to move when turning one&#x27;s head while looking at it compared to slower-moving objects that are more distant. Animals that were blinded on one eye did not strike for prey, showing that binocular vision is essential, since the disparity between the information of each eye is used to estimate distances, as well.

The development of the visual system was reviewed by Karl Kral in 2014: while high-contrast cues could be perceived by adults and nymphs (two hours to three days) alike, the differentiation between lower-contrast cues was much less successful in the two-hour-old animals, but a great improvement occurred after only three days of life. The eyes of newly hatched animals are less than half the size of the eyes of adult animals and have fewer ommatidia. Also, the facets of the frontal ommatidia, which are usually used for the detection of partners and prey, are not enlarged yet. While they already have all the necessary structures, very young animals have a restricted visual field and lower resolution and sensitivity to light. The great improvement of vision after only three days happens due to the sclerotisation of the cuticle that includes the corneal lenses of the ommatidia. The improved lenses are not able to focus the light on the retina.

Like other mantid species, &quot;M. religiosa has&quot; stereopsis vision.

<text>The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association, the governing body for professional snooker, first published official world rankings for players on the main tour for the 1976–77 season. Before this, the defending champion was seeded first, and the previous year&#x27;s runner-up second, for each tournament.

For the 1976–77 snooker season, players&#x27; performances in the previous three World Snooker Championships (1974, 1975, and 1976) contributed to their ranking points total. For each of the three years, the World Champion was awarded five points, the runner-up received four, losing semi-finalists got three, players eliminated in the quarter-finals gained two, and losers in the last-16 round received a single point. If players were level on points, then those gained in the most recent event determined positioning. If this was still equal, then the losing margin on was taken into account.

Ray Reardon, having won the championship in each of the three years considered, was ranked first, with the maximum possible 15 points, followed by Alex Higgins, the 1976 runner-up, on nine points. The eight-highest ranked players were placed directly into the last-16 round of the 1977 World Snooker Championship, whilst all other entrants were placed in a qualifying competition to produce the eight players to play the exempted seeds.

The same points system, based on results from 1973, 1974 and 1975, had been used to calculate the eight top seeds for the 1976 World Championship. Reardon had topped that list with 15 points, followed by Eddie Charlton on nine, and Higgins with eight.

==Rankings==

The professional world rankings for the snooker players on the main tour in the 1976–77 season are listed below. Points gained in each of the three World Snooker Championships are shown, with the total number of points given in the last column. A &quot;–&quot; symbol indicates that the player did not participate in that year&#x27;s championship.

On the eve of the return of Rekha (Ramlal&#x27;s daughter) from London, Ramlal is killed in a car accident which is suspected to be murder. The suspicion is reinforced when Ramu is found hanging in his bedroom on the same night. Postmortem reports claim he was murdered before being hanged.

Shyamlal and Rekha move out of the bungalow to their home in the city and live there. However Rekha receives threatening phone calls about her death.

<text>Holger Börner (7 February 1931, in Kassel – 2 August 2006, in Kassel) was a German politician of the SPD.

He was the 4th Minister President of Hesse from 1976 until 1987. In this position, he served as the 38th President of the Bundesrat in 1986/87, but only served until the Landtag elections of 24 April 1987.

== Early life ==
Börner was born in Kassel, oldest of three children of Hermann (1906–1941) and Martha Börner (née Bengsohn) (1909–1997). His family had a social democratic history, reportedly his grandfather had moved from Berlin to Kassel due to Chancellor Otto von Bismarck&#x27;s Anti-Socialist Laws. His father was a construction worker and a foreman at the construction company Gerdum &amp; Breuer in Kassel and from 1931 to 1933, the chairman of the Wolfsanger SPD local association, before being sentenced to prison in a rigged trial and imprisoned in Emslandlager until 1935. He was later killed in Eastern Front near Smolensk on 14 October 1941 by Soviet partisans during bridge construction work. Börner&#x27;s mother later served on the Kassel city council from 1946 to 1956 and again from 1962 to 1964.

After attending elementary and middle school, Börner became a construction worker after the Second World War, specializing in concrete. He became involved in the union early on and was most recently chairman of the works council of a Kassel construction company, for which he also worked as an auxiliary foreman.

== Political career ==
Son of a city councilwoman, Börner joined SPD in 1948, and was elected chairman of Kassel area Socialist Youth of Germany – Falcons. In 1950, he joined the executive committee of the city&#x27;s party section.

In 1956, at the age of 25, Börner was elected to his hometown&#x27;s city council, and resigned from his post as president of the Falcons.

In the 1957 federal election, he was the SPD candidate for Bundestag constituency nr. 127 - Kassel, which consisted of his hometown and the surrounding district of the same name. Despite CDU/CSU winning an absolute majority in the election, Börner won the election with 49.2 percent of the constituency vote and 48.9 percent of the party list vote. At the age of 26, he was the youngest member of Bundestag. He was elected to the seat again in 1961, 1965, 1969, 1972 and 1976, each time winning at least 51 percent of the vote. From 1962 to 1963, he was the head of SPD&#x27;s youth wing JuSos.

His best result was in 1972, when he received 60.1 percent of constituency and 55.5 percent of party list vote. While in Bundestag, he was appointed as Parliamentary State Secretary to the Federal Minister of Transport Georg Leber in Kiesinger cabinet on 12 April 1967, he retained the post in the first Brandt cabinet until resigning on 4 February 1972, after being chosen by chancellor Willy Brandt to replace Hans-Jürgen Wischnewski as the party&#x27;s federal executive director.

On 3 October 1976, Börner was re-elected to his Bundestag seat with 53.7 percent of constituency and 52.9 percent of party list vote. However, two weeks later, Minister President of Hesse Albert Osswald resigned on 16 October following a financial scandal involving public bank Helaba, and 45-year old Börner was chosen by SPD to succeed him as Minister President, so he resigned his Bundestag mandate and took over the state level social-liberal coalition, which was also in power at the federal level. In 1978, with the SPD and FDP winning a total of 57 out of 110 seats in Hesse Landtag, the coalition was returned, Börner was elected to the Landtag constituency nr. 5, which consisted of parts of Kassel. On 11 May 1981, his Deputy Minister President, Heinz-Herbert Karry (FDP) was assassinated by far-left Revolutionary Cells terror organization.

As Minister President, Börner was critical of the city of Lahn in central Hesse, calling it &quot;rubble&quot; (&quot;Scheißdreck&quot;). Lahn had been created under a 1976/77 state administrative reform by the merger of the cities of Giessen and Wetzlar, which his predecessor Osswald had been a supporter of. However, the city was unpopular with the public, and had led to CDU winning a majority at the local elections. Despite the city of Lahn being supported by his party, Börner adopted CDU&#x27;s position in opposition to the city, &quot;Wetzlar should become Wetzlar, and Giessen Giessen again.&quot; (&quot;Wetzlar soll wieder Wetzlar, Gießen wieder Gießen werden&quot;) and had the merger overturned by 1979. In addition, under him the new Giessen region was created in central Hesse in 1981, carved out of the Darmstadt region.

In 1982, at federal level, the coalition between SPD and FDP at federal level collapsed. In the upcoming Hesse state elections on 26 September 1982, Börner campaigned against FDP&#x27;s &quot;betrayal in Bonn&quot; and succeeded in FDP losing its representation in the Landtag entirely, falling under the 5-percent hurdle, while the Green Party entered the government, winning 9 seats. However, his SPD party won only 49 seats, 6 short of the 55-seat majority. Since the Green Party rejected a formal coalition, the only majority government possible was a CDU-SPD Grand coalition. However, since CDU had won 52 seats (3 more), Börner rejected it as it would have meant leaving the Minister President position to CDU, so his now all-SPD cabinet remained in office as a caretaker cabinet, being tolerated by the Greens until new elections were held on 25 September 1983. During the elections, he had rejected the idea of working with the Greens.

However, the election of 1983 resolved to only confirm the stalemate, with his SPD coming first at 51 seats, but still being 4 seats short of a majority, and FDP re-entering the Landtag. CDU and FDP wanted to form a black-yellow coalition implemented at federal level, but they only had 52 seats between them. So in 1984, Börner was re-elected to the Minister President as part of a minority government tolerated by the Greens. Finally, in October 1985, he managed to implement the first coalition between the SPD and the Greens in Germany, despite having promised earlier never to work with the Green Party. In this administration, Joschka Fischer was the first green party minister in Germany (minister of Environment and Energy). However, both the toleration phase and coalition period were determined by the Greens&#x27; internal conflicts between the &quot;Fundis&quot; (fundamentalists) and &quot;Realos&quot; (realists), and various conflicts between SPD and Greens. The coalition would ultimately prove to be short-lived, when in February 1987, it broke down due to disputes over operating license of Alkem fuel element factory in Hanau, so Börner dismissed Fischer from his post, and a new election was held on 5 April 1987, where Börner did not run again and was replaced by his Deputy Minister President Hans Krollmann as SPD candidate.

Börner supported nuclear energy, namely the building of Biblis Nuclear Power Plant in Southern Hesse. He was also critical of influx of &quot;Gastarbeiter&quot; from Turkey, saying it had to be stopped as they were not well-integrating.

During the Runway 18 West protests at Frankfurt Airport in 1980s, Börner said that during his construction worker days, the troublemakers would have been hit with roof battens. (&quot;Wissen Sie, heute muss ich an öffentlichen Frieden denken. Vor 40 Jahren auf dem Bau hätte ich einen Angriff auf meine Person mit der Dachlatte beantwortet.&quot;)

Afterwards, until 2003, he was chairman of the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung.

Börner died of cancer at the age of 75 on 2 August 2006 and was survived by his wife Carola (married since 27 December 1950) and three children, sons Olaf and Fritjof and daughter Heike. He professed to have always carried a gun and took regular target practice.

<text>The tritos is an eclipse cycle of 3,986.628 days (about 10 years, 11 months).
It corresponds to:
*135 synodic months 
*146.50144 draconic months
*11.50144 eclipse years (23 eclipse seasons)
*144.68135 anomalistic months.

The length of the tritos is equal to the length of the inex minus the length of the saros eclipse cycles. Therefore, eclipses that occur 1 tritos apart (i.e. both eclipses belong to the same tritos series), belong to two different saros series with series numbers that differ by one.

The pre-Columbian Maya used a calculation in their own observations of eclipse cycles in which a period of three tritoses (or tritoi) was approximated by 11960 days, based on 46 periods of their tzolk&#x27;in calendar (i.e. 46 × 260 days). The number of &quot;anomalistic months&quot; in a tritos (144.68), having a fraction near , means every third eclipse is in nearly the same position in the elliptical orbit, so eclipses will have similar timing and total versus annular quality.

Solar and lunar eclipse event dates will repeat on this cycle for about 700 years.

<text>Duke of Masovia () was a title borne by the sons and descendants of the Polish Duke Bolesław III Wrymouth. In accordance with the last will and testament of Bolesław, upon his death his lands were divided into four to five hereditary provinces distributed among his sons, and a royal province of Kraków reserved for the eldest, who was to be High Duke of all Poland. This was known as the fragmentation of Poland. Subsequent developments lead to further splintering of the duchies.

The following is a list of all rulers of the Duchy of Masovia and its parts. Although not all incumbents listed here had titular rights to the title of Duke of Masovia, they are all listed as such for simplicity&#x27;s sake.

Also take note that some of the dates are merely approximate and the ownership of certain lands might be disputed. Finally, this table does not include lands ruled by dukes of other parts of partitioned Poland or Wenceslaus II and Wenceslaus III.

<doc id="662762" wikidata="Q11827352" url="?curid=662762" title="Homarus">
<text>Homarus is a genus of lobsters, which include the common and commercially significant species &quot;Homarus americanus&quot; (the American lobster) and &quot;Homarus gammarus&quot; (the European lobster). The Cape lobster, which was formerly in this genus as &quot;H. capensis&quot;, was moved in 1995 to the new genus &quot;Homarinus&quot;.

==Description==
&quot;Homarus&quot; is one of three extant genera of clawed lobsters to show dimorphism between claws – a specialisation into a crushing claw and a cutting claw. The other similar genera are &quot;Nephrops&quot;, which is much more slender, and has grooves along the claws and the abdomen, and &quot;Homarinus&quot;, the Cape lobster from South Africa, which is even smaller, and has hairy claws.

While analyses of morphology suggest a close relationship between &quot;Homarinus&quot; and &quot;Homarus&quot;, molecular analyses using mitochondrial DNA reveal that they are not sister taxa. Both genera lack ornamentation such as spines and carinae, but are thought to have reached that state independently, through convergent evolution. The closest living relative of &quot;Homarus&quot; is &quot;Nephrops norvegicus&quot;, while the closest relatives of &quot;Homarinus&quot; are &quot;Thymops&quot; and &quot;Thymopides&quot;.

==Species==
Eight extinct species are known from the fossil record, which stretches back to the Cretaceous, but only two species survive. These two species, the American lobster and the European lobster, are very similar and may have speciated as recently as the Pleistocene, during climatic fluctuations. The best characters for distinguishing them are the geographic distribution, with the American lobster in the western Atlantic and the European lobster in the eastern Atlantic, and by the presence of one or more teeth on the underside of the rostrum in &quot;H. americanus&quot; but not in &quot;H. gammarus&quot;.


===Fossil species===

The boundaries between &quot;Homarus&quot; and the extinct genus &quot;Hoploparia&quot; are unclear, and some species, such as &quot;Hoploparia benedeni&quot; have been transferred between the two genera. Eight species have been assigned to &quot;Homarus&quot; from the fossil record. They are:
*&quot;Homarus brittonestris&quot; – lower Turonian
*&quot;Homarus davisi&quot; – lower Turonian
*&quot;Homarus fami&quot; – Albian
*&quot;Homarus lehmanni&quot; – Rupelian
*&quot;Homarus mickelsoni&quot; – lower Campanian
*&quot;Homarus morrisi&quot; – Eocene
*&quot;Homarus neptunianus&quot; – Oligocene
*&quot;Homarus travisensis&quot; – middle Albian

==Distribution==
The two extant species of &quot;Homarus&quot; are both found in the North Atlantic Ocean. &quot;H. americanus&quot; is found from Labrador to North Carolina in the western North Atlantic, while &quot;H. gammarus&quot; is found from Arctic Norway to Morocco, including the British Isles and the Mediterranean Sea.

==Life cycle==

Mating in &quot;Homarus&quot; is complex and is accompanied by a number of courtship behaviours. Males build mating shelters or burrows, and larger males can attract more females, producing a polygynous mating system. A few days before moulting, a female will choose a mate, and will remain in his shelter until the moult. The male will then insert a spermatophore into the female&#x27;s seminal vesicle, where it may be stored for several years. The eggs of &quot;Homarus&quot; species are laid in the autumn, being fertilised externally as they exit, and are carried by the female on her pleopods.

The eggs generally hatch in the spring as a pre-larva, which rapidly develops into the first larval phase. This is followed by three zoeal phases, the total duration of which can vary from two weeks to two months, depending on the temperature. At the following moult, the young animal becomes a post-larva, with a gross form resembling the adult lobster. Although it can swim, using its pleopods, the post-larva soon settles to the bottom and lives as a juvenile for 3–5 years.

As adults, &quot;Homarus&quot; species moult increasingly infrequently. The size at sexual maturity varies with temperature; it is around for female &quot;H. americanus&quot; in southern New England, but around the Bay of Fundy. In &quot;H. gammarus&quot;, the size at sexual maturity is less well defined, but is in the range .

<text>Jingjiang Princes&#x27; Palace () is a historical site in Guilin, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China. It now functions as both Guangxi Normal University and as a tourist attraction.

==History==
The Jingjiang Princes&#x27; Palace (also known as the Jingjiang Princes&#x27; City), commonly known as Wangcheng (Princes&#x27; City), is located in the inner city of Guilin and was built between 1372 and 1392 AD during the Ming dynasty close to the Solitary Beauty Peak (Duxiu Feng). It was originally the official residence of Zhu Shouqian – the great-nephew of Zhu Yuanzhang, the first Ming dynasty emperor). After Zhu Shouqian was declared Prince of Jingjiang by Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang, his palace was set at Jingjiang. It took more than 20 years to build the capital, which now has a history of over 630 years and is older than the Forbidden City in Beijing.

During the 257 years from the building of the mansion to the end of Ming dynasty, 14 kings from 12 generations lived here.

Sun Yat-sen stayed there while on the Northern Expedition in 1921. In the winter of 1925, it was established as Yat-sen Park and now is one of the schoolyards of Guangxi Normal University. The carved balustrades and marble steps of the mansion still remain to today.

Over its history of more than 600 years the city was burned down several times, however it remains as the best-preserved Princes&#x27; City in China. Notably, the carved balustrades and marble steps still remain. The Chinese Government gave the site national protection status in 1993.

Today the site is occupied by Guangxi Normal University, but remains open to the public as a tourist attraction combining aspects of Guilin&#x27;s natural environment, history, traditional architecture and local culture.

==Size and layout==
The Jingjiang Princes&#x27; City is magnificent and grandly walled, and once functioned as an &#x27;inner city&#x27; occupied by the princes and their families. There are 4 halls, 4 pavilions and 40 other buildings surrounding the main buildings. It occupies a total area of 19.78 hectares (0.08 square miles). The layout of the mansion is, from the south to the north, Imperial Burial Place, Chengyun Palace and Chengyun Gate; from east to west, Imperial Divine Temple and Ancestral Temple. Other buildings are built around the main buildings. All the buildings in Jingjiang Princes&#x27;City are decorated with red walls and yellow tiles, which a typical color scheme for Chinese palaces.

There is a long city wall which is built with square bluestones. It is long from south to north and long from east to west. The city wall is high and has a thickness of . There are four gates in four directions, which are called &quot;Tiren&quot; (Donghua Gate), &quot;Duanli&quot; (Zhengyang Gate), &quot;Zunyi&quot; (Xihua Gate) and &quot;Guangzhi&quot; (Hougong Gate).

The layout of the city strictly conforms to the rules of the Ming dynasty. All buildings are arranged on the axis anchored by the Solitary Beauty Peak in the order of, from the south, Duanli Gate (Entrance Gate), Chengyun Gate (Palace Gate), Chengyun Palace (Administration Building), Royal Quarters, Imperial Garden and Guangzhi Gate (Rear Gate). The subsidiary buildings on both sides of the axis are symmetrical.

The local government has worked to combine aspects of Guilin&#x27;s natural environment, history, traditional architecture and local culture. Now it is a tourist destination.

==Attractions within the Princes&#x27; City==

===Solitary Beauty Peak===

Jingjiang Princes&#x27; City is located beside the Li River. It is a tourist attraction highlighted by the Solitary Beauty Peak and covers the whole Jingjiang Princes&#x27; City. Perfectly combining the natural landscape and historical sites, it is praised as a &quot;city in a city&quot; since the ancient time.

The Jingjiang Princes&#x27; City scenic area is a highest-grade tourist resource in the Guilin. It is mainly composed of Chengyun (Be Ordained by Heaven) Gate, Chengyun Hall, Bedchamber, Ancestral Temple, The Altar of the Earth and Harvests, pavilions, terraces and towers. The whole city is a building complex decorated with red walls and yellow tiles. Around the Prince City, there is a city wall piled up by strong square green stones. Four city gates are opened in the eastern, western, northern and southern sides, named Tiren (Donghua Gate), Duanli (Zhengyang Gate), Zunyi (Xihua Gate) and Guangzhi (Hougong Gate) respectively. The straight Solitary Beauty Peak stands erect in the city. Yueya (Crescent) Pool is lying at the top of the peak. Move up, visitors can find Xuanwu Pavilion, Kwanyin Hall, Sanke Temple and Sanshen (Three Deities) Ancestral Temple elegantly dotted on the peak.

The Solitary Beauty Peak is often compared to be a king as it erects from the ground like a unique column propping up the blue sky. Its summit offers a panoramic view of Guilin. The well-known description that characterizes Guilin landscape &quot;the scenery in Guilin excels all under the heaven&quot; is among the numerous stone inscription on the cliffs of the Peak. Inside the Peace Cave at the foot of the Peak, there are 60 Chinese zodiacal signs carved on the wall that are considered to be one of the world culture wonder. In the Qing dynasty, JingJiang Princes&#x27; City was converted to be the Examination House. JingJiang Princes&#x27; City is listed as &quot;the key cultural relics of national level&quot; in 1996.

===&quot;Zhuangyuan Jidi&quot; Arch===
The &quot;Zhuangyuan Jidi&quot; Arch (&quot;Zhuangyuan&quot;; 状元/狀元) was the title conferred on the scholar who came first in the highest imperial examination) is located on the Donghua Gate. The arch was built during the reign of the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) Daoguang Emperor (r. 1820–1850) and ruined during the reign of the Guangxu Emperor (r. 1875–1908). It was built for Long Qirui (龙启瑞). Before Long Qirui was entitled to the title Zhuangyuan, there was someone who also enjoyed the title. In the next four years, there were two Zhuangyuans came from Guilin which shocked everyone in China. Since then, there was a popular saying that &quot;eight Jinshi (An advanced scholar) from one county and two Zhuangyuan from one city&quot;. In order to memorize this legend, local authorities rebuilt the &quot;Zhuangyuan Jidi&quot; Arch and carved all the four peoples’ names on the arch. The &quot;Bangyan Jidi&quot; Arch (Bangyan means the second place at palace examinations) is on the Xihua Gate. It was built in memory of Yu Jianzhang(于建章) in the fourth year of the Tongzhi Emperor (r. 1861–1875) during the Qing dynasty.

There had been 14 Jingjiang Princes of 12 generations who lived in the city during the 257 years before it was ruined during the Qing dynasty. The last owner Li Youde buried himself to death in the Qing dynasty. At present, the main buildings of the city are well preserved. The left Chengyun Gate, the platform of Chengyun Palace and other buildings are open for visitors.

===Study Cave===
The first poem in praise of Guilin scenery by Yan Yanzhi in the southern Song dynasty (420–479) was engraved here and from where the Peak obtained its name. The most famous line &quot;Guilin scenery excels all&quot; was cliff-engraved here more than 800 years ago.

===Stone inscription===
The stone inscriptions on the Solitary Beauty Peak add up to 136 pieces, which were attributed to the VIPs at that time. These inscriptions include calligraphy, painting and documentary records. These works reflect the history of Guilin and represent the essence of culture.

===Peace Grotto===
It is a natural grotto at the west foot of the Duxiu Peak and a place for the Jingjiang Princes to worship. The statue of emperor Xuan Wu and 60 God Jiazhi statues are enshrined and worshiped inside the grotto. Among them the carved reproduction of the 60 God Jiazhi statues in the grotto are probably the only ones within the country.

===Examination House===
A place blessed with good Feng shui (in Chinese astrology it means good location, good fortune) and numerous top scholars made its fame beat all in the Qing dynasty. The site has been restored as an imperial testing house where tourists can take part in the exam.

===Confucius Temple===
The ancient scholars must offer their sacrifices to Confucius before taking the provincial test in the examination house. They pray for passing the test. It is said that the Confucian Temple next to the Examination House is highly efficacious.

===Couple Tree===
With branches in the shape of a dragon and a horse, a locust tree and a banyan tree grow tightly together like one sweet couple.

===Chengyun Palace===
Originally built in 1372 in the Ming dynasty as the administration office of the city. The palace was burned down twice in the Qing dynasty and during the Japanese invasion. The only originals are the stairs and railings since the current structure was rebuilt in 1947.

===Fortune Well===
A well that the examinees in the Examination House in the Qing dynasty regarded as the source of fortune, and from which they would drink the blessed water before they took the exam.

<doc id="662776" wikidata="Q212798" url="?curid=662776" title="Turbellaria">
<text>The Turbellaria are one of the traditional sub-divisions of the phylum Platyhelminthes (flatworms), and include all the sub-groups that are not exclusively parasitic. There are about 4,500 species, which range from to large freshwater forms more than long or terrestrial species like &quot;Bipalium kewense&quot; which can reach in length. All the larger forms are flat with ribbon-like or leaf-like shapes, since their lack of respiratory and circulatory systems means that they have to rely on diffusion for internal transport of metabolites. However, many of the smaller forms are round in cross section. Most are predators, and all live in water or in moist terrestrial environments. Most forms reproduce sexually and with few exceptions all are simultaneous hermaphrodites.

The Acoelomorpha and the genus &quot;Xenoturbella&quot; were formerly included in the Turbellaria, but are no longer regarded as Platyhelminthes. All the exclusively parasitic Platyhelminthes form a monophyletic group Neodermata, and it is agreed that these are descended from one small sub-group within the free-living Platyhelminthes. Hence the &quot;Turbellaria&quot; as traditionally defined are paraphyletic.

==Description==
Traditional classifications divide the Platyhelminthes into four groups: Turbellaria and the wholly parasitic Trematoda, Monogenea and Cestoda. In this classification the Turbellaria include the Acoelomorpha (Acoela and Nemertodermatida). The name &quot;Turbellaria&quot; refers to the &quot;whirlpools&quot; of microscopic particles created close to the skins of aquatic species by the movement of their cilia.

===Features common to all Platyhelminthes===
As bilaterians, platyhelminthes are triploblastic, but have no internal body cavity (are acoelomate), and lack specialized circulatory and respiratory organs, so gas exchange is by simple diffusion. This limits the thickness of the body, so they are either microscopic or are flat and ribbon- or leaf-shaped, and vulnerable to fluid loss. The body is filled with mesenchyme, a connective tissue that can regenerate injured tissues and permits asexual reproduction. The nervous system is concentrated at the head end.

===Features specific to Turbellaria===

These have about 4,500 species, are mostly free-living, and range from to in length. Most are predators or scavengers, and terrestrial species are mostly nocturnal and live in shaded humid locations such as leaf litter or rotting wood. However some are symbiotes of other animals such as crustaceans, and some are parasites. Free-living turbellarians are mostly black, brown or gray, but some larger ones are brightly colored.

Turbellarians have no cuticle (external layer of organic but non-cellular material). In a few species the skin is a syncitium, a collection of cells with multiple nuclei and a single shared external membrane. However the skins of most species consist of a single layer of cells, each of which generally has multiple cilia (small mobile &quot;hairs&quot;), although in some large species the upper surface has no cilia. These skins are also covered with microvilli between the cilia. They have many glands, usually submerged in the muscle layers below the skin and connect to the surface by pores through which they secrete mucus, adhesives and other substances.

Small aquatic species use the cilia for locomotion, while larger ones use muscular movements of the whole body or of a specialized sole to creep or swim. Some are capable of burrowing, anchoring their rear ends at the bottom of the burrow, then stretching the head up to feed and then pulling it back down for safety. Some terrestrial species throw a thread of mucus which they use as a rope to climb from one leaf to another.

Some Turbelleria have spicular skeletons, giving the appearance of annulations.

===Diet and digestion===

Most other turbellarians are carnivorous, either preying on small invertebrates or protozoans, or scavenging on dead animals. A few feed on larger animals, including oysters and barnacles, while some, such as &quot;Bdelloura&quot;, are commensal on the gills of horseshoe crabs. These turbellarians usually have an eversible pharynx, in other words, one that can be extended by being turned inside-out, and the mouths of different species can be anywhere along the underside. The freshwater species &quot;Microstomum caudatum&quot; can open its mouth almost as wide as its body is long, to swallow prey as large as itself.

The intestine is lined by phagocytic cells which capture food particles that have already been partially digested by enzymes in the gut. Digestion is then completed within the phagocytic cells and the nutrients diffuse through the body.

===Nervous system===
Concentration of nervous tissue in the head region is least marked in the acoels, which have nerve nets rather like those of cnidarians and ctenophores, but densest around the head. In turbellarians, a distinct brain is present, albeit relatively simple in structure. From the brain one to four pairs of nerve cords run along the length the body, with numerous smaller nerves branching off. The ventral pair of nerve cords are typically the largest, and, in many species, are the only ones present. Unlike more complex animals, such as annelids, there are no ganglia on the nerve cords, other than those forming the brain.

Most turbellarians have pigment-cup ocelli (&quot;little eyes&quot;), one pair in most species, but two or even three pairs in some. A few large species have many eyes in clusters over the brain, mounted on tentacles, or spaced uniformly round the edge of the body. The ocelli can only distinguish the direction from which light is coming and enable the animals to avoid it.

A few groups – mainly catenulids and seriates – have statocysts, fluid-filled chambers containing a small solid particle or, in a few groups, two. These statocysts are thought to be balance and acceleration sensors, as that is the function they perform in cnidarian medusae and in ctenophores. However turbellarian statocysts have no sensory cilia, and it is unknown how they sense the movements and positions of the solid particles.

Most species have ciliated touch-sensor cells scattered over their bodies, especially on tentacles and around the edges. Specialized cells in pits or grooves on the head are probably smell-sensors.

===Reproduction===

Many turbellarians clone themselves by transverse or longitudinal division, and others, especially acoels, reproduce by budding. The planarian &quot;Dugesia&quot; is a well-known representative of class Turbellaria.

All turbellarians are simultaneous hermaphrodites, having both female and male reproductive cells, and fertilize eggs internally by copulation. Some of the larger aquatic species mate by penis fencing, a duel in which each tries to impregnate the other, and the loser adopts the female role of developing the eggs.

In turbellarians there are one or more pairs of both testes and ovaries. Sperm ducts run from the testes, through bulb-like seminal vesicles, to the muscular penis. In many species, this basic plan is considerably complicated by the addition of accessory glands or other structures. The penis lies inside a cavity, and can be everted through an opening on the posterior underside of the animal. It often, although not always, possesses a sharp stylet. Unusually among animals, in most species, the sperm cells have two tails, rather than one.

In most species &quot;miniature adults&quot; emerge when the eggs hatch, but a few large species produce plankton-like larvae.

==Taxonomy and evolution==


Internal relationships

Detailed morphological analyses of anatomical features in the mid-1980s and molecular phylogenetics analyses since 2000 using different sections of DNA agree that Acoelomorpha, consisting of Acoela (traditionally regarded as very simple turbellarians) and Nemertodermatida (another small group previously classified as &quot;turbellarians&quot;) are the sister group to all other bilaterians, including the rest of the Platyhelminthes.

The Platyhelminthes is a clade consisting of two monophyletic groups, Catenulida and Rhabditophora.

It has been agreed since 1985 that each of the wholly parasitic platyhelminth groups (Cestoda, Monogenea and Trematoda) is monophyletic, and that together these form a larger monophyletic grouping, the Neodermata, in which the adults of all members have syncitial skins. It is also generally agreed that the Neodermata are a relatively small sub-group a few levels down in the &quot;family tree&quot; of the Rhabditophora. Hence the traditional sub-phylum &quot;Turbellaria&quot; is paraphyletic, since it does not include the Neodermata although these are descendants of a sub-group of &quot;turbellarians&quot;.
