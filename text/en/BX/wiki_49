<text>Aiseau (; ) is a village of Wallonia and a district of the municipality of Aiseau-Presles, located in the province of Hainaut, Belgium. 

It was a separate municipality before the Merger of Commons in 1977.

It borders the Biesme, near its mouth on the Sambre. 

*Postal area: 6250 (old zone: 6268) 
*Province: Hainaut 
*District: Charleroi 
*Hamlets of Aiseau: Menonri (wa: &quot;In Mnonri&quot;); Oignies (wa: &quot;Ougniye&quot;), with its béguinage.

==Prehistory and history==

Traces of human presence date back to prehistoric times. In caves in Parc du Comte de Presles various bones were discovered of Neanderthal man dating back to the Paleolithic Era.

Later, during the Roman Empire, a Gallo-Roman villa was built at the southern end of the village (along Presles Road). A cistern was present. A cemetery was a few hundred meters further north, at the foot of Bois de Broue, along the rue d&#x27;Aiseau.

The village itself appeared in the tenth century, at a place called the &quot;Hayettes.&quot; A farm was present in 952.

A mansion was built in the center of village. It was enlarged over centuries to be remodeled for the last time in 1721. It was destroyed in 1794 by French revolutionaries. In 1860, the village school took its place. Only part remaining today is the front porch with the arms of the last family that ruled the village, the &quot;Gavre&quot; porch. This building was then used as stables of the castle and by house servants. A few outer walls of the castle can also be seen along the rue du Curé.

Not far away, the &quot;Baudecart Farm&quot; was built as the farm of the Lord of the village. This farm still exists, although changed.

==Culture and heritage==

===Oignies Priory===
Hugo d&#x27;Oignies, the great Mosan goldsmith, worked at Priory Oignies. His work was conserved, which is exceptional. It was hidden in Falisolle during the French Revolution in 1818 and entrusted to the Sisters of Notre Dame in Namur. Today we can admire the largest part of the treasure in the museum the Sisters of Notre-Dame in Namur, the rest is kept in the parishes of Aiseau, Falisolle, Septic, Nivelles and Walcourt as well as Royal Museums of art and History in Brussels and the diocesan Museum of Namur.

===Industrial development===

Historically, Aiseau was a village dedicated to agriculture, logging, but also to the industry.

As evidence of development, several centuries of iron ore have been discovered. This activity leads to the creation and perpetuation of Forges d&#x27;Aiseau, factories located south of the village, along the Biesme. These products were exported around the world, including Mexico. But their location, far from the Sambre and railways, made it impossible to work there. These factories closed in the early twentieth century. Nowadays, the Somville Workshops produce light metals.

Wagons came from Aiseau coal mines. For centuries, coal was mined from various locations on the hillside. Two wells exist, one in Oignies (St. Henry&#x27;s Well) and the other in Ménonry (the colliery Champfroment). A ventilation shaft was located not far from the place called &quot; l&#x27;Etoile&quot; (Star) 50 m behind Somville Workshops. Concrete wells are still visible today.

The production of glass was also occurred in Aiseau through &quot;Glaceries Sainte-Marie d&#x27;Oignies&quot;. This huge farm was located along the present street Oignies, the along the Sambre. Its fame was international, the windows of the Empire State Building in New York were especially produced there. King Leopold I visited the buildings. While the lower village was laid out accordingly, Abbey Oignies partly destroyed houses built for workers, and the Biesme diverted from its original course.

The factory closed in 1930 due to the global crisis. Today, there are only ruins, found in a park.

In addition to industries Aiseau also owned a chemical plant (opposite the Abbey), a cooperage (near the station), water mills, and others.

===World War I===

Aiseau, along with whole region, suffered much from the conflict which has always marked the region. The Battle of Charleroi, from 21 to 23 August 1914, was one of the most painful episodes.

On 21 August, the Germans descended on the Sambre, attacked Roselies at Northwest Aiseau. The French, driven from the village, retreated between Menonry, Aiseau-Centre and Presles. During the night of August 21 to 22, against the French counter-attacked and suffered very heavy losses at Roselies. The pantalons rouges fell back again Aiseau and left the village, going in the direction of Presles. At North East Aiseau, on the border with Tamines where other heavy fighting occurred, the Germans broke through the French lines and up the valley of the Sambre towards Le Roux by the Oignies neighborhood. At the height of the &quot;Ferme de la Belle-Motte&quot;, during the fighting, there was a rare violence in the woods and surrounding fields. The farm burned and the French had to withdraw on Le Roux and then to Devant-les-Bois.

As in the neighboring villages, in addition to the damage caused by the fighting, German soldiers set fire to dozens of home and shot many villagers. After the war, at a place called Belle-Motte, a Franco-German cemetery was built, called logically &quot;Cemetery Belle-Motte.&quot; The soldiers buried around the village and the region, were gathered in the upper part of the village. A few years later, German soldiers were transported to Vladslo Cemetery, near Ypres. 4,057 French soldiers are buried in the cemetery of Belle-Motte. 1182 buried in tombs and 2875 in two ossuaries.

==Natural environment==

Aiseau offers an impressive variety of natural habitats. In the North, the Sambre and alluvial grasslands allows us to remember that before the passage of the river, it was composed of unbroken meanders. Marshes occupied these places. Today, grasslands remain moist, with much biodiversity. A bank of the Moignelée, a former meander, is also protected.

The slag heap of Champfroment hosts various species of plants that are found further south in Europe.

The Biesme Valley also offers a remarkable diversity of natural habitats and species. In addition to the wealth of fish from the river, it is connected to Oignies ponds, dug by the monks of the Priory. These ponds are a nature reserve.

Still further south, the Biesme digs the valley more deeply. It then enters the &quot;Marlagne&quot; an area along the south of the Sambre several tens of kilometers. At the border of Presles, the river flows through a limestone area which makes the steep valley cliffs bordering the creek. The caves of the valley host bats.

The maximum height difference between Biesme and the top of the valley is about 100 m.

The Condroz is found Southeast of the village.

<doc id="673208" wikidata="Q705592" url="?curid=673208" title="Chief Mkwawa">
<text>Chief Mkwavinyika Munyigumba Mwamuyinga (c. 1855 – 19 July 1898), more commonly known as Chief Mkwawa or Sultan Mkwawa, was a Hehe tribal leader in German East Africa, based in Kalenga, Iringa region, who opposed the German colonization. The name &quot;Mkwawa&quot; is derived from &quot;Mukwava&quot;, a shortened form of &quot;Mukwavinyika&quot;, meaning &quot;conqueror of many lands&quot;.

As a young child he was named Ndesalasi, meaning &quot;troublemaker&quot;. As an adult he was named Mtwa Mkwava Mkwavinyika Mahinya Yilimwiganga Mkali Kuvagosi Kuvadala Tage Matenengo Manwiwage Seguniwagula Gumganga, meaning: &quot;A leader who takes control of the forests, who is aggressive to men and polite to women, who is unpredictable and unbeatable, and who has the power that it is only death who can take him away.&quot;

==Life==

Mkwawa was born in Luhota and was the son and successor of Sultan Munyigumba, who died in 1879.

In July 1891, the German commissioner Emil von Zelewski led a battalion of soldiers (320 askaris with officers and porters) to suppress the Hehe. On 17 August, they were attacked by Mkwawa&#x27;s 3,000-strong army at Lugalo, who, despite only being equipped with spears and a few guns, quickly overpowered the Germans and killed Zelewski.

On 28 October 1894, the Germans, under the new commissioner Colonel Freiherr Friedrich von Schele, attacked Mkwawa&#x27;s fortress at Kalenga. Although they took the fort, Mkwawa managed to escape. Subsequently, Mkwawa conducted a campaign of guerrilla warfare, harassing the Germans until 1898 when, on 19 July, he was surrounded and shot himself to avoid capture at the site of the Mlambalasi Rock Shelter. Mkwawa&#x27;s body was buried a few meters away from the rockshelter.

His brother Chambila, who was given the name (roughly meaning &quot;hero&quot;) for his heroism in battle, fought alongside him to his last breath. Mkwawa and his brother descended from an immigrant from the North named Mufwimi, a traditional name meaning &quot;a hunter&quot;.
== Skull ==

After his death, German soldiers removed Mkwawa&#x27;s head. The skull was sent to Berlin and probably ended up in the Übersee-Museum Bremen. In 1918 the then British Administrator of German East Africa Horace Byatt proposed to his government that it should demand a return of the skull to Tanganyika in order to reward the Wahehe for their cooperation with the British during the war and in order to have a symbol assuring the locals of the definitive end of German power. The skull&#x27;s return was stipulated in the 1919 Treaty of Versailles:

The Germans disputed that Mkwawa&#x27;s skull had been removed from East Africa and the British government took the position that the whereabouts could not be traced. However, after World War II the Governor of Tanganyika, Sir Edward Twining, took up the issue again. After enquiries he was directed to the Bremen Museum which he visited himself in 1953. The Museum had a collection of 2000 skulls, 84 of which originated from the former German East Africa. He short-listed the ones which showed measurements similar to surviving relatives of Chief Mkwawa; from this selection he picked the only skull with a bullet-hole as the skull of chief Mkwawa. The skull was finally returned on 9 July 1954, and now resides at the Mkwawa Memorial Museum in Kalenga, near the town of Iringa.

<doc id="673234" wikidata="Q995671" url="?curid=673234" title="Prefix grammar">
<text>In theoretical computer science and formal language theory, a prefix grammar is a type of string rewriting system, consisting of a set of string rewriting rules, and similar to a formal grammar or a semi-Thue system. What is specific about prefix grammars is not the shape of their rules, but the way in which they are applied: only prefixes are rewritten. The prefix grammars describe exactly all regular languages.

==Formal definition==
A prefix grammar &quot;G&quot; is a 3-tuple, (Σ, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;P&quot;), where 
*Σ is a finite alphabet
*&quot;S&quot; is a finite set of base strings over Σ
*&quot;P&quot; is a finite set of production rules of the form &quot;u&quot; → &quot;v&quot; where &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; are strings over Σ

For strings &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, we write &quot;x&quot; →&quot;G&quot; &quot;y&quot; (and say: &quot;G&quot; can derive &quot;y&quot; from &quot;x&quot; in one step) if there are strings &quot;u, v, w&quot; such that , and &quot;v&quot; → &quot;w&quot; is in &quot;P&quot;. Note that is a binary relation on the strings of Σ.

The &quot;language&quot; of &quot;G&quot;, denoted , is the set of strings derivable from &quot;S&quot; in zero or more steps: formally, the set of strings &quot;w&quot; such that for some &quot;s&quot; in &quot;S&quot;, &quot;s R w&quot;, where &quot;R&quot; is the transitive closure of .

==Example==
The prefix grammar
*Σ = {0, 1}
*&quot;S&quot; = {01, 10}
*&quot;P&quot; = {0 → 010, 10 → 100}
describes the language defined by the regular expression
:formula_1

<doc id="673235" wikidata="Q1033330" url="?curid=673235" title="Same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom">
<text>Same-sex marriage is legal in all parts of the United Kingdom. As marriage is a devolved legislative matter, different parts of the United Kingdom legalised at different times; it has been recognised and performed in England and Wales since March 2014, in Scotland since December 2014, and in Northern Ireland since January 2020. Civil partnerships, which offer most, but not all, of the rights and benefits of marriage, have been recognised since 2005. The United Kingdom was the 27th country in the world and the sixteenth in Europe to allow same-sex couples to marry nationwide. Polling suggests that a majority of British people support the legal recognition of same-sex marriage.

* Legislation to allow same-sex marriage in England and Wales was passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom in July 2013 and took effect on 13 March 2014. The first same-sex marriages took place on 29 March 2014.
* Legislation to allow same-sex marriage in Scotland was passed by the Scottish Parliament in February 2014 and took effect on 16 December 2014. The first marriage ceremonies for same-sex couples previously in civil partnerships occurred on 16 December. The first marriage ceremonies for couples not in civil partnerships occurred on 31 December 2014.
* Legislation to allow same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland was passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom in July 2019 and took effect on 13 January 2020. The first same-sex marriage ceremony took place on 11 February 2020.

Same-sex marriage is legal in eight of the fourteen British Overseas Territories. It has been recognised in South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands since 2014, Akrotiri and Dhekelia and the British Indian Ocean Territory (for UK military personnel only) since 3 June 2014, the Pitcairn Islands since 14 May 2015, the British Antarctic Territory since 13 October 2016, Gibraltar since 15 December 2016, the Falkland Islands since 29 April 2017, and Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha since 20 December 2017.

Civil partnerships were legalised in the Cayman Islands on 4 September 2020.

Same-sex marriage is legal in the Crown Dependencies. It has been recognised and performed in the Isle of Man since 22 July 2016, in Jersey since 1 July 2018, and in the Bailiwick of Guernsey at different times: in Guernsey since 2 May 2017, in Alderney since 14 June 2018, and in Sark since 23 April 2020.

==History==
===Legal history===
In common law, a marriage between persons of the same sex was void &quot;ab initio&quot;. In 1680, Arabella Hunt married &quot;James Howard&quot;; in 1682 the marriage was annulled on the ground that Howard was in fact Amy Poulter, a &quot;perfect woman in all her parts&quot;, and two women could not validly marry. On 30 March 1834, Anne Lister and Ann Walker were married at the Holy Trinity Church on Goodramgate in York, and thereafter considered themselves married, but without legal recognition. The church has been described as &quot;an icon for what is interpreted as the site of the first lesbian marriage to be held in Britain&quot;, and the building now hosts a commemorative blue plaque. The couple lived together at Shibden Hall until Lister&#x27;s death in 1840. In 1866, in &quot;Hyde v Hyde and Woodmansee&quot; (a case of polygamy), Lord Penzance&#x27;s judgment began: &quot;Marriage as understood in Christendom is the voluntary union for life of one man and one woman, to the exclusion of all others.&quot;

In &quot;Talbot (otherwise Poyntz) v Talbot&quot; in 1967, the prohibition was held to extend where one spouse was a post-operative transsexual, with Justice Roger Ormrod stating: &quot;Marriage is a relationship which depends on sex, not on gender&quot;. In 1971, the &quot;Nullity of Marriage Act&quot; was passed, explicitly banning marriages between same-sex couples in England and Wales. The parliamentary debates on the 1971 act included discussion on the issue of transsexualism but not homosexuality.

The 1971 act was later replaced by the &quot;Matrimonial Causes Act 1973&quot;, which also declared that a marriage was void if the parties were not respectively male and female. Prohibition of same-sex marriages was also included in the marriage legislation of Scotland and Northern Ireland. The &quot;Marriage Order (Northern Ireland) 2003&quot; stated there was a legal impediment to marriage if the parties were of the same sex, but the &quot;Marriage (Same-sex Couples) and Civil Partnership (Opposite-sex Couples) (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2019&quot; removed this provision. The &quot;Marriage Act (Scotland) 1977&quot; had a similar legal impediment, but following the passage of the &quot;Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Act 2014&quot;, the act no longer prohibits marriages if both parties are of the same sex.

On 17 July 2013, royal assent was granted to the &quot;Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013&quot;. On 10 December 2013, Her Majesty&#x27;s Government announced that the first same-sex marriages would take place from 29 March 2014.

===Civil partnerships===
The &quot;Civil Partnership Act 2004&quot; came into effect in December 2005. It created civil partnerships, which gave same-sex couples who entered into them most of the rights and responsibilities of marriage. These partnerships were called &quot;gay marriages&quot; by some of the British media; however, the government made clear that they were not marriages. Before this, an informal London Partnership Register had been set up in 2001 by the Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, but without any legal recognition.

Since Section 9 of the &quot;Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013&quot; took effect, any couple registered in a civil partnership is granted the ability to convert that partnership into a marriage.

===&quot;Wilkinson v Kitzinger and Others&quot;===
On 26 August 2003, Celia Kitzinger and Sue Wilkinson, both British university professors, legally married in British Columbia, Canada. However, on their return their marriage was not recognised under British law. Under the subsequent &quot;Civil Partnership Act&quot;, it was converted into a civil partnership. The couple sued for recognition of their marriage, arguing that it was legal in the country in which it was executed and met the requirements for recognition of overseas marriages and should thus be treated in the same way as one between opposite-sex couples. They rejected the conversion of their marriage into a civil partnership believing it to be both practically and symbolically a lesser substitute. They were represented by civil rights group Liberty. The group&#x27;s legal director James Welch said it was a matter of fairness and equality for the couple&#x27;s marriage to be recognised and that they &quot;shouldn&#x27;t have to settle for the second-best option of a civil partnership&quot;.

The High Court announced its judgement on 31 July 2006, ruling that their union would not be granted marriage status and would continue to be recognised in England and Wales as a civil partnership. The president of the Family Division, Sir Mark Potter, gave as his reason that &quot;abiding single sex relationships are in no way inferior, nor does English Law suggest that they are by according them recognition under the name of civil partnership&quot;, and that marriage was an &quot;age-old institution&quot; which, he suggested, was by &quot;longstanding definition and acceptance&quot; a relationship between a man and a woman. He agreed with the couple&#x27;s claim that they were being discriminated against by the &quot;Civil Partnership Act 2004&quot;, but considered that &quot;To the extent that by reason of that distinction it discriminates against same-sex partners, such discrimination has a legitimate aim, is reasonable and proportionate, and falls within the margin of appreciation accorded to Convention States.&quot; Attorney General Peter Goldsmith, as second respondent, sought £25,000 in legal costs from the couple, which the High Court ordered them to pay.

Wilkinson and Kitzinger said they were &quot;deeply disappointed&quot; with the judgement, not just for themselves, but for &quot;lesbian and gay families across the nation&quot;. They said that &quot;denying our marriage does nothing to protect heterosexual marriage, it simply upholds discrimination and inequality&quot; and also said that the ruling insulted LGBTQ people and treats their relationships as inferior to heterosexual ones; not worthy of marriage but only of an &quot;expressly different, and entirely separate institution&quot;. They said, however, that they believed the judgement &quot;won&#x27;t stand the test of time&quot; and that they looked forward to the day when &quot;there is full equality in marriage&quot;. They had originally announced their intention to appeal the decision but later abandoned it due to lack of funds.

Gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said that the establishment&#x27;s aggressive opposition to same-sex marriage and the successful demand of £25,000 from the couple damaged the government&#x27;s &quot;gay-friendly credentials&quot;. He also claimed that the demand in legal costs was designed to damage the couple financially so they would not be able to appeal. He said he was &quot;angry but not downcast&quot; about the ruling and that this was only a temporary setback in the &quot;long struggle for marriage equality&quot;.

==Debate==
===Campaign groups===
Equal Marriage, a campaign for same-sex marriage in Scotland, was established by the Equality Network in 2008, with a focus on securing same-sex marriage and different-sex civil partnerships in Scotland. In England and Wales, the first major campaign for same-sex marriage was Equal Love established by Peter Tatchell in 2010. The first major campaign against same-sex marriage in Britain was Scotland for Marriage established in 2011, followed by the Coalition for Marriage in England and Wales in 2012. Subsequent campaigns for and against same-sex marriage have been established by a wide variety of organisations, including the Coalition for Equal Marriage and Out4Marriage, both established in England in 2012. In Northern Ireland, a campaign for full same-sex marriage was established by LGBT rights activist and political campaigner Gary Spedding in June 2012 with the specific goal of challenging social attitudes whilst lobbying the Northern Ireland Assembly to enact legislation to permit same-sex marriages.

===Political parties===
&quot;Conservative Party&quot;: During the run-up to the 2010 general election, the then Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, said that a Conservative government would be happy to &quot;consider the case&quot; for ending the ban on same-sex marriage, although he was criticised for not making any specific promises. On 4 May 2010, the party published a &quot;Contract for Equalities&quot; which said it would &quot;consider&quot; recognising civil partnerships as marriages if elected.

&quot;Labour Party&quot;: In April 2010, Labour Minister for Equality Harriet Harman when asked about same-sex marriage said the issue was a &quot;developing area&quot; and that the government still had a &quot;long way to go&quot; with gay rights. Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the government did not allow same-sex marriage because it was &quot;intimately bound up with questions of religious freedom&quot;. During the 2010 Labour leadership election campaign, each of the Labour candidates expressed their support for reform to lead to the recognition of same-sex marriage. Following Ed Miliband&#x27;s victory, it became Labour party policy, with the party welcoming Her Majesty&#x27;s Government&#x27;s consultation and calling for legislation to be brought forth as soon as possible.

&quot;Liberal Democrats&quot;: Leader Nick Clegg stated in 2009 that his party backed legalisation. On 4 July 2009, in an article for LabourList, Clegg wrote that &quot;although civil partnerships have been a step forward, until same-sex marriage is permitted it is impossible to claim gay and straight couples are treated equally.&quot; Following this, the party&#x27;s LGBT rights group LGBT+ Liberal Democrats launched the petition &quot;Marriage Without Borders&quot; calling for all gender restrictions on marriage and civil partnerships to be lifted, and for same-sex relationships to be recognised across Europe and internationally. The petition was run at Manchester Pride and Reading Pride in 2009, and launched online in January 2010, following an interview with Clegg in &quot;Attitude&quot; magazine in which he reaffirmed his commitment to same-sex marriage. However, this did not make it into the party&#x27;s manifesto. In an interview in July 2010, Liberal Democrat Deputy Leader Simon Hughes confirmed that the coalition government was planning to open marriage to same-sex couples, saying, &quot;It would be appropriate in Britain in 2010, 2011, for there to be the ability for civil marriage for straight people and gay people equally... The state ought to give equality. We&#x27;re halfway there. I think we ought to be able to get there in this parliament&quot;. In September 2010, the Liberal Democrats voted at their Autumn Federal Conference to make same-sex marriage a party policy at the Westminster level. The Scottish Liberal Democrats had already approved a motion at their 2010 spring conference calling on the Scottish Government to allow same-sex couples to marry, describing the exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage as a &quot;discrimination that needs to end&quot;.

&quot;Green Party of England and Wales&quot;: On 22 May 2009, the Green Party called for an end to the ban on civil marriages between same-sex couples in Britain and in other EU member states. Party leader Caroline Lucas said the party wants marriage for same-sex couples and that married same-sex couples who travel throughout Europe should be able to have their relationship recognised on the same basis as married heterosexual couples. Peter Tatchell, who was the party&#x27;s candidate for Oxford East at the time, said there is a &quot;confusing patchwork&quot; of different partnership laws throughout Europe and that &quot;for a majority of lesbian and gay couples their legal rights stop at their own borders&quot;. He said, the &quot;best and most universally recognised system of partnership&quot; is civil marriage and, &quot;anything less is second class and discrimination&quot;.

===Religious bodies===
At their Yearly Meeting in 2009, the Quakers decided to recognise opposite-sex and same-sex marriages equally and perform marriage ceremonies for same-sex couples, making them the first mainstream religious body in the United Kingdom to do so. Under the law at that time, registrars were not allowed to legally officiate at a marriage between same-sex couples but the Quakers stated that the law did not preclude them from &quot;playing a central role in the celebration and recording of same-sex marriages&quot; and asked the government to change the law so that these marriages would be recognised. In a joint press release in 2012, the Quakers, Liberal Jews, and Unitarians gave their endorsement to the same-sex marriage consultation.

The largest Christian denominations were wholly opposed to the legislation to recognise and perform same-sex marriages. The leaders of the Catholic Church in England and Wales were vocal in opposition, urging both parishioners and schools within its care to sign a petition against the government plans, as did the Catholic Church in Scotland. The leaders of the Church of England were concerned that the legalisation of same-sex marriage would undermine the Church&#x27;s position as the state religion of England. The Methodist Church of Great Britain, in responding to the government consultation on same-sex marriage, acknowledged in 2012 that many Methodist churches had, over the previous 20 years, affirmed and celebrated the participation of gay men and lesbians in a union, but noted that the Methodist Church would not use the word &quot;marriage&quot; with reference to same-sex unions. However, in June 2021 the Methodist Church&#x27;s conference voted to allow same-sex marriages to be solemnised in their places of worship.

In 2012, the Muslim Council of Britain launched a campaign against same-sex marriage. The Chief Rabbi, Baron Sacks, and the Rabbinical Council of the United Synagogue also came out in opposition to the plans, stating that same-sex marriage was &quot;against Jewish law&quot;.

===Public opinion===

Opinion polls have shown general support for same-sex marriage among Britons. Attitudes towards homosexuality amongst the British public have become more supportive (or at least tolerant) over time; according to the British Social Attitudes Survey, in 1983 approximately 50% to 70% of respondents of the three major political parties (Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat) regarded homosexuality as &quot;always wrong&quot; or &quot;mostly wrong&quot; and in 1993 opposition to homosexuality was reported to have slightly increased amongst all parties. However, by 2003 attitudes had become more tolerant, with 25% to 50% of respondents regarding homosexuality as always or mostly wrong and by 2013, only around 20% to 35% of respondents in each party felt the same way. Liberal Democrat respondents tended to be less likely to regard homosexuality as wrong than Labour or Conservative respondents across each survey.

A 2004 poll by Gallup reported that 52% of respondents agreed that &quot;marriages between homosexuals&quot; should be recognised, while 45% said they should not. The poll also found that 65% supported allowing same-sex couples to form civil unions. A 2006 Eurobarometer survey reported that 46% of British people agreed that same-sex marriages should be allowed throughout Europe, slightly higher than the European Union average of 44%. A poll conducted in September 2008 by ICM Research for &quot;The Observer&quot; found that 55% of Britons believed that same-sex couples should be allowed to get married, with 45% against.

An opinion poll conducted in June 2009 by Populus for &quot;The Times&quot; reported that 61% of the British public agreed with the statement &quot;Gay couples should have an equal right to get married, not just to have civil partnerships&quot;, while 33% disagreed. Support was highest among those aged between 25 and 34, where 78% agreed and 19% disagreed. It was lowest amongst those over 65 where 37% agreed and 52% disagreed. A majority of both men and women agreed, but support was higher among women (67%) than men (55%). In terms of voting intention, 73% of Liberal Democrats, 64% of Labour voters and 53% of Conservatives agreed that same-sex couples should have the right to marry. A poll conducted by Angus Reid Public Opinion in July 2010 showed that 78% of British people supported either same-sex marriage or civil partnerships for same-sex couples, with 41% opting for same-sex marriage and 37% opting for civil partnerships. Support for no legal unions for same-sex couples decreased by 3% from August 2009.

According to the 2010 Scottish Social Attitudes Survey, 61% of Scottish people supported same-sex marriage, while 19% did not, and 18% neither agreed nor disagreed. In a similar poll in 2002, 42% of Scotland&#x27;s population supported same-sex marriage. In 2006, 53% of Scots backed same-sex marriage.

In July 2011, a representative survey conducted by Angus Reid Public Opinion showed that 43% of Britons believed same-sex couples should be legally allowed to marry, 34% thought same-sex couples should only be allowed to form civil partnerships, and 15% would grant no legal recognition to same-sex couples. A poll published by YouGov in March 2012 showed that 43% of British people supported same-sex marriage, while 32% supported civil partnerships, and 16% were opposed to any legal recognition of same-sex relationships. Support was particularly high amongst women, young people, people in Scotland and Liberal Democrat voters. Support was lower among the working class, older people, Conservative voters, and men in general. In the same poll, 62% expressed a belief that homosexual relationships had the same value as heterosexual ones, but 47% of people supported the right of the Church of England to defend different-sex marriage and 37% disagreed. A June 2012 YouGov survey indicated increasing support for LGBT rights among the British people. The report found that 71% were in favour of same-sex marriage. Two YouGov polls in December 2012 found that 55% of the population were in favour of introducing same-sex marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;YouGov / Sunday Times Survey Results 2012&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Another poll in May 2013 confirmed public support for the same-sex marriage bill, with 53% in favour.&lt;ref name=&quot;YouGov / Sunday Times Survey Results 2013&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A second poll in May showed a similar level of support (54%), and also found that 58% of those who considered same-sex marriage an important election issue would be more likely to vote for a party that supported it.&lt;ref name=&quot;YouGov / Sunday Times Survey Results 2013 2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A May 2013 Ipsos poll found that 55% of respondents were in favour of same-sex marriage. A poll by BBC Radio in March 2014 found that 68% of respondents supported same-sex marriage and 26% opposed it. The research also found that young people were more likely to support same-sex marriage, with 80% support from 18–34-year-olds, compared with 44% of over-65s. 75% of women were in favour, compared to 61% of men. A face-to-face survey conducted in 2015 by ICM Research for &quot;Channel 4&quot; found that 16% of British Muslims agreed with the statement that same-sex marriage should be legal in Britain, with 56% disagreeing. The survey also found that only 18% thought homosexuality should be legal in Britain, with 52% disagreeing. The 2015 Eurobarometer found that 71% of Britons thought same-sex marriage should be allowed throughout Europe, while 24% were opposed.

A September–October 2016 survey by the Varkey Foundation found that 77% of 18–21-year-olds supported same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom.

According to an Ipsos poll published in April 2018, 73% of the British public supported same-sex marriage, while 8% believed it should be banned. A further 13% personally disapproved of it, but did not wish to have it banned again. Additionally, the same poll found that 66% would approve of a royal same-sex wedding. A Pew Research Center poll, conducted between April and August 2017 and published in May 2018, showed that 77% of Britons supported same-sex marriage, 20% were opposed and 3% did not know or had refused to answer. When divided by religion, 83% of non-practising Christians, 82% of religiously unaffiliated people and 63% of church-attending Christians supported same-sex marriage. Opposition was 13% among 18–34-year-olds.

A June 2018 YouGov opinion poll found that 80% of British people supported the introduction of same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland, with 66% of Northern Irish respondents in favour. 70% of Conservative voters, 89% of Labour voters and 90% of Liberal Democrat voters were in favour of its introduction. Among &quot;Remain&quot; voters, 90% supported same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland, whereas &quot;Leave&quot; voters supported it at 68% (this was at a time when in the aftermath of the 2016 EU referendum the issue of Brexit dominated British politics).

The 2019 Eurobarometer found that 85% of Britons thought same-sex marriage should be allowed throughout Europe, while 12% were opposed. A YouGov poll conducted in September 2022 showed that 76% of Britons supported same-sex marriage, 13% were opposed and 10% did not know. More specifically, 52% strongly supported, while 24% &quot;tend[ed] to support&quot; same-sex marriage. Conversely, 7% &quot;tend[ed] to oppose&quot;, while 6% strongly opposed same-sex marriage. A Pew Research Center poll conducted between February and May 2023 showed that 74% of Britons supported same-sex marriage, 22% were opposed and 4% did not know or had refused to answer. When divided by political affiliation, support was highest among those on the left and the centre of the political spectrum at 81%, followed by those on the right at 65%. A June 2023 YouGov poll showed that 78% of Britons supported same-sex marriage.

==England and Wales==

===Background and consultation===
On 17 September 2011, at the Liberal Democrat Federal Conference, Lynne Featherstone announced that Her Majesty&#x27;s Government would launch a consultation in March 2012 on how to implement equal civil marriage for same-sex couples with the intention of any legislative changes being made by the next general election. The Prime Minister&#x27;s Office let it be known that David Cameron had personally intervened in favour of legalising same-sex unions, and on 5 October 2011 the Conservative Party Conference applauded Cameron&#x27;s support for same-sex marriage in his Leader&#x27;s Speech.

On 12 March 2012, the Government of the United Kingdom launched the public consultation on equal civil marriage in England and Wales. The government proposals were:

* to enable same-sex couples to have a civil marriage i.e., only civil ceremonies in a register office or approved premises (like a hotel);
* to make no changes to religious marriages. This would continue only to be legally possible between a man and a woman;
* to retain civil partnerships for same-sex couples and allow couples already in a civil partnership to convert this into a marriage;
* to continue to permit civil partnership registrations on religious premises as is possible, i.e., on a voluntary basis for faith groups and with no religious content; and
* to allow individuals to be able legally to change their gender without having to end their marriage.

Several political and media organisations expressed their support for same-sex marriage legislation in England and Wales, including the Green Party of England and Wales, the Liberal Democrats, the Labour Party, and Plaid Cymru, as well as &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and &quot;The Independent&quot;, which launched a campaign called &quot;Equal Partners&quot;. On 16 January 2013, the Coalition for Equal Marriage announced that it had evidence of the support of a majority of MPs in the House of Commons. The following political parties expressed their opposition to same-sex marriage legislation in England and Wales: the British National Party, which opposes same-sex marriage and civil partnerships, and the UK Independence Party.

The Conservative Party, the Scottish National Party and Sinn Féin had no official position or a position of neutrality on either the issue or the legislation as it applied to England and Wales. Senior Conservatives, including David Cameron, William Hague, George Osborne and Theresa May, supported the bill, however, the issue was contentious in the party. Just over half of Conservative MPs voted against in second reading, but polling showed that the majority of Conservative voters supported the bill. The Scottish National Party do not vote on English and Welsh matters, and therefore did not take part in the second reading vote, although the SNP-led Scottish Government introduced a bill to allow same-sex marriage in Scotland. Sinn Féin are abstentionist and therefore do not take their seats or vote in the House of Commons. In 2012, the first Northern Ireland Assembly motion proposed by Sinn Féin and the Green Party of Northern Ireland calling for same-sex marriage was defeated by the Democratic Unionist Party.

On 11 December 2012, the government released its response to the consultation. Of the 228,000 responses to the consultation, via the online form, email or correspondence, 53 percent agreed that all couples, regardless of their gender should be able to have a civil marriage ceremony, 46 percent disagreed, and one percent were unsure or did not answer the question. The government also confirmed that it separately received nineteen petitions from faith groups and organisations such as the Coalition for Marriage, with over 500,000 signatures opposing same-sex marriage.

===Legislation===

On 11 December 2012, the Minister for Women and Equalities, Maria Miller, announced that the government would bring forward same-sex marriage legislation for England and Wales in early 2013. In response to the consultation results, the proposals were extended to allow religious organisations to opt into performing same-sex marriages if they wish, and a &quot;quadruple-lock&quot; of additional measures to put the protection of religious freedoms &quot;utterly beyond doubt&quot;. These are:
* ensuring the legislation states explicitly that no religious organisation, or individual minister, can be compelled to marry same-sex couples or to permit this to happen on their premises;
* providing an &quot;opt-in&quot; system for religious organisations who wish to conduct marriages for same-sex couples, which also allows individual ministers to continue to refuse to perform same-sex marriage even when their religious organisation opts in;
* amending the &quot;Equality Act 2010&quot; to reflect that no discrimination claims can be brought against religious organisations or individual ministers for refusing to marry a same-sex couple or allowing their premises to be used for this purpose; and
* ensuring that the legislation will not affect the canon law of the Church of England or the Church in Wales, i.e., unless canon law and the same-sex marriage legislation are changed in future, both churches will be legally barred from performing same-sex marriages.

The UK Government addressed consultation responses about the possibility that the European Court of Human Rights could force all churches to marry same-sex couples, stating: 

On 24 January 2013, the &quot;Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill&quot; was introduced to the Commons by Maria Miller, and a full debate occurred at the second reading on 5 February. The bill retained some distinctions from marriage between a man and a woman; e.g. in divorce proceedings, adultery can only involve sexual conduct between two persons of the opposite sex, while non-consummation will not be grounds for annulment of a same-sex marriage. On 5 February 2013, the bill passed its second reading in the House of Commons by 400 votes to 175.
The bill was examined in 13 sittings by the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill Committee, a public bill committee established to scrutinise the bill line by line. The bill completed its committee stage on 12 March 2013 and had its report stage in the House of Commons on 20–21 May 2013. The third reading took place on 21 May, and was approved by 366 votes to 161, with the bill receiving its first reading in the House of Lords the same evening. The bill had its second reading unopposed in the Lords on 4 June, after a &quot;wrecking amendment&quot; proposed by Lord Dear was defeated by a vote of 390–148, thus allowing the bill to proceed to the committee stage. The bill passed its third reading in the House of Lords on 15 July 2013, and the Commons accepted all of the Lords&#x27; amendments on the following day, with royal assent by Queen Elizabeth II granted on 17 July 2013.

On 10 December 2013, Miller announced that same-sex marriage ceremonies would begin on 29 March 2014 in England and Wales. Couples wishing to be among the first to marry were required to give formal notice of their intention by 13 March 2014. As of 13 March 2014, couples who have entered into same-sex marriages overseas are recognised as married in England and Wales. The parts of the law that allow civil partnerships to be converted into marriages, and allow married people to change their legal gender while remaining married, took effect on 10 December 2014. Same-sex marriages in England and Wales began at midnight on 29 March 2014.

==Scotland==

Same-sex marriage has been legal in Scotland since 16 December 2014, with the first same-sex marriages occurring on 31 December 2014. The law provides that religious organisations and individual celebrants are under no obligation to perform marriage ceremonies for same-sex couples, though religious organisations are permitted to authorise their clergy to do so.

On 25 July 2012, the Scottish Government announced that it would legalise same-sex marriage. The move was announced despite opposition by the Church of Scotland and the Catholic Church in Scotland. Although Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the move as the &quot;right thing to do&quot;, she reassured churches that they would not be forced to perform same-sex marriages. During the consultation phase, ministers received over 19,000 messages from constituents about the issue.

On 27 June 2013, the Scottish Government introduced same-sex marriage legislation to the Scottish Parliament. On 4 February 2014, the Scottish Parliament held its final reading on the bill to permit same-sex marriages. The bill passed by a vote of 108–15 and received royal assent on 12 March 2014. The legislation allows religious and faith organisations to be exempted from having to conduct or be involved in same-sex marriages if it contravenes their beliefs. The first same-sex weddings occurred on 31 December 2014, though civil partnerships could be exchanged for marriage certificates from 16 December so the very first same-sex marriages under Scottish law were recognised that day.

==Northern Ireland==
Same-sex marriage became legal in Northern Ireland on 13 January 2020. In previous years, the Northern Ireland Assembly had voted on the issue on five occasions, winning a majority for same-sex marriage once. Previously, same-sex marriages performed in England, Wales and Scotland were recognised as civil partnerships in Northern Ireland.

===Early bills===
Legislation to allow for the recognition of same-sex marriages in Northern Ireland has been debated in the Assembly five times since 2012. On four of those occasions, only a minority of assembly members voted in favour of same-sex marriage, though the most recent vote on the issue in November 2015 saw a majority of MLAs vote in favour of same-sex marriage.

On 27 April 2015, the Northern Ireland Assembly voted for the fourth time on the recognition of same-sex marriage. The motion for recognition was introduced by Sinn Féin and was defeated by a majority of 49 votes to 47; all Democratic Unionist (DUP) members in the Assembly voted against it, while all Sinn Féin, Green Party and NI21 members voted for it. On 2 November 2015, 105 MLAs voted on a motion to recognise same-sex marriage, with 53 voting in favour and 52 voting against, the first time same-sex marriage had received majority support in the Assembly. However, the Democratic Unionist Party tabled a petition of concern, preventing the motion from having any legal effect.

Sinn Féin said that legislation regarding same-sex marriage would be a priority for the party in the Assembly elected in May 2016. On 23 June 2016, Finance Minister Máirtín Ó Muilleoir announced he had requested that officials in the Northern Ireland Executive begin drafting legislation to allow same-sex marriage, stating that MLAs would much rather vote on the issue than &quot;be forced to legislate [following] an adverse judgment&quot; in the courts. In October 2016, First Minister Arlene Foster reaffirmed the DUP&#x27;s opposition to same-sex marriage, saying the party would continue to issue a petition of concern blocking same-sex marriage in the Assembly over the next five years. The DUP won fewer than 30 seats at the March 2017 elections, meaning it lost the right to unilaterally block a bill using a petition of concern. Karen Bradley, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, stated in February 2018 that same-sex marriage could be legislated for in Northern Ireland by the UK Parliament, and that the government would likely allow a conscience vote for its MPs if such legislation was introduced. Labour MP Conor McGinn said he would introduce a private member&#x27;s bill extending same-sex marriage to Northern Ireland by the end of March 2018.

The &quot;Marriage (Same Sex Couples) (Northern Ireland) Bill&quot; was introduced to the House of Commons on 28 March 2018, and passed its first reading. The bill&#x27;s second reading in the Commons was blocked by a Conservative MP on three occasions in 2018. An identical bill was introduced to the House of Lords on 27 March by Baron Hayward, and passed its first reading that day. As both bills were private member&#x27;s bills without government support, they failed to progress any further. In February 2019, Lord Hayward withdrew an amendment to an unrelated government bill, which if passed would have extended same-sex marriage to Northern Ireland, on opposition from government Lords.

On 1 November 2018, royal assent was granted to the &quot;Northern Ireland (Executive Formation and Exercise of Functions) Act 2018&quot;, which contains sections describing Northern Ireland&#x27;s same-sex marriage and abortion bans as human rights violations. The law did not legalise same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland, but directed the British Government to &quot;issue guidance&quot; to civil servants in Northern Ireland &quot;in relation to the incompatibility of human rights with [the region&#x27;s laws on the two issues]&quot;. The law passed 207–117 in the House of Commons.

===2019 legalisation by Westminster===
In July 2019, McGinn announced his intention to attach an amendment to an upcoming administrative bill relating to Northern Ireland, which would legalise same-sex marriage three months after passage of the bill if the Northern Ireland Assembly remained suspended. Under the terms of the originally-drafted amendment, the region&#x27;s executive could approve or repeal the measure upon resumption. The amendment passed in the House of Commons with 383 votes in favour and 73 votes against. McGinn&#x27;s amendment, which was further amended by Lord Hayward during passage in the House of Lords, required the Secretary of State to issue regulations extending same-sex marriage to Northern Ireland if the Assembly had not reconvened by 21 October 2019. If this occurred, then the regulations would come into effect on 13 January 2020. The bill passed its final stages in the Parliament and received royal assent on 24 July 2019, becoming the &quot;Northern Ireland (Executive Formation etc) Act 2019&quot;.

On 21 October 2019, 31 unionist MLAs signed a petition to reconvene the Northern Ireland Assembly to pass legislation to keep abortion illegal. The sitting was boycotted by Sinn Féin, the Alliance Party, the Green Party, and People Before Profit, and as a result the speaker, Robin Newton, ruled that the Assembly could not conduct business after an election unless a speaker could be elected on a cross-community vote. The sitting was therefore abandoned, and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Julian Smith, stated in the House of Commons that the British Government would issue the regulations as obliged. The regulations came into effect on 13 January 2020, and the first legal same-sex wedding ceremony in Northern Ireland took place on 11 February 2020 between Robyn Peoples and Sharni Edwards-Peoples in Belfast.

===Court challenges===
Two legal challenges to Northern Ireland&#x27;s same-sex marriage ban were heard in the High Court in November and December 2015. Two couples, Grainne Close and Shannon Sickles and Chris and Henry Flanagan-Kanem, brought the case claiming that Northern Ireland&#x27;s prohibition on same-sex marriage breached their human rights. The case was heard simultaneously with a case brought in January 2015 in which two men who wed in England sought to have their marriage recognised in Northern Ireland. A ruling was handed down in August 2017; Judge John Ailbe O&#x27;Hara found against the couples and determined that there were no grounds under case law from the European Court of Human Rights that the couples&#x27; rights were violated by Northern Ireland&#x27;s refusal to recognise their union as a marriage. One of the couples involved in the litigation (who were granted anonymity) said they would appeal the ruling. The appeal was heard by a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeal on 16 March 2018; a ruling had been expected some time in 2019. On 7 April 2020, the Court of Appeal in Belfast ruled that same-sex couples faced unjustified discrimination while denied the opportunity to marry in Northern Ireland. But with changes to the law meaning same-sex weddings can take place in Northern Ireland since 11 February 2020, senior judges decided not to make a formal declaration on any human rights breach.

===Public opinion===
A September 2014 LucidTalk poll for the &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; showed that 40.1% of the population supported same-sex marriage, while 39.4% opposed and 20.5% either had or stated no opinion. Of those that gave an opinion, 50.5% supported and 49.5% opposed same-sex marriage. A poll in May 2015 found that 68% of the population supported same-sex marriage, with support rising to 75% in Belfast. A &quot;mass rally&quot;, organised by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Amnesty International, and the Rainbow Project took place in Belfast on 13 June 2015, with a 20,000 person turnout. A June 2016 poll placed support for same-sex marriage at 70%, while those opposing it at 22%.

An April 2018 poll put support for same-sex marriage among Northern Ireland&#x27;s population at 76%, while 18% were opposed.

==Royal same-sex weddings==
In October and November 2021, several European governments, including those of Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden, confirmed that members of their respective royal families may marry a partner of the same sex without having to forfeit the crown or lose their royal titles and privileges or their place in the line of succession. The British Government has not commented on the matter, though royal experts have questioned whether the status of the king or queen as head of the Church of England, which currently does not allow same-sex marriages in its churches, would prevent an heir in a same-sex union from ascending the throne.

The first same-sex marriage for a member of the British royal family occurred on 22 September 2018 when Lord Ivar Mountbatten married his partner James Coyle at his private estate in Uffculme. Mountbatten is through his father, David Mountbatten, the great-great-great grandson of Queen Victoria and a first cousin, once removed of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. His ex-wife Penny Mountbatten walked him down the aisle. A second marriage occurred in February 2024 for Ellen Lascelles and her Australian partner Channtel McPherson in Byron Bay, New South Wales. Lascelles is the daughter of Jeremy Lascelles and a great-great-granddaughter of King George V.

==Marriage statistics==

1,409 same-sex marriages were performed between 29 March and 30 June 2014, with lesbian couples accounting for 56% of these marriages. By October 2015, approximately 15,000 same-sex marriages had been performed in England and Wales. Of these, 7,366 were new marriages, while 7,732 were conversions from civil partnerships. 55% of these marriages were between female couples and 45% were between male couples. During that same time period, the number of couples opting for civil partnerships fell significantly. In Cheshire for example, around 70 civil partnerships were recorded each year, but in 2015 only 4 partnerships were performed in the county.

462 same-sex marriages were performed in Scotland in the first five months of legalisation, accounting for 12% of all marriages performed during that time. Statistics published by the National Records of Scotland showed that 1,671 same-sex marriages took place in Scotland in 2015. Of these, 935 were conversions from civil partnerships and 736 were new marriages.

The following table shows the number of same-sex marriages performed in England and Wales since March 2014 according to the Office for National Statistics. The overwhelming majority of same-sex marriages are performed in civil ceremonies; there were 23 religious same-sex marriages in 2014, 44 in 2015, 61 in 2016, 43 in 2017 and 63 in 2018. In 2018, the average age of marriage for same-sex partners was 40.4 years for men and 36.9 years for women. Figures for 2020 are lower than previous years because of restrictions in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The 2021 United Kingdom census showed that there were 133,618 people in same-sex civil partnerships and 268,522 married same-sex spouses in England and Wales, with Brighton and Hove having the highest proportion of same-sex marriages of any city in England and Wales.

==Religious performance==

Most major religious organisations in the United Kingdom do not perform same-sex marriages in their places of worship, though many offer blessings to same-sex couples. Some small Christian denominations such as the Dutch Church in London, Quakers and Unitarians solemnise same-sex marriages. In 2001, the Open Episcopal Church became the first in the United Kingdom to perform religious same-sex marriage ceremonies. Quakers formally expressed support for same-sex marriage in 2009. In May 2016, the Oasis Church Waterloo in London applied for a licence allowing it to conduct same-sex marriages. Pastor Steve Chalke said &quot;Oasis Church in Waterloo has reached the decision. It&#x27;s taken us some time to reach it, that this is something we want to do&quot;. In addition, Liberal Judaism and the Movement for Reform Judaism perform same-sex marriages, and campaigned in favour of legalisation. Pagans also perform same-sex marriages. The first legally recognised religious same-sex wedding in the United Kingdom was solemnised by the Metropolitan Community Church in Pokesdown, Bournemouth on 12 April 2014. 

In June 2016, the Scottish Episcopal Church became the first British province in the Anglican Communion to take steps to allow same-sex marriages to be performed in their churches. The General Synod voted in favour of a motion to begin discussion amongst the seven dioceses to remove the doctrinal clause which stated that marriage was &quot;between a man and a woman&quot;. The vote received support from five of seven bishops, 69% of the clergy and 80% of the laity. The General Synod formally approved the change to the doctrinal clause in June 2017, removing language stating that marriages could only be &quot;between a man and a woman&quot; and introducing a new conscience clause which allows clergy to opt out of performing same-sex weddings. On 20 July 2017, it was announced that a same-sex wedding was to be held at St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral in Glasgow later in the summer. On 1 August 2017, a same-sex marriage, which included the Eucharist as a nuptial mass, was held at the Church of St John the Evangelist in Edinburgh. The Scottish Episcopal Church is estimated to have 100,000 members, and offers same-sex marriage to other Anglicans, including members of churches in England and the United States.

In July 2016, the United Reformed Church voted overwhelmingly to allow its churches to perform same-sex marriages. The Church, with 60,000 members and 1,400 congregations, became the largest Christian denomination in the United Kingdom to offer same-sex marriages at that time. In June 2021 the Methodist Church of Great Britain voted to permit same-sex marriage in their places of worship. The Methodist Conference voted 254 to 46 in favour of the move. A freedom of conscience clause allows ministers with objections to opt out of performing same-sex weddings. With about 164,000 members and 4,000 churches, the Methodist Church became the largest Christian denomination in the country to permit same-sex marriages at that time. Among the first couples to wed were Jason and Ben McMahon-Riley who married at the Fulwood Methodist Church in Preston, Lancashire on 17 June 2021.

The Catholic Church opposes same-sex marriage and does not allow its priests to officiate at such marriages. In December 2023, the Holy See published &quot;Fiducia supplicans&quot;, a declaration allowing Catholic priests to bless couples who are not considered to be married according to church teaching, including the blessing of same-sex couples. The British Confraternity of Catholic Clergy released a statement on 21 December that the blessings outlined in &quot;Fiducia supplicans&quot; are &quot;theologically, pastorally and practically inadmissible&quot;.

Buddhist groups also perform same-sex marriages. In 2014, David Brazier of the Amida Trust, a Pure Land Buddhist denomination, performed a same-sex marriage in Malvern, Worcestershire. In July 2017, Jahed Choudhury and Sean Rogan were married in Walsall, West Midlands adorning gold sherwanis, marking the &quot;first same-sex Muslim wedding in the United Kingdom&quot; according to &quot;The Independent&quot;. The first interfaith lesbian wedding occurred in Leicester in August 2017 for Kalavati Mistry and Miriam Jefferson, a Hindu-Jewish couple. According to the Office for National Statistics, married same-sex spouses in 2021 were more likely to be Pagan, Buddhist or non-religious than married opposite-sex spouses, who were significantly more likely to be Christian, Muslim, Sikh or Hindu. There were no differences with regard to Jewish spouses.

===Church of England===
In January 2023, bishops of the Church of England refused to support a change to permit same-sex couples to marry in its churches. However, the bishops supported a &quot;prayers of dedication, thanksgiving or for God&#x27;s blessing&quot; for same-sex couples following a civil marriage or partnership. The General Synod of the Church of England voted 250–181 to support the move in early February. Archbishops Justin Welby and Stephen Cottrell said, &quot;It has been a long road to get us to this point. For the first time, the [Church of England] will publicly, unreservedly and joyfully welcome same-sex couples in church. The church continues to have deep differences on these questions which go to the heart of our human identity. As archbishops, we are committed to respecting the conscience of those for whom this goes too far and to ensure that they have all the reassurances they need in order to maintain the unity of the church as this conversation continues.&quot; Religious same-sex marriage ceremonies in the Church of England are supported by some clergy, including the Bishop of Oxford, Steven Croft, and the Bishop of Reading, Olivia Graham.

In March 2023, Labour MP Ben Bradshaw introduced a bill to Parliament to &quot;allow, in certain circumstances, priests and parishes [of the Church of England] that wish to conduct same-sex weddings to do so&quot;. A 2023 survey conducted by &quot;The Times&quot; showed that 53% of priests in the Church of England supported religious same-sex marriage ceremonies in the church.

On 15 November, the General Synod voted to allow clergy to bless same-sex marriages. The measure, which passed with a one vote majority, took effect on 17 December 2023. Among the first couples to receive a blessing were Reverend Catherine Bond and Reverend Jane Pearce during Holy Eucharist on 17 December at St. John the Baptist Church in Felixstowe, Suffolk. Reverend Canon Andrew Dotchin, who offered the blessing, described the couple&#x27;s relationship as a &quot;pilgrimage graced by [God&#x27;s] blessing&quot;.

===Church of Scotland===
In May 2018, the Church of Scotland voted to draft new laws that would allow ministers to conduct same-sex marriages. The motion was passed by the General Assembly by a vote of 345 to 170. The legal questions committee had two years to draft legislation. In May 2021, the General Assembly voted 319–217 to approve the draft legislation. The law includes safeguards for ministers opposed to performing same-sex marriages. The presbyteries voted 29–12 in support of the legislation in April, and the General Assembly gave its final approval on 23 May 2022 by 274 votes to 136. Reverend Scott Rennie, the minister of Queen&#x27;s Cross Church in Aberdeen, welcomed the move, saying, &quot;My marriage to my husband, Dave, nurtures my life and my ministry, and frankly I do not think I could be a minister of this church without his love and support. It is always there in the background. Same-sex marriage is like opposite-sex marriage and it has its joys and sorrows, its glories and its tensions. It&#x27;s pretty normal, really.&quot; The vote made the Church of Scotland the largest church in the United Kingdom to allow same-sex marriages.

===Church in Wales===
In September 2021, the Church in Wales voted to bless—but not perform—same-sex marriages in the church. The move was supported unanimously by the bishops, while the clergy voted 28 to 12 in favor with two abstentions, and the laity voted 49 to 10 with one abstention. Gregory Cameron, bishop of the Diocese of St Asaph, said the decision was a &quot;huge step forward for the church and for us all in Wales&quot;. The measure includes a conscience clause, allowing individual clergy to decide whether or not to offer blessings. Cameron performed the first blessing on 13 November 2021 for Father Lee Taylor, the Vicar of Llangollen, and his partner Fabiano Da Silva Duarte.

==Consular marriages==
Following the &quot;Consular Marriage and Marriages under Foreign Law Order 2014&quot;, &quot;a consular marriage may take place in those countries or territories outside the United Kingdom which have notified the Secretary of State in writing that there is no objection to such marriages taking place in that country or territory and which have not subsequently revoked that notice&quot;. Same-sex consular marriages are possible in 26 countries: Australia, Azerbaijan, Bolivia, Cambodia, Chile, China (including Hong Kong), Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Japan, Kosovo, Latvia, Lithuania, Mongolia, Montenegro, Nicaragua, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, San Marino, Serbia, Seychelles and Vietnam.

240 consular same-sex marriages were performed between June 2014 and the end of December 2015. An additional 140 couples converted their civil partnerships into marriages. Consular marriages for same-sex couples were particularly popular in Australia prior to the country&#x27;s legalisation of same-sex marriage in 2017. 445 couples had married in British consulates across Australia by October 2017.

==Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories==
Same-sex marriage is legal and performed in the three Crown Dependencies of Britain and in eight of the fourteen Overseas Territories.

===Crown Dependencies===
* Isle of Man – Legislation allowing the performance and recognition of same-sex marriage was approved by the House of Keys on 8 March 2016, and by the Legislative Council on 26 April 2016. The legislation was granted royal assent on 13 July and went into effect on 22 July 2016.
* Guernsey – The States of Guernsey approved a motion to legislate for the recognition and performance of same-sex marriage in December 2015. The &quot;Same-Sex Marriage (Guernsey) Law, 2016&quot; was approved by the States in September 2016 by a vote of 33–5, and gained royal assent on 14 December 2016. The law went into effect on 2 May 2017. The legislation does not extend to Guernsey&#x27;s dependencies, Alderney and Sark. 
**Alderney – A bill to allow same-sex marriage was approved by the States of Alderney on 18 October 2017, and received royal assent on 13 December 2017. The law came into effect on 14 June 2018.
**Sark – On 17 December 2019, the Chief Pleas approved legislation mirroring the provisions of Guernsey&#x27;s same-sex marriage law. The bill received royal assent in the Privy Council on 11 March 2020, and came into effect on 23 April 2020.
*Jersey – A motion to introduce legislation regarding same-sex marriage was approved by the States Assembly in September 2015. A same-sex marriage bill was eventually debated by the States on 1 February 2018, where it passed by a vote of 42–1. The law received royal assent on 23 May and went into effect on 1 July 2018.

===Overseas Territories===

Of the fourteen British Overseas Territories, same-sex marriage is allowed in eight: Akrotiri and Dhekelia, the British Antarctic Territory, the British Indian Ocean Territory, the Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, the Pitcairn Islands, Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands.
* Akrotiri and Dhekelia – Same-sex marriage has been recognised and performed in the Sovereign Base Areas since 3 June 2014, for UK military personnel only. The first same-sex marriage was conducted in Dhekelia on 10 September 2016. Civil partnerships have also been allowed for military personnel since 7 December 2005. 
*Bermuda – On 5 May 2017, the Bermuda Supreme Court issued a ruling in favour of same-sex marriage. The ruling allowed several same-sex couples to marry in Bermuda over the following months. However, the Bermuda Parliament passed a law in December 2017 to replace same-sex marriages with domestic partnerships. The law went into effect on 1 June 2018. On 6 June 2018, the Supreme Court revoked the parts of the law that banned same-sex marriages, but the decision was stayed pending appeal, which the government lost on 23 November 2018. On 14 March 2022, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council upheld the government&#x27;s appeal, ending the right to same-sex marriage in Bermuda. 
* British Antarctic Territory – A same-sex marriage ordinance has been in force since 13 October 2016. 
* British Indian Ocean Territory – A same-sex marriage ordinance has been in force since 3 June 2014. Civil partnerships have also been allowed for military personnel since 7 December 2005.
*Cayman Islands – Same-sex civil partnerships are legal following the enactment of a partnership law by Governor Martyn Roper on 4 September 2020. However, a suit by a same-sex couple seeking access to same-sex marriage was rejected by the Privy Council on 14 March 2022.
* Falkland Islands – On 30 March 2017, the Legislative Assembly of the Falkland Islands approved a bill legalising same-sex marriage by a vote of 7 to 1. It received royal assent on 13 April and went into effect on 29 April 2017. 
* Gibraltar – On 26 October 2016, the &quot;Civil Marriage Amendment Act 2016&quot; was passed in the Gibraltar Parliament with unanimous support from all 15 members present during the vote. It received royal assent on 1 November and took effect on 15 December 2016.
* Pitcairn Islands – An ordinance to recognise and perform same-sex marriage was unanimously approved by the Island Council, and signed by Governor Jonathan Sinclair on 5 May 2015. It was published on 13 May 2015 and took effect the next day.
* Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha – Same-sex marriage is legislated for throughout the territory:
** Ascension Island – A same-sex marriage ordinance was unanimously approved by all five present members of the Ascension Island Council on 31 May 2016. It was signed by Governor Lisa Honan and published in the official gazette on 20 June. On 23 December 2016, Honan issued an order to commence the law on 1 January 2017.
** Tristan da Cunha – An ordinance extending the Ascension Island same-sex marriage law to Tristan da Cunha was issued on 4 August 2017.
** Saint Helena – The Legislative Council of Saint Helena passed a same-sex marriage bill on 19 December 2017; it was given royal assent the next day.
* South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands – Same-sex marriage has been legal in the territory since 2014.
* Same-sex marriage and civil partnerships are not performed or recognised in Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, Montserrat and the Turks and Caicos Islands.

In July 2022, Lord Cashman introduced legislation to the House of Lords to legalise same-sex marriage in the remaining six British Overseas Territories. The bill would &quot;empower the Governor of each Territory to make changes to the law in the Territory to recognize the lawfulness of same-sex marriage and allow for the solemnization of marriage of same-sex couples.&quot; It had its first reading in the House of Lords on 6 July. The Governor of the Cayman Islands, Martyn Roper, said the measure has &quot;little chance of progressing&quot;. This is not the first attempt to extend same-sex marriage rights to all British Overseas Territories; in February 2019, a Foreign Affairs Select Committee report recommended extending same-sex marriage laws in all territories with an Order in Council. The Leader of the Opposition of the Turks and Caicos Islands, Washington Misick, accused the British Government of trying to &quot;neutralise the authority&quot; of the Caribbean territories. MP Chris Bryant accused territories of wanting to &quot;have their cake and eat it&quot; by refusing to allow same-sex marriages: &quot;You want to be under the British umbrella, but you do not want to be part of the British way of life.&quot;

<text>Hooters is the registered trademark used by two American restaurant chains: Hooters, Inc., based in Clearwater, Florida, and Hooters of America, Inc. based in Atlanta, Georgia, and owned by the private investment firm Nord Bay Capital (with TriArtisan Capital Advisor as its advisor). The Hooters name is a double entendre referring to both a North American slang term for women&#x27;s breasts and the logo (a bird known for its &quot;hooting&quot; calls: the owl).

The waiting staff at Hooters restaurants are primarily young women, usually referred to simply as &quot;Hooters Girls&quot;, whose revealing outfits and sex appeal are played up and are a primary component of the company&#x27;s image. The company employs men and women as cooks, hosts (at some franchises), busboys, and managers. The menu includes hamburgers and other sandwiches, steaks, seafood entrees, appetizers, and the restaurant&#x27;s specialty, chicken wings. Almost all Hooters restaurants hold alcoholic beverage licenses to sell beer and wine, and where local permits allow, a full liquor bar. Hooters T-shirts, sweatshirts, and various souvenirs and curios are also sold.

, there were more than 430 Hooters locations and franchises around the world and Hooters of America LLC. owns 160 units. In 2012, there were Hooters locations in 44 US states, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, and 28 other countries. Hooters also had an airline, Hooters Air, with a normal flight crew and flight attendants and scantily clad &quot;Hooters Girls&quot; on every flight.

==History==
Hooters, Inc., was incorporated in Clearwater, Florida, on April 1, 1983, by six Clearwater businessmen: Lynn D. Stewart, Gil DiGiannantonio, Ed Droste, Billy Ranieri, Ken Wimmer and Dennis Johnson.
The date was an April Fools&#x27; Day joke because the original six owners believed that their prospect was going to fail. Their first Hooters restaurant was built on the site of a former rundown nightclub that had been purchased at a low price. So many businesses had folded in that particular location that the Hooters founders built a small &quot;graveyard&quot; at the front door for each that had come and gone before them. The first restaurant opened its doors on October 4, 1983, in Clearwater. This original location was decorated with memorabilia from Waverly, Iowa, hometown to some of the original Hooters 6.

In December 1984, Hugh Connerty bought the rights to Hooters from the Original Hooters 6. Robert H. Brooks and a group of Atlanta investors (operators of Hooters of America, Inc.) bought out Hugh Connerty. In 2002, Brooks bought majority control and became chairman. The Clearwater-based company retained control over restaurants in the Tampa Bay Area, Chicago metropolitan area, and one in Manhattan, while all other locations were under the aegis of Hooters of America, which sold franchising rights to the rest of the United States and international locations. Under Brooks&#x27;s leadership, the collective Hooters brand expanded to more than 425 stores worldwide. Brooks died on July 15, 2006, in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, of a heart attack. Brooks&#x27;s will gave most of Hooters of America Inc. to his son Coby Brooks and daughter Boni Belle Brooks.

The Hooters Casino Hotel was opened February 2, 2006, off the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada, adjacent to the Tropicana, across the street from the MGM Grand Las Vegas. It became the Oyo Hotel &amp; Casino in 2019, though the Hooters restaurant on the property remains open.

As part of their 25th anniversary, &quot;Hooters Magazine&quot; released its list of top Hooters Girls of all time. Among the best-known were Lynne Austin (the original Hooters Girl), the late Kelly Jo Dowd (the mother of the golfer Dakoda Dowd), Bonnie-Jill Laflin, Leeann Tweeden, and Holly Madison.

After Brooks&#x27; death in 2006, 240 buyers showed interest in Hooters of America Inc., and 17 submitted bids, with that number being reduced to eight, and then three, before the selection of Wellspring Capital Management. Chanticleer Holdings LLC of Charlotte, North Carolina, which had the right to block the sale after a $5 million loan made in 2006, did so in a December 1, 2010, letter to the court. As a result, Chanticleer and other investors bought the company from the Brooks family.

In January 2011, Chanticleer and others completed the purchase of Hooters of America Inc. from the Brooks family.

, Hooters of America owned 160 restaurants and operates or franchises over 430.

On July 1, 2019, Hooters was sold to Nord Bay Capital and TriArtisan Capital Advisors.

In June 2024, Hooters abruptly closed approximately 40 locations that were deemed underperforming, blaming rising costs and a decline in sales as part of the decision. On February 21, 2025, it was reported that Hooters was preparing to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection within the coming months after prior closures in 2024 and revenue losses at its locations.

===Hoots spinoff===
In response to declining sales, in 2017 the company launched a fast casual spinoff of its format called &quot;Hoots&quot;. Hoots is distinguished from its original concept primarily by a reduction in menu items and employment of both male and female servers who are modestly dressed in t-shirts and khakis.

==Hooters Girls==
The appearance of the waitresses is a main selling feature of the restaurant. A &quot;Hooters Girl&quot; is a waitress employed by the Hooters restaurant chain, and they are recognizable by their uniform of a white tank top with the &quot;Hootie the Owl&quot; logo and the location name on the front paired with short nylon orange Dolphin shorts. The remainder of the Hooters Girls uniform consists of the restaurant&#x27;s brown ticket pouch (or a black one with the black uniform), tan pantyhose, white loose socks, and clean white shoes. Men who work at Hooters wear Hooters hats, T-shirts with long pants, Bermuda shorts, or attire more suitable for kitchen use.

===Employee handbook requirements===
An older version of the Hooters Employee Handbook (prior to October 2006), published in The Smoking Gun reads:

Customers can go to many places for wings and beer, but it is our Hooters Girls who make our concept unique. Hooters offers its customers the look of the &quot;All American Cheerleader, Surfer, Girl Next Door.&quot;

Female employees are required to sign that they &quot;acknowledge and affirm&quot; the following:

# My job duties require I wear the designated Hooters Girl uniform.
# My job duties require that I interact with and entertain the customers.
# The Hooters concept is based on female sex appeal and the work environment is one in which joking and entertaining conversations are commonplace.

==Marketing==
===Charitable activities===
Hooters has actively supported charities through its Hooters Community Endowment Fund, also known as HOO.C.E.F., a play on UNICEF. It has provided money and/or volunteers to charities such as Habitat for Humanity, The V Foundation for Cancer Research, Operation Homefront, Make-A-Wish Foundation, Special Olympics, Muscular Dystrophy Association and Stop Hunger Now. In addition, after the 2007 death of Kelly Jo Dowd, a former Hooters Girl, Hooters calendar cover girl and later restaurant general manager, Hooters began a campaign in support of breast cancer research, with awareness of the issue being spread through the Kelly Jo Dowd Fund. By 2010 the chain raised over $2 million for the cause.

In 2009, Hooters partnered with Operation Homefront to establish The Valentine Fund in honor of fallen soldier SOCS Thomas J. Valentine. The fund supports the families of US Special Forces service members and other military families. Thomas J. Valentine, a Navy SEAL Senior Chief Petty Officer, was killed during a training exercise February 13, 2008. He left behind his wife, Christina, and two young children. Hooters established a fund in Valentine&#x27;s name through Operation Homefront.

===Athletics and promotions===
Hooters is involved in the sports world. Previous sponsorships include the Miami Hooters, a now defunct Arena Football League team. Hooters formerly sponsored the USAR Hooters Pro Cup, an automobile racing series, and the NGA Pro Golf Tour, a minor league golf tour.

In 1992, Hooters sponsored NASCAR driver Alan Kulwicki as he won the Winston Cup Championship, beating Bill Elliott by ten points, the closest margin in NASCAR prior to The Chase era. On April 1, 1993, Kulwicki, along with several others including Hooters Chairman Bob Brooks&#x27; son Mark, were killed in a plane crash near Bristol, Tennessee. They were flying back to the track for Sunday&#x27;s race after making a sponsor appearance at a Hooters in Knoxville, Tennessee. Hooters remained in the sport, sponsoring drivers like Loy Allen Jr., Rick Mast and Brett Bodine before ending their involvement in 2003. The restaurant returned to NASCAR in 2007 to sponsor a Craftsman Truck Series team led by Jason White, Derrike Cope and Brad Keselowski. Six years later, Hooters sponsored Nationwide Series driver Nelson Piquet Jr.&#x27;s car. For the 2016 Bojangles&#x27; Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway, Hooters made a comeback in the Cup Series with a one-off paint scheme for Greg Biffle. Hooters most recently sponsored the No. 9 of Chase Elliott from 2017 to 2024.

Hooters has sponsored the Major League Eating-sanctioned &quot;Hooters Worldwide Wing Eating Championship&quot; since 2012. Hooters has also licensed its name for the &quot;Hooters Road Trip&quot; PlayStation racing game. Furthermore, Hooters licensed the Hooters Calendar for &quot;Hooters Calendar Girl&quot;, a mobile wallpaper application, and &quot;Hooters Calendar Girl Tubin&quot;&#x27;, a mobile game, both by Oasys Mobile. It was also one of several real world brands that appeared in the 2011 video game &quot;Homefront&quot;.

Since 1986, the restaurant has issued a calendar featuring Hooters Girls, with signings taking place in some of their restaurants. Since 1996, Hooters has held Miss Hooters International Swimsuit Pageant, a competition of Hooters Girls from around the world; in 2010, this event took place in Hollywood, Florida. An African-American woman won the Miss Hooters pageant for the first time in 2010: LeAngela Davis of Columbus, Ohio.

==Criticism==
Hooters has been criticized by feminists for objectifying women.

The Orange County National Organization for Women (NOW), as well as three other California chapters, filed a complaint against Hooters with several district attorneys in 2010. They criticized Hooters for “having it both ways” and operating as a “legal bait and switch” by simultaneously advertising itself as a “family restaurant” and allowing minors, while defending itself against charges of sex discrimination by claiming that the restaurant is based on female sex appeal. The complaint called on authorities to either force Hooters to stop admitting children onto the premises or stop sex discrimination in its hiring practices.

Several studies suggest that working at Hooters and other “breastaurants” takes a psychological toll on its employees, with higher levels of objectification being associated with lower job satisfaction, and higher levels of anxiety and eating disorders.

However, others have argued that feminism is about having a choice and that being able to work as a woman in whichever industry the individual woman in question chooses along with the ability for women to make their own money is empowering. Hooters in response to such criticism have said the company regularly donates to charities that help promote women&#x27;s entrepreneurship and often promote Hooters Girls to management positions. 40% of Hooters restaurants managers are reportedly female.

==Controversies==
===Legal history===
In 1997, three men from the Chicago area sued Hooters after being denied employment at an Orland Park, Illinois, restaurant. Each of them was awarded $19,100. Four men who filed a similar lawsuit in Maryland received $10,350 each. The settlement allows Hooters to continue gender-restricted hiring in its wait staff; the chain agreed to create other support jobs, like bartenders and hosts, that must be filled without regard to gender.

In 2000, a federal jury ordered Hooters to pay $275,000 to former waitress Sara Steinhoff, who claimed in her lawsuit that she was the target of unwanted sexual advances, demeaning behavior and recrimination from managers while she worked at the Hooters in Newport, Kentucky, between October 1996 and October 1997.

In 2001, a jury determined Hooters of Augusta Inc. willfully violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act by sending unsolicited advertising faxes. The class-action lawsuit, brought in June 1995 by Sam Nicholson, included 1,320 others who said they received the advertising faxes from Hooters. Atlanta-based Hooters of America Inc., the local restaurant&#x27;s parent company, paid out $11 million. The jury determined that six faxes were sent to each plaintiff. With a $500 fine for each, that amounts to a $3,000 award per plaintiff.

Also in 2001, Jodee Berry, a waitress at a Hooters in Panama City Beach, Florida, won a beer sales contest, for which the promised prize was a new Toyota automobile. However, the manager awarded her a &quot;toy Yoda&quot; instead, claiming the contest was an April Fool&#x27;s Day joke. Berry filed a lawsuit against Gulf Coast Wings, the local franchisee, and later reached a settlement.

In 2004, it was found that job applicants to a Hooters in West Covina, California, were secretly filmed while undressing, prompting a civil suit filed against the national restaurant chain in Los Angeles Superior Court. The company responded to the incident with additional employee training.

In 2009, Nikolai Grushevski, a man from Corpus Christi, Texas, filed a lawsuit because Hooters would not hire him as a waiter. Grushevski and Hooters reached a confidential settlement on April 13. In September 2009, the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed a lawsuit against a North Carolina charter airline (formerly Hooters Air, owned by Hooters of America) on behalf of Chau Nguyen, an Asian flight attendant fired three years prior after complaining only white workers were being promoted.

In May 2010, a lawsuit was filed against Hooters in Michigan after an employee was given a job performance review and was told that her shirt and short size could use some improvement by two women who held positions at the headquarters in Atlanta. Michigan is the only state that includes height and weight as bounds for non-discrimination in hiring. The plaintiff alleges that she was made the offer of a free gym membership and told that if she did not improve in 30 days, her employment would be terminated. The company denied that they threatened to fire the plaintiffs, and the suit was settled out of court.

In 2011, a number of former Hooters executives left to start the Twin Peaks franchise group. Hooters filed suit and alleged that former Hooters executives stole trade secrets and management documents as part as their move to the new restaurant chain.

In 2012, former employee Jheri Stratton filed suit after catching tuberculosis from one of her managers.

Also in 2012, Kisuk Cha, a Korean American immigrant who placed a takeout order at a Hooters in Queens, New York, sued the restaurant chain for racial discrimination after noticing a racial slur printed on a cash register receipt by a hostess who later confessed and subsequently resigned. The case was dismissed in 2013.

On April 2, 2015, former employee Farryn Johnson was awarded $250,000 after an arbitrator found that racial discrimination contributed to her termination. Johnson was terminated in August 2013 after her store manager (from the Hooters in Baltimore, Maryland) told her that she could not have blonde highlights in her hair. Johnson filed a civil rights complaint with the State of Maryland Civil Rights Division where her attorneys stated the applicability of the dress code for Black Americans and everyone else (e.g. non-Hispanic Whites, Hispanic/Latino, Asian/Pacific Islander American) where one set of policies pertains to a certain group of people was considered as racial discrimination. A statement from Hooters of America by Ericka Whitaker (Hooters of America senior brand manager) stated that she had no issue of having blonde highlights as a Hooters Girl prior to becoming a brand manager and the company will continue to diversify its employees, from the restaurant to the annual Hooters International Swimsuit Pageant.

On September 11, 2017, former Philadelphia-area Hooters waitress Jade Velez filed a lawsuit against Hooters alleging she was a victim of workplace sexual assault by a former kitchen employee. The lawsuit named the employee, three former managers at the Northeast Philadelphia Hooters restaurant where she worked, and &quot;Hooters of America, LLC et al&quot; as defendants. As of July 2020, the outcome of the case was still pending.

On July 16, 2019, Scott Peterson, who was one of two men who alleged they were sexually harassed by a male boss while working for Hooters in the Los Angeles area, reached a settlement with the restaurant chain in the Los Angeles Superior Court, though terms of the settlement were not publicly revealed. The other plaintiff, Paul &quot;PJ&quot; Cagnina, obtained a settlement in May 2017.

On August 22, 2024, Hendrick Motorsports of NASCAR announced that they would sue Hooters for unpaid sponsorship fees.

===Legal status===
In employment discrimination law in the United States, employers are generally allowed to consider characteristics that would otherwise be discriminatory if they are &quot;bona fide&quot; occupational qualifications (BFOQ). For example, a manufacturer of men&#x27;s clothing may lawfully advertise exclusively for male models. Hooters has argued a BFOQ defense, which applies when the &quot;essence of the business operation would be undermined if the business eliminated its discriminatory policy&quot;.

<doc id="673245" wikidata="Q11103025" url="?curid=673245" title="Christina River">
<text>The Christina River is a tributary of the Delaware River, approximately 35 miles (56 km) long, in northern Delaware. It also flows through small areas of southeastern Pennsylvania and northeastern Maryland. Near its mouth, the river flows past downtown Wilmington, Delaware, forming the city&#x27;s harbor for traffic on the Delaware River. The Port of Wilmington, opened in 1923 at the river&#x27;s mouth, handles international cargo and trade.

The river rises in southeastern Pennsylvania in Franklin Township in southern Chester County, and initially flows southeastwardly, passing through the northeastern extremity of Maryland in northeastern Cecil County, into New Castle County in Delaware, where it flows through western and southern areas of the city of Newark and then turns northeastwardly, passing the town of Newport and approaching Wilmington from the southwest. It receives White Clay Creek from the west near Newport, and Brandywine Creek in Wilmington, approximately 2 miles (3 km) upstream of its mouth.
The Christina River and its tributaries drain an area of . Brandywine Creek, despite being a tributary of the Christina, drains 58% of this area (). White Clay Creek and its tributary, Red Clay Creek, drain a further 28% of the basin (). Including Brandywine Creek, 71% of the Christina&#x27;s basin is in Pennsylvania (); 28% is in Delaware (); and 1% is in Maryland (). The basin&#x27;s streams supply approximately 100 million gallons (400 million liters) of water per day for more than half a million people in the three states, providing 75% of the water supply for New Castle County, Delaware, and more than 40% of the water supply for Chester County, Pennsylvania.

The river was named for Queen Christina of Sweden. Fort Christina, the first permanent European settlement in Delaware, was established at the confluence of Brandywine Creek and the Christina River in 1638 as a part of the Swedish colony of New Sweden. The fort was captured by the Dutch in 1655, and by the English in 1664.

Many rowing teams and clubs in Wilmington practice along the Christina River, among them the Wilmington Youth Rowing Association, Wilmington rowing association, Newport Rowing Club, and University of Delaware. In addition, there is a fall &quot;head race&quot; occurring on the river by the name of the Head of the Christina held every year in the boat house of Wilmington youth rowing association.

Just south of downtown Wilmington, the Christina provides home port to the &quot;Kalmar Nyckel&quot;, Delaware&#x27;s official Tall Ship. Co-located with the Kalmar Nyckel is the home port to the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary&#x27;s Search and Rescue Detachment (SARDET) Wilmington.

The Christina River is also one of many Striped Bass spawning areas that empty into the Delaware River.

The Christina Riverwalk makes up a segment of the East Coast Greenway, a 3,000 mile long system of trails connecting Maine to Florida.

<text>Charles Martel (; 8 September 1271 – 12 August 1295) of the Capetian dynasty was the eldest son of king Charles II of Naples and Mary of Hungary, the daughter of King Stephen V of Hungary.

The 18-year-old Charles Martel was set up by Pope Nicholas IV and the ecclesiastical party as the titular King of Hungary (1290–1295) as the successor of his maternal uncle, the childless Ladislaus IV of Hungary against whom the Pope had already earlier declared a crusade.

He never managed to govern the Kingdom of Hungary, where an agnate of the Árpád dynasty, his cousin Andrew III of Hungary ruled at that time. Charles Martel was, however, successful in asserting his claim in the Kingdom of Croatia, then in personal union with Hungary.

Charles Martel died of the plague in Naples. His son, Charles (or Charles Robert), later succeeded in winning the throne of Hungary.

Charles was known personally to Dante: in the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, the poet speaks warmly of and to Charles&#x27;s spirit when they meet in the Heaven of Venus (in &quot;Paradiso&quot; VIII–IX).

==Family==
He married Clemence of Habsburg (d. 1295), daughter of Rudolph I, King of Germany.

They had three children:
* Charles I of Hungary (1288–1342), King of Hungary
* Beatrix (1290–1354, Grenoble), married on 25 May 1296 Jean II de La Tour du Pin, Dauphin du Viennois
* Clementia (February 1293 – 12 October 1328, Paris), married near Troyes on 31 August 1315 Louis X of France

<doc id="673256" wikidata="Q1149800" url="?curid=673256" title="Black Knight (Marvel Comics)">
<text>The Black Knight is the alias of several fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

The first is a medieval knight created by writer Stan Lee and artist Joe Maneely, who made his first appearance in &quot;Black Knight&quot; #1 (May 1955), during the Silver Age of Comics, when Marvel Comics was previously known as Atlas Comics. The second is a supervillain descendant of the original, created by Lee and artist and co-plotter Dick Ayers, who first appeared in &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; #52 (Feb. 1964). The third, created by writer Roy Thomas, production editor John Verpoorten, and artist George Tuska, is the villain&#x27;s nephew, a superhero and a member of the superhero team the Avengers, who first appeared in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #47 (Dec. 1967). A fourth Black Knight with no revealed genetic connection debuted in &quot;The Black Panther&quot; #3 (June 2005), created by writer Reginald Hudlin and penciler John Romita Jr. A fifth, Jackie Chopra, was revealed to be the daughter of Dane Whitman.

Dane Whitman appears in the live-action Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Eternals&quot; (2021), portrayed by Kit Harington.

==Publication history==
Marvel Comics&#x27; first Black Knight, Sir Percy of Scandia, first appeared in the medieval-adventure series &quot;Black Knight&quot; #1–5 (cover-dated May 1955–April 1956) from Atlas Comics, the 1950s precursor to Marvel Comics.

Sir Percy&#x27;s descendant, Professor Nathan Garrett, debuted as the modern-day supervillain Black Knight in &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; #52 (Feb. 1964). This villainous Black Knight appeared in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #6, #14–15 (July 1964, March–April 1965), and in the feature &quot;Iron Man&quot; in &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot; #73 (Jan. 1966), in which he was mortally wounded.

Dane Whitman, Garrett&#x27;s nephew, made his first appearance in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #47 (Dec. 1967) and became a heroic version of the Black Knight in the subsequent issue. Whitman sporadically appeared with the Avengers until becoming a core member, regularly appearing in #252–300 (1985–1989) and #329–375 (1991–1994).

The Gatherers storyline running through &quot;The Avengers&quot; #343–375 (1992–1994) placed the spotlight on the Black Knight, as the book&#x27;s focus turned toward his tumultuous relationship with the Eternal Sersi and mysterious connection to the other-dimensional villain Proctor. Whitman later starred in Malibu Comics&#x27; &quot;UltraForce&quot; #8–10 (1995) and &quot;UltraForce vol. 2&quot; #1–12 (1995–1996), leading a new team of heroes on a parallel world. Returning to the Marvel Universe proper, Whitman appeared in &quot;Heroes for Hire&quot; #1–16 (1997–1998) and, later, &quot;Captain Britain and MI13&quot; #1–15 (2008–2009). The Black Knight has yet to return to the Avengers, the team with which the character is most closely associated. In 2015, as part of All-New All-Different, a solo series was launched featuring Dane Whitman; however, it was canceled after 5 issues due to low sales.

Whitman and Sir Percy also starred in the limited series &quot;Black Knight&quot; #1–4 (June–Sept. 1990), written by Roy and Dann Thomas and drawn by successive pencillers Tony DeZuniga and Rich Buckler. In 1995, Percy had a cameo in &quot;Namor&quot; #60 as part of the Atlantis Rising story. Whitman and Sersi then headlined the one-shot &quot;Black Knight: Exodus&quot; (Dec. 1996), written by Ben Raab and illustrated by Jimmy Cheung and Andy Lanning. Another Black Knight one-shot starring Sir Percy, written by Thomas and illustrated by Tom Grummett and Scott Hanna, was published as &quot;Mystic Arcana: Black Knight&quot; #1 (Sept. 2007), the second of four &quot;Mystic Arcana&quot; one-shot issues.

==Fictional character biographies==
===Sir Percy of Scandia===
The original Black Knight is Sir Percy of Scandia, a 6th-century knight who serves at the court of King Arthur as his greatest warrior. Recruited by the wizard Merlin, Percy adopts a double identity, and pretends to be very incompetent until changing into the persona of the Black Knight. As the Black Knight, Percy wields the Ebony Blade, which Merlin forged from a meteorite. A constant foe of the evil knight Mordred the Evil (Arthur&#x27;s traitorous nephew), Percy is eventually killed by him during the fall of Camelot when stabbed from behind with an enchanted blade – although Mordred then dies himself of wounds inflicted by Arthur. Merlin ensures that Percy&#x27;s spirit will live on by casting a spell that will revive his ghost if Mordred should ever return. Percy&#x27;s spirit has appeared several times to counsel his descendant, Dane Whitman.

===Nathan Garrett===
Biologist Professor Nathan Garrett is the direct descendant of Sir Percy (although it has been implied Percy&#x27;s nephew Raston inherited the blade), and found Sir Percy&#x27;s tomb and the Ebony Blade. Garrett&#x27;s evil tendencies make him unworthy of wielding the sword, and Sir Percy’s ghost shuns him. An embittered Garrett then devises an arsenal of medieval weapons that employ modern technology and has genetic engineers create a winged horse that he names Aragorn. Calling himself the Black Knight, Garrett embarks on a life of crime to spite his ancestor. After a battle with the hero Giant-Man Garrett joins the supervillain team the Masters of Evil at the request of master villain Baron Zemo and like the others spreads Adhesive X over the city, but is first defeated by Thor. After two unsuccessful battles with the Avengers, the second time of which he was broken out of jail by Enchantress, he battled Iron Man due to Doctor Doom&#x27;s mind-control machine (which made supervillains attack Mister Fantastic&#x27;s and the Invisible Woman&#x27;s wedding, which the affected villains subsequently forget due to a machine created by Mister Fantastic). Garrett is mortally wounded falling from Aragorn while trying to kill Iron Man. A dying Garrett reveals his secret identity to his nephew, Dane Whitman, and repents for his life of crime. Whitman then adopts the identity of the Black Knight himself.

===Dane Whitman===
Dane Whitman is the Black Knight who has been a longtime member of the Avengers as well as a member of the Defenders, Ultraforce, Heroes for Hire, and MI: 13. Using his uncle&#x27;s notes, Whitman wielded the same equipment and created his own Aragorn.

===Augustine du Lac===
A Vatican Black Knight named Augustine du Lac received the Ebony Blade after Vatican agents retrieved it from an Iraqi vampire nest. In addition, Augustine created his own Aragorn. He is a member of a team of supervillains that invades the African nation of Wakanda. A devout Catholic, du Lac hopes to convert the populace to Catholicism. Black Panther takes the Ebony Blade and defeats him. Augustine&#x27;s Aragorn was later captured by Alyosha Kravinoff and killed for food.

===Female Black Knight===
A teenage female Black Knight later appears in the &quot;Vengeance&quot; limited series as a member of the Young Masters. Like Garrett, this incarnation is a villain and appears to possess the Ebony Blade. How she came into possession of the sword and what happened to Augustine has yet to be revealed. She was with the Young Masters when they were at an abandoned HYDRA base in Pennsylvania. While inspecting Bullseye&#x27;s corpse, they were attacked by Lady Bullseye. Later targeting Doctor Octopus for &quot;execution&quot;, the Young Masters found themselves battling the Sinister Six while being assisted by the Teen Brigade, with Black Knight being assisted in taking down Sandman by Teen Brigade member Ultimate Nullifier. While visiting a nightclub, Black Knight encountered Ultimate Nullifier at the time when the Young Masters plotted to recruit a reborn Loki to their side. In the morning, Black Knight showed Ultimate Nullifier a letter that spurred the Young Masters on their quest to kill older villains along with a CIA file discussing genocide on Russian prisoners carried out by Red Skull in World War II Poland. Informing Ultimate Nullifier that she was going to leave the Young Masters and had plans that did not involve evil, she left the Young Masters&#x27; base leaving behind the CIA file for Nullifier.

Black Knight was later seen with the Young Masters where they are seen as members of the Shadow Council&#x27;s Masters of Evil, which is led by Baron Helmut Zemo following Max Fury&#x27;s death.

===Jacks Chopra===
Jackie &quot;Jacks&quot; Chopra - Dane Whitman&#x27;s previously unknown daughter and an Arthurian history buff who shares the Black Knight mantle and the Ebony Blade with her father so that burden of doing so would not be handled alone.

==The Black Knight lineage==
Nathan Garrett and Dane Whitman are part of a lineage of Black Knights stretching back to the 6th century. In &quot;New Excalibur&quot; #10, the first part of the &quot;Last Day of Camelot&quot; storyline, it is revealed that Dane has turned Garrett Castle into a Black Knight museum with various exhibits on the Black Knights, including the body of Sir Percy. There is a long line of paintings of the Knights including, according to the curator, &quot;Sir Ralston[&quot;sic&quot;] and Sir Eobar or lesser known knights like Sir William and Sir Henry.&quot;

These Black Knights are:

* Sir Raston (&quot;Ralston&quot; appears only in &quot;New Excalibur&quot; #10) – Sir Percy&#x27;s nephew, who became the Black Knight after him. He lived in the Dark Ages, but was recruited into the Anachronauts by Kang the Conqueror and travelled through time.
* Sir Eobar of Garrington – He was the Black Knight during the Crusades.
* Sir William – He is depicted fighting in the trenches of World War I.
* Sir Henry – He is depicted as a swashbuckling figure.

Later in &quot;The Last Days of Camelot&quot;, Sir Percy reveals to Dane that he was not the first Black Knight and that eight knights had carried the Ebony Blade before him, the last being King Arthur&#x27;s cousin Sir Reginald. Each one had been driven mad by the sword and had to be killed until it was decided there were only three people who could take the sword, but King Arthur and Merlin were needed in other capacities, so the &quot;burden&quot; fell to Sir Percy who accepted despite knowing the risks.

The apparent &quot;Last Knight&quot; is Ernst Wythim, a member of the lineage from around 2600 AD.

==Ebony Blade==
===History===
The Ebony Blade was created by comic book writer Stan Lee in &quot;Black Knight Comics&quot; #1, published under Atlas Comics in 1955. Its history was later revealed in &quot;Marvel Super-Heroes&quot; #17 (Nov 1968), written by Roy Thomas. The blade was shown to have been carved from a meteor and enchanted by the wizard Merlin for Sir Percy of Scandia, the first Black Knight. Due to all the blood that Sir Percy shed with the blade, it acquired a curse (see below). The sword passed down through the generations until it came to Sir Percy&#x27;s descendant Dane Whitman. Dane used the blade for many years. It passed briefly to Valkyrie when Dane&#x27;s body was turned to stone and his soul sent back in time to the 13th century, but it was soon returned to him. Due to the curse, Dane eventually gave up the Ebony Blade by driving it deep into the same meteor that it was forged from, now kept in his castle. Only another deemed worthy would be able to withdraw it.

Sean Dolan, Dane&#x27;s ex-squire, was able to draw the blade during an attack on Whitman&#x27;s castle. This transformed Dolan into Bloodwraith. Dolan fought with the curse and was able to give up the sword for a brief time. During this time, it was trapped in the Negative Zone barrier outside of Attilan. In the meantime, a second Ebony Blade had been brought into this dimension by Proctor, an alternate reality version of Dane. When Proctor was killed, his blade was taken into Avengers custody.

Dolan was drawn to this second Blade, and once again became Bloodwraith. Crystal retrieved the original Blade, and The Vision threatened to destroy it if Bloodwraith did not surrender. Bloodwraith tossed the alternate Blade aside and reclaimed his own. Crystal picked up the second Blade and said it would be important to the future of the Inhumans. Bloodwraith was last known to have the Blade in his possession in Slorenia, where he was trapped by the Scarlet Witch.

At some point Dracula replaced Dane Whitman&#x27;s blade with a fake one (see below), and the real Blade came to be in Iraq and was secured by the Vatican after it was found by Opus Dei in a purging of a vampire nest. The Vatican sent a new Black Knight assassin (Augustine du Lac) to kill Black Panther, who took it from the Knight for his own uses. Black Panther used the blade in several battles, including the Skrull invasion.

Upon learning the blade was fake for a second time, Dane Whitman retrieved the real blade from Black Panther&#x27;s Wakandan nation where he was presented it by Queen Ororo T&#x27;Challa.

During &quot;War of the Realms&quot; event when Malekith attacked Black Knight, Union Jack, and Spitfire, he acquired the Ebony Blade and was ready to kill them until the War Avengers arrived.

It comes to light in &quot;King in Black&quot; that the wizard Merlin had lied about how a wielder uses the cursed sword. Knull, primordial dark god of all symbiotes, revealed it only gives its true power to those who prove to be the most &quot;baneful&quot; and hate-filled of individuals, not those who are pure in body and mind; it takes one who is able to come to grips with their own faults and push on despite them to utilize what the evil deity described as &quot;World Ender&quot;.

The sword also gives its users a state of resurrective immortality wherein if the wielder were to fall in battle, a blood offering of sorts can be used to restore them to life.

===Powers and abilities===
The Ebony Blade is a powerful enchanted weapon. It is said to be indestructible, and only the extremely powerful Iron Ogre, a magic creature, could split it in half. The blade has many mystical or quasi-mystical capabilities, including the ability to:

* Shear through any physical substance with the exception of other enchanted weapons and extremely strong metals like adamantium.
* Cleaves mystical barriers.
* Deflect energy when angled correctly.
* Absorb all forms of energy, including the Promethean Flame.
* Grants retroactive immortality.
* Manifests shadowed armor in a similar manner to a Klyntar.
* Discharges force of its own.
* Can absorb souls to make itself stronger.
* Bypass intangibility.
* Wispy armor enables wielders to fly.
* Protection from mysticism.
* Bestows an incredible healing factor.

Dane Whitman discovered most of these abilities through scientific testing of the Blade. Additionally, the Blade bonds to its wielder in such a way that the wielder can summon it back to himself or herself using a mystical ceremony if it is ever lost, even if it is in a different time period. The Blade cannot be used against its owner, as seen when Caden Tar tries to use it to kill Dane Whitman, but cannot pierce his skin. The Blade formerly rendered its wielder invulnerable to everything except another weapon carved from the same meteor, such as the Ebony Dagger.

Other notable wielders of the Blade include Whitman&#x27;s ancestors Sir Percy of Scandia, Eobar Garrington, Valkyrie, and Ares.

===Curses and influences===
The Ebony Blade was afflicted with a blood curse due to all the blood the original Black Knight had spilled. Dane Whitman eventually purged the Blade of its curse at Doctor Strange&#x27;s behest by plunging it into the Brazier of Truth while Strange bathed them both in magic fire. The curse returned, however, when the Sub-Mariner used it to kill his wife Marrina. The curse seems to affect different people in different ways. It turned Dane into a statue, it amplified Proctor&#x27;s &quot;gann&#x27;josin&quot;-based powers, and it granted Sean Dolan great physical powers as Bloodwraith.

The Blade was sometimes known to subtly compel Dane to do things or go places that were tied to its previous wielders, as well. It was revealed by the symbiote god Knull that its power relies on the curse. As it thrives on the negative proclivities of flawed and imperfect wielders to maximize on its inherent power. Something that only the unworthy can utilize as its edge dulls when wielded by a chivalrous soul.

===Fake Ebony Blade===
On occasion, the Ebony Blade appears in two separate comic series simultaneously, most notably in 2006 when it was in use by Dane Whitman (Black Knight) in the &quot;New Excalibur&quot; series whilst it was in use in a &quot;Black Panther&quot; ongoing by another Black Knight and subsequently Black Panther.

In a 2006 interview, when addressing a question about the confusion of the Ebony Blades appearing in two comics, Marvel Comics&#x27; editor Nick Lowe had this response:

At the end of those issues no full explanation was given. Whitman was shown to have sensed that his Ebony Blade was not the real one and left to find the original, then being used by Black Panther. Though both Captain Britain and Pete Wisdom knew the location of the real blade, Whitman had somehow forgotten it was fake during his next comic appearance in &quot;Captain Britain and MI-13&quot; #1.

Writer Paul Cornell revealed a full explanation within the Captain Britain series, having Dracula replace Dane Whitman&#x27;s blade with a fake version at some point between &quot;The Avengers&quot; vol. 3 #37 and &quot;New Excalibur&quot; #10. This fake blade has a vampire fang within it, which has shown some signs of sentience as people have talked to the blade directly. This mystical sentience has acted in the same fashion as the original&#x27;s curse; convincingly enough to fool Whitman. Even after Whitman first realized it was fake in &quot;New Excalibur&quot;, it affected his memories so that he forgot, meaning he thought he held the real one by the time of &quot;Captain Britain and MI-13&quot;.

Upon learning that the blade was fake for the second time in #7 of that series, Whitman retrieved the real blade from Black Panther&#x27;s Wakandan nation where he was presented it by Queen Ororo T&#x27;Challa.

* A zombified alternate universe variant of Dane Whitman / Black Knight makes a minor appearance in the Marvel Zombies tie-in one-shot &quot;Marvel Zombies: Dead Days&quot;.

<text>Something About Airplanes is the debut studio album by indie rock band Death Cab for Cutie, released August 18, 1998, on Barsuk Records. A tenth-anniversary edition of the album was released November 25, 2008, featuring redesigned artwork, liner notes by Sean Nelson, and a bonus disc including the band&#x27;s first ever Seattle performance at the Crocodile Cafe in February 1998.

Early recordings of five songs from the album can be found on the &quot;You Can Play These Songs with Chords&quot; compilation.

==Background==
&quot;Airplanes&quot; was created at the group&#x27;s rented house off of Ellis Street in Bellingham. It was recorded on a reel-to-reel eight-track recorder. With Walla&#x27;s bedroom in the attic, the band inserted a microphone through a hole in the floor to the living room where vocals were tracked. Gibbard&#x27;s writing was primarily influenced by Idaho indie rockers Built to Spill; in an interview with &quot;Vice&quot;, he noted that &quot;Perfect from Now On&quot;, the band&#x27;s 1997 opus, was &quot;the only thing I was listening to at that point.&quot; He continued: &quot;There’s some flagrant Built to Spill ripoffs on that record. I was really influenced by Rex and Bedhead and a lot of these slower kinds of bands.&quot;

&quot;Airplanes&quot; was released through Barsuk and Elsinor Records, the label that issued the group&#x27;s debut cassette, &quot;You Can Play These Songs with Chords&quot;. They pressed an initial 1,000 copies of &quot;Airplanes&quot;, which Gibbard found confounding: &quot;We were imagining we were going to be carrying around boxes of our own records for the rest of our lives,&quot; he joked. For the album&#x27;s decade anniversary, Barsuk released an expanded edition of the LP, coupling it with a live concert the band performed at the Crocodile Cafe in 1998.

==Composition==
At the time of the album&#x27;s writing, Gibbard was just coming into his own as a songwriter. He had hoped to pen lyrics he considered &quot;wildly descriptive and very dense and interesting,&quot; but later felt its purported profundity reads as nonsensical. Likewise, his singing voice is slightly different than on later recordings, with an adenoidal nasal tone.

&quot;The Face That Launched 1000 Shits&quot; is a cover of an original song by The Revolutionary Hydra, a band that DCFC guitarist Chris Walla and lead singer/guitarist Ben Gibbard belonged to. The song was written by then-bandmate Jay Chilcote. The song’s title is a play on the phrase “The Face That Launched a Thousand Ships”, attributed to Helen of Troy whose supposed unmatched beauty led to the Trojan War (after Paris, Prince of Troy, kidnapped her from Sparta and her husband King Menelaus).

==Artwork==
Despite the title referring to airplanes, the image on the album cover is of a rowboat. The image is actually seen through a hole in the booklet cover and a sheet of vellum. Like some of the band&#x27;s 2000 releases, the text is set entirely in lower case.

==Reception==
An early review of the album from &quot;CMJ&quot; columnist Glen Sarvady wrote that the album &quot;has the aura of a young band still crafting its own voice, but working fertile ground and already producing some impressive results.&quot; Ian Cohen at Pitchfork writes the album &quot;create[s] a sonic blueprint that&#x27;s subtly innovative [...] &quot;Something About Airplanes&quot; instead sounds like a private affair, which is one reason it&#x27;s so treasured amongst diehards.&quot; Barry Walters at &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writes that &quot;Not every cut on their debut is that assured: Guitarist-producer Chris Walla hadn&#x27;t yet mastered the studio, and singer Ben Gibbard&#x27;s articulate moodiness isn&#x27;t consistently memorable.&quot;

Morgan Enos at &quot;Billboard&quot; launched a celebration of the album for its twentieth anniversary in 2018, writing, &quot;if you want to hear [Death Cab&#x27;s] sound in chrysalis, you can’t do much better than &quot;Airplanes&quot;. The album embraces a homespun, basement vibe, but the lyrics prove that Gibbard essentially came out as a perceptive, nuanced writer fully-formed — and with a band that could bring his songs to the light.&quot; Similarly, KEXP ran a piece in commemoration, with writer Dusty Henry commenting: &quot;&quot;Airplanes&quot; [is] such a fascinating and thrilling listen in the Death Cab canon. It&#x27;s not a benchmark for the band to be measured against. It&#x27;s a mystery covered in other mysteries [... the] murkiest entry in the band’s catalog. A twisted knot of wobbly guitars and banging drums held together by Gibbard&#x27;s most obtuse poetry.&quot;

<text>Hendrik van Gent (14 September 1899, Pernis – March 29, 1947, Amsterdam) was a Dutch astronomer.

He moved to South Africa in 1928 in order to observe the southern sky at the Leiden Southern Station and the Union Observatory in Johannesburg. He obtained his PhD from Leiden University in 1931. He studied variable stars and also discovered three comets, namely C/1941 K1, C/1944 K2 and C/1943 W1. The Minor Planet Center credits him with the discovery of 39 numbered minor planets during 1929–1935.

He died of a heart attack at the age of 47 while on leave in the Netherlands. The crater &quot;Van Gent&quot; on the far side of the Moon, and the asteroid 1666 van Gent are named after him.

<doc id="673274" wikidata="Q224647" url="?curid=673274" title="The Devil's Advocate (1997 film)">
<text>The Devil&#x27;s Advocate (marketed as Devil&#x27;s Advocate) is a 1997 American supernatural horror film directed by Taylor Hackford, written by Jonathan Lemkin and Tony Gilroy, and starring Keanu Reeves, Al Pacino and Charlize Theron. Based on Andrew Neiderman&#x27;s 1990 novel, it is about a gifted young Florida lawyer invited to work for a major New York City law firm. As his wife becomes haunted by frightening visions, the lawyer slowly realizes that the firm&#x27;s owner John Milton is the Devil.

The name John Milton is one of several allusions to &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, as well as to Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot; and the legend of Faust. An adaptation of Neiderman&#x27;s novel went into a development hell during the 1990s, with Hackford gaining control of the production. Filming took place around New York City and Florida.

&quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot; received mixed reviews, with critics crediting it for entertainment value and Pacino&#x27;s performance. It grossed $153 million at the box office and won the Saturn Award for Best Horror Film. It also became the subject of the copyright lawsuit &quot;Hart v. Warner Bros., Inc.&quot; for its visual art.

==Plot==
Kevin Lomax is a Gainesville, Florida, defense attorney who has never lost a case. While defending schoolteacher Lloyd Gettys against a charge of child molestation, he realizes that his client is guilty. Nevertheless, Kevin proceeds with his defense, destroying the victim&#x27;s credibility through a harsh cross-examination and securing an acquittal for Gettys.

A New York City law firm asks Kevin to assist them with a jury selection. After the jury delivers a not-guilty verdict, the head of the firm, John Milton, offers Kevin a job, which he accepts. Kevin and his wife Mary Ann move to Manhattan. Kevin is soon working long hours and neglecting Mary Ann. Kevin&#x27;s Christian fundamentalist mother Alice, whose only sex was to conceive Kevin, urges the couple to return to Florida after meeting Milton. Kevin refuses.

Kevin is assigned to represent billionaire Alex Cullen, who is accused of murdering his wife, his stepson and a maid. As a result, Kevin sees even less of Mary Ann and fantasizes about his co-worker Christabella. Meanwhile, Mary Ann has visions of the partners&#x27; wives becoming demonic, and has a nightmare about a baby playing with her removed ovaries. After a doctor declares Mary Ann to be infertile, she begs Kevin that they return to Gainesville, but he refuses. Milton suggests that Kevin step down from the trial to care for Mary Ann, but Kevin thinks that he will resent her for costing the case for the firm.

Eddie Barzoon, the firm&#x27;s managing partner, discovers Kevin&#x27;s name on the firm&#x27;s charter and believes that Kevin covets his job. Eddie threatens to inform the United States Attorney&#x27;s office of the firm&#x27;s dubious activities, and Kevin tells Milton. Although Milton seems to dismiss Kevin&#x27;s concerns, Eddie is beaten to death in Central Park.

Preparing Melissa Black, Alex Cullen&#x27;s secretary, to testify, Kevin realizes that she is lying to give Cullen a false alibi. He tells Milton that he thinks Alex is guilty, but Milton offers to support him anyway. Kevin proceeds, winning an acquittal with Melissa&#x27;s perjured testimony. Afterward, Kevin finds Mary Ann in a nearby church covered with a blanket. She claims that Milton raped her that day, and shows Kevin her body covered with cuts and scratches. Knowing that Milton was in court with him, Kevin believes that she must have injured herself and admits her into a mental institution.

United States Department of Justice agent Mitch Weaver, who is investigating the clandestine activities of Milton&#x27;s firm, warns Kevin that Milton is corrupt, and also reveals that Gettys, acquitted in Florida, has been arrested for killing a little girl. Moments later, Weaver is struck by a car and killed. At the same time, while attending Eddie&#x27;s funeral service, Milton sticks his finger into holy water and makes it boil.

Kevin, his mother Alice, and his case manager, Pam Garrety, visit Mary Ann at the institution. Envisioning Pam as a demon, Mary Ann hits her, barricades the room and kills herself. Alice reveals that Milton is Kevin&#x27;s father. Kevin leaves the hospital to confront Milton, who admits to raping Mary Ann. Kevin shoots Milton, but the bullets do not harm him. Milton reveals that he is Satan.

Kevin blames Milton for everything that happened, but Milton points out that he merely &quot;set the stage&quot;. It was Kevin who chose to neglect his wife and defend people who he knew were guilty. Kevin realizes that he always wanted to win, regardless of the cost. Christabella appears; Milton announces that he wants Kevin and Christabella (Kevin&#x27;s half-sister) to conceive the Antichrist. Kevin initially appears to acquiesce but abruptly shoots himself in the head. Milton&#x27;s demonic rage burns Christabella alive, revealing his demonic form before turning into a winged angel that resembles Kevin.

Suddenly, Kevin is again at the Gainesville courthouse during the recess of the Gettys trial. The entire experience was a vision. Kevin returns to the courtroom and sees that Mary Ann is alive and well. When the trial resumes, Kevin announces that he cannot represent his client, despite the risk of disbarment. Kevin&#x27;s reporter friend Larry offers to do a high-profile interview with him, promising to make him famous. Encouraged by Mary Ann, Kevin agrees.

After they leave, Larry transforms into Milton, who breaks the fourth wall and declares, &quot;Vanity—definitely my favorite sin&quot;.

==Themes and interpretations==

The Devil character&#x27;s name is a direct homage to John Milton, who wrote &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, quoted by Lomax with the line, &quot;Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heav&#x27;n&quot;. Despite this, the thrust of Milton&#x27;s epic was to rebuke the devil. As a rebel against God, complaining of being perpetually &quot;underestimated&quot;, the Milton character, like &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;″s Satan, is &quot;&quot;Heav&#x27;n running from Heav&#x27;n&quot; with a &quot;sense of injur&#x27;d merit&quot;&quot;.

Professor Eric C. Brown judges the climax, in which Milton attempts to persuade Lomax to have sex with his half-sister to conceive the Antichrist, to be the most &quot;Miltonic&quot;, as the sculptures become animated in carnal activities evoking &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;″s &quot;Downfall of the Rebel Angels&quot;. The tirade that Milton gives in this sequence is also reminiscent of Satan&#x27;s lines in &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, Books I and II. In U.S. literary education, Milton&#x27;s temptation of Lomax in the climax, in which he rationalizes rebellion against God for a &quot;look-but-don&#x27;t-touch&quot; model, has been compared to Satan urging Eve to eat forbidden fruit in &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, Book IX, lines 720–730:

In his DVD commentary, Taylor Hackford did not name &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; as an inspiration, instead citing the legend of Faust. An underlying concept of the story is a &quot;Faustian bargain&quot;, offered to a character with free will. Philosopher Peter van Inwagen writes that Milton referring to free will as a &quot;bitch&quot; when Lomax contemplates selling his soul moves away from a legalistic definition of &quot;free will&quot; as &quot;uncoerced&quot; into the philosophical realm of its definition.

As with &quot;Goethe&#x27;s Faust&quot;, the Devil that is commonly depicted in cinema is associated with lust and temptation. Milton shows Lomax many seductive women to induce his &quot;fall&quot;. Sex or rape is usually also the means by which Satan creates the Antichrist, as in Roman Polanski&#x27;s 1968 film &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot;. In &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot;, someone other than Satan will have sex to conceive the Antichrist, although Milton nevertheless brutally rapes Mary Ann. Incest becomes a way of creating the Antichrist, for the offspring of Satan&#x27;s son and daughter will inherit much of Satan&#x27;s genetic makeup.

Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot; raised &quot;visual potential&quot; that informed the film. Dantean scholar Amilcare A. Iannucci argues that the plot follows the model of the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; in beginning with &quot;selva oscura&quot;, with Lomax losing his conscience defending a guilty man, and entering and exploring deeper circles of Hell.

Iannucci compares the office building structure to the circles, listing fireplaces where flames are always present; demonic visual phenomena; and water outside of Milton&#x27;s office, analogized to Dante&#x27;s Satan&#x27;s icy home, albeit situated at the top of Hell, as opposed to the bottom. Free will is also a major theme in the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, with the film&#x27;s musings on the concept being similar to Dante&#x27;s &quot;Purgatorio&quot;, 16.82–83 (&quot;if the present world has gone astray, in you is the cause, in you it&#x27;s to be sought&quot;).

Other religious references are present. In describing New York City as Babylon, Alice Lomax invokes Revelation 18:

Milton tempting Lomax is also possibly inspired by the Biblical Temptation of Christ. Aside from Milton, other character names have been commented on: Author Kelly J. Wyman matches Mary Ann, the virginal figure who falls victim to Milton, to the Virgin Mary, and adds the literal translation of Christabella is &quot;Beautiful Christ&quot;, and that the title refers to the Catholic Church&#x27;s Devil&#x27;s advocates and lawyers as advocates; Eric C. Brown finds Barzoon&#x27;s name and character to be reminiscent of the demon prince Beelzebub. Scholars Miguel A. De La Torre and Albert Hernández observe the vision of Satan as CEO, wearing expensive clothing and engaging in business, had appeared in popular culture before, including the 1942 novel &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot;.

==Production==
===Development===

Andrew Neiderman wrote &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot; as a novel, and it was published in 1990 by Simon and Schuster. Believing that his story could be adapted into a film, Neiderman approached Warner Bros. and claimed to have led his successful sale with the synopsis, &quot;It&#x27;s about a law firm in New York that represents only guilty people, and never loses&quot;.

Various screenplay adaptations of &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot; had been pitched to U.S. cinema studios, with Joel Schumacher planned to direct it, with Brad Pitt as the young lawyer. Schumacher planned a sequence in which Pitt would descend into the New York subway system that would be modeled on the circles of hell in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. With no actor to play Satan, this project collapsed.

The O.J. Simpson murder trial and its controversial outcome gave new impetus to relaunching the project, with a $60 million budget. Warner Bros. hired Taylor Hackford to direct the new attempt. The director embraced the legal drama aspect, theorizing, &quot;The courtroom has become the gladiator arena of the late twentieth century. Following the progress of a sensational trial is a spectator sport.&quot;

Tony Gilroy led much of the rewrite with supervision by Hackford, who envisioned it as &quot;a modern-day morality play&quot; and &quot;Faustian tale&quot;. As the screenplay developed, free-will became a theme in which Milton does not actually cause events. Hackford wanted suggestions that Milton does not kill Barzoon as he defied his muggers, or United States Attorney Weaver, who arrogantly did not watch for vehicles before stepping onto the road.

The screenwriters added the plot element that Lomax was Milton&#x27;s son, and that Milton could produce the Antichrist, neither of which are in the novel. Hackford cited the films &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; and &quot;The Omen&quot; as influences, and both had explored the Antichrist mythology. Another change from the novel was converting the book&#x27;s lesbian client to the pedophile Lloyd Gettys, avoiding undertones of homophobia. In an early version of the screenplay, the &quot;better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven&quot; quotation is given to Milton rather than Lomax.

===Casting===
Al Pacino had previously been offered the role of the Devil in an attempt to adapt Neiderman&#x27;s novel, but before final rewrites, he rejected it on three occasions because of the clichéd nature of the character. Pacino suggested Robert Redford and Sean Connery for the role. Keanu Reeves chose to star in &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot; instead of &quot;Speed 2&quot;, despite a promised $11 million for the sequel to his 1994 hit &quot;Speed.&quot; According to Reeves&#x27;s staff, the actor was averse to performing in two consecutive action films after &quot;Chain Reaction&quot; (1996). On &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot;, Reeves agreed to a pay cut worth millions of dollars so that the producers could meet Pacino&#x27;s salary demands. To prepare for the role, Pacino watched the 1941 film &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster&quot; and observed tips from Walter Huston as Mr. Scratch. He also read Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot; and &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;.

Connie Nielsen, a Danish actress, was selected by Hackford for Christabella, who speaks several languages, with Hackford asserting that Nielsen already spoke multiple languages. Craig T. Nelson was cast against type in a villainous role.

===Filming===

Principal photography began in New York in 1996, but struggled by November. Delays were caused by the dismissals of the original cinematographer and assistant directors, while an anonymous source claimed that Pacino found Hackford to be conceited and loud. An executive alleged that Pacino was typically late to work, although producer Arnold Kopelson said that this was not the case. Hackford said that Pacino was professional, although his status meant that he did not need to be.

Production designer Bruno Rubeo was tasked to create Milton&#x27;s apartment, aiming for a &quot;very loose and very sexy&quot; appearance, &quot;so you can&#x27;t really tell where it goes&quot;. Hackford said on this set that he encouraged Reeves and Pacino to &quot;feel the room&quot; and develop some improvisation. Pacino came up with the idea of dancing to &quot;It Happened in Monterey&quot; by Frank Sinatra, and Hackford immediately adopted the idea.

When Lomax leaves to meet Milton, he walks on 57th Street in New York, abnormally devoid of people or vehicles. It was shot on the actual 57th Street, with the filmmakers having it emptied at 7:30 a.m. on a Sunday. The offices were shot at the Continental Club in Manhattan, and at the Continental Plaza, although the water outside of Milton&#x27;s office was added later by computer effects. In constructing the firm sets, Hackford and Rubeo consulted architects from Japan and Italy to craft an &quot;ultra-modern&quot; look, to display Milton&#x27;s taste. Donald Trump&#x27;s penthouse in Trump Tower, Fifth Avenue, was lent to the production for Alexander Cullen&#x27;s residence.

A number of churches and courts hosted production. The interior of New York City&#x27;s Church of the Heavenly Rest was used for the scene in which Theron&#x27;s character says that Milton raped her. The outside of Central Presbyterian Church was photographed for Barzoon&#x27;s funeral, while Pacino was inside the Manhattan Church of the Most Holy Redeemer for the holy water sequence. For court scenes, New Jersey&#x27;s Bergen County Court House was employed for production, as were historic courthouses in New York.

After the completion of the New York shoot in March 1997, production moved to Florida in July 1997. In Jacksonville, Florida, the interior of Mrs. Howard&#x27;s business in Riverside and Avondale was used for New York scenes. Its co-owner Jim Howard remodeled the store and appeared as an extra. The Gainesville church scenes were shot at a Gainesville church after Hackford persuaded the pastor and his members to participate, telling them that his story was about combating Satan.

Theron had to briefly leave the United States while filming because she was working illegally.&lt;ref name=&quot;contactmusic/1116156&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-production===
At the end of the film, John Milton morphs into Lucifer as a fallen angel. The crew created the effect by combining life masks depicting Reeves, Pacino in 1997 and Pacino as he appeared in the 1972 film &quot;The Godfather&quot;. &quot;The Godfather&quot; makeup artist Dick Smith supplied to &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot; artist Rick Baker, Smith&#x27;s former protégé, the life mask that he made in the 1970s. Additionally, Baker created images for demonic faces seen on real actresses and actors, with hands also appearing to move underneath Tamara Tunie&#x27;s skin, a digital creation with the contributions of Richard Greenberg and Stephanie Powell.

Shots of ballerinas moving in water were used as a basis for Milton&#x27;s animated sculpture. Special-effects producer Edward L. Williams said that he filmed the people for the statue effect, and that they were naked and placed in a tank next to a blue screen. It took three months to film the people and add the computer effects, at a cost of $2 million, which was 40% of the overall budget for special effects.

James Newton Howard, a past collaborator with Hackford, was tasked to write the score. Hackford dubbed Pacino&#x27;s performance of &quot;It Happened in Monterey&quot; with Sinatra&#x27;s voice. &quot;Paint It Black&quot; by The Rolling Stones is also used for the film&#x27;s conclusion.

==Release==
During early stages of photography, Warner Bros. aspired to a release in August 1997. The film eventually had its release on October 17, 1997, on the same day as another horror film, &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;. To promote the release, Warner Bros.&#x27;s website included the warning on Hell&#x27;s Gate from Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot; Canto III (&quot;Abandon every hope, ye who enter here&quot;), with credits presented as circles of Hell. The television advertizing and poster were upfront regarding Milton being Satan, although it is not explicitly revealed in the film until its later acts.

Approximately 475,000 copies of the VHS and DVD were produced by February 1998, but their release into the home-video market was delayed pending the &quot;Hart v. Warner Bros., Inc.&quot; lawsuit. Afterward, the film went into regular airings on TNT and TBS. In 2012, a Blu-ray edition was released in Region A as an &quot;Unrated Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;, in which the climax&#x27;s art that was previously subject to the lawsuit is digitally redone.

==Reception==
===Box office===
On its opening weekend in October 1997, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot; earned $12.2 million, finishing second in the U.S. box office to &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;, which made $16.1 million. &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot; was largely competing against thriller films aimed at youth in the Halloween season. By December 6, 1997, it grossed $56.1 million. It ended its run on February 12, 1998, with a gross of $61 million in North America and $92 million elsewhere.

===Critical response===

Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes assigned the film an approval rating of 63%, based on 62 reviews, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus states: &quot;Though it is ultimately somewhat undone by its own lofty ambitions, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot; is a mostly effective blend of supernatural thrills and character exploration.&quot; Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 60 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on a scale of A+ to F.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote, &quot;The movie never fully engaged me; my mind raced ahead of the plot, and the John Grisham stuff clashed with the &quot;Exorcist&quot; stuff.&quot;

In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin complimented the &quot;gratifyingly light touch&quot; of using John Milton&#x27;s name, and special effects with &quot;gimmicks well tethered to reality&quot;.

David Denby wrote in &quot;New York&quot; magazine that &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot; was &quot;preposterously entertaining&quot; and predicted that it would get viewers debating.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave it a B, with Owen Gleiberman declaring it &quot;at once silly, overwrought, and almost embarrassingly entertaining&quot;, and crediting Pacino for his performance. Gleiberman later declared that Pacino had won the magazine&#x27;s yearly award for Best Overacting.

&quot;Variety&quot;″s Todd McCarthy declared it &quot;fairly entertaining&quot;, displaying &quot;a nearly operatic sense of absurdity and excess&quot;.

Dave Kehr of &quot;New York Daily News&quot; also preferred Pacino over Reeves, assessing that &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot; as &quot;Faust&quot; moved to Manhattan, although disappointed that a &quot;witty undercurrent becomes an exaggerated moralism&quot;. Critic James Berardinelli wrote that it &quot;is a highly enjoyable motion picture that&#x27;s part character study, part supernatural thriller, and part morality play&quot;.

In &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, Michiko Kakutani objected to trivializing Satan, reducing &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; vision of the War in Heaven to &quot;an extended lawyer joke&quot;.

&quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;″s David Sterritt wrote that it is an unsurprising cinematic re-imagining of &quot;Faust&quot; with Satan a lawyer, but he recognized its message of &quot;the need for personal responsibility&quot;, albeit with &quot;more lascivious sex and shocking violence than a traditional &#x27;Faust&#x27; rendition&quot;.

In 2014, Yahoo! named &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot; as &quot;Pacino&#x27;s Most Underrated Film&quot;, claiming that &quot;Pacino&#x27;s hammy devil never got his due&quot;, but, &quot;there&#x27;s something to be said for an actor who can pull off this level of theatrics&quot;.

In his &quot;2015 Movie Guide&quot;, Leonard Maltin gives it three stars, finding Reeves credible and Pacino &quot;delicious&quot;.

Scott Mendelson wrote in &quot;Forbes&quot; in 2015, &quot;I love this trashy, vulgar, unapologetically puritan melodrama more than I care to admit.&quot;

In 2016, &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; reported on an online debate over the possible symbolism in the costume design, as Lomax appears in suits that are light in the beginning, becoming increasingly darker as his morality slips away. The counterpoint is that this merely reflects his increasing social status.

===Accolades===
The film won the Saturn Award for Best Horror Film. Pacino was also nominated for the MTV Movie Award for Best Villain.

==Legacy==
===Lawsuit===
The film was the subject of legal action in &quot;Hart v. Warner Bros., Inc.&quot; in 1997. The claim was that the sculpture featuring human forms in John Milton&#x27;s apartment closely resembled the &quot;Ex nihilo&quot; sculpture by Frederick Hart on the facade of the Episcopal National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., and that a scene involving the sculpture infringed Hart&#x27;s rights under copyright law in the United States. Hart and the National Cathedral jointly initiated the action, with an argument similar to architect Lebbeus Woods&#x27;s successful lawsuit over imagery in the film &quot;12 Monkeys&quot;. Defenses available to Warner Bros. were that the effect was designed without knowledge of &quot;Ex nihilo&quot;, or fair use.

After a federal judge ruled that the film&#x27;s video release would be delayed until the case went to trial unless a settlement was reached, Warner Bros. agreed to edit the scene for future releases and to attach stickers to unedited videotapes to indicate there was no relation between the art in the film and Hart&#x27;s work. The settlement in February 1998 meant 475,000 copies of the VHS and DVD could go into rental stores and businesses.

===Adaptations===
In 2014, Andrew Neiderman wrote a prequel novel, &quot;Judgment Day&quot;, about John Milton arriving in New York City and obtaining control of a major law firm. Neiderman brought the book to Warner Bros. for a television series adaptation. John Wells and Arnold Kopelson unsuccessfully attempted to adapt &quot;Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot; into a series in 2014. Produced by Warner Bros. Television, Wells and Kopelson took the project to NBC for a television pilot written by Matt Venne.

A musical play based on &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot; is in development. Julian Woolford also launched a stage adaptation &quot;Advocaat van de Duivel&quot; in the Netherlands in 2015.

<text>Scale insects are small insects of the order Hemiptera, suborder Sternorrhyncha. Of dramatically variable appearance and extreme sexual dimorphism, they comprise the infraorder Coccomorpha which is considered a more convenient grouping than the superfamily Coccoidea due to taxonomic uncertainties. Adult females typically have soft bodies and no limbs, and are concealed underneath domed scales, extruding quantities of wax for protection. Some species are hermaphroditic, with a combined ovotestis instead of separate ovaries and testes. Males, in the species where they occur, have legs and sometimes wings, and resemble small flies. Scale insects are herbivores, piercing plant tissues with their mouthparts and remaining in one place, feeding on sap. The excess fluid they imbibe is secreted as honeydew on which sooty mold tends to grow. The insects often have a mutualistic relationship with ants, which feed on the honeydew and protect them from predators. There are about 8,000 described species.

The oldest fossils of the group date to the Late Jurassic, preserved in amber. They were already substantially diversified by the Early Cretaceous suggesting an earlier origin during the Triassic or Jurassic. Their closest relatives are the jumping plant lice, whiteflies, phylloxera bugs and aphids. The majority of female scale insects remain in one place as adults, with newly hatched nymphs, known as &quot;crawlers&quot;, being the only mobile life stage, apart from the short-lived males. The reproductive strategies of many species include at least some amount of asexual reproduction by parthenogenesis.

Some scale insects are serious commercial pests, notably the cottony cushion scale (&quot;Icerya purchasi&quot;) on &quot;Citrus&quot; fruit trees; they are difficult to control as the scale and waxy covering protect them effectively from contact insecticides. Some species are used for biological control of pest plants such as the prickly pear, &quot;Opuntia&quot;. Others produce commercially valuable substances including carmine and kermes dyes, and shellac lacquer. The two red colour-names crimson and scarlet both derive from the names of &quot;Kermes&quot; products in other languages.

==Description==
Scale insects vary dramatically in appearance, from very small organisms (1–2 mm) that grow beneath wax covers (some shaped like oysters, others like mussel shells), to shiny pearl-like objects (about 5 mm), to animals covered with mealy wax. Adult females are almost always immobile (apart from mealybugs) and permanently attached to the plant on which they are feeding. They secrete a waxy coating for defence, making them resemble reptilian or fish scales, and giving them their common name. The key character that sets apart the Coccomorpha from all other Hemiptera is the single segmented tarsus on the legs with only one claw at the tip.

The group is extremely sexually dimorphic; female scale insects, unusual for Hemiptera, retain the immature external morphology even when sexually mature, a condition known as neoteny. Adult females are pear-shaped, elliptical or circular, with no wings, and usually no constriction separating the head from the body. Segmentation of the body is indistinct, but may be indicated by the presence of marginal bristles. Legs are absent in the females of some families, and when present vary from single segment stubs to five-segmented limbs. Female scale insects have no compound eyes, but ocelli (simple eyes) are sometimes present in Margarodidae, Ortheziidae and Phenacoleachiidae. The family Beesoniidae lacks antennae, but other families possess antennae with from one to thirteen segments. The mouthparts are adapted for piercing and sucking.

Adult males in contrast have the typical head, thorax and abdomen of other insect groups, and are so different from females that pairing them as a species is challenging. They are usually slender insects resembling aphids or small flies. They have antennae with nine or ten segments, compound eyes (Margarodidae and Ortheziidae) or simple eyes (most other families), and legs with five segments.
Most species have wings, and in some, generations may alternate between being winged and wingless. Adult males do not feed, and die within two or three days of emergence.

In species with winged males, generally only the forewings are fully functional. This is unusual among insects; it most closely resembles the situation in the true flies, the Diptera. However, the Diptera and Hemiptera are not closely related, and do not closely resemble each other in morphology; for example, the tail filaments of the Coccomorpha do not resemble anything in the morphology of flies. The hind (metathoracic) wings are reduced, commonly to the point that they can easily be overlooked. In some species the hind wings have hamuli, hooklets, that couple the hind wings to the main wings, as in the Hymenoptera. The vestigial wings are often reduced to pseudo-halteres, club-like appendages, but these are not homologous with the control organs of Diptera, and it is not clear whether they have any substantial control function.

Hermaphroditism is very rare in insects, but several species of &quot;Icerya&quot; exhibit an unusual form. The adult possesses an ovotestis, consisting of both female and male reproductive tissue, and sperm is transmitted to the young for their future use. The fact that a new population can be founded by a single individual may have contributed to the success of the cottony cushion scale which has spread around the world.

==Life cycle==
Female scale insects in more advanced families develop from the egg through a first instar (crawler) stage and a second instar stage before becoming adult. In more primitive families there is an additional instar stage. Males pass through a first and second instar stage, a pre-pupal and a pupal stage before adulthood (actually a pseudopupa, as only holometabolous insects have a true pupa).

The first instars of most species of scale insects emerge from the egg with functional legs, and are informally called &quot;crawlers&quot;. They immediately crawl around in search of a suitable spot to settle down and feed. In some species they delay settling down either until they are starving, or until they have been blown away by wind onto what presumably is another plant, where they may establish a new colony. There are many variations on such themes, such as scale insects that are associated with species of ants that act as herders and carry the young ones to protected sites to feed. In either case, many such species of crawlers, when they moult, lose the use of their legs if they are female, and stay put for life. Only the males retain legs, and in some species wings, and use them in seeking females. To do this they usually walk, as their ability to fly is limited, but they may get carried to new locations by the wind.

Adult females of the families Margarodidae, Ortheziidae and Pseudococcidae are mobile and can move to other parts of the host plant or even adjoining plants, but the mobile period is limited to a short period between moults. Some of these overwinter in crevices in the bark or among plant litter, moving in spring to tender young growth. However, the majority of female scale insects are sedentary as adults. Their dispersal ability depends on how far a crawler can crawl before it needs to shed its skin and start feeding. There are various strategies for dealing with deciduous trees. On these, males often feed on the leaves, usually beside the veins, while females select the twigs. Where there are several generations in the year, there may be a general retreat onto the twigs as fall approaches. On branches, the underside is usually preferred as giving protection against predation and adverse weather. The solenopsis mealybug feeds on the foliage of its host in summer and the roots in winter, and large numbers of scale species feed invisibly, year-round on roots.

=== Reproduction and the genetics of sex determination ===

Scale insects show a very wide range of variations in the genetics of sex determination and the modes of reproduction. Besides sexual reproduction, a number of different forms of reproductive systems are employed, including asexual reproduction by parthenogenesis. In some species, sexual and asexual populations are found in different locations, and in general, species with a wide geographic range and a diversity of plant hosts are more likely to be asexual. Large population size is hypothesized to protect an asexual population from becoming extinct, but nevertheless, parthenogenesis is uncommon among scale insects, with the most widespread generalist feeders reproducing sexually, the majority of these being pest species.

Many species have the XX-XO system where the female is diploid and homogametic while the male is heterogametic and missing a sex chromosome. In some Diaspididae and Pseudococcidae, both sexes are produced from fertilized eggs but during development males eliminate the paternal genome and this system called paternal genome elimination (PGE) is found in nearly 14 scale insect families. This elimination is achieved with several variations. The commonest (known as the lecanoid system) involved deactivation of the paternal genome and elimination at the time of sperm production in males, this is seen in Pseudococcidae, Kerriidae and some Eriococcidae. In the other variant or &quot;Comstockiella&quot; system, the somatic cells have the paternal genome untouched. A third variant found in Diaspididae involves the paternal genome being completely removed at an early stage making males haploid both in somatic and germ cells even though they are formed from diploids, i.e., from fertilized eggs. In addition to this there is also true haplodiploidy with females born from fertilized eggs and males from unfertilized eggs. This is seen in the genus &quot;Icerya&quot;. In &quot;Parthenolecanium&quot;, males are born from unfertilized eggs but diploidy is briefly restored by fusion of haploid cleave nuclei and then one sex chromosome is lost through heterochromatinization. Females can reproduce parthenogenetically with six different variants based on whether males are entirely absent or not (obligate v. facultative parthenogenesis); the sex of fertilized v. unfertilized eggs; and based on how diploidy is restored in unfertilized eggs. The evolution of these systems are thought to be the result of intra-genomic conflict as well as possibly inter-genomic conflict with endosymbionts under varied selection pressures. The diversity of systems has made scale insects ideal models for research.

==Ecology==
Scale insects are an ancient group, having originated in the Cretaceous, the period in which angiosperms came to dominance among plants, with only a few groups species found on gymnosperms. They feed on a wide variety of plants but are unable to survive long away from their hosts. While some specialise on a single plant species (monophagous), and some on a single genus or plant family (oligophagous), others are less specialised and feed on several plant groups (polyphagous). The parasite biologist Robert Poulin notes that the feeding behaviour of scale insects closely resembles that of ectoparasites, living on the outside of their host and feeding only on them, even if they have not traditionally been so described; in his view, those species that remain immobile on a single host and feed only on it behave as obligate ectoparasites. 
For example, cochineal species are restricted to cactus hosts, and the gall-inducing &quot;Apiomorpha&quot; are restricted to &quot;Eucalyptus&quot;. Some species have certain habitat requirements; some Ortheziidae occur in damp meadows, among mosses and in woodland soil, and the boreal ensign scale (&quot;Newsteadia floccosa&quot;) inhabits plant litter. A Hawaiian mealybug &quot;Clavicoccus erinaceus&quot; that fed solely on the now critically endangered &quot;Abutilon sandwicense&quot; has gone extinct as has another species &quot;Phyllococcus oahuensis&quot;. Several other monophagous scale insects, especially those on islands, are threatened by coextinction due to threats faced by their host plants.

Most scale insects are herbivores, feeding on phloem sap drawn directly from the plant&#x27;s vascular system, but a few species feed on fungal mats and fungi, such as some species in the genus &quot;Newsteadia&quot; in the family Ortheziidae. Plant sap provides a liquid diet which is rich in sugar and non-essential amino acids. In order to make up for the shortage of essential amino acids, they depend on endosymbiotic proteobacteria. Scale insects secrete a large quantity of sticky viscid fluid known as &quot;honeydew&quot;. This includes sugars, amino acids and minerals, and is attractive to ants as well as acting as a substrate on which sooty mould can grow. The mould can reduce photosynthesis by the leaves and detracts from the appearance of ornamental plants. The scale&#x27;s activities can result in stress for the plant, causing reduced growth and giving it a greater susceptibility to plant diseases.

Scale insects in the genus &quot;Cryptostigma&quot; live inside the nests of neotropical ant species. Many tropical plants need ants to survive which in turn cultivate scale insects thus forming a tripartite symbiosis. Some ants and scale insects have a mutualistic relationship; the ants feed on the honeydew and in return protect the scales. On a tulip tree, ants have been observed building a papery tent over the scales. In other instances, scale insects are carried inside the ant&#x27;s nest; the ant &quot;Acropyga exsanguis&quot; takes this to an extreme by transporting a fertilised female mealybug with it on its nuptial flight, so that the nest it founds can be provisioned. This provides a means for the mealybug to be dispersed widely. Species of &quot;Hippeococcus&quot; have long clinging legs with claws to grip the &quot;Dolichoderus&quot; ants which tend them; they allow themselves to be carried into the ant colony. Here the mealybugs are safe from predation and environmental hazards, while the ants have a source of nourishment. Another species of ant maintains a herd of scale insects inside the hollow stems of a &quot;Barteria&quot; tree; the scale insects feed on the sap and the ants, while benefiting from the honeydew, drive away other herbivorous insects from the tree as well as preventing vines from smothering it.

Scale insects have various natural enemies, and research in this field is largely directed at the species that are crop pests. Entomopathogenic fungi can attack suitable scales and completely overgrow them. The identity of the host is not always apparent as many fungi are host-specific, and may destroy all the scales of one species present on a leaf while not affecting another species. Fungi in the genus &quot;Septobasidium&quot; have a more complex, mutualistic relationship with scale insects. The fungus lives on trees where it forms a mat which overgrows the scales, reducing the growth of the individual parasitised scales and sometimes rendering them infertile, but protecting the scale colony from environmental conditions and predators. The fungus benefits by metabolising the sap extracted from the tree by the insects.

Natural enemies include parasitoid wasps, mostly in the families Encyrtidae and Eulophidae, and predatory beetles such as fungus weevils, ladybirds and sap beetles. Ladybirds feed on aphids and scale insects, laying their eggs near their prey to ensure their larvae have immediate access to food. The ladybird &quot;Cryptolaemus montrouzieri&quot; is known as the &quot;mealybug destroyer&quot; because both adults and larvae feed on mealybugs and some soft scales. Ants looking after their providers of honeydew tend to drive off predators, but the mealybug destroyer has outwitted the ants by developing cryptic camouflage, with their larvae mimicking scale larvae.

==Significance==

===As pests===

Many scale species are serious crop pests and are particularly problematic for their ability to evade quarantine measures. In 1990, they caused around $5 billion of damage to crops in the United States.
The waxy covering of many species of scale protects their adults effectively from contact insecticides, which are only effective against the first-instar nymph stage known as the &quot;crawler&quot;. However, scales can often be controlled using horticultural oils that suffocate them, systemic pesticides that poison the sap of the host plants, or by biological control agents such as tiny parasitoid wasps and ladybirds. Insecticidal soap may also be used against scales.

One species, the cottony cushion scale, is a serious commercial pest on 65 families of woody plants, including &quot;Citrus&quot; fruits. It has spread worldwide from Australia.

===As biological controls===

At the same time, some kinds of scale insects are themselves useful as biological control agents for pest plants, such as various species of cochineal insects that attack invasive species of prickly pear, which spread widely especially in Australia and Africa.

===Products===

Some types of scale insect are economically valuable for the substances they can yield under proper husbandry. Some, such as the cochineal, kermes, lac, Armenian cochineal, and Polish cochineal, have been used to produce red dyes for coloring foods and dyeing fabrics. Both the colour name &quot;crimson&quot; and the generic name &quot;Kermes&quot; are from Italian &quot;carmesi&quot; or &quot;cremesi&quot; for the dye used for Italian silk textiles, in turn from the Persian &quot;qirmizī&quot; (قرمز), meaning both the colour and the insect. The colour name &quot;scarlet&quot; is similarly derived from Arabic &quot;siklāt&quot;, denoting extremely expensive luxury silks dyed red using kermes.

Some waxy scale species in the genera &quot;Ceroplastes&quot; and &quot;Ericerus&quot; produce materials such as Chinese wax, and several genera of lac scales produce shellac.

==Evolution==

The containing group of the scale insects was formerly treated as the superfamily Coccoidea but taxonomic uncertainties have led workers to prefer the use of the infraorder Coccomorpha as the preferred name for the group. Scale insects are members of the Sternorrhyncha. The phylogeny of the extant groups, inferred from analysis of small subunit (18S) ribosomal RNA, is shown in the first cladogram.

The timing of phylogenetic diversification within the Coccomorpha was estimated in a 2016 study based on molecular clock divergence time estimates, along with fossils being used for calibration. They suggested that the main scale insect lineages diverged before their angiosperm hosts, and suggested that the insects switched from feeding on gymnosperms once the angiosperms became common and widespread in the Cretaceous. They estimated that the Coccomorpha appeared at the start of the Triassic period, around 245 million years ago, and that the neococcoids appeared during the Early Jurassic, some 185 million years ago. Scale insects are very well represented in the fossil record, with the oldest known member of the group reported from the Late Jurassic amber from Lebanon. They are abundantly preserved in amber from the Early Cretaceous, 130 mya, onwards; they were already highly diversified by Cretaceous times. All the families were monophyletic except for the Eriococcidae. The Coccomorpha are division into two clades the &quot;Archaeococcoids&quot; and &quot;Neococcoids&quot;. The archaeococcoid families have adult males with either compound eyes or a row of unicorneal eyes and have abdominal spiracles in the females. In neoccoids, the females have no abdominal spiracles. In the cladogram below the genus &quot;Pityococcus&quot; is moved to the &quot;Neococcoids&quot;. A cladogram showing the major families using this methodology is shown below.

<text>Transatlanticism is the fourth studio album by rock band Death Cab for Cutie, released on October 7, 2003, by Barsuk Records. At this point in their career, the group had toured and recorded for nearly a half-decade. With tensions rising, the band decided to take time away from one another; notably, Ben Gibbard collaborated with electronic musician Dntel (Jimmy Tamborello), and released an album, &quot;Give Up&quot;, under the name the Postal Service. Death Cab regrouped in late 2002 to create &quot;Transatlanticism&quot;, which was recorded in a leisurely manner over five-day stretches until June 2003.

The record is a concept album, exploring a theme of long-distance romance. Gibbard penned the lyrics, which are somber and focus on the need to be loved. Musically, the album utilizes ambience and instrumental sparseness as an extension of this theme. The album&#x27;s title, likewise, references the Atlantic Ocean and uses it as a metaphor for geographic and emotional separation. Chris Walla, the band&#x27;s guitarist, produced the album as he had for its predecessors. The album&#x27;s artwork was created by artist Adde Russell.

Prior to the album&#x27;s release, &quot;Give Up&quot; had become a huge success, eventually going platinum—unusual territory for indie rock artists. The band were also referenced on the television drama &quot;The O.C.&quot;, which increased their profile. Expectations for &quot;Transatlanticism&quot; were high, with the band receiving renewed attention. The album was a success: it charted at number 97 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for shipments of 1,000,000 copies in the United States. It received acclaim from music critics, who praised its emotional tone and expansive music. It is also the band&#x27;s first album with drummer Jason McGerr.

==Background==
Death Cab for Cutie formed in Bellingham, Washington, in 1997 by singer-songwriter Ben Gibbard, multi-instrumentalist Chris Walla, bassist Nick Harmer, and drummer Nathan Good. Gibbard had met Walla during their tenure at Western Washington University, and bonded over their taste in music. The quartet made their debut on the limited cassette release &quot;You Can Play These Songs with Chords&quot;. The following year, the group relocated to Seattle to pursue music in earnest. Their proper debut album, &quot;Something About Airplanes&quot;, was released on Seattle independent label Barsuk Records. They continued to build a following through relentless touring, and issued their second album, &quot;We Have the Facts and We&#x27;re Voting Yes&quot;, in 2000. The group shifted their percussionists numerous times: Good was replaced by Jayson Tolzdorf-Larson, and then by Michael Schorr, with whom the band recorded their third LP, &quot;The Photo Album&quot;, released in 2001.

&quot;The Photo Album&quot; creation was rushed for financial reasons. Each band member had recently left their day jobs, with the band now their primary source of income for the first time. They had also set a tour for later in the year, which led to a rushed, difficult recording process. Upon its release, &quot;The Photo Album&quot; represented the group&#x27;s biggest success yet. It sold over 50,000 records at that time, which was unprecedented for an indie band. Despite this, relations between the band grew strained. The group had issues with Schorr, and Walla—who enjoyed recording music more than performing it—was feeling exhausted by the entire experience. It culminated in a tense fight at a tour stop in Baltimore in October 2001 where the band nearly broke up. After their touring commitments were complete, the band took a hiatus.

Gibbard moved to the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, and began collaborating with electronic music artist Dntel (Jimmy Tamborello). The duo completed an album together, titled &quot;Give Up&quot;, which was issued on Sub Pop Records in February 2003. It became a bigger success than either had imagined, selling over 500,000 copies within its first two years of release, and over one million within the decade. Walla, meanwhile, continued to explore his interest in recording, producing albums by the Thermals and the Decemberists. By the time the band regrouped to work on their next album, tensions had cooled. Schorr had departed the band and was replaced by drummer Jason McGerr. His addition assisted in bringing stability to the band, as his calm demeanor helped settle the band&#x27;s previous dynamic.

==Recording and production==
&quot;Transatlanticism&quot; was recorded between December 2002 and June 2003. The album was mainly recorded at the Hall of Justice, a studio in Seattle&#x27;s Fremont neighborhood that Walla purchased in 2000. A large portion of recording was also completed at Tiny Telephone Studios in San Francisco, where Walla worked as an engineer. He credited that studio as &quot;the fifth member of the band&quot;, noting that its isolated location allowed him to &quot;get locked in there in the most beautiful kind of way.&quot; The group made a conscious effort to spread out the recording process across months and studios, as they had had a poor experience recording its predecessor in a short time frame. Sessions at both studios were typically held over five day spans, with the band working leisurely and allowing themselves time to return to the recordings later for a fresh perspective.

In contrast to the negative atmosphere that produced its predecessor, the working environment for &quot;Transatlanticism&quot; was a kind and creative one. McGerr&#x27;s joining the band refreshed their own commitment to the project, including Walla, who had at various times threatened to leave in the past. Gibbard considered it key that Walla was enjoying himself, and cited it as an integral piece to the album&#x27;s success. To help spark inspiration during the recording process, the quartet utilized Oblique Strategies, a card-based method for promoting creativity jointly created by musician Brian Eno and painter Peter Schmidt, first published in 1975. As with previous Death Cab records, &quot;Transatlanticism&quot; was recorded entirely on analog tape, avoiding the convenience of digital technology, which was still new then. With the extra time taken in the studio, the fidelity of the album is of a considerably higher quality than previous efforts. The band recorded 12 songs, but left one incomplete at the time of its release.

Prior to the album&#x27;s release, Gibbard stated: &quot;...unlike &quot;The Photo Album&quot;, I feel like this record is definitely more like a proper album. We’ve tried to construct it with transitions of songs going in and out of each other, and I think it&#x27;s a little bit more expansive than the last record.&quot;

==Composition==

Throughout its eleven tracks, &quot;Transatlanticism&quot; is a concept album exploring themes of isolation, sorrow, and long-distance romance. Lauren Viera at the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; categorized the album&#x27;s contents as &quot;earnest love songs and bittersweet ballads.&quot; When creating the LP, Gibbard felt &quot;fascinated with the idea of geographic barriers as metaphors for personal, emotional barriers.&quot; The album&#x27;s title is a word Gibbard created to reference the Atlantic Ocean&#x27;s vast reach and its ability to separate individuals. Harmer looked up the word and discovered it indeed already existed, having been used in science journals. The inspiration for the album&#x27;s title track came from Gibbard observing individuals saying goodbye to each another at Heathrow Airport, and knowing that they may not see one another for some time. &quot;I had this fantastic idea of what if people were just able to transport themselves across the places or events that separated them,&quot; Gibbard told writer Andy Greenwald on the song&#x27;s genesis.

Prior to creating the album, Gibbard felt increasingly exhausted with touring, and had a relationship fall apart because of being away for so long. These experiences comprised what Gibbard reflected on as the &quot;lowest&quot; year in his life, and influenced the songwriting on &quot;Transatlanticism&quot; profoundly. He began to focus more on songwriting as a career. He was aiming to complete one song per day, and for the album, he brought the band 25–30 demo tracks. Much of Gibbard&#x27;s lyrics were composed during a &quot;period of exile&quot; when he was living in San Francisco, house-sitting for John Vanderslice, the artist and owner of Tiny Telephone Studios. Walla considered Gibbard&#x27;s writing an improvement on past releases, later calling it &quot;some of the most genuine and straightforward writing he&#x27;s ever done, really open and unguarded in a way that was kind of new.&quot; His work with Tamborello informed his songwriting for &quot;Transatlanticism&quot;, with particular emphasis on redeveloping songs and deciding what to leave in or out. Gibbard would submit his songs to the band, who from there would take them and redevelop them. The musicians would take each song, break it back down to its melody and lyrics, and completely re-work the original arrangement if they felt it creatively necessary. &quot;By asking for, and allowing more input from all of us, we could all help each other to explore new territory and take a few more risks,&quot; Harmer said.

Greenwald, writing for MTV, writes that the album&#x27;s songs &quot;slow dance between genres—lush, sensitive piano ballads bump up against and blur into kaleidoscopic guitar grooves.&quot; The album emphasizes ambient noises, including &quot;clicks, whooshes, and whirs&quot;; the title track, for example, is built around the humming of an airplane engine. Its mood is often somber or dark, which Gibbard figured was an extension of his point of view in life: &quot;I have this sense of realism that sometimes is a little depressing,&quot; he confessed to &quot;Magnet&quot; in 2003. Jim Fusilli, writing for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, found the content on the album &quot;often-gloomy, [but] yearning-for-optimism.&quot; Walla rejected the notion that the content on the album was bleak, noting that Gibbard&#x27;s lyrics are mainly a &quot;real simple expression of need and needing to be loved.&quot; Kelefa Sanneh, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, observed that an extension of the album&#x27;s long-distance theme lies in each song&#x27;s reliance &quot;upon a single, fragile-sounding melodic line—a skein of broken guitar chords, a reverberating piano.&quot;

==Artwork==
The album&#x27;s artwork was created by Seattle-based painter Adde Russell. Russell knew Josh Rosenfeld, one of the founders of Barsuk Records, and McGerr had been her drum teacher. Rosenfeld asked the band if they would be interested in working with Russell, and they agreed. Russell began by producing a copious amount of artwork, in varying styles. &quot;I had the expectation that either they&#x27;d find something in the mess that they liked or that the band would see how much work I&#x27;d done that they wouldn&#x27;t have the heart to say no,&quot; she later remembered. The crow on the album cover was found by Russell in a hobby shop. Initially, it was a white styrofoam bird with red string. Harmer was particularly interested in this imagery, and continued her to keep working, and she eventually delivered the final album cover.

Eric Gansworth, writing for &quot;At Length&quot; magazine, describes the album&#x27;s inner sleeve:
==Release==
Death Cab for Cutie first announced &quot;Transatlanticism&quot; on June 25, 2003, on &quot;Pitchfork&quot;. In the interim between albums, the group had licensed its songs for usage on the popular television drama &quot;The O.C.&quot;, which helped introduce them to a wider audience. &quot;A Lack of Color&quot; was used on the show, and the band appeared as itself in an episode of the second season, performing &quot;Title and Registration&quot; and &quot;The Sound of Settling&quot; in the show&#x27;s fictional music venue. This publicity, plus the wide success of Gibbard&#x27;s other project, the Postal Service, led to considerably higher interest in &quot;Transatlanticism&quot; from the public. The album leaked online before its release; Gibbard called this a &quot;good thing,&quot; noting, &quot;if anything I like the idea of normal people getting a chance to hear it before it comes out.&quot;

&quot;Transatlanticism&quot; was released on October 7, 2003, by Barsuk Records. It was released physically on compact disc, double-LP vinyl, and cassette; additionally, the record saw digital distribution on the iTunes Store, which had debuted that year. In addition to regular formats, Barsuk also issued a limited release for audiophiles on SACD, the initial successor to CDs that purported to have higher audio quality and more storage. Walla extolled the possibilities of the format in a profile for &quot;CMJ&quot; at that time: &quot;I think on a really subconscious level, [SACDs make] music more compelling to listen to,&quot; he said. Initial sales projections from the label were for first-week sales of between 6–8,000 copies. It debuted to over 15,000 copies sold, and became their first album to chart on &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number 97. It had sold over 100,000 copies by the following April, and by end of 2004, it had moved 225,000 copies. By 2007, the record had reached 530,000 copies sold, which music journalist Greg Kot judged was &quot;a massive hit by indie-rock standards&quot;. On April 29, 2008, it was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

In 2013, to celebrate the album&#x27;s tenth anniversary, Barsuk reissued the LP on vinyl. The label also released &quot;Transatlanticism Demos&quot;, a collection of demo versions of songs from &quot;Transatlanticism&quot;.

==Touring==
The band regrouped to rehearse for the tour behind &quot;Transatlanticism&quot; in late 2003. In contrast to their previous live setups, which were simpler and more focused on the four instruments, the band made it a priority to include samplers to incorporate the soundscapes present on &quot;Transatlanticism&quot;. Previously, the quartet had driven themselves from city to city in an Econoline van. For this tour, their accommodations were upgraded: they paid for a tour bus for the first time. Gibbard justified the expense in an interview with &quot;CMJ&quot;: &quot;All of us are past this Catholic-style indie-rock guilt about taking a bus. No, dude, taking a bus is rad.&quot; They toured throughout late 2003 alongside Nada Surf, The Long Winters, and Mates of State. It was the band&#x27;s first tour with only one supporting act per show. Their rationale was that as their catalog had grown, it felt more reasonable to play longer shows. In early 2004, they again toured the U.S., co-headlining with Ben Kweller.

Its touring commitments for &quot;Transatlanticism&quot; included spots at the 2004 Coachella Festival in Indio, California, New York&#x27;s Siren Festival, Q101&#x27;s &quot;Block Party&quot; in Chicago, and the &quot;Bite of Portland&quot; festival, a fundraiser for the Special Olympics Oregon. Pearl Jam invited the band to open for them on their 2004 Vote for Change tour, and the band concluded the year with another headlining tour across the U.S., between October and November 2004. They were originally set to open for pop punk group Blink-182 that December, but the band had to cancel as Gibbard developed a benign cyst on his leg that required surgery and a rest period. All of the touring for &quot;Transatlanticism&quot; took place Stateside; touring overseas was complicated for the band, as their record label contracts were split between nine different companies there. These issues and the band&#x27;s rising stardom led them to court major-labels in 2004. The band&#x27;s touring behind &quot;Transatlanticism&quot; is documented in the film &quot;Drive Well, Sleep Carefully&quot; by director Justin Mitchell.

==Reception ==

&quot;Transatlanticism&quot; was met with widespread critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 85, based on 21 reviews. &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine hailed it as &quot;a record of rare beauty and poise&quot;, and &quot;Alternative Press&quot; deemed it &quot;Death Cab&#x27;s slowest and most mature recording&quot; with &quot;hidden bits of magic [that] reveal themselves brilliantly.&quot; Andy Greenwald from &quot;Spin&quot; found the imagery of the lyrics strikingly vivid while praising Gibbard and Walla&#x27;s musical direction. Rob Theakston of AllMusic wrote that &quot;Transatlanticism&quot; is &quot;such a decadently good listen from start to finish&quot; because of the band&#x27;s maturity as songwriters and musicians.

In &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, Stephen Thompson said the record &quot;surpasses Gibbard&#x27;s other career highpoints&quot;, calling it &quot;a lush, impeccably produced, musically adventurous, emotionally resonant examination of the way relationships are both strengthened and damaged by distance&quot;. &quot;PopMatters&quot; critic Christine Klunk said it was a &quot;nearly perfect pop record&quot; whose straightforward melodies and honest narratives extolled the human condition. William Morris from &quot;Pitchfork&quot; was more critical, lamenting what he felt were Gibbard&#x27;s more generalized lyrics and less edge to the band&#x27;s &quot;usually acute divinations&quot;. &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot;″s Colin McElligatt said despite his strong melodies, he had regressed as a lyricist and sounded more &quot;asinine&quot; than before. In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau cited &quot;We Looked Like Giants&quot; as a &quot;choice cut&quot;, indicating &quot;a good song on an album that isn&#x27;t worth your time or money&quot;.

In 2011, &quot;Transatlanticism&quot; was named by NPR Music as one of the fifty most important recordings of the 2000s decade, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it 57th on the magazine&#x27;s decade-end list. In 2013, Death Cab for Cutie re-released the album, marking its 10th anniversary with a remaster available as vinyl or MP3 download, including demos for all the songs from the album. In a retrospective piece that year, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Kyle Anderson called &quot;Transatlanticism&quot; a &quot;classic indie-rock album&quot;, while &quot;Pitchfork&quot; editor Ian Cohen wrote, &quot;few records open themselves up to forge those kind of moments, to be a formative emotional and listening experience, pushing you to feel what you&#x27;re thinking (to flip a line from &#x27;Lightness&#x27;), daring to be universal enough to allow you to see yourself in it.&quot;

==Legacy==
&quot;Transatlanticism&quot; was released at a moment where indie rock became a cultural force, gaining popularity outside its typical fanbases. Death Cab, like the Shins, Modest Mouse, and Interpol, saw increased popularity and record sales. The album also became a crossover hit for emo fans. In a cover story for &quot;Spin&quot; at that time, writer Andy Greenwald suggested that &quot;Death Cab have found a way to communicate intimate, insular indie rock to the budding teen-emo overground&quot;. The group rejected their association with emo music, turning down an offer to tour with Dashboard Confessional, to whom they were frequently compared.

The band sparked a major-label bidding war, with A&amp;R representatives viewing them as America&#x27;s answer to the band Coldplay. Interscope&#x27;s Jimmy Iovine vied to sign both the Postal Service and Death Cab, reportedly exclaiming, &quot;Why would I only want the one that doesn&#x27;t sell as much as the other one?&quot; Gibbard viewed the band&#x27;s increasing profile excitedly: &quot;We&#x27;re over being an indie rock band. We&#x27;re proud of what we&#x27;ve accomplished, but it&#x27;s far more exciting to me to reach an audience that stretches beyond any genre or age group.&quot;
 By November 2004, the group had left Barsuk and signed a worldwide, long-term deal with major label Atlantic Records. The process to sign the band was a difficult, year-long affair; Atlantic had to buy out the rest of the quartet&#x27;s Barsuk contract and pay that label for the remaining two albums it owed them.

Gibbard has since ranked &quot;Transatlanticism&quot; as his favorite album by the band, remarking that with both the release of &quot;Give Up&quot; and &quot;Transatlanticism&quot;, &quot;I’ve never had a more creatively inspired year.&quot;

<text>We Have the Facts and We&#x27;re Voting Yes is the second studio album by American rock band Death Cab for Cutie. It was released on March 21, 2000, through Barsuk Records. The band, which originally included singer-songwriter Ben Gibbard, guitarist/producer Chris Walla, bassist Nick Harmer, and drummer Nathan Good, formed in Bellingham, Washington in 1997. Their debut studio album, &quot;Something About Airplanes&quot;, was released in 1998 through Barsuk, after which Good exited the band. Between the two albums, both Gibbard and Walla released music via side projects, ¡All-Time Quarterback! and Martin Youth Auxiliary, respectively.

The album was developed over a period of five months between the three, and recorded at the members&#x27; parents&#x27; homes. The recording came at a transitional time for the band, who were on the cusp of adulthood with little idea of what was to come. Gibbard infused these post-collegiate anxieties into his lyricism, with his songwriting melding narratives with abstract imagery for the first time. The album is sonically downbeat, with its despondent sound and spindly guitar work heavily influenced by slowcore.

&quot;We Have the Facts and We&#x27;re Voting Yes&quot; received acclaim from music critics, with praise directed towards Gibbard&#x27;s songwriting. Death Cab for Cutie supported the album with their first full nationwide tour, with drummer Jayson Tolzdorf-Larson joining. No singles were released from the album, though the LP was followed by an extended play, &quot;The Forbidden Love EP&quot;, several months after its release.

==Background and development==

Death Cab for Cutie originated with singer-songwriter Ben Gibbard, formerly of the power pop outfit Pinwheel, while he attended Western Washington University in Bellingham, Washington. During a break from the group, Gibbard put together a demo of songs under the name Death Cab for Cutie, named after a song by the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band. The demo tape was produced by guitarist/producer Christopher Walla, whom Gibbard had met at a concert. The cassette, &quot;You Can Play These Songs with Chords&quot; (1997), attracted significant local attention and prompted Gibbard to assemble a band lineup. Roommate Nick Harmer joined as the bassist, along with temporary drummer Nathan Good. Within a year, Death Cab for Cutie had signed to Seattle record label Barsuk Records, their debut studio album &quot;Something About Airplanes&quot; (1998) was released though.

Bellingham lacked employment opportunities or a real music scene, leading the band to relocate southbound to Seattle. Gibbard—an environmental chemistry major—had been working at a testing lab in Bellingham while Harmer and Walla were making ends meet at a coffee shop. The two of them moved back in with their parents, though Gibbard rented an apartment with his girlfriend. Good&#x27;s situation was different, with him getting married, and he had accrued significant student debt. In addition to this, Good lacked the support of his musical interests from his parents that Gibbard, Walla, and Harmer shared. Good departed Death Cab for Cutie in early 1999, and the three-piece soldiered on with an interim drummer in his place from April to September of that year.

The trio struggled to find a suitable and &quot;competent&quot; percussionist who would agree to tour. Their lack of financial stability hindered matters; at the time, the band only made $50 per show, which mainly went towards fueling the Ford Econoline to drive to the next city. Gibbard has characterized this period in the history of Death Cab for Cutie as &quot;interstitial&quot;, with them lacking assurance of what was to come: &quot;It was made at a time when we didn’t have any sense of what the future held for us as individuals, let alone as a band,&quot; he recalled two decades later.

==Recording and production==
In 1999, &quot;We Have the Facts and We&#x27;re Voting Yes&quot;, like its predecessor, was recorded in a home environment rather than professional studio spaces, over a span of five months. Much of the former was tracked at the house of Harmer&#x27;s mother&#x27;s in Puyallup, Washington. She was working towards obtaining her doctoral degree at the time, spending her time in one half of the home. Death Cab for Cutie lived there for one month, working on the album at &quot;all hours of the night.&quot; Recording for &quot;We Have the Facts and We&#x27;re Voting Yes&quot; was later relocated to Walla&#x27;s parents&#x27; house in Bothell. To record the album, the band were loaned a 16-track half-inch tape recorder from fellow Northwest musicians and label-mates, Sunset Valley. They worked intently and with a unified purpose; Gibbard remembered the three were &quot;in the zone&quot; because there was not much else in their lives at the time.

Like past releases by Death Cab for Cutie, Walla served as producer on &quot;We Have the Facts and We&#x27;re Voting Yes&quot;. He initially attempted to follow one of his idols, engineer Steve Albini, who holds a studio approach similar to realistic photography: this is simply documenting what is occurring with little intervention. Walla found the perspective unsatisfactory due to the constantly evolving nature of his recording locales and equipment. In the end, he viewed his job as to do what best serves the song, and letting production flourishes complement the songwriting rather than distract. The recording of drums proved to be somewhat difficult; the snare drum went out of tune two days into recording and with Gibbard possessing only mild skill with the instrument, none of the band members knew how to tune it. He played drums for the bulk of the album, having steadily spent time practicing for sufficiently improving his expertise. On &quot;We Have the Facts and We&#x27;re Voting Yes&quot;, Gibbard plays to a click track for ensuring his timing. Good contributed percussion to the tracks, &quot;Company Calls Epilogue&quot; and &quot;The Employment Pages&quot;. Death Cab for Cutie decided to record the two songs the day before mastering was set to begin for the album. Good returned at the trio&#x27;s insistence to record drums for the songs, both of which were fully tracked and mixed at the last minute.

&quot;We Have the Facts and We&#x27;re Voting Yes&quot; was finalized and mixed in Walla&#x27;s bedroom. The liner notes for the album credit its recording and mixing to the Hall of Justice, a reference to the animated television series &quot;Super Friends&quot;. The Hall of Justice was simply Walla&#x27;s name for &quot;just a bunch of half-broken stuff that roves around from place to place at my direction.&quot; Later in 2000, Barsuk purchased Reciprocal Recording in Seattle, and let Walla manage the building; he subsequently renamed it Hall of Justice Recording. After &quot;We Have the Facts and We&#x27;re Voting Yes&quot; was completed, Tony Lash, an engineer from Portland, Oregon, mastered the album.

==Composition==
===Music and composition===
&quot;We Have the Facts and We&#x27;re Voting Yes&quot; is stylistically regarded as an indie rock album; Gibbard himself classified the band as indie pop. The bleak point of view in the lyrics and despondent tone led to many writers categorizing the album as emo; it has been called an &quot;emo classic.&quot; Gibbard and Walla&#x27;s guitar parts on &quot;We Have the Facts and We&#x27;re Voting Yes&quot; are different than those of later projects; with Gibbard later highlighting their &quot;cool, spindly guitar-work.&quot; During his early 20s, Gibbard was influenced by the downbeat, slowcore music of Bedhead and Codeine. He felt inspired by Bedhead in particular, and incentivizing intricate guitar lines for the album that &quot;weave&quot; and &quot;work through each other&quot; over simpler chords. Gibbard also conceded that his longtime love for fellow Northwest rockers Built to Spill led to &quot;flagrant&quot; appropriation of their sound in early work by Death Cab for Cutie, while Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; also suggested &quot;We Have the Facts and We&#x27;re Voting Yes&quot; is aurally reminiscent of Pavement.

Walla mixed the album with an Allen &amp; Heath MixWizard console, which is a 16-channel board that has an array of different EQ settings. Walla had fun adjusting the EQ to extreme ranges, &quot;overloading the channel&quot; and creating a &quot;gritty, awful, brittle sound.&quot; The board also has built-in presets, and though Walla found them &quot;cheesy,&quot; the band ended up utilizing a &quot;cathedral&quot; setting for bombastic effects. Otherwise, &quot;We Have the Facts and We&#x27;re Voting Yes&quot; mostly has an authentic room tone, with some delay effects on vocals that were produced via a delay pedal. Journalist Ian Cohen felt that Walla&#x27;s nascent production skill displays &quot;distinct sonic character, [with] everything obscured by a mid-fi mist, the pine scent of the Pacific Northwest and gin breath.&quot; Walla also utilized a portable sampler, Dr. Sample, to distort samples and re-incorporate them in a creative way. For example, the pulsating tone on &quot;405&quot; was sampled from a Yamaha keyboard, distorted into the sampler, set to repeat and ultimately lined up with the click track.

===Theme and lyrics===
Gibbard&#x27;s songwriting on &quot;We Have the Facts and We&#x27;re Voting Yes&quot; differs from its predecessor, possessing a more novelistic approach and frequently utilizing full sentences. Much of the songwriting was informed by his &quot;post-collegiate neuroses&quot; and general uncertainty regarding his path in life. In a later interview, Gibbard acknowledged his privilege as a &quot;middle-class college-educated white man in America,&quot; admitting that, &quot;In reality, [nervousness is] not something one should garner too much sympathy about.&quot; Ian Cohen interpreted the album as a concept album that chronicles a decaying relationship. Gibbard saw this evaluation as a &quot;complete misconception,&quot; noting that &quot;We Have the Facts and We&#x27;re Voting Yes&quot; is only conceptual in that it complies his feelings about entering adulthood. He cited Blake Schwarzenbach of Jawbreaker and fellow musician Elliott Smith as lyrical influences.

The first half of &quot;Title Track&quot; contains a softer, more lo-fi sound; Cohen assumed it was run through a low-pass filter, and likened the effect to &quot;being heard through a thin apartment wall.&quot; After a minute and a half, the production abruptly adjusts to a higher-quality sound. In actuality, both parts of the first portion were recorded live together with one microphone, double-tracked, and mixed separately. The two pieces were put together during mastering; Tony Lash narrowed the stereo image for a more &quot;drastic&quot; effect. Walla had the idea to trick listeners into believing the album was no different to its predecessor, letting the lower-quality sound cycle for too long before improving. &quot;Title Track&quot; emulates the writing style of beat poet Jack Kerouac, one of Gibbard&#x27;s favorite writers. The second track, &quot;The Employment Pages&quot;, documents Gibbard&#x27;s job hunting upon his moving to Seattle, from which he was routinely rejected. &quot;I remember thinking, &#x27;I have a degree in environmental chemistry, I worked in a lab and I can’t get a job stocking shelves?&#x27;&quot;, he said in an interview. Gibbard summarized the song as a &quot;transition of going from idyllic, easy, college-town living, to trying to become an adult for some reason, but you&#x27;re not quite sure why.&quot;

&quot;Lowell, MA&quot; was a holdover that was penned during the development of &quot;Something About Airplanes&quot;. The track touches on Gibbard&#x27;s love for Kerouac, with its localized title being a reference to his hometown, Lowell, Massachusetts. The title of &quot;405&quot; stemmed from the several freeways that bypass Interstate 5, the major north–south Interstate Highway on the West Coast of the United States, though specifically references Interstate 405 in Seattle. In college, Gibbard saw a girl whose family lived off the 405; the song makes reference to a shared weekend smoking cigarettes and drinking red wine. The lyric &quot;hide your bad habits underneath the patio&quot; originated from the fact that the two of them hid the cigarette butts underneath the patio in order to fool her parents, who were religious and more straight-laced. &quot;Little Fury Bugs&quot; utilizes a demo that Gibbard recorded at home on a four-track recorder and ultimately gave to Walla, who contributed additional elements. In the song, Gibbard performs in an odd tuning; the result of an inexpensive toy guitar he was playing on.

Gibbard had a creative breakthrough upon writing &quot;Company Calls Epilogue&quot;, which he has frequently labeled one of his favorite songs he ever wrote. Prior to its creation, Gibbard had viewed his lyricism on earlier works as too obtuse and emulative of R.E.M., who were a big influence. He considered &quot;Epilogue&quot; to be a proper marriage between this imperceptive imagery and storytelling, and a &quot;benchmark&quot; by which later songs would be judged. It has little in common with the predecessor, &quot;Company Calls&quot;, besides incorporating unused lyrics meant for the original. This iteration of &quot;Epilogue&quot; was recorded only one day before mastering was set to begin; an alternate edition was later released on &quot;The Forbidden Love EP&quot; later in 2020. The album version contains an outro that was culled from a scratch demo, which featured solely Gibbard and his guitar. It was recorded with a microphone that cost only $4. &quot;No Joy in Mudville&quot; is a tribute to musician Lou Reed, while &quot;Scientist Studies&quot; stemmed from the home Death Cab for Cutie had previously inhabited in Bellingham, which had no heating. Gibbard titled it after his study material at the time.

==Release and commercial performance==
The title &quot;We Have the Facts and We&#x27;re Voting Yes&quot; came from musician Herbert Burgel, a Seattle contemporary who formed the band Rat Cat Hogan. At one of his concerts, Burgle wore a T-shirt emblazoned with the title phrase, which referenced a legislative initiative in Nebraska at the time.

Sales expectations were higher for &quot;We Have the Facts and We&#x27;re Voting Yes&quot; for Death Cab for Cutie. Barsuk issued the album on March 21, 2000, on CD and vinyl. Two vinyl variants were issued; a standard black edition, which was later re-issued in 2014, and a limited white-colored wax. Despite the band being largely outsiders to the music industry, the album was commercially successful, though muted in comparison to their later projects. &quot;We Have the Facts and We&#x27;re Voting Yes&quot; was supported by college radio stations, and debuted &quot;strongly&quot; on &quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot; Top 200 at number 51. It premiered 11 places higher on the magazine&#x27;s Core Radio ranking, which measured airplay. Barsuk initially pressed 20,000 copies; the album had sold 32,000 by November 2001. The numbers were considered &quot;staggering&quot; for the record label, which was essentially a &quot;one-man operation&quot; ran by founder Josh Rosenfield.

==Critical reception==

&quot;We Have the Facts and We&#x27;re Voting Yes&quot; was met with positive reviews from music critics. Chris Parker of &quot;Indy Week&quot; wrote that like its predecessor, the album received &quot;glowing critical accolades,&quot; while Kimberly Chun of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; said that it received &quot;effusive critical reception in the national music media.&quot; AllMusic reviewer Jack Rabid viewed the album as the band&#x27;s &quot;best and brightest LP&quot; yet, calling it a &quot;superb&quot; effort which marks Gibbard&#x27;s emergence as a &quot;sublime&quot; songwriter. Brent DiCrescenzo of the then-emerging website Pitchfork likened it to the work of an experienced, mid-career band, lauding its &quot;warm, rich tone&quot; and &quot;delicate beauty.&quot; &quot;PopMatters&quot; critic Steve Lichtenstein praised the album for being &quot;something you want to discover and cherish with no strings attached, and pass it on as eagerly.&quot; And editor of &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; found the melodies superior to prior releases, complimenting its &quot;smattering of psychedelia.&quot;

Stephen Thompson of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; called the album a marvelous improvement, opining that it &quot;gets better the longer you listen to it, improving over its predecessor at every turn and revealing a surprising mastery of pop&#x27;s many languages.&quot; A &quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot; editorialist branded the album an &quot;impressive collection [...] In an otherwise flooded genre, DCFC stands out as one of the more innovative and skillful of the pack.&quot; Pareles included it in a listing for &quot;The New York Times&quot; &quot;Worthwhile Albums Most People Missed&quot; at the end of 2000, proposing that &quot;[Gibbard&#x27;s] wiry songs aren&#x27;t as uncertain as their lyrics pretend to be.&quot;

==Legacy==
For its 20th anniversary, several publications published retrospective pieces celebrating &quot;We Have the Facts and We&#x27;re Voting Yes&quot;. Death Cab for Cutie has generally looked back at the album fondly; Gibbard ranked it as his second favorite album the band made, remarking, &quot;[It was] by far the biggest point of entry for the OG fans. [...] &quot;Facts&quot; felt like we were a proper band in the world. [...] I just feel like that record represents the best of that era.&quot; Likewise, Walla has reminisced positively about the making of the album, doing so in 2011:
&quot;We Have the Facts and We&#x27;re Voting Yes&quot; was ranked the 14th greatest indie rock album of all time by editors of Amazon.com. It was ranked 27th on &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s list of &quot;The 50 Best Indie Rock Albums of the Pacific Northwest&quot;.

<doc id="673294" wikidata="Q840537" url="?curid=673294" title="Halo effect">
<text>The halo effect (sometimes called the halo error) is the tendency for positive impressions of a person, company, country, brand, or product in one area to positively influence one&#x27;s opinion or feelings. The halo effect is &quot;the name given to the phenomenon whereby evaluators tend to be influenced by their previous judgments of performance or personality.&quot; The halo effect is a cognitive bias which can prevent someone from forming an image of a person, a product or a brand based on the sum of all objective circumstances at hand.

The term was coined by Edward Thorndike. A simplified example of the halo effect is when a person, after noticing that an individual in a photograph is attractive, well groomed, and properly attired, then assumes, using a mental heuristic, that the person in the photograph is a good person based upon the rules of their own social concept. This constant error in judgment is reflective of the individual&#x27;s preferences, prejudices, ideology, aspirations, and social perception.

==Context and applications==
===Psychology===
The halo effect is a perception distortion (or cognitive bias) that affects the way people interpret the information about someone with whom they have formed a positive gestalt. An example of the halo effect is when a person finds out someone they have formed a positive gestalt with has cheated on their taxes. Because of the positive gestalt, the person may dismiss the significance of this behavior. They may even think that the person simply made a mistake. The person would justify the behavior and connect it with the other person&#x27;s positive gestalt. The halo effect refers to the tendency of evaluating an individual positively on many traits because of a shared belief.

It is a type of immediate judgment discrepancy, or cognitive bias, in which a person making an initial assessment of another person, place, or thing will assume ambiguous information based upon concrete information. The halo effect is an evaluation by an individual and can affect the perception of a decision, action, idea, business, person, group, entity, or other whenever concrete data is generalized or influences ambiguous information.

The halo effect can also be explained as the behavior (usually unconscious) of using evaluations based on unrelated criteria, to make judgments about something or someone. The halo effect is sometimes used to refer specifically to when this behavior has a positive correlation, such as viewing someone who is attractive as likely to be successful and popular. When this judgment has a negative connotation, such as when someone unattractive is more readily blamed for a crime than someone attractive, it is sometimes referred to as the horn effect.

===Marketing===
The term &quot;halo effect&quot; is used in marketing to explain consumer bias toward certain products because of favorable experience with other products made by the same company. It is used in the part of brand marketing called &quot;line extensions&quot;. One common halo effect is when the perceived positive features of a particular item extend to a broader brand. A notable example is the manner in which the popularity of Apple&#x27;s iPod generated enthusiasm for the corporation&#x27;s other products. Advertising often makes use of television shows, movies and those who star in them, to promote products via the halo effect.

In the automotive industry, exotic, limited-production luxury models or low-volume sports cars made by a manufacturer&#x27;s racing, motorsports, or in-house modification teams, are sometimes referred to as &quot;halo cars&quot; for the effect they are intended to produce on selling other vehicles within the make. To contrast this with the automotive terminology &quot;flagship model&quot;, see here.

Advertising in one channel has been shown to have a &quot;halo effect&quot; on advertising in another channel.
A halo effect with regard to health, dubbed a &quot;health halo&quot;, is used in food marketing to increase sales of a product; it can result in increased consumption of the product in the halo which may be unhealthy.

The term &quot;halo effect&quot; has also been applied to human rights organizations that have used their status to move away from their stated goals. Political scientist Gerald Steinberg has claimed that non-governmental organizations (NGOs) take advantage of the halo effect and are &quot;given the status of impartial moral watchdogs&quot; by governments and the news media.

The Ronald McDonald House, a widely known NGO, openly celebrates the positive outcomes it receives from the halo effect. The web page for the Ronald McDonald House in Durham, North Carolina, states that 95% of survey participants were aware of Ronald McDonald House Charities. This awareness is attributed to the halo effect, as employees, customers, and stakeholders are more likely to be involved in a charity that they recognize and trust, with a name and logo that are familiar.

A brand&#x27;s halo effect can protect its reputation in the event of a crisis. An event that is detrimental to a brand that is viewed favorably would not be as threatening or damaging to a brand that consumers view unfavorably.

===Other uses===
Non-psychology/business use of the term &quot;halo effect&quot; describes the monetary value of the spillover effect when an organization&#x27;s marketing budget is subsequently reduced. This was first demonstrated to students via the 1966 version of a textbook and a software package named &quot;The Marketing Game.&quot;

The halo effect can also be used in the case of institutions as one&#x27;s favorable perceptions regarding an aspect of an organization could determine a positive view of its entire operations. For example, if a hospital is known for its excellent open heart and cardiac program, then the community would expect it to excel in other areas as well. This can also be demonstrated in the positive perceptions of financial institutions that gained favorable coverage in the media due to meteoric growth but eventually failed afterward.

The term &quot;halo effect&quot; is also used in metal detecting to denote the enhanced ability of a metal item or coin to be detectable when it has been left undisturbed for some period of time in wet soil. The object can leach some metallic properties into the soil, making it more detectable. The area surrounding the object is called its &quot;halo.&quot;

==History==
The halo effect was originally identified in 1907 by the American psychologist Frederick L. Wells (1884–1964). However, it was only officially recognized in 1920 with empirical evidence provided by the psychologist Edward Thorndike (1874–1949). Edward Thorndike was the first to say the halo effect is a specific cognitive bias in which one aspect of the person, brand, product, or institution affects one&#x27;s thoughts or judgment of the entity&#x27;s other aspects or dimensions. Thorndike, an early behaviorist, was an important contributor to the study of the psychology of learning. He gave the phenomenon its name in his 1920 article &quot;A Constant Error in Psychological Ratings&quot;. In &quot;Constant Error&quot;, Thorndike set out to replicate the study in hopes of pinning down the bias that he thought was present in these ratings. Subsequent researchers have studied it in relation to attractiveness and its bearing on the judicial and educational systems. Thorndike originally coined the term referring only to people; however, its use has been greatly expanded, especially in the area of brand marketing.

===Supporting evidence===
In Thorndike&#x27;s words, &quot;Ratings were apparently affected by a marked tendency to think of the person in general as rather good or rather inferior and to color the judgments of the qualities by this general feeling.&quot; In &quot;A Constant Error in Psychological Ratings&quot;, Thorndike asked two commanding officers to evaluate their soldiers in terms of physical qualities (neatness, voice, physique, bearing, and energy), intellect, leadership skills, and personal qualities (including dependability, loyalty, responsibility, selflessness, and cooperation). In Thorndike&#x27;s study, attractiveness plays an important role in how people tend to consider a person, such as whether a person is friendly or not based on their physical appearance. His goal was to see how the ratings of one characteristic affected other characteristics.

Thorndike&#x27;s study showed how there was too great a correlation in the commanding officers&#x27; responses. In his review, he stated, &quot;The correlations are too high and too even. For example, for the three raters next studied[,] the average correlation for physique with intelligence is .31; for physique with leadership, .39; and for physique with character, .28&quot;. The ratings of one of the special qualities of an officer often started a trend in the rating results. The halo effect is not an indication of the existence of a correlation, but instead indicates that the correlation is too high. Thorndike used the halo effect to describe both a positive and negative halo.

In 2023, a large study of 2748 participants found that the same individuals received significantly higher ratings of intelligence, trustworthiness, sociability and happiness after having applied a beauty filter. It found a correlation of .30 for intelligence, .20 for trustworthiness, .39 for sociability and .39 for happiness. However, the study also found that beautified men received significantly higher scores to their perceived intelligence compared to women.

==Cognitive bias==
Cognitive bias is a pattern in perception, interpretation, or judgment that consistently leads to an individual misunderstanding something about themselves or their social environment, leading to poor decision-making or irrational behavior. The halo effect is classified as a cognitive bias because the halo effect is a perception error that distorts the way a person sees someone, and cognitive bias is a perception error that distorts the way that people see themselves.

The term &quot;halo&quot; is used in analogy with the religious concept: a glowing circle crowning the heads of saints in countless medieval and Renaissance paintings, bathing the saint&#x27;s face in heavenly light. The observer may be subject to overestimating the worth of the observed by the presence of a quality that adds light on the whole like a halo. In other words, observers tend to bend their judgement according to one patent characteristic of the person (the &quot;halo&quot;) or a few of his traits, generalizing toward a judgement of that person&#x27;s character (e.g., in the literal hagiologic case, &quot;entirely good and worthy&quot;).

The effect works in both positive and negative directions (and is hence sometimes called the horns and halo effect). If the observer likes one aspect of something, they will have a positive predisposition toward everything about it. If the observer dislikes one aspect of something, they will have a negative predisposition toward everything about it.

==Role of attractiveness==

A person&#x27;s attractiveness has also been found to produce a halo effect. Attractiveness provides a valuable aspect of the halo effect to consider because it can be influenced by several specific traits. These perceptions of attractiveness may affect judgments tied to personality traits. Physical attributes contribute to perceptions of attractiveness (e.g., physique, hair, eye color). For example, someone who is perceived as attractive, due in part to physical traits, may be more likely to be perceived as kind or intelligent. The role of attractiveness in producing the halo effect has been illustrated through a number of studies. Recent research, for example, has revealed that attractiveness may affect perceptions tied to life success and personality. In this study, attractiveness was correlated with weight, indicating that attractiveness itself may be influenced by various specific traits. Included in the personality variables were trustworthiness and friendliness. People perceived as being more attractive were more likely to be perceived as trustworthy and friendly. What this suggests is that perceptions of attractiveness may influence a variety of other traits, which supports the concept of the halo effect.

===On personality===
People&#x27;s first impressions of others influence their later decision to either approach or avoid those individuals. When people first encounter someone, the information present about that individual is limited; therefore, people will use the information available to assume other characteristics about that person; for instance, observable behaviors such as eye contact, leaning forward, smiling and positive hand gestures (ex. steepling hands) are linked to positive emotions, while avoiding eye contact, leaning back, avoiding touch, and defensive hand gestures (ex. hands in pockets) or no gestures at all are linked to feelings of detachment. Besides that, another popular example used when referring to the halo effect is the phenomenon called the &quot;attractiveness stereotype&quot; or when encountering individuals who are similar to others in some aspects, like personality or life history like the school they attended. People tend to assume that physically attractive individuals are more likely to be more healthy, successful, courteous, containing higher moral standards, and greater social competence than other people; on the other hand, the attractiveness stereotype can also carry a negative connotation as some people may think of attractive people as less honest and more conceited than others.

 conducted a study on the relationship between attractiveness and the halo effect. Sixty students, thirty males and thirty females from the University of Minnesota took part in the experiment. Each subject was given three different photos to examine: one of an attractive individual, one of an individual of average attractiveness, and one of an unattractive individual. The participants judged the photos&#x27; subjects along 27 different personality traits (including altruism, conventionality, self-assertiveness, stability, emotionality, trustworthiness, extraversion, kindness, and sexual promiscuity). Participants were then asked to predict the overall happiness the photos&#x27; subjects would feel for the rest of their lives, including marital happiness (least likely to get divorced), parental happiness (most likely to be a good parent), social and professional happiness (most likely to experience life fulfillment), and overall happiness. Finally, participants were asked if the subjects would hold a job of high status, medium status, or low status. Results showed that most of the participants overwhelmingly believed more attractive subjects have more socially desirable personality traits than either averagely attractive or unattractive subjects, would lead happier lives in general, have happier marriages, and have more career success, including holding more secure, prestigious jobs. Participants, however, believed that attractive individuals would be worse parents than both averagely-attractive and unattractive individuals.

===Academics and intelligence===
A study by demonstrated the Halo Effect, looking at male judgments of female intelligence and competence on academic tasks. Sixty male undergraduate students rated the quality of essays which included both well- and poorly-written samples. One third were presented with a photo of an attractive female as author, another third with that of an unattractive female as author, and the last third were shown neither. On average, most of the participants gave significantly better writing evaluations for the more attractive author. On a scale of 1 to 9, the well-written essay by the attractive author received an average of 6.7 while the unattractive author received a 5.9 (with a 6.6 as a control). The gap was larger on the poor essay: the attractive author received an average of 5.2, the control a 4.7, and the unattractive author a 2.7, suggesting male readers are generally more willing to give physically attractive females the benefit of the doubt when performance is below standard than those not considered attractive.

Research conducted by sought residual cues to intelligence in female and male faces while attempting to control for the attractiveness halo effect. Over 300 photographs of Caucasian British college students were rated for perceived intelligence. The photographs that were scored lowest in perceived intelligence were used to create a low-intelligence composite face and those photographs that were scored highest in perceived intelligence were used to create a high-intelligence composite face. Both female and male faces of high- and low-perceived intelligence were created, resulting in four groups of composite faces. Participants for the study were recruited online; 164 female and 92 male heterosexual residents of the UK rated each of the composite faces for intelligence and attractiveness. Of the female composites, attractiveness seemed to be controlled as both the high- and low-perceived intelligence groups were rated as equally attractive. However, of the male face composites, the high-perceived intelligence group was rated as significantly more attractive than the low-perceived intelligence group, suggesting that either the authors could not adequately control for the attractiveness halo effect for the male composite photographs or that intelligence is an integral factor of attractiveness in high-intelligence male faces. The second part of the study found that the composites in the high-perceived intelligence group were rated highest in the factors of &quot;friendly&quot; and &quot;funny&quot; as markers of intelligence in both the female and male groups. While intelligence does not seem to be a factor that contributes to attractiveness in women, with regards to men, attractive faces are perceived to be more intelligent, friendly, and funny by women and men.

===Political effects===
Officeholders who create what &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;a living legacy&quot; benefit from a halo effect when their overall accomplishments are subsequently evaluated.

Researchers have shown that perceived physical and vocal attractiveness (or their opposite) lead to bias in judgment. A 2010 study found that attractiveness and familiarity are strong predictors of decisions regarding who is put in a position of leadership. Judgments made following one-second exposures to side-by-side photos of two US congressional candidates were reasonably predictive of election outcomes. Similar studies found that even when taking factual knowledge into account, candidates who were rated as more attractive were still perceived as more knowledgeable. Thus, beauty evaluations also emerge as major predictors of electoral success.

===The judicial context===
Study results showing the influence of the halo effect in the judicial context exist:
* found subjects were more lenient when sentencing attractive individuals than unattractive ones, even though exactly the same crime was committed. The researchers attributed the result to a societal perception that people with a high level of attractiveness are seen as more likely to have successful futures due to corresponding socially desirable traits.
* studied social workers who were accustomed to interacting with a diverse range of people and found that the majority experienced difficulty when asked to consider that a beautiful person was guilty of a crime.
* A study presented two hypothetical crimes: a burglary and a swindle. The burglary involved a woman illegally obtaining a key and stealing $2,200 (equivalent to $ today); the swindle involved a woman manipulating a man to invest $2,200 in a nonexistent corporation. The results showed that when the offense was not related to attractiveness (as in the burglary) the unattractive defendant was punished more severely than the attractive one. However, when the offense was related to attractiveness (the swindle), the attractive defendant was punished more severely than the unattractive one. The study imputes that the usual leniency given to the attractive woman (as a result of the halo effect) was negated or reversed when the nature of the crime involved her looks.

===Gender differences===
 found that some women were influenced by the halo effect on attractiveness only when presented with members of the opposite sex. continued this line of research, going on to demonstrate that jealousy of an attractive individual has a slight effect in evaluation of that person. These works showed these halo effect more prevalent among females than males. Later research by was able to control for attractiveness in composite photographs of females who were perceived to be of high or low intelligence, while showing that the attractiveness halo effect was seen in high intelligent male composite faces by heterosexual residents of the UK. Either the halo effect is negated by feelings of jealousy in women or the halo effect is lessened when women are looking at same sex individuals or the attractiveness halo effect can be controlled for in women.

===Possible causes===
Rating error effect, mistakes made by raters when they use a rating scale, reflect the task competence of the rater, as well as the rater&#x27;s sex, social position, race, religion, and age. Researchers showed that halo effect is one component of this error. Fisicaro and Lance introduced three explanatory models. The first model named the &quot;general impression model&quot; states that global evaluation affects the rating of individual characteristics. The &quot;salient dimension model&quot; states that how people perceive an individual characteristic affects their evaluation of other characteristics. The &quot;inadequate discrimination model&quot; refers to the rater&#x27;s failure to identify different behaviors of the person being evaluated.

==The reverse halo effect==
The reverse halo effect occurs when positive evaluations of an individual cause negative consequences. Rater errors pose special problems for the issues of &quot;reliability and validity&quot;. Furthermore, ratings that differ in time may accurately reflect a change in behavior even though this difference would demonstrate an artificial lack of reliability. A follow-up study with both men and women participants supported this, as well as showing that attractive women were expected to be conceited and have a higher socioeconomic status. Eagly et al. (1991) also commented on this phenomenon, showing that more attractive individuals of both sexes were expected to be higher in vanity and possibly egotistic. Applied instances of the reverse halo effect include negative evaluations of criminals who use their attractiveness to their advantage and rating a philosophical essay lower when written by a young female than an old male.

==The horn effect==

A negative form of the halo effect, called the horn effect, the devil effect, or the reverse halo effect, allows one a disliked trait or aspect of a person or product to negatively influence globally. Psychologists call it a &quot;bias blind spot:&quot; &quot;Individuals believe (that negative) traits are inter-connected.&quot; due to a negative first impression. &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote of the devil effect in relation to Hugo Chavez: &quot;Some leaders can become so demonized that it&#x27;s impossible to assess their achievements and failures in a balanced way.&quot; For those seen in a negative light, anything they do that is negative is exemplified, while the positive things they do are not seen, or are doubted.

==Education==
 found the halo effect is also present in the classroom. In this study, both regular and special education elementary school teachers watched videotapes of what they believed to be children in regular 4th-grade classrooms. In reality, the children were actors, depicting behaviors present in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), or standard behavior. The teachers were asked to rate the frequency of hyperactive behaviors observed in the children. Teachers rated hyperactive behaviors accurately for children with ADHD; however, the ratings of hyperactivity were much higher for the children with ODD-like behaviors, showing a horn effect for children who appeared to have ODD.

 also found the halo effect present in teachers&#x27; evaluations of children. Regular and special education elementary school teachers watched videos of a normal child whom they were told was either &quot;emotionally disturbed&quot;, possessing a learning disorder, &quot;mentally retarded&quot;, or &quot;normal&quot;. The teachers then completed referral forms based on the child&#x27;s behavior. The results showed that teachers held negative expectancies toward emotionally disturbed children, maintaining these expectancies even when presented with normal behavior. In addition, the &quot;mentally retarded&quot; label showed a greater degree of negative bias than the &quot;emotionally disturbed&quot; or &quot;learning disabled&quot; label.

===Observations===
&quot;In the classroom, teachers are subject to the halo effect rating error when evaluating their students. For example, a teacher who sees a well-behaved student might tend to assume this student is also bright, diligent, and engaged before that teacher has objectively evaluated the student&#x27;s capacity in these areas. When these types of halo effects occur, they can affect students&#x27; approval ratings in certain areas of functioning and can even affect students&#x27; grades.&quot;

&quot;In the work setting, the halo effect is most likely to show up in a supervisor&#x27;s appraisal of a subordinate&#x27;s job performance. In fact, the halo effect is probably the most common bias in performance appraisal. Think about what happens when a supervisor evaluates the performance of a subordinate. The supervisor may give prominence to a single characteristic of the employee, such as enthusiasm, and allow the entire evaluation to be colored by how he or she judges the employee on that one characteristic. Even though the employee may lack the requisite knowledge or ability to perform the job successfully, if the employee&#x27;s work shows enthusiasm, the supervisor may very well give him or her a higher performance rating than is justified by knowledge or ability.&quot;

==Further research findings==
 argue: &quot;Since 1980, there have been a large number of studies dealing directly or indirectly with halo error in rating. Taken together, these studies suggest that all seven of the characteristics that have defined halo error for much of its history are problematic and that the assumptions that underlie some of them are demonstrably wrong.&quot; Their work claims that the assumption that the halo effect is always detrimental is incorrect, with some halo effects resulting in an increase in the accuracy of the rating, in their opinion. Additionally, they discuss the idea of &quot;true halo&quot;—the actual correlation between, for example, attractiveness and performance as an instructor—and &quot;illusory halo&quot; that refers to cognitive distortions, errors in observation and judgement, and the rating tendencies of the individual rater. They claim that any true differentiation between true and illusory halos is impossible in a real-world setting, because the different ratings are strongly influenced by the specific behaviors of the person observed by the raters.

A study by states that one&#x27;s mood can affect the degree of the halo effect&#x27;s influence. When someone is in a favorable mood, the halo effect is more likely to be influential—this was demonstrated by study participants choosing between pictures of an elderly man with a beard and a young woman, and deciding which subject possessed more philosophical attributes. Additionally, when asked to list the happy, neutral, or negative times in their life, the halo effect was more evident in the perceptions of the participants who chose to write about happy prior experiences. Forgas&#x27;s study suggests that when one is gauging the extent of the halo effect in a situation, one must consider the emotional state of the person making the judgment.

A 2013 report on &quot;the link between disease and leader preferences&quot; claimed that &quot;congressional districts with a higher incidence of disease&quot; were more likely to show a halo effect &quot;on electoral outcomes.&quot;

<text>Barb Audiences Ltd (formerly Broadcasters Audience Research Board) is a British organisation that compiles audience measurement and television ratings in the United Kingdom. It was created in 1981 to replace two previous systems whereby ITV ratings were compiled by JICTAR (Joint Industry Committee for Television Audience Research), whilst the BBC did their own audience research.

BARB is jointly owned by the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5, Sky and the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising. Participating viewers have a box on top of their TV sets which tracks the programmes they watch.

In February 2023, Barb changed its company name to Barb Audiences Ltd (formerly Broadcasters&#x27; Audience Research Board).

==Business==
Currently, BARB have approximately 5,100 homes (equating to approximately 12,000 individuals) participating in the panel. This means that with a total UK population of 65,648,100, according to the 2016 census, each viewer with a BARB reporting box represents over 5,000 people. The box records exactly what programmes they watch, and the panelists indicate who is in the room watching by pressing a button on a remote control handset. The data is collected overnight and published as overnight ratings at around 9.30 the following morning for use by TV stations and the advertising industry. The following week, final figures are released which are a combination of the overnight figures with &quot;time-shift&quot; figures (people recording a programme and watching it within a week). For programmes from 15 December 2014, onwards, BARB has begun publishing viewing figures for a period of 28 days after the original broadcast.

BARB numbers are extremely important to commercial television stations. The trading model that is used by television companies and advertising agencies depends on the number of people watching the shows, and the commercial attractiveness of those people. The advertising agency will pay the television station a certain amount of money based on the number of people watching a show. The BARB numbers are used to work this out. Higher BARB numbers usually mean more advertising revenue for the television station.

This leads to some interesting situations on the smaller channels. Since there are many television stations, and many hours in the day, there can be situations where BARB will record zero viewers for certain programmes. As the TV advertising system is geared round BARB ratings all but the very smallest channels subscribe to BARB.

The BARB publishes inter alia Weekly Top 10 Charts, a Weekly Viewing Summary for programmes or the use of programme genres.

==Data gathering==

BARB&#x27;s 2010 research contracts were awarded to three different market research companies: RSMB, Ipsos MORI, and Kantar Media. The contracts ran from January 2010 to the end of 2015, with an option to extend further.

RSMB are responsible for survey design, quality control and calculation methodology. Ipsos MORI&#x27;s role is to survey the characteristics of the television owning population, including an element of direct recruitment to the viewing panel. Kantar Media is responsible for establishing and maintaining the new BARB viewing panel. It has a separate contract covering meter panel installation, data retrieval, processing and audience reporting functions.

<doc id="673298" wikidata="Q207518" url="?curid=673298" title="Flag of Northern Cyprus">
<text>The flag of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus () is the national flag of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and is based on the flag of Turkey, with the colors reversed and two additional horizontal red stripes at the top and bottom. The flag was drawn by the Turkish Cypriot artist Emin Çizenel. It was adopted in 1984 by Northern Cyprus, a self-declared state that is recognized only by Turkey, after its unilateral declaration of independence in 1983.

Although there is no official statement on the meaning of the flag, it can be interpreted as the star and crescent meaning Turkishness, the red color representing the blood of the Turkish Cypriots, and the stripes indicating Turkey (top) and Northern Cyprus (bottom). Before the current flag, the flag of Turkey was used.

The country&#x27;s flag is officially determined by its law, and it has several other laws that specify where and when the flag should be flown and also laws against insulting or burning of the flag. It can also be flown at half-mast, commonly to commemorate Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, founding father and first President of Turkey, but also in case if the premiership issues an order to do so. Several of these laws also apply to the flag of Turkey, which has official status in the country.

On the side of Beşparmaklar Mountain, in the Kyrenia Mountains, there is a wide flag of Northern Cyprus along with a star and crescent and the quotation &quot;How happy is the one who says I am a Turk&quot;.

== Design and symbolism ==
The flag of Northern Cyprus was defined in Article 2 of the Flag Law of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus under these terms: &quot;The flag of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus has, under the conditions defined by law, a red star and crescent on a white background and two longitudinal lines&quot;.

There aren&#x27;t any official statements about the meaning of the flag. An interpretation is that the star and crescent represent Turkishness, red representing the blood of Turkish Cypriots killed in Cypriot intercommunal violence, white representing peace, the upper line representing Turkey, the bottom line representing Northern Cyprus and the horizontality of the lines represents that &quot;The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus will last forever&quot;.

In 2019, the flag became the subject of a conspiracy theory falsely claiming it was designed by Necmettin Erbakan and that the upper line represents the Nile, and the bottom one represents the Euphrates while the star and crescent mean the &quot;land between the Nile and the Euphrates will not be for Zionists as long as Turkey exists&quot;. The theory was based on allegations claiming two blue stripes on the flag of Israel represent the Nile and Euphrates rivers and allege that Israel desires to eventually seize all the land in between.

=== Dimensions ===

Note that the proportions are, except for the added stripes, exactly the same that the Turkish national flag, presumably on purpose.
===Color scheme===

== History ==

=== Previous flags ===

The Turkish Federated State of Cyprus was formed on 13 February 1975 and existed until 15 October 1983, when the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus was established. TFSC didn&#x27;t mention a flag in its constitution.

3 days after the declaration of independence of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, a self-declared state that is recognized only by Turkey, on 18 November 1983, the Council of Ministers of Northern Cyprus discussed the flag of the new state. It was decided to use the flag of Cyprus with the flag of Turkey placed in the canton (upper left). However, the design was never used. According to an article in the &quot;Flag Bulletin,&quot; for the first four months of its existence, the flag of Turkey was used as the official flag of Northern Cyprus.

=== Current flag ===
On 23 November 1983, the government officially called for a new flag for the country and asked for flag suggestions from all citizens, establishments and foundations being 3 December 1983 the deadline. The design drawn by Turkish Cypriot artist Emin Çizenel was accepted and it was officially adopted as the flag of Northern Cyprus on 7 March 1984 by Law No.15 of constitution of Northern Cyprus. Flag Law of Northern Cyprus was adopted the same day. The Official Gazette published the flag on 9 March 1984. Even though there wasn&#x27;t a promised prize, on 9 March 1984 Emin Çizenel received the award of TL100,000, which was the same amount given to Mehmet Akif Ersoy for writing İstiklal Marşı (national anthem of Turkey and Northern Cyprus) in 1921.

=== Proposed national flag ===

The Annan Plan was a United Nations proposal to restructure the Republic of Cyprus as a federation of two states under the name of &quot;United Republic of Cyprus&quot; to settle the Cyprus dispute. A Spanish fess flag made up of three white fimbriated blue, red and orange-yellow lines were chosen for the federation by a committee of Greek and Turkish Cypriots in early March 2004. The current flag of Northern Cyprus was planned to be used as the flag for the Turkish Cypriot State of the federation.

The blue stripe represented Greeks while the red stripe represented Turks, two major ethnic groups in Cyprus and the orange-yellow stripe represented copper, from which the island may have received its name. The meaning of white fimbriation wasn&#x27;t officially stated but an interpretation is that it represented peace between the two communities.

In a 2004 referendum, the plan was accepted by 65% of Turkish Cypriots but 76% of Greek Cypriots opposed it, therefore the plan was not put into place.

=== List ===
== Protocol ==
Article 2 of the Constitution of Northern Cyprus states that the flag of the country is prescribed by law. According to Article 3 of the Flag Law of Northern Cyprus, &quot;The flag of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus shall be flown from buildings occupied by the Security Forces, by Government Departments, from the premises of public institutions and establishments, from the premises of the people&#x27;s representatives abroad and vessels owned by persons and corporate bodies and it shall be displayed on motor cars, in and outside the country, of persons authorized by regulations to display the flag on their motor cars&quot;.

=== Outlawed actions ===
Article 10 of the Flag Law of Northern Cyprus outlaws tearing, burning, removing it from its location with a purpose of insult and throwing down flags of both Northern Cyprus and Turkey. The same article also outlaws the insult either &quot;by words, writings, actions or any other manner&quot; of the flag of Northern Cyprus and Turkey. Article 11 punishes such actions with up to 9 years of imprisonment and/or a fine of TL100,000 if they were carried out on purpose.

=== Half-mast ===
The flag of Northern Cyprus is flown at half-mast throughout the country every 10 November in memory of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, founding father of the Republic of Turkey who died on 10 November 1938. At other times, the premiership may issue an order for the flag to be flown at half-mast. Notable dates of half-mast in Northern Cyprus include 7 November 2006 due to the death of Bülent Ecevit, Prime Minister of Turkey at the time of the Turkish Invasion of Cyprus, 14–20 January 2012 due to the death of Rauf Denktaş, founding president of Northern Cyprus, 15–16 May 2014 due to the Soma mine disaster, 22–24 July 2014 due to the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, 11–13 October 2015 due to the 2015 Ankara bombings, 29 July 2016 due to the 2016 Atatürk Airport attack and 11 December 2016 due to the December 2016 Istanbul bombings.

==Kyrenia Mountain Range==

A wide North Cypriot flag image was drawn on the side of Beşparmaklar Mountain (Mount Pentadaktylos &quot;Five Fingers&quot; in Greek), in the Kyrenia Mountains, facing south (). The star and crescent, a national emblem of Turkey, and the quotation &quot;Ne mutlu türküm diyene&quot; (&quot;How happy is the one who says I am a Turk&quot;), a motto of Kemalism, is written next to it. Located on the northern side of the green line in the divided capital Nicosia, it is widely visible in the south. An early version was made in the 1980s with stones; now teams from Turkey maintain the coloring with dyes.

=== Criticism ===
In 2010, Antigoni Papadopoulou, a Greek Cypriot Member of the European Parliament, submitted an official written question about the mountain flag to the EU Commission. The complaint framed it as an environmental hazard because of the chemical substances employed, and a waste of energy for the thousands of lights used to illuminate it at night. It also described the flag, first lit up on the Greek National Day, 28 October 2003, as an &quot;unprecedented daily provocation&quot; and a &quot;hostile action&quot;, and requested that sanctions be imposed on Turkey for its conduct. The commission promised to launch an investigation into the environmental impact but declined to comment on the political aspects.

<text>Bischofswerda (; ) is a small town in eastern Germany at the western edge of Upper Lusatia in Saxony.

==Geography==


The town is located 33 km to the east of Dresden at the edge of the Upper Lusatian mountain country. The town is known as the &quot;Gateway to Upper Lusatia&quot; – &quot;Tor zur Oberlausitz&quot; in German. Located in the district of Bautzen, the town is 18 km west of Bautzen itself. Großdrebnitz is among its quarters. The river Wesenitz flows through the town.

==History==
The first documentary evidence of the existence of Bischofswerda dates from 1227. Nominally the town was founded by the Bishops of Meissen, though it may have existed before that point. In 1288 city walls were constructed. The first mention of Bischofswerda as a city is in a document dating from 1361. The town remained under the authority of the Bishops of Meissen until 1559 when power was transferred to Augustus, Elector of Saxony, who introduced Protestantism. The city arms are based on a 14th-century seal and consist of two crossed bishop&#x27;s croziers and four stars. The significance of the stars is not known. One of two main routes connecting Warsaw and Dresden ran through the town in the 18th century and Kings Augustus II the Strong and Augustus III of Poland often traveled that route.

Like many late medieval towns, Bischofswerda suffered from periodic fires that damaged the town. Fires are recorded in 1429, 1469, 1528, 1583, 1596, 1641, 1671 and 1813. The last fire was the worst. During the War of the Sixth Coalition, Napoleonic forces had occupied Bischofswerda when a fire broke out within the town walls on 12 May 1813, destroying most of the medieval town. However the town was rebuilt on an order of Frederick Augustus I of Saxony in a manner closely following the earlier layout, and this remains to this day.

During the increased tensions of the 1980s between the Western democracies and the Eastern Communist Bloc, Bischofswerda became a base for Soviet SS-12 nuclear missiles. A depot for the missiles and their launchers was built just outside town. The missiles were withdrawn in 1988.

The following table indicates Bischofwerda&#x27;s population at different times:

==Sights==
Among the most impressive buildings are the town hall and the &quot;Christuskirche&quot;. Both are examples of neo-classical architecture and were designed by Gottlob Friedrich Thormeyer. The town hall (Rathaus) was constructed in 1818, just off the Altmarkt, the centre of the town. The entrance to the Christuskirche is decorated by a mosaic by Josef Goller. In the interior one can find a painting by Osmar Schindler, who grew up in the town. The Catholic church is named after Saint Benno of Meissen, who is said to have founded Bischofswerda in the 11th century.

==Economy and transport==
Before the reunification of Germany in 1990, Bischofswerda was a significant industrial location. The company Fortschritt produced agricultural machines. This manufacture as well as the glass fabrication has closed. The textile industry had a centuries-long tradition in the town, but also ended in 2012.

New industries began to settle in Bischofswerda in recent years. Roth Industries, a German enterprise from the environmental technology sector, has a subsidiary here. The Canadian producer of solar cells, ARISE Technologies, came to the town, but has closed.
The town is situated on the &quot;Bundesstraße 6&quot;, which connects Dresden and Görlitz at the Polish border. The Bundesautobahn 4 bypasses the town 6 km north, enabling easy access to Dresden Airport. The road traffic bypasses the town in the west. Via Bischofswerda railway station, direct access by rail is possible to Dresden, Görlitz, Zittau as well as to Czech Liberec.

==Culture and sports==
The little town became known nationally when the local football club BSG Fortschritt Bischofswerda, sponsored by Fortschritt, twice reached the DDR-Oberliga, the highest football league in East Germany. Today, a modern open air bath and Saxony&#x27;s littlest zoo can be noted. Regularly, the local festival &quot;Schiebocker Tage&quot; and a Karl May festival are organized.

<doc id="673305" wikidata="Q3645480" url="?curid=673305" title="2000 Mexican general election">
<text>General elections were held in Mexico on Sunday, 2 July 2000. Voters went to the polls to elect a new president to serve a single six-year term, replacing President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de León, who was ineligible for re-election under the 1917 Constitution. The election system ran under plurality voting; 500 members of the Chamber of Deputies (300 by the first-past-the-post system and 200 by proportional representation) for three-year terms and 128 members of the Senate (three per state by first-past-the-post – two first-past-the-post seats are allocated to the party with the largest share of the vote; the remaining seat is given to the first runner-up – and 32 by proportional representation from national party lists) for six-year terms.

The presidential election was won by Vicente Fox of the Alliance for Change, who received 43.4% of the vote, the first time the opposition had won an election since the Mexican Revolution. In the congressional elections the Alliance for Change emerged as the largest faction in the Chamber of Deputies with 224 of the 500 seats, whilst the Institutional Revolutionary Party remained the largest faction in the Senate with 60 of the 128 seats in the Senate. Voter turnout was between 63 and 64% in the elections.

This historically significant election made Fox the first president elected from an opposition party since Francisco I. Madero in 1911, as well as the first in 71 years to defeat, with 43 percent of the vote, the then-dominant Institutional Revolutionary Party.

==Primary elections==
===Institutional Revolutionary Party===
President Ernesto Zedillo sought to break away from the 71-year-old PRI succession ritual, so the PRI conducted an unprecedented internal process to choose its presidential candidate for the 2000 elections. The president declared, &quot;The so-called &quot;dedazo&quot; is dead&quot;; &quot;dedazo&quot; being the term used to refer to the president personally choosing his successor, which roughly translates to &quot;handpicking&quot;. 

Francisco Labastida Ochoa, Humberto Roque Villanueva, Manuel Bartlett and Roberto Madrazo were the pre-candidates. Despite the president&#x27;s statement, there was still a sense that Labastida was most likely to become the official candidate due to being the closest to President Zedillo.

Madrazo&#x27;s confrontation with Labastida during the election was notable, as was Madrazo&#x27;s &quot;challenging&quot; stance toward Zedillo, exemplified by his campaign slogan, &quot;Dale un Madrazo al dedazo&quot; (&quot;Give a Madrazo to the &quot;dedazo&quot;&quot;, though it could also be translated as &quot;Give a blow to the handpicking&quot;).

On 7 November 1999 the primary election was held, and widespread reports of fraudulent tactics were present. Nevertheless, Madrazo accepted the election&#x27;s outcome and rejoined the Tabasco government following a meeting with Labastida in Los Pinos, where Zedillo intervened to stop Madrazo from breaking with the PRI. On 20 November Labastida was declared the PRI candidate.

===National Action Party===
The former Guanajuato governor Vicente Fox Quesada was the only person to seek the National Action Party nomination and was ratified by the party. Pedro Cerisola was his general campaign coordinator.

===Party of the Democratic Revolution===
Porfirio Muñoz Ledo and Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas declared their interest in being candidates for the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), a contest that ended with Muñoz Ledo&#x27;s dismissal from the party. According to Muñoz Ledo it was inevitable that the same person would run for office a third time if there was no &quot;true democratic process&quot; in the PRD. Muñoz Ledo was later confirmed as the candidate for the Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution and Cárdenas was designated as the PRD candidate.

== Campaign ==
On 27 April 2000 PAN candidate Vicente Fox sent a letter containing ten points to the apostolic nuncio Leonardo Sandri and the Conference of the Mexican Episcopate, outlining the measures he pledged to take on behalf of the Catholic Church and other Christian churches should he win the presidency. These included advocating for &quot;respect for the right to life from the moment of conception,&quot; granting churches access to the media, granting free admission to public health centers, prisons, orphanages and nursing homes for priests and other ministers of worship, standardizing seminary coursework with public institution coursework, in addition to giving churches a unique tax system and allowing them to deduct taxes &quot;when they contribute to human development.&quot;

Fox reaffirmed his strong religious stance and identified himself as a devout Catholic. Even though Fox had finally won the presidency, the promises he made to the churches in that letter were not kept given that the PAN failed to secure an absolute majority in the Congress of the Union.

==Opinion polls==
PRI candidate Francisco Labastida led in nearly all the polls throughout the first months of the campaign, although in the final two months his lead grew smaller; on the other hand, PAN candidate Vicente Fox was at second place in most of the polls, but in May and June his percentage of supporters increased and he led in many of the final polls.

Given that the overwhelming majority of the polls failed to predict Fox&#x27;s victory and instead had indicated that Labastida would win by comfortable margins, it has been asserted that many of those polled lied about their preferences, fearing that if they stated support for an opposition party, they would be stripped of the government assistance programs they were receiving by the PRI. The &quot;Reforma&quot; newspaper, which had predicted a Labastida victory in every poll they published during the campaign, attributed their mistake to the so-called &quot;fear factor&quot;.

==Conduct==

Some isolated incidents of irregularities and problems were reported. For example, one irregularity in the southern state of Campeche involved the European Union electoral observer Rocco Buttiglione and could have created problems for President Ernesto Zedillo had the PRI candidate won. Overall, however, electoral observers identified little evidence that those incidents were centrally coordinated (as opposed to led by local PRI officials), and critics concluded that those irregularities which did occur did not materially alter the outcome of the presidential vote, which had been more definitive than expected.

Civic organizations fielded more than 80,000 trained electoral observers, foreign observers were invited to witness the process, and numerous &quot;quick count&quot; operations and exit polls (not all of them independent) validated the official vote tabulation. The largest exit poll was organized by the U.S. firm Penn, Schoen &amp; Berland, financed by a Dallas-based organization called Democracy Watch with the support of the Vicente Fox campaign, who were concerned about possible election fraud.

Numerous electoral reforms implemented after the widely-derided and fraudulent 1988 election opened up the Mexican political system, and since then opposition parties have made historic gains in elections at all levels. The chief electoral concerns shifted from outright fraud to campaign fairness issues and, between 1995 and 1996, the political parties negotiated constitutional amendments to address these issues. The legislation implemented included major points of consensus that had been worked out with the opposition parties. Under the new laws, public financing predominated over private contributions to political parties, procedures for auditing parties were tightened, and the authority and independence of the electoral institutions were strengthened. The court system was also given greatly expanded authority to hear civil rights cases on electoral matters brought by individuals or groups. In short, the extensive reform efforts of the 1990s &quot;leveled the playing field&quot; for the parties.

==Results==
===President===
====By state====
====Voter demographics====
===Senate===
===Chamber of Deputies===
==Aftermath==
On election night, exit polls and preliminary results from the Federal Electoral Institute quickly proclaimed PAN candidate Vicente Fox winner. PRI candidate Francisco Labastida then headed to his party&#x27;s headquarters to give his concession speech, but just minutes before he was to speak, a message from President Ernesto Zedillo was broadcast on national TV, in which the President himself acknowledged Fox&#x27;s victory and congratulated him. The fact that the concession first came from the President instead of his party&#x27;s candidate later caused tensions between Zedillo and Labastida. Fox was sworn-in as president on 1 December, ending 71 years of PRI rule.

23 years later, in 2023, Labastida accused Zedillo of having sabotaged his presidential campaign, stating that Zedillo called three state governors to threaten them and make Labastida&#x27;s campaign fail, since Zedillo wanted to hand the presidency over to the opposition party PAN in order to go down in history as a democrat who willingly gave up his party&#x27;s 71-year hold on the presidency.

<doc id="673306" wikidata="Q2476568" url="?curid=673306" title="Night of the Ghouls">
<text>Night of the Ghouls is a horror film written and directed by Ed Wood. The film was shot between April and May 1958. The film features some reoccurring cast members and characters from Wood&#x27;s 1955 &quot;Bride of the Monster&quot;, including Tor Johnson reprising his role of Lobo and Paul Marco again playing the character of Kelton the cop, while the Amazing Criswell plays himself in the frame story of the film. Another returning character is Police Captain Robbins of Homicide, although the character was played by Harvey B. Dunn in &quot;Bride of the Monster&quot;, and by Johnny Carpenter in &quot;Night of the Ghouls&quot;.

==Plot==

At the beginning, Criswell rises from a coffin and narrates the events of the film. Then a montage starts showing juvenile delinquency, street fighting, and driving under the influence. The sequence ends with the bloody corpse of the drunk driver staring blankly at the camera. According to Criswell&#x27;s narration, this is a rather typical end to &quot;a drunken holiday weekend&quot;.

The film then cuts to a teenaged couple kissing in a convertible. When the boy gets too demanding, the girl slaps him and exits the car. The Black Ghost, an undead creature that lurks in the woods near them, later kills the young couple. The murders receive press attention but are thought to be the work of a maniac.

In a police station of East Los Angeles, California, Inspector Robbins waits for Detective Bradford at his office. Bradford soon arrives, dressed in a formal evening wear. He was called to work while on his way to the opera, and he protests the idea of working an unexpected assignment. But Robbins informs him that the case involves the &quot;old house on Willows lake&quot;, which played a part in an earlier case investigated by Bradford. The house was destroyed by lightning, but someone rebuilt it. A flashback scene establishes that the elderly Edwards couple had a terrifying encounter with the White Ghost by this house. Having heard the story, Bradford accepts the assignment to investigate the old house. Robbins assigns Kelton to escort the Detective. Kelton has previously dealt with the supernatural in the events depicted in &quot;Bride of the Monster&quot; and &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot;.

Bradford drives to the house and enters through an open door, to be confronted by Dr. Acula, who is dressed in a turban and cryptically mentions that there are many already in the house, both living and dead. Bradford convinces Acula that he is just another prospective client, so his entrance is accepted. One of &quot;the many&quot; in the house is a remnant of its past, Lobo. A character from &quot;Bride of the Monster&quot;, Lobo is depicted as disfigured from the flames which once destroyed this house. Outside the house, Kelton arrives late and has brief encounters with both the Black Ghost and the White Ghost. Meanwhile, at a séance, Acula and his clients share the table with human skeletons. Dr. Acula turns out to be a fake psychic by the name of &quot;Karl&quot;, as Bradford suspected earlier, and reveals that the White Ghost is an actress named Sheila. Her role is to scare away intruders. She is concerned by the presence of the Black Ghost which is not part of their hoax, though the cynical Acula dismisses her fears — he does not believe in the supernatural.

Both Bradford and Kelton have strange and sometimes violent confrontations within the house, and are eventually joined by reinforcements. As their accomplices fall to the police, Karl and Sheila attempt to escape through a mortuary room. There they are confronted by a group of undead men. Among them is Criswell, who is the only one that can speak, who explains to Karl that the supposedly &quot;fake&quot; psychic does have genuine powers and his necromantic efforts actually work. These dead men were restored to life, if only for a few hours, but they intend to take Karl with them in their return to the grave. As Karl dies, Sheila escapes the house to meet her own fate. The Black Ghost, genuinely undead, takes control of the impostor and tells her that it is time to join &quot;the others&quot; at the grave. As the police try to understand what happened to the deceased Karl, we see an undead Sheila, now truly a White Ghost.

In a brief epilogue, the narrator returns to his coffin. Claiming that it is time for both the old dead and the new to return to their graves, he reminds the viewer that they too can soon join them in death.

==Production and analysis==
Rob Craig suggests that the film could be in part based on an earlier work, &quot;Sucker Money&quot; (1933), produced by Willis Kent. The two films have significant similarities in concept. In the earlier film, Swami Yomurda (Mischa Auer) and his minions stage an elaborate scheme to extort money from gullible victims. Yomurda and his group use technological means to convince their victims that they are receiving audiovisual from the otherworld. Craig himself, however, notes that &quot;Night of the Ghouls&quot; cannot be conceived as a straightforward remake, since Wood used the same template to tell a quite different story from the 1930s melodrama.

There are also notable similarities of this film with one of its contemporaries, &quot;The Unearthly&quot; (1957) by Boris Petroff. In both films the characters gather at an isolated location far from the city, a charismatic deceiver exploits other humans for his own purposes, promising them extraordinary services, undercover agents of the law manage to expose the conspiracies, and the villains meet their fates at the hands of someone they previously exploited. Tor Johnson also plays a character called &quot;Lobo&quot; in both films, and both of the Lobo characters are monstrous manservants working for the main villains. Both films were shot around the same time, though it is unclear if one was intentionally modeled after the other.

The notion of a genuine ghost and a fake one that are active on the same area is not unique to this film. &quot;The Ghost Breakers&quot; (1940) has a real ghost appear in the end, &quot;Spook Chasers&quot; (1957) has a real ghost among several fakes, and &quot;Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow&quot; (1959) has a real ghost residing in a &quot;fake&quot; haunted house.

Craig considers the film to have elements common in absurdist fiction, and also to have much of the pessimism and nihilism of a typical Samuel Beckett play. The opening montage of violence and the death of the drunk driver serve to underscore both the randomness and the lack of meaning of human life and death. The fates of Karl and Sheila are clearly meant to serve as a form of poetic justice, and the finale can also be seen as a triumph of Death over the mortals trying to exploit it. The final words of Criswell also serve to remind viewers of the truth, that everyone dies and that Death is destined to triumph over Life. Craig finds the film to be Wood&#x27;s version of a requiem.

The film makes extensive use of static two shot, which David Hogan considered to have contributed to making this an &quot;atypically boring&quot; film by Wood. The film&#x27;s main setting is the rebuilt house on Willows Lake that burned down in &quot;Bride of the Monster&quot;. There are frequent references to the mad scientist (Bela Lugosi) and Lobo (Tor Johnson), the latter of whom returns, his face now half-destroyed from the fire. The narrative notion that the house by Willow Lake is a recently reconstructed building is contradicted by the actual appearance of the house, which seems to be old and in disrepair. Craig suggests that the house would not look out of place in a Hooverville.

The formal-wearing police investigator seems a rather anachronistic figure, more reminiscent of a figure from a gothic fiction work or a costume drama. Valda Hansen, who plays the White Ghost, was seen as Wood&#x27;s ingenue. She had reportedly impressed him with her vivacity and allure. David Hogan considered the spookiest scenes to be the ones featuring either Hansen or Jeannie Stevens, playing the film&#x27;s ghostly femmes fatales.

Wood, his face hidden by a dark veil, doubled for the Black Ghost in several shots. According to actor Paul Marco, Wood could not get Jeannie Stevens to film these scenes. So he wore the costume and acted as her stand-in. Also, a publicity photo of Wood is seen on a wanted poster on the wall of the police station.

Tom Mason, who doubled for Bela Lugosi in &quot;Plan 9 From Outer Space&quot; appeared in &quot;Night of the Ghouls&quot; as one of the undead, while his wife Margaret Mason played the role of &quot;Martha&quot; (the woman in the car frightened by the White Ghost). In 1992, Margaret Mason was one of the people interviewed for the Ed Wood documentary &quot;Flying Saucers Over Hollywood: The Plan Nine Companion&quot;.

The séances featured in the film have some atypical elements. Skulls are set on the séance table and skeletons are sitting around it. The sound effects and floating trumpet would not be out of place in a 19th-century séance, though the electronically altered voice of the deceased is a far more modern element.

This film is the third part of what Wood aficionados refer to as &quot;The Kelton Trilogy&quot;, a trio of films featuring Paul Marco as &quot;Officer Kelton&quot;, a whining, reluctant policeman. The other two films were &quot;Bride of the Monster&quot; and &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot;. Although said to be a sequel to &quot;Bride of the Monster&quot;, &quot;Night of the Ghouls&quot; featured only two characters from that film (Kelton and Lobo), and, in a retcon, it is claimed that Lt. Bradford had worked on the earlier case when he in fact did not appear in &quot;Bride of the Monster&quot;. His exploration of Dr. Acula&#x27;s house was borrowed from Wood&#x27;s short film &quot;Final Curtain&quot; and voice-over narration was added to integrate it into the story. As a result, there was no room for Harvey B. Dunn, who played Captain Tom Robbins in &quot;Bride of the Monster&quot;, to reprise his earlier role. Instead, he was given a small supporting role as a frightened motorist who encounters one of the &quot;ghouls&quot;. Wood must have written the screenplay for this film before 1956, as he originally planned to star Bela Lugosi in it.

==Release==
&quot;Night of the Ghouls&quot; was originally to be called &quot;Revenge of the Dead&quot;. A December 1958 article about cast member Valda Hansen described the film as being &quot;soon to be released&quot;. A contemporary article in &quot;Famous Monsters of Filmland&quot; referred to the soon-to-be-released film as &quot;Night of the Ghouls&quot;. Paul Marco recalled in an interview that the film had a preview screening in 1959 at the Vista Theatre in Hollywood. He said that after watching it on the big screen, Wood felt it needed further editing. A 1959 letter from Wood to Anthony Cardoza, the film&#x27;s associate producer, records some of Wood&#x27;s plans to re-edit the film, including removing some of Criswell&#x27;s scenes and replacing them with some Bela Lugosi archive footage, as well as a possible title change. Wood, however, was never able to make the changes since the film&#x27;s ownership remained under the control of the lab.

Years later, Kansas City film hobbyist-entrepreneur and Ed Wood fan Wade Williams managed to locate the film, paid the long overdue bills to the lab, and claimed full ownership of it. He also gave it its first home video release via VHS in 1984. This was the film&#x27;s world premiere.

==Critical reception==
Writing in AllMovie, critic Bruce Eder reported that the film has &quot;the strangeness, in the dialogue and characterizations, that one expects from one of Wood&#x27;s movies,&quot; that &quot;the edges of Wood&#x27;s budget show more than ever, both onscreen and even in the music,&quot; and that it &quot;isn&#x27;t nearly as diverting [as] &quot;Plan 9 From Outer Space&quot;.&quot; Film critic Glenn Erickson wrote in DVD Talk, &quot;Of course it&#x27;s terrible,&quot; that &quot;the acting is bad,&quot; and that compared to other films by Wood, &quot;it&#x27;s fairly coherent but more than a little boring, populated by less interesting characters than usual.&quot;

<text>VTEC (described as &quot;Variable Valve Timing &amp; Lift Electronic Control&quot;, but stands for &quot;Valve Timing Electronically Controlled&quot;) is a system developed by Honda to improve the volumetric efficiency of a four-stroke internal combustion engine, resulting in higher performance at high RPM, and lower fuel consumption at low RPM. The VTEC system uses two (or occasionally three) camshaft profiles and hydraulically selects between profiles. It was invented by Honda engineer Ikuo Kajitani. It is distinctly different from standard VVT (variable valve timing) systems which change only the valve timings and do not change the camshaft profile or valve lift in any way.

== Context and description ==

Japan levies a tax based on engine displacement, and Japanese auto manufacturers have correspondingly focused their research and development efforts toward improving the performance of their smaller engine designs. One method for increasing performance into a static displacement includes forced induction, as with models such as the Toyota Supra and Nissan 300ZX, which used turbocharger applications, and the Toyota MR2, which used a supercharger for some model years. Another approach is the rotary engine used in the Mazda RX-7 and RX-8. A third option is to change the cam timing profile, of which Honda VTEC was the first successful commercial design for altering the profile in real time.

The VTEC system provides the engine with valve timing optimized for both low- and high-RPM operations. In basic form, the single cam lobe and follower/rocker arm of a conventional engine is replaced with a locking multi-part rocker arm and two cam profiles: one optimized for low-RPM stability and fuel efficiency, and the other designed to maximize high-RPM power output. The switching operation between the two cam lobes is controlled by the ECU, which takes account of engine oil pressure, engine temperature, vehicle speed, engine speed, and throttle position. Using these inputs, the ECU is programmed to switch from the low-lift to the high-lift cam lobes when certain conditions are met. At the switch point, a solenoid is actuated that allows oil pressure from a spool valve to operate a locking pin, which binds the high-RPM rocker arm to the low-RPM ones. From this point on, the valves open and close according to the high-lift profile, which opens the valve further and for a longer time. The switch-over point is variable, between a minimum and maximum point, and is determined by engine load. The switch-down back from high- to low-RPM cams is set to occur at a lower engine speed than the switch-up (representing a hysteretic cycle) to avoid a situation in which the engine is asked to operate continuously at or around the switch-over point.

The older approach to timing adjustments is to produce a camshaft with a valve timing profile that is better suited to low-RPM operation. The improvements in low-RPM performance, which is where most street-driven automobiles operate a majority of the time, occur in trade for a power and efficiency loss at higher-RPM ranges. Correspondingly, VTEC attempts to combine low-RPM fuel efficiency and stability with high-RPM performance.

== History ==
VTEC, the original Honda variable valve control system, originated from REV (Revolution-Modulated Valve Control) introduced on the CBR400 in 1983 known as HYPER VTEC. In the regular four-stroke automobile engine, the intake and exhaust valves are actuated by lobes on a camshaft. The shape of the lobes determines the timing, lift and duration of each valve. Timing refers to an angle measurement of when a valve is opened or closed with respect to the piston position (BTDC or ATDC). Lift refers to how much the valve is opened. Duration refers to how long the valve is kept open. Due to the behavior of the working fluid (air and fuel mixture) before and after combustion, which have physical limitations on their flow, as well as their interaction with the ignition spark, the optimal valve timing, lift and duration settings under low RPM engine operations are very different from those under high RPM. Optimal low RPM valve timing lift and duration settings would result in insufficient filling of the cylinder with fuel and air at high RPM, thus greatly limiting engine power output. Conversely, optimal high RPM valve timing lift and duration settings would result in very rough low RPM operation and difficult idling. The ideal engine would have fully variable valve timing, lift and duration, in which the valves would always open at exactly the right point, lift high enough and stay open just the right amount of time for the engine speed and load in use.

=== DOHC VTEC ===

VTEC was introduced as a DOHC (dual overhead camshaft) system in Japan in the 1989 Honda Integra XSi, which used the B16A engine. The same year, Europe saw the arrival of VTEC in the Honda Civic and Honda CRX 1.6i-VT, using a B16A1 variant. The United States market saw its first VTEC system with the introduction of the 1991 Acura NSX, which used a 3-litre DOHC C30A V6 with . DOHC VTEC engines soon appeared in other vehicles, such as the 1992 Acura Integra GS-R (B17A1), and later in the 1993 Honda Prelude VTEC ( H22A) and Honda Del Sol VTEC ( B16A3). The Integra Type R (1995–2000) available in the Japanese market produces using a B18C 1.8-litre engine, producing more horsepower per litre than most super-cars at the time. Honda has also continued to develop other varieties and today offers several varieties of VTEC, such as i-VTEC and i-VTEC Hybrid.

=== SOHC VTEC ===
Honda also applied the system to SOHC (single overhead camshaft) engines such as the D-Series and J-Series Engines, which share a common camshaft for both intake and exhaust valves. The trade-off was that Honda&#x27;s SOHC engines benefited from the VTEC mechanism only on the intake valves. This is because VTEC requires a third center rocker arm and cam lobe (for each intake and exhaust side), and, in the SOHC engine, the spark plugs are situated between the two exhaust rocker arms, leaving no room for the VTEC rocker arm. Additionally, the center lobe on the camshaft cannot be utilized by both the intake and the exhaust, limiting the VTEC feature to one side.

However, beginning with the J37A2 3.7L SOHC V6 engine introduced on all 2009-2012 Acura RL SH-AWD models, SOHC VTEC was incorporated for use with intake and exhaust valves, using a total of six cam lobes and six rocker arms per cylinder. The intake and exhaust rocker shafts contain primary and secondary intake and exhaust rocker arms, respectively. The primary rocker arm contains the VTEC switching piston, while the secondary rocker arm contains the return spring. The term &quot;primary&quot; does not refer to which rocker arm forces the valve down during low-RPM engine operation. Rather, it refers to the rocker arm which contains the VTEC switching piston and receives oil from the rocker shaft.

The primary exhaust rocker arm contacts a low-profile camshaft lobe during low-RPM engine operation. Once VTEC engagement occurs, the oil pressure flowing from the exhaust rocker shaft into the primary exhaust rocker arm forces the VTEC switching piston into the secondary exhaust rocker arm, thereby locking both exhaust rocker arms together. The high-profile camshaft lobe which normally contacts the secondary exhaust rocker arm alone during low-RPM engine operation is able to move both exhaust rocker arms together which are locked as a unit. The same occurs for the intake rocker shaft, except that the high-profile camshaft lobe operates the primary rocker arm.

The J37A2 is able to use both intake and exhaust VTEC by use of a novel design of the intake rocker arm. Each exhaust valve on the J37A2 corresponds to one primary and one secondary exhaust rocker arm. Therefore, there are a total of twelve primary exhaust rocker arms and twelve secondary exhaust rocker arms. However, each secondary intake rocker arm is shaped similar to a &quot;Y&quot; which allows it to contact two intake valves at once. One primary intake rocker arm corresponds to each secondary intake rocker arm. As a result of this design, there are only six primary intake rocker arms and six secondary intake rocker arms.

== VTEC-E ==
The earliest VTEC-E implementation is a variation of SOHC VTEC which is used to increase combustion efficiency at low RPM while maintaining the mid range performance of non-vtec engines. VTEC-E is the first version of VTEC to employ the use of roller rocker arms and because of that, it forgoes the need for having 3 intake lobes for actuating the two valves—two lobes for non-VTEC operation (one small and one medium-sized lobe) and one lobe for VTEC operation (the biggest lobe). Instead, there are two different intake cam profiles per cylinder: a very mild cam lobe with little lift and a normal cam lobe with moderate lift. Because of this, at low RPM, when VTEC is not engaged, one of the two intake valves is allowed to open only a very small amount due to the mild cam lobe, forcing most of the intake charge through the other open intake valve with the normal cam lobe. This induces swirl of the intake charge which improves air/fuel atomization in the cylinder and allows for a leaner fuel mixture to be used. As the engine&#x27;s speed and load increase, both valves are needed to supply a sufficient mixture. When engaging VTEC mode, a pre-defined threshold for MPH (must be moving), RPM and load must be met before the computer actuates a solenoid which directs pressurized oil into a sliding pin, just like with the original VTEC. This sliding pin connects the intake rocker arm followers together so that, now, both intake valves are following the &quot;normal&quot; camshaft lobe instead of just one of them. When in VTEC, since the &quot;normal&quot; cam lobe has the same timing and lift as the intake cam lobes of the SOHC non-VTEC engines, both engines have identical performance in the upper powerband assuming everything else is the same. This variant of the VTEC-E is used in some D-series engines.

With the later VTEC-E implementations, the only difference it has with the earlier VTEC-E is that the second normal cam profile has been replaced with a more aggressive cam profile which is identical to the original VTEC high-speed cam profile. This in essence supersedes VTEC and the earlier VTEC-E implementations since the fuel and low RPM torque benefits of the earlier VTEC-E are combined with the high performance of the original VTEC.
There are 3 intake cam lobes: 2 for the low-RPM mode (1 for almost closed valve, 1 for normally opened) and 1 for the powerful mode when the VTEC solenoid is activated. The lowest RPM for activating the VTEC is 2500, or it may be higher if the load is weak - ECM dependant. With the VTEC solenoid is on the 3-rd biggest lobe begins to push all the intake valves with the more aggressively profile. This variant of the VTEC-E is used in the F23A, F22B and JDM F20B SOHC VTEC engines.

== 3-Stage VTEC ==

3-Stage VTEC is a version that employs three different cam profiles to control intake valve timing and lift. Due to this version of VTEC being designed around a SOHC valve head, space was limited; so VTEC can modify only the opening and closing of the intake valves. The low-end fuel economy improvements of VTEC-E and the performance of conventional VTEC are combined in this application. From idle to 2500-3000 RPM, depending on load conditions, one intake valve fully opens while the other opens just slightly, enough to prevent pooling of fuel behind the valve, also called 12-valve mode. This 12 Valve mode results in swirl of the intake charge which increases combustion efficiency, resulting in improved low end torque and better fuel economy. At 3000-5400 RPM, depending on load, one of the VTEC solenoids engages, which causes the second valve to lock onto the first valve&#x27;s camshaft lobe. Also called 16-valve mode, this method resembles a normal engine operating mode and improves the mid-range power curve. At 5500-7000 RPM, the second VTEC solenoid engages (both solenoids now engaged) so that both intake valves are using a middle, third camshaft lobe. The third lobe is tuned for high-performance and provides peak power at the top end of the RPM range.

In newer version of 3-Stage i-VTEC combined VTC and PGM-FI to allow ECU to control full range of mode to archive greater fuel economy improvements and performance. Honda CR-Z able to switch between low-end mode and standard mode from 1000 rpm to 2250 rpm uninterrupted and engage to high cam mode from 2250 rpm upward on SOHC.

== i-VTEC ==
Honda i-VTEC (intelligent-VTEC) is a system that combines VTEC with Honda&#x27;s VTC (Variable Timing Control), a continuously variable camshaft phasing system used on the intake camshaft of DOHC VTEC engines. The technology first appeared on Honda&#x27;s K-series four-cylinder engine family in 2001. Most Honda or Acura four-cylinder powered vehicles sold in the United States used i-VTEC by the 2002 model year with the exception being the 2002 Honda Accord.

VTEC controls of valve lift and valve duration are still limited to distinct low- and high-RPM profiles, but the intake camshaft is now capable of advancing between 25 and 50 degrees, depending upon engine configuration. Phasing is implemented by a computer-controlled, oil-driven adjustable cam sprocket. Both engine load and RPM affect VTEC. The intake phase varies from fully retarded at idle to somewhat advanced at full throttle and low RPM. The effect is further optimization of torque output, especially at low and midrange RPM. There are two types of i-VTEC K series engines which are explained in the next section.

Honda&#x27;s J-Series SOHC engines use an entirely different system also, confusingly, marketed as i-VTEC. Honda J-Series Engines using i-VTEC combine SOHC VTEC operation with Honda VCM (Variable Cylinder Management) variable displacement technology to improve fuel economy under light loads.

=== K-Series ===

The K-Series engines have two different types of i-VTEC system implementations. The first type is for performance engines like the K20A2 or K20Z3 used in the 2002-2006 RSX Type S or the 2006-2011 Civic Si and the second type is for economy engines like the K20A3 or K24A4 used in the 2002-2005 Civic Si or 2003-2007 Accord. The performance i-VTEC system is basically the same as the DOHC VTEC system of the B16A&#x27;s. Both intake and exhaust cams have three cam lobes per cylinder. However, the valvetrain has the added benefit of roller rockers and VTC continuously variable intake cam timing. Performance i-VTEC is a combination of conventional DOHC VTEC with VTC (which operates for intake valves only). The VTC is available in the economy and performance i-VTEC engines.

The economy i-VTEC used in K20A3/K24A4 engines is more like the SOHC VTEC-E in that the intake cam has only two lobes, one very small and one larger, as well as no VTEC on the exhaust cam. At low RPM only one valve on the intake opens fully, promoting combustion chamber swirl and improved fuel atomization. This allows a leaner air/fuel mixture to be used, improving fuel economy. At higher RPM, both intake valves run off the larger intake cam lobe, improving total air flow and top-end power.

The two types of engines are easily distinguishable by the factory rated power output: the performance engines make around or more in stock form, while the economy engines do not make much more than .

=== R-Series ===
The i-VTEC system in the
R-Series engine uses a modified SOHC VTEC system consisting of one small and two large lobes. The large lobes operate the intake valves directly while the small lobe is engaged during VTEC. Unlike typical VTEC systems, the system in the R-Series engine operates in a &#x27;reverse&#x27; fashion engaging only at low to mid RPMs. At low RPMs, the small lobe locks onto one of the larger lobes and keeps one of the intake valves partially open during the compression cycle, similar to the Atkinson cycle. The ability for Honda to switch between Atkinson cycle and normal cycle allows excellent fuel efficiency without sacrificing too much performance.

=== i-VTEC with Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) ===
In 2003, Honda introduced an i-VTEC V6 (an update of the J-series) that includes Honda&#x27;s cylinder deactivation technology which closes the valves on one bank of (3) cylinders during light load and low speed (below ) operation. According to Honda,

VCM technology works on the principle that a vehicle only requires a fraction of its power output at cruising speeds. The system electronically deactivates cylinders to reduce fuel consumption. The engine is able to run on 3, 4, or all 6 cylinders based on the power requirement, essentially getting the best of both worlds. V6 power when accelerating or climbing, as well as the efficiency of a smaller engine when cruising.

The technology was originally introduced to the US on the 2005 Honda Odyssey minivan, and can now be found on the Honda Accord Hybrid, the 2006 Honda Pilot, and the 2008 Honda Accord. Example: EPA estimates for the 2011 (271 hp SOHC 3.5L) V6 Accord are 24 mpg combined vs. 27 in the two 4-cylinder-equipped models.

i-VTEC VCM was also used in the 1.3-liter LDA engine used in the 2001-2005 Honda Civic Hybrid.

=== i-VTEC i ===
A version of i-VTEC with direct injection, first used in 2004 Honda Stream.
Direct injection 2.0L DOHC i-VTEC I gasoline engine.

* The 2-litre DOHC i-VTEC I integrates the i-VTEC system which uses the VTEC and VTC which uses a direct injection system for an air-fuel ratio of up to 65:1 for an unprecedented level of ultra-lean combustion. Stable combustion is achieved by using less fuel than conventional direct injection engines which have an air-fuel ratio of 40:1.
* Combustion control through the use of high-precision EGR valves and a newly developed high-performance catalyst enable the 2.0 litre DOHC i-VTEC I lean-burn direct injection engine which qualify as an Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle.

== AVTEC ==
The AVTEC (Advanced VTEC) engine was first announced in 2006. It combines continuously variable valve lift and timing control with continuously variable phase control. Honda originally planned to produce vehicles with AVTEC engines within next 3 years. Although it was speculated that it would first be used in 2008 Honda Accord, the vehicle instead utilizes the existing i-VTEC system. As of late 2017, no Honda vehicles use the AVTEC system.

=== Differences from other VTECs ===
Honda&#x27;s advanced VTEC technology departs greatly from its previous incarnations by no longer relying on switching between two sets of lobes on a given camshaft. It instead uses a single cam lobe per valve, and two rocker arms per valve whereby the second rocker arm has a movable pivot point, thereby providing the varying cam lift. Advanced VTEC motors still use the now standard oil pressure controlled variable cam gear angle mechanism. With these two technologies combined Honda has developed an infinitely variable valve timing and lift system (&quot;VVTL&quot;). Previous versions of VTEC included only staged VVTL i.e. High-Low. With the introduction of i-VTEC the systems gained infinitely variable valve timing but still only staged lift i.e. High-Low. The &quot;infinitely variable&quot; portion of the A-VTEC is what makes it stand out as a serious evolutionary step in the world of VTEC.

=== Patent ===
A related U.S. patent (6,968,819) was filed on January 5, 2005.

Advanced VTEC has a standard camshaft and rocker arms, attached as they normally are with camshaft overhead, and rocker arms pushing down on the poppet valves. The camshaft is surrounded by a partially open drum which has secondary rocker arms attached to it via a pivoting point. These secondary rocker arms, which have a varying depth profile (similar to cams), are directly actuated by the camshaft, in a scissor-like manner. The primary rocker arms are actuated by the secondary (drum attached) rocker arms. The drum will only rotate to advance or retard the position of the secondary rocker arms, to take advantage of their varying profiles. Thus, through varying the position of the drum about its axis, each cam profile is changed to an optimal height for maximum engine performance without sacrificing fuel efficiency at lower speeds.

==VTEC TURBO==
The VTEC TURBO engine series were introduced in 2013 as part of the Earth Dreams Technology range and include new features such as gasoline direct injection, turbochargers, Dual Cam VTC and VTEC on the exhaust profile instead of the intake, marking the end of the &#x27;traditional sound&#x27; of VTEC in this engine. VTEC implementation on the exhaust rocker arms causes the turbo to be spooled quicker, eliminating turbo lag. VTEC Turbo engines come in three displacement capacities: a 1.0 liter 3-cylinder, a 1.5 liter 4-cylinder, and a 2.0 liter 4-cylinder.

Initial implementation for European vehicles included 2-litre 4-cylinder turbocharged engine used from 2015 Honda Civic Type R until present, which included Euro 6 emissions compliance.

== VTEC in motorcycles ==
Apart from the Japanese market-only Honda CB400SF Super Four HYPER VTEC, introduced in 1999, the first worldwide implementation of VTEC technology in a motorcycle occurred with the introduction of Honda&#x27;s VFR800 sportbike in 2002. Similar to the SOHC VTEC-E style, one intake valve remains closed until a threshold of 6800 (6600 after 2006) RPM is reached, then the second valve is opened by an oil-pressure actuated pin. The dwell of the valves remains unchanged, as in the automobile VTEC-E, and little extra power is produced, but with a smoothing-out of the torque curve. Critics maintain that VTEC adds little to the VFR experience, while increasing the engine&#x27;s complexity. Honda seemed to agree, as their VFR1200, a model announced in October 2009, came to replace the VFR800, which abandons the VTEC concept in favor of a large capacity narrow-vee &quot;unicam&quot;, i.e., SOHC, engine. However, the 2014 VFR800 reintroduced the VTEC system from the 2002-2009 VFR motorcycle.

<text>Karel Gott (14 July 1939 – 1 October 2019) was a Czech singer, considered the most successful male singer in Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic. He was voted the country&#x27;s best male singer in the annual &quot;Český slavík&quot; (&quot;Czech Nightingale&quot;) national music award 42 times, most recently in 2017.

He achieved considerable success in the German-speaking countries, where he was known as &quot;the Golden Voice of Prague&quot;, winning the Goldene Stimmgabel award three times (1982, 1984, and 1995).

Over the course of his career he released over 100 albums and 100 compilation albums, and sold an estimated 50–100 million records worldwide, 23 million of them in the German-speaking market, and about 15 million in Czechoslovakia and its successor states, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.

== Early life ==
Gott was born in Plzeň in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (now the Czech Republic), and lived in Prague from the age of six. Gott initially wanted to study art, but failed the exams at the Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague (UMPRUM), and so trained as an electrician. On completing his studies, he began working as an electrician, but also became interested in the Prague music scene, especially jazz. He experimented with playing the bass and the guitar, but eventually decided to focus on singing, studying privately. During the 1950s, he occasionally performed as an amateur singer and often participated in competitions.

== Early career ==
In 1958, he was an unsuccessful participant in an amateur singing contest in the Prague Slavonic House, entitled &quot;Looking for New Talent&quot;, but succeeded in obtaining his first performance slots at the Vltava Prague Cafe that same year.

In 1960, he decided to become a professional singer. He studied opera at the Prague Conservatory under Konstantin Karenin, a student of the Russian bass Feodor Chaliapin. Knowing of Gott&#x27;s interest in current musical trends, Karenin instructed him not only in classical Italian pieces but also in popular music. Around this time Gott travelled abroad (to Poland) for the first time, with the Czechoslovak Radio Jazz Orchestra, conducted by Karel Krautgartner.

In 1962, Gott released his first single with Supraphon, a duet with the jazz singer, Vlasta Průchová entitled &quot;Až nám bude dvakrát tolik&quot; (When we are twice as old). That year Gott appeared in the first &quot;Zlatý slavík&quot; (Golden Nightingale) national poll, placing 49th with three votes. Shortly afterwards, in 1963, Gott left the conservatory to continue with private singing lessons until 1966.
In 1963 Gott was offered a place at the recently founded Semafor Theater, which was at the forefront of the emerging Czechoslovak pop music scene, his first significant experience of stage performance. In the same year, he released his first solo single, a Czech recording of Henry Mancini&#x27;s &quot;Moon River&quot;, followed by his song &quot;Oči sněhem zaváté&quot; (Snowdrift Eyes), which became the year&#x27;s best-selling record. Shortly afterwards, Gott received the first of forty-two &quot;Zlatý slavík&quot; awards, given to the most popular artist of the year.

Gott established the Apollo Theater in 1965, along with two colleagues from Semafor: Jiří and Ladislav Štaidl. At this point, he was already well known to the public, appearing in the programs &quot;Pilgrimage for Two&quot; and &quot;Evening Prayer&quot; while building a repertoire with his own orchestra. He began composing his own songs, and toured Czechoslovakia and abroad with the Apollo Theater. That year, he released his first album, &quot;Karel Gott Sings&quot; with Supraphon, followed by an English export album titled &quot;The Golden Voice of Prague&quot; (Artia-Supraphon).

In 1967, Gott performed at Midem, the music industry trade fair in Cannes, France, where the applause was measured during every concert. Gott&#x27;s performance surprised observers by reaching a level of 54 (compared to 58 for Tom Jones). Following this event, Gott signed a contract with the Polydor/Deutsche Grammophon Gesellschaft record company, renewing it several times until it became a life contract in 1997. Between 1967 and 2000, Polydor released over 125 albums and 72 singles for Karel Gott in German-speaking countries. Gott represented Austria in the Eurovision Song Contest 1968 with the song &quot;Tausend Fenster&quot;, finishing in 13th place. In the same year, he spent six months performing nightly at the New Frontier Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.

==1970s==

In the 1970s, Gott achieved domestic success and appeared regularly on television, including in a ten-part serial entitled &quot;Karel Gott in Slany&quot;. In Germany, one of his most successful markets, he celebrated his breakthrough in 1970 with the song &quot;Einmal um die ganze Welt&quot; and was a star in both West Germany and East Germany. He regularly appeared in television shows like the ZDF-Hitparade. One of his best-known hits was the title song to the anime series &quot;Maya the Honey Bee&quot;. He recorded the theme in German, later also in Slovak and Czech for the dubbed versions in those languages.

In January 1977, a document known as Charter 77 was created within the dissident circle surrounding Václav Havel, Petr Uhl, and Pavel Kohout. This document highlighted the fact that the Czechoslovakian government failed to uphold its commitments to international human rights treaties, such as the Helsinki Accords. In response, the ruling Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ) organised a signature campaign called &quot;The Proclamation of Czechoslovak Committees of Artist Unions: For New Creative Deeds in the Name of Socialism and Peace&quot;, unofficially known as the Anticharter. This proclamation expressed loyalty to the communist regime and was signed by more than 7000 artists, including Karel Gott. In the years following the fall of the communist regime in 1989, Gott was often confronted by journalists for this act, however he denied any wrongdoing for many years, saying that he did not know what he was signing. In his posthumously published autobiography &quot;My Way to Happiness&quot; (2021), Gott expresses regret writing that &quot;[The anticharta] was a manipulation of all the members within the music industry. And I admit that to this day I am deeply troubled that I got so foolishly tricked.&quot;

On 3 May 1977, Gott was awarded the title of Merited Artist, and in the following year received the Golden Hat of Cologne, awarded annually to a prominent cultural or social figure. His debut LP in the Soviet Union, released in 1977 by Melodiya, sold over 4.5 million copies, and he remains popular in the former Soviet Union countries.

Karel Gott recorded a cover version of the song &quot;All by Myself&quot; called &quot;Kam tenkrát šel můj bratr Jan&quot; (Where Did My Brother Jan Go That Time), dedicated to Jan Palach, the student activist who killed himself by self-immolation as a protest against the Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia in January 1969. The song was recorded in 1977 while Soviet troops were still present in the country.

Towards the end of the decade, Gott began to experiment with other genres outside popular music, including country music and classical compositions, and he appeared at the Fan Fair Country Music Festival in 1979, the first of five appearances.

==1980s and farewell tour==
The 1980s were marked by international success for Gott, including the filming of the musical &quot;In the Track of Bel Canto&quot; in Italy in 1981, with an accompanying German-Italian album, and a duet performance with Sofia Rotaru in the Soviet Union. In 1983, Gott was awarded the Gold Medal of Hermann Löns in Munich, Germany, for his role in the development of German traditional song. On 30 April 1985, he was awarded the title of National Artist for exceptional artistic contributions. In 1986, to mark 20 years with the company, he received Polydor&#x27;s Golden Needle, previously only awarded to Leonard Bernstein and Herbert von Karajan. In March 1991 he was the first artist inducted into the Hall of Fame of the Academy of Popular Music, and he was awarded the Supraphon Diamond Record Award on 8 September 1992, in recognition of record sales of 13 million in Czechoslovakia.

In 1990, Gott announced the end of his career and arranged a long farewell tour. However, the success of the tour led him to retract his decision. In 1993, he established an artistic agency, GOJA, with František Janeček, which now produces Gott&#x27;s records and manages his artistic activities.

==Comeback and later career==

In 1996, following renewed public interest in his career, Gott again won the &quot;Český slavík&quot; (Czech Nightingale), and won the accolade every year since, with the exception of 1998 and 2012. He remained popular in a number of countries and performed widely outside the Czech Republic. On 29 September 2000 he played a concert at Carnegie Hall in New York City.

In 2008, he appeared on Bushido&#x27;s album &quot;Heavy Metal Payback&quot;, performing a duet called &quot;Für immer jung&quot;, a cover of &quot;Forever Young&quot; by Alphaville.

In 2009 he was awarded a Distinguished Merit Medal by the Czech state.

His German lyricist from 2001 was Filip Albrecht, who wrote over 20 songs for him. In May 2014 Gott released his autobiography &quot;Zwischen zwei Welten&quot; (Between two worlds).

In May 2019, only months before he died, Gott released his last song and music video - a duet with his daughter Charlotte entitled &quot;Srdce nehasnou&quot; (Hearts don&#x27;t fade). At the time of release, Gott&#x27;s health issues were kept secret from the public, but after Gott died, songwriter Richard Krajčo said that he had been asked to write the duet in a very short time.

==Personal life==

He had two daughters (Dominika and Lucie) from different former relationships. He married his last wife, , in January 2008 in Las Vegas, and they had two daughters, Charlotte (born in April 2006) and Nelly (born in May 2008).
During the 1990s, Gott began to focus on painting. The first exhibition of his paintings took place in 1992, at the Prague Christ Child Gallery, and his work was since exhibited in Berlin, Moscow, Munich, Cologne, Vienna, and Bratislava.

==Health problems and death==
In October 2015, Gott was diagnosed with cancer of the lymph nodes. On 18 March 2016, it was reported in the media that he had beaten cancer, but in September 2019, he developed acute leukemia, due to which he cancelled all upcoming appearances and started outpatient treatment. He died at around 11:30 pm on 1 October 2019 at his home in Bertramka, aged 80, with his family around him, and his death was reported the following morning.

All major television stations in the Czech Republic featured breaking news announcements and commemorative programs in their schedules, and Czech Radio and Radio Impuls also adapted their scheduled broadcasts. At an extraordinary meeting on 2 October, the government approved a state funeral and declared the day of the funeral a national day of mourning. A day later, Prime Minister Andrej Babiš withdrew the proposal for a state funeral, saying that it should only be a funeral with state honours, as in the case of Otakar Motejl in 2010. At the presidential chateau in Lány, the Presidential flags were flown at half-mast as a sign of mourning, but according to the former proto-logger Jindřich Forejt, this violated the law on the use of state symbols of the Czech Republic.

A public commemorative ceremony was held at 8am on Friday, 11 October 2019, in Prague&#x27;s Žofín Palace. Gott&#x27;s fans travelled from around the Czech Republic and Germany and waited for several hours in a five-kilometre queue to the palace. The ceremony ended at midnight, by which time around 49,000 mourners had paid respects at his coffin. The funeral mass with state honours was held at Saint Vitus Cathedral on Saturday, 12 October, presided over by the Archbishop of Prague, Cardinal Dominik Duka. A day of national mourning was declared on the same day. The requiem guests included many famous Czech singers, actors, and sportsmen, as well as President Miloš Zeman and Prime Minister Babiš.

<text>Miloš Zeman (; born 28 September 1944) is a Czech politician who served as the third president of the Czech Republic from 2013 to 2023. He also previously served as the prime minister of the Czech Republic from 1998 to 2002. As leader of the Czech Social Democratic Party from 1993 to 2001, he is credited with the revival of the party into one of the country&#x27;s major political forces. Zeman briefly served as the President of the Chamber of Deputies from 1996 to 1998.

Born in Kolín to a modest family, Zeman joined the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia in 1968, but was expelled two years later due to his opposition to the Warsaw Pact invasion. Following the Velvet Revolution in 1989, he joined the Czech Social Democratic Party, which he led into the 1996 election.

Zeman became Prime Minister following the 1998 legislative election after striking a controversial pact with his long-time rival Václav Klaus, which was heavily criticized by President Václav Havel, the media and opposition for weakening the system of checks and balances. His government continued the privatization of publicly owned industries and established new administrative regions. Zeman&#x27;s cabinet also attempted to change the electoral system to first-past-the-post voting, which was struck down by the Constitutional Court. Under his leadership, the Czech Republic joined NATO in 1999. Zeman was the last leader to vote in favor of the 1999 bombing of Yugoslavia, effectively green-lighting the operation. He ran for president in 2003 but was eliminated after his own party members did not vote for him. 

In 2013, Zeman was elected president of the Czech Republic, becoming the first directly elected president in the nation&#x27;s history; his predecessors were elected by the Parliament. In 2018, he was re-elected for a second term. His presidency was marked by deepening polarization and political discontent. Zeman has been a subject of widespread criticism and source of controversy. He was widely regarded as having pursued favourable policies towards Russia and China, while frequently clashing with traditional allies in the European Union and NATO. However, some of his supporters contest this characterization, and Zeman subsequently strongly opposed the Russian invasion of Ukraine. During his presidency, many of his high-level staff and associates were targets of investigations for mishandling classified information, corruption and fraud, among others. Zeman left office in 2023 and was succeeded by Petr Pavel.

==Early years==
Zeman was born in Kolín. His parents divorced when he was two years old and he was raised by his mother, who was a teacher. He studied at a high school in Kolín, then from 1965 at the University of Economics in Prague, graduating in 1969.

Zeman joined the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia in 1968, during the Prague Spring, but was expelled in 1970 due to his opposition to the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. He was dismissed from his job and spent more than ten years working for the sports organization Sportpropag (1971–84). From 1984, he worked at the company Agrodat, but he lost his job again in 1989, as a result of a critical article he had written in &quot;Technický magazín&quot; in August 1989, entitled &quot;Prognostika a přestavba&quot; (Forecasting and Perestroika).

==Political activities before presidency==
In summer 1989, he appeared on Czechoslovak Television criticising the poor state of the Czechoslovak economy. His speech caused a scandal, but his views helped him join the leaders of the Civic Forum a few months later, during the Velvet Revolution.

In 1990 Zeman became a member of the House of the Nations of the Czechoslovak Federal Assembly. In 1992, he ran successfully for the House of the People of the Federal Assembly, already as a member of the Czechoslovak Social Democracy (ČSSD), which he joined the same year. In 1993, he was elected chairman of the party, and in the following years he transformed it into one of the country&#x27;s major parties.

The success of ČSSD in the 1996 legislative election allowed him to prevent his rival Václav Klaus and his Civic Democratic Party (ODS) from forming a majority government. Zeman became the President of the Chamber of Deputies and held this post until the early election in 1998.

In 1998, ČSSD won the election and Zeman became Prime Minister of a minority government, which he led for the next four years. In April 2001, he was replaced as leader by Vladimír Špidla. Zeman then retired and moved to live in the countryside in the Vysočina Region. He won a presidential primary in 2002 to become the ČSSD nominee for president, but lost the 2003 presidential election to Václav Klaus, due to party disunity. Zeman became an outspoken critic of his former party&#x27;s leaders. He left ČSSD on 21 March 2007, due to conflicts with the party leader and chairman, Jiří Paroubek.

In October 2009, he founded a new party, Party of Civic Rights – Zemanovci. The party did not win any seats in the 2010, 2013 or 2017 legislative elections.

==Presidency (2013–2023)==

In February 2012 Miloš Zeman announced his return to politics and intention to run in the first direct presidential election in the Czech Republic. Polls indicated that he was one of the two strongest candidates in the election, alongside Jan Fischer. Zeman narrowly won the first round of the elections and progressed to the second round to face Karel Schwarzenberg, winning by a clearer margin. His term began in March 2013.

Zeman&#x27;s alleged excessive alcohol consumption became a subject of public discussion and media attention on several occasions. Many Czechs believed he was drunk during his appearances at Czech TV headquarters, shortly after his victory in the 2013 presidential election, and during the exhibition of the Bohemian Crown Jewels.

In May 2013, Zeman refused to grant a tenured professorship to literary historian Martin C. Putna, due to Putna&#x27;s appearance at 2011 Prague Gay Pride.

In June 2013, the coalition government led by Petr Nečas collapsed due to a corruption and spying scandal. Zeman, ignoring the political balance of power in the Czech Parliament, appointed his friend and long-term ally Jiří Rusnok as Prime Minister, and tasked him with forming a new government. This was described in parts of the Czech and foreign media as a political power grab, undermining parliamentary democracy and expanding his powers. On 10 July, during the appointment of Rusnok&#x27;s cabinet, Zeman advised the new cabinet members not to &quot;let yourself get annoyed by media criticism from jealous fools who have never in their lives done anything useful&quot;. Rusnok&#x27;s government was short-lived, and resigned after losing a vote of confidence.

Zeman played an important role in a scandal that occurred in October 2013, shortly after the Czech legislative election. ČSSD First Deputy Chairman Michal Hašek and his allies in the party called for chairman Bohuslav Sobotka to resign following the party&#x27;s poor election result, and excluded him from the team negotiating the next government. However, it subsequently emerged that Hašek and his allies had attended a secret post-election meeting with Zeman, where they were rumoured to have negotiated a &#x27;coup&#x27; in ČSSD. Hašek initially denied the accusations, stating on Czech Television that &quot;there was no meeting&quot;. However, his allies (deputies Milan Chovanec, Zdeněk Škromach, Jeroným Tejc, and Jiří Zimola) later admitted that the meeting took place. The event sparked public protests in the country and eventually led to Hašek apologising and resigning his position in the party. Zeman denied having initiated the meeting. His Party of Civic Rights – Zemanovci (SPOZ) received 1.5% of the vote in the election, winning no seats.

On 6 April 2014, in the wake of the annexation of Crimea, Zeman called for strong action to be taken, possibly including sending NATO forces into Ukraine, if Russia tried to annex the eastern part of the country. Speaking on a radio show he said that, &quot;The moment Russia decides to widen its territorial expansion to the eastern part of Ukraine, that is where the fun ends. There I would plead not only for the strictest EU sanctions, but even for military readiness of the North Atlantic Alliance, like for example NATO forces entering Ukrainian territory.&quot; The Czech Republic joined NATO in 1999, when Zeman was prime minister. In the Czech constitutional system it is the government that has the main responsibility for foreign policy, although the president is commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The ČSSD government of Bohuslav Sobotka resisted strong EU sanctions against Russia after the annexation, because of the negative economic impact such sanctions would have had on the country.
In November 2014, on the 25th anniversary of the 1989 Velvet Revolution against communist rule, protests took place calling for Zeman&#x27;s resignation. Protesters argued that Zeman had betrayed the legacy of Václav Havel, who helped Czechoslovakia and then Czech Republic become a champion of human rights, by being too sympathetic to authoritarian regimes and too close to Russia and China. They carried football-style red penalty cards as a warning of ejection to Zeman and threw eggs at him.

An opinion poll conducted by the CVVM agency in March 2016 reported that 62% of Czechs trusted President Miloš Zeman, up from 55% in September 2015. By December 2016, his approval rating had fallen to 48% following a series of scandals, with around 49% of those surveyed stating that they didn&#x27;t trust him.

On 9 March 2017, during a meeting with his supporters, Zeman announced his intention to run again for the presidency, confirming his decision the next day in a press conference. He said that he had been persuaded by the support of the people. He stated that he did not think he was the favourite in the election, and that he would not run a political campaign, attack his rivals, or participate in debates. He also announced that he would participate in a television programme called &quot;A week with the President&quot;.

On 26 March 2017, during a radio interview, Zeman stated that someone had placed child pornography onto a computer in the official residence. Zeman claimed that he had called &quot;IT guys&quot;, who had found out that the hackers were from Alabama in the United States. Later, Zeman&#x27;s spokesman added that &quot;the President, like every night, googled his own name on the internet and one of the pages contained child pornography&quot;. According to police, there was no evidence of a hacking attack on Zeman&#x27;s computer.

Zeman decided to run for a second term and stood in the presidential elections in 2018. Observers compared the election to other elections such as the 2016 United States and 2017 French presidential elections, which saw a liberal internationalist and a right-wing populist running against each other. Zeman won the election with 51.37% in the second round.

On 25 July 2019, the Senate, for the first time in the history of the Czech Republic, approved and delivered to the Chamber of Deputies articles of impeachment against President Zeman, related to eight instances where he had allegedly acted in breach of the constitution, including naming and dismissing cabinet ministers, interference in court cases, and acting against the foreign interests of the Czech government. The Chamber of Deputies rejected indicting Zeman on 26 September 2019 with only 58 MPs voting for indictment out of 120 votes needed.

On 10 October 2021, the day after the 2021 Czech legislative election, Zeman was hospitalized, throwing the timeline for the start of government formation talks into doubt. After eight days with almost no details about Zeman&#x27;s health condition from his spokesperson Jiří Ovčáček nor the head of the president&#x27;s office Vratislav Mynář, Senate President Miloš Vystrčil said at a press conference that he had received an update from the Central Military Hospital (UVN) and the President&#x27;s chief physician Miroslav Zavoral that Zeman was &quot;currently unable to perform any work duties due to health reasons&quot;. On 25 November Zeman was discharged from the hospital after his condition improved. The hospital said it would have preferred Zeman to remain hospitalized, but accepted his decision. However, on the same day, he tested positive for COVID-19 and thus returned to the hospital for two more days.

On 19 October 2022, Zeman announced he would retire from politics at the end of his second term, in March 2023.

==Post-presidency==
On 19 April 2023, Zeman opened a new office on Jaselská street in Prague 6, rented from the Prague Archbishopric. He said he expects to welcome visitors once a week. 

Speaking as a guest at the Freedom and Direct Democracy leadership election in April 2024, Zeman stated his wish for the next Czech governing coalition to be composed of ANO 2011 and Freedom and Direct Democracy.

==Political views==
Zeman was considered a centre-left politician during his premiership and term as leader of the Social Democrats, but as president he began to be associated with far-right anti-immigration policies in response to the European migrant crisis. &quot;The Guardian&quot; described Zeman as &quot;left-of-centre&quot; in the run-up to the 2013 presidential election, but as &quot;far-right&quot; and a populist in 2018. &quot;The Independent&quot; described him as a &quot;right-wing populist&quot; in 2018. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Zeman as a &quot;populist leftist&quot; in 2016. Other outlets have simply labeled Zeman a populist. He has been compared to former United States president Donald Trump by Western press, and endorsed Trump&#x27;s 2016 presidential campaign, and endorsed him once again in 2024.

===China===

In 2014, he attracted criticism when he said he wished to learn how China had &quot;stabilized&quot; its society. In 2016 he invited Chinese president Xi Jinping on a state visit, which sparked a wave of protest. He labeled pro-Tibet protestors &quot;mentally impaired individuals&quot; and used police to prevent protesters from reaching Prague Castle. Police also entered a building of the Film and TV School of the Academy of Performing Arts (FAMU) to remove a Tibetan flag which had been hung out of a window. Finance Minister Miroslav Kalousek accused Zeman of &quot;bootlicking authoritarian and unfree regimes&quot;. Those actions were seen by critics as a contravention of Czech society&#x27;s freedom of expression, and protests were held by at least 50 members of the two chambers of the Parliament, opposition leaders and civil society groups as well as hundreds of supporters of Taiwan, Tibet, and Turkic Uyghur separatists in Xinjiang.

Zeman appointed Ye Jianming, the founder and chairman of CEFC China Energy, as his economic adviser. The company is linked to the People&#x27;s Liberation Army. CEFC China Energy acquired multiple assets in the Czech Republic, including travel agencies and media companies.

===Gun control===
In 2016, following a number of terror attacks around Europe, Zeman joined a number of other Czech politicians and security professionals in urging the 240,000 gun owners in the country with concealed carry licences to carry their firearms, in order to be able to contribute to the protection of soft targets. Zeman&#x27;s wife also obtained a concealed carry license and a revolver.

===European Union===

Zeman has expressed both supportive and critical positions regarding the European Union. As prime minister, he helped bring the Czech Republic into the EU, and he has described himself as a &quot;federalist&quot; who supports EU membership. Before becoming president, he promised to fly the flag of Europe at Prague Castle, something that Zeman&#x27;s predecessor, Václav Klaus, refused to do; he did so shortly after taking office. On the same day, Zeman ratified the Treaty Establishing the European Stability Mechanism, which Klaus had also refused to do, making the Czech Republic the last country to do so. In June 2017, Zeman stated that Czech people are &quot;irrationally afraid&quot; of adopting the Euro as the Czech Republic&#x27;s currency.

Despite his pro-EU statements and actions, Zeman supports holding a referendum on Czech EU membership similar to the Brexit referendum held in the United Kingdom in 2016. He also has been labelled a Eurosceptic and opposes the EU&#x27;s migrant quotas. Some of his critics have accused him of having pro-Russia leanings, favouring it over the EU.

===Environment and climate change===
Like his predecessor and former opponent Václav Klaus, Zeman is a climate change denier. He has said that in his opinion, human activity probably cannot influence global warming.

When the environmental movement Hnutí DUHA tried to protect a national park from illegal logging, Zeman said he would treat them in a &quot;good old medieval way: burn them, piss on them and salt them&quot;.

===Israel===

Zeman is a long-standing supporter of the State of Israel. Zeman was one of the most prominent international leaders to support the U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel&#x27;s capital under President Donald Trump, and he voiced support for following the US in moving its Israeli embassy to Jerusalem. He criticized the EU&#x27;s position on Jerusalem, calling its member states &quot;cowards&quot; and stating that they &quot;are doing all they can so a pro-Palestinian terrorist movement can have supremacy over a pro-Israeli movement.&quot;

Zeman ordered the Israeli flag to fly at the Prague Castle to show support for Israel amid the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis. 

===LGBTQ===
In June 2021, Zeman described transgender people as &quot;disgusting&quot; in a TV interview, and said that Pride protests were minorities trying to put themselves on a superior footing to others. He also said that if he were younger, he would organize a counter-demonstration of heterosexuals. He also said during the interview that he supported recent laws passed in Hungary banning the mention of LGBTQ issues in the education system.

===Kosovo===
Zeman is opposed to having a Czech embassy in Kosovo. He said that he is against the recognition of Kosovo, and has described it as a &quot;terror regime financed by the illegal drug trade&quot;. Whilst visiting Belgrade in 2014, he stated his opposition to the formation of an independent Kosovan army, equating it to the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). He commented on the history of terrorist acts committed by the KLA, and noted that its disbanding was a component of the peace agreements. During the same visit, he said he hoped Serbia would join the European Union soon.

===Middle East and views on Islam===
Zeman has expressed concern about the growth of Islamic terrorism and of ISIL. In June 2011, Zeman said, referring to Islam, &quot;The enemy is the anti-civilization spreading from North Africa to Indonesia. Two billion people live in it and it is financed partly from oil sales and partly from drug sales.&quot; He likened Muslims who believe in the Qur&#x27;an to followers of Nazism.

Zeman called for unified armed operation against Islamic State (ISIL) led by the U.N. Security Council. In June 2015, Zeman commented that: &quot;If European countries accept a wave of migrants, there will be terrorist groups among them, of which also a Libyan minister has warned. By accepting the migrants, we strongly facilitate Islamic State’s expansion to Europe.&quot; Zeman described the Middle Eastern refugees arriving in Europe as an &quot;organized invasion&quot;. In September 2015, Zeman rejected the European Union&#x27;s proposal of compulsory migrant quotas, saying, &quot;Only the future will show that this was a big mistake&quot;.

Zeman said that Turkey should not be in the European Union and criticised Turkish President Erdoğan&#x27;s anti-European rhetoric. He also accused Turkey of allying with ISIL in its fight against Syrian Kurds.

===United States and NATO===
Zeman, who played a role in the Czech Republic&#x27;s accession to NATO, has called for a referendum on NATO membership, though he supports remaining in the organization. In November 2012, during a speech at the University of Economics, Prague, Zeman explained his dislike for Madeleine Albright, former US Secretary of State. Zeman stated that Albright had promised that there would be no bombardment of civilians during the 1999 NATO bombing of Serbia. &quot;And Madeleine Albright made a promise, and Madeleine Albright didn&#x27;t keep the promise. Since then, I don&#x27;t like her.&quot;
In March 2015, Zeman criticised protests against the US Army&#x27;s military convoy (called the &quot;Dragoon Ride&quot;) crossing the Czech Republic following NATO exercises in Poland and the Baltic states:

On 18 May 2021, during a visit by the president of Serbia, Aleksandar Vučić, Zeman apologized to Serbia for the 1999 NATO bombing, describing it as a &quot;mistake and worse than a crime&quot;.

===Poland=== 

In March 2016, Zeman defended Poland&#x27;s newly elected Law and Justice government, saying: “I expressed the view that the Polish government, which was created as a result of free elections, has every right to carry out activities for which it received a mandate in these elections. It should not be subject to moralising or criticism from the European Union, which should finally focus on its primary task – to protect the external borders of the Union.”

===Russia=== 
Zeman described the war in Donbas as &quot;a civil war between two groups of Ukrainian citizens&quot; with foreign support, and compared it to the Spanish Civil War. Regarding the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, he noted that the Kosovo precedent was used as an argument for the separation of Crimea from Ukraine.

Zeman announced that he intended to visit Moscow for the 2015 Victory Day celebrations and the 70th anniversary of the liberation from Nazi Germany. He said that he was not going to look at military equipment, but rather to honour the soldiers who had sacrificed their lives. He described his visit to Moscow as an &quot;expression of thankfulness that we in this country don&#x27;t have to speak German, if we would have become submissive collaborators of Aryan origin&quot;, and that &quot;we don&#x27;t have to say &quot;Heil Hitler&quot;, &quot;Heil Himmler&quot;, &quot;Heil Göring&quot;, and eventually &quot;Heil Heydrich&quot;, that would have been particularly interesting&quot;. Most other EU leaders declared that they would not attend the events due to the conflict in eastern Ukraine. U.S. ambassador Andrew H. Schapiro criticized the decision, saying that it would &quot;be awkward&quot; if Zeman was the only politician from the EU at the ceremony. Zeman responded by banning him from the Prague Castle.

The ban was later lifted by Zeman&#x27;s office.

In December 2019, Zeman criticised Russian protests against the Czech decision to recognise the anniversary of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 as a day commemorating the victims, describing it as &quot;absolute insolence&quot;.

In April 2021, Zeman cast doubt on Russia&#x27;s involvement in the 2014 Vrbětice ammunition warehouses explosions, suggesting that the deadly blast could have been caused accidentally due to the mishandling of explosives, and that there was no conclusive evidence to accuse Russia. In response, thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in Prague on 29 April 2021, calling Zeman &quot;a servant&quot; of Russia, and demanding he be tried for treason.

In response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Zeman called for Russia to be cut off from SWIFT. He condemned Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine and called for tough sanctions to isolate &quot;the madman&quot; Putin. On 1 March 2022, eight former signatories of Charter 77 including Petr Pithart and Anna Šabatová called on Zeman to resign over his previous support for Putin.

===Ukraine=== 

In 2015, Zeman, in response to a letter from a group of Czech and Ukrainian historians defending Stepan Bandera, leader of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN), wrote: &quot;I would like to point out that President Yushchenko declared Bandera a national hero, and a similar declaration in the case of Roman Shukhevych, who became known to have shot thousands of Jews in Lvov in 1941, is now being prepared. I can not congratulate Ukraine on such national heroes.&quot;

On 7 March 2022, Zeman decided to award Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy with the highest state award of the Czech Republic, the Order of the White Lion, for &quot;his bravery and courage in the face of Russia&#x27;s invasion&quot;.

==Criticism and controversies==

In 1996, before the legislative election, Zeman met with Czech-Swiss entrepreneur Jan Vízek in the German city of Bamberg. In the so-called &quot;Bamberg Memorandum&quot;, a group of Swiss entrepreneurs allegedly agreed to fund the ČSSD pre-election campaign in exchange for economic influence in the Czech Republic after the election. The investigation ended in 2000, with Vízek convicted of falsification of the memorandum by copying signatures from earlier documents. He later admitted that he had intentionally publicised the case in order to compromise Zeman before the next elections in 1998. Zeman was never charged with any wrongdoing, but the reason for the meetings between Zeman and Vízek in 1996 was never revealed.

In 1999, one of Zeman&#x27;s advisers, Jaroslav Novotný, allegedly blackmailed the director of the state-owned Štiřín Castle, Václav Hrubý. Novotný allegedly pressured him to falsify evidence in order to prove that former Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec corrupted journalists. The police confirmed the blackmail, but no charges were ever brought.

Zeman has been criticized for his contacts with the powerful Czech lobbyist Miroslav Šlouf, formerly his chief adviser. While Zeman was prime minister, Šlouf maintained contact with the controversial entrepreneur František Mrázek, nicknamed the &quot;Godfather of Czech Organized Crime&quot;. Šlouf and Mrázek met and exchanged information at the Office of the Czech Government. Mrázek was assassinated in 2006. In leaked wiretapping records, he nicknames Zeman &quot;mlha&quot; (&quot;fog&quot;) and claims that Zeman &quot;could not be bribed, and wanted only a sandwich, three pickles and for people to like him.&quot; In 2010, Šlouf and Martin Nejedlý, a representative of the Russian oil company LUKoil in the Czech Republic, were the main donors to his Party of Civic Rights – Zemanovci, but Zeman denied that he had any connection with Lukoil.

In 2002, German chancellor Gerhard Schröder cancelled an official visit to Prague after Zeman called the ethnic Germans in pre-war Czechoslovakia &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Fifth column&quot;. Zeman stated that &quot;the Czechs and Slovaks were doing the Sudeten Germans a favor by expelling them, because they granted them their wish to go Heim ins Reich&quot;. Later, Zeman called Karel Schwarzenberg, his rival in the presidential campaign of 2013, a &quot;sudeťák&quot; (Sudeten German), leading the Austrian &quot;Die Presse&quot; to ascribe Zeman&#x27;s victory to an &quot;unprecedented anti-German dirty campaign.&quot;

On 26 May 2014, during festivities celebrating the independence of Israel, Zeman said &quot;So let me quote one of their [Islamic] sacred texts to support this statement: &quot;A tree says, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him. A stone says, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him.&quot; I would criticize those calling for the killing of Arabs, but I do not know of any movement calling for mass murdering of Arabs. However, I know of one anti-civilization movement calling for the mass murder of Jews.&quot; When criticized and urged to apologise by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, his office replied &quot;President Zeman definitely does not intend to apologise. For the president would consider it blasphemy to apologise for the quotation of a sacred Islamic text.&quot;

Zeman&#x27;s comments on the Jewish Museum of Belgium shooting and &quot;Islamic ideology&quot; in June 2014 caused a diplomatic dispute with Saudi Arabia. The diplomatic source said: &quot;The Saudis had an exact list of what Zeman said on the issue in the past. The list had several pages. The [Czech] ambassador was in a very unpleasant situation as the protest had never gone so far before.&quot;

On 17 November 2014, the 25th anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, thousands of Czechs took part in a demonstration against Zeman, protesting his pro-Russian stance and vulgar language. Eggs were also thrown, with one accidentally hitting the German president, Joachim Gauck; German officials said it was just a piece of eggshell. On the same day, a group of about 60 people held a counter-demonstration in support of president Zeman.

In September 2017 Zeman suggested that Bosnia and Herzegovina could become a base for Islamic State, causing a diplomatic row and provoking criticism from President Bakir Izetbegović and the Bosniak public.

===Lawsuits===
Zeman has a long history of losing lawsuits regarding his public comments. In 1993 Zeman lost his lawsuit over his defamatory statement towards former police officer Milan Hruška. He falsely accused him of lack of intelligence and inadequate education. Zeman was fined, but ignored the court ruling and never apologised.

In 1997 Zeman accused his party colleague Jozef Wagner of wanting to join the Communist Party after leaving his faction in the Chamber of Deputies. Zeman lost the lawsuit and was ordered to apologise and pay compensation. Zeman initially ignored the ruling, before apologising in 2001. In 2000, Prague City court ordered Zeman to apologise to politician Miroslav Macek after he described him as a &quot;thief&quot;. In 2007, Prague City court ruled that Zeman had unlawfully accused journalist Ivan Brezina of corruption. Zeman was ordered to publicly apologise by means of a newspaper article and pay 50,000 CZK in damages.

On 19 February 2012, the Supreme Administrative Court ruled that Zeman&#x27;s campaign team had lied during the presidential campaign. According to the court ruling, this did not affect the outcome of the elections.

On 2 March 2016, The Prague 1 District Court ruled that Zeman had falsely accused well-known journalist Ferdinand Peroutka of comments that appeared to be positive about Adolf Hitler. According to the preliminary judgement the Office of the President had to publicly apologise to Terezie Kaslová, Peroutka&#x27;s descendant. After the final appeal failed, the president&#x27;s office announced on 23 September that it would appeal in the Supreme Court. Zeman said that he was not suffering from senile dementia and insisted that the article existed. His spokesperson Jiří Ovčáček has been looking for it since February 2015. The office was fined 100,000 Kč in October 2016 for failing to apologise. However, the Supreme Court stated on 28 October 2016 that the apology would not be necessary until the court had ruled on the Office&#x27;s appeal.

On 1 April 2024, Supreme Court of the Czech Republic ruled that Zeman in November 2017 had falsely informed about his former adviser Zdeňek Šarapatka of being fired for incompetence and was ordered to apologise. On 17 April 2024, Šarapatka received a letter with Zeman&#x27;s apology for his defamatory statement.

==Personal life==

In the 1970s, Zeman was married to Blanka Zemanová; the couple divorced in 1978. In 1993, he married his assistant Ivana Bednarčíková (born 29 April 1965).

He has an adult son named David from his first marriage. His daughter from the second, Kateřina Zemanová (born 1 January 1994), was one of the most visible faces in Zeman&#x27;s presidential election team. In a post-election speech, Zeman asked her to be his &quot;informal First Lady&quot;, as his wife is reportedly shy and does not like media attention. When asked about his religious beliefs, he describes himself as a &quot;tolerant atheist&quot;.

Zeman is a heavy drinker and long-term chain smoker. He only slightly curbed his consumption of alcohol and cigarettes after being diagnosed with diabetes in 2015. He is also suffering from diabetic neuropathy in the feet, which causes him difficulties when walking and sometimes requires him to use a wheelchair. In March 2024, he was hospitalized in serious but stable condition and underwent surgery following a blood clot in his leg. He was discharged in April.

<doc id="673347" wikidata="Q1144708" url="?curid=673347" title="Anti-Chinese sentiment">
<text>Anti-Chinese sentiment (also referred to as Sinophobia) is the fear or dislike of Chinese people and/or Chinese culture. 

It is frequently directed at Chinese minorities which live outside Greater China and involves immigration, nationalism, political ideologies, disparity of wealth, the past tributary system of Imperial China, majority-minority relations, imperial legacies, and racism.

A variety of popular cultural clichés and negative stereotypes of Chinese people have existed around the world since the twentieth century, and they are frequently conflated with a variety of popular cultural clichés and negative stereotypes of other Asian ethnic groups, known as the Yellow Peril. Some individuals may harbor prejudice or hatred against Chinese people due to history, racism, modern politics, cultural differences, propaganda, or ingrained stereotypes.

The COVID-19 pandemic led to resurgent Sinophobia, whose manifestations range from as subtle acts of discrimination such as microaggression and stigmatization, exclusion and shunning, to more overt forms, such as outright verbal abuse, slurs and name-calling, and sometimes physical violence.

==History==
===Looting and sacking of national treasures===

Historical records document the existence of anti-Chinese sentiment throughout China&#x27;s imperial wars.

Lord Palmerston was responsible for sparking the First Opium War (1839–1842) with Qing China. He considered Chinese culture &quot;uncivilized&quot;, and his negative views on China played a significant role in his decision to issue a declaration of war. This disdain became increasingly common throughout the Second Opium War (1856–1860), when repeated attacks against foreign traders in China inflamed anti-Chinese sentiment abroad. Following the defeat of China in the Second Opium War, Lord Elgin, upon his arrival in Peking in 1860, ordered the sacking and burning of China&#x27;s imperial Summer Palace in vengeance.

===Chinese Exclusion Act 1882===

In the United States, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was passed in response to growing Sinophobia. It prohibited all immigration of Chinese laborers and turned those already in the country into second-class persons. The 1882 Act was the first U.S. immigration law to target a specific ethnicity or nationality. Meanwhile, during the mid-19th century in Peru, Chinese were used as slave labor and they were not allowed to hold any important positions in Peruvian society.
===Chinese workers in England===

Chinese workers had been a fixture on London&#x27;s docks since the mid-eighteenth century, when they arrived as sailors who were employed by the East India Company, importing tea and spices from the Far East. Conditions on those long voyages were so dreadful that many sailors decided to abscond and take their chances on the streets rather than face the return journey. Those who stayed generally settled around the bustling docks, running laundries and small lodging houses for other sailors or selling exotic Asian produce. By the 1880s, a small but recognizable Chinese community had developed in the Limehouse area, increasing Sinophobic sentiments among other Londoners, who feared the Chinese workers might take over their traditional jobs due to their willingness to work for much lower wages and longer hours than other workers in the same industries. The entire Chinese population of London was only in the low hundreds—in a city whose entire population was roughly estimated to be seven million—but nativist feelings ran high, as was evidenced by the Aliens Act of 1905, a bundle of legislation which sought to restrict the entry of poor and low-skilled foreign workers. Chinese Londoners also became involved with illegal criminal organisations, further spurring Sinophobic sentiments.

== By region ==
===East Asia===
====Korea====
Discriminatory views of Chinese people have been reported, and ethnic-Chinese Koreans have faced prejudices including what is said, to be a widespread criminal stigma. Increased anti-Chinese sentiments had reportedly led to online comments calling the Nanjing Massacre the &quot;Nanjing Grand Festival&quot; or others such as &quot;Good Chinese are only dead Chinese&quot; and &quot;I want to kill Korean Chinese&quot;.

====Japan====
A survey in 2017 suggested that 51% of Chinese respondents had experienced tenancy discrimination. Another report in the same year noted a significant bias against Chinese visitors from the media and some of the Japanese locals.

====Mongolia====
Mongolian nationalist and Neo-Nazi groups are reported to be hostile to China, and Mongolians traditionally hold unfavorable views of the country. The common stereotype is that China is trying to undermine Mongolian sovereignty in order to eventually make it part of China (the Republic of China has claimed Mongolia as part of its territory, see Outer Mongolia). Fear and hatred of &quot;erliiz&quot; (, , literally, double seeds), a derogatory term for people of mixed Han Chinese and Mongol ethnicity, is a common phenomena in Mongolian politics. &quot;Erliiz&quot; are seen as a Chinese plot of &quot;genetic pollution&quot; to chip away at Mongolian sovereignty, and allegations of Chinese ancestry are used as a political weapon in election campaigns. Several small Neo-Nazi groups opposing Chinese influence and mixed Chinese couples are present within Mongolia, such as Tsagaan Khas.

====Taiwan====
In the late 1940s, the anti-mainland Chinese term &quot;The dogs go and the pigs come&quot; became popular in Taiwanese society as a result of dissatisfaction with the Republic of China controlled by a one-party system of KMT&#x27;s rule and the February 28 incident caused by KMT regime.

In 2016, &quot;Islanders&#x27; Anti-China Coalition&quot;, a radical anti-communist organization, was formed; they actively support Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Inner Mongolian independence.

===Southeast Asia===
====Malaysia====
Due to race-based politics and Bumiputera policy, there had been several incidents of racial conflict between the Malays and Chinese before the 1969 riots. For example, in Penang, hostility between the races turned into violence during the centenary celebration of George Town in 1957 which resulted in several days of fighting and a number of deaths, and there were further disturbances in 1959 and 1964, as well as a riot in 1967 which originated as a protest against currency devaluation but turned into racial killings. In Singapore, the antagonism between the races led to the 1964 Race Riots which contributed to the expulsion of Singapore from Malaysia on August 9, 1965. The 13 May Incident was perhaps the deadliest race riot to have occurred in Malaysia with an official combined death toll of 196 (143 Chinese, 25 Malays, 13 Indians, and 15 others of undetermined ethnicity), but with higher estimates by other observers reaching around 600-800+ total deaths.

Malaysia&#x27;s ethnic quota system has been regarded as discriminatory towards the ethnic Chinese (and Indian) community, in favor of ethnic Malay Muslims, which has reportedly created a brain drain in the country. In 2015, supporters of Najib Razak&#x27;s party reportedly marched in the thousands through Chinatown to support him, and assert Malay political power with threats to burn down shops, which drew criticism from China&#x27;s ambassador to Malaysia.

It was reported in 2019 that relations between ethnic Chinese Malaysians and Malays were &quot;at their lowest ebb&quot;, and fake news posted online of mainland Chinese indiscriminately receiving citizenship in the country had been stoking racial tensions. The primarily Chinese-based Democratic Action Party in Malaysia has also reportedly faced an onslaught of fake news depicting it as unpatriotic, anti-Malay, and anti-Muslim. 

====Philippines====
The Spanish introduced the first anti-Chinese laws in the Philippine archipelago. The Spanish massacred or expelled the Chinese several times from Manila, and the Chinese responded by fleeing either to La Pampanga or to territories outside colonial control, particularly the Sulu Sultanate, which they in turn supported in their wars against the Spanish authorities. The Chinese refugees not only ensured that the Sūg people were supplied with the requisite arms but also joined their new compatriots in combat operations against the Spaniards during the centuries of Spanish–Moro conflict.

Furthermore, racial classification from the Spanish and American administrations has labeled ethnic Chinese as alien. This association between &#x27;Chinese&#x27; and &#x27;foreigner&#x27; have facilitated discrimination against the ethnic Chinese population in the Philippines; many ethnic Chinese were denied citizenship or viewed as antithetical to a Filipino nation-state. In addition to this, Chinese people have been associated with wealth in the background of great economic disparity among the local population. This perception has only contributed to ethnic tensions in the Philippines, with the ethnic Chinese population being portrayed as being a major party in controlling the economy.

====Indonesia====
The Dutch introduced anti-Chinese laws in the Dutch East Indies. The Dutch colonialists started the first massacre of Chinese in the 1740 Batavia massacre in which tens of thousands died. The Java War (1741–43) followed shortly thereafter.

The asymmetrical economic position between ethnic Chinese Indonesians and indigenous Indonesians has incited anti-Chinese sentiment among the poorer majorities. During the Indonesian killings of 1965–66, in which more than 500,000 people died (mostly non-Chinese Indonesians), ethnic Chinese were killed and their properties looted and burned as a result of anti-Chinese racism on the excuse that Dipa &quot;Amat&quot; Aidit had brought the PKI closer to China. In the May 1998 riots of Indonesia following the fall of President Suharto, many ethnic Chinese were targeted by other Indonesian rioters, resulting in extensive looting. However, when Chinese-owned supermarkets were targeted for looting most of the dead were not ethnic Chinese, but the looters themselves, who were burnt to death by the hundreds when a fire broke out.

====Myanmar====
Chinese people in Myanmar have also been subject to discriminatory laws and rhetoric in Burmese media and popular culture.

====Thailand====
Historically, Thailand (called Siam before 1939) has been seen as a China-friendly country, owing to close Chinese-Siamese relations, a large proportion of the Thai population being of Chinese descent and Chinese having been assimilated into mainstream society over the years.

In 1914, King Rama VI Vajiravudh originated the phrase &quot;Jews of the Orient&quot; to describe Chinese. He published an essay using Western antisemitic tropes to characterize Chinese as &quot;vampires who steadily suck dry an unfortunate victim&#x27;s lifeblood&quot; because of their perceived lack of loyalty to Siam and the fact that they sent money back to China.

Later, Plaek Phibunsongkhram launched a massive Thaification, the main purpose of which was Central Thai supremacy, including the oppression of Thailand&#x27;s Chinese population and restricting Thai Chinese culture by banning the teaching of the Chinese language and forcing Thai Chinese to adopt Thai names. Plaek&#x27;s obsession with creating a pan-Thai nationalist agenda caused resentment among general officers (most of Thai general officers at the time were of Teochew background) until he was removed from office in 1944. 

====Vietnam====
There are strong anti-Chinese sentiments among the Vietnamese population, stemming in part from a past thousand years of Chinese rule in Northern Vietnam. A long history of Sino-Vietnamese conflicts followed, with repeated wars over the centuries. Though current relations are peaceful, numerous wars were fought between the two nations in the past, from the time of the Early Lê dynasty (10th century) to the Sino-Vietnamese War from 1979 to 1989.

Shortly after the 1975 Vietnamese defeat of the United States in the Vietnam War, the Vietnamese government persecuted the Chinese community by confiscating property and businesses owned by overseas Chinese in Vietnam and expelling the ethnic Chinese minority into southern Chinese provinces. In February 1976, Vietnam implemented registration programs in the south. Ethnic Chinese in Vietnam were required to adopt Vietnamese citizenship or leave the country. In early 1977, Vietnam implemented what it described as a purification policy in its border areas to keep Chinese border residents to the Chinese side of the border. Following another discriminatory policy introduced in March 1978, a large number of Chinese fled from Vietnam to southern China. China and Vietnam attempted to negotiate issues related to Vietnam&#x27;s treatment of ethnic Chinese, but these negotiations failed to resolve the issues. During the August 1978 Youyi Pass Incident, the Vietnamese army and police expelled 2,500 refugees across the order into China. Vietnamese authorities beat and stabbed refugees during the incident, including 9 Chinese civilian border workers. From 1978 to 1979, some 450,000 ethnic Chinese left Vietnam by boat (mainly former South Vietnam citizens fleeing the Vietcong) as refugees or were expelled across the land border with China.

The 1979 Sino-Vietnamese War resulted in part from Vietnam&#x27;s mistreatment of ethnic Chinese. The conflict fueled racist discrimination against and consequent emigration by the country&#x27;s ethnic Chinese population.These mass emigrations and deportations only stopped in 1989 following the Đổi mới reforms in Vietnam. 

===South Asia===
====India====
During the Sino-Indian War, the Chinese faced hostile sentiment all over India. Chinese businesses were investigated for links to the Chinese government and many Chinese were interned in prisons in North India. The Indian government passed the Defence of India Act in December 1962, permitting the &quot;apprehension and detention in custody of any person hostile to the country.&quot; The broad language of the act allowed for the arrest of any person simply for having a Chinese surname or a Chinese spouse. The Indian government incarcerated thousands of Chinese-Indians in an internment camp in Deoli, Rajasthan, where they were held for years without trial. The last internees were not released until 1967. Thousands more Chinese-Indians were forcibly deported or coerced to leave India. Nearly all internees had their properties sold off or looted. Even after their release, the Chinese Indians faced many restrictions on their freedom. They could not travel freely until the mid-1990s.

===Oceania===
====Australia====
The Chinese population was active in political and social life in Australia. Community leaders protested against discriminatory legislation and attitudes, and despite the passing of the Immigration Restriction Act in 1901, Chinese communities around Australia participated in parades and celebrations of Australia&#x27;s Federation and the visit of the Duke and Duchess of York.

Although the Chinese communities in Australia were generally peaceful and industrious, resentment flared up against them because of their different customs and traditions. In the mid-19th century, terms such as &quot;dirty, disease-ridden, [and] insect-like&quot; were used in Australia and New Zealand to describe the Chinese.

A poll tax was passed in Victoria in 1855 to restrict Chinese immigration. New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia followed suit. Such legislation did not distinguish between naturalised, British citizens, Australian-born, and Chinese-born individuals. The tax in Victoria and New South Wales was repealed in the 1860s.

In the 1870s and 1880s, the Growing trade union movement began a series of protests against foreign labour. Their arguments were that Asians and Chinese took jobs away from white men, worked for &quot;substandard&quot; wages, lowered working conditions, and refused unionisation. Objections to these arguments came largely from wealthy land owners in rural areas. It was argued that without Asiatics to work in the tropical areas of the Northern Territory and Queensland, the area would have to be abandoned. Despite these objections to restricting immigration, between 1875 and 1888 all Australian colonies enacted legislation that excluded all further Chinese immigration.

In 1888, following protests and strike actions, an inter-colonial conference agreed to reinstate and increase the severity of restrictions on Chinese immigration. This provided the basis for the 1901 Immigration Restriction Act and the seed for the White Australia Policy, which although relaxed over time, was not fully abandoned until the early 1970s.

The Chifley government&#x27;s &quot;Darwin Lands Acquisition Act 1945&quot; compulsorily acquired of land owned by Chinese-Australians in Darwin, the capital of the Northern Territory, leading to the end of the local Chinatown. Two years earlier, the territory&#x27;s administrator Aubrey Abbott had written to Joseph Carrodus, secretary of the Department of the Interior, proposing a combination of compulsory acquisition and conversion of the land to leasehold in order to effect &quot;the elimination of undesirable elements which Darwin has suffered from far too much in the past&quot; and stated that he hoped to &quot;entirely prevent the Chinese quarter forming again&quot;. He further observed that &quot;if land is acquired from the former Chinese residents there is really no need for them to return as they have no other assets&quot;. The territory&#x27;s civilian population had mostly been evacuated during the war and the former Chinatown residents returned to find their homes and businesses reduced to rubble.

====New Zealand====
In the 1800s, Chinese citizens were encouraged to immigrate to New Zealand because they were needed to fulfill agricultural jobs during a time of white labor shortage. The arrival of foreign laborers was met with hostility and the formation of anti-Chinese immigrant groups, such as the Anti-Chinese League, the Anti-Asiatic League, the Anti-Chinese Association, and the White New Zealand League. Official discrimination began with the Chinese Immigrants Act of 1881, limiting Chinese emigration to New Zealand and excluding Chinese citizens from major jobs. Anti-Chinese sentiment had declined by the mid-20th century.

==== Papua New Guinea ====
In May 2009, during the Papua New Guinea riots, Chinese-owned businesses were looted by gangs in the capital city Port Moresby, amid simmering anti-Chinese sentiment reported in the country. There are fears that these riots will force many Chinese business owners and entrepreneurs to leave the South Pacific country, which would invariably lead to further damage on an impoverished economy that had a 80% unemployment rate. Thousands of people were reportedly involved in the riots.

====Tonga====
In 2000, Tongan noble Tu&#x27;ivakano of Nukunuku banned Chinese stores from his Nukunuku District in Tonga. This followed complaints from other shopkeepers regarding competition from local Chinese.

In 2006, rioters damaged shops owned by Chinese-Tongans in Nukualofa.

====Solomon Islands====
In 2006, Honiara&#x27;s Chinatown suffered damage when it was looted and burned by rioters following a contested election. Ethnic Chinese businessmen were falsely blamed for bribing members of the Solomon Islands&#x27; Parliament. The government of Taiwan was the one that supported the then-current government of the Solomon Islands. The Chinese businessmen were mainly small traders from mainland China and had no interest in local politics.

=== Europe===

Anti-Chinese sentiment became more common as China was becoming a major source of immigrants for the west (including the American West). Numerous Chinese immigrants to North America were attracted by wages offered by large railway companies in the late 19th century as the companies built the transcontinental railroads.

Anti-Chinese policies persisted in the 20th century in the English-speaking world, including the Chinese Exclusion Act, the Chinese Immigration Act of 1923, anti-Chinese zoning laws and restrictive covenants, the policies of Richard Seddon, and the White Australia policy

====France====
In France, there has been a long history of systemic racism towards the Chinese population, with many people stereotyping them as easy targets for crime. As a result, France&#x27;s ethnic Chinese population have been common victims of racism and crime, which include assaults, robbery, and murder; it is common for Chinese business owners to have their businesses robbed and destroyed. There have been rising incidents of anti-Chinese racism in France; many Chinese, including French celebrity Frederic Chau, want more support from the French government. In September 2016, at least 15,000 Chinese participated in an anti-Asian racism protest in Paris.

====Germany====
In 2016, Günther Oettinger, the former European Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society, called Chinese people derogatory names, including &quot;sly dogs&quot;, in a speech to executives in Hamburg and had refused to apologize for several days. 

====Italy====
Although historical relations between two were friendly and even Marco Polo paid a visit to China, during the Boxer Rebellion, Italy was part of Eight-Nation Alliance against the rebellion, thus this had stemmed anti-Chinese sentiment in Italy. Italian troops looted, burnt, and stole a lot of Chinese goods to Italy, many are still being displayed in Italian museums.

==== Portugal ====
In the 16th century, increasing sea trades between Europe to China had led Portuguese merchants to China, however Portuguese military ambitions for power and its fear of China&#x27;s interventions and brutality had led to the growth of sinophobia in Portugal. Galiote Pereira, a Portuguese Jesuit missionary who was imprisoned by Chinese authorities, claimed China&#x27;s juridical treatment known as &quot;bastinado&quot; was so horrible as it hit on human flesh, becoming the source of fundamental anti-Chinese sentiment later; as well as brutality, the cruelty of China and Chinese tyranny. With the Ming dynasty&#x27;s brutal reactions on Portuguese merchants following the conquest of Malacca, sinophobia became widespread in Portugal, and widely practiced until the First Opium War, which the Qing dynasty was forced to cede Macao to Portugal.

==== Russia ====

====Spain====
Spain first issued anti-Chinese legislation when Limahong, a Chinese pirate, attacked Spanish settlements in the Philippines. One of his famous actions was a failed invasion of Manila in 1574, which he launched with the support of Chinese and Moro pirates. The Spanish conquistadors massacred the Chinese or expelled them from Manila several times, notably the autumn 1603 massacre of Chinese in Manila, and the reasons for this uprising remain unclear. Its motives range from the desire of the Chinese to dominate Manila, to their desire to abort the Spaniards&#x27; moves which seemed to lead to their elimination. The Spaniards quelled the rebellion and massacred around 20,000 Chinese. The Chinese responded by fleeing to the Sulu Sultanate and supporting the Moro Muslims in their war against the Spanish. The Chinese supplied the Moros with weapons and joined them in directly fighting against the Spanish during the Spanish–Moro conflict. Spain also upheld a plan to conquer China, but it never materialized.

====United Kingdom====
15% of ethnic Chinese reported racial harassment in 2016, which was the highest percentage out of all ethnic minorities in the UK. The Chinese community has been victims of racially-aggravated attacks and murders, verbal accounts of racism, and vandalism. There is also a lack of reporting on anti-Chinese discrimination in the UK, notably violence against Chinese Britons.

The ethnic slur &quot;chink&quot; has been used against the Chinese community; Dave Whelan, the former owner of Wigan Athletic, was fined £50,000 and suspended for six weeks by The Football Association after using the term in an interview; Kerry Smith resigned as an election candidate after it was reported he used similar language.

Professor Gary Craig from Durham University carried out research about the Chinese population in the UK, and concluded that hate crimes against the Chinese community are getting worse, adding that British Chinese people experience &quot;perhaps even higher levels of racial violence or harassment than those experienced by any other minority group but that the true extent to their victimization is often overlooked because victims were unwilling to report it.&quot; Official police victim statistics put Chinese people in a group that includes other ethnicities, making it difficult to understand the extent of the crimes against the Chinese community.

=== Americas===
====Canada====
In the 1850s, sizable numbers of Chinese immigrants came to British Columbia during the gold rush; the region was known to them as Gold Mountain. Starting in 1858, Chinese &quot;coolies&quot; were brought to Canada to work in the mines and on the Canadian Pacific Railway. However, they were denied by law the rights of citizenship, including the right to vote, and in the 1880s, &quot;head taxes&quot; were implemented to curtail immigration from China. In 1907, a riot in Vancouver targeted Chinese and Japanese-owned businesses. In 1923, the federal government banned Chinese immigration outright, passing the &quot;Chinese Immigration Act&quot;, commonly known as the &quot;Exclusion Act&quot;, prohibiting further Chinese immigration except under &quot;special circumstances&quot;. The Exclusion Act was repealed in 1947, the same year in which Chinese Canadians were given the right to vote. Restrictions would continue to exist on immigration from Asia until 1967 when all racial restrictions on immigration to Canada were repealed, and Canada adopted the current points-based immigration system. On June 22, 2006, Prime Minister Stephen Harper offered an apology and compensation only for the head tax once paid by Chinese immigrants. Survivors or their spouses were paid approximately CA$20,000 in compensation.

====Mexico====

Anti-Chinese sentiment was first recorded in Mexico in 1880s. Similar to most Western countries at the time, Chinese immigration and its large business involvement have always been a fear for native Mexicans. Violence against Chinese occurred such as in Sonora, Baja California and Coahuila, the most notable was the Torreón massacre.

====Peru====
Peru was a popular destination for Chinese slaves in the 19th century, as part of the wider blackbirding phenomenon, due to the need in Peru for a military and laborer workforce. However, relations between Chinese workers and Peruvian owners have been tense, due to the mistreatment of Chinese laborers and anti-Chinese discrimination in Peru.

Due to the Chinese support for Chile throughout the War of the Pacific, relations between Peruvians and Chinese became increasingly tenser in the aftermath. After the war, armed indigenous peasants sacked and occupied haciendas of landed elite criollo &quot;collaborationists&quot; in the central Sierra – the majority of them were of ethnic Chinese, while indigenous and mestizo Peruvians murdered Chinese shopkeepers in Lima; in response to Chinese coolies revolted and even joined the Chilean Army. Even in the 20th century, the memory of Chinese support for Chile was so deep that Manuel A. Odría, once dictator of Peru, issued a ban against Chinese immigration as a punishment for their betrayal.

====United States====


Starting with the California Gold Rush in the 19th century, the United States—particularly the West Coast states—imported large numbers of Chinese migrant laborers. Employers believed that the Chinese were &quot;reliable&quot; workers who would continue working, without complaint, even under harsh conditions. The migrant workers encountered considerable prejudice in the United States, especially among the people who occupied the lower layers of white society, because Chinese &quot;coolies&quot; were used as scapegoats for depressed wage levels by politicians and labor leaders. Cases of physical assaults on the Chinese include the Chinese massacre of 1871 in Los Angeles. The 1909 murder of Elsie Sigel in New York, for which a Chinese person was suspected, was blamed on the Chinese in general and it immediately led to physical violence against them. &quot;The murder of Elsie Sigel immediately grabbed the front pages of newspapers, which portrayed Chinese men as dangerous to &quot;innocent&quot; and &quot;virtuous&quot; young white women. This murder led to a surge in the harassment of Chinese in communities across the United States.&quot;

The emerging American trade unions, under such leaders as Samuel Gompers, also took an outspoken anti-Chinese position, regarding Chinese laborers as competitors to white laborers. Only with the emergence of the international trade union, IWW, did trade unionists start to accept Chinese workers as part of the American working class.
In the 1870s and 1880s, various legal discriminatory measures were taken against the Chinese. These laws, in particular, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, were aimed at restricting further immigration from China. although the laws were later repealed by the Chinese Exclusion Repeal Act of 1943. In particular, even in his lone dissent against &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; (1896), then-Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan wrote of the Chinese as: &quot;a race so different from our own that we do not permit those belonging to it to become citizens of the United States. Persons belonging to it are, with few exceptions, absolutely excluded from our country. I allude to the Chinese race.&quot;

In April 2008, CNN&#x27;s Jack Cafferty remarked: &quot;We continue to import their junk with the lead paint on them and the poisoned pet food [...] So I think our relationship with China has certainly changed. I think they&#x27;re basically the same bunch of goons and thugs they&#x27;ve been for the last 50 years.&quot; At least 1,500 Chinese Americans protested outside CNN&#x27;s Hollywood offices in response while a similar protest took place at CNN headquarters in Atlanta.

== Anti-Han sentiment ==
Anti-Han sentiment refers to fear or dislike ethnic Han people. Anti-Han sentiment includes hostility towards Han Taiwanese as well as mainland Han Chinese. Since the proportion of Han people in China&#x27;s ethnic composition is absolute, the anti-Han sentiment is closely related to the anti-Chinese sentiment.

== Derogatory terms ==
There are a variety of derogatory terms for Chinese people. Many of these terms are racist.

=== In English ===
* Chinaman – the term Chinaman is noted as offensive by modern dictionaries, dictionaries of slurs and euphemisms, and guidelines for racial harassment.
* Ching chong – Used to mock people of Chinese descent and the Chinese language, or other East and Southeast Asian-looking people in general.
* Ching chang chong – same usage as &#x27;ching chong&#x27;.
* Chink – a racial slur referring to a person of Chinese ethnicity, but could be directed towards anyone of East and Southeast Asian descent in general.

(The standard term is &quot;Tsino&quot;, derived from the Spanish &quot;chino&quot;, with the colloquial &quot;Tsinoy&quot; referring specifically to Chinese Filipinos.) The originally neutral term recently gained negative connotation with the increasing preference of Chinese Filipinos not to be referred to as &quot;Intsik&quot;. The term originally came from &quot;in chiek&quot;, a Hokkien term referring to one&#x27;s uncle. The term has variations, which may be more offensive in tone such as &quot;Intsik baho&quot; and may used in a derogatory phrase, &quot;Intsik baho tulo-laway&quot; (&quot;Smelly old Chinaman with drooling saliva&quot;).
* Tsekwa (sometimes spelled &quot;chekwa&quot;) – is a slang term used by the Filipinos to refer to Chinese people.

* – Japanese reading of the Chinese character compound &quot;&quot; (&quot;Zhina&quot; in Mandarin Chinese), originally a Chinese transcription of an Indic name for China that entered East Asia with the spread of Buddhism. This toponym quickly became a racial marker with the rise of Japanese imperialism, and it is still considered derogatory, as is &#x27;shina-jin&#x27;. The slur is also extended toward left-wing activists by right-wing people.
* – derogatory term originating from a corruption of the Taiwanese Hokkien pronunciation of 清國奴 &quot;Chheng-kok-lô͘&quot;, used to refer to any &quot;Chinaman&quot;, with a meaning of &quot;Qing dynasty&#x27;s slave&quot;.

=== In Korean ===

* Uzkoglazy ( &quot;uzkoglázy&quot;) (m) – generic derogatory term referring to Chinese people (lit. &quot;narrow-eyed&quot;).

=== In Spanish ===
* Chino cochino – (coe-chee-noe, N.A. &quot;cochini&quot;, SPAN &quot;cochino&quot;, literally meaning &quot;pig&quot;) is an outdated derogatory term meaning dirty Chinese. Cochina is the feminine form of the word.

=== In Italian ===
* Muso giallo – &quot;yellow muzzle/yellow face&quot;, this term was used in an early 20th century play regarding Italian miners. Although it was not directed toward a Chinese person, but rather from one Italian to another, its existence nevertheless attested to the perceived &#x27;otherness&#x27; of Chinese laborers within Italy. The slur is used as an equivalent of &quot;gook&quot; or &quot;zipperhead&quot; in Italian dubs of English films.

=== In Thai ===

== Sinophobia during the COVID-19 pandemic ==
The COVID-19 pandemic, in which the virus was first detected in Wuhan, has caused prejudice and racism against people of Chinese ancestry; some people stated that Chinese people deserve to contract it. This led to multiple acts of severe violence against people of Chinese ancestry, and those supposed, wrongly, to have been of Chinese ancestry as well.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, victims of violence and verbal abuse range from toddlers to elderly, school children and their parents, and include not just mainland Chinese, but has affected also Taiwanese, Hong Kongers, members of the Chinese diaspora and other Asians who are mistaken for or associated with them.

Several citizens across the globe also demanded a ban on Chinese people from their countries. Racist abuse and assaults among Asian groups in the UK and US have also increased. Former U.S. President Donald Trump also repeatedly called the coronavirus &#x27;Chinese virus&#x27;, however, he denied the term had a racist connotation.

<text>An OLAP cube is a multi-dimensional array of data. Online analytical processing (OLAP) is a computer-based technique of analyzing data to look for insights. The term &quot;cube&quot; here refers to a multi-dimensional dataset, which is also sometimes called a hypercube if the number of dimensions is greater than three.

== Terminology ==
A cube can be considered a multi-dimensional generalization of a two- or three-dimensional spreadsheet. For example, a company might wish to summarize financial data by product, by time-period, and by city to compare actual and budget expenses. Product, time, city and scenario (actual and budget) are the data&#x27;s dimensions.

&quot;Cube&quot; is a shorthand for &quot;multidimensional dataset&quot;, given that data can have an arbitrary number of &quot;dimensions&quot;. The term hypercube is sometimes used, especially for data with more than three dimensions. A cube is not a &quot;cube&quot; in the strict mathematical sense, as the sides are not all necessarily equal. But this term is used widely.

A &quot;Slice&quot; is a term for a subset of the data, generated by picking a value for one dimension and only showing the data for that value (for instance only the data at one point in time). Spreadsheets are only 2-dimensional, so by (continued) slicing or other techniques, it becomes possible to visualise multidimensional data in them.

Each cell of the cube holds a number that represents some &quot;measure&quot; of the business, such as sales, profits, expenses, budget and forecast.

OLAP data is typically stored in a star schema or snowflake schema in a relational data warehouse or in a special-purpose data management system. Measures are derived from the records in the fact table and dimensions are derived from the dimension tables.

== Hierarchy ==
The elements of a dimension can be organized as a hierarchy, a set of parent-child relationships, typically where a parent member summarizes its children. Parent elements can further be aggregated as the children of another parent.

For example, May 2005&#x27;s parent is Second Quarter 2005 which is in turn the child of Year 2005. Similarly cities are the children of regions; products roll into product groups and individual expense items into types of expenditure.

== Operations ==
Conceiving data as a cube with hierarchical dimensions leads to conceptually straightforward operations to facilitate analysis. Aligning the data content with a familiar visualization enhances analyst learning and productivity. The user-initiated process of navigating by calling for page displays interactively, through the specification of slices via rotations and drill down/up is sometimes called &quot;slice and dice&quot;. Common operations include slice and dice, drill down, roll up, and pivot.
&quot;Slice&quot; is the act of picking a rectangular subset of a cube by choosing a single value for one of its dimensions, creating a new cube with one fewer dimension. The picture shows a slicing operation: The sales figures of all sales regions and all product categories of the company in the year 2005 and 2006 are &quot;sliced&quot; out of the data cube.

&quot;Dice&quot;: The dice operation produces a subcube by allowing the analyst to pick specific values of multiple dimensions. The picture shows a dicing operation: The new cube shows the sales figures of a limited number of product categories, the time and region dimensions cover the same range as before.

&quot;Drill Down/Up&quot; allows the user to navigate among levels of data ranging from the most summarized (up) to the most detailed (down).
The picture shows a drill-down operation: The analyst moves from the summary category &quot;Outdoor protective equipment&quot; to see the sales figures for the individual products.
&quot;Roll-up&quot;: A roll-up involves summarizing the data along a dimension. The summarization rule might be an aggregate function, such as computing totals along a hierarchy or applying a set of formulas such as &quot;profit = sales - expenses&quot;. General aggregation functions may be costly to compute when rolling up: if they cannot be determined from the cells of the cube, they must be computed from the base data, either computing them online (slow) or precomputing them for possible rollouts (large space). Aggregation functions that can be determined from the cells are known as decomposable aggregation functions, and allow efficient computation. For example, it is easy to support codice_1 and codice_2 in OLAP, since these can be computed for each cell of the OLAP cube and then rolled up, since on overall sum (or count etc.) is the sum of sub-sums, but it is difficult to support codice_3, as that must be computed for every view separately: the median of a set is not the median of medians of subsets.

&quot;Pivot&quot; allows an analyst to rotate the cube in space to see its various faces. For example, cities could be arranged vertically and products horizontally while viewing data for a particular quarter. Pivoting could replace products with time periods to see data across time for a single product.

The picture shows a pivoting operation: The whole cube is rotated, giving another perspective on the data.
== Mathematical definition ==

In database theory, an OLAP cube is an abstract representation of a projection of an RDBMS relation. Given a relation of order &quot;N&quot;, consider a projection that subtends &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, and &quot;Z&quot; as the key and &quot;W&quot; as the residual attribute. Characterizing this as a function,

:&quot;f&quot; : (&quot;X&quot;,&quot;Y&quot;,&quot;Z&quot;) → &quot;W&quot;,

the attributes &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, and &quot;Z&quot; correspond to the axes of the cube, while the &quot;W&quot; value corresponds to the data element that populates each cell of the cube.

Insofar as two-dimensional output devices cannot readily characterize three dimensions, it is more practical to project &quot;slices&quot; of the data cube (we say &quot;project&quot; in the classic vector analytic sense of dimensional reduction, not in the SQL sense, although the two are conceptually similar),

:&quot;g&quot; : (&quot;X&quot;,&quot;Y&quot;) → &quot;W&quot;

which may suppress a primary key, but still have some semantic significance, perhaps a slice of the triadic functional representation for a given &quot;Z&quot; value of interest.

The motivation behind OLAP displays harks back to the &quot;cross-tabbed report&quot; paradigm of 1980s DBMS, and to earlier contingency tables from 1904. The result is a spreadsheet-style display, where values of &quot;X&quot; populate row $1; values of &quot;Y&quot; populate column $A; and values of &quot;g&quot; : ( &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot; ) → &quot;W&quot; populate the individual cells at intersections of &quot;X&quot;-labeled columns and &quot;Y&quot;-labeled rows, &quot;southeast&quot;, so to speak, of $B$2, with $B$2 itself included.

<text>Herbert John Louis Hinkler (8 December 1892 – 7 January 1933), better known as Bert Hinkler, was a pioneer Australian aviator (dubbed &quot;Australian Lone Eagle&quot;) and inventor. He designed and built early aircraft before being the first person to fly solo from England to Australia, completed on 22 February 1928, and the first person to fly solo across the Southern Atlantic Ocean. He married in 1932 at the age of 39, and died less than a year later after crashing into remote countryside near Arezzo, Tuscany, Italy during a solo flight record attempt.

==Early life==
Hinkler was born in Bundaberg, Queensland, the son of John William Hinkler, a Prussian-born stockman, and his wife Frances Atkins (née Bonney) Hinkler. In his childhood, Hinkler would observe ibis flying near a lake at his school. After gaining an understanding on the principles of flight, he constructed two gliders. In 1912 he launched one of his first home-made gliders on Mon Repos Beach and flew above the sand dunes.

He later met Arthur Burr Stone at a travelling show in Bundaberg and again at the Brisbane Exhibition where Hinkler worked with Stone to solve a problem with the &quot;Blériot&quot;, the world&#x27;s first monoplane. In 1913, Hinkler went to England where he worked for the Sopwith Aviation Company, the beginning of his career in aviation.

==World War I==
During the First World War, Hinkler served with the Royal Naval Air Service as a gunner/observer in Belgium and France, for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal. In 1918 Hinkler was posted to No. 28 Squadron RAF with which he served as a pilot in Italy.

Hinkler was an &quot;exceptional mathematician and inventor&quot; and &quot;made a lot of aviation instruments which were in use up until the Second World War.&quot; For example, &quot;one was a gadget to correct drift as airplanes fly a little bit on their side, not straight ahead.&quot; Furthermore, &quot;in WWI, Hinkler invented a machine gun adaptor for air gunners. Back then, when the biplanes were flying upside down in combat, the hot, ejected shells would fall and burn the chest of the gunners as they fired. Hinkler&#x27;s invention had the ejected shells all flying off to one side instead.&quot;

==Later life and career==

After the war, he worked as a test pilot for the aircraft manufacturer A.V. Roe in Southampton. The Australian Government offered £10,000 as a prize for the first flight to Australia; Hinkler entered, but his aeroplane crashed in Europe during a storm.

In 1921, Hinkler shipped a tiny Avro Baby to Sydney, Australia. It was filled with fuel and flown non-stop to Bundaberg, Queensland, a distance of .

During the 1920s, he competed in numerous aviation events and set many records, among which was a non-stop flight from England to Latvia. For his England-Latvia flight he was awarded the Oswald Watt Gold Medal for 1927. He was a pilot of the British Schneider Trophy seaplane competitor.

Hinkler flew the first solo flight between England and Australia, departing England on 7 February 1928 and arriving in Darwin on 22 February; and back in his home town of Bundaberg a few days later on 27 February. This reduced the England-Australia record from 28 days to just under 15 days. The aircraft used was an Avro Avian with the registration &quot;G-EBOV&quot;. The flight was little noticed before Hinkler reached India but then media interest intensified. One paper nicknamed the flyer &quot;Hustling Hinkler&quot; and he was the subject of the Tin Pan Alley song &quot;Hustling Hinkler Up in the Sky.&quot;

For the flights in 1920 and 1928 Hinkler had already won two Britannia trophies and the gold medal of the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale. He was also awarded the 1928 Oswald Watt Gold Medal.

Hinkler is quoted as telling the Australian Prime Minister Stanley Bruce at this time: &quot;You know, one day, people will fly by night and use the daylight for sightseeing.&quot; (In 1998 Australian Lang Kidby recreated this flight in a similar 1927 Avro Avian.) He was invited by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Littleton Groom, to be seated on the floor of the House in recognition of his achievement. (The next time such an invitation was extended was in 1973, to Patrick White, who declined.) After visiting the principal cities of Australia and returning to England, he was awarded the Air Force Cross for the finest aerial exploit of the year.

In 1931 came his most remarkable feat. Hinkler flew in a de Havilland Puss Moth from Canada to New York then non-stop to Jamaica , then to Venezuela, Guyana, Brazil, and then across the South Atlantic to Africa; this part of the journey was done in extremely bad weather, but despite a tearing gale and practically no visibility for part of the way because of low and heavy clouds, he drifted a comparatively small distance off his course. From West Africa he flew to London. For this he was awarded the Royal Aero Club Gold Medal, the Segrave Trophy, the Johnston Memorial Prize, and the Britannia Trophy for the most meritorious flying performance of the year. He was also awarded his third and fourth Oswald Watt Gold Medals. This was the first solo flight across the South Atlantic and Hinkler was only the second person to cross the Atlantic solo, after Charles Lindbergh in 1927.
Hinkler married in 1932.

On 7 January 1933, Hinkler left London Air Park, Hanworth, England, in the Puss Moth in an attempt to break the flying record to Australia held by C. W. A. Scott of 8 days 20 hours. Nothing more was heard of him until his body was discovered in the Tuscan Mountains (Apuan Alps) in Italy on 27 April 1933. Charcoal burners initially discovered his wrecked aircraft and informed the authorities; a further search found Hinkler&#x27;s body about away, lying on a steep slope partially hidden by a bush. The body was badly damaged but his identity was confirmed when his passport was found. It was determined his aeroplane had crashed into the mountains the same day he departed from London. He was buried – with full military honours on the orders of Italy&#x27;s ruling dictator Benito Mussolini – in the Cimitero degli Allori in Florence. A monument in his memory was erected at Prato Alle Vacche in the Pratomagno mountain by the Aretino Aero Club. He was survived by both his legal wife Katherine and his de facto wife Nance.

He is remembered as being thoroughly courageous without being reckless, and was successful in his amazing feats because he was practically faultless as a pilot, and knew exactly what he and his machines could do.

==Honours==
*The Federal electorate of Hinkler, in Queensland, is named after him.
*In 1978 he was honoured on a postage stamp depicting his portrait issued by Australia Post.
*Thornhill, Southampton, Hampshire, England has three places in honour of Bert Hinkler: Hinkler Road, Hinkler Pub, and Hinkler Park, which contains a monument to him erected by the residents of Thornhill. In 1983, &quot;Mon Repos&quot;, the house in Thornhill that Bert Hinkler and his de facto wife Hannah (Nance) Jarvis built, was saved from demolition and relocated to the Bundaberg Botanic Gardens, serving as a historical museum On 8 December 2008, the A$7.5 million Hinkler Hall of Aviation was opened to the public in Hinkler&#x27;s home town of Bundaberg. Adjacent to his English home &quot;Mon Repos&quot;, the hall continues the role the house played as a historic museum dedicated to the memory of Hinkler; this has allowed the house to be refurbished to a more domestic state and now serves as a joint attraction with the Hall of Aviation.

*Qantas has named an Airbus A380 after the aviator, with his name featured on the aircraft.
*Hinkler Park in Bundaberg, Queensland, now hockey fields, marks the original location of Hinkler&#x27;s landing in 1928 after his historic 1928 solo flight. 
*The Royal Automobile Club of Queensland erected a monument atop the Sloping Hummock, an extinct volcano and one of the Bundaberg region&#x27;s highest points. 
*A bust of Hinkler, by sculptor George Virine, sits at the southern end of the Burnett Traffic Bridge.
*Hinkler Crescent, once a taxiway for the original Darwin Aerodrome, Fannie Bay, Darwin, NT, Australia is named after Bert Hinkler and has a commemorative plaque in the pavement.

*Bert Hinkler was also awarded the Oswald Watt Medal four times in 1927, 1928, 1931 and 1932.
* Nakara Primary School in Nakara, Northern Territory has a school house-team called &#x27;Hinkler&#x27;.

== Legacy ==
A small piece of wood, a relic from one Hinkler&#x27;s hand-made gliders, was presented to the US astronaut Don Lind in early 1986 as a token of appreciation for his coming to Bundaberg to contribute to the Hinkler Memorial Lectures. Lind in turn gave it to Dick Scobee, the captain of the ill-fated final Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; mission. Scobee took the wood with him on board the &quot;Challenger&quot;, inside a small plastic bag that he placed in his locker. After the explosion, the bag and the wood were recovered from the sea, identified, mounted, and later returned to the Hinkler Memorial Museum.

State Library of Queensland holds a significant collection of letters, correspondence and items linked to Hinkler. The letters written by Hinkler to his family, (1913–1929), reveal deeply personal accounts of his adventures abroad and perspective of his achievements. Digitisations of the letters and a 1928 recording of Bert Hinkler&#x27;s speech are available online.

<text>alt.tv.simpsons (called &quot;a.t.s.&quot; by regular readers) is a usenet newsgroup dedicated to discussing the American television program &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Created in 1990, the newsgroup became a popular community in the early 1990s. It still exists today, even when Google Groups shut down the Usenet service in 2024. It can be accessed on various news servers with a news reader and web archives like Novabbs. It is known for reviewing episodes and nitpicking minor details on the show.

The writers of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; knew about the forum and have on several occasions read the comments made on it. The character Comic Book Guy is often used in the show to lampoon and respond to the newsgroup&#x27;s fans. In interviews some writers have admitted that they do not like being scrutinized, but other writers participated in the discussions on the forum. Independent commentators called the forum an example of an &quot;active audience&quot; and have claimed &quot;The Simpsons&quot; is tailor-made for such a forum.

==History==
The newsgroup was created by Gary D. Duzan during the third week of March 1990, four months after the first airing of a regular episode of the program, which was the episode &quot;Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire&quot; – a Christmas special that aired on December 17, 1989. At the time Duzan was in his third year, studying computer science, at the University of Delaware.

The newsgroup was created before there was a World Wide Web, which emerged in 1993, so those earliest discussions were held on text-only platforms. According to Chris Turner, a Canadian journalist and writer of the book &quot;Planet Simpson&quot;, the newsgroup was among the most trafficked newsgroups of the early 1990s. In that period it became a popular community on the Internet. According to Brian Reid, a computer scientist who has been tracking newsgroup traffic since 1985, alt.tv.simpsons was the most popular television newsgroup in May 1994, ahead of a discussion newsgroups about general television newsgroup (rec.arts.tv), Monty Python (alt.fan.monty-python), the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; (alt.fan.letterman) and soap operas (rec.arts.tv.soaps). Since there is no official method for measuring newsgroup traffic, the list is considered unofficial.

==Discussions==
From its inception, users used the newsgroup to discuss the quality of the episode, as well as to talk about continuity errors and trivia. They also discussed cultural references, usually related to pop culture. Another common topic was freeze frame gags, which are jokes that can only be seen when the viewer tapes the episode and freezes the image. All of these many discussions were compiled and submitted to The Simpsons Archive, which contains at least 330 episode guides as well as other guides. The newsgroup also provided The Simpsons Archive with information on the characters and the setting, as well as a compilation of articles about the show and interview with its cast and crew.

Among the most frequent topics of discussion were the real-life location of Springfield, the sexuality of Waylon Smithers, and &quot;Who Shot Mr. Burns?&quot;, a two-episode publicity stunt in which Mr. Burns was shot by an unknown character. The writers inserted many secret clues into the episode and implemented a contest in which whoever first discovered the shooter would be animated on an episode of the show. Although the alt.tv.simpsons community debated this mystery to an extreme degree, no one officially guessed the right answer, and therefore no one was ever animated on the show. Due to contest regulations, a winner had to be selected out of a random sample of entries. The sample did not contain any correct answers, so the winner who was chosen did not have the right answer and was paid a cash prize in lieu of being animated.

==Relationship with the writers==

The writers of the show were aware of the newsgroup and sometimes make jokes at its expense. Within the series, the character Comic Book Guy is often used to represent a stereotypical inhabitant of alt.tv.simpsons.
The first such instance occurred in the seventh-season episode &quot;Radioactive Man,&quot; in which Comic Book Guy is logging on to his favorite newsgroup alt.nerd.obsessive. Comic Book Guy&#x27;s oft-repeated catchphrase, &quot;Worst episode ever,&quot; first appeared on alt.tv.simpsons in an episode review and David S. Cohen decided to use this fan response to lampoon the passion and the fickleness of the fans.

The eighth season episode &quot;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show&quot; is largely seen as a satire of the &quot;hardcore fans&quot; that make up the newsgroup, as well as a response to the viewer backlash and obsession with internal consistency those fans commonly expressed. When Comic Book Guy sees the Poochie episode, he immediately goes on the Internet and writes, “Worst episode ever” on a message board; a commentary on how the active audience nitpicks the episode. The writers respond by using the voice of Bart Simpson:

The catchphrase further appears in the eleventh season episode &quot;Saddlesore Galactica,&quot; and as the title of the twelfth season episode &quot;Worst Episode Ever.&quot; The catchphrase can also be used for describing other things by saying, &quot;Worst. (Noun). Ever.&quot;

The writers also used the newsgroup to test how observant the fans are. In the seventh-season episode &quot;Treehouse of Horror VI&quot;, the writer of segment Homer3, David S. Cohen, deliberately inserted a false equation into the background of one scene. The equation that appears is &quot;178212 + 184112 = 192212&quot;. Although a false statement, it appears to be true when evaluated on a typical calculator with 10 digits of precision. If it were true, it would disprove Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, which had just been proven when this episode first aired. Cohen generated this &quot;Fermat near-miss&quot; with a computer program. After the episode aired, Cohen lurked on the newsgroup to see the response; at first there was astonishment when users tested it, but later there was despair when they found out it was only accurate to eight decimal places when expressed in scientific notation.

==Reception==
The comments of alt.tv.simpsons have been quoted or cited in the writings of mass media commentators. This has led to situations in which relations between writers and viewers have become strained. In 1994, &quot;Simpsons&quot; creator Matt Groening acknowledged he and the other show runners have been reading the newsgroup and in frustration said, &quot;Sometimes I feel like knocking their electronic noggins together&quot;. In another case, writer Ian Maxtone-Graham made comments about the fans on the Internet in an interview with &quot;The Independent&quot;, calling them &quot;beetle-browed&quot; and saying, &quot;That&#x27;s why they&#x27;re on the Internet and we&#x27;re writing the show.&quot; Writer Bill Oakley used to respond to select &quot;Simpsons&quot; fans through e-mail in a friendly manner, but by 1996 claimed &quot;[t]here are people who take it seriously to the point of absurdity&quot;. In a 1994 &quot;Life in Hell&quot; cartoon, Matt Groening implied that he read the newsgroup.

In the chapter &quot;Who Wants Candy&quot; in the 2004 book &quot;Leaving Springfield&quot;, Robert Sloane finds alt.tv.simpsons an example of an &quot;active audience ... who struggle to make their own meaning out of the show&quot;. He mentions that in this context, the fans nitpick the show to an extreme and allow no room for error, where the writers believe that nitpicking leads to an under appreciation of the show&#x27;s qualities. Chris Turner writes in the 2004 book &quot;Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Documented an Era and Defined a Generation&quot; that &quot;The Simpsons&quot; appeared tailor-made for a newsgroup in the early 1990s because it includes minor details that reward attentive viewing and can be easily scrutinized.

<doc id="673356" wikidata="Q3977695" url="?curid=673356" title="Supercharge">
<text>In theoretical physics, a supercharge is a generator of supersymmetry transformations. It is an example of the general notion of a charge in physics.

Supercharge, denoted by the symbol Q, is an operator which transforms bosons into fermions, and vice versa. Since the supercharge operator changes a particle with spin one-half to a particle with spin one or zero, the supercharge itself is a spinor that carries one half unit of spin.

Depending on the context, supercharges may also be called &quot;Grassmann variables&quot; or &quot;Grassmann directions&quot;; they are generators of the exterior algebra of anti-commuting numbers, the Grassmann numbers. All these various usages are essentially synonymous; they refer to the formula_1 grading between bosons and fermions, or equivalently, the grading between &quot;c-numbers&quot; and &quot;a-numbers&quot;. Calling it a charge emphasizes the notion of a symmetry at work.

==Commutation==
Supercharge is described by the super-Poincaré algebra.

Supercharge commutes with the Hamiltonian operator:

:[ Q , H ] = 0

So does its adjoint.

<text>Colleen Rose Dewhurst (June 3, 1924 – August 22, 1991) was a Canadian-American actress mostly known for theatre roles. She was a renowned interpreter of the works of Eugene O&#x27;Neill on the stage, and her career also encompassed film, early dramas on live television, and performances in Joseph Papp&#x27;s New York Shakespeare Festival. One of her last roles was playing Marilla Cuthbert in the Kevin Sullivan television adaptations of the &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; series and her reprisal of the role in the subsequent TV series &quot;Road to Avonlea&quot;. In the United States, Dewhurst won two Tony Awards and four Primetime Emmy Awards for her stage and television work. In addition to other Canadian honors over the years, Dewhurst won two Gemini Awards (the former Canadian equivalent of an Emmy Award) for her portrayal of Marilla Cuthbert; once in 1986 and again in 1988. It is arguably her best known role because of the Sullivan-produced series&#x27; continuing popularity and also the initial co-production by the CBC; allowing for rebroadcasts over the years on it, and also on PBS in the United States. The initial broadcast alone was seen by millions of viewers.

==Early life==
Dewhurst was born June 3, 1924, in Montreal, Quebec, the only child of Frances Marie (nee Woods) and Ferdinand Augustus &quot;Fred&quot; Dewhurst. Fred Dewhurst was the owner of a chain of confectionery stores and had been a celebrated athlete in Canada, where he had played football with the Ottawa Rough Riders. The family became naturalized as U.S. citizens before 1940. Colleen Dewhurst&#x27;s mother was a Christian Scientist, a faith Colleen also embraced.

The Dewhursts moved to Massachusetts in 1928 or 1929, staying in the Boston area neighborhoods of Dorchester, Auburndale, and West Newton. Later they moved to New York City and then to Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin. Dewhurst attended Whitefish Bay High School for her first two years of high school, moved to Shorewood High School for her junior year, and graduated from Riverside High School in Milwaukee in 1942. About this time her parents separated. Dewhurst attended Milwaukee-Downer College for two years, then moved to New York City to pursue an acting career.

==Career==
One of her more significant stage roles was in the 1974 Broadway revival of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;A Moon for the Misbegotten&quot; as Josie Hogan, for which she won a Tony Award. She previously won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in 1961 for &quot;All the Way Home&quot;. She later played Katharina in a 1956 production of &quot;Taming of the Shrew&quot; for Joseph Papp. She (as recounted in her posthumous obituary in collaboration with Tom Viola) wrote:
With Brooks Atkinson&#x27;s blessing, our world changed overnight. Suddenly in our audience of neighbors in T-shirts and jeans appeared men in white shirts, jackets and ties and ladies in summer dresses. We were in a hit that would have a positive effect on my career, as well as Joe&#x27;s, but I missed the shouting.

She played Shakespeare&#x27;s Cleopatra and Lady Macbeth for Papp and years later, Gertrude in a production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; at the Delacorte Theatre in Central Park.

She appeared in the &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; episode &quot;Night Fever&quot; in 1965 and with Ingrid Bergman in &quot;More Stately Mansions&quot; on Broadway in 1967. José Quintero directed her in O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot; and &quot;Mourning Becomes Electra&quot;. She appeared in Edward Albee&#x27;s adaptation of Carson McCullers&#x27; &quot;Ballad of the Sad Cafe&quot; and as Martha in a Broadway revival of &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot;, with Ben Gazzara which Albee directed.

She appeared in 1962 as Joanne Novak in the episode &quot;I Don&#x27;t Belong in a White-Painted House&quot; in the medical drama &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;, starring Wendell Corey and Jack Ging. Dewhurst appeared opposite her then husband, Scott, in a 1971 television adaptation of Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Price&quot;, on &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot;, and an anthology series. There is another television recording of them together when she played Elizabeth Proctor to the unfaithful John in Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Crucible&quot; (with Tuesday Weld). In 1977, Woody Allen cast her in his film &quot;Annie Hall&quot; as Annie&#x27;s mother.

In her autobiography, Dewhurst wrote: &quot;I had moved so quickly from one Off-Broadway production to the next that I was known, at one point, as the &#x27;Queen of Off-Broadway&#x27;. This title was not due to my brilliance, but, rather, because most of the plays I was in closed after a run of anywhere from one night to two weeks. I would then move immediately into another.&quot;

In 1972 she played a madam, Mrs. Kate Collingwood, in &quot;The Cowboys&quot; (1972), which starred John Wayne. Dewhurst also appeared with Wayne in the 1974 film &quot;McQ&quot;. She was the first actress to share a love scene with Wayne in bed. In 1985, she played the role of Marilla Cuthbert in Kevin Sullivan&#x27;s adaptation of Lucy Maud Montgomery&#x27;s novel &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; and reprised the role in 1987&#x27;s &quot;Anne of Avonlea&quot; (also known as &quot;Anne of Green Gables: The Sequel&quot;) and in several episodes of Kevin Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Road to Avonlea&quot;.

Dewhurst was on hiatus from &quot;Road to Avonlea&quot; when she died in 1991. Sullivan Productions was unaware she was terminally ill, so her portrayal of Marilla ended posthumously. This was accomplished by shooting new scenes with actress Patricia Hamilton acting as a body double for Dewhurst and by recycling parts of scenes from &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;, &quot;Road to Avonlea&quot;, and using Dewhurst&#x27;s death scene as Hepzibah in Sullivan&#x27;s production of &quot;Lantern Hill&quot;. The latter was a 1990 television film based on L.M. Montgomery&#x27;s &quot;Jane of Lantern Hill&quot;.

During 1989 and 1990, she appeared in a supporting role on the television series &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; playing Avery Brown, the feisty mother of Candice Bergen&#x27;s title character; this role earned her two Emmy Awards, the second being awarded posthumously. Dewhurst won a total of two Tony Awards and four Emmy Awards for her stage and television work. Season 4, Episode 6 entitled &quot;Full Circle&quot; was the Murphy Brown episode filmed shortly after her death and dedicated to her memory.

In a review of Dewhurst&#x27;s final film role as Ruth in &quot;Bed and Breakfast&quot; (1991), Emanuel Levy wrote “&quot;Bed and Breakfast&quot; is the kind of small, intimate picture that actors revere. The stunningly sensual Dewhurst, in one of her last screen roles, dominates every scene she is in, making the lusty and down-to-earth Ruth at once credible and enchanting.“

Dewhurst was president of the Actors&#x27; Equity Association from 1985 until her death. She was the first national president to die in the office.

==Personal life and final years==
Colleen Dewhurst was married to James Vickery from 1947 to 1960. She married and divorced George C. Scott twice. They had two sons, Alexander Scott and actor Campbell Scott; she co-starred with Campbell in &quot;Dying Young&quot; (1991), one of her last film roles as she died in August 1991.

During the last years of her life she lived on a farm in South Salem, New York, with her partner Ken Marsolais. They also had a summer home on Prince Edward Island, Canada.

Maureen Stapleton wrote about Dewhurst:
Colleen looked like a warrior, so people assumed she was the earth mother. But in real life Colleen was not to be let out without a keeper. She couldn&#x27;t stop herself from taking care of people, which she then did with more care than she took care of herself. Her generosity of spirit was overwhelming and her smile so dazzling that you couldn&#x27;t pull the ... reins in on her even if you desperately wanted to and knew damn well that somebody should.

Dewhurst&#x27;s Christian Science beliefs led to her refusal to accept any kind of surgical treatment. She died of cervical cancer at the age 67 at her South Salem home in 1991. She was cremated and her ashes were given to family and friends; no public service was planned.

<doc id="673373" wikidata="Q385812" url="?curid=673373" title="Prisoner of Ice">
<text>Prisoner of Ice (also Call of Cthulhu: Prisoner of Ice) is an adventure game developed and released by Infogrames Multimedia for IBM PC compatibles and Macintosh in 1995 in America and Europe. It is based on H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s Cthulhu Mythos, particularly &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot;, and is a follow-up to Infogrames&#x27; earlier &quot;Shadow of the Comet&quot;. In 1997, the game was ported to the Sega Saturn and PlayStation exclusively in Japan.

==Plot==
&quot;Prisoner of Ice&quot; begins during the run-up to World War II, primarily around Antarctica. The main character is a young U.S. intelligence officer, Lt. Ryan, who has been assigned to a British submarine, HMS &quot;Victoria&quot;, for a special mission. As the game begins, the submarine is fleeing the Antarctic after rescuing a Norwegian who has recently escaped from a secret German base in the Antarctic (it is later revealed that the base is built atop the Ancient Ruins mentioned in &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot;). Along with the Norwegian, the sub has picked up two mysterious cargo crates stolen from the Nazis.

Late in the game, in Argentina, Ryan meets John Parker, the central character from &quot;Shadow of the Comet&quot;, and reveals the links between the two games. Narackamous, the main antagonist of &quot;Shadow of the Comet&quot;, also returns. 

The game has a choice of two endings, though there is little difference between them.

==Gameplay==
The game involves solving puzzles through a point and click user interface. The player can examine any item and, depending on the item, either pick it up, use another item on it, or operate it in some way.

Some puzzles, if not completed within a short span of time (always less than a minute), will result in a game over. To ensure that the player does not get stuck by saving their game at a point from which they cannot possibly complete a puzzle in time, the game autosaves onto a separate save file at the beginning of each timed puzzle.

==Release==
The game was released for MS-DOS compatible operating systems, Microsoft Windows, and Macintosh. It was published in the US in 1995 by I Motion and in Europe in 1995. In PAL territories it was titled &quot;Call of Cthulhu: Prisoner of Ice&quot;.

Three French-language comic books were published as tie-ins to the game: &quot;La Geôle de Pandore&quot; (&quot;Pandora&#x27;s Jail&quot;), &quot;Le Glaive du Crépuscule&quot; (The Dagger in the Dusk) and &quot;La Cité des Abîmes&quot; (&quot;The City of the Depths&quot;).

In Japan, the game was released in 1997 by Xing Entertainment as &quot;Prisoner of Ice: Jashin Kourin&quot;, and ported to the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation game consoles. These ports contain no enhancements from the PC versions. The English voice acting of the PC version is retained, but the text which appears when examining or picking up objects is translated to Japanese. The Saturn version is compatible with the Netlink Mouse.

In 2015, &quot;Prisoner of Ice&quot; and &quot;Shadow of the Comet&quot; were re-released as DRM-free on GOG.com for modern computers.

==Reception==
According to the French newspaper &quot;Les Échos&quot;, &quot;Prisoner of Ice&quot; was commercially successful. Its sales surpassed 30,000 units in the United States alone during its first day of release.

A reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot; gave the PC version three out of five stars, praising the gripping storyline, beautiful animation, and eerie atmosphere, but criticized the &quot;emotionless&quot; voice acting. He concluded, &quot;It&#x27;s worth checking out for the great storyline and art, but not good for much else.&quot;

<text>Shadow of the Comet (later repackaged as Call of Cthulhu: Shadow of the Comet) is an adventure game developed and released by Infogrames in 1993. The game is based on H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s Cthulhu Mythos and uses many elements from Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot; and &quot;The Shadow Over Innsmouth&quot;. A follow-up game, &quot;Prisoner of Ice&quot;, was released in 1995 and does not directly follow the events of this game.

&quot;Shadow of the Comet: The Official Strategy Guide&quot; (Prima Publishing, 1994; re-released by the author, 2019) was written by Steve Schwartz. In addition to a game walkthrough, all game dialog, and a disk of saved games, the book includes the Lovecraft story &quot;The Call of Cthulhu&quot;.

==Gameplay==
The player can control the protagonist Parker via the arrow keys. When Parker comes across something he can interact with, a button press will allow the player to do so. Items that Parker can take will project a white line from Parker&#x27;s eye to the item, indicating that when the player interacts with the item, it will be added to Parker&#x27;s inventory. Apart from this the game plays like a standard third-person adventure game.

==Plot==
The game takes place in 1910 and concerns the visit of a young British photographer, John Parker, to the isolated New England town of Illsmouth (an alteration on Lovecraft&#x27;s Innsmouth) to witness and photograph the passage of Halley&#x27;s Comet. In 1834, on the last passing, Lord Boleskine visited the town after learning that certain conditions near the town would allow astronomical objects to be seen clearer and closer than on any other spot on earth. He decided to test this theory by observing the comet from Illsmouth, but something unexpected happened and he went insane, spending the rest of his life in a lunatic asylum. Parker, learning of the 1834 incident and reading over Boleskine&#x27;s papers, wishes to succeed where his predecessor failed. When he arrives, Parker stumbles upon a sinister conspiracy and must survive the three days between his arrival and the comet&#x27;s passage while finding out what happened in 1834.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; praised &quot;Shadow of the Comet&quot;″s plot, puzzles, writing, and &quot;rather naughty, dark Gallic sense of humor&quot; but criticized the lack of mouse support, calling object manipulation and puzzle solving without one &quot;painful&quot;. The magazine concluded that the game &quot;is a high quality graphic adventure that offers nothing particularly new as far as technological advances and is, in some ways, a touch old-fashioned. This may, however, not be a bad thing&quot; given the plot&#x27;s quality.

James V. Trunzo reviewed &quot;Call of Cthulhu: Shadow of the Comet&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #48 (Oct., 1994), rating it a 5 out of 5 and stated that &quot;&quot;Shadow of the Comet&quot; captures the essence of Lovecraft&#x27;s horror stories. It builds suspense and tension without resorting to gore or shock. Rich dialogue, &#x27;real&#x27; situations and a tantalizing puzzle should keep you glued to the monitor.&quot;

In 2011, Adventure Gamers named &quot;Shadow of the Comet&quot; the 74th-best adventure game ever released.

<doc id="673387" wikidata="Q5387840" url="?curid=673387" title="Eric the Unready">
<text>Eric the Unready is an adventure game developed and published by Legend Entertainment for MS-DOS in 1993. &quot;Eric the Unready&quot; is a parody of the fantasy genre in general, though it parodies numerous other topics as well, ranging from &quot;Star Trek&quot; to &quot;Zork&quot;. It tells a comedic story of the titular unqualified knight on a quest to rescue a princess. The game also adapts the character Morgan le Fay from Arthurian legend. The game was well received.

==Gameplay==
The game engine of &quot;Eric the Unready&quot; uses an interactive fiction style interface. A graphical display of the player&#x27;s location and viewpoint is provided in a window. Other windows can feature a point-and-click interface, including a listing of the player&#x27;s inventory and a command list with multiple-choices menus.

==Plot==
According to a prophecy, King Fudd the Bewildered is expected to die next week, and the unmarried princess at his side shall inherit the Kingdom. His legitimate daughter, Princess Lorealle the Worthy, comes to the castle to be on his side but disappears mysteriously the next day. Early in the game, the player learns of the scheme by Fudd&#x27;s wife and Lorealle&#x27;s stepmother, the wicked Queen Morgana the Black, who plots with her lover Sir Pectoral to have her daughter by a previous marriage to be on the dying King&#x27;s side and therefore become the sole heir. Lorealle has been abducted and held in the castle of Morgana&#x27;s witch sister with the intent to marry the evil Beast in order to be excluded from the prophecy. In order to make certain that Lorealle will be not rescued in time by any knight, Morgana conspires so that the Union Hall picks the most incompetent and unworthy of them, Eric the Unready – the player character.

Bud the Wizard (a pun on Budweiser) informs the player that in order to access the castle, he must find several magical items: the Pitchfork of Damocles, in the leaves of the tallest tree in the Enchanted Forest; the Crescent Wrench of Armageddon, within the walls of Blicester Castle; the Raw Steak of Eternity, guarded by the Stygian Dragon; the Crowbar of the Apocalypse in the mists around the Mountain of the Gods; and the Bolt Cutters of Doom owned by an enchanter in the Swamp of Perdition. Each mission is somehow timed: the evil Sir Pectoral is after him; if the player takes too long to reach the object, the game will end. With each acquisition, Eric creates some disaster, usually an explosion, which hurls him to the next area the following day. The player can collect a newspaper from each area/day which describes Eric&#x27;s latest mishaps and other fictional &quot;news&quot; of the game world, usually puns on pop culture. Eric&#x27;s final destination is the witch&#x27;s castle, where he uses the magical objects to open its gate. He then prevents the Princess&#x27; wedding and destroys the Beast along with a castle full of monsters. After that, the King orders Morgana and her daughter to be exiled along with Sir Pectoral, and Sir Eric and Princess Lorealle are about to marry.

==Reception==
&quot;Eric the Unready&quot; received positive reviews, including being rated 4 out of 5 stars from &quot;Dragon&quot;, and scoring 78% and 75% from German magazines &quot;PC Games&quot; and &quot;PC Players&quot;, respectively. &quot;Compute!&quot; review stated: &quot;Perfectly realized from concept to execution, &quot;Eric the Unready&quot; is a rare treat that&#x27;s not to be missed.&quot; The game received or was nominated to several awards and accolades, including &quot;Computer Game Review&quot; Golden Triad Award, &quot;Game Bytes&quot; Editor&#x27;s Choice Award, Computer Choice Awards (finalist), and &quot;Strategy Plus&quot; Adventure Game of the Year (Nominee). &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; magazine in 1993 named it Adventure Game of the Year (with &quot;Star Control II&quot;), in 1994 called it &quot;a comic masterpiece&quot;, and featured it in their 1996 list of the &quot;150 Best Games of All Time&quot; in 103rd place, also ranking it as #9 Funniest Computer Game, #11 Most Memorable Game Hero, and #7 Most Rewarding Ending.

Jim Trunzo reviewed &quot;Eric the Unready&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #36 (1993), rating it a 3 out of 5 and stated that &quot;If you&#x27;re ready to face the dreaded Ninja Attack Turtles, prepared to thwart the diabolical plans of the evil Queen Morgana and her lover Sir Pectoral, and ready to help the farmer get his beloved daughter, who has been turned into a pig, out of the much in the bottom of the outhouse, you&#x27;re ready to become &quot;Eric the Unready&quot;!&quot;

<doc id="673391" wikidata="Q4036465" url="?curid=673391" title="Companions of Xanth">
<text>Companions of Xanth is an adventure game published in 1993 by Legend Entertainment.

==Gameplay==
The game is based on Piers Anthony&#x27;s &quot;Xanth&quot; novels and loosely follows the plot of his 1993 novel &quot;Demons Don&#x27;t Dream&quot;, in which a young man uses a computer game to enter and explore the world of Xanth.

Typical of Piers Anthony&#x27;s novels, the game is filled with puns and visual gags, and some knowledge of the &quot;Xanth&quot; universe is helpful; for those players who haven&#x27;t read any of the Xanth novels, an in-game &#x27;Com-Pendium of Xanth&#x27; is provided to the player for the majority of the game. The game uses 2D graphics in 8-bit colour and was available on both floppy disk and CD-ROM.

The game was re-released in July 1997 in a bundle with Legend Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;Death Gate&quot; and &quot;Shannara&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; stated in February 1994 that &quot;Companions of Xanth&quot; was &quot;a very funny game based on an interesting literary license&quot;, with &quot;traditional adventure game puzzles&quot;. The magazine&#x27;s Scorpia was less positive in March 1994, criticizing the forced choice of Nada Naga as a Companion, puzzle quality (&quot;uneven at best, and in some cases, downright poor&quot;), and short playing time. She concluded that &quot;Companions of Xanth&quot; was &quot;the weakest Legend game to date&quot;. In August 1994 the magazine said that &quot;Xanth&quot; &quot;was somewhat weak as a game, but full of Piers Anthony-style humor&quot;. The game was reviewed in 1994 in &quot;Dragon&quot; #204 by Sandy Petersen in the &quot;Eye of the Monitor&quot; column. Petersen gave the game 3 out of 5 stars.

<doc id="673396" wikidata="Q1464572" url="?curid=673396" title="HeroQuest">
<text>HeroQuest, is an adventure board game created by Milton Bradley in conjunction with the British company Games Workshop in 1989, and re-released in 2021. The game is loosely based around archetypes of fantasy role-playing games: the game itself was actually a game &quot;system&quot;, allowing the gamemaster (called &quot;Morcar&quot; and &quot;Zargon&quot; in the United Kingdom and North America respectively) to create dungeons of their own design using the provided game board, tiles, furnishings and figures. The game manual describes Morcar/Zargon as a former apprentice of Mentor, and the parchment text is read aloud from Mentor&#x27;s perspective. Several expansions have been released, each adding new tiles, traps, artifacts, and monsters to the core system.

==History==
In the late 1980s, game designer Stephen Baker moved from Games Workshop (GW) to Milton Bradley and convinced Roger Ford, Milton Bradley&#x27;s head of development to allow him to develop a fantasy genre game. Kennedy gave him the go-ahead if he kept the game simple. Baker contacted his former employer, Games Workshop, to develop the plastic miniatures that would be needed in the game, but he then decided to draw on their expertise in the fantasy game field to help develop the game. The result was the fantasy adventure board game &quot;HeroQuest&quot; (1989), in which the players work together against the gamemaster. The game was released in Britain, Europe and Australia in 1989, and the North American edition, with a different subtitle - Game system, in 1990.

The game consists of a board and a number of individual miniatures and items. The protagonists are four heroes (&quot;Barbarian&quot;, &quot;Dwarf&quot;, &quot;Elf&quot; and &quot;Wizard&quot;) who face a selection of monsters: Orcs, Goblins, Fimir, Chaos Warriors, a Chaos Warlock (which represents many of the named characters for the various quests, such as Sir Ragnar and the Witch Lord), a Gargoyle and a number of Undead: skeletons, zombies and mummies.

In a 1989 interview, designer Stephen Baker agreed that the game was too easy if the players all cooperated, but explained that &quot;The game is really aimed at 10–12 year olds who play with their mums and dads. My feeling is that they play in a very competitive, rather than co-operative way.&quot;
The publication of expansion sets was then split between the European and Australasian markets and the North American markets. Starting with &quot;Kellar&#x27;s Keep&quot;, released in Europe and Australasia in 1989, and North America in 1991. &quot;Kellar&#x27;s Keep&quot; added new quests, items, artefacts and a further batch of monster figures (more Orcs, Goblins and Fimir). Released shortly after in the same years was &quot;Return of the Witch Lord&quot; which extended the undead with more skeletons, mummies and zombies.

&quot;Advanced HeroQuest&quot; was a revised and expanded version of the &quot;HeroQuest&quot; game released in 1989 by Games Workshop. The basic concept is the same: four heroes venture into a dungeon to fight monsters and gain treasure, but the rules are more detailed and complex.

&quot;Against the Ogre Horde&quot; was released in 1990 in Europe and Australasia, included Ogres, a more powerful monster type, while &quot;Wizards of Morcar&quot; was released in 1991, themed around the addition of enemy wizards.

A &quot;HeroQuest Adventure Design Kit&quot; was released in Europe in 1990, containing items to help players design their own quests, and an &quot;Adventure Design Booklet&quot; was published with four sheets of adhesive labels and with an 80-page pad of a new design, larger character sheet. There was also a blank quest map printed in the middle of the original game&#x27;s quest booklet for creative players to make their own adventures.

1991 saw the first computer adaption released. The &quot;HeroQuest&quot; computer game, forcing Sierra On-Line to rename their &quot;Hero&#x27;s Quest&quot; series to &quot;Quest for Glory&quot;. A version of the game for the NES was developed to a prototype stage, simply named &quot;HeroQuest&quot;, but was never released. A sequel for the Amiga titled &quot;HeroQuest II: Legacy of Sorasil&quot; was released in 1994.

1992 saw the release of &quot;HeroQuest&quot; Advanced Quest Edition (also known by the German version name &quot;HeroQuest Master Edition&quot;) was released later with 12 added miniatures (&quot;black guards&quot;) with 4 kinds of detachable weapons and a new 13 part adventure &quot;The Dark Company&quot; in addition to the original contents of the basic &quot;HeroQuest&quot; box.

1992 also saw North America release of two sets of their own: &quot;The Frozen Horror&quot;, with a snow and ice theme, featured a Female Barbarian, Mercenaries, Ice Gremlins, Polar Warbears and a pair of yeti as well as the &quot;Frozen horror&quot; of the title, while &quot;The Mage of the Mirror&quot; had an Elven theme: Female Elf against an evil Elven Archmage, Elf warriors and archers, Giant Wolves and Ogres.

Three &quot;HeroQuest&quot; novels by Dave Morris were published: &quot;The Fellowship of Four&quot; in 1991,
&quot;The Screaming Spectre&quot; in 1992,
and &quot;The Tyrant&#x27;s Tomb&quot; in 1993.
The Fellowship of Four novel included a 135-paragraph gamebook &#x27;The Heroquest Adventure Game - In the Night Season&#x27;. The Screaming Spectre novel included &#x27;Running the Gauntlet - A Solo Quest for the Wizard&#x27; to be played with the HeroQuest Game System and also &#x27;Beyond the World&#x27;s Edge - A Solitaire Adventure for the Wizard&#x27; a 148-paragraph gamebook. The Tyrant&#x27;s Tomb novel also contained &#x27;A Growl of Thunder - A Solitaire Quest for the Barbarian&#x27; to be played with the HeroQuest Game System and &#x27;The Treasure of Chungor Khan - A Solo Adventure for a Barbarian&#x27; a 193-paragraph gamebook.

In 1997, Milton Bradley let their &quot;HeroQuest&quot; trademark lapse. It was subsequently purchased by Issaries, Inc. who used it for an unrelated tabletop role-playing game. This was sold in 2013 to Moon Design Publications who continued to use it for the same purpose, eventually selling it back to Milton Bradley (now Hasbro Gaming) in 2020.

===&quot;HeroQuest&quot; remake===
Under the vision and direction of Jeffrey Anderson, Hasbro Gaming bought the &quot;HeroQuest&quot; trademark from Moon Design Publications in September 2020. This allowed Avalon Hill, a subsidiary of Hasbro, to launch a teaser website with the &quot;HeroQuest&quot; logo, art and a countdown timer, leading to speculation that an official remake or app was being produced. On September 22, 2020, the countdown revealed a Hasbro Pulse crowdfunded campaign for $1,000,000 to produce an updated edition of &quot;HeroQuest&quot; with new figures, &quot;Kellar&#x27;s Keep&quot; and &quot;Return of the Witch Lord&quot; expansions. Funding was achieved within 24 hours, with Hasbro expecting to ship in late 2021. The initial campaign was for US and Canada only, with Hasbro later expanding the campaign to include United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. Games Workshop branding and intellectual property was removed, with all art replaced; the &quot;Chaos&quot; moniker changed to &quot;Dread&quot; in all instances; miniatures all received new sculpts; and the Fimir monsters, a type of water-based lizard monster originating in the Warhammer universe, replaced by the fish-based Abomination monsters.

Hasbro Pulse crowdfunded HeroQuest campaign offered two pledge tiers, &quot;Heroic or Mythic&quot;. Supporters who pledged for the &quot;Heroic Tier&quot; would receive the &quot;HeroQuest Game System&quot; with both expansion packs &quot;Kellar&#x27;s Keep&quot; and &quot;Return of the Witch Lord&quot;.

Included were three quest books: &quot;Prophecy of Telor&quot; by Stephen Baker, &quot;The Spirit Queen&#x27;s Torment&quot; by Teos Abadia, and &quot;The Crypt of Perpetual Darkness&quot; by Joe Manganiello.

Shortly after the crowdfunding campaign, Hasbro made available a PDF of a new quest, &quot;Training Quest Rogar&#x27;s Hall&quot; by Stephen Baker. 

In November 2021, Avalon Hill announced the very first hero expansion pack, the &quot;Hero Collection - Commander of the Guardian Knights&quot;. This included two knight figures as well as three knight skill cards and two equipment cards for each figure. It was a limited edition exclusive to retailers and sold out quickly.

Hasbro also released the free to download &quot;HeroQuest Companion App&quot;, which aids a Zargon player, or fills the role of Zargon allowing the game to be played either cooperatively or solo.


At the end of 2021, &quot;HeroQuest&quot; was released to stores, along with two expansions, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Return of the Witch Lord&quot;.
Hasbro also released online quest one: &quot;Forsaken Tunnels of Xor-Xel&quot; by Doug Hopkin, which connects the core game&#x27;s quests to the &quot;Kellar&#x27;s Keep&quot; expansion.

On April 8th, 2022 Hasbro released online quest zero: &quot;New Beginnings&quot; by Doug Hopkins, which was later re entitled as &quot;HeroQuest: Try out a New Beginning&quot;.
The summer of 2022 Hasbro released online quest two: &quot;Into the Northlands&quot; by Doug Hopkins,
and the &quot;HeroQuest Adventure Design Kit&quot;.

In August 2022, the &quot;Barbarian Quest Pack&quot; expansion was re-released as &quot;The Frozen Horror Quest Pack.&quot;

In December 2022, Avalon Hill released a second hero expansion pack, the &quot;Hero Collection - The Rogue Heir of Elethorn&quot; as a prologue to the Elf Quest Pack. This expansion included two rogue elf figures as well as three rogue skill cards and two equipment cards for each elf.

&quot;The Mage of the Mirror Quest Pack&quot; was released in February 2023 with new elven furniture.

On March 27, 2023, Hasbro announced a new expansion, &quot;Rise of the Dread Moon&quot; that will include a variant sculpt of the Commander of the Guardian Knight, three clear translucent spectres and four Cadre of the Raven&#x27;s Veil figures in purple plastic. A new potions card deck will also be included. 

A scheduled streamline event officially heralded the launch of ‘&quot;HeroQuest - Rise of the Dread Moon’&quot; as the first new &quot;HeroQuest&quot; expansion in 30 years. Building on the events explored in ‘&quot;HeroQuest - Mage of the Mirror’,&quot; collaborative partners showcased an original quest revealed as ‘&quot;Knight Fall&quot;’ and as the catalyst for ‘&quot;Rise of the Dread Moon&quot;’. The release of &quot;‘Knight Fall’&quot; was made free to download upon the conclusion of the stream.
In August of 2023, Avalon Hill released a third hero expansion pack, the &quot;Hero Collection - The Path of the Wandering Monk&quot;. This expansion included two martial artist Monk figures as well as four elemental skill cards.

In October of 2023, Avalon Hill announced a release to retail two &#x27;new&#x27; expansions packs: Prophecy of Telor and The Spirit&#x27;s Queens Torment 

On February 27, 2024, the UK expansion &quot;Against the Ogre Horde&quot; was released. Along with the original 7 quests, this re-released expansion included three new quests, a new game mode (called World’s End Tournament), new druid sculpts and cards, and a new wolf companion sculpt and character card.

On June 14, 2024, a new starter box was announced, &quot;First Light&quot;, with the goal of providing a cheaper option for new players to purchase the HeroQuest game system. It contains a new quest book and a full reveal was promised at the 2024 Gen Con. 

==Characters==

The heroes of the original release, are agents of the Wizard known only as Mentor, Zargon&#x27;s former master and keeper of a book called Loretome, which contains all the world&#x27;s knowledge. The four player characters offer a choice of gameplay. The Barbarian and Dwarf allow a more combat-oriented game, while the Wizard and Elf can cast spells. The artwork and miniatures of each character are standardised, but the equipment stats vary somewhat from this basic portrait.

; Barbarian: The barbarian figurine is tall, muscular and equipped with a broadsword (starting weapon). As the strongest in combat, this race also benefits from significant health but lacks magical abilities and is notably vulnerable to magical attacks.
; Dwarf: The dwarf figurine is short, stocky and well armored, carrying a battle axe. He is very good in health, but lacks the attack strength of the barbarian and the magical prowess of the elf or wizard. However, the dwarf can boast the unique ability of being able to disarm traps without the aid of a toolkit. His starting weapon is a short sword.
; Elf: The elf figurine is tall and slender, armed with a short one-handed sword. He is equal in attack strength to the dwarf, but is less physically robust. He is able to use one type of spell element (air, earth, fire, or water magic) and can resist magical attacks more effectively. His starting weapon is a short sword. In the 2021 re-release, the elf figurine is female.
; Wizard: The wizard figurine wears a full-length cloak and carries a staff. In combat, he is the weakest in attack and health and is unable to use most weapons and armor, but compensates for this by being able to use three types of spell elements, for a total of nine spells. His greater mind allows him to be the hero most resistant to the effects of magic. His starting weapon is a dagger.

==Gameplay==
The game is played on a grid representing the interior of a dungeon or castle, with walls segmenting the grid into rooms and corridors. One player assumes the role of the evil wizard character (Zargon/Morcar), and uses a map taken from the game&#x27;s quest book to determine how the quest is to be played. The map details the placement of monsters, artifacts, and doors, as well as the overall quest the other players are embarking upon. Quests vary and include scenarios such as escaping a dungeon, killing a particular character, or obtaining an artifact. The evil wizard first places the entry point on the map, usually a spiral staircase, although on some quests the players enter via an external door or begin in a specific room. The map may also specify a &quot;wandering monster&quot;. This is a monster that may enter the game if a player is unlucky while searching for treasure.

The remaining players select their character from the four available. If the wizard is chosen while the Elf is not then the wizard player may choose any three spell sets. If the Elf is chosen while the wizard is not then the Elf may choose any spell set. If both the wizard and Elf are chosen then the wizard chooses a spell set first, then the Elf chooses a set and the wizard gets the remaining two sets. The players may also start the quest with items collected on previous quests, such as extra weapons, armor, and magic items.

The game begins with the gamemaster reading the quest story from the perspective of Mentor, to set the scene for the game about to be played. Starting with the player to the left of the evil wizard, the game begins.

During a Hero&#x27;s turn, the player can move before or after performing one of the following actions: attack, cast a spell, search for traps and secret doors, search for treasure.

===Movement===
Players roll two six-sided dice, referred to as &quot;Red Dice&quot; in the game manual, and may then move up to that number of squares. A player does not need to move the full amount of the roll and can end movement at any time. Players may move over a square occupied by another player if the occupying player grants permission, but may not occupy the same square. Doors, monsters, and other objects are placed on the board by the evil wizard player according to line of sight. Once placed on the board they are not removed unless killed, thereby providing a steady stream of monsters for the evil wizard player to use.

===Combat===
Combat involves special six-sided dice, referred to as &quot;White Combat Dice&quot; in the manual, each bearing 3 &quot;skull&quot; sides, 2 &quot;Hero&quot; shield sides and 1 &quot;monster/Zargon&quot; shield side. The character players and the evil wizard player use the same dice, but the evil wizard player has a smaller chance of rolling their specific shield. The number of dice used is determined by the basic statistics of the player or monster, whether they are attacking or defending, plus any modifiers due to spells or items being carried.

The attacker attempts to roll as many skulls as possible, and the defender as many shields as possible. If the attacker rolls more skulls than the defender rolls shields, the defender loses body points according to how many skulls they failed to defend. If a character&#x27;s body point count falls to zero, they are killed and must be removed from the game. If there is a fellow hero in the same room or hall when the hero died, that hero may then pick up all weapons, armor, gold and any artifacts. At the start of the next quest a new hero can be created and then given all items. If the hero dies with no other hero in the same room or hall then the monster collects all items and all are then lost forever.

===Spell casting===
The Wizard and the Elf are the only two player characters allowed to use spells, and must choose their spells from four sets of element-themed (Air, Fire, Water, Earth) spell cards, each consisting of three spells. A further set of 12 &quot;Chaos Spells&quot; is available to Zargon, but the use of those spells is restricted to special monsters. Spells can be broadly split into offensive, defensive, passive varieties with their use and effect to varying degrees. Some spells must be played immediately before attacking or defending, and all require the target to be &quot;visible&quot; to the character using the game&#x27;s line-of-sight rules. Each spell may only be cast once per quest in the base game.

===Searching for traps and secret doors===
There are four kinds of traps in &quot;HeroQuest&quot;: pit traps, spear traps, chest traps, and occasionally falling rocks. Of these, only spear traps and chest traps do not appear on the board as they are activated only once and then they have no lingering effects. If a pit trap is not discovered and a player walks over it, they fall in losing one body point. The pit will remain in play as a square that may be jumped over. A falling rock trap will cause a rock slide tile to remain in play as a square that must now be navigated around, much like a wall. A quest may also contain secret doors which allow alternative routes to the objective or access to secret rooms containing treasure or monsters.

A player can only search for traps and secret doors in the room or corridor they are currently standing, and only if there are no monsters within the room or corridor. When this happens, the evil wizard character indicates where any traps may be and places secret door objects on the map. Trap tiles are only placed onto the board once a hero springs the trap. It is important for players to remember where traps are once they have been revealed.

The dwarf is the only character that can disarm traps without the aid of the specialized kit which is either bought in the armory or found during certain quests.

===Searching for treasure===
In a similar manner, players can search a room for treasure if no monsters are in the room. On some quests, searching for treasure in certain rooms will yield a particularly valuable artifact. More likely, however, the quest will not have specified any treasure for the current location and instead a treasure card is taken. Out of the 25 Treasure Cards, 6 are Wandering Monster cards and 4 are Hazard Cards, making a total of 10 disadvantage cards that get put back in the deck when discovered. There is also a chance that searching for treasure may trigger chest traps that were not disarmed, or cause monsters to attack, usually a Gargoyle already in the room that does not move at first and cannot be harmed until it does move or attacks a hero.

===Game end===
The game ends when every player has either returned to the spiral staircase, exited by a door or been killed by the evil wizard. If the objective of the quest has not been accomplished then the evil wizard character wins. Items collected during the quest may be kept for future quests. The quests usually form part of a longer story, especially the quests which are part of the expansion packs.

This expansion featured a female elf blue hero miniature. Its name was changed to &quot;Quest Pack for the Elf&quot; in a settlement after Warp Graphics, owner of the &quot;ElfQuest&quot; trademark, brought suit against Milton Bradley for infringement.

==Reception==
The board game sold over 300,000 units by 1990.

In the August 1989 edition of &quot;Games International&quot; (Issue 8), Philip A. Murphy thought that &quot;HeroQuest&quot; &quot;plays simply but effectively&quot; but he noted a few flaws, mainly to do with loopholes in the rules that players can quickly take advantage of. He concluded by giving it an average rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars, saying, &quot;&quot;HeroQuest&quot; is a good game waiting to be a great one.&quot;

In the April 1991 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue #168), Ken Rolston was enthusiastic about this game, commenting that it &quot;scores early and often in toy value and accessibility for young gamers [...] a simple fantasy board game that ingeniously incorporates the [fantasy role-playing game] convention of the gamemaster/referee who confronts a cooperative party of adventurers with deadly traps, monsters, and arch-villains.&quot; He did admit that the adventures were pre-programmed, noting that &quot;this game provides none of the broad creative and improvisational impulses that the D&amp;D game provides.&quot; He also noted that this was a game for children, saying, &quot;I can’t see myself playing the &quot;HeroQuest&quot; game with other adults, particularly with FRPG or board-game veterans, unless everyone’s tongue is firmly planted in cheek.&quot;

In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath noted, &quot;this game is calibrated for kids and, despite claiming to be cooperative, it truly shines with chaotic chemistry when a bunch of gloryhound eleven-year-olds resort to backstabbing each other to be king of the hill.&quot; Horvath concluded, &quot;&quot;HeroQuest&quot; represents an unprecedented gateway into RPGs and associated hobbies ... [it] clarifies and distills the whole experience of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;-style RPGs on both sides of the game screen, simply being an approachable, standalone game.&quot;

==Awards==
At the 1992 Origins Awards, &quot;HeroQuest&quot; won for &quot;Best Graphic Presentation of a Boardgame 1991&quot;.

<doc id="673402" wikidata="Q738447" url="?curid=673402" title="Yes, Dear">
<text>Yes, Dear is an American sitcom created by Alan Kirschenbaum and Gregory Garcia that originally ran on CBS for six seasons, from October 2, 2000, to February 15, 2006, with a total of 122 episodes. It starred Anthony Clark, Jean Louisa Kelly, Mike O&#x27;Malley, and Liza Snyder.

Critics panned the show when it premiered and anticipated it to be canceled during its first season. Despite this, &quot;Yes, Dear&quot; ended up being a sleeper hit for CBS. In March 2006, CBS canceled the series after 6 seasons, after Anthony Clark was hired to host NBC&#x27;s &quot;Last Comic Standing&quot;.

==Premise==
Greg Warner, a successful businessman in the film industry, and Kim, his level-headed stay-at-home wife, do their best to be the perfect parents to their young son, Sammy (and later daughter, Emily). Things become difficult when Kim&#x27;s sister Christine and her husband Jimmy Hughes move into the Warners&#x27; guest house with their two rambunctious boys, Dominic and Logan.

==Episodes==

==Cast==
===Main cast===
*Anthony Clark as Gregory &quot;Greg&quot; Warner
*Jean Louisa Kelly as Kimberly &quot;Kim&quot; Warner (née Ludke)
*Mike O&#x27;Malley as James &quot;Jimmy&quot; Hughes Jr.
*Liza Snyder as Christine Hughes (née Ludke)

===Recurring===
====Children====
*Joel Homan as Dominic Hughes (Episodes 3–122) (credited as Main Cast)
*Anthony and Michael Bain as Sammy Warner
*Madison and Marissa Poer as Emily Warner (Seasons 4–6)
*Christopher and Nicholas Berry as Logan Hughes (Seasons 1–2)
*Alexander and Shawn Shapiro as Logan Hughes (Season 3 Ep 2–9)
*Brendon Baerg as Logan Hughes (Seasons 3–6)
** A running gag in the later seasons involves Jimmy being confused when reflecting on Logan&#x27;s childhood, by showing short scenes of each of Logan&#x27;s various actors (i.e. Logan constantly being a different child and hence his appearance always changing)

====Grandparents====
*Tim Conway as Tom Warner (Greg&#x27;s father)
*Vicki Lawrence as Natalie Warner (Greg&#x27;s mother)
*Jerry Van Dyke as James &quot;Big Jimmy&quot; Hughes Sr. (Jimmy&#x27;s father)
*Beth Grant as Kitty Hughes (Jimmy&#x27;s mother)
*Dan Hedaya as Don Ludke (Kim and Christine&#x27;s father)
*Alley Mills as Jenny Ludke (Kim and Christine&#x27;s mother)

====Co-workers====
*Billy Gardell as Billy Colivita
*Phill Lewis as Roy Barr
*Brian Doyle-Murray as Mr. George Savitsky

== Cancellation ==
CBS originally announced the cancellation of &quot;Yes, Dear&quot; in early 2004, but later ordered a fifth season of 13 episodes to debut at midseason, after the show cut its license fee to secure the renewal. After canceling &quot;Center of the Universe&quot;, CBS debuted the fifth season of &quot;Yes, Dear&quot; on Wednesday, February 16, 2005, at 9:30 p.m. Eastern. CBS then ordered a sixth season of 22 episodes to air from 2005 to 2006, but that order was then reduced to 13 episodes. Two episodes that were prevented from airing during season five due to news preemptions were pushed to season six. On May 15, 2006, CBS announced that &quot;Yes, Dear&quot; has been canceled after 6 seasons.

== Syndication ==
Reruns of &quot;Yes, Dear&quot; aired on TBS from 2004 until 2012, Nick at Nite from 2012 until 2014, CMT from 2012 until 2013, and NickMom from 2013 until 2015.

== Connection with &quot;Raising Hope&quot; ==
In 2010, Garcia premiered a new show, titled &quot;Raising Hope&quot; from Fox. In the third season, in episode sixteen, Brian Doyle-Murray is shown as an executive of the Hollywood studio, a reference to his role as Mr. Savitsky.

In the next episode, Mike O&#x27;Malley and Liza Snyder reprise the characters of Jimmy and Christine Hughes and are prominently featured as characters who have made a habit of watching a sex video made by the characters in the new series, Virginia and Burt Chance. Dominic, Logan, and the guest house are also referred to in the conversation. Jimmy makes another appearance in the fourth season, in episode 19 (a different actress portrays Christine and is renamed Christy).

<text>My Girl is a 1991 American coming-of-age romantic comedy-drama film directed by Howard Zieff, written by Laurice Elehwany, and starring Dan Aykroyd, Jamie Lee Curtis, Macaulay Culkin, and Anna Chlumsky in her first role in a major motion picture. The film tells the story of an 11-year-old girl living in Madison, Pennsylvania, during the summer of 1972. The film&#x27;s title refers to the classic 1964 song of the same name by The Temptations, which is also featured in the film&#x27;s end credits. A book based on the film was written by Patricia Hermes. The film grossed $121 million on a budget of $17 million. A sequel, &quot;My Girl 2&quot;, was released in 1994.

==Plot==

Vada Sultenfuss is an 11-year-old girl living in Madison, Pennsylvania in the summer of 1972. Her father, Harry Sultenfuss, operates the town&#x27;s funeral parlor, which is also their home. Her upbringing leads her to suffer from hypochondria and develop an obsession with death, which her father fails to understand. Also living with them are &quot;Gramoo&quot;, Vada&#x27;s paternal grandmother, whose recent dementia accentuates Vada&#x27;s worries, and Harry&#x27;s older brother Phil.

Vada hangs out with Thomas J. Sennett, an unpopular boy her age who is allergic to &quot;everything&quot;. Other girls tease them, thinking they are more than just friends. Thomas J. often accompanies Vada when she visits the doctor, who assures her that she is not sick.

During the summer, Vada befriends Shelly DeVoto, the new makeup artist at the funeral parlor, who provides her with guidance. Vada has a crush on Mr. Bixler, her fifth-grade teacher, and hears about an adult poetry writing class he is teaching. Wondering how to pay for the class, she takes money from a cookie jar in Shelly&#x27;s camper. During her first class, when suggested to write about what is in her soul, Vada fears that she killed her mother, who died two days after childbirth.

When Harry and Shelly start dating, Vada&#x27;s attitude towards Shelly changes. One night, she follows them to a bingo game and brings Thomas J. along to disrupt it. On the Fourth of July, when Shelly&#x27;s ex-husband Danny shows up, Vada hopes that Shelly will take him back, to no avail.

Following the holiday, Vada and Thomas J. knock down a beehive in the woods. Vada loses her mood ring in the process, and while they look for it, the bees swarm and force them to run away. Harry invites Vada to a carnival; she becomes distressed when he and Shelly announce their engagement there, leading her to contemplate running away.

Later, Vada screams when she believes that she is hemorrhaging. Shelly explains that she is experiencing her first period. As Vada accepts that this happens only to girls, she angrily rebuffs Thomas J. when he comes to visit. A couple of days later, Vada and Thomas J. sit under a willow tree, wondering what a first kiss feels like, so they share one. After Vada heads home, Thomas J. returns to the woods to search for her mood ring. Unaware that the beehive they knocked down is still active, he is killed by the bees due to his allergy.

Harry delivers the tragic news to Vada, who stays in her bedroom for a full day. Shelly suggests that Harry console Vada, but he brushes her off. Shelly urges him to realize the significance of his daughter&#x27;s pain. When Vada leaves her bedroom and sees Thomas J.&#x27;s body in his casket, she runs away out of grief to Mr. Bixler&#x27;s house, wanting to stay with him, but flees after discovering that he is engaged.

Vada grieves by the willow tree where she and Thomas J. hung out. When she returns home, everyone is relieved, including Shelly, whom Vada begins to accept as her future stepmother. Her grief also mends the rift between her and her father, who assures Vada that her mother&#x27;s death was not her fault.

Toward the end of summer, Vada and her father comfort Mrs. Sennett, who still struggles with her son&#x27;s death. She returns Vada&#x27;s mood ring, which Thomas J. had found. On the last day of her writing class, Vada reads a poem in memory of her best friend.

==Production==
The screenplay, written by Laurice Elehwany, was originally titled &quot;Born Jaundiced&quot;, and was purchased by Imagine Entertainment in July 1990. On August 24, 1990, it was reported in &quot;Daily Variety&quot; that the screenplay had been re-titled to &quot;I Am Woman&quot;, but was subsequently changed to its final title, &quot;My Girl&quot;, in the spring of 1991. Elehwany based the fictional setting of Madison on the small towns in southwestern Pennsylvania where she grew up.

Culkin and Chlumsky were cast in the lead roles of Thomas J. and Vada, respectively, in January 1991. Filming took place in Bartow and Sanford, Florida beginning in February 1991. Exteriors of the Sultenfuss home were supplied by a real Victorian home in Bartow, while the house&#x27;s interiors were built on a soundstage in Orlando.

When &quot;My Girl&quot; was submitted to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) in September 1991, it was rated PG-13. Later that month, the film&#x27;s producers won an appeal to have the film reclassified to a PG rating.

==Release==
&quot;My Girl&quot; was released on November 27, 1991.

===Critical response===
The film holds a 55% score on Rotten Tomatoes based on 22 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;My Girl&quot; has a mostly sweet story and a pair of appealing young leads, but it&#x27;s largely undone by its aggressively tearjerking ending.&quot; Roger Ebert gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, writing: &quot;The beauty in this film is in its directness. There are some obligatory scenes. But there are also some very original and touching ones. This is a movie that has its heart in the right place.&quot; Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised Chlumsky&#x27;s performance in the film, but conceded that &quot;there’s something discomforting about a movie that takes the experience of an audacious, conflicted child and reduces it to: She needs to Confront Her Feelings. &quot;My Girl&quot; has some sweet, funny moments (the cast is uniformly appealing), yet it unfolds in a landscape of paralyzing, pop-psych banality.&quot;

Film critic Caryn James cited the film as being part of a &quot;trend toward stronger, more realistic themes in children&#x27;s films&quot;, specifically its representations of death, specifically that of a young child. David Kehr of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote of the film: &quot;If &quot;My Girl&quot; helps stimulate family discussions of death and loss, it will certainly have done some good in the world. But at the same time, its aesthetic interest is virtually nil... Though &quot;My Girl&quot; seeks to stir large, devastating emotions, Zieff seems afraid to touch on anything too difficult or unpleasant, lest it alienate his audience. The results are curiously gutless and unmoving, as Zieff finds himself stuck with a sentimentality without substance, a poetry without pain.&quot; Peter Rainer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was similarly critical of the film&#x27;s &quot;syrupy&quot; elements, concluding: &quot;The mixture of winsomeness and deadpan frights in &quot;My Girl&quot; ought to be weirder and more interesting than it is. After all, a girl who survives a household where bodies are embalmed in the basement is the kind of plucky heroine that movies about kids need right now. Or movies about adults, for that matter.&quot;

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was critical of the screenplay for being made up of &quot;loose ends bound together only by intimations of mortality and family crisis,&quot; summarizing: &quot;It&#x27;s not hard for the maudlin &quot;My Girl&quot; to make its audience weepy at the sight of America&#x27;s favorite kid in an open coffin. But it is difficult for this film to mix the sugary unreality of a television show with such a clumsy and manipulative morbid streak.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; noted: &quot;Plenty of shrewd commercial calculation went into concocting the right sugar coating for this story of an 11-year-old girl&#x27;s painful maturation, but [the] chemistry seems right.&quot;

===Box office===
&quot;My Girl&quot; opened at No. 2 with $12,391,783, grossing $59,489,799 domestically, and $62 million internationally for a worldwide total of $121,489,799.

==Music==
The soundtrack of the film contains several 1960s and 1970s pop hits, in addition to the title song (by The Temptations), including &quot;Wedding Bell Blues&quot; (The 5th Dimension), &quot;If You Don&#x27;t Know Me by Now&quot; (Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes), &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot; (Creedence Clearwater Revival), &quot;Good Lovin&#x27;&quot; (The Rascals), and &quot;Saturday in the Park&quot; (Chicago). When Vada gets upset, she plugs her ears and sings &quot;Do Wah Diddy Diddy&quot;, the Manfred Mann version of which is also included on the soundtrack album. In addition, Vada and Thomas J. play &quot;The Name Game&quot; and sing &quot;Witch Doctor&quot;, while Vada has posters of the Broadway musical &quot;Hair&quot;, the Carpenters, and Donny Osmond on her bedroom wall.

<doc id="673409" wikidata="Q845263" url="?curid=673409" title="Liquor Control Board of Ontario">
<text>The Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) is a Crown agency that retails and distributes alcoholic beverages throughout the Canadian province of Ontario. It is accountable to the Legislative Assembly through the minister of finance. It was established in 1927 by the government of Premier George Howard Ferguson to sell liquor, wine, and beer. Such sales were banned outright in 1916 as part of prohibition in Canada. The creation of the LCBO marked an easing of the province&#x27;s temperance regime. By September 2017, the LCBO was operating 651 liquor stores.

The LCBO maintained a quasi-monopoly on the trade in alcoholic beverage sales in Ontario for nearly a century after its creation: for most of this time, LCBO stores were the only retail outlets licensed to sell alcohol in Ontario, with the notable exceptions of beer (The Beer Store had a quasi-monopoly on retailing beer during most of this period) and a number of wine shops, which had once been relatively diverse but had largely consolidated into two major chains by the 2010s: the Wine Shop and Wine Rack. Many of these independent outlets were located on-site at wineries, breweries or distilleries themselves, with Wine Shop and Wine Rack locations often located within grocery stores. Because Ontario is Canada&#x27;s most populous province, with over 15 million people, or almost 40% of the nation&#x27;s population, LCBO&#x27;s quasi-monopoly status made it one of the world&#x27;s largest purchasers of alcoholic beverages.

In December 2015, the LCBO authorized some supermarkets to sell cider, wine, and beer within their grocery aisles, substantially weakening their and The Beer Store&#x27;s long near-monopoly statuses. As of December 9, 2016, nearly 130 grocery stores had been licensed to do so; 450 were expected to be licensed by 2020.

The LCBO remains the chief supplier of alcoholic beverages to bars and restaurants in Ontario, which are generally required by law to purchase their alcoholic products through the LCBO, The Beer Store, or directly from Ontario wineries and breweries. Beverages sold at bars and restaurants must be consumed on the establishments&#x27; premises. The LCBO was the parent company of the Ontario Cannabis Retail Corporation, the only entity licensed to sell cannabis for recreational use in Ontario. This is no longer true following the passage of the &quot;Cannabis Statute Law Amendment Act, 2018&quot;.

==History==
The LCBO was created in 1927 with the end of prohibition, which had been introduced in the province in 1916. The &quot;Liquor Control Act, 1927&quot; authorized the LCBO to &quot;control the sale, transportation and delivery&quot; of alcoholic beverages in Ontario. Brewers Retail was created to sell beer in a controlled manner while wines and spirits (as well as beer) were sold in LCBO outlets. Wineries and breweries were also allowed to sell from their own stores, which were limited in number.

In the 1924 Ontario prohibition plebiscite, voters chose, narrowly, by a margin of 51.5% to 48.5%, to retain the &quot;Ontario Temperance Act&quot; as opposed to the government-controlled sales of beverage alcohol. The Conservative government of George Howard Ferguson contested the 1926 provincial election on a platform of easing the temperance law. Upon reelection, it introduced the &quot;Liquor Control Act&quot; as a compromise between the complete prohibition demanded by the temperance movement and the unregulated sale of alcohol. Premier Ferguson stated that the &quot;Liquor Control Act&quot; was &quot;... to allow people to exercise a God-given freedom under reasonable restrictions&quot;. Ferguson was further quoted as saying the purpose of the LCBO was to &quot;promote temperance sobriety, personal liberty and, above all, to restore respect for the law&quot;. To achieve these goals LCBO was mandated by Ferguson&#x27;s government to employ an oversight mechanism in order to know &quot;exactly who is buying and how much, and what disposition is being made of it&quot;.

The first chief commissioner of the LCBO was David Blyth Hanna and the first 18 stores were opened on 1 June 1927, all designed with a clear glass store front to &quot;make the process appear apparent and with a complete absence of mystery&quot;, according to an LCBO document. Previously, only wine sales were legal but bootlegged liquor and beer were illegally sold. The business model was a process of &quot;disinterested management&quot;; the product was available but purchases were discouraged and moderation remained key. By the end of 1927, the province had 86 stores and three mail-order facilities.

From 1927–1962 the LCBO required people who wanted to purchase liquor to first obtain a permit (Individual Liquor Permit). The permit was valid for a year. They had to present these permits at the point of purchase, and the clerk at the liquor store would enter information about what, precisely, the individual had purchased.

Residents applied for and received individually-numbered (5 digits) liquor permits. A temporary (or duplicate) permit was a single sheet form with 6 digit number with effective and expiry dates. This was issued until the yearly permit form was received. It was also provided to non-resident visitors.

Between 1927 and 1957, these permits came in the form of passport sized books that consisted of two separate sections, the first which included the permit holder&#x27;s personal information (place of residence, marital status, occupation/employer, notes change of address) and a second section which kept a record of the individual&#x27;s purchase history (date, quantity, value, store number and initials). In 1957, Permit books were replaced with permit cards. These cards held the permit holder&#x27;s name and their permit number and also were needed in order to purchase liquor at the LCBO. When an individual wanted to make a purchase at an LCBO store, he or she had to fill in a purchase order form that included their name, address and permit number as well as the kind and volume of liquor that they wished to purchase. The purchase order form would be handed to an LCBO employee along with the individual&#x27;s liquor permit and the employee would &quot;examine [the] permit and see to what extent the purchaser has been buying liquor. If a purchaser had exceeded a reasonable quantity per week, the permit number and address would be noted and referred to vendor.&quot; Under the &quot;Liquor Control Act,&quot; the LCBO was to promote temperance through facilitating education and moderation. This meant a store employee could deny a sale to a customer if his intended purchases may be considered too large for one person to reasonably consume.

Purchase order forms were also used by the LCBO as a means of tracking irregularities in liquor purchases and sales and had to be stamped by the employee who had approved the sale and had filled the order. After the liquor permits books were phased out in 1957, purchase order forms were used as a means of establishing individuals&#x27; purchase histories in cases of legal investigations and the LCBO&#x27;s own control processes. Purchase order forms remained in use into the 1970s when the LCBO changed to a self-serve format.

To control what it considered to be excessive purchases or other abuses of the permit privilege, the LCBO employed a list called the interdiction list. Although interdiction was initially a formalized legal process imposed by a judge upon those found in open court to be &quot;drunkards&quot;, the board was charged with maintaining the list between 1927 and 1975 and employed its own standards in adding individuals to this list without any involvement of the justice system. The list was circulated to all liquor stores and drinking establishments, and was sent to local and provincial police forces to whom it was explained that it was a crime for listed individuals to possess or be sold any liquor. Between 1927 and 1975, the LCBO conducted its own investigations into over consumption, employing a staff of investigators that visited individuals&#x27; homes, work, banks, neighbors and even churches to determine if an individual should be restricted from purchasing liquor. From 1927–1935, the LCBO&#x27;s investigations resulted in the cancellation of over 33,138 liquor permits and the names of these individuals were added to the circulated interdiction list. In 1929, the LCBO&#x27;s use of the interdiction list was expanded to include those on social assistance as well as others who the board felt should be prohibited from purchasing liquor permits entirely. Between 1929 and 1951, when the LCBO ceased publishing interdiction data in its annual reports, 125,218 individuals had been added to the interdiction list in this way.

In 1934, the mandate of the LCBO was expanded to include the oversight of by-the-glass sale of alcohol in standard hotels and other drinking establishments. As part of the LCBO&#x27;s regulations, licensed establishments were required to adhere to a wide variety of regulations including a limitation on singing, the number of patrons allowed to sit together and most importantly the segregation of female from unmarried male drinkers (women were only allowed to drink in the presence of a &quot;bona fide escort&quot; in a segregated &quot;Ladies and Escorts&quot; room). The task of overseeing the sale of alcohol in drinking establishments was later passed in 1944 to a short-lived government licensing agency and later to the Liquor Licensing Board of Ontario (LLBO) in 1947.

The first self-service store was introduced in 1969. In the 1970s, the stores became more inviting with decorative displays of alcohol, and in the 2000s, were renovated and enlarged to hold more product. Most current stores have vintages sections with rotating selections of wines and spirits having low production volumes.

In the 1990s, the LCBO rebranded stores by removing the Ontario coat of arms and wording &quot;Liquor Store&quot; with the more stylized LCBO logo.

George Soleas was appointed president and CEO on June 9, 2016.

As of July 11, 2016, LCBO accepts tap-to-pay technology in each of their 654 stores in the province, allowing contactless payment for all purchases of liquor.
On July 5, 2024, employees went on strike for the first time in the LCBO&#x27;s history. The strike ended on July 22, 2024.

In February 2025, the LCBO was ordered by Ontario premier Doug Ford to remove all sales of American alcohol in response to the Second Trump tariffs.

===Sale of cannabis===

After the federal government announced that recreational use of cannabis would be legalized in 2017 or early 2018, then Premier Kathleen Wynne commented that the LCBO stores might be the ideal distribution network for stocking, controlling and selling such products. The Ontario Public Service Employees Union, which represents LCBO staff, also lobbied for the LCBO to have a monopoly on cannabis sales.

In response, the federal Task Force on Marijuana Legalization and Regulation recommended against selling cannabis in conjunction with alcohol. In September 2017, the Government of Ontario announced that the LCBO alone would sell recreational marijuana to the public in the province, except in the 651 stores that sell alcoholic beverages. A new Crown corporation, the Ontario Cannabis Retail Corporation (OCRC), was established as a subsidiary of the LCBO with a mandate to initially open 40 stores before legalization took effect in October 2018. OCRC also entered a partnership with Shopify to use the company&#x27;s platform for operating the province&#x27;s online cannabis sales. In March 2018, OCRC adopted the trading name Ontario Cannabis Store for its retail services. The OCS logo, designed by a Canadian subsidiary of Leo Burnett Worldwide as part of a $650,000 marketing and branding contract, was derided as &quot;boring&quot; and &quot;underwhelming.&quot;

Following the 2018 provincial election, the new provincial government led by Premier Doug Ford announced that OCRC would not open physical stores and that private stores would instead sell cannabis in Ontario. Under this new model OCRC will continue to operate the provincial online cannabis sales service and will serve as the wholesale supplier for private stores in Ontario. The Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario&#x27;s mandate will be widened to include regulation and licensing of private cannabis stores in Ontario. The OCRC would also be moved under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance, would no longer be a subsidiary of the LCBO, and would no longer use the Ontario Cannabis Store branding.

== Mandate and accountability ==

The mandate of the board is to supervise the business affairs of the LCBO. Among its responsibilities are:
* ensuring that the LCBO provides high-quality service to the public
* developing and approving the strategic plan and monitoring management&#x27;s success in meeting its business plans
* approving annual financial plans
* ensuring that the organization remains financially sound
* assessing the management of business risks
* submitting an annual financial plan to the minister of finance
* ensuring the organization has communications programs to inform stakeholders of significant business developments
* ensuring that the LCBO performs its regulatory role in a fair and impartial manner

The LCBO is accountable to its stakeholders in a number of ways, including:
* its annual report, required to be tabled in the Legislative Assembly and available for review, either in print or online
* annual audits of LCBO financial statements by the Office of the Provincial Auditor, as well as internal value-for-money audits of specific LCBO programs, including store planning
* public access to records under the &quot;Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act&quot;
* board members appointed by the lieutenant governor, through Orders in Council, on the recommendation of the premier and the minister of finance.
* various statutory reporting requirements under the &quot;Liquor Control Act&quot; to the minister of finance.
* compliance with Management Board&#x27;s Agency Accountability Directives.

==Signage==
The board&#x27;s policy states that &quot;In Ontario&#x27;s 25 designated areas, the operational signage in every LCBO store must be bilingual&quot; ... &quot;This type of signage includes stores&#x27; permanent signs and general notices, such as those in the aisles and for customer service.&quot;

==Pricing==


While it is impossible to generalize comparative pricing for the thousands of different alcoholic beverages available through LCBO, the stores have acquired a reputation for high prices. Online price comparisons with independent wine retailers such as Sherry-Lehman in neighbouring New York can indicate price differences ranging from 10% (in LCBO&#x27;s favour) to 30% (in the independent retailers&#x27; favour). Wines and spirits sold in Canada are subject to the &quot;Excise Act, 2001&quot;, which contributes greatly to the cost of beverage alcohol, although most liquor tax is provincial. &quot;Wine Access&quot;, a Canadian food and wine magazine, has claimed that high-end luxury brands sell in Ontario for up to 60% more than in New York. Excise duties on beer and malt liquor are taxed under the &quot;Excise Act&quot;.

The LCBO pricing policies are designed to control alcohol consumption, generate revenue for the provincial and federal governments, and to support the domestic alcohol beverage industry, especially by providing incentive to purchase Ontario wine. Within this framework, the prices of LCBO products are subject to three policy constraints:

* All prices are uniform throughout the province, despite inevitable differential costs incurred by transportation and distribution. This policy effectively subsidizes the transportation of goods into the rural parts of the province. Store managers have the right to reduce prices of &#x27;bin-end&#x27; items at their discretion.
* Less-intoxicating beverages such as light wines and beer are in effect sold by the LCBO at reduced prices, again with the stated object of influencing consumption patterns as part of the board&#x27;s social responsibility mandate.

==Profits==
The LCBO transferred a dividend of $2.58 billion to the provincial government in 2019.

==Debate over privatization==
There have been numerous discussions about whether the province should sell, or privatize, the LCBO. It has been argued that the main benefit would be the billions of dollars that would be the immediate windfall from any sale. This sale would only deliver a one-time profit, and the province would lose out on a source of steady yearly income. It has also been argued by the C. D. Howe Institute that the government could actually earn more money by dismantling the high-margin retail stores while keeping the lucrative wholesale business as Alberta&#x27;s privatization of the liquor business suggests. The LCBO&#x27;s 2006-07 net income was $1.3 billion Canadian dollars (excluding tax revenues generated by Brewers Retail and the independent wine stores), and a sale has been estimated to reap about six billion dollars. Former Premier Ernie Eves stated that when he investigated this possibility, he found that a 100 per cent sale through an income trust would generate 16 billion dollars.

In an attempt to find more revenue for the government within the current system, former Ontario Finance Minister Greg Sorbara ordered a review of the province&#x27;s liquor distribution methods, under the supervision of John Lacey, a former LCBO board member and grocery executive. Sorbara had stated that any option, other than the complete privatization of the LCBO, would be open for discussion. Subsequent to the release of the report, known as the Beverage Alcohol System Review (BASR), Sorbara rejected the report&#x27;s recommendations and argued for the continued public ownership of the LCBO. Rejection of the findings notwithstanding, the 2005 report defined the potential benefits of privatization alternatives as greater consumer convenience and choice via a competitive retail environment, a reduction in government-held investment risk while simultaneously increasing its annual revenues.

An earlier 1994 report from York University, created on behalf of the Ontario Liquor Boards Employees&#x27; Union, concluded there to be little governmental or public support for privatization. There may be political motivations to keep alcohol sales public as well, as the LCBO is an excellent source of sinecures for the sitting government. The current LCBO board chair is Carmine Nigro. Philip J. Olsson, a long-time Liberal supporter, was the former chair appointed by the Liberal government shortly after they took power. Prior to Olsson was Andy Brandt, who was appointed by New Democratic Premier Bob Rae in 1991, even though Brandt had been a Progressive Conservative member of Provincial Parliament for a number of years. In 2007, LCBO separated the board chair and president/CEO functions, making the board chair position part-time. Olsson receives a &quot;per-diem&quot; for his work as board chair, which he donates to the United Way.

==Recycling program==
The LCBO has phased out its plastic shopping bags, as part of its efforts to become a greener organization. LCBO customers are encouraged to bring their own reusable bags, but can also request handle-less LCBO paper bags or buy reusable bags at the store. Cardboard carrying boxes for individual cans of beer were phased out, with a limited reintroduction during the fall of 2017. As of 2020, 8 pack beer carriers are available at all LCBO locations again. The LCBO says the new limited options are expected to eliminate approximately 80 million plastic bags a year from landfill.

In September 2006, the Government of Ontario announced the Ontario Deposit Return Program, a recycling program for LCBO and winery store beverage alcohol containers. The program, which commenced operations on 5 February 2007, is administered and operated by Brewers Retail Inc. Under the program, consumers may return empty bottles, tetra paks, PET plastic and bag-in-box containers, to The Beer Store outlets. This program has been highly criticized by members of the public and employees of The Beer Store. Beer Stores were seeing upward of 50,000 LCBO containers per week while the unprofitable nature of the program forced wage cuts and staff reductions across Ontario&#x27;s primary beer distributor.

The deposit rates for the bottles are as follows:
* Large bottles (greater than 630 ml) – $0.20 each
* Small containers (equal to or less than 630 ml) – $0.10 each

Through its Natural Heritage Fund, LCBO and its suppliers have raised almost $2 million for projects to restore and rehabilitate Ontario wildlife habitat. This includes Bring Back the Salmon, which helps the return of Atlantic salmon to Lake Ontario after its local extinction over 100 years ago.

==Agencies==
An LCBO Agency is a legally licensed outlet of the Liquor Control Board of Ontario. Such agencies are placed in small towns and areas far from a full-service LCBO location. Agency locations are operated by private businesses and allocated through a competitive process.

==Controversies==
===Cellared in Canada===
In late 2009, local and international criticism of the &quot;Cellared in Canada&quot; practice and the LCBO emerged. Under the &quot;Cellared in Canada&quot; label, which is now officially known as &quot;International - Canadian blends&quot;, Canadian wine producers are allowed to import pre-fermented grape must from grapes grown in other countries to produce wines under their own wine label, although in practice, it is usually finished wine which is imported to be included in International - Canadian blends. In Ontario, producers are allowed to designate these wines as &quot;cellared&quot; in Canada if they contain a portion of local Ontario grapes. As of April 1, 2014, this percentage is 25% Ontario wine, which may be from labrusca varieties. Historically, this percentage has fluctuated wildly, due to periodic shortages and surpluses of Ontario grapes, and heavy lobbying by large producers and some grape growers.

Grape growers in Ontario have deemed this practice a threat to their livelihood, asserting that thousands of tons of Canadian grapes are left rotting on the vine, while large producers use imported grapes to make wine labelled as &quot;Canadian&quot;. Growers and producers have criticized this practice as tarnishing the reputation of Canadian wines and misleading consumers. They have also petitioned the government for several changes in the practices, such as making the origin of grapes clearer on the wine label, and increasing the visibility of 100% Canadian Vintners Quality Alliance (VQA) wines in province-run liquor stores. As of August 2009, the stores of the LCBO featured less than 2.5% Canadian wine produced by VQA members, with the vast majority of its wines produced under the &quot;International - Canadian blend&quot; designation with up to 75% foreign wine. Bottles generally say &quot;Cellared in Canada from International and Domestic Content&quot;.

===Age verification===
In May 2011, a study was conducted by Statopex Field Marketing on behalf of the Ontario Convenience Stores Association and found that the LCBO fared poorly when checking for age of minors. Minors between the age of 15 and 18 were used to determine how often LCBO store staff would check for ID before selling alcohol. Minors in the test were accompanied by an adult at a distance to verify any sales that occurred. The test determined that 1 in 4 minors were able to purchase beer at the LCBO without ID. This was poorer than the results shown for The Beer Store, where 1 in 5 minors could purchase beer, or chain convenience stores in Ontario where as few as 1 in 8 could purchase tobacco. The LCBO countered by stating its &quot;retail staff challenged 3.6 million people who appeared underage or intoxicated in 2010 and refused to serve more than 190,000 customers.&quot;

===Cannabis sale monopoly===
Some have questioned the methodical suitability of the OCRC monopoly on cannabis sales. The Cannabis Canada Association, a lobby group representing licensed medical marijuana growers, stated that &quot;a competitive market model would provide the Province with a predictable, low-risk revenue stream without the taxpayer burdens of upfront capital expenditure exposure and operational risk&quot;.

The debate proved to be merely of academic interest, since the newly-elected PC government decided in August 2018 that retail sales would be provided by private enterprise companies instead. Finance Minister Vic Fedeli stated: &quot;we will work with private sector businesses to build a safe, reliable retail system that will divert sales away from the illegal market.&quot;

===High theft incidence===
In late 2018, two articles published by the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; indicated that theft from the LCBO retail stores was a significant problem, and effectively mishandled. There had been some 9,000 thefts at LCBO outlets in Toronto alone since early 2014, according to data provided by the Toronto Police Service. In fiscal year 2018–2019, the LCBO saw more than $5.1 million in theft of alcohol. For reasons of personal safety, LCBO staff are discouraged from confronting shoplifters. &quot;The LCBO doesn’t want their staff getting into tussles with thieves inside the store, and I understand that. But when you couple that with a policing decision that says we just don’t have the resources to respond unless the thief is on the scene, you lose a lot of the deterrent,&quot; said Mike McCormack, president of the Toronto Police Association. As a result, thefts were likely to continue, leading to frustration by staff and the public.

<doc id="673421" wikidata="Q1946716" url="?curid=673421" title="311 (album)">
<text>311 (commonly known as the Blue Album) is the third studio album by American rock band 311, released on July 11, 1995, by Capricorn Records. The album contains the successful singles &quot;Don&#x27;t Stay Home&quot;, &quot;All Mixed Up&quot;, and &quot;Down&quot;, and was certified triple platinum with sales of over three million copies.

==Reception==
AllMusic&#x27;s Peter Stepek was positive towards the album, saying &quot;These riff-heavy and radio-ready songs are underscored by a tight drum sound (often with a piccolo snare), the scratching of turntables, and the crunch of heavy guitars: a formidable backdrop for this surprisingly melodic effort. The rhythms of reggae and ska percolate through this mix, and the harmonies of Nick Hexum and S.A. Martinez lend the band an edge not found in the majority of bands that feature rapping over rock beats.&quot; Rolling Stone says the album has &quot;ear candy with good beats&quot; and &quot;remarkably adept at genre juggling&quot;. They also describe the album as &quot;Beasties-cum-Chili Peppers traits has a potent reggae undertow&quot;.

==Track listing==
&quot;Misdirected Hostility&quot; was written in reference to the violence between the Phunk Junkeez and their back-up vocalist K-Tel Disco.

”Jackolantern’s Weather” was going to have a music video, released around Halloween, but the band declined because “they said they were tired.”

The initial pressing of the album was distributed by &quot;RED&quot; and later re-pressed and distributed by Mercury Records in 1996 (note the tray card and disk updated with Mercury contact information and slightly washed out color on the disk front).

<doc id="673430" wikidata="Q1428777" url="?curid=673430" title="Hawker Hart">
<text>The Hawker Hart is a British two-seater biplane light bomber aircraft that saw service with the Royal Air Force (RAF). It was designed during the 1920s by Sydney Camm and manufactured by Hawker Aircraft. The Hart was a prominent British aircraft in the inter-war period, but was obsolete and already side-lined for newer monoplane aircraft designs by the start of the Second World War, playing only minor roles in the conflict before being retired.

Several major variants of the Hart were developed, including a navalised version for the Royal Navy&#x27;s aircraft carriers. Beyond Britain, the Hart would be operated by a number of foreign nations, including Sweden, Yugoslavia, Estonia, South Africa, and Canada.

==Design and development==
In 1926, the Air Ministry stated a requirement for a two-seat high-performance light day-bomber, to be of all-metal construction and with a maximum speed of 160 mph (258 km/h). Designs were tendered by Hawker, Avro and de Havilland. Fairey, who had sold a squadron&#x27;s worth of its wooden Fox bomber in 1925, was not at first invited to tender to the specification, and was sent a copy of the specification only after protesting to the Chief of the Air Staff, Hugh Trenchard.

Hawker&#x27;s design was a single-bay biplane powered by a Rolls-Royce F.XI water-cooled V12 engine (the engine that later became known as the Rolls-Royce Kestrel). It had, as the specification required, a metal structure, with a fuselage structure of steel-tube covered by aluminium panels and fabric, with the wings having steel spars and duralumin ribs, covered in fabric. The crew of two sat in individual tandem cockpits, with the pilot sitting under the wing trailing edge, and operating a single .303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers machine gun mounted on the port side of the cockpit. The observer sat behind the pilot, and was armed with a single Lewis gun on a ring mount, while for bomb-aiming, he lay prone under the pilot&#x27;s seat. Up to 520 pounds (240 kg) of bombs could be carried under the aircraft&#x27;s wings.

The prototype Hart, serial &quot;J9052,&quot; first flew in June 1928, being delivered to the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment at RAF Martlesham Heath on 8 September. It demonstrated good performance and handling, reaching 176 mph (283 km/h) in level flight and in a vertical dive. The competition culminated in the choice of the Hawker Hart in April 1929. The de Havilland Hound was rejected due to handling problems during landing and because of its part-wooden primary structure. While the Avro Antelope demonstrated similar performance and good handling, the Hart was preferred as it was far cheaper to maintain, a vital aspect to a programme during defence budget constraints that the British armed forces faced during the 1920s. The Fairey Fox IIM (which despite the name was a new aircraft), delayed by Fairey&#x27;s late start on the design compared to the other competitors, only flew for the first time on 25 October 1929, long after the Hart had been selected.

A total of 992 aircraft were built as Harts. It became the most widely used light bomber of its time and the design would prove to be a successful one with a number of derivatives, including the Hawker Hind and Hector. There were a number of Hart variants, though only slight alterations were made to the design. The &quot;Hart India&quot; was a tropical version, the &quot;Hart Special&quot; was a tropical Hawker Audax, a Hart variant with desert equipment; a specialised &quot;Hart Trainer&quot; was also built which dispensed with the gunner&#x27;s ring. Vickers built 114 of the latter model at Weybridge between 1931 and June 1936.

The production Hart day bomber had a 525 hp (390 kW) Rolls-Royce Kestrel IB 12-cylinder V-type engine; a speed of 184 mph (296 km/h) and a range of 470 mi (757 km). It was faster than most contemporary fighters, an astonishing achievement considering it was a light bomber. It also enjoyed excellent manoeuvrability, making the Hart one of the most effective biplane bombers ever produced for the Royal Air Force. In particular, it was faster than the Bristol Bulldog, which had recently entered service as the RAF&#x27;s front line fighter. This disparity in performance led the RAF to gradually replace the Bulldog with the Hawker Fury.

Demand was such that production was spread out among a wide selection of aircraft companies. Of the 962 built in the United Kingdom, Hawker produced 234, Armstrong Whitworth 456, Gloster 46, Vickers 226 and 42 were produced in Sweden under licence by ASJA who built 18, Götaverken who built three and the Central Workshops of the Air Force (CVM) who built 21. 1004 Harts were produced.

==Operational history==
The Hart entered service with No. 33 Squadron RAF in February 1930, replacing the larger and slower Hawker Horsley. No. 12 Squadron replaced its Foxes with Harts in January 1931, with a further two British-based Hart light bomber squadrons forming during 1931.

Harts were deployed to the Middle East during the Abyssinia Crisis of 1935–1936. The Hart saw extensive and successful service on the North-West Frontier, British India during the inter-war period. Four Hawker Harts from the Swedish Air Force saw action as dive bombers during the 1939–1940 Winter War as part of a Swedish volunteer squadron, designated F19, fighting on the Finnish side. Though obsolete compared to the United Kingdom&#x27;s opposition at the start of the Second World War, the Hart continued in service, mainly performing in the communications and training roles until being declared obsolete in 1943.

The Hart proved to be a successful export, seeing service with the Royal Egyptian Air Force, Royal Indian Air Force, South African Air Force, Estonian Air Force, Southern Rhodesia, Sweden (where it was designated B4) and the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The Rhodesian Hardys saw service on the Allied side during the opening moves of the East African theatre of World War II.

Swedish Air Force General Björn Bjuggren wrote in his memoirs how his squadron developed dive-bombing techniques in the mid-1930s for their B4s. When the Hawker engineers found out, they issued a formal objection, saying that the aircraft had not been designed for that purpose. However, the Swedish pilots proved that the aircraft was up to the task and dispelled their concerns.

===Audax===

The &quot;Hawker Audax&quot; was a Hart variant, designed for army cooperation, seeing much service in the British Empire. The first Audax flew in late 1931 and over 700 Audaxes were produced (including export). The Audax was similar to the Hart, though had some modifications, including a hook to pick up messages. It was armed with a single Scarff ring-mounted .303 in (7.7 mm) Lewis gun and a fixed forward-firing .303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers machine gun and was powered by a version of the Kestrel engine and had a maximum speed of . A number of variants of the Audax were produced, including the &quot;Audax India&quot;, a tropicalised version of the Audax for service in India and the &quot;Audax Singapore&quot; for service there.
Other air forces which also used the Audax included the Royal Canadian Air Force, the Royal Indian Air Force, the South African Air Force, the Royal Egyptian Air Force, the Royal Iraqi Air Force, the Imperial Iranian Air Force, the Straits Settlements and the Southern Rhodesian Air Force. During the Second World War the Audax saw limited service in Africa on the Kenya–Abyssinia border during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. The Audax also saw service in Iraq, at RAF Habbaniya, west of Baghdad, after the uprising there, during the Anglo-Iraqi War. In the days leading up to that battle crews began to upgrade the Audaxes stationed there, despite having received orders forbidding such actions. They fitted some to carry bombs instead of bombs.

The Audax ended its service by 1945. A derivative of the Audax, the &quot;Hawker Hartebeest&quot;, a light bomber, was built for the South African Air Force with modifications made from the Audax. Sixty-nine of these aircraft were built, the majority in South Africa. The aircraft saw action in East Africa during clashes against Italy who occupied Abyssinia.
A.V. Roe built 287 Audaxes as part of the RAF expansion scheme during 1935–1937. These did not warrant an Avro type number but between 1937 and 1938, Avro built 24 modernised Audaxes for the Egyptian government, powered by Armstrong Siddeley Panther VIA radials. Acknowledging the amount of redesign work done, these were designated the &quot;Avro Type 674&quot;.

===Demon===
The Hawker Demon was a fighter variant of the Hart light bomber. During air defence exercises the RAF&#x27;s Siskins and Bulldogs were often unable to intercept the new Hart bombers, which were sometimes instructed to restrict their height and speed in order to give the fighters a chance, which prompted the development of a fighter variant of the Hart.

While the Hawker Fury offered better performance, lower production volumes made it more expensive and therefore it remained available only in small numbers, so when a fighter version of the Hart was suggested, the Air Ministry selected the type as an interim fighter until higher-performance fighters could be bought in larger numbers. The new fighter variant added a second Vickers machine gun, while the coaming of the rear cockpit was angled to give a better field of fire, and a supercharged Kestrel IS engine was fitted. Evaluation of an initial batch of six aircraft, known as Hart Fighters by one flight of 23 Squadron during 1931 was successful, and larger orders followed for the fighter Hart, now known as the Hawker Demon. The production Demon&#x27;s first flight was on 10 February 1933.

305 Hawker Demons were built, including 232 for the RAF. The Demon was powered by versions of the Kestrel engine. It had an armament of a single rear .303 in (7.7 mm) Lewis Gun with two fixed .303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers machine guns in the nose. Many were fitted with a hydraulically-powered turret in the rear gunner&#x27;s position, which had been tested on the Hawker Hart. Demons were also sold to the Royal Australian Air Force. It saw only second-line operations during the Second World War.

Production of the Demon was undertaken by Hawker and by Boulton Paul Aircraft at their Wolverhampton factory, where their last example of 106 to be completed was delivered to the RAF in December 1937.

;Turret Demon
:Two-seat fighter version, informally known as the &quot;Turret Demon&quot;, fitted with a Frazer-Nash windshield/fairing to protect the rear gunner.

===Hardy===

The &quot;Hawker Hardy&quot; was a general-purpose variant of the &quot;Hawker Hart&quot; tropicalised to meet Air Ministry Specification G.23/33 as a Wapiti replacement in Iraq. The prototype was a production Hart which was modified with a modified radiator, a message pick-up hook, water containers and a desert survival kit. The prototype first flew on 7 September 1934, and the first production aircraft were delivered to 30 Squadron in January 1935. The &quot;Hardy&quot; saw some service during the Second World War, in Africa and the Middle East; the &quot;Hardys&quot; performing a number of operations against Italian-occupied Abyssinia as well as other areas of Africa. The &quot;Hardy&quot; also saw service with Southern Rhodesia. The last operational sortie by a Hardy was on 9 May 1941 and most of the survivors were scrapped, although some continued in service as communications aircraft. On 14 May 1941, the Belgian Colonial authorities obtained a Hawker Hardy from the South African Air Force. Painted in Belgian colours, the machine was used for observation missions, but unfortunately overturned while landing at Gambela airfield on 26 May 1941, effectively writing off the aircraft.

;Hardy I
:Two-seat general-purpose aircraft for the RAF, 47 built excluding one prototype modified from a Hart

===Hind===


The &quot;Hawker Hind&quot; was a derivative of the Hart and was intended to replace it. The Hawker Hector was a variant of the Hind and was used in the army co-operation role. It saw only limited service during the Second World War with the Royal Air Force. Hectors were also sold to Ireland.

===Osprey===

The &quot;Hawker Osprey&quot; was the navalised carrier-borne version of the Hart, performing in the fighter and reconnaissance roles. The Osprey had a single Rolls-Royce Kestrel II engine, and had a max speed of 168 mph (270 km/h). Its armament consisted of a single forward .303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers machine gun and one .303 in (7.7 mm) Lewis gun. The Osprey joined the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) in 1932, with 103 being built, and ended its career in 1944 after serving as a trainer for FAA pilots during the Second World War. By December 1936, Ospreys were being deployed by 701 Squadron based at RAF Kalafrana in the anti-submarine and anti-piracy role. The Osprey was also sold to the Swedish Air Force being used on the seaplane cruiser , which carried six Ospreys. Ospreys were also sold to the Portuguese Naval Aviation and the Spanish Republican Air Force.
