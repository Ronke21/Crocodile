<text>Tara Donna Reid (; born November 8, 1975) is an American actress and model. Her film roles established her status as a sex symbol in the late 1990s through the early 2000s.

In film, Reid is best known for her lead ensemble role as Vicky Lathum in the &quot;American Pie&quot; film series (1999–2001; 2012). Her other notable lead film roles include &quot;Urban Legend&quot; (1998), &quot;Body Shots&quot; (1999), &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; (2001), &quot;Van Wilder&quot; (2002), &quot;My Boss&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (2003) and &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; (2005). She had supporting roles in the films &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; (1998), &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot; (1999), &quot;Dr. T &amp; the Women&quot; (2000), and &quot;Just Visiting&quot; (2001).

In television, Reid had recurring roles as Ashley on the soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; (1995) and Danni Sullivan on the NBC series &quot;Scrubs&quot; (2003–2005). She had a co-lead role as secondary protagonist April Wexler in the &quot;Sharknado&quot; television film series (2013–2018). Reid hosted her own reality series on E!, titled &quot;Taradise&quot; (2005–2006).

==Early life==
Reid was born on November 8, 1975, and raised in Wyckoff, New Jersey, the daughter of Donna Reid (née Bennett) (1943 — October 21, 2018) and Thomas Reid (1940 — December 2016), both of whom were teachers and day-care center owners. Her father also worked on Wall Street. She is of mainly Irish with some Scottish, Italian, French, Hungarian, and English descent. Reid has twin younger siblings, Colleen and Patrick, and another brother, Tom.

She attended Professional Children&#x27;s School in Manhattan.

==Career==
Reid began acting at age six, becoming a regular on the game show &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot;, and appeared in over 100 commercials for corporations including Jell-O, McDonald&#x27;s, Crayola, and Milton Bradley. As a teenager, she was on &quot;Saved by the Bell: The New Class&quot;.

After moving to Hollywood in 1997, Reid transitioned to movies, landing a role in 1998&#x27;s &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;. Though the film disappointed at the box office, grossing only $17 million in the U.S., it went on to become a cult classic. Later that same year, she appeared in a larger role in a more financially successful film, &quot;Urban Legend&quot;, where she portrayed a sexy radio host and which grossed just under $40 million in the US and led to two sequels, though neither included Reid. In 1999, she appeared in a tiny role in another hit, &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot;. Reid found her first taste of real mainstream success when she portrayed the role of the virginal Vickie in &quot;American Pie&quot; (1999), which grossed over $100 million in the US. The film also marked her first film to reach number one at the box office. In 2001, she reprised the role in &quot;American Pie 2&quot;, which opened to $45 million and grossed over $145 million in the US, almost 50% more than its predecessor. Reid did not return for &quot;American Wedding&quot; (2003), but did reprise the character in the fourth theatrical film in the series, &quot;American Reunion&quot; (2012).

Following the success of &quot;American Pie 2&quot;, Reid starred in a number of commercial and critical misfires, including &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; and &quot;Van Wilder&quot;. She also starred as the youngest daughter of a Texas gynecologist in Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;Dr. T &amp; the Women&quot;, alongside Richard Gere. She returned to the small screen as a recurring character on the NBC sitcom &quot;Scrubs&quot;, appearing in 11 episodes of season three. Shortly thereafter, Reid appeared alongside Ashton Kutcher in &quot;My Boss&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, for which she was nominated for both Worst Supporting Actress and Worst Screen Couple at the 2004 Golden Raspberry Awards.

In 2005, she co-starred in infamous German filmmaker Uwe Boll&#x27;s &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; with Christian Slater. Her mispronunciation of &quot;Newfoundland&quot; became a popular Internet catchphrase. The film was panned by critics and Reid received a Razzie Award nomination for Worst Actress. Reid signed on to host the E!&#x27;s &quot;Wild On Tara Reid&quot; (later renamed &quot;Taradise&quot;), a program that showcased high-society vacations and hot spots. The show premiered on August 10, 2005, but it was cancelled in September, with Ted Harbert, E! Network&#x27;s president, saying it was &quot;incredibly difficult to produce with someone well-known.&quot;

In January 2007, Reid filmed a commercial with Daniel Conn for Dodo, an Australian budget telephone and Internet service provider. Between 2007 and 2008, she starred in a number of direct-to-video films, including &quot;7-10 Split/Strike&quot;, &quot;If I Had Known I Was a Genius&quot; (which was released at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival), and &quot;Clean Break/Unnatural Causes&quot;. She also played the main character in the made-for-television horror film &quot;Vipers&quot;. In 2010, she landed the role of Bonnie in the thriller film &quot;The Fields&quot;, which was released in 2011. In March 2011, she filmed a Funny or Die spoof trailer for &quot;The Big Lebowski 2&quot;.

On August 18, 2011, Reid was the second housemate to enter the British reality series &quot;Celebrity Big Brother 8&quot;. On September 2, she received the fewest votes and became the third celebrity to be evicted from the house.

In September 2011, Reid announced via her official Twitter page that she was to appear in Jedward&#x27;s new music video for &quot;Wow Oh Wow&quot;, which they started shooting in late October of the same year. In 2014, she appeared in their music video for &quot;Ferocious&quot;.

In 2013, she appeared in the hit Syfy film &quot;Sharknado&quot; which spawned five sequels in 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. Other projects Reid appeared in during the mid-2010s included comedy spoof &quot;The Hungover Games&quot;, horror film &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Farm&quot;, the Bollywood film &quot;Tie the Knot&quot;, and the TV series &quot;The Big Big Show&quot; with Andrew Dice Clay and Tom Green.

In 2019, Reid guest-starred as herself in an episode of &quot;The Boys&quot; where she attended a comic convention with Billy Zane.

== Other ventures ==
Reid has appeared on the cover of numerous magazines, including &quot;CosmoGirl&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Seventeen&quot;, &quot;Maxim&quot;, &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;Stuff&quot;, and &quot;FHM&quot;. She has appeared in television commercials for Jello, McDonald&#x27;s, Dodo Australia, and Crayola.

In 2007, Reid had shares in three restaurants (Bella, Geisha House, and The Shore) and opened Ketchup, a fast-food restaurant based in Los Angeles.

Reid and Ed Hardy designer Christian Audigier designed Mantra, a clothing line that hit high-end department stores in 2009. In 2014, she released a new swimwear line and a perfume, Shark by Tara, inspired by the film franchise &quot;Sharknado.&quot;

==Personal life==

In October 2006, Reid acknowledged in an interview with &quot;Us Weekly&quot; that she had undergone liposculpting. In the interview, she discusses how her plastic surgery &quot;went wrong&quot; and also explains why she decided to have plastic surgery done, saying that her breasts were uneven and that she wanted a &quot;sixpack&quot; for a new movie role. The liposuction resulted in deformity. In the same interview, Reid&#x27;s new plastic surgeon, Steven Svehlak, reported that he performed a procedure called a &quot;doughnut mastopexy&quot; to correct her original augmentation, and performed additional liposuction in hopes of evening out her abdomen.

===Relationships===
In March 2000, Reid met Carson Daly on the set of &quot;Total Request Live&quot; and they began dating. They shared an apartment in New York City and Daly proposed on October 29, 2000. In June 2001, Reid and Daly broke off their engagement.

On January 18, 2010, Reid&#x27;s boyfriend, Michael Axtmann, an Internet entrepreneur from Nuremberg, proposed to her at The Little Door restaurant in Los Angeles. The couple had reportedly planned an intimate ceremony for summer 2010. On April 20, it was reported that the wedding had been called off and the relationship had ended, with a representative stating: &quot;Tara Reid has confirmed that she will not be moving forward with her May 22 nuptials.&quot;

In November 2010, Reid began dating Danish businessman Michael Lillelund. According to &quot;People&quot;, on August 14, 2011, Reid&#x27;s spokesman reported that she and Lillelund had married the day before in Greece. Lillelund denied it, saying he had not been in contact with Reid since February.

In August 2011, Reid publicized that she had married Bulgarian financier Zachary Kehayov. In October of that year, she announced that they were not legally married.

Between 2013 and 2014, Reid was dating Israeli musician Erez Eisen from the band Infected Mushroom.

In 2016, Reid and actor Dean May participated in &quot;Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars&quot;, but were rejected when they were revealed not to be in a relationship.

In 2017, Reid was in a relationship with business executive Ted Dhanik.

<doc id="685665" wikidata="Q1361755" url="?curid=685665" title="Alexander horned sphere">
<text>The Alexander horned sphere is a pathological object in topology discovered by . It is a particular topological embedding of a two-dimensional sphere in three-dimensional space. Together with its inside, it is a topological 3-ball, the Alexander horned ball, and so is simply connected; i.e., every loop can be shrunk to a point while staying inside. However, the exterior is &quot;not&quot; simply connected, unlike the exterior of the usual round sphere.

==Construction==
The Alexander horned sphere is the particular (topological) embedding of a sphere in 3-dimensional Euclidean space obtained by the following construction, starting with a standard torus:
#Remove a radial slice of the torus.
#Connect a standard punctured torus to each side of the cut, interlinked with the torus on the other side.
#Repeat steps 1–2 on the two tori just added &quot;ad infinitum&quot;.

By considering only the points of the tori that are not removed at some stage, an embedding of the sphere with a Cantor set removed results.
This embedding extends to a continuous map from the whole sphere, which is injective (hence a topological embedding since the sphere is compact) since points in the sphere approaching two different points of the Cantor set will end up in different &#x27;horns&#x27; at some stage and therefore have different images.

==Impact on theory==
The horned sphere, together with its inside, is a topological 3-ball, the Alexander horned ball, and so is simply connected; i.e., every loop can be shrunk to a point while staying inside. The exterior is &quot;not&quot; simply connected, unlike the exterior of the usual round sphere; a loop linking a torus in the above construction cannot be shrunk to a point without touching the horned sphere. This shows that the Jordan–Schönflies theorem does not hold in three dimensions, as Alexander had originally thought. Alexander also proved that the theorem &quot;does&quot; hold in three dimensions for piecewise linear/smooth embeddings. This is one of the earliest examples where the need for distinction between the categories of topological manifolds, differentiable manifolds, and piecewise linear manifolds became apparent.

Now consider Alexander&#x27;s horned sphere as an embedding into the 3-sphere, considered as the one-point compactification of the 3-dimensional Euclidean space R3. The closure of the non-simply connected domain is called the solid Alexander horned sphere. Although the solid horned sphere is not a manifold, R. H. Bing showed that its double (which is the 3-manifold obtained by gluing two copies of the horned sphere together along the corresponding points of their boundaries) is in fact the 3-sphere. One can consider other gluings of the solid horned sphere to a copy of itself, arising from different homeomorphisms of the boundary sphere to itself. This has also been shown to be the 3-sphere. The solid Alexander horned sphere is an example of a crumpled cube; i.e., a closed complementary domain of the embedding of a 2-sphere into the 3-sphere.

==Generalizations==
One can generalize Alexander&#x27;s construction to generate other horned spheres by increasing the number of horns at each stage of Alexander&#x27;s construction or considering the analogous construction in higher dimensions.

Other substantially different constructions exist for constructing such &quot;wild&quot; spheres. Another example, also found by Alexander, is Antoine&#x27;s horned sphere, which is based on Antoine&#x27;s necklace, a pathological embedding of the Cantor set into the 3-sphere.

<text>Road racing is a North American term to describe motorsport racing held on a paved road surface. The races can be held either on a closed circuit or on a street circuit utilizing temporarily closed public roads. The objective is to complete a predetermined number of circuit laps in the least amount of time, or to accumulate the most circuit laps within a predetermined time period. Originally, road races were held almost entirely on public roads. However, public safety concerns eventually led to most races being held on purpose-built racing circuits.

Road racing&#x27;s origins were centered in Western Europe and Great Britain as motor vehicles became more common in the early 20th century. After the Second World War, automobile road races were organized into a series called the Formula One world championship sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA), while motorcycle road races were organized into the Grand Prix motorcycle racing series and sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM). The success and popularity of road racing has seen the sport spread across the globe with Grand Prix road races having been held on six continents. Other variations of road racing include; open-wheel racing, sports car racing, touring car racing, stock car racing, superbike racing, truck racing, kart racing and endurance racing.

==History of road racing==
===Early road racing===

The first organized automobile race was held on July 22, 1894, from Paris to Rouen, France. The first held in the United States was a 54-mile competition from Chicago to Evanston, Illinois and return, held on November 27, 1895. By 1905, the Gordon Bennett Cup, organized by the Automobile Club de France, was considered the most important race in the world. In 1904, the &quot;Association Internationale des Automobiles Clubs Reconnus&quot; was formed by several European automobile clubs. In 1904 the FIM created the international cup for motorcycles. The first international motorcycle road race took place in 1905 at Dourdan, France.

After disagreeing with Bennett Cup organizers over regulations limiting the number of entrants, the French automobile manufacturers responded in 1906 by organizing the first French Grand Prix race held at Le Mans. During the 1910s, the Elgin National Road Races held on public roads around Elgin, Illinois attracted competitors from around the country and drew large crowds of spectators. The first 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race was held in 1923. The Automobile Racing Club of America was founded in 1933 and became the Sports Car Club of America in 1944.

===Race course evolution===
The great majority of road races were run over a lengthy circuit of closed public roads, not purpose-built racing circuits. This was true of the Le Mans circuit of the 1906 French Grand Prix, as well as the Targa Florio (run on of Sicilian roads), the German Kaiserpreis circuit in the Taunus mountains, the French circuit at Dieppe, used for the 1907 Grand Prix and, the Isle of Man TT motorcycle road circuit first used in 1907. The exceptions were the steeply banked egg-shaped near oval circuit of Brooklands in England, completed in 1906, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, and the oval, banked speedways constructed in Europe at Monza in 1922 and at Montlhéry in 1924.

Road racing on public roads was banned in Great Britain in 1925 when a spectator was injured at the Kop Hill Climb event. The Royal Automobile Club (R.A.C.) and the Auto-Cycle Union (A.C.U.) stopped issuing permits for races on public roads, a policy that has not changed to this day. Donington Park was the first permanent park circuit in the United Kingdom and held its first motorcycle race in 1931. As automobile and motorcycle technology improved, racers began to achieve higher speeds that caused an increasing number of accidents on roads not designed for motorized vehicles. Public safety concerns ultimately caused the number of road racing events on public roads in Europe to decrease over the years. Notable exceptions are the Mille Miglia which was allowed to continue until 1957 and, the Pau Grand Prix which has been held on the city streets of Pau, France since 1933.

After the First World War, automobile and motorcycle road racing competitions in Europe and in North America went in different directions. Automobile and motorcycle racing in the United States was typically oval track racing on paved tracks such as the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the Milwaukee Mile track, or on dirt tracks using widely available horse racing circuits. Automobile dirt track racing would develop into stock car racing. American racing also branched out into drag racing.
Road racing traditions in Europe, South America, Great Britain and the British Commonwealth nations grew around races held on paved, public roads such as the Circuit de la Sarthe circuit near the town of Le Mans, France, the Spa-Francorchamps Circuit in Belgium and the Mount Panorama Circuit in Australia. Certain European race circuits were situated in mountainous regions where the topography meant that the roads featured numerous curves and elevation changes, allowing the creation of sinuous and undulating race courses such as the Nürburgring in the Eifel mountains of Germany and the Circuit de Charade in the Chaîne des Puys in the Massif Central of France. These circuits presented such a challenge that they were both feared and respected by racers. The long Nurburgring with more than 300 metres (1,000 feet) of elevation change from its lowest to highest points, was nicknamed &quot;The Green Hell&quot; by Jackie Stewart, due to its challenging nature. The sinuous track layout of the Charade circuit caused some drivers like Jochen Rindt in the 1969 French Grand Prix to complain of motion sickness, and wear open face helmets just in case.

===Post-war era===
In 1949 the FIM introduced the Grand Prix motorcycle racing world championship with the 1949 Isle of Man TT being the inaugural event. With the exception of the Monza circuit, all the Grand Prix races were held on street circuits. The Association Internationale des Automobiles Clubs Reconnus was renamed the Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile in 1946 and, plans were developed for a road racing world championship. In 1950, the FIA created the Formula One world championship, a competition of seven rounds that included the Indianapolis 500. A Formula I manufacturers&#x27; championship was begun in 1955.

The success of American racers such as Phil Hill and Dan Gurney in Formula One in the late 1950s sparked to a renewal of interest in road racing in the United States and, led to the construction of new road racing circuits such as Riverside International Raceway, Road America and Laguna Seca. The 1964 United States motorcycle Grand Prix was held at the Daytona International Speedway and led to increased international prominence for the Daytona 200 road race which peaked in 1974 with the victory by 15-time world champion Giacomo Agostini.

===Racing hazards and safety===
The dangers associated with the increasing speeds at road races were highlighted by the 1955 Le Mans disaster. With spectators seated near the edges of the circuit, two race cars came into contact causing one of the vehicles to crash into the embankment, where it exploded in a ball of flames and then plowed through the crowd of spectators. In addition to the driver of the race car, 83 spectators were killed and 120 were injured. Auto racing was temporarily banned in several countries after the Le Mans disaster until safety was improved for spectators. Switzerland would not allow circuit racing until the Zürich ePrix in 2018.

The Formula One championship experienced its worst tragedy during the 1961 Italian Grand Prix at Monza, when driver Wolfgang von Trips lost control of his Ferrari and crashed into a stand full of spectators, killing 15 and himself. In 1970, Jochen Rindt won the Formula One drivers&#x27; championship posthumously, the only man to do so, underlining the continuing risks associated with road racing. The tragedies highlighted the need for improved safety standards for both drivers and spectators; safety would continue to be an issue throughout the 1960s and 1970s.

When motorcycle racer Gilberto Parlotti was killed while competing in the 1972 Isle of Man TT, it sparked a rider&#x27;s boycott of the event led by multi-time world champion, Giacomo Agostini, a close friend of Parlotti. Once the most prestigious race of the year, the event was increasingly boycotted by the top riders, and in 1976, the Isle of Man TT finally succumbed to pressure for increased safety in racing events and had its world championship status revoked by the FIM. 
Another motorcycle racing incident occurred at Monza during the 1973 Italian motorcycle Grand Prix when a racing accident claimed the lives of world champion Jarno Saarinen and Renzo Pasolini. After the von Trips accident in 1961, the Monza Circuit had been lined with steel barriers as a result of demands by automobile racers. Most auto racers believed steel barriers would improve safety for auto racers and spectators, but they had the opposite effect for motorcyclists and proved fatal for Saarinen and Pasolini.

The dangers of street circuits was further exposed at the 1975 Spanish Grand Prix held on the twisty, tree-lined Montjuich circuit in Barcelona. The racing drivers found that the circuit&#x27;s safety barriers had been shoddily installed and threatened to strike if the barriers were not brought up to standard. Under pressure from race organizers, the race was started only to be stopped after 29 laps when the car of Rolf Stommelen plowed into the crowd, killing four spectators.

===Safety improvements===
By the late 1970s, the popularity of Grand Prix road racing attracted corporate sponsors and lucrative television contracts which, led to an increased level of professionalism. Road racers organized to demand that stricter safety regulations be adopted by sanctioning bodies in relation to race track safety and race organizers requirements. Race circuits that had originally been public roads were widened and modified to include chicanes and run-off areas while, some circuits were shortened to reduce the number of safety personnel required. These changes saw a dramatic decrease in deaths and accidents.

===Modern road racing on public roads===
By the 1980s, motorcycle Grand Prix and the Formula One races were held on purpose built race circuits with the exception of the Monaco Grand Prix held on the city streets of Monaco. Street circuits such as the Montjuïc circuit and the Opatija Circuit with their numerous unmovable roadside obstacles, such as trees, stone walls, lampposts and buildings, were gradually removed from world championship competition.

Although events held on closed public roads such as the Isle of Man TT, lost their world championship status due to their considerable safety risk, their popularity continued to flourish leading to a branch of road racing known as Traditional Road Racing. Traditional road racing on closed public roads is popular in the United Kingdom, New Zealand and parts of Europe. The Duke Road Racing Rankings was established in 2002 to establish rider classifications in traditional road racing events such as the North West 200 and the Ulster Grand Prix.

In Formula One, street circuits have made a comeback with the Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit and the Baku City Circuit joining the Circuit de Monaco as part of the world championship. There are no street circuits being used in MotoGP racing.. In North America, racing on public streets takes place at the Grand Prix of Long Beach, the Firestone Grand Prix of St. Petersburg, the Detroit Grand Prix, and the Honda Indy Toronto.

==Road racing proliferation==
The popularity of Formula One and motorcycle Grand Prix racing led to the formation of road racing world championships for other types of vehicles. In 1953, the FIA sanctioned a world championship for sports car racing which combined the Le Mans 24 Hours, the Mille Miglia, the 12 Hours of Sebring, the 24 Hours of Spa and the 1000km of the Nurburgring. NASCAR held its first road race in 1957 at the Watkins Glen International circuit with Buddy Baker as the winner. The FIA launched the European Touring Car Championship in 1963.

The FIA created the International Karting Commission (CIK) in 1962 and, in 1964, the first CIK Karting World Championship was won by Guido Sala. Karting has become a significant step in the development of road racers including Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton. The European Truck Racing Championship was founded in 1985. A Superbike World Championship for road-going production motorcycles was created in 1988.

As road racing grew in popularity it eventually expanded across the globe with Grand Prix road races having been held on six continents. Expansion of the Formula One and MotoGP series has resulted in many dedicated tracks being built, like in Qatar in the Middle East, Sepang in Malaysia, and Shanghai in China.

<text>Vartholomio () is a town and a former municipality in Elis, West Greece, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Pineios, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 60.696 km2. The municipal unit covers the southern part of the hilly Kyllini peninsula, and the plains to the southeast. The town Vartholomio is in the plains, on the right bank of the river Pineios, which flows into the Ionian Sea south of the town.

The town was at the junction of two railway lines, one from Kavasila to Kyllini, and the branch Vartholomio–Loutra Kyllinis railway line. Both railways have been dismantled. Vartholomio is 1 km northwest of Kalyvia Myrtountion, 4 km west of Gastouni, 3 km southwest of Dimitra, 10 km southeast of Kyllini and 30 km northwest of Pyrgos.

The town has two elementary schools and one high school building, with a standard junior high school and a music oriented junior high school (the only one in Elis). There are also two churches with yards, and a town square with cafes and tavernas. In 1988 and in 2002, two big earthquakes struck the town and most buildings were damaged, including its high school.

==Population==
==Subdivisions==
The municipal unit Vartholomio is subdivided into the following communities (constituent villages in brackets):

<doc id="685685" wikidata="Q6175573" url="?curid=685685" title="Jefferson Public Radio">
<text>Jefferson Public Radio (JPR) is a regional public radio broadcasting network serving over a million potential listeners in Southern Oregon and the Shasta Cascade region of northern California. Owned by Southern Oregon University, the network is headquartered on the SOU campus in Ashland, near Medford. It is named after the proposed State of Jefferson, an area which roughly corresponds to its vast and mostly mountainous coverage area of .

JPR&#x27;s flagship station, KSOR in Ashland, signed on in April 1969 as a 10-watt station operated by students at what was then Southern Oregon College. It began moving away from its college radio roots during the 1970s, becoming a full NPR member by the end of the decade. In the early 1980s, it began building a massive system of translators covering large portions of Oregon and California, and now claims one of the largest translator network of any public radio station in the country.

At first, KSOR was not familiar with the history of Jefferson. However, by the time KSOR began to build full-power satellites later in the decade, it realized that its service area was virtually coextensive with the State of Jefferson. It rebranded itself as &quot;Jefferson Public Radio&quot; in 1989, feeling that name was more than appropriate for its growing network and the area it served.

==Programming==
The network broadcasts local programming as well as programs from National Public Radio, Public Radio Exchange, American Public Media, and the BBC World Service among other sources.

Its programming is organized into three broadcasting services. Most listeners in the JPR service area can choose between all three services, giving them a programming choice comparable to those in far larger markets.

===Classics &amp; News===
&quot;Classics &amp; News&quot; was KSOR/JPR&#x27;s original radio service and can be heard throughout the JPR broadcast area. The service has the most translators and the most powerful signals. On weekdays the service plays NPR&#x27;s news programs &quot;Morning Edition&quot;, and &quot;All Things Considered&quot;, and local classical music programming during the midday. In the evenings, the service runs WFMT&#x27;s Beethoven Network hosted by Peter van de Graff, branded as &quot;State Farm Music Hall&quot;. For many years, it signed off from 2-5 a.m., but now airs 24 hours a day.

Ten FM stations and 28 translators make up JPR&#x27;s &quot;Classics &amp; News Service&quot;. Outside the JPR area, C &amp; N broadcasts in Mendocino on a translator.

===Rhythm &amp; News===
&quot;Rhythm &amp; News&quot; is JPR&#x27;s second oldest service, designed to complement C&amp;N while running &quot;Morning Edition&quot; and &quot;All Things Considered&quot; for a longer period. During the middle of the day, local hosts program a show called &quot;Open Air&quot; that features a unique blend of indie rock/pop, AAA, and Americana music. The evening features adult album alternative programming from &quot;World Cafe&quot; and &quot;UnderCurrents&quot;. Like &quot;Classics &amp; News&quot;, &quot;Rhythm &amp; News&quot; also signed off the air from 2-5 a.m. for many years before adopting a 24-hour schedule.

There are five FM stations and six translators broadcasting the &quot;Rhythm &amp; News&quot; service.

===News &amp; Information===
&quot;News &amp; Information&quot; is JPR&#x27;s extended news service offering JPR&#x27;s only local talk show, &quot;The Jefferson Exchange&quot;, as well as the NPR talk shows &quot;1A&quot;, &quot;Here &amp; Now&quot; and &quot;Fresh Air&quot;. It airs the BBC World Service overnights.

Eight AM stations and three FM stations carry the &quot;News &amp; Information Service&quot;.

==Expansion==

In 2004, as a response to a perceived lack of public radio programming in other cities, Jefferson Public Radio began expanding its service outside of the traditional State of Jefferson. Stations in Eugene and Mendocino were purchased for the news and information format, and the news and information station in Eureka was purchased by JPR from an owner who had programmed it with the BBC World Service 24 hours a day. The purchase of the station in Eureka was particularly controversial as it was thought that it would compete directly with Humboldt State University&#x27;s KHSU.

<text>The Seattle Gay News is a weekly newspaper aimed at the Seattle and Puget Sound area LGBT community in the U.S. state of Washington. As of 2023, the SGN is distributed to every library in the King County Library System, Seattle Public Library System, and Pierce County Library System, as well as roughly 115 other locations in Seattle, Tacoma, Bellingham, Spokane and Ocean Shores.

== History ==
The newspaper was founded in 1974 by Jim Tully and Jim Arnold. Editor George Bakan, an LGBTQ+ activist in Seattle, acted as head of the SGN from 1984 until his death from a sudden heart attack in 2020. His daughter Angela Cragin then took over his role at the paper.

In 2021, staff began restructuring the paper to improve its diversity and inclusivity. In the same year, SGN launched a podcast as part of the restructuring effort.

In 2023, Cragin sold the publication to Stratus Group LLC, owned by Mike Schultz. A year later he sold SGN to Prism Pride Press, owned by Renee Raketty.

== Archive ==
SGN files are preserved in the Washington State History Museum in Tacoma. The SGN is archived at Yale University (Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library), University of Washington (Suzzallo Library) in Seattle, the Seattle Public Library (Central Library) and the Stonewall National Museum, Archive and Library in Fort Lauderdale, FL. Microfiche copies of the archives can be found at UW and the Seattle Public Library.

The Washington State Library in partnership with the Suzzallo Library and the SGN digitized the SGN&#x27;s archive from 1974 through 2020 (although only in black &amp; white). Additionally, every issue of the SGN was scanned in full color and uploaded to Issuu.

<text>Siljan, in Dalarna in central Sweden, is Sweden&#x27;s seventh largest lake. The cumulative area of Siljan and the adjacent, smaller lakes Orsasjön and Insjön is . Siljan reaches a maximum depth of , and its surface is situated above sea level. This renders the lowest point of the basin at above sea level. The largest town on its shore is Mora.

== Impact crater ==

The lake is located around the southwestern perimeter of the Siljan Ring (Swedish: &quot;Siljansringen&quot;), a circular geological formation which was formed 377 million years ago in the Devonian by a major meteorite impact. The original crater, now mostly eroded, is estimated to have been about 52 km (32 mi) in diameter and is the largest known impact crater in Europe (excluding Russia). The Cambrian, Ordovician and Silurian sedimentary rocks deformed by the impact are rich in fossils.

Some people suspect that there might be oil in the area, but drilling has been unsuccessful so far. There are large deposits of lead and zinc in the Boda area.

== Deep drilling project ==
In the 1980&#x27;s, state-owned power company Vattenfall drilled a deep well in search of natural gas. The project began as a deep commercial wildcat well, and its unusual location in fractured granite attracted scientific attention (e.g., as potentially significant in the context of theory of abiogenic petroleum origin).
The Gravberg-1 well location, in the north-northeast section of the ring, was chosen because a gravity anomaly indicates less dense rock below, and four seismic reflectors may represent cap rock above a natural gas reservoir. Electrical resistance is lower in the ring than outside it, suggesting the rocks contain fluid. Soil in the area showed clear traces of methane and heavy hydrocarbons, with a halo around the ring coincident with vanadium and nickel trace elements; the sediment was shown to not be the source of the hydrocarbons due to their location, ice movement pattern, and low level of maturity. Although the greatest gas leakage was in the north-northwestern corner, the lack of leakage in the central area suggested an underlying cap.

Drilling began on 1 July 1986. By September 1989 it reached in depth.

Four seismic reflectors were detected at , , and . The first three were penetrated and found to be dolerite sills, but the fourth had been identified before drilling as having the best potential for gas production. The dolerite is believed to have existed as much as 1/2 billion years before the meteorite impact. The granite is extensively fractured, with calcite as the principal cement down to the depth, with lesser amounts to .

Traces of methane were found at all depths, with higher levels in dolerite. Although they appear to be of abiogenic origin, only that near the dolerite sills points to a probable mantle origin. Hydrogen was found in most sections of the hole, correlated with helium. The helium isotopic pattern was consistent with a radiogenic, crustal origin.
A black sticky substance was found to be blocking the drill pipe when circulation was stopped for several days at a depth of . The substance was black, sticky when wet, powdery when dry, showed no fluorescence, and was strongly magnetic. None of the drilling materials showed gas chromatographic patterns which corresponded with the black substance. It contained no ordinary rock minerals, none of the granite fines expected in the drilling fluid, but is made up of microscopic magnetite held together by oils.

The well did not penetrate the fourth seismic reflector, did not produce large quantities of fuel, and never entered commercial production. Only of oil were produced; it was later shown to originate from organic additives, lubricants and mud used in the drilling process.

A second hole, Stenberg-1, was drilled in the center of the ring, distant from the ring sediments and from Gravberg-1. This well went to a depth of . The hole produced gases and oily magnetite sludge similar to those found in Gravberg-1.

<text>Joan of Arc was an American indie rock band from Chicago, Illinois named after the French saint Joan of Arc. They formed in 1995, following the breakup of Cap&#x27;n Jazz.

Singer Tim Kinsella was the only permanent member of the group; he has also recorded as a solo artist.

Joan of Arc are known for their use of electronics, samples, and multi-track recording in their songs; some songs on &quot;The Gap&quot; contained over 100 tracks.

Joan of Arc&#x27;s lyrics and cover art are often intentionally misleading, humorous, or confusing. For example, the album &quot;Live in Chicago, 1999&quot; is not a live album, but a reference to the fact that the band lived in Chicago in the year 1999.

Members of Joan of Arc have been in many other bands including Friend/Enemy with Califone&#x27;s Tim Rutili; American Football with Kinsella&#x27;s brother Mike; Owls, a Cap&#x27;n Jazz reunion; Ghosts and Vodka; Everyoned, The Love of Everything, Aitis Band, Doom Flower, Hydrofoil and Make Believe.

==Biography==
===Formation/Jade Tree Records (1995-2003)===
Joan of Arc began as a band named Red Blue Yellow. They broke up after their first show, threw away all of their old material, and started afresh with new songs and a new name. Three months later, Joan of Arc had their first show at Autonomous Zone in Chicago. After two promising 7&quot; singles, the band recorded their debut album &quot;A Portable Model Of&quot; on the Jade Tree label.

&quot;A Portable Model Of&quot; introduced Joan of Arc&#x27;s signature sound: a fondness for stark acoustic songs combined with subtle electronics. The debut album also included some harder material and collaborations with former Cap&#x27;n Jazz guitarist and The Promise Ring singer Davey von Bohlen and Euphone&#x27;s Ryan Rapsys, who would later drum for Owls following the departure of Mike Kinsella.

In 1998, Joan of Arc released &quot;How Memory Works&quot;. The album included what would become a hallmark of Joan of Arc&#x27;s subsequent output: interludes of synthetic noises cut with vocal samples and off-beat instrumentation. As always, Kinsella&#x27;s lyrics were cryptic and oblique, though the song &quot;This Life Cumulative&quot; made reference to the media alienation of singer/songwriter Fiona Apple. Significant to this shift was the influence of member Jeremy Boyle, whose work with laptop and various software and hardware was a part of his broader multimedia artistic training at the University of Illinois-Chicago&#x27;s School of Art and Design.

Following the departure of Mike Kinsella, Erik Bocek, and the addition of Todd Mattei, Joan of Arc found themselves thrust unwillingly into the spotlight by the sudden success of a Jade Tree retrospective by Kinsella&#x27;s former band Cap&#x27;n Jazz. Despite being heralded as a pioneer of a diverse genre known as &#x27;emo&#x27; (a term rejected by Kinsella), Joan of Arc&#x27;s next album was a reaction to this unwelcome classification. The songs on the album were slower and contained more spacious arrangements thanks to a newly found fondness for studio trickery. The album&#x27;s artwork depicted recreated scenes from Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s 1967 film &quot;Weekend&quot;. The release of &quot;Live in Chicago&quot; also marked the increasing media perception of Joan of Arc as a &#x27;difficult&#x27; band, an impression that would dog Kinsella in particular throughout the band&#x27;s existence.

Reviews of Joan of Arc became especially negative after the release of &quot;The Gap&quot; in 2000. The Gap was the band&#x27;s first record made solely in the digital domain, and the nonlinear editing features of Pro Tools encouraged the band to expand the possibilities of what their records could sound like, editing and layering pieces of recordings in a similar manner to Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;Kid A,&quot; which was released just one day before The Gap. During the promotion of the album, Kinsella chose to &quot;flip&quot; the relationship between band and journalists by insisting on asking the questions during interviews, which likely contributed to the negative critical response. Growing tensions within the group, Jade Tree&#x27;s loss of confidence in the band, and a poorly-received follow-up EP led to Joan of Arc&#x27;s temporary breakup in May 2001.

Tim Kinsella then formed a group called Owls, a reincarnation of the original Cap&#x27;n Jazz lineup. After recording the album with Steve Albini in 2001, the departure of Mike Kinsella and Victor Villarreal led to the Owls&#x27; breakup. Left without a band once again, Tim Kinsella started working on songs for a solo album. After completing the album with help from Sam Zurick and Mike Kinsella, Tim Kinsella decided that since all three had played in Joan of Arc, it should bear the name Joan of Arc. The album, much different from the conceptual madness of &quot;The Gap&quot;, instead consisted of guitar-driven tracks with journal-like observation from Tim Kinsella. Heralded as a return to form, &quot;So Much Staying Alive And Lovelessness&quot; became the band&#x27;s last on Jade Tree.

Later that year, Joan of Arc released &quot;In Rape Fantasy and Terror Sex We Trust&quot; on Perishable Records, featured collaborations with Califone&#x27;s Tim Rutili and Ben Massarella, and was produced by Califone. Although the songs had been recorded during the same sessions as &quot; ... Lovelessness&quot;, they were darker and more collage-based. According to the website AllMusic, on &quot;In Rape Fantasy and Terror Sex We Trust,&quot; &quot;Joan of Arc ... once more surpassed themselves as artists&quot;.

=== Reformation/Polyvinyl (2004-2017) ===
To tour the albums in 2003, Tim Kinsella organized a new lineup including Bobby Burg, Nate Kinsella (Tim&#x27;s cousin) and Sam Zurick, who would also double as his side-project Make Believe. After a live album recorded in Germany and a split EP with Bundini Brown (of Tortoise and Gastr Del Sol), the band assembled a huge team of collaborators for 2004&#x27;s &quot;Joan of Arc, Dick Cheney, Mark Twain&quot; on Polyvinyl Records. This effort was largely well-regarded and a significant step forward for a new incarnation of Joan of Arc.

For the album &quot;Presents Guitar Duets,&quot; Tim Kinsella rounded up ten former members of Joan of Arc and others like Tim Rutili. Each was paired off with a partner by pulling names from a hat. Each pair then had to record a guitar duet together, and the styles vary from standard acoustic plucking to droning, looped soundscapes. The track names are identified only by the faces of the pair who play on the track.

In 2006, Joan of Arc released a compilation of rarities entitled &quot;The Intelligent Design Of...&quot; which compiles songs from singles, splits, and compilation released from the band&#x27;s career up until that point. Shortly after Joan of Arc released &quot;Eventually, All at Once&quot;, which is largely acoustic, and features members that have been involved throughout the history of Joan of Arc, which was coupled with an EP entitled &quot;Many Times I&#x27;ve Mistaken&quot;. This EP features two songs from Eventually All at Once but with full bands, and slightly differed arrangements, which continues to showcase the band&#x27;s eclectic style. In 2007 the &quot;Orchard Vale&quot; soundtrack was released, which was another experimental release for the band, and is also directed by Kinsella.

In 2008, Joan of Arc released &quot;Boo! Human&quot; on Polyvinyl Records. It is a more cohesive album than many of their others, and uses 14 musicians to help create this soundscape. The band&#x27;s next effort, &quot;Flowers&quot;, partially abandons the more straightforward songwriting from Boo Human, and favors a more experimental setting. The next two releases were in the form of &quot;Joan of Arc Presents ...&quot; which indicates an even more loose collective of people that create the album, while Tim Kinsella serves as chief instrumentalist and songwriter. One of the two, titled &quot;Don&#x27;t Mind Control&quot;, features songs from nearly every artist that is associated with Joan of Arc, and was coupled with the &quot;Don&#x27;t Mind Control&quot; showcase which featured many of the bands in a live setting.

&quot;Oh Brother&quot; featured an eclectic ensemble as well, but with the format of four nearly twenty-minute songs that form a collage of sound. In contrast to Joan of Arc&#x27;s next release, &quot;Life Like&quot;, these albums are completely different. &quot;Life Like&quot; marks a point of returning to basics of a sort, with a four-piece band, and is coupled with more regular touring than any recent incarnations of the band.

=== Joyful Noise/Dissolution (2010-2020) ===

In September 2010, Joyful Noise Recordings released a Joan of Arc 10-album complete cassette box set. Contained in this collection are the 10 full-length studio albums from Joan of Arc, beginning with 1997&#x27;s &quot;A Portable Model Of&quot; (Jade Tree) and ending with 2009&#x27;s &quot;Flowers&quot; (Polyvinyl).

Though Joan of Arc continued to release full-length LPs with Polyvinyl, Tim Kinsella began releasing his more bizarre, amorphous, experimental work through Joyful Noise Recordings, beginning in 2011 with &quot;Oh Brother&quot; described as a &quot;combination of four distinct albums embarked upon but never completed by Joan of Arc,&quot; with collaborative personnel ranging from Zach Hill (Death Grips, Hella, Face Tat), Rob Lowe (Pinback, Goblin Cock) and others in a sprawling, ambient instrumental, double-LP.

Other solo &amp; experimental work has work appearing on Joyful Noise Recordings, quickly followed including &quot;Lightbox&quot;, &quot;Joan of Arc Presents Joan of Arc&quot;, the self-titled album (known colloquially as the &#x27;Elephant Man Album&#x27;), &quot;Pinecone, Tim Kinsella Sings the Songs of Marvin Tate by Leroy Bach Featuring Angel Olsen&quot; and other projects.

Kinsella was awarded an artist residency at Joyful Noise in 2015. His residency boxed-set included the &quot;Issues EP&quot;, &quot;Firecracker in a Box of Mirrors&quot;, Joan of Arc&#x27;s Greatest Hits 7&quot;, &quot;JOA 99&quot; LP, &quot;Hunky Dory TK&quot;, and the book &quot;All Over and Over&quot;.

&quot;Hunky Dory TK&quot; was an electronic collage composed entirely of samples from David Bowie&#x27;s classic, orchestral pop album, &quot;Hunky Dory,&quot; performed as part of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago&#x27;s 2015 exhibition &quot;David Bowie Is&quot;.

In 2017, Joan of Arc released their full-length studio LP &quot;He&#x27;s Got the Whole This Land Is Your Land in His Hands&quot; on Joyful Noise Recordings. Thought provoking controversy or critical dismissal in some quarters, it is widely considered to be among JOA&#x27;s most ambitious and most nearly fully realized &quot;grand experiment.&quot;

In 2018, Joan of Arc released their 20th album, &quot;1984&quot;. Unusually for a Joan of Arc album, Melina Ausikaitis stands in for Tim Kinsella as lead vocalist. &quot;We were thinking of it as a [late period] Black Flag record, where Melina would sing a song, then the next song was a jam,&quot; said Kinsella, describing the structure and sequencing of the material appearing on the album.

In honor of the album&#x27;s release, Joyful Noise Recordings produced a version of George Orwell&#x27;s dystopian novel of the same name, &quot;Nineteen-Eighty-Four&quot;, that substituted the names of the Joan of Arc band members for all of the major characters (&quot;Winston Smith -&gt; Tim Kinsella, O&#x27;Brien -&gt; Bobby Burg, etc.&quot;) and set the story in Chicago (instead of London), posting the revision on 1984.com for a limited time.

On September 23, 2020, the band announced their final studio album titled &quot;Tim Melina Theo Bobby&quot;, which was released on December 4, 2020.

<doc id="685695" wikidata="Q171650" url="?curid=685695" title="12 Hours of Sebring">
<text>The 12 Hours of Sebring is an annual motorsport endurance race for sports cars held at Sebring International Raceway, on the site of the former Hendricks Army Airfield World War II air base in Sebring, Florida, US. In the past, this race has been a round of the now defunct World Sportscar Championship, IMSA GT Championship and American Le Mans Series. In 2012, the race was the opening event of the FIA World Endurance Championship in a one off race before being returned to the American Le Mans Series for 2013. Starting in 2014, the event became the second round of the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship.

The race is considered to be one of the three legs of the informal Triple Crown of endurance racing along with the 24 Hours of Le Mans and 24 Hours of Daytona.

==History==
The track opened in 1950 on an airfield and is a road racing course styled after those used in European Grand Prix motor racing. The first race was a six-hour race on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1950. The winning car is currently on display at the Edge Motor Museum in Memphis, Tennessee. The next race was held 14 months later as the first 12 Hours of Sebring. The race is famous for its &quot;once around the clock&quot; action, starting during the day and finishing at night. From 1953 to 1972 the 12 Hour was a round of the FIA&#x27;s premier sports car series which was contested under various names including the World Sportscar Championship and the International Championship for Makes. In the 1950s, in addition to Le Mans, Sebring was on the calendar at the same time now-legendary races such as the Mille Miglia, Targa Florio, Carrera Panamericana and the RAC Tourist Trophy were on the World Sportscar Championship calendar, such was the prestige of the Sebring race. It was also the most important American race for the European teams and drivers and was the center of European racing activity in the United States; it was the only time during the 1950s that the big European manufacturer teams and drivers came to the United States in force, bringing with them considerable international media attention—the United States Formula One Grand Prix was not run until 1959. Top drivers who competed on the European circuit in the 1950s such as Juan Manuel Fangio, Alberto Ascari, Nino Farina, Stirling Moss and Mike Hawthorn all raced at Sebring, and the 1957 Sebring 12 Hours was the only American race the 5-time world champion Fangio ever won.

In its early years, the Sebring circuit combined former airport runways with narrow two-lane service roads. The 1966 event was a turning point in Sebring history, as the facilities and the safety of the circuit were heavily criticized. Five people were killed during the race, more than in the race&#x27;s prior 15-year history combined. Bob McLean crashed while approaching the hairpin; his car rolled several times, struck a utility pole and then exploded, landing in a ditch and killing McLean. In another incident Mario Andretti in his Ferrari 365 P2 tangled with Don Wester&#x27;s Porsche 906 on the Warehouse Straight near the Webster Turns, killing four spectators and then crashing into a warehouse next to the track. Subsequent to these events, the facilities were upgraded and the circuit layout was changed, including eliminating the Webster Turns and creating the Green Park Chicane further down the track to move the straight further away from the airport warehouses. The circuit was made safer, and there have only been 4 fatalities since then—a remarkable record for a circuit of Sebring&#x27;s age.

The race is known as preparation for the 24 Hours of Le Mans, as the track&#x27;s technical layout and extremely bumpy surface, combined with south-central Florida&#x27;s perennial hot weather, is a major test of a car&#x27;s reliability. Teams planning to compete at Le Mans regard Sebring as an ideal preparation run for the prestigious French race.

In recent years, six overall victories have been achieved by the Audi R8, one fewer than the record seven wins of the Porsche 935. Tom Kristensen has won the race more times than anyone else, with six victories—in 1999–2000, 2005–2006, 2009 and in 2012.

2020 saw the race rescheduled to mid-November due to delays caused by the pandemic. It was the only season where Sebring was run twice in a season. In July, as part of restarting the season, a three-hour race was held in July with spectators. IMSA allowed spectators for this race.
Races up until 1969 began with the traditional Le Mans start procedure, which was abolished at the end of the 1969 season following Jacky Ickx protesting at Le Mans 1969; 1970 was the first 12 Hours of Sebring started with a rolling start.

==Race results==
The 1966 race had Dan Gurney leading at the last lap, when the engine of his Shelby American Ford GT40 Mk II seized near the end. Gurney pushed his car over the finish line, beaten only by Ken Miles and Lloyd Ruby. However, his actions were ultimately determined to be against the rules and he did not receive credit for his finish. 
In 2005, the Chevrolet Corvette C6.R and Aston Martin DBR9 made their race debut in the hotly contested GT1 class, with Aston Martin winning its class for the first time in 49 years at Sebring ahead of the two Corvettes. Corvette had dominated the class the past three years with its previous generation C5R.

The all-new Audi R10 TDI won the 2006 edition of the race, the car&#x27;s first ever run in competition. The much-hyped Porsche RS Spyder campaigned by Penske Racing dropped to take 2nd place in its LMP2 class, behind the Intersport Lola car. The GT1 Corvette C6R team got their revenge against the Aston Martin, although the second Corvette came within 1/3 of a second of the podium in the closing laps of the race.

2007 saw Audi again winning in the R10 TDI despite requiring more frequent refueling due to changes in American Le Mans series rules intended to even the field between gasoline and diesel-powered engines.

==Overall winners==
: The car was in fact, a Porsche 935 K3 that has been modified with a single plug cylinder head and a front nose to resemble a Porsche 934 to comply to IMSA GTO specification.
: These races were stopped for a period of time due to heavy rain and/or accidents. The race clock was not stopped for these periods and counted towards the 12 Hours.
: Race record for most distance covered.
: Technically the race &quot;winner&quot; in 1950 was the Crosley Hot Shot of Fritz Koster / Ralph Deshon, entered by Victor Sharpe Jr. of Tampa. While the Wacker / Burrell Allard did cover more distance, the race was run under the &quot;Index of Performance&quot; handicapping rules and the Crosley, with a much smaller engine than the Cadillac-powered Allard, is listed in the Official Sebring Record Book as the winner.

<text>The Laxey Wheel (also known as Lady Isabella) is built into the hillside above the village of Laxey in the Isle of Man. It is the largest surviving original working waterwheel in the world. Designed by Robert Casement, the wheel has a diameter, is wide and revolves approximately three times per minute.

==History==
The wheel was built in 1854 to pump water from the Glen Mooar part of the Great Laxey Mines industrial complex. It was named Lady Isabella after the wife of Lieutenant Governor Charles Hope, who was the island&#x27;s governor at that time.

The wheel is currently maintained by Manx National Heritage as part of the Great Laxey Wheel &amp; Mines Trail.

The wheel features today on the reverse of the £20 notes issued by the Isle of Man Government.

==Technical details==
A water-powered wheel was used because the Isle of Man has no supply of coal for a steam-powered pump.

Water from the surrounding area – including a number of local springs and streams – is collected in a cistern, which is above the level of the top of the wheel. A closed pipe connects the cistern to the top of the wheel; thus the water flows up the tower as an inverted syphon. The water falls from the pipe into the buckets (formed from wooden slats on the circumference) and makes the wheel rotate in what is described as the &#x27;reverse&#x27; direction: it is a backshot wheel. The crank has a throw of and connects to a counterweight and to a very long rod. This rod runs along the rod viaduct to the pumping shaft 200m away, where the stroke is converted by a T-rocker into a pumping action.

Most of the wheel and rod is made of wood; however key mechanical parts are metal to provide tension and bearing surfaces. The rod has wheels attached at intervals to permit the stroke&#x27;s motion with minimal friction.

===Dimensions===
* Diameter: 72 ft 6 in. (22.1 m)
* Delivery: of water a minute from the Laxey mines some away and below ground

==Mine==

The mine employed over 600 miners at its peak, producing lead, copper, silver and zinc until it closed in 1929. In 1965 the Manx Government bought the wheel and site. The wheel was restored; in 1989 it was put under the control of Manx National Heritage.

==Musical wheel==
The wheel has two pieces of music dedicated to it: one penned by Stuart Slack and the other by Helen Barley. Both are entitled &quot;The Laxey Wheel&quot;.

<doc id="685699" wikidata="Q830807" url="?curid=685699" title="Il Redentore">
<text>The Chiesa del Santissimo Redentore (), commonly known as Il Redentore, is a 16th-century Roman Catholic church located on Giudecca (island) in the &quot;sestiere&quot; of Dorsoduro, in the city of Venice, Italy.

It was designed by Italian Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio and built as a votive church to thank God for the deliverance of the city from a major outbreak of the plague. Located on the waterfront of the Canale della Giudecca, it dominates the skyline of the island of Giudecca. It is a member of the Chorus Association of Venetian churches and contains a number of paintings by artists including Tintoretto, Paolo Veronese, and Francesco Bassano.

==History==

Il Redentore was built as a votive church in thanksgiving for deliverance from a major outbreak of the plague that decimated Venice between 1575 and 1576, in which some 46,000 people (25–30% of the population) died. The Senate of the Republic of Venice commissioned the architect Andrea Palladio to design the votive church. Though the Senate wished the Church to be square plan, Palladio designed a single nave church with three chapels on either side. Its prominent position on the Canale della Giudecca gave Palladio the opportunity to design a facade inspired by the Pantheon of Rome and enhanced by being placed on a wide plinth. 15 steps were required to reach the church&#x27;s entrance, a direct reference to the Temple of Jerusalem and complicit with Palladio&#x27;s own requirement that &quot;the ascent (of the faithful) will be gradual, so that the climbing will bring more devotion&quot;.

The cornerstone was laid by the Patriarch of Venice Giovanni Trevisan on 3 May 1577 and the building was consecrated in 1592. At the urgent solicitations of Pope Gregory XIII, after consecration the church was placed in charge of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin. A small number of Friars reside in the monastery attached to the church.

Every year the doge and senators walked across a specially constructed pontoon bridge from the Zattere to Giudecca to attend Mass in the church. The Festa del Redentore remains a major festival in the Venetian calendar, celebrated on the third Sunday in July. A huge firework display on the previous evening is followed by a mass procession across the pontoon bridge.

The church was the scene of vandalism on 15–16 May 2022 after a group of three people – who were later arrested after being identified on CCTV footage – painted a three meter wide portion of the front facade of the church with pink paint as well as an equation of some sorts on top of the pink. A local tried removing the paint using water, but was unsuccessful in their efforts and only allowed the paint to permeate the stone it was displayed on. The restoration is now being handled by government art officials.

==Exterior==
Il Redentore has one of the most prominent sites of any of Palladio&#x27;s structures, and is considered one of the pinnacles of his career. It is a large, white building with a dome crowned by a statue of the Redeemer. On the façade a central triangular pediment overlies a larger, lower one. This classical feature recalls Palladio&#x27;s façade for San Francesco della Vigna, where he used an adaptation of a triumphal arch.
Palladio is known for applying rigorous geometric proportions to his façades and that of this church is no exception. The overall height is four-fifths that of its overall width whilst the width of the central portion is five-sixths of its height.

It has been suggested that there are some oriental influences in the exterior, particularly the two campanili which resemble minarets.

==Interior==
As a pilgrimage church, the building was expected to have a long nave, which was something of a challenge for Palladio with his commitment to classical architecture. The result is a somewhat eclectic building, the white stucco and gray stone interior combines the nave with a domed crossing in spaces that are clearly articulated yet unified. An uninterrupted Corinthian order makes its way around the entire interior.

===Art work===
Il Redentore contains paintings by Francesco Bassano, Lazzaro Bastiani, Carlo Saraceni, Leandro Bassano, Palma the Younger, Jacopo Bassano, Francesco Bissolo, Rocco Marconi, Paolo Veronese, Alvise Vivarini and the workshop of Tintoretto. The sacristy also contains a series of wax heads of Franciscans made in 1710.

The church was painted by Canaletto a number of times, notably in a painting currently held at Woburn Abbey, England.

<text>Depok (Sundanese: ᮓᮨᮕᮧᮊ᮪) is a landlocked city in West Java province. It is located directly south of Jakarta, it is the third largest urban centre in the Greater Jakarta metropolitan area after Jakarta and Bekasi and it has an area of 199.91 km2. It had a population of 1,738,600 at the 2010 census and 2,056,400 at the 2020 census; the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 2,145,400 (comprising 1,080,541 males and 1,064,859 females), resulting in a density of 10,731.8 people per km2. Depok was created as a separate city on 20 April 1999, having previously been part of Bogor Regency. It constitutes the second most populous suburban city in Indonesia (after Bekasi), and the tenth most populous suburban city globally.

== History ==
There are two possible origins of the name &#x27;Depok&#x27;. The first is that it the region was already known as Depok when the land was bought by Cornelis Chastelein, a senior official in the Dutch East India Company in 1696 and that on 18 May 1696, a former VOC officer Cornelis Chastelein bought land with an area of 12.44 km2, 6.2% the area of today&#x27;s Depok. Besides cultivating the area with industrial plants with the help of the locals, Chastelein was active as a missionary, preaching Christianity to the indigenous Indonesians. To this end, he established a local congregation named &quot;De Eerste Protestante Organisatie van Christenen (DEPOC)&quot;. In the 1950s, the claim that this acronym led to the modern name for Depok emerged among the community of people from Depok living in the Netherlands. An alternative explanation for the name is that it comes from the Indonesian word &quot;padepokan&quot;, meaning &#x27;shrine&#x27;, as the location had been used as a religious retreat before Chastelein&#x27;s purchase of the land.

Before his death on 28 June 1714, Chastelein had written a will that freed the slave families of Depok and gave them pieces of his land, converting slaves into landlords.
In 1714, the 12 slave families became landlords (forever as given to them with entitlement deeds of the owner Chastelien in his will) and freed men, women, and children.
The freed slaves are also referred to as the Mardijker&#x27;s – the word Merdeka meaning freedom in Bahasa Indonesia. June 28 is designated as Depokse Daag (Depok Day) by the original Depok family, and on 28 June 2014, commemorating 300 years, they formally opened a 3-meter height monument on its own land, but it was prohibited by the Government as it referred to Dutch colonialization.

The 12 original Depok family names are:

* Bacas
* Isakh
* Jacob
* Jonathans
* Joseph
* Laurens
* Leander
* Loen
* Sadokh
* Samuel
* Soedira
* Tholense
The original slave families of Depok are of Balinese, Ambonese, Buginese, Sundanese and Portuguese Indo, i.e., Mestizo and Mardijker descent. Isakh, Jacob, Jonathans, Joseph, and Samuel were family names baptized by Chastelein after the slave families converted to Protestant Christianity. The other families retained their original names and might have been (Roman Catholic) Christian already before joining Chastelein&#x27;s Protestant church. Descendants of the original Depok families with the exception of the Sadokh family, still live in Indonesia, the Netherlands, Norway, Canada and the United States.

In 1871, the colonial government gave Depok a special status allowing the area to form its own government and president. The ruling no longer stood after 1952, where the Depok presidency ceded its control of Depok to the Indonesian government except for a few areas.

During the Bersiap (Indonesian civil war and war for independence from The Netherlands) period of 1945 much of Depok was destroyed and many of its inhabitants killed by &#x27;Pemuda&#x27;. Many of the original Depok families fled for their lives from Indonesia during the Indonesian revolution and now live in the Netherlands as part of the Indo community there.

In March 1982, Depok was reclassified as an administrative city within Bogor Regency and, in 1999, as a city headed by a mayor. Then on 20 April 1999, the city of Depok was unified with some neighbouring districts of Bogor Regency to form an autonomous city of Depok (independent of the Regency) with an area of 199.91 km2. This date is commemorated as the date of the establishment of the city.

<doc id="685707" wikidata="Q2171235" url="?curid=685707" title="Cary Middlecoff">
<text>Emmett Cary Middlecoff (January 6, 1921 – September 1, 1998) was an American professional golfer on the PGA Tour from 1947 to 1961. His 39 Tour wins place him tied for tenth all-time, and he won three major championships. Middlecoff graduated as a dentist, but gave up his practice at age 26 to become a full-time Tour golfer.

==Early life and amateur career==
Middlecoff was born January 6, 1921, in Halls, Tennessee. He graduated from Christian Brothers High School. He played collegiate golf at the University of Mississippi, becoming that school&#x27;s first golf All-American in 1939. First as an undergraduate and active member of Kappa Alpha Order, then as a dental student at the University of Tennessee, Middlecoff won the Tennessee State Amateur Championship for four straight years (1940–1943). After obtaining his Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS) degree in 1944, he entered the United States Army Dental Corps during World War II. He won a PGA Tour tournament as an amateur in 1945

==Professional career==
In 1947, Middlecoff turned professional. He was selected for the 1947 Walker Cup team but immediately withdrew as he intended turning professional.

During his playing career, Middlecoff won 39 PGA Tour tournaments, including the 1955 Masters and U.S. Open titles in 1949 and 1956. He won the Vardon Trophy for lowest scoring average in 1956.

Middlecoff played on three Ryder Cup teams: 1953, 1955, and 1959 – the U.S. teams won all three times. He was ineligible for the 1957 Ryder Cup because he failed to play in the PGA Championship that year. Middlecoff was disappointed to lose a playoff in the 1957 U.S. Open to Dick Mayer, and played very few events following that event. The U.S. lost the Cup in 1957, for the first time since 1933.

Middlecoff&#x27;s three best seasons were 1949, 1951 and 1956, as he won six tour titles in each of those years. He won at least one tour tournament in 13 of his 15 seasons, missing only in 1957 and 1960.

During the decade of the 1950s, Middlecoff won 28 tour titles, more than any other player during that span. A tall player with plenty of power and very good accuracy, Middlecoff during his best years was also a superb putter. He was known for often taking excessive time to play his shots.

Back problems and struggles with his nerves during competition ended his career in the early 1960s, when he was in his early 40s, although he continued to play occasionally, competing in the Masters until 1971, as a past champion.

Middlecoff became a top player despite having one leg slightly shorter than the other.

He appeared in two motion pictures as himself (&quot;Follow the Sun&quot; (1951, about the life and career of Ben Hogan) and &quot;The Bellboy&quot; (1960)). He wrote a newspaper column, &quot;The Golf Doctor.&quot; He also appeared in a short biographical sports documentary &quot;Golf Doctor&quot; (1947).

Middlecoff later developed a reputation as one of the best of the early golf television commentators. After retiring from the tour, he spent 18 years as a golf analyst for television.

==Death==
Middlecoff died of heart disease in 1998 in Memphis, Tennessee. He was survived by his wife of 51 years, Edith.

==Awards and honors==
* In 1956, Middlecoff earned the Vardon Trophy, the honor bestowed to the player with the lowest average score over the course of the season.
* In 1986, Middlecoff was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame.

<text>Barbet Schroeder (born 26 August 1941) is an Iranian-born Swiss film director and producer who started his career in French cinema in the 1960s, working with directors of the French New Wave such as Jean-Luc Godard, Jacques Rivette and Eric Rohmer.

Schroeder started his career producing such films as &quot;The Bakery Girl of Monceau&quot; (1962), &quot;Six in Paris&quot; (1965), and &quot;Celine and Julie Go Boating&quot; (1974). He then transitioned into directing films such as &quot;More&quot; (1969), &quot;La Vallée&quot; (1972) and &quot;Barfly&quot; (1987), the last of which was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or. He also gained recognition for directing the documentary &quot;&quot; (1978). He directed what he labeled, &quot;The Trilogy of Evil&quot;, which includes the films, &quot;General Idi Amin Dada: A Self Portrait&quot; (1974), &quot;Terror&#x27;s Advocate&quot; (2007) and &quot;The Venerable W.&quot; (2016).

He directed the drama &quot;Reversal of Fortune&quot; (1990) and earned a nomination for Academy Award for Best Director. He then directed many big budget Hollywood films, often mixing melodrama with the thriller genre in films like &quot;Single White Female&quot; (1992), &quot;Kiss of Death&quot; (1995), &quot;Desperate Measures&quot; (1998) and &quot;Murder by Numbers&quot; (2002). He also acted in &quot;Beverly Hills Cop III&quot; (1994), &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot; (1996) and &quot;The Darjeeling Limited&quot; (2007).

==Early life and education ==
Schroeder was born in Tehran, Iran, the son of Ursula, a German physician, and Jean-William Schroeder, a Swiss geologist. From ages 6 to 11, he lived in Colombia where his father worked. Both he and his family then left for France, where he studied at the Sorbonne in Paris.

== Career ==
Schroeder&#x27;s production company Les Films du Losange, founded by him at age 23, produced some of the best-known films of the French New Wave. His directorial debut, &quot;More&quot; (1969), about heroin addiction, became a hit in Europe. Pink Floyd wrote music for this movie and released the album, &quot;More&quot;. They also wrote the soundtrack for his 1972 film &quot;La Vallée&quot;, released as the album &quot;Obscured by Clouds&quot;.

He later went on to direct more mainstream Hollywood fare, such as &quot;Barfly&quot; (1987) starring Mickey Rourke, &quot;Single White Female&quot; (1992) and &quot;Reversal of Fortune&quot; (1990), for which Jeremy Irons as Claus von Bülow received an Academy Award. Despite his many commercially successful films, Schroeder continues to be interested in making smaller films with a more limited audience, such as the adaptation of Colombian writer Fernando Vallejo&#x27;s controversial novel &quot;La virgen de los sicarios&quot; (2000) or the documentary &quot;General Idi Amin Dada: A Self Portrait&quot; (1974), featuring extensive interviews with the Ugandan dictator and &quot;Terror&#x27;s Advocate&quot; (2007) about terrorism in the last fifty years, seen through the eyes of a lawyer, Jacques Vergès, and his clients.

Schroeder has also made some appearances as an actor: playing one of the &#x27;ghosts&#x27; in Jacques Rivette&#x27;s &quot;Céline et Julie vont en bateau&quot; (&quot;Céline and Julie Go Boating&quot;), a cameo as a Porsche driver in &quot;Beverly Hills Cop III&quot; (1994), as the President of France in &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot; (1996), as a hair products salesman in &quot;Paris, je t&#x27;aime&quot; (2006) and as the mechanic in &quot;The Darjeeling Limited&quot; (2007). Today, he resides in France and is married to actress Bulle Ogier.

In 2009, Schroeder signed a petition in support of film director Roman Polanski, calling for his release after Polanski was arrested in Switzerland in relation to his 1977 charge for drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl.

Schroeder directed the 12th episode of the third season of the American dramatic television series &quot;Mad Men&quot; that first aired on 1 November 2009. The episode was entitled &quot;The Grown Ups&quot;, and was notable for its depiction of the events of the Kennedy assassination.

<text>The Golden Age is a 1993 four-issue &quot;Elseworlds&quot; comic book mini-series by writer James Robinson and artist Paul Smith. It concerns the Golden Age DC Comics superheroes entering the 1950s and facing the advent of McCarthyism.

==Plot==
The series opens by showing how various Golden Age heroes have adjusted to life after World War II. The members of the Justice Society of America and All-Star Squadron have mostly retired. Tex Thompson, formerly known as the Americommando and Mr. America, has returned from Europe a war hero and has used his fame to start a political career, resulting in him being elected a senator. He then recruits several former heroes to create a new group of heroes for the 1950s. The group includes Robotman (who is slowly losing touch with his humanity), the Atom and Johnny Thunder (who are both looking for somewhere to belong), and Dan the Dyna-Mite (Daniel Dunbar), who is lost after the death of his mentor TNT. Thompson oversees various experiments on Dunbar which change him into the incredibly powerful Dynaman.

Other retired heroes are suffering from their own problems. The McCarthy hearings have resulted in Green Lantern being blacklisted due to his job as the head of a media corporation. Johnny Quick and Liberty Belle were married and eventually divorced. Quick is now a television reporter while Belle is dating journalist John Law (formerly the Tarantula). Starman has suffered a nervous breakdown after realizing that his research into cosmic energy helped in the development of the atom bomb. Captain Triumph (Lance Gallant) has retired and is trying to lead a normal life, despite his twin brother Michael&#x27;s ghost urging him to become a hero again. Hourman is fighting his addiction to the Miraclo pill that gives him his powers.

The hero Manhunter (Paul Kirk), who has also returned from Europe, is suffering from memory loss and being hunted by strange men. He meets up with Thompson&#x27;s former sidekick from his Mr. America days, Bob Daley AKA Fatman, and hides out while coming to terms with his demons. Eventually, the two of them seek the help of Hawkman, who helps Manhunter regain his memories. Those memories reveal a dark secret about Thompson: during the final days of the war, the super-villain known as the Ultra-Humanite, who worked as one of Hitler&#x27;s scientists at Dachau, transferred his brain into Thompson&#x27;s body.

While Manhunter is recovering his memories, Thompson&#x27;s aide and lover Joan Dale, the former Miss America discovers his personal diary. Concerned with Thompson and Dunbar&#x27;s increasingly strange behavior, she enlists former thief Paula Brooks, also known as the Tigress, to pick the lock and open the diary. The two of them, along with Gallant (whom Brooks was dating), discover not only that Thompson is actually the Ultra-Humanite, but also that he had performed another brain swap, that of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s brain into Dunbar&#x27;s body. They call Johnny Quick to inform him about the contents of the diary at about the same time Carter Hall calls him about Manhunter&#x27;s revelations. This sets the stage for an explosive and tragic final showdown in Washington, D.C.

As Miss America attempts to reveal the truth about Tex Thompson and Dynaman before the assembled heroes, she is murdered by Robotman, who knew but didn&#x27;t care about Tex and Dynaman&#x27;s secrets. The Atom is finally convinced by Hourman that Tex and Dynaman are evil. Johnny Thunder, still brainwashed by Thompson&#x27;s &quot;dream&quot; and blinded by his desire to belong somewhere, orders Yz, his thunderbolt, to kill Hourman. Yz attempts to obey the command but is so torn between his duties to his master and his own moral standards that he suffers a breakdown and flies, screaming, into the heavens (presumably forever) leaving Thunder guilt-ridden. Dynaman admits the truth about himself and proceeds to kill several heroes, including Tarantula, Human Bomb, Sportsmaster (a reformed villain), Doll Man and Red Bee, as well as disabling Doctor Mid-Nite by destroying his goggles and Hawkman by tearing off his wings. Thompson battles Manhunter, who snaps Thompson&#x27;s neck after both of them fall out of a window. Lance Gallant and Robotman fight and kill each other. Dynaman is killed when Liberty Belle rams what is left of Starman&#x27;s cosmic rod through his chest. She is able to do this after Dynaman is distracted by Adam Blake AKA Captain Comet, a young hero who joins the others in the fighting.

Despite numerous injuries and deaths, the heroes are triumphant. The last pages show Manhunter recovering and returning to Africa (he disappeared in 1951); Paula returns to a life of crime after being driven over the edge at witnessing Lance&#x27;s death; Ted Knight recovers and marries; Al Pratt grows more mature after the incident, in contrast to Johnny Thunder who &quot;never changed&quot;, and Johnny Quick and Liberty Belle reconcile. Meanwhile, a new generation of superheroes, led by Captain Comet, is born and Quick looks forward to &quot;a new age, as pure as sterling silver&quot;. The last page is a splash page showing Captain Comet and various other Silver Age heroes including Martian Manhunter (hovering behind his human identity John Jones), the Challengers of the Unknown, the Doom Patrol, Green Arrow, Elongated Man, Aquaman, Adam Strange, Animal Man, The Creeper, and Metamorpho, as well as successors such as Hal Jordan (Alan Scott&#x27;s successor as Green Lantern), Ray Palmer (Al Pratt&#x27;s successor as The Atom), Cliff Steele (Robert Crane&#x27;s successor as Robotman and a member of the Doom Patrol), and Barry Allen (Jay Garrick&#x27;s successor as The Flash).

==Continuity==
&quot;The Golden Age&quot; takes place outside normal DC universe continuity and is labeled as an &quot;Elseworlds&quot;. Despite this, writer James Robinson incorporated elements of the series into his &quot;Starman&quot; series. Additionally, some elements of the mini-series were used by writer Geoff Johns in a &quot;JSA&quot; story arc, bringing some elements of this story into continuity (including Starman helping to develop the atom bomb, the McCarthy hearings blacklisting the JSA — though a variation of this previously appeared in the final issue of the Justice Society&#x27;s run in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; in 1979). The most notable elements that are out of continuity are the fates of Dan the Dyna-Mite (who in DC continuity became a member of &quot;Old Justice&quot;, a team that fought Young Justice), Tarantula (who has appeared in the pages of &quot;Nightwing&quot;), Robotman, who was not destroyed in the 1950s but spent two decades in suspended animation before having his human brain transplanted into the preserved body of his former assistant Chuck Grayson, and Miss America (who appears in &quot;Freedom Fighters&quot; series).

==Collected editions==
The series was collected as a trade paperback () in 1995. A new printing of this trade paperback was published in 2005, with the book retitled as &quot;JSA: The Golden Age&quot; ().

==Critical reception and awards==
Writer Geoff Johns credits James Robinson&#x27;s work on this book for igniting his love for the characters in it, and for his decision to accept writing duties on &quot;JSA&quot; in 2000.

<doc id="685714" wikidata="Q1265983" url="?curid=685714" title="Dark state">
<text>In atomic physics, a dark state refers to a state of an atom or molecule that cannot absorb (or emit) photons. All atoms and molecules are described by quantum states; different states can have different energies and a system can make a transition from one energy level to another by emitting or absorbing one or more photons. However, not all transitions between arbitrary states are allowed. A state that cannot absorb an incident photon is called a dark state. This can occur in experiments using laser light to induce transitions between energy levels, when atoms can spontaneously decay into a state that is not coupled to any other level by the laser light, preventing the atom from absorbing or emitting light from that state. 

A dark state can also be the result of quantum interference in a three-level system, when an atom is in a coherent superposition of two states, both of which are coupled by lasers at the right frequency to a third state. With the system in a particular superposition of the two states, the system can be made dark to both lasers as the probability of absorbing a photon goes to 0.

==Two-level systems==
===In practice===
Experiments in atomic physics are often done with a laser of a specific frequency formula_1 (meaning the photons have a specific energy), so they only couple one set of states with a particular energy formula_2 to another set of states with an energy formula_3. However, the atom can still decay spontaneously into a third state by emitting a photon of a different frequency. The new state with energy formula_4 of the atom no longer interacts with the laser simply because no photons of the right frequency are present to induce a transition to a different level. In practice, the term dark state is often used for a state that is not accessible by the specific laser in use even though transitions from this state are in principle allowed.

===In theory===
Whether or not we say a transition between a state formula_5 and a state formula_6 is allowed often depends on how detailed the model is that we use for the atom-light interaction. From a particular model follow a set of selection rules that determine which transitions are allowed and which are not. Often these selection rules can be boiled down to conservation of angular momentum (the photon has angular momentum). In most cases we only consider an atom interacting with the electric dipole field of the photon. Then some transitions are not allowed at all, others are only allowed for photons of a certain polarization. 
Consider for example the hydrogen atom. The transition from the state formula_7 with &quot;mj=-1/2&quot; to the state formula_8 with &quot;mj=-1/2&quot; is only allowed for light with polarization along the z axis (quantization axis) of the atom. The state formula_8 with &quot;mj=-1/2&quot; therefore appears dark for light of other polarizations.
Transitions from the &quot;2S&quot; level to the &quot;1S&quot; level are not allowed at all. The &quot;2S&quot; state can not decay to the ground state by emitting a single photon. It can only decay by collisions with other atoms or by emitting multiple photons. Since these events are rare, the atom can remain in this excited state for a very long time, such an excited state is called a metastable state.

==Three-level systems==

We start with a three-state Λ-type system, where formula_10 and formula_11 are dipole-allowed transitions and formula_12 is forbidden. In the rotating wave approximation, the semi-classical Hamiltonian is given by
:formula_13
with
:formula_14
:formula_15
where formula_16 and formula_17 are the Rabi frequencies of the probe field (of frequency formula_18) and the coupling field (of frequency formula_19) in resonance with the transition frequencies formula_20 and formula_21, respectively, and H.c. stands for the Hermitian conjugate of the entire expression. We will write the atomic wave function as
:formula_22
Solving the Schrödinger equation formula_23, we obtain the solutions
formula_24

formula_25

formula_26

Using the initial condition
:formula_27
we can solve these equations to obtain
:formula_28

:formula_29

:formula_30

with formula_31. We observe that we can choose the initial conditions
:formula_32
which gives a time-independent solution to these equations with no probability of the system being in state formula_33. This state can also be expressed in terms of a mixing angle formula_34 as
:formula_35
with
:formula_36

This means that when the atoms are in this state, they will stay in this state indefinitely. This is a dark state, because it can not absorb or emit any photons from the applied fields. It is, therefore, effectively transparent to the probe laser, even when the laser is exactly resonant with the transition. Spontaneous emission from formula_33 can result in an atom being in this dark state or another coherent state, known as a bright state. Therefore, in a collection of atoms, over time, decay into the dark state will inevitably result in the system being &quot;trapped&quot; coherently in that state, a phenomenon known as &quot;coherent population trapping&quot;.

<doc id="685715" wikidata="Q2720825" url="?curid=685715" title="Michael Oliver (actor)">
<text>Michael Joshua Oliverius (born October 10, 1981) is an American former child actor better known by his stage name Michael Oliver.

Oliver is best known for his role as &quot;Junior&quot; in the movie &quot;Problem Child&quot; and its sequel &quot;Problem Child 2&quot;. He also played Sam Dalton In &quot;Dillinger and Capone&quot; in 1995.

==Early life and career==
Born in Los Angeles, California, Oliver&#x27;s career started at the age of 2. His first job was as a model in a Sears catalog. At age 6, he appeared in a Chevron commercial where he wore glasses and had his voice dubbed over. After seeing Oliver in the Chevron commercial, a casting agent for the film &quot;Problem Child&quot; tracked Oliver down and cast him in the role days later.

When &quot;Problem Child&quot; was released in 1990, Oliver&#x27;s appearance reminded people of a young Ron Howard as &quot;Opie Taylor&quot; in the &quot;Andy Griffith Show&quot;. It became a &quot;surprise hit,&quot; spawned two sequels and an animated series. &quot;Problem Child 2&quot; followed in 1991; however, the script was considered not in par with the original and repeatedly resorted to adult language, thus limiting the film&#x27;s overall appeal. Michael Oliver retired from acting when he was 15. In 2015, it was reported that Oliver was happy with his private life away from the celebrity scene and had said he was enjoying &quot;a nice, quiet existence&quot; although he expressed he was grateful for the time he had spent in the spotlight as a child star.

On a 2011 episode of the radio show &quot;Loveline&quot;, Oliver called in while former co-star Gilbert Gottfried was guest hosting. On the 20th anniversary of both &quot;Problem Child&quot; and &quot;Problem Child 2&quot;, it was the first time the two actors have spoken to each other since 1991.

In 2022, after being married since 2016 and separated since 2019, Oliver filed for a divorce from his ex-wife Magnolia Ponce citing irreconcilable differences.

==Lawsuit with Universal Pictures==
After completion of &quot;Problem Child 2&quot;, Universal Pictures sued Oliver&#x27;s manager-mother Dianne Ponce for extorting his acting contract with the studio. Universal Pictures stated that, on the eve of filming, Ponce threatened to remove her son from production unless his payment for the film was raised from $80,000 to $500,000.

A Superior Court jury ruled that the contract was unenforceable, Universal Pictures having entered into it under duress, and that Ponce and Oliver were obliged to return the difference between the $250,000 Universal had thus far paid and the $80,000 originally negotiated.

<doc id="685717" wikidata="Q158142" url="?curid=685717" title="St Patrick's Isle">
<text>St Patrick&#x27;s Isle () is a small tidal island on the west coast of the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea, largely occupied by the ruins of Peel Castle and of the Pre-Reformation Cathedral of the Diocese of the Isles.

==History==

Archeological studies have shown permanent occupation on St Patrick&#x27;s Isle dating to the Late Bronze Age. The ruins on St Patrick&#x27;s Isle include St Patrick&#x27;s Church and an Irish-style round tower, the former St German&#x27;s Cathedral, and the more recent residence of the Lords of Mann. 
St Patrick&#x27;s Isle is of significant importance to the history of the Celtic Church and the Catholic Church in Scotland. This is because, prior to the Protestant Reformation, the now ruined St Germanus of Man&#x27;s Cathedral was the headquarters of the Diocese of the Isles, which in its full form included the Outer Hebrides, most of the Inner Hebrides (including Iona, Skye, Raasay, Canna, Eigg, Coll, Tiree, Mull, Colonsay, Islay, Jura, Gigha – but not Lismore, Kerrera, Seil or Luing, all under the Bishop of Argyll), the Isle of Bute and the Isle of Arran. The Diocese may have originally contained Galloway, a suggestion thought to explain the possible attacks of Wimund on Bishop Gilla Aldan of Whithorn.

The ancient cathedral, however, was left to decay in the 18th century, never to be rebuilt. The island&#x27;s steep and rocky edges made it an ideal defensive outpost. It is said to be the place where St Patrick first set foot in the Isle of Man in 444 while returning from Liverpool to Ireland. Having established Christianity, he then appointed St Germanus of Man bishop, to oversee further development of the Church. However, there is debate as to whether the name &quot;St Patrick&#x27;s Isle&quot; pre-dates the thirteenth century.

The islet is now a tourist site with the castle walls running close to the shoreline. There is a public walk around the outside of the castle, which lines the coastal edge of the islet. It is connected to the town of Peel on the Isle of Man by a causeway over Fenella Beach, named after the character in Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;Peveril of the Peak&quot;. In addition to the historic ruins, the island is partially a sealife sanctuary.

St. Patrick&#x27;s Isle was originally referred to as (or ) in Manx.

<text>The Last Tycoon is a 1976 American period romantic drama film directed by Elia Kazan and produced by Sam Spiegel, based upon Harold Pinter&#x27;s screenplay adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s unfinished novel &quot;The Last Tycoon&quot;. It stars Robert De Niro, Tony Curtis, Robert Mitchum, Jack Nicholson, Donald Pleasence, Jeanne Moreau, Theresa Russell and Ingrid Boulting.

The film was the second collaboration between Kazan and Spiegel, who worked closely together to make &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;. Fitzgerald based the novel&#x27;s protagonist, Monroe Stahr, on film producer Irving Thalberg. Spiegel was once awarded the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award.

&quot;The Last Tycoon&quot; did not receive the critical acclaim that much of Kazan&#x27;s earlier work received, considering the level of talent involved, but it was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Art Direction (Gene Callahan, Jack T. Collis, and Jerry Wunderlich).

The story itself was Fitzgerald&#x27;s last, unfinished novel, as well as the last film Kazan directed, even though he lived until 2003.

==Plot==
Monroe Stahr is the young production chief and the most creative executive of one of the biggest studios of the Golden Age of Hollywood. He is a tireless worker in a time of turmoil in the industry due to the creation of the Writers Guild of America; Monroe is accustomed to making his underlings, including screenwriters, do whatever he says.

Monroe&#x27;s life flows between film shootings, industry bosses&#x27; machinations, discussions with writers and actors and a battle with a union organizer named Brimmer, whose intrusion he resents. In the meantime, Monroe becomes obsessed with a young woman with a troubled past, Kathleen Moore, who is engaged to be married to another man. Cecilia Brady, the young daughter of a studio board member, tries in vain to make Monroe see how she truly feels about him.

Pat Brady and other studio executives resent Monroe&#x27;s neglect and disrespect for their wishes. Seeing his treatment of the union organizer as the last straw, they insist that Monroe go away for a long rest. As his difficulties grow bigger and his health declines, Monroe&#x27;s life runs to an uncertain but inevitable twilight that echoes a long gone era.

==Cast==
==Themes==
The character Monroe Stahr is full of associations to Irving Thalberg, the production chief at M-G-M in the period between the late 1920s and 1930s. The background is Hollywood in the Golden Thirties, when studios made 30 to 40 productions a year and every backlot could simultaneously sustain motion pictures being set in multiple locations around the world such as New York City, Africa, the South Pole and Montmartre. The background of the film has a close bond to stories of Hollywood at that time, as well as to Fitzgerald&#x27;s own life and career.

The theme of unfinished ambitions and the unattained love of the young and beautiful in Hollywood, embodied by the beach house, have great significance for both the Novelist and Director at the end of their luminary careers.

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; writes:
==Reception==

<doc id="685721" wikidata="Q2400146" url="?curid=685721" title="Teen Wolf Too">
<text>Teen Wolf Too is a 1987 American fantasy comedy film directed by Christopher Leitch, from a script written by R. Timothy Kring. It is the sequel to &quot;Teen Wolf&quot; (1985), and second installment overall in the &quot;Teen Wolf&quot; franchise. Starring in his feature film debut, Jason Bateman stars as the cousin to Michael J. Fox&#x27;s character from the first installment. James Hampton, John Astin and Kim Darby feature in supporting roles.

==Plot==
Todd Howard, the cousin of Scott Howard, has recently been accepted into Hamilton University on a full athletic scholarship on the recommendation of Coach Bobby Finstock, who was Scott&#x27;s basketball coach at Beacontown High. Finstock&#x27;s hope is that Todd has the family genes to become a werewolf and turn his new struggling boxing team into championship contenders.

Having never been very good at sports, and because he is more interested in being a veterinarian, Todd is certain that Finstock has the wrong guy. During a meet and greet reception of school alumni, he has his first &quot;wolf-out&quot; while dancing with a seductive hostess.

At first, Todd is horrified by his &quot;family affliction&quot;, and fellow students begin to harass him. Then, during his first boxing match, after nearly getting knocked out, Todd has his second &quot;wolf-out&quot; only this time he is able to display his supernatural agility and strength and has a dramatic come from behind victory, thus earning the admiration of the students as well as the strict Dean Dunn.

With his newfound fame comes girls, top grades and even a car from the dean but as the year goes on, Todd realizes that he is losing his friends and self-respect. He seeks advice from his uncle, Scott&#x27;s father, Harold Howard, who helps him come to terms with his responsibilities and prepares him for the championship. Todd also reconnects with his girlfriend, Nicki, who helps him regain his focus on being humble.

Todd then decides that he will fight his championship match against Steve &quot;Gus&quot; Gustavson, who he had prior issues with, as himself rather than the wolf much to the dismay of all except his uncle, girlfriend and Professor Tanya Brooks (Kim Darby). Brooks, who unbeknownst to Todd is also a werewolf, intimidates Dean Dunn with glowing red eyes, growling, and swaying her tail.

After losing round after round, and nearly getting knocked out, Todd is tempted to become the wolf until he sees Nicki mouth the words &quot;I love you&quot; to him. This gives him the strength to overcome Gus and knocks him out to a roaring ovation.

==Cast==
==Production==
James Hampton and Mark Holton are the only actors to reprise their roles from &quot;Teen Wolf&quot; (1985), as Harold Howard and Chubby respectively. The characters of Coach Finstock and Stiles returned for the sequel, but were re-cast with Paul Sand as Finstock and Stuart Fratkin as Stiles. Fratkin has claimed the character he played is not the same Stiles played by Jerry Levine in the first &quot;Teen Wolf&quot;: &quot;I maintain they are different family members. The Stiles from &quot;Teen Wolf&quot; is called Rupert “Stiles” Stilinsky and my character from &quot;Teen Wolf Too&quot; is Ridley “Stiles” Stilinsky. Look it up.&quot; Principal photography began in June 1987 and shot on location at Claremont Colleges in Claremont, California.

==Reception==
&quot;Teen Wolf Too&quot; received near-universally negative reviews from critics. The film holds an 8% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 24 reviews. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Aiming for the low bar set by its predecessor and never coming close to clearing it, &quot;Teen Wolf Too&quot; is an unfunny sequel whose bark is just as awful as its bite.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has an 8 out of 100 rating based on 5 critics, indicating &quot;overwhelming dislike&quot;.

On their show, Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert specifically gave the film two emphatic thumbs down, with Ebert complaining that they had picked, along with &quot;Date with an Angel&quot;, the two worst films possible to be released on the same day.

<text>Germinal Pierre Dandelin (; , 12 April 1794 – 15 February 1847) was a French mathematician, soldier, and professor of engineering.

==Life==
He was born near Paris to a French father and Belgian mother, studying first at Ghent then returning to Paris to study at the École Polytechnique. He was wounded fighting under Napoleon. He worked for the Ministry of the Interior under Lazare Carnot. Later he became a citizen of the Netherlands, a professor of mining engineering in Belgium, and then a member of the Belgian army.

==Work==
He is the eponym of the Dandelin spheres, of Dandelin&#x27;s theorem in geometry (for an account of that theorem, see Dandelin spheres), and of the Dandelin–Gräffe numerical method of solution of algebraic equations. He also published on the stereographic projection, algebra, and probability theory.

<text>Peel Castle (&quot;Cashtal Phurt ny h-Inshey&quot; in Manx Gaelic) is a castle in Peel in the Isle of Man, originally constructed by Norwegians. The castle stands on St Patrick&#x27;s Isle, which is connected to the town by a causeway. It is now owned by Manx National Heritage and is open to visitors during the summer.

The castle was built in the 11th century by Norwegians, under the rule of King Magnus Barefoot. While there were older stone Celtic monastic buildings on the island, the first Norwegian fortifications were built of wood. The prominent round tower was originally part of the Celtic monastery, but had battlements added at a later date. In the early 14th century, the majority of the walls and towers were built primarily from local red sandstone, which is found abundantly in the area. After the rule of Norway, the castle continued to be used by the Church due to the cathedral built there – the see of the diocese of Sodor and Man – but was eventually abandoned in the 18th century.

The castle remained fortified, and new defensive positions were added as late as 1860. The buildings within the castle are now mostly ruined, but the outer walls remain intact. Excavations in 1982–87 revealed an extensive graveyard as well as the remains of Magnus Barefoot&#x27;s original wooden fort. The most spectacular finds were the 10th century grave of &quot;The Pagan Lady&quot; which included a fine example of a Norwegian necklace and a cache of silver coins dating from about 1030. The castle&#x27;s most famous &quot;resident&quot; is the so-called &quot;Moddey Dhoo&quot; or &quot;Black Dog&quot; ghost.

Peel Castle features today on the reverse side of the £10 banknotes issued by the Isle of Man Government.

Peel Castle may occasionally be confused with Piel Castle, located on Piel Island, to the east across the Irish Sea. This particularly occurs in reference to the William Wordsworth poem describing Piel, spelling its name as &#x27;Peele&#x27;: especially as Wordsworth is documented as having visited Peel Castle, and wrote several times about the Isle of Man.

Peel Castle has been proposed as a possible location of the Arthurian Avalon.

==Cathedral of St German (ruins)==
The cathedral ruins located within the walls of Peel Castle are those of the former Cathedral of St German. Like the structures throughout the castle grounds, the cathedral&#x27;s roof is completely missing. Robert Anderson examined the ruins to determine what repairs were required to restore the cathedral, and he reported to the island&#x27;s Lieutenant Governor in 1877. However, none of the suggested repairs were carried out.

There is a pointed barrel-vaulted crypt below the chancel, measuring 34 feet by 16 feet by 9 feet high at the west end (10 × 5 × 3 metres), sloping to the entrance at the east.

In the middle of the transept is the tomb where Bishop Rutter was interred in 1661.

There is a cemetery in what was once the cathedral&#x27;s nave.

In 1980 the parish of German, part of the Church of England&#x27;s Diocese of Sodor and Man, was officially transferred to the newer Cathedral Church of St German on Albany Road in Peel.

<doc id="685742" wikidata="Q794876" url="?curid=685742" title="San Zaccaria, Venice">
<text>The Church of San Zaccaria is a 15th-century former monastic church in central Venice, Italy. It is a large edifice, located in the Campo San Zaccaria, just off the waterfront to the southeast of Piazza San Marco and St Mark&#x27;s Basilica. It is dedicated to St. Zechariah, the father of John the Baptist.

==History==

The first church on the site was founded by Doge Giustiniano Participazio in the early 9th century to house the body of the saint to which it is dedicated, a gift of the Byzantine Emperor Leo V the Armenian, which it contains under the second altar on the right. The remains of various doges are buried in the crypt of the church. The original church was rebuilt in the 1170s (when the present campanile was built) and was replaced by a Gothic church in the 15th century. The remains of this building still stand, as the present church was built beside and not over it.

The present church was built between 1458 and 1515. Antonio Gambello was the original architect, who started the building in the Gothic style, but the upper part of the facade with its arched windows and its columns, and the upper parts of the interior were completed by Mauro Codussi in early Renaissance style many years later. The facade is a harmonious Venetian mixture of late-Gothic and Renaissance styles.

==Monastery==

The church was originally attached to a Benedictine monastery of nuns also founded by Participazio and various other doges of the family. The nuns of this monastery mostly came from prominent noble families of the city and had a reputation for laxness in their observance of the monastic enclosure. The abbess was usually related to the doge.

In 855, Pope Benedict III took refuge in the monastery while fleeing the violence of the Antipope Anastasius, whose election his supporters had challenged. Out of gratitude, Pope Benedict gave the nuns a large collection of relics which was the foundation of a large collection for which the monastery was famed, among which were those of Athanasius of Alexandria and a piece of the True Cross.

A devastating fire destroyed the entire monastic complex in 1105. According to chronicles of the time, some one hundred nuns who had taken refuge in the cellars of the monastery died from smoke inhalation.

Under the direction of Enrico Dandolo, the convent was reformed into a Cluniac house.

The monastery had the tradition of being visited by the doge and his entire court annually at Easter in a ceremony which included presentation of the &quot;corno ducale&quot; (ducal cap), insignia of his office. This tradition is said to have begun in the 12th century after the nuns had donated land for the building of a ducal chapel, now St Mark&#x27;s Basilica, and ended only in 1797, at the end of the Republic, when the monastery was suppressed by the invading forces of Napoleon&#x27;s army.

==Interior==
The interior of the church has an apse surrounded by an ambulatory lit by tall Gothic windows, a typical feature of Northern European church architecture which is unique in Venice. Nearly every wall is covered with paintings by 17th and 18th century artists. The church houses one of the most famous works by Giovanni Bellini, the San Zaccaria Altarpiece. The walls of the aisles and of the chapels host paintings by other artists including Andrea del Castagno, Palma Vecchio, Tintoretto, Giuseppe Porta, Palma il Giovane, Antonio Vassilacchi, Anthony van Dyck, Andrea Celesti, Antonio Zanchi, Antonio Balestra, Angelo Trevisani and Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo.

The artist Alessandro Vittoria is buried in the church, his tomb marked by a self-portrait bust.

The organ of the church was built by Gaetano Callido in 1790.

<text>The phrase Uncle Tom Cobley and all is used in British English as a humorous or whimsical way of saying &quot;et al.&quot;, often to express exasperation at the large number of people in a list. The phrase comes from a Devon folk song, &quot;Widecombe Fair&quot;, collected around 1890 by Sabine Baring-Gould. Its chorus ends with a long list of people: &quot;Bill Brewer, Jan Stewer, Peter Gurney, Peter Davy, Dan&#x27;l Whiddon, Harry Hawke, Old Uncle Tom Cobley and all.&quot; The surname is spelt as &quot;Cobleigh&quot; in some references.

Whether Tom Cobley, or the other characters from the song, ever existed is uncertain. Local historians have attempted to trace them in and around Dartmoor (for if they did ride to the fair at Widecombe, they may have travelled some distance). 
There is some suggestion that his relatives have been traced to a family which had moved to Plymouth in the early 1900s, but that no longer hold the name Cobley.

The strongest claim is held by the village of Spreyton, to the north of the moor, whose churchyard does indeed contain the grave of a Tom Cobley, buried 11 January 1844. However this is said to be the grave of the nephew of the &quot;real&quot; Tom Cobley, who died in 1794 and whose grave is unmarked. Cobley disapproved of his nephew and kept him out of his will (signed at Pascoe house, Colebrooke). The house at Butsford Barton, Colebrooke, was supposed to have been the home of Uncle Tom Cobley.

 The original &quot;Uncle Tom Cobley lived in a house near Yeoford Junction, in the Parish of Spreyton. His will was signed on January 20, 1787, and was proved on March 14, 1794. He was a genial old bachelor. Mr Samuel Peach, his oldest relation living, tells me,&quot;My great-uncle, who succeeded him, with whom I lived for some years, died in 1843, over eighty years of age; he married, but left no children.&quot; 

Old ‘Uncle Tom’ was said to have been an amorous bachelor and when he was young had bright red hair. This characteristic seems to have been to his advantage, for when paternity orders came in thick and fast, he refused to maintain any babies that did not have red hair like himself.

The village has made the most of its link with the folk song. It now has a &quot;Tom Cobley Cottage&quot; and a &quot;Tom Cobley Tavern&quot;. There also appears to have been a Bill Brewer who lived in nearby Sticklepath, and a Pearse family who ran a local mill; in Sticklepath there is the grave of a Tom Pearse who died in 1875. However, there remains some doubt as to whether this was the same Tom Pearse who features in the song since the earliest recorded Widecombe Fair was held in 1850.

Early in the 20th century, the novelist Beatrice Chase presented an &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; smock to the organisers of the fair, and now a local resident dressed as Uncle Tom appears at the festivities every year, complete with a grey mare.

His portrait shows him as a young boy.

==Name variants==
The name &quot;Cobleigh&quot; is of Anglo-Saxon origin. It has many spelling variants, &quot;including Cobley, Coblegh, Cobleigh, Cobligh, Coboleche and others&quot;.
The name &quot;Cobleigh&quot; seems to be particularly associated with South Devon. It is a predominant form e.g. in the &quot;Devon and Exeter Gazette&quot;. On 8 November 1909, an obituary claimed that the recently deceased farmer &quot;learned farming, at Colebrook, with the original &#x27;Uncle Tom Cobleigh&#x27; ... who died between 50 and 60 years since. Uncle Tom Cobleigh was partial to sport, and hunted a pack of harriers.&quot;, This also names the village of Coiebrooke, but uses the alternative spelling, and gives a vague date of &quot;between&quot; 1849 and 1859.

==Pseudonymous individuals==

A. J. Coles (Jan Stewer) began his dialect writings with a series called &quot;The Talk at Uncle Tom Cobleigh&#x27;s Club.&quot; Uncle Tom Cobleigh was the founder and respected spokesperson for the club, as Samuel Johnson was for the London Club, and in fiction Samuel Pickwick was for the Pickwick Club. 
When Coles abruptly terminated his role in the series, it was continued as &quot;The Talk of Uncle Tom Cobleigh&quot;, signed pseudonymously by &quot;Tom Cobleigh&quot;. When Coles&#x27; early stories were re-published in book form, Uncle Tom Cobleigh became a minor character called &quot;Tom Cobley.&quot;

==Scientific papers==
There have been instances of scientific papers—where multiple authorship is common—published with &quot;Cobley, U. T.&quot; humorously listed as one among a long list of otherwise genuine authors. Two papers indexed by ISI include U. T. Cobley as a co-author:
* (UT Cobley is listed as a member of the Shoklo SPf66 Malaria Vaccine Trial Group at the end of the paper.)

There are also some cases of papers listed with U. T. Cobley as an author in reference lists, even though the name does not appear in the original paper. This also shows how citation errors are perpetuated, presumably reflecting a reliance on other citations without checking the original source. Thus a paper by Cross, Heyworth, Murrell, Bockamp, Dexter and Green, published in the journal &quot;Oncogene&quot; in 1994, is frequently listed with the authors cited as &quot;Cross, M. A., Heyworth, C. M., Murrell, A. M., Bockamp, E.-O., Cobley, U. T., Dexter, T. M. &amp; Green, A. R.&quot; (e.g. in 1999 papers by Sinclair et al. and by Begley &amp; Green). However, Cobley does not appear in the original.

==Other occurrences==
Tom Cobleigh is the name of a chain of pubs/restaurants acquired by the Spirit Group in the UK in 2003.

Tom Cobleigh, his mare and the song are also loosely but obviously referenced in the last few lines of folk duo Show of Hands&#x27;s own song &quot;Widecombe Fair&quot;, which differs dramatically from the original. In this version the narrator of the song hints at a more sinister reason for the loan of the horse, he needs it to travel with the others named in the original song to a remote tavern whose landlord he suspects (with good reason) of murdering a young boy. Although it is never stated we can assume that the character in this song intends to take his revenge on the murderer. Steve Knightley, Show of Hands&#x27; lead vocalist and writer of their version, claims that it was inspired by historical research that has suggested that the original folk song may actually have been intended to convey a darker meaning than is commonly supposed.

<text> (Eng. transl.: &quot;second automobile enterprise private limited&quot;), usually abbreviated to Perodua (), is Malaysia&#x27;s largest car manufacturer, followed by Proton Holdings.

==Background and history==
Perodua was established in 1993 and launched its first 5-door hatchback, the Perodua Kancil, in August 1994. Initially, the company mainly produced minicars and superminis and did not have models in the same market segments as Proton. Its targeted market segments later began to overlap with Proton&#x27;s—especially in the super-compact segment, where the Perodua Myvi has competed with the likes of the Proton Savvy and the Proton Iriz.

Perodua does not design or engineer its main components, such as engines and transmissions, in-house; its cars have historically used Daihatsu component designs. Daihatsu held a 20% stake in Perodua at the company&#x27;s launch, increasing it to 25% in 2001 and then to 35%. In 2004, Perodua began assembling the Toyota Avanza at its plant in Rawang, for sale in Malaysia.

The company&#x27;s shareholders include UMW Holdings (38%), Daihatsu Motor Co. (20%), Daihatsu (Malaysia) (5%), MBM Resources (20%), PNB Equity Resource Corporation (10%), Mitsui &amp; Co. (4.2%), and Mitsui &amp; Co. (Asia Pacific) (2.8%).&lt;ref name=&quot;UMW Holdings presentation 03/2017 ir.chartnexus.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sales==
Domestic
Perodua sold more than 207,100 vehicles in 2016, which was its highest yearly sales record to date, and achieved a highest-ever domestic market share of 35.7%.

International
In the United Kingdom, Perodua&#x27;s cars were sold by some Proton dealers, who wished to attract customers seeking a smaller and cheaper alternative to the Proton range. Sales numbers in the UK were small, however, and in 2008, Perodua sold only 624 cars (down from 914 in 2002). Sales were up slightly in 2009 (to 650) and then to 761 in 2010, mainly due to the new Perodua Myvi selling comparatively well.

Currently, Perodua cars are exported to Singapore, Brunei, Mauritius, Fiji, Sri Lanka, and Seychelles. The company also exported the Myvi as the Daihatsu Sirion to Indonesia, which made up 55 percent of their exports in 2020.

In 2021, the company began exploring the idea of exporting used Perodua cars overseas. As of 2024, the company was exporting used cars to a few countries, including Fiji. At the same time, exports of used cars were halted in Sri Lanka.

Perodua organised a competition in 1997 to find a new corporate logo, to be launched together with their upcoming model, tentatively known as the X555. The competition was won by Johnson Ng Weng Kuan, an architecture student from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. Perodua officially unveiled the new corporate logo on 24 August 1998, when they launched Malaysia&#x27;s first sport utility vehicle, the Perodua Kembara.

The new logo maintains the &#x27;P&#x27; and &#x27;2&#x27; and the colours of the old, squarish logo, but has been stylised further to become elliptical.

<doc id="685746" wikidata="Q10927834" url="?curid=685746" title="Laterality">
<text>The term laterality refers to the preference most humans show for one side of their body over the other. Examples include left-handedness/right-handedness and left/right-footedness; it may also refer to the primary use of the left or right hemisphere in the brain. It may also apply to animals or plants. The majority of tests have been conducted on humans, specifically to determine the effects on language.

== Human ==
Most humans are right-handed. Many are also right-sided in general (that is, they prefer to use their right eye, right foot and right ear if forced to make a choice between the two). The reasons for this are not fully understood, but it is thought that because the left cerebral hemisphere of the brain controls the right side of the body, the right side is generally stronger; it is suggested that the left cerebral hemisphere is dominant over the right in most humans because in 90–92% of all humans, the left hemisphere is the language hemisphere.

Human cultures are predominantly right-handed, and so the right-sided trend may be socially as well as biologically enforced. This is quite apparent from a quick survey of languages. The English word &quot;left&quot; comes from the Anglo-Saxon word which means &quot;weak&quot; or &quot;useless&quot;. Similarly, the French word for left, &#x27;, is also used to mean &quot;awkward&quot; or &quot;tactless&quot;, and &#x27;, the Latin word from which the English word &quot;sinister&quot; was derived, means &quot;left&quot;. Similarly, in many cultures the word for &quot;right&quot; also means &quot;correct&quot;. The English word &quot;right&quot; comes from the Anglo-Saxon word which also means &quot;straight&quot; or &quot;correct.&quot;

This linguistic and social bias is not restricted to European cultures: for example, Chinese characters are designed for right-handers to write, and no significant left-handed culture has ever been found in the world.

When a person is forced to use the hand opposite of the hand that they would naturally use, this is known as &quot;forced laterality&quot;, or more specifically &quot;forced dextrality&quot;. A study done by the Department of Neurology at Keele University, North Staffordshire Royal Infirmary suggests that forced dextrality may be part of the reason that the percentage of left-handed people decreases with the higher age groups, both because the effects of pressures toward right-handedness are cumulative over time (hence increasing with age for any given person subjected to them) and because the prevalence of such pressure is decreasing, such that fewer members of younger generations face any such pressure to begin with.

Ambidexterity is when a person has approximately equal skill with both hands and/or both sides of the body. True ambidexterity is very rare. Although a small number of people can write competently with both hands and use both sides of their body well, even these people usually show preference for one side of their body over the other. However, this preference is not necessarily consistent for all activities. Some people may, for instance, use their right hand for writing, and their left hand for playing racket sports and eating (&quot;see also:&quot; cross-dominance).

Also, it is not uncommon that people preferring to use the right hand prefer to use the left leg, e.g. when using a shovel, kicking a ball, or operating control pedals. In many cases, this may be because they are disposed for left-handedness but have been trained for right-handedness, which is usually attached to learning and behavioural disorders (term usually so called as &quot;cross dominance&quot;). In the sport of cricket, some players may find that they are more comfortable bowling with their left or right hand, but batting with the other hand.

Approximate statistics, complied in 1981, are given below:
*Favoring right hand: 88.2%
*Favoring right foot: 81.0%
*Favoring right eye: 71.1%
*Favoring right ear: 59.1%
*Same hand and foot: 84%
*Same ear and eye: 61.8%

Laterality of motor and sensory control has been the subject of a recent intense study and review. It turns out that the hemisphere of speech is the hemisphere of action in general and that the command hemisphere is located either in the right or the left hemisphere (never in both). Around 80% of people are left hemispheric for speech and the remainder are right hemispheric: ninety percent of right-handers are left hemispheric for speech, but only 50% of left-handers are right hemispheric for speech (the remainder are left hemispheric). The reaction time of the neurally dominant side of the body (the side opposite to the major hemisphere or the command center, as just defined) is shorter than that of the opposite side by an interval equal to the interhemispheric transfer time. Thus, one in five persons has a handedness that is the opposite for which they are wired (per laterality of command center or brainedness, as determined by reaction time study mentioned above).

===Different expressions===
; Board footedness: The stance in a boardsport is not necessarily the same as the normal-footedness of the person. In skateboarding and other board sports, a &quot;goofy footed&quot; stance is one with the right foot leading. A stance with the left foot forward is called &quot;regular&quot; or &quot;normal&quot; stance.
; Jump and spin: Direction of rotation in figure skating jumps and spins is not necessarily the same as the footedness or the handedness of each person. A skater can jump and spin counter-clockwise (the most common direction), yet be left-footed and left-handed.
; Ocular dominance: The eye preferred when binocular vision is not possible, as through a keyhole or monocular microscope.

=== Speech ===
Cerebral dominance or specialization has been studied in relation to a variety of human functions. With speech in particular, many studies have been used as evidence that it is generally localized in the left hemisphere. Research comparing the effects of lesions in the two hemispheres, split-brain patients, and perceptual asymmetries have aided in the knowledge of speech lateralization. In one particular study, the left hemisphere&#x27;s sensitivity to differences in rapidly changing sound cues was noted (Annett, 1991). This has real world implication, since very fine acoustic discriminations are needed to comprehend and produce speech signals. In an electrical stimulation demonstration performed by Ojemann and Mateer (1979), the exposed cortex was mapped revealing the same cortical sites were activated in phoneme discrimination and mouth movement sequences (Annett, 1991).

As suggested by Kimura (1975, 1982), left hemisphere speech lateralization might be based upon a preference for movement sequences as demonstrated by American Sign Language (ASL) studies. Since ASL requires intricate hand movements for language communication, it was proposed that skilled hand motions and speech require sequences of action over time. In deaf patients with a left hemispheric stroke and damage, noticeable losses in their abilities to sign were noted. These cases were compared to studies of normal speakers with dysphasias located at lesioned areas similar to the deaf patients. In the same study, deaf patients with right hemispheric lesions did not display any significant loss of signing nor any decreased capacity for motor sequencing (Annett, 1991).

One theory, known as the acoustic laterality theory, the physical properties of certain speech sounds are what determine laterality to the left hemisphere. Stop consonants, for example t, p, or k, leave a defined silent period at the end of words that can easily be distinguished. This theory postulates that changing sounds such as these are preferentially processed by the left hemisphere. As a result of the right ear being responsible for transmission to sounds to the left hemisphere, it is capable of perceiving these sounds with rapid changes. This right ear advantage in hearing and speech laterality was evidenced in dichotic listening studies. Magnetic imaging results from this study showed greater left hemisphere activation when actual words were presented as opposed to pseudowords. Two important aspects of speech recognition are phonetic cues, such as format patterning, and prosody cues, such as intonation, accent, and emotional state of the speaker (Imaizumi, Koichi, Kiritani, Hosoi &amp; Tonoike, 1998).

In a study done with both monolinguals and bilinguals, which took into account language experience, second language proficiency, and onset of bilingualism among other variables, researchers were able to demonstrate left hemispheric dominance. In addition, bilinguals that began speaking a second language early in life demonstrated bilateral hemispheric involvement. The findings of this study were able to predict differing patterns of cerebral language lateralization in adulthood (Hull &amp; Vaid, 2006).

== In other animals ==
It has been shown that cerebral lateralization is a widespread phenomenon in the animal kingdom. Functional and structural differences between left and right brain hemispheres can be found in many other vertebrates and also in invertebrates.

It has been proposed that negative, withdrawal-associated emotions are processed predominantly by the right hemisphere, whereas the left hemisphere is largely responsible for processing positive, approach-related emotions. This has been called the &quot;laterality-valence hypothesis&quot;.

One sub-set of laterality in animals is limb dominance. Preferential limb use for specific tasks has been shown in species including chimpanzees, mice, bats, wallabies, parrots, chickens and toads.

Another form of laterality is hemispheric dominance for processing conspecific vocalizations, reported for chimpanzees, sea lions, dogs, zebra finches and Bengalese finches.

=== In mice ===
In mice (&quot;Mus musculus&quot;), laterality in paw usage has been shown to be a learned behavior (rather than inherited), due to which, in any population, half of the mice become left-handed while the other half becomes right-handed. The learning occurs by a gradual reinforcement of randomly occurring weak asymmetries in paw choice early in training, even when training in an unbiased world. Meanwhile, reinforcement relies on short-term and long-term memory skills that are strain-dependent, causing strains to differ in the degree of laterality of its individuals. Long-term memory of previously gained laterality in handedness due to training is heavily diminished in mice with absent corpus callosum and reduced hippocampal commissure. Regardless of the amount of past training and consequent biasing of paw choice, there is a degree of randomness in paw choice that is not removed by training, which may provide adaptability to changing environments.

=== In other mammals ===
Domestic horses (&quot;Equus caballus&quot;) exhibit laterality in at least two areas of neural organization, i.e. sensory and motor. In thoroughbreds, the strength of motor laterality increases with age. Horses under 4 years old have a preference to initially use the right nostril during olfaction. Along with olfaction, French horses have an eye laterality when looking at novel objects. There is a correlation between their score on an emotional index and eye preference; horses with higher emotionality are more likely to look with their left eye. The less emotive French saddlebreds glance at novel objects using the right eye, however, this tendency is absent in the trotters, although the emotive index is the same for both breeds. Racehorses exhibit laterality in stride patterns as well. They use their preferred stride pattern at all times whether racing or not, unless they are forced to change it while turning, injured, or fatigued.

In domestic dogs (&quot;Canis familiaris&quot;), there is a correlation between motor laterality and noise sensitivity - a lack of paw preference is associated with noise-related fearfulness. (Branson and Rogers, 2006) Fearfulness is an undesirable trait in guide dogs, therefore, testing for laterality can be a useful predictor of a successful guide dog. Knowing a guide dog&#x27;s laterality can also be useful for training because the dog may be better at walking to the left or the right of their blind owner.

Domestic cats (&quot;Felis catus&quot;) show an individual handedness when reaching for static food. In one study, 46% preferred to use the right paw, 44% the left, and 10% were ambi-lateral; 60% used one paw 100% of the time. There was no difference between male and female cats in the proportions of left and right paw preferences. In moving-target reaching tests, cats have a left-sided behavioural asymmetry. One study indicates that laterality in this species is strongly related to temperament. Furthermore, individuals with stronger paw preferences are rated as more confident, affectionate, active, and friendly.

Chimpanzees show right-handedness in certain conditions. This is expressed at the population level for females, but not males. The complexity of the task has a dominant effect on handedness in chimps.

Cattle use visual/brain lateralisation in their visual scanning of novel and familiar stimuli. Domestic cattle prefer to view novel stimuli with the left eye, (similar to horses, Australian magpies, chicks, toads and fish) but use the right eye for viewing familiar stimuli.

Schreibers&#x27; long-fingered bat is lateralized at the population level and shows a left-hand bias for climbing or grasping.

Some types of mastodon indicate laterality through the fossil remains having differing tusk lengths.

====In marsupials====
Marsupials are fundamentally different from other mammals in that they lack a corpus callosum. However, wild kangaroos and other macropod marsupials have a left-hand preference for everyday tasks. Left-handedness is particularly apparent in the red kangaroo (&quot;Macropus rufus&quot;) and the eastern gray kangaroo (&quot;Macropus giganteus&quot;). The red-necked wallaby (&quot;Macropus rufogriseus&quot;) preferentially uses the left hand for behaviours that involve fine manipulation, but the right for behaviours that require more physical strength. There is less evidence for handedness in arboreal species.

===In birds===
Parrots tend to favor one foot when grasping objects (for example fruit when feeding). Some studies indicate that most parrots are left footed.

The Australian magpie (&quot;Gymnorhina tibicen&quot;) uses both left-eye and right-eye laterality when performing anti-predator responses, which include mobbing. Prior to withdrawing from a potential predator, Australian magpies view the animal with the left eye (85%), but prior to approaching, the right eye is used (72%). The left eye is used prior to jumping (73%) and prior to circling (65%) the predator, as well as during circling (58%) and for high alert inspection of the predator (72%). The researchers commented that &quot;mobbing and perhaps circling are agonistic responses controlled by the LE[left eye]/right hemisphere, as also seen in other species. Alert inspection involves detailed examination of the predator and likely high levels of fear, known to be right hemisphere function.&quot;

Yellow-legged gull (&quot;Larus michahellis&quot;) chicks show laterality when reverting from a supine to prone posture, and also in pecking at a dummy parental bill to beg for food. Lateralization occurs at both the population and individual level in the reverting response and at the individual level in begging. Females have a leftward preference in the righting response, indicating this is sex dependent. Laterality in the begging response in chicks varies according to laying order and matches variation in egg androgens concentration.
===In fish===
Laterality determines the organisation of rainbowfish (&quot;Melanotaenia&quot; spp.) schools. These fish demonstrate an individual eye preference when examining their reflection in a mirror. Fish which show a right-eye preference in the mirror test prefer to be on the left side of the school. Conversely, fish that show a left-eye preference in the mirror test or were non-lateralised, prefer to be slightly to the right side of the school. The behaviour depends on the species and sex of the school.

===In amphibians===
Three species of toads, the common toad (&quot;Bufo bufo&quot;), green toad (&quot;Bufo viridis&quot;) and the cane toad (&quot;Bufo marinus&quot;) show stronger escape and defensive responses when a model predator was placed on the toad&#x27;s left side compared to their right side. Emei music frogs (&quot;Babina daunchina&quot;) have a right-ear preference for positive or neutral signals such as a conspecific&#x27;s advertisement call and white noise, but a left-ear preference for negative signals such as predatory attack.

===In invertebrates===
The Mediterranean fruit fly (&quot;Ceratitis capitata&quot;) exhibits left-biased population-level lateralisation of aggressive displays (boxing with forelegs and wing strikes) with no sex-differences. In ants, &quot;Temnothorax albipennis&quot; (rock ant) scouts show behavioural lateralization when exploring unknown nest sites, showing a population-level bias to prefer left turns. One possible reason for this is that its environment is partly maze-like and consistently turning in one direction is a good way to search and exit mazes without getting lost. This turning bias is correlated with slight asymmetries in the ants&#x27; compound eyes (differential ommatidia count).

<text>Manchester is a town in Ontario County, New York, United States. The population was 9,406 at the 2020 census. The town was named after one of its villages, which in turn was named after the city of Manchester in England. It was formed in 1822 from the town of Farmington.

The Town of Manchester includes a village also named Manchester. The town is northeast of the city of Canandaigua.

==Lehigh Valley Railroad==
Manchester was an important division point and car classification yard for the Lehigh Valley Railroad and was, at one time, the largest such facility in the world. As a division point, crews and locomotives were exchanged. Freight cars were switched from track to track, organizing them for delivery to their destinations. Support services included the 30-stall roundhouse, the coaling tower, facilities for ash removal, track maintenance, car repair, a control tower, the yard office, an ice house, and the bunkhouse-restaurant.

With the failure of the Pennsylvania Railroad (which had taken over operations of the Lehigh Valley Railroad in 1962) in the mid-60s, the division yard&#x27;s purpose was largely unneeded. By the next decade, all that remained in use at the yard was the mainline travelling through the town. The yard closed on October 30, 1972.

Today only a few crumbling structures, some old track, and a couple of rusted boxcars remain.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 37.8 square miles (97.9 km2), of which 37.8 square miles is land and (0.08%) is water.

The Erie Canal, a part called the Wide Waters, briefly passes through the northeastern corner of the town, and the New York State Thruway (Interstate 90) passes through the center. New York State Route 96 is a major highway that parallels the Thruway and intersects New York State Route 21 in Manchester village.

The northern town line is the border of Wayne County (Palmyra).

Cumorah, a hill in Manchester, is the location where Joseph Smith is said to have found a set of golden plates which he translated into English and published as the Book of Mormon.

On October 23, 1844, local farmer and Millerite named Hiram Edson had an ecstatic vision in the wake of The Great Disappointment while crossing his cornfield in Manchester near Port Gibson. This vision became one of the foundational events of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 9,258 people, 3,589 households, and 2,447 families residing in the town. The population density was . There were 3,815 housing units at an average density of 39.0 persons/km2 (101.0 persons/sq mi). The racial makeup of the town was 97.69% White, 0.53% African American, 0.37% Native American, 0.21% Asian, 0.00% Pacific Islander, 0.14% from other races, and 1.07% from two or more races. 1.14% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

There were 3,589 households, out of which 32.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 53.2% were married couples living together, 10.4% have a woman whose husband does not live with her, and 31.8% were non-families. 25.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 12.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.51 and the average family size was 3.01.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 24.8% under the age of 18, 6.5% from 18 to 24, 29.8% from 25 to 44, 23.7% from 45 to 64, and 15.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 38 years. For every 100 females, there were 95.8 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 92.6 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $39,154, and the median income for a family was $47,117. Males had a median income of $32,444 versus $25,041 for females. The per capita income for the town was $19,285. About 6.3% of families and 8.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 13.0% under the age of 18 and 3.5% age 65 or older.

<text>A Roman military diploma was a document inscribed in bronze certifying that the holder was honourably discharged from the Roman armed forces and/or had received the grant of Roman citizenship from the emperor as reward for service.

The diploma was a notarised copy of an original &quot;constitutio&quot; (decree) issued by the emperor in Rome, listing by regiment (or unit) the eligible veterans. The &quot;constitutio&quot;, recorded on a large bronze plate, was lodged in the military archive at Rome (none such has been found; presumably they were melted down in later times).

== History ==

Diplomas were issued during the Principate period (52–284 AD) to retiring veterans who had served in those corps of the Roman armed forces which enlisted &quot;peregrini&quot;, that is, inhabitants of the Roman empire who were not Roman citizens (the vast majority of the empire&#x27;s population in the 1st and 2nd centuries). Such corps were: the ; Roman navy, the Praetorian Guard&#x27;s cavalry (&quot;equites singulares Augusti&quot;); and the &quot;cohortes urbanae&quot; (the City of Rome&#x27;s public-order battalions).

The first known diploma dates from AD 52, under emperor Claudius (r. 41–54), who appears to have regularised the practice of granting Roman citizenship to non-citizen auxiliaries after 25 years&#x27; service (26 in the navy).

Diplomas were not normally issued to discharged legionaries, as the legions recruited Roman citizens only. However, legionary diplomas were exceptionally issued after the Civil War of 68/69 AD. As an emergency measure, 2 new legions, the &quot;I&quot; and &quot;II Classica&quot; (later reconstituted and renamed as I and II Adiutrix, respectively) were formed mainly from naval marines, many of whom did not hold citizenship. At the end of the crisis, these were all awarded Roman citizenship.

In 212, the &quot;Constitutio Antoniniana&quot;, issued by the emperor Caracalla, granted Roman citizenship to all the inhabitants of the empire, thus ending the second-class &quot;peregrini&quot; status. This made military diplomas largely redundant, and indeed the last known auxiliary diplomas date from AD 203. But diplomas for service in the navy, Praetorian Guard cavalry and the &quot;cohortes urbanae&quot; continued to be issued until the late 3rd century. This might be explained by the fact that &quot;barbari&quot; (foreigners from outside the Roman empire) were still recruited for those units.

== Rights granted ==

The veteran was granted Roman citizenship, which carried important legal and fiscal advantages, including exemption from the poll tax (&quot;tributum capitis&quot;) payable by all non-citizen subjects of the empire. Citizenship was also granted to the veteran&#x27;s natural children, but not to his female partner. Until ca. 140, all children born to the veteran during his term of service were eligible. After that date, it appears that the grant was restricted to children born after the veteran&#x27;s discharge (unless the veteran had registered children born before his enlistment). This seemingly retrogressive step has been doubted by some historians, and it is possible that the available evidence is garbled.

Until the time of emperor Septimius Severus (r. 197–211), serving soldiers were legally prohibited to marry. In practice, many formed stable relationships with local women and brought up families. Diplomas retrospectively regularised such unions by granting the discharged veteran, in addition to citizenship, the right of &quot;conubium&quot; (&quot;inter-marriage&quot;), which was necessary as Roman citizens were not legally permitted to marry non-citizens (unless the latter possessed &quot;Latin Rights&quot;).

An exceptional &quot;constitutio&quot; of emperor Hadrian (r. 117–38) is known from 3 diplomas, which granted citizenship to the beneficiaries&#x27; parents and siblings, in addition to their children.

== Description ==

The diploma consisted of two bronze tablets hinged together. Inscriptions would be engraved on each side of both plates. The full text of a diploma was engraved on the outer side of the so-called tabula 1, while the outer side of tabula 2 displayed the names of 7 witnesses, their seals covered and protected by metal strips (such seals have rarely survived, being of organic material). The text of tabula 1 was reproduced exactly on the two inner sides. The plates would then be folded shut and sealed together, so that the external inscription would be legible without breaking the seals. The internal inscription was the official notarised copy of the text on the &quot;constitutio&quot; published in Rome. The double-inscription and seals were presumably to prevent forgery or alteration.

In a likely scenario, the holder would take the sealed diploma to the province or &quot;civitas&quot; (city/county) where he intended to live in retirement. He would then present the diploma to the keeper of archives either at the provincial governor&#x27;s headquarters (or perhaps at his local &quot;civitas&quot; offices). The archivist could break the seals and check that the data on the internal inscription matched the external one. If all was in order, he would then enter the diploma-holder&#x27;s name onto the register of resident Roman citizens.

The bronze of the known military diplomas is chemically very uniform and therefore appears to have been produced in Rome specifically for this use.

== Research significance ==

Over 800 diplomas from the Principate have been found and over 650 published (although the majority have survived in only fragmentary form). This constitutes a rare corpus of Roman documentary material, whose survival is due to their being made of metal, rather than degradable material such as papyrus, wood or wax. A particular advantage of diplomas for historians is that they are dated. The date of the constitution was entered as the year of the emperor&#x27;s &quot;tribunicia potestas&quot;; while the date of issue of the notarised copy (diploma) was given as the day of the month and the names of the Consuls currently in office (resulting in diplomas being an important source for the names of suffect consuls). As these documents also list the name of the provincial governor, they provide valuable data on senators&#x27; career-paths. In addition, diplomas usually record the names of several auxiliary units which served in the same province at the same time, as they were normally issued in batches. Thus a single diploma may yield the names of as many as 25 units included in the same constitution, critical data on the deployment of auxiliary units in the various provinces of the empire at different times. Constitutions are also known just for individual units, even individual veterans.

The following information on the beneficiary was usually recorded in the diploma: beneficiary&#x27;s regiment, regimental commander&#x27;s name, beneficiary&#x27;s military rank, name of beneficiary, name of beneficiary&#x27;s father and origin (nation, tribe or city); name of beneficiary&#x27;s wife and name of her father and origin; and names of children granted citizenship.

<text>The El Toro &quot;Y&quot; is a freeway interchange in Irvine, California where the Santa Ana Freeway, Interstate 5 (I-5), and the San Diego Freeway (at that point the I-405) merge. South of the El Toro Y, the highway is named the &quot;San Diego Freeway&quot; with the highway designation &quot;I-5.&quot; Located in south Orange County, the interchange was named after the nearby city El Toro (now Lake Forest), and the now-closed Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, located northeast of the interchange.

The &quot;Y&quot; is one of the busiest interchanges in the world; from 1975 to 2002, daily traffic surged from 102,000 to 356,000 vehicles a day.

The &quot;Y&quot; was where American broadcast reporter Zoey Tur of KCBS-TV, via news helicopter, first located and broadcast O.J. Simpson&#x27;s white Ford Bronco slow-speed police chase exclusively for 22 minutes on June 17, 1994. In the cleft of the &quot;Y&quot; lies the Irvine Spectrum Center.

==History==
By the early 1990s, the El Toro Y had become one of the most congested freeway interchanges in the world, its severe overcrowding fed by a housing boom in southern Orange County.

In November 1990, Orange County voters approved Measure M, a half-cent increase in the county sales tax to finance transportation improvements. In 1993, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) began a massive expansion project, adding a new interchange and collector/distributor roads at Bake Parkway (signed as truck bypass lanes) and Lake Forest Drive, and carpool lanes and connectors. The $166-million project also vastly increased regular traffic lanes. The project increased the number of vehicles per day from 300,000 to 400,000. After the project was completed in 1997, the El Toro Y stood as one of the widest roads in the world, at 26 traffic lanes wide.

The traffic delays at the interchange sparked the construction of several parallel bypass toll roads. The San Joaquin Hills Toll Road, designated State Route 73 (SR 73), opened in November 1996 and connects San Juan Capistrano and Costa Mesa. Another parallel road to the El Toro Y is SR 241, the Foothill Toll Road, and the free southern extension, known as &quot;Los Patrones Parkway&quot;, that currently ends at Cow Camp Road near SR 74. An extension is planned from Cow Camp Road to Avenida La Pata (Antonio Parkway) in San Clemente in the near future.

SR 241 was proposed to connect to I-5 in northern San Diego County, but local opposition regarding environmental issues near Trestles have put the project on hold. In 2017, the Transportation Corridor Agencies considered extending SR 241 to San Clemente. However, residents opposed the proposed route because it would have cost $2 billion, would have intersected at the busiest interchange in San Clemente, Avenida Pico, would have demolished many new homes with real estate value, would have been constructed next to a high school, and would waste taxpayers’ money because the interchange had undergone improvements between 2015 and 2018. Local residents also say that traffic would be worse, equivalent to the SR 91 and SR 241 interchange.

The Irvine Spectrum Center, a large shopping center featuring a movie theater, numerous shopping destinations and a large obelisk, which conceals a cell phone and television tower inside of it, is in the cleft of the Y.

On July 29, 2008, a moderate earthquake centered in Chino Hills caused damage to an expansion joint on one of the overpasses in the interchange. Caltrans closed the 5 Southbound Truck Bypass/Bake Parkway/Lake Forest exit to replace the expansion joint that was damaged during the quake.

== In popular culture ==
The El Toro Y was referenced the 2011 episode &quot;Angry Dad: the Movie&quot; of the animated sitcom The Simpsons, when Bart gives Homer a list of &quot;Must-See Attractions&quot; in Los Angeles.

In the third episode of The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story, it was initially reported that O. J. Simpson was spotted in Al Cowlings&#x27;s Ford Bronco on Interstate 405 at Irvine Center Drive at the El Toro Y. However, the scenes were shot elsewhere in Los Angeles.

<text>John Eric Littlewood (25 May 1931 – 16 September 2009) was for many years a leading British chess player and took the title of national senior champion in 2006. Perhaps his most famous game was the one he lost against the world champion Mikhail Botvinnik at the Hastings International Chess Congress 1961/2. Littlewood launched a fearsome attack which Botvinnik was able to defend only by means of a tactical finesse. Botvinnik chose to include the game in his autobiographical &quot;Best Games 1947–1970&quot;.

== Early life and education==
John Littlewood was born in Sheffield, Yorkshire in 1931, the fourth of his eleven siblings. He did not start playing chess until he was 13, when he was introduced to the game by a friend. He kept on losing to his friend, so he went into the school library and checked out every single chess book. He then read a lot of chess tactics, and eventually beat his friend.

At 16 he had improved and joined the local chess club. As he had not played that many people, he was surprised when he found he could beat everyone in the club. At this point he became very keen on the game. While at Sheffield University, Littlewood won three university tournaments and the Sheffield Championship.

== Career ==
After university he entered national service, where he taught reading and writing to soldiers. Because of this he did not have the opportunity to play chess for two years.

After national service he worked as a French teacher in Lincolnshire, at Skegness Grammar School from 1955 to 1967. His first big break was when he was invited to the British Chess Championship in York. He competed well for his first time and was nicknamed &#x27;the Lincolnshire poacher&#x27;, a name he protested because he was born in Sheffield.

After his good performance in York, he was invited to participate in the prestigious Hastings tournament and played his famous game against Mikhail Botvinnik, the World Champion at the time. Littlewood started with a promising attack, but he missed an important resource. This enabled Botvinnik to turn the game around and defeat him. Botvinnik includes this game in his autobiographical &quot;Best Games 1947–1970”.

At Hastings, Littlewood also played the American grandmaster Arthur Bisguier, who he beat in 23 moves. After the match his opponent said &quot;What do they feed this guy on? Raw meat?&quot;

Later, Littlewood played at two Olympiads, several Anglo-Dutch matches, and European and World Seniors. He was proud to have defeated the German grandmaster Wolfgang Uhlmann on two occasions. Aside from playing the game, he also managed the national blind chess team. At one stage, he was the Director of Junior Chess.

John Littlewood was the outright winner of the British Senior Chess Championship in 2006 and finished equal first in 2008, when the contest was held at Liverpool&#x27;s St. George&#x27;s Hall. To be eligible to compete, participants must be sixty and above; he was seventy-seven on this second occasion and one of the oldest players taking part.

He had his own chess column called &quot;Littlewood&#x27;s Choice&quot;, printed once a month in the English Chess Federation magazine.

== Family and personal life ==
His brother Norman also played in two Olympiads, and his son Paul, an International Master, won the British Chess Championship in 1981.

Littlewood lived in Skelmersdale, Lancashire, and had seven children and eight grandchildren.

<doc id="685764" wikidata="Q1490242" url="?curid=685764" title="Palliative sedation">
<text>In medicine, specifically in end-of-life care, palliative sedation (also known as terminal sedation, continuous deep sedation, or sedation for intractable distress of a dying patient) is the palliative practice of relieving distress in a terminally ill person in the last hours or days of a dying person&#x27;s life, usually by means of a continuous intravenous or subcutaneous infusion of a sedative drug, or by means of a specialized catheter designed to provide comfortable and discreet administration of ongoing medications via the rectal route.

As of 2013, approximately tens of millions of people a year were unable to resolve their needs of physical, psychological, or spiritual suffering at their time of death. Due to the amount of pain a dying person may face, palliative care is considered important. Proponents claim palliative sedation can provide a more peaceful and ethical solution for such people.

Palliative sedation is an option of last resort for the people whose symptoms cannot be controlled by any other means. It is not considered a form of euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide, as the goal of palliative sedation is to control symptoms, rather than to shorten or end the person&#x27;s life.

Palliative sedation is legal everywhere and has been administered since the hospice care movement began in the 1960s. The practice of palliative sedation has been a topic of debate and controversy as many view it as a form of slow euthanasia or mercy killing, associated with many ethical questions. Discussion of this practice occurs in medical literature, but there is no consensus because of unclear definitions and guidelines, with many differences in practice across the world.

==Definition==

Palliative sedation is the use of sedative medications to relieve refractory symptoms when all other interventions have failed. The phrase &quot;terminal sedation&quot; was initially used to describe the practice of sedation at end of life, but was changed due to ambiguity as to what the word &#x27;terminal&#x27; meant. The term &quot;palliative sedation&quot; was then used to emphasize palliative care. The level of sedation via palliative sedation may be mild, intermediate or deep and the medications may be administered intermittently or continuously.

The term &quot;refractory symptoms&quot; is defined as symptoms that cannot be controlled despite the use of extensive therapeutic resources, with such symptoms having an intolerable effect on the patient&#x27;s well-being in the final stages of life. The symptoms may be physical, psychological, or both.

== General practice ==

===Palliative care===

Palliative care is aimed to relieve suffering and improve the quality of life for people with serious and/or life-threatening illness in all stages of disease, as well as for their families. It can be provided either as an add-on therapy to the primary curative treatment or as a monotherapy for people who are on end-of-life care. In general, palliative care focuses on managing symptoms, including but not limited to pain, insomnia, mental alterations, fatigue, difficulty breathing, and eating disorders. In order to initiate the care, self-reported information is considered the primary data to assess the symptoms along with other physical examinations and laboratory tests. However, in people at the advanced stage of the disease with potential experience of physical fatigue, mental confusion or delirium which prevent them from fully cooperating with the care team, a comprehensive symptom assessment can be utilized to fully capture all symptoms as well as their severity.

There are multiple interventions that can be used to manage the conditions depending on the frequency and severity of the symptoms, including using medications (i.e. opioid in cancer-related pain), physical therapy/modification (i.e. frequent oral hygiene for xerostomia/dry mouth treatment), or reversal of precipitating causes (i.e. low fiber diet or dehydration in constipation management).

===Palliative sedation===

Palliative sedation is often the last resort if the person is resistant to other managing therapies or if the therapies fail to provide sufficient relief for their refractory symptoms, including pain, delirium, dyspnea, and severe psychological distress.

In terms of the initiation of palliative sedation, it should be a shared clinical decision initiated preferably between the person receiving treatment and the care team. If severe mental alterations or delirium is the concern for the person to make an informed decision, consent can be obtained in the early stage of the disease or upon the admission to the hospice facility. Family members can only participate in the decision-making process if explicitly requested by the person in care.

Palliative sedation can be used for short periods with the plan to awaken the person after a given time period, making terminal sedation a less correct term. The person is sedated while symptom control is attempted, then the person is awakened to see if symptom control is achieved. In some extreme cases (i.e. for those whose life expectancy is hours or days at the most), palliative sedation is begun with the plan to not attempt to reawaken the person.

=== Assessment and obtaining consent ===
Though people may receive palliative care, pharmacologically decreasing one&#x27;s consciousness may be the only remaining option to help alleviate intolerable disease symptoms and suffering. Prior to receiving palliative sedation, persons should undergo careful consideration along with their health care team to make sure all other resources and treatment strategies have been exhausted. In the case the person is uncommunicable due to severe suffering, the individual&#x27;s family member should be consulted, as decreasing the distress of family members is also a key component and goal of palliative care and palliative sedation.

The first step in consideration of palliative sedation is assessment of the person seeking the treatment.

There are several states that one may be in that can make palliative sedation the preferred treatment, including but not limited to physical and psychological pain and severe emotional distress. More often than not, refractory or intolerable symptoms give a more sound reason to pursue palliative sedation. Though the interdisciplinary health care team is there to help each person make the most sound medical decision, the individual&#x27;s judgement is considered to be the most accurate in deciding whether or not their suffering is manageable.

According to a systematic review encompassing over thirty peer-reviewed research studies, 68% of the studies used stated physical symptoms as the primary reason for palliative sedation. The individuals involved in the included studies were terminally ill or suffering from refractory and intolerable symptoms. Medical conditions that had the most compelling reasons for palliative sedation were not only limited to intolerable pain, but include psychological symptoms such as delirium accompanied by uncontrollable psychomotor agitation. Severe trouble breathing (dyspnea) or respiratory distress were also considered a more urgent reason for pursuing palliative sedation. Other symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, and vomiting were also reasons for palliative sedation.

Once assessment is completed and palliative sedation has been decided for the person, a written consent for administration to proceed must be given by the individual. The consent must state their agreement for sedation and lowering their consciousness, regardless of each individual&#x27;s stage in illness or the treatment period of palliative sedation. In order to make a decision, one must be sufficiently informed of their disease state, the specificities and implications of treatment, and potential risks they may face during the treatment. At the time of consent, the person should fully be aware of and understand all necessary legal and medical consequences of palliative sedation. It is also critical that the individual is making the decision upon their own free will, and not under coercion of any sort. The only exception where the individual&#x27;s consent is not obtained would be in emergency medical situations where one is incapable of making a decision, in which the individual&#x27;s family or caregiver must give the consent after adequate education, as one would have been given.

=== Continuous vs. intermittent sedation ===
Palliative sedation can be administered continuously, until the person&#x27;s death, or intermittently, with the intention to discontinue the sedation at an agreed upon time. Although not as common, intermittent sedation allows family members of the person to gradually come to terms with their grief and while still relieving the individual of their distress. During intermittent palliative sedation, the person is still able to communicate with their family members. Intermittent sedation is recommended by some authorities for use prior to continuous infusion to provide the person with some relief from distress while still maintaining interactive function.

==Sedative medications==

=== Sedating agents ===
Benzodiazepines: These are a drug class that works on the central nervous system to tackle a variety of medical conditions, such as seizures, anxiety, and depression. As benzodiazepines suppress the activities of nerves in the brain, they also create a sedating effect which is utilized for multiple medical procedures and purposes. Among all benzodiazepine agents, midazolam (Versed) is the most frequently used medication for palliative sedation for its rapid onset and short duration of action. The main indications for midazolam in palliative sedation are to control delirium and alleviate breathing difficulties so as to minimize distress and prevent exacerbation of these symptoms.

Opioids: Opioid which relieve pain primarily via modulation of receptor activity in the central nervous also commonly induce sedation or drowsiness. However, they are more frequently used for analgesia than sedation.

Even though opioids tend to provide a comforting effect for recipients, there exists the risk of drug dependence to a lesser substance use disorder and diversion of medications. Therefore, the &quot;Clinical Practice Guidelines for Quality Palliative Care&quot; from the National Consensus Project recommends a comprehensive assessment of symptoms prior to initiating pharmacological therapy, ongoing monitoring to determine efficacy and any adverse effects, and educating the patient and family.

=== Administration and monitoring ===
Palliative sedation is administered commonly in hospital or inpatient settings, but also reported to be performed in home care settings. The medication prescribed for palliation will need dose titration to initially manage the refractory symptoms and relieve suffering, and therapy will continue to maintain adequate effect. Prescribed sedatives can be administered intravenously, rectally, etc. on a continuous and/or intermittent basis. When breakthrough symptoms occur, emergency bolus therapy will be needed to maintain symptom management. Both mild and deep levels of sedation may be used to provide relief from suffering, with deeper levels used when death is imminent and a catastrophic event has occurred.

The person being treated will be monitored during palliative sedation to maintain adequate symptom relief, but the following clinical situations will determine a need for dose titration:

* Person is at end-of-life: Vitals are not monitored except for respiratory rate to assess respiratory distress and tachypnea. The goal is to achieve comfort, so downward titration of sedation is not recommended due to risk of recurrent distress.
* Person is nearing end-of-life: Vitals such as heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation, are monitored to maintain physiological stability through sedation. Depending on the risk of a person to have respiratory depression or become unstable, the treatment dose may need to be adjusted or a benzodiazepine antagonist may be administered.
* Suffering managed and symptom controlled: Sedation may be carefully lowered for lucidity. This would provide possibility of reevaluating the person&#x27;s preferences for care or allow family communication.

==Nutrition and fluids==
As people undergoing terminal sedation are typically in the last hours or days of their lives, they are not usually eating or drinking significant amounts. There have not been any conclusive studies to demonstrate benefit to initiating artificial nutrition (TPN, tube feedings, etc.) or artificial hydration (subcutaneous or intravenous fluids). There is also a risk that IV fluids or feedings can worsen symptoms, especially respiratory secretions and pulmonary congestion. If the goal of palliative sedation is comfort, IV fluids and feedings are often not consistent with this goal.

A specialized rectal catheter can provide an immediate way to administer small volumes of liquids for people in the home setting when the oral route is compromised. Unlike intravenous lines, which usually need to be placed in a hospital environment, the rectal catheter can be placed by a clinician, such as a hospice nurse or home health nurse, in the home. This is useful for people who cannot swallow, including those near the end of life.

Before initiating terminal sedation, a discussion about the risks, benefits and goals of nutrition and fluids is encouraged, and is mandatory in the United Kingdom.

==Sedation vs. euthanasia==

Titrated sedation might speed up death, although death is considered a side effect and sedation does not equate with euthanasia. A survey of 663 physicians in the United States, found half had an experience of their treatment being characterised as murder, euthanasia, or killing in the preceding five years with palliative sedation (along with stopping of hydration and nutrition) being the most common act in palliative care interpreted as killing.

The primary difference between palliative sedation, relief of severe pain and symptoms, and euthanasia (the intentional ending of a person&#x27;s life) is both their intent and their outcome. At the end of life sedation is only used if the individuals perceives their distress to be unbearable, and there are no other means of relieving that distress. The intended goal is to provide them some relief of their suffering through the use of benzodiazepines and other agents which inadvertently may increase the risk of death. Studies have been conducted however, showing that the risk of death through palliative sedation is much lower than earlier perceived. This has raised the argument that palliative sedation does not cause or hasten death and that an individual&#x27;s death following palliative sedation is more likely to be due to their the measure of success of palliative sedation remains relief of a person&#x27;s symptoms until their end of life. On the other hand, euthanasia is performed with the intent to permanently relieve the person of their pain through the measure of success being their death.

In palliative care, the doses of sedatives are titrated (&quot;i.e.&quot;, varied) to keep the individual comfortable without compromising respiration or hastening death. Death typically results from the underlying medical condition.

People (or their legal representatives) only have the right to refuse treatments in living wills; however the demand of life saving treatments, or any treatments at all is controversial among states and heavily depends on each specific situation. However, once unconsciousness begins, as the person is no longer able to decide to stop the sedation or to request food or water, the clinical team can make decisions for the individual. A living will made when competent, can, under UK law, give a directive that the person refuses &quot;Palliative Care&quot; or &quot;Terminal Sedation&quot;, or &quot;any drug likely to suppress my respiration.&quot;

The use of sedation for palliative care in the UK was considered as part of an independent review of the Liverpool Care Pathway for the Dying Patient. Families of patients in some instances said that they thought the doses of sedatives prevented patients from asking for water leading to death from dehydration, there were many accounts of subcutaneous infusions being started as a matter of course rather than to control a specific symptom, there were many reports of patients being left alone for a short period of time by their families only to find that sedation had been administered leaving them unable to speak to their relatives; relatives and carers reported instances where they felt that the administration of morphine had directly led to the death of a patient.

=== Physician-assisted Suicide ===
As of 2022, assisted suicide in the United States, otherwise known as medical aid in dying, is legal in ten jurisdictions (California, Colorado, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, New Jersey, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington).

== Epidemiology ==

=== Prevalence ===
In a review of research articles on various aspects of palliative care, the prevalence of palliative sedation was reported as highly varied. In palliative care units or hospice, the prevalence ranged between 51%. In the home care setting, two Italian studies reported a prevalence of 25% and 52.5%. Hospital-based palliative support teams vary in prevalence, with reports of 1.33% and also 26%. Different countries also report large differences in prevalence of palliative sedation:

A 2009 survey of almost 4000 U.K. people whose care had followed the Liverpool Care Pathway for the Dying Patient found that while 31% had received low doses of medication to control distress from agitation or restlessness, only 4% had required higher doses.

Almost half of the studies reviewed differentiated intermittent versus continuous palliative sedation. The prevalence of intermittent sedation was 67% of cases and continuous sedation was 68% of cases. People starting intermittent sedation may progress to use of continuous sedation in 27% of cases. The prevalence of mild versus deep sedation was also reported: one study reported 51% of cases used mild sedation and 49% deep sedation; a second study reported 80% of cases used mild sedation and 20% deep sedation.

=== Survival ===
There are reports that after initiation of palliative sedation, 38% of people died within 24 hours and 96% of people died within one week. Other studies report a survival time of &lt; 3 weeks in 94% of people after starting palliative sedation. Some physicians estimate that this practice shortens life by ≤24 hours for 40% of people and &gt; 1 week for 27% of people. Another study reported people receiving sedation in their last week of life survived longer than those who did not receive sedation, or only received sedation during last 48 hours of life.

According to 2009 research, 16.5% of all deaths in the United Kingdom during 2007–2008 took place after continuous deep sedation.

== History of hospice ==

=== U.S. hospice care movement ===

Hospice care emphasizes palliative, rather than curative, treatment to support individuals during end-of-life care when all other alternatives have been exhausted. It differs vastly from other forms of healthcare because both the person and the family are included in all decision-making and aims to treat the individual, not the disease.
The Hospice Care Movement began in the United States during the 1960s and was influenced heavily on the model published by St. Christopher&#x27;s Hospice of London located in Great Britain. Despite differing setting, services, and staffing, the U.S. hospice care movement still sought to maintain the goals and philosophy of St. Christopher&#x27;s model which centered on symptom control to allow the person to die with freedom, rather than attempting curative treatment.

The first Hospice in the United States, Connecticut Hospice, was founded by Florence Wald and opened in 1974. Supporters of the movement faced many challenges early on, the biggest being the lack of insurance coverage for hospice care services. Initiatives to increase public awareness of the movement were created to combat this obstacle and supply the movement with public funding in order to maintain their services. One of the greatest accomplishments made by the movement was in the inclusion of hospice care in services covered under Medicare in 1982. This victory prompted the creation of National Hospice Week by President Reagan to take place from November 7–14 as a form of recognition to the vital impact nurses and caregivers have on these individuals and their families. Less than five decades after the first hospice program began, there are now over 4,000 programs in place under the umbrella of a multi-billion dollar industry. The cumulative budget for hospice programs nationwide increased from 10 million in the late 1970s, to 2.8 billion dollars in 1995, and 10 billion in 2008.

==Policies==
===United States===
In 2008, the American Medical Association Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs approved an ethical policy regarding the practice of palliative sedation. There is no specific law in barring the practice of palliative sedation, and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops is reported to accept the practice of keeping people pain-free at end of life.

===Sweden===
In October 2010 Svenska Läkaresällskapet, the Swedish medical association, published guidelines which allowed for palliative sedation to be administered even with the intent of the terminally ill person not to reawaken.

<doc id="685766" wikidata="Q441476" url="?curid=685766" title="RAF Bruggen">
<text>Royal Air Force Brüggen, more commonly known as RAF Brüggen, in Germany was a Royal Air Force station until 15 June 2001. It was situated next to the village of Elmpt, approximately west of Düsseldorf on the Dutch–German border. The base was named after the village of Brüggen, the nearest rail depot. Construction began in mid-1952, which involved the clearing of forest and draining of marshland. The station became active in 1953 during the rapid expansion of NATO forces in Europe.
The main paint shop situated next to the main runway was responsible for the surface finishing of all aircraft, ground equipment and RAF Regiment Rapier missile systems. In 2002, it was handed over to the British Army and renamed Javelin Barracks.

==317 Supply and Transport Column==
In 1953, the 317 Supply and Transport Column arrived at RAF Brüggen from Uetersen. This followed the decision to supply all RAF stations in Germany through the port of Antwerp. In 1954 the unit was redesignated as a Mechanical Transport Squadron and was responsible for equipping and supplying all RAF stations in Germany and The Netherlands. The unit remained at Brüggen until 1963, when it was amalgamated into the No. 431 Maintenance Unit RAF which continued to operate until 1993. The demise of 317 MT Squadron marked the end of an era, as it had been on the continent shortly after D-Day under its previous title of 317 Supply &amp; Transport Column. It had built itself an enviable reputation and following the cessation of hostilities carried out convoys to Prague, Warsaw and Moscow. In the 1950 Review of the Royal Air Force, the unit was described as the Carter Paterson of the autobahns.

Throughout its life, 317 carried out a number of humanitarian operations; the first being medical supplies to Bergen-Belsen. This was followed in 1947 by &quot;Operation Woodpecker&quot; in which timber and peat were supplied to the civilian population of northern Germany in one of the coldest winters on record.
This was followed by the return of displaced persons and POWs to their home towns and cities within the British Zone.
They were called upon again at the start of the Berlin Airlift (&quot;Operation Plain Fare&quot;), and lastly, in the winter of 1962/3, the Squadron took a convoy of fuel trucks to the oil refineries in Rotterdam for heating oil which was delivered to hospitals in Germany during the great freeze when the canals were inoperable.

==1954–1998 – Strike/attack role==

From 1954–1957 the fighter squadrons at Bruggen were 67, 71E, 112 &amp; 130, equipped initially with Canadair Sabre F.4s, later re-equipped with the Hawker Hunter F.4s. These squadrons were either redeployed or disbanded in 1957 with the arrival of 87 Squadron, equipped with Gloster Javelin FAW.1s. The initial strike capability at RAF Brüggen was provided by the English Electric Canberra from the summer of 1957. From 1969 to 1975 the Phantom FGR.2 operated in the strike/attack role and was replaced by the SEPECAT Jaguar GR.1 from 9 April 1975. The Jaguars were replaced by the Panavia Tornado GR.1 beginning on 13 June 1984. With a total of four Tornado GR.1 squadrons at Brüggen and four more at its nearby sister airbase RAF Laarbruch, Brüggen and Laarbruch formed the largest Tornado force in NATO. Hardened Aircraft Shelters were equipped with the U.S. Weapon Storage Security System (WS3), each able to store up to 4 WE.177 tactical nuclear bombs, for delivery by Tornado aircraft.

===1984 – Nuclear incident===
On 4 September 2007, the British military admitted that there had been an accident with a nuclear weapon at RAF Brüggen on 2 May 1984. The nuclear weapon fell from a transport truck, as the missile wasn&#x27;t securely attached to the truck. The weapon was eight times more powerful than the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. The casing was X-rayed after the incident, and found to have been undamaged. The six people who were responsible for the accident received a reprimand for their actions in the incident.

==1998–2001 – Attack role==
Following reunification of Germany, the RAF announced plans to reduce its presence in the country by half. One major part of this was the reduction of Tornado squadrons in Germany from seven to four, No.9, No.14, No.17 and No.31 squadrons. No.9, No.14 and No.31 squadrons took part in the Gulf War, and later operated from Bruggen during NATO&#x27;s air operations in the Kosovo War, supported by Vickers VC10 tankers.

The decision to remove all RAF assets from Germany was taken in 1996. As a result of the Strategic Defence Review No. 17 Squadron disbanded on 31 March 1999 and began the gradual drawdown of the base. No. 14 Sqn relocated to RAF Lossiemouth in January 2001. A formal ceremony on 15 June officially ended a continuous Royal Air Force presence in Germany since World War II and all of the remaining Tornados had left for RAF Marham by 4 September 2001.

<text>Wilson Turbinton (February 6, 1944 – September 11, 2007), professionally known as Willie Tee, was an American keyboardist, songwriter, singer, producer and notable early architect of New Orleans funk and soul, who helped shape the sound of New Orleans for more than four decades.

==Career==
Tee arranged, co-wrote and led the band on the Wild Magnolias&#x27; self-titled 1974 debut album. The popularity of that recording, and the subsequent &quot;They Call Us Wild&quot;, introduced the Mardi Gras Indians&#x27; street-beat funk to the world.

Tee grew up in the Calliope Projects in New Orleans. His earliest influences ranged from the rhythm and blues of Professor Longhair to the jazz of John Coltrane.

He made his first recordings for the local AFO Records in 1962 while still a teenager. Three years later, he cut &quot;Teasin&#x27; You&quot;, a soulful, mid-tempo composition for Atlantic Records. His &quot;Walking Up a One-Way Street&quot; and &quot;Thank You John&quot; were also popular hits.

In the late 1960s, Willie Tee &amp; the Souls played venues from the Apollo Theater in Harlem to the Ivanhoe on Bourbon Street. After hearing the band at the Ivanhoe in 1968, jazz musician Cannonball Adderley encouraged Tee to record an instrumental album. The album was never released, but the master tapes were recently rediscovered in the vaults of Capitol Records. Tee&#x27;s pop was called expressive, his funk ferocious and his jazz &quot;like mirrors in a prism&quot; by longtime producer Leo Sacks, who called Willie Tee &quot;a monster on the B-3 organ&quot; in a Times-Picayune article.

Tee&#x27;s early recordings, many of which were reissued by New York&#x27;s Tuff City Records, were employed as source material for rappers. Houston&#x27;s Geto Boys sampled &quot;Smoke My Peace Pipe&quot;, a song Tee had written for the Wild Magnolias. Sean Combs borrowed riffs and grooves from the Gaturs&#x27; &quot;Concentrate&quot; for the 1997 album &quot;No Way Out&quot;. Alex Chilton also recorded a version of &quot;Thank You John&quot; in the 1980s, and Russell Minus completed a suite of elegies in 1996.

More recently, New Orleans rapper Lil Wayne sampled &quot;Moment of Truth&quot;, a song from Turbinton&#x27;s 1976 album, &quot;Anticipation&quot; for &quot;Tha Mobb&quot;, the opening track on &quot;Tha Carter II&quot;.

Tee remained active in his career as a producer, songwriter, performer and session musician. His collaborations with his brother Earl included 1988&#x27;s &quot;Brothers for Life&quot;. He contributed to Dr. John&#x27;s 2004 album, &quot;N&#x27;Awlinz: Dis Dat or D&#x27;Udda&quot;, and appeared briefly in the Oscar-winning Jamie Foxx film about Ray Charles, &quot;Ray&quot;.

In October 2005, after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, Turbinton accepted a job as a visiting lecturer in the music department at Princeton University, and spent the next four months working with music students there. In January 2006, he returned to Louisiana and settled in Baton Rouge.

In April 2007, the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame honored Tee for his contributions to Louisiana music with an induction.

Tee died on September 11, 2007, aged 63, four weeks after being diagnosed with colon cancer.

<text>A shoe-last celt (German: &quot;Schuhleistenkeil&quot;) is a long thin polished stone tool for felling trees and woodworking, characteristic of the early Neolithic Linearbandkeramik and Hinkelstein cultures, also called Danubian I in the older literature.

==Appearance==
The tools are square in profile with a rounded top, which is why they are compared with shoe makers&#x27; lasts. The preferred material is amphibolite; basalt is also used.

==Typology==

In regards to the typology of neolithic adzes, initially two types were distinguished,
When width exceeds thickness they were named flat adzes (&quot;Flachhacke&quot;), when thickness exceeds width shoe-last adzes (&quot;Schuhleistenkeile&quot;), or &quot;high adzes&quot;. Within the latter group a distinction is sometimes made between intermediate &quot;Flomborn&quot; adzes and the higher &quot;Hinkelstein&quot; adzes (Buttler 1938; Bakels 1987; Merkel 1999). Later, subdivisions were made on the basis of metric characteristics into two groups (Schietzel 1965), six groups (Modderman 1970, 184) and finally two groups again (Dohrn-Ihmig 1983). All typologies were based on the width-height ratio, while Modderman added the absolute dimension. The wide variation, from small to large and from flat to high adzes, certainly reflects a functional differentiation, but the various types do not appear to be of chronological significance.
==Use==
The polished stone axe or adze introduced a new way of life to Central Europe in mid-sixth millennium BC. It was a tool that was necessary for the clearing of the land to create fields and to build houses. These adzes were also used for the manufacture of agricultural tools, and any other wooden objects.

Shape and wear show that the celts were used as adzes to fell trees and to work wood. Some blades have traces of hafting as well. The finds from the wells of Kückhoven and Eythra in Germany demonstrate a high standard of carpentry. Shoe-last celts have also been used as weapons, as attested by smashed skulls from Schletz (Austria) and Talheim, Neckar (Germany). An older theory suggests their use as hoes, but there are no wear traces to support this.

Towards the end of the Linear Pottery Culture, around 5000 BC, the first perforated tools appear.

<doc id="685774" wikidata="Q3417499" url="?curid=685774" title="Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson (fl. 1164)">
<text>Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson (fl. 1164) was a twelfth-century King of the Isles, succeeding the warrior Somerled. He was a son of Óláfr Guðrøðarson, King of the Isles and a member of the Crovan dynasty. In the 1153, Óláfr was assassinated by three nephews, before his son, Guðrøðr, was able to overcome them and succeed his father as king. By 1158, Guðrøðr was forced from power by his brother-in-law, Somairle mac Gilla Brigte, who was married to Óláfr&#x27;s daughter Ragnhildr. In 1164, when Somairle was killed in an invasion of Scotland, and while Guðrøðr was away in exile overseas, Rǫgnvaldr briefly seized the kingship for himself, before being overcome by Guðrøðr, who had him blinded and mutilated.

==Background==

Rǫgnvaldr was a son of Óláfr Guðrøðarson, King of the Isles. The men were members of the Crovan dynasty. According to the thirteenth- to fourteenth-century &quot;Chronicle of Mann&quot;, Óláfr was married to Affraic, daughter of Fergus, Lord of Galloway. According to this source, Óláfr and Affraic had a son, Guðrøðr. Óláfr is further stated to have had many concubines by whom he had several daughters and three sons: Rǫgnvaldr himself, Lǫgmaðr, and Haraldr. One of Óláfr&#x27;s daughters is stated by the chronicle to have married Somairle mac Gilla Brigte, Lord of Argyll. Although this daughter is not named by the chronicle, she is identified as Ragnhildr by the thirteenth-century &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot;.

In 1153, the thirteenth- to fourteenth-century &quot;Chronicle of Mann&quot; reports that Óláfr was assassinated by three nephews whilst Guðrøðr was absent in Norway. Within months of his father&#x27;s assassination, Guðrøðr executed his vengeance. According to the chronicle, he journeyed from Norway to Orkney, enstrengthened by Norwegian military support, and was unanimously acclaimed as king by the leading Islesmen. He is then stated to have continued on to Mann, where he overcame his father&#x27;s three killers, putting one to death whilst blinding the other two, and successfully secured the kingship for himself.

In 1155 or 1156, the chronicle reveals that Somairle conducted a coup against Guðrøðr, specifying that Somairle&#x27;s son, Dubgall, was produced as a replacement to Guðrøðr&#x27;s rule. Late in 1156, Somairle and Guðrøðr finally clashed in a bloody but inconclusive sea-battle. According to the chronicle, when the clash finally concluded the feuding brothers-in-law divided the Kingdom of the Isles between themselves. Two years later, the chronicle reveals that Somairle invaded Mann and drove Guðrøðr from the kingship into exile. With Guðrøðr gone, it appears that either Dubgall or Somairle became King of the Isles. Although the young Dubgall may well have been the nominal monarch, the chronicle makes it clear that it was Somairle who possessed the real power. Certainly, Irish sources regard Somairle as a king by the end of his career.

==Reign==

Somairle lost his life in a failed invasion of Scotland in 1164. Although it is possible that Dubgall was able to secure power following his father&#x27;s demise, it is evident that the kingship was seized by Rǫgnvaldr within the year. According to the chronicle, his reign began after he defeated a force of Manxmen at Ramsey. Almost immediately afterwards, Guðrøðr made his return, with the chronicle reporting that Guðrøðr arrived on Mann with a large body of men, overpowered Rǫgnvaldr, having him mutilated and blinded. Guðrøðr thereafter regained the kingship, and the realm was divided between him and Somairle&#x27; descendants, in a partitioning that stemmed from Somairle&#x27;s coup in 1156.

Centered on Silesia in Poland, eastern Germany, and the northern Czech Republic, it overlaps with the Lengyel horizon to the south and the Rössen culture to the west.

==Description==
The STbK and the Notenkopfkeramik (Musical Note pottery) are a development of the LBK. Much it features incised zig-zag bands going around the pot, with punctures at the line segment junctions. The STK abandons incision in favor bands of small punctures, also in zig-zag patterns, with a vertical band dividing each angle. The effect is a band pattern of contiguous A-frames.

Where the Musical Note pottery expanded east over the Bug River, the STK moved down the Vistula and Elbe. The spread of this style must have been basically the transmission of cultural objects.
The homes of the STK people show a slight modification that became a major feature of later cultures: one end of the long house was made shorter than the other to achieve a trapezoidal shape. The reason for this modification remains obscure. Also, the STK people developed a preference for cremation rather than burial. The preceding early LBK had used both methods.

==Goseck circle==

An unusual structure associated with STK has been found at Goseck, southwest of Berlin in Saxony-Anhalt : a large, double concentric ring of post holes pierced by gates and surrounded by a circular ditch. The placement of the gates and some of the posts lead some investigators to hypothesize an observatory similar to Stonehenge, but in wood rather than stone; i.e., the posts mark some positions of celestial bodies.

<text>James Spencer Courier (born August 17, 1970) is an American former professional tennis player. He was ranked as the world No. 1 in men&#x27;s singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for 58 weeks, including as the year-end No. 1 in 1992. Courier won 23 ATP Tour-level singles titles, including four majors – two at the French Open and two at the Australian Open – and was the youngest man in the Open Era to reach the final of all four singles majors, aged 22 years and 11 months. He also won five Masters titles and was part of the victorious United States Davis Cup teams in 1992 and 1995.

Since 2005, Courier has worked as a tennis commentator, notably for Nine (and previously Seven), the host broadcaster of the Australian Open. He is also an analyst for Tennis Channel and Prime Video Sport.

==Tennis career==
Courier was raised in Dade City, Florida, and though he excelled at youth sports in general, after a certain point it became clear that tennis was where his true talent lay. As a junior player in the 1980s, Courier attended the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy and won the prestigious Orange Bowl in 1986 and 1987 (the first to win back-to-back titles since Ivan Lendl), as well as the French Open junior doubles title in 1987.

Courier turned professional in 1988 and made his Grand Slam breakthrough at the 1991 French Open when he defeated Stefan Edberg and Michael Stich to reach his first Grand Slam final. In the final he defeated his former Bollettieri Academy roommate Andre Agassi in five sets to win his first Slam. He made the quarterfinals of Wimbledon before losing to eventual champion Stich. At the US Open he defeated defending champion Pete Sampras in the quarterfinals and then Jimmy Connors in the semifinals, before losing the final to Edberg.

1992 saw Courier defeat Edberg to win the Australian Open, and he celebrated by jumping into the nearby Yarra River. He then followed this result by defeating future Grand Slam champions Thomas Muster, Goran Ivanišević, Agassi and Petr Korda to successfully defend his French Open title. Afterward, Courier charmed the Parisian crowd by delivering a victory speech in French. Courier also enjoyed a 25-match winning streak during the season. In February of that year, following the San Francisco tournament, he became the tenth player to reach the world no. 1 ranking since the ranking system was implemented in 1973, and the first American since John McEnroe; he finished 1992 as the world no. 1 ranked player. Courier also was a member of the US team that won the 1992 Davis Cup. In 1992 he was the top-seeded player at the Olympics in Barcelona, where he lost in the third round to eventual gold medalist Marc Rosset from Switzerland.

In 1993, Courier again won the Australian Open, defeating Edberg in the final for the second consecutive year, and jumped into the Yarra a second time, but it was to be his last such celebration after contracting a stomach bug from the muddy and polluted river. He reached his third consecutive French Open final, which he lost to Sergi Bruguera in five sets. He also reached the 1993 Wimbledon final, defeating Edberg in the semifinals, and lost to Sampras in four sets. By reaching the Wimbledon final, Courier had reached the finals of all four Grand Slams at the age of 22, a record which still stands in men&#x27;s singles. Courier also became the first player since Rod Laver to reach the finals of the Australian, French and Wimbledon in the same season; the feat was not matched until 2006 by Roger Federer. Courier again was part of the US team that won the 1995 Davis Cup.

Courier captured a total of 23 singles titles and 6 doubles titles during his career. He spent a total of 58 weeks ranked as the World No. 1 in 1992 and 1993. He reached the finals of all four major championships during his career, a feat accomplished by only seven other male players in the Open Era. Courier retired from the ATP tour in 2000. He was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2005.

Courier returned to the tour at the 2005 U.S. Men&#x27;s Clay Court Championships when he received a wildcard into the doubles draw partnering Andre Agassi. The pair lost in the first round to eventual finalists Martín García and Luis Horna in three sets. It would be the last match of Courier&#x27;s career.

==After retirement from top-level tennis==
Since his retirement as a top-level player, Courier has served as a tennis analyst and commentator for the Tennis Channel, USA Network, NBC Sports, TNT, ITV, Sky Sports and the Seven and Nine Networks. Since 2005, Courier has headed the commentary for the domestic host broadcaster of the Australian Open, which was Seven from 2005 to 2018 and Nine since 2019. Courier calls many centre court men&#x27;s singles matches for the network and often conducts the post-match on-court interviews with the winning player. He also provided special comments on the Seven Network&#x27;s Wimbledon coverage between 2013 and 2019. Courier started working with the British channel ITV for the French Open in 2012. In 2015, Courier worked with the British channel Sky Sports for their US Open coverage. The Jim Courier Club House now stands on the grounds of the Dade City Little League complex in John S. Burks Memorial Park in Dade City, Florida. Courier is an alumnus of that Little League program.

In 2004, Courier founded InsideOut Sport &amp; Entertainment, a New York-based event production company that owns and operates the Champions Series, Legendary Nights exhibitions as well as private corporate events.

He also founded Courier&#x27;s Kids, a non-profit organization that supports tennis programs in the inner city of St. Petersburg, Florida.

Courier currently competes on the Champions Series and in various charity exhibition matches.

Courier married Susanna Lingman in 2010.

On October 27, 2010, Courier was named captain of the United States Davis Cup team, replacing Patrick McEnroe. Courier stepped down from the role after the 2018 semi-final defeat to Croatia. Courier led his country with a 10–8 record and two semi-final appearances during his captaincy.

In August 2019, Courier was working for Prime Video UK, for their exclusive coverage of the US Open.

In 2022, he co-presented popular Australian reality show Ninja Warrior for the Nine Network, whom he also works for on their Australian Open coverage each local summer.

<doc id="685783" wikidata="Q3350138" url="?curid=685783" title="Olaf the Black">
<text>Óláfr Guðrøðarson (died 1237) (Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Amhlaibh Dubh&quot;), also known as Olaf the Black, was a thirteenth-century King of the Isles, and a member of the Crovan dynasty. He was a son of Guðrøðr Óláfsson, King of the Isles and Fionnghuala Nic Lochlainn. Óláfr was a younger son of his father; Óláfr&#x27;s elder brother, Rǫgnvaldr, probably had a different mother. According to the &quot;Chronicle of Mann&quot;, Guðrøðr appointed Óláfr as heir since he had been born &quot;in lawful wedlock&quot;. Whether or not this is the case, after Guðrøðr&#x27;s death in 1187 the Islesmen instead appointed Rǫgnvaldr as king, as he was a capable adult and Óláfr was a mere child. Rǫgnvaldr ruled the island-kingdom for almost forty years, during which time the half-brothers vied for the kingship.

Óláfr appears to have held authority on the island of Lewis and Harris. At some point, Óláfr appears to have confronted Rǫgnvaldr for a larger stake in the kingdom, after which Rǫgnvaldr had him seized and imprisoned by William the Lion, King of Scotland. Upon his release in 1214/1215, Óláfr is stated to have undertaken a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, after which the half-brothers were reconciled, and Rǫgnvaldr had Óláfr married to Lauon, the sister of his own wife. In what appears to have been a politically motivated maneuver, Óláfr had his marriage declared null by Reginald, Bishop of the Isles, and proceeded to marry Cairistíona, a daughter of Fearchar, Earl of Ross. Whilst Lauon appears to have been a member of Clann Somhairle, a kindred led by Ruaidhrí mac Raghnaill, a man closely aligned with Rǫgnvaldr and opposed to the Scottish Crown, Cairistíona was the daughter of a rising Scottish magnate.

In 1223, Óláfr&#x27;s marital actions are stated to have precipitated Rǫgnvaldr&#x27;s son, Guðrøðr Dond, to attack Óláfr on Lewis and Harris, driving him into Ross to the safety of his father-in-law. Together with Páll Bálkason, Óláfr later defeated Guðrøðr Dond on Skye. The following year, Óláfr confronted Rǫgnvaldr on Mann, and the two partitioned of the kingdom between themselves. One of Rǫgnvaldr&#x27;s allied against Óláfr was Alan fitz Roland, Lord of Galloway, who is recorded to have campaigned in the Isles against Óláfr. There is reason to suspect that Óláfr was conversely aligned with Alan&#x27;s opponent in Ireland, Hugh de Lacy, Earl of Ulster. In 1226, Rǫgnvaldr and Alan orchestrated the marriage of a daughter of Rǫgnvaldr to Alan&#x27;s bastard son, Thomas, a union that led the Islesmen to depose Rǫgnvaldr in favour of Óláfr. In 1229, Rǫgnvaldr invaded Mann, and was killed in battle against Óláfr.

In 1230, Óláfr was forced from his kingdom to Norway by Alan and members of Clann Somhairle. In response to this latest bout of warfare in the Isles, Hákon Hákonarson, King of Norway decided to send a royal fleet into the Isles, under the command of Óspakr, an apparent member of Clann Somhairle. When Óspakr was slain early in the campaign, Óláfr took control of the fleet and secured himself on Mann. At this point, the kingdom appears to have been partitioned between him and Guðrøðr Dond, with the latter ruling the Hebridean portion and Óláfr ruling Mann itself. In 1231, after the Norwegian fleet left Isles, Guðrøðr Dond was slain, and Óláfr ruled the whole Kingdom of the Isles peacefully, until his death in 1237. Óláfr&#x27;s restoration was seen as a success by the Norwegians, and likely favourably viewed by the Scots as well. Óláfr was succeeded by his son, Haraldr. In all, three of Óláfr&#x27;s sons ruled the Crovan dynasty&#x27;s island-kingdom—the last of which, Magnús, was also the last of the dynasty to rule.

==Uncertain inheritance==

Óláfr was a member of the Crovan dynasty, and a son of Guðrøðr Óláfsson, King of Dublin and the Isles. Óláfr&#x27;s mother was Fionnghuala Nic Lochlainn. Guðrøðr had several other children: Affrica, Rǫgnvaldr, and Ívarr. Other possible children include Ruaidhrí, and a daughter whose name is unknown. According to the thirteenth-century &quot;Chronicle of Mann&quot;, Óláfr&#x27;s mother was Fionnghuala Nic Lochlainn, granddaughter of Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn, High King of Ireland. She was probably a daughter of Muirchertach&#x27;s son, Niall Mac Lochlainn, King of Cineál Eoghain. Although Óláfr&#x27;s parentage is known, the maternal ancestry of Rǫgnvaldr is less certain. She may have been Sadbh, an Irishwoman identified as his mother by a contemporary Gaelic praise poem. The likelihood that Rǫgnvaldr and Óláfr had different mothers may well explain the intense conflict between the two men in the years that followed.

The chronicle reveals that the marriage between Guðrøðr and Fionnghuala was formalised in 1176/1177, under the auspices of a visiting papal legate. Before Guðrøðr&#x27;s death in 1187, the chronicle claims that he left instructions for Óláfr to succeed to the kingship since the latter had been born &quot;in lawful wedlock&quot;. This statement could indicate that Óláfr was born just before or immediately after his parents&#x27; marriage. The chronicle certainly states that Óláfr was born before the legate formalised his parents&#x27; marriage, suggesting that the union existed for some time prior. This source, however, gives conflicting dates for Óláfr&#x27;s birth: 1173 and 1177. Specifically, in its account of his parents marriage, the chronicle states that Óláfr was three years old; and in its account of his father&#x27;s death, Óláfr is said to have been only ten.

If the chronicle&#x27;s account of Óláfr&#x27;s stake in the kingship is to be believed, it could indicate that Guðrøðr attempted to legitimise the royal succession through his canonical marriage to Fionnghuala. However, this source appears to date to the reign of Óláfr&#x27;s son, Magnús, and there is reason to suspect that it source was compiled in the context of an attempt to legitimise Óláfr&#x27;s branch of the Crovan dynasty over that of Rǫgnvaldr. As such, the chronicle appears to be biased towards Óláfr&#x27;s line, and its account of Guðrøðr&#x27;s succession may not objective. Whether the chronicle is accurate in its account of the succession is uncertain, as the Islesmen are stated to have chosen Rǫgnvaldr to rule instead, because unlike Óláfr, who was only a child at the time, Rǫgnvaldr was a hardy young man fully capable to reign as king. Furthermore, the fact that Rǫgnvaldr appears to have held power in the Hebrides at the time of Guðrøðr&#x27;s death could indicate that it was Rǫgnvaldr who had been the acknowledged heir. Another possibility, suggested by the chronicle and latter correspondence between Óláfr and the English Crown, is that Rǫgnvaldr&#x27;s tenure had been originally intended as temporary wardship until Óláfr was able to reign himself.

==Hebridean magnate==

Rǫgnvaldr succeeded Guðrøðr as king in 1188. At some point after assuming control of the kingdom, the chronicle reports that Rǫgnvaldr gave Óláfr possession of a certain island called &quot;&quot;. The chronicle disparagingly describes the island as being mountainous and rocky, completely unsuitable for cultivation, and declares that its small population lived mostly by hunting and fishing. Although is an early Latin form of the place name of Lewis—the rather flat and boggy northerly half of the Outer Hebridean island of Lewis and Harris—the chronicle&#x27;s text seems to instead refer to Harris—the somewhat mountainous southerly half. The chronicle claims that, because of the impoverishment of his lands, Óláfr was unable to support himself and his followers, and that in consequence he led &quot;a poor sort of life&quot;. There is reason to suspect that the chronicle&#x27;s otherwise perceptible prejudice against Rǫgnvaldr&#x27;s branch of the Crovan dynasty, and its apparent bias in favour of Mann over the northernmost reaches of the realm, may also account for its denigrating depiction of Óláfr&#x27;s allotted lands.

In consequence of this supposed poverty, the chronicle claims that Óláfr went to Rǫgnvaldr, who was also living in the Hebrides, and confronted him for more land. Rǫgnvaldr&#x27;s stated response was to have Óláfr seized and sent to William I, King of Scotland, who kept him imprisoned for almost seven years. It is possible that, at this stage of his career, Óláfr acted as an under-king to Rǫgnvaldr, and sought to increase his share of power. There is reason to suspect that, following Óláfr&#x27;s inability to make a deal with Rǫgnvaldr, Óláfr approached Ingi Bárðarson, King of Norway, and offered himself as a more palatable vassal-king in return for Norwegian support in deposing Rǫgnvaldr. In 1210, Rǫgnvaldr himself appears to have travelled to Norway, as evinced by a version of the thirteenth-century &quot;Bǫglunga sǫgur&quot;, in a journey that could well have been an attempt to further cement his position in the Isles, and counter Óláfr&#x27;s claims to the throne, by formally submitting to the Norwegian king. In any case, the chronicle states that William died during the seventh year of Óláfr&#x27;s captivity, and that William had ordered the release of all his political prisoners before his passing. Since William died in December 1214, Óláfr&#x27;s incarceration appears to have spanned between about 1207/1208 and 1214/1215. Upon his release, the chronicle reveals that the half-brothers met on Mann, after which Óláfr set off on a pilgrimage with his followers to Santiago de Compostela.

Óláfr&#x27;s time in the Isles is confirmed by several Icelandic sources—the sagas of Hrafn Sveinbjarnarson (an Icelandic chieftain) and Guðmundr Arason (an Icelandic ecclesiast)—which recount how, in 1202, Guðmundr attempted to sail from Iceland to Norway to become consecrated as the Bishop of Hólar. For example, the thirteenth-century &quot;Hrafns saga Sveinbjarnarsonar&quot; relates that the wayfaring Icelanders encountered a severe storm and were blown far off course before being forced to make landfall in the Hebrides. The saga identifies the island they landed upon as &quot;&quot;, which may well refer to Sanday, a tiny tidal island linked to its larger neighbour Canna, the westernmost island of the Small Isles. The sandy flat that joins the islands together forms one of the best natural harbours in the Hebrides.

According to &quot;Hrafns saga Sveinbjarnarsonar&quot;, the Icelanders were met by an official of a local king named Óláfr who attempted to collect a landing-tax from them. Afterwards, whilst the Icelanders were at church, the king is said to have personally invited the bishop-elect to dine with him. Guðmundr is then said to have refused the king, after which the latter forbade them to leave. Although the Icelanders are reported to have taken up arms, they eventually caved to the king before being allowed to set sail for Norway. The king encountered by the Icelanders was probably Óláfr himself, although it is not certain that the Crovan dynasty controlled the Small Isles at this point in history. One possibility is that Óláfr, like the Icelanders, may have been temporarily stranded on the tidal island, and that he may have taken advantage of the storm-stricken churchmen to offset the poverty that is assigned to him by the chronicle.

==Marriage to Lauon==

Upon Óláfr&#x27;s return from his pilgrimage, the chronicle records that Rǫgnvaldr had Óláfr marry &quot;&quot;, the sister of his own wife. Rǫgnvaldr then granted back to Óláfr, where the newly-weds proceeded to live until the arrival of Reginald, Bishop of the Isles. The chronicle claims that the bishop disapproved of the marriage on the grounds that Óláfr had formerly had a concubine who was a cousin of Lauon. A synod was then assembled, after which the marriage is stated to have been nullified.

Although the identity of the half-brother&#x27;s father-in-law is uncertain, the chronicle describes him as a nobleman from Kintyre, which suggests that he was a member of Clann Somhairle, since sources concerning this kindred associate it with Kintyre more than any other region. As such, the father could have been either Raghnall mac Somhairle, or Raghnall&#x27;s son, Ruaidhrí—both of whom appear to have been styled &quot;Lord of Kintyre&quot; in contemporary sources—or possibly even Raghnall&#x27;s younger son, Domhnall.

It is conceivable that Rǫgnvaldr&#x27;s marriage was undertaken before 1210, perhaps not long after 1200 considering the fact that Guðrøðr Dond—a product of this union—was an adult by 1223 and had fathered at least one son by this date. Óláfr&#x27;s marriage to Lauon may have taken place in 1216. The binding of Rǫgnvaldr and Óláfr to Clann Somhairle wives could well have been orchestrated in an effort to patch up relations between the Crovan dynasty and Clann Somhairle, neighbouring kindreds that had bitterly contested the kingship of the Isles for about sixty years.

After the death of Aonghus mac Somhairle in 1210, the leading dynast of Clann Somhairle appears to have been Ruaidhrí. It is possible that, as a result of the marriage alliance between his family and the Crovan dynasty, Ruaidhrí acknowledged Rǫgnvaldr&#x27;s kingship, and thereby established himself as a leading magnate within a reunified Kingdom of the Isles. Since the majority of Ruaidhrí&#x27;s territories appear to have been mainland possessions, it is very likely that the Scottish Crown regarded this alliance and apparent reunification of the Isles as a threat to its own claims of overlordship of Argyll. In fact, it is possible that the Scots&#x27; release of Óláfr in 1214 was intended to cause dynastic discord in the Isles. If this was indeed the case, the reconciliation between the half-brothers ensured that the Scottish Crown&#x27;s machinations came to nought—at least temporarily.

==Marriage to Cairistíona==

Once freed from his arranged marriage to Lauon, the chronicle reports that Óláfr proceeded to marry Cairistíona, daughter of Fearchar mac an tSagairt. The union appears to have taken place in about 1222/1223. The father of Cairistíona emerges from historical obscurity in 1215. Seemingly by the mid 1220s—at about the time of Cairistíona and Óláfr&#x27;s marriage—Alexander II, King of Scotland rewarded Fearchar with the Earldom of Ross for meritorious service to the Scottish Crown. Although it is unknown if Fearchar received the earldom before his daughter&#x27;s marriage, his comital elevation—or foreknowledge of it—could well have precipitated the match.

There is certainly reason to suspect that the collapse of Óláfr&#x27;s marriage to Lauon, and his subsequent marriage to Cairistíona, was a politically motivated maneuver. In 1221/1222, Alexander seems to have overseen a series of invasions into Argyll. This royal campaign appears to have resulted in a local regime change, with Ruaidhrí being replaced by Domhnall in Kintyre. One of several factors that could account for Ruaidhrí&#x27;s expulsion is Scottish apprehension of a rejuvenated Kingdom of the Isles.

Immediately after its account of Óláfr&#x27;s marriage to Cairistíona, the chronicle details outright conflict between Óláfr and Rǫgnvaldr&#x27;s family. The fact that this outbreak of violence is specifically dated to 1223 could indicate that it was Ruaidhrí&#x27;s apparent downfall in Kintyre that led Óláfr to realign himself with Fearchar. By linking himself with Fearchar, Alexander&#x27;s leading lieutenant in the north, it would appear that Óláfr recognised a regional shift in power, and therefore attempted to bind himself to a rising star in Scotland, and extract himself from any liability connected to Lauon&#x27;s kin. Another apparent aftereffect of the Scots&#x27; invasion of Kintyre was the creation of the Clann Dubhghaill Lordship of Argyll, first evinced in 1225. If members of the Clann Dubhghaill branch of Clann Somhairle indeed began operating as agents of the Scottish Crown at about this time, it is possible that Óláfr—as a rival to the ruler of a reformed Kingdom of the Isles—acted as an agent of Scottish interests as well. As such, Óláfr&#x27;s marriage to Cairistíona may have ultimately stemmed from a Scottish desire to destabilise the Isles. If Lauon&#x27;s father was indeed Ruaidhrí, it is possible that Óláfr compensated the latter for his marriage by granting him lands or protection in the Isles. It is also possible that Ruaidhrí&#x27;s descendants—Clann Ruaidhrí—owed their later power in Garmoran and the Hebrides to Óláfr&#x27;s patronage.

Although the chronicle alleges that the union between Lauon and Óláfr was doomed for being within a prohibited degree of kinship, this is unlikely to have been the real reason for its dissolution. The impetus behind Reginald&#x27;s part in the whole affair was probably more political than religious. The chronicle certainly depicts Reginald and Óláfr as close by describing the former as the son of a sister of Óláfr, and by relating that Reginald warmly greeted him when he arrived on and orchestrated Óláfr&#x27;s annulment. There is also reason to suspect that, in the years immediately after the death of a previous Bishop of the Isles in 1217, during a period in which Reginald vied with Nicholas de Meaux for this vacant office, Óláfr actively backed the candidacy of Reginald whereas Rǫgnvaldr backed that of Nicholas.

==Conflict with Guðrøðr Dond==

If the chronicle is to be believed, Óláfr&#x27;s separation from Lauon enraged her sister—the wife of Rǫgnvaldr and mother of Guðrøðr Dond—who surreptitiously tricked Guðrøðr Dond into attacking Óláfr in 1223. Following what he thought were his father&#x27;s orders, Guðrøðr Dond gathered a force on Skye—where he was evidently based—and proceeded to , where he is reported to have laid waste to most of the island. Óláfr is said to have only narrowly escaped with a few men, and to have fled to the protection of his father-in-law on the mainland in Ross. Óláfr is stated to have been followed into exile by Páll Bálkason, a &quot;&quot; on Skye who refused to take up arms against him. At a later date, Óláfr and Páll are reported to have returned to Skye and defeated Guðrøðr Dond in battle.

The chronicle specifies that Guðrøðr Dond was overcome on &quot;a certain island called the isle of St Columba&quot;. This location may be identical to Skeabost Island in the mouth of the river Snizort (). Another possibility is that the isle in question is the now-landlocked island of Eilean Chaluim Chille in the Kilmuir district (). This island once sat in Loch Chaluim Chille before the loch was drained of water and turned into a meadow. There is archaeological evidence to suggest that a fortified site sat on another island in the loch, and that this islet was connected to the monastic island by a causeway. If correct, the fortification could account for Guðrøðr Dond&#x27;s presence near an ecclesiastical site. According to the chronicle, Óláfr&#x27;s forces consisted of five boats, and encircled the island after having launched from the opposite shore two from it. This distance, about , suggests that the island is more likely Eilean Chaluim Chille than Skeabost Island, as the former appears to have sat between and from the surrounding shores of Loch Chaluim Chille. In any case, following the clash, the chronicle reports that Guðrøðr Dond&#x27;s captured followers were put to death, and Guðrøðr Dond was blinded and castrated. It is possible that Óláfr was aided by Fearchar in the strike against Guðrøðr Dond. Certainly, the chronicle&#x27;s account seems to suggest that Óláfr accumulated his forces whilst sheltering in Ross. Although the chronicle maintains that Óláfr was unable to prevent this torture, and specifically identifies Páll as the instigator of the act, the Icelandic annals record that Óláfr was indeed responsible for his nephew&#x27;s plight, and make no mention of Páll.

The mutilation and killing of high-status kinsmen during power-struggles was not an unknown phenomenon in the peripheral-regions of the British Isles during the High Middle Ages. For instance, in only the century-and-a-half of its existence, at least nine members of the Crovan dynasty perished from mutilation or assassination. As such, there is reason to regard this vicious internecine violence as the Crovan dynasty&#x27;s greatest weakness. To contemporaries, the tortures of blinding and emasculation were a means of depriving power from a political opponent. Not only would the punishment deny a man the ability to sire descendants, it would divest him of personal power, limiting his ability to attract supporters, and further offset the threat of future vengeance. The maiming inflicted upon Guðrøðr Dond seems to exemplify Óláfr&#x27;s intent to wrest his perceived birthright from Rǫgnvaldr&#x27;s bloodline. It is unknown why Rǫgnvaldr did not similarly neutralise Óláfr when he had the chance years before, although it may have had something to do with the preservation of international relations. For example, it is possible that his act of showing leniency to Óláfr had garnered Scottish support against the threat of Norwegian overlordship. In any case, the neutralisation of Guðrøðr Dond appears to mark a turning point in the struggle between Óláfr and Rǫgnvaldr.

In September 1219, Rǫgnvaldr surrendered Mann to the papacy, swore to perform homage for the island, and promised to pay twelve marks sterling in perpetuity as tribute. This submission was recognised by Pope Honorius III in May 1223. The precise impetus behind Rǫgnvaldr&#x27;s submission is uncertain, although it may well have been related to the threat of ever-strengthening Norwegian kingship. Rǫgnvaldr&#x27;s papal submission may have also been linked to his feud with Óláfr. For example, in the last hours of his life, John, King of England appealed to Pope Innocent III to ensure the succession of his young son, the future Henry III, King of England. Although the chronology of dissension between Rǫgnvaldr and Óláfr is not entirely clear, the hostilities which entangled Rǫgnvaldr&#x27;s son broke out in the 1220s. Rǫgnvaldr, therefore, may have intended to secure, not only his own kingship, but also the future succession of his son.

The kin-strife endured by the Crovan dynasty largely took place on Skye and , islands that were clearly important within the kingdom. In fact, there is evidence to suggest that the kingdom&#x27;s northern territories were granted by reigning kings to heir-apparents or disaffected dynasts. For example, during the eleventh-century reign of the dynasty&#x27;s founder, Guðrøðr Crovan, the northern portion of the realm may have been governed by Guðrøðr Crovan&#x27;s succeeding son, Lǫgmaðr. The fact that Rǫgnvaldr was residing in the Hebrides when his father died in 1187 may indicate that, despite the chronicle&#x27;s claims to the contrary, Rǫgnvaldr was indeed the rightful heir to the kingship. Furthermore, since Guðrøðr Dond is recorded on Skye, the possibility exists that he resided there as his father&#x27;s heir-apparent. Rǫgnvaldr&#x27;s grant of to Óláfr may, therefore, indicate that Óláfr was at least temporarily regarded as Rǫgnvaldr&#x27;s rightful successor. On the other hand, it is also possible that Rǫgnvaldr&#x27;s grant was given in the context of appeasing a disgruntled dynast passed over for the kingship. In any event, it is apparent that such territorial fragmentation would have severely weakened the realm.

==Opposition from Alan fitz Roland==

In 1224, the year following the defeat of Rǫgnvaldr&#x27;s son, the chronicle reveals that Óláfr took hostages from the leading men of the Hebridean portion of the realm, and with a fleet of thirty-two ships, landed on Mann at Ronaldsway, where he confronted Rǫgnvaldr directly. It was then agreed that the kingdom would be split between the two: with Rǫgnvaldr keeping Mann itself along with the title of king, and Óláfr retaining a share in the Hebrides. With Óláfr&#x27;s rise at Rǫgnvaldr expense, the latter turned to Alan, one of Scotland&#x27;s most powerful magnates. Alan and Rǫgnvaldr were certainly closely connected. Both were great-grandsons of Fergus, Lord of Galloway; both had received Ulster lands from the English at about the same time; and it is possible that connections between the Isles and Galloway had led to Rǫgnvaldr&#x27;s involvement with the Scottish Crown in Caithness in about 1200.

In a letter from Alan to Henry, dated the year of the partitioning between the half-brothers, Alan mentioned that he was preoccupied with his army and fleet, travelling from island to island. This statement could well evince the beginning of joint military operations, conducted by Alan and Rǫgnvaldr against Óláfr, assigned by the chronicle to the following year. According to the latter source, however, the campaigning came to nought because the Manx were unwilling to battle against Óláfr and the Hebrideans. This record appears to show that Alan portrayed his actions in the Isles as related to his conflict with the Lacys in Ireland. As such, the correspondence could be evidence that the Ulster ambitions of Hugh de Lacy were aligned with Óláfr in the Isles. Not only did Óláfr clash with Rǫgnvaldr&#x27;s son in 1223, but Hugh launched a bid to recover his forfeited Earldom of Ulster in the same year, a reclamation that seriously threatened recent Gallovidian expansion in Ireland. Whilst Rǫgnvaldr clearly had the support of Alan and his family, there is reason to suspect that Óláfr was allied to Hugh. In the correspondence between Alan and Henry, Alan stated that he had been on the verge of launching an invasion of Ireland when he learned of an agreement reached between Hugh and the Justiciar of Ireland, and therefore sought the king&#x27;s confirmation of his family&#x27;s lands in Ulster. Alan&#x27;s letter appears to show that his campaigning in the Isles was understood to have been a detriment to Hugh in Ireland. As such, Hugh seems to have been expected to make use of military assistance from Isles in his restoration attempt. Óláfr&#x27;s move against Rǫgnvaldr in 1223 and 1224—the very time the Lacys campaigned against Gallovidian interests in Ireland—is unlikely to have been a coincidence. It may have been the window of opportunity that Óláfr seized upon. Alternately, it may have been Hugh himself who capitalised upon the Gallovidian&#x27;s campaigning against Óláfr.

Other correspondence, possibly dating to about 1224, between Henry and his sister, Joan, Queen of Scotland, reveals that Hákon Hákonarson, King of Norway was rumoured to have been planning a naval expedition west-over-sea. Although Joan&#x27;s letter to Henry places this campaign in the context of Hugh&#x27;s threat to English-aligned interests in Ireland, it may be that Hákon&#x27;s attention was focused upon the escalating situation in the Isles. One possibility is that Joan&#x27;s letter is evidence that Óláfr was thought to have appealed to Hákon for support against Rǫgnvaldr.

Also in 1224, the thirteenth-century &quot;Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar&quot; reports that a certain Gillikristr, Óttar Snækollsson, and many Islesmen, travelled to Norway and presented Hákon with letters pertaining to the needs of their lands. One possibility is that these so-called needs refer to the violent kin-strife and recent treaty between the half-brothers. The saga may therefore reveal that the Norwegian Crown was approached by either representatives of either side of the inter-dynastic conflict, or perhaps by neutral chieftains caught in the middle. Further attempts to quell the infighting by way of the Norwegian Crown may have been undertaken in 1226, when it is remarked by the same source that Simon, Bishop of the Isles met with Hákon.

A short time later, perhaps in about 1225 or 1226, the chronicle reveals that Rǫgnvaldr oversaw the marriage of a daughter of his to Alan&#x27;s young illegitimate son, Thomas. Unfortunately for Rǫgnvaldr, this marital alliance appears to have cost him the kingship, since the chronicle records that the Manxmen had him removed from power and replaced with Óláfr. The recorded resentment of the union could indicate that Alan&#x27;s son was intended to eventually succeed Rǫgnvaldr, who was perhaps about sixty years-old at the time, and whose grandchildren were presumably still very young. In fact it is possible that, in light of Rǫgnvaldr&#x27;s advanced age and his son&#x27;s mutilation, a significant number of the Islesmen regarded Óláfr as the rightful heir. Such a view could well account for the lack of enthusiasm that the Manxmen had for Alan and Rǫgnvaldr&#x27;s campaign in the Hebrides. Since Thomas was likely little more than a teenager at the time, it may well have been obvious to contemporary observers that Alan was the one who would hold the real power in the kingdom.

The fact that Rǫgnvaldr agreed to the marriage could indicate that a stake in the kingship was the price of Alan&#x27;s assistance against Óláfr. From the perspective of the Scottish Crown, it is conceivable that Alan&#x27;s ambitions in the Isles were encouraged by the prospect of Alan&#x27;s son becoming a dependable client-king on Mann, and the potential to further extend and strengthen Scottish royal authority along the western seaboard, bringing stability to the war-torn region. Alexander probably also encouraged Fearchar&#x27;s alliance with Óláfr. As such, the Scottish Crown appears to have escalated the discord in the Isles by playing off both sides in the fraternal struggle. Whilst Alan&#x27;s interest apparently consisted of Mann and the southern Hebrides, territories that would have complemented his lordships within the North Channel-Firth of Clyde region, Fearchar&#x27;s own interest may have centred around Skye and Lewis, where his descendants gained dominance later in the thirteenth century.

At this low point of his career, the deposed Rǫgnvaldr appears to have gone into exile at Alan&#x27;s court in Galloway. In 1228, whilst Óláfr and his chieftains were absent in Hebrides, the chronicle records of an invasion of Mann by Rǫgnvaldr, Alan, and Alan&#x27;s brother, Thomas. The attack appears to have resulted in the complete devastation of the southern half of the island, since the chronicle declares that it was almost reduced to a desert. Suffering serious setbacks at the hands of his enemies, in what appears to be the nadir of his career, Óláfr reached out for English assistance against his half-brother, as evidenced by fragments of correspondence between Henry and Óláfr in which the latter alluded to aggression dealt from Alan. This appeal for English assistance requests that Henry intervene with Alexander, and appears to show that Óláfr believed that Alexander was actively encouraging Alan&#x27;s aggression. The participation of the Earl of Atholl in the 1228 attack could indicate that Alexander was aware of the operation. One possibility is that, instead of an attempt to conquer the island, this Scottish-led operation was an attempt to pressure Óláfr into coming to terms without involving the English. In any case, after Alan vacated Mann, Óláfr and his forces reappeared on the island, and routed the remaining Gallovidians. Thus, the chronicle declares, peace was restored to the island.

Despite the warring against Óláfr, the English administration was certainly dealing with him as king by 1228. That year English records reveal that Henry attempted to broker a peace between the half-brothers, and gave Óláfr safe passage to England. This intervention may have led to Óláfr&#x27;s temporary absence from Mann that year. It could also roughly mark the point when Rǫgnvaldr finally lost English support. Although the English Crown technically recognised Óláfr&#x27;s kingship in correspondence sent to him the year before, the aggressive tone directed at him suggests that the preferred dynast may well have been Rǫgnvaldr at that point in time.

==Rǫgnvaldr&#x27;s final fall==

In what was likely early January 1229, the chronicle records that Rǫgnvaldr caught the forces of Óláfr unaware, as Rǫgnvaldr sailed from Galloway with five ships, and launched a nocturnal raid upon the harbour at St Patrick&#x27;s Isle, near what is today the town of Peel. During this assault, the chronicle records that Rǫgnvaldr had all of the ships of Óláfr and his chieftains destroyed. Although the chronicle&#x27;s description of the attack alludes to Gallovidian involvement, as it states that the expedition originated from Galloway, the fact that Rǫgnvaldr commanded only five ships suggests that this support may have been waning.

Rǫgnvaldr followed up on his assault by establishing himself in the southern part of Mann, as the chronicle records that he won over the support of the southerners. Meanwhile, Óláfr is stated to have assembled his forces in the north of Mann, indicating that the island was divided between the two men for much of January and February, before what would be their final confrontation. According to the chronicle, Rǫgnvaldr and Óláfr led their armies to Tynwald. The derivation of this place name—from the Old Norse elements &#x27; (&quot;assembly&quot;) and &#x27; (&quot;field&quot;, &quot;meadow&quot;)—reveals that it was an assembly site, which in turn suggests that negotiations may have been intended.

On 14 February, the festival of St Valentine, the chronicle records that Óláfr&#x27;s forces launched an attack upon Rǫgnvaldr at Tynwald, where Rǫgnvaldr&#x27;s troops were routed and he himself was slain. Tynwald may well have been the place where the Islesmen publicly inaugurated their kings, proclaimed new laws, and resolved disputes. As such, Óláfr&#x27;s victory over Rǫgnvaldr at this site could have enhanced his royal status. Whilst Rǫgnvaldr&#x27;s fall is laconically corroborated by the Icelandic annals, other sources appear to suggest that his death was due to treachery. The fourteenth-century &quot;Chronicle of Lanercost&quot;, for example, states that Rǫgnvaldr &quot;fell a victim to the arms of the wicked&quot;; whilst the &quot;Chronicle of Mann&quot; states that, although Óláfr grieved at his half-brother&#x27;s death, he never exacted vengeance upon his killers. Although the latter&#x27;s account of Guðrøðr Dond&#x27;s maiming and Rǫgnvaldr&#x27;s death could be evidence that Óláfr was unable to control his supporters during these historical episodes, it is also possible that the compilers of this source sought to disassociate Óláfr from these acts of violence against his kin.

==Norwegian intervention==
===Óspakr&#x27;s appointed kingship===

The death of Alan&#x27;s ally did not deter Gallovidian interests in the Isles. In fact, it is apparent that Alan and members of the Clann Dubhghaill branch of Clann Somhairle upheld pressure upon Óláfr. Reports of open warfare in the Isles reached Hákon&#x27;s royal court in the summer of 1229. The thirteenth-century &quot;Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar&quot; specifically singles out Alan as one of the principal perpetrators of unrest, describing him as &quot;the greatest warrior&quot;, possessing a large force of men and ships with which he plundered throughout the Hebrides. Several members of Clann Somhairle are also associated with this unrest: Dubhghall mac Dubhghaill, Donnchadh mac Dubhghaill, and a certain Somhairle. Whilst these members of Clann Somhairle are depicted as being disloyal to Hákon, the saga contrasts them with Óláfr, who is said to have been a steadfast supporter of Hákon, and to have manfully held his kingdom against Alan.

Although Óláfr arrived at the Norwegian court early in 1230, having been forced from the Isles by Alan and his allies, it is evident that Hákon had already decided upon a course of action. Upon his arrival, the saga relates that Óláfr gave a report of Alan&#x27;s actions in the Isles. According to the &quot;Flateyjarbók&quot; and &quot;Skálholtsbók&quot; versions of the saga, Óláfr repeated a boast of Alan, suggesting that Alan thought himself capable of even invading Norway. Rather than being an accurate reflection of Alan&#x27;s intentions, however, there is reason to suspect that Óláfr&#x27;s recounted bluster was instead an invention designed to direct further Norwegian animosity at Alan.

In any case, the Icelandic annals, saga, &quot;Chronicle of Mann&quot;, and &quot;Chronicle of Lanercost&quot; all reveal that Hákon handed over the kingship of the Isles to Óspakr, an apparent member of Clann Dubhghaill who had long served outside the Isles in Norway. Other Islesmen in Norway before Óláfr&#x27;s arrival were Páll and Guðrøðr Dond, the latter who seems to have been one of Óspakr&#x27;s principal supporters. According to saga, Hákon not only granted Óspakr the kingship, but also gave him command of the Norwegian fleet tasked with restoring peace in the Isles.

Within days of Óláfr&#x27;s arrival in Norway, the saga reveals that Óspakr&#x27;s fleet set sail for the Isles, and swelled in number after reaching Orkney. Whilst the &quot;Eirspennill&quot; version of the saga numbers the fleet in Norway at twelve ships, the &quot;Flateyjarbók&quot;, &quot;Frísbók&quot;, and &quot;Skálholtsbók&quot; versions give the number eleven; and whilst the former version relates that the fleet gained twenty ships from Orkney, the latter three versions state that the fleet numbered twenty when it left Orkney. The saga recounts that Óláfr and Páll journeyed on the same ship, and states that, after they reached Orkney, Jón Haraldsson, Earl of Orkney gave Óláfr a ship called the &quot;Ox&quot;. Once in the Isles, the fleet linked up with three leading members of Clann Somhairle on Islay.

News of the gathering Norwegian fleet soon reached Alexander II, who appears to have made straight for the western coast, diverting his attention to the now rapidly developing crisis. On 28 May, Alan is recorded in Alexander II&#x27;s presence at Ayr, where the Scottish royal forces appear to have assembled. It was probably May or June when Óspakr&#x27;s fleet rounded the Mull of Kintyre, entered the Firth of Clyde, and made landfall on Bute, where his forces successfully stormed and captured a fortress that is almost certainly identical to Rothesay Castle. The &quot;Flateyjarbók&quot;, &quot;Frísbók&quot;, and &quot;Skálholtsbók&quot; versions of the saga specify that the castle fell after three days of battle, and that three hundred Norwegians and Islesmen fell in the assault. By this stage in the campaign, the fleet is stated to have reached a size of eighty ships, a tally which may indicate that Óspakr&#x27;s fighting-force numbered over three thousand men. Reports that Alan was in the vicinity, at the command of a massive fleet, are stated to have forced the Norwegians to withdraw to Kintyre. Whilst the &quot;Eirspennill&quot; version of the saga numbers Alan&#x27;s fleet at almost two hundred ships, the &quot;Flateyjarbók&quot;, &quot;Frísbók&quot;, and &quot;Skálholtsbók&quot; versions give a tally of one hundred and fifty. These totals suggest that Alan commanded a force of two thousand or three thousand men. Having withdrawn his fleet to Kintyre, Óspakr took ill and died, presumably succumbing to injuries sustained from the assault on Bute. According to the saga, the king&#x27;s death was bitterly lamented amongst his followers.

===Óláfr and Guðrøðr Dond&#x27;s shared kingship===

In consequence of Óspakr&#x27;s fall, the saga reveals that command of the fleet was assumed by Óláfr, who successfully eluded Alan&#x27;s forces by leading the force to the (&quot;Merchant Islands&quot;), a group of islands which appear to refer to the Copeland Islands. There is reason to suspect that this destination, just off the Ards Peninsula, was chosen in an effort to acquire both protection and provisioning. Specifically, the islands may have provided the fleet with the ability to prevent Alan—who was married to a daughter of Hugh—from drawing assistance from Ireland. It is also conceivable that the fleet procured logistical support from nearby Grey Abbey, a monastery founded by Óláfr&#x27;s sister, Affrica. Another nearby religious house, Inch Abbey, founded by Affrica&#x27;s husband, (Hugh&#x27;s predecessor in Ulster) John de Courcy, could have also provided the fleet with provisions. After the fleet&#x27;s stay at the , the saga relates that it set sail for Mann, where a force of Manxmen led by a certain Þórkell Njálsson—an apparent Islesman who may have been allied to the Gallovidians—briefly resisted the incomers before being dispersed. According to the &quot;Chronicle of Lanercost&quot; and &quot;Chronicle of Mann&quot;, after having reached Mann, Óláfr and Guðrøðr Dond divided the kingdom between themselves, with Óláfr controlling Mann and Guðrøðr Dond the islands.

Despite Óspakr&#x27;s elevation as king, it is uncertain how Hákon envisioned the governance of the Kingdom of the Isles. On one hand, it is possible that Hákon intended for Óspakr and Guðrøðr Dond to divide the kingdom at Óláfr&#x27;s expense. On the other hand, the fact that Óláfr&#x27;s struggle against Alan and Clann Somhairle is acclaimed by the saga could be evidence that Hákon did not intend to replace Óláfr with Óspakr. Instead, Hákon may have planned for Óspakr to reign over the sprawling domain of Clann Somhairle as a way to ensure the kindred&#x27;s obedience. Óspakr&#x27;s prospective realm, therefore, seems to have comprised Argyll, Kintyre, and the Inner Hebrides. If correct, the fleet&#x27;s primary design would appear to have been the procurement of Óspakr&#x27;s domain, whilst a secondary objective—adopted very late in the campaign—seems to have been the restoration of Óláfr on Mann.

It is also possible that Hákon originally ordered a division of power between Óláfr and Guðrøðr Dond, and that Hákon originally promised to lend support to Óláfr&#x27;s cause on the condition of a concession of authority to Guðrøðr Dond, who—like Óspakr—could have been recognised as king by the Norwegian Crown. An accommodation between Óláfr and Guðrøðr Dond could well have benefited both men, as it would have safeguarded their kindred against the dynastic ambitions of Alan, offsetting the royal marriage between this man&#x27;s son and Guðrøðr Dond&#x27;s sister. There is certainly no further record of Alan pursuing military actions against Óláfr, which could be evidence that Alan came to terms with an arrangement between the two competing branches of the Crovan dynasty.

The pact between Óláfr and Guðrøðr Dond turned out to be short-lived. According to the saga, when the fleet left for Norway in the Spring, it clashed with the Kintyremen before sailing northward to , where it ousted a certain Þórmóðr Þórkelsson from the island. A few weeks after the fleet left the region for Orkney, the saga reports that Páll was slain in the by Guðrøðr Dond. According to the &quot;Chronicle of Mann&quot; and the &quot;Chronicle of Lanercost&quot;, Guðrøðr Dond established himself in the Hebrides but was later killed, with the former account locating his death on . In any event, it is apparent that it was only after Guðrøðr Dond&#x27;s demise that Óláfr was able to secure the full tenure of kingship. Óláfr went on to rule the realm until his death.

Upon the homeward return of the Norwegians, the saga declares that Hákon&#x27;s &quot;honours had been won&quot; as a result of the expedition, and states that Hákon himself heartily thanked the men for their service overseas. The operation seems to mark a turning point in the history of the Kingdom of the Isles. Although the kings that ruled the realm before Rǫgnvaldr could afford to ignore Norwegian royal authority, it is apparent that those who ruled after him required a closer relationship with the Norwegian Crown. Even though the Norwegians acclaimed the conclusion of the campaign, its only lasting achievement was Óláfr&#x27;s restoration. The Scots too may have welcomed this outcome, considering the consolidation of the Crovan dynasty after years of chaos, and Óláfr&#x27;s familial relationship with Fearchar, Alexander&#x27;s principal northern protégé. Nevertheless, the campaign itself may have been the gravest crisis faced by the Scots since the English invasion of Scotland in 1216. Although Scottish sources fail to note the campaign of 1230, its magnitude is revealed by English sources such as the &quot;Chronicle of Lanercost&quot;, and the thirteenth-century &quot;Annales de Dunstaplia&quot;, with the latter reporting that the campaigning Norwegians and Islesmen were only overcome with much labour after they had invaded Scotland and Mann and inflicted considerable casualties.

The context of Guðrøðr Dond&#x27;s final fall suggests that, despite his injuries and impairment, he was able to swiftly assert his authority and eliminate Páll. Although the Norwegians&#x27; presence may have temporarily constrained the implacable animosities of the Islesmen, the fleet&#x27;s departure appears to have been the catalyst of renewed conflict. Evidently still an adherent of Óláfr—certainly, the two are reported to have sailed on the same ship on the outset of Óspakr&#x27;s campaign—Páll&#x27;s annihilation suggests that Guðrøðr Dond avenged his father&#x27;s destruction and his own mutilation. The fact that Óláfr was able to regain and retain control of the realm after Guðrøðr Dond&#x27;s demise suggests that Óláfr may have moved against him once the Norwegians left the region.

==Later reign==

After the campaign of 1230/1231, Alan ceased his policy of aggression against Óláfr, probably on account of Alexander, who afterwards pursued a more measured strategy dealing with the Norse-Gaelic magnates on the northwestern periphery of his realm. There is no evidence that Óláfr ever threatened the Scots after finally regaining authority. It is possible that he actually owed his release in about 1214 to Alexander himself. It may have been that, after his resumption of power in 1230/1231, the Scots failed to disturb him and he did not disturb them. In the context of the campaign of 1230/1231, the Norwegians appear to have regarded Alan as their main opponent, not Alexander. It is possible that the latter regarded Alan&#x27;s ambitions in the Isles, and his warring against Óláfr, as a root cause of the crisis faced by the Scots that year. In any case, Alexander afterwards appears to have relied upon Walter fitz Alan II, Steward of Scotland, and the latter&#x27;s kin, to extend Scottish royal authority into Argyll and the Isles. It was not until the 1240s that the Scots resumed aggressive actions in the west.

At some point during his reign, he is known to have granted certain commercial rights and protections to the monks of Holm Cultram Abbey. At one point he granted rights to the priory of Whithorn concerning two churches on Mann (St Ninian at Ballacgniba and St Ronan), and at another point granted the priory of St Bees sixty head of cattle or the equivalent value in sheep or swine. Óláfr&#x27;s 1228 letter to Henry reveals that Óláfr involved himself with mercantile activity.

In 1235, Óláfr journeyed to the court of Henry, as evidenced by an English letter of safe passage issued in April 1235. That July, Óláfr is recorded to have rendered homage to Henry, and to have received payment for his services in safeguarding the English and Irish coasts for the English Crown. As a result, Óláfr pledged to secure the English and Irish coasts faithfully, and to supply the English with fifty galleys when needed: all for the annual allowance of forty marks, one hundred crannocks of wheat, and five hogsheads of wine.

Near the end of his reign, Óláfr appears to have commenced another visit to Norway, as evidenced by directives of Henry instructing his subjects to protect Óláfr and his kingdom during his absence (issued in May 1236, and April 1237).

Óláfr may have been a patron of St German&#x27;s Cathedral on St Patrick&#x27;s Isle, as the chronicle reports that this religious house was constructed by Simon, Bishop of the Isles. The site itself appears to have been established in the twelfth- or thirteenth century. Early diocesan bishops, during the eleventh and twelfth centuries, may well have circulated from region to region in the Isles, and it is possible that the cathedral&#x27;s foundation represents the final settling of the diocesan see. The site has undergone several phases of construction over the centuries, and it is uncertain what part can be credited to Simon. Óláfr&#x27;s actions in the northern Hebrides could indicate that he was also a patron of the Snizort Cathedral on Skeabost Island, a religious house that first appears on record in the fourteenth century.

Although Óláfr—like his father and grandfather—styled himself in Latin , his sons Haraldr and Magnús used the form . The latter style is nevertheless accorded to Óláfr by the chronicle in the record of his death. It was also accorded to members of the family by the English chancellery in thirteenth century, seemingly before its adoption by the Islesmen themselves. The title is the equivalent of the Gaelic (&quot;king of the islands of the foreigners&quot;) first recorded in 989, a style almost certainly referring to Mann and the Hebrides.

==Death==

Óláfr&#x27;s reign spanned from 1226 to 1237. Although a significant portion of the &quot;Chronicle of Mann&quot; is devoted to the strife between him and Rǫgnvaldr, the span of Óláfr&#x27;s reign is covered in only a few lines. According to this source Óláfr died on 21 May 1237, on St Patrick&#x27;s Isle, and was buried at Rushen Abbey. This monastic house, the foremost ecclesiastical site on Mann, had originally been founded by his paternal grandfather in 1134. By the thirteenth century, it served as a royal mausoleum of the Crovan dynasty, being the burial place of three of the family&#x27;s four kings that ruled between 1226 and 1265. Óláfr was the first royal to be laid to rest at Rushen. The others were his sons Rǫgnvaldr, and Magnús. There is a possibility that a thirteenth-century stone coffin-lid or grave-slab found at Rushen may be associated with one of the three kings buried there. The fact that Óláfr and his father died on St Patrick&#x27;s Isle suggests that it was a royal residence. It is possible that the seat of Manx royal power was located at Peel Castle, on St Patrick&#x27;s Isle, before the seat moved to Castle Rushen in the thirteenth century.

==Descendants==

Óláfr was survived by three children: Haraldr, Rǫgnvaldr, and Magnús—all of whom eventually ruled as kings. Óláfr was succeeded by his son, Haraldr, who was in turn succeeded by Óláfr&#x27;s son, Rǫgnvaldr. This monarch was slain in 1249, seemingly by an associate of Guðrøðr Dond&#x27;s son, Haraldr, whereupon the latter assumed the kingship. This abrupt seizure of royal power by Guðrøðr Dond&#x27;s son—almost twenty years after Guðrøðr Dond&#x27;s death—exposes the fact that the inter-dynastic strife between lines of (Guðrøðr Dond&#x27;s father) Rǫgnvaldr and Óláfr carried on for yet another generation. The infighting only came to an end in the reign of the dynasty&#x27;s final monarch, Óláfr&#x27;s son, Magnús.

The mother of Óláfr&#x27;s children is uncertain. Although no source names the mother of his son, Haraldr, the chronicle asserts that the latter was only fourteen years old at the time of Óláfr&#x27;s death. This would place Haraldr&#x27;s birth in 1222 or 1223, at about the time that Óláfr married Cairistíona, which indicates that either Cairistíona or Lauon could have been Haraldr&#x27;s mother. As for Haraldr&#x27;s two succeeding brothers, it is conceivable that Cairistíona was their mother. If Lauon was indeed the mother of Haraldr and a descendant of Raghnall, this relationship could explain why Ruaidhrí and Domhnall—apparently close adherents of Óláfr&#x27;s half-brother, Rǫgnvaldr—are not recorded to have opposed Óláfr after Rǫgnvaldr&#x27;s death. Certainly, the recorded history of the Isles between the 1230s and 1240s is remarkably peaceful in comparison to other eras.

There is evidence to suggest that Óláfr had a fourth son, Guðrøðr. For example, the chronicle relates that, not long after Haraldr&#x27;s succession, Haraldr visited the Hebrides and left control of Mann to Lochlann, his kinsman who governed the island in his place. In the following autumn, Lochlann and his supporters are said to have come into conflict with Hebridean supporters of Haraldr, and when the latter returned to Mann in the spring, the chronicle reports that Lochlann fled to Wales with all his men and his foster son, a youth identified as Guðrøðr, the son of a man named Óláfr. The ship they were travelling on is stated to have been wrecked upon the Welsh coast, and although Lochlann was able to make it ashore safely, he returned to the scene in an attempt to save Guðrøðr. According to the chronicle, Lochlann, Guðrøðr, and about forty others lost their lives in the shipwreck.

It is possible that Lochlann&#x27;s foster son is identical to a similarly named individual, a certain &quot;&quot;, who attested a quitclaim between Llywelyn ap Gruffudd and Ralph de Mortimer, in about 1241. It is uncertain what compelled Lochlann to flee his sovereign, and it is uncertain why he chose Wales as his destination. The Crovan dynasty certainly had diplomatic and familial connections with the Welsh. One possibility is that the account of Lochlann&#x27;s flight reveals that he attempted to replace Óláfr&#x27;s son, Haraldr, with another son. If the chronicle is incorrect in its account of the foster-son&#x27;s maritime demise, and he is indeed identical to the like-named Manx prince attested in Wales, this individual&#x27;s activities outside the realm of his ancestors may have been a consequence of strife following Óláfr&#x27;s death and Haraldr&#x27;s accession. Haraldr&#x27;s young age at the time, and the fact that he had a potential rival in the person of his like-named cousin, Haraldr Guðrøðarson, could indicate that Haraldr had been designated as successor during his father&#x27;s lifetime.

<text>High-speed steel (HSS or HS) is a subset of tool steels, commonly used as cutting tool material.

It is superior to high-carbon steel tools in that it can withstand higher temperatures without losing its temper (hardness). This property allows HSS to cut faster than high carbon steel, hence the name &quot;high-speed steel&quot;. At room temperature, in their generally recommended heat treatment, HSS grades generally display high hardness (above 60 Rockwell C) and abrasion resistance compared with common carbon and tool steels. There are several different types of high speed steel, such as M42 and M2.

== History ==

In 1868, English metallurgist Robert Forester Mushet developed Mushet steel, considered the forerunner of modern high-speed steels. It consisted of 2% carbon, 2.5% manganese, and 7% tungsten. The major advantage of this steel was that it hardened when air cooled from a temperature at which most steels had to be quenched for hardening. Over the next 30 years, the most significant change was the replacement of manganese with chromium.

In 1899 and 1900, Frederick Winslow Taylor and Maunsel White (&quot;A.K.A&quot; Maunsel White III; 1856–1912; grandson of Maunsel White; 1783–1863), working with a team of assistants at the Bethlehem Steel Company at Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, US, performed a series of experiments with heat treating existing high-quality tool steels, such as Mushet steel, heating them to much higher temperatures than were typically considered desirable in the industry. Their experiments were characterised by a scientific empiricism in that many different combinations were made and tested, with no regard for conventional wisdom, and detailed records kept of each batch. The result was a heat treatment process that transformed existing alloys into a new kind of steel that could retain its hardness at higher temperatures, allowing cutting speed to be tripled from 30 surface feet per minute to 90. A demonstration of cutting tools made from the new steel caused a sensation at the 1900 Paris Exhibition.

The Taylor-White process was patented and created a revolution in machining industries. Heavier machine tools with higher rigidity were needed to use the new steel to its full advantage, prompting redesigns and replacement of installed plant machinery. The patent was contested and eventually nullified.

The first alloy that was formally classified as high-speed steel is known by the AISI designation T1, which was introduced in 1910. It was patented by Crucible Steel Co. at the beginning of the 20th century.

Although molybdenum-rich high-speed steels such as AISI M1 had seen some use since the 1930s, it was the material shortages and high costs caused by WWII that spurred development of less expensive alloys substituting molybdenum for tungsten. The advances in molybdenum-based high speed steel during this period put them on par with, and in certain cases better, than tungsten-based high speed steels. This started with the use of M2 steel instead of T1 steel.

== Types ==
High speed steels are alloys that gain their properties from a variety of alloying metals added to carbon steel, typically including tungsten and molybdenum, or a combination of the two, often with other alloys as well. They belong to the Fe–C–X multi-component alloy system where X represents chromium, tungsten, molybdenum, vanadium, or cobalt. Generally, the X component is present in excess of 7%, along with more than 0.60% carbon.

In the unified numbering system (UNS), tungsten-type grades (e.g. T1, T15) are assigned numbers in the T120xx series, while molybdenum (e.g. M2, M48) and intermediate types are T113xx. ASTM standards recognize 7 tungsten types and 17 molybdenum types.

The addition of about 10% of tungsten and molybdenum in total maximises efficiently the hardness and toughness of high speed steels and maintains those properties at the high temperatures generated when cutting metals.


=== Molybdenum High Speed Steels (HSS) ===

Combining molybdenum, tungsten and chromium steel creates several alloys commonly called &quot;HSS&quot;, with a hardness of 63 to 65 Rockwell C.

; M1: M1 lacks some of the red-hardness properties of M2, but is less susceptible to shock and will flex more. 
; M2: M2 is the most widely used industrial HSS. It has small and evenly distributed carbides giving high wear resistance, though its decarburization sensitivity is a little bit high. After heat treatment, its hardness is the same as T1, but its bending strength can reach , and its toughness and thermo-plasticity are higher than T1 by 50%. It is usually used to manufacture a variety of tools, such as drill bits, taps and reamers. 1.3343 is the equivalent numeric designation for M2 material identified in ISO 4957.
; M7: M7 is used for making heavier construction drills where flexibility and extended drill life are equally important.
; M50: M50 does not have the red-hardness of other grades of tungsten HSS, but is very good for drills where breakage is a problem due to flexing the drill. Generally favored for hardware stores and contractor use. It is also used in high-temperature ball bearings.

=== Cobalt High Speed Steels ===

The addition of cobalt increases heat resistance, and can give a hardness up to 70 Rockwell C.

; M35: M35 is similar to M2, but with 5% cobalt added. M35 is also known as Cobalt Steel, HSSE or HSS-E. It will cut faster and last longer than M2.
; M42: M42 is a molybdenum-series high-speed steel alloy with an additional 8% cobalt. It is widely used in metal manufacturing industries because of its superior red-hardness as compared to more conventional high-speed steels, allowing for shorter cycle times in production environments due to higher cutting speeds or from the increase in time between tool changes.

==Forming==
HSS drill bits formed by rolling are denoted HSS-R. Grinding is used to create HSS-G, cobalt and carbide drill bits.

== Applications ==

The main use of high-speed steels continues to be in the manufacture of various cutting tools: drills, taps, milling cutters, tool bits, hobbing (gear) cutters, saw blades, planer and jointer blades, router bits, etc., although usage for punches and dies is increasing.

High speed steels also found a market in fine hand tools where their relatively good toughness at high hardness, coupled with high abrasion resistance, made them suitable for low speed applications requiring a durable keen (sharp) edge, such as files, chisels, hand plane blades, and damascus kitchen knives and pocket knives.

High speed steel tools are the most popular for use in woodturning, as the speed of movement of the work past the edge is relatively high for handheld tools, and HSS holds its edge far longer than high carbon steel tools can.

<doc id="685789" wikidata="Q2095894" url="?curid=685789" title="Techne">
<text>In Ancient Greek philosophy, techne (; , ) is a philosophical concept that refers to making or doing. Today, while the Ancient Greek definition of techne is similar to the modern definition and use of &quot;practical knowledge&quot;, techne can include various fields such as mathematics, geometry, medicine, shoemaking, rhetoric, philosophy, music, and astronomy.

One of the definitions of techne led by Aristotle, for example, is &quot;a state involving true reason concerned with production&quot;.

== History of the term ==
Many Ancient Greek philosophers, such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, had difficulty coming up with a single definition for techne and there is differentiation between the ways that these philosophers used the term. 

The word techne comes from the Greek word for art, skill, craft, and technique. The modern-day English word technology comes from the prefix techne and the suffix ology; both words are of Greek origin combined to mean &quot;the practical application of knowledge&quot;. Techne in Ancient Greece was thought of as dangerous in its virtues by many philosophers, including Plato. Arts such as paintings and sculptures were particularly thought to be unvirtuous because of their &quot;third-hand [representation] of &quot;true&quot; reality and absolute beauty&quot;. Other philosophers, such as Aristotle, believed that techne was virtuous because it uses natural materials &quot;to create objects unknown in nature&quot; and therefore it &quot;completes nature&quot;.
== Ancient Greek Philosophers ==

=== Socrates ===
The Ancient Greek philosopher Xenophon wrote down conversations he had with Socrates in the Socratic works Memorabilia and Oeconomicus. In both of these works, Socrates uses episteme and techne interchangeably. Crafts that Socrates classifies as techne include harp playing, flute playing, dancing, wrestling, medicine, carpentry, ruling, generalship, housebuilding, running a household, farming, and mathematics.

=== Plato ===

The Ancient Greek Philosopher Plato often used episteme and techne interchangeably, much like Socrates. This is because Plato was a student of Socrates and also wrote Socratic works. Plato&#x27;s works define techne as activities such as medicine, geometry, politics, music, shipbuilding, carpentry, and generalship. Plato&#x27;s dialogues introduce the idea of a practitioner connected to a craft, such as a physician with medicine. Plato introduced the idea of techne as a way to explain aspects of life such as virtue. This increased the complexity of the definition of techne, adding that crafts are separated by what the end product will be or what the activity accomplishes. Plato&#x27;s writings also reveal that he believed the most important job of the practitioner was to be able to explain what they were doing and why they were doing it.

=== Aristotle ===

Aristotle does not use techne and episteme interchangeably as Socrates and Plato did before him. He distinguishes clearly between the two terms. Aristotle includes techne and episteme in his five virtues of intellect: episteme, techne, phronesis, sophia, and nous. In Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle wrote that techne not only meant craft but also production (for example: the production of a ship). Richard Parry wrote that Aristotle believed techne aims for good and forms an end, which could be the activity itself or a product formed from the activity. Aristotle used health as an example of an end that is produced by the techne of medicine. Like Plato&#x27;s beliefs about the importance of a practitioner being able to explain their craft, Aristotle believed that the practitioner with the knowledge of techne could teach their skill because they not only had the wisdom of the craft but also understood the outcome.

<text>Anita Lizana de Ellis (19 November 1915 – 21 August 1994) was a world No. 1 tennis player from Chile. She was the first Latin American, and first Hispanic person, to be ranked World Number 1 tennis player. Also, Lizana was the first Latin American to win a Grand Slam singles championship. She won the U.S. Championships singles title in 1937, defeating Jadwiga Jędrzejowska in the final in straight sets.

==Career==
In the singles event of the 1937 U.S. Championships Lizana defeated three seeded players without losing a set to reach the final where she beat Jadwiga Jędrzejowska, also in straight sets. At the Wimbledon Championships she reached the singles quarterfinals in 1936 and 1937. In 1936 she lost to second-seeded and eventual champion Helen Jacobs while in 1937 sixth-seeded Simonne Mathieu proved too strong.

She won the Scottish Championships four times (1935–37, 46).

In 1936 Lizana won the singles titles at the British Covered Court Championships, played on wood courts at the Queen&#x27;s Club in London, and the South of England Championships in Eastbourne where she defeated Dorothy Round in the final in straight sets. That year she was a runner-up to Kay Stammers at the British Hard Court Championships but in 1937 she won the title after a victory in the final against Peggy Scriven. The same year she won the Riviera Championships at Menton, France, the Pacific Coast Championships in Berkeley, California, and the British Hard Court Championships in Bournemouth.

According to A. Wallis Myers of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, she was ranked in the world top ten in 1936 and 1937 reaching a career high of world No. 1 in 1937. 

After her marriage she limited her playing to some British tournaments. World War II and the birth of her children effectively ended her career as a top player. She did play some tournaments in 1946 and won the Scottish Championships in Edinburgh in July and the Scottish Hard Court Championships held at St. Andrews in August. At Wimbledon she reached second round in the singles event.

==Personal life==
In Santiago she lived in a house within the boundaries of the Quinta Normal Park. In July 1938, at the Brompton Oratory in London, she married Scottish coal merchant and tennis player Ronald Taylor Ellis (d. 1978) and the couple settled in Dundee. They had three daughters. Lizana died of stomach cancer on 21 August 1994.

In 2015 the main court of the national tennis stadium in Santiago was named &quot;Court Central Anita Lizana&quot; in her honor.

<text>&quot;We Are the World&quot; is a charity single recorded by the supergroup USA for Africa in 1985. It was written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie and produced by Quincy Jones and Michael Omartian for the album &quot;We Are the World&quot;. With sales in excess of 20 million physical copies, it is the eighth-best-selling single of all time, meant to raise money for the 1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia.

Soon after the British group Band Aid released &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; in December 1984, musician and activist Harry Belafonte decided to create an American benefit single for African famine relief. Mega-agent Ken Kragen enlisted several musicians for the project. Jackson and Richie completed the writing the night before the first recording session, on January 28, 1985. The event brought together some of the era&#x27;s best-known recording artists, including Bruce Springsteen, Cyndi Lauper, Paul Simon, Stevie Wonder, and Tina Turner. Some major artists, such as Prince, did not participate.

&quot;We Are the World&quot; was released on March 7, 1985, as the first single from the album by Columbia Records. It topped music charts throughout the world and became the fastest-selling U.S. pop single in history. &quot;We Are the World&quot; was certified quadruple platinum, becoming the first single to be certified multi-platinum. Its awards include four Grammy Awards, one American Music Award, and a People&#x27;s Choice Award.

&quot;We Are the World&quot; was promoted with a music video, a VHS, a special edition magazine, a simulcast, and several books, posters, and shirts. The promotion and merchandise helped &quot;We Are the World&quot; raise more than $80 million (equivalent to $ in ) for humanitarian aid in Africa and the United States. Another cast of singers recorded a new version, &quot;We Are the World 25 for Haiti&quot;, to raise relief following the 2010 Haiti earthquake.

==Background==
In 1985, inspired by Band Aid&#x27;s &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; in the UK, the American entertainer and activist Harry Belafonte decided to organize a US equivalent. He planned to have the proceeds donated to a new organization, United Support of Artists for Africa (USA for Africa). The organization would provide food and relief aid for the 1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia, which killed about one million people. Belafonte also planned to set aside money to help eliminate hunger in the United States of America.

Belafonte contacted the entertainment manager and fundraiser Ken Kragen, who enlisted his clients Lionel Richie and Kenny Rogers. In turn, they enlisted Stevie Wonder, to add more &quot;name value&quot;. Quincy Jones was drafted to co-produce, taking time out from his work on the film &quot;The Color Purple&quot;. Jones also telephoned Michael Jackson, who had just concluded a tour with his brothers.

== Writing ==
Jackson told Richie that he wanted to help write the song. The songwriting team originally included Wonder, but his time was constrained by his song-writing for the film &quot;The Woman in Red&quot;. Jackson and Richie wrote &quot;We Are the World&quot; at Hayvenhurst, the Jackson family home in Encino, California. They sought to write a song that would be easy to sing, memorable and anthemic. For a week, they spent every night working on lyrics and melodies in Jackson&#x27;s bedroom. Jackson&#x27;s older sister La Toya recounted the process&quot;:&quot; &quot;I&#x27;d go into the room while they were writing and it would be very quiet, which is odd, since Michael&#x27;s usually very cheery when he works. It was very emotional for them.&quot; She said later that Jackson had written most of the lyrics.
Richie recorded two melodies for &quot;We Are the World&quot;, to which Jackson added music on the same day. Jackson said, &quot;I love working quickly. I went ahead without even Lionel knowing. I couldn&#x27;t wait. I went in and came out the same night with the song completed: drums, piano, strings, and words to the chorus.&quot; Jackson presented his demo to Richie and Jones, who were both shocked; they did not expect him to complete the structure of the song so quickly. The next meetings between Jackson and Richie were unfruitful; they produced no additional vocals and got no work done. On the night of January 21, 1985, the night before the first recording session, Richie and Jackson completed the lyrics and melody.

==Recording==
The first night of recording, January 22, 1985, had tight security on hand, as Richie, Jackson, Wonder, and Jones started work on &quot;We Are the World&quot; at Kenny Rogers&#x27; Lion Share Recording Studio. The studio, on Beverly Boulevard in Los Angeles, was filled with session musicians, technicians, video crews, retinue, assistants, and organizers as the celebrity musicians entered. Jones hired session musicians to lay down the backing tracks: John &quot;JR&quot; Robinson on drums, Louis Johnson on bass, and pianist Greg Phillinganes. (These three first played together on &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop &#x27;Til You Get Enough&quot; produced by Jones for Jackson.) Richie sat down at the piano to teach everyone the song. When it was time to roll tape, Robinson cleared the room of non-musicians, and the backing tracks were recorded. After this, a vocal guide of &quot;We Are the World&quot; was recorded by Richie and Jackson, mixed with the instrumental tracks, and duplicated on tape for each of the invited performers. The guide was recorded on the sixth take, as Jones felt that there was too much &quot;thought&quot; in the previous versions.

Following their work on the vocal guide, Jackson and Jones began thinking of alternatives for the line &quot;There&#x27;s a chance we&#x27;re taking, we&#x27;re taking our own lives&quot;. The pair was concerned that line would be considered a reference to suicide. As the group listened to a playback of the chorus, Richie declared that the last part of the line should be changed to &quot;We&#x27;re &#x27;saving&#x27; our own lives&quot;. Jones also suggested altering the former part of the line. &quot;One thing we don&#x27;t want to do, especially with this group, is look like we&#x27;re patting ourselves on the back. So it&#x27;s really: &#x27;There&#x27;s a &quot;choice&quot; we&#x27;re making.&#x27;&quot; Around 1:30 am, the four musicians ended the night by finishing a chorus of melodic vocalizations, including the sound &quot;sha-lum sha-lin-gay&quot;. Jones told the group that they were not to add anything else to the tape, and said: &quot;If we get too good, someone&#x27;s gonna start playing it on the radio.&quot;

On January 24, 1985, after a day of rest, Jones shipped Richie and Jackson&#x27;s vocal guide to all the artists who would be involved the recording. Enclosed in the package was a letter from Jones imploring the artists not to share the tape or make copies. He wrote: &quot;In the years to come, when your children ask, &#x27;What did mommy and daddy do for the war against world famine?&#x27;, you can say proudly, &quot;this&quot; was your contribution.&quot;
Ken Kragen chaired a production meeting at a bungalow off Sunset Boulevard on January 25, 1985. There, his team discussed where the recording sessions should take place. Kragen was concerned that a leak of the location would trigger a paparazzi frenzy and drive the celebrities away. Jones was concerned about assigning performers to sing solos, saying that so much talent on hand made the task like &quot;putting a watermelon in a Coke bottle&quot;. The following evening, Richie held a choreography session at his home, where it was decided who would stand where.

The final night of recording was held on January 28, 1985, at A&amp;M Recording Studios in Hollywood. Jackson arrived at 8 p.m., earlier than the others, to record his solo section and record a vocal chorus alone. He was joined by the remaining USA for Africa artists, who included Ray Charles, Billy Joel, Diana Ross, Cyndi Lauper, Bruce Springsteen and Tina Turner, and Jackson&#x27;s siblings Jackie, La Toya, Marlon, Randy and Tito. Many of the participants came straight from an American Music Awards ceremony that had been held that night.

Prince, who would have had a part in which he and Michael Jackson sang to each other, did not attend. One newspaper said that Prince did not want to record with other acts; another report, from the time of &quot;We Are the World&quot;&#x27;s recording, suggested that he did not want to partake because the organizer, Bob Geldof, called him a &quot;creep&quot;. During the session, Richie spoke with Prince on the phone, and declined Prince&#x27;s offer to play a guitar solo in a separate room. Instead, Prince donated an exclusive track, &quot;4 the Tears in Your Eyes&quot;, to the &quot;We Are the World&quot; album. Wonder asked Eddie Murphy to participate, but Murphy declined because he was busy recording his single &quot;Party All the Time&quot;. Murphy later said after he &quot;realized what it was, [he] felt like an idiot&quot;. John Denver had asked to participate but was rejected despite his previous commitment to charity work. Ken Kragen said it was due to some people feeling that Denver&#x27;s image would affect the credibility of the song as a pop-rock anthem. &quot;I didn&#x27;t agree with this assessment,&quot; Kragen said, but reluctantly turned Denver down. Denver recalled the rejection in his 1994 autobiography &quot;Take Me Home&quot;, stating that &quot;It broke my heart not to be included.&quot;

More than 45 of America&#x27;s top musicians participated, and another 50 had to be turned away. A sign taped to the studio door read: &quot;Check your ego at the door.&quot; Wonder greeted the musicians as they entered, and said that if the recording was not completed in one take, he and Ray Charles, two blind men, would drive everybody home.

Each performer took their position at around 10:30 p.m. and began to sing. Several hours passed before Wonder announced that he would like to substitute a line in Swahili for the &quot;sha-lum sha-lin-gay&quot; sound, causing Waylon Jennings to leave. A heated debate ensued, in which several artists also rejected the suggestion. The &quot;sha-lum sha-lin-gay&quot; sound ran into opposition as well and was removed. Jennings returned and participated in the recording. The participants eventually decided to sing something meaningful in English. They chose to sing the new line &quot;one world, our children&quot;, which most of the participants enjoyed.

In the early hours of the morning, two Ethiopian women, guests of Wonder, were brought in. They thanked the singers on behalf of their country, bringing several artists to tears. Wonder attempted to lighten the mood, by joking that the recording session gave him a chance to &quot;see&quot; Charles, saying, &quot;We just sort of bumped into each other!&quot; Under the circumstances, the solo parts presented a variety of challenges, but were all successfully recorded that night. The final version was completed at 8 a.m.

==Lyrics==

&quot;We Are the World&quot; is sung from a first-person viewpoint, allowing the audience to &quot;internalize&quot; the message by singing the word &quot;we&quot; together. It has been described as &quot;an appeal to human compassion&quot;. The first lines of the chorus are: &quot;We are the world, we are the children / we are the ones who make a brighter day / so let&#x27;s start giving&quot;.

== Arrangement ==
Lionel Richie, Stevie Wonder, Paul Simon, Kenny Rogers, James Ingram, Tina Turner and Billy Joel sing the first verse; Michael Jackson and Diana Ross sing the first chorus; Dionne Warwick, Willie Nelson and Al Jarreau sing the second verse; Bruce Springsteen, Kenny Loggins, Steve Perry and Daryl Hall sing the second chorus; Jackson, Huey Lewis, Cyndi Lauper, and Kim Carnes sing the bridge. &quot;We Are the World&quot; concludes with Bob Dylan and Ray Charles singing a full chorus, Wonder and Springsteen duetting, and ad libs from Charles and Ingram. The structure is said to &quot;create a sense of continuous surprise and emotional buildup&quot;.

The following people sang in the chorus: Dan Aykroyd, Harry Belafonte, Lindsey Buckingham, Mario Cipollina, Johnny Colla, Sheila E., Bob Geldof, Bill Gibson, Chris Hayes, Sean Hopper, Jackie Jackson, La Toya Jackson, Marlon Jackson, Randy Jackson, Tito Jackson, Waylon Jennings, Bette Midler, John Oates, Jeffrey Osborne, Anita Pointer, June Pointer, Ruth Pointer, and Smokey Robinson.

==Release==
On March 7, 1985, &quot;We Are the World&quot; was released as a single, in both 7-inch and 12-inch formats. The song was the only one released from the &quot;We Are the World&quot; album and became a chart success around the world. In the U.S., it was a number-one hit on the R&amp;B singles chart, the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart, and the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, where it remained for a month. The single had debuted at number 21 on the Hot 100, and it took four weeks for the song to claim the number one spot, half the time a single would normally have taken to reach its charting peak. On the Hot 100, the song moved from 21 to 5 to 2 and then number 1. &quot;We Are the World&quot; might have reached the top of the Hot 100 chart sooner, were it not for the success of Phil Collins&#x27; &quot;One More Night&quot;, which received support from both pop and rock listeners. &quot;We Are the World&quot; also entered &quot;Billboard&quot;s Top Rock Tracks and Hot Country Singles charts, where it peaked at numbers 27 and 76 respectively. The song became the first single since the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Let It Be&quot; to enter &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top 5 within two weeks of release. Outside the U.S., the single reached number one in Australia, France, Ireland, New Zealand, The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. The song peaked at number 2 in two countries: Germany and Austria.

The single was also a commercial success: the initial shipment of 800,000 &quot;We Are the World&quot; records sold out within three days of release. The record became the fastest-selling American pop single in history. At Tower Records in West Hollywood, 1,000 copies of the song were sold in two days. Store worker Richard Petitpas commented, &quot;A number one single sells about 100 to 125 copies a week. This is absolutely unheard of.&quot; By the end of 1985, &quot;We Are the World&quot; had become the year&#x27;s best-selling single. Five years later it was revealed that the song had become the biggest single of the 1980s. &quot;We Are the World&quot; was eventually cited as the best-selling single in U.S. and pop music history. The song became the first single to be certified multi-platinum; it received a 4× certification by the Recording Industry Association of America. The estimated global sales of &quot;We Are the World&quot; are said to be 20 million.

==Reception==
&quot;We Are the World&quot; received mixed reviews. American journalist Greil Marcus felt that it sounded like a Pepsi jingle. He wrote that &quot;the constant repetition of &#x27;There&#x27;s a choice we&#x27;re making&#x27; conflates with Pepsi&#x27;s trademarked &#x27;The choice of a new generation&#x27; in a way that, on the part of Pepsi-contracted song writers Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie, is certainly not intentional, and even more certainly beyond the realm of serendipity.&quot; Marcus added, &quot;In the realm of contextualization, &#x27;We Are the World&#x27; says less about Ethiopia than it does about Pepsi—and the true result will likely be less that certain Ethiopian individuals will live, or anyway live a bit longer than they otherwise would have, than that Pepsi will get the catch phrase of its advertising campaign sung for free by Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder, Bruce Springsteen, and all the rest.&quot; Professor and activist Reebee Garofalo agreed, calling the line &quot;We&#x27;re saving our own lives&quot; a &quot;distasteful element of self-indulgence&quot;. He asserted that the artists of USA for Africa were proclaiming &quot;their own salvation for singing about an issue they will never experience on behalf of a people most of them will never encounter&quot;.

In contrast, Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the phrase &quot;There&#x27;s a choice we&#x27;re making, We&#x27;re saving our own lives&quot;. He wrote that the line assumed &quot;an extra emotional dimension when sung by people with superstar mystiques&quot;. Holden wrote that the song was &quot;an artistic triumph that transcends its official nature&quot;. He noted that unlike Band Aid&#x27;s &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas&quot;, the vocals on &quot;We Are the World&quot; were &quot;artfully interwoven&quot; and emphasized the individuality of each singer. Holden concluded that &quot;We Are the World&quot; was &quot;a simple, eloquent ballad&quot; and a &quot;realized pop statement that would sound outstanding even if it weren&#x27;t recorded by stars&quot;.

The song proved popular with both young and old listeners. People in Columbia, Missouri, reported they bought more than one copy of the single, some buying up to five copies of the record at one time.

According to the music critic and Springsteen biographer Dave Marsh, &quot;We Are the World&quot; was not widely accepted within the rock music community. Marsh said it was dismissed as it was not &quot;a rock record, a critique of the political policies that created the famine, a way of finding out how and why famines occur, an all-inclusive representation of the entire worldwide spectrum of post-Presley popular music&quot;. Though Marsh agreed with some of the criticisms, he felt that, despite its sentimentality, &quot;We Are the World&quot; was a large-scale pop event with serious political overtones.

&quot;We Are the World&quot; was recognized with several awards following its release. At the 1986 Grammy Awards, the song and its music video won four awards: Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and Best Music Video, Short Form. The music video was awarded two honors at the 1985 MTV Video Music Awards. It collected the awards for Best Group Video and Viewer&#x27;s Choice. People&#x27;s Choice Awards recognized &quot;We Are the World&quot; with the Favorite New Song award in 1986. In the same year, the American Music Awards named &quot;We Are the World&quot; &quot;Song of the Year&quot;, and honored organizer Harry Belafonte with the Award of Appreciation. Collecting his award, Belafonte thanked Ken Kragen, Quincy Jones, and &quot;the two artists who, without their great gift would not have inspired us in quite the same way as we were inspired, Mr. Lionel Richie and Mr. Michael Jackson&quot;. Following the speech, the majority of USA for Africa reunited on stage, closing the ceremony with &quot;We Are the World&quot;.

&quot;We Are the World&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2021.

==Marketing and promotion==
&quot;We Are the World&quot; was promoted with a music video, a video cassette, and several other items made available to the public, including books, posters, shirts and buttons. All proceeds from the sale of official USA for Africa merchandise went directly to the famine relief fund. All of the merchandise sold well; the video cassette—titled &quot;We Are the World: The Video Event&quot;—documented the making of the song, and became the ninth-best-selling video of 1985. All of the video elements were produced by Howard G. Malley and Craig B. Golin along with April Lee Grebb as the production supervisor.
The music video showed the recording of &quot;We Are the World&quot;, and drew criticism from some. Michael Jackson was reported to have joked before filming, &quot;People will know it&#x27;s me as soon as they see the socks. Try taking footage of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s socks and see if anyone knows who they belong to.&quot;

The song was also promoted with a special edition of the American magazine &quot;Life&quot;. The publication had been the only media outlet permitted inside A&amp;M Recording Studios on the night of January 28, 1985. All other press organizations were barred from reporting the events leading up to and during &quot;We Are the World&quot;&#x27;s recording. &quot;Life&quot; ran a cover story of the recording session in its April 1985 edition of the monthly magazine. Seven members of USA for Africa were pictured on the cover: Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Cyndi Lauper, Lionel Richie, Michael Jackson, Tina Turner and Willie Nelson. Inside the magazine were photographs of the &quot;We Are the World&quot; participants working and taking breaks.

&quot;We Are the World&quot; received worldwide radio coverage in the form of an international simultaneous broadcast later that year. Upon spinning the song on their local stations, Georgia radio disc jockeys Bob Wolf and Don Briscar came up with the idea for a worldwide simulcast. They called hundreds of radio and satellite stations asking them to participate. On the morning of April 5, 1985 (Good Friday of that year) at 3:50 pm GMT, over 8,000 radio stations simultaneously broadcast the song around the world. As the song was broadcast, hundreds of people sang along on the steps of St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in New York. A year later, on March 28, 1986 (Good Friday of that year), the simultaneous radio broadcast of &quot;We Are the World&quot; was repeated over 6,000 radio stations worldwide.

&quot;We Are the World&quot; gained further promotion and coverage on May 25, 1986, when it was played during a major benefit event held throughout the US. Hands Across America—USA for Africa&#x27;s follow-up project—was an event in which millions of people formed a human chain across the US. The event was held to draw attention to hunger and homelessness in the United States. &quot;We Are the World&quot;&#x27;s co-writer, Michael Jackson, had wanted his song to be the official theme for the event. The other board members of USA for Africa outvoted him, and it was instead decided that a new song would be created and released for the event, titled &quot;Hands Across America&quot;. When released, the new song did not achieve the level of success that &quot;We Are the World&quot; did, and the decision to use it as the official theme for the event led to Jackson—who co-owned the publishing rights to &quot;We Are the World&quot;—resigning from the board of directors of USA for Africa.

==Humanitarian aid==
Four months after the release of &quot;We Are the World&quot;, USA for Africa had taken in almost $10.8 million (equivalent to $ million today). The majority of the money came from record sales within the US. Members of the public also donated money—almost $1.3 million within the same time period. In May 1985, USA for Africa officials estimated that they had sold between $45 million and $47 million worth of official merchandise around the world. Organizer Ken Kragen announced that they would not be distributing all of the money at once. Instead, he revealed that the foundation would be looking into finding a long-term solution for Africa&#x27;s problems. &quot;We could go out and spend it all in one shot. Maybe we&#x27;d save some lives in the short term but it would be like putting a Band-Aid over a serious wound.&quot; Kragen noted that experts had predicted that it would take at least 10 to 20 years to make a slight difference to Africa&#x27;s long-term problems.

In June 1985, the first USA for Africa cargo jet carrying food, medicine, and clothing departed for Ethiopia and Sudan. It stopped &quot;en route&quot; in New York, where 15,000 T-shirts were added to the cargo. Included in the supplies were high-protein biscuits, high-protein vitamins, medicine, tents, blankets and refrigeration equipment. Harry Belafonte, representing the USA for Africa musicians, visited Sudan in the same month. The trip was his last stop on a four-nation tour of Africa. Tanzanian Prime Minister Salim Ahmed Salim greeted and praised Belafonte, telling him, &quot;I personally and the people of Tanzania are moved by this tremendous example of human solidarity.&quot;
One year after the release of &quot;We Are the World&quot;, organizers noted that $44.5 million had been raised for USA for Africa&#x27;s humanitarian fund. They stated that they were confident that they would reach an initial set target of $50 million (equivalent to $ million in 2025). By October 1986, it was revealed that their $50 million target had been met and exceeded; CBS Records gave USA for Africa a check for $2.5 million, drawing the total amount of money to $51.2 million. USA for Africa&#x27;s Hands Across America event had also raised a significant amount of money—approximately $24.5 million for the hungry in the US.

Since its release, &quot;We Are the World&quot; has raised over $80 million (equivalent to $ million today) for humanitarian causes. Ninety percent of the money was pledged to African relief, both long and short term. The long-term initiative included efforts in birth control and food production. The remaining 10 percent of funds was earmarked for domestic hunger and homeless programs in the US. From the African fund, over 70 recovery and development projects were launched in seven African nations. Such projects included aid in agriculture, fishing, water management, manufacturing and reforestation. Training programs were also developed in the African countries of Mozambique, Senegal, Chad, Mauritania, Burkina Faso, and Mali.

Following Jackson&#x27;s death in 2009, Elias Kifle Maraim Beyene, who grew up in Ethiopia and was a beneficiary of the aid provided by the single, related:
==Notable live performances==
&quot;We Are the World&quot; has been performed live by members of USA for Africa on several occasions both together and individually. One of the earliest such performances came in 1985, during the rock music concert Live Aid, which ended with more than 100 musicians singing the song on stage. Harry Belafonte and Lionel Richie made surprise appearances for the live rendition of the song. Michael Jackson would have joined the artists, but was &quot;working around the clock in the studio on a project that he&#x27;s made a major commitment to&quot;, according to his press agent, Norman Winter.

An inaugural celebration was held for US President-elect Bill Clinton in January 1993. The event was staged by Clinton&#x27;s Hollywood friends at the Lincoln Memorial and drew hundreds of thousands of people. Aretha Franklin, LL Cool J, Michael Bolton and Tony Bennett were among some of the musicians in attendance. Said Jones, &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen so many great performers come together with so much love and selflessness.&quot; The celebration included a performance of &quot;We Are the World&quot;, which involved Clinton, his daughter Chelsea, and his wife Hillary singing the song along with USA for Africa&#x27;s Kenny Rogers, Diana Ross and Michael Jackson. &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Edward Rothstein commented on the event, stating, &quot;The most enduring image may be of Mr. Clinton singing along in &#x27;We Are the World&#x27;, the first President to aspire, however futilely, to hipness.&quot;

As a prelude to his song &quot;Heal the World&quot;, &quot;We Are the World&quot; was performed as an interlude during two of Michael Jackson&#x27;s tours, the Dangerous World Tour (1992–1993) and the HIStory World Tour (1996–1997), as well as Jackson&#x27;s performance at the Super Bowl XXVII halftime show in 1993. Jackson briefly performed the song with a chorus at the 2006 World Music Awards in London, which marked his last live public performance. Jackson planned to use the song for his This Is It comeback concerts at the O2 Arena in London from 2009 to 2010, but the shows were cancelled due to his sudden death.

Michael Jackson died in June 2009, after suffering a cardiac arrest. His memorial service was held several days later on July 7, and was reported to have been viewed by more than one billion people. The finale of the event featured group renditions of the Jackson anthems &quot;We Are the World&quot; and &quot;Heal the World&quot;. The singalong of &quot;We Are the World&quot; was led by Darryl Phinnessee, who had worked with Jackson since the late 1980s. It also featured co-writer Lionel Richie and Jackson&#x27;s family, including his children. Following the performance, &quot;We Are the World&quot; re-entered the US charts for the first time since its 1985 release. The song debuted at number 50 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Digital Songs chart.

==25 for Haiti==


On January 12, 2010, a magnitude-7.0 earthquake struck Haiti, the island&#x27;s most severe earthquake in over 200 years. The epicenter of the quake was just outside the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince. The Haitian government confirmed the deaths of over 230,000 civilians because of the disaster and the injuries of around 300,000. Approximately 1.2 million people were homeless and the lack of temporary shelter may have led to the outbreak of disease.

To raise money for earthquake victims, a new celebrity version of &quot;We Are the World&quot; was recorded on February 1, 2010, and released on February 12, 2010. Over 75 musicians were involved in the remake, which was recorded in the same studio as the 1985 original. The new version features revised lyrics as well as a rap part pertaining to Haiti. Michael Jackson&#x27;s younger sister Janet duets with her late brother on the track, as per a request from their mother Katherine. In the video and on the track, archival material of Michael Jackson is used from the original 1985 recording. This version is also infamous for the way Wyclef sings towards the end of the song, fluctuating his voice in a manner that sounds like, as a music writer for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; called it, &quot;Not unlike a cross between a fire siren and the sound of Wyclef giving himself a hernia.&quot;

On February 20, 2010, a non-celebrity remake, &quot;We Are the World 25 for Haiti (YouTube edition)&quot;, was posted to the video sharing website YouTube. Internet personality and singer-songwriter Lisa Lavie conceived and organized the Internet collaboration of 57 unsigned or independent YouTube musicians geographically distributed around the world. Lavie&#x27;s 2010 YouTube version, a cover of the 1985 original, excludes the rap segment and minimizes the Auto-tune that characterizes the 2010 celebrity remake. Another 2010 remake of the original is the Spanish-language &quot;Somos El Mundo&quot;. It was written by Emilio Estefan and his wife Gloria Estefan, and produced by Emilio, Quincy Jones and Univision Communications, the company that funded the project.

==Legacy==
&quot;We Are the World&quot; has been recognized as a politically important song, which &quot;affected an international focus on Africa that was simply unprecedented&quot;. It has been credited with creating a climate in which musicians from around the world felt inclined to follow. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Stephen Holden, since the release of &quot;We Are the World&quot;, it has been noted that movement has been made within popular music to create songs that address humanitarian concerns. &quot;We Are the World&quot; was also influential in subverting the way music and meaning were produced, showing that musically and racially diverse musicians could work together both productively and creatively. &quot;Ebony&quot; described the January 28 recording session, in which Quincy Jones brought together a multi-racial group, as being &quot;a major moment in world music that showed we can change the world&quot;. &quot;We Are the World&quot;, along with Live Aid and Farm Aid, demonstrated that rock music had become more than entertainment, but a political and social movement. Journalist Robert Palmer noted that such songs and events had the ability to reach people around the world, send them a message, and then get results.

Since the release of &quot;We Are the World&quot;, and the Band Aid single that influenced it, numerous songs have been recorded in a similar fashion, with the intent to aid disaster victims throughout the world. One such example involved a supergroup of Latin musicians billed as &quot;Hermanos del Tercer Mundo&quot;, or &quot;Brothers of the Third World&quot;. Among the supergroup of 62 recording artists were Julio Iglesias, José Feliciano, and Sérgio Mendes. Their famine relief song was recorded in the same studio as &quot;We Are the World&quot;. Half of the profits raised from the charity single was pledged to USA for Africa. The rest of the money was to be used for impoverished Latin American countries. Other notable examples include the 1989 cover of the Deep Purple song &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; by a supergroup of hard rock, prog rock, and heavy metal musicians collaborating as Rock Aid Armenia to raise money for victims of the devastating 1988 Armenian earthquake, the 1986 all-star OPM single &quot;Handog ng Pilipino sa Mundo&quot;, which talked about the optimism the Filipinos needed after the People Power Revolution, the 1997 Star Records all-star recording &quot;Sa Araw ng Pasko&quot;, the 2003 all-star OPM recording &quot;Biyahe Tayo&quot; which promoted Philippine tourism and its subsequent 2011 remake &quot;Pilipinas, Tara Na!&quot; and the 2009 all-star OPM recordings &quot;Star ng Pasko&quot; and &quot;Kaya Natin Ito!&quot; as a means to provide hope to the survivors of Typhoon Ketsana (locally known as Ondoy). Several GMA Network personalities also recorded another inspirational ballad, &quot;Bangon Kaibigan&quot; in 2013 to provide hope to the survivors of Typhoon Haiyan (locally known as Yolanda).

The 20th anniversary of &quot;We Are the World&quot; was celebrated in 2005. Radio stations around the world paid homage to USA for Africa&#x27;s creation by simultaneously broadcasting the charity song. In addition to the simulcast, the milestone was marked by the release of a two-disc DVD called &quot;We Are the World: The Story Behind the Song&quot;. Ken Kragen asserted that the reason behind the simulcast and DVD release was not for USA for Africa to praise themselves for doing a good job, but to &quot;use it to do some more good [for the original charity]. That&#x27;s all we care about accomplishing.&quot; Harry Belafonte also commented on the 20th anniversary of the song. He acknowledged that &quot;We Are the World&quot; had &quot;stood the test of time&quot;; anyone old enough to remember it can still at least hum along.

On January 29, 2024, a documentary titled &quot;The Greatest Night in Pop&quot;, was released on Netflix. The documentary, which was directed by Bao Nguyen, chronicles the obstacles and the behind-the-scenes stories that led to the creation of the song. The documentary features new interviews with Lionel Richie, Bruce Springsteen, Huey Lewis, Dionne Warwick, Cyndi Lauper and others involved with the song who reflect on the song and its legacy.

<text>Bylany is a Danubian Neolithic (New Stone Age) archaeological site located around east of Prague in the Czech region of Bohemia. Excavation began in 1955 and work continues today.

Bylany (Bohemia, Czech Republic), in addition to Eythra (Saxony, Germany), Herxheim (Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany), Těšetice (Moravia, Czech Republic), is regarded as the residential area for the first farmers in Europe and one of the largest Neolithic settlements in Central Europe. The area is agricultural and consists of many streams, ravines, and marshlands.

The archaeological site at Bylany was the area of two defining Danubian cultures, the Linear Pottery culture (from German: Linearbandkeramik), often abbreviated as LBK, and the Stroked Pottery culture (from German: Stichbandkeramik), often abbreviated as STK. The LBK culture is theorised to have covered the period between 5600-5000 cal. BC, and the STK culture the period between 5000-4400 cal. BC. These dates are contested, and some archaeologists place the dates of the LBK culture closer to 5500-4900/4950 cal. BC.

Excavations and studies over the years have unearthed many artefacts of the Neolithic period. These include pottery fragments (LBK and STK origins), and stone tools. Studies have also uncovered non-moveable features of the period these include longhouses and rondels identified using non-destructive methodologies i.e. aerial and geophysical prospection, and other methods such as magneto-metric analysis. Pottery is used by archaeologists to determine the chronology of events at Bylany as the differing of styles and techniques to decorate and create suggests the time period and culture that produced the artefact. Czech archaeologists in Prague have sort to make a digitised museum to present the site to a global audience. This has been accomplished by using technologies such as Optical 3D scanning, 3D photogrammetry, and 3D modelling.

== Landscape ==
The landscape of the area is agricultural in its nature. The most common soil in the settlement area is a fertile brown earth on a loess base. The sections of the site are separated by streams, ravines, or marshland.

== Cultures ==
The Czech Republic is a Central European country, the site at Bylany was once the home to the oldest agricultural population of the Neolithic period in this section of Europe. Pottery varying in its decorative styling is the only artefact that can delineate the precise chronology of the Neolithic cultures at Bylany. Information centring on the cultural populations within the Neolithic settlements are not solidified with some archaeologists suggesting that the populations were not &quot;culturally unified&quot; but rather a diverse group of inhabitants. The multiformity is proposed in theory to not be isolated just to social aspects but to be associated with economic or subsistence characteristics.

=== Linear Pottery Culture ===
The Linear Pottery culture (LBK) comes from the German word ‘Linearbandkeramik’, which translates to ‘linear band pottery’. The name is derived from the style of pottery decoration used by the culture, more so the incised lines or bands. Bylany is one of the largest LBK settlements in central Europe. The genesis of the LBK is thought to be in the Carpathian basin. Estimates place the culture at the site at around 5600-5500 cal. BC until approximately 5000-4900 cal. BC. The LBK period at Bylany is thought to have had 25 settlement phases.

=== Stroked Pottery Culture ===
The Stroked Pottery culture (STK), originating from the German word ‘Stichbandkeramik’ translating into English “Stitch band pottery”, was the successor to the LBK. The culture gets its name from the different style of pottery decoration used, which was the narrower engraved lines, increased density of strokes, and proliferation of engraved lines with punctures. The estimated timeline of the culture is the period between 5000 cal. BC and 4400 cal. BC. These dates are conflicted with one study suggesting the date is 4950-4400 cal. BC.

== Artefacts ==

Since the first excavations in the 1950s, the archaeological site at Bylany has yielded a varying degree of Neolithic artefacts including pottery fragments, lithics, grinding tools, chipped stone (flints), polished stone (axes and adzes), whetstones (abrading, smoothing, and polishing tools), hand stones, and non-moveable pits, postholes, and ditches. 

=== Pottery ===
The changing of pottery style is the feature that defines the chronology of the LBK and STK cultures. The pottery differs in decorative features with both cultures using numerous characteristics that differentiated one another. LBK cultures can be seen to have used engraved broad grooves, engraved lines, engraved bands filled with punctures, engraved lines with punctures, dense punctures on a very fine engraved line, independent punctures, and engraved lines with adjacent punctures. The STK cultures began to use narrower engraved lines, increased density of strokes, and proliferation of engraved lines with punctures.

==== Types of pottery ====
Two units of pottery were created; coarse ceramics (course ware) and fine ceramics (fine ware), both with individual uses in society. Course ware can be identified by its course, thick walls, whereas fine ware was of an elegant appearance typically with engraved linear decorations. Fine ware is thought to have needed a great proficiency as the decorations were more complex (incised lines), whereas course ware did not necessary demand this skill. Various cases have found that LBK and STK fine ware share commonalities. Course ware is theorised to have been used for food preparation, storage, and packaging. Fine ware in contrast is believed to have been used for food consumption.

==== Manufacturing techniques ====
Archaeologists use modern technology such as micro-tomography (uCT) as one way to determine the manufacturing technique used to create the pottery. This technique was created to visualise the inner structure of i.e. pottery sherds. The digital creation shows the porous structure and geometrical parameters (total porosity, pore size distribution and pore shape). This technique is able to identify the organic temper in cases where all the organic material is burnt due to the firing process in hardening the pottery paste.

LBK Neolithic pottery was created by a facet of techniques. One technique is the coiling of the potters clay. The clay is rolled out into a cylindrical shape. The clay is then coiled and layered onto one another forming any basic or more complex structure desired.

Archaeologists theorise techniques in which the pottery was tempered. One theorised technique is adding cow-dung in varying ratios to be used for tempering the clay, this may increase the clays plasticity. A modern study tested the hypothesis that dung was used in the crafting of pottery. The study suggests that the &quot;presence of gel-forming hydrated organic polymers increases the clay&#x27;s plasticity&quot;. The porous nature of the resultant vessel may also serve to preserve water in warmer condition as the pot keeps the contents cool by permitting slow evaporation through the porous walls. Other organic tempering materials may have been used by the LBK such as wood and straw, these materials leave voids in the pottery with specific morphology.

==== Atypical pottery ====
Socio-economic status and or newcomers from other LBK settlements are theorised to have produced atypical decorations on pottery. This theory is postulated on the basis that the finding of these types of fragments are in smaller houses.

=== Structures ===
None of the physical structures remain from the Neolithic period at Bylany, rather they have left imprints to the likes of pits, post holes, grooves and foundation trenches in the ground and archaeologist are able to decrypt their formal and spatial relationship.

==== Longhouses ====

One common structure includes longhouses, referred to as European Neolithic longhouses, which were made of wooden timber framing and wattle daub walls and typically ranged in length between four and fifty meters, with early studies (1950s) and more recent (2013) studies placing the average between six and twenty meters. Long houses were typically a quadrangular shape. The elevation of these structures is debated, as it is unknown if the houses were on terrain level or elevated. Long houses are thought to have originated in the Carpathian basin, specifically in western Hungary. Past research suggested that longhouses were rather from the western section of central Europe, as this type of finding was rare in the Carpathian basin. Recent excavations in Transdanubia (Hungry) has provided evidence of sedentary life and the formative period. It uncovered the earliest Central European house type. Extensive excavations in the Balaton region and across Transdanubia have also revealed 45,050 LBK houses (arranged in regular rows). The finding of LBK houses in the Transdanubia has risen ten-fold.

==== Rondels ====
A typical structure in agricultural areas of Central Europe (including Bylany) are rondels, sometimes referred to as earthworks enclosures, circular ditched enclosures, or Kreisgrabenanlagen. They are circular ditched enclosures, usually with palisades forming what is speculated to be some sort of defensive structure. Rondels date to at least the fifth millennium BC and can be associated with both the LBK and STK cultures. The artefacts were identified using non-destructive methods i.e. aerial or geophysical prospection. Issues arise with these methodologies as the thick layer of loess beneath the topsoil does not allow for clear visualisation of these features. Some studies have opted to use magneto-metric (Geometrics G-806 and G-816 proton magnetometers, Geoscan Research FM-36 single fluxgate gradiometer, and the Magneto-Arch five-channel fluxgate gradiometer system with FMG-650B fluxgate gradiometer) surveying techniques. The Bohemia region alone has uncovered 30 Neolithic rondels, archaeologist are adamant that there are a greater number yet to be discovered. In the 1980s the postulated and &quot;archaeologically anticipated&quot; double ditched circular enclosure was documented. The specifications for the double ditched enclosure were: Inner ditch 90m diameter, 2.2m width, and a 1.3m depth; Outer ditch 110m diameter, 2.4m width, and a 1.3m depth. Later studies (1990-1992) identified a third outer ditch, which was considered to be irregular. 

== Modernisation of the Bylany site ==

Czech archaeologists from the Institute of Archaeology (Prague) argued that the Neolithic site at Bylany was virtually “invisible”, meaning it was indistinguishable from the modern landscape, to the public. This is due to the artefacts and evidence of the LBK and STK cultures being buried underneath layers of earth. This is also the case for other Neolithic sites in Europe (Eythra, Herxheim, and Těšetice). They sort to modernise the typical “brick and mortar” museums, which “seek visitors only from within a limited target group”, and used modern technologies, optical 3D scanning, 3D Photogrammetry, and 3D Modelling, to create digital composites which formed a virtual gallery or virtual museum. The composed artefacts can display textual, visual, and spatial characters building a virtual three-dimensional artefact (e.g., pottery, lithics and grinding tools), which can be accessed via e.g. a portal electronic device (smartphone, tablet, and laptop). Providing a further explanation that the &quot;rapid advances of information technologies globally (high speed internet and computers etc.) created room for a change”.

=== Optical 3D scanning ===
Optical 3D scanning is not new in the field of archaeology. It can scan an object or environment and create a point cloud of the sample, which can be reconstructed to create a three-dimensional image which can, if chosen, display colour and texture. This type of device has the advantage of creating realistic spatial models of the artefact. The device used in this study was the smartSCAN-3D scanner.

=== 3D photogrammetry ===
Multi-image photogrammetry uses multiple images in conjunction with specific software to create three-dimensional objects. This study used Photomodeler and ImageMaster as the processing software. It has enabled archaeologists to digitise immovable objects. 

=== 3D modelling ===
Three-dimensional models are created using the two-dimensional data i.e., floor plans and aerial photos. After a preliminary image is created extra layers are added such as the roofing, string walls and interior and exterior equipment. The authors of this report opted to use the programme Blender (open source).

=== Importance ===
The Neolithic period (9500 cal. BC – 1900 cal. BC), which current evidence (cultivation and animal domestication) suggests began in southwest Asia in 9500 cal. BC, changed the way we as human survived and diminished the necessity of hunting and gathering with the adoption of farming and animal keeping. Evidence found at Bylany (settlement agglomeration) and even Eythra (wooden water wells), Herxheim (rondels with human remains), and Těšetice (circle wall enclosures), have shifted the insight into the first European farmers.

<text>Jorge Luis &quot;Peco&quot; González Rivera (born 20 December 1952) is a former Puerto Rican Olympic runner. He achieved victory in numerous races and participated in various international events, including the Pan American Games and the Olympic Games. In 1982, he set the all-time record for the Ponce Marathon, a record that, as of 2023, remains unbroken.

==Biography==
González gained significant fame in Puerto Rico, where he is affectionately known as &quot;Peco&quot; (after Pecos Bill, &quot;the fastest cowboy to ever live&quot;). Despite high expectations at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, California, he did not secure any Olympic medals.

The peak of his popularity was during the 1980s, marked by national tours across Puerto Rico, autograph signings at department stores, and appearances in television commercials.

González, a native of Utuado, Puerto Rico, still resides there. The city hosts the &quot;Jorge &quot;Peco&quot; González Coliseum,&quot; named in his honor.

González&#x27;s first marriage to Aida Luz Reyes resulted in his only daughter, Katherine González, who currently resides in the United States.

==Athletics career==
At the 1983 Pan American Games in Caracas, Venezuela, he secured Puerto Rico&#x27;s first Pan American athletics gold medal.

<text>Sandia Base was the principal nuclear weapons installation of the United States Department of Defense from 1946 to 1971. It was located on the southeastern edge of Albuquerque, New Mexico. For 25 years, the top-secret Sandia Base and its subsidiary installation, Manzano Base, carried on the atomic weapons research, development, design, testing, and training commenced by the Manhattan Project during World War II. Fabrication, assembly, and storage of nuclear weapons was also done at Sandia Base. The base played a key role in the United States nuclear deterrence capability during the Cold War. In 1971 it was merged into Kirtland Air Force Base.

==Geography==
Sandia Base was located at about 35° 02&#x27; 25&quot; N, 106° 32&#x27; 59&quot; W at an elevation above sea level. It was in the southeast quadrant of Albuquerque, bounded roughly by Louisiana Boulevard SE and Kirtland Air Force Base on the west, and Eubank Avenue SE and the Sandia Mountains on the east, and Isleta Pueblo lands on the south. There were security gates on Gibson Avenue SE and Wyoming Boulevard SE.

==Early history==

The base was created on the site formerly occupied by Oxnard Field, once the major Albuquerque airport. A competing airport took most of the local traffic in the 1930s. The U.S. Army bought the field after 1939.

==Transition to nuclear weapons activities==
Leslie Groves and Robert Oppenheimer faced the challenges of turning a war-driven, short-term bomb design effort into a stable peacetime operation in charge of producing and maintaining a nuclear stockpile for the nation. A serious short-term problem was retaining personnel, particularly at Los Alamos where many scientists and technicians were eager to return to civilian pursuits. The solutions to the challenges led directly to the transformation of Albuquerque&#x27;s old Oxnard Field into the nation&#x27;s principal nuclear weapons installation.

Atomic Bomb engineering was carried out by the Z Division, named for its director, Dr. Jerrold R. Zacharias from Los Alamos. Z Division was conceived as an ordnance design, testing, and assembly arm. However, space was at a premium at Los Alamos. Additionally, members of Z Division needed to work closely with the military. Groves also decided as part of an effort to retain personnel to focus the laboratory more on weapons development by relocating various weapons production and assembly activities away from Los Alamos. Thus, the decision was taken to move Z Division to the old Oxnard Field. Already at the close of the war, the engineering group of Z Division had begun consolidating weapons assembly functions there. Z Division was initially located at Wendover Field, Utah but moved to Oxnard Field, New Mexico, in September 1945 to be closer to Los Alamos. By 1946, the site was being referred to as &quot;Sandia Base&quot; after the nearby Sandia Mountains.

In January 1947, the rest of Z Division completed its move to Sandia Base. That same month, Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson and Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal established the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP) to assume all of the military functions of the Manhattan Engineering District. The ASWP took over the Albuquerque base. Z Division and AFSWP brought to Sandia Base the strict secrecy which had prevailed at Los Alamos. In 1947, amid much public speculation about what was going on at Sandia Base, the military would only say that the activities at Sandia Base were secret under the Atomic Energy Act. When Secretary of the Army Kenneth Claiborne Royall visited Sandia Base in 1948, he falsely announced that &quot;guided missile&quot; development was underway at the base.

==The Armed Forces Special Weapons Project and its successors==
AFSWP was given responsibility for discharging all military functions relating to atomic energy in coordination with the Atomic Energy Commission. General Groves was placed in charge, and reported directly to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Concerned about the postwar status of the nation&#x27;s nuclear stockpile, Groves had already dispatched Col. Gilbert M. Dorland to Sandia Base to evaluate the engineering efforts being made there. Dorland eventually assembled a group of about sixty young Army officers, later nicknamed the &quot;Sandia Pioneers,&quot; to oversee the bomb fabrication efforts. Dorland also established a nuclear weapons training school at Sandia Base.

The Pioneers learned and practiced how to assemble atomic bombs and how to load them onto aircraft for long range missions. The aircraft used for these practice missions were Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers similar to the ones that flew the first atomic missions over Japan in 1945. The Pioneers and the 509th Bombardment Group (successor to the 509th Composite Group that flew the 1945 missions) flew the practice missions from Kirtland AFB to Wendover, Utah. The 509th was stationed at Walker Air Force Base near Roswell, New Mexico.

On April 12, 1950, a B-29 from the 509th Bombardment Group crashed at Sandia Base shortly after takeoff. Thirteen crewmen were killed. The military imposed strict security over the crash site. The official version of the crash stated that the B-29 was on a routine &quot;navigation training flight.&quot; The Air Force said the B-29 had taken off from Walker AFB and had landed at Kirtland AFB to &quot;refuel.&quot;

At Sandia Base, the Pioneers worked with Sandia Laboratory and the AEC to perfect the design, assembly, storage, and delivery of atomic weapons. In 1948, the Pioneers supported Operation Sandstone, the atmospheric test series at Eniwetok Atoll in the Marshall Islands.

The Sandstone test series was successful, but logistics, weather, security, and safety suggested the need for a continental test site. Thus, AFSWP conducted a top secret study, named Project Nutmeg, to search for such a site. In 1950, AFSWP concluded that a site on the Air Force&#x27;s Las Vegas Bombing and Gunnery Range in Nevada was the right place. President Truman approved the location, known as Frenchman Flat.

The first post-war continental atomic test was conducted on January 27, 1951. A weapon assembled at Sandia Base was dropped from a Boeing B-50 Superfortress (&quot;D&quot; model) bomber in the successful &quot;Able&quot; shot. Thereafter, some 927 atmospheric and underground nuclear tests occurred at what is now known as the Nevada Test Site. These tests were supported by AFSWP and its successors from Sandia Base and its successor.

A United States Naval Air Detachment of eleven aircraft assigned to Sandia Base in June 1949 was sequentially renamed the Naval Air Special Weapons Facility (NASWF) in August 1952, the Naval Nuclear Ordnance Evaluation Unit (NNOEU) in 1958, and the Naval Weapons Evaluation Facility (NWEF) in March 1961. Before the NWEF ceased flight test operations in September 1992, nuclear compatibility and safety certification had been completed for 76 versions of 32 different Navy nuclear-capable fighter and attack aircraft. Following accidents aboard in 1966 and in 1967, NWEF applied nuclear safety protocols to develop procedures to safely stow, handle, transport, assemble, disassemble, preload, load, unload, arm, dearm, rearm, and deliver non-nuclear aviation ordnance including bombs, torpedoes, naval mines, missiles and conventional stores from sonobuoys to Air-Delivered Seismic Intrusion Detectors (ADSID).

In 1959, because AFSWP was redesignated the Defense Atomic Support Agency (DASA), the Sandia Base was designated Headquarters Field Command, DASA. Over the next dozen years, Field Command was headed by Army, Navy, and Air Force officers.

Sandia Base personnel were dispatched to assist in two major incidents involving the loss and recovery of nuclear weapons in the 1960s. In 1966, a Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bomber and a Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker air refueling plane collided in mid-air over the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Spain. This event is referred to as the Palomares incident. Three of four missing nuclear weapons were found on land near the fishing village of Palomares in Spain. The fourth was found in the sea after a lengthy search. The second incident occurred in 1968 when a B-52 bomber crashed near Thule, Greenland. Three weapons were recovered; a fourth is believed to remain in the ocean.

Always on the itinerary of key political figures, Sandia Base hosted President John F. Kennedy on December 7, 1962. On April 17, 1966, Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey toured facilities at Sandia Base.
In 1971, DASA was redesignated Defense Nuclear Agency. The field activities remained at Sandia Base, which was merged into Kirtland Air Force Base. Defense Nuclear Agency returned to its roots by being renamed Defense Special Weapons Agency (DSWA) without further change of mission or functions in 1996. DSWA was abolished, effective October 1, 1998, with functions transferred to the newly established Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA).

==Sandia National Laboratories==
After the move to Sandia Base, Los Alamos Laboratory&#x27;s Z Division grew to almost 500 people, and became a separate branch of Los Alamos on April 1, 1948. Named Sandia Laboratory, the organization continued to grow to approximately 1000 employees by mid-1948.

The University of California, long-time manager of Los Alamos, indicated that it no longer desired to be involved in the engineering part of nuclear weapons development. Thus, in 1949, AT&amp;T&#x27;s manufacturing arm, Western Electric, accepted the management role on a no-profit, no-fee basis. Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Western Electric, was formed to manage the lab. AT&amp;T maintained the contract until 1993 when Martin Marietta (now Lockheed Martin) took over. The largest organization at Sandia Base, it became Sandia National Laboratories in 1979. It now operates facilities in Albuquerque and Livermore, California. The organization continues to expand into new areas of research, such as renewable energy sources.

==Manzano Base==
In August, 1947, the Denver Post ran a story that claimed the military was building a secret base consisting of huge caverns for atomic weapons defense purposes. The Post said the new base was in the Manzano Mountains southeast of Sandia Base. The military responded by issuing a statement that operations and construction near Sandia Base were top-secret. In fact, however, the AFSWP was building one of several bases around the country that would be used for nuclear weapons storage. The AFSWP code-named the base &quot;Site Able.&quot;

Construction of Site Able was delayed by a strike in which laborers demanded a 25-cent per hour increase in their minimum wage of $1.75 per hour.

On February 22, 1952, the now-completed Site Able was renamed Manzano Base and turned over to the operational control of the Air Force. The Denver Post story apparently was correct insofar as it described the general nature of the base. What appeared to be secure bunkers were visible to people (mostly military personnel) who went to a recreational camping area nearby known as Coyote Canyon. The military, however, never officially confirmed the nature of the activities at Manzano Base. At one point, a military spokesman said that Manzano Base had nothing to do with Sandia Base. Manzano has since been identified as the first of six original National Stockpile Sites (NSS) (for nuclear weapons). The other original NSS installations similar to Manzano were: Site Baker at Killeen Base, adjacent to Gray Air Force Base and Fort Hood, Texas; Site Charlie at Campbell Air Force Base and adjacent to Fort Campbell (Tennessee and Kentucky); Site Dog at Bossier Base, adjacent to Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana; Lake Mead Base, adjacent to Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada; and Medina Base, adjacent to Lackland Air Force Base, Texas.

On July 1, 1971, Manzano Base was merged, along with Sandia Base, into Kirtland Air Force Base.

==Other incidents at Sandia Base==
On March 8, 1950, a fire of undetermined origin swept through the stockade at Sandia Base, killing fourteen prisoners. Several officers and military firefighters were seriously injured.

On May 22, 1957, a B-36 ferrying a nuclear weapon from Biggs AFB to Kirtland AFB dropped a nuclear weapon on approach to Kirtland AFB. The weapon impacted the ground 4.5 miles south of the Kirtland control tower and 0.3 miles west of the Sandia Base reservation. The weapon was completely destroyed by the detonation of its high explosive material, creating a crater 12 feet deep and 25 feet in diameter. Radioactive contamination at the crater lip amounted to 0.5 milliroentgen.

==The Sandia Base community==
Because of the presence of the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project and its successors, Sandia Base had military personnel of all of the services, as well as Department of Defense civilian employees. Sandia Lab brought more civilians to the base community.

Although most of the base was restricted, the rest of the base resembled other U.S. military installations in the world. By the 1950s, there were places for several thousand military family members to live, shop, attend school, recreate, and worship. The Army was in charge of running these parts of the base.

Housing for military families existed in three areas of Sandia Base. In the southwest corner of the base was an area of Wherry housing, known as Zia Park. On the northwest side of the base was an area of Capehart housing, known as Pershing Park. This area stretched from Wyoming Boulevard almost to the Gibson Avenue gate. East of Wyoming Boulevard was an area of Capehart housing, known informally as &quot;The Loops,&quot; because the streets were circular and had names such as 10th Loop, 11th Loop, etc.

Zia Park was once thought to house chemical warfare training; however, the only evidence suggesting chemical warfare training as reported by Kirtland AFB personnel is an old hand drawn map identifying this area as a chemical warfare training area. No other recorded maps have identified this area as a chemical training area, so the exact history of this site is in question. KAFB personnel thought this site was used during WWII, as a possible tear gas training site.

There were two schools on the base. Sandia Base Elementary School was on Wyoming Boulevard between Pershing Park and the Loops; Wherry Elementary School was located in Zia Park. Both schools were, and still are, operated by the Albuquerque Public Schools system. Older children from Sandia Base attended Van Buren Junior High School, just outside the base, and Highland High School in southeast Albuquerque.

Sandia Base had an officers club, an NCO club, a commissary, a base exchange, a movie theater, a swimming pool, a library, and a teen club. Sandia Base also had a club for civilian employees. There were two chapels, a hospital, and a pre-school on the base.

==Merger with Kirtland Air Force Base==
On July 1, 1971, Sandia Base and Manzano Base were merged into Kirtland Air Force Base, their neighbor to the west. The merger was concurrent with the change of DASA into the Defense Nuclear Agency. The Air Force took over host responsibilities for the nation&#x27;s military nuclear weapons program.

<text>Lateral medullary syndrome is a neurological disorder causing a range of symptoms due to ischemia in the lateral part of the medulla oblongata in the brainstem. The ischemia is a result of a blockage most commonly in the vertebral artery or the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. Lateral medullary syndrome is also called Wallenberg&#x27;s syndrome, posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) syndrome and vertebral artery syndrome.

==Signs and symptoms==

This syndrome is characterized by sensory deficits that affect the trunk and extremities contralaterally (opposite to the lesion), and sensory deficits of the face and cranial nerves ipsilaterally (same side as the lesion). Specifically a loss of pain and temperature sensation if the lateral spinothalamic tract is involved. The cross body finding is a highly suggestive symptom from which the diagnosis may be considered (however, this a symptom common to all brainstem pathology).

Patients often have difficulty walking or maintaining balance (ataxia), or difficulty in differentiating the temperature of an object based on which side of the body the object of varying temperature is touching. Some patients may walk with a slant or experience skew deviation and illusions of room tilt. The nystagmus is commonly associated with vertigo spells. These vertigo spells can result in falling, caused from the involvement of the region of Deiters&#x27; nucleus.

Common symptoms of lateral medullary syndrome may include difficulty swallowing, or dysphagia. This can be caused by the involvement of the nucleus, as it supplies the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves. Slurred speech (dysarthria), and disordered vocal quality (dysphonia) are also common. The damage to the cerebellum or the inferior cerebellar peduncle can cause ataxia. Damage to the hypothalamospinal fibers disrupts sympathetic nervous system relay and produces symptoms that are similar to the symptoms caused by Horner&#x27;s syndrome – such as miosis, anhidrosis and partial ptosis.

Palatal myoclonus, the twitching of the muscles of the mouth, may be observed due to disruption of the central tegmental tract. Other symptoms include hoarseness, nausea, vomiting, a decrease in sweating, problems with body temperature sensation, dizziness, difficulty walking, and difficulty maintaining balance. Lateral medullary syndrome can also cause bradycardia, a slow heart rate, and increases or decreases in the patient&#x27;s average blood pressure.

===Based on location===
==Cause==

It is the clinical manifestation resulting from occlusion of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) or one of its branches or of the vertebral artery, in which the lateral part of the medulla oblongata infarcts, resulting in a typical pattern. The most commonly affected artery is PICA, specifically the lateral medullary segment. 

==Diagnosis==

Since lateral medullary syndrome is often caused by a stroke, diagnosis is time dependent. Diagnosis is usually done by assessing vestibular-related symptoms in order to determine where in the medulla that the infarction has occurred. Head Impulsive Nystagmus Test of Skew (HINTS) examination of oculomotor function is often performed, along with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assist in stroke detection. Standard stroke assessment must be done to rule out a concussion or other head trauma.

==Treatment==

Treatment for lateral medullary syndrome is dependent on how quickly it is identified. Treatment for lateral medullary syndrome involves focusing on relief of symptoms and active rehabilitation to help patients return to their daily activities. Many patients undergo speech therapy. Depressed mood and withdrawal from society can be seen in patients following the initial onslaught of symptoms.

In more severe cases, a feeding tube may need to be inserted through the mouth or a gastrostomy may be necessary if swallowing is impaired. In some cases, medication may be used to reduce or eliminate residual pain. Some studies have reported success in mitigating the chronic neuropathic pain associated with the syndrome with anti-epileptics such as gabapentin. Long-term treatment generally involves the use of antiplatelets like aspirin or clopidogrel and statin regimen for the rest of their lives in order to minimize the risk of another stroke. Warfarin is used if atrial fibrillation is present. Other medications may be necessary in order to suppress high blood pressure and risk factors associated with strokes. A blood thinner may be prescribed to a patient in order to break up the infarction and reestablish blood flow and to try to prevent future infarctions.

One of the most unusual and difficult to treat symptoms that occur due to Wallenberg syndrome are interminable, violent hiccups. The hiccups can be so severe that patients often struggle to eat, sleep and carry on conversations. Depending on the severity of the blockage caused by the stroke, the hiccups can last for weeks. Unfortunately, there are very few successful medications available to remediate the inconvenience of constant hiccups.

For dysphagia symptoms, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has been shown to assist in rehabilitation. Overall, traditional stroke assessment and outcomes are used to treat patients, since lateral medullary syndrome is often caused by a stroke in the lateral medulla.

==Prognosis==
The outlook for someone with lateral medullary syndrome depends upon the size and location of the area of the brain stem damaged by the stroke. Some individuals may see a decrease in their symptoms within weeks or months, while others may be left with significant neurological disabilities for years after the initial symptoms appear. However, more than 85% of patients have seen minimal symptoms present at six months from the time of the original stroke, and have been able to independently accomplish average daily activities within a year.

==Epidemiology==
Lateral medullary syndrome is the most common form of posterior ischemic stroke syndrome. It is estimated that there are around 600,000 new cases of this syndrome in the United States alone. Those at the overall highest risk for lateral medullary syndrome are men at an average age of 55.06. Having a history of hypertension, diabetes and smoking all increase the risk of large artery atherosclerosis. Large artery atherosclerosis is thought to be the greatest risk factor for lateral medullary syndrome due to the deposits of cholesterol, fatty substances, cellular waste products, calcium and fibrin. Otherwise known as plaque build up in the arteries.

==History==
The earliest description of lateral medullary syndrome was first written by Gaspard Vieusseux at the Medical and Chirurgical Society of London describing the symptoms observed at the time. Adolf Wallenberg further reinforced these signs after completing his first case report in 1895. He was able to make an accurate localization of the lesion and soon after proved it following a postmortem examination. Wallenberg accomplished three more published articles about lateral medullary syndrome.

=== Adolf Wallenberg ===

Adolf Wallenberg was a renowned neurologist and neuroanatomist most widely known for his clinical descriptions of Lateral Medullary Syndrome. He completed his doctorate at Leipzig University in 1886. By 1928 he had spent 2 years (1886-1888) as an assistant at the city hospital in Danzig, 21 years (1907-1928) as the director of internal and psychiatric departments and 18 years (1910-1928) as a titular professor. In 1929, Wallenberg received the Erb Commemorative Medal for his work in the field of anatomy, physiology and pathology of the nervous system.

Wallenberg&#x27;s first patient in 1885 was a 38-year-old male with symptoms of vertigo, numbness, loss of pain and temperature sensitivity, paralysis of multiple locations, ataxia and more. His background in neuroanatomy helped him in correctly locating the patient&#x27;s lesion to the lateral medulla and connected it to a blockage of the ipsilateral posterior inferior cerebral artery. After the death of his patient in 1899, he was able to prove his findings after a postmortem examination. He continued his work with many patients and by 1922 he had reported his 15th patient with clinicopathological correlations. In 1938, Adolf Wallenberg was forced to end his career as a physician by the German occupation. When the Nazis came to power, he was stripped of his research laboratory and forced to stop working because he was Jewish. He emigrated to Great Britain in 1938, then relocated to the United States in 1943.

<doc id="685810" wikidata="Q796231" url="?curid=685810" title="Boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion">
<text>A boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE, ) is an explosion caused by the rupture of a vessel containing a pressurized liquid that is or has reached a temperature sufficiently higher than its boiling point at atmospheric pressure. Because the boiling point of a liquid rises with pressure, the contents of the pressurized vessel can remain a liquid as long as the vessel is intact. If the vessel&#x27;s integrity is compromised, the loss of pressure drops the boiling point, which can cause the liquid to convert to gas expanding rapidly. BLEVEs are manifestations of explosive boiling.

If the gas is flammable, as is the case with e.g., hydrocarbons and alcohols, further damage can be caused by the ensuing fire. However, BLEVEs do not necessarily involve fire.

==Name==
On 24 April 1957, a process reactor at a Factory Mutual (FM) facility underwent a powerful explosion as a consequence of a rapid depressurization. It contained formalin mixed with phenol. The burst damaged the plant. However, no fire developed, as the mixture was not flammable. In the wake of the accident, researchers James B. Smith, William S. Marsh, and Wilbur L. Walls, who were employed with FM, came up with the terms &quot;boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion&quot; and its acronym &quot;BLEVE&quot;. The expressions did not become of common use until the early 1970s, when the National Fire Protection Association&#x27;s (NFPA) &quot;Fire Command&quot; and &quot;Fire Journal&quot; magazines started publishing articles using them.

==Mechanism==
There are three key elements in the formation of a BLEVE:

# A material in liquid form at a temperature sufficiently above its normal atmospheric pressure boiling point.
# A containment vessel maintaining the pressure that keeps the substance in liquid form.
# A sudden loss of containment that rapidly drops the pressure.

Typically, a BLEVE starts with a vessel containing liquid held above its atmospheric-pressure boiling temperature. Many substances normally stored as liquids, such as carbon dioxide, propane, and other industrial gases have boiling temperatures below room temperature when at atmospheric pressure. In the case of water, a BLEVE could occur if a pressure vessel is heated beyond . That container, because the boiling water pressurizes it, must be capable of holding liquid water at very high temperatures.If the pressurized vessel ruptures, the pressure which prevents the liquid from boiling is lost. If the rupture is catastrophic, i.e., the vessel becomes suddenly no longer capable of holding any pressure, then the liquid will find itself at a temperature far above its boiling point. This causes a portion of the liquid to instantaneously vaporize with extremely rapid expansion. Depending on temperatures, pressures and the material involved, the expansion may be so rapid that it can be classified as an explosion, fully capable of inflicting severe damage on its surroundings.

For example, a tank of pressurized liquid water held at might be pressurized to above atmospheric (or gauge) pressure. If the tank containing the water were to rupture, there would for a brief moment exist a volume of liquid water which would be at:
* Atmospheric pressure
* Temperature of . 
At atmospheric pressure the boiling point of water is . Liquid water at atmospheric pressure does not exist at temperatures higher than . At that moment, the water would boil and turn to vapor explosively, and the liquid water turned to gas would take up significantly more volume (≈ 1,600-fold) than it did as liquid, causing a vapor explosion. Such explosions can happen when the superheated water of a boiler escapes through a crack in a boiler, causing a boiler explosion.

The vaporization of liquid resulting in a BLEVE typically occurs within 1 millisecond after a catastrophic loss of containment.

=== Superheat limit theory ===

For a BLEVE to occur, the boiling liquid must be sufficiently superheated upon loss of containment. For example, at a pressure of approximately , water boils at . Superheated water released from a closed container at these conditions will not generate a BLEVE, as homogeneous nucleation of vapor bubbles is not possible. There is no consensus about the minimal temperature above which a BLEVE will occur. A formula proposed by Robert Reid to predict it is:

formula_1

where &quot;T&quot;C is the critical temperature of the fluid (expressed in kelvin). The minimum BLEVE temperatures of some fluids, based on this formula, are as follows:
According to Reid, BLEVE will occur, more in general, if the expansion crosses a &quot;superheat-limit locus&quot;. In Reid&#x27;s model, this curve is essentially the fluid&#x27;s spinodal curve as represented in a pressure–temperature diagram, and the BLEVE onset is a manifestation of explosive boiling, where the spinodal is crossed &quot;from above&quot;, i.e., via sudden depressurization. However, direct correspondence between the superheat limit and the spinodal has not been proven experimentally. In practical BLEVEs, the way the pressure vessel fails may influence decisively the way the expansion takes place, for example causing pressure waves and non-uniformities. Additionally, there may be stratification in the liquid, due to local temperature variations. Because of this, it is possible for BLEVEs to occur at temperatures less than those predicted with Reid&#x27;s formula.

=== Physical BLEVEs ===
The term BLEVE is often associated to explosive fires from pressure vessels containing a flammable liquid. However, a BLEVE can occur even with a non-flammable substance such as water, liquid nitrogen, liquid helium or other refrigerants or cryogenics. Such materials can go through purely physical BLEVEs, not entailing flames or other chemical reactions. In the case of unignited BLEVEs of liquefied gases, rapid cooling due to the absorption of the enthalpy of vaporization is a hazard that can cause frostbite. Asphyxiation from the expanding vapors is also possible, if the vapor cloud is not rapidly dispersed, as can be the case inside a building, or in a trough in the case of heavier-than-air gasses. The vapors can also be toxic, in which case harm and possibly death can occur at relatively low concentrations and, therefore, even far from the source.

=== BLEVE–fireball ===
If a flammable substance, however, is subject to a BLEVE, it can ignite upon release, either due to friction, mechanical spark or other point sources, or from a pre-existing fire that had engulfed the pressure vessel and caused it to fail in the first place. In such a case, the burning vapors will further expand, adding to the force of the explosion. Furthermore, a very significant amount of the escaped fluid will burn in a matter of seconds in a raising fireball, which will generate extremely high levels of thermal radiation. While the blast effects can be devastating, a flammable substance BLEVE typically causes more damage due to the fireball thermal radiation than the blast overpressure.

==Effect of impinging fires==
BLEVEs are often caused by an external fire near the storage vessel causing heating of the contents and pressure build-up. While tanks are often designed to withstand great pressure, constant heating can cause the metal to weaken and eventually fail. If the tank is being heated in an area where there is no liquid (such as near its top), it may rupture faster because the boiling liquid does not afford cooling in that area. Pressure vessels are usually equipped with relief valves that vent off excess pressure, but the tank can still fail if the pressure is not released quickly enough. A pressure vessel is designed to withstand the set pressure of its relief valves, but only if its mechanical integrity is not weakened as it can be in the case of an impinging fire. In an impinging fire scenario, flammable vapors released in the BLEVE will ignite upon release, forming a fireball. The origin of the impinging fire may be from a release of flammable fluid from the vessel itself, or from an external source, including releases from nearby tanks and equipment. For example, rail tank cars have BLEVEd under the effect of a jet fire from the open relief valve of another derailed tank car.

== Hazards ==
The main damaging effects of a BLEVE are three: the blast wave from the explosion; the projection of fragments, or missiles, from the pressure vessel; and the thermal radiation from the fireball, where one occurs.

Horizontal cylindrical (&quot;bullet&quot;) tanks tend to rupture longitudinally. This causes the failed tank and its fragments to get propelled like rockets and travel long distances. At Feyzin, three of the propelled fragments weighed in excess of 100 tons and were thrown 150–350 meters (490–1150 ft) from the source of the explosion. One bullet tank at San Juanico travelled in the air before landing, possibly the farthest ever for a BLEVE missile. Fragments can impact on other tanks or equipment, which may result in a domino effect propagation of the accidental sequence.

Fireballs can rise to significant heights above ground. They are spheroidal when developed and rise from the ground in a mushroom shape. The diameter of fireballs at San Juanico was estimated at 200–300 meters (660–980 ft), with a duration of around 20 seconds. Such massive fires can injure people at distances of hundreds of meters (e.g., 300 m (980 ft) at Feyzin and 400 m (1310 ft) at San Juanico).

An additional hazard from BLEVE-fireball events is the formation of secondary fires, by direct exposure to the fireball thermal radiation, as pool fires from fuel that does not get combusted in the fireball, or from the scattering of blazing tank fragments. Another secondary effect of importance is the dispersion of a toxic gas cloud, if the vapors involved are toxic and do not catch fire upon release. Chlorine, ammonia and phosgene are example of toxic gases that underwent BLEVE in past accidents and produced toxic clouds as a consequence.

<doc id="685817" wikidata="Q3127259" url="?curid=685817" title="Haraldr Óláfsson">
<text>Haraldr Óláfsson (born 1223 or 1224; died 1248) was a thirteenth-century King of Mann and the Isles, and a member of the Crovan dynasty. He was one of several sons of Óláfr Guðrøðarson, King of the Isles, although the identity of his mother is uncertain. When his father died in 1237, Haraldr succeeded to the kingship as a fourteen-year-old, and held the kingship for about a decade afterwards.

Early in his reign, Haraldr was forced to contend with an apparent coup perpetrated by a kinsman and perhaps an otherwise unknown younger brother. Following this, Haraldr was then ejected from Mann by envoys of his father&#x27;s overlord, Hákon Hákonarson, King of Norway, who probably took action against Haraldr because the former had refused to render him homage. Unable to overcome Hákon&#x27;s supporters in the Isles, Haraldr eventually submitted to Hákon in Norway, and remained there for about two or three years before being restored in the Isles.

Unlike his immediate royal predecessors, who appear to have favoured the title &quot;rex insularum&quot;, Haraldr appears to have preferred &quot;rex mannie et insularum&quot;. Three charters from Haraldr&#x27;s reign are known, two of which are recorded to have borne a waxen seal, depicting a galley on one side and a lion on the other. Haraldr reigned during a period of competing claims to overlordship of the Isles by the English, Norwegian, and Scottish Crowns. Like his father before him, and a younger brother after him, Haraldr was knighted by Henry III, King of England. The act itself brought Haraldr closer within the orbit of the English Crown. Late in 1247, however, Haraldr returned to Norway and married Hákon&#x27;s daughter, Cecilía, and thereby bound himself closer to the Norwegian Crown. Whilst attempting to return to the Isles in the autumn of 1248, the newly-wed&#x27;s ship was lost at sea south of Shetland in a tidal race known as Sumburgh Roost. News of Haraldr&#x27;s demise appears to have reached Mann by the spring of 1249, whereupon his younger brother, Rǫgnvaldr, succeeded to the kingship.

Haraldr was evidently a popular and capable king who appears to have garnered much of his support from the Hebridean portion of his realm. His untimely death, however, led to the continuation of the vicious kin-strife which had wracked the Crovan dynasty during his father&#x27;s floruit. The chaos brought about by Haraldr&#x27;s demise appears to have contributed to the invasion of Argyll, and near conquest of the Hebrides, by Alexander II, King of Scotland.

==Background==

Haraldr was a son of Óláfr Guðrøðarson, King of the Isles, and a member of the Crovan dynasty. The identity of Haraldr&#x27;s mother is less certain. Óláfr is known to have had two wives. His first marriage was to &quot;&quot;, a woman who was likely a member of Clann Somhairle, possibly a daughter of either Ruaidhrí mac Raghnaill or Domhnall mac Raghnaill, or else a daughter of their father, Raghnall mac Somhairle. Óláfr&#x27;s second wife was Cairistíona, daughter of Fearchar mac an tSagairt. Although no contemporaneous source names Haraldr&#x27;s mother, the thirteenth- to fourteenth-century &quot;Chronicle of Mann&quot; states that Óláfr died in 1237, and specifies that Haraldr was fourteen-years-old at the time. This would place his birth in about 1222 or 1223, at about the time that Óláfr married his second wife, indicating that either woman could have been Haraldr&#x27;s mother.

Haraldr reigned during an apparent lull in an ongoing and vicious struggle over the kingship fought between two rival branches of the Crovan dynasty. This kin-strife had its origins in the late twelfth century, on the death of Haraldr&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Guðrøðr Óláfsson, King of Dublin and the Isles, after which the king was succeeded by Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson. Although the latter was Guðrøðr Óláfsson&#x27;s eldest son, and had the support of the Islesmen, Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson&#x27;s mother was an uncanonical wife or concubine. Haraldr&#x27;s father, on the other hand, was the product of canonically recognised marriage, and may well have been Guðrøðr Óláfsson&#x27;s chosen successor. After a period of imprisonment, Rǫgnvaldr had Óláfr marry Lauon, the sister of his own wife. Óláfr, however, managed to have the union nullified, and married Cairistíona. Tensions between the half-brothers turned to outright warfare in the 1220s, in which Rǫgnvaldr&#x27;s son, Guðrøðr Dond, was captured and mutilated by Óláfr. Rǫgnvaldr was slain battling Óláfr in 1229, after which the latter gained complete control of the kingdom. In the 1230s, during a period of heightened tensions between the Norwegian and Scottish realms, Óláfr and Guðrøðr Dond temporarily shared control of the Crovan dynasty&#x27;s partitioned realm. When the latter was killed in 1231, Óláfr assumed control of the entire kingdom, and ruled it peacefully until his own death.





Haraldr also ruled during a period of competing claims to the overlordship of the Isles, a region comprising the Hebrides and Mann, known in the Norse world as &quot;&quot; (the &quot;Southern Islands&quot;) due to its geographical position in relation to Norway itself. Since the reign of Magnús berfœttr, King of Norway, a king who conquered Orkney, the Isles, and possibly Dublin before his death in 1103, the Norwegian Crown appears to have claimed ultimate authority in the Isles. In fact, on several occasions during the reigns of Haraldr&#x27;s royal predecessors, leading Islesmen sought recognition and protection from Norwegian monarchs. The ruler of Norway during Haraldr&#x27;s floruit was Hákon Hákonarson, King of Norway, a formidable ruler who spent the latter part of his reign focused on foreign policy and strengthening royal authority throughout far-flung Norse colonies such as the Isles. At the same time the Scottish Crown, in the person of Alexander II, King of Scotland, consolidated control over Scotland&#x27;s western seaboard, and moved to extend Scottish influence further into the Isles. Meanwhile, Henry III, King of England also had an interest in the Isles, and worked to bring the Crovan dynasty closer under the orbit of the English Crown.

==Accession and overlordship==

After his father&#x27;s death, Haraldr succeeded to the kingship. Unlike the reign of his father, who temporarily ruled a partitioned kingdom, and endured years of near catastrophic kin-strife, Haraldr appears to have ruled a whole kingdom, and his kingship does not seem to have suffered from serious dynastic discord. Haraldr&#x27;s young age at the time of his accession, and the fact that he had a potential rival in the person of Haraldr Guðrøðarson, suggests that Haraldr had been designated successor during his father&#x27;s lifetime. Not long after his accession, the &quot;Chronicle of Mann&quot; records that he sailed into the Hebridean portion of the kingdom, and left a kinsman named Lochlann as governor on Mann. Lochlann&#x27;s tenure on the island led to factional strife, and when Haraldr made his return the following spring, the chronicle states that Lochlann fled the island for Wales, taking with him his foster-son, Guðrøðr Óláfsson. There, somewhere along the northern Welsh coast, the chronicle claims that their ship was lost, with Lochlann and his foster-son amongst the dead. Quite why Lochlann was compelled to flee his sovereign is uncertain. The chronicle states that a friend of Haraldr had been slain in the uprising quelled by Lochlann, possibly indicate that the latter fled in fear of the king. Another possibility, is that Lochlann led a coalition opposed to Haraldr. Quite why Lochlann chose to Wales as his destination is also unknown, although the Crovan dynasty certainly had diplomatic and familial connections with the Welsh. In fact, a transaction between Llywelyn ap Gruffudd and Ralph de Mortimer that concerns the lands of Maelienydd and Gwerthrynion, and appears to date to 1241, makes note of a witness named &quot;&quot;. The precise identity of this man is uncertain. One possibility is that he is identical to Lochlann&#x27;s foster-son. If the chronicle is in error in its account of the maritime demise of Guðrøðr Óláfsson, and he is indeed identical to the like-named Manx prince on record in Wales, his activities outside the kingdom of his forefathers may have been a consequence of the troubles following the Haraldr&#x27;s accession. The chronicle&#x27;s account of the flight to Wales may, therefore, reveal that Lochlann tried and failed to replace Haraldr with an otherwise unknown younger son of Óláfr. If so, the episode would appear to be yet another example of the Crovan dynasty enduring internal strife.

Later in 1238, the chronicle reveals that envoys of Hákon expelled Haraldr from Mann because the latter had refused to render homage to his overlord in Norway. Hákon&#x27;s delegates in the Isles—a certain Gospatric, and Giolla Críost mac Muircheartaigh—are described by the chronicle to have seized control of the island, and taken tribute which was due to the Norwegian king. By sending such emissaries—men apparently without any hereditary claim to the kingdom—Hákon ignored other potential claimants, such as other members of the Crovan dynasty and members of Clann Somhairle. About a decade before, when Haraldr&#x27;s father first gained complete control of the kingdom, Óláfr journeyed to Norway and may have rendered homage to Hákon. Later in 1235 Óláfr rendered homage to Henry, before being called back to Norway the following year. The episode concerning the ejection of Haraldr may well be related to his father&#x27;s fealty to the English Crown, and appears to indicate that the latter was deposed for not fulfilling his duties as a Norwegian vassal; and that upon his subsequent removal, Haraldr&#x27;s rights of vassalage passed to Hákon himself.

Although Haraldr attempted to oust Hákon&#x27;s representatives on several occasions, his successive invasions of Mann from the Hebrides ultimately proved unsuccessful, and the chronicle indicates that he finally journeyed to Norway to render his submission. After a stay of about two or three years in Scandinavia, the chronicle reports that Haraldr became reconciled with Hákon, who restored him to the kingship. The source reveals that the boundaries of his kingdom were carefully defined by Hákon as the islands which had been previously ruled by Haraldr&#x27;s father, his uncle (Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson), and his paternal grandfather. The Norwegian king, therefore, not only deliberately excluded the island territories ruled by Clann Somhairle, but limited the possibility of Haraldr becoming in drawn into alignment with Scottish interests like some leading members of Clann Somhairle had been. Upon his return to the Isles, the chronicle states that the Manxmen rejoiced at his arrival; and declares that he afterwards reigned quietly and peacefully, enjoying an alliance of friendship with both the English and Scottish Crowns.

==Acta and honours==

The earliest member of the Crovan dynasty known to have utilised a seal is Haraldr&#x27;s paternal grandfather, who attached such a device to a confirmation charter granted in about 1154. Although none of the original seals borne by the Crovan dynasty have survived, several were documented by sixteenth- and seventeenth-century antiquarians. In regards to Haraldr himself, one such antiquarian named Christopher Hatton not only transcribed two of Haraldr&#x27;s charters, but made drawings of the seals which were attached to them. The devices themselves were in poor condition by Hatton&#x27;s time, as his illustrations show portions of them broken away. It is clear, however, that the seals bore a lion on one side, and a clinker-built galley with sails furled on the other side. About a century later, the charters and seals, along with other priceless documents of the Cottonian Library, were destroyed by fire at Ashburnham House in 1731. Waxen seals affixed to acta not only served to authenticate the written documents, but also physically symbolise the authority and significance of them. For example, when Hákon formally confirmed the kingship of Magnús Óláfsson, King of Mann and the Isles, Haraldr&#x27;s younger brother and eventual royal successor, the Norwegian king is said by the &quot;Chronicle of Mann&quot; to have done so &quot;by the protection of his seal&quot;. To the kings of the Crovan dynasty, whose military strength laid in the power of armed galley-fleets, the symbol of such a vessel upon their seals represented the strength and authority they held in the Isles.

One of Haraldr&#x27;s charters to which a seal was attached was a grant to the monks of Furness Abbey concerning mining rights on Mann, the use of a depot at &quot;&#x27;&quot; (probably Ronaldsway), and the freedom from tolls and customs. The record of this document is the earliest evidence for mineral exploitation on the island, an industry that expanded throughout the island by the century&#x27;s end. In another charter, Haraldr pledged the protection of the abbey&#x27;s ships and goods. His amiable interactions with the English abbey contrasted the apparent aggression of his father, who was warned by the English king not to harm the monks or their property. In a further charter, evidenced from a sixteenth-century copy, Haraldr confirmed his father&#x27;s earlier grant of the lands of &quot;&#x27;&quot; (probably Ballaharry), and the churches of St Ninian of &quot;&quot; and St Runius (all located in the Manx parish of Marown), to Whithorn Priory in Galloway. Of the twenty royal charters known to have been issued by the Crovan dynasty, only three can be assigned to Haraldr&#x27;s reign.

Like his father before him, and his brother Magnús after him, Haraldr was knighted by Henry. The chronicle claims that the event took place in 1247, and elaborates that Haraldr returned home with &quot;much honour, and great gifts&quot;. Contemporary English administrative records, however, reveal that the deed took place early in 1246. Specifically, a letter of safe-conduct, issued by the English king on 9 January 1246, orders that Haraldr was to be given safe-passage through England until Pentecost (27 May 1246). Similarly, the thirteenth-century &quot;Chronica majora&quot; reports that Henry confirmed the honour of knighthood upon Haraldr on Easter day that year. Numerous titles were accorded to the kings of the Crovan dynasty. The style apparently preferred by Haraldr&#x27;s father was &#x27;. As for Haraldr and Magnús, they appear to have favoured the variant form &#x27;. According to the seventeenth-century antiquarians William Camden and John Selden, this title appeared on the legend of seals borne by the dynasty. It is unknown whose emblems these men were referring to, although they may well have been those of Haraldr. These titles are an equivalent of the Gaelic title &#x27; (&quot;king of the islands of the foreigners&quot;) first recorded in 989, a style almost certainly referring to Mann and the Hebrides. Other sources accord Haraldr similar titles. The Icelandic annals, for example, style him &quot;&#x27;&quot; (&quot;king of the Hebrides&quot;).

==Dynastic alliance==

In the autumn of 1247, Haraldr again voyaged to Norway, as evidenced by the &quot;Chronicle of Mann&quot; and the thirteenth-century &quot;Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar&quot;. After Haraldr removed from Oslo to Bergen, these sources reveal that Hákon gave the hand of his widowed daughter, Cecilía, in marriage to Haraldr. Throughout his long reign, Hákon endeavoured to strengthen his far-flung Norwegian realm. In regard to the Isles, his bestowal of Cecilía in matrimony to Haraldr brought relations between the rulers of the realms to its climax. The compilers of the chronicle clearly considered the union to have elevated Haraldr&#x27;s prestige above that of his predecessors, as this source claims that Hákon had declared he would hold his new son-in-law &quot;in great glory and exalt the throne of his kingdom above all who ruled before him in the Isles&quot;.

Whilst Haraldr was still in Norway, the saga states that two leading members of Clann Somhairle arrived at Hákon&#x27;s court, with each seeking the kingship of the Isles: Eóghan Mac Dubhghaill, Lord of Argyll and Dubhghall mac Ruaidhrí. Although 1247 was also the year of Hákon&#x27;s royal coronation, and it is possible that the arrival of the Clann Somhairle dynasts was a result of the reimposition of Norwegian overlordship (as appears to have been the case with Haraldr), there may have been other reasons for the arrival of Eóghan and Dubhghall. For example, 1247 was also the year that a prominent member of Clann Somhairle, called &quot;Mac Somhairle&quot; in Irish sources, was slain in Ireland battling the English. The knighting of Haraldr the year previous may well have entailed some act of submission to the Henry, and it is possible that Hákon had consequently recognised Mac Somhairle&#x27;s kingship in the Isles in response to Haraldr&#x27;s acceptance of English overtures. An alliance with a ruler of the Isles would have certainly benefited Henry&#x27;s ongoing military operations in Ireland, and it is possible that it was such a pact that had prompted Mac Somhairle&#x27;s involvement against the English. Haraldr&#x27;s subsequent marriage to Cecilía, therefore, may have been a successful attempt by Hákon to lure Haraldr back to his side.

==Death and after-effects==

In 1248, the &quot;Chronicle of Mann&quot;, &quot;Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar&quot;, and the Icelandic annals indicate that Haraldr and Cecilía drowned whilst voyaging from Norway to the Isles. Whilst the former source laments that Harald&#x27;s death &quot;a cause of grief to all who had known him&quot;, the latter states that his death was the &quot;greatest harm and ill-luck&quot; to the Islsemen who &quot;lost so suddenly such a prince, when his voyage to Norway had been so lucky&quot;. Since the wreckage of their vessel washed ashore from the south, the saga specifically states that the ship was thought to have been lost south of Shetland in &quot;&quot;, a treacherous tidal race otherwise known in more modern times as Sumburgh Roost and Da Roost, lying between Sumburgh Head and Fair Isle (). Amongst those drowned was Laurence, Archdeacon of Mann, a man who had recently been elected Bishop of the Isles by the chapter of Mann. Although Laurence had presented himself in Norway to Haraldr and Sigurðr tapsi Indriðason, Archbishop of Niðaróss, the chronicle reveals that Haraldr had postponed his consecration until the former could be publicly elected in the Isles before king, clergy, and people.

Haraldr&#x27;s death led to what was the final stage of inter-dynastic strife amongst his family. News of Haraldr and Cecilía&#x27;s death does not appear to have reached Mann until the spring of 1249. According to the chronicle, Haraldr&#x27;s younger brother, Rǫgnvaldr, succeeded to the kingship on 6 May 1249, only to be slain on 30 May by a man who appears to have been an accomplice of Rǫgnvaldr and Haraldr&#x27;s cousin, Haraldr Guðrøðarson. With Rǫgnvaldr out of the way, Haraldr Guðrøðarson successfully seized the throne, and replaced Haraldr&#x27;s former supporters with proponents of his own. According to the chronicle, one of the men who suffered under Haraldr Guðrøðarson&#x27;s regime was a certain chieftain called &quot;&quot;. This man is stated to have been held in high esteem by Haraldr, but held a prisoner by Haraldr Guðrøðarson. Although the identity of this man is uncertain, he could be identical to Domhnall, the eponym of Clann Domhnaill. If such an identification is correct, and if Haraldr&#x27;s mother was indeed Lauon of Clann Somhairle, the captive Dofnaldus would have been a close kinsman of Haraldr (perhaps a maternal uncle or maternal grandfather). In fact, Haraldr seems to have relied upon Hebridean support as opposed to Manx support during his reign. For example, the chronicle makes note of three sons of a certain Niall who supported Haraldr&#x27;s cause early in his reign. It is possible that these men were related to a certain Domhnall mac Néill, an obscure figure who faced the brunt of a Scottish royal army in 1221. The latter&#x27;s patronym suggests that he may have had Hebridean or Ulster connections.

The maritime disaster in which Haraldr and Cecilía lost their lives demonstrates some of the difficulties faced by the Norwegian Crown in maintaining control of the far-flung Norse colonies west over sea. Not only did the calamity deprive the Islesmen of a capable king, but cost the Norwegian Crown a closely connected advocate in the region. Upon learning of the catastrophe, Hákon quickly sent Eóghan west over sea to temporarily take up the kingship of the Isles on his behalf. Eóghan, however, was not only a Norwegian dependant in the Isles, but an immanent Scottish magnate on the mainland. For several years the Scottish Crown appears to have attempted to acquire the Hebrides from Norwegian overlordsip, and expand its authority in Argyll. The apparent cooling of relations between Eóghan and Alexander, along with Haraldr&#x27;s later demise, the resulting kin-strife concerning his succession, and Eóghan&#x27;s subsequent acceptance of royal powers on Hákon&#x27;s behalf, could all have contributed to the massed invasion into Argyll by Scottish royal forces within the year. After Alexander demanded Eóghan renounce his allegiance to Hákon, and ordered him to hand over certain mainland and island fortresses, Eóghan apparently withdrew into the northern Hebrides. The unfolding crisis only ended with the Scottish king&#x27;s untimely death soon afterwards in July. According to &quot;Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar&quot;, Alexander had made it clear that he had no intention of turning back until he had acquired control of the western Norwegian dominions within his sights. Within about two decades, such desires would be fully realised by his successor-son, with the final eclipse of Norwegian overlordship in the Isles and the extinction of the Crovan dynasty itself.

<doc id="685826" wikidata="Q1002453" url="?curid=685826" title="Westhill, Aberdeenshire">
<text>Westhill is a suburban town in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, located west of the city of Aberdeen. As of 2022, it has a population of 11,750, making it one of the largest towns in Aberdeenshire.

The town is a blend of villages and farms that were gradually incorporated during its expansion in the latter half of the 20th century, most notably Elrick. It has a Swimming Pool, Shopping Centre, Library, Golf Club and Nature Reserve.

== Origin ==
The creation of Westhill just outside Aberdeen was the idea of local solicitor Ronald Fraser Dean in 1963. With the backing of the former Aberdeen District Council (see Aberdeen City Council), the Secretary of State for Scotland and supported financially by Ashdale Land and Property Company Ltd., the new settlement of Westhill was created upon the old farming land. Since the construction of the first houses in 1968, Westhill has undergone a gradual expansion, much of which is tied to the North East&#x27;s oil and gas economy. In 2007/8 a major expansion of the industrial estate brought several thousand workers to the area. Most of these are in specialist sub-sea engineering oil service companies, making Westhill a world centre in sub-sea engineering.

The name Westhill was created in 1859 when John Anderson from Strichen bought the adjoining small estates of Wester Kinmundy and Blackhills. Both of these names were very old, dating back to at least the 16th Century, but Anderson seems not to have liked them. He therefore created the name Westhill from the other two names. This is recorded in the Register of Sasines 2 December 1859.

== Growth of the town ==

Major housing expansions are under way at Elrick and to the west of Westhill. Many new housing estates are being built, primarily from well known companies such as Stewart Milne and Bett Homes.

The town of Westhill covers the area that was the Western Kinmundy and Blackhills Farming areas.

Westhill Business Park is also growing, with an increasing number of companies creating offices in the park. Due to the demand for offices, many planning permission applications for using the unused land to the South-West have been submitted. The growth has been such that the Postal Area formerly known as Skene has been renamed Westhill, so that for postal purposes, the once two-horse-hamlet of Westhill now covers many square miles.

During the 1980s the local authority boundaries were to be moved such that Westhill would fall within the City of Aberdeen. This was seen as a cost-cutting venture, however the community set up a &quot;Don&#x27;t Move Westhill&quot; campaign, and successfully stopped the town&#x27;s absorption into Aberdeen. No new attempt to move the boundaries to include Westhill have been made since.

==Education==

Westhill has three primary schools:

*Crombie Primary, 
*Elrick Primary, 
*Westhill Primary.
*Skene School (Not in Westhill but feeds into Westhill Academy)

Westhill has a secondary school, Westhill Academy. The academy services Westhill, Skene and pupils in the surrounding area. It was opened in 1979, and since then many improvements and extensions have been made to increase the capacity of the academy.

All the schools in Westhill are run by Aberdeenshire Council.

===Demographics===
The population in 2006 was 10,392. As of 2022, the population has grown to 11,750 people, 58.1% being aged from 18 to 64.

== Notable People==
 Olympic canoeist Tim Baillie has a gold postbox on the concourse of Westhill Shopping Centre, commemorating his gold medal in the canoe slalom C-2 event at the 2012 Olympics. For a time, there were two gold postboxes on Westhill Drive. The first was painted to honour Baillie’s achievement, but locals complained that its location was not central enough. As a result, another postbox, closer to the Shopping Centre, was also painted gold. However, during the Shopping Centre’s renovation, the more central postbox was relocated inside the concourse, and the original postbox further up Westhill Drive was removed in 2024.

In part of the Grampian Regional Council Brotherfield Nursery, is the home of &quot;The Beechgrove Garden&quot;, a gardening based television programme broadcast since 1978 on BBC Scotland. Episodes have broadcast from the site since 1996.

== Transport ==
===Road===
The A944 runs straight through Westhill, and this connects Westhill with Kingswells and Aberdeen to the east, and as far as Mossat to the west. The B9119 branches off from the A944 just before Westhill and this route continues on towards Echt, eventually connecting to the A93.

The Aberdeen Bypass passes due east of the town, linking it to Aberdeen Airport, the A96 and Aberdeen&#x27;s northern and southern suburbs, among other destinations further afield.

<doc id="685827" wikidata="Q1627000" url="?curid=685827" title="Hong Kong Supplementary Character Set">
<text>The Hong Kong Supplementary Character Set (; commonly abbreviated to HKSCS) is a set of Chinese characters – 4,702 in total in the initial release—used in Cantonese, as well as when writing the names of some places in Hong Kong (whether in written Cantonese or standard written Chinese sentences).

It evolved from the preceding Government Chinese Character Set () or GCCS. GCCS is a set of supplementary Chinese characters coded in the user-defined areas of the Big5 character set. It was originally used within the Hong Kong Government and later used by the public. It later evolved into Hong Kong Supplementary Character Set when the characters in the set were submitted to ISO-10646 for coding.

== History and versions ==

The HKSCS has gone through a few iterations.

=== Big-5 extensions (1995–2009) ===
HKSCS versions up to HKSCS-2008 are encoded in Big5 (Big5-HKSCS, big5hk) and ISO 10646 (Unicode).

==== GCCS ====

Due to the inherent differences between standard written Chinese and written Cantonese, the Government of Hong Kong recognised the need for a standardised set of &quot;proprietary&quot; characters that would allow for the streamlining of electronic communication; at the time, the Big5 Chinese encoding scheme did not contain a vast majority of these characters (some were erroneously cross-listed with similar characters).

The Government Chinese Character Set () or GCCS was thus developed by the government. The character set consists of Chinese characters commonly used in Hong Kong. Some characters are Cantonese-specific, while some are alternative forms of characters. The set is not well-organised and the characters are not closely examined.

==== HKSCS-1999 ====

Subsequently, the HKSCS-1999 (HKSCS 1999 specification) was developed. 106 GCCS characters were removed in HKSCS-1999 as a result of unification, and their Big5 code points are reserved for compatibility.

Retired &quot;not verifiable&quot; GCCS characters are found in UTC Sources (UTC-00877–UTC-00898), where they are sourced from Adobe-CNS1-1, an Adobe-CNS1 supplement implemented to support GCCS.

==== HKSCS-2001 and HKSCS-2004 ====

Following the acceptance of HKSCS-1999, newer revisions were released in 2001 (adding 116 new characters) and in 2004 (adding 123 new characters), totalling 4,941 characters.

Starting from HKSCS-2004, all characters previously using the Private Use Area (PUA) section of Unicode (via Microsoft&#x27;s mapping of the Unicode PUA over the private-use ranges of Big5) are remapped, with many of them reassigned to characters in the Supplementary Ideographic Plane, such as in the CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B or CJK Compatibility Ideographs Supplement Unicode blocks. However, to preserve compatibility with programs that generated PUA code points, the already-allocated code points are reserved, and no new characters will be mapped to the private use area.

==== HKSCS-2008 ====

Since around 2005, many Hong Kong and Macau websites have switched encoding from Big5-HKSCS to Unicode, including HKGolden.

The last edition of HKSCS to encode all of its characters in Big5 was HKSCS-2008.

=== Unicode subsets (2015 onwards) ===

==== HKSCS-2016 ====

By 2015, efforts were underway in Hong Kong to migrate away from Big5-HKSCS and towards a defined subset of Unicode, at the time tentatively termed the &quot;Hong Kong Character Set (HKCS)&quot;. This was planned to be published by the end of 2015 as &quot;HKCS-2015&quot;, and to have four parts differentiated by different Unihan source prefixes:

* Source prefix followed by Big5 hexadecimal: character repertoire of HKSCS-2008 in the narrow sense
* Source prefix followed by Big5 hexadecimal: character repertoire of Big5-ETEN
* Source prefix followed by a four-digit decimal incremental accession number: post-2008 vertical extensions (i.e. newly submitted CJK Unified Ideographs)
* Source prefix followed by hexadecimal Unicode code point: post-2008 horizontal extensions (i.e. the addition of a Hong Kong reference glyph and source reference to an existing CJK Unified Ideograph)

In particular, 22 horizontal extensions were already planned for inclusion as of June 2015. These were all minor variants of existing Big5 characters containing the 昷/𥁕, 兑/兌 and 吿/告 components, for which Hong Kong font conventions were closer to those of mainland China than to those of Taiwan, but for which the preferred versions had been encoded separately from the Big5 versions in the Unified Repertoire and Ordering due to the source separation rule. Of these 22 characters, 14 were considered &quot;core&quot; characters for Hong Kong use.

By November, a total of 78 requested additions to HKSCS had been received by the Hong Kong government, all of which already existed in Unicode. By this point, the planned horizontal extension was being referred to as an &quot;HKSCS&quot; version, rather than as &quot;HKCS&quot;. Ultimately, HKSCS-2016 added a total of 24 characters relative to HKSCS-2008, 22 of which were the source-separated variants of existing Big5 characters. Since all 24 characters already existed in Unicode, all received a source reference prefixed with ; the source prefix was not used.

As such, the characters added in HKSCS-2016 are referenced to Unicode only, and were not added to the Big5 extension.

==== Macao Supplementary Character Set ====

Similarly to Hong Kong&#x27;s situation, there are also characters that are needed by Macau but included in neither Big5 nor HKSCS, hence, the &quot;Macao Supplementary Character Set&quot; was developed, building on HKSCS with additional Unicode-mapped characters. The first batch of 121 MSCS characters were submitted for addition to or horizontal extension in Unicode (as appropriate) in 2009. At the time, the term &quot;Macao Information Systems Character Set&quot; (&quot;MISCS&quot;) was in use for the entire character set, while &quot;MSCS&quot; referred more narrowly to the additional characters only.

The first final version of MSCS, MSCS-2020, was established in 2021, and uses the following Unihan source prefixes. Although the potential scope of these source prefixes collectively comprises a superset of HKSCS-2016, &quot;MSCS&quot; in a strict sense does not cover the Big5 or HKSCS characters (since it is intended to be combined with HKSCS) except those which are used as base characters for ideographic variation sequences.

* Source prefix followed by Big5 hexadecimal: character repertoire of HKSCS-2008 in the narrow sense (same as )
* Source prefix followed by level number and Big5 hexadecimal: character repertoire of Big5-ETEN (same as )
* Source prefix followed by a five-digit decimal incremental accession number: Macau-specific vertical extensions. This prefix had initially been in 2009, but was shortened to for vertical extensions in 2020, while horizontal extensions had their source references replaced with references.
* Source prefix followed by hexadecimal Unicode code point: Macau-specific horizontal extensions
* Source prefix followed by hexadecimal Unicode code point: horizontal extensions from HKSCS-2016 (same as )
* Source prefix followed by hexadecimal Unicode code point and a three-digit decimal number: used for variation sequences registered in the Ideographic Variation Database (IVD)

== Compatibility ==

=== Operating systems ===

In Microsoft Windows 98, NT 4.0, 2000, XP, HKSCS support can be enabled using Microsoft&#x27;s patch. In Microsoft&#x27;s implementation, application using code page 950 automatically uses a hidden code page 951 table for the Big5 encoding of the HKSCS extensions. The table supports all code points in HKSCS-2001, except for the compatibility code points specified by the standard. In addition, the MingLiU font is altered using Microsoft&#x27;s patch. This patch is known to create conflicts in applications such as Microsoft Office, or any application using fonts supporting simplified Chinese characters (e.g.: SimSun). If the target environment contains custom font mapped to the code points affected by Microsoft&#x27;s patch, the custom fonts can undo Microsoft&#x27;s patch. Furthermore, the patch breaks EUDC Editor supplied with the affected versions of Windows. Starting with Windows Vista, HKSCS-2004 characters are only supported as Unicode 4.1 or later; however, HKSCS-2001 and HKSCS-1999 characters are supported as Big5-HKSCS and Unicode, but Big5-HKSCS is available only if set &quot;Language for non-Unicode programs&quot; to &quot;Hong Kong&quot; or &quot;Macau&quot;. All characters are assigned standard, non-PUA codepoints. The characters are displayed with the MingLiU font, and these characters can be entered via the keyboard. The patch that provides Big5 encoding of HKSCS is unsupported in Windows Vista and later. A utility provided by Microsoft is available to convert HKSCS and Unicode PUA-encoded characters to Unicode 4.1 version. In 2010, Microsoft published a HKSCS-2004 patch for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. It replaces Windows XP version of MingLiU, PMingLiU, and MingLiU_HKSCS (if HKSCS-2001 patch was applied) with Windows 7 version of MingLiU, PMingLiU and MingLiU_HKSCS. In addition, MingLiU-ExtB, MingLiU_HKSCS-ExtB and PMingLiU-ExtB fonts will be added onto target system. However, IME is not updated as it was in the case of HKSCS-2001 patch, and the fonts are from pre-release of Windows 7. For earlier versions of the OS, HKSCS support requires the use of Microsoft&#x27;s patch, or the Hong Kong government&#x27;s Digital 21&#x27;s utilities.

IBM assigns CCSID 5471 to the HKSCS-2001 Big5 code page (with CPGID 1374 as CCSID 5470 as the double byte component), CCSID 9567 to the HKSCS-2004 code page (with CPGID 1374 as CCSID 9566 as the double byte component), and CCSID 13663 to the HKSCS-2008 code page (with CPGID 1374 as CCSID 13662 as the double byte component), while CCSID 1375 (with CPGID 1374 as CCSID 1374 as its double byte component) is assigned to a growing HKSCS code page, currently equivalent to CCSID 13663.

HKSCS support was added to glibc in 2000, but it has not been updated since then. HKSCS-2004 support is handled as Unicode 4.1 and later. For freedesktop.org setup, &quot;AR PL ShanHeiSun Uni&quot; font fully supports HKSCS-2004 since 0.1-0.dot.1, with latest revision of HKSCS-2004 supported in version 0.1.20060903-1. Modern desktop distributions (e.g. Ubuntu) include Arphic Technology&#x27;s HKSCS-compliant UKai and UMing fonts out of the box when Traditional Chinese Language support is selected during installation. They can also be installed manually at a later time.

Mac OS X 10.0–10.2 supports HKSCS-1999. 10.3–10.4 supports HKSCS-2001. Some of the letters added to HKSCS-2004 is supported via Unicode PUA in OS X 10.4. Starting with OS X 10.5, all the HKSCS-2004 characters are supported via standard Unicode 4.1 code points.

=== Applications and the Web ===

Mozilla 1.5 and above supports HKSCS, with HKSCS-2004 support added into Gecko 1.8.1 code base. Unlike the above-mentioned patch, Mozilla uses its own code page table. However, the fix for bug 343129 does not support characters mapped to code points above Basic Multilingual Plane.

QT 3.x-based applications (e.g.: KDE) only support characters mapped to code points FFFF or lower. In QT4, characters outside BMP are supported via surrogates. Big5-HKSCS Text Codec supports HKSCS-1999 back in Qt-2.3.x, but it was too late in Qt development schedule to be officially included in the Qt-2.3.x series, so it was officially supported in Qt-3.0.1. HKSCS-2001 support was added in Qt-3.0.5.

GNOME supports HKSCS characters in Unicode ranges, except those mapped to the Basic Multilingual Plane compatibility block. Patches to support characters mapped to above Basic Multilingual Plane was introduced during Pango 1.1.

The WHATWG Encoding Standard (used by HTML5) includes HKSCS in its definition of Big5 (used even with the plain Big5 label). However, only its decoder uses all HKSCS extensions, while its encoder explicitly excludes those with lead bytes below 0xA1 (thus excluding most of the HKSCS extensions but including, for example, those inherited from Big5 ETEN). Newer browsers follow this standard, including Firefox.

<text>Innerspace is a 1987 American science fiction comedy film directed by Joe Dante and produced by Michael Finnell, inspired by the 1966 film &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot;. The film stars Dennis Quaid, Martin Short, Meg Ryan, Robert Picardo, and Kevin McCarthy.

&quot;Innerspace&quot; was released in the United States by Warner Bros. The film received positive reviews from critics, grossed an estimated $95 million worldwide, and won an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, the only film directed by Dante to do so.

==Plot==
In San Francisco, down-on-his-luck U.S. Navy aviator Lt. Tuck Pendleton resigns his commission and volunteers for a secret miniaturization experiment. He is placed in a submersible pod and both are shrunk to microscopic size. They are transferred into a syringe to be injected into a rabbit, but the lab is attacked by a rival organization, led by scientist Dr. Margaret Canker, that plans to seize the experiment and steal the miniaturization technology.

Experiment supervisor Ozzie Wexler, knowing their intentions, escapes with the syringe. A chase ensues with one of Canker&#x27;s henchmen, Mr. Igoe, which ends at a nearby shopping mall with Igoe shooting Ozzie. In a last-ditch effort to stop the experiment from falling into the rivals&#x27; hands, the wounded Ozzie injects Tuck and the pod into an unsuspecting passerby - Jack Putter, a hypochondriac Safeway grocery clerk, who is exploited by his boss and belittled by Wendy, a superficial co-worker on whom he has a crush.

On regaining consciousness, Tuck is unaware of what has happened and believes he has been injected into the rabbit. After attempts to radio the lab are unsuccessful, he navigates the pod to the optic nerve and implants a camera so he is able to see what the &quot;host&quot; sees. Realizing he is inside a human, he makes contact by attaching another device to Jack&#x27;s inner ear, enabling him to talk to Jack. He explains that the pod has only a few hours&#x27; supply of oxygen and needs his help to extract him by going back to the lab.

At the lab, the scientists explain to Tuck and Jack that the other group stole one of two computer chips that are vital to the process. Their mastermind is Victor Scrimshaw. His henchmen include Canker, Igoe, and &quot;the Cowboy&quot;.

Jack contacts Tuck&#x27;s estranged girlfriend, Lydia Maxwell, a reporter who has had dealings with the Cowboy. They learn that he plans to buy the computer chip from Scrimshaw and stake out his hotel. After following him to a local nightclub, Lydia allows him to pick her up as Jack encounters Wendy, who, thinking he has been living a double life, shows an interest in him. Jack follows the Cowboy and Lydia back to the hotel, where he knocks the Cowboy unconscious and Tuck uses the pod&#x27;s equipment to control Jack&#x27;s facial muscles, altering his features so he looks like the Cowboy. Lydia and Jack, posing as the Cowboy, meet with Scrimshaw to steal the chip from him. However, as they are about to take possession of it, Jack&#x27;s nervousness overrides the transformation of his face, exposing the scam. Igoe captures Lydia and him, and takes them to their laboratory. While imprisoned, Jack and Lydia share a kiss, which, unknown to them, transfers Tuck into Lydia&#x27;s body through their saliva. Once taken to the laboratory, the criminals shrink Igoe and inject him into Jack to locate Tuck, kill him, and obtain the other chip that is attached to the pod.

After Igoe has been injected, Jack and Lydia free themselves and order everyone in the laboratory, including Scrimshaw and Canker, into the miniaturization device at gunpoint. Not knowing how to operate it, though, they accidentally and unknowingly shrink everyone to half their original size while trying to retrieve the chip. Tuck, now inside Lydia, finds a growing baby and realizes that she is pregnant with his child. By going to her eardrum and playing their song (Sam Cooke&#x27;s &quot;Cupid&quot;), he is able to alert them what has happened. Jack and Lydia kiss again to transfer him back. They frantically drive back to the lab to enlarge him, not realizing that the shrunken Scrimshaw and Canker have escaped and are hiding in the back seat. While they attempt to subdue Jack and Lydia, Igoe locates Tuck in Jack&#x27;s esophagus and attacks him. Tuck disables Igoe&#x27;s craft and the latter is killed when Tuck drops him into Jack&#x27;s stomach after agitating Jack&#x27;s anxiety to increase his stomach acid.

Back at the lab, with only minutes of supplemental oxygen left in the pod, Jack follows Tuck&#x27;s instructions to eject it from his lungs by making himself sneeze due to his hairspray allergy. Tuck and the pod are successfully enlarged, and he is reunited with Lydia and finally gets to meet Jack in person. At Tuck and Lydia&#x27;s wedding, held at Wayfarers Chapel, Jack is Tuck&#x27;s best man. Tuck is seen wearing the chips from the experiment as cufflinks. When they climb into the limousine, the Cowboy is shown to be the driver, and the shrunken Scrimshaw and Canker are hiding inside a suitcase in the trunk. Now confident and in control of his life, Jack recognizes the Cowboy and tells his doctor that he is cured, tells Wendy she has no chance with him, and informs his manager that he quits; he then jumps into Tuck&#x27;s vintage 1967 Mustang, pursuing the limousine to rescue the newlyweds.

==Cast==

In addition, the film&#x27;s director, Joe Dante, has an uncredited cameo as a Vectorscope employee, while Short&#x27;s &quot;SCTV&quot; cast mates Joe Flaherty and Andrea Martin have cameos as waiting-room patients. Chuck Jones and Rance Howard appear briefly as grocery shoppers in one scene.

==Production==
The film began as an original script by Chip Proser, who called it &quot;basically a rip off of &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot;. My idea was that the big guy was up and moving around and could react to what was going on inside.&quot; The script was optioned by Peter Guber at Warner Bros. in 1984. Guber offered the script to Joe Dante, who turned it down. Guber then had the script rewritten by Jeffrey Boam as a comedy. Boam says, &quot;The idea was kind of ridiculous, which was a person miniaturized and put into someone else&#x27;s body. That&#x27;s all I kept from the original script. They originally thought it might be Michael J. Fox inside Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s body. I actually kept turning it down, and they were persistent and kept coming back to me.&quot;

According to Dante, Boam &quot;approached it ... from the concept of what would happen if we shrank Dean Martin down and injected him inside Jerry Lewis.&quot; Dante says that Steven Spielberg had become involved on the project as an executive producer and he may have been responsible for the comedy. &quot;It was such a goofy idea that there were no limits to it,&quot; said Boam. &quot;I felt I could do anything, and so the script I wrote was very loony and far out there but everybody loved it. Dick Donner, Joe Dante, John Carpenter and even Steven Spielberg wanted to do it. So when Steven wanted to do it, Warners thought I was a God and any amount of money it would take to do the movie they would spend. Steve ultimately decided he only wanted to produce so Joe came along and really latched on to the idea.&quot;

Quaid&#x27;s role was originally envisioned to be played by an older actor, but then they decided to make the character younger. Dante recalled during filming scenes where Quaid and Short&#x27;s characters interacted, &quot;Dennis would be on the set in a booth, so the interaction was really happening. Dennis would hew to the script a little more than Marty. After you got a scene in the can, he&#x27;d beg for more takes, in the voice of Katharine Hepburn, which was hard to resist.&quot;

Dante says Spielberg would &quot;protect you from the studio and sometimes from the other producers. It was a very filmmaker-friendly atmosphere over there [at Amblin]. You got all the best equipment and all the best people and all the toys you wanted to play with. Plus, you had somebody on your side who was also a filmmaker and they knew exactly what you were talking about when you had a problem or you had a question.&quot;

&quot;It&#x27;s a dumb, stupid comedy, which is exactly what people need in the summertime,&quot; said Quaid. &quot;It&#x27;s very idiotic and I love it. We encounter every dumb, stupid cliché in the book. Leave your brain at home and you&#x27;ll have a good time.&quot;

Meg Ryan met Quaid on set and they later married.

==Awards==
*1988 Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, Won (Bill George, Dennis Muren, Harley Jessup and Kenneth F. Smith)
*1988 Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Horror Films: Best Director, Best Science Fiction Film, Best Special Effects, nominated

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film grossed $25.9 million in the United States and Canada, generating $14 million in theatrical rentals. Internationally, it grossed $32.7 million in its first 37 days and was expected to gross $75 million ($30 million in rentals). It eventually returned $28 million in rentals, for a worldwide total rentals of $42 million and a worldwide gross in the region of $95 million against a budget of $27 million.

===Critical response===
The film had a positive reception from critics. 

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 3 stars out of 4, stating &quot;Here is an absurd, unwieldy, overplotted movie that nevertheless is entertaining - and some of the fun comes from the way the plot keeps laying it on&quot;. Proser later said, &quot;I never actually have been able to sit through it all at once. They don&#x27;t pay me to watch this crap. Like H. L. Hughgly, I wear a mask to cash the check.&quot;

Joe Dante later said the film &quot;was a hit on video. It was one of the first big videos, and it was discovered on video, basically. Although audiences liked it in theaters—when I went, they were in stitches—the ad campaign was so terrible for that movie. It was just a giant thumb with a little tiny pod on it. You couldn&#x27;t tell that it was a comedy—you couldn&#x27;t tell anything—and it had a terrible title, because we could never figure out a better one. And the studio botched the selling of it. I mean, they liked the movie, and they tried to reissue it, even, with a different campaign, and it still bombed.&quot;

&quot;It&#x27;s been looked back on as if it was some great success whereas, in fact, it was pretty much a disappointment in its day,&quot; he said. Dante later called the film &quot;probably the movie that I had made up to then that was the closest to my intention. As a result, I was very happy with it. When I look at it today I still think it&#x27;s a tremendous amount of fun.&quot;

<text>In baseball statistics, games pitched (denoted by Games G in tables of only pitching statistics) is the number of games in which a player appears as a pitcher. The statistic is also referred to as appearances, especially to refer to the number of games a relief pitcher has pitched in.

Normally, a pitcher must face at least one batter (or three batters in some relief situations), but exceptions are made in the case of injury. A notable example was Larry Yount, who suffered an injury while throwing warmup pitches after being summoned as a reliever in a Major League Baseball (MLB) game on September 15, 1971. He did not face a batter, but was credited with an appearance because he had been announced as a substitute. Yount never appeared in (or actually played in) any other MLB game.

==Major League Baseball career leaders==
Listed below are all MLB players with at least 1,000 games pitched. The first player to reach the mark was Hoyt Wilhelm, in May 1970. LaTroy Hawkins is the most recent player to reach the mark, having achieved it in September 2014. , no active player has reached the milestone; Kenley Jansen leads active players, with over 770 games pitched.

<text>The Volkswagen Sharan is a seven-seater minivan that was produced by the German Volkswagen Group and built at the AutoEuropa plant in Palmela, Portugal, with a front-wheel-drive version across two generations, from 1995 to 2022. Through badge engineering, the Volkswagen Sharan shares the same platform with the SEAT Alhambra, and the first generation was also in most respects identical to the Ford Galaxy. From 2010 to 2023 the Sharan was in its second generation. It is described in the motor industry as a multi-purpose vehicle (MPV). 

==First generation (&quot;Typ&quot; 7M; 1995)==
The Sharan was the Volkswagen-badged product from a joint venture between Volkswagen and Ford Motor Company to produce vehicles in the increasingly important MPV market, which was filled at the time by Renault&#x27;s Espace and Chrysler&#x27;s Voyager. The resulting Volkswagen Sharan concept (and Ford Galaxy) was shown at the 1994 Paris Auto Show, and production started in May 1995. The name Sharan was said to be derived from the Persian word &#x27;Shahran&#x27; meaning &quot;Carrier of Kings&quot;. However, according to Volkswagen, it is a made-up word, like &#x27;Touran&#x27;.

Development began in top-secret in 1987, known only to the highest level members of the respective companies, with a team consisting of Ford&#x27;s Steve Harper, Paul Coucill, and Volkswagen&#x27;s Peter Knapp. Harper&#x27;s design was chosen at the first review that September. It originally had a very different boxier design, and used a conventional minivan layout with a single sliding-door.

The Volkswagen Group subsequently rebadged the Sharan and sold it as the SEAT Alhambra alongside the Sharan. All variants were produced at the joint venture&#x27;s plant AutoEuropa in Portugal, alongside the closely related Ford Galaxy. The Sharan was on sale from 1995 to 2010, accompanied with facelifts in 2000 and 2004.

As of 2007, the annual production for the Sharan is in the 50,000 unit range; it is sold in Europe, South Africa and some Asia Pacific and Latin American countries. In Mexico, it was available with the 1.8L Turbo 4 cil with five speed Tiptronic automatic gearbox in Comfortline trim only, while in Argentina it is available with the 1.8L Turbo and the 1.9L TDI 115 hp four cylinder engines, in both five speed manual and five speed Tiptronic transmissions in Trendline trim only.

The cooperation between Volkswagen and Ford ended in 2006, with the latter going alone in building the second generation Galaxy.

The Sharan was not sold in the United States and Canada. Originally, this was due to an agreement between Ford and Volkswagen, leaving the market free from competition for Ford&#x27;s Aerostar minivan. Volkswagen later decided not to introduce the Sharan in North America, ceased developing the Microbus concept, and instead introduced a badge-engineered variant of the Chrysler minivans as the Routan. This was launched in 2009, and replaced the Sharan in Mexico which was the only North American country where the Sharan was sold.

Scoring 200 points on the &quot;United Kingdom Reliability Index&quot;, the Sharan is considered very unreliable when compared to the average vehicle score of 100, while a very reliable vehicle scores 60 or below. The average age and repair cost of the tested Sharan was 5,3 years and covered 63,546 miles. It has been noted that, despite enjoying high popularity, the Sharan has consistently performed poorly in UK customer satisfaction surveys, including a last place 138th in a 2003 survey. Although quality problems existed in the original version, the Sharan quickly became the best selling MPV in Germany. It also sold better there than the technically identical SEAT Alhambra and Ford Galaxy despite costing up to 2500 euros more.

The first generation Volkswagen Sharan was on sale for over 15 years having been built almost unchanged during the time. By the time it was replaced in 2010 it was one of the longest running car models in Europe. Despite its age, nearly 24,000 Sharans were still being sold annually as of 2008. In total, Volkswagen sold almost 670,000 units of its Sharan.

===Mark 1/Phase 1 (1995–2000)===

The original Sharan was launched in August 1995, and was available with five engine choices:


The design and technology of the Sharan (including Alhambra and Galaxy) was a mix between both Volkswagen and Ford. The design was a compromise solution, with the front looking similar to a Ford Mondeo Mk1 and the rear like Volkswagen Passat (B4). Each of the three MPV models had its own subtle differences in exterior, and, for the Galaxy, in interior design. The first generation&#x27;s initial design was completed under Greg M Greeson, an American designer employed in Volkswagen&#x27;s Advanced Design Studio in Düsseldorf, West Germany from 1989 to 1990.

Some small visual changes in 1998 included new door wings derived from the Volkswagen Golf Mk4 and some changes in the dashboard.

The Sharan received a Euro NCAP three star safety rating when it was tested in 1999.

*1996 &quot;Auto Express&quot; Awards – Best People Carrier (Joint Winner)
===Mark 1A/Phase 1.5 (2000–2004)===
The Sharan and its stablemates received a major facelift in May 2000. At this time, Volkswagen also extended the wheelbase by , increased the front and rear track, and gave it the &quot;Volkswagen family&quot; look of the time including a brand new dashboard no longer sourced from Ford. Seven seats came as standard.

*2000 &quot;Auto Express&quot; New Car Honours – Best MPV

====Engines====

*Available option - 4motion AWD with 6 speed manual transmission

===Mark 1B/Phase 1.75 (2004–2010)===
A further minor cosmetic facelift was implemented in September 2003 at Frankfurt Motor Show for the model year of 2004. This changed, primarily, the grille, and tail lights (round). Also, more standard equipment was added, including air conditioning and curtain side air bags. In 2006, Ford independently introduced a new Galaxy which was not based on the Sharan and Alhambra designs from the Volkswagen Group.

The new Galaxy was built at a dedicated Ford plant in Limburg, Belgium. The last first generation Ford Galaxy rolled off the AutoEuropa line at the end of 2005, while the first generation Sharan and SEAT Alhambra continued in production, alongside the Volkswagen Eos and the new Scirocco, until August 2010.

A BlueMotion variant was introduced in 2008 and went on sale in Germany in May 2008, with lower (159g/km) CO2 emissions and average fuel consumption of 38 mpg U.S. In the UK only 60 BlueMotions were expected to shift per year, and it was on sale there until February 2011.

====Engines====
===LPG version===
In June 2006, PrinceGas and Volkswagen launched the Sharan with a 2.0 L flexible fuel engine, which could work with either petrol or autogas (liquified petroleum gas), providing an additional range over the regular 2.0L petrol engine. Both fuel tanks, the 70L (18 US gallon) petrol tank and the 60L liquid gas tank combined, give the Sharan enough fuel to cover between refuels at an average fuel consumption of 9.6 L/100 km.

The liquid gas tank is built into the spare wheel well so it does not compromise on passenger and loading space of the Sharan&#x27;s interior, although it does eliminate the spare tyre.
==Second generation (&quot;Typ&quot; 7N; 2010)==
The second generation Sharan, based on the Volkswagen Passat (B7), was launched at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show and a month later, the second generation of its sibling model, the SEAT Alhambra, was officially announced. Sales commenced in September 2010.

Although still built at the AutoEuropa factory in Portugal, the new model inherits only its name from the previous Sharan, compared to which it is longer, wider and lower, with the wheelbase lengthened by .

Weight has been reduced by . The initial engine range comprises 1.4-litre TSI (148 bhp) and 2.0-litre (197 bhp) petrol options, plus two 2.0-litre TDI diesel engines, rated at and . The rear doors now slide open rather than being hinged.

In March 2020, Volkswagen ceased production of the Sharan MPV for the Chinese market in favor of the brand new model, China-only Volkswagen Viloran. The car remained in available in Europe after more than 12 years&#x27; presence.

The VW Sharan was discontinued in the UK in 2021 but continued to be available elsewhere in Europe. However, in October 2022, the VW Sharan finally ended production in Portugal after more than a decade of production of the second generation model. No replacement is planned as the market has shifted away from large MPVs to crossovers and SUVs.

===Facelift===
At the 2015 Geneva Motor Show, a facelifted Sharan was unveiled to the public. It has new electronic systems and engines with reduced fuel consumption. Its 2.0 litre TSi engine (, ) and six speed direct-shift gearbox are the same as in the 2016 Golf GTi.

=== Safety ===
==== Euro NCAP ====
The Sharan in its standard European market configuration received 4 stars from Euro NCAP in 2019.

<text>The Moscow Zoo or Moskovsky Zoopark () is a zoo, the largest in Russia. 

== History ==
The Moscow Zoo was founded in 1864 by professor-biologists, K.F. Rulje, S.A. Usov and A.P. Bogdanov, from the Moscow State University. In 1919, the zoo was nationalized. In 1922, the ownership was transferred to the Government of Moscow and has remained under their control ever since.

The zoo had an area of when it first opened, with 286 animals. In 1926, the zoo was expanded to adjacent lands, increasing the area to . 
In 1933, Vera Chaplina, a naturalist and future writer, created the &quot;green platform&quot;, a special enclosure for young animals where different cubs that their mothers refused to feed were not only raised, but also taught to live peacefully together. This experiment aroused great interest among visitors, and for many years the &quot;green platform&quot; remained one of the Moscow Zoo&#x27;s main attractions.

In 1990, the zoo was renovated. Notable additions include a new main entrance in the shape of a large rock castle, and a footbridge that connected the old (1864) and new (1926) properties of the zoo.

In addition, the zoo was expanded once more. New exhibits were opened including a sea aquarium, an aviary, a creatures of the night exhibit, a sea lion exhibit and a section aimed at children. 

The Moscow zoo has over 7,500 animals representing about 1,000 species and covers an area of about . 

== Moscow Zoo Museum == 
Founded in 2008 in a two-storey building of the 19th century, built in the late XIX - early XX centuries, located on the territory of the zoo. Since 2015, the museum has been open to the public and everyone. In the central and side halls, there is an exposition devoted to the history of the Moscow Zoo and a natural science permanent exposition. The collection of the museum includes more than 10,000 zoo coats of arms from all over the world, hundreds of paintings, sculptures, and drawings by the masters of Russian animalistics, such as Vasily Vatagin, Alexei Komarov, Vadim Trofimov, Andrei Marts and Alexei Tsvetkov.

== Research &amp; Educational Center == 
The Moscow Zoo has its own educational institute and research center. In addition to full training for zoo staff and teachers, there is a continuing education program for zoo and aquarium staff, veterinarians, teachers and volunteers, as well as courses in zoo psychology. Since the Moscow Zoo has been chairman of all zoos in Russia since the Soviet period, it is a national training center. This was founded in 2017 by the current director Svetlana Akulova and Björn Stenvers.

<text>In baseball statistics, ground ball-fly ball ratio (denoted by G/F or GB/FB) is a measure of:
* Frequency of batted ground balls in play versus fly balls in play to denote what kind of contact a batter makes more frequently. Calculated as (total ground balls in play) / (total fly balls in play); and
* Frequency of ground balls allowed in play versus fly balls allowed in play to denote what kind of contact a pitcher surrenders more frequently to opposing batters. Calculated as (total ground balls in play surrendered) / (total fly balls in play surrendered).
The related statistic of &quot;ground outs-fly outs ratio&quot; (denoted by &quot;GO/AO&quot;), is a measure of:
* Frequency of batted ground ball outs versus fly ball outs hit by the batter, calculated as (number of ground ball outs) / (number of fly ball outs).
* Frequency of batted ground ball outs versus fly ball outs thrown by the pitcher, calculated as (number of ground ball outs) / (number of fly ball outs).

A statistic in baseball that compares the number of &quot;ground outs&quot; (ground ball hits that lead to an out for the batter) to &quot;air outs&quot; (fly balls that lead to an out for the batter), which determines the mix of fielded out types for both batters and pitchers. For each ground out (GO) and air out (AO), both the batter put out and the pitcher on the play receive either a GO or AO on their stat line, which is used in the calculation of the ratio.

The St. Louis Cardinals have led Major League Baseball in team ground ball/fly ball ratio since 2006. Sinker, cutter, and curveball pitchers tend to produce more ground balls, while pitchers who rely on fastballs, sliders, and split-fingered fastballs tend to produce more fly balls. Roughly 10% of fly balls are home runs. Fly ball pitchers in large parks however, tend to allow less than 7%.</text><links>

<doc id="685844" wikidata="Q18659042" url="?curid=685844" title="Hits per nine innings">
<text>In baseball statistics, hits per nine innings (denoted by H/9) is the average number of hits allowed by a pitcher in a nine inning period; calculated as: (hits allowed x 9) / innings pitched. This is a measure of a pitcher&#x27;s success based on the number of all outs he records.

Compared to a pitcher&#x27;s batting average against, a pitcher&#x27;s H/9 benefits from sacrifice bunts, double plays, runners caught stealing, and outfield assist, but it is hurt by some errors. Unlike batting average against, a pitcher&#x27;s H/9 benefits from outs that are not related to official at bats, as they are recorded on runners after they have reached base.

, Nolan Ryan is the career leader (6.5553), Sandy Koufax is #2 (6.7916), Clayton Kershaw is #3 (6.8160).

<doc id="685849" wikidata="Q1224892" url="?curid=685849" title="Greylisting (email)">
<text>Greylisting is a method of defending e-mail users against spam. A mail transfer agent (MTA) using greylisting will &quot;temporarily reject&quot; any email from a sender it does not recognize. If the mail is legitimate, the originating server will try again after a delay, and if sufficient time has elapsed, the email will be accepted.

==Mechanism==
A server employing greylisting temporarily rejects email from unknown or suspicious sources by sending 4xx reply codes (&quot;please call back later&quot;), as defined in the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). Fully capable SMTP implementations are expected to maintain queues for retrying message transmissions in such cases, and so while legitimate mail may be delayed, it should still get through.

Temporary rejection can be issued at different stages of the SMTP dialogue, allowing for an implementation to store more or less data about the incoming message. The trade-off is more work and bandwidth for more exact matching of retries with original messages. Rejecting a message after its content has been received allows the server to store a choice of headers and/or a hash of the message body.

In addition to whitelisting good senders, a greylister can provide for &quot;exceptions&quot;. Greylisting can generally be overridden by a fully validated TLS connection with a matching certificate. Because large senders often have a pool of machines that can send (and resend) email, IP addresses that have the most-significant 24 bits (/24) the same are treated as equivalent, or in some cases SPF records are used to determine the sending pool. Similarly, some e-mail systems use unique per-message return-paths, for example variable envelope return path (VERP) for mailing lists, Sender Rewriting Scheme for forwarded e-mail, Bounce Address Tag Validation for backscatter protection, etc. If an exact match on the sender address is required, every e-mail from such systems will be delayed. Some greylisting systems try to avoid this delay by eliminating the variable parts of the VERP by using only the sender domain and the beginning of the local-part of the sender address.

Greylisting is effective against mass email tools used by spammers that do not queue and reattempt mail delivery as a regular mail transport agent normally does. Delaying delivery also gives real-time blackhole lists and similar lists the time to identify and flag the spam source. Thus, these subsequent attempts are more likely to be detected as spam by other mechanisms than they were before the greylisting delay.

==Advantages==
The main advantage from the user&#x27;s point of view is that greylisting requires no additional user configuration. If the server utilizing greylisting is configured appropriately, the end user will only notice a delay on the first message from a given sender, so long as the sending email server is identified as belonging to the same whitelisted group as earlier messages. If mail from the same sender is repeatedly greylisted it may be worth contacting the mail system administrator with detailed headers of delayed mail.

From a mail administrator&#x27;s point of view the benefit is twofold. Greylisting takes minimal configuration to get up and running with occasional modifications of any local whitelists. The second benefit is that rejecting email with a temporary 451 error (actual error code is implementation dependent) is very cheap in system resources. Most spam filtering tools are very intensive users of CPU and memory. By stopping spam before it hits filtering processes, far fewer system resources are used.

==Disadvantages==

===Delayed delivery issues===
The biggest disadvantage of greylisting is that for unrecognized servers, it destroys the near-instantaneous nature of email that users expect. Mail from unrecognized servers is typically delayed by about 15 minutes, and could be delayed up to a few days for poorly configured sending systems. Explaining this to users who have become accustomed to immediate email delivery will probably not convince them that a mail server that uses greylisting is behaving correctly.

This can be a particular problem with websites that require an account to be created and the email address confirmed before they can be used – or when a user of a greylisting mailserver attempts to reset their credentials on a website that uses email confirmation of password resets. If the sending MTA of the site is poorly configured, greylisting may delay the initial email link. In extreme cases, the delivery delay imposed by the greylister can exceed the expiry time of the password reset token delivered in email. In these cases, manual intervention may be required to whitelist the website&#x27;s mailserver such that the email containing the reset token can be used before it expires.

When a mail server is greylisted, the duration of time between the initial delay and the retransmission is variable; the greylisting server has no control or visibility of the delay. SMTP says the retry interval should be at least 30 minutes, while the give-up time needs to be at least 4–5 days; but actual values vary widely between different mail server software.

Modern greylisting applications (such as Postgrey for Unix-like operating systems) automatically whitelist senders that prove themselves capable of recovering from temporary errors, regardless of the reputed &quot;spamminess&quot; of the sender.

Implementation also generally include the ability to manually whitelist some mailservers.

One 2007 analysis of greylisting considers it totally undesirable due to the delay to mail, and unreliable as, if greylisting becomes widespread, junkmailers can adapt their systems to get around it. The conclusion is that the purpose of greylisting is to reduce the amount of spam that the server&#x27;s spam-filtering software needs to analyze, resource-intensively, and save money on servers, not to reduce the spam reaching users. The conclusion: &quot;[Greylisting] is very, very annoying. Much more annoying than spam.&quot;

===Other problems===
The current SMTP specification (RFC 5321) clearly states that &quot;the SMTP client retains responsibility for delivery of that message&quot; (section 4.2.5) and &quot;mail that cannot be transmitted immediately MUST be queued and periodically retried by the sender.&quot; (section 4.5.4.1). Most MTAs will therefore queue and retry messages, but a small number do not. These are typically handled by whitelisting or exception lists.

Also, legitimate mail might not get delivered if the retry comes from a different IP address than the original attempt. When the source of an email is a server farm or goes out through some other kind of relay service, it is likely that a server other than the original one will make the next attempt. For network fault tolerance, their IPs can belong to completely unrelated address blocks, thereby defying the simple technique of identifying the most significant part of the address. Since the IP addresses will be different, the recipient&#x27;s server will fail to recognize that a series of attempts are related, and refuse each of them in turn. This can continue until the message ages out of the queue if the number of servers is large enough. This problem can partially be bypassed by proactively identifying as exceptions such server farms. Likewise, exception have to be configured for multihomed hosts and hosts using DHCP. In the extreme case, a sender could (legitimately) use a different IPv6 address for each outbound SMTP connection.

A sender server subjected to greylisting might also reattempt delivery to another receiving mailserver if the receiving domain has more than one MX record. This may cause problems if all such hosts do not implement the same greylisting policy and share the same database.

<text>Charles Wesley Turnbull (February 5, 1935 – July 3, 2022) was an American politician, educator and historian who served as the sixth elected Governor of the United States Virgin Islands from 1999 to 2007. 

==Biography==
Charles Wesley Turnbull was born on February 6, 1935, in the island of St. Thomas to John Wesley Turnbull and Ruth Ann Eliza Skelton of Tortola. Prior to being elected governor in 1998, he was a professor at the University of the Virgin Islands, Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner of the territorial Department of Education, principal and assistant principal of Charlotte Amalie High School, and a teacher in elementary and secondary schools. He was a graduate of Hampton University, earning bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees. He earned a doctoral degree in Educational Administration from the University of Minnesota in 1976.

During his tenure as governor, Turnbull served as a member of the National Governors Association, the Southern Governors&#x27; Association, and the Democratic Governors Association.

Turnbull was prohibited from seeking re-election in 2006 due to term limits. His term of office expired on January 1, 2007, and he was succeeded by John de Jongh. Turnbull served as a member of the Virgin Islands Fifth Constitutional Convention.

==Post-gubernatorial career==
In 2011, the 29th Legislature passed a resolution naming the Estate Tutu Regional Library after him. Turnbull was awarded with the Virgin Islands Medal of Honor.

From 2015 to 2017, Turnbull served as a member of the Centennial Commission.

==Personal life==
As the first person elected to the governorship without a spouse, Turnbull has been considered as a antiman by individuals in the Virgin Islands community. Turnbull died in Washington, D.C., on July 3, 2022, at the age of 87.

<doc id="685851" wikidata="Q4869919" url="?curid=685851" title="Batting average against">
<text>In baseball statistics, batting average against (denoted by BAA or AVG), also known as opponents&#x27; batting average (denoted by OBA), is a statistic that measures a pitcher&#x27;s ability to prevent hits during official at bats. It can alternatively be described as the league&#x27;s hitters&#x27; combined batting average against the pitcher.

==Definition==
Batting average against is calculated as:

formula_1

for which:
*H is the number of hits allowed by the pitcher
*BF is the number of batters faced
*BB is the number of base on balls
*HBP is the number of hit batsmen
*SH is the number of sacrifice hits
*SF is the number of sacrifice flies
*CINT is the number of catcher&#x27;s interference

For example, if a pitcher faced 125 batters and allowed 25 hits, issued 8 walks, hit 1 batsman, allowed 2 sacrifice hits, allowed 3 sacrifice flies, and had 1 instance of catcher&#x27;s interference, the pitcher&#x27;s BAA would be calculated as:

formula_2
Reference site Baseball-Reference.com more simply defines BAA as hits divided by at bats, as &quot;at bats&quot; for a pitcher equates to the above noted denominator (batters faced less walks, hit by pitch, sacrifice hits, sacrifice flies, and catcher&#x27;s interference):

formula_3

For example, in 2021, Max Scherzer had the best (lowest) batting average against in Major League Baseball among qualified pitchers. Scherzer&#x27;s BAA for the 2021 season was:

formula_4

<text>In baseball statistics, Batters Faced (BF), also known as Total Batters Faced (TBF) or Batters Facing Pitcher (BFP) is the number of batters who made a plate appearance before the pitcher in a game or in a season.

For a given game, the number of plate appearances for an offense is 3×(Innings) + (Runs scored) + (Runners left on base).

==Major league records==

The major league record for batters faced in a career belongs to Cy Young, who faced 29,565 batters between 1890 and 1911. Will White of the Cincinnati Reds holds the single season record; he faced 2,906 batters in 1879. The last pitcher to face 1,500 or more batters in a single season was Wilbur Wood of the 1973 Chicago White Sox.

On May 1, 1920, Leon Cadore of the Brooklyn Robins faced 96 Boston Braves batters, an MLB single game record dating back to at least 1901. Oakland&#x27;s Steve McCatty is the last pitcher to face 50 or more batters in a game. McCatty pitched to 51 batters in a 14-inning complete game loss to the Seattle Mariners on August 10, 1980.

Mike Myers made 314 appearances in which he faced just one opposing batter per game, also a record.

==No batters faced==
It is possible for a pitcher to participate in a game without officially facing a batter. This can happen when a baserunner is picked off or caught stealing to end either the inning or the game. For example, in a game between the San Francisco Giants and Philadelphia Phillies on August 4, 2016, San Francisco&#x27;s Sergio Romo entered the game in the bottom of the 9th inning with the game tied and 2 out. Romo threw four pitches to Aaron Altherr before César Hernández was caught stealing second base to end the inning, after which Romo was replaced. The Giants went on to win the game in extra innings and Romo was the winning pitcher despite never officially facing a batter.

A pitcher could also not record a batter faced if he gets injured and has to be replaced before the completion of a plate appearance. Larry Yount holds the distinction of being the only pitcher in major league history to appear in the record books without ever having officially faced a batter. In Yount&#x27;s case this was also true in a literal sense as he was injured while throwing a warm-up pitch on his debut and never entered the game, but was credited with doing so due to having already been announced.

<text>Amaya (formerly Amaya World) is a discontinued free and open source WYSIWYG web authoring tool with browsing abilities.

It was created by a structured editor project at the INRIA, a French national research institution, and later adopted by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) as their testbed for web standards; a role it took over from the Arena web browser. Since the last release in January 2012, INRIA and the W3C have stopped supporting the project and active development has ceased.

Amaya has relatively low system requirements, even in comparison with other web browsers from the era of its active development period, so it has been considered a &quot;lightweight&quot; browser.

==History==
Amaya originated as a direct descendant of the &quot;Grif&quot; WYSIWYG SGML editor created in the early 1980s, and of the HTML editor Symposia, itself based on Grif, both developed and sold by French software company Grif SA.

The last change of code of Amaya was on 22 Feb 2013.

==Features==
* Access keys
* Caret navigation
* Page zooming
* Password management
* Spell checking
* Transport protocols
* Support for CSS, MathML, SVG, RDF and Xpointer
* Displays free and open image formats such as PNG and SVG, as well as a subset of SVG animation

==A test bed application==
It was used as a test-bed for new web technologies that were not supported in major browsers.

Amaya was the first client that supported the RDF annotation schema using XPointer.
The browser was available for Linux, Windows (NT and 95), Mac OS X, AmigaOS, SPARC / Solaris, AIX, OSF/1.

==Naming and logo==
Amaya was formerly called Tamaya. Tamaya is the name of the type of tree represented in the logo, but it was later discovered that Tamaya is also a trademark used by a French company, so the developers chose to drop the first letter to make it &quot;Amaya&quot;.

<doc id="685871" wikidata="Q696624" url="?curid=685871" title="Babylon Zoo">
<text>Babylon Zoo were an English rock band formed in 1992 in Wolverhampton. Their song &quot;Spaceman&quot; gained considerable exposure through its use in a Levi&#x27;s jeans television advert in the United Kingdom in late 1995. Released as the band&#x27;s debut single on 21 January 1996, it entered the UK Singles Chart at number one. &quot;Spaceman&quot; led to the band being perceived as a one-hit wonder, when subsequent releases charted less successfully.

==History==
Frontman Jas Mann had formerly been in indie music band The Sandkings. In 1993, a three-track demo earned him a contract from Phonogram Records for his next project, Babylon Zoo, but ended up being signed to Warner&#x27;s WEA record label, where the band recorded the album &quot;The Boy with the X-Ray Eyes&quot;. However, around this time Clive Black, managing director of Warner, was poached by rival record company EMI and so took Babylon Zoo over to EMI.
The band&#x27;s first single was &quot;Spaceman&quot;, which had been recorded and pressed by Warner as a CD single, before being scrapped when Black left the company. However, a promo version was played on a Manchester radio station. An advertising-agency creative heard it and decided it would be perfect for a Levi&#x27;s jeans TV advert they were developing. Levi&#x27;s used part of &quot;Spaceman&quot; for their UK TV ad and the hook of the song became popular. Even though the rest of the song turned into a slower grunge-glam style, it still became the fastest-selling debut single in British history. The single sold 383,000 copies in the first week of release, spending 5 weeks at number 1.

Critic Steven Wells wrote the &quot;Spaceman&quot; single (resembling the Levi&#x27;s advert version for only &quot;about ten seconds&quot;) angered many consumers. He reported Mann drew further ire through self-aggrandising interviews, and noted his ridicule in the media, including by &quot;NME&quot; and in a 1997 episode of comedy TV series &quot;Brass Eye&quot;.

Tim Moore wrote &quot;only failure and embarrassment&quot; followed for Babylon Zoo. An album entitled &quot;The Boy with the X-Ray Eyes&quot; was produced at Mann&#x27;s New Atlantis Productions music and video centre. It peaked at number 6 on the UK Albums Chart on 17 February, but quickly dropped out of the Top 40, lasting only a further two weeks on the chart. Subsequent singles charted progressively lower, failing to match the success of &quot;Spaceman&quot;. The band&#x27;s reputation was further damaged by a series of scathing live reviews.

In 1999, a follow-up album was released, &quot;King Kong Groover&quot;. The album received negative reviews and sold fewer than 10,000 units, failing to chart in the UK. The first single from the album was &quot;All The Money&#x27;s Gone&quot;, released in the UK and Europe and peaking at number 46 on the UK Singles Chart. The second single, a cover of Mott the Hoople&#x27;s &quot;Honaloochie Boogie&quot;, was only released as a promotional single in France. The group disbanded shortly after and Mann moved to India where he spent time working for an aid agency.

In 2005, Jas Mann announced he would be issuing a new Babylon Zoo album, called &quot;Cold Clockwork Doll&quot;, but no official release date was ever announced and no further updates followed.

==Musical style and influences==
Many journalists felt Babylon Zoo was influenced by David Bowie&#x27;s musical style. As such, the band can be seen as a 1990s alternative rock band with glam and electronic influences.

== History ==

=== French occupation ===

==== Tripoli Massacre ====
On 13 November 1943, a tragic incident took place in Tripoli, resulting in the loss of lives of 14 students, all under the age of 15. The students were struck by French tanks driven by Senegalese soldiers while participating in a peaceful march through the streets. During the demonstration, the students were fervently advocating for an end to the occupation. The massacre contributed to accelerating the declaration of Lebanon’s independence.

On 23 November 1993, Minyeh and Danniyeh were separated from Tripoli and established their own district in North Lebanon.
====2003-present====
On 16 July 2003, Akkar was separated from North Lebanon due to the presence of government departments in the city of Tripoli which forced the citizens of Akkar to come from long distances in order to finish their government transactions.

=== Syrian occupation ===

==== Killings and massacres ====

On 12 February 1978, Syrian special units () attacked the northern village of Qnat, where they killed 15 Lebanese Forces fighters, the battle is known as battle of Qnat.

Former Syrian minister of interior Mohammad al-Shaar participated in the 1986 Bab al-Tabbaneh massacre. In the 1980s, al-Shaar was a top intelligence official in northern Lebanon when Syrian troops stormed Tripoli and crushed a Sunni group that supported Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat.

==== Torture and detention ====
The Syrian military intelligence () set up a torture prison inside the Evangelical School in Jabal Mohsen, the prison was called &quot;American Prison&quot; ().

In the 2000 Lebanese general election, North Lebanon was divided in two electoral districts: Akkar-Danniyeh-Bcharreh and Tripoli-Miniyeh-Zgharta-Koura-Batroun. Those division were made by Ghazi Kanaan and Rafik Hariri to ensure that the Sunni majority would take away the true Christian opposition representation, however Nayla Moawad still managed to win.

===2005===
In the 2005 Lebanese general election, the March 14 alliance that was formed between Nayla Moawad, Boutros Harb, Kataeb, Lebanese Forces and Saad Hariri after the Cedar Revolution won all the seats in North Lebanon.

=== 2018 and 2022 ===
In the 2018 and 2022 Lebanese general election, North Lebanon was divided into 3 electoral districts: North I, North II and North III.

<doc id="685895" wikidata="Q496850" url="?curid=685895" title="René Guénon">
<text>René Jean-Marie-Joseph Guénon (15 November 1886 – 7 January 1951), also known as Abdalwahid Yahia (; ), was a French intellectual who remains an influential figure in the domain of metaphysics, having written on topics ranging from esotericism, &quot;sacred science&quot; and &quot;traditional studies&quot; to symbolism and initiation.

In his writings, he proposes to hand down eastern metaphysics and traditions, these doctrines being defined by him as of &quot;universal character&quot;, and adapt them to western readers &quot;while keeping strictly faithful to their spirit&quot;.

Initiated into Islamic esotericism from as early as 1910 when he was 24, he mainly wrote and published in French, and his works have been translated into more than twenty languages; he also wrote in Arabic an article for the journal &quot;Al Marifah&quot;.
== Biography ==
René Guénon was born in 1886 in Blois in central France from Paris. Like most Frenchmen of the time, he was born into a Roman Catholic family, originally from the Angevin, Poitou and Touraine provinces in France; his father was an architect. He was very close to his mother and even more to his aunt Mme Duru, a teacher who taught him to read and write, both devout Catholic women. By 1904, Guénon was living as a student in Paris, where his studies focused on mathematics and philosophy. He was known as a brilliant student, notably in mathematics, in spite of his poor health. In Paris in 1905, due to his health problems he abandoned the preparation for the prestigious and admission competitions.

Guénon observed and became involved with some students under the supervision of Papus. Guénon soon discovered that the Esoteric Christian Martinist order, also supervised by Papus, was irregular: he wrote later that this occultist milieu had not received any authentic spiritual transmission. He joined the Gnostic Church of France founded by Léonce Fabre des Essarts (Synesius). While he did not take this Gnostic church seriously either, it enabled him to become the founder and main contributor of a periodical review, (&quot;Gnosis&quot;), writing under the pen-name &quot;Tau Palingenius&quot; until 1922, and focusing on oriental spiritual traditions (Taoism, Hinduism and Sufism).

From his incursions into the French occultist and pseudo-Masonic orders, he despaired of the possibility of ever gathering these diverse and often ill-assorted doctrines into a &quot;stable edifice&quot;. In his book &quot;The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of the Times&quot; he also pointed out what he saw as the intellectual vacuity of the French occultist movement, which, he wrote, was utterly insignificant, and more importantly, had been compromised by the infiltration of certain individuals of questionable motives and integrity. Following his desire to join a regular Masonic obedience, he became a member of the Thebah Lodge of the following the &quot;Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite&quot;.

Guénon went on to be discharged from his military service due to his severe health problems; he took this opportunity to study philosophy at the Sorbonne during World War I. In 1917, Guénon began a one-year stay at Sétif, Algeria, teaching philosophy to college students. After World War I, he left teaching to dedicate himself to writing; his first book, &quot;Introduction to the Study of the Hindu Doctrines&quot;, was published in 1921. From 1925 Guénon became a contributor to a review edited by P. Chacornac, (&quot;The Veil of Isis&quot;), which after 1935, because of Guénon&#x27;s influence, became known as (&quot;Traditional Studies&quot;).

According to indications reproduced by his biographer Paul Chacornac and some of his close friends or collaborators such as Jean Reyor, André Préau and Frans Vreede, it is possible that René Guénon became acquainted with the initiatic lineage of Shankaracharya, and with Taoism, due to his friendship with Georges-Albert Puyou de Pouvourville, known under the pen-name Matgioi. Pouvourville was initiated into Taoism in Tonkin, Vietnam (circa 1887–1891) by a village chief: the Tong-Song-Luat (the &#x27;Master of Sentences&#x27;). Paul Chacornac hypothesized that Guénon would also have received a direct transmission of Taoism via the younger son of the Master of Sentences, Nguyen Van Cang, who came to France with Pouvourville and stayed for a while in Paris. Most biographers recognize that the encounter which marked his life and his work the most is that with Hindus, with at least one of whom having played the role of instructor if not of spiritual teacher. This meeting took place very early during the period of 1904–1909, possibly upon his exact arrival in the occultist world, if not before.

Although the exposition of Hindu doctrines to European audiences had already been attempted in piecemeal fashion at that time by some orientalists, Guénon&#x27;s &quot;Introduction to the Study of the Hindu Doctrines&quot; advanced its subject in a uniquely insightful manner, by referring to the concepts of metaphysics and Tradition in their most general sense, which Guénon precisely defined, along with the necessary distinctions and definitions of seemingly unambiguous terms such as religion, tradition, exoterism, esoterism and theology. Guénon explained that his purpose was not to describe all aspects of Hinduism, but to give the necessary intellectual foundation for a proper understanding of its spirit. The book also stands as a harsh condemnation of works presented by certain other European writers about Hinduism and Tradition in general; according to Guénon, such writers had lacked any profound understanding of their subject matter and of its implications. The book also contains a critical analysis of the political intrusions of the British Empire into the subject of Hinduism (and India itself) through Madame Blavatsky&#x27;s Theosophy. The publication of this book earned him rapid recognition in Parisian circles. René Grousset in his &quot;History of Eastern Philosophy&quot; (1923) already referred to Guénon&#x27;s work as a &quot;classic&quot;. André Malraux would say much later that it was, &quot;At its date, a book capital&quot;. On the other hand, Guénon was very disappointed by the reaction of his neo-Thomist friends, his erstwhile supporter Jacques Maritain argued that Guénon&#x27;s views were &quot;radically irreconcilable with the [Catholic] faith&quot;; he called them a &quot;Hinduist restoration of ancient Gnosis, mother of heresies&quot;. After World War II, when Maritain became French Ambassador to the Vatican, he asked for Guénon&#x27;s work to be listed under the Catholic Index of Prohibited Books, a request which had no effect due to the refusal of Pius XII and the support of Cardinal Eugène Tisserant.

René Guénon first adopted Islam in 1912, he insisted on recalling that the purely religious concept of an immediate conversion did not apply to his case, indicating he had previous acquaintance with the Islamic faith. According to P. Chacornac, Guénon thought that Islam was one of the only real traditions accessible to Westerners, while retaining authentic possibilities in the initiative domain.

In September 1920, Père Peillaube asked Guénon to write a book against the Theosophical Society. In 1921, Guénon debuted a series of articles in the French , which, along with some supplements, led to the book &quot;Theosophy: History of a Pseudo-Religion&quot;. His critique of Theosophy was received positively by conservative Catholics. However, his later book distanced him from his Catholic supporters. During the decade 1920–1930, Guénon began to acquire a broader public reputation, and his work was noted by various major intellectual and artistic figures both within and outside of Paris. Also at this time were published some of his books explaining the &quot;intellectual divide&quot; between the East and West, and the peculiar nature, according to him, of modern civilization: &quot;Crisis of the Modern World&quot;, and &quot;East and West&quot;. In 1927 was published the second major doctrinal book of his works: &quot;Man and His Becoming according to the Vedânta&quot;, and in 1929, &quot;Spiritual Authority and Temporal Power&quot;. The last book listed offers a general explanation of what Guénon saw as the fundamental differences between &quot;sacerdotal&quot; (priestly or sacred) and &quot;royal&quot; (governmental) powers, along with the negative consequences arising from the usurpation of the prerogatives of the latter with regard to the former. From these considerations, René Guénon traces to its source the origin of the modern deviation, which, according to him, is to be found in the destruction of the Templar order in 1314.

Urged on by some of his friends and collaborators, Guénon agreed to establish a new Masonic Lodge in France founded upon his &quot;Traditional ideals&quot;, purified of what he saw as the inauthentic accretions which so bedeviled other lodges he had encountered during his early years in Paris. This lodge was called (&quot;The Great Triad&quot;), a name inspired by the title of one of Guénon&#x27;s books. The first founders of the lodge, however, separated a few years after its inception. Nevertheless, this lodge, belonging to the Grande Loge de France, remains active today.

In 1930, Guénon left Paris for Cairo, where he met with Abdalhaqq-Léon Champrenaud, and Abdalhadi Alaqhili, formerly known as John-Gustaf Aguéli, to be initiated into a Sufi order of Islam. When he arrived, his outward behavior had changed and he had completely immersed himself in the popular Islamic milieu of the city. Guénon went on to be initiated into the Shadhili order by Aguéli, receiving the name &quot;Abd al-Wāḥid Yaḥiā&quot; (“John, Servant of the One”). Agueli and Champrenaud on the other hand had been initiated by Sheikh Abderrahman Elish Elkebir: Guénon sought to meet Sheikh Elkebir himself, him having been the master of the Sufi spiritual lineage with which he was affiliated, but unfortunately he had just died, hence he chose to make dhikr at his gravesite instead. Guénon went on to meet Sheikh Salama Radi, the succeeding Qutb, the highest authority of the Shadhilite branch to which Guénon belonged, after the death of Sheikh Abderrahman Elkebir. Several testimonies certify that he became Guénon&#x27;s final teacher. He lived for seven years in the medieval-style Islamic quarters around the Khan el-Khalili and often attended al-Azhar University, an intellectual center of Sunni Muslim scholarship.

One morning, at dawn, while praying at the Seyidna el Hussein mosque, in front of the mausoleum housing the remains of Husayn ibn Ali, he met Sheikh Mohammad Ibrahim, an elderly lawyer with whom he became very close. Guénon married Ibrahim&#x27;s youngest daughter in 1934, with whom he had four children. In 1937, thanks to the generosity of an English admirer of Guénon&#x27;s called John Levy, the couple became owners of a small villa, the &quot;Villa Fatima&quot; named after Guénon&#x27;s wife, in the modern district of Duqqi, west of Cairo, at the foot of the pyramids. Guénon hardly ever went out and often refused Western visitors; his address remained a secret. He spent most of his time working in his office, praying in his oratory, and talking to close friends.

In 1949, Guénon obtained Egyptian citizenship. Sedgwick wrote about Guénon&#x27;s life in Egypt, that while he continued to be interested in Hinduism and other religions, Guénon&#x27;s own practice was purely Islamic.

René Guénon died on Sunday, 7 January 1951 at the age of 64: his final word was &quot;Allah&quot;.

== Writings ==

In 1921, Guénon published his first book, an &quot;Introduction to the Study of the Hindu Doctrines&quot;. His goal, as he writes it, is an attempt at presenting to westerners eastern metaphysics and spirituality as they are understood and thought by easterners themselves, while pointing at what René Guénon describes as all the erroneous interpretations and misunderstandings of western orientalism and &quot;neospiritualism&quot; (for the latter, notably the proponents of Madame Blavatsky&#x27;s Theosophy).
For all his intellectual&#x27;s skills might be, it seems unlikely that he succeeded just by himself or with the help of a few books in getting the profound and enlightening understanding of the Vêdânta he seems to have acquired by the age of 23.

René Guénon&#x27;s work is generally divided into &quot;four major themes&quot;:

*An exposition of fundamental metaphysical principles: &quot;Introduction to the Study of the Hindu Doctrines&quot; which contains the general definition of the term &quot;Tradition&quot; (T always in capital) as Guénon defines it, &quot;Man and His Becoming According to the Vedanta&quot;, &quot;The Symbolism of the Cross&quot;, &quot;The Multiple States of Being&quot;, &quot;The Metaphysical Principles of the Infinitesimal Calculus&quot;, &quot;Oriental Metaphysics&quot;.
*Fundamental studies related to Initiation and esoterism, a subject Guénon completely re-exposited from the traditional perspective: &quot;Perspectives on Initiation&quot;, &quot;Initiation and Spiritual Realisation&quot;, &quot;The Esoterism of Dante&quot;, &quot;Saint Bernard&quot;, &quot;Insights into Christian Esoterism&quot;, &quot;Studies in Freemasonry and Compagnonnage&quot;, &quot;Studies in Hinduism&quot;, etc.
*Studies in symbolism (comprising many articles he wrote for the journal &#x27; which became later known under the name &#x27;). These studies in symbolism were later compiled by Michel Valsan in the posthumous book &quot;Symbols of Sacred Science&quot;. The studies &quot;The Great Triad&quot;, &quot;Traditional Forms and Cosmic Cycles&quot;, &quot;Insights into Islamic Esoterism and Taoism&quot; and &quot;The King of the World&quot; (alternately translated as &quot;Lord of the World&quot;) are also mostly about symbolism.
*Criticism of the modern world and of &quot;neospiritualism&quot;: &quot;East and West&quot;, &quot;The Crisis of the Modern World&quot;, &quot;Spiritual Authority and Temporal Power&quot;, &quot;Theosophy: History of a Pseudo-Religion&quot;, &quot;The Spiritist Fallacy&quot; and &quot;The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of the Times&quot;, the latter book being often considered as his masterpiece as an explanation of the modern world from the traditional perspective.

== Some key terms and ideas ==
Guénon&#x27;s writings make use of words and terms of fundamental signification, which receive a precise definition throughout his books. These terms and words, although receiving a usual meaning and being used in many branches of human sciences, have, according to René Guénon, substantially lost their original significance (e.g. words such as &quot;metaphysics&quot;, &quot;initiation&quot;, &quot;mysticism&quot;, &quot;personality&quot;, &quot;form&quot;, &quot;matter&quot;). He insisted notably on the danger represented by the perversion of the signification of words which he saw as essential for the study of metaphysics.

== Metaphysical core ==
The exposition of metaphysical doctrines, which forms the cornerstone of Guénon&#x27;s work, consists of the following books:
*&quot;Introduction to the Study of the Hindu Doctrines&quot;
*&quot;Man and His Becoming According to the Vedanta&quot;
*&quot;The Multiple States of Being&quot;
*&quot;Symbolism of the Cross&quot;
*&quot;Oriental Metaphysics&quot;

=== &quot;Introduction to the Study of the Hindu Doctrines&quot; ===
&quot;Introduction to the Study of the Hindu Doctrines&quot;, published in 1921, on topics which were later included in the lecture he gave at the Sorbonne on December 17, 1925 (&quot;Oriental Metaphysics&quot;), consists of four parts.

The first part (&quot;preliminary questions&quot;) exposes the hurdles that prevented classical orientalism from a deep understanding of eastern doctrines (without forgetting that Guénon had of course in view the orientalism of his time): the &quot;classical prejudice&quot; which &quot;consists essentially in a predisposition to attribute the origin of all civilization to the Greeks and Romans&quot;, the ignorance of certain types of relationships between the ancient peoples, linguistic difficulties, and the confusions arising about certain questions related to chronology, these confusions being made possible through the ignorance of the importance of oral transmission which can precede, to a considerable and indeterminate extent, written formulation. A fundamental example of that latter mistake being found in the orientalist&#x27;s attempts at providing a precise birth date to the Vedas sacred scriptures.

The &quot;general characters of eastern thought&quot; part focuses on the principles of unity of the eastern civilizations, and on the definition of the notions of &quot;tradition&quot; and &quot;metaphysics&quot;. Guénon also proposes a rigorous definition of the term &quot;religion&quot;, which he saw as &quot;the conjunction of three elements&quot;, that being a dogma, a moral law, and a form of worship. He also goes on to state the proper differences between &quot;tradition&quot;, &quot;religion&quot;, &quot;metaphysics&quot; and &quot;philosophical system&quot;. The relations between &quot;metaphysics&quot; and &quot;theology&quot; are also explored, and the fundamental terms of &quot;esoterism&quot; and &quot;exoterism&quot; are introduced. A chapter is devoted to the idea of &quot;metaphysical realization&quot;. The first two parts state, according to Guénon, the necessary doctrinal foundations for a correct understanding of Hindu doctrines.

=== &quot;Man and His Becoming According to the Vedanta&quot; ===

The &quot;Introduction to the study of the Hindu doctrines&quot; had, among its objectives, the purpose of giving the proper intellectual basis to promote openness to the study of eastern intellectuality. The study of Hindu doctrines is continued in his book &quot;Man and His Becoming According to the Vedanta&quot;. There he described a part of the doctrine of Vêdânta according to the formulation of Adi Shankara focusing on the human being: his constitution, his states, his posthumous future, the purpose of existence being presented as identity with the Self. (Âtmâ), the transcendent principle of being, identical to Brahma. The &quot;Self&quot; is the essence, the transcendent &quot;Principle&quot; of being, the human being for example. He specifies that &quot;Personality&quot; comes under the order of universal principles: pure metaphysics has for its domain the &quot;Universal&quot;, which is without common measure with the domain of the general and of what is designated by the term of categories in philosophy.

In the history of Western thought, only the transcendentals of scholastic theology belong to the &quot;Universal&quot;. The &quot;Self&quot; contains all the states of manifestation but also all the states of non-manifestation. If one considers the &quot;Self&quot; only as the principle of manifested states only, it identifies with Ishvara, the notion closest to the Creator God in Hindu doctrines, according to him. All manifested states represent &quot;manifestation&quot;, or &quot;Universal Existence,&quot; where everything is related. Nothing can fundamentally be isolated from the rest of the manifestation: there is oneness of “Existence”. Like the principle of manifestation, the &quot;Being&quot; (Sat, or Ishvara if considered in a personalized form), is &quot;One.&quot; He then sets out the purpose of human existence: the realization of identity with the &quot;Self&quot; understood as the true essence of the human being. He adds that the &quot;Self&quot; resides in the vital center of the human being symbolized by the heart. According to Guénon, according to all spiritual traditions, the heart is &quot;the seat of Intelligence&quot; understood as supra-rational knowledge, the only form of knowledge allowing &quot;Supreme Identity&quot;. This supra-rational knowledge (and especially not irrational) is Buddhi, the higher intellect, introduced by Guénon in chapter VII of his book. For its part, the brain is the instrument of the mind, in particular of rational thought, indirect knowledge. It is Buddhi, who resides in the heart of every being, who ensures the unification between all the states of existence and the oneness of &quot;Existence&quot;.

The general considerations of the &quot;Self&quot;, the &quot;Unmanifested&quot; and the universal &quot;Manifestation&quot; are introduced according to Advaita Vêdânta: the &quot;universal Manifestation&quot; is all that exists and its development is constantly being developed, towards destiny. The &quot;Unmanifested&quot; is all that is beyond universal Manifestation, so that it can only be designated by negation. The second chapter also establishes the fundamental distinctions between the &quot;Self&quot; and the ego, or &quot;personality&quot; and &quot;individuality&quot;, the first being the only One that is &quot;absolutely real&quot;. These ideas are declined in different denominations depending, for a first part, on the different degrees of reality considered, and also from the &quot;transcendent&quot; and &quot;immanent&quot; point of views that can be contemplated: Ishwara is the &quot;Divine personality&quot; or the Principle of universal Manifestation. It is unmanifested, for the Principle of Manifestation cannot be Itself manifested (this is in relation to the symbolism of &quot;black heads&quot;: Ishwara has Its head in &quot;darkness&quot;). Atmâ, Paramâtmâ, Brahmâ: the realization that the Self, &quot;in relation to any being whatsoever, is in reality identical to Atmâ&quot;, constitutes the heart of the Hindu doctrine of &quot;delivrance&quot; or &quot;moksha&quot;, and that doctrine is absolutely identical to what Islamic esoterism calls the &quot;Supreme Identity&quot; (that is to say, expressed in Hindu terms, the identity of Atmâ and Brahmâ):

&quot;the &#x27;Supreme Identity&#x27;, according to an expression borrowed from Islamic esoterism, where the doctrine on this and on many other points is fundamentally the same as in the Hindu tradition, in spite of great differences in form.&quot;

The rigor and quality of the presentation refer to the quality of the Hindu master whom Guénon had met during the period 1905-1909 and about whom he does not breathe a word in his book: some supposed that he must have studied the texts cited directly with these Hindus. The book was very well received and was the subject of many glowing reviews in the press on the right and on the left, sometimes in newspapers with very large circulation. Paul Claudel spoke about the book placing it next to those of Sylvain Lévi and René Grousset and the Islamologist Louis Massignon wanted to meet Guénon: the meeting took place that year (1925).

Paul Chacornac quotes a letter from Roger de Pasquier: &quot;It was not until 1949, during a stay in Bénarès, that I learned of René Guénon&#x27;s work. It had been recommended to me to read by Alain Danielou [who was then living in India in the entourage of Swami Karpatri, a master of Advaita Vêdânta], who had submitted Guénon&#x27;s works to orthodox pundits. The verdict of these was clear: of all the Westerners who dealt with Hindu doctrines, only Guénon, they said, really understood the meaning. The academic Michel Hulin, a specialist in Indian philosophy, wrote in 2001 that Man and his future according to the Vedânta remains &quot;one of the most rigorous and profound interpretations of the Shankarian doctrine&quot;.

=== &quot;The Symbolism of the Cross&quot; ===
&quot;The Symbolism of the Cross&quot; is a book &quot;dedicated to the venerated memory of Esh-Sheikh Abder-Rahman Elish El-Kebir&quot;. Its goal, as Guénon states it, &quot;is to explain a symbol that is common to almost all traditions, a fact that would seem to indicate its direct attachment to the great primordial tradition&quot;. To alleviate the hurdles bound to the interpretations of a symbol belonging to different traditions, Guénon distinguishes &quot;synthesis&quot; from &quot;syncretism&quot;: syncretism consists in assembling from the outside a number of more or less incongruous elements which, when so regarded, can never be truly unified. Syncretism is something outward: the elements taken from any of its quarters and put together in this way can never amount to anything more than borrowings that are effectively incapable of being integrated into a doctrine &quot;worthy of that name&quot;. To apply these criteria to the present context of the symbolism of the cross:

syncretism can be recognized wherever one finds elements borrowed from different traditional forms and assembled together without any awareness that there is only one single doctrine of which these forms are so many different expressions or so many adaptations related to particular conditions related to given circumstances of time and place. 

A notable example of syncretism can be found, according to Guénon, in the &quot;doctrines&quot; and symbols of the Theosophical society. Synthesis on the other hand is carried essentially from within, by which it properly consists in envisaging things in the unity of their principle. Synthesis will exist when one starts from unity itself and never loses sight of it throughout the multiplicity of its manifestations; this moreover implies the ability to see beyond forms and an awareness of the principal truth. Given such awareness, one is at liberty to make use of one or another of those forms, something that certain traditions symbolically denote as &quot;the gift of tongues&quot;. The concordance between all traditional forms may be said to represent genuine &quot;synonymies&quot;. In particular, René Guénon writes that the cross is a symbol that in its various forms is encountered almost everywhere, and from the most remote of times. It is therefore far from belonging peculiarly to the Christian tradition, and the cross, like any other traditional symbol, can be regarded according to manifold senses.

Far from being an absolute and complete unity in himself, the individual in reality constitutes but a relative and fragmentary unity. The multiplicity of the states of the being, &quot;which is a fundamental metaphysical truth&quot;, implies the effective realization of the being&#x27;s multiple states and is related to the concept that various traditional doctrines, including Islamic esoterism, denote by the term &#x27;Universal Man&#x27;: in Arabic &quot;al-Insân-al-kâmil&quot; is at the same time &#x27;Primordial man&#x27; (&quot;al-Insân-al-qadîm&quot;); it is the Adam Qadmon of the Hebrew Kabbalah; it is also the &#x27;King&#x27; (Wang) of the Far-Eastern tradition (Tao Te King chap. 25). The conception of the &#x27;Universal Man&#x27; establishes a constitutive analogy between universal manifestation and its individual human modality, or, to use the language of Western Hermeticism, between the &#x27;macrocosm&#x27; and the &#x27;microcosm&#x27;.

From these considerations, the geometrical symbolism of the cross, in its most universal signification, can be contemplated: most traditional doctrines symbolize the realization of &#x27;Universal Man&#x27; by a sign that is everywhere the same because, according to Guénon, it is one of those directly attached to the primordial tradition. That sign is the sign of the cross, which very clearly represents the manner of achievement of this realization by the perfect communion of all states of the being, harmoniously and conformably ranked, in integral expansion, in the double sense of &quot;amplitude&quot; and &quot;exaltation&quot;.

=== &quot;The Multiple States of Being&quot; ===

This book expands on the multiple states of Being, a doctrine already tackled in &quot;The Symbolism of the Cross&quot;, leaving aside the geometrical representation exposed in that book &quot;to bring out the full range of this altogether fundamental theory&quot;.
First and foremost is asserted the necessity of the &quot;metaphysical Infinity&quot;, envisaged in its relationship with &quot;universal Possibility&quot;. &quot;The Infinite, according to the etymology of the term which designates it, is that which has no limits&quot;, so it can only be applied to what has absolutely no limit, and not to what is exempted from certain limitations while being subjected to others like space, time, quantity, in other words all countless other things that fall within the indefinite, fate and nature. There is no distinction between the Infinite and universal Possibility, simply the correlation between these terms indicates that in the case of the Infinite, it is contemplated in its active aspect, while the universal Possibility refers to its passive aspect: these are the two aspects of Brahma and its &quot;Shakti&quot; in the Hindu doctrines. From this results that &quot;the distinction between the possible and the real [...] has no metaphysical validity, for every possible is real in its way, according to the mode befitting its own nature&quot;. This leads to the metaphysical consideration of the &quot;Being&quot; and &quot;Non-Being&quot;:

If we [...] define Being in the universal sense as the principle of manifestation, and at the same time as comprising in itself the totality of possibilities of all manifestation, we must say that Being is not infinite because it does not coincide with total Possibility; and all the more so because Being, as the principle of manifestation, although it does indeed comprise all the possibilities of manifestation, does so only insofar as they are actually manifested. Outside of Being, therefore, are all the rest, that is all the possibilities of non-manifestation, as well as the possibilities of manifestation themselves insofar as they are in the unmanifested state; and included among these is Being itself, which cannot belong to manifestation since it is the principle thereof, and in consequence is itself unmanifested. For want of any other term, we are obliged to designate all that is thus outside and beyond Being as &quot;Non-Being&quot;, but for us this negative term is in no way synonym for &#x27;nothingness&#x27;.

For instance, our present state, in its corporeal modality, is defined by five conditions: space, time, &quot;matter&quot; (i.e. quantity), &quot;form&quot;, and life, and these five conditions enter into correlation with the five corporeal elements (&quot;bhutas&quot; of the Hindu doctrine, see below) to create all living forms (including us in our corporeal modalities) in our world and state of existence. But the universal Manifestation is incommensurably more vast, including all the states of existence that correspond to other conditions or possibilities, yet Being Itself is the principle of universal Manifestation.

This involves the foundation of the theory of multiple states and the metaphysical notion of the &quot;Unicity of the Existence&quot; (&quot;wahdatul-wujûd&quot;) as it is for instance developed in Islamic esoterism by Mohyddin Ibn Arabi. The relationships of unity and multiplicity lead to a more accurate &quot;description&quot; of the Non-Being: in it, there can be no question of a multiplicity of states, since this domain is essentially that of the undifferentiated and even of the unconditionned: &quot;the undifferentiated cannot exist in a distinctive mode&quot;, although we still speak analogously of the states of the non-manifestation: Non-Being is &quot;Metaphysical Zero&quot; and is logically anterior to unity; that is why Hindu doctrine speaks in this regard only of &quot;non duality&quot; (&quot;advaita&quot;). Analogous considerations drawn from the study of dream state help understand the relationships of unity and multiplicity: in dream state, which is one of the modalities of the manifestation of the human being corresponding to the subtle (that is, non-corporeal) part of its individuality, &quot;the being produces a world that proceeds entirely from itself, and the objects therein consist exclusively of mental images (as opposed to the sensory perceptions of the waking state), that is to say of combinations of ideas clothed in subtle forms that depend substantially of the subtle form of the individual himself, moreover, of which the imaginal objects of a dream are nothing but accidental and secondary modifications&quot;. Then, René Guénon studies the possibilities of individual consciousness and the mental (&quot;mind&quot;) as the characteristic element of the human individuality. In chapter X (&quot;Limits of the Indefinite&quot;), he comes back to the notion of metaphysical realization (&quot;moksha&quot;, or &quot;Supreme identity&quot;). A superior signification of the notion of &quot;darkness&quot; is then introduced, most notably in the chapter entitled &quot;The two chaoses&quot;, which describes what is happening during the course of spiritual realization when a disciple leaves the domain of &quot;formal possibilities&quot;. The multiples states of the Being is essentially related to the notion of &quot;spiritual hierarchies&quot;, which is found in all traditions. Hence is described the universal process of the &quot;realization of the Being through Knowledge&quot;.

=== &quot;Oriental Metaphysics&quot; ===

Guénon gave a conference at La Sorbonne on December 17, 1925. This conference was organized by the “group of Philosophical and Scientific Studies for the Examination of New Ideas” founded by Doctor René Allendy. The objective of this association was to reflect on a European union based on overcoming national rivalries and to promote rapprochement between the East and the West. Guénon repeatedly explained that a union could only be based on a restoration of true &quot;intellectuality&quot; which, alone, could transcend the differences between cultures and this is the reason why he clarified what he called by real “intellectuality” during his speech. The Sorbonne conference was published in several parts in the journal in 1926 and then in book form in 1939.

During the conference, Guénon clarified what he called by true &quot;intellectuality&quot; and by &quot;metaphysics&quot;. These points were essential for the constitution of a spiritual elite which aimed to reconstitute a union between the peoples. He explained that metaphysics &quot;literally means that which is&quot; beyond physics &quot;&quot;, i.e. what is beyond nature. He insisted on the fact that this requires going beyond the manifested world and therefore all phenomena. Metaphysics therefore has nothing to do with phenomena even with extraordinary phenomena. Metaphysics must go beyond the domain of being and must therefore go beyond ontology. He added: “metaphysics is supra-rational, intuitive [beyond subject-object duality] and immediate knowledge” (while rational knowledge is indirect). The path to this knowledge requires &quot;only one essential preparation, and that is theoretical knowledge [implied by traditional doctrines]&quot;. But, he clarified, all this cannot go far without the most important means which is &quot;the concentration&quot;. Guénon then described the different stages of the spiritual path:

* first of all, going beyond the temporal condition to reach &quot;the primordial state&quot; which corresponds to the &quot;sense of eternity&quot;. In this state, one &quot;is therefore freed from time, the apparent succession of things is transmuted into [...] simultaneity&quot;. This is the ultimate goal of the &quot;lesser mysteries&quot; (with the signification given by the ancient Greeks to the classical names of &quot;lesser&quot; and &quot;greater&quot; mysteries).
* attainment of supra-individual (non-human) states beyond form (which can be obtained by intuitive knowledge which goes beyond the division between subject and object).
* attainment of &quot;the absolutely unconditioned state freed from all limitation&quot; even beyond the separation between being and non-being. He wrote, in fact, &quot;it is beyond being that this goal resides&quot;. This state is reached upon &quot;Deliverance&quot; (Moksha in the Hindu doctrine). This is the goal of the &quot;greater mysteries&quot; in the Eleusinian Mysteries.

== Initiation and spiritual realization ==

In his &quot;Introduction to the Study of Hindu Doctrines&quot;, Guénon writes that &quot;metaphysics affirms the identity of knowing and being&quot; and that &quot;it does not only affirm it, it realizes it&quot;. The effective means of realization are found in what is called &quot;initiation&quot;. Articles written by him on this subject were collected later in the form of two books including &quot;Perspectives on Initiation&quot; (1946) and &quot;Initiation and Spiritual Realization&quot; (published in 1952 after his death).

Guénon declared that the path to this knowledge requires &quot;only one essential preparation, and that is theoretical knowledge [implied by traditional doctrines]&quot;. But he clarified, all this cannot go far without the most important means which is &quot;concentration&quot;. The rational study of the initiatory texts and the implementation of the rites are of no use if the spiritual transmission has not taken place: for example, the recitation of a mantra is useless without the &#x27;spiritual influence transmitted by the master during the initiation. One cannot initiate oneself alone. Moreover for Guénon, any desire to revive dead traditions (of ancient Egypt, Celts, Germans, etc.) has no meaning. The spiritual laws which govern the spiritual path have nothing to do with the magic or the paranormal phenomena which concern the psychic and not the spiritual: to be attached to these phenomena is an obstacle to the spiritual development. Guénon considers imperative the need to combine esotericism with the corresponding exoterism and not to mix the practices of different traditions: one must practice only one spiritual path (Islam, Christianity, Judaism, etc.)

&quot;Perspectives on Initiation&quot;, first published at the close of World War II in 1946, extends a series of articles on the central subject of initiation originally written between 1932 and 1938 for &#x27; (later renamed &#x27;). Initiation is introduced as the transmission, by the appropriate rites of a given tradition, of a &quot;spiritual influence&quot;. Related articles were later published, in 1952, in the posthumous collection &quot;Initiation and Spiritual Realization&quot;. While the notion of initiation is introduced in the most general setting, it is impossible, writes Guénon, to write a complete and comprehensive book on the subject &quot;for an indefinite number of questions could be raised – the very nature of the subject resisting any set limit&quot;. However, the subject of initiation being contemplated from a general point of view, the goal of Guénon goes beyond an introduction to the subject and, doing so, to make clear distinctions between what is relevant to initiation and what is not. First, in particular, he insists on clarifying his position on the essential differences between &quot;mysticism&quot; and initiation so that, to him, initiation is, by its very nature, incompatible with mysticism:

In the case of mysticism the individual simply limits himself to what is presented to him and to the manner in which it is presented, having himself no say in the matter [...] In the case of initiation, on the contrary, the individual is the source of initiative towards &#x27;realization&#x27;, pursued methodically under rigorous and unremitting control, and normally reaching beyond the very possibilities of the individual as such.
For Guénon, there are traditions where the esoteric/exoteric separation does not formally exist (Hinduism, Tibetan Lamaism). In China, the two are totally separate (Confucianism for exotericism and Taoism for esotericism) with relative autonomy from each-other. The two overlap in Islam (with Sharia and Tariqa) and Judaism (with the Mosaic Law and Kabbalah) where exotericism has autonomy from esotericism whereas esotericism remains grounded by the former. In the West, Guénon claims that Christianity had a strong esoteric character at its origin but that to save the Roman world, it exteriorized itself in a providential way: the Christian sacraments then went from esoteric to exoteric status (which would become a point of contention among some of his interlocutors). In the Middle Ages, Christian initiation groups existed, the most important was the order of the Temple. After the destruction of this order, Christian esotericism became more and more closed and separated from the official Church. Freemasonry and Compagnonnage inherited the last Western initiation rites. For Guénon, the Catholic Church has retained its authentic religious dimension but has lost its esoteric dimension no longer making access to final deliverance possible. Mysticism since the Renaissance is a passive path inferior to the initiatory path: it allows to reach the divine but in an indirect and often uncontrollable way. Freemasonry has kept initiatory transmissions but, in addition to the fact that it is about low initiations (initiations of trades mixed with remains of chivalrous initiations), its passage from operative masonry to speculative masonry in the 18th century prevents the transition from virtual initiation to effective initiation, the latter had to be done by exercising the profession in question. More seriously still, Masonry turned in part from its initiatory role in the 19th century to devote itself to politics in a more anti-traditional (anti-Catholic) direction. Guénon has long kept the hope of an alliance between some members of the Catholic Church and Masonry to reconstitute a complete elite (combining the Catholic religion and Christian Masonry). He envisioned that Eastern masters could spiritually revive these traditions from time to time.

The application of the distinction between esotericism and exoterism to Christianity, Guénon&#x27;s position on mysticism and the assertion that the Catholic sacraments have lost their initiatory character have been the subject of strong criticism. It is this point which led to the rupture between Guénon and Frithjof Schuon. Guénon&#x27;s ideas on esotericism had a significant impact on Freemasonry especially in Latin speaking countries. According to David Bisson, the redefinition of esotericism by René Guénon is considered &quot;as an essential chapter in the history of Western esotericism - as it is conceived and developed by Antoine Faivre&quot;: the latter emphasized the importance of Guénon and the currents that claim to be based on his notion of Tradition in the esoteric Western currents.

On the subject of initiation, Guénon clarifies the signification given by the ancient Greeks to the classical names of &quot;lesser&quot; and &quot;greater&quot; mysteries: &quot;they are not different &quot;types&quot; of initiations, but stages or degrees of a same initiation&quot;. Lesser mysteries lead to the &quot;perfection of the human state&quot;, in other words to &quot;something traditionally designated by the restoration of the &quot;primordial state&quot;, a state that Dante, in the Divine comedy, relates symbolically to the &quot;terrestrial paradise&quot;. On another hand, &quot;greater mysteries&quot; refer properly to &quot;the realization of supra-human states&quot;; they correspond to the Hindu doctrine of &quot;deliverance&quot; (Moksha) and to what Islamic esoterism calls the &quot;realization of the Universal Man&quot;: in that latter tradition, &quot;lesser&quot; and &quot;greater&quot; &quot;mysteries&quot; correspond exactly to the signification of the terms &quot;el-insân el-qadîm&quot; (the Primordial Man) and &quot;el-insan el-kâmil&quot; (the Universal Man). These two phases are related to an interpretation of the symbolism of the cross with the notions of &quot;horizontal&quot; and &quot;vertical&quot; realization. They also correspond respectively to what is traditionally designated in &quot;western hermeticism&quot; by the terms &quot;royal initiation&quot; and &quot;sacerdotal initiation&quot;.

==Other writings in metaphysics, hermeticism and cosmological sciences==

===Lesser and greater mysteries===
===Hindu doctrine of cosmic cycles===
Guénon introduces some preliminary aspects of a particular (and extremely complex) cosmological science: the Hindu doctrine of &quot;cosmic cycles&quot;, for instance in the article &quot;Some remarks on the doctrine of cosmic cycles&quot;. He writes that giving an overview of this theory and its equivalents in different traditional forms is merely an impossible task &quot;not only because the question is very complex in itself, but specially owing to the extreme difficulty of expressing these things in a European language, and in a way that is intelligible to the present-day Western mentality, which has had no practice whatsoever with this kind of thinking&quot;. All that is possible in this respect is to clarify a few points with remarks &quot;which can only raise suggestions about the meaning of the doctrine in question rather than really explaining it&quot;.

In the most general sense of the term, a cycle must be considered as &quot;representing the process of development of some state of manifestation, or, in the case of minor cycles, of one of the more or less restricted and specialized modalities of that state&quot;. Moreover, in virtue &quot;of the law of correspondence which links all things in universal Existence, there is necessarily and always a certain analogy, either among the different cycles of the same order or among the principal cycles and their secondary divisions&quot;. This allows to use one and the same mode of expression when speaking about the cycles, although this must often be understood only symbolically, and this allude here especially to the &#x27;chronological&#x27; form under which the doctrine of cycles is presented: since a &quot;Kalpa&quot; represents the total development of a world, that is to say of a state or degree of universal existence, &quot;it is obvious that one cannot speak literally about its duration, computed according to some temporal measure, unless this duration relates to a state of which time is one of the determination, as in our world&quot;. Everywhere else, this duration is only purely symbolic and must be transposed analogically, for temporal succession is only an image both logical and ontological, of &#x27;extra-temporal&#x27; series of causes and effects.

Inside a &quot;Kalpa&quot;, the &quot;Manvantaras&quot;, or eras of successive Manus, are 14 in number, forming two septenary series of which the first includes both past Manvantaras and the present one, and the second future Manvantaras: the present humanity is in the seventh Manvantara of the Kalpa. These two series can be linked with those of the seven &quot;Svargas&quot; and the seven &quot;Patalas&quot;, &quot;which, from the point of view of the hierarchy of the degrees of existence or of universal manifestation, represent the states respectively higher and lower than the human state&quot;. Another correspondence concerns the seven &quot;dvīpa&quot; (devanagari: द्वीप) or &#x27;regions&#x27; into which the world is divided. Although according to the proper meaning of the word that designates them these are represented as islands or continents distributed in a certain way in space, one must be careful not to take this literally and to regard them simply as different parts of present-day earth: Guénon writes that they &#x27;emerge&#x27; in turns and not simultaneously, and only one of them is manifested in the sensible domain over the course of a certain period. If that period is a &quot;Manvantara&quot;, one will have to conclude that each &quot;dvīpa&quot; will have to appear twice in the Kalpa or once in each of the just mentioned septenary series, which correspond to one another inversely as do all similar cases, particularly the Svargas and the Patalas, one can deduce that the order of appearance for the &quot;dvīpa&quot; will likewise have to be, in the second series, the inverse of what it was in the first: this is matter of different &#x27;states&#x27; of the terrestrial world rather than &#x27;regions&#x27; properly speaking. The &quot;Jambudvīpa&quot; really represents the entire earth in its present state (not only in its corporeal modality), and if it is said to extend to the south of &quot;Meru&quot;, the &#x27;axial&#x27; mountain around which our world revolves, &quot;this is because Meru is identified symbolically with the North Pole, so that the whole earth is really situated to the south with respect to it. To explain this more completely it would be necessary to develop the symbolism of the directions of space according to which the Dvīpas are distributed, as well as correspondences existing between this spatial symbolism and the temporal symbolism on which the whole doctrine of cycles rest&quot;.

This way of envisaging the dvīpas, writes René Guénon, is also confirmed by concordant data from other traditions which also speak of &#x27;seven lands&#x27; particularly Islamic esoterism and Hebrew Kabbalah. Thus in the latter, even while these &#x27;seven lands&#x27; are outwardly represented by as many divisions of the land of Canaan, they are related to the reigns of the &#x27;seven kings of Edom&#x27; which clearly correspond to the seven &quot;Manus&quot; of the first series; and all are included in the &#x27;Land of the Living&#x27; which represents the complete development of our world considered as realized permanently in its principal state. &quot;We can note here the coexistence of two points of view, one of succession, which refers to the manifestation in itself, and the other of simultaneity, which refers to its principle or to what one could call its &#x27;archetype&#x27;; and at root the correspondence between these two points of view is in a certain way equivalent to that between temporal symbolism and spatial symbolism to which we just alluded in connection with the Dvīpas of the Hindu tradition&quot;.

&quot;In Islamic esoterism, the &#x27;seven lands&#x27; appear, perhaps even more explicitly, as so many &quot;tabaqāt&quot; or &#x27;categories&#x27; of terrestrial existence, which coexist and in a way interpenetrate, but only one of which is presently accessible to the senses while the others are in a latent state and can only be perceived exceptionally and under special conditions&quot;; these too are manifested outwardly in turn, during the different periods that succeed one another in the course of the total duration of this world. On the other hand, each of the &#x27;seven lands&#x27; is governed by a &quot;Qutb&quot; or &#x27;pole&#x27;, which thus corresponds very clearly to the &quot;Manu&quot; of the period during which the land is manifested; and these seven &quot;Aktab&quot; are subordinated to the supreme &#x27;pole&#x27; just as the different &quot;Manus&quot; are subordinate to the &quot;Adi-Manu&quot; or primordial &quot;Manu&quot;; but because these &#x27;seven lands&#x27; coexist, they also in a certain respect exercise their functions in a permanent and simultaneous way. &quot;It is hardly necessary&quot;, writes Guénon, &quot;to point out that the designation of &#x27;Pole&#x27; is closely related to the polar symbolism of &quot;Meru&quot;. &quot;Meru&quot; itself has in any case its exact equivalent in the Mountain of Qāf in Islamic tradition. And the seven terrestrial &#x27;Poles&#x27; are considered to be reflections of the seven celestial &#x27;poles&#x27; which preside respectively over the seven planetary heavens; &quot;and this naturally evokes the correspondence with the &quot;Svargas&quot; in Hindu doctrine, which shows in sum the perfect concordance in this regard between the two traditions&quot;.

The Yugas are the divisions of the &quot;Manvantara&quot;, and they are four in number, which correspond, in the spatial symbolism, to the four cardinal points. There is an obvious equivalence with the four &quot;Yugas&quot; and the four ages of gold, silver, bronze and iron of the Greco-Latin antiquity. Guénon writes that the figures given as durations of the Yugas in various Indian texts are to be taken symbolically, their actual exact determination needs in-depth and specific knowledge as these numbers are often written, for various traditional reasons, with an undetermined number of zeros added to their transcription. Guénon gives indications for the determination of the Yuga&#x27;s durations: if the total duration of the &quot;Manvantara&quot; is represented by 10, then the durations of the four Yugas are:
*Krita Yuga or Satya Yuga: 4, corresponding to 25,920 years.
*Treta Yuga: 3, (19,440 years).
*Dvapara Yuga: 2, (12,960 years).
*Kali Yuga: 1, (6,480 years).
so that the division of the Manvantara is carried out by the formula: 10 = 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 which is, in reverse, that of the Pythagorean &quot;Tetraktys&quot;. This last formula corresponds to what the language of Western Hermeticism calls &#x27;the circling of the square&#x27; and the other to the opposite problem of &#x27;squaring of the circle&#x27; which expresses precisely the relation of the end of a cycle to its beginning, that is, the integration of its total development. Guénon writes: &quot;We are presently in an advanced phase of the Kali Yuga&quot;.

===Science of letters in Islam===

Guénon writes that while the knowledge of nirukta unveils inner meanings in Vedic sacred scriptures, in Islam, the science of letters is central in &quot;islamic esoterism&quot;, where exoterism and esoterism are often compared to the &#x27;shell&#x27; (&quot;qishr&quot;) and the &#x27;kernel&#x27; (&quot;lubb&quot;) or to the circonference and its center. On the subject of esoterism, and its relations with the Islamic doctrine, he refers to the Arabic words &quot;tariqah&quot; and &quot;haqiqah&quot; (means and end), and notes that the general meaning of &quot;esoterism&quot; is designated by the term . According to Guénon, that latter term can only be translated precisely as &#x27;initiation&#x27;. And while refers to any esoteric and initiatic doctrine, he questions the [derivative] term &#x27;sufism&#x27; to designate Islamic esoterism. Guénon writes that this term &quot;has the unfortunate disadvantage of inevitably suggesting by its &#x27;ism&#x27; suffix, the idea of a doctrine proper to a particular school, whereas this is not the case in reality, the only schools in question being the turuq, which basically represent the different methods, without there being any possibility of a fundamental difference of doctrine, for &#x27;the doctrine of Unity is unique&#x27; (at-tawhidu wahid)&quot;. According to Guénon, the derivation of the word sūfi is undoubtedly unsolvable, &quot;the word having too many proposed etymologies, of equal plausibility, for only one to be true&quot;. For him, the word is a purely symbolic name, which, as such, requires no linguistic derivation strictly speaking: &quot;The so-called etymologies are basically only phonetic resemblances, which, moreover, according to the laws of a certain symbolism, effectively correspond to relationships between various ideas which have come to be grouped more or less as accessories around the word in question.&quot;

But, given the character of the Arabic language (a character which it shares with Hebrew) the primary and fundamental meaning a of word is to be found in the numerical values of the letters; and in fact, what is particularly remarkable is that the sum of the numerical values of the letters which form the word sūfi has the same number as al-Hikmatu&#x27;l-ilahiya, &#x27;Divine Wisdom&#x27;. The true sūfi is therefore the one who possesses this Wisdom, or, in other words, he is al-&#x27;arif bi&#x27; Llah that is to say &#x27;he who knows through God&#x27;, for God cannot be known except by Himself, and this is the supreme or &#x27;total&#x27; degree of knowledge or haqiqah.

Guénon then introduces the symbolism used in &quot;taṣawwuf&quot; about the numerical signification of Arabic letters:

The divine &#x27;Throne&#x27; which surrounds all worlds (&quot;al-Arsh al-Muhit&quot;) is represented by the figure of a circle. In the center is ar-Rūh [the Spirit], and the &#x27;Throne&#x27; is supported by eight angels positionned on the circumference, the first four at the four cardinal points and the other four at four intermediary points. The names of these angels are formed by various groups of letters arranged according to their numeric values in such a way that, taken together, the names comprise all the letters of the alphabet. The alphabet in question has 28 letters, but it is said that at the very beginning the Arabic alphabet had only 22 letters, corresponding exactly to those of the Hebrew alphabet; in doing so, the distinction is made between the lesser &quot;jafr&quot;, which uses only 22 letters, and the greater &quot;jafr&quot;, which uses 28 and conceives of them all with distinct numerical values. Moreover, it can be said that 28 (2 + 8 = 10) is contained in 22 (2 + 2 = 4) as 10 is contained in 4, according to Pythagorean &quot;Tetraktys&quot;: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10, and, in fact, the six supplementary letters are only modifications of the original six letters from which they are formed by a simple addition of a dot, and to which they are restored immediately by the suppression of this same dot.
It will be noticed that each of the two groups of four names contains exactly half of the alphabet, or 14 letters, which are distributed respectively in the following fashion (when considering the first four angels at cardinal points, and the second group of angels at intermediary points):
*In the first half: 4 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 14
*In the second half: 4 + 4 + 3 + 3 = 14
The numeric values of the eight names formed from the sum of those of their letters are, taking them naturally in order:
*1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10
*5 + 6 + 7 = 18
*8 + 9 + 10 = 27
*20 + 30 + 40 + 50 = 140
*60 + 70 + 80 + 90 = 300
*100 + 200 + 300 + 400 = 1000
*500 + 600 + 700 = 1800
*800 + 900 + 1000 = 2700
The values of the last three names are equal to those of the first three multiplied by 100, which is clear enough if one notices that the first three contain the numbers from 1 to 10, and the last three the hundred from 100 to 1000, both groups being equally distributed into 4 + 3 + 3.

The value of the first half of the alphabet is the sum of those of the first four names: 10 + 18 + 27 + 140 = 195. Similarly, that of the second half is the sum of the last four names: 300 + 1000 + 1800 + 2700 = 5800. Finally, the total value of the entire alphabet is 195 + 5800 = 5995.

&quot;This number 5995 is remarkable for its symmetry: its central part is 99, the number of the &#x27;attributes&#x27; of Allah; the outside numbers form 55, the sum of the first ten numbers, the denary being in turn divisible into two halves (5 + 5 = 10); besides, 5 + 5 = 10 and 9 + 9 = 18 is the numerical value of the first two names&quot;. Connections with the general symbolism of &quot;al-Qutb al Ghawth&quot; [the Supreme Pole] are then contemplated.

===Conditions of corporeal existence===
The &quot;doctrine of five elements&quot;, which plays an important role in some Vedic texts, in Advaita Vedanta, Islamic esotericism, the Hebrew Kabbalah, in Christian Hermeticism, and other traditions, is partially exposed by René Guénon in two articles: one entitled &quot;The conditions of corporeal existence&quot;, published in 1912 in the journal &quot;La Gnose&quot; (Gnosis) (reprinted in the book &quot;Miscellanea&quot;) and another, published much later, in 1935: &quot;The Hindu doctrine of five elements&quot; (reprinted in the book &quot;Studies in Hinduism&quot;). A missing part of the first article was never published but René Guénon announced several times (&quot;The symbolism of the cross&quot;, &quot;The multiple states of the being&quot;) his intention to write a more complete study on this issue. Some aspects of the doctrine of five elements and conditions are used at many occurrences in all his work: in &quot;The symbolism of the cross&quot;, &quot;The principles of infinitesimal calculus&quot;, &quot;The Great Triad&quot; (on the vital condition), in the first two chapters of &quot;The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of the Times&quot; (on the notion of form) etc. However Guénon never wrote a comprehensive introduction to the subject, something that prompted comments from some authors.
In these two articles, he exposits the doctrine of elements and &quot;the conditions of corporeal existence&quot;, starting from the considerations taken from Samkhya of Kapila. The five elements or &quot;bhutas&quot; are the elementary substances of the corporeal world. The names given to them in the Latin language (&quot;fire&quot;, &quot;air&quot;, &quot;water&quot; etc.) are purely symbolic and they should not be confused with the things they designate: &quot;we could consider the elements as different vibratory modalities of physical matter, modalities under which it makes itself perceptible successively (in purely logical succession, naturally) to each of the senses of our corporeal modality&quot;. The five bhutas are, in their order of production (which is the reverse of their order of resorption or return to the undifferentiated state):
#âkâsha: ether,
#vâyu: air,
#têjas: fire,
#ap: water,
#prithvî, earth.

Due to the manifestation in our world of the duality &quot;essence-substance&quot;, these five bhutas are in correspondence with five &quot;elementary essences&quot; &quot;which are given the names &quot;tanmatras&quot; [...] signifying literally a &#x27;measure&#x27; or an &#x27;assignment&#x27; delimiting the proper domain of a certain quality or &#x27;quiddity&#x27; in the universal Existence. [...] these tanmatras, by the very fact that they are of subtle order, are in no way perceptibles to the senses, unlike the corporeal elements and their combinations; they are only conceivable &#x27;ideally&#x27;&quot;. These five essences are associated with the elementary sense qualities, as well as some organic faculties: auditive or sonorous quality shabda (शब्द), tangible sparśa (स्पर्श), visible rūpa (रूप) (&quot;with the double meaning of form and color&quot; ), sapid rasa (रस), olfactive gandha (गन्ध). There is a correspondence between the five elements and the five senses: to ether corresponds hearing (śrotra); to air, touch (tvak); to fire, sight (cakṣus); to water, taste (rasana); to earth, smell (ghrāṇa). &quot;Each bhuta, with the tanmatra to which it corresponds, and the faculties of sensation and action that proceed from the latter, is resorbed in the one immediately preceding it in the order of production in such a way that the order of resorption is as follows: first, earth (prithvî) with the olfactory quality (ghanda), the sense of smell (ghrāṇa), and the faculty of locomotion (pada); second, water (ap) with the sapid quality, the sense of taste (rasana), and the faculty of prehension (pani); third, fire (têjas) with the visual quality (rūpa), the sense of sight (cakṣus), and the faculty of excretion (payu); fourth, air (vâyu) with the tactile quality (sparśa), the sense of touch (tvak), and the faculty of generation (upashta); fifth, ether (âkâsha), with the sonorous quality (shabda), the sense of hearing (śrotra), and the faculty of speech (vach); and finally, at the last stage, the whole is resorbed in the &#x27;inner sense&#x27; (manas)&quot;.

The five bhutas combine with the five conditions of corporeal existence which are:
#space (linked to Vishnu in its expansion and &quot;stabilisation&quot; aspects),
#time (linked to Shiva in its &quot;transformation&quot; aspect -&#x27;the current of forms&#x27;-),
#matter (&quot;materia secunda&quot; i.e. quantity),
#form,
#life.

In the article &quot;The conditions of corporeal existence&quot; he develops, for the first two bhutas, how they are related to the measurement of time and space, and in &quot;The Hindu theory of the five elements&quot;, the predominance of the three gunas or essential qualities coextensive with the universal manifestation in each of them serves to define the geometric representation of the &quot;sphere of the elements&quot;.

===Classical atomism and the continuum===
&#x27;Naturalistic&#x27; tendencies never developed and took an extension in India as they did in Greece under the influence of physical philosophers. In particular, &quot;atomism&quot; (not in the modern sense of &quot;atoms&quot; and &quot;elementary particles&quot;, but in the classical signification related to the existence of indivisible items from which the entire corporeal world is supposedly built) is a conception formally opposed to the &quot;Veda&quot;, notably in connection with the theory of five elements. Classical atomism states that &quot;an atom, or &quot;anu&quot;, partakes, potentially at least, the nature of one or other of the elements, and it is from the grouping together of atoms of various kinds, under the action of a force said to be &#x27;non perceptible&#x27; or &quot;adrishta&quot; that all bodies are supposed to be formed&quot;. The error of atomism comes from the fact that these atoms are supposed to exist within the corporeal order whereas all that is bodily is necessarily composite &quot;being always divisible by the fact that it is extended, that is to say subject to the spatial condition&quot; (although in the corporeal domain, divisibility has necessarily its limits).

in order to find something simple or indivisible it is necessary to pass outside space, and therefore outside that special modality of manifestation which constitutes corporeal existence.
In its true sense of &#x27;indivisible&#x27; writes Guénon, an atom, having no parts, must be without extension, and &quot;the sum of elements devoid of extension can never form an extension&quot;, so that &quot;atoms&quot; cannot make up bodies. Guénon also reproduces an argument coming from Shankaracharya for the refutation of atomism:

two things can come into contact with one another either by a part of themselves or by the whole; for atoms, devoid as they are of parts, the first hypothesis is inadmissible; thus only the second hypothesis remains which amounts to saying that the aggregation of two atoms can only be realized by their coincidence [...] when it clearly follows that two atoms when joined occupy no more space than a single atom and so forth indefinitely.

The issue will be included in &quot;The principles of the infinitesimal calculus&quot; in relation to the concept of a whole understood as &quot;logically prior to its parts&quot; as well as in the &quot;conditions of corporeal existence&quot; and &quot;The symbolism of the cross&quot;.
In that latter book, he speaks of &quot;the elementary distance between two points&quot; and in &quot;The principles of infinitesimal calculus&quot; he states that the ends of a segment are no longer in the domain of extension. Applied to the corporeal world, this leads to introduce the &quot;limits of spatial possibility by which divisibility is conditioned&quot; and to consider the &quot;atoms&quot; not in the corporeal world (which is properly the concept designated as classical atomism). The process of &quot;quintuplication&quot; of the elements being universal and coextensive to the whole manifestation, a universalization is contemplated in &quot;The conditions of corporeal existence&quot;:

In particular and in relation to these matters, &quot;The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of the Times&quot; develops against the theories of Descartes about the nature of time.

==Symbolism==

While it is acknowledged that symbolism refers to something very different from a mere &#x27;code&#x27;, an artificial or arbitrary meaning, and that &quot;it holds an essential and spontaneous echoing power&quot;, for René Guénon, this &#x27;echoing power&#x27; goes immensely farther than the psychological realm: symbolism is &quot;the metaphysical language at its highest&quot;, capable of relating all degrees of universal Manifestation, and all the components of the Being as well: symbolism is the means by which man is capable of &quot;assenting&quot; orders of reality that escape, by their very nature, any description by ordinary language. This understanding of the profound nature of symbolism, writes René Guénon, has never been lost by an intellectual (i.e. spiritual) elite in the East. It is inherent in the transmission of initiation which, he says, gives the real key to man to penetrate the deeper meaning of the symbols; in this perspective, meditation on symbols (visual or heard, dhikr, repetition of the Divine Names) is an integral part both of initiation and of spiritual realization.

===Symbolism and analogy===

For René Guénon art is above all knowledge and understanding, rather than merely a matter of sensitivity. Similarly, the symbolism has a conceptual vastness &quot;not exclusive to a mathematical rigor&quot;: symbolism is before all a science, and it is based, in its most general signification on &quot;connections that exist between different levels of reality &quot;. And, in particular, the analogy itself, understood following a formula used in Hermeticism as the &quot;relation of what is down with what is above&quot; is likely to be symbolized: there are symbols of the analogy (but every symbol is not necessarily the expression of an analogy, because there are correspondences that are not analogical). The analogical relation essentially involves the consideration of an &quot;inverse direction of its two terms&quot;, and symbols of the analogy, which are generally built on the consideration of the primitive six-spoke wheel, also called the chrism in the Christian iconography, indicate clearly the consideration of these &quot;inverse directions&quot;; in the symbol of the Solomon&#x27;s seal, the two triangles in opposition represent two opposing ternaries, &quot;one of which is like a reflection or mirror image the other&quot; and &quot;this is where this symbol is an exact representation of analogy&quot;.

This consideration of a &quot;reverse meaning&quot; allows René Guénon to propose an explanation of some artistic depictions, such as that reported by Ananda Coomaraswamy in his study &quot;The inverted tree&quot;: some images of the &quot;World Tree&quot;, a symbol of universal Manifestation, represent the tree with its roots up and its branches down: the corresponding positions correspond to two complementary points of view that can be contemplated: point of view of the manifestation and of the Principle. This consideration of &quot;reverse meaning&quot; is one of the elements of a &quot;science of symbolism&quot; in which Guénon refers to, and used by him in many occasions. Thus, in his book &quot;The Great Triad&quot;, mainly dedicated to the explanation of some symbols belonging to Far Eastern tradition, the general symbols of &quot;Sky&quot; and &quot;Earth&quot; are linked, from the point of view of cyclical development, with the &quot;sphere&quot; and the &quot;cube&quot;, while their meeting point is identified with the &quot;skyline&quot; because &quot;it is on their periphery, or their most remote confines, that is to say, the horizon, that Sky and Earth are joining according to sensitive appearances&quot;; the consideration of the &quot;reverse meaning &quot; surfaces here in the reality symbolized by these appearances because &quot;following that reality, they unite on the contrary by the center&quot;. From there comes, according to Guénon, an explanation of the symbolism of the &quot;ventral side&quot; that Heaven presents to the &quot;cosmos&quot;, and correspondingly of the &quot;backbone&quot; side shown by the Earth. This symbolism explains the shape of the ancient Chinese currency, which are drilled in the center by the figure of a square (see picture). Similarly, among the symbols of &quot;Anima Mundi&quot;, one of the most common is the snake, which is often figured in the circular shape of the Ouroboros: &quot;this form is appropriate for the animic principle inasmuch as it is on the side of essence with respect to the corporeal world; but of course it is on the contrary on the side of substance with respect of the spiritual world, so that, depending on the point of view from which it is considered, it can take the attributes of essence or of substance, which gives it so to speak the appearance of a double nature&quot;.

===Symbolism and unity of traditional forms===
The importance of symbolism in the works of René Guénon arises because symbolism is, in his own words, &quot;the metaphysical language at its highest&quot;; it may be used to link concepts with different formulations in different traditions. Among many other examples found in his works, symbolism is used in &quot;The Great Triad&quot; to connect the &quot;Operation of the Holy Spirit&quot; in the generation of Jesus Christ to the &quot;non-acting&quot; activity of Purusha or &quot;Heaven&quot;, and Prakriti or the &quot;Universal Substance&quot; to Mary of Nazareth, Christ henceforth becoming identical, according to this symbolism, to the &quot;Universal Man&quot;. His book &quot;The Symbolism of the Cross&quot; also connects the symbol of the Cross with the data of Islamic esotericism.

Guénon was critical of modern interpretations regarding symbolism which often rested on naturalistic interpretations of the symbol in question which Guénon regarded as a case of the symbol of the thing being mistaken for the thing itself. He was also critical of the psychological interpretations found in the likes of Carl Jung.

===Symbolism and the primordial tradition===
In the East, writes René Guénon, symbolism is above all a matter of knowledge. He therefore devotes a substantial number of writings in an exhibition of traditional symbols. Most of these articles have been collected by Michel Valsan in the posthumous work &quot;Fundamentals symbols of Sacred Science&quot; which proposes, in a remarkable synthesis, numerous keys aimed at interpreting a considerable number of symbols, especially prehistoric symbols of the &quot;Center of the World&quot;, the Baetylus, the axial symbols, symbols of the heart, of cyclic manifestation etc. According to Guénon, the existence of identical symbols in different traditional forms, remote in time or space, would be a clue to a common intellectual and spiritual source whose origins dating back to the &quot;primordial Tradition&quot;.

== Contemporary &quot;neo-spiritualism&quot; ==
Guénon denounced the Theosophical Society, many pseudo-Masonic orders in the French and English occult scenes and the Spiritist movement. They formed the topic of two of his major books written in the 1920s, &quot;Theosophy: History of a Pseudo-Religion&quot; and &quot;The Spiritist Fallacy&quot;. He denounced the syncretic tendencies of many of these groups, along with the common Eurocentric misconceptions that accompanied their attempts to interpret Eastern doctrines. René Guénon especially develops some aspects of what he refers to as the manifestation of &quot;antitraditional&quot; currents in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. His first book on that subject is devoted to a detailed historical examination of Madame Blavatsky&#x27;s theosophy: &quot;Theosophy: History of a Pseudo-Religion&quot;. Guénon examines the role and intervention that played in that movement organizations that are described in more detail in &quot;The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of the Times&quot;, as under what he called the &quot;pseudo-initiation&quot;; in particular what he calls &quot;pseudo-Rosicrucian&quot; organizations holding no affiliation with the real authentic Rosicrucians, like the &quot;Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia&quot; founded in 1867 by Robert Wentworth Little, the &quot;Order of the esoteric Rose-Cross&quot; of Dr. Franz Hartmann etc. He denounces the syncretic nature of theosophy and its connection with the theory of evolution in &quot;The Secret Doctrine&quot; (Madame Blavastky&#x27;s main work); he also examines the role and relationship that the Theosophical Society had with multitude of &quot;pseudo-initiatic&quot; organizations, among others the O.T.O. founded in 1895 by Carl Kellner and propagated in 1905 by Theodor Reuss, and the Golden Dawn, to which belongs a large number of key figures of the Anglo-Saxon &quot;neo-spiritualism&quot; of the early twentieth century etc. Some authors have argued that Guénon&#x27;s analysis of Theosophy is flawed and that it is debatable whether Theosophy is really hostile to Islam and Christianity.

These are precisely some members of the &quot;inner circle&quot; of the H.B. of L., to which belonged Emma Hardinge Britten, who would have produced the phenomena giving rise to spiritist movement that is to say, another &quot;antitraditional&quot; current born in 1848. To support this assertion, he relies on statements from Emma Hardinge Britten herself, which will be confirmed much later, in 1985, by the publication from French publishing house &quot;Editions Archè&quot; of the documents of the H.B. of L. This organization would have received in part the legacy of other secret societies, including the &quot;Eulis Brotherhood&quot;, to which belonged Paschal Beverly Randolph, a character designated by René Guénon as &quot;very enigmatic&quot; who died in 1875. He denounces &quot;the confusion of the psychic and the spiritual&quot; and especially the psychoanalytic interpretation of symbols, including the Jungian branch of it, which he condemned with the greatest firmness, seeing in it the beginnings of a reversed – or at least distorted – interpretation of symbols. This aspect is reflected in some studies, especially in a book published in 1999 by Richard Noll who incidentally speaks of the role played by the Theosophical Society in Jung.

<text>Ellis Raymond &quot;Old Folks&quot; Kinder (July 26, 1914 – October 16, 1968) was an American Major League Baseball pitcher with the St. Louis Browns, Boston Red Sox, St. Louis Cardinals and the Chicago White Sox between 1946 and 1957. Kinder batted and threw right-handed. He was born in Atkins, Arkansas.

Despite making his MLB debut as a 31-year-old rookie, Kinder enjoyed a career which lasted over a decade. He is one of few pitchers in baseball history who won or saved a combined total of at least 200 games, and who were primarily starters for at least a third of their career.

Kinder was among the best starting pitchers in the American League in 1949, going 23–6 and leading the league in shutouts (6) and a .793 winning percentage, with a 130 adjusted ERA. In fact, Kinder&#x27;s ERA+ for his four years as a starter were 87, 117, 130 and 115. Then, in 1951, the Red Sox, desperate for a relief pitcher, moved him to the pen, where he shone as the best reliever in the AL until 1955.

In his 12-year career, Kinder compiled a 102–71 record with 749 strikeouts, a 3.43 ERA, 56 complete games, 10 shutouts, 102 saves, and 1479.2 innings pitched in 484 games.

On May 17, 1947, a seagull flew over Fenway Park and dropped a three-pound smelt on Kinder while he was pitching for the St. Louis Browns. Nevertheless, Kinder beat Boston 4–2.

Ellis Kinder died in Jackson, Tennessee, at the age of 54, after undergoing open-heart surgery.
