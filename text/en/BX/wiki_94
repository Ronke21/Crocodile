Their number, borders and functions have been changed several times. There are eight regions of Slovakia and they correspond to the EU&#x27;s NUTS 3 level of local administrative units. Each kraj consists of &quot;okresy&quot; (counties or districts), which are further divided into &quot;obce&quot; (municipalities). There are 79 districts.

== List ==
After a period without kraje and without any equivalent (1990–1996), the kraje were reintroduced in 1996. As for administrative division, Slovakia has been subdivided into 8 &quot;kraje&quot; since 24 July 1996:

Since 2002, Slovakia is divided into 8 &quot;samosprávne kraje&quot; (self-governing regions), which are called by the Constitution &quot;vyššie územné celky&quot; (Higher Territorial Units), abbr. VÚC. The territory and borders of the self-governing regions are identical with the territory and borders of the &quot;kraje&quot;. Therefore, the word &quot;kraj&quot; can be replaced by &quot;VÚC&quot; or &quot;samosprávny kraj&quot; in each case in the above list. The main difference is that organs of &quot;samosprávne kraje&quot; are self-governing, with an elected chairperson and 
assembly, while the organs of &quot;kraje&quot; are appointed by the government.

== Name ==
The term &quot;Region&quot; () should not be confused with:
* the general (i.e. non-administrative) term &quot;region&quot; () as it is used for example in the articles List of traditional regions of Slovakia or List of tourism regions of Slovakia
*the 4 &quot;regions&quot; ( or or ) that correspond to the NUTS 2 level, i.e. groups of several &quot;kraje&quot;, used by the Eurostat for statistical purposes. These are:
**Bratislava SK 01 (Bratislava Region)comprises only this single region
**Západné Slovensko SK 02 (Western Slovakia)Trnava, Trenčín and Nitra
**Stredné Slovensko SK 03 (Central Slovakia)Žilina and Banská Bystrica
**Východné Slovensko SK 04 (Eastern Slovakia)Prešov and Košice

== History ==

=== Prior to 1949 ===
Historically, Slovakia was not divided into kraje, but into counties ( or ). This was the case when present-day Slovakia was part of:
*Great Moravia (c. 9th century)
*Kingdom of Hungary (c. 11th/12th century1918)
*Czechoslovakia (the &quot;župy&quot; existed 19181928)
*the WWII Slovak Republic (the &quot;župy&quot; existed 19401945)

In 1928–1939 (and formally also 1945–1948) Slovakia as a whole formed the administrative unit &quot;Slovak land&quot; (&quot;Krajina slovenská&quot;) within Czechoslovakia.

=== 24 December 1948/1 January 1949 – 30 June 1960 ===
*Bratislavský kraj (Bratislava Region)
*Banskobystrický kraj (Banská Bystrica Region)
*Košický kraj (Košice Region)
*Nitriansky kraj (Nitra Region)
*Prešovský kraj (Prešov Region)
*Žilinský kraj (Žilina Region)

Each kraj was named after its principal city.

=== 1 July 1960 – 19 December 1990 ===
* Stredoslovenský kraj (Central Slovak Region)
* Východoslovenský kraj (Eastern Slovak Region)
* Západoslovenský kraj (Western Slovak Region)
* Bratislava (before 22 March 1968, part of the Západoslovenský kraj, afterwards a partly separate entity; from January 1971 a separate &quot;kraj&quot;)

Note: The &quot;kraje&quot; were abolished from 1 July 1969, until 28 December 1970, when they were reintroduced.

<doc id="689638" wikidata="Q4706829" url="?curid=689638" title="Alan Hart (television executive)">
<text>Alan Hart (17 April 1935 – 15 January 2021) was a British television executive, who from 1981 to 1984 was the controller of BBC One.

== Career ==
Hart&#x27;s initial career was in the BBC sports department as editor of &quot;Grandstand&quot; in the late 1960s and for much of the 1970s, and he rose through the ranks to become BBC head of sport in 1977. In 1981, BBC One controller Bill Cotton was promoted, and Hart was chosen to succeed him.

As channel controller, Hart was responsible for managing the direction, content and commissioning of programmes on the BBC&#x27;s premier television station. Hart greenlit the BBC&#x27;s first all-year round twice-weekly drama in modern times, &quot;EastEnders&quot;, which became a runaway success even though Hart had moved on by the time it began broadcasting in February 1985. One of Hart&#x27;s early decisions in the role was taking &quot;Doctor Who&quot; off its long-standing early Saturday evening slot, and giving it an early evening, twice-weekly slot, beginning in 1982. Hart also green-lit a 90-minute special to celebrate the show&#x27;s 20th anniversary, which became &quot;The Five Doctors&quot; and was broadcast as part of &quot;Children in Need&quot;.

Hart&#x27;s tenure as controller of BBC One was not generally regarded as one of the most successful in the BBC&#x27;s history, largely because of the huge success enjoyed by ITV drama during that period. In 1984, Hart was replaced by Michael Grade, who had expressed a desire to return from working in the US to work for the BBC, and Grade proceeded to radically overhaul the BBC&#x27;s main channel.

Hart died in January 2021 at the age of 85.

<doc id="689656" wikidata="Q4908586" url="?curid=689656" title="Bill Cotton">
<text>Sir William Frederick Cotton (23 April 1928 – 11 August 2008) was a British television producer and executive, and the son of dance band leader Billy Cotton. The television and radio presenter Fearne Cotton is related to him, as he was her paternal grandfather&#x27;s cousin.

==Early life==

Following a secondary education at the independent school Ardingly College, he joined the Royal Army Service Corps as a transport officer. He joined BBC Television as an in-house producer of light entertainment programmes in 1956, working on various programmes such as his father&#x27;s &quot;Billy Cotton Band Show&quot; and popular music programme &quot;Six-Five Special&quot;.

==Professional career==
In 1970, Cotton was promoted to head of light entertainment, following the death of Tom Sloan in May. In this position, Cotton was responsible for overseeing the production of a whole series of popular variety and light entertainment shows, including &quot;Jim&#x27;ll Fix It&quot; (1975–1994) &quot;The Morecambe and Wise Show&quot; (1968–77), &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; (1969–74), &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; (1971–87), &quot;Bruce Forsyth and the Generation Game&quot; (first run 1971–77), &quot;Look: Mike Yarwood&quot; (1971–76) and &quot;Parkinson&quot; (first run 1971–82). Cotton&#x27;s era was generally seen as the most eclectic in the history of BBC light entertainment, with programmes such as &quot;Morecambe and Wise&quot; becoming icons of British popular culture and drawing huge audiences, while the more subversive &quot;Monty Python&quot; provided a more cutting-edge, contemporary and daring complement.

Cotton&#x27;s success as head of light entertainment led to his promotion to controller of BBC1, the corporation&#x27;s premier and the UK&#x27;s oldest television station, in 1977. He oversaw some of the channel&#x27;s highest-ever audience figures in 1979, although this was mostly due to the main opposition, ITV, being on strike for over two months.

In 1981, he was replaced as controller of BBC1 by Alan Hart and made the BBC&#x27;s deputy managing director of television under Alasdair Milne. In 1984 Cotton was promoted to become managing director of television, a role he fulfilled until his retirement from the corporation in 1988. During this final period at the BBC he was involved with Michael Grade and Jonathan Powell in the attempted cancellation of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in 1985 after a run of 22 years on the BBC, a decision which became an 18-month hiatus following a tabloid backlash (the series wasn&#x27;t completely axed until 1989). Cotton subsequently did some freelance executive producing work in the light entertainment area and served as chairman of Noel Gay Television. He was deputy chairman of Meridian Broadcasting from 1992 to 1996, then chairman until 2001.

==Personal life==
In 1950, Cotton married Bernardine Maud (&quot;Boo&quot;; 1926–1964), daughter of Bernard Charles Henry Sinclair; they had three daughters. He married secondly, in 1965, makeup supervisor Ann Corfield Henderson, daughter of Lieutenant General Gerard Bucknall and former wife of Andrew V. Henderson. They had no children and divorced in 1989. He married thirdly, in 1990, Marie Curie Foundation homes officer Kathryn Mary (&quot;Kate&quot;), daughter of chief education officer Frederick Ralphs and former wife of David P. H. Burgess.

==Honours==

Cotton was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1976 New Year Honours, and promoted to Commander of the same order (CBE) in the 1989 Birthday Honours.

He received a BAFTA Fellowship in 1998, and was knighted in the 2001 Birthday Honours for services to Television Broadcasting and Marie Curie Cancer Care.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1995 when he was surprised by Michael Aspel at Castle Ashby in Northamptonshire. Guests included Paul Fox, Brian Tesler, Michael Grade, and Billy Marsh.

BBC Two broadcast an evening of programmes that he commissioned as part of a tribute night to him on Boxing Day 2008, including the &quot;Morecambe &amp; Wise Christmas Show&quot; of 1971, &quot;The Generation Game Christmas Show&quot; of 1973, and &quot;The Two Ronnies Old Fashioned Christmas Mystery of 1973&quot;. There was also a documentary about his career with Michael Grade, Bruce Forsyth, Michael Parkinson, Ronnie Corbett, Terry Wogan, and Paul Jackson among those paying tribute, in addition to this a two-part documentary about his life and career was broadcast on BBC Radio 2 on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2008 and New Year&#x27;s Day 2009 presented by Paul O&#x27;Grady.

==Portrayal==
Cotton was played by Michael Jibson in &quot;The Reckoning&quot; (2023).

<doc id="689657" wikidata="Q2533468" url="?curid=689657" title="Elections in the Netherlands">
<text>Elections in the Netherlands are held for five territorial levels of government: the European Union, the state, the twelve provinces, the 21 water boards and the 342 municipalities (and the three public bodies in the Caribbean Netherlands). Apart from elections, referendums were also held occasionally, but were removed from the law in 2018.

At the national level, legislative power is vested in the States General, which is bicameral. The House of Representatives has 150 members elected for a four-year term by proportional representation. Elections are also called after a dissolution of the House of Representatives. All elections are direct, except for the Senate, which has 75 members elected for a four-year term by provincial councillors on the basis of proportional representation at the provincial elections.

The Netherlands has a multi-party system, with numerous political parties, in which usually no one party ever secures an overall majority of votes (except occasionally in very small municipalities, such as Tubbergen), so that several parties must cooperate to form a coalition government. This usually includes the party supported by a plurality of voters, with only three exceptions since World War II, in 1971, 1977 and 1982, when the Labour Party (PvdA) was the largest party but did not take part in the coalition.

Candidates to the elections of the House of Representatives are chosen from party lists according to a system of party-list proportional representation. The threshold is 1/150th of the total number of valid votes.

During the municipal elections of 2006, elections were electronic throughout the country. As a result, results were known before the end of the day, a mere two hours after the closing of the poll stations. For the national elections in November of that same year, however, several polling stations decided to return to paper and red pencil because of security issues with the voting machines. Since then, most elections have been held using paper and pencil.

==Timing==
The maximum parliamentary term is five years and elections are generally held about four years after the previous one. Regular elections, i.e. after the House of Representatives has fulfilled its term, take place in March. If municipal or provincial elections already take place in March of that year, the parliamentary election is postponed to May. Elections are planned for spring to ensure that a new cabinet is formed in time to present its plans on the most important day in the Dutch Parliament, Prinsjesdag. If the House of Representatives is dissolved prematurely, due to a severe conflict between the House of Representatives and cabinet, or within the cabinet, a snap election takes place as soon as possible, usually after two months to give parties time to prepare. The term of the next House can be shortened or prolonged by almost a year to ensure the next normal election again takes place in March or May.

Municipal and provincial elections always take place every four years, in March; municipal elections always two years after a year divisible by four, and provincial elections one year after municipal elections. Municipal councils and provincial councils cannot be dissolved prematurely, so no snap elections can occur. An exception to the four-year term is made when two or more municipalities merge and a new election takes place for the merged municipality.

Senate elections also take place every four years, in May following the provincial elections. The Senate can be dissolved, and subsequently snap elections take place, but since the provincial councils remain the same, this seldom occurs. A Senate elected in a snap election sits out the remainder of its predecessor&#x27;s term.

Elections usually take place on Wednesdays, but the government can decide to change this to a Tuesday, Thursday or Friday if there are good reasons to do so (e.g. when the election day coincides with a national holiday). Elections for the European Parliament always take place on a Thursday.

==Eligibility==
Every Dutch citizen who has reached the age of 18 is eligible to vote (&quot;active suffrage&quot;) or to stand for election as a member of the House of Representatives (&quot;passive suffrage&quot;). A notable exception is municipal elections, in which persons younger than 18 can be elected, although they may not take their seat until their 18th birthday. Also, for the municipal election one does not have to be Dutch; residents who are citizens of another EU country are also eligible to vote, as well as citizens of other countries who have lived (legally) in the Netherlands for five years. Someone may be deprived of these rights if they are mentally incapable of making a reasoned choice or have lost their right to vote by court sentence. Two weeks before an election all voters receive a card, which is the evidence that they are entitled to vote, and this card must be handed over at the polling station before voting. Voting is not compulsory. Compulsory voting was introduced along with universal manhood suffrage in 1917, but it was abolished in 1967.

It is not necessary or even possible specifically to register as a voter for elections in the Netherlands: every resident inhabitant of the Netherlands is required to register as such with the municipality in which they are living, and this data (which includes their nationality and date of birth) is the basis from which the electoral register is derived.

Dutch citizens who live abroad (and have deregistered themselves as a Dutch resident) are allowed to vote for the House of Representatives and for the European Parliament, but not for municipal or provincial elections. They do need to register themselves as a voter.

==System==
The House of Representatives is elected using an open party list system of proportional representation.

==Election==


For all elections polling is organised on the basis of municipalities. In each municipality there are multiple voting stations, usually in communal buildings, such as churches, schools, and more recently, railway stations.

When arriving at a voting station, voters hand in their card or pass to one of the three attendants of the voting station, who checks the card, cancels it, issues ballot papers to the voter, and directs him or her to the polling booth.

Dutch citizens living abroad are able to vote by registering in advance and then using a postal vote. The results are counted by the municipality of The Hague and included in its own results.

For mayoral and provincial gubernatorial positions, the Netherlands is one of the few countries in Europe where no elections are held. Instead, they are appointed by the Crown, after recommendation by the municipal or provincial council respectively.

==Post-election==
Polls close at 21:00 and the votes are counted immediately. The preliminary results are generally known around midnight and announced the next morning, after which the 150 seats are allocated. However, recounting over the course of the following days sometimes throws up minor shifts in the allocation of seats.

===Seat assignment for general election===
The electorate in the Netherlands during the general election on the 22nd of November 2023 was 13,473,750, of whom 77.7% voted, resulting in 10,475,203 votes (of which 10,432,726 valid votes). With 150 seats, that means a quota of 69,552 votes per seat, the so-called Hare quota. Since the election threshold is equal to the quota, that is also the number of votes required to get one seat in the House of Representatives. However, the way residual seats are assigned, by using the D&#x27;Hondt method, a highest averages method, means that smaller parties are unlikely to get a residual seat, while larger parties have a bigger chance of getting one and may even get more than one.

For example, in 2003, the three biggest parties each got two of the six residual seats, even the VVD (150*0.179=26.85, but they got 28 seats, representing 18.7% of the seats instead of 17.9%), whereas the Socialist Party got none (150*0.063 = 9.45, but they got only 9 seats, representing 6% of the seats instead of 6.3%).

When the largest party gets over 35% of the votes and is considerably bigger than the next biggest party, that party may even get as much as 3 or even 4 residual seats. This has, however, never happened. The percentage of votes for the biggest party is usually around 30% and rarely goes far beyond that. The largest result ever was at the 1989 elections, when the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) got 35.3% of the votes. Even then, however, CDA only got two residual seats because next biggest party, the Labour Party (PvdA) had 31.9% of the votes. The biggest difference between the first and second party was at the 2002 elections, the most dramatic elections in Dutch history, when especially the PvdA lost many votes to the Pim Fortuyn List (LPF), which became second biggest after CDA with 17.0% of the votes. CDA, however, had received only 27.9% of the votes and was therefore still only assigned two residual seats.

Historically, parties had the option of forming an electoral alliance (), in which case they would participate in the above calculations as one party and therefore increase their chance of being assigned residual seats. The allocation of those seats among the parties within an electoral alliance was, however, done using the largest remainder method, which is more favourable toward smaller parties rather than the bigger ones if there is a considerable difference in size. But the overall advantage was greatest for small parties of comparable size. The option of forming an electoral alliance was abolished in 2017.

===Assigning people to seats===
After seats are allocated to the parties, candidates have to be assigned to the seats. For the purpose of general elections, the Netherlands is divided into twenty electoral districts. Parties can present different lists in each district. In theory, a party can place different candidates on each of the 20 different lists. However, it is usual that at least the candidate ranked first on the list is the same person throughout the country. It is even quite common that parties use the same list in every district, or vary only the last five candidates per district. Usually these five candidates are locally well known politicians, parties hope to attract extra votes with these candidates. However, because of their low position on the list, chances are low that these local candidates are elected.

The first step in the process of assigning people to the seats is calculating how many seats each of the different lists of a party gets, by adding the number of votes on each of the different lists together. If a party used the same list in more than one electoral district, these lists are seen as one list. Seat assignment to the different lists is done by using the largest remainder method.

The second step is calculating which candidate received on his or her own more votes than 25% of the electoral quota, by adding up all votes for a particular candidate on the different lists. These candidates are declared elected independent of the list order, and get one of the seats of the list where they received the most votes. If more candidates are elected on a list than the list received seats, the candidate with the lowest total number of votes is transferred to the list where he had his second best result.

As a third step, the remaining seats (if there are any) are assigned to the remaining candidates, based on their order on the list. When candidates are elected on more than one list in this way, the candidate gets the seat on the list where he or she received the most votes. This is continued until every seat is assigned. If one of these elected candidates later decides to leave parliament, then his seat is assigned to the next person on the list of the district he &#x27;represents&#x27;.

An exception to the above exists in the form of &quot;lijstduwer&quot; (&quot;list pushers&quot;), famous people (former politicians, but also sports people) who are put on the candidate list but will not accept a seat when they get enough votes for one. During the municipal elections in 2006 professor Joop van Holsteyn criticised this practise, saying someone on a candidate list should also be a serious candidate. This view is shared by other political scientists, but less so by politicians, who say that lijstduwers are on the list not to get elected but to show that they support that party and that the fact that they are at the bottom of the list makes it obvious they are not intended to get a seat. Still, writer Ronald Giphart (1998) and skater Hilbert van der Duim (1994) got a municipal council seat, which Giphart refused to fill. Professor Rudy Andeweg says this is close to fraud because the law requires someone on the candidate list to declare in writing to be willing to fill a seat.

==Other elections==

===Water boards===
Elections for the water boards have some similarities to other elections mentioned above, but also some distinctive differences. Similar to municipal elections, there are national parties and local parties, and the party list system is used with proportional representation. Residents of 18 and over can vote and elections take place every four years.

In contrast to other elections, not all members of the water board are chosen by the residents of the water board area. The members of each water board are divided into four categories: inhabitants, agriculture, nature and commercial. Only board members in the inhabitants category are chosen in direct elections, the members in the other categories are appointed by representing organisations, e.g. chambers of commerce in the commercial category. Since 2015, residents vote in person, just like in other elections, and they take place every four years, on the same day as the provincial elections. Before 2015, votes were cast by post, over a period of about two weeks.

===Island councils===
The elections for the Island councils for the special municipalities of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba take place at the same date as the provincial elections; for the first time in 2015.

==Latest elections==
===2024 European Parliament election===
===2023 general election===
Originally expected to take place in 2025, a snap election was called after the fourth Rutte cabinet collapsed on 7 July 2023 due to immigration policy disagreements between the coalition parties. The right-wing populist Party for Freedom (PVV), led by Geert Wilders, won 37 seats in the 150-seat House of Representatives, becoming the largest party for the first time. All four parties of the incumbent coalition government suffered losses.

===2023 Senate election===

The Senate is elected indirectly, by the provincial councillors (who are themselves chosen in direct elections) and (in Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba) the electoral colleges for the Senate.

===2023 provincial elections===

In the 2023 provincial elections, BBB won a plurality all provinces.

===2022 municipal elections===
==Next elections==
The next elections in the Netherlands are planned for (in chronological order):
*2026 Dutch municipal elections: 18 March 2026
*2027 Dutch provincial elections: 17 March 2027
*Next Dutch general election: 15 March 2028 (in absence of a snap election)

<doc id="689658" wikidata="Q17484900" url="?curid=689658" title="Outer Islands of Mauritius">
<text>The Outer Islands of Mauritius () is the first-level administrative divisions of the country and consists of the islands of Mauritius and several outlying islands. The Outer Islands of Mauritius are managed &quot;under the aegis&quot; of the Prime Minister of Mauritius through Prime Minister&#x27;s Office by the Outer Islands Development Corporation which is the authority empowered under the law to manage the Outer Islands of Mauritius. The Prime Minister is also Minister for Rodrigues, Outer Islands and Territorial Integrity. The Constitution of Mauritius states that the Republic of Mauritius includes the islands of Agaléga, Mauritius, Rodrigues, Saint Brandon (Cargados Carajos shoals), Tromelin Island, and the Chagos Archipelago (including Diego Garcia and other associated islands). The Government of Mauritius claims sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago, which the United Kingdom split from its territories to create the &quot;British Indian Ocean Territory&quot; before its independence in 1968. Additionally, France shares a sovereignty claim over Tromelin Island, an uninhabited island between Madagascar and Mauritius&#x27;s main island.

== Territory ==
The total area of the Republic of Mauritius is 2,040 km2 (excluding the Chagos Archipelago), making it the 169th largest country in the world by area. Mauritian territory also incorporates the island of Rodrigues, which is situated some 560 kilometers to the east and is 104 km2 in area. Rodrigues used to be the country&#x27;s tenth district, before it gained autonomous status in 2002. The two islands of Agaléga have a total land area of 2,600 hectares and are situated some 1,000 km to the north of Mauritius. Saint Brandon (Cargados Carajos) is situated some 430 km to the north-east of Mauritius; it is an archipelago comprising a number of sand banks, shoals, and islets. Just off the Mauritian coast lie some 49 tiny uninhabited islands and islets (see: Islets of Mauritius), some of which are used as natural reserves for the protection of endangered species.

The country&#x27;s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) covers about 2.3 million km2 of the Indian Ocean, including approximately 400,000 km2 jointly
managed with Seychelles. Four fishing banks fall within its EEZ limits: Hawkins Bank, Nazareth Bank, the Saya de Malha Bank, and the Soudan Banks (including East Soudan Bank). In 2011, the United Nations endorsed the joint submission of Mauritius and Seychelles to extend their continental shelf of 396,000 km2 in the Mascarene region which gives the two countries sovereign right to jointly manage and exploit the seabed and subsoil of the joint area.

<text>Bryan Cowgill (27 May 1927 – 14 July 2008) was a British television executive. He was Head of Sport for BBC Television from 1963 to 1973, Controller of BBC1 from 1973 to 1977, and Managing Director of Thames Television from 1977 to 1985.

==Early life==
Born in Clitheroe, Lancashire, Cowgill attended Clitheroe Royal Grammar School. After leaving school he became a copy boy with the &quot;Lancashire Evening Post&quot;, where his father was a printer. In 1943, he joined the Royal Marines, and during the next four years he saw service in Southeast Asia.

==Career==
After Cowgill was demobbed in 1947, he rejoined the &quot;Evening Post&quot; as a reporter and feature writer, and then for five years he edited a local weekly paper in Clitheroe. He joined the BBC in 1955 as a production assistant in Outside Broadcasting.

In 1958, Cowgill devised the Saturday afternoon sports showcase &quot;Grandstand&quot;, which was an immediate success and ran for nearly half a century. In 1963, he was promoted to Head of Sport. In this capacity, he introduced the football highlights programme &quot;Match of the Day&quot; in 1964. During his tenure the BBC covered an increasing number of ambitious sporting events, including organising extensive coverage as host broadcaster of the 1966 World Cup and showing coverage live by satellite from Mexico of both the 1968 Summer Olympics and 1970 World Cup.

In 1973, after a decade in charge of the sports department of BBC Television, Cowgill was promoted to Controller of BBC1, the corporation&#x27;s premier television network.

In 1977, Cowgill accepted an offer to leave the BBC after over twenty years to join Thames Television as Managing Director. In 1984, Cowgill, in a foretaste of changes to come within the industry, successfully resisted demands by the ACTT union for additional payments to use new technology, by maintaining a reduced service while the other ITV contractors met demands for a 20% rise in pay.

During Cowgill&#x27;s tenure at Thames he tried to acquire the popular 1980s soap opera &quot;Dallas&quot;, which had previously been associated with the BBC, abandoning a gentleman&#x27;s agreement not to poach purchased programming. Other ITV companies refused to show &quot;Dallas&quot; if Thames retained it, and this led to Cowgill&#x27;s resignation in 1985 at the age of 58.

Towards the end of his life, Cowgill argued for the abolition of the television licence that finances the BBC, asking &quot;in the context of more than 200 channels how can little green vans going up and down the country saying effectively: &#x27;What are you watching and have you got a licence to watch it?&#x27; survive?&quot;

Cowgill&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Mr Action Replay&quot;, was published in 2006.

<doc id="689675" wikidata="Q7150706" url="?curid=689675" title="Paul Fox (television executive)">
<text>Sir Paul Leonard Fox, (27 October 1925 – 8 April 2024) was a British television executive, who spent much of his broadcasting career working for BBC Television, most prominently as the Controller of BBC1 between 1967 and 1973.

==Early life==
Paul Leonard Fox was born on 27 October 1925, in Germany to Jewish parents. After the early death of his father, he came to the UK on a kindertransport in 1938. He was educated in Bournemouth and served in the Parachute Regiment from 1943 to 1946. Fox married, in 1948, Betty Nathan, who died in 2009. They had two sons one of whom, Jeremy, produced gameshows from his company Action Time. He was also the creator of The Krypton Factor.

==BBC career==
Fox began his career at the Corporation in the 1950s, writing scripts for the &quot;Television Newsreel&quot; programme before going on to create and edit the popular sports programme &quot;Sportsview&quot;. While editing &quot;Sportsview&quot; in 1954 he hit upon the idea of creating the annual BBC Sports Personality of the Year award, a glittering ceremony that is still held every December by the corporation and seen as one of the major events in British sport.

By the early 1960s he had been promoted to Editor of &quot;Panorama&quot; and later Head of Public Affairs at BBC Television and in this role was heavily involved in the news coverage of the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1963 and the subsequent reaction to the events in the UK.

In 1967, he became the Controller of BBC1, a post he held for six years, one of the longest tenures of any BBC Channel Controller. His achievements in the role included the launch of the enduring &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; and overseeing the transition of BBC1 into colour in 1969. He also commissioned &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot;, &quot;Bruce Forsyth and the&quot; &quot;Generation Game&quot; and the &quot;Parkinson&quot; talk show in 1971. All the Moon landings of Project Apollo occurred during his tenure, and Fox allocated generous time on his network for coverage.

==Later career and life==
Ward Thomas brought in Fox as Head of Programmes of Yorkshire Television (YTV) in 1973, and he went on to became managing director of Yorkshire Television between 1977 and 1988. During this period he was quite vocal in his disapproval of the ultimately unsuccessful poaching in 1985 of &quot;Dallas&quot; from the BBC by fellow ITV contractor Thames Television. This permanently soured his relationship with Thames executive Bryan Cowgill, who had been a former colleague at the BBC.

Whilst at YTV, Fox was prominent in representing the managerial view in the industrial dispute between members of the ACTT trade union and the ITV companies, which blacked out the network for three months in 1979. He was chairman of ITN from 1986 to 1988 and later managing director of BBC Television (1988–91). Fox retired from the BBC at the age of 65 in 1991 and became chairman of the Racecourse Association from 1993 to 1997, chairman of DISASTERS EMERC Committee from 1996 to 1999 and a sports columnist for &quot;The&quot; &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; from 1991 to 2003.

Fox died of complications from a stroke on 8 April 2024, at the age of 98.

==Honours==
Fox was honoured with a CBE in 1985 and was knighted in 1991. He was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) by Leeds University in 1984, and the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters (D.Litt.) from Bradford University in 1991, and the Royal Television Society Gold Medal for Outstanding Services to television in 1992.

<doc id="689682" wikidata="Q7291403" url="?curid=689682" title="Rancocas Creek">
<text>Rancocas Creek is a tributary of the Delaware River in southwestern New Jersey in the United States. The creek&#x27;s main stem is long, with a North Branch of and a South Branch flowing . The creek system drains a rural agricultural and forested area on the western edge of the Pinelands north and northeast of Camden and the New Jersey suburbs of Philadelphia.

==Overview==
Rancocas Creek rises as two main branches in the Pinelands National Reserve. The North Branch rises in northern Burlington County, in Mirror Lake, just south of Fort Dix. It flows west-northwest past Mount Holly.

The South Branch rises in central Burlington County near Chatsworth and flows generally northwest. It receives the Southwest Branch from the south approximately south of Mount Holly. The North and South branches join near Rancocas State Park, approximately west of Mount Holly, near the crossing of the New Jersey Turnpike and Interstate 295. A few hundred yards downstream of the Interstate 295 and New Jersey Turnpike bridges, Burlington County Route 635 passes over the Creek on a bridge built less than over the average water level, but this bridge has been closed for several years and was physically removed in its entirety in 2020/2021. This bridge had the capability for the center section of the bridge to swivel from the perpendicular to the river to parallel, to allow small boat traffic through. After rehabilitation of the bridge in the 1980s, the powered mechanism was removed due to the near-lack of creek barge traffic and the expense of maintenance. The bridge could be opened in case of emergency, but required manual labor to be swiveled open.

The creek is navigable for approximately upstream from its mouth on the Delaware.

<doc id="689685" wikidata="Q16250417" url="?curid=689685" title="403(b)">
<text>In the United States, a 403(b) plan is a U.S. tax-advantaged retirement savings plan available for public education organizations, some non-profit employers (only Internal Revenue Code 501(c)(3) organizations), cooperative hospital service organizations, and self-employed ministers in the United States. It has tax treatment similar to a 401(k) plan, especially after the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001. Both plans also require that distributions start at age 72 (according to the rules updated in 2020), known as Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs). Distributions are typically taxed as ordinary income.

Employee salary deferrals into a 403(b) plan are made before income tax is paid and allowed to grow tax-deferred until the money is taxed as income when withdrawn from the plan.

403(b) plans are also referred to as a tax-sheltered annuity (TSA) although since 1974 they no longer are restricted to an annuity form and participants can also invest in mutual funds.

== Regulation ==
The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) does not require 403(b) plans to be technically &quot;qualified&quot; plans (i.e., plans governed by U.S. Tax Code 401(a)), but 403(b) plans have the same general appearance as qualified plans. While the option is available it is not known how prevalent or if any 403(b) plan has been started or amended to be ERISA-qualified. This is because the main advantage of ERISA plans for participants has been in the event of bankruptcy of the account holder, but this advantage ceased to exist after the October 2007 Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act extended bankruptcy protection to 403(b) plans. While they are different in some fundamental ways, qualified and unqualified plans appear almost the same to the participant and the options available are very similar. The only important differences for the participants are some additional ways that they can withdraw employer money, not salary-deferral money, before the typical 59½ age restriction, but only if the plan is funded with annuities and not mutual funds. The federal government wants to eliminate this difference in proposed regulations expected to be finalized in 2007.

From a plan administration standpoint, 403(b) plans do not have many of the same technical difficulties that 401(k) plans do, such as discrimination testing, especially if the plan is not an ERISA plan. If the plan &quot;is&quot; an ERISA plan (the employer makes contributions to employee accounts) there are additional restrictions and administrative issues applicable to those employer contributions, but not if a plan of a government employer which is not subject to discrimination testing.

Salary-deferral contributions are not subject to discrimination testing. 403(b) plans are instead subject to universal availability which, briefly and in general, means all employees must be permitted to make salary-deferral contributions. 403(b) plans also have simpler and less costly annual reporting requirements on Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 5500, including not having the independent auditor requirement applicable to qualified plans with more than 100 plan participants.

== Compliance ==

On December 9, 2008, the IRS gave 403(b) plan sponsors a one-year reprieve for adopting a written plan document. While the relief provisions from the IRS give 403(b) sponsors a full year to adopt a written plan document, the plans still must operate in compliance with 403(b) plan requirements. If a person has taken a 403(b) plan and their age is less than 59½, then they cannot initiate an early withdrawal unless they can demonstrate a triggering event such as financial hardship, disability, or separation from service. In this event, the IRS will also charge a mandatory 10% in federal taxes, and it is additionally taxed as ordinary income.

== Bankruptcy protection before 2005 ==

Before the passage of the bankruptcy reform act in 2005, a 403(b) that was not an ERISA plan was not accorded protected status as property that could be claimed as exempt by the debtor under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In &quot;In re Barnes&quot;, 264 B.R. 415 (Bankr. E.D. Mich. 2001) Judge Spector held that the fixed-income annuity was not such a trust and could be reached by creditors. The variable account was held to fall within 541(c)(2) and was thus protected. Under the revised bankruptcy laws, 403(b) accounts, IRAs, and other retirement accounts are, in general, protected from creditors in bankruptcy.

For this reason, having an ERISA anti-alienation clause was protective of pensions before the bankruptcy law revisions, giving those pensions the same protection as a spendthrift trust. Some critics argued that this is disparate treatment of similar pension schemes and that more consistent protection was called for. The United States Congress took this argument to heart in the 2005 bankruptcy reform.

== After-tax contributions ==

Beginning in 2006, 403(b) and 401(k) plans may also include designated Roth contributions, i.e., after-tax contributions, which will allow tax-free withdrawals if certain requirements are met. Primarily, the designated Roth contributions have to be in the plan for at least five taxable years and you have to be at least 59 years of age.

==Church plans==
A church plan is a retirement plan established and maintained by a tax-exempt church, a convention of churches, or an association of churches for its employees. Church plans are not subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) unless it voluntarily makes an irrevocable election to be subject to ERISA.

A church plan may be a defined benefit plan, a defined contribution plan, or a deferred compensation plan.

A church plan that is not subject to ERISA is not required to file an IRS Form 5500, nor is it required to distribute summary annual reports, summary plan descriptions, or summaries of material modifications to plan participants. Church plans are generally subject to state law though. A defined benefit church plan is not required to pay subject to Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation plan termination insurance.

<text>Pyrénées National Park () is a French national park located within the departments of Hautes-Pyrénées and Pyrénées-Atlantiques. The park is located along the border of France and Spain along the Pyrenees Mountains, with a scenic landscape offering a variety of outdoor activities including hiking, skiing, mountain climbing and observing wildlife.

==Description==
Located in the Pyrenees mountains, Pyrenees National Park protects many limestone landforms, including karst valleys and caves. Repeated glaciations within the Quaternary created multiple cirques such as the immense Cirque de Gavarnie and large U-shaped valleys within the park. The limestone originated from the Cretaceous and Eocene periods. Tectonic uplift has created deep canyons, and, during the Quaternary, repeated glaciations carved cirques and large U-shaped valleys.

The park was created in 1967 as a natural heritage site without barriers or fences where animals are totally free. Devoted to preserving biodiversity and landscapes, as well as studying wildlife and plant species, the park is home to 70 different species of mammals. Threatened species found in the park include the lammergeier, Pyrenean desman, Pyrenean chamois, and capercaillie. A small population of bears also inhabit the park. At least 124 plant species have been observed within the national park, including 25 that are endemic to the Pyrenees mountains.

The eastern portion of the national park was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1997, forming part of the French section of the Pyrénées – Mont Perdu World Heritage Site that straddles the border between France and Spain. The park also borders on the Lacs de Carnau.

<text>A global title (GT) is an address used in the SCCP protocol for routing signaling messages on telecommunications networks. In theory, a global title is a unique address which refers to only one destination, though in practice destinations can change over time.

==Overview==
The global title is similar in purpose on the PSTN to the host name on the Internet. In design, however, global titles are quite different. The structure is usually hierarchical, the value can be of variable length, and is not necessarily a wholly numeric value—though it often is for issues of backward compatibility and association with regular telephone numbers.

==Structure of the global-title value==
The structure of a global title for ITU-T applications is officially defined in ITU-T Recommendation Q.713, and further extended in the supporting numbering plan standards. Other national variants of Signalling Connection Control Part (SCCP), such as the American National Standards Institute variant specified in ANSI T1.112/2000, define their own format for the Global Title. The value of a global title is a sequence of attributes which modify the address value. To summarize:

===Global title format===
A global title can be in a variety of formats, most of which are each defined in separate standards. The format parameter indicates which of the available formats are in use. Each format can include any of the subsequent parameters.

===Numbering plan indicator===
The numbering plan indicator (NPI) describes which numbering plan will be used for the global title. The chosen numbering plan will aid the routing system in determining the correct network system to direct the message.

===Type of number===
The type of number (TON) or Nature of Address Indicator (NAI) parameter, which is of relevance to E.164 (regular telephone) numbers for example, indicates the scope of the address value, such as whether it is an international number (i.e. including the country code), a &quot;national&quot; or domestic number (i.e. without country code), and other formats such as &quot;local&quot; format (e.g. in the U.S., without an area code).

===Translation type===
The translation type (TT) parameter is used in a network to indicate the preferred method of &quot;global title analysis&quot; (see below). Normally in European networks, this parameter is set to 0 (the default) value. In North American mobile networks, different translation types are used for analysis of the IMSI and for messages between telephone systems. This parameter is valuable in complex routing problems, where the same number has to be routed differently depending on the circumstances, such as those introduced by number portability resolution.

==Global title translation==
Global title translation (GTT) is the SS7 equivalent to IP routing. Translation examines the destination address (e.g. the number being called) and decides how to identify it over the telephone network. This process can include &quot;global title analysis&quot;, which is the act of looking up the number and finding a result address, and &quot;global title modification&quot;.

It is possible for the result of global title translation to be route on SSN. This means that, instead of the Global Title routing, lower level MTP routing will be used for this message from this point on. Equivalently, in a system using SS7 over IP (for example, SIGTRAN), the result from Global Title Translation may be to route to an IP server, though the exact details depend greatly on which variant of SS7 over IP is being used.

===Global title analysis===
The situation in this case is somewhat complicated by the additional parameters possible in the global title. Each set of parameter values (TT=0 NP=E.164, TON=INT) can be treated separately from each other one (TT=0 NP=E.214, TON=INT). This means that, instead of one single table, we potentially need a separate table for each possible set of values.

The variable length of the global title makes certain optimisations that can be used in IP routing not so easy to use here. The number analysis of a Global Title is most often done in a tree structure. This allows reasonably efficient analysis to any depth which is chosen.

In the end, global title analysis gives some result. The exact possibilities vary from system to system, is sometimes called an &quot;action&quot; or is integrated into the analysis table.

The &quot;destination&quot; would typically be given as a signalling point code in an MTP network, but could also be an IP system if we are using SS7 over IP.

===Routing structure===
The most commonly used numbering plans for global title routing are E.164 and E.214 (although E.212 is also common in America). These simply look like telephone numbers. That is to say, in the most common, international, variant there is a country code at the start of the number and a Network Code immediately following the &quot;country code&quot;. Beyond that is the &quot;subscriber number&quot; or &quot;mobile subscriber identity&quot; number, though even that may be divided into sections. This structure allows for the use of hierarchical routing:
* International SCCP gateways know which systems handle each of the other countries
* The international SCCP gateway belonging to each country knows which SCCP gateways handle each network
* The SCCP gateway of each network knows the network&#x27;s own internal structure

In America, the limitations of the North American Numbering Plan mean that the destination country is not immediately obvious from the called party address. However, the fact that there is unified administration means that this can be overcome by having complete analysis at every point where it is needed.

==Global title routing in mobile networks==
In mobile networks, there are database queries such as &quot;how can I tell if this subscriber is really who he says he is&quot; (MAP_Send_Authentication_Info) which have to be routed back to the database which holds the subscriber&#x27;s information (the home location register [HLR], or in this case, the authentication center [AuC]).

Unfortunately, at the time the subscriber first arrives, we don&#x27;t know which HLR is the subscriber&#x27;s HLR. For this reason, the queries have to be routed on the subscriber&#x27;s identity (IMSI) is used to generate the called party address in the message. How this is done depends whether we are in world area 1 (North America) or somewhere else.

There are three types of GT in use in mobile networks known as E.164 (MSISDN), E.212(IMSI) and E.214(MGT):

* E.164(MSISDN) = CC+NDC+SN - ( Country Code+National Destination Code+Subscriber Number) e.g. 91-98-71405178 
* E.212(IMSI) = MCC+MNC+MSIN - (Mobile Country Code+Mobile Network Code+Mobile Subscription Identification Number) e.g. 404-68-6600620186 (MTNL delhi) - 
* E.214(MGT) = combination of E.212 and E.164(CC+NDC+MSIN) (Exact combination is defined in the operators IR21 document)

===Mobile global title routing (except North America)===
Everywhere in the world, except North America, the subscriber&#x27;s IMSI is converted to a Mobile Global Title (MGT) E.214 number. See the entry about the IMSI for more details. The E.214 number has a structure which is similar to the E.164 number, and, except in a mobile network it can be routed identically. This means that the same routing tables can be used for both and means considerably reduced administrative overhead in maintaining the tables.

Once a signalling message with an E.214 number enters a mobile network in its own country, the routing is dependent on the operator of that mobile network. In networks without number portability, it is normal that the MSIN has a structure and that, by analysing the first few digits we can further route the message to the right element.

===IMSI routing (North America)===
In World Area 1 (corresponding to North America) ANSI SCCP is in use. In this case, due to North American standards, the routing of mobility related messages must be done with the E.212 number directly. This has the advantage that it is easier to identify to which country messages should be routed based on the mobile country code. The design of the North American Number Plan means that there is not a separate country code for each country in North America. Working with E.214 numbers would not be an insurmountable challenge, as can be seen from the fact that routing of phone calls using E.164 numbers is normal, but it would mean adding full E.164 routing tables to signalling transfer points where it has never been needed before.

<doc id="689706" wikidata="Q6833436" url="?curid=689706" title="Michael Peacock (television executive)">
<text>Ian Michael Peacock (14 September 1929 – 6 December 2019) was a British television executive, who from 1963 until the spring of 1965 was the first Controller of BBC2, the Corporation&#x27;s second television channel.

== Early life and career ==
Michael Peacock was born in Christchurch, Hampshire, on 14 September 1929. After graduating with an upper second class degree in sociology from the London School of Economics in 1952, he immediately joined BBC Television as a trainee producer, working under Grace Wyndham Goldie in the Television Talks Department, based at Alexandra Palace, which moved to the Lime Grove Studios the following year.

== Career ==
Peacock became the producer of &quot;Panorama&quot;, the Corporation&#x27;s first weekly TV current affairs series, in 1955, at the age of twenty-six. Under his editorship, with Richard Dimbleby as anchorman, the programme developed a high reputation, and during the Suez crisis in 1956 audiences reached 12 million viewers. Peacock was responsible for the April Fools&#x27; Day hoax which fooled many viewers into believing that spaghetti grew on trees.

He was appointed Assistant Head of Television Outside Broadcasts in 1958. The following year he returned to &quot;Panorama&quot;, where ratings had fallen badly. He recruited a new team of reporters including Robert Kee and James Mossman, and restored ratings to the 8–10 million level. Peacock and Donald Baverstock, with Ian Atkins, were given the daunting task in 1959 of preparing a report into ways to improve BBC Television News. Their recommendations were accepted in full, and in 1960 he was promoted to Editor of Television News, then based at Alexandra Palace. He remained in this post until 1963, when he was appointed Chief of Programmes (BBC2). His task was to lead the launch of the BBC&#x27;s second channel, which was due to begin transmissions in 625-line UHF in April 1964.

During the first year of BBC2 he oversaw the screening of some significant successes, such as &quot;Match of the Day&quot;, sitcom &quot;The Likely Lads&quot;, and 26-part documentary series &quot;The Great War&quot;, but audiences for the new channel were very small. In 1965, he was moved across to be Controller of the more mainstream BBC1, to which it was felt his talents would be more suited. Peacock is one of only three people (the others being Alan Yentob and Michael Jackson) to have been Controller of both channels.

Under Peacock, BBC1 reached the peak of one of its most successful eras. However, his time in the post was barely longer than his tenure at BBC2. This was because in 1967 he was head-hunted to be the first Managing Director of London Weekend Television, which began transmissions in 1968. However, his time at LWT was frustrated by union problems, conflict with the other ITV contractors who objected to the new company&#x27;s &#x27;high brow&#x27; London-centric programming and ratings which were lower than anticipated. He was fired by the company in 1969 and ten senior programme staff resigned in support, including several who had left the BBC with him.

In 1971 Peacock joined Warner Bros TV Ltd as MD in London, making co-productions with BBC TV and ITV. Perhaps his most successful was David Attenborough&#x27;s &quot;Life on Earth&quot;. He was a founding partner in Video Arts with Antony Jay, John Cleese and Peter Robinson which they formed to make training films for the world market. By the early 1980s Video Arts was the largest producer of training films in the world, with more than a hundred films in its catalogue. Peacock was invited to become Executive Vice President of Warner Bros TV Inc. in 1974, which meant moving with his family for two years to work in Burbank, California.

On his return to the UK he developed the TV side of Video Arts. He was chief executive of Video Arts TV, and when Milton Friedman chose VATV to produce his &quot;Free to Choose&quot; series Peacock was the executive producer, with Michael Latham his line producer.

He helped to found Manchester&#x27;s Piccadilly Radio in 1974, and was a director until 1987. He was chairman of Unique Broadcasting Co. from 1989, and of UBC Media Group plc until 1995.

<doc id="689731" wikidata="Q5294021" url="?curid=689731" title="Donald Baverstock">
<text>Donald Leighton Baverstock (18 January 1924 – 17 March 1995) was a British television producer and executive, born in Cardiff, Wales. He initially worked for BBC Television in their Talks Department, where he was the Editor of the topical magazine programme &quot;Highlight&quot; and then co-devised and edited its more ambitious and better-remembered successor &quot;Tonight&quot;, which began in 1957.

== Early life ==
Baverstock was born in Cardiff, Wales, United Kingdom, in January 1924.

== Career ==
Baverstock worked on &quot;Tonight&quot; until 1961, when he was promoted to be the BBC&#x27;s Assistant Controller of Programmes across the whole television service and suggested a programme of hymn-singing that led to the creation of &quot;Songs of Praise&quot;. In early 1963 he succeeded his superior Stuart Hood to become the Controller of Programmes for BBC1, in anticipation of the launch of the station&#x27;s companion BBC2 the following year. In the same year he requested Sydney Newman to develop a new Saturday evening show for BBC1 which would become &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

Soon after the launch of BBC2 in 1964, Controller Michael Peacock quickly began to run into difficulties, and BBC Director-General Hugh Greene decided in 1965 that the two men would be better suited to running each other&#x27;s channels, and took the decision to swap them over.

However, Baverstock felt insulted that he was being asked to take what he saw as a demotion to the lesser channel, and refused to take up his new post, instead resigning from the BBC altogether. He subsequently became involved in the establishment of the ITV northern franchise holder Yorkshire Television, becoming the company&#x27;s first Director of Programmes and overseeing the creation of popular hits such as the soap opera &quot;Emmerdale Farm&quot; (from 1972). Also in 1972, as ITV commissioned the broadcast of the first nationally televised darts tournament with the 1972 News of the World Darts Championship, Baverstock asked Sid Waddell to accompany presenter Peter Jones and commentator Dave Lanning at the 1972 News of the World Championship, to observe the action and to look into creating a programme based on indoor pub sports. The result of this was Waddell creating The Indoor League, which ran from 1972 to 1977, with the first season shown only in the Yorkshire Television region and the following seasons shown across Britain on the ITV network. The Indoor League was a crucial series in the early years of televised darts.

He left Yorkshire Television in June 1973, and briefly joined Granada plc in February 1974 as head of Granada Video Limited. In January 1975 it was announced that Baverstock had moved back to the BBC, as an executive producer within BBC Manchester, a position which he held until 1977. In 1978 Baverstock was part of a bid by Northumbria Television for the ITV franchise covering the Tyne Tees area, which was ultimately unsuccessful. In 1980 he was part of a similar franchise bid for the ITV Yorkshire franchise, part of a company called Television Yorkshire, which was also unsuccessful.

== Death and legacy ==
Despite being ensconced in Yorkshire, Baverstock did attempt to return to Wales, at one point applying for the vacant post of Controller of BBC Wales. He died in March 1995. Former colleague Leonard Miall claimed in Baverstock&#x27;s obituary in the &quot;Independent&quot; newspaper that the BBC Governors who interviewed him were &quot;put off&quot; by his &quot;casual behaviour&quot;. Another factor may have been that, although born in Wales, Baverstock did not speak Welsh – an attribute considered essential for anyone aspiring to become the Controller of BBC Wales.

In 2013 the BBC filmed a drama based around the creation and early days of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in 1963, as part of the celebrations for the fiftieth anniversary of the series. Baverstock appears as a character in the drama, &quot;An Adventure in Space and Time&quot;, portrayed by actor Mark Eden. The drama portrays Baverstock at one point wanting &quot;Doctor Who&quot; to be cancelled after only four episodes.

== Personal life ==
In 1957 Baverstock married Gillian Mary Waters, elder daughter of British children&#x27;s author Enid Blyton, at St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly. The couple divorced in 1994.

<doc id="689735" wikidata="Q241858" url="?curid=689735" title="Japanese aircraft carrier Shinano">
<text>was an aircraft carrier built by the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) during World War II, the largest such built up to that time. Laid down in May 1940 as the third of the s, &quot;Shinano&quot;″s partially complete hull was ordered to be converted to an aircraft carrier following Japan&#x27;s disastrous loss of four of its original six fleet carriers at the Battle of Midway in mid-1942. The advanced state of her construction prevented her conversion into a fleet carrier, so the IJN decided to convert her into a carrier that supported other carriers.

Her conversion was still not finished in November 1944 when she was ordered to sail from the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal to Kure Naval Base to complete fitting out and transfer a load of 50 Yokosuka MXY7 &quot;Ohka&quot; rocket-propelled &quot;kamikaze&quot; flying bombs. She was sunk en route, 10 days after commissioning, on 29 November 1944, by four torpedoes from the U.S. Navy submarine . Over a thousand sailors and civilians were rescued and 1,435 were lost, including her captain. She remains the largest ship ever sunk by a submarine.

==Design and description==
One of two additional &quot;Yamato&quot;-class battleships ordered as part of the 4th Naval Armaments Supplement Program of 1939, &quot;Shinano&quot; was named after the old province of Shinano, following the Japanese ship-naming conventions for battleships. She was laid down on 4 May 1940 at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal to a modified &quot;Yamato&quot;-class design: her armor would be thinner than that of the earlier ships, as it had proved to be thicker than it needed to be for the desired level of protection, and her heavy anti-aircraft (AA) guns would be the new 65-caliber 10 cm Type 98 dual-purpose gun, as it had superior ballistic characteristics and a higher rate of fire than the 40-caliber 12.7 cm Type 89 guns used by her half-sisters.

===Construction and conversion===
As with &quot;Shinano&quot;″s half-sisters and , the new ship&#x27;s existence was kept a closely guarded secret. A tall fence was erected on three sides of the graving dock, and those working on the conversion were confined to the yard compound. Serious punishment—up to and including death—awaited any worker who mentioned the new ship. As a result, &quot;Shinano&quot; was the only major warship built in the 20th century that was never officially photographed during its construction. The ship is only known to have been photographed on three occasions. The first photograph, taken by a Japanese aircraft in mid-October 1944, was intended to review the camouflage efforts made to conceal the carrier while in drydock. Later, on 1 November 1944, a Boeing B-29 Superfortress reconnaissance aircraft captured &quot;Shinano&quot; near the entrance of Yokosuka Harbor from an altitude of . Ten days later a civilian photographer aboard a harbor tug photographed &quot;Shinano&quot;″s initial sea trials in Tokyo Bay.

In December 1941, construction on &quot;Shinano&quot;″s hull was temporarily suspended to allow the IJN time to decide what to do with the ship. She was not expected to be completed until 1945, and the sinking of the British capital ships and by IJN bombers had called into question the viability of battleships in the war. The navy also wanted to make the large drydock in which the ship was being built available, which required either scrapping the portion already completed or finishing it enough to launch it and clear the drydock. The IJN decided on the latter, albeit with a reduced work force which was expected to be able to launch the ship in one year.

In the month following the disastrous loss of four fleet carriers at the June 1942 Battle of Midway, the IJN ordered the ship&#x27;s unfinished hull converted into an aircraft carrier. Her hull was only 45 percent complete by that time, with structural work complete up to the lower deck and most of her machinery installed. The main deck, lower side armor, and upper side armor around the ship&#x27;s magazines had been completely installed, and the forward barbettes for the main guns were also nearly finished. The navy decided that &quot;Shinano&quot; would become a heavily armored support carrier—carrying reserve aircraft, fuel and ordnance in support of other carriers—rather than a fleet carrier.

As completed, &quot;Shinano&quot; had a length of overall, a beam of and a draft of . She displaced at standard load, at normal load and at full load. &quot;Shinano&quot; was the heaviest aircraft carrier yet built, a record she held until the was launched in 1954. She was designed for a crew of 2,400 officers and enlisted men.

===Machinery===
&quot;Shinano&quot;″s machinery was identical to that of her half-sisters. The ships were fitted with four geared steam turbine sets with a total of , each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by 12 Kampon water-tube boilers. The ships had a designed speed of , but &quot;Shinano&quot; never conducted full-speed sea trials so her actual performance is unknown. She carried of fuel oil which gave her an estimated range of at .

===Flight deck and hangar===
&quot;Shinano&quot; was designed to load and fuel her aircraft on deck where it was safer for the ship; experiences in the Battles of Midway and the Coral Sea had demonstrated that the existing doctrine of fueling and arming their aircraft below decks was a real danger to the carriers if they were attacked while doing so. Much of &quot;Shinano&quot;″s hangar was left open for better ventilation, although steel shutters could close off most of the hangar sides if necessary. This also allowed ordnance or burning aircraft to be jettisoned into the sea, something that the earlier carriers could not do with their enclosed hangars.

The carrier&#x27;s flight deck was wide and overhung her hull at both ends, supported by pairs of pillars. A large island, modeled on that fitted on the earlier , was sponsoned off the starboard side and integrated with the ship&#x27;s funnel. Much like &quot;Taihō&quot;, the only other Japanese carrier with an armored flight deck, &quot;Shinano&quot;″s flight deck functioned as the ship&#x27;s strength deck and copied British practice as seen in their carriers. Designed to resist penetration by bombs dropped by a dive bomber, the flight deck consisted of of armor plate laid over of ordinary steel. It was equipped with 15 transverse arrestor wires and three crash barriers that could stop a aircraft; five of these wires were positioned further forward to allow the ship to land aircraft over the bow in case the aft portion of the flight deck was unusable.

Unlike the British carriers, &quot;Taihō&quot; and &quot;Shinano&quot; had unarmored sides to their hangars. For stability reasons, the latter only had a single hangar that was , with a minimum width of aft, and had a height of . The forward area of the hangar was dedicated to maintenance and storage facilities. Aircraft were transported between the hangar and the flight deck by two elevators, one at each end of the hangar on the centerline of the flight deck. The larger of the two measured . They were capable of lifting aircraft weighing up to . The ship had an aviation gasoline (avgas) capacity of . Because &quot;Taihō&quot; had been sunk by an explosion of gasoline fumes, large ventilation fans were installed on the hangar deck to expel fumes in case of damage to the gasoline system. Canvas wind scoops could also be rigged over the elevator opening to force more air inside.

The ship&#x27;s organic air group was intended to consist of 18 Mitsubishi A7M &quot;Reppū&quot; (Allied reporting name &quot;Sam&quot;) fighters (plus two in storage), 18 Aichi B7A &quot;Ryusei&quot; (&quot;Grace&quot;) torpedo-dive bombers (plus two in storage), and 6 Nakajima C6N &quot;Saiun&quot; (&quot;Myrt&quot;) reconnaissance aircraft (plus one in storage). The remainder of the hangar space would have held up to 120 replacement aircraft for other carriers and land bases. The steel flight deck was covered with a thin, shock-absorbent latex-sawdust compound.

===Armament===
&quot;Shinano&quot;″s primary armament consisted of sixteen 40-caliber Type 89 dual-purpose guns in eight twin mounts, two at each corner of the hull. When firing at surface targets, the guns had a range of ; they had a maximum ceiling of at their maximum elevation of 90 degrees. Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute; their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute.

The ship also carried 105 Type 96 25 mm (1 in) light AA guns in 35 triple-gun mounts. These guns had an effective range of , and an effective ceiling of at an elevation of +85 degrees. The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of the frequent need to change the fifteen-round magazines. This was the standard Japanese light AA gun during World War II, but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it largely ineffective. According to historian Mark Stille, the weapon had many faults including an inability to &quot;handle high-speed targets because it could not be trained or elevated fast enough by either hand or power, its sights were inadequate for high-speed targets, it possessed excessive vibration and muzzle blast&quot;... These guns were supplemented by a dozen 28-round AA rocket launchers. Each rocket weighed and had a maximum velocity of . Their maximum range was .

Four Type 94 high-angle fire-control directors were fitted to control the Type 89 guns. The two controlling the port-side guns were adjacent to their guns while the starboard directors were mounted fore and aft on the island. They could control all of the forward and rear guns respectively as necessary. Type 22 and Type 13 air search radars may have been fitted.

===Armor===
The ship&#x27;s original waterline armor belt thickness of was retained only where it had already been installed abreast the magazines, and reduced to elsewhere. Below it was a strake of armor that tapered in thickness from to 75 millimeters at its bottom edge. The flat portion of the armor deck over the machinery and magazine spaces, ranging from , was retained, and the sloped portion that angled downward towards the bottom of the main armor belt was thick. Large external anti-torpedo bulges below the waterline provided the main defense against torpedoes, backed up by an armored bulkhead extending down from the belt armor; the bulkhead was intended to prevent splinters from piercing the main hull and, though not watertight, was backed by a second one which was. The joint between the upper and lower armor belts was weak and proved to be a serious problem when struck by torpedoes.

Even though &quot;Shinano&quot;″s avgas tanks were protected by armor that could resist a shell, the IJN attempted to isolate the tanks from the rest of the ship with a cofferdam. However the investigation into the loss of &quot;Taihō&quot; had revealed that her avgas tanks had sprung leaks after she was torpedoed. The resulting fumes then penetrated the cofferdam and exploded. Therefore, the IJN thought it prudent to fill the empty spaces between the tanks and the cofferdam with of concrete to prevent any fumes from escaping.

===Launching===

The ship was originally scheduled for completion in April 1945, but construction was expedited after the defeat at the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944 as the IJN anticipated that the United States would now be able to bomb Japan with long-range aircraft from bases in the Mariana Islands. The builder was unable to increase the number of workers on &quot;Shinano&quot; and could not meet the new deadline of October. Even so, the pressure to finish as quickly as possible led to poor workmanship by the workforce.

&quot;Shinano&quot;″s launch on 8 October 1944, with Captain in command, was marred by what some considered an ill-omened accident. During the floating-out procedure, one of the caissons at the end of the dock that had not been properly ballasted with seawater unexpectedly lifted as the water rose to the level of the harbor. The sudden inrush of water into the graving dock pushed the carrier into the forward end, damaging the bow structure below the waterline and requiring repairs in drydock. These were completed by 26 October.

==Commissioning and sinking==

===Departure from Yokosuka===

On 19 November 1944, &quot;Shinano&quot; was formally commissioned at Yokosuka, having spent the previous two weeks fitting out and performing sea trials. On the same exact day, a B-29 bomber observed Yokosuka and photographed the base, producing one of only three known pictures of &quot;Shinano&quot;. Worried about her safety after the fly-over, the Navy General Staff ordered &quot;Shinano&quot; to depart for Kure by no later than 28 November, where the remainder of her fitting-out would take place. Abe asked for a delay in the sailing date as the majority of her watertight doors had yet to be installed, the compartment air tests had not been conducted, and many holes in the compartment bulkheads for electrical cables, ventilation ducts and pipes had not been sealed. Importantly, fire mains and bailing systems lacked pumps and were inoperable; even though most of the crew had sea-going experience, they lacked training in the portable pumps on board. The escorting destroyers, , and , had just returned from the Battle of Leyte Gulf and required more than three days to conduct repairs and to allow their crews to recuperate.

Abe&#x27;s request was denied, and &quot;Shinano&quot; departed as scheduled with the escorting destroyers at 18:00 on 28 November. Abe commanded a crew of 2,175 officers and men. Also on board were 300 shipyard workers and 40 civilian employees. Watertight doors and hatches were left open for ease of access to machinery spaces, as were some manholes in the double and triple-bottomed hull. Abe preferred a daylight passage, since it would have allowed him extra time to train his crew and given the destroyer crews time to rest. However, he was forced to make a nighttime run when he learned the Navy General Staff could not provide air support. &quot;Shinano&quot; carried six &quot;Shinyo&quot; suicide boats, and 50 &quot;Ohka&quot; suicide flying bombs; her other aircraft were not planned to come aboard until later. Her orders were to go to Kure, where she would complete fitting out and then deliver the &quot;kamikaze&quot; craft to the Philippines and Okinawa. Traveling at an average speed of , she needed sixteen hours to cover the 300 miles (480 km) to Kure. As a measure of how important &quot;Shinano&quot; was to the naval command, Abe was slated for promotion to rear admiral once the fitting-out was complete.

===Attacked===

At 20:48, the American submarine , commanded by Commander Joseph F. Enright, detected &quot;Shinano&quot; and her escorts on her radar and pursued them on a parallel course. Over an hour and a half earlier, &quot;Shinano&quot; had detected the submarine&#x27;s radar. Normally, &quot;Shinano&quot; would have been able to outrun &quot;Archerfish&quot;, but the zig-zagging movement of the carrier and her escorts—intended to evade any American submarines in the area—inadvertently turned the task group back into the &quot;Archerfish&quot;&#x27;s path on several occasions. At 22:45, the carrier&#x27;s lookouts spotted &quot;Archerfish&quot; on the surface, and &quot;Isokaze&quot; broke formation, against orders, to investigate. Abe ordered the destroyer to return to the formation without attacking because he believed that the submarine was part of an American wolfpack. He assumed &quot;Archerfish&quot; was being used as a decoy to lure away one of the escorts to allow the rest of the pack a clear shot at &quot;Shinano&quot;. He ordered his ships to turn away from the submarine with the expectation of outrunning it, counting on his margin of speed over the submarine. Around 23:22, the carrier was forced to reduce speed to , the same speed as &quot;Archerfish&quot;, to prevent damage to the propeller shaft when a bearing overheated.
At 02:56 on 29 November, &quot;Shinano&quot; turned to the southwest and headed straight for &quot;Archerfish&quot;. Eight minutes later, &quot;Archerfish&quot; turned east and submerged in preparation to attack. Enright ordered his torpedoes set for a depth of in case they ran deeper than set; he also intended to increase the chances of capsizing the ship by punching holes higher up in the hull. A few minutes later, &quot;Shinano&quot; turned south, exposing her entire side to &quot;Archerfish&quot;—a nearly ideal firing situation for a submarine. The escorting destroyer on that side passed right over &quot;Archerfish&quot; without detecting her. At 03:15 &quot;Archerfish&quot; fired six torpedoes before diving to to escape a depth charge attack from the escorts.

Four torpedoes struck &quot;Shinano&quot;, at an average depth of . The first hit towards the stern, flooding refrigerated storage compartments and one of the empty aviation gasoline storage tanks and killing many of the sleeping engineering personnel in the compartments above. The second hit the compartment where the starboard outboard propeller shaft entered the hull and flooded the outboard engine room. The third hit further forward, flooding the No. 3 boiler room and killing every man on watch. Structural failures caused the two adjacent boiler rooms to flood as well. The fourth flooded the starboard air compressor room, adjacent anti-aircraft gun magazines, and the No. 2 damage control station and ruptured the adjacent oil tank.

===Sinking===
Though severe, the damage to &quot;Shinano&quot; was at first judged to be manageable. The crew were confident in the ship&#x27;s armor and strength, which translated into lax initial efforts to save the ship. This overconfidence extended to Abe. He doubted the sub&#x27;s torpedoes could inflict serious damage, since he knew that American torpedoes were less potent than Japanese torpedoes. He ordered the carrier to maintain its maximum speed even after the last torpedo hit. This pushed more water through the holes in the hull resulting in extensive flooding. Within a few minutes the ship was listing 10 degrees to starboard. Despite the crew pumping of water into the port bilges, the list increased to 13 degrees. When it became apparent the damage was more severe than first thought, Abe ordered a change of course towards Shiono Point, the southernmost tip of Honshu&#x27;s Kii Peninsula. Progressively increasing flooding increased the list to 15 degrees by 03:30. Fifty minutes later, Abe ordered the empty port outboard tanks to be counter-flooded, reducing the list to 12 degrees for a brief time. After 05:00 he ordered the civilian workers to be transferred to the escorts as they were impeding the crew in their duties.

A half-hour later, &quot;Shinano&quot; was making 10 knots with a 13-degree list. At 06:00 her list had increased to 20 degrees after the starboard boiler room flooded, at which point the valves of the port trimming tanks rose above the waterline and became ineffective. The engines shut down for lack of steam around 07:00, and Abe ordered all of the propulsion compartments evacuated an hour later. He then ordered the three outboard port boiler rooms flooded in a futile attempt to reduce the carrier&#x27;s list. He also ordered &quot;Hamakaze&quot; and &quot;Isokaze&quot; to take her in tow. However, the two destroyers displaced only between them, about one-fourteenth of &quot;Shinano&quot;″s displacement and not nearly enough to overcome her deadweight. The first tow cables snapped under the strain and the second attempt was aborted for fear of injury to the crews if they snapped again. The ship lost all power around 09:00 and was now listing over 20 degrees. At 10:18, Abe released the crew to save themselves, refusing to issue any orders to abandon ship; by this time &quot;Shinano&quot; had a list of 30 degrees. As she heeled water flowed into the open elevator well on her flight deck, sucking many swimming sailors back into the ship as she sank. A large exhaust vent below the flight deck also sucked many other sailors into the ship as she submerged.

At 10:57 &quot;Shinano&quot; finally capsized and sank stern-first at coordinates (), from the nearest land, in approximately of water, taking 1,435 officers, men and civilians to their deaths. The dead included Abe and both of his navigators, who chose to go down with the ship. Rescued were 55 officers and 993 petty officers and enlisted men, plus 32 civilians for a total of 1,080 survivors. After their rescue, the survivors were isolated on the island of Mitsuko-jima until January 1945 to suppress the news of the carrier&#x27;s loss. The carrier was formally struck from the Naval Register on 31 August.

US Naval Intelligence did not initially believe Enright&#x27;s claim to have sunk a carrier. &quot;Shinano&quot;″s construction had not been detected through decoded radio messages or other means, and the American analysts believed that they had located all of Japan&#x27;s surviving carriers, even though a captured Japanese aviator had revealed in July 1943 that a third &quot;Yamato&quot;-class battleship was being converted into a carrier. Enright was eventually credited with sinking a &quot;Hayatake&quot; () carrier by the acting commander of the Pacific Fleet&#x27;s submarine force on the basis of a drawing Enright submitted depicting the ship he had attacked. Once the existence of &quot;Shinano&quot; was discovered, Enright was credited with her sinking and awarded the Navy Cross.

==Post-war analysis of the sinking==
Post-war analysis by the U.S. Naval Technical Mission to Japan noted that &quot;Shinano&quot; had serious design flaws. Specifically, the joint between the waterline armor belt on the upper hull and the anti-torpedo bulge on the underwater portion was poorly designed, a trait shared by the &quot;Yamato&quot;-class battleships; &quot;Archerfish&quot;″s torpedoes all exploded along this joint. The force of the torpedo explosions also dislodged an I-beam in one of the boiler rooms, which punched a hole into another boiler room. In addition, the failure to test for watertightness in each compartment played a role as potential leaks could not be found and patched before &quot;Shinano&quot; put to sea. The executive officer blamed the large amount of water that entered the ship on the failure to air-test the compartments for leaks. He reported hearing air rushing through gaps in the watertight doors just minutes after the last torpedo hit—a sign that seawater was rapidly entering the ship, proving the doors were unseaworthy.

<text>Tutti is an Italian word literally meaning &quot;all&quot; or &quot;together&quot; and is used as a musical term, for the whole orchestra as opposed to the soloist. It is applied similarly to choral music, where the whole section or choir is called to sing. Music examination boards may instruct candidates to &quot;play in tuttis&quot;, indicating that the candidate should play both the solo and the tutti sections.

An orchestrator may specify that a section leader (e.g., the principal violinist) plays alone, while the rest of the section is silent for the duration of the solo passage, by writing &quot;solo&quot; in the music at the point where it begins and &quot;tutti&quot; at the point where the rest of the section should resume playing.

In organ music, it indicates that the full organ should be used: all stops and all couplers. Some organ consoles offer a toe stud or piston to toggle the tutti: pressing once activates all stops (although it does not physically move the stop knobs), and pressing again reverts to the previous registration.

<text>In geometry, a cupola is a solid formed by joining two polygons, one (the base) with twice as many edges as the other, by an alternating band of isosceles triangles and rectangles. If the triangles are equilateral and the rectangles are squares, while the base and its opposite face are regular polygons, the triangular, square, and pentagonal cupolae all count among the Johnson solids, and can be formed by taking sections of the cuboctahedron, rhombicuboctahedron, and rhombicosidodecahedron, respectively.

A cupola can be seen as a prism where one of the polygons has been collapsed in half by merging alternate vertices.

A cupola can be given an extended Schläfli symbol representing a regular polygon joined by a parallel of its truncation, or 

Cupolae are a subclass of the prismatoids.

Its dual contains a shape that is sort of a weld between half of an -sided trapezohedron and a -sided pyramid.

==Examples==

The triangular, square, and pentagonal cupolae are the only non-trivial convex cupolae with regular faces: The &quot;hexagonal cupola&quot; is a plane figure, and the triangular prism might be considered a &quot;cupola&quot; of degree 2 (the cupola of a line segment and a square). However, cupolae of higher-degree polygons may be constructed with irregular triangular and rectangular faces.

==Coordinates of the vertices==

The definition of the cupola does not require the base (or the side opposite the base, which can be called the top) to be a regular polygon, but it is convenient to consider the case where the cupola has its maximal symmetry, . In that case, the top is a regular -gon, while the base is either a regular -gon or a -gon which has two different side lengths alternating and the same angles as a regular -gon. It is convenient to fix the coordinate system so that the base lies in the -plane, with the top in a plane parallel to the -plane. The -axis is the -fold axis, and the mirror planes pass through the -axis and bisect the sides of the base. They also either bisect the sides or the angles of the top polygon, or both. (If is even, half of the mirror planes bisect the sides of the top polygon and half bisect the angles, while if is odd, each mirror plane bisects one side and one angle of the top polygon.) The vertices of the base can be designated through while the vertices of the top polygon can be designated through With these conventions, the coordinates of the vertices can be written as:
formula_1

for .

Since the polygons etc. are rectangles, this puts a constraint on the values of The distance formula_2 is equal to
formula_3

while the distance formula_4 is equal to
formula_5

These are to be equal, and if this common edge is denoted by ,
formula_6

These values are to be inserted into the expressions for the coordinates of the vertices given earlier.

== Star-cupolae ==
Star cupolae exist for any top base where and is odd. At these limits, the cupolae collapse into plane figures. Beyond these limits, the triangles and squares can no longer span the distance between the two base polygons (it can still be made with non-equilateral isosceles triangles and non-square rectangles). If is even, the bottom base becomes degenerate; then we can form a &quot;cupoloid&quot; or &quot;semicupola&quot; by withdrawing this degenerate face and letting the triangles and squares connect to each other here (through single edges) rather than to the late bottom base (through its double edges). In particular, the tetrahemihexahedron may be seen as a -cupoloid.

The cupolae are all orientable, while the cupoloids are all non-orientable. For a cupoloid, if , then the triangles and squares do not cover the entire (single) base, and a small membrane is placed in this base -gon that simply covers empty space. Hence the - and -cupoloids pictured above have membranes (not filled in), while the - and -cupoloids pictured above do not.

The height of an -cupola or cupoloid is given by the formula:
formula_7
In particular, at the limits and , and is maximized at (in the digonal cupola: the triangular prism, where the triangles are upright).

In the images above, the star cupolae have been given a consistent colour scheme to aid identifying their faces: the base -gon is red, the base -gon is yellow, the squares are blue, and the triangles are green. The cupoloids have the base -gon red, the squares yellow, and the triangles blue, as the base -gon has been withdrawn.

==Hypercupolae==
The hypercupolae or polyhedral cupolae are a family of convex nonuniform polychora (here four-dimensional figures), analogous to the cupolas. Each one&#x27;s bases are a Platonic solid and its expansion.

<text>Emmanuel &quot;Rico&quot; Rodriguez (17 October 1934 – 4 September 2015), also known as Rico, Reco or El Reco, was a Cuban-born Jamaican ska and reggae trombonist. He recorded with producers such as Karl Pitterson, Prince Buster, and Lloyd Daley. He was known as one of the first ska musicians. Beginning in the 1960s, he worked with the Members, the Specials, Jools Holland, and Paul Young.

== Career ==
Rodriguez was born in Havana, Cuba, and at an early age moved with his family to Jamaica. He grew up there in Kingston, and was taught to play the trombone by his slightly older schoolmate Don Drummond at the Alpha Boys School. In the 1950s, Rodriguez became a Rastafarian and was closely associated musically to the rasta drummer Count Ossie. 

In 1961, Rodriguez moved to the UK, where he joined live bands such as Georgie Fame&#x27;s Blue Flames and started to play in reggae bands. Rodriguez also began recording with his own band, Rico&#x27;s All Stars, and later formed the group Rico and the Rudies, recording the 1969 albums &quot;Blow Your Horn&quot; and &quot;Brixton Cat&quot;. In 1976, he recorded the album &quot;Man from Wareika&quot; under a contract with Island Records. In the late 1970s, he recorded a song called &quot;Offshore Banking Business&quot; with the Members and with the arrival of the 2 tone genre, he played with ska revival bands such as the Specials including their single &quot;A Message to You, Rudy&quot;.

Rodriguez is mentioned in the Ian Dury and the Blockheads song &quot;Reasons to Be Cheerful, Part 3&quot;. The song was released just months before Rico joined the Specials.

In 1982, he returned to Jamaica to retire from performing professionally; however, in 1987 he returned to tour with the Heart Beat Band, and between 1992 and 1995 he would also play with Jazz Jamaica, as well as with Linton Kwesi Johnson during this era.

In 1995, Island Records released the album &quot;Roots to the Bone&quot;, an updated version of Rodriguez&#x27;s earlier work &quot;Man from Wareika&quot;. From 1996, among other engagements, he played with Jools Holland&#x27;s Rhythm and Blues Orchestra and also performed at various ska festivals throughout Europe with his own band. He retired from performing with Jools Holland in 2012.

He was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2007 New Year Honours, for services to music. In October 2012, he was awarded the Silver Musgrave Medal by the Institute of Jamaica in recognition of his contribution to Jamaican music.

==Death==
On 4 September 2015, following a short illness in a London hospital, Rodriguez died aged 80. A tribute to him by Youthsayers alongside Jerry Dammers was performed at the Lambeth Country Show in 2016 to a crowd of 80,000.

<text>Sanhattan, a portmanteau of &quot;Santiago&quot; and &quot;Manhattan&quot;, is the popular ironic sobriquet given to Santiago&#x27;s upscale financial district in Chile&#x27;s capital. It is located to the northeast of the metropolis, in the western end of the Las Condes commune, nestled between the Mapocho River and Américo Vespucio avenue, encompassing the El Bosque Norte and El Golf barrios. A more narrow definition places it between the intersection of Andrés Bello and Vitacura avenues down to Nueva Los Leones avenue. The central street in Sanhattan is Avenida Apoquindo.

Sanhattan is home to numerous high-end buildings, including offices, restaurants, hotels, shopping centers, and banks. The district boasts two of the tallest buildings in South America, the Titanium La Portada, a 55-story tower and 194 meters in height, and the Gran Torre Santiago, a 300-meter, 63-story tower located in the nearby Providencia commune.

==History==
The land—known then as &quot;Hacienda San Luis&quot;—was acquired in 1907 from Banco de Chile bank by Ricardo Lyon, an agriculturist and mayor of Providencia commune. In 1937, a zoning scheme for Las Condes commune was defined. Architect Eduardo Lewellyn-Jones was entrusted with the task of designing a new residential area for Santiago&#x27;s aristocracy. It was not until the early 1990s that real estate agencies set their sights on the area.

Today Sanhattan is among the most expensive land in Chile, with an average cost of 200 Unidad de Fomento (about US$8,300) per square meter in 2010.

==Extent==
According to newspaper &quot;La Tercera&quot;, Sanhattan is bounded by Av. Presidente Riesco to the north, El Golf to the east, Av. Apoquindo and Tajamar to the south, and the Mapocho river to the west.

==Transport==
Parking sites are few around Sanhattan, thus many people travel by subway or microbus. Line 1 of the city subway is located nearby. Sanhattan is surrounded by the Costanera Norte Highway.

<text>Jacob Obrecht (also Hobrecht; 1457/8 – late July 1505) was a Flemish composer of masses, motets and songs. He was the most famous composer of [[mass (music)|masses] in Europe of the late 15th century and was only eclipsed after his death by [[Josquin des Prez]].

==Life==

What little is known of Obrecht&#x27;s origins and early childhood comes mostly from his motet &quot;Mille quingentis&quot;. He was the only son of [[Ghent]] city trumpeter Willem Obrecht and Lijsbette Gheeraerts. His mother died in 1460 at the age of 20, and his father in 1488 in Ghent.

Details of his early education are sparse, but he probably learned to play the [[trumpet]], like his father, and in so doing learned [[counterpoint]] and how to improvise over a [[cantus firmus]]. He is likely to have known [[Antoine Busnois]] at the Burgundian court, and certainly knew his music, since Obrecht&#x27;s earliest mass shows close stylistic parallels with the elder composer.

Scholar, composer and clergyman, Obrecht seems to have had a succession of short appointments, two of which ended in less than ideal circumstances. There is a record of his compensating for a shortfall in his accounts by donating choirbooks he had copied. Throughout the period he was held in the highest esteem both by his patrons and by his fellow composers. [[Johannes Tinctoris|Tinctoris]], writing in [[Naples]], singles him out in a shortlist of contemporary master composers—all the more significant because he was only 25 when Tinctoris created his list, and on the other side of Europe. [[Erasmus]] served as one of Obrecht&#x27;s choirboys around 1476.

While most of Obrecht&#x27;s appointments were in [[Flanders]] in the Low Countries, he made at least two trips to Italy, once in 1487 at the invitation of Duke [[Ercole d&#x27;Este I]] of Ferrara, and again in 1504. Ercole had heard Obrecht&#x27;s music, which is known to have circulated in Italy between 1484 and 1487, and said that he appreciated it above the music of all other contemporary composers; consequently he invited Obrecht to Ferrara for six months in 1487. In 1504 Obrecht returned to Ferrara, but on the death of the Duke at the beginning of the next year he became unemployed. In what capacity he stayed in Ferrara is unknown, but he died in the outbreak of plague there just before 1 August 1505.

==Works==

Obrecht wrote mainly sacred music—[[mass (music)|masses]] and [[motet]]s—and he also wrote some [[chanson]]s.

Combining modern and archaic elements, Obrecht&#x27;s style is multi-dimensional. Perhaps more than those of the mature Josquin, the masses of Obrecht display a profound debt to the music of [[Johannes Ockeghem]] in the wide-arching melodies and long musical phrases that typify the latter&#x27;s music. Obrecht&#x27;s style is an example of the [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] extravagance of the late 15th century. He often used a [[cantus firmus]] technique for his masses: sometimes he divided his source material up into short phrases; at other times he used [[permutation (music)|retrograde]] versions of complete melodies or melodic fragments. He once even extracted the component notes and ordered them by note value, long to short, constructing new melodic material from the reordered sequences of notes. Clearly to Obrecht there could not be too much variety, particularly during the musically exploratory period of his early twenties. He began to break free from conformity to &quot;[[formes fixes]]&quot;, especially in his chansons. Of the &quot;formes fixes&quot;, the [[Rondeau (forme fixe)|rondeau]] retained its popularity longest. However, he much preferred composing Masses, where he found greater freedom. Furthermore, his motets reveal a wide variety of moods and techniques.

In his &quot;[[Missa Sub tuum presidium]]&quot;, the number of voice parts in the five movements increases from three in the &quot;Kyrie&quot;, to four in the &quot;Gloria&quot;, and so on up to seven in the &quot;Agnus Dei&quot;. The title chant is clearly heard in the top voice throughout the work, and five additional Marian chants are found in movements other than the &quot;Kyrie&quot; and &quot;Gloria&quot;: &quot;Ave preclara maris stella&quot; (Sequence verse 7, Soprano II, &quot;Credo&quot;), &quot;Aurea virga prime matris Eve&quot; (Sequence verse 9b, Soprano II and Tenor II, &quot;Sanctus&quot;), &quot;Aurea virga prime matrix Eve&quot; (Sequence verse 3b, Soprano II and Tenor I, &quot;Agnus Dei I &amp; II&quot;), &quot;Regina caeli&quot; (Antiphon, Soprano II and Tenor I, &quot;Agnus Dei III&quot;), and &quot;Verbum bonum et suave&quot; (Sequence verse 3b, Alto I, &quot;Agnus Dei&quot;). His late four-voice mass, &quot;[[Missa Maria zart]]&quot; (tender Maria), tentatively dated to around 1504, is based on a devotional song popular in the [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], which he probably heard as he went through the region around 1503 to 1504. Requiring more than an hour to perform, it is one of the longest polyphonic settings of the Mass Ordinary ever written and is considered among his finest works.

Despite working at the same period, Obrecht and Ockeghem (Obrecht&#x27;s senior by some 30 years) differ significantly in musical style. Obrecht does not share Ockeghem&#x27;s fanciful treatment of the cantus firmus but chooses to quote it verbatim. Whereas the phrases in Ockeghem&#x27;s music are ambiguously defined, those of Obrecht&#x27;s music can easily be distinguished, though both composers favor wide-arching melodic structure. Furthermore, Obrecht splices the cantus firmus melody with the intent of audibly reorganizing the motives; Ockeghem, on the other hand, does this far less.

Obrecht&#x27;s procedures contrast sharply with the works of the next generation, who favored an increasing simplicity of approach (prefigured by some works of his contemporary [[Josquin des Prez|Josquin]]). Although he was renowned in his time, Obrecht appears to have had little influence on subsequent composers; most probably, he simply went out of fashion along with the other contrapuntal masters of his generation.

<text>In mobile telecommunications network routing, E.214 is one of three prevailing numbering plans used for delivering mobility management related messages.

The E.164 numbering plan, which is a maximum of 15 digits and usually written with a &quot;+&quot; prefix, is the historic first-generation format representing the phone number. The E.212 is a second-generation number plan used in America, extended to include the subscriber&#x27;s MSIN (Mobile Subscription Identification Number) within the network&#x27;s customer base. The E.214, developed under European GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) standards, is a comparable extended second-generation format used outside America and can be more or less than 15 digits. 

In routing a transatlantic mobile call, numbers routed from European networks are converted from E.214 numbers into E.212 numbers at the boundary incoming toward America (this can mean the Signaling Transfer Point at the edge of the American operator&#x27;s network). In the outgoing direction, from America toward the rest of the world, numbers are converted from the E.212 standard to the E.214 standard. 

This process, called global title translation, is the SS7 equivalent to IP routing. E.214 numbers are routed separately from E.164 numbers since they are marked with a different Numbering Plan Indicator. However, it is possible to reuse the Global Title analysis tables used E.164 numbers everywhere except for the final destination network of the message. This saves considerable administrative work.

<text>Species is a 1995 American science fiction horror film directed by Roger Donaldson and written by Dennis Feldman. It stars Ben Kingsley, Michael Madsen, Alfred Molina, Forest Whitaker, Marg Helgenberger, and Natasha Henstridge in her film debut role. The film&#x27;s plot concerns a motley crew of scientists and government agents who try to track down Sil (Henstridge), a seductive extraterrestrial-human hybrid, before she successfully mates with a human male.

The film was conceived by Feldman in 1987, and was originally pitched as a film treatment in the style of a police procedural, entitled &quot;The Message&quot;. When &quot;The Message&quot; failed to attract the studios, Feldman re-wrote it as a spec script, which ultimately led to the making of the film. The extraterrestrial aspect of Sil&#x27;s character was created by H. R. Giger, who was also responsible for the beings from the &quot;Alien&quot; franchise. The effects combined practical models designed by Giger collaborator Steve Johnson and XFX, with computer-generated imagery done by Richard Edlund&#x27;s Boss Film Studios. Giger felt that the film and the character were too similar to &quot;Alien&quot;, so he pushed for script changes.

Most of the principal photography was done in Los Angeles, California, where the film is set. Several scenes were filmed in Utah and at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. &quot;Species&quot; was met with mixed reviews from critics, who felt that the film&#x27;s execution did not match the ambition of its premise, but nevertheless was a box office success, partly due to the hype surrounding Henstridge&#x27;s nude scenes in various tabloid newspapers and lad mags of the time, grossing US$113.3 million ($ million in dollars). It spawned a franchise, which includes one theatrical sequel (&quot;Species II&quot;), as well as two direct-to-television sequels (&quot;Species III&quot; and &quot;Species – The Awakening&quot;). &quot;Species&quot; was adapted into a novel by Yvonne Navarro and two comic book series by Dark Horse Comics, one of which was written by Feldman. The film may have also influenced the legend of the chupacabra. The film was mentioned by Podcast &quot;The Red Thread&quot; in reference to this relation to the chupacabra.

==Plot==
During the SETI program, Earth&#x27;s scientists send out transmissions, such as the Arecibo message, with information about Earth and its inhabitants in the hopes of finding life beyond Earth. After receiving transmissions from an alien source on how to create limitless fuel and an alien DNA sample with instructions on how to splice it with that of humans, the scientists assume the aliens are friendly. Inspired by the second transmission, a government team led by Xavier Fitch commissions a genetic experiment meant to create a female alien/human hybrid organism under the belief that she would have &quot;more docile and controllable&quot; traits. They eventually produce a girl codenamed &quot;Sil&quot;, who initially resembles a normal human and develops into a 12-year-old in three months.

Due to her violent outbursts while she is sleeping, the scientists deem her dangerous and prepare to kill her using cyanide gas, but she breaks out of her containment cell and escapes. Fearing she will mate with human males and produce offspring that will eventually exterminate the human race, the government assembles a team consisting of anthropologist Dr. Stephen Arden, molecular biologist Dr. Laura Baker, &quot;empath&quot; Dan Smithson, and black ops mercenary Preston &quot;Press&quot; Lennox to track and kill Sil. Using her superhuman strength and intelligence and regenerative capability to evade capture, Sil matures rapidly into her early twenties and travels to Los Angeles, where she kills several people to prevent them from alerting authorities and disguises herself.

Press and Baker find Sil after she fails to mate with and kills Robbie, a diabetic young man, and John Carey, a man she met following a car accident. She assumes her alien form and flees into a nearby forest, where she kidnaps a woman to assume her identity. Secretly returning to Carey&#x27;s home to spy on Fitch, Sil reads his lips and determines he and his team plan to stake out a nightclub to find her. After being spotted by Smithson, Sil lure her pursuers into a car chase wherein she leaves the woman she kidnapped to die while crashing the car into a high-voltage transformer and jumping out at the last minute. She later cuts and dyes her hair before developing an attraction towards Press, whom she dreamed of the previous night. Meanwhile, the government team celebrate Sil&#x27;s apparent death at a hotel, where Sil stealthily stalks them. Arden, upset about being alone, goes to his room to find Sil waiting for him. They soon have sex, resulting in her instantly becoming pregnant before she kills him once he realizes who she is. Sensing her presence, Smithson alerts the remaining team members. Sil transforms once more and escapes into the sewers. The team pursue, but Sil kills Fitch before giving birth. Her offspring subsequently attacks Smithson, who incinerates it with a flamethrower while Press kills Sil with a grenade launcher. As the survivors leave, they fail to notice a rat gnawing on one of Sil&#x27;s severed tentacles before mutating and killing another rat.

==Influence and themes==
Since Sil grows rapidly and kills humans with ease, at a certain point film character Dr. Laura Baker speculates if she was a biological weapon sent by a species who thought humans were like an intergalactic weed. Feldman declared that he wanted to explore this theme further in the script, as it discussed mankind&#x27;s place in the universe and how other civilizations would perceive and relate to humanity, considering that &quot;maybe [humans are] not a potential threat, maybe a competitor, maybe a resource&quot;. He also declared that more could be said about Sil&#x27;s existentialist doubts, as she does not know her origin or purpose, and only follows her instinct to mate and perpetuate the species.

Writing for the &quot;Journal of Popular Film &amp; Television&quot;, Susan George authored a paper that dealt with the portrayal of procreation in &quot;Species&quot;, &quot;Gattaca&quot; and &quot;Mimic&quot;. George compares the character of Fitch to &quot;an updated Dr. Frankenstein&quot;, and explores the development of Sil&#x27;s maternal aspirations, which convert the character into an &quot;archaic mother&quot; figure similar to the xenomorph creature in the &quot;Alien&quot; series, both of which are, she claims, portrayed negatively. George further states that a recurring theme in science fiction films is a response to &quot;this kind of powerful female sexuality and &#x27;alien-ness in that &quot;the feminine monster must die as Sil does at the end of &quot;Species&quot;&quot;. Feldman himself considered that an underlying theme regarded &quot;a female arriving and seeking to find a superior mate&quot;.

A five-year investigation into accounts of the chupacabra, a well known cryptid, revealed that the original sighting report of the creature in Puerto Rico by Madeline Tolentino may have been inspired by the character Sil. This was detailed in paranormal investigator and skeptic Benjamin Radford&#x27;s book &quot;Tracking the Chupacabra&quot;. According to Virginia Fugarino of Memorial University of Newfoundland writing for the &quot;Journal of Folklore Research&quot;, Radford found a link between the original eyewitness report and the design of Sil in her alien form, and hypothesized that &quot;[&quot;Species&quot;], which [Tolentino] did see before her sighting, influenced what she believes she saw of the chupacabra&quot;.

==Production==
===Writing and development===
Dennis Feldman had the idea for &quot;Species&quot; in 1987, as he worked on another film about an alien invasion, &quot;Real Men&quot;. Having read an article by Arthur C. Clarke about the insurmountable odds against an extraterrestrial craft ever locating and visiting Earth, given that stellar distances are great, and faster-than-light travel is unlikely, Feldman started to think that it was &quot;unsophisticated for any alien culture to come here in what [he]&#x27;d describe as a big tin can&quot;. Thus in turn he considered that the possibility of extraterrestrial contact was through information. Then he detailed that a message would contain instructions from across the void to build something that would talk to men. Instead of a mechanical device, Feldman imagined wetware. The visitor would adapt to Earth&#x27;s environment through DNA belonging to Earth&#x27;s organisms. Mankind has sent to space transmissions &quot;giving out directions&quot; such as the Arecibo message, which Feldman considered unwary, as they relay information to potential predators from outer space. He pointed out that &quot;in nature, one species would not want a predator to know where it hides&quot;.

Therefrom emerged a film treatment called &quot;The Message&quot;. The original script had more of a police procedural approach, with the alien being created by a &quot;bathtub geneticist&quot; who had just had his project aborted by the government, and a biologist who had worked on the project getting along with a police officer to search for the creature. Eventually Feldman came to believe this concept had some credibility issues, and instead changed the protagonists to a government team. After coining the name &quot;Sil&quot;, Feldman initially thought of forming an acronym, but in the end chose only the three-letter name after learning about the codons of the genetic code, which can be represented in groups of three letters. Sil would originally emerge from a DNA sequence manipulating human DNA, and constantly mutate as she used the human junk DNA to access &quot;all the defenses of the entire animal kingdom that [humans] evolved through – including ones that had never developed, plus ones [Earth&#x27;s scientists] don&#x27;t know about that have become extinct&quot;. Among the research Feldman did for the script included going to sessions of UCLA&#x27;s Center for the Study of Evolution and the Origin of Life (CSEOL), talking to SETI scientists, and visiting the Salk Institute for Biological Studies to talk with researchers working on the Human Genome Project. &quot;The Message&quot; was offered to several studios, but was passed up.

In 1993, Feldman reworked his ideas into a spec script. This was sent to producer Frank Mancuso, Jr., who had hired Feldman to adapt Sidney Kirkpatrick&#x27;s &quot;A Cast of Killers&quot;. The producer got attracted to the creative possibilities as the film offered &quot;the challenge of walking that fine line between believability and pushing something as far as it can go&quot;. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer got interested on the project, and while Feldman had some initial disagreements on the budget, after considering other studios he signed with MGM. In turn, the now retitled &quot;Species&quot; attracted director Roger Donaldson, who was attracted to its blend of science fiction and thriller. The script underwent eight different drafts, written over an eight-month period, before Donaldson was content that flaws in the story&#x27;s logic had been corrected. At one point another writer, Larry Gross, tried his hand with the script, but ultimately all the work was done by Feldman. Feldman would remain as a co-producer. While the initial &quot;Species&quot; script suggested a love triangle between Sil and two government team members, the dissatisfaction of the crew eventually led to changes to the ending, which ended up featuring Sil having a baby that would immediately prove dangerous.

When Donaldson was announced as the director in 1994, Mancuso stated that most of the $35 million budget would be spent on effects, as &quot;it&#x27;s not a movie that calls for stars. We&#x27;re going to try and put as much money as we can below the line and allow the effects and the creature to be the highlights of the film&quot;. The lesser emphasis on actors included a newcomer, former model Natasha Henstridge, as the human version of the creature Sil.

===Design===

Sil was designed by Swiss artist H. R. Giger, who also created the creatures in the &quot;Alien&quot; films. Donaldson thought Giger was the best man for the film after reading his compendium &quot;Necronomicon&quot;, and eventually he and Mancuso flew to Switzerland to meet the artist. What attracted Giger was the opportunity to design &quot;a monster in another way—an aesthetic warrior, also sensual and deadly, like the women look in [his] paintings&quot;. While Giger opted to stay in Switzerland to take care of his dying mother instead of flying to Los Angeles to accompany production, he built some puppets in his own studio, and later faxed sketches and airbrush paintings as production went through.

The practical models were made by Steve Johnson and his company XFX, which had already worked with Giger&#x27;s designs in &quot;Poltergeist II: The Other Side&quot;. Giger had envisioned more stages of Sil&#x27;s transformation, but the film only employed the last one, where she is &quot;transparent outside and black inside—like a glass body but with carbon inside&quot;, with XFX doing the translucent skin based on what they had done for the aliens of &quot;The Abyss&quot;. Sil&#x27;s alien form had both full-body animatronics with replaceable arms, heads and torsos, and a body suit. Richard Edlund&#x27;s Boss Film Studios was hired for over 50 shots of computer-generated imagery, which included one of the earliest forms of motion capture effects. Using a two-foot-high (60 cm) electric puppet that had sensors translating its movements to a digital Sil, Boss Films managed to achieve in one day what would have once taken as much as three weeks with practical effects.

Giger was unhappy with some elements he found to bear similarity with other films, particularly the &quot;Alien&quot; franchise. At one point he sent a fax to Mancuso finding five similarities: a &quot;chestburster&quot; (as Sil giving birth echoed the infant Alien breaking out of its host&#x27;s chest), the creature having a punching tongue (Giger at first wanted Sil&#x27;s tongue to be composed of barbed hooks), a cocoon, the use of flame throwers, and having Giger as the creature designer. A great point of contention was the ending, which Giger considered derivative from the climaxes from both &quot;Alien 3&quot; and &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;. The designer felt that horror films frequently held some final confrontation with fire, which he considered old-fashioned and linked to medieval witch trials. He sent some ideas for the climax to the producers, with them accepting to have Sil&#x27;s ultimate death occurring by headshot.

===Filming===
Filming happened mostly in Los Angeles, including location shooting at Sunset Strip, Silver Lake, Pacific Palisades, the Hollywood Hills and the Biltmore Hotel. Id Club, the nightclub featured in the film, was built within Hollywood&#x27;s Pantages Theater, while the hills above Dodger Stadium near Elysian Park were used for the car chase and crash where Sil fakes her death. For the opening scenes in Utah, the Tooele Army Depot dubbed as the outside of the research facility—the interiors were shot at the Rockwell International Corporation laboratory in California—and a Victorian-era train station in Brigham City was part of Sil&#x27;s escape. Other locations included the Santa Monica Pier and the Arecibo Telescope in Puerto Rico. The most complex sets involved the sewer complex and a tar-filled granite cavern where the ending occurs. Donaldson wanted a maze quality for the sewers, which had traces of realism (such as tree roots breaking through from the ceiling) and artistic licenses. Production designer John Muto intentionally designed the sewers wider and taller than real ones, as well as with walkways, but nevertheless aiming for a claustrophobic and realistic atmosphere. The tunnels were built out of structural steel, metal rod, plaster and concrete to endure the fire effects, and had its design based on the La Brea Tar Pits, with Muto describing them as &quot;just the sort of place in which a creature from another planet might feel at home&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Species&quot; received a wide theatrical release on July 7, 1995. Its opening weekend was $17.1 million, MGM&#x27;s biggest opening at the time and ranked second in the box office ranking behind &quot;Apollo 13&quot;. Budgeted at $35 million, the film earned a total of $113 million worldwide ($ million adjusted for inflation), including $60 million in the United States. Audiences polled by CinemaScore during opening weekend gave the film an average grade of &quot;B−&quot; on a scale ranging from A+ to F.

MGM Home Entertainment released the film on DVD in March 1997, which contains a booklet with trivia and production notes, and on VHS in August 1999. In July 2006, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released it on Blu-ray, whose supplements includes several featurettes as well as two audio commentary tracks: one by director Roger Donaldson, Natasha Henstridge and Michael Madsen, and another from Donaldson, cinematographer Andrzej Bartkowiak, make-up effects creator Steve Johnson, visual effects supervisor Richard Edlund and producer Frank Mancuso Jr. In July 2017, Scream Factory released a collector&#x27;s edition Blu-ray, issued with a concoction of new and archival bonus contents which have been ported over from original DVD and Blu-ray versions.

==Reception==
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an approval rating of 42% based on 73 reviews, with an average rating of 5.30/10 and a critical consensus which reads: &quot;&quot;Species&quot; shows flashes of the potential to blend exploitation and sci-fi horror in ingenious ways, but is ultimately mainly interested in flashing star Natasha Henstridge&#x27;s skin&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 49 out of 100 based on 25 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave it 2 out of 4 stars, criticizing the film&#x27;s plot and overall lack of intelligence. Cristine James from &quot;Boxoffice&quot; magazine gave the film 2 out of 5 stars, describing it as &quot;&quot;Alien&quot; meets &quot;V&quot; meets &quot;Splash&quot; meets &quot;Playboy&#x27;s Erotic Fantasies: Forbidden Liaisons&quot;, diluted into a diffuse, misdirected bore&quot;. James Berardinelli gave the film 2½ out of 4 stars, stating that &quot;as long as you don&#x27;t stop to think about what&#x27;s going on, &quot;Species&quot; is capable of offering its share of cheap thrills, with a laugh or two thrown in as well&quot;. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; found the film lacking in imagination and special effects, also commenting that Alfred Molina &quot;sport[s] a haircut that&#x27;s scarier than the creature&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot;&#x27;s review of the film described it as a &quot;gripping if not overly original account of an extraterrestrial species attempting to overwhelm our own&quot; and that Ben Kingsley and other lead actors &quot;have only two-dimensional roles to engage them&quot;. The review notes the similarity between H.R. Giger&#x27;s design of Sil and his work on &quot;Alien&quot;.

Scott Weinberg of &quot;DVD Talk&quot; praised the acting, Feldman&#x27;s screenplay and Donaldson&#x27;s direction. He concluded by saying that &quot;Species&quot; makes for &quot;a very good time for the genre fans&quot;. Mick LaSalle, writing for &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, was notedly less enthusiastic, quipping that if &quot;&quot;Species&quot; were a little bit worse, it would have a shot at becoming a camp classic&quot;. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Peter Rainer described &quot;Species&quot; as &quot;a pretty good Boo! movie&quot;, finding it an entertaining thriller while unoriginal and with ineffective tonal shifts.

Yvonne Navarro co-wrote a novelization based on the original screenplay with Dennis Feldman. The book gives several in-depth details about the characters not seen in the film, such as Sil&#x27;s ability to visualize odors and determine harmful substances from edible items by the color. Gas appears black, food appears pink, and an unhealthy potential mate appears to give off green fumes. Other character details include Preston&#x27;s background in tracking down AWOL soldiers as well as the process of decoding the alien signal. Although no clues are given as to its origin, it is mentioned that the message was somehow routed through several black holes to mask its point of origin. An audiobook version narrated by Alfred Molina won the Audie Award for Solo Performance.

Dark Horse Comics published a four-issue comic book adapting the film, written by Feldman and penciled by Jon Foster. Dark Horse would also publish a mini-series with an all-new storyline, &quot;Species: Human Race&quot;, released in 1997. West End Games released a &quot;World of Species&quot; sourcebook for its Masterbook role-playing game system. MGM had partnered with Cyberdreams to make a computer game based on the film, and while the company managed to release an H.R. Giger screen saver featuring &quot;Species&quot; images, the game never came to be due to Cyberdreams&#x27; closure.

===Sequels===

The first sequel to &quot;Species&quot;, &quot;Species II&quot; was released theatrically on April 10, 1998. The film depicts astronauts on a mission to Mars being attacked by the aliens from &quot;Species&quot;, and the events that ensue upon their return to Earth. There, Dr. Baker has been working on Eve, a more docile clone of Sil. Madsen and Helgenberger reprised their roles, while Henstridge played Eve. &quot;Species II&quot; received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics, garnering a 9% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes, and Madsen denounced it as a terrible film. The film&#x27;s director, Peter Medak, attributed the failure of the film to not picking up the infected rat ending of the original film. Navarro later authored the novelization for &quot;Species II&quot; which followed the film&#x27;s original screenplay with added scenes.

The second sequel, &quot;Species III&quot;, followed in 2004. It premiered on Sci-Fi Channel on November 27, with a DVD release on December 7. The film&#x27;s plot starts where &quot;Species II&quot; ends, revolving around Sunny Mabrey&#x27;s character Sara, the daughter of Eve, reared by a doctor played by Robert Knepper. Sara, an alien-human hybrid, seeks other hybrids to mate with. Henstridge appears in a cameo at the beginning of the film. Two out of six critics mentioned on Rotten Tomatoes gave it a positive rating, with &quot;DVD Talk&quot;&#x27;s reviewer noting that it is &quot;a more cohesive and sensible flick than [&quot;Species II&quot;] is, but ultimately, it&#x27;s just a lot of the same old schtick&quot;, while Film Freak Central called it &quot;amateurish&quot; and &quot;vapid&quot;. A fourth film, &quot;Species: The Awakening&quot; came out in 2007, following the schedule of &quot;Species III&quot; of Sci-Fi Channel premiere and subsequent DVD release. None of the actors from the original film returned in this sequel, which instead starred Helena Mattsson as the alien-hybrid seductress.

<text>Onuf&#x27;s nucleus is a distinct group of neurons located in the ventral part (lamina IX) of the anterior horn of the sacral region of the human spinal cord involved in the maintenance of micturition and defecatory continence, as well as muscular contraction during orgasm. It contains motor neurons, and is the origin of the pudendal nerve. The sacral region of the spinal cord is the fourth segment (cervical, thoracic, and lumbar being the first three) of vertebrae in the spinal cord which consists of the vertebrae 26-30. While working in New York City in 1899, Bronislaw Onuf-Onufrowicz discovered this group of unique cells and originally identified it as “Group X.” “Group X” was considered distinct by Onufrowicz because the cells were different in size from the surrounding neurons in the anterolateral group, suggesting that they were independent.

==Structure==
Onuf&#x27;s nucleus is a distinct group of neurons located in the ventral part (lamina IX) of the anterior horn of the sacral region of the human spinal cord involved in the maintenance of micturition and defecatory continence, as well as muscular contraction during orgasm. It contains motor neurons, and is the origin of the pudendal nerve. The sacral region of the spinal cord is the fourth segment (cervical, thoracic, and lumbar being the first three) of vertebrae in the spinal cord which consists of the vertebrae 26-30.

This small group of neural cells is located between S1 and S2 or S2 and S3 and although Onuf&#x27;s nucleus is located primarily in S2, it can extend to the caudal end of the first sacral segment or to the middle part of the third sacral segment. Also, Onuf&#x27;s nucleus is found almost symmetrically on both sides of the ventral horn. This innervation, or nerve supply, is arranged in a neuropil and averages approximately 625 neurons in both the left and right ventral horns, and measures about 4–6 mm on each side. In other animals it averages approximately 300-500 on both sides. 

Many staining techniques have been used to study the anatomy of Onuf&#x27;s nucleus. The Nissl method was commonly used as well as myelin sheath stains and silver stains. Use of the Klüver-Barrera staining method showed that Onuf&#x27;s nucleus appears clear due to the presence of many vertically arranged unmyelinated fibers. The sizes of the cells in Onuf&#x27;s nucleus are small in comparison to other lateral group cells. The neurons in Onuf&#x27;s nucleus are motoneurons, and like most motoneurons they are characterized by their multipolarity and large Nissl bodies.

== Function ==
Onuf&#x27;s nucleus is the origin of innervation for the striated muscles of the rectum and urethral sphincters. The neurons of Onuf&#x27;s nucleus are responsible for controlling external sphincter muscles of the anus and urethra in humans. Onufrowicz also proposed that Onuf&#x27;s nucleus controlled the ischiocavernosus and bulbocavernosus muscles which function in penile erection and ejaculation in males. The dorsomedial subnucleus innervates the external anal sphincter and the ventrolateral subgroup connects to the external urethral sphincter.

=== Somatic===
* The motor neurons of Onuf&#x27;s nucleus innervate striated musculature (rhabdosphincter muscle) which is controlled voluntarily.
* Neurons in Onuf&#x27;s nucleus lack autonomic dense-core vesicles even though they receive the same synaptic endings as alpha motor neurons.
* A study by Bergmann et al. showed that Onuf nucleus cells have the same cytoskeletal abnormalities as alpha motor neurons in motor neuron disease/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

=== Autonomic ===
* Diseases characterized by disturbances in urination and defecation affect autonomic and Onuf&#x27;s nucleus cells similarly.
* Both cell types are spared by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
* Onuf&#x27;s nucleus cells are anatomically linked with the sacral parasympathetic motor neurons and have many peptidergic nerve terminals.
* Cells in Onuf&#x27;s nucleus resemble autonomic neurons and do not receive afferents from adjacent neurons.

=== Neurotransmitters in Onuf&#x27;s nucleus ===
The motoneurons in Onuf&#x27;s nucleus contain a dense array of serotonin and norepinephrine receptors and neurotransmitters and are activated by glutamate. When the 5-HT and NE receptors are stimulated, the guarding reflex occurs to prevent voiding of the bladder caused by unexpected abdominal pressure.

=== Sexual dimorphism ===

Onuf&#x27;s nucleus is sexually dimorphic, meaning that there are differences in Onuf&#x27;s nucleus between males and females of the same species. Sexual dimorphism of Onuf&#x27;s nucleus has been found in dogs, monkeys, and humans. Males of these species have more of these motoneurons than do their female counterparts. It has also been shown that the sex differences in Onuf&#x27;s nucleus can be reduced (or in some cases eliminated) by exposing a prenatal female to high levels of androgen.

==Clinical significance==

===Urinary stress incontinence ===

Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is a common disease in women caused by pelvic floor muscle weakness. Coughing, laughing, sneezing, exercising or other movements that increase intra-abdominal pressure, and thus increase pressure on the bladder, are common reasons for urine loss.

There are three layers of muscle that are known to control urine flow through the urethra; an inner band of longitudinal smooth muscle, a middle band of circular smooth muscle, and an external band of striated muscle called the rhabdosphincter. The urethra is controlled by the sympathetic, parasympathetic, and somatic divisions of the peripheral nervous system. The sympathetic innervation (nerve supply) comes from the sympathetic preganglionic neurons located in the upper lumbar spinal cord along the hypogastric nerve and terminates in the longitudinal and circular smooth muscle layers in the urethra. The parasympathetic nerve supply comes from the parasympathetic preganglionic neurons in the sacral spinal cord and also terminates in the longitudinal and circular smooth muscle layers. Finally the somatic nerve supply arises from the urethral sphincter motor neurons in the ventral horn of the sacral spinal cord; better known as Onuf&#x27;s nucleus. The pudendal nerve that extends from Onuf&#x27;s nucleus, connects directly to the rhabdosphincter muscle to control micturation.

The sympathetic storage reflex or pelvic-to-hypo-gastric reflex is initiated when the bladder swells. Stretch receptors cause postganglionic neurons to release norepinephrine (NE). NE causes the bladder to relax and the urethra to contract, thus preventing urine loss. The somatic storage reflex or the pelvic-to-pudendal or guarding reflex is initiated when one laughs, sneezes, or coughs, which causes increased bladder pressure. Glutamate is the primary excitatory transmitter for the reflex. Glutamate activates NMDA and AMPA receptors which produce action potentials. These action potentials activate the release of acetylcholine causing the rhabdosphincter muscle fibers to contract. When the guarding reflex does not function normally, SUI occurs.

;Duloxetine

Onuf&#x27;s nucleus controls rhabdosphincter motor neurons and has been shown to contain a dense array of 5-HT (serotonin) and NE terminals. 5-HT and NE were shown to inhibit bladder activity. In 2005, researchers Wolfgang H. Jost and Parvaneh Marsalek used serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) to increase the synaptic levels of both 5-HT and NE in the synaptic cleft. Duloxetine hydrochloride, a SNRI, has been shown to increase bladder capacity and sphincteric muscle activity in animals and humans exhibiting irritated bladder function. Duloxetine is the first medication developed to help SUI. This is promising because Duloxetine also showed no effect on bladder contraction force or duration which suggests that Duloxetine is affecting the sensory limb of the urination process. 5-HT and NE do not function through direct excitation of motor neurons but facilitate the effects of glutamate. When glutamatergic activation in sphincter motor neurons is absent there is no effect of NE or 5-HT (seen during micturition contraction).

===Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ===

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( Lou Gehrig disease ) is a disease that causes degeneration of motoneurons that control voluntary muscle movement. Surprisingly, the bladder and rectum sphincters remain normal even during the final terminal stages of the illness. Since these muscles are controlled by Onuf&#x27;s nucleus, it is of great importance in the study of this disease. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Onuf&#x27;s nucleus is preserved but the other anterior horn cell groups atrophy. This discovery reinforced the notion that Onuf&#x27;s nucleus controlled the muscles related to sphincter function in the anus and urethra.

In a study conducted by Kihira et al., eight individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were compared to nine control cases. The results indicated that the total number of neurons in Onuf&#x27;s nucleus in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis did not differ from the control patients. However, normal neurons decreased in number while atrophic neurons increased. It was also shown that the decrease in the number of normal neurons was not due to aging. Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis also contain less RNA in their motoneurons than normal individuals. The decrease in RNA is correlated with the decrease in size of the nucleolus. Thus, the size of the nucleolus may be an early indicator of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

There is often sparing of Onuf&#x27;s nucleus in spinal muscular atrophy type 1.

=== Shy–Drager syndrome ===
In order to study Onuf&#x27;s nucleus from the opposite perspective (meaning cases where it was not preserved) studies were done on Shy–Drager syndrome. Shy–Drager syndrome is a rare neurodegenerative disease that attacks the autonomic nervous system. Since the main symptom of Shy–Drager syndrome is incontinence it makes it a good candidate to study its effects on Onuf&#x27;s nucleus. When the sacral sections of the spinal cord were studied in patients with Shy–Drager syndrome, it was revealed that cell death was confined to the area of Onuf&#x27;s nucleus. This, once again, verified the role Onuf&#x27;s nucleus in vesicorectal function.

==History==
While working in New York City in 1899, Bronislaw Onuf-Onufrowicz discovered this group of unique cells and originally identified it as “Group X.” “Group X” was considered distinct by Onufrowicz because the cells were different in size from the surrounding neurons in the anterolateral group, suggesting that they were independent.

== Other animals ==

Onuf&#x27;s nucleus is not specific only to humans. As mentioned before, the motor neurons of the external urethral sphincter and the external anal sphincter are found in ventral horn of the second sacral segment known as Onuf&#x27;s nucleus. Using horseradish peroxidase to stain the neurons, it has been determined that the external anal sphincter motoneurons are located in dorsomedial to the external urethral sphincter motoneuron in the cat, dog, monkey, golden hamster, as well as the man. However, the location of these motoneurons differs in the rat, Mongolian gerbil and domestic pig. In the rat, these motoneurons are located in separate cell groups.

In addition to differences among location of the motoneurons responsible or sphincter function, it is important to mention the differences in sexual dimorphism between species. Although sexual dimorphism of Onuf&#x27;s nucleus is present in all species, the extent of the sexual dimorphism varies. For example, sexual dimorphism in the number of perineal motoneurons is less obvious in dogs and humans than it is in rats. This is to be expected because female dogs retain perineal muscles whereas female rats do not have perineal muscles. As in humans, prenatal androgen plays an important role in establishing the sex differences in Onuf&#x27;s nucleus of these species. If a female is exposed to excess androgen during the prenatal period, the sexual dimorphism does not occur in Onuf&#x27;s nucleus.

Routinely, in order to write down the kinetic formula_2 and potential formula_3 parts of the Lagrangian formula_4 in arbitrary generalized coordinates the position of the mass is expressed along Cartesian axes. Here, following the conventions shown in the diagram,
:formula_5
:formula_6
:formula_7.
Next, time derivatives of these coordinates are taken, to obtain velocities along the axes
:formula_8
:formula_9
:formula_10.
Thus,

:formula_11

and

:formula_12
:formula_13

The Lagrangian, with constant parts removed, is 

:formula_14

The Euler–Lagrange equation involving the polar angle formula_15

:formula_16
gives
:formula_17
and
:formula_18
When formula_19 the equation reduces to the differential equation for the motion of a simple gravity pendulum.

Similarly, the Euler–Lagrange equation involving the azimuth formula_20,

:formula_21
gives
:formula_22.
The last equation shows that angular momentum around the vertical axis, formula_23 is conserved. The factor formula_24 will play a role in the Hamiltonian formulation below.

The second order differential equation determining the evolution of formula_20 is thus
:formula_26.

The azimuth formula_20, being absent from the Lagrangian, is a cyclic coordinate, which implies that its conjugate momentum is a constant of motion.

The conical pendulum refers to the special solutions where formula_28 and formula_29 is a constant not depending on time.

==Hamiltonian mechanics==
The Hamiltonian is

:formula_30

where conjugate momenta are

:formula_31

and

:formula_32.

In terms of coordinates and momenta it reads

formula_33

Hamilton&#x27;s equations will give time evolution of coordinates and momenta in four first-order differential equations

:formula_34
:formula_35
:formula_36
:formula_37

Momentum formula_38 is a constant of motion. That is a consequence of the rotational symmetry of the system around the vertical axis.

== Trajectory ==

Trajectory of the mass on the sphere can be obtained from the expression for the total energy

:formula_39

by noting that the horizontal component of angular momentum formula_40 is a constant of motion, independent of time. This is true because neither gravity nor the reaction from the sphere act in directions that would affect this component of angular momentum.

Hence

:formula_41
:formula_42

which leads to an elliptic integral of the first kind for formula_15

:formula_44

and an elliptic integral of the third kind for formula_20

:formula_46.

The angle formula_15 lies between two circles of latitude, where

:formula_48.

<text>The Pitheciidae () are one of the five families of New World monkeys now recognised. Formerly, they were included in the family Atelidae. The family includes the titis, saki monkeys and uakaris. Most species are native to the Amazon region of Brazil, with some being found from Colombia in the north to Bolivia in the south.

==Characteristics==
Pitheciids are small to medium-sized monkeys, ranging from 23 cm in head-body length for the smaller titis, to 44–49 cm for the uakaris. They have medium to long fur, in a wide range of colors, often with contrasting patches, especially on the face.

They are diurnal and arboreal animals, found in tropical forests from low-lying swamp to mountain slopes. They are predominantly herbivorous, eating mostly fruit and seeds, although some species will also eat a small number of insects. Sakis and uakaris have a diastema between the canine and premolar teeth, but the titis, which have unusually small canines for New World monkeys, do not. All species have the dental formula: 

Females give birth to a single young after a gestation period of between four and six months, depending on species. The uakaris and bearded sakis are polygamous, living in groups of 8-30 individuals. Each group has multiple males, which establish a dominance hierarchy amongst themselves. The titis and &quot;Pithecia&quot; sakis, by contrast, are monogamous and live in much smaller family groups.

==Classification==

There are 54 currently recognized extant species of pitheciid monkey, grouped into two subfamilies and six genera. Eleven extinct genera known from the fossil record are placed in the family, extending the age of the family to the Miocene.

<text>The Accused is a 1988 American legal drama film directed by Jonathan Kaplan and written by Tom Topor, loosely based on the 1983 gang rape of Cheryl Araujo in New Bedford, Massachusetts. The film stars Jodie Foster as Sarah Tobias, a young waitress who is gang raped by three men at a local bar. With the help of District Attorney Katheryn Murphy (played by Kelly McGillis), she sets out to prosecute the rapists as well as the men who helped induce the assault. It also features performances from Bernie Coulson, Leo Rossi, Ann Hearn, Carmen Argenziano, Steve Antin, and Tom O&#x27;Brien. Principal photography began in Vancouver on April 27, 1987, and concluded on June 22.

&quot;The Accused&quot; was released in limited theatres in North America on October 14, 1988, and 
premiered the following year at the 39th Berlin International Film Festival, where it competed for the Golden Bear. The film was highly controversial upon release due to its graphic portrayal of gang rape. Despite this, it received widespread acclaim from critics, with many praising the performances of the cast and authentic portrayal of its subject matter. It was chosen by the National Board of Review as the 3rd-best film of the year. The film was credited for being one of the first mainstream films to deal with the horrors of rape and its aftermath on a victim&#x27;s life. Foster&#x27;s performance marked her breakthrough into adult roles, earning numerous accolades including the Academy Award for Best Actress at the 61st ceremony.

==Plot==
On April 18, 1987, 24-year-old waitress Sarah Tobias is brutally gang-raped by three men at a local bar while several patrons watch and cheer. District Attorney Katheryn Murphy is assigned to the case. Although there is strong physical evidence corroborating Sarah&#x27;s rape, Katheryn feels that Sarah will not make a credible witness if the case goes to trial due to her checkered past and flirtatious behavior with the men before her attack. She agrees to a plea bargain, allowing the three rapists to plead guilty to the lesser offense of reckless endangerment, a felony without a sexual offense, and serve nine months in prison. Sarah is angered and feels betrayed by Katheryn&#x27;s decision, as she wants the chance to tell her story.

Several months later, Sarah is harassed in a parking lot by one of the men who watched and encouraged her rape. In response, she drives her car into his truck, resulting in her hospitalization. Katheryn feels guilty for not giving Sarah the choice to take her case to trial and offering her rapists a plea deal. She decides to prosecute the men who clapped and cheered during Sarah&#x27;s assault for criminal solicitation. If convicted, the rape will go on record, nullifying the plea deal, and her rapists will serve 5 years in prison.

As the case goes to trial, Sarah is finally able to testify about what happened the night of her attack. Meanwhile, Katheryn pores over evidence and comes across a tape of a 911 call in which a young man reports Sarah&#x27;s rape. She discovers the caller is Kenneth Joyce, a college student who was present that night at the bar. Reluctant at first, he agrees to testify for the prosecution, recounting how the accused men cheered and goaded the rapists on as they brutalized Sarah. The three men are found guilty of criminal solicitation, and as a result, the rapists will serve additional time in prison. Sarah leaves the courtroom triumphant with Katheryn.

The film closes with a title stating, &quot;In the United States a rape is reported every six minutes. One out of every four rape victims is attacked by two or more assailants&quot;.

==Themes==
It is loosely based on the 1983 gang rape of Cheryl Araujo in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and the resulting trial which received national coverage (and was also the focus of an episode on the 2020 Netflix documentary series &quot;Trial by Media&quot;). The film explores the themes of classism, misogyny, post-traumatic stress disorder, slut shaming, victim blaming and women&#x27;s empowerment.

==Production==
===Development===
Screenwriter Tom Topor was inspired to write the film after the trial involving the rape of Cheryl Araujo became national news. Dawn Steel called him to ask if he&#x27;d be interested in doing a movie on the subject. Sherry Lansing and Stanley Jaffe from Paramount Pictures were subsequently signed on to produce the film. Topor interviewed 30 rape victims and numerous rapists, prosecutors, defense attorneys and medical professionals. Jonathan Kaplan met with Steel and discussed the possibility of making a film on the subject. The original draft of the script mainly focused on the lawyer&#x27;s story. However, Kaplan wanted the rape victim to be as prominent as the lawyer; the script also featured a pool table (reflecting the real life incident), but the producers were concerned with being sued, so it was changed to a pinball machine.

Following the test screenings, the film received the lowest scores in the history of Paramount. According to Lansing, &quot;The audience thought that Jodie&#x27;s character deserved the rape.&quot; Studio executives wanted to put the film on the shelf and were looking for ways to prevent it from being released. Lansing asked for another screening with just women, which was far more successful. Of the 20 women in the room, 18 had experience with rape — either they or someone they knew had been raped. When tested again months later, it was given one of the highest scores in the studio&#x27;s history.

===Casting===
Due to its hard-edged themes and graphic screenplay, the studio was already skeptical about making the film, and it was essential for the producers to cast a bankable actress in the role of Sarah Tobias. Numerous actresses were offered or considered for the part including Kim Basinger, Demi Moore, Jennifer Beals, Meg Tilly, and Rosanna Arquette, but all of them rejected the film due to its controversial themes. Producers Sherry Lansing and Stanley R. Jaffe both had serious reservations for casting Foster since they thought she couldn&#x27;t be sexual enough for the role of Sarah. Also, Foster who had recently graduated from Yale and didn&#x27;t make any successful films during her time at school, wasn&#x27;t the prime choice for the producers. Following numerous auditions as well as rejection from various established actresses, she was finally cast in the part.

Jane Fonda was initially attached to play attorney Katheryn Murphy but left the project as she found the script exploitative and poorly written. Ellen Barkin, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sigourney Weaver, Debra Winger, Meryl Streep and Geena Davis were also considered for the part. Kelly McGillis, who had just experienced commercial success with the action film &quot;Top Gun&quot; (1986), was cast for the bankable prospects of the film. McGillis was initially offered to play Sarah but declined, citing her personal experience. 
She acknowledged at the time of the film&#x27;s release that she herself had survived a violent attack and rape in 1982 when two men broke into her apartment. Based on her experience, she took on the role of Murphy.

After a long career as a child star, including a breakout performance in Taxi Driver, at age 18, Foster had taken a sabbatical from Hollywood to attend Yale, and had experienced a bit of a dry spell upon her return to acting, with several films receiving a lukewarm response with critics and at the box office. She stated that she had thought about retiring from acting had &quot;The Accused&quot; followed suit.

===Filming===
Principal photography for &quot;The Accused&quot; began on April 22, 1987, and wrapped two months later, on June 2. Although set in Washington state, the film was shot primarily in Vancouver, British Columbia. The gang rape scene was highly controversial at the time of the film&#x27;s release. It took five days to complete, and filming was a difficult experience for the cast and crew. Everyone felt protective of Jodie Foster and was concerned about how traumatic the scene could be for her. In an interview, Foster explained that the rape scene was meticulously rehearsed beforehand to ensure there would be no unpleasant surprises during filming. She has stated that she does not remember shooting the scene and completely blacked out, even breaking blood vessels in her right eye from crying during the process. The male actors were deeply upset. Leo Rossi, who played Cliff &quot;Scorpion&quot; Albrect, a bystander, recalled that Woody Brown, who played Danny, one of the rapists, bolted from the set and vomited in his trailer after the scene. &quot;Complex&quot; ranked the rape scene #16 on its list of &quot;The 53 Most Hard-To-Watch Scenes in Movie History.&quot;

===Soundtrack===
==Release==
&quot;The Accused&quot; was released in limited theatres in North America on October 14, 1988. Although it was supposed to be released in April, it was deferred to October due to the Writers Guild of America&#x27;s strike. The film premiered at the 39th Berlin International Film Festival in 1989, where it competed for the Golden Bear.

==Reception==
===Box office===
In its opening weekend in the United States and Canada, &quot;The Accused&quot; was number one at the box office, grossing $4.3 million in 796 theaters. Domestically, the film grossed $32.1 million.

===Critical response===

&quot;The Accused&quot; received positive reviews from critics upon its release, with Foster&#x27;s performance receiving widespread acclaim. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 93% based on 27 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10. On Metacritic, the film has an average score of 65 out of 100 indicating &quot;generally favourable reviews&quot;.

In a positive review, writing of the two criminal prosecutions in the film, Roger Ebert finds that the lesson of the trial &quot;may be the most important message this movie has to offer...that verbal sexual harassment, whether crudely in a saloon back room or subtly in an everyday situation, is a form of violence - one that leaves no visible marks but can make its victims feel unable to move freely and casually in society. It is a form of imprisonment.&quot; Rob Beattie from &quot;Empire&quot;, gave the film five out of five stars, calling it phenomenal and called the controversial rape scene &quot;devastating, harrowing and utterly convincing&quot;. Judy Steed of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; called it &quot;An experience that is sometimes unbearable and always riveting&quot;. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;A consistently engrossing melodrama, modest in its aims and as effective for the clichés it avoids as for the clear eye through which it sees its working-class American lives&quot;.

Marjorie Heins, in the 1998 book &quot;The V-Chip Debate: Content Filtering from Television to the Internet&quot;, said that educators worried that the film would &quot;receive V ratings and be subject to at least a presumption against curricular use in many public schools.&quot;

===Accolades===
At the 61st Academy Awards, Foster won Best Actress. This was the film&#x27;s sole nomination, thus marking the first occurrence of such an event since 1962 (when Sophia Loren won for &quot;Two Women&quot;) that the winner of the category won for a film with a single nomination. In 2006, Foster&#x27;s performance was ranked #56 on &quot;Premiere&#x27;s&quot; 100 Greatest Film Performances of all-time.

<text>The .338 Lapua Magnum (8.6×70mm or 8.58×70mm) is a Finnish rimless, bottlenecked, centerfire rifle cartridge. It was developed during the 1980s as a high-powered, long-range cartridge for military snipers. Due to its use in the War in Afghanistan and the Iraq War, the cartridge has become widely available.

The cartridge is named after Finnish town Lapua.

The loaded .338 cartridge is in diameter (rim) and long. It can penetrate better-than-standard military body armor at ranges of up to , and has a maximum effective range of about with C.I.P. conforming ammunition at sea level conditions. Muzzle velocity is dependent on barrel length, seating depth, and powder charge, and varies from for commercial loads with bullets, which corresponds to about of muzzle energy.

British military issue overpressure .338 Lapua Magnum cartridges with overall length, loaded with LockBase B408 very-low-drag bullets fired at 936 m/s (3,071 ft/s) muzzle velocity from a L115A3 Long Range Rifle were used in November 2009 by British sniper Corporal of Horse (CoH) Craig Harrison to establish a new record for the longest confirmed sniper kill in combat, at a range of (since broken). In reports, CoH Harrison mentions the environmental conditions at Musa Qala were perfect for long-range shooting: no wind, mild weather, and clear visibility.

In addition to its military role, it is used by hunters and civilian long-range shooting enthusiasts. The .338 Lapua Magnum is capable of taking down any big game animals, though its suitability for some dangerous game (Cape buffalo, hippopotamus, white rhinoceros, and elephant) is arguable unless accompanied by a larger &quot;backup&quot; caliber: &quot;There is a huge difference between calibers that will kill an elephant and those that can be relied upon to stop one.&quot; In Namibia, the .338 Lapua Magnum in the past was legal for hunting Africa&#x27;s big five game if the loads had at least muzzle energy. Since 2015, Namibia and other sub-Saharan countries generally require larger minimal bore diameters by law for big-five hunting.

==History==
===Initial development===
In 1983, Research Armament Industries (RAI) in the United States began development of a new, long-range sniper cartridge capable of firing a , bullet at , that could lethally penetrate five layers of military body armor at . After preliminary experiments, a .416 Rigby case necked down to take a bullet was selected, since this diameter presents an optimum of sectional density and penetrating capability for practical spin-stabilized rifle bullets (bullets up to about 5 to 5.5 calibers in length).

The .416 Rigby is an English big-game cartridge designed in 1911 to accommodate 325 MPa (47,137 psi) pressures. One of the disadvantages of these old cartridge cases, which were intended for firing cordite charges instead of modern smokeless powder, is the thickness of the sidewall just forward of the web (the solid portion of a cartridge between the head and the bottom of the primer pocket). During ignition, the cartridge&#x27;s base, just forward of the bolt face, is not supported.

During the process, RAI employed Jim Bell and Brass Extrusion Labs Ltd. (B.E.L.L.) of Bensenville, Illinois, to make the &quot;.338/416&quot; or &quot;8.58×71 mm&quot; cartridge cases, Hornady produced bullets, and RAI built a sniper rifle under contract for the U.S. Navy. RAI found that the BELL cases did not fulfill the requirements, since they were modified low pressure .416 Rigby cases. Pressed by military deadlines, RAI looked for another case producer and contacted Lapua of Finland in 1984. RAI was forced to drop out of the program due to financial difficulties. Subsequently, Lapua of Finland put this cartridge into limited production. The .338/416 rifle program was later canceled when the contractors were unable to meet the project&#x27;s velocity target of for a bullet, due to excessive pressures rupturing cartridge cases.

===Final development===
The .338 Lapua Magnum cartridge was developed as a joint venture between the Finnish rifle manufacturer SAKO and the British rifle manufacturer Accuracy International, along with the Finnish ammunition manufacturer Lapua, or more officially Nammo Lapua Oy, which since 1998 is part of the Nordic Ammunition Group (Nammo).

Lapua opted to redesign the .338/416 cartridge. In the new case design, particular attention was directed toward thickening and metallurgically strengthening the case&#x27;s web and sidewall immediately forward of the web. In modern solid head cases, the hardness of the brass is the major factor determining a case&#x27;s pressure limit before undergoing plastic deformation. Lapua tackled this problem by creating a hardness distribution ranging from the head and web (hard) to the mouth (soft) as well as a strengthened (thicker) case web and sidewall immediately forward of the web. This resulted in a very pressure-resistant case, allowing it to operate at high pressure and come within 15 m/s (50 ft/s) of the original velocity goal.
Lapua also designed a .338 caliber lock base B408 full metal jacket bullet, modeled after its .30 caliber lock base bullet configuration.
The result was the .338 Lapua Magnum cartridge which was registered with C.I.P. (Commission Internationale Permanente pour l&#x27;Epreuve des Armes à Feu Portatives) in 1989. With the procurement by the Dutch Army, the cartridge became NATO codified.

The .338 Lapua Magnum fills the gap between weapons chambered for standard military rounds such as the 7.62×51mm NATO and large, heavy rifles firing the .50 BMG cartridge. It also offers an acceptable amount of barrel wear, which is important to military snipers who tend to fire thousands of rounds a year in practice. This was achieved by coupling a sensible case volume (7.40 ml) to bore area (56.86 mm2/0.5686 cm2) ratio (13.01 Oratio) with ample space for loading relatively long slender projectiles that can provide good aerodynamic efficiency and external ballistic performance for the projectile diameter. Like every other comparable large magnum rifle cartridge, the .338 Lapua Magnum presents a stout recoil. An appropriate fitting stock and an effective muzzle brake helps to reduce recoil-induced problems, enabling the operator to fire more rounds before getting too uncomfortable to shoot accurately. Good factory loads, multiple projectile weights and factory special application ammunition are all available.

Due to its growing civilian popularity, several high-quality tactical and match (semi) custom bolt actions designed for the .338 Lapua Magnum are becoming available. These (semi) custom bolt-actions are used with other high-grade rifle and sighting components to build custom sporting and target rifles.

The .338 Lapua Magnum has been designated a &quot;cartridge of interest&quot; by the National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA). It is being groomed to replace the .300 Winchester Magnum and the .50 BMG for anti-personnel long-range service in the U.S. military. On June 17, 2008, the U.S. government issued a market survey to support a requirement for a precision sniper rifle (PRS) to possibly replace the then-fielded bolt-action SOF Sniper Syst&#x27;s0126.
On 7 March 2013, the Remington MSR was declared the winner of the precision sniper rifle competition. Remington announced that the MSR had won on 8 March, and it was publicly confirmed on 9 March. This was followed by a $79.7 million contract for 5,150 rifles with suppressors, along with 4,696,800 rounds of ammunition to be supplied over the next ten years. The contract was awarded on 12 September 2013. Remington Defense would produce the Mk 21 sniper rifles and utilized two other companies for other system components, with Barnes Bullets for ammunition and Advanced Armament Corporation for muzzle brakes and suppressors; all three companies are subsidiaries of Remington Outdoor Company. However, it was then decided that the Mk 21 did not conform to SOCOM requirements, and the program was re-competed with the Barrett MRAD selected in 2019 as the Mk 22 Advanced Sniper Rifle solution. The US military opted to use 7.62×51mm NATO, .300 Norma Magnum and instead of the .338 Lapua Magnum the  .338 Norma Magnum chambering in their Mk 22 rifles, which have a field-convertible barrel/chambering switch capability.

==Cartridge dimensions==
Extremely thick-walled brass results in a 7.40 ml (114 grains H2O) cartridge case capacity for the .338 Lapua Magnum. The exterior shape of the case was designed to promote reliable feeding and extraction in bolt action, semi-automatic, and automatic firearms alike, under extreme conditions.

.338 Lapua Magnum maximum C.I.P. cartridge dimensions. All sizes in millimeters (mm).

Americans define the shoulder angle at alpha/2 ≈ 20 degrees. The common rifling twist rate for this cartridge is 254 mm (1 in 10 in), 6 grooves, Ø lands = 8.38 mm, Ø grooves = 8.58 mm, land width = 2.79 mm and the primer type is large rifle magnum.

According to the official C.I.P. (Commission Internationale Permanente pour l&#x27;Epreuve des Armes à Feu Portatives) decisions and tables edition 2007 the .338 Lapua Magnum case can handle up to Pmax piezo pressure. This prevails over the C.I.P. decisions and tables edition 2003, that rated the .338 Lapua Magnum at Pmax maximum piezo pressure. The Pmax maximum piezo pressure C.I.P. ruling for the .300 Lapua Magnum cartridge, which is based on the same case, was at the time not accordingly changed. In C.I.P. regulated countries every rifle cartridge combo has to be proofed at 125% of the prevailing maximum C.I.P. pressure to certify for sale to consumers. This means that .338 Lapua Magnum chambered arms in C.I.P. regulated countries are proof tested at PE piezo pressure.

Lapua has been ambivalent on the maximum piezo pressure of this cartridge. In the article &quot;From an American dream to a Finnish success story&quot; by Janne Pohjoispää, Lapua propagates the C.I.P. 2007 ruling of maximum piezo pressure. To further complicate matters the mentioned 56,000 CUP C.I.P. copper crusher pressure translates to around C.I.P. piezo pressure according to a study on the conversion from CUP to PSI for rifle cartridges by Denton Bramwell. The C.I.P. 2003 ruling of piezo pressure is corroborated by Lapua Australia in the &quot;History and development of the .338 Lapua Magnum&quot; article by Alan C. Paulson. A reverse engineering simulation with QuickLOAD internal ballistic software predicted that Lapua load their factory .338 Lapua Magnum ammunition at about piezo pressure, as Paulson asserts in his article.

The large bolt face combined with the maximum pressure means that the .338 Lapua Magnum is normally only chambered in rifles that are capable of handling such large high-pressure cartridges, and thus high bolt thrust, safely. Chambering such powerful super magnum cartridges in rifles intended for normal magnum rifle cartridges and using high-pressure loads can cause serious or fatal injury to the shooter and bystanders.

The American .338-378 Weatherby Magnum cartridge introduced in 1998 and the American .338 Remington Ultra Magnum (.338 RUM) cartridge introduced in 2000 are probably the closest ballistics-wise to the .338 Lapua Magnum commercially available . The .338-378 Weatherby Magnum is, however, a belted cartridge and the .338 Remington Ultra Magnum is a rebated rim cartridge.

The American SAAMI (Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers&#x27; Institute) has no normal voluntary guidelines for the .338 Lapua Magnum. On 14 January 2013 it opted to use the metric C.I.P. rulings and add some dimensions that have no C.I.P. analog.

==Supersonic range performance of the .338 Lapua Magnum==

===Performance with C.I.P. conforming cartridges===
For a typical .338 Lapua Magnum high-end factory military sniper rifle like the Sako TRG-42 with a long 305 mm (1 in 12 inch) rifling twist rate barrel at sea level, is considered to be the maximum shooting distance for man-sized targets. When using standard Lapua military 16.2 g (250 gr) loads it has a supersonic range of under warm summer conditions at a muzzle velocity of . However, to be able to maintain 80 to 90% hit probability on non-moving reactive army targets, this maximum shooting distance has to be reduced to at freezing point conditions or in Arctic winter conditions, when the muzzle velocity may drop to —i.e. only during optimal warm summer conditions the maximum shooting distance is realistically achievable.

Loaded with more aerodynamic very-low-drag bullets such as the traditionally lead-cored 19.44 g (300 gr) Lapua Scenar GB528 VLD bullet (G1 BC = 0.736) or the Lost River Ballistics J40 .338 17.5 gram (270 gr) CNC manufactured mono-metal bullet (G1 BC = 0.871) the long-range performance and supersonic range of .338 Lapua Magnum rifles can be improved. These longer very-low-drag bullets require a 254 mm (1 in 10 inch) twist rate to stabilize them. Due to the lower practically possible muzzle velocities for a relative heavy bullet like the 19.44 g (300 gr) Lapua Scenar GB528 VLD bullet it gains about extra supersonic range under International Standard Atmosphere sea level conditions (air density ρ = 1.225 kg/m3) at a muzzle velocity of 837 m/s (2750 ft/s) when compared to the standard 16.2 g (250 gr) Lapua Scenar GB488 VLD at a muzzle velocity of 915 m/s (3002 ft/s). For significant supersonic range improvement, the aerodynamic efficiency of the employed bullets has to be significantly improved without sacrificing a lot of practically achievable muzzle velocity - meaning that besides the coefficient of drag of the projectile weight is also an important parameter for its actual downrange flight behavior. The .338 17.5 gram (270 gr) Lost River Ballistic Technologies J40 match bullet made out of a copper-nickel alloy is one of the most aerodynamic .338 calibre bullets available. It has an supersonic range under optimal warm summer conditions at a muzzle velocity of . This makes engaging static targets up to feasible.

===Performance improvement experiments with non-C.I.P.-conforming cartridges===
Improvement beyond this standard while still using standard .338 Lapua Magnum brass is possible, but the bullets have to be very long (over 5.5 calibers in length) and the normal cartridge overall length of 93.5 mm has to be exceeded, making such cartridges wildcats. The common 254 mm (1:10 inch) rifling twist rate also has to be tightened to stabilize very long projectiles. Such commercially non-existent cartridges are termed &quot;wildcats&quot;. The use of a wildcat .338 Lapua Magnum-based cartridge demands the use of a custom or customized rifle with an appropriately cut chamber and fast-twist bore. The firearm action and if a repeating arm is required the magazines must also be able to cope with dimensional increases.

An example of such a special .338 caliber extreme range bullet is the German CNC manufactured mono-metal 18.92 gram (292 gr) LM-105 (Cd = 0.2487 at Mach 2.216 – this drag coefficient and the corresponding G1, G7 and G8 ballistic coefficients are established by Doppler radar measurements). The LM-105 has a supersonic range of ≈ at a muzzle velocity of under International Standard Atmosphere sea level conditions (air density ρ = 1.225 kg/m3). The 2010 version of the LM-105 bullet has an overall length of or 6.33 calibers and derives its exceptionally low drag from a radical LD Haack or Sears-Haack profile in the bullet&#x27;s nose area. Rifles chambered for this wildcat cartridge, with a cartridge overall length of , and equipped with custom made 178 mm (1:7 inch) progressive twist rate long barrels with a 2° cone-angle (the standard C.I.P. cone-angle for the .338 Lapua Magnum is 6°) cone area finished first and second at several long-range competitions. Its most recent win (2007) was in an international special forces and police sniper competition in Switzerland against rifles chambered for 7.62×51mm NATO up to .50 BMG at ranges from 100 m – 1,500 m (109 yd – 1,640 yds). The LM-105 bullet exhibited its very low wind drift susceptibility notably at ranges beyond . A real-world average G1 BC of around 0.83 or a G7 BC of about 0.42 is commonly adopted by the users of this bullet, for making long-range trajectory predictions using ballistics calculators. In contrast the LM-105 designer Lutz Möller originally calculated an optimistic G1 BC of ≈ 0.93 and a supersonic range of ≈ at a muzzle velocity of under International Standard Atmosphere sea level conditions (air density ρ = 1.225 kg/m3).

The .343 Lapua Magnum LM-107 was a wildcat cartridge under development based on the standard .338 Lapua Magnum cartridge case. The LM-107 was hoped to boost the ballistic performance of the LM-105 by achieving an increase in supersonic range. The 19.3 g (298 gr) LM-107 projectile design is long and has a Haack profiled nose and an Adams profiled tail. The rifling twist rate for the .343 Lapua Magnum LM-107 wildcat cartridge was chosen at 180 mm (1:7 inch), Ø lands = 8.72 mm, Ø grooves = 8.45 mm and loaded with the LM-107 projectile has a cartridge overall length of . The length of the neck is increased from 8,31 to 8,50 mm to support the bigger LM-107 bullet. Several other dimensions of the .338 Lapua Magnum parental cartridge are also changed. The shoulder angle gets steepened from 40° to 60° and the body taper is set at 1°. The throat area is set at a 2° cone-angle. All these modifications make the .343 Lapua Magnum a fairly comprehensively revised wildcat cartridge. Out of a long progressive twist barrel Möller expected to achieve muzzle velocity. If Möller&#x27;s design assumptions are correct the LM-107 projectile with a calculated G1 BC of 1.02 will offer a supersonic range of ≈ at a muzzle velocity of under International Standard Atmosphere sea level conditions (air density ρ = 1.225 kg/m3).

==As a parent case==
===.300 Lapua Magnum===
The commercially successful .338 Lapua Magnum cartridge has functioned as the parent case for the .300 Lapua Magnum, which is essentially a necked-down version of the .338 Lapua Magnum. The .338 cartridge case was used for this since it has the capability to operate with high chamber pressures which, combined with smaller and hence lighter bullets, result in very high muzzle velocities.

The Finnish ammunition manufacturer Lapua got the .300 Lapua Magnum C.I.P. certified, so it became an officially registered and sanctioned member of the Finnish &quot;family&quot; of super magnum rifle cartridges. The .300 Lapua Magnum is not commercially available and exists only as a C.I.P. datasheet. It is however still used by a few shooters who produce the cases from .338 Lapua Magnum brass by reshaping the shoulder and neck, and handloading it with .30 calibre bullets.

The .300 Lapua Magnum has a 7.33 ml (113 grains H2O) cartridge case capacity.

.300 Lapua Magnum maximum C.I.P. cartridge dimensions. All sizes in millimeters (mm).

Americans define the shoulder angle at alpha/2 ≈ 25 degrees. The common rifling twist rate for this cartridge is 240 mm (1 in 9.45 in), 4 grooves, Ø lands = 7.62 mm, Ø grooves = 7.82 mm, land width = 4.47 mm and the primer type is large rifle magnum.

According to the official C.I.P. rulings the .300 Lapua Magnum can handle up to Pmax piezo pressure. This prevails over the C.I.P. decisions and tables edition 2007, that rated the .300 Lapua Magnum at Pmax piezo pressure.

The large diameter bolt face, combined with the high maximum pressure, means that the .300 Lapua Magnum is normally only chambered in rifles that are capable of handling the resulting high bolt thrust, safely. Chambering such powerful super magnum cartridges in rifles intended for normal magnum rifle cartridges and using loads can cause serious or fatal injury to the shooter and bystanders.

===7.62 UKM===
The .338 Lapua Magnum cartridge is also used as the parent case for the German-designed 7.62 UKM, which is essentially a necked-down shortened version of the .338 Lapua Magnum. The use of the .338 cartridge case with its capability to operate at high chamber pressures resulted in a magnum case capable of producing high muzzle velocities.

The 7.62 UKM was developed by Michael Uekötter and was C.I.P.-certified in 2002, making it an officially registered and sanctioned member of the Finnish &quot;family&quot; of super magnum rifle cartridges. The 7.62 UKM is not commercially available and exists only as a C.I.P. datasheet. It is however still used by a few shooters who produce the cases from .338 Lapua Magnum brass by reshaping the shoulder and neck, and handloading it with .30 caliber bullets.

The 7.62 UKM has a 5.84 ml (90 grains H2O) cartridge case capacity.

7.62 UKM maximum C.I.P. cartridge dimensions. All sizes in millimeters (mm).

Americans define the shoulder angle at alpha/2 ≈ 20 degrees. The common rifling twist rate for this cartridge is 254 mm (1 in 10 in), 6 grooves, Ø lands = 7.62 mm, Ø grooves = 7.82 mm, land width = 2.79 mm and the primer type is large rifle magnum.

According to the official C.I.P. rulings the 7.62 UKM Magnum can handle up to Pmax piezo pressure. This prevails over the C.I.P. decisions and tables edition 2007, that rated the 7.62 UKM at Pmax piezo pressure.

===.375 Swiss P===
The .375 Swiss P (9.5×7 0mm) is a C.I.P. registered chambering introduced in 2021 and advertised by RUAG Ammotec as a cartridge that &quot;fills the gap in ballistic performance between the .338 Lapua Magnum (8.6×70 mm) and the .50 BMG (12.7×99mm NATO)&quot;. As such, .375 Swiss P was designed to be relatively easily rechambered by a rebarreling as a performance upgrade in sturdily built rifles originally designed around the .338 Lapua Magnum chambering. The .375 Swiss P is a rebated rim bottlenecked cartridge that shares its bolt face, rim diameter, overall length, and maximum operating pressure with the .338 Lapua Magnum chambering. It features a larger base diameter as found in the .500 Jeffery. This results in a (P1 - R1 = ) rebated rim.

===Wildcats===
The .338 Lapua Magnum case is also used as the parent case for a host of modified variants that are not officially registered with or sanctioned by C.I.P. or its American equivalent, SAAMI. By changing the shape of standard factory cases (decreasing case taper or changing the shoulder geometry) the wildcatter generally increases the case capacity of the factory parent cartridge case, allowing more propellant to be used to generate higher velocities. Besides changing the shape and internal volume of the parent cartridge case, wildcatters also can change the original caliber. Because the .338 Lapua offers a large and exceptionally sturdy, pressure-resistant cartridge case that can be relatively easily reloaded and hence be reused several times, it has become quite popular amongst wildcatters. With the .338 Lapua Magnum as the parent case wildcatters have created 7 mm (7 mm Allen Magnum, 7 mm Katzmeier, 7 mm Fatso), .30 (.30-338 Lapua (Triebel), .30 Wolf, 300 Allen Express), 8 mm (8 mm-338 Lapua (Triebel), LM-101), .338 (.338 Yogi, LM-105), .343 (.343 Lapua Magnum LM-107), 9.3 mm (9,3-338 Lapua Magnum (Triebel)), .375 (9.5×70 ELR) and .50 calibre (.510 Whisper) variants. Tom Sarver used a .300 Hulk wildcat cartridge, which is basically a necked-down, blown out, shortened .338 Lapua Magnum variant, to achieve a diameter benchrest five-shot group on 7 July 2007, establishing a world record.

<doc id="689802" wikidata="Q3204093" url="?curid=689802" title="The Jesus Incident">
<text>The Jesus Incident (1979) is the second science fiction novel set in the by the American author Frank Herbert and poet Bill Ransom. It is a sequel to &quot;&quot; (1965), and has two sequels: &quot;The Lazarus Effect&quot; (1983) and &quot;The Ascension Factor&quot; (1988).

== Plot introduction ==
The book takes place at an indeterminate time following the events in &quot;Destination: Void&quot;. At the end of &quot;Destination: Void&quot; the crew of the ship had succeeded in creating an artificial consciousness. The new conscious being, now known as &#x27;Ship&#x27;, gains a level of awareness that allows it to manipulate space and time. Ship instantly transports itself to a planet which it has decided the crew will colonize, christening it &quot;Pandora&quot;. The first book ends with a demand from Ship for the crew to learn how to WorShip or how to establish a relationship with Ship, a godlike being.

The action of the book is divided between two settings, the internal spaces of Ship which is orbiting Pandora and the settlements on the planet. While the original crew of Ship, as described in &quot;Destination: Void&quot;, were cloned human beings from the planet Earth, by the time of &quot;The Jesus Incident&quot;, the crew has become a mixed bag of peoples from various cultures that have been accepted as crew members by Ship when it visited their planet as well as people who have been conceived and born on the ship. Evidently Ship has shown up at a number of planets as the suns of those planets were going nova, the implication being that these planets were other, failed experiments by Ship to establish a relationship with human beings. Ship refers to these as replays of human history, suggesting Ship itself has manipulated human history time and time again.

Ship&#x27;s charge for humans to decide how to WorShip still remains unsatisfied. In the opening chapters, Ship reveals that Pandora will be a final test for the human race. Ship awakens the Chaplain/Psychiatrist Raja Flattery (part of the original &quot;Destination: Void&quot; crew) from hibernation, and reveals to him the true nature of this test. It tasks Flattery with intervening in the society which has developed on Pandora to solve this riddle of WorShip. Flattery is to help the humans to pass Ship&#x27;s test or else risk the destruction of the race. Flattery assumes the name of Raja Thomas to mask his identity from the other shipmen.

The surface of the planet Pandora is 80% seas, and the sea is dominated by a type of kelp which appears to be sentient. The land is overrun by a number of deadly predators that are efficient killers, requiring people on the planet surface to adapt to a highly stressful lifestyle living within a fortress. The main fortress is known as Colony, a small city that is predominantly underground. When &quot;The Jesus Incident&quot; begins there have been three failed attempts at colonization of the surface. The current colony is starting a second colonization site, known as The Redoubt.

In addition to Raja Flattery, several main characters drive the narrative. Morgan Oakes is the head administrator of both the crew and the colonists and the central whose actions drive the conflict. Jesus Lewis is his main assistant as well as a biological engineer. Kerro Panille is a poet who has a special relationship with Ship. Legata Hamill is an administrative assistant and data analyst for Morgan Oakes. The planet Pandora itself with its non-human inhabitants is another main character of the book. As the book progresses, the reader discovers that the kelp, the hylighters, and other creatures of the planet appear to be linked into a large entity with a shared consciousness, Avata.

Jesus Lewis is the manager and chief scientist of Lab One which is a genetic engineering facility that is working on genetically modified clones of human beings in order to develop a class of engineered human beings who can survive the predators of Pandora. The clones are viewed as organic tools much like they were presented in &quot;Destination: Void&quot; where clones are sent out in specially prepared space ships to create an artificial consciousness. There is a clear social distinction between clones and naturally born human beings, a distinction that in the end leads to the outbreak of a series of battles and confrontations (slave rebellions) between natural humans and clones as conflict over food supplies and assignment of risk escalates.

The other major project of Lab One is to create a tool that will eliminate the kelp living in the seas of Pandora. The kelp is viewed by the leadership of the Oakes administration as the major impediment to the exploitation of the seas as a source of food.

==Major themes==
The book deals with concepts such as artificial intelligence, worship, resource allocation, and religious violence. Clones and genetic engineering take up themes of racism. One of the major themes is leadership and how the values of leaders influence a society through the actions and narratives of a society&#x27;s leaders. Another is the nature and definition of God. There are echoes of Herbert&#x27;s exploration of the effect of greed on the leaders within a society and how greedy leaders will warp a society in order to consolidate their own power, a theme in the Dune books as well as &quot;The Dosadi Experiment&quot; (1977).

The book makes several references to &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, as an analogy to the relationship between Ship and humans. The book takes it a step further demanding that humans take responsibility for their creation by realizing Ship is a human artifact and its omnipotence ultimately sprang from human hands. This is what Ship meant when it demanded worShip.

==History==
The novelette &quot;Songs of a Sentient Flute&quot; (1979) from the &quot;Medea&quot; series was the precursor version of &quot;The Jesus Incident&quot;, but the two were set on different planets due to copyright issues, being published by different publishers.

<text>[[Timor-Leste]] is divided into 14 municipalities (, ), which are former districts. One municipality is also a Special Administrative Region (SAR). The municipalities are divided into administrative posts (former subdistricts), and further subdivided into sucos (villages). Atauro Island was initially a part of Dili Municipality, but became a separate municipality on 1 January 2022. The borders between Cova Lima and Ainaro and between Baucau and Viqueque were changed in 2003.

<doc id="689813" wikidata="Q2065751" url="?curid=689813" title="The Augusta Chronicle">
<text>The Augusta Chronicle is the daily newspaper of Augusta, Georgia, and is one of the oldest newspapers in the United States still in publication. The paper is known for its coverage of the Masters Tournament, which is played in Augusta.

==History==

The paper was founded as the weekly &quot;Augusta Gazette&quot; in 1785. In 1786, the paper was renamed &quot;The Georgia State Gazette&quot;. From 1789 to 1804, the paper was known as &quot;The Augusta Chronicle and Gazette of the State&quot;. Patrick Walsh, later a U.S. Senator, joined the editorial staff in 1866 and became owner in 1873.

In 1945, former bookkeeper William Morris, Jr. bought a controlling interest in the paper. This was the beginning of Morris Communications, headquartered in Augusta with the &quot;Chronicle&quot; as its flagship.

In addition to a daily online edition, the entire archives back to its founding have been made searchable on the Internet.

On 9 August 2017, it was announced that &quot;The Augusta Chronicle,&quot; along with Morris Communications&#x27; entire newspaper division and various periodicals, would be sold to GateHouse Media for $120 million in a deal expected to close on October 2. Stephen Wade and Billy Morris will retain their roles as president and publisher respectively. The Morris family will keep ownership of &quot;The Augusta Chronicle&quot; building and property in downtown Augusta. The sale ended 232 years of local ownership, the last 72 of which had been under the Morris family.

==Subsidiaries==
Newspapers published by the &quot;Chronicle&quot; include &quot;The Columbia County News-Times&quot;, &quot;The Hampton County Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Jefferson News-Farmer&quot;, and the &quot;Sylvania Telephone&quot;.

Due to this remark, the network suspended her without pay for two weeks. In 2016, Dash received criticism when she argued that the BET Awards lied to black people about news regarding the boycotting of the Oscars due to lack of ethnic diversity, and called for an end to Black History Month.

On March 11, 2021, Dash stated in an interview with &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, &quot;Being a supporter of Trump has put me in some kind of box that I don&#x27;t belong in. But he&#x27;s not the president. I&#x27;m going to give the president that we have right now a chance.&quot;

==Personal life==

=== Relationships and children ===
Dash has two children. She has a son named Austin, born from her relationship with singer Christopher Williams, and a daughter named Lola. In 1999, she married producer Brian Lovell and they divorced in the mid-2000s. From 2005 to 2006, Dash was married to British executive James Maby, CEO of Sports Logistics. Different sources say the father of Dash&#x27;s daughter is either Lovell or Maby. Dash married actor Emmanuel Xuereb in either 2007 or 2009. She filed for divorce in January 2010.

=== Trauma, drugs, weapons, and legal issues ===
Dash has spoken openly about past traumas in her personal life. She has at various times revealed that she was molested as a child by a family friend, was addicted to cocaine in her teens and 20s, and has a history of being with physically and emotionally abusive partners. Dash has attributed her openness with such topics to her desire to be honest with her children, feeling that being honest is the best way to protect them, and to let them and others know that she is not a victim but a survivor. She is supportive of the right to keep and bear arms, crediting the use of a gun with saving her life after being sexually assaulted at gunpoint by an ex-boyfriend, because she was able to retrieve her own weapon, a .22 revolver, and shot at him, scaring him away.

Dash was arrested on September 29, 2019, at her apartment in Pasco County, Florida, on a domestic battery charge after an argument with her husband, Jeffrey Marty. She pleaded not guilty, and the case was dropped on October 3 at the request of Marty, who said Dash had been arrested over his objection. The couple&#x27;s divorce was announced the following year.

In October 2021, Dash opened up about her Vicodin addiction on &quot;The Dr. Oz Show&quot;, stating that she was five years sober.

The village has a long history, appearing in the Domesday Book in 1086 with the name &#x27;Bacoile&#x27; meaning &#x27;The well back on the hill&#x27;.

The parish was part of the hundred of Hartcliffe.

The lords of the manor from the 12th to 17th centuries were the Rodneys. Walter de Rodney was given the manor for his support of the Empress Matilda against King Stephen.

Backwell House is an historic house in the village which was operated as a boutique hotel between 2016 and 2022.

==Governance==

Backwell has its own parish council, made up of fifteen councillors which have responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council&#x27;s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council&#x27;s role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council.

The parish falls within the unitary authority of North Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. North Somerset Council provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area, including Backwell. Fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the South Western Ambulance Service.
North Somerset&#x27;s area covers the northernmost part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in the town hall in Weston-super-Mare. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was in the Woodspring district of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Long Ashton Rural District.

An electoral ward in the same name exists. The ward stretches from Brockley, through &quot;Backwell&quot; to Barrow Gurney in the east and is represented by Bridget Petty of the Green Party of England and Wales since the 2019 council elections. The total population of this ward taken from the 2011 census was 5,930.

Backwell is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of the North Somerset constituency, which was created in 2010 and first used in the 2010 general election. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, currently Sadik Al-Hassan, a member of the Labour Party.

==Geography==

===Backwell Lake===

Backwell Lake, also known as Buckland&#x27;s Pool, is, despite its name, much closer to nearby Nailsea. The lake was built as a balancing pond in the mid-1970s and has become a wildlife haven for birds, bats and dragonflies, which are attracted by the open water and surrounding vegetation. Bird species include gadwall, shoveler, pochard, tufted duck, grey heron and mute swans.

On 7 January 2018, local people circled the lake, linking hands, to protest against the proposed building of 700 homes and a four-lane link road in the village by Taylor Wimpey, which they believed would affect the lake and its wildlife.

===Quarries===
Stancombe Quarry opened in 1952. Today, the quarry which is operated by Tarmac, produces Carboniferous Limestone, which is mainly for use on the roads, after crushing on site. The site has an expected output of 28 million tonnes over a 25-year period. The now defunct Coles Quarry, in the south of the village, also produced limestone until it was closed by North Somerset Council.

===Climate===
The annual mean temperature is approximately . Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea temperatures. The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately . In winter mean minimum temperatures of are common. In the summer the Azores high pressure affects the south-west of England, however convective cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600 hours. In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton. Most of the rainfall in the south-west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection. Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which is when they are most active. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around . About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August have the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west.

==Recreation==
===Playing Fields===

Backwell Playing Fields is a public park and a collection of sports fields in the western side of Backwell.

On 6 June 1929 Theodore Robinson opened the park to the public and gave it to the &quot;&quot;Children and adults of the parish of Backwell&quot;.&quot; The fields were opened on 6 June 1929 by the then Marquis of Bath, Thomas Thynne.

As the fields were given to the collective people of Backwell, they had, and continue to have, no sole owner. The fields are, however, managed and maintained by a team of directors of the Backwell Playing Fields Charity.

The fields are often used for playing football, mainly for Ashton and Backwell United FC&#x27;s home games, as the club&#x27;s home and stadium is at the Playing Fields. Other sports grounds at the Fields are Backwell Tennis Club, West Backwell Bowling Club, and Backwell Judo Club. The fields are also home to a youth club. 1st Backwell Scouts hut is just outside the park boundaries, but the fields are used a lot by them for their outdoor activities.

===Sports===
Ashton &amp; Backwell United F.C. was originally called Backwell United but then merged with one of Bristol&#x27;s largest youth club&#x27;s Ashton Boys FC. They are currently members of the Western League First Division. They moved to their current home in 1947, the Backwell Recreation Ground.

Backwell Karate, also known as Backwell Shotokan Karate Club, was established in the village in 1978 and is a member club of Bristol Karate Academy and the Japan Karate Shoto Federation governing body.

Backwell Golf Club (now defunct) first appeared during the 1890s, and closed prior to World War 1. Tall Pines Golf Club was founded in 1989, and is located in Downside, adjacent to Bristol Airport.

It is nowadays managed by Great Western Railway. The station has regular services between , and Cardiff, as well as some peak services directly to and from London Paddington.

The tower at the west end of the church is over tall and dates from the 15th century. It contains a ring of eight bells, two of which are medieval.

The font dates from the 12th century. It consists of a circular bowl with cable moulding, and a circular stem with foliate moulding on the base. It was restored in 1907.

West Town Methodist is a Wesleyan Zion chapel on the A370 road in Backwell West Town. It was renovated from a house in 1853 when ten Methodist Backwell residents clubbed together to purchase it and renovate it into the chapel. The church underwent an interior renovation in 1992 which saw a doubling in membership.

<text>The Northwestern Hawaiian Islands also known as the Leeward Hawaiian Islands, are a series of islands and atolls located northwest of Kauai and Niihau in the Hawaiian island chain. Politically, these islands are part of Honolulu County in the U.S. state of Hawaii, with the exception of Midway Atoll. Midway Atoll is a territory distinct from the State of Hawaii, and is classified as one of the United States Minor Outlying Islands. The United States Census Bureau designates this area, excluding Midway Atoll, as Census Tract 114.98 of Honolulu County. The total land area of these islands is 3.1075 square miles (8.048 km²). With the exception of Nihoa, all these islands lie north of the Tropic of Cancer, making them the only islands in Hawaii situated outside the tropics.

The Northwestern Hawaiian Islands are part of the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, a globally significant marine conservation area. They are home to endangered species like the Hawaiian monk seal and green sea turtle and hold cultural importance for Native Hawaiians. Geologically, they are the oldest in the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain, shaped by volcanic activity and erosion over millions of years.

The Northwestern or Leeward Hawaiian Islands include
*Nihoa (Moku Manu) at 
*Necker (Mokumanamana) at 
*French Frigate Shoals (Kānemilohai) at 
*Gardner Pinnacles (Pūhāhonu) at 
*Maro Reef (Nalukākala) at 
*Laysan (Kauō) at 
*Lisianski (Papaāpoho) at 
*Pearl and Hermes Atoll (Holoikauaua) at 
*Midway Atoll (Pihemanu) at - not part of the State of Hawaii
*Kure Atoll (Mokupāpapa) at 

==The islands==
* Nihoa is the youngest of the NWHI, and the tallest, with vertical cliffs. It is the southwestern remnant of the island&#x27;s former volcanic cone. Ancient Hawaiians might have stayed here long-term.
* Necker Island is hook-shaped and tall at its summit. Barren of vegetation, it was used by Ancient Hawaiians for religious purposes, but not for long-term habitation.
*French Frigate Shoals is an atoll, the largest region of coral reefs in Hawaii, at . The atoll is composed of a dozen or so small islands, one of which (Tern Island) contains an airport and human habitations.
*Gardner Pinnacles is made up of two small basalt peaks, the last rocky island in Hawaii. While the island itself is tiny, the surrounding reef is expansive and diverse.
* Maro Reef is an extremely fertile reef system that has been described as a &quot;coral garden&quot;.
*Laysan is a , low, sandy island with a natural lake in its interior, one of only five such lakes in Hawaii. It has arguably the most diverse ecosystem in the NWHI, and hosts about two million seabirds of seventeen species.
*Lisianski Island, only , is geologically akin to Laysan, without the lake. Though the island is slightly less biodiverse, the surrounding reef is very fertile.
*Pearl and Hermes Atoll is an atoll very similar to French Frigate Shoals, but with much less dry land. For this reason, it was mostly ignored by guano miners and feather hunters.
*Midway Atoll is the most commonly known of the NWHI, and is also the largest. The Battle of Midway was fought here and in its surrounding waters, and the island remains permanently inhabited, albeit by persons who are there in consequence of their service with the United States Government, not an indigenous population.
*Circular Kure Atoll contains the Green Island, which used to host a LORAN station and a runway, but these have since been decommissioned. Kure is one of the less biodiverse islands of the NWHI.
Other islands or reefs were previously mapped as part of this chain but are now considered to be either phantom islands or misidentifications of existing islands. The following reefs continued to appear on maps as late as 1934:
*Two Brothers Reef, site of the 1823 &quot;Two Brothers&quot; shipwreck, originally placed west of French Frigate Shoals but later proven to be identical with the latter.
*&quot;Krusenstern Reef,&quot; &quot;Krusenstern Rock,&quot; or &quot;Krusenstern Island&quot; was a phantom reef at , south of Lisianski Island; an investigation in 1923 declared it nonexistent.

As late as 1960, a German globe showed islands west of Kure Atoll that had long been proven nonexistent:
*Byers&#x27;s Island
*Morrell&#x27;s Island

==Geology==
The Northwestern Hawaiian Islands were formed approximately 7 to 30 million years ago, as shield volcanoes over the same volcanic hotspot that formed the Emperor Seamounts to the north and the Main Hawaiian Islands to the south. As the Pacific Plate moved north and later northwest over the hot spot, volcanic eruptions built up islands in a linear chain. The isolated land masses gradually eroded and subsided, evolving from high islands in the south, much like the Main Islands of Hawaii, to atolls (or seamounts) north of the Darwin Point. Each of the NWHI are in various stages of erosion. Nihoa, Necker, and Gardner Pinnacles are rocky, basalt islands that have not eroded enough to form an atoll, or that lack a substantial coral reef. Laysan and Lisianski are low, sandy islands that have been eroded longer. French Frigate Shoals, Pearl and Hermes, Midway, and Kure are atolls.

North of the Darwin Point, the coral reef grows more slowly than the island&#x27;s subsidence, and as the Pacific Plate moves northwest, the island becomes a seamount when it crosses this line. Kure Atoll straddles the Darwin Point, and will sink beneath the ocean when its coral reef cannot keep up with the rate of subsidence, a destiny that awaits every Hawaiian island.

==Biodiversity and endemism==
The Hawaiian Islands are about from North America and from Asia, and it is because of this isolation that the Hawaiian Islands have extraordinary numbers of unique species. Only a species that could fly or swim immense distances could reach the archipelago. But whereas Polynesians, and later, Europeans, have largely altered the ecosystem of the Main Hawaiian islands by introducing alien species, the ecosystems of the NWHI remain, for the most part, intact. The extensive coral reefs found in Papahānaumokuākea are home to over 7,000 marine species. Of the many species that live here, over 1,700 species of organisms are endemic to the Hawaiian Islands (i.e., they are found nowhere else). For this reason, the region has been dubbed &quot;America&#x27;s Galápagos&quot;.

Though not subject to nearly as much extinction as the main islands, the Leeward Islands have had their share of abuse. From the late 19th to the early 20th centuries, fishermen, guano miners, and feather hunters killed most of the birds and sea life living in the NWHI. Rabbits were introduced to Laysan and Lisianski, where they multiplied and devoured most of the vegetation, permanently extinguishing several species. However, most of the damage was reversed, and the islands were restored largely to their pre-exploitation state.

=== Important Bird Area===

The NWHI has been recognized as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because of its seabirds and endemic landbirds. The seabird colonies in the IBA form one of the largest assemblages of tropical seabirds in the world, with over 14 million birds of 21 species.

Some of the endemic species of the NWHI include the Nihoa and Laysan finch, the Laysan duck (the &quot;rarest native waterfowl in the United States&quot;), and the Nihoa fan palm. Other notable species are the Laysan albatross, the highly endangered Hawaiian monk seal, and the green sea turtle. The only native trapdoor spiders in the Hawaiian archipelago (&quot;Nihoa&quot; spp.), recently discovered, are found here. Most endemic species are highly vulnerable to extinction as one major catastrophic event could wipe out all of the vegetation on each small island. Additionally, seventy percent of all coral reefs in the United States are found here.

==Climate==

The Northwestern Hawaiian Islands have a dry-summer tropical savannah climate, &quot;As&quot; in the Köppen climate classification system. In the driest month (May), they receive less than of precipitation and also less than formula_1 mm of precipitation. These are the thresholds separating a tropical savanna climate from a tropical monsoon or rainforest climate.

Because of their small size, rainfall and temperature are more consistent across and within these islands than in the larger Windward Islands (the main islands) of Hawaii. The sea swell is much larger in the winter. Total precipitation averages about 500 to 750 millimeters (20 to 30 inches) per year.

==Exploration==
Archeological evidence suggests ancient Hawaiians visited but did not live on Mokumanamana (Necker) and French Frigate Shoals, and the islands were deserted when Europeans arrived in the 18th century. Agricultural terraces indicate Hawaiians lived on Nihoa for extended periods of time. Mokumanamana lacks vegetation and is unsuitable for agriculture, and archeological studies indicate early Hawaiians only visited and used the island for religious purposes.

The first of the Leeward Isles to be discovered by Europeans was Nihoa. James Colnett discovered it in 1786, although historically the credit has gone to William Douglas. Later that year, La Pérouse discovered Necker, and named it for Jacques Necker, the French Minister of Finance. La Pérouse then went on to discover French Frigate Shoals. The last of the NWHI to be discovered was Midway Atoll, which was found by N.C. Middlebrooks in 1859. In 1925, the Tanager Expedition travelled to many of the NWHI. The islands were mapped, new species were discovered and described, and the archeological sites on Nihoa and Necker were found.

===Naming system===
Most of the islands have several names: one in English and one or more in Hawaiian (indicated in parentheses above). The majority of the Hawaiian names used as alternatives to the English ones were created in modern times; the original names that ancient Hawaiians gave to all of these islands that they encountered prior to Western contact are found in various oli (chants) and moʻolelo (stories).

==National Monument==
On June 15, 2006, American President George W. Bush issued a public proclamation creating Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument under the Antiquities Act of 1906. The Monument encompasses the islands and surrounding waters, forming the largest marine wildlife reserve in the world. President Theodore Roosevelt had declared the Northwestern Hawaiian chain a bird sanctuary in 1909, and the islands had been protected since 2000 with a designation as an &#x27;ecosystem reserve&#x27; by President Bill Clinton, but increasing it to national monument status provides unprecedented control. of ocean was at that time set aside for protection, about the size of the U.S. state of California.

In August 2016, President Barack Obama expanded the area of the monument by roughly four times. The expanded monument was at that time the world&#x27;s largest marine protected area.

Entry to the Monument is limited through a permit system, jointly administered by NOAA, FWS, and the state of Hawaii. Anyone who comes to the islands must follow stringent procedures designed to prevent any stray species from entering and disrupting the ecosystem. All clothes must be bought new, and kept wrapped until before arrival. In fact, all &quot;soft&quot; items (camera strap, blanket) must be bought new, and all &quot;hard&quot; items (camera, binoculars) must be cleaned thoroughly. Then, every item must be frozen for 48 hours. A new set of equipment must be prepared for each island one is going to, to prevent inter-island species introduction. However, French Frigate Shoals and Midway Atoll are exempted from these rules, as they are deemed too altered by humans already to worry about introducing new species.

<text>Seam bowling is a bowling technique in cricket, in which the ball is deliberately bowled to hit the ground on its seam, to cause a random deviation when it bounces. A bowler who uses this technique is called a seam bowler or seamer.

Seam bowling is a form of fast bowling, although seam can also be a factor in medium-pace bowling. Although there are specialist seamers that make deliberate use of off cutter and leg cutter at the expense of bowling slower than regular fast bowlers, most bowlers employ the seam to some effect and so the terms &quot;seamer&quot; and &quot;fast bowler&quot; are largely synonymous. This was far less the case in the past, even the recent past. Bowlers such as Tom Cartwright and Derek Shackleton bowled seamers at a pace in the low 70mphs and were very successful due to their mastery of control and variation.

== Physics ==

A cricket ball is not a perfect sphere. The seam of the ball is the circular stitching which joins the two halves of the cricket ball. Hence, the seam joining the pieces of leather is circumferential and the stitching is noticeably raised. If the ball is bowled in such a way that the seam hits the pitch when it bounces, this irregularity can cause the ball to deviate sideways in its path. It may move in any direction, or just go straight. The batter has to see how the ball moves after pitching to select their shot.

In order to achieve this effect, a seam bowler usually delivers the ball with the seam held upright, with rotation about a horizontal axis. This keeps the seam aligned vertically as it travels towards the batter, making it likely that the ball will bounce with the seam on the pitch. Consistently hitting the seam is not as easy as it sounds. The seam has to be held upright between the index finger and the middle finger at the time of the delivery of the ball and, most importantly, the wrist has to be dead straight when the ball is delivered. The seam and wrist position of Australia&#x27;s Glenn McGrath and India&#x27;s Mohammed Shami are arguably a perfect example.

The direction and degree of the ball&#x27;s deviation from a straight path are dependent on the small-scale alignment of the seam and any irregularities in the pitch surface. This means that deviation caused by seam is chaotic and unpredictable.

However, it is also possible, by holding the seam at an angle and rolling the fingers over the surface of the ball, to produce a deliberate off cutter in which the ball veers away from the off side when it bounces on the pitch, or leg cutter in which it veers away from a right-handed batter. Former Australian bowler Dennis Lillee employed a leg cutter of this sort to considerable effect; however, deliveries of this kind will be slower than if the bowler simply bowls with the seam upright, hoping for movement one way or the other. Some bowlers deliberately use cutters more for their surprise slowness than the deviation off the pitch.

Often the deviation caused by seam is not large enough to cause a batter significant problems with playing the ball. Occasionally, however, the ball can deviate far enough to hit the edge of the cricket bat instead of the middle, producing a catch for nearby fielders. Swing bowling is a way of getting greater deviation, but is harder to control.

Australian fast-medium bowler Glenn McGrath has used his seaming ability to great effect in his career. The ball &#x27;seams&#x27; at its best at the start of a team&#x27;s innings, when the ball is new. A pitch which has cracks in it may assist a seam bowler as well.
The genuine &#x27;Yorker&#x27; may be used by seam bowlers, but bounces (&#x27;pitches&#x27;) so close to the batter&#x27;s feet that it has no opportunity to deviate from its original line.

Another good example of seam bowling technique are the fast bowlers Courtney Walsh and Wasim Akram. Both used a forward wrist flick that imparted back-spin to the ball as it left the hand. However, significantly, their choice of finger position causes the ball to exhibit precession (similar to a gyroscope), with the seam remaining broadly upright but oscillating repeatedly between a 5 o&#x27;clock and 7 o&#x27;clock position (if viewed from the bottom of the seam). This effectively destroys seam induced swing (as the ball is constantly changing between outswing and inswing seam positions through the air). Thus, the ball travels straight onto the pitch (in theory allowing the bowler to be more accurate). However, when the seam of the ball contacts the pitch at the 5 o&#x27;clock position, the result is movement to the left (away to the right-handed batter), when the seam of the ball contacts the pitch at the 7 o&#x27;clock position, the result is movement to the right (in to the right-handed batter). It can be seen that only rarely would the ball be at the purely 6 o&#x27;clock position to continue completely straight after pitching. This aligns with the unpredictable nature of seam bowling, but appears primarily driven by the technique of the bowler, rather than irregularities in the pitch surface.

<text>Casey Affleck (born Caleb Casey McGuire Affleck-Boldt; August 12, 1975) is an American actor. He is the recipient of various accolades, including an Academy Award, a British Academy Film Award, and a Golden Globe Award. The younger brother of actor Ben Affleck, he began his career as a child actor, appearing in the PBS television film &quot;Lemon Sky&quot; (1988). He later appeared in three Gus Van Sant films: &quot;To Die For&quot; (1995), &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; (1997), &quot;Gerry&quot; (2002), and in Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s &quot;Ocean&quot;″s film series (2001–2007). His first leading role was in Steve Buscemi&#x27;s independent comedy-drama &quot;Lonesome Jim&quot; (2006).

Affleck&#x27;s breakthrough came in 2007, when he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as Robert Ford in the Western drama &quot;The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford&quot; and starred in his brother&#x27;s crime drama &quot;Gone Baby Gone&quot;. In 2010, he directed the mockumentary &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot;. He went on to appear in &quot;Tower Heist&quot; (2011), &quot;ParaNorman&quot; (2012), and &quot;Interstellar&quot; (2014), and he received praise for his performance as an outlaw in &quot;Ain&#x27;t Them Bodies Saints&quot; (2013).

In 2016, Affleck starred in the drama &quot;Manchester by the Sea&quot;, in which his performance as a grieving man earned him the Academy Award for Best Actor. He has since starred in the dramas &quot;A Ghost Story&quot; (2017) and &quot;The Old Man &amp; the Gun&quot; (2018), and as Boris Pash in the biographical thriller &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; (2023), his highest-grossing release.

== Early life and education ==
Caleb Casey McGuire Affleck-Boldt was born on August 12, 1975, in Falmouth, Massachusetts, to Christine Anne &quot;Chris&quot; Boldt and Timothy Byers Affleck. The surname &quot;Affleck&quot; is of Scottish origin. He also has Irish, German, English, and Swedish ancestry. Affleck&#x27;s maternal great-great-grandfather, , known for the discovery of the Curmsun Disc, emigrated from Prussia in the late 1840s. His mother was a Radcliffe College- and Harvard-educated elementary school teacher. His father worked sporadically as an auto mechanic, a carpenter, a bookie, an electrician, a bartender, and a janitor at Harvard University. In the mid-1960s, he had been a stage manager, director, writer and actor with the Theater Company of Boston. During Affleck&#x27;s childhood, his father was &quot;a disaster of a drinker&quot;. Affleck first started acting by &quot;reenacting what was happening at home&quot; during role play exercises at Alateen meetings.

After his parents divorced when he was nine, Affleck and his older brother, Ben, lived with their mother and visited their father weekly. He learned to speak Spanish during a year spent traveling around Mexico with his mother and brother when he was ten. At the time, his brother Ben was filming The Second Voyage of the Mimi, which was set in Mexico. The two brothers spent &quot;all of our time together, pretty much. Obviously at school we were in different grades, but we had the same friends.&quot; When Affleck was fourteen, his father moved to Indio, California, to enter a rehabilitation facility, and later worked there as an addiction counselor. He reconnected with his father during visits to California as a teenager: &quot;I got to know him, really, because he was sober for the first time ... The man I knew before that was just completely different.&quot;

Growing up in a politically active, liberal household in Central Square, Cambridge, Affleck and his brother were surrounded by people who worked in the arts, were regularly taken to the theater by their mother, and were encouraged to make their own home movies. The brothers sometimes appeared in local weather commercials and as film extras because of their mother&#x27;s friendship with a local casting director. Affleck acted in numerous high school theater productions while a student at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School. He has said he &quot;wouldn&#x27;t be an actor&quot; if not for his high school theater teacher Gerry Speca: &quot;He kind of turned me on to acting, why it can be fun, how it can be rewarding.&quot;

At age eighteen, Affleck moved to Los Angeles for a year to pursue an acting career, and lived with his brother and their childhood friend Matt Damon. Despite having &quot;the best possible first experience&quot; while filming &quot;To Die For&quot;, he spent much of the year working as a busboy at a restaurant in Pasadena. He decided to move to Washington, D.C., to study politics at George Washington University. He soon transferred to Columbia University in New York City, where he followed the Core Curriculum for a total of two years. However, he did not graduate: &quot;I would do a semester of school, go do a movie ... Opportunities kept presenting themselves that were hard for me to turn down ... By then, I didn&#x27;t really have roots at the school or a group of friends.&quot;

==Career==
===1988–2006: Early work===
Affleck acted professionally during his childhood due to his mother&#x27;s friendship with a Cambridge-area casting director, Patty Collinge. In addition to local weather commercials and film extra work, he appeared as Kevin Bacon&#x27;s brother in the PBS television film &quot;Lemon Sky&quot; (1988), directed by Collinge&#x27;s husband Jan Egleson, and as a young Robert F. Kennedy in the ABC miniseries &quot;The Kennedys of Massachusetts&quot; (1990). These early acting experiences &quot;meant nothing more than a day off from school&quot; to Affleck, and he only began to consider a career as an actor when in high school. When he later moved to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career in earnest, his first film role was as a sociopathic teenager in Gus Van Sant&#x27;s 1995 satirical comedy &quot;To Die For&quot;. During filming in Toronto, Affleck shared an apartment with co-star Joaquin Phoenix and they became close friends. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised Affleck&#x27;s performance, saying he &quot;skillfully capture[s] the pang of adolescence among no-hopers.&quot; However, Affleck then had a &quot;disappointing&quot; experience while making the 1996 drama &quot;Race the Sun&quot; and, &quot;as soon as the film finished, I went to school.&quot;

While studying at Columbia, Affleck had a supporting role in Van Sant&#x27;s &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; (1997), written by his brother and their childhood friend Matt Damon. Despite arranging a first meeting between Van Sant and his brother to discuss the project, Affleck was reluctant to leave college temporarily to act in the film. He was eventually persuaded to play one of four friends living in South Boston – a role written specifically for him – and improvised many of his lines. Jay Carr of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; praised the &quot;emotional subtleties and variety&quot; of the performances, and singled out &quot;Casey Affleck&#x27;s junior member of the quartet, dying to be taken as seriously as the others.&quot; Following the film&#x27;s success, Affleck&#x27;s career opportunities did not significantly improve. At the same time, his life became exposed to the public and parts of his life became &quot;part of pop culture and public life.&quot; Also in 1997, he had a small role in Kevin Smith&#x27;s &quot;Chasing Amy&quot;, starring his brother. He returned to university for a semester before quitting to focus on his acting career.

Affleck&#x27;s career entered a &quot;dark&quot; period, with a series of supporting roles in critical and commercial failures. He later remarked: &quot;It dawned on me late that I should be selective about what I do.&quot; In the independent comedy &quot;Desert Blue&quot; (1998), he starred opposite Kate Hudson as a small-town jock. Peter Stack of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; felt that, while &quot;interesting&quot;, his character was &quot;entirely underdeveloped&quot;. In 1999, he made an uncredited appearance in the teen comedy &quot;American Pie&quot; and appeared as a punk rocker romantically involved with both Gaby Hoffmann and Christina Ricci&#x27;s characters in the New Year&#x27;s Eve ensemble comedy &quot;200 Cigarettes&quot;. In the comedy &quot;Drowning Mona&quot; (2000), starring Danny DeVito, Affleck played a shy gardener suspected of murder. Elvis Mitchell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; acknowledged, in an otherwise negative review, that his role was &quot;well played&quot;. Also in 2000, Affleck had a small role in the comedy &quot;Attention Shoppers&quot; and played Fortinbras in Ethan Hawke&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;. He appeared as the brother of Heather Graham&#x27;s character in the romantic comedy &quot;Committed&quot; (2000), with Emanuel Levy of &quot;Variety&quot; praising a &quot;terrific&quot; performance. Also in 2001, he had a small role in &quot;American Pie 2&quot; and appeared in the teen slasher film &quot;Soul Survivors&quot;. Robert Koehler of &quot;Variety&quot; found him &quot;bland&quot; while Carla Meyer of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; said that he did not make &quot;much of an impression, [but may] have been too depressed to really act.&quot; One positive experience Affleck had during this period was working with Van Sant and cinematographer Harris Savides on &quot;Finding Forrester&quot; (2000) as Van Sant&#x27;s assistant and technical consultant: &quot;Can you imagine a better film school than that? Gus is not only somebody who I love a lot but is also who has taught me, maybe more than anybody else in film.&quot;

Affleck found a degree of commercial success when he was cast in Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s heist comedy &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot; (2001), starring George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Damon. In roles Soderbergh originally intended for Luke Wilson and Owen Wilson, Affleck and Scott Caan played Mormon brothers and wisecracking mechanics who help to rob three Las Vegas casinos simultaneously. While it was a &quot;great, fun social experience&quot;, Affleck spent much of his time on set &quot;being, like, 100 feet away from the camera in the background.&quot; He would later reprise his role in &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Twelve&quot; (2004) and &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Thirteen&quot; (2007).

In 2002, Affleck and Damon starred in Van Sant&#x27;s experimental drama &quot;Gerry&quot;, playing two men who get lost while hiking in the desert. Affleck, Damon, and Van Sant conceived of the idea and wrote the screenplay together while living in neighboring New York apartments. The film, which had minimal dialogue, received mixed reviews. Affleck, who rarely watches his own films, said of &quot;Gerry&quot; in 2016: &quot;That was an incredible experience. I saw one scene recently out of context at the Telluride Film Festival and I can&#x27;t believe anyone ever sat through the whole thing. It probably works better as a whole but one scene lifted out – I thought, &#x27;This is unbearable!&#x27;&quot; Also in 2002, Affleck starred with Damon and then-girlfriend Summer Phoenix in a West End stage production of Kenneth Lonergan&#x27;s &quot;This Is Our Youth&quot;. Lonergan and Affleck became friends during rehearsals, and Affleck later acted in workshop productions of Lonergan&#x27;s plays in New York.

Affleck&#x27;s first leading role was in 2006&#x27;s little-seen independent comedy-drama &quot;Lonesome Jim&quot;, directed by Steve Buscemi. He played a depressed writer who returns from New York to live with his parents in Indiana, and begins a relationship with Liv Tyler&#x27;s character. Buscemi has said he knew Affleck would be able to carry the film after watching his performance in &quot;Gerry&quot;. Stephen Hunter of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; remarked: &quot;Affleck&#x27;s interesting .. He probably can&#x27;t be a star in big movies because his drawback is a voice that sounds like a snivel drawn through a wet nasal passage into a whine ... And yet in certain kinds of films – this kind – he&#x27;s 100 percent authentic.&quot; Ty Burr of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; said Affleck &quot;gets so far under the skin of this semi-charming jerk that the performance becomes both brave and aggravating.&quot; However, Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt it &quot;would be a stronger movie if Mr. Affleck had the wherewithal to bare more of the passive-aggressive rage inside ... a more resourceful actor would have used this blank slate to scrawl a thousand telling details.&quot; Also in 2006, he had a supporting role in the romantic comedy &quot;The Last Kiss&quot; as a friend of Zach Braff&#x27;s character.

===2007–2012: Breakthrough===
Affleck had a breakthrough year in 2007, with the release of two films featuring critically acclaimed performances. The first of these performances was in the Western drama &quot;The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford&quot;, in which he played Robert Ford to Brad Pitt&#x27;s Jesse James. Affleck auditioned repeatedly for the role. While the director Andrew Dominik had seen Affleck in &quot;Gerry&quot;, he cast him partly because of his &quot;beautiful-sounding voice. The voice is the thing that really gets you.&quot; Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Affleck&#x27;s performance as a &quot;revelation&quot; which &quot;manages to make the character seem dumb and the actor wily and smart.&quot; Similarly, Claudia Puig of &quot;USA Today&quot; declared him a &quot;real revelation [who] perfectly inhabits the role&quot; while Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; said Affleck made &quot;an indelible impression as the insecure, physically unprepossessing weakling.&quot; Dana Stevens of &quot;Slate&quot; said &quot;the movie belongs to Affleck [who] goes for broke in a wonderfully brave and weird performance as the craven naif Bob. Somehow he makes us want to flee this creep at top speed, even as we pray no harm will come to him.&quot; For his performance, Affleck was nominated for the Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award and Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

While he was filming &quot;The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford&quot; in Calgary, Affleck was visited by his brother, who offered him the leading role in his directorial project, the Boston crime thriller &quot;Gone Baby Gone&quot; (2007). While his brother was a first-time director and in the midst of a career downturn, Affleck had confidence in the project: &quot;I felt like I knew him better than anyone else did.&quot; His performance, as an inexperienced private investigator tasked with finding a missing child, earned Affleck further plaudits for his acting. Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said: &quot;I&#x27;m not sure exactly when Casey Affleck became such a good actor ... Most actors want you to love them, but [he] doesn&#x27;t seem to know that, or maybe he doesn&#x27;t care.&quot; Jim Ridley of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; described him as &quot;a major talent coming into his own&quot; while Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; remarked that &quot;the revelation is Casey Affleck, who heretofore has been a rather wormy, uncharismatic screen presence.&quot; Ty Burr of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; commented: &quot;I&#x27;d never stopped to consider Casey Affleck as a movie star before, but under his big brother&#x27;s tutelage, he blooms as a leading man of richly watchable savvy and intelligence.&quot;

While &quot;The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford&quot; and &quot;Gone Baby Gone&quot; were, respectively, a financial failure and a modest box office success, Affleck&#x27;s acting career was widely believed to be at a turning point. However, he lost career momentum while directing &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot; (2010), a divisive mockumentary about the musical career of his friend and then brother-in-law Joaquin Phoenix. While Affleck later clarified that it was &quot;a planned, staged and scripted work of fiction&quot;, there was much media speculation during filming about whether Phoenix&#x27;s public behavior was performance art or a genuine breakdown. Claudia Puig of &quot;USA Today&quot; remarked that, &quot;whether truth or folly, it&#x27;s not particularly well made. Even in the midst of Phoenix&#x27;s most oddball and obsessive torment, it&#x27;s boring ... What, exactly, is the point of a joke that nobody really gets?&quot; Ty Burr of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; described it as &quot;an interesting but half-baked exercise in persona deconstruction, celebrity politics, and meta-meta-entertainment ... Parts of it are close to genius; most of it is actively torturous to watch.&quot; Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said the film &quot;turns out to be much more interesting to speculate about than to actually watch.&quot; Reflecting on the experience in 2016, Affleck said: &quot;We never thought people would actually think it was real ... In hindsight, we should have had a press junket and done talk shows and said how it was a mockumentary.&quot;

Affleck used his own money to fund &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot; and, after running out of cash, filming was paused for a month to allow him to play a Texan serial killer in Michael Winterbottom&#x27;s crime drama &quot;The Killer Inside Me&quot; (2010). Affleck later expressed regret over the film&#x27;s graphic violence. Philip French of &quot;The Guardian&quot; found him &quot;disturbingly brilliant&quot; while Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised &quot;a mesmeric, implosively powerful performance.&quot; Mark Olsen of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said Affleck &quot;showcases his uncanny ability to project a person holding two thoughts in his head at once, as he often gives away nothing in his face to convey the firestorm obviously raging in his soul.&quot; Affleck then had a supporting role in the heist comedy &quot;Tower Heist&quot; (2011) and voiced a character in the 2012 animation &quot;ParaNorman&quot;.

===2013–present: Wider recognition===
After spending &quot;a big chunk of time&quot; directing &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot; and dealing with the subsequent backlash, Affleck returned to regular acting work in 2013. &quot;It was ugly for a minute ... I sort of remembered why I liked acting and I missed it.&quot; In David Lowery&#x27;s &quot;Ain&#x27;t Them Bodies Saints&quot; (2013), Affleck and Rooney Mara starred as outlaw lovers in 1970s-era Texas. Affleck was drawn to the opportunity to play a character who &quot;was a much better person than anyone thought&quot;, after a string of roles as &quot;assassins or murderers or just creeps&quot;. Shannon M. Houston of &quot;Paste&quot; described him as the film&#x27;s &quot;standout actor&quot;: &quot;Down to his very jawline, Affleck captures the physicality and feeling of a sincerely romantic outlaw.&quot; Betsy Sharkey of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; remarked: &quot;Affleck plays conflicted souls so very well ... Here you wish for a criminal&#x27;s redemption.&quot; Matt Pais of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; said: &quot;He has great instincts when it comes to morally compromised anti-heroes, and without trolling for our sympathy, Affleck&#x27;s Bob is more than just a collection of behaviors; it&#x27;s a smartly considered performance.&quot; Sebastian Doggart of &quot;The Guardian&quot; said he &quot;shows himself again to be a master of the criminal outsider&quot; while Chuck Wilson of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; found him &quot;flat-out heartbreaking&quot;.

The opportunity to act opposite Christian Bale in the drama &quot;Out of the Furnace&quot; &quot;reinvigorated&quot; Affleck and reminded him why he enjoyed acting. Claudia Puig of &quot;USA Today&quot; found his performance as an Iraq War veteran dealing with posttraumatic stress disorder &quot;completely captivating ... The chemistry between Bale and Affleck is powerful, intensifying the credibility of their brotherly bond.&quot; Matt Pais of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; said Affleck &quot;finds something fierce and noble in uneven material and in his character&#x27;s rage. He&#x27;s not like any other actor in American movies.&quot; Ann Hornaday of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described the performance as &quot;a searing portrayal of a young man who pushes himself to the punishing physical limit in search of both money and catharsis.&quot; Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; remarked that Affleck &quot;can come across as intensely vulnerable on screen, which nicely works for a broken man like Rodney.&quot; In 2014, Affleck and Jessica Chastain had supporting roles in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s science fiction film &quot;Interstellar&quot; as the grown-up children of Matthew McConaughey&#x27;s character, with Todd McCarthy of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; describing his character as &quot;thinly developed&quot;. Also in 2014, Affleck and producer John Powers Middleton launched the production company, The Affleck/Middleton Project.

Affleck starred in three films in 2016, the first two of which underperformed financially. In John Hillcoat&#x27;s crime thriller &quot;Triple 9&quot;, Affleck played an uncorruptible detective. Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; said he &quot;arrests our attention. I wonder if any other screen actor has ever seemed so focused and so distracted at the same time. He thinks more than he says, and so we listen, trying to get the part he&#x27;s leaving out.&quot; Justin Chang of &quot;Variety&quot; described him as &quot;one of the most persuasive leading men of his generation&quot; while Brogan Morris of &quot;Paste&quot; declared him &quot;maybe Hollywood&#x27;s best offbeat leading man ... Few actors can suggest so much with such quiet precision, and even here Affleck is compulsively watchable despite his undercooked character.&quot; In Disney&#x27;s disaster drama &quot;The Finest Hours&quot;, Affleck played a taciturn engineer on board a sinking ship. David Sims of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; said he &quot;gives the kind of measured, thought-out performance he&#x27;s so eminently capable of, even if the film isn&#x27;t complex enough to rise to his level ... He animates an introverted character with subtle mental busywork whenever he&#x27;s on the screen.&quot; Sheri Linden of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; noted that he &quot;manages to turn his man of few words into the movie&#x27;s most compelling figure.&quot;

In his final role of 2016, Affleck starred as Lee Chandler, a grief-stricken loner, in Kenneth Lonergan&#x27;s drama &quot;Manchester by the Sea&quot;. One of the film&#x27;s producers, Matt Damon, initially intended to star in the film. When scheduling conflicts made this unfeasible, Damon agreed to step aside on the condition that he be replaced with Affleck. Lonergan readily agreed, remarking that Affleck was &quot;the natural person to go to.&quot; Affleck had close relationships with both men and had previously offered notes on early drafts of the script. The film was a box office success, and Affleck&#x27;s performance received widespread critical praise. A.O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;one of the most fiercely disciplined screen performances in recent memory. [He] conveys both Lee&#x27;s inner avalanche of feeling and the numb decorum that holds it back.&quot;

Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised his &quot;quietly ferocious performance, his willingness to submerge himself into this character to an almost frightening extent.&quot; Ann Hornaday of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said the film was &quot;anchored by a quietly volcanic central performance by Casey Affleck, in a breathtaking breakout role he&#x27;s long deserved.&quot; David Fear of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stated: &quot;He&#x27;s given impressive turns before [but] the way Affleck gradually shows you the man&#x27;s bone-deep grief and emotional damage makes you believe that one of this generation&#x27;s finest actors has simply been waiting to be coaxed out.&quot; Affleck won the National Board of Review, Critics&#x27; Choice, Golden Globe, BAFTA, and Academy Award for his performance.

After dropping out of Lowery&#x27;s &quot;Pete&#x27;s Dragon&quot; in order to star in &quot;Manchester by the Sea&quot;, Affleck reteamed with the director to star opposite Rooney Mara in the experimental drama &quot;A Ghost Story&quot;, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in early 2017. Affleck&#x27;s character dies suddenly at the outset and he spends much of the film covered by a white sheet with two eye-holes, haunting his former home. David Rooney of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; said Affleck&#x27;s performance managed to resonate despite limited time onscreen. Peter Debruge of &quot;Variety&quot; said Affleck &quot;has never been an easy actor to read. He&#x27;s a low-charisma mumbler who tends to keep his characters&#x27; emotions bottled up, making him the rare performer who can convey as much with a sheet over his head as he does without.&quot; Jordan Hoffman of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described him as &quot;cinema&#x27;s finest mumbler ... I can&#x27;t even tell if he&#x27;s speaking or just emitting high-pitched vibrations anymore.&quot; In 2018, Affleck starred opposite Robert Redford in the outlaw drama &quot;The Old Man &amp; the Gun&quot;, his third collaboration with Lowery.

In 2019, he directed, wrote and starred in the survival drama &quot;Light of My Life&quot;. It had its world premiere at the Berlin International Film Festival on February 8, 2019 and received positive reviews from film critics. Affleck next starred in &quot;Our Friend&quot;, opposite Dakota Johnson and Jason Segel, directed by Gabriela Cowperthwaite, based upon a true story revolving around a couple, whose best friend moves in for support, following a cancer diagnosis. which had its world premiere at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival. Affleck next acted in and produced &quot;The World to Come&quot;, directed by Mona Fastvold alongside Katherine Waterston and Vanessa Kirby. In 2023, Affleck played the supporting role of military intelligence officer Boris Pash in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s biopic &quot;Oppenheimer&quot;.

== Personal life ==

=== Relationships and family ===
Affleck was introduced to actress Summer Phoenix by her brother, Joaquin, in the late 1990s. They began dating in 2000, and acted together in both the 2000 film &quot;Committed&quot; and a 2002 stage production of &quot;This Is Our Youth&quot;. The couple became engaged in January 2004 and married on June 3, 2006, in Savannah, Georgia. They have two sons born in 2004 and 2007. On August 1, 2017, Phoenix officially filed for divorce, citing &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot;, and it was finalized later that year. Affleck has said it was an amicable divorce and that they remain friends.

He has been in a relationship with actress Caylee Cowan since January 2021.

===Alcoholism===
In a 2016 interview, Affleck said that he had been sober for &quot;almost three years ... My father was a disaster of a drinker, my grandmother was an alcoholic, my brother spent some time in rehab – it&#x27;s in our genes.&quot;

=== Political views ===
In 2008, Affleck filmed an episode of documentary series &quot;4Real&quot;, in which he visited the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma, and remarked upon the progress they had made due largely to &quot;their own resourcefulness and determination and their character, and not because of the goodness of our collective heart.&quot; During the 2016 presidential campaign, Affleck supported Hillary Clinton and characterized Donald Trump as &quot;a dangerous fool&quot;. In 2017, multiple financial contributions to Trump were made by Affleck&#x27;s production company, which he co-founded with John Powers Middleton. In a statement, Affleck denied involvement: &quot;I had no knowledge of it, was never asked, and never would have authorized it ... The policies of the Trump administration, and the values they represent, are antithetical to everything I believe in.&quot;

===Sexual harassment allegations===
Affleck has settled two sexual harassment lawsuits out of court for an undisclosed amount.

In 2010, two of his former co-workers from &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot; filed civil lawsuits against Affleck. Amanda White, one of the film&#x27;s producers, sued Affleck for $2 million with multiple complaints including sexual harassment and breach of oral contract. She detailed numerous &quot;uninvited and unwelcome sexual advances&quot; in the workplace. White alleged that Affleck refused to honor the terms of the production agreement, including her fee, in retaliation.

The film&#x27;s cinematographer, Magdalena Gorka, sued Affleck for $2.25 million with multiple complaints including intentional infliction of emotional distress and breach of oral contract. Gorka alleged that she had been subjected to &quot;routine instances&quot; of sexual harassment by crew members including Antony Langdon, &quot;within the presence and with the active encouragement of Affleck.&quot;

Initially, Affleck denied the allegations and threatened to countersue. No countersuits were filed. His lawyer claimed, &quot;Both women left the film in April 2009 and both were refused when they wanted to return&quot;, and &quot;there was no mention of sexual harassment before June [2010].&quot; The film&#x27;s associate producer Nicole Acacio and an unnamed female editor both defended Affleck&#x27;s conduct on set. The lawsuits were later settled out of court. Both women received credit for their work on the project; no details of any financial settlement were released.
Affleck addressed the allegations in a 2016 interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, stating: &quot;It was settled to the satisfaction of all. I was hurt and upset — I am sure all were — but I am over it. It was an unfortunate situation — mostly for the innocent bystanders of the families of those involved.&quot; The allegations and lawsuits attracted scrutiny during the 2016–17 film awards season, when Affleck was recognized for his performance in &quot;Manchester by the Sea&quot;, which culminated in further controversy following his Best Actor win at the 89th Academy Awards. The following year, amidst the Me Too movement, Affleck withdrew from presenting the award for Best Actress at the 90th Academy Awards.

In a 2018 interview with the Associated Press, Affleck discussed the lawsuits and allegations in light of the Me Too movement. He characterized his behavior at the time of the lawsuits as defensive and said he has since worked to understand his own culpability. He remorsefully acknowledged that the set of &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot; was &quot;an unprofessional environment&quot; and that &quot;I contributed to that unprofessional environment and I tolerated that kind of behavior from other people and I wish that I hadn&#x27;t. And I regret a lot of that ... I behaved in a way and allowed others to behave in a way that was really unprofessional. And I&#x27;m sorry.&quot;

== Philanthropy ==
Affleck has been a vegan since 1995. He has been involved with animal rights campaigns for both People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and Farm Sanctuary.

In 2017, Affleck supported the 37th Annual National Veterans Wheelchair Games hosted by Paralyzed Veterans of America. In January 2019, he attended the fourth annual Veterans Awards as a presenter.

In June 2020, Affleck, with his mother Christine, founded a fundraising effort, Stories from Tomorrow. The initiative was co-sponsored by Room to Read, WriteGirl and New Earth, an organization where Affleck is a board member. &#x27;Stories from Tomorrow&#x27; matches original writing by children ages 5–18 with celebrities who read their work, which is then presented in video form. The money raised will be used to ensure that children around the world have access to education and food.

<text>Ivyann Schwan (born November 14, 1983) is an American retired actress. She has starred in the movies &quot;Parenthood&quot; and &quot;Problem Child 2&quot;. She has appeared in various TV shows such as &quot;Bill Nye the Science Guy&quot; and &quot;The Jenny Jones Show&quot;. Schwan has been on stage in such productions as &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;.

Schwan&#x27;s mother, Donna, served as her manager during her child acting career and was also deeply religious, so much so that she turned down an audition for her daughter for the role of Claudia in the film &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; (which eventually went to Kirsten Dunst).

In a 2012 interview, Schwan revealed that she had become a mother.

<text>Eagle Electric Manufacturing Company, founded in 1920, was a maker of electrical devices, switches and circuit units based in Long Island City, New York, in the borough of Queens.

==History==
The company was founded by Louis Ludwig and his younger brother Philip Ludwig both of whose children ran the company after the founders died.

The company&#x27;s New York workers were represented by a union. Picketers were arrested outside the company&#x27;s plant in January 1938.

For many years, Eagle had a giant neon billboard overlooking the Queensboro Bridge that became a familiar sight to motorists. It read, in capitals, &quot;Eagle Electric-Perfection is not an accident&quot;. The slogan was written by founder Louis Ludwig. In 1987, under the direction of Mel Ludwig, the Advertising Manager, Oswald Fernandez began a process of updating the slogan the logo and packaging graphics. When the building was purchased the company had moved production to various parts of the world. As of 2006, Cooper Wiring Devices has moved all their manufacturing out of Long Island City, to Mexico, China, and the south-east United States.

By the early 1980s Eagle Electric was selling thousands of wiring device SKUs to hardware stores across the country. In 1991 Eagle Electric, under the leadership of the Advertising Director, introduced a line of surge protector wiring devices under the brand eSmart, with the strong support of senior management. The eSmart brand was the first trademark with an &quot;e&quot; in front of it. The brand sold well to the big box stores as there was no competitive surge protector line in the industry. Eventually the brand was dismantled by then Marketing Director Jim Cook, because he felt that computers were a &quot;passing fad.&quot; 

The company began to move its production facilities away from New York to Greensboro, North Carolina in the early 1980s and later to Mexico. In 1997, the company announced that a new labor contract and tax abatements had convinced it to keep its operations in New York. But a year later, the company&#x27;s president and some other executives were removed by its board of directors.

In the spring of 2000, Eagle was purchased by Cooper Industries to form Cooper Wiring Devices, Inc. Cooper Wiring Devices is now based in Peachtree City, Georgia. Eaton Corporation bought Cooper Industries in 2012, and Eagle Electric is now known as Eaton Wiring Devices.

<doc id="689865" wikidata="Q542797" url="?curid=689865" title="Administrative divisions of Moldova">
<text>Moldova is divided administratively into two levels:

* First level:
** 32 districts or raions ()
** 3 municipalities (municipii)—specifically Chișinău, Bălți, and Bender
** 2 autonomous territorial units: Gagauzia and Left Bank of the Dniester (&quot;de facto&quot; Transnistria, which is not under control of the government of Moldova)
* Second level:
** Villages (); two or more villages can form together a commune ()
** Sectors
** 10 municipalities (municipii)
** Cities and towns

==Localities==

Moldova has a total of 1,682 localities; from these 982 are incorporated (&quot;de jure&quot; with 982 mayors and 982 local councils), including 53 cities/towns, other 13 cities with municipality status (see municipiu), and 916 rural localities. They cover the entire area of the country. A number of villages are self-governed, while others 700 villages are too small to have a separate administration, and are part of either cities/towns/municipalities (41 of them) or communes (659). Few localities are inhabited.

==Current divisions==
In the administrative-territorial structure of Moldova are 898 second-level administrative territorial units (cities/towns, sectors and villages/communes).

The status of Chișinău, Bălți, and Tighina as municipalities and first-level territorial units of the country allows their suburb villages to have, when large enough, their own mayor and local council. By contrast, the villages that are administratively part of (some of) the other cities do not retain self-rule.

* Districts (32):
* District-level municipalities (3):

* Autonomous territorial units (2):

¹ Tighina and the Administrative-Territorial Units of the Left Bank of the Dniester are under the control of the unrecognized separatist Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR, also known as Transnistria). There, Tighina is known as &quot;Bender&quot;.

===Areas not under central government control===
* Transnistria, which with the exception of six communes (comprising a total of ten localities) corresponds to the geographic part of Moldova situated to the east of the Dniestr (Romanian: &quot;Nistru&quot;) river, is &quot;de jure&quot; a part of Moldova, but in fact is governed by breakaway authorities (&quot;see also: War of Transnistria&quot;). The city of Dubăsari (geographically and administratively in Transnistria, and not in the Dubăsari District), and six communes (administratively in the Dubăsari District of Moldova, and not in the administrative definition of Transnistria), all controlled by the central authorities (except the village of &quot;Roghi&quot; in commune Molovata Nouă, which is controlled by Tiraspol), form the northern part of the security zone set at the end of the war.
* Tighina municipality (the city itself, plus the commune Proteagailovca), and three communes (five localities) of Căușeni District (Gîsca, Chițcani, and Cremenciug) are &quot;de facto&quot; controlled by the breakaway regime of Transnistria. Together with the commune Varnița of Anenii Noi District and the commune Copanca of Căușeni District under Moldovan control, these localities form the southern part of the security zone set at the end of the war. The city of Tighina has both a Moldovan police force (mostly symbolic) and a Transnistrian &quot;militsiya&quot; force (practically in charge in most instances). In Transnistria, Tighina is known as &quot;Bender&quot;.

===Population===
* The smallest entity electing a mayor is the commune of Salcia, in Taraclia District (population 441). It consists of the village of &quot;Salcia&quot;, population 382, and the village of &quot;Orehovca&quot;, population 59. The largest entity is the municipality of Chișinău, electing a mayor for 712,218 inhabitants.
* The largest number of localities governed by a single commune or city government in Moldova is 6. This is the case for:
** city of Anenii Noi, population 11,463, of which 3,105 in the 5 suburban villages
** commune Copăceni, Sîngerei District, population 3,315
** commune Natalievca, Fălești District, population 2,231
** commune Tătărăuca Veche, Soroca District, population 2,203
:On the opposite end, 42 of the 66 cities, and about half the communes of Moldova have local administration providing services for a single locality.
* There are four or five localities in Moldova with a zero population:
** village &quot;Armanca&quot;, commune Vasileuți, Rîșcani District
** village &quot;Chetrișul Nou&quot;, commune Chetriș, Fălești District
** village &quot;Pelinia, loc. st. c. f.&quot;, commune Pelinia, Drochia District
** village &quot;Stălinești&quot;, commune Corestăuți, Ocnița District
:The village of &quot;Schinoasa&quot; was outlined within commune Țibirica, Călărași District in 2007, and information is not available yet whether it has any population.
* Village (hamlet) &quot;Ivanovca&quot;, commune Natalievca, Fălești District, population 19, inhabited by 14 Russians and 5 Ukrainians, is the only inhabited locality in Moldova without any ethnic Moldovans. On the opposite end, one commune, Cigîrleni, Ialoveni District, population 2,411, and 42 villages of sub-commune level (population varying from 1 to 673), have a 100% Moldovan population.

===Duplicate names===
There are 147 settlement names shared by multiple localities in Moldova. Most notable cases includes these:
* A town Mărculești, and a different commune Mărculești, both situated in the Florești District
* A city Dondușeni, and a different commune Dondușeni, both situated in the Dondușeni District
* A city Drochia, and a different commune Drochia, both situated in the Drochia District
* A town Costești, in Rîșcani District, with a population of 2,247 (4,109 with 4 suburb villages), the 8th smallest city in Moldova, and a commune (village) Costești, in Ialoveni District, population 11,128, the 2nd largest village in Moldova
* A town Cornești, in Ungheni District, and a different village Cornești in the same Ungheni District, and also a village Cornești in Hîncești District
* etc.

<doc id="689868" wikidata="Q5608706" url="?curid=689868" title="Grierson's Raid">
<text>Grierson&#x27;s Raid was a Union cavalry raid during the Vicksburg Campaign of the American Civil War. It ran from April 17 to May 2, 1863, as a diversion from Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s main attack plan on Vicksburg, Mississippi.

==Background==
Early in 1863, Major General Charles Hamilton, the commander of the Corinth section of Grant&#x27;s division, suggested what would eventually become Grierson&#x27;s Raid. Subsequently, due to Hamilton&#x27;s insistence on procuring a command that would garner him more glory, Hamilton offered his resignation. Grant quickly accepted.

In the Western Theater of the American Civil War, Confederate cavalry raids under commanders such as Lt. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest and Brig. Gen. John Hunt Morgan had harassed Union expeditions, namely at the Battle of Parker&#x27;s Crossroads, where Forrest captured three hundred Union soldiers under Brig. Gen. Jeremiah C. Sullivan, but lost all of the artillery pieces belonging to his own command. The task of drawing the attention of Confederate raiders away from the Siege of Vicksburg fell to Col. Benjamin Grierson, a former music teacher who disliked horses after being kicked in the head by one as a child. Grierson&#x27;s cavalry brigade consisted of the 6th and 7th Illinois and 2nd Iowa Cavalry regiments.

==The Raid==

Grierson and his 1,700 horse troopers, some in Confederate uniforms serving as scouts for the main force, rode over through hostile territory (from southern Tennessee, through the State of Mississippi and into Union-held Baton Rouge, Louisiana), over routes no Union soldier had traveled before. They tore up railroads and burned crossties, freed slaves, burned Confederate storehouses, destroyed locomotives and commissary stores, ripped up bridges and trestles, burned buildings, and inflicted ten times the casualties they received, all while detachments of his troops made feints confusing the Confederates as to his actual whereabouts, intent and direction. Total casualties for Grierson&#x27;s Brigade during the raid were three killed, seven wounded, and nine missing. Five sick and wounded men were left behind along the route, too ill to continue. Grierson reported to have killed and wounded 100 Confederates, captured 500, destroyed between 50 and 60 miles of railroad, destroyed over 3,000 stands of arms (a rifle plus all its accompanying kit), and captured 1,000 horses and mules.

Confederate States Army Lt. Gen. John C. Pemberton (1814-1881), commander of the Vicksburg garrison on the east bank of the Mississippi River behind heavily fortified trenches, had few cavalry and could do nothing to stop Grierson from rampaging further east in the state&#x27;s interior. Around the same period, on April 21, 1863, Confederate cavalry commander Maj. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest (1821-1877), had however pursued and captured another Union Army cavalry raider, Col. Abel Streight (1828-1892), far further east in Alabama following a different poorly supplied and poorly planned raid (Streight&#x27;s Raid) by the generally more powerful and well-supplied Union Army.

Although many other divergent Confederate Army cavalry units pursued Col. Grierson vigorously across the state (most notably Wirt Adams&#x27; Cavalry Regiment and Robert V. Richardson&#x27;s Tennessee Cavalry), they were unsuccessful in stopping the raid driving southward. Grierson and his troopers, exhausted by days in the saddle, ultimately rode into Union-occupied Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the capital of the state in early May. With an entire division of Pemberton&#x27;s Southern soldiers tied up and dug-in defending the vital Vicksburg-Jackson east/west railroad from the evasive Grierson on mobile horseback, combined with Northern Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman&#x27;s (1820-1891) feint to the northeast of Vicksburg (in the Battle of Snyder&#x27;s Bluff), the beleaguered Confederates were unable to muster the forces necessary to oppose Gen. Grant&#x27;s eventual bypassing landing below Vicksburg on the east side of the lower Mississippi at Bruinsburg.

==In popular media==
The popular Civil War movie &quot;The Horse Soldiers&quot; (1959), directed by noted John Ford, and starring John Wayne, William Holden and Constance Towers, and the Harold Sinclair (1907-1966), earlier novel of historical fiction of the same name published in 1956 on which it is based, are somewhat fictionalized variations of the famous 1863 Grierson&#x27;s Raid and the Battle of Newton&#x27;s Station.

<text>The Akademio de Esperanto (AdE; ) is an independent body of Esperanto speakers who steward the evolution of said language by keeping it consistent with the &quot;Fundamento de Esperanto&quot; in accordance with the Declaration of Boulogne. Modeled somewhat after the Académie française and the Real Academia Española, the Akademio was proposed by L. L. Zamenhof, the creator of Esperanto, at the first World Esperanto Congress, and was founded soon thereafter under the name &quot;Lingva Komitato&quot; (Language Committee). This Committee had a &quot;superior commission&quot; called the &quot;Akademio&quot;. In 1948, within the framework of a general reorganization, the Language Committee and the Academy combined to form the Akademio de Esperanto.

The Akademio consists of 45 members and has a president, vice presidents, and a secretary. The corresponding address including e-mail is at the secretary. It is funded by a subsidy from the Universal Esperanto Association and by donations.

== Members ==

Members are elected by their peers for a period of nine years, with elections being held every three years for a third of the members. Following the last elections in February 2022, the Akademio de Esperanto consists of the following members:

<doc id="689888" wikidata="Q2914501" url="?curid=689888" title="Departments of Niger">
<text>The regions of Niger are subdivided into 63 departments (). Before the devolution program on 1999–2005, these departments were styled arrondissements. Confusingly, the next level up (regions) had, before 2002-2005 been styled departments. Prior to a revision in 2011, there had been 36 departments.
 Until 2010, arrondissements remained a proposed subdivision of departments, though none were used. The decentralisation process, begun in the 1995-1999 period replaced appointed Prefects at Departmental or Arrondissement level with elected councils, first elected in 1999. These were the first local elections held in the history of Niger. Officials elected at commune level are then selected as representatives at Departmental, regional, and National level councils and administration. The Ministry of Decentralisation was created to oversee this task, and to create a national consultative council of local officials.

On 1 August 2011, the National Assembly of Niger approved a law that created 27 new departments centered on the former appointed sub departmental &quot;Postes Administratifs&quot;, bringing the number of departments to 63. The 27 new department capitals are: Aderbissanat, Iférouane, Ingall, Bosso, Goudoumaria, N&#x27;Gourti, Dioundiou, Falmèye, Tibiri, Bermo, Gazaoua, Bagaroua, Tassara, Tillia, Abala, Ayérou, Balléyara, Bankilare, Banibangou, Gothèye, Torodi, Belbédji, Damagaram Takaya, Dungass, Takieta, Tesker. 
The 63 departments are broken down into communes. As of 2006, there were 265 communes, including &quot;communes urbaines&quot; (urban communes: centred in or as subdivisions of cities of over 10000), &quot;communes rurales&quot; (rural communes) centred in cities of under 10,000 and/or sparsely populated areas, and a variety of traditional (clan or tribal) bodies amongst semi-nomadic populations. The former &quot;postes administratifs&quot; (administrative posts) for largely uninhabited desert areas or military zones were incorporated as full departments with borders to be determined.

<text>Nathaniel Lyon (July 14, 1818 – August 10, 1861) was a United States Army officer who was the first Union general to be killed in the American Civil War. He is noted for his actions in Missouri in 1861, at the beginning of the conflict, to forestall secret secessionist plans of the governor Claiborne Jackson.

He had fought in the Second Seminole War in Florida and the Mexican–American War. 

In 1850 he co-led the Bloody Island Massacre of 60–200 Pomo Native American old men, women, and children as part of the wider California genocide. Several days later, Lyon was responsible for another massacre in Cokadjal, killing 75 to 100 Native Americans, albeit the number was likely double. 

After being assigned to Kansas, where many residents were divided about slavery and the Union, he developed strong pro-Union views. In February 1861, Lyon was made commander of the Union arsenal in St. Louis in Missouri, another divided state. Suspicious of governor Jackson, who was working with Jefferson Davis on a secret plan for secession, Lyon forced the surrender of the pro-Confederate militia. 

Some civilians rioted and Lyon&#x27;s troops fired into the crowd, which came to be known as the Camp Jackson Affair. Lyon was promoted brigadier-general and given command of Union troops in Missouri. He was killed at the Battle of Wilson&#x27;s Creek, while trying to rally his outnumbered soldiers. Despite his death during the first year of the war, Lyon&#x27;s efforts prevented the State of Missouri from joining the Confederacy.

==Early life and education==
Nathaniel Lyon was born on July 14, 1818, to Amasa and Kezia Lyon. His father was a sawmill operator who also dabbled in farming, and his mother was related to Revolutionary War hero Thomas Knowlton. Raised on his father&#x27;s farm, Nathaniel performed farm chores as a young child; at an early age he gained a reputation for seriousness and having a short temper. Amasa was strict and not affectionate towards his children, and Nathaniel grew quite close to his mother. Kezia was a devoted Christian, but Amasa tended towards rejecting organized Christianity, raising doubts about religion in Nathaniel&#x27;s young mind. He was educated in the local school system, and briefly attended an academy in Brooklyn, Connecticut. After recommendations from family acquaintances, United States Representative Orrin Holt secured Lyon&#x27;s appointment to the United States Military Academy (West Point) in early 1837.

Lyon officially entered West Point on July 1, 1837, While there, he established a record of good discipline, receiving few demerits, although he received 12 for a single incident in February 1841 related to an incident of insubordination when he angrily refused to turn over his orders to an officer. Academically, he struggled with calculus, drawing, and infantry tactics, but did well in natural philosophy, engineering, and artillery. Lyon&#x27;s cousin Miner Knowlton was an assistant professor at West Point and served as a mentor for him. In 1841, he graduated from West Point ranked number 11th out of 52 cadets. Around this time, Lyon also displayed a romantic affection for a woman known as &quot;Miss Tot&quot;; her identity and the details of the relationship are unknown, but biographer Christopher Phillips suggests that the failure of this relationship may have contributed to Lyon&#x27;s later decision to never marry. Traditionally, higher-ranked graduates of West Point were given the option to enter the United States Corps of Engineers, which was viewed as a desirable assignment, but Lyon instead chose to be assigned to the infantry, where he believed that promotion would come quicker. Briefly returning to Ashford after his graduation, Lyon received a commission as a second lieutenant on July 1.

==Military career==
Upon graduating from West Point, Lyon was commissioned as a 2nd lieutenant and assigned to the 2nd U.S. Infantry Regiment after graduation and served with them in the Seminole Wars and the Mexican–American War. Despite denouncing American involvement in the Mexican War, he was promoted to first lieutenant for &quot;conspicuous bravery in capturing enemy artillery&quot; at the Battle for Mexico City and received a brevet promotion to captain for the battles of Contreras and Churubusco. Although he was eligible for membership, Lyon did not join the Aztec Club of 1847 when it was formed in Mexico City in 1847.

After the Mexican War, Lyon was then posted to the frontier, where forces under his command perpetrated the massacre of Pomo Native Americans at Clear Lake, California, the 1850 &quot;Bloody Island Massacre&quot;; in which as many as 200 old men, women and children were killed. Several days later, Lyon was responsible for another massacre in Cokadjal, killing 75 to 100 people, albeit the number was likely double.

After being reassigned to Fort Riley, Kansas, Lyon became staunchly antislavery. He did not support the radicalism of the abolitionists, and came to support the Republican Party while serving in the border wars known as &quot;Bleeding Kansas.&quot; In January 1861, he wrote about the secession crisis, &quot;It is no longer useful to appeal to reason, but to the sword.&quot;

==American Civil War==
===St. Louis Arsenal===
In March 1861, shortly before the outbreak of the American Civil War, Lyon arrived in St. Louis in command of Company B of the 2nd U.S. Infantry. At the time the population and state of Missouri were relatively neutral in the dispute between North and South, but Governor Claiborne F. Jackson was a strong Southern sympathizer, as were many of the state legislators. Lyon guessed correctly that Jackson would seize the federal arsenal in St. Louis if the state seceded and that the Union had insufficient defensive forces to prevent the seizure.

He attempted to strengthen the defenses, but came into opposition from his superiors, including Brig. Gen. William S. Harney of the Department of the West. Lyon employed his friendship with Francis P. Blair Jr., to have himself named commander of the arsenal. When the Civil War broke out and President Abraham Lincoln called for troops to put down the Confederacy, Missouri was asked to supply four regiments. Governor Jackson refused the request and ordered the Missouri State Guard to muster outside St. Louis under the stated purpose of training for home defense.

===Wide Awakes===

Lyon himself had been extensively involved in the St. Louis Wide Awakes, a pro-union paramilitary organization that he intended to arm from the arsenal and muster into the ranks of the federal army. Upon obtaining command of the arsenal, Lyon armed the Wide Awake units under guise of night. Lyon had most of the excess weapons in the arsenal secretly moved to Illinois. 

Lyon was aware of a clandestine operation whereby the Confederacy had shipped captured artillery from the U.S. arsenal in Baton Rouge to the Missouri State Militia camp in St. Louis. Lyon allegedly disguised himself as a farm woman to spy on the State Guard&#x27;s camp and then claimed that he had uncovered a plan by Jackson to seize the arsenal for Missouri troops.

===Camp Jackson affair===
On May 10 Lyon directed the Missouri volunteer regiments and the 2nd U.S. Infantry to the camp, forcing its surrender. Riots broke out in St. Louis as Lyon marched his prisoners through the city to the St. Louis Arsenal. The event provoked the Camp Jackson Affair of May 10, 1861, in which Lyons&#x27; troops opened fire on a crowd of civilians injuring at least 75 and killing 28. 

Two federals and three militia were also killed and others were wounded. The source of the first shot is disputed, some witnesses claiming it was a drunken rioter, others claiming it was unprovoked. Lyon was nonetheless promoted to brigadier general May 17, and given command over the Union troops in Missouri May 31, 1861 as commander of the Department of the West.

===Planters House Conference===
On June 12, 1861 Lyon (accompanied by Congressman Colonel Francis P. Blair Jr.) met with Governor Jackson and Major General Sterling Price of the Missouri State Guard (who both traveled under a safe conduct from Lyon) at St. Louis&#x27; Planter&#x27;s House hotel to discuss the implementation and potential continuation of the Price–Harney Truce between Federal forces and the State Guard. The discussions were conducted largely between Lyon and Jackson, who were generally intransigent in their respective positions: that U.S. forces had the right to move anywhere in the state, and that Federal forces should be restricted to the St. Louis-area, respectively.

After four unproductive hours Lyon eventually halted the meeting, informing Governor Jackson and MG Price that Jackson&#x27;s demanded limitations on federal authority &quot;means war&quot;. Lyon then allowed the two to leave St. Louis for Jefferson City by train, in accordance with the safe conduct.

===Pursuit of Jackson===
The governor fled first to the capitol at Jefferson City (ordering the tracks destroyed behind him), and then retreated with the State Guard to Boonville. Lyon moved up the Missouri River by steamer and occupied Jefferson City without a fight on June 13. Lyon continued the pursuit and on June 17 he defeated a portion of the State Guard at the Battle of Boonville. The governor, his administration, and the Guard retreated to the southwest.

Lyon was subsequently supported by the reconvened Missouri State Convention which reconvened on July 22, 1861, declared the office of Governor and other state officials &quot;vacant&quot;, and appointed a Unionist provisional state government under former Missouri Chief Justice Hamilton Gamble. Lyon assumed command of the Army of the West on July 2. Lyon reinforced his army before moving southwest in pursuit of Jackson, Price and the State Guard.

===Battle of Wilson&#x27;s Creek and death===
By July 13, Lyon was encamped at Springfield, Missouri, with about 6,000 Union soldiers. The Missouri State Guard, about 75 miles southwest of Lyon and under the command of Price, met with troops under Brig. Gen. Benjamin McCulloch near the end of July. The combined Confederate forces numbered about 12,000, formed plans to attack Springfield, and marched northeast on July 31.

The armies met at dawn a few miles southwest of Springfield on the morning of August 10 in the Battle of Wilson&#x27;s Creek. Lyon was wounded twice in the fighting; shot in the head and leg and his horse shot from under him. He returned to Union lines and commandeered a bay horse ridden by Maj. E.L. McElhaney of the Missouri Infantry. Lyon, badly outnumbered by Confederate forces, then dramatically led a countercharge of the 2nd Kansas Infantry on Bloody Hill, where he was shot in the heart at about 9:30 am. Although the Union Army was defeated at Wilson&#x27;s Creek, Lyon&#x27;s quick action neutralized the effectiveness of pro-Southern forces in Missouri, allowing Union forces to secure the state.

==Fate of Lyon&#x27;s remains==
In the confused aftermath of the Union retreat from Wilson&#x27;s Creek, Lyon&#x27;s body was mistakenly left behind on the battlefield and discovered by Confederate forces. It was briefly buried on a Union soldier&#x27;s farm outside Springfield until it could be returned to Lyon&#x27;s relatives. Eventually the remains were interred at the family plot in Eastford, Connecticut, where an estimated crowd of 15,000 attended the funeral. A cenotaph stands in memory of Lyon in the Springfield National Cemetery, Missouri.

==Legacy==

On December 24, 1861, the United States Congress passed a resolution of thanks for the &quot;eminent and patriotic services of the late Brigadier General Nathaniel Lyon. The country to whose service he devoted his life will guard and preserve his fame as a part of its own glory. That the Thanks of Congress are hereby given to the brave officers who, under the command of the late general Lyon sustained the honor of the flag and achieved victory against overwhelming numbers at the battle of Springfield, Missouri.&quot;

The 24th Missouri Volunteer Infantry was recruited as &quot;The Lyon Legion&quot; in honor of the General, and carried a unique regimental color, depicting a Lion beneath a constellation of six stars. Counties in Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, and Nevada, are named in Nathaniel Lyon&#x27;s honor. Two forts were also named in his honor: Fort Lyon in Colorado and Fort Lyon (Virginia), which defended Washington, D.C., during the American Civil War. Lyon Park in St. Louis, Lyon Street in San Francisco and Lyon Lane in Carson City, Nevada are also named for him. Lyon is mentioned in Stephen C. Foster&#x27;s 1862 song &quot;Better Times Are Coming&quot;.

A monument honoring Nathaniel Lyon was erected on Grand Boulevard in St. Louis in 1927. However, the monument was removed in 1960 when Harriet Frost Fordyce, a St. Louis philanthropist and youngest child of Confederate General Daniel Frost, agreed to donate one million dollars to help expand St. Louis University&#x27;s campus on the condition that Lyon&#x27;s statue be removed. The city quickly removed the monument in Lyon Park, a small park near Anheuser-Busch Brewery. SLU later renamed its main campus the “Frost Campus” in honor of the Confederate General Frost.

<text>Mechanism design (sometimes implementation theory or institution design) is a branch of economics and game theory. It studies how to construct rules—called mechanisms or institutions—that produce good outcomes according to some predefined metric, even when the designer does not know the players&#x27; true preferences or what information they have. Mechanism design thus focuses on the study of solution concepts for a class of private-information games. 

Mechanism design has broad applications, including traditional domains of economics such as market design, but also political science (through voting theory). It is a foundational component in the operation of the internet, being used in networked systems (such as inter-domain routing), e-commerce, and advertisement auctions by Facebook and Google.

Because it starts with the end of the game (a particular result), then works backwards to find a game that implements it, it is sometimes described as reverse game theory. Leonid Hurwicz explains that &quot;in a design problem, the goal function is the main given, while the mechanism is the unknown. Therefore, the design problem is the inverse of traditional economic theory, which is typically devoted to the analysis of the performance of a given mechanism.&quot;

The 2007 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was awarded to Leonid Hurwicz, Eric Maskin, and Roger Myerson &quot;for having laid the foundations of mechanism design theory.&quot; The related works of William Vickrey that established the field earned him the 1996 Nobel prize.

==Description==

One person, called the &quot;principal&quot;, would like to condition his behavior on information privately known to the players of a game. For example, the principal would like to know the true quality of a used car a salesman is pitching. He cannot learn anything simply by asking the salesman, because it is in the salesman&#x27;s interest to distort the truth. However, in mechanism design, the principal does have one advantage: He may design a game whose rules influence others to act the way he would like.

Without mechanism design theory, the principal&#x27;s problem would be difficult to solve. He would have to consider all the possible games and choose the one that best influences other players&#x27; tactics. In addition, the principal would have to draw conclusions from agents who may lie to him. Thanks to the revelation principle, the principal only needs to consider games in which agents truthfully report their private information.

==Foundations==

===Mechanism===

A game of mechanism design is a game of private information in which one of the agents, called the principal, chooses the payoff structure. Following , the agents receive secret &quot;messages&quot; from nature containing information relevant to payoffs. For example, a message may contain information about their preferences or the quality of a good for sale. We call this information the agent&#x27;s &quot;type&quot; (usually noted formula_1 and accordingly the space of types formula_2). Agents then report a type to the principal (usually noted with a hat formula_3) that can be a strategic lie. After the report, the principal and the agents are paid according to the payoff structure the principal chose.

The timing of the game is:

# The principal commits to a mechanism formula_4 that grants an outcome formula_5 as a function of reported type
# The agents report, possibly dishonestly, a type profile formula_3
# The mechanism is executed (agents receive outcome formula_7)

In order to understand who gets what, it is common to divide the outcome formula_5 into a goods allocation and a money transfer, formula_9 where formula_10 stands for an allocation of goods rendered or received as a function of type, and formula_11 stands for a monetary transfer as a function of type.

As a benchmark the designer often defines what should happen under full information. Define a social choice function formula_12 mapping the (true) type profile directly to the allocation of goods received or rendered,

:formula_13

In contrast a mechanism maps the &quot;reported&quot; type profile to an &quot;outcome&quot; (again, both a goods allocation formula_10 and a money transfer formula_11)
:formula_16

===Revelation principle===
A proposed mechanism constitutes a Bayesian game (a game of private information), and if it is well-behaved the game has a Bayesian Nash equilibrium. At equilibrium agents choose their reports strategically as a function of type
:formula_17

It is difficult to solve for Bayesian equilibria in such a setting because it involves solving for agents&#x27; best-response strategies and for the best inference from a possible strategic lie. Thanks to a sweeping result called the revelation principle, no matter the mechanism a designer can confine attention to equilibria in which agents truthfully report type. The revelation principle states: &quot;To every Bayesian Nash equilibrium there corresponds a Bayesian game with the same equilibrium outcome but in which players truthfully report type.&quot;

This is extremely useful. The principle allows one to solve for a Bayesian equilibrium by assuming all players truthfully report type (subject to an incentive compatibility constraint). In one blow it eliminates the need to consider either strategic behavior or lying.

Its proof is quite direct. Assume a Bayesian game in which the agent&#x27;s strategy and payoff are functions of its type and what others do, formula_18. By definition agent &quot;i&quot;&#x27;s equilibrium strategy formula_19 is Nash in expected utility:
:formula_20

Simply define a mechanism that would induce agents to choose the same equilibrium. The easiest one to define is for the mechanism to commit to playing the agents&#x27; equilibrium strategies &quot;for&quot; them.
:formula_21

Under such a mechanism the agents of course find it optimal to reveal type since the mechanism plays the strategies they found optimal anyway. Formally, choose formula_22 such that
: formula_23

===Implementability===

The designer of a mechanism generally hopes either
* to design a mechanism formula_4 that &quot;implements&quot; a social choice function
* to find the mechanism formula_4 that maximizes some value criterion (e.g. profit)

To implement a social choice function formula_12 is to find some transfer function formula_27 that motivates agents to pick formula_12. Formally, if the equilibrium strategy profile under the mechanism maps to the same goods allocation as a social choice function,
:formula_29
we say the mechanism implements the social choice function.

Thanks to the revelation principle, the designer can usually find a transfer function formula_27 to implement a social choice by solving an associated truthtelling game. If agents find it optimal to truthfully report type,
:formula_31
we say such a mechanism is truthfully implementable. The task is then to solve for a truthfully implementable formula_27 and impute this transfer function to the original game. An allocation formula_33 is truthfully implementable if there exists a transfer function formula_27 such that
: formula_35
which is also called the incentive compatibility (IC) constraint.

In applications, the IC condition is the key to describing the shape of formula_27 in any useful way. Under certain conditions it can even isolate the transfer function analytically. Additionally, a participation (individual rationality) constraint is sometimes added if agents have the option of not playing.

====Necessity====

Consider a setting in which all agents have a type-contingent utility function formula_37. Consider also a goods allocation formula_33 that is vector-valued and size formula_39 (which permits formula_39 number of goods) and assume it is piecewise continuous with respect to its arguments.

The function formula_33 is implementable only if
:formula_42
whenever formula_43 and formula_44 and &quot;x&quot; is continuous at formula_1. This is a necessary condition and is derived from the first- and second-order conditions of the agent&#x27;s optimization problem assuming truth-telling.

Its meaning can be understood in two pieces. The first piece says the agent&#x27;s marginal rate of substitution (MRS) increases as a function of the type,
:formula_46
In short, agents will not tell the truth if the mechanism does not offer higher agent types a better deal. Otherwise, higher types facing any mechanism that punishes high types for reporting will lie and declare they are lower types, violating the truthtelling incentive-compatibility constraint. The second piece is a monotonicity condition waiting to happen,
:formula_47
which, to be positive, means higher types must be given more of the good.

There is potential for the two pieces to interact. If for some type range the contract offered less quantity to higher types formula_48, it is possible the mechanism could compensate by giving higher types a discount. But such a contract already exists for low-type agents, so this solution is pathological. Such a solution sometimes occurs in the process of solving for a mechanism. In these cases it must be &quot;ironed&quot;. In a multiple-good environment it is also possible for the designer to reward the agent with more of one good to substitute for less of another (e.g. butter for margarine). Multiple-good mechanisms are an area of continuing research in mechanism design.

====Sufficiency====

Mechanism design papers usually make two assumptions to ensure implementability:

formula_49

This is known by several names: the single-crossing condition, the sorting condition and the Spence–Mirrlees condition. It means the utility function is of such a shape that the agent&#x27;s MRS is increasing in type.

formula_50

This is a technical condition bounding the rate of growth of the MRS.

These assumptions are sufficient to provide that any monotonic formula_33 is implementable (a formula_27 exists that can implement it). In addition, in the single-good setting the single-crossing condition is sufficient to provide that only a monotonic formula_33 is implementable, so the designer can confine his search to a monotonic formula_33.

==Highlighted results==

===Revenue equivalence theorem===
 gives a celebrated result that any member of a large class of auctions assures the seller of the same expected revenue and that the expected revenue is the best the seller can do. This is the case if
# The buyers have identical valuation functions (which may be a function of type)
# The buyers&#x27; types are independently distributed
# The buyers types are drawn from a continuous distribution
# The type distribution bears the monotone hazard rate property
# The mechanism sells the good to the buyer with the highest valuation

The last condition is crucial to the theorem. An implication is that for the seller to achieve higher revenue he must take a chance on giving the item to an agent with a lower valuation. Usually this means he must risk not selling the item at all.

===Vickrey–Clarke–Groves mechanisms===
The Vickrey (1961) auction model was later expanded by and Groves to treat a public choice problem in which a public project&#x27;s cost is borne by all agents, e.g. whether to build a municipal bridge. The resulting &quot;Vickrey–Clarke–Groves&quot; mechanism can motivate agents to choose the socially efficient allocation of the public good even if agents have privately known valuations. In other words, it can solve the &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot;—under certain conditions, in particular quasilinear utility or if budget balance is not required.

Consider a setting in which formula_55 number of agents have quasilinear utility with private valuations formula_56 where the currency formula_11 is valued linearly. The VCG designer designs an incentive compatible (hence truthfully implementable) mechanism to obtain the true type profile, from which the designer implements the socially optimal allocation
:formula_58

The cleverness of the VCG mechanism is the way it motivates truthful revelation. It eliminates incentives to misreport by penalizing any agent by the cost of the distortion he causes. Among the reports the agent may make, the VCG mechanism permits a &quot;null&quot; report saying he is indifferent to the public good and cares only about the money transfer. This effectively removes the agent from the game. If an agent does choose to report a type, the VCG mechanism charges the agent a fee if his report is pivotal, that is if his report changes the optimal allocation &quot;x&quot; so as to harm other agents. The payment is calculated
:formula_59
which sums the distortion in the utilities of the other agents (and not his own) caused by one agent reporting.

===Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem===

 and give an impossibility result similar in spirit to Arrow&#x27;s impossibility theorem. For a very general class of games, only &quot;dictatorial&quot; social choice functions can be implemented.

A social choice function &quot;f&quot;() is dictatorial if one agent always receives his most-favored goods allocation,
:formula_60

The theorem states that under general conditions any truthfully implementable social choice function must be dictatorial if,
# &quot;X&quot; is finite and contains at least three elements
# Preferences are rational
# formula_61

===Myerson–Satterthwaite theorem===
 show there is no efficient way for two parties to trade a good when they each have secret and probabilistically varying valuations for it, without the risk of forcing one party to trade at a loss. It is among the most remarkable negative results in economics—a kind of negative mirror to the fundamental theorems of welfare economics.

=== Shapley value ===
Phillips and Marden (2018) proved that for cost-sharing games with concave cost functions, the optimal cost-sharing rule that firstly optimizes the worst-case inefficiencies in a game (the price of anarchy), and then secondly optimizes the best-case outcomes (the price of stability), is precisely the Shapley value cost-sharing rule. A symmetrical statement is similarly valid for utility-sharing games with convex utility functions.

===Price discrimination===

 introduces a setting in which the transfer function &quot;t&quot;() is easy to solve for. Due to its relevance and tractability it is a common setting in the literature. Consider a single-good, single-agent setting in which the agent has quasilinear utility with an unknown type parameter formula_1
:formula_63
and in which the principal has a prior CDF over the agent&#x27;s type formula_64. The principal can produce goods at a convex marginal cost &quot;c&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and wants to maximize the expected profit from the transaction
:formula_65
subject to IC and IR conditions
:formula_66
:formula_67
The principal here is a monopolist trying to set a profit-maximizing price scheme in which it cannot identify the type of the customer. A common example is an airline setting fares for business, leisure and student travelers. Due to the IR condition it has to give every type a good enough deal to induce participation. Due to the IC condition it has to give every type a good enough deal that the type prefers its deal to that of any other.

A trick given by Mirrlees (1971) is to use the envelope theorem to eliminate the transfer function from the expectation to be maximized,
:formula_68
:formula_69
Integrating,
:formula_70
where formula_71 is some index type. Replacing the incentive-compatible formula_72 in the maximand,
:formula_73
after an integration by parts. This function can be maximized pointwise.

Because formula_74 is incentive-compatible already the designer can drop the IC constraint. If the utility function satisfies the Spence–Mirrlees condition then a monotonic formula_33 function exists. The IR constraint can be checked at equilibrium and the fee schedule raised or lowered accordingly. Additionally, note the presence of a hazard rate in the expression. If the type distribution bears the monotone hazard ratio property, the FOC is sufficient to solve for &quot;t&quot;(). If not, then it is necessary to check whether the monotonicity constraint (see sufficiency, above) is satisfied everywhere along the allocation and fee schedules. If not, then the designer must use Myerson ironing.

===Myerson ironing===

In some applications the designer may solve the first-order conditions for the price and allocation schedules yet find they are not monotonic. For example, in the quasilinear setting this often happens when the hazard ratio is itself not monotone. By the Spence–Mirrlees condition the optimal price and allocation schedules must be monotonic, so the designer must eliminate any interval over which the schedule changes direction by flattening it.

Intuitively, what is going on is the designer finds it optimal to bunch certain types together and give them the same contract. Normally the designer motivates higher types to distinguish themselves by giving them a better deal. If there are insufficiently few higher types on the margin the designer does not find it worthwhile to grant lower types a concession (called their information rent) in order to charge higher types a type-specific contract.

Consider a monopolist principal selling to agents with quasilinear utility, the example above. Suppose the allocation schedule formula_33 satisfying the first-order conditions has a single interior peak at formula_77 and a single interior trough at formula_78, illustrated at right.

* Following Myerson (1981) flatten it by choosing formula_10 satisfying formula_80 where formula_81 is the inverse function of x mapping to formula_82 and formula_83 is the inverse function of x mapping to formula_84. That is, formula_85 returns a formula_1 before the interior peak and formula_87 returns a formula_1 after the interior trough.
* If the nonmonotonic region of formula_33 borders the edge of the type space, simply set the appropriate formula_90 function (or both) to the boundary type. If there are multiple regions, see a textbook for an iterative procedure; it may be that more than one troughs should be ironed together.

====Proof====

The proof uses the theory of optimal control. It considers the set of intervals formula_91 in the nonmonotonic region of formula_33 over which it might flatten the schedule. It then writes a Hamiltonian to obtain necessary conditions for a formula_33 within the intervals
# that does satisfy monotonicity
# for which the monotonicity constraint is not binding on the boundaries of the interval
Condition two ensures that the formula_33 satisfying the optimal control problem reconnects to the schedule in the original problem at the interval boundaries (no jumps). Any formula_33 satisfying the necessary conditions must be flat because it must be monotonic and yet reconnect at the boundaries.

As before maximize the principal&#x27;s expected payoff, but this time subject to the monotonicity constraint
:formula_96
and use a Hamiltonian to do it, with shadow price formula_97
:formula_98
where formula_10 is a state variable and formula_100 the control. As usual in optimal control the costate evolution equation must satisfy
:formula_101
Taking advantage of condition 2, note the monotonicity constraint is not binding at the boundaries of the formula_1 interval,
:formula_103
meaning the costate variable condition can be integrated and also equals 0
:formula_104
The average distortion of the principal&#x27;s surplus must be 0. To flatten the schedule, find an formula_10 such that its inverse image maps to a formula_1 interval satisfying the condition above.

<text>[[Kuwait]] is divided into 6 [[governorate]]s (&quot;muhafazah&quot;). The governorates are further subdivided into areas. Each governorate is headed by a Governor appointed by a ministerial decree for a period of 4 years which can be renewed upon the proposal of the Prime Minister.

==History==
The beginning of the formation of governorates in the State of Kuwait started in 1962 with the Emiri decree No. 6 which divided the Kuwait into three governorates i.e. Asimah Governorate, Hawalli Governorate and Ahmadi Governorate. Later, Jahra Governorate, Farwaniya Governorate and Mubarak Al-Kabeer Governorate were formed in three periods of time: 1979, 1988 and 1999 respectively.

<doc id="689903" wikidata="Q4955824" url="?curid=689903" title="Brain healing">
<text>Brain healing is the process that occurs after the brain has been damaged. If an individual survives brain damage, the brain has a remarkable ability to adapt. When cells in the brain are damaged and die, for instance by stroke, there will be no repair or scar formation for those cells. The brain tissue will undergo liquefactive necrosis, and a rim of gliosis will form around the damaged area.

==Scar formation==
Apart from a small amount in the blood vessels, there are no fibroblasts in the brain. A scar is formed by fibroblasts producing collagen to repair an area, which will later contract. If scars did form in the brain, the contraction would cause even more damage.

==Formation of a glial membrane==
Around the edge of necrosis, astrocytes proliferate. These cells extend processes, and form a delicate rim of gliosis around the margin of damage. The empty space left by brain tissue fills up with cerebrospinal fluid.

==Functional recovery==
Brain injury will commonly be accompanied by acute swelling, which impairs function in brain tissue that remains alive. Resolution of swelling is an important factor for the individual&#x27;s function to improve. The greatest factor in functional recovery after brain injury comes from the brain&#x27;s ability to learn, called neuroplasticity. After injury, neuroplasticity allows intact areas of the brain to adapt and attempt to compensate for damaged parts of the brain. Although axons and the peripheral nervous system in the developing brain can regenerate, they cannot in the adult brain. This is partly because of factors produced by cells in the brain that inhibit this regeneration. Dendrites, however, will develop from intact axons, as part of the neuroplasticity process. After severe brain injury, improvement in function related to neuroplasticity is unlikely to occur without help from health professionals skilled in rehabilitation. Recent studies have found collagen is extensively distributed throughout the brain and may be essential in protecting the brain against degeneration such as that in Alzheimers.

A study done in Tel Aviv University showed severe brain damage can be reversed through oxygen rich air. Patients were treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) in high pressure chambers containing oxygen rich air which increased oxygen levels in body tenfold.

After two months of treatment, patients who were previously unable to perform simple daily activities such as bathing, cooking, climbing stairs or reading a book regained these abilities following treatment.

<doc id="689904" wikidata="Q1329869" url="?curid=689904" title="Graphic notation (music)">
<text>Graphic notation (or graphic score) is the representation of music through the use of visual symbols outside the realm of traditional music notation. Graphic notation became popular in the 1950s, and can be used either in combination with or instead of traditional music notation. Graphic notation was influenced by contemporary visual art trends in its conception, bringing stylistic components from modern art into music. Composers often rely on graphic notation in experimental music, where standard musical notation can be ineffective. Other uses include pieces where an aleatoric or undetermined effect is desired. One of the earliest pioneers of this technique was Earle Brown, who, along with John Cage, sought to liberate performers from the constraints of notation and make them active participants in the creation of the music.

== Characteristics ==

Graphic notation is characterized by its variability and lack of standardization. According to &quot;Baker&#x27;s Student Encyclopedia of Music, Vol. 1&quot;, &quot;Graphic notation is used to indicate extremely precise (or intentionally imprecise) pitch or to stimulate musical behavior or actions in performance.&quot; Modern graphic notation relies heavily on the imagination and inspiration of each individual performer to interpret the visual content provided by the composer. Because of this relative freedom, the realization of graphically notated pieces usually varies from performance to performance. For example, in notation indication &quot;E&quot; of his piece &quot;Concert for Piano and Orchestra&quot;, John Cage writes: &quot;Play with hands indicated. Where clefs differ, a note is either bass or treble&quot;, an indeterminacy which is not unusual in Cage&#x27;s work, and which leaves decision-making up to the performer. Some graphic scores can be defined as &quot;action-based,&quot; where musical gestures are notated as shapes instead of conventional musical ideas.

The use of graphic notation within a score can vary widely, from the score being made up entirely of graphic notation to graphic notation being a small part of an otherwise largely-traditional score. Some composers include written explanations to aid the performer in interpreting the graphic notation, while other composers opt to leave the interpretation entirely up to the performer. Graphic notation is difficult to characterize with specificity, as the notation system is only limited by the imagination and ability of the composer. Though some composers, like John Cage, formulate graphic notation systems which unify the approach of specific pieces, or several pieces, there is no universal consensus on the parameters of graphic notation and its use.

==History==
===Early history===

Though its most popular usage occurred in the mid-twentieth century, the first evidence of graphic notation dates back much earlier. Originally called &quot;eye music&quot;, these graphic scores bear much resemblance to the scores of composers like George Crumb. One of the earliest surviving pieces of eye music is &quot;Belle, Bonne, Sage&quot; by Baude Cordier, a Renaissance composer. His score, formed in the shape of a heart, was intended to enhance the meaning of the chanson. Characteristic of the Ars subtilior, &quot;experimentations with mensural signs and graphic shapes and colours were often a feature of musical design – for the sake of visual, rather than necessarily audible effect.&quot; Another example of eye music from the &quot;ars subtilior&quot; is Jacob Senleches&#x27; La harpe de melodie, where the voices are notated on a stave that appears to be the strings of a harp. Eye music&#x27;s popularity died down after the Humanist movement of the mid-16th century, later to be revitalized in the twentieth century as the use of graphic scores became prominent once again.

The 19th century music educator Pierre Galin developed a method of notating music known as the &quot;Galin-Paris-Chevé&quot; system, building on a notation system created in the 18th century by Jean-Jacques Rousseau. This system used numbers to indicate scale degrees, and used dots either above or below the note to indicate if they were in the lowest octave or the highest. The middle octave, relative to the example, contained no dots. Flats and sharps were notated using backslashes and forward slashes respectively. Prolongations of the note were notated using periods, and silence was notated with the number zero. This method was primarily used to teach sight-singing. The usage of symbols to indicate musical direction have been likened to an early version of graphic notation.

===Uses in the twentieth century===
Experimental music appeared in the United States and Europe during the 1950s, when many of the once untouchable parameters of traditional music began to be challenged. Aleatoric music, indeterminate music, musique concrète and electronic music shook previously unquestioned concepts, such as musical time or the function of the musician, and dared to add others to musical space in all its dimensions, with all their ontological consequences and burdens. They also changed the roles of the composer, the performer and the public, giving them totally new functions to explore.

In this context, the score, which had to a great extent been considered a mere support for musical writing (with the exception of eye music), began to flirt with the limits of the work and its identity. This marriage produced three paths: the first considered the musical score to be a representation of organized sound; the second conceived it as an extension of sound; and the third viewed it as another type of music, a visual music with its own autonomy, independent of sound. The score took on new meanings and went from being a mere support of sound to being an extension of the work, or even another work altogether, an element that was as important as the sounds and silences it contained, or more. These conceptions required a new language and a new reading of what it is to be musical. They also required a new notation, one that would reflect the changes taking place in the second artistic vanguards, and contain them, granting them a new semantics. In this way, taken with the porousness of experimental music with respect to the plastic arts, notation came to be more and more influenced by a dialogue with painting, installations and performativity. As J.Y. Bosseur mentions in &quot;La musique du XXè siècle à la croisé des artes&quot;, the score progressed towards representing the management of space, a graphic space that allows us to know the multiple connections enclosed within it.

Graphic notation in its modern form first appeared in the 1950s as an evolution of movement of Indeterminacy as pioneered by John Cage. The technique was originally used by avant-garde musicians and manifested itself as the use of symbols to convey information that could not be rendered with traditional notation such as extended techniques. Graphic scores have, since their conception, evolved into two broadly defined categories, one being the invention of new notation systems used to convey specific musical techniques and the other the use of conceptual notation such as shapes, drawings and other artistic techniques that are meant to evoke improvisation from the performer. Examples of the former include Morton Feldman&#x27;s &quot;Projection 1,&quot; which was the result of Feldman drawing abstract shapes on graph paper, and Stockhausen&#x27;s &quot;Prozession&quot;. Examples of the latter include Earle Brown&#x27;s &quot;December 1952&quot; and Cornelius Cardew&#x27;s &quot;Treatise&quot;, which was written in response to Cage&#x27;s &quot;4&#x27;33&quot;&quot; and which he wrote after having worked as Stockhausen&#x27;s assistant. The score consists of 193 pages of lines and shapes on a white background. Here the lines represented elements in space and the score was merely a representation of that space at a given instant. In Europe, one of the most notable users was Sylvano Bussotti, whose scores have often been displayed as pieces of visual art by enthusiasts. In 1969, in an effort to promote the movement of abstract notation, John Cage and Allison Knowles published an archive of excerpts of scores by 269 composers with the intention of showing &quot;the many directions in which notation is now going&quot;.

Other notable pioneers of graphic notation include composers such as Roman Haubenstock-Ramati, Mauricio Kagel, György Ligeti (&quot;Artikulation&quot;), Krzysztof Penderecki, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and Iannis Xenakis, Morton Feldman, Constance Cochnower Virtue, and Christian Wolff.

===Twenty-first-century advancements===
In 2008, Theresa Sauer edited a compendium featuring graphic scores by composers from over fifty countries, demonstrating how widespread the practice has become.

In addition to the more widespread popularity of graphic notation, new technology has expanded its possibilities. In his book &quot;The Digital Score: Musicianship, Creativity, and Innovation&quot;, Craig Vear describes how Artificial Intelligence and animation can be used to enhance the graphic score experience. He claims that these technologies are &quot;the logical development of graphic score experiments from the latter part of the twentieth century. An interesting element of these is that they have to move in order for them to be read; without movement, they are unintelligible.&quot;

==Examples==

===As a notational system===

*&quot;Time-based pictographic scores&quot; such as &quot;Waterwalk&quot; by John Cage, uses a combination of time marking a pictographic notation as instruction on how and when to perform certain actions.
*&quot;Pictographic scores&quot; such as &quot;Stripsody&quot; by Cathy Berberian use only drawings and text, foregoing any sort of time reference. This allows the performer to interpret the piece as they like.
*&quot;Line staves showing approximate pitch&quot;, with the actual pitches being decided upon performance.

*&quot;Altered notation&quot; can be seen in George Crumb&#x27;s work, where he uses traditional notation but presents the music on the page in a graphic or nontraditional manner such as spirals or circles. One example of altered notation is Crumb&#x27;s &quot;Makrokosmos&quot;&quot; for Amplified Piano. Crumb&#x27;s score contained three detailed pages of instructions, with movements including &quot;Primeval Sounds&quot;, &quot;Crucifixus&quot; and &quot;Spiral Galaxy&quot;.
*&quot;New specific notation system&quot;, that is, a new of specifically and graphically notate musical actions like that of Xenakis&#x27; &quot;Psappha&quot;.

===As abstract visual reference===
*&quot;Time-based abstract representation&quot;, can be seen in Hans-Christoph Steiner&#x27;s score for &quot;Solitude&quot; in which the music is represented using symbols and illustrations. Note that here, time is still represented horizontally from left to right like in a pitch graph system, and thus implies that the piece has a specific form.
*&quot;Time-based abstract notation&quot;, such as Rudolf Komorous&#x27;s &quot;Chanson&quot; utilizes abstract notation with time indication, or least a direction in which the piece is read and therefore implies a form.
*&quot;Free abstract representations&quot;, such as Brown&#x27;s &quot;December 1952&quot;, where the form, pitch material and instrumentation are left up to the performer.
*Another example is John Cage&#x27;s &quot;Aria;&quot; although it may appear to be random squiggles, each line indicates a different style of singing, notated in wavy lines in ten different colors, and the black squares indicate non-specified &#x27;non-musical&#x27; sounds.
*&quot;Free abstract notation&quot;, such as Mark Applebaum&#x27;s &quot;The Metaphysics of Notation&quot; and where elements of traditional music notation are melded with abstract designs. 
*Another example is Tom Phillips&#x27; &quot;Golden Flower Piece,&quot; this piece uses uppercase letters to show notes that should be played in the bass, and lowercase letters played in a higher register. The player is allowed to add flats and sharps as they please. The dots around the notes show how loud the note should be played, and how long it should be held for.

<text>The Former National Congress Building (&quot;ex Congreso Nacional&quot;) is the former home of the Chilean Congress. Congress met in this building in central Santiago until Salvador Allende&#x27;s socialist government was overthrown by Augusto Pinochet&#x27;s military coup d&#x27;état on September 11, 1973.

During the Pinochet dictatorship, Congress was moved to new premises in Valparaíso; the old building was declared a national monument in 1976 and between 1990 and 2006 housed the ministry of foreign affairs. The Senate moved its offices in Santiago to this building in December 2000. On January 26, 2006 the Chamber of Deputies recovered its old offices.

Work began on the original building under President Manuel Montt Torres (1851–1861), but the construction was not completed until 1876, during the presidency of Federico Errázuriz Zañartu. The building was destroyed by fire in 1895, rebuilt, and reopened in 1901, during the Parliamentary Era. It stands on Morandé 441 near the Blvd. Liberador Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins, partially surrounded by gardens that contain a variety of exotic trees and plant life. The eastern portion of the gardens was the former site of the Church of the Company.
The building has a cross within a square plan, which creates four courtyards. It also features classical pedimented porticos with Corinthian columns on the north and east facades. The building and its gardens occupy a complete city block, which is adjacent to city blocks containing other nationally significant buildings such as the Santiago Metropolitan Cathedral, the Palacio de los Tribunales de Justicia de Santiago and the building that currently houses the Museo Chileno de Arte Precolombino.

The building is open to the public on a limited basis.

<text>Maro Reef (Hawaiian: Nalukākala - &quot;surf that arrives in combers&quot;) is a largely submerged coral atoll located in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. It was discovered in 1820 by Captain Joseph Allen of the ship &quot;Maro&quot;, after whose ship the reef was named. With a total area of , it is the largest coral reef in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. It contains 37 species of stony coral. Unlike most atolls, the coral extends out from the center like spokes on a wheel. Located about northwest of Honolulu, Hawaii, Maro Reef contains about of dry land which itself can be submerged depending on the tides. Some scientists believe that it &quot;may be on the verge of drowning&quot; because the reefs are detached and are vulnerable to strong storm waves.

USNS &quot;Mission San Miguel&quot; (T-AO-129) ran aground on the reef, while running at full speed and in ballast, and sank on October 8, 1957.

The ship was a &quot;Buenaventura&quot; class tanker built in WW2, and due to problems with LORAN reception (for navigation) miscalculated its location striking Maro reef.

<doc id="689943" wikidata="Q3837561" url="?curid=689943" title="Loughborough Grammar School">
<text>Loughborough Grammar School is a 10–18 private boys&#x27; school in the town of Loughborough, Leicestershire, England, founded in 1495 by Thomas Burton. Today, roughly one in ten boys at the school are boarders, with the remainder being day students. It is one of five schools known as the Loughborough Schools Foundation, along with Loughborough High School, Fairfield Preparatory School, Loughborough Amherst School and Loughborough Nursery. 

The Schools Foundation are separate independent schools in their own right but share a board of governors. In line with the charitable intent of its founders, Loughborough Grammar School and Loughborough High School offer a number of means-tested bursaries, called School Assisted Places (SAPs), which cover up to 100% of fees.

==History==
Loughborough Grammar School was founded after Thomas Burton, a prosperous wool merchant from the town, who left money for priests to pray for his soul upon his death in 1495; these priests went on to found the school.

Loughborough Grammar is one of England&#x27;s oldest schools, pre-dating similar institutions such as Radley, Harrow, Winchester, and Westminster by a number of centuries. Alongside Radley, Winchester, Harrow, Eton, and Dulwich, it is one of a small number of independent boarding schools in Britain that remain for boys only. Notable old boys include: Sir Thomas Abney, who founded the Bank of England; Charles McCurdy, who played a central role in the reforming Liberal Party of the early 20th century; Rev. George Davys, who educated the young Queen Victoria; and the flying ace Air Vice Marshal Johnnie Johnson, who destroyed more Luftwaffe aircraft than any other British pilot. Former masters of the school include the former government minister Lord Elton and author Colin Dexter.

The school was founded in the Parish Church in the centre of Loughborough in 1495, but was moved by the trustees of the Burton Charity to its present location in 1852. A purpose-built site on Burton Walks became its permanent home, initially consisting of the main school building, lodgings, and a gatehouse at the Leicester Road entrance. These buildings were Grade II Listed in the 1980s.

The school celebrated its quincentenary in 1995, when it was visited by Queen Elizabeth II. During her visit, the Queen opened the new English block, the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Building&quot;, which includes a state of the art drama studio.

==Overview==
===Campus===
Loughborough Grammar School is set within a multi-acre campus on the south side of the town centre; it is situated on the same site as Loughborough High School and Fairfield Preparatory School, laid out along Burton Walks. Loughborough Amherst School (formerly Our Lady&#x27;s Convent School) is situated on Gray Street, about 5 minutes&#x27; walk away from the main campus. The core of the LGS campus is the quadrangle, on the eastern side of Burton Walks. Dating from 1850, Big School, consisting of the Victorian Gothic tower, original gymnasium and hall are at the head of the quadrangle, nowadays accommodating the History department, Chapel and Sixth Form common room, and are the oldest buildings on the current site. The quadrangle is completed by School House (the senior boarding house, which was built as the Headmaster&#x27;s residence), the Queen&#x27;s Building (1995, English and Drama), the Barrow Building (c. 1910, Classics and Modern Languages), the Cope Building (2000, Modern Languages) on the north side and the Library and old laboratory buildings (now housing Computing and Religion and Philosophy) on the south side. Big School and School House are both grade II listed, as is the gatehouse

On the western side of Burton Walks are located the Ireland Building (Physics), the Norman Walter Building (Chemistry), Murray/Millward Building (Biology), Pullinger Building (Mathematics) as well as the Hodson Hall, where most school functions and assemblies are held, the Burton Hall, primarily a dining hall, and the Art and Design department, Sports Hall, The Year 6 classroom, swimming pool and the Combined Cadet Force&#x27;s buildings. A number of houses on this side of the Walks are now owned by the School, including Buckland House, the administrative hub of the School, containing the Headmaster and Deputy Headmasters&#x27; offices as well as the general office. Other houses include Red House, formerly used for music lessons but now largely occupied by the Business Studies, Economics and Politics departments as well as reprographics; Friesland House containing Special Learning Support and Network Services, and one more houses the Bursary. Both the Headmaster of the Grammar School and the Headmistress of the High School traditionally reside in properties on the Walks.

The AstroTurf, tennis, and hockey pitches are not strictly part of the school, but are shared with the High School, although a new hockey pitch purely for the school&#x27;s use was opened in January 2019. The Music School (2006), is also another of these shared buildings, it includes a recital hall as well as practice rooms, classrooms and recording facilities.

In addition to the main campus, the School owns a site at the nearby village of Quorn, consisting of sports facilities, including those for rugby, football, cricket, and athletics.

The Burton Chapel is located in Loughborough&#x27;s Parish Church, school services are held in both this chapel and a second chapel located in the School&#x27;s quadrangle.

There is a public right of way along Burton Walks connecting the area of Shelthorpe with Loughborough town centre.

===Academics===
Candidates sit an entrance examination to gain admission to the school, in January of Year 6, so as to enter Year 7 at the age of 11. However, the middle school system that still prevails in North West Leicestershire led the School to introduce a smaller Year 6 intake for pupils leaving their primary schools after Year 5, as happens in a middle school system. There is also a 13+ exam, for those wishing to enter at Year 9, and 16+ entrance based on GCSE performance for boys wishing to enter at Sixth Form level.

In keeping with many other Independent Schools, the choice of subjects at the school tends to be more traditional. The most popular subjects at A Level are Mathematics, History, Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Geography. Subjects such as Business Studies, Psychology and Physical Education have been introduced at A Level in recent years.

In 2023, the school achieved 59% achieved grades 9-7 at GCSE and 47% attained A* or A grades at A-level.

===Extracurricular activities===

Loughborough Grammar School runs a large Combined Cadet Force (CCF), comprising Royal Navy, Army and RAF sections. About 240 pupils (including a cohort from Loughborough High School and more recently Loughborough Amherst School ) are members of the CCF. Major events include the annual Remembrance Parade in Loughborough in November, and the Annual Review in May. In 2003, Lt Col George Beazley was awarded the MBE in recognition of his work with the CCF. The CCF used to occupy a number of old Nissen-style huts, but these have been replaced with a purpose-built Cadet Force building, part sponsored by the MOD. This was opened in 2005. The Royal Naval section of the CCF is affiliated to the Type 45 Daring Class destroyer , whilst the Army section is affiliated to the Royal Anglian Regiment and the RAF Section to RAF Cosford. The first Senior Cadet to be awarded the &#x27;Priestly Sword&#x27; was Andy Halliwell in 2013 in recognition of his leadership.

The school runs an active Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award scheme, a Scout Troop and biennial adventurous expeditions, which have visited areas such as the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco, the Himalayas and Greenland. A number of clubs and societies run regularly, including the Senior Debating Society and a school newspaper made by students, entitled &quot;VOX&quot;. The school engages in regular charity fund-raising events, including non-uniform days and concerts. An example of this is in February 2018, a raffle event at a concert raised money for the Symphonic Wind Band tour to Ireland in the next summer.

===Sport===
The major sports at the School are rugby, hockey, cricket, tennis, athletics, football, and cross country. The School competes in national competitions in these sports, and has a full structure of teams from U12 to U18 level. The senior cross-country team was victorious in February 2017 in the 46th annual relay race at King Henry VIII School, Coventry. The senior rugby, cricket and hockey teams have all toured abroad in recent years, including separate hockey and cricket tours to South Africa, as well as a recent rugby tour to Australia and The Far East. Other sports include swimming, basketball, badminton, fencing, football, golf, sailing, table tennis, karting, and bridge. Loughborough Dynamo F.C. was formed in 1955 by a group of pupils who no longer wished to play rugby.

===House system===
The school operates a house system; every boy is placed in one of four houses: Abney (Green, after Sir Thomas Abney), Yates (Yellow, after William Yates), Pulteney (Purple, after Richard Pulteney) and Davys (Sky blue, after George Davys) and boys below the Upper Sixth have a small line in one of these colours on their school tie, between larger stripes for the school&#x27;s red and navy colours. The houses are named after alumni. The house system provides internal competition in a number of sporting disciplines as well as quiz, chess, bridge and music competitions, with a points system (40 for winning an event down to 10 for finishing fourth) calculating the eventual winner of the Stamper Cup. The Eagle trophy is awarded to the house that wins the most points in non-sporting house competitions.

<doc id="689946" wikidata="Q1196959" url="?curid=689946" title="Garnet Crow">
<text>Garnet Crow (stylized as GARNET CROW) was a Japanese pop/rock band formed in 1999 and associated with the Giza Studio record label. Members included Yuri Nakamura, Hitoshi Okamoto, Nana Azuki, and Hirohito Furui, with Nakamura leading on vocals. Music produced by Garnet Crow has its roots in the neo acoustic genre, and representative works include &quot;Flying&quot;, &quot;Yume Mita Ato De&quot;, and &quot;Spiral&quot;. Despite prolific early singles, the band neither performed live nor appeared on TV prior to 2002.

The mixed composition of Garnet Crow and Nakamura&#x27;s deep vocals set the group apart from its contemporaries. Each individual member has also seen industry success: Nakamura and Azuki often share the limelight for Garnet Crow, but Okamoto has achieved a solo career and Furui is a sought-after music arranger – one of the highest paid in Japan.

On March 30, 2013, the band announced their disbandment, with their final concert scheduled to be held on June 9, 2013. On June 9, 2013, they announced that they would break up during the final concert.

On March 29, 2020, on the day of debut anniversary was launched on their official website a special 20th anniversary project. According to the Furui, it would not be a band reunion.

== Summary ==
The origin of the word &quot;Garnet&quot; in &quot;Garnet Crow&quot; emerged from the band&#x27;s aspiration to achieve a musical depth akin to the depth of the color red often found in garnets. The word &quot;Crow&quot; was attached for its phonetic resonance. A further consideration in creating the band name was the enduring image left behind when it is translated to the eerie in Japanese.

Since inception to disbanding, the four-person line-up of Garnet Crow remained constant. The two female and two male band consisted of lead vocalist , keyboardists and , and guitarist . Furui was the band leader, but members were introduced in official sources with vocalist Nakamura receiving top billing. In 1999, the four members of what was to become Garnet Crow collaborated on the creation of a demo tape for singer Mai Kuraki&#x27;s all-American independent record label. Upon hitting it off during the production process, they decided to seize the opportunity to create a band of their own. At that time, three of the members were already involved with the record production company Being Group, distributing for and supporting other artists, leaving Nakamura as the sole newcomer. Nakamura herself was aiming for a position that did not require her to front for the band like a musical director, but her associates made recommendations for her and she ended up in charge of vocals and musical composition.

In the creation process roles are clearly divided, with primary duties like composition, creation of lyrics, and editing for most Garnet Crow songs being handled by the members themselves. Particularly Nakamura&#x27;s scores and Azuki&#x27;s lyrics are the core foundation for all the band&#x27;s songs. The works&#x27; roots lie in the Neo Acoustic genre, and at the time of its debut Garnet Crow&#x27;s own musicality was hailed as &quot;21st Century Neo-Neo Acoustics.&quot; From the 1999 debut and lasting nearly 2½ years the band mainly focused on CD production, but in 2002 Garnet Crow went live for the first time and since then has performed publicly more than 20 times, primarily in Japan&#x27;s three major metropolitan centers: Tokyo, Nagoya, and Kyoto. Using the experience of their public performances, Garnet Crow began to consciously produce music with the live setting in mind, incorporating elements of Latin American music and Canzone into their work.

There exist undisclosed gaps in the individual members&#x27; personal work histories. And, until the release of the 2002 single &quot;Yume mita ato de,&quot; Garnet Crow did not once appear on television. It is thought that the check on mass media exposure for Being Group-affiliated artists was a media control strategy by the company. However, since 2002 the band has performed on TV music programs. The members themselves have left remarks suggesting that television performances make them extremely tense.

<text>Southlander (also known as Southlander: Diary of a Desperate Musician) is a 2001 American independent film by Steve Hanft and Ross Harris. Originally titled &quot;Recycler&quot;, after the Los Angeles magazine of the same name, the film writers changed the name of the movie to &quot;Southlander&quot; to avoid trademark issues.

==Plot==
Down-and-out keyboardist Chance (Rory Cochrane) sees his redemption in touring with dub-pop band Future Pigeon, fronted by the lovely Rocket (Beth Orton). However, to guarantee a spot in the band, Chance needs a signature sound, which he finds in the futuristic &#x27;69 &quot;Molotron&quot; keyboard. Chance&#x27;s dreams are put on hold on the eve of the tour, however, when the Molotron is stolen from his car. &quot;Southlander&quot; follows Chance and his friend Ross Angeles (Ross Harris) as they track down the stolen keyboard through the pages of the &quot;Southlander,&quot; a local rag that publishes classified ads for musical equipment. The journey quickly becomes a surreal trip through LA&#x27;s underground music scene.

<text>The Horse Soldiers is a 1959 American adventure war film set during the American Civil War directed by John Ford and starring John Wayne, William Holden and Constance Towers. The screenplay by John Lee Mahin and Martin Rackin was loosely based on the Harold Sinclair (1907-1966) 1956 novel of historical fiction of the same name, a fictionalized version of the famous Grierson&#x27;s Raid by Federal cavalry in April–May 1863 riding southward through Mississippi and around the Mississippi River fortress of Vicksburg during the Vicksburg campaign to split the southern Confederacy by Union Army General Ulysses S. Grant.

==Plot==
A Union cavalry brigade led by Colonel John Marlowe — a railroad construction engineer in civilian life — is sent on a raid behind Confederate Army lines to destroy railroad track and the Confederate supply depot for Vicksburg at Newton Station. Newly assigned Major Henry Kendall, a regimental surgeon who is torn between duty and the horror of war, is constantly at odds with Marlowe.

While the raiders rest overnight at Greenbriar Plantation, Miss Hannah Hunter, the plantation&#x27;s mistress, acts as a gracious hostess to the unit&#x27;s officers, hosting a dinner for them and exaggerating her &quot;Southern manners and courtesies&quot; to hide her dismay and disgust towards the invading Yankees. She and her enslaved maid, Lukey, eavesdrop on a staff meeting as Colonel Marlowe discusses his battle strategy to avoid tangling with Confederate States Army troops as he drives south through Mississippi down to the Union-occupied Louisiana state capital of Baton Rouge. To protect the secrecy of the mission, Marlowe is forced to take the two women along with him.

Initially hostile to her Yankee captors, Miss Hunter gradually comes to respect Colonel Marlowe and eventually falls in love with him. In addition to the surgeon Major Kendall and Miss Hunter, Marlowe also must contend with Colonel Phil Secord, a politically ambitious officer commanding the other cavalry regiment. Secord continually questions and second-guesses Marlowe&#x27;s orders and command decisions.

Several battles ensue, including the capture of the vital supply depot at Newton Station, plus a later skirmish during which Lukey is killed by a rebel sniper; and a surprise dawn attack and skirmish with cadets from a local Southern military academy (based on an actual incident in May 1864&#x27;s Battle of New Market in the Shenandoah Valley campaigns of western Virginia, when a battalion of youngsters from the Corps of Cadets of the Virginia Military Institute was thrown into battle).

After destroying the crucial enemy supplies and equipment at Newton&#x27;s Station, cutting the railway line between Vicksburg and the Mississippi state capital of Jackson further east, and now with Confederate Army cavalry forces in hot pursuit, the Union Army brigade under Colonels Marlowe and Secord reaches a bridge that must be stormed and taken to reach the Federal lines at Baton Rouge. After taking the bridge, Marlowe&#x27;s men rig it with barrels of black powder. Marlowe bids Hannah farewell, telling her that he is in love with her and will return for her soon as possible. Dr. Kendall chooses to remain behind with some badly wounded men in a log cabin by the bridge rigged up as a temporary hospital, knowing he will be captured with them, rather than leave them without medical attention until Confederate medical personnel arrive with the pursuing Southerners.

Marlowe, though wounded in the leg, lights the fuse to the explosives with a cigar. He is the last of his men to gallop in a rush across the bridge before it explodes, halting the Confederate chase. Their mission accomplished, he and his brigade continue on toward Baton Rouge.

==Background==
The film was loosely based on Harold Sinclair&#x27;s 1956 novel of the same name, which in turn was based on the historic 17-day Grierson&#x27;s Raid and Battle of Newton&#x27;s Station in Mississippi during the Civil War.

In April 1863, Colonel Benjamin Grierson led 1,700 Illinois and Iowa soldiers from La Grange, Tennessee, to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, through several hundred miles of enemy territory, destroying Confederate railroad and supply lines between Newton&#x27;s Station and Vicksburg, Mississippi. The mission was part of the Union Army&#x27;s successful Vicksburg campaign to gain control over boat traffic on the Mississippi River, culminating in the Battle of Vicksburg. Grierson&#x27;s destruction of Confederate-controlled rail links and supplies played an important role in disrupting Confederate General John C. Pemberton&#x27;s strategies and troop deployments. Union General William Tecumseh Sherman reportedly described Grierson&#x27;s daring mission as &quot;the most brilliant of the war&quot;.

Though based loosely on Grierson&#x27;s Raid, &quot;The Horse Soldiers&quot; is a fictional account that departs considerably from the actual events. The real-life protagonist, a music teacher named Benjamin Grierson, becomes railroad engineer John Marlowe in the film. Hannah Hunter, Marlowe&#x27;s love interest, has no historical counterpart. Numerous other details were altered as well, &quot;to streamline and popularize the story for the non-history buffs who would make up a large part of the audience.&quot;

Dr. Erastus Dean Yule, the real-life surgeon counterpart of Major Hank Kendall, actually did volunteer to stay behind and get captured by the Confederates with the casualties who were too wounded to continue. The raid actually took place about a year before the notorious Andersonville POW camp was built, and he was eventually exchanged after several months as a POW.

==Production==
Exterior scenes were filmed in Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana, along the banks of Cane River Lake, and in and around Natchez, Mississippi. The film company built a bridge over the Cane River for the pivotal battle scene, and many locals were hired as extras. It also features scenes shot in Wildwood Regional Park in Thousand Oaks, California. The film used DeLuxe Color.

Holden and Wayne both received $750,000 for starring, a record salary at the time. The project was plagued from the start by cost overruns, discord, and tragedy. Holden and Ford argued incessantly. Wayne was preoccupied with pre-production logistics for &quot;The Alamo&quot;. Lukey&#x27;s dialog was originally written in &quot;Negro&quot; dialect that Althea Gibson, the former Wimbledon and U.S. National tennis champion who was cast in the role, found offensive. She informed Ford that she would not deliver her lines as written. Though Ford was notorious for his intolerance of actors&#x27; demands, he agreed to modify the script.

During filming of the climactic battle scene, veteran stuntman Fred Kennedy suffered a broken neck while performing a horse fall and died. &quot;Ford was completely devastated,&quot; wrote biographer Joseph Malham. &quot;[He] felt a deep responsibility for the lives of the men who served under him.&quot; The film was scripted to end with the triumphant arrival of Marlowe&#x27;s forces in Baton Rouge, but Ford &quot;simply lost interest&quot; after Kennedy&#x27;s death. He ended the film with Marlowe&#x27;s farewell to Hannah Hunter before crossing and blowing up the bridge.

==Reception==
The film opened at number one in the United States but was ultimately a commercial failure, due largely to Wayne&#x27;s and Holden&#x27;s high salaries and the complex participation of multiple production companies. The response of audiences and critics was &quot;lackluster&quot;.

Literary critic Manny Farber writing in &quot;The New Leader&quot; offers this assessment:

<text>Election is a 1999 American black comedy film directed by Alexander Payne from a screenplay by Payne and Jim Taylor, based on Tom Perrotta&#x27;s 1998 novel.

The plot revolves around a student body election and satirizes politics and high school life. The film stars Matthew Broderick as Jim McAllister, a popular high school social studies teacher, and Reese Witherspoon as Tracy Flick, an overachieving student whom he dislikes. When Tracy runs for student government president, McAllister sabotages her candidacy by backing a rival candidate and tampering with the ballot count.

Although not a commercial success, &quot;Election&quot; received widespread critical acclaim, along with an Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay, a Golden Globe nomination for Witherspoon for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical, and three Independent Spirit Awards including Best Feature Film in 1999.

==Plot==
Jim McAllister is a teacher of U.S. history and civics at Carver High School in Omaha, Nebraska. One of his students is Tracy Flick, an overachieving junior whose mother Judith encourages her to strive for success. 

Earlier in the year, McAllister&#x27;s colleague and best friend, geometry teacher Dave Novotny, was fired from his job and divorced by his wife Linda after engaging in a sexual relationship with Tracy. While McAllister agreed Dave needed to suffer consequences, he resents the lack of repercussions for Tracy.

McAllister struggles to conceive a child with his wife Diane, and subsequently begins to have sexual fantasies of both Linda and Tracy. Appalled by Tracy&#x27;s unopposed run for student government president and dreading further proximity to her, McAllister persuades Paul Metzler, a popular, good-natured, but dimwitted football player, to enter the race. Sidelined from football with a broken leg sustained in a skiing accident, Paul finds his candidacy gives him purpose. It also infuriates Tracy, who expects to run unchallenged and resents Paul&#x27;s popularity and privileged upbringing.

Tammy Metzler, Paul&#x27;s adopted younger sister, is dumped by her girlfriend Lisa Flanagan, who becomes Paul&#x27;s girlfriend and campaign manager. Tammy exacts revenge by running for president herself. In her speech at a school assembly, she denounces student government as a sham and vows to dissolve it if she wins, rallying the students to a rowdy standing ovation. The principal, Walt Hendricks, retaliates by suspending her.

Late one Sunday night while working on the school yearbook, Tracy sees that one of her campaign posters has come unstuck from the wall. Trying to secure it, she accidentally rips the poster apart, then furiously destroys the other candidates&#x27; campaign posters and discards them in a dumpster, unaware that Tammy is watching. 

The next day, McAllister confronts Tracy, suspecting that she removed the posters. She feigns innocence and trades threats with McAllister, but Tammy rescues her by appearing with the torn posters and falsely claiming responsibility. Tammy is expelled and her name is struck from the ballot.

McAllister has a tryst with Dave&#x27;s ex-wife Linda, the day before the election. She asks him to rent a motel room for an after-school rendezvous, but fails to attend. When McAllister drives to Linda&#x27;s house to find her, he is stung by a bee on his eyelid. He returns home to find Linda and his wife Diane talking. Knowing Linda has exposed their encounter, he spends the night in his car.

McAllister oversees the tally of the ballots, which finds Tracy winning by a single vote. Seeing Tracy peering in on the vote count and preemptively celebrating, he spitefully disposes of two of Tracy&#x27;s ballots, throwing the election to Paul. 

The discarded ballots are later discovered by a janitor who dislikes McAllister, and Tracy becomes president. He is forced to resign, and the election rigging makes headlines. Diane divorces him, taking the house and most of their joint assets.

Publicly humiliated, McAllister leaves Nebraska and fulfills his dream of moving to New York City. He becomes a tour guide at the American Museum of Natural History and begins dating Jillian, a fellow museum worker. 

Paul develops an active social life at the University of Nebraska, though without Lisa, who dumps him. Tammy finds a new girlfriend at her all-girls private Catholic school. Tracy attends Georgetown University, where she similarly isolates herself from her peers due to her work-centric nature and is dismayed that many of her classmates were admitted primarily through connections. 

Tracy misses Dave&#x27;s intellect and wonders if he became a novelist as she believed he would; the film shows Dave working in a hardware store in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where he now lives with his parents.

On a visit to Washington, D.C., McAllister spots Tracy getting into a limousine with congressman Mike Geiger, a Republican representative from Nebraska. Infuriated that she will go through life as she did at Carver, he hurls a cup of soda at the limousine&#x27;s backglass before fleeing. The film ends with McAllister at the museum posing a question to a group of elementary school children; an overeager little girl is the only one to very excitedly raise her hand. He looks at her, ignores her, then asks, &quot;anybody?&quot;...

==Cast==
==Production==
Producers Albert Berger and Ron Yerxa sent director Alexander Payne an unpublished manuscript from novelist Tom Perrotta called &quot;Election&quot; in 1996. Payne was initially uninterested in directing a high school movie but changed his mind after he read the manuscript. &quot;It was set in a high school, but it wasn’t a high school story, per se. Also what attracted me was the formal exercise of doing a movie with multiple points of view and multiple voice-overs,&quot; said Payne. The novel&#x27;s rights were sold to Payne in January 1997. It was officially published in March 1998.

The novel was inspired by the following two key events: the 1992 United States presidential election, in which Ross Perot entered as a third-party candidate (a move echoed by Tammy Metzler), and a 1992 incident at Memorial High School in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, in which a pregnant student was elected homecoming queen, but staff announced a different winner and burned the ballots to cover it up.

The film uses several stylized techniques in its storytelling, particularly through the use of freeze frames, flashbacks, and voiceovers, which allow sections of the narrative to be delivered from the points of view of the four main characters (Mr. McAllister, Tracy, Paul, and Tammy).

The film was primarily shot on location around the Omaha metro area in the fall of 1997, most notably in Papillion, Bellevue and the Dundee neighborhood. Papillion-La Vista Senior High School portrayed the fictitious Carver High School with many of the background extras being actual enrolled students at the time. Minor scenes were filmed at Younkers in Westroads Mall, the Old Market, and the Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium.

===Alternate ending===
The film&#x27;s original ending, received poorly by test audiences, was not known until a rough workprint was found in a box of VHS tapes at a yard sale in 2011. This ending also appears in the third draft of the script, which can be read online. It is faithful to the book: McAllister stays in Omaha and is hired as a used car salesman by one of his former students instead of moving to New York. Tracy encounters McAllister while looking to buy a car and the two settle their differences before she has him sign her yearbook.

== Reception ==
&quot;Election&quot; was not a box office success as it grossed only $17.2 million against a budget of $8.5-25 million.

=== Critical response ===
&quot;Election&quot; received critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 92%, based on 116 reviews, with an average rating of 7.90/10. The critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Election&quot; successfully combines dark humor and intelligent writing in this very witty and enjoyable film.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 83 out of 100, based on 33 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;B−&quot; on a scale of A to F. It later placed at #5 in the first annual Village Voice Film Poll.

Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half out of four stars, praising Witherspoon and Payne: 

Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;Brandishes the sort of intelligent wit and bracing nastiness that will make it more appealing to discerning adults than to teens who just want to have fun.&quot;

Desson Howe from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; recommended the film, saying it was &quot;the satire of the season, a hilarious, razor-sharp indictment of the American Dream,&quot; also praising Payne for finding &quot;a perfect fulcrum between humor and tragedy, between black comedy and poignancy.&quot;

According to Payne, it is also President Barack Obama&#x27;s favorite political film.

=== Accolades ===

&quot;Election&quot; is ranked #61 on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;100 Funniest Movies&quot;, #389 on &quot;Empire&quot;&#x27;s &quot;500 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot; and #9 on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s list of the &quot;50 Best High School Movies&quot;, while Witherspoon&#x27;s performance was ranked at #45 on the list of the &quot;100 Greatest Film Performances of All Time&quot; by &quot;Premiere&quot;.

==Home media==
&quot;Election&quot; was released on DVD on October 19, 1999, and Blu-ray on January 20, 2009. A special edition Blu-ray was released by The Criterion Collection on December 16, 2017, with a 4K restoration of the film.

== Sequel ==
In December 2022, it was announced that a film adaptation of the novel&#x27;s 2022 sequel, &quot;Tracy Flick Can&#x27;t Win&quot;, was being developed for Paramount+. Witherspoon is slated to reprise her role as Tracy Flick and co-produce under her Hello Sunshine banner, while Payne would return to direct and co-write with Jim Taylor. A year later, while promoting &quot;The Holdovers&quot; (2023), Payne reiterated interest in the project, but would like to pursue other projects first. Payne said that he wants to make a loose adaptation of the novel with Taylor that included Broderick&#x27;s Jim McAllister character, as well as divert from the high school setting of the novel, attributing to his averseness to &quot;making another high school movie,&quot; saying:

<text>The common minimum programme (CMP) is a document outlining the shared agenda, policy, and priorities of a coalition government in India and Nepal. It provides a framework for government operations, ensuring that all participating parties share a common understanding of the key issues and goals they aim to collectively address.

The idea of CMP document has acquired prominence since coalition governments have become the norm in India in 1990s.

==History==
The United Front, a coalition government established in 1996, emphasized secularism, economic reforms, social justice, and empowerment of marginalized groups through its Common Minimum Programme. In 1998, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), spearheaded by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), assumed power. Its Common Minimum Programme prioritized national security, economic growth, infrastructure development, and effective governance. Additionally, it aimed to foster social cohesion, reinforce federalism, and tackle issues pertaining to agriculture and rural progress. The Indian National Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) coalition which won the 2004 Indian general election, had objectives such as education spending, limiting privatization, economic growth, social welfare, and &quot;maintaining a credible nuclear weapons programme&quot;.

Besides India, Nepal also releases common minimum programme documents. It first happened in 2004 when the Nepali Congress (Democratic) formed a coalition.

<doc id="689975" wikidata="Q16377450" url="?curid=689975" title="Laban movement analysis">
<text>Laban movement analysis (LMA), sometimes Laban/Bartenieff movement analysis, is a method and language for describing, visualizing, interpreting and documenting human movement. It is based on the original work of Rudolf Laban, which was developed and extended by Lisa Ullmann, Irmgard Bartenieff, Warren Lamb and others. LMA draws from multiple fields including anatomy, kinesiology and psychology. It is used by dancers, actors, musicians and athletes; by health professionals such as physical and occupational therapists and psychotherapists; and in anthropology, business consulting and leadership development.

Labanotation (or Kinetography Laban), a notation system for recording and analyzing movement, is used in LMA, but Labanotation is a separate system.

==Categories of movement==

Laban movement analysis is contemporarily categorised in various way. Originally, these categories were very basic and Laban himself referred mostly to Eukinetics - which is his effort studies - and Choreutics - which is Spatial Harmony theory. His student Irmgard Bartenieff later further elaborated these categories in four - Body, Effort, Shape and Space - and this system, known as BESS is commonly taught today. However, BESS is not the only organisation of Laban&#x27;s theory in use. In the U.K. for example, more influenced by Lisa Ullmann, another student of Laban, the categories are Body, Effort, Space and Relationship with Shape being interwoven into Body, Space and Relationship.

The categories of BESS are as follows:

* Body - what the body is doing and the interrelationships within the body
* Effort - the qualities of movement
* Shape - how the body is changing shape and what motivates it to do so 
* Space - where the body is moving and the harmonic relationships in space

Other categories, that are occasionally mentioned in some literature, are relationship and phrasing. These are less well defined. Relationship is the interaction between people, body parts or a person and an object. Phrasing is defined as being the personal expression of a movement.

These categories are in turn occasionally divided into kinematic and non-kinematic categories to distinguish which categories relate to changes to body relations over time and space.

===Body===

The body category describes structural and physical characteristics of the human body while moving. This category is responsible for describing which body parts are moving, which parts are connected, which parts are influenced by others, and general statements about body organization.

Several subcategories of body are:
* Initiation of movement starting from specific bodies;
* Connection of different bodies to each other;
* Sequencing of movement between parts of the body; and
* Patterns of body organization and connectivity, called &quot;patterns of total body square connectivity&quot;, &quot;developmental hyper movement patterns&quot;, or &quot;neuromuscular shape-shifting patterns&quot;.

===Effort===

Effort, or what Laban sometimes described as dynamics, is a system for understanding the more subtle characteristics about movement with respect to inner intention. The difference between punching someone in anger and reaching for a glass is slight in terms of body organization – both rely on extension of the arm. The attention to the strength of the movement, the control of the movement and the timing of the movement are very different.

Effort has four subcategories (effort factors), each of which has two opposite polarities (Effort elements).

Laban named the combination of the first three categories (Space, Weight, and Time) the Effort Actions, or Action Drive. The eight combinations are descriptively named Float, Punch (Thrust), Glide, Slash, Dab, Wring, Flick, and Press. The Action Efforts have been used extensively in some acting schools, including ALRA, Manchester School of Theatre, LIPA and London College of Music to train in the ability to change quickly between physical manifestations of emotion.

Flow, on the other hand, is responsible for the continuousness or ongoingness of motions. Without any Flow Effort, movement must be contained in a single initiation and action, which is why there are specific names for the Flow-less Action configurations of Effort. In general it is very difficult to remove Flow from much movement, and so a full analysis of Effort will typically need to go beyond the Effort Actions.

====Combinations of Efforts====

While the individual motion factors of Space, Time, Weight and Flow may be observed, usually they will appear in combinations.
Combinations of 3 Motion Factors are known as drives. The drives are:
* The Action Drive - where Weight, Space and Time are present but Flow is missing
* The Passion Drive - where Weight, Time and Flow are present but Space is missing
* The Spell Drive - where Weight, Space and Flow are present but Time is missing
* The Vision Drive - where Space, Time and Flow are present but Weight is missing

Alongside the drives, combinations of two efforts are known as states. The states are known as:
* Awake - combining Space and Time
* Dreamlike - combining Weight and Flow
* Distant - combining Space and Flow
* Near/Rhythm - combining Time and Weight
* Stabile - combining Space and Weight
* Labile/Mobile - combining Time and Flow

Full effort, where all 4 motion factors are equally expressed, is usually considered to be a rare and usually momentary occurrence.

The states and drives are often discussed as having distinct psychological characteristics.

===Shape===
While the Body category primarily develops connections within the body and the body/space intent, the way the body changes shape during movement is further experienced and analyzed through the Shape category. It is important to remember that all categories are related, and Shape is often an integrating factor for combining the categories into meaningful movement.

There are several subcategories in Shape:
* &quot;Shape Forms&quot; describe static shapes that the body takes, such as Wall-like, Ball-like, and Pin-like.
* &quot;Modes of Shape Change&quot; describe the way the body is interacting with and the relationship the body has to the environment. There are three Modes of Shape Change:
** Shape Flow: Representing a relationship of the body to itself. Essentially a stream of consciousness expressed through movement, this could be amoebic movement or could be mundane habitual actions, like shrugging, shivering, rubbing an injured shoulder, etc. 
** Directional: Representing a relationship where the body is directed toward some part of the environment. It is divided further into Spoke-like (punching, pointing, etc.) and Arc-like (swinging a tennis racket, painting a fence)
** Carving: Representing a relationship where the body is actively and three dimensionally interacting with the volume of the environment. Examples include kneading bread dough, wringing out a towel, avoiding laser-beams or miming the shape of an imaginary object. In some cases, and historically, this is referred to as Shaping, though many practitioners feel that all three Modes of Shape Change are &quot;shaping&quot; in some way, and that the term is thus ambiguous and overloaded.
* &quot;Shape Qualities&quot; describe the way the body is changing (in an active way) toward some point in space. In the simplest form, this describes whether the body is currently Opening (growing larger with more extension) or Closing (growing smaller with more flexion). There are more specific terms – Rising, Sinking, Spreading, Enclosing, Advancing, and Retreating, which refer to specific dimensions of spatial orientations.
* &quot;Shape Flow Support&quot; describes the way the torso (primarily) can change in shape to support movements in the rest of the body. It is often referred to as something which is present or absent, though there are more refined descriptors.

===Space===

One of Laban&#x27;s primary contributions to Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) are his theories of Space. This category involves motion in connection with the environment, and with spatial patterns, pathways, and lines of spatial tension. Laban described a complex system of geometry based on crystalline forms, Platonic solids, and the structure of the human body. He felt that there were ways of organizing and moving in space that were specifically harmonious, in the same sense as music can be harmonious. Some combinations and organizations were more theoretically and aesthetically pleasing. As with music, Space Harmony sometimes takes the form of set &#x27;scales&#x27; of movement within geometric forms. These scales can be practiced in order to refine the range of movement and reveal individual movement preferences. The abstract and theoretical depth of this part of the system is often considered to be much greater than the rest of the system. In practical terms, there is much of the Space category that does not specifically contribute to the ideas of Space Harmony.

This category also describes and notates choices which refer specifically to space, paying attention to:
* Kinesphere: the area that the body is moving within and how the mover is paying attention to it.
* Spatial Intention: the directions or points in space that the mover is identifying or using.
* Geometrical observations of where the movement is being done, in terms of emphasis of directions, places in space, planar movement, etc.

The Space category is currently under continuing development, more so since exploration of non-Euclidean geometry and physics has evolved.

==Use in human–computer interaction==
LMA is used in Human-Computer Interaction as a means of extracting useful features from a human&#x27;s movement to be understood by a computer, as well as generating realistic movement animation for virtual agents and robots.

==Formal study==

Laban movement analysis practitioners and educators who studied at LIMS, an accredited institutional member of the National Association of Schools of Dance (NASD), are known as &quot;Certified Movement Analysts&quot; (CMAs).

Laban/Bartenieff and Somatic Studies International™ (LSSI), is an approved training program of ISMETA, and offers Movement Analysis and Somatic Practice training, which qualifies “Certified Movement Analysts &amp; Somatic Practitioners” (CMA-SPs).

Other courses offer LMA studies, including Integrated Movement Studies, which qualifies &quot;Certified Laban/Bartenieff Movement Analysts&quot; (CLMAs).

The Laban Guild, set up by Rudolf Laban in the UK, offers courses in Laban Movement Analysis and Labannotation and is responsible for preserving and developing the work in the U.K.

Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance offer a 3-year post-graduate diploma in Choreological studies and Valerie Preston-Dunlop is a course director.

<text>The coat of arms of Liechtenstein is the arms of dominion of the Prince of Liechtenstein, currently Hans-Adam II. As the sovereign emblem of the Prince, its use is restricted to the Prince and members of his House, though private individuals are permitted to use the arms if it is in the interest of the State. The arms are a history of the House of Liechtenstein and show some of the different territories and families with which it has been connected, either by acquisition or by marriage.

==Description==
The first quarter shows the arms of Silesia, the second the arms of the (which should not be mistaken for the arms of Saxony), the third the arms of the Duchy of Troppau, and the fourth a variant of the arms of the Cirksena family of Agnes von Ostfriesland (representing the County of Rietberg). The base is occupied by the arms of the Duchy of Jägerndorf, while the arms of the Princely House itself are displayed on an inescutcheon.

The whole shield is surrounded by a purple (purpure) mantle with ermine lining, along with fringes and tassels of gold. At the top is placed the Princely hat.

The arms of the Princely House are sometimes used alone, and thus form the Lesser Arms of Liechtenstein. When shown alone, the arms are ensigned by the Princely hat.

<doc id="689980" wikidata="Q267321" url="?curid=689980" title="Mercury Rising">
<text>Mercury Rising is a 1998 American action thriller film starring Bruce Willis and Alec Baldwin. Directed by Harold Becker, the film is based on Ryne Douglas Pearson&#x27;s 1996 novel originally published as &quot;Simple Simon&quot;, which was the working title of the film. Willis plays Art Jeffries, an undercover FBI agent who protects a nine-year-old autistic boy, Simon Lynch (played by Miko Hughes), who is targeted by government assassins after he cracks a top secret government code.

The film was released on April 3, 1998. It received mostly negative reviews and grossed $93 million at the box office.

==Plot==

The film opens with a bank robbery hostage crisis in South Dakota. Undercover as one of the criminals, FBI agent Art Jeffries guards fourteen year old James while trying to convince the gang’s leader, Edgar Halstrom, to surrender. Despite pleading for more time to negotiate, an armed FBI task force storms the building, fatally shooting both James and the thieves. Art confronts his superior Hartley, punching him when the latter says they must answer to Washington. As a result of his outburst, Jeffries is demoted to desk duty.

Years later, a nine-year-old autistic savant named Simon Lynch is given a sophisticated puzzle book by his teacher. Simon quickly solves a particular puzzle and phones a number encoded in the solution. This call reaches two National Security Agency cryptographers, Dean Crandell and Leo Pedranski, who created the new cypher Simon has cracked. Pedranski and Crandell report the situation to their boss, Lieutenant Colonel Nick Kudrow, who severely rebukes the pair for their unauthorized actions, describing Simon and his abilities as a national security threat. Two assassins, Peter Burrell and Shayes, are sent by Kudrow to terminate the boy and his parents, Martin and Jenny.

Posing as a police detective, Burrell murders both Simon&#x27;s mother and father, but is unable to find Simon himself. Upon finding that Martin dialed 911 before he died, Burrell stages a murder/suicide between him and his wife Jenny before exiting the Lynch residence. Shayes serves as his getaway driver.

Jeffries is sent to investigate the crime scene and finds Simon in a hidden crawl space in his bedroom closet. Simon is taken to a protection ward at the hospital, where a nurse explains the nature of Simon&#x27;s autism to Art, and why he cannot be interrogated. Burrell impersonates a doctor and makes another attempt on Simon&#x27;s life. Art saves Simon and flees the premises, and tries unsuccessfully to convince Simon that he is a friend instead of a stranger. Later, while on a train, Shayes tries to kill Simon, but Art intervenes, knocking him off the train and onto the tracks as another locomotive passes, killing him.

Under Kudrow&#x27;s direction, the NSA frames Art as Simon&#x27;s kidnapper. However, fellow agent and friend Tommy Jordan does not believe the story and assists Art, who borrows Jordan&#x27;s car and takes Simon back to his house. Simon again calls the telephone number written into the code and Art is able to talk to Crandell and Pedranski. As Crandell arranges a meeting at the Wrigley Building by the next morning, Art goes to the meeting, leaving Simon under the care of a woman in a coffee shop, Stacey Siebring, who later agrees to help Art take care of Simon. Crandell tells Jeffries about Mercury and Kudrow, but is shot dead by Burrell before he can reveal everything.

Pedranski, having learned Crandell&#x27;s fate, tries to reveal Kudrow&#x27;s unlawful actions by writing letters on a typewriter: one to Art and a carbon copy for the Senate Oversight Committee, but Burrell tracks Pedranski down and kills him as well, confiscating the letters. However, the assassin overlooks Pedranski&#x27;s carbon copies, which his girlfriend, NSA analyst Emily Lang, takes to the FBI. Jordan discreetly arranges for her to meet with Art to show them the carbon copies; covered in Pedranski’s fingerprints, they become crucial evidence. Art then goes to Kudrow’s home during his birthday party, confronting him in his wine cellar. He berates the NSA head for targeting Simon, demands that Kudrow announce on national TV that the Mercury Encryption Project is a failure, and kicks him for trying to justify his crimes on grounds of protecting American spies.

Under Art&#x27;s suggestion, Jordan arranges for Simon to go into the Witness Protection Program, but Kudrow, unwilling to reveal his failure and determined to kill Simon, forcibly takes charge of the Witness Protection while revealing to Lomax, the FBI Special Agent in charge, that Jordan forged the witness protection documents. However, unknown to Kudrow, Tommy shows the carbon paper evidence to Lomax and confirms that the fingerprint markings on it were Pedranski&#x27;s, validating the evidence against Kudrow. Stacey and Simon leave for the pick-up point at the top of a skyscraper, where Kudrow and Burrell prepare to take Simon away on a helicopter, but Jeffries, with Jordan and an FBI task force&#x27;s help, sets a trap at the meeting spot. A gunfight ensues between Burrell and the FBI, ending with Burrell being fatally slashed by glass shards when plexiglass windows are blown inward, while Art fights Kudrow one-on-one, and Simon assists him by retrieving his gun. Kudrow attempts to throw Simon off the roof, but Jeffries shoots him multiple times, and he falls off the edge and to his death.

Art and Siebring later visit Simon, now living with foster parents, at his school. Simon embraces Art as a welcome friend, having accepted him as a person he trusts.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development ===
Barry Sonnenfeld was initially slated to direct the film, but due to commitments to &quot;Men in Black&quot; dropped out and was replaced with Harold Becker.

===Casting===
Prior to Bruce Willis being cast, Nicolas Cage and George Clooney were also considered for the lead.

==Release==
===Home media===

&quot;Mercury Rising&quot; was released for VHS and DVD on September 15, 1998, followed by LaserDisc on September 22. The Collector&#x27;s Edition and DTS versions for DVD were released in 1999. A Blu-ray with Multi-Format was released on September 14, 2010, and the Double Feature with the film and &quot;The Jackal&quot; was also released for Blu-ray on March 22, 2011.

==Reception==

===Box office===
The film earned $10,104,715 in its opening weekend in 2,386 theaters, ranking in third place behind &quot;Lost in Space&quot; and &quot;Titanic&quot;. Altogether, the film grossed $32,935,289 in the United States and $60,172,000 internationally for a total of $93,107,289.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a score of 21% based on reviews from 57 critics with an average rating of 4.37/10. The consensus states: &quot;&quot;Mercury Rising&quot; lays the action on thick, but can never find a dramatic pulse to keep viewers or Bruce Willis engaged with its maudlin story.&quot; Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four, writing: &quot;&quot;Mercury Rising&quot; is about the most sophisticated cryptographic system known to man, and about characters considerably denser than anyone in the audience. Sitting in the dark, our minds idly playing with the plot, we figure out what they should do, how they should do it, and why they should do it, while the characters on the screen strain helplessly against the requirements of the formula.&quot; James Berardinelli rated it one and a half out of four stars, saying: &quot;The script for &quot;Mercury Rising&quot; is exceptionally tiresome and hard-to-swallow. ... Once again, certain standby plot elements the high-level government conspiracy and the maverick law enforcement agent are recycled, and not to good effect. While Bruce Willis can play the action hero as well as anyone in Hollywood, this particular outing leaves him marooned in situations that are characterized by too little tension and too much nonsense.&quot;

===Accolades===
Bruce Willis received the 1999 Golden Raspberry Award as Worst Actor for his performance (as well as for &quot;Armageddon&quot; and &quot;The Siege&quot;). 
Miko Hughes won the category of Best Performance in a Feature Film—Leading Young Actor at the 1999 Young Artist Awards for his portrayal of Simon.

<doc id="689982" wikidata="Q12859193" url="?curid=689982" title="Nightmare disorder">
<text>Nightmare disorder is a sleep disorder characterized by repeated intense nightmares that most often center on threats to physical safety and security. The nightmares usually occur during the REM stage of sleep, and the person who experiences the nightmares typically remembers them well upon waking. More specifically, nightmare disorder is a type of parasomnia, a subset of sleep disorders categorized by abnormal movement or behavior or verbal actions during sleep or shortly before or after. Other parasomnias include sleepwalking, sleep terrors, bedwetting, and sleep paralysis.

Nightmare disorders can be confused with sleep terror disorders. The difference is that after a sleep terror episode, the patient wakes up with more dramatic symptoms than with a nightmare disorder, such as screaming and crying. Furthermore, they do not remember the reason of the fear, while a patient with a nightmare disorder remembers every detail of the dream. Finally, the sleep terrors usually occur during NREM Sleep.

Nightmares also have to be distinguished from bad dreams, which are less emotionally intense. Furthermore, nightmares contain more scenes of aggression than bad dreams and more unhappy endings. Finally, people experiencing nightmares feel more fear than with bad dreams.

The treatment depends on whether or not there is a comorbid PTSD diagnosis. About 4% of American adults are affected. Studies examining nightmare disorders have found that the prevalence rates ranges 2–6% with the prevalence being similar in the US, Canada, France, Iceland, Sweden, Belgium, Finland, Austria, Japan, and the Middle East.

== Signs and symptoms ==
During the nightmare, the sleeper may scream and yell out things. The nightmare sufferer is often awakened by these threatening, frightening dreams and can often vividly remember their experience. Upon awakening, the sleeper is usually alert and oriented within their surroundings, but may have an increased heart rate and symptoms of anxiety, like sweating. They may have trouble falling back to sleep for fear they will experience another nightmare.

A person experiencing nightmare disorder may have trouble going through everyday tasks; anxiety and lack of sleep caused by the fearful dreams may hinder the individual from completing everyday tasks efficiently and correctly. Upon experiencing this, these nightmare sufferers may consult with a psychiatrist.

The sleeper may have recurring episodes of awakening while recalling the intensely disturbing dream manifestations which usually result from fear or anxiety, but can also be triggered by anger, sadness, disgust, and other dysphoric emotions. Additionally, the sleeper may experience at least one of the following two features: delayed return of going back to sleep after episodes, and having episodes in the latter half of the sleep period.

=== Consequences ===
Nightmare disorder is common: it affects about 4% of the adult population. Even if children have more nightmares than adults, only 1% of children meet the criteria of the disorder. Nightmare disorder can impair the quality of life for people who are affected by the condition. It can make the patient avoid sleep, which leads to sleep deprivation, which in turn may lead to even more intense nightmares. Some other consequences of the nightmare disorder are fatigue and insomnia.

Nightmare disorders have negative consequences on several aspects of the patient&#x27;s life, such as sleep, cognitive and emotional functioning and well-being. Nightmares can also have negative impact on the bed partner&#x27;s life.

=== Content of idiopathic nightmares ===
Physical aggression is the main theme of nightmares. Other fields, such as interpersonal conflict, failure, helplessness, apprehension, being chased, accidents, evil forces, disasters, insects and environmental abnormalities may also feature in nightmares. Fear is the most frequent emotion associated with nightmares, even if other emotions such as sadness, anger, and confusion can also be present.

== Criteria ==
According to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, the criteria needed to diagnose a nightmare disorder are the following. First, the presence of frequent nightmares that imply danger for the person and impact mood in a negative way is needed. Second, when waking up from nightmares, the person behaves in an alert way. Finally, the disorder has to have a significant impact on the patient&#x27;s personal, social or professional functioning, in areas like mood, sleep, cognition, behaviour, fatigue, family and occupation.

== Causes ==
Nightmares can be caused by extreme pressure or irritation if no other mental disorder is discovered. The death of a loved one or a stressful life event can be enough to cause a nightmare, but conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder and other psychiatric disorders have been known to cause nightmares as well. If the individual is on medication, the nightmares may be attributed to some side effects of the drug. Amphetamines, antidepressants, and stimulants like cocaine and caffeine can cause nightmares. Blood pressure medication, levodopa and medications for Parkinson&#x27;s disease have also been known to cause nightmares.

The nightmares may be idiopathic or could be associated with psychiatric disorders like post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder. Nightmares can also be triggered by stress and anxiety and substance abuse, such as drugs that affect the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine and serotonin. Nevertheless, causality between drugs such as beta-blockers or alpha-agonists and nightmares is still unclear and further research needs to be done to investigate the biochemical mechanisms of nightmares.

Eighty percent of patients who have PTSD report nightmares. Patients with PTSD have symptoms that are classified into three clusters: intrusive/re-experiencing, numbing, and hyperarousal. Nightmares are usually considered to be part of the intrusive/re-experiencing symptom.

Some differences exist between idiopathic and PTSD related nightmares. A person with PTSD having nightmares would wake up during the night more frequently and for a longer time than with idiopathic nightmares. Consequently, people with PTSD would have a poorer sleep quality. Furthermore, nightmares related to PTSD would be more stressful than idiopathic ones. However, further studies have to be conducted in this area to obtain more reliable results.

== Assessment ==
Polysomnography records physiological parameters, such as electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG) and electrooculography (EOG) in a sleep laboratory. However, the frequency of posttraumatic nightmares tends to decrease in an artificial lab setting, which would impact the content of nightmares. Consequently, assessment of nightmare disorders using polysomnography has to last for a longer period, in order to let the patient get used to the artificial environment.

Self-report by a questionnaire or by a diary is another way to investigate nightmare disorders. However, these methods are questionable. Indeed, when filling out questionnaires with questions about a long period, people often tend to underestimate the frequency of their nightmares because of forgetting. On the contrary, filling out a diary every day may lead to an overestimation of the numbers of nightmares, because of the focusing on this phenomenon.

== Comorbidity ==
Studies have reported that nightmare disorders were present in 50–70% of the cases for PTSD, in 17.5% for depression, in 18.3% for insomnia, in 16.7% for schizophrenia and in 49% for borderline personality disorder. For all psychiatric disorders taken together, nightmare disorders are present in 29.9% of the cases, a much bigger rate than for the general population, which is 2–5%. Nightmare disorders can also be associated with sleep disorders such as night terrors, chronic insomnia and sleep-disordered breathing. The presence of nightmares before a trauma would influence severity of PTSD symptoms. Furthermore, having nightmares is linked to a significantly higher risk of attempting suicide and of death by suicide.

== Treatment ==
Stress reduction techniques such as yoga, meditation and exercise may help to eliminate stress and create a more peaceful sleeping atmosphere.

Diagnosis and medication can only be given to patients that report the recurring nightmares to a psychiatrist or other physician. Medications like prazosin are sometimes used to treat nightmares in people with PTSD. Therapy usually helps to deal with the frightening themes of the nightmares and alleviate the recurrence of the dreams. The persistent nightmares will usually improve as the patient gets older. Therapy is usually efficient to treat chronic nightmares in PTSD disorder or in other population.

Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is a specialized intervention in which the focus is to stimulate neural mechanisms to induce disturbing memories and experiences. It has demonstrated a significant nightmares&#x27; reduction, especially for the treatment of PTSD. Silver, Brooks and Obenchain have found a decrease of the nightmares with Vietnam War veterans after 90 days of EMDR. Jayatunge has found significant results with people who have survived to a tsunami. Greenwald has successfully used the EMDR with children. There wasn&#x27;t any negative consequence due to the EMDR sessions.

Imagery rehearsal therapy is a cognitive behavioral therapy where the patient rescripts the nightmare in any way they choose and then practices the new dream they choose to have using imagery. It has been shown as efficient to treat nightmare disorder in PTSD as well as in non PTSD populations. In this treatment, the person has to write a new scenario of the nightmare with positive images that will be rehearsed during 10 to 20 minutes per day, in order to change the negative content of the nightmare. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is also efficient to treat nightmares in the PTSD population. This method aims to change sleep habits with a clinician&#x27;s help and the use of tools such as a sleep diary. Although many studies have been done in which positive results were recorded, there are few studies in which results were inconclusive or had a delayed effect.

Exposure, relaxation and rescripting therapy is used to treat PTSD-related nightmares. This intervention combines Imagery Rehearsal Therapy with exposure and relaxation techniques. The main objective is to work on changing maladjusted sleep habits and the trauma-related themes of nightmares.

Research has been undertaken to investigate if sufferers of nightmares could benefit from the ability to be aware that they are indeed dreaming, a process known as lucid dreaming. The Lucid Dreaming Therapy is a specific method of the Imagery Rehearsal Therapy. The dreamer is conscious during their dream and can modulate it. Consequently, anxiety decreases, controllability increases, expectations change, which will impact the frequency of nightmares. Several studies have shown significant results with the lucid dreaming therapy. Two studies indicate a decrease of the nightmare frequency after only 12 weeks and one study shows, in 80% of the cases, a total disappearance of the nightmares after one year. Although these studies showed the efficacy of this therapy in the reduction of nightmare frequency on patients from the general population, so far evidence for this treatment is still weak.

Systematic Desensitization, using graduated exposure, has been shown to be efficient to treat chronic nightmares. The person has to face the frightening elements of nightmares in a gradual way, from least to most stressful. When the person starts to feel unsecure, she has to manage the stress by applying a relaxation technique.

===Pharmacological treatments===
Pharmacological treatments could be also efficient to treat nightmare disorder. Most of the treatments were assessed to patients with PTSD. The most efficient is an alpha-blocker, Prazosin, which reduces tone during sleep by blocking noradrenergic receptors. Prazosin would significantly decrease the number of PTSD related nightmares and would therefore improve sleep quality. However, only few studies considered the effect of Prazosin in idiopathic nightmares. Benzodiazepines are also often used to treat nightmare disorder, despite the lack of efficacy demonstrated in empirical studies. Some patients were also treated with atypical antipsychotic medications. Olanzapine has quickly decreased the nightmares. Two studies have shown the positive effects of Risperidone. Aripiprazole is more tolerated than olanzapine and has demonstrated substantial improvement in the nightmare frequency. Some other drugs as clonidine, cyproheptadine, fluvoxamine, gabapentin, nabilone, phenelzine, topiramate or trazodone have presented an amelioration of the nightmares. But some further researches are needed. Medication has shown efficacy to treat chronic nightmares among a PTSD population but the impact of pharmacological treatments on other populations, such as drug-related nightmares, are unknown. Furthermore, patients usually take more than one medication at a time, whatever the cause related to nightmares, leading to possible interactive effects.

== Epidemiology ==
About 2–6% of American adults are affected by nightmare disorders. About 4% of American adults are affected by nightmare disorders. Women seem to be more affected than men, the ratio being 2–4 : 1. This inequality decreases with aging because of a less high prevalence in elderly women. The rate of nightmares increases from ages 10–19 to 20–39, and then decreases during the ages of 50–59. The rates of nightmares for men increases from ages 10–19 to 30–39, and then decreases at the age of 50–59. However, it is still unclear if the difference of prevalence between men and women is real or if it reflects a higher dream recall capacity of women.

According to studies, children at the age of 6–10 years are 41% more likely to experience nightmares and 22% at the age of 11. Children with persistent nightmares range from 10% to 50%. However, only 1% of children meet the criteria of a nightmare disorder. Some factors tend to predict the development of a disorder from the presence of nightmares during childhood, such as a fear of going to sleep or going back to bed after a nightmare, an irregular sleep life and an avoidance of thinking about the nightmare.

== Research ==
* Dissociative disorders are usually paired with Nightmare Disorder 57% of the time. Nightmare disorder is believed to be associated with Dissociative Disorders as a defense mechanism that is used to escape from the traumatic event that caused the Dissociative Disorder. People with Dissociative Disorder and Nightmare disorder are more likely to self-mutilate, attempt suicide, and have Borderline Personality Disorder.
* Borderline personality disorder with Nightmare Disorder is very common, since the stages of sleep vary from that of a normal person (i.e. increased stage one sleep, and less stage four sleep). People with Borderline Personality disorder and Nightmare Disorder are usually the severest of those who have Borderline Personality Disorder; therefore, treating those with Nightmare Disorder may also help some with Borderline Personality Disorder.
* Hypnosis seems to be a new and effective treatment for those with Nightmare Disorder, since it increases relaxation.
* Nightmare disorder is also associated with those who have lower cholesterol. This connection is unclear; however, cholesterol may affect other hormones in the body (such as serotonin) which may affect one&#x27;s sleep.

<doc id="689987" wikidata="Q517097" url="?curid=689987" title="Stan Stasiak">
<text>George Emile Stipich (April 13, 1937 – June 19, 1997) was a Canadian professional wrestler, better known by his ring name, Stan &quot;the Man&quot; Stasiak. He is best known for his appearances with the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) in the 1970s, where he won the WWWF Heavyweight Championship in 1973. He was inducted into the Legacy wing of the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2018.

== Early life ==
George Stipich was born in the village of Arvida, Quebec. He became a fan of wrestling as a youth, attending shows in Chicoutimi. Stipich and his friends became known for throwing sucker punches at wrestlers; on one occasion, wrestler Don Leo Jonathan blocked Stipich&#x27;s punch and knocked him unconscious. As a young man, Stipich worked in an aluminium mill while playing ice hockey in the Quebec Amateur Hockey Association but became known for his lack of discipline, with his final coach encouraging him to switch to professional wrestling.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early career (1958–1965) ===
Stipich trained in Montreal, making his debut in 1958. He initially wrestled as &quot;Emile Koverly&quot; for the Calgary, Alberta–based Big Time Wrestling promotion. He also wrestled at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto which included a match with Gino Morella, who was later known as Gorilla Monsoon. in October 1960, he wrestled in the United States for the St. Louis Wrestling Club, where he adopted the ring name &quot;Stan Stasiak&quot;, taking it from another wrestler named Stanley Stasiak (real name Ignacy Josef Stasiak) who had died in 1931 from sepsis.

By 1961, Stasiak was dividing his time between Canada and the St. Louis Wrestling Club. In June 1961, he won his first championship in the Maple Leaf Wrestling promotion, teaming with Man Mountain Campbell to win the NWA International Tag Team Championship. They held the titles until September 1961. Stasiak continued to wrestle in Canada and the United States throughout the early 1960s, including making a handful of appearances with the Minneapolis, Minnesota–based American Wrestling Association in May 1962. In late 1963, he had a stint with the Amarillo, Texas–based Western States Sports promotion, where he challenged NWA World Heavyweight Champion Lou Thesz.

=== Stampede Wrestling (1964–1968) ===
From 1964 to 1968, Stasiak appeared regularly with the Calgary, Alberta, Canada–based Stampede Wrestling promotion. He held the NWA Canadian Heavyweight Championship on four occasions between 1965 and 1967 and the Stampede Wrestling North American Heavyweight Championship on three occasions in 1968.

=== Pacific Northwest Wrestling (1965–1971) ===
In 1965, Stasiak began appearing regularly with Pacific Northwest Wrestling, where he adopted the fictional &quot;Buzzard Creek, Oregon&quot; as his hometown. He won the promotion&#x27;s flagship title, the NWA Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Championship, five times in 1965, 1966, 1968, and 1971. He also won the NWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship four times between 1965 and 1969, teaming with Haru Sasak, the Mad Russian, Mighty Ursus, and Tony Marino.

=== International Wrestling Enterprise (1969) ===
In April and May 1969, Stasiak toured Japan with the International Wrestling Enterprise promotion as part of its &quot;World Selection Series&quot;. During the tour, he regularly teamed with Dory Dixon and Tank Morgan in tag team matches and six-man tag team matches. On April 12, 1969, a two-out-of-three-falls match pitting Stasiak and Morgan against Thunder Sugiyama and Toyonobori for the Trans-World Wrestling Alliance World Tag Team Championship ended in a controversial manner, resulting in the titles being vacated; on April 20, Sugiyama and Rusher Kimura defeated Morgan and Stasiak to win the vacant titles. On April 22, Stasiak unsuccessfully challenged Billy Robinson for the IWA World Heavyweight Championship. Stasiak wrestled his final match with IWE on May 5, 1969, teaming with Dixon and Morgan in a loss to Sugiyama, Toyonobori, and the Great Kusatsu.

=== San Francisco (1969–1970) ===
In November 1969, Stasiak began wrestling for the San Francisco, California, United States–based Big Time Wrestling promotion. He quickly formed a tag team with The Gladiator and began feuding with Peter Maivia and Ray Stevens, repeatedly unsuccessfully challenging them for the NWA World Tag Team Championship. In August 1970, he formed a short-lived tag team with Pat Patterson. Stasiak left San Francisco in September 1970.

=== World Championship Wrestling (1970) ===
In October 1970, Stasiak wrestled in Australia for the World Championship Wrestling promotion. In his debut match, he defeated King Curtis Iaukea in the Festival Hall in Melbourne to win the IWA World Heavyweight Championship - his first world heavyweight championship. He lost the title back to Iaukea the following month.

=== World Wide Wrestling Federation (1971–1972) ===
In August 1971, Stasiak debuted in the northeastern United States–based World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF). In his debut match, he challenged WWWF Heavyweight Champion Pedro Morales in Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York. Over the following months, he faced opponents such as Gorilla Monsoon, Arnold Skaaland, Víctor Rivera, and Chief Jay Strongbow throughout the northeastern United States. In September 1971, he unsuccessfully challenged Bobo Brazil for the WWWF United States Heavyweight Championship. He went on to unsuccessfully challenge Morales for the WWWF Heavyweight Championship on a number of further occasions. In February 1972, he formed a short-lived alliance with Jimmy Valiant. Valiant left the WWWF later that month.

=== Texas (1972) ===
In March 1972, Stasiak began appearing with the Texas-based Big Time Wrestling and Houston Wrestling promotions, facing opponents such as Bull Curry, Johnny Valentine, and Toru Tanaka. In June 1972, Stasiak defeated Red Bastien to win the NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship at the Big Time Wrestling Parade of Champions event in the Texas Stadium. His reign lasted until October 1972 when he lost to José Lothario in a cage match in the San Antonio Municipal Auditorium. He also briefly held the NWA Brass Knuckles Championship. Stasiak left Texas in December 1972, with his final appearance being a loss to Fritz Von Erich in a Texas death cage match in the Dallas Sportatorium on Boxing Day.

=== All Japan Pro Wrestling (1973) ===
In February 1973, Stasiak appeared in Japan with the recently founded All Japan Pro Wrestling promotion. Wrestling as &quot;Crusher Stasiak&quot;, he participated in the &quot;Giant Series Total War&quot; tour. His opponents included Motoshi Okuma, Munenori Higo, and Thunder Sugiyama. During the tour, he occasionally teamed with American wrestler Harley Race. In his final match, he and Race defeated Giant Baba and Samson Kutsuwada in a two-out-of-three-falls match.

=== World Wide Wrestling Federation (1973–1974) ===
Stasiak returned to the WWF in August 1973, adopting the Grand Wizard as his manager. In his first match, he unsuccessfully challenged WWWF Heavyweight Champion Pedro Morales; he went on to challenge Morales in multiple subsequent matches. In November 1973, he faced André the Giant in a series of six-man tag team matches.

On December 1, 1973, in the Philadelphia Arena, Stasiak defeated Morales for the WWWF Heavyweight Championship, ending Morales&#x27; nearly three-year long reign. The match ended when Stasiak applied a full nelson to Morales and both wrestlers fell backwards in a position where they both had their shoulders on the mat, only for Stasiak to lift his shoulder as the referee made the count. Following the match, ring announcer Buddy Wagner did not announce Stasiak as the new champion, instead asking the audience to applaud Morales; journalist Dave Meltzer suggested that this was intended to prevent the audience from rioting. Stasiak was given little notice that he would be winning the title. According to him, he was sitting in the dressing room in Philadelphia Arena when a road agent came to discuss the match. Stasiak considered this a formality as he had been having the same discussion, nearly verbatim, in every major city on the Eastern Seaboard for the past two months. However, this time it was different, as the agent told Stasiak that he was to win the championship. According to fellow wrestler Frank Dusek, the WWWF wanted to make Bruno Sammartino champion again, but did not want Sammartino to defeat Morales in the process, so they needed a heel wrestler to win it. Stasiak was used as a transitional champion, holding the WWWF Heavyweight Championship for just nine days before losing it to Sammartino on December 10, 1973, in Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York, United States. Stasiak described his title reign as &quot;the happiest nine days of [my] life&quot;. During his brief reign, Stasiak had a single successful title defense, wrestling Chief Jay Strongbow to a no contest on December 7, 1973.

Stasiak faced Sammartino in a rematch in January 1974, but failed to regain the title. In March 1974, Stasiak teamed with Larry Hennig to unsuccessfully challenge Dean Ho and Tony Garea for the WWWF Tag Team Championship. Stasiak continued regularly appearing with the WWF until October 1974.

=== New Japan Pro-Wrestling (1974) ===
In April and May 1974, Stasiak toured Japan with New Japan Pro-Wrestling, competing in its inaugural World League round-robin tournament. On the first day of the tournament, he wrestled Antonio Inoki to a time limit draw in an exhibition match held in Korakuen Hall in Tokyo. Stasiak scored 5.5 points in the first round of the tournament, but did not progress past the second round. The tournament was ultimately won by Inoki.

=== St. Louis Wrestling Club (1975) ===
In February 1975, Stasiak began wrestling for the St. Louis Wrestling Club, where he regularly appeared on its television show &quot;Wrestling at the Chase&quot;. His repeat opponents included Pat O&#x27;Connor, Édouard Carpentier, and Red Bastien. In October 1975, Stasiak unsuccessfully challenged visiting WWWF Heavyweight Champion Bruno Sammartino. Stasiak left St. Louis in December 1975, with his final match being a loss to Terry Funk in the Kiel Auditorium.

=== Maple Leaf Wrestling (1974–1978) ===
In July 1974 he began to wrestle for Frank Tunney&#x27;s Ontario promotion, Maple Leaf Wrestling, he fought Tiger Jeet Singh for the Asian title at Maple Leaf Gardens. During the match The Sheik attacked Singh causing Stasiak to lose. From there Stasiak went into a series of matches with The Sheik for the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship. Stasiak&#x27;s popularity rose as fans discovered that he was indeed a Canadian. Later on he fought Jack Brisco for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in 1975, Terry Funk for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in 1976, Superstar Billy Graham WWWF Heavyweight Championship in 1977 and Nick Bockwinkel for the AWA World Heavyweight Championship in 1978.

=== Georgia Championship Wrestling (1976) ===
In January 1976, Stasiak began wrestling for the Atlanta-based Georgia Championship Wrestling promotion. He regularly teamed with other heels such as Abdullah the Butcher, Moondog Mayne, and The Spoiler. In March 1976, Stasiak defeated Dick Slater to win the NWA Macon Heavyweight Championship. He lost the title to Mr. Wrestling II the following month. In September 1976, Stasiak and Killer Brooks unsuccessfully challenged The Black Bombers for the NWA Georgia Tag Team Championship. Stasiak left Georgia Championship Wrestling in October 1976.

=== World Wide Wrestling Federation (1975–1979) ===
On September 13, 1975, Stasiak wrestled Bruno Sammartino who was WWWF Heavyweight Champion to a double disqualification in Steubenville, Ohio.

In November 1976, Stasiak began regularly wrestling for the WWWF once more. In his first match back, he challenged WWWF Heavyweight Champion Bruno Sammartino in Madison Square Garden, winning by count-out. The following month, he lost to Sammartino in a &quot;Sicilian stretcher&quot; match. In early-1977, Stasiak repeatedly challenged Billy White Wolf and Chief Jay Strongbow for the WWWF Tag Team Championship, with his partners including Baron Mikel Scicluna, Baron von Raschke, and Tor Kamata. Throughout spring 1977, Stasiak repeatedly unsuccessfully challenged Sammartino. During the remainder of 1977 and early 1978, Stasiak&#x27;s regular opponents included Gorilla Monsoon, Ivan Putski, Larry Zbyszko, and Peter Maivia. In April 1978, Stasiak unsuccessfully challenged Bob Backlund, who had recently won the WWWF Heavyweight Championship. Over the following months, he teamed with a series of partners including Butcher Vachon, George Steele, and Johnny Rodz to challenge WWWF Tag Team Champions Dino Bravo and Dominic DeNucci, but was unable to defeat them. Beginning in December 1978, he again teamed with a series of partners to challenge new WWWF Tag Team Champions Larry Zbyszko and Tony Garea. Stasiak left the WWWF in March 1979.

=== New Japan Pro-Wrestling (1979) ===
Stasiak once again toured Japan with New Japan Pro-Wrestling from February to April 1979 as part of its &quot;Big Fight Series&quot;. His first match, a loss to Riki Choshu, was broadcast on TV Asahi. During the tour, Stasiak faced opponents such as Antonio Inoki, Riki Choshu, Seiji Sakaguchi, and Tatsumi Fujinami. On several occasions, he teamed with fellow Canadian wrestler Tiger Jeet Singh and with the Japanese wrestler Masa Saito.

=== Late career (1979–1984) ===
In spring 1979, Stasiak returned to Pacific Northwest Wrestling, where he became a mainstay. He won the NWA Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Championship twice more in 1979 and the NWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship four more times. In the early 1980s, he did commentary there and also worked as a photographer. In mid-1980, Stasiak appeared with the Louisiana, United States–based Mid-South Wrestling promotion. In the latter half of 1980, Stasiak competed in Texas once more, appearing with Big Time Wrestling and Western States Sports. During this time, he won the NWA Texas Tag Team Championship and the NWA Brass Knuckles Championship. Stasiak retired from professional wrestling in 1984.

=== Retirement ===
After retiring in 1984, Stasiak worked for Kellum Datsun in Gladstone, Oregon, as a car salesman. After a short time at the Datsun dealership, he moved to Toronto, where he worked as a security guard. When his health began to decline, he relocated back to Oregon in 1994. He was inducted into the Stampede Wrestling Hall of Fame in 1995, and (posthumously) into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2018.

== Professional wrestling style and persona ==
For most of his career, Stasiak portrayed a &quot;menacing&quot; heel known for his &quot;rulebreaking tactics&quot;. Early in his career he used the nicknames &quot;Crusher&quot; and &quot;the Assassin of Arvida&quot; and a bear hug for a finishing move. Later, he adopted the nickname &quot;The Man&quot; and began using the heart punch - &quot;a stiff shot to his opponent&#x27;s chest, sold as if it could stop the organ from pumping were Stasiak to land his fist just right&quot; - as his finishing move. He was a &quot;large, powerful, bruising&quot; wrestler. Although hailing from Canada, for most of his career Stasiak was billed from the (fictitious) towns of &quot;Beaver Creek&quot; or &quot;Buzzard Creek&quot; in Oregon in the United States.

== Death ==
Stipich died of congestive heart failure on June 19, 1997, while awaiting a heart transplant. Fellow wrestler Tony Borne gave the eulogy at his funeral, describing him as &quot;a very good natured-individual&quot; and &quot;a real trooper&quot; .

<doc id="689988" wikidata="Q778014" url="?curid=689988" title="Ivan Koloff">
<text>Oreal Donald Perras (August 25, 1942 – February 18, 2017) was a Canadian professional wrestler, better known by the ring name &quot;the Russian Bear&quot; Ivan Koloff, where he was billed from Russia and, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Ukraine. He was the third wrestler to hold the WWWF Championship.

== Early life ==
Perras was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada and raised on a dairy farm in rural Ontario along with his six brothers and three sisters.

Since first watching professional wrestling on TV at the age of eight, he wanted to become a wrestler, and would often wrestle with his brothers growing up. At age 18, he left high school and joined Jack Wentworth&#x27;s wrestling school in Hamilton, Ontario, where he would lift weights and learn wrestling holds.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early career (1963–1967) ===
Perras debuted as an Irish rogue villain character named Red McNulty, billed from Dublin, Ireland and wrestling with an eyepatch. For the next three years, he wrestled around the Toronto area, eventually quitting his regular job to wrestle in the north-western area of Canada. There, Perras acquired much wrestling experience, and from there he made his first trip to Japan.

=== The Russian Bear (1967–1994) ===
In 1967, Perras became &quot;The Russian Bear&quot; Ivan Koloff, a bearded villainous character billed from Ukraine (the name was taken from Dan Kolov, an actual Bulgarian wrestler who had competed in Canada in the 1930s), and debuted with the International Wrestling Association in Montreal, Québec. He defeated Johnny Rougeau for the IWA International Heavyweight Championship the following year. Koloff debuted in the World Wide Wrestling Federation in late 1969, managed by &quot;Captain&quot; Lou Albano. He soon started a rivalry with then-WWWF World Heavyweight Champion Bruno Sammartino. On January 18, 1971, Koloff defeated Sammartino in Madison Square Garden for the WWWF World Heavyweight Championship by pinfall after a knee drop from the top rope, ending Sammartino&#x27;s seven and two-thirds years reign. Koloff lost the championship 21 days later to Pedro Morales, essentially being used as a &quot;transitional champion&quot; to move the title from Sammartino to Morales without the two fan favorites working against each other, much like Stan Stasiak and The Iron Sheik would be in later years. After the loss, Koloff remained a contender for the title but never reclaimed it, leaving the WWWF in 1971. During his time in the WWWF, Koloff weighing in at wrestled WWWF World Heavyweight Championship title matches against Sammartino, Morales, Superstar Billy Graham and Bob Backlund, holding the distinction, with fellow villain Stan Stasiak, as one of only two men to challenge all four of these champions. Koloff would also challenge Sammartino for the WWWF World Heavyweight Championship in the first ever steel cage match at Madison Square Garden in a rematch loss on December 15, 1975. He fought in the WWWF from 1975 to 1976, 1978–1979 and 1983.

During the 1970s and 1980s, Koloff found success in the National Wrestling Alliance, winning many regional tag team and singles titles in the Georgia, Florida, and Mid-Atlantic territories. In February 1981, he teamed with Ray Stevens to defeat Paul Jones and Masked Superstar to capture the NWA World Tag Team Championship. This would be the first of his four reigns as NWA World Tag Team Champion, later winning the belts with Don Kernodle and twice with his &quot;nephew&quot; (kayfabe), Nikita Koloff as The Russian Team.

In April and May 1973, Koloff wrestled in Japan for the International Wrestling Enterprise promotion as part of its Dynamite Series. In his debut match, he teamed with Mad Dog Vachon to defeat Great Kusatsu and Strong Kobayashi for the IWA World Tag Team Championship in a two-out-of-three falls match. They lost the titles to Great Kusatsu and Rusher Kimura several weeks later.

The Russians (which also included Krusher Kruschev) were a top villainous group from 1984 to 1986, and Nikita, under Perras&#x27; training and mentoring, and by association, became a hated villain in his own right, and would go on to have a successful singles career of his own. After Nikita turned on Ivan to join their enemy Dusty Rhodes in 1986, the latter teamed with Vladimir Petrov and Dick Murdoch to get revenge. Koloff&#x27;s biggest NWA feuds were against Rhodes, The Road Warriors, The Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson) and Magnum T. A. In 1988, Koloff spent time in Paul Jones&#x27; faction, The Paul Jones Army, where he was a &quot;coach&quot; of sorts for The Powers of Pain, The Barbarian and The Warlord. He later split with Jones, reunited with Nikita, and feuded with Jones&#x27; team, The Russian Assassins, before leaving Jim Crockett Promotions in January 1989. In 1992, Koloff also wrestled in the first television main event of Jim Cornette&#x27;s Smoky Mountain Wrestling, beating Bobby Fulton. He lost to Ron Garvin at Tim Horner&#x27;s National Championship Wrestling on July 22, 1994. He retired afterwards.

=== Eastern Championship Wrestling (1992–1993) ===
He also spent time in Eastern Championship Wrestling, appearing on the very first ECW card in 1992. In 1993 he began teaming with his storyline nephew Vladimir Koloff. The team won their debut match on the June 29 edition of &quot;ECW Hardcore TV&quot;. Koloff defeated The Sandman on the July 6, 1993, episode of &quot;ECW Hardcore TV&quot; in a number one contenders match for the ECW Heavyweight Championship.

=== Return to wrestling (2004–2013) ===
In 2004, Koloff returned to the ring for the first time in 10 years. He wrestled in the independent circuit. On August 27, 2005, Koloff defeated Dominic DeNucci in a Russian chain match at WrestleReunion. Koloff would win his final wrestling title defeating The Barbarian in a Russian chain match for the Legends title at NWA Charlotte. On July 19, 2013, Koloff lost to Shane Douglas in an Extreme Rules match at Mega Pro. His final match was against Bob Armstrong in which Armstrong won on November 16, 2013, at Superstars of Wrestling 1 in Rome, Georgia. Koloff stood around tall, and weighed approximately when he was at the peak of his career as a wrestler but Towards the end of his career, he dropped a considerable amount of weight and was tipping the scale at .

== Personal life==
Perras wrote a book titled &quot;Is That Wrestling Fake? The Bear Facts&quot; that was released on January 1, 2007. He became a born again Christian in 1995 and traveled to churches to share his testimony as an ordained minister. Koloff spoke openly and candidly of his conversion to Christianity and struggles with alcohol and drugs and the crazy days of wrestling in his 2014 book, &quot;Life in the Trenches.&quot; Perras was named as a defendant in a 2015 lawsuit filed by WWE after they received a letter from him indicating that he intended to sue them for concussion-based injuries sustained during his tenure with them. He was represented by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who is involved in several other lawsuits involving former WWE wrestlers. The lawsuit was dismissed in September 2018.

==Death==
Perras died at his home in Winterville, North Carolina, on February 18, 2017, from liver cancer.

== Other media ==
Koloff is featured as a playable character in the video games &quot;Legends of Wrestling&quot;, &quot;Legends of Wrestling II&quot; and &quot;&quot;.
